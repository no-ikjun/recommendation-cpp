 The Florida State Seminoles are coached by Bobby Bowden , father of Tommy Bowden . Their 2001 matchup marked only the second time that a father and son had faced each other as opposing head football coaches . The only other meeting had been the previous year , when Tommy lost by three points to his father . In the 2001 meeting , No. 4 Florida State dominated No. 10 Clemson from the start of the game . In an effort to impress BCS voters , Florida State ran up the score and the game ended with the Seminoles on top , 52 – 7 . The Seminoles ' win gave them the ACC football championship and dropped Clemson to a No. 16 ranking . With its spot as the No. 2 ACC team assured , Clemson accepted a bid to the Gator Bowl on November 14 , prior to its annual in @-@ state rivalry game against South Carolina . In that game , South Carolina took a one @-@ point lead with 59 seconds remaining , but Clemson drove the length of the field and kicked a field goal as time expired , giving the Tigers a 16 – 14 win to end the regular season .

 In the weeks before the Gator Bowl , media and fan attention focused on Virginia Tech 's possible disappointment at not being selected for a BCS game , the coaching situations at the two schools , and the issue of whether or not Tech quarterback Michael Vick would return for another year of collegiate football . After the Virginia Tech @-@ Clemson matchup was announced for the Gator Bowl , spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win by 6 @.@ 5 points . The betting line remained there throughout the month of December and until the game began . There were almost no off @-@ field incidents involving players from either team : The only notable event involved two backup players from Clemson who were indicted for money counterfeiting and were suspended for the Gator Bowl . In exchange for appearing in the game , the teams were guaranteed to split a payout of $ 3 @,@ 313 @,@ 610 . 
 = = = Virginia Tech disappointment = = = 
 Immediately after the Fiesta Bowl bypassed Virginia Tech in favor of lower @-@ ranked Notre Dame , protests from Tech fans and opponents of the BCS system erupted . Some said the selection was " unfair " , that Virginia Tech was " hosed " , or that the pick of Notre Dame was a " snub " of the Hokies . In an interview immediately after the selection , Vick said the Gator Bowl bid provided motivation to win the Gator Bowl . " We 're going to go out there and make a statement , play a great game and show the nation , " he said . Clemson , on the other hand , was enthusiastic about the Gator Bowl bid . A win in the game would have given the Tigers their first 10 @-@ win season since 1990 , and the Gator Bowl appearance marked a continued improvement over its showing the previous year . Clemson players viewed the game as a reward for a successful season , while Virginia Tech players perceived it from a more workmanlike point of view . Due to revenue @-@ sharing agreements among Big East schools , Virginia Tech 's selection by the Gator Bowl resulted in a payment of $ 1 @.@ 7 million less than if it had been selected by a BCS bowl game . Instead of receiving about $ 3 @.@ 5 million from the revenue agreement and bowl payout , Tech received about $ 1 @.@ 8 million . 
 = = = Coaching changes = = = 
 Both Virginia Tech and Clemson endured questions about their coaching staffs in the weeks and months prior to the Gator Bowl . Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer was interviewed by North Carolina prior to the end of the regular season , and he debated whether or not to accept that school 's head football coaching job . On November 27 , one week before Tech 's selection by the Gator Bowl , Beamer announced that he would not be departing for North Carolina or any other school . Beamer also was considered for the vacant head @-@ coaching position with the NFL 's Washington Redskins , but he also declined that position . Other Virginia Tech football coaches were targeted by teams to fill vacant head @-@ coaching positions . Virginia Tech offensive coordinator Rickey Bustle was interviewed for a job at Toledo , but he declined the position . Virginia Tech defensive coordinator Bud Foster was interviewed for the head @-@ coaching job at Virginia , but he likewise declined the job . 
 Tech 's situation was not reflected at Clemson , where offensive coordinator Rich Rodriguez announced that he was leaving the team for the head football coach job at West Virginia University , where he competed as a player in the 1980s . Rodriguez did not participate in Clemson 's practices prior to the Gator Bowl , and he did not coach during the game . Replacing Rodriguez as temporary offensive coordinator was Brad Scott . Joining him in the press box during the Gator Bowl was Mike O 'Cain , who was hired as Clemson 's new quarterbacks coach . In an effort to prevent further defections , Clemson awarded head coach Tommy Bowden a seven @-@ year contract extension worth $ 1 @.@ 1 million annually plus incentives . 
 = = = Michael Vick debate = = = 
 Throughout the regular season , a constant question hanging over the Virginia Tech Hokies football team was whether or not star quarterback Michael Vick would return for another year at the school . The National Football League requires that players be at least three years out of high school before they are eligible for the NFL Draft . Vick , who had not played during his freshman year at the school , would be three years out of high school in the spring following the Gator Bowl . 
 Vick attempted to defuse the discussion when he announced on December 15 that he would be returning for his fourth year with the team . But in late December , Vick wavered on that decision when it became clear that if he left the team , he would be selected as the No. 1 overall pick in the draft . Heading into the Gator Bowl , his decision was still up in the air .

Suggs had 222 carries for 1 @,@ 207 yards and 27 touchdowns during the regular season , while Kendrick had 102 rushes for 547 yards and three touchdowns . Suggs was the No. 1 rusher in the Big East in terms of touchdowns and rushing yards .

 One of Vick 's favorite targets in the limited Tech passing attack was wide receiver Andre Davis , who caught 24 passes for 318 yards and two touchdowns . Davis was limited by the fact that he played in only nine of Tech 's 11 games , but he still finished as the Hokies ' No. 2 receiver in terms of yardage . Tech 's No. 1 receiver was Emmett Johnson , who caught 34 passes for 574 yards and three touchdowns .

 The 2001 Gator Bowl kicked off on January 1 , 2001 at Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville , Florida . At kickoff , the weather was partly cloudy at 45 ° F ( 7 ° C ) degrees , with 41 percent humidity and a 6 miles per hour ( 10 km / h ) wind from the northwest . Virginia Tech won the traditional pregame coin toss to determine first possession and elected to kick off to Clemson to begin the game . 
 = = = First quarter = = = 
 Clemson fielded the opening kickoff at the two @-@ yard line and returned it to their 25 @-@ yard line , where the Tigers ' offense performed the game 's first offensive play , a one @-@ yard scramble by Dantzler . A subsequent running play and an incomplete pass caused Clemson to go three @-@ and @-@ out before punting . Clemson punter Jamie Somaini mishandled the ball , however , and Virginia Tech 's defense tackled him at the Tigers ' 23 @-@ yard line . On Tech 's first play after the turnover , quarterback Michael Vick completed a 23 @-@ yard pass to Jared Ferguson for a touchdown . The extra point kick by Carter Warley was successful , and Virginia Tech had a 7 – 0 lead with 13 : 23 remaining in the first quarter . 
 Virginia Tech 's post @-@ touchdown kickoff was downed at the Clemson 26 @-@ yard line , where the Tigers began their second offensive possession . It began no better than the first , as Dantzler was tackled for a three @-@ yard loss by defensive tackle Lamar Cobb . A rush for no gain and a short pass forced Clemson to again punt before gaining a first down . Somaini 's second punt was kicked cleanly , and the Hokies returned the punt to their 42 @-@ yard line . Two rushes and a pass to the 50 @-@ yard line were not enough for a first down , and Tech punted to the Clemson 17 @-@ yard line . 
 The Tigers ' third possession didn 't produce anything more than their first two possessions did . A running play was stopped for no gain , Dantzler was sacked for a loss of three yards by David Pugh , and a scramble by Dantzler gained only four yards . Clemson 's punt was downed at the Tech 41 @-@ yard line , and the Hokies had another chance on offense . On the first play of the drive , Vick scrambled for a nine @-@ yard gain . On the next play , Tech gained a first down on a run by backup running back Andre Kendrick to the Clemson 46 @-@ yard line . After an incomplete pass , Vick completed a six @-@ yard toss to Kendrick .

A reverse run by Johnson picked up five yards , then a run up the middle gained a first down at the Clemson nine @-@ yard line . Two rushes by Kendrick failed to reach the five @-@ yard line , then Vick ran six yards for Tech 's second touchdown of the game . The extra point was good , and Tech extended its lead to 14 – 0 with 1 : 08 remaining in the quarter . 
 Virginia Tech 's kickoff was returned to the Clemson 26 @-@ yard line , and the drive began with an incomplete pass from Dantzler . After that , the Tigers gained their first down of the game with a pass from Dantzler to wide receiver Rod Gardner at the 38 @-@ yard line . A run by Dantzler gained three yards , then Zachery gained five more with a run to the left side .

Suggs then gained 18 yards on a run to the left side of the field . At the Clemson 19 @-@ yard line , Suggs was stopped for a loss of one yard , then Vick was sacked for a loss of five yards . The third @-@ down play was an incomplete pass , and Carter Warley entered the game to attempt a 42 @-@ yard field goal . The kick bounced off the field goal crossbar but did not cross it , thus denying the Hokies three points . With 10 : 33 remaining in the half , Tech still had a 14 – 7 lead . 
 Following the missed field goal , Clemson 's offense started at its 25 @-@ yard line . On the first play of the drive , Dantzler completed a pass to wide receiver Rod Gardner , who ran for 25 yards and a first down at the 50 @-@ yard line .

On third down , Dantzler faked a quarterback sneak in order to attempt a long pass downfield . Dantzler was unable to pass , however , and was sacked for a four @-@ yard loss . Rather than attempt a field goal or punt the ball , Clemson coach Tommy Bowden had his team attempt to gain a first down . Dantzler scrambled forward , but didn 't gain the five yards needed . The Tigers thus turned the ball over on downs at the Tech 28 @-@ yard line . 
 Tech began its drive with an incomplete pass , which was followed by a short run . On third down , Vick prepared to throw the ball , but he was hit by Clemson defender Keith Adams and fumbled the ball .

Following the turnover , Dantzler was stopped on a short run then threw two incomplete passes . Rather than again attempt to convert a fourth down , Bowden sent in kicker Aaron Hunt to attempt a 28 @-@ yard field goal . The kick soared through the uprights , and Clemson narrowed Virginia Tech 's lead to 14 – 10 with 5 : 45 remaining in the quarter . 
 Kendrick returned Clemson 's post @-@ score kickoff to the Tech 23 @-@ yard line . A two @-@ yard run by Suggs was followed by a pass to Davis at the Tech 39 @-@ yard line for a first down . Two running plays set up third down and two , then Vick completed a 50 @-@ yard pass to Kendrick , who picked up a first down at the Clemson four @-@ yard line . From there , it took Suggs two rushes to pass the goal line for Virginia Tech 's third touchdown of the game . The extra point was good , and Tech extended its lead to 21 – 10 with 2 : 26 before halftime . 
 Tech 's post @-@ touchdown kickoff bounced to the Clemson two @-@ yard line before it was returned to the Clemson 12 @-@ yard line . An incomplete pass on first down was followed by a first @-@ down pass to Gardner at the 22 @-@ yard line . Dantzler then completed a pass to Watts at the 34 @-@ yard line for another first down . After an incomplete pass , Dantzler scrambled for a first down at the Clemson 47 @-@ yard line , where he completed a 17 @-@ yard pass to Robinson as time ticked below one minute remaining . From the Tech 36 @-@ yard line , Dantzler completed a pass to Gardner at the Tech 29 @-@ yard line . After a time out with 33 seconds remaining , Dantzler threw an incomplete pass . This was followed by another incomplete pass , and Clemson converted the first down with a pass to the Tech 24 @-@ yard line . An incomplete pass on first down was followed by another on second down . Following the play , there was only eight seconds left on the clock , and coach Bowden ordered Hunt into the game to attempt a 41 @-@ yard field goal . The kick was short and to the right , and Clemson turned the ball over with two seconds remaining . Vick took a knee to run the final seconds off the clock , and Virginia Tech entered halftime with a 21 – 10 lead .

 Immediately after the conclusion of the Gator Bowl , Vick was asked by an NBC broadcaster if he intended to return to Virginia Tech for another year of collegiate football . He responded that he would discuss matters with his family and Tech head coach Frank Beamer before making a decision . That announcement sparked a fresh round of speculation from sports pundits and fans wondering if Vick would choose to return to school or enter the 2001 NFL Draft . Virginia Tech , through its football coaching staff , began an intensive lobbying campaign in an effort to convince Vick to stay . On January 11 , 2001 , Vick held a press conference to announce that he would be forgoing his final two years of collegiate eligibility to enter the NFL Draft . Immediately after the announcement , he was predicted to be the No. 1 pick in the draft , a hypothesis realized on April 21 , when he was selected by the Atlanta Falcons , who had traded draft picks in order to have the right to select Vick .

 Vick was not the only player for whom the 2001 Gator Bowl was the final collegiate contest . Virginia Tech had two other players selected in the draft , and Clemson had three . From the Hokies , defensive back Cory Bird was selected with the 91st pick and center Matt Lehr was taken with the 137th selection . Clemson 's first NFL draft selection was wide receiver Rod Gardner , who was taken 15th . Also picked was defensive back Robert Carswell ( 244th ) .

 Invisible Circles is the third studio album by Dutch symphonic metal band After Forever . It was released on 25 March 2004 , by the small Dutch label Transmission Records . It is After Forever 's first full @-@ length album since the dismissal of guitarist and composer Mark Jansen , whose musical tastes had strongly influenced the sound of their first work Prison of Desire ( 2000 ) and their successful second offering Decipher ( 2001 ) . In this work After Forever choose a new musical direction , mostly revolving around elements of progressive metal instead of the gothic and symphonic metal of previous albums . The creative process for Invisible Circles took more than a year and required the use of three recording studios in the Netherlands and Germany . A long tour to support the album brought the band to some of the most important European rock festivals and to Central and South America . 
 Invisible Circles is a concept album about the dynamics of quarrelsome families and psychological child abuse . The theme was inspired by guitarist Sander Gommans ' work as an art teacher , in direct contact with dysfunctional families and teen @-@ age problems . It is also a metal opera , with a storyline that follows the lives of an abused child and her parents since her conception to adulthood . The album was received with mixed reviews , but entered the charts in the Netherlands and Belgium .

 By the end of 2001 , After Forever appeared as rising stars on the dynamic scene of Dutch metal , which included bands like The Gathering , Within Temptation , <unk> and Ayreon . Their second album Decipher ( 2001 ) had received very positive reviews and their name was well known in the underground scene of the Netherlands . Critics were impressed by the remarkable musicianship of the young members of the band and in particular by Floor Jansen ’ s vocals , both in studio and in live performances . In contrast with these premises for a bright future , the relationships within the band were not so idyllic . Soon after the release of Decipher , After Forever faced a strong creative contrast between founding member and guitarist Mark Jansen and the rest of the band . Mark Jansen had been the main composer of the band together with Sander Gommans and his love for movie soundtracks and classical music had had a strong influence on the musical style of After Forever ’ s first two albums , Prison of Desire ( 2000 ) and Decipher . Moreover , his interest for religious and moral themes had characterized his lyrics for many songs , often collected under a common title ( e.g. The Embrace That Smothers and My Pledge of Allegiance ) . In the next album , Mark Jansen meant to further explore complex interactions between classical instruments , choruses in Latin and death metal elements , while Gommans and the others preferred a more direct and aggressive approach to music , retaining some elements that made the sound of the band recognizable , but expanding it in new and different directions . These musical differences led to Mark Jansen leaving the band , in what he felt as an actual dismissal . 
 He quickly formed another band called Sahara Dust , which later developed into the symphonic metal band Epica . His place was taken by Bas Maas , who had been the guitar technician for After Forever during the tours of 2001 and 2002 . August and September 2002 were dedicated to a European tour , supporting Finnish act Nightwish and attending some rock festivals , which exposed the band to larger audiences and gained them even more favourable press . Further media exposure came from Floor Jansen 's collaboration with Dutch multi @-@ instrumentalist and composer Arjen Anthony <unk> , for the recording of Star One 's album Space Metal and the subsequent tour in late 2002 . Jansen 's activities , as well as the regular jobs and studies of the After Forever band members , reduced the band 's live performances for the rest of 2002 and half of 2003 . It was known that the band was working at a new album from the beginning of 2003 , but their first release was the EP Exordium in October 2003 , containing an instrumental track , three new songs and two covers . In Jansen ’ s words " the EP Exordium was like an introduction to this new full length album and the subjects of the lyrics are already connected to the concept ( ... ) meaning they are also dealing with modern , social problems " . 
 The reviewers noticed some musical changes in the new work , but some of them suspended their judgement , waiting for a full album to express their opinions about the new course of After Forever . 
 = = Concept and storyline = = 
 The concept of Invisible Circles was shaped by After Forever 's singer and lyricist Floor Jansen , taking inspiration from Sander Gommans ' job as an art teacher . His daily contact with children with social and family problems had given him the desire to make people aware of these problems by incorporating their stories into songs . He had also realized that those children 's problems often stemmed from the psychological traumas that their parents had experienced in their past . Gommans described the title and the concept of the album in these terms : " Invisible Circles describes the paths of life that someone can follow . Life consists of several circles that you can follow ; many times you will come back at the beginning of a circle , although you have tried to get out of that particular circle . " 
 The plot revolves around a dysfunctional family , comprising a father , a mother , their daughter and the father 's mother . The story begins with two lovers , whose relationship is running dry . They decide to have a child , which the woman believes may save their relationship ( " Between Love and Fire " ) . The birth of a baby girl destroys in the mother her hopes for a brilliant professional career and smothers her passion . On the other hand , the newborn child causes in the father a stiffening of his feelings and the refusal to compromise his career for a " spoilt brat " ( " Sins of Idealism " ) . The girl , perceived in the family as an unwanted burden , tries to adapt to the psychological abuse she receives , but she is the object of frequent quarrels and grows sad and depressed ( " Beautiful Emptiness " ) . She searches for quietness and strength in her inner fantasy world , and friendship and love on the internet , becoming ever more detached from the real world and eccentric in the eyes of her schoolmates and parents ( " Eccentric " , " Digital Deceit " , " Through Square Eyes " ) . The line of pain that connects the child to her parents appears indestructible and the situation gets worse when the father thinks of leaving ( " Blind Pain " , " Two Sides " ) . The intervention of the girl 's grandmother reveals that the father was himself a neglected child and a victim of his family ( " Victim of Choices " ) . The father 's anger is a reaction to his abuse as a child and this realization seems to soften the girl 's pain , bringing her out of her defensive shell ( " Reflections " ) . In conclusion , the grown @-@ up daughter , now a mother herself , faces the same dilemmas of her parents and is bound to repeat her parents ' mistakes , closing the invisible circle that endures from one generation to another ( " Life 's Vortex " ) . 
 = = Production = = 
 Sander Gommans started the composition of the basic melodies for Invisible Circles at the beginning of 2003 in his home studio in <unk> , working at the same time on new songs for the EP Exordium . This part of the creative process had been shared with Mark Jansen for the previous albums and it would be shared with keyboard player Joost van den Broek for the following ones . Gommans wrote the songs for the new album with the precise idea of pushing the music of the band closer to progressive metal , reducing the gothic atmospheres of the previous releases to a minimum and adopting as many different musical styles as he felt necessary to the convey the message of the songs . Meanwhile , his fiancée Floor Jansen was writing the lyrics and shaping the plot for the concept album . 
 The band reunited at Excess Studios in Rotterdam in July 2003 , a few weeks after recording Exordium , to arrange the new songs and to record the instrumental tracks , under supervision of producer Hans Pieters and sound engineer Dennis <unk> . Every member of the band contributed to the music , which is credited for the most part to all six musicians . When the instrumental tracks were ready , the band moved in August 2003 to Gate Studio in Wolfsburg , Germany , where all solo vocal parts were arranged by the band , under supervision of American singer and producer Amanda Somerville . She also contributed , along with Jay Lansford , the recited parts that connect the songs to each other and explain parts of the plot . The solo vocals of Jansen , Gommans and Bas Maas were recorded separately by producers Sascha Paeth and Michael “ Miro ” <unk> . Female soprano vocals , grunts and clean male vocals represent in the songs different feelings and behaviours of the characters . The final stage of the recording process was executed at Arts Music Recording studio in <unk> from 20 to 24 October 2003 , under supervision of Peter Arts . The orchestra and choir parts were arranged there by Cees ’ <unk> , who also contributed some additional keyboards to smooth the transition between the different instrumental parts . The final mixing of all the parts was executed by Sascha Paeth at The Pathway Studio in Wolfsburg , Germany in November and December 2003 , except the instrumental introduction " Childhood in Minor " mixed by Sander Gommans . The album was mastered at Sound Factory by Peter van ' t Riet for a release in early 2004 . 
 Invisible Circles was released by Transmission Records on 25 March 2004 . " Digital Deceit " was the only single issued from the album and released on 20 May 2004 . A high tech video clip was produced for the song by D <unk> , the same company that had done the video clip for the 2003 single " My Choice " , extracted from Exordium . The video was aired on Dutch MTV and on local musical TV stations .

 The artwork for the album was created by German designer Carsten Drescher and his graphics company Media Logistics . Drescher was responsible for the After Forever logo and the cover concepts of every After Forever album and single since then . The girl he photographed is in fact his daughter Aimee Drescher , who also appeared in the video clip for the song " Digital <unk> " . He inserted the photos in a dark urban landscape tinted blue , completing the front cover artwork with the digital overlay of circles in the water to evoke the title of the album . The same circles were extensively used in the CD booklet and in every other artwork related to the album . Together with the dominant blue colour the circles were also present in the live show scenography . 
 The photos of the band were taken by Dutch photographer Angelique van <unk> in November 2003 and each member dressed in a tight black and blue suit with a lightning motif , the same colors of the CD sleeve . The same suits were used for the video clip of the single " Digital Deceit " and sometimes appeared in live shows during the following tour . 
 = = Tour = = 
 The Invisible Circles tour started in February 2004 , just before the album release , in Mexico , home of the independent label Raw Metal Records , which distributed After Forever albums for all the American continent . An intensive European tour followed , touching the Netherlands , Germany and France . 
 Two months after the release of the album , keyboard player Lando van Gils left the band on amicable terms . He played his last gig with the band at The <unk> , Weert , on 14 May 2004 . He was replaced by keyboard player Joost van der Broek , coming from the Dutch progressive rock band Sun Caged , who completed the rest of the tour . Van den Broek had played with Floor Jansen during the Star One tour of 2002 , where he also met Gommans . The tour brought the band to play at the important Graspop , Pinkpop and Dynamo festivals in Belgium and the Netherlands . The Pinkpop Festival performance on 30 May 2004 , was televised for a Dutch TV station . The first leg of the tour culminated with the performance at the Wacken Open Air festival , on 7 August 2004 . 
 New dates of the tour were added at the end of the year , but some shows were cancelled when drummer André Borgman was admitted to a hospital and diagnosed with lung cancer at an initial stage . The official site of the band reported the news of Borgman ’ s illness and confirmed some shows , with Ayreon , Star One and <unk> drummer Ed <unk> standing @-@ in for Borgman . The band spent the first half of 2005 concentrating on the material for the new album <unk> , while Borgman received intensive treatment to cure his cancer . Luckily , the cures were successful and Borgman was back behind his drum kit for the final leg of the Invisible Circles tour in South America in August 2005 . 
 = = Critical and commercial reception = = 
 After the almost unanimous praise received by the album Decipher and the perplexities raised by the new musical direction of the EP Exordium , there were great expectations for the new album by fans and specialized press alike . The complexity of the music and concept of Invisible Circles produced mixed reviews , ranging from highest praise to complete failure , even in the same publication . The bold move of making a concept album about such a controversial matter was generally appreciated but , as Eduardo Rivadavia said in his AllMusic review , this could be a " slightly overambitious creation " . The Maximum Metal reviewer states that " concept albums are always hard to pull off and not many bands can do it well " and " here is another failed attempt " . It was the general opinion of most reviewers that Floor Jansen 's lead vocals are at her best and " her performance here is powerful , dramatic and very impressive overall , no matter how she chooses to sing " . However , her lyrics were sometimes considered a weak point of the album , despite the fact that the band " placed as much emphasis " on them " as they did on the music " . Sam Grant of Sonic Cathedral Webzine considered them " trite " and " disappointing " . In particular , the spoken dialogue by Somerville and Lansford was generally considered badly acted and detrimental to the music which , on the contrary , was generally considered the strong point of the album . The change of musical direction , with the introduction of progressive metal elements , and the many variations of style adopted in the songs were generally praised , to the point that a Metal Storm reviewer compares After Forever to " Symphony X with Floor Jansen on vocals " . Only a few reviewers remained nostalgic of the gothic and symphonic sound of Decipher and denounced a " lack of direction " and " too much confusion " in the music of the album . 
 The album sold enough in the Benelux to remain in the Dutch Mega Album Top 100 chart for eleven weeks and in the Belgian Ultratop 50 Albums chart for two . 
 It reached position No. 24 in the Netherlands and position No. 74 in Belgium . The single " Digital Deceit " reached position No. 41 in the Single Top 100 chart in the Netherlands .

 = Halifax Central Library = 
 The Halifax Central Library is a public library in Halifax , Nova Scotia on the corner of Spring Garden Road and Queen Street . It serves as the flagship library of the Halifax Public Libraries , replacing the Spring Garden Road Memorial Library . 
 A new central library was discussed by library administrators for several decades and approved by the regional council in 2008 . The architects , a joint venture between local firm Fowler Bauld and Mitchell and Schmidt Hammer Lassen of Denmark , were chosen in 2010 through an international design competition . Construction began later that year on a prominent downtown site that had been a parking lot for half a century . 
 The new library opened in December 2014 and has become a highly popular gathering place . In addition to a book collection significantly larger than that of the former library , the new building houses a wide range of amenities including cafés , an auditorium , and community rooms . The striking architecture is characterised by the fifth floor 's cantilever over the entrance plaza , a central atrium criss @-@ crossed by staircases , and the building 's transparency and relationship to the urban context . The library won a Lieutenant Governor ’ s Design Award in Architecture for 2014 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Planning = = = 
 The Spring Garden Road main library , opened in 1951 , had been considered inadequate by library administrators for several decades . The first report mentioning a replacement building was published in 1971 . An expansion built in 1974 was quickly outgrown . A 1987 assessment noted that the spaces within were " self @-@ contained and inflexible " and that " study space and comfortable reading areas are presently the focus of serious public complaint ... services are cramped and over crowded . " 
 In the mid @-@ 1990s the municipalities of Halifax , Dartmouth , Bedford , and Halifax County were amalgamated , and a new regional library board was created . In 1995 , the Joint Amalgamation Committee of the merged libraries " agreed that a new central library would be needed to serve the new Halifax Regional Library system and that the site should remain in the present downtown area . " They cited numerous problems with the original building . In addition to its small size ( 3 @,@ 594 square metres [ 38 @,@ 690 sq ft ] ) , technological improvements were hampered by poor wiring and difficulty laying cable in mid @-@ floor locations . Accessibility was poor due to the numerous stairs , levels , and an undersized elevator . Other problems with the building included leaks , asbestos , inoperable windows , the lack of a sprinkler system , inadequate climate control , ceilings as low as 1 @.@ 95 m ( 6 ft 5 in ) , and the lack of numerous services found at other modern libraries . 
 Following the merger , the new library board undertook extensive planning for a new facility in the hope that a new central library might be part of the 1999 commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the city . The library board commissioned an architectural study , released in 1997 , recommending a new central library of approximately 8 @,@ 800 square metres ( 95 @,@ 000 sq ft ) after concluding a renovation of the existing library would " not result in significant cost savings " and would lead to a less efficient building . Furthermore , it recommended building the new library on a different site in order to avoid costly temporary relocation . This study considered six different sites for the new library and recommended the lot at Queen and Clyde Streets , then a municipal parking lot . The projected cost of construction was just short of $ 24 million at 1997 prices . 
 The recommendation for a new library was echoed in a 2004 needs assessment and master plan study for the overall library system . The central library was identified as the " first priority " for the library board in terms of capital development , with implementation recommended by 2009 . The study found agreement among survey respondents that the library should be located in downtown Halifax , being the core of the region and an anticipated area of growth in the regional plan . 
 Following the 2004 demolition of the nearby former Halifax Infirmary , planning and public consultation began , as part of the Spring Garden Road & Queen Street Joint Public Lands Study , in order to determine the future of the glut of vacant public lands in the area . The lot directly on this prime intersection was closely considered as the site of either a new central library or a justice centre , consolidating other courthouse facilities around the city . The site had been occupied by Bellevue House , the army commandant 's house from the 19th century until it was demolished in 1955 . It had then remained a parking lot into the 21st century . In June 2007 , regional council voted to approve " in principle , designation of the property at the corner of Spring Garden Road and Queen Street as the site of the Central Library " and to initiate negotiations for the acquisition of that land from the province . These negotiations , concluded in January 2010 , resulted in a land swap : the municipality acquired the Queen and Spring Garden site from the province in exchange for the former Queen Elizabeth High School and Birk 's ( Barrington and George streets ) lands , plus $ 1 @.@ 9 million " in recognition of the higher value of the provincially owned land . " 
 On 12 August 2008 , regional council voted to approve the library project in principle and direct municipal staff to develop a financial plan for the project . On 28 April 2009 , the council passed a motion to advance the library as a project under the Building Canada Fund , a federal fund that financed projects jointly with local governments from 2007 to 2014 . This resulted in an $ 18 @.@ 3 million contribution from the federal government . 
 = = = Architect selection and public consultations = = = 
 The architects for the new library were chosen through an international competition for a design contract worth C $ 4 @.@ 3 million . Four architectural teams were shortlisted , each a partnership between a local and a non @-@ local firm . The winning scheme , a joint venture by Danish firm Schmidt Hammer Lassen and Fowler Bauld & Mitchell of Halifax , was selected in March 2010 . The other shortlisted teams were Lydon Lynch with HOK , Barrie and <unk> with Moriyama and <unk> , and Shore <unk> Irwin + Partners with John K. Dobbs . 
 The library governance stated they sought to " involve as many people as possible in the public consultation process for the new central library . " It was suggested in The Coast , a weekly newspaper , that this emphasis on public involvement was a reaction to a negative public response toward a proposed redesign of Point Pleasant Park after its partial destruction in Hurricane Juan . Early planning was undertaken in three public consultation phases during 2008 . Five more public meetings and workshops were held in 2010 following the selection of the design architects . The final design was unveiled by the architects during the fifth of these meetings on 4 November 2010 . A final public event was held at Pier 21 on 14 November 2012 . 
 = = = War memorial issue = = = 
 The Spring Garden Road Memorial Library was named after its status as a war memorial and displays several commemorative artefacts , including two Books of Remembrance containing the names of thousands of Halifax County residents who gave their lives in the First World War , Second World War , and Korean War . A page is turned in each book every Remembrance Day . A Silver Cross is also on display . The building contains a plaque reading , " This building was erected in memory of those who gave their lives in defence of their Country , 1914 – 1918 ; 1939 – 1945 . For their Faith , for their Courage , for their Sacrifice , We Will Remember Them . " 
 Some residents voiced concern that with the closure of the former building the war memorial will effectively disappear . Local author and historian Blair Beed questioned why the term " memorial " was not carried over to the new building , and proposed that " Halifax Memorial Library " would be a more appropriate name lest wartime sacrifices be pushed aside and forgotten . He also worried about the fate of the historical artefacts on display . Another resident suggested that such concerns were not given serious consideration during the public consultation process . 
 Library management responded that the war commemoration would be incorporated into the local history section of the library , and that the two remembrance books would be joined by a third recognizing those who died in conflicts following the Korean War . They also stated that a " few elements of the existing wartime display such as the Silver Cross , flags and standards " would be transferred to the Maritime Command Museum at Admiralty House , CFB Halifax . The three Books of Remembrance are now on display in a glass case next to the local history room . 
 = = = Construction and opening = = = 
 Before construction began , an archaeological dig was undertaken to evaluate the remains of Bellevue House . The land was originally purchased in 1800 by the Duke of Kent , who was based in the city in order to command British forces in North America . Subsequent British commanders took residence in the house , built 1801 and described as an " almost palatial residence " that hosted members of the Royal Family during visits to the colony . It was destroyed in a 1885 fire , but rebuilt . The British left in the early 20th century and the structure was demolished after it was acquired by the Nova Scotia Technical College in 1955 . The site then remained a parking lot for over half a century , meaning the foundation of older structures was preserved under the asphalt . This stands in contrast to the site of the former infirmary next door , where the deep foundation rendered the site archaeologically insignificant . In addition to the foundation of the residence , the archaeological dig uncovered numerous small artefacts including china , cutlery and an 1860 Nova Scotia penny . 
 Construction of the library by <unk> began shortly thereafter . Following excavation and blasting for the underground car park , the foundation was poured in 2012 . In May 2014 , the library hosted a tour for journalists and officials from all levels of government . Halifax mayor Mike Savage stated that the new library is " not simply something that ’ s nice to have . It is important and critical to the future of our city . Because more than ever , for a city to succeed , we need to be invested in the knowledge economy . We need to ensure that our citizens have access to all forms of learning . ” 
 The total cost of the building was $ 57 @.@ 6 million , of which $ 18 @.@ 3 million came from the federal government via the Building Canada Fund , $ 13 million from the provincial government , and the remainder ( $ 26 @.@ 3 million ) from the municipality . The municipal contribution was primarily generated from the sale of the empty lots around the library site . 
 The library was completed in late 2014 following the transfer of materials from the former library across the street , which closed on 30 August . It opened to the public on Saturday , 13 December 2014 to an estimated 12 @,@ 000 visitors who enjoyed a day of performances and festivities . The first six weeks of operation saw 272 @,@ 000 visitors , who collectively checked out over 167 @,@ 700 items . 
 = = Design and reception = = 
 The library is a five @-@ storey structure comprising about 11 @,@ 000 square metres ( 120 @,@ 000 sq ft ) of space , and was designed to accommodate a book collection 50 per cent larger than that of the former Spring Garden Memorial Library . A <unk> atrium , criss @-@ crossed by stairs and walkways , spans the interior height of the structure . The main lobby and children 's collection are concentrated on the lower floors , while much of the upper floors are designated as quiet areas . A rooftop terrace with seating offers a broad view of Downtown , the South End , and Halifax Harbour . 
 The design , said to resemble a stack of books , has garnered international attention and was featured by CNN as one of ten " eye @-@ popping " new buildings of 2014 . The building topped a list of " high @-@ design libraries " compiled by <unk> and was covered on numerous architecture websites . In the 2014 " Best of Halifax " awards , ranked annually by readers of The Coast , the library was voted the " Best Thing To Happen In Halifax In The Past Year " and the " Best Effort To Improve Halifax " . SNC @-@ Lavalin , the structural and civil engineer , was awarded the " Engineering a Better Canada Award " by the Association of Canadian Engineering Companies for their work on the library . The building was also shortlisted for the World Building of the Year Award in the Civic and Community category at the 2015 World Architecture Festival in Singapore . 
 The Nova Scotia Association of Architects selected the library to receive the Award of Merit at the Lieutenant Governor ’ s Design Awards in Architecture . The award was presented in 2015 by Brigadier @-@ General J.J. Grant . The awards jury commented : " Without doubt , the new Halifax Central Library has done more to transform the discussion of contemporary architecture in Halifax than any building in the past 40 years . The Halifax Central Library was a real catalyst of local , public and architectural conversation in Halifax ; its program and location has reconstructed the way locals and visitors interact with a building filled with knowledge . " 
 An architect from Fowler , Bauld & Mitchell stated that the library now sees an average of 6 @,@ 000 visitors daily , a " huge increase " in patronage over the former Spring Garden Road Memorial Library .

 The library 's open design and central location enables it to host community events and festivals .

It hosted the Duke of Edinburgh 's Award ceremony in November 2015 attended by Prince Edward .

 The building houses two café spaces , one at ground level and one on the fifth floor . Patrons of the latter café have access to a rooftop patio area as well as the " Halifax Living Room " housed in the cantilevered portion of the building overlooking Spring Garden Road . The Living Room was designed as an airy , indoor public space with views of both Citadel Hill and Halifax Harbour as well as the civic square below . The ground floor café , in the corner of the building nearest the intersection , opens earlier than the rest of the library . The concession to operate from both spaces was won by Pavia Gallery Espresso Bar and Café of Herring Cove , who beat out Second Cup and Uncommon Grounds . Pavia holds a ten @-@ year contract with an option for an additional seven years . 
 The ground floor space is the " main café " with the same offerings as Pavia 's Herring Cove location , while the smaller upstairs café serves light refreshments only . Pavia plans to hold three art @-@ related panel discussions at the library each year .

 <unk> , who also worked as a curator at the former Technical University of Nova Scotia next door ( now Dalhousie University 's School of Architecture and Planning ) , ended up producing a total of 6 @,@ 000 paintings divided into two installations . At the ground floor , Library Cards comprises 5 @,@ 000 paintings behind the main reception . A further 1 @,@ 000 paintings , " eye @-@ popping , two @-@ colour abstracts of books leaning against each other " , decorate the Living Room in the fifth floor cantilever . This smaller installation is titled Book Shelf Paintings . 
 The Library Cards paintings cover a variety of themes and subjects , including landscapes , portraits , abstract pieces , and musings on history and libraries . The artist joked , " there are grey landscapes to remind you about why you stay indoors in Nova Scotia to read " and said that portraits of staff at the Spring Garden Road and Halifax North Memorial libraries , photographed by Mary Ann Archibald , were painted and had subsequently been recognized by some of their subjects . He also stated that the library commission is the biggest installation he has done to date .

 The ground floor houses a 300 @-@ seat auditorium which also serves as a reading space when not in use for performances . Library CEO Judith Hare stated that the space would complement a recording studio , geared toward young people , planned elsewhere in the library : " people can make their own music ... but also they ’ ll have a place to perform as well . " In 2012 the auditorium was named Paul O ’ Regan Hall following a $ 1 million donation by the O ’ Regan family in honour of the late businessman and philanthropist . Government funding only covered the cost of the building , so donations will go toward expanding the book collection and purchasing new computers and special equipment . The hall is fitted with <unk> seats , acoustic ceiling baffles , a video screen , and professional sound and lighting installations . 
 The hall boasts a $ 62 @,@ 000 Yamaha grand piano donated by local philanthropist and musician Peggy <unk> in May 2015 .

 = Bombardment of Papeete = 
 The Bombardment of Papeete occurred in French Polynesia when German warships attacked on 22 September 1914 , during World War I. The German armoured cruisers SMS Scharnhorst and Gneisenau entered the port of Papeete on the island of Tahiti and sank the French gunboat Zélée and freighter Walkure before bombarding the town 's fortifications . French shore batteries and a gunboat resisted the German intrusion , but were greatly outgunned . The main German objective was to seize the coal piles stored on the island , but these were destroyed by the French at the start of the action . 
 The German vessels were largely undamaged but the French lost their gunboat . Several of Papeete 's buildings were destroyed and the town 's economy was severely disrupted . The main strategic consequence of the engagement was the disclosure of the cruisers ' positions to the British Admiralty , which led to the Battle of Coronel where the entire German East Asia Squadron defeated a Royal Navy squadron . The depletion of Scharnhorst 's and Gneisenau 's ammunition at Papeete also contributed to their subsequent destruction at the Battle of the Falklands . 
 = = Background = = 
 Word of war reached Admiral Maximilian von Spee — of the German East Asia Squadron — while at Ponape ( 17 July – 6 August ) . He concentrated the majority of his squadron at Pagan Island in the nearby Mariana Islands , and then steamed off into the Pacific with the Scharnhorst @-@ class armored cruisers SMS Scharnhorst and Gneisenau , the Königsberg @-@ class light cruiser SMS Nürnberg , the auxiliary cruiser SMS Titania , and several colliers at his disposal . Nürnberg and Titania were sent to gather intelligence at Hawaii and raid the cable station at Fanning Island . Von Spee then learned that Australian and New Zealand forces had captured German Samoa , and he sailed off in his flagship Scharnhorst — along with her sister ship Gneisenau — to engage what Allied forces they could find there . Failing to catch the Samoa Expeditionary Force at Apia and having seen no action at all since leaving Pagan Island , the men of Admiral von Spee 's armored cruisers were eager to meet the enemy in battle . 
 Von Spee decided to raid Papeete in Tahiti on his way to rendezvous with the rest of his squadron at Easter Island . The French held over 5 @,@ 000 t ( 5 @,@ 500 short tons ) of high @-@ quality Cardiff coal at the port , and von Spee hoped to seize the coal piles to replenish his squadron 's supply . Additionally , von Spee aimed at destroying what allied shipping he could find in the harbour , and thought the raid might help raise his men 's morale . Von Spee intended to coal at Suwarrow Atoll before sailing to Papeete , but was prevented by foul weather . Instead , von Spee decided to take Scharnhorst and Gneisenau and attempt to resupply at Bora Bora while Nürnberg and Titania were dispatched to <unk> to guard the fleet 's colliers . The German admiral intended to keep his vessels ' identities secret by disguising them as French ships , flying French flags , and only allowing French- and English @-@ speaking members of his crew contact with the Frenchmen present there . Von Spee managed to replenish his food stores using gold seized by Titania and Nürnberg during their raid of Fanning , and was able to discover the strength of the French military in the region as well as the exact size and positions of the coal piles at Papeete . 
 The French had no heavy defenses at Papeete but had been warned that von Spee 's squadron might raid Tahiti and that a German squadron had been sighted off Samoa . Although Papeete was the capital of the French Settlements in Oceania , by 1914 it had become a colonial backwater , lacking a wireless station and having a garrison of only 25 colonial infantry and 20 gendarmes . In order to bolster the town 's defenses , Lieutenant Maxime Destremau — commander of the old wooden gunboat Zélée and the ranking officer at Papeete — had his ship 's 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) stern gun and all of her 65 mm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) and 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) guns removed from his vessel and placed ashore to be used in place of Papeete 's antiquated land batteries . Several Ford trucks were turned into impromptu armored cars by mounting them with Zélée 's 37 @-@ mm guns and 160 sailors and marines drilled in preparation to repel any German attempt at landing . Zélée retained only her 100 @-@ mm bow gun and 10 men under the ship 's second in command . In addition to the gunboat and harbor fortifications , the French also had at Papeete the unarmed German freighter Walkure , which had been captured by Zélée at the start of the war . Despite the French preparations , the two German cruisers were more than a match for the forces Destremau commanded at Papeete . Both Scharnhorst and Gneisenau heavily outgunned Zélée , each being armed with eight 210 mm ( 8 @.@ 3 in ) guns , six 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) guns , eighteen 88 mm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) guns , and four torpedo tubes . Von Spee 's forces also outnumbered the French with over 1 @,@ 500 sailors aboard their vessels , more than enough to form a landing party and overwhelm the forces Destremau had to oppose them . 
 = = Battle = = 
 At 07 : 00 on 22 September 1914 , the French sighted two unidentified cruisers approaching the harbor of Papeete . The alarm was raised , the harbor 's signal beacons destroyed , and three warning shots were fired by the French batteries to signal the approaching cruisers that they must identify themselves . The cruisers replied with a shot of their own and raised the German colors , signaling the town to surrender . The French refused the German demands , and von Spee 's vessels began to shell the shore batteries and town from a distance of 6 @,@ 000 m ( 6 @,@ 600 yd ) . The land batteries and the gunboat in the harbor returned fire , but scored no hits on the armored cruisers . Having difficulty in discovering the exact position of the French batteries , the German cruisers soon turned their attention to the French shipping in the harbor . 
 The French commander — Destremau — had ordered the coal piles burned at the start of the action and now smoke began billowing over the town . Zélée and Walkure were sighted and fired upon by the Germans . The French had begun to scuttle their vessels when the action had begun , but both were still afloat when Scharnhorst and Gneisenau began firing upon them and finished the two ships off . By now , most of the Papeete 's inhabitants had fled and the town had caught fire from the German shelling , with two blocks of Papeete set alight . With the coal piles destroyed and the threat of mines in the harbor , von Spee saw no meaningful purpose in making a landing . Accordingly , the German admiral withdrew his ships from Papeete 's harbor by 11 : 00 . After leaving Papeete , the ships steamed out towards Nuku <unk> to meet Nürnberg , Titania , and colliers waiting there . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 By the time von Spee withdrew his ships , large portions of the town had been destroyed . Two entire blocks of Papeete had burnt to the ground before the fires were finally put out . A copra store , a market , and several other buildings and residences were among those destroyed by the shellfire and resulting inferno . While the majority of Papeete 's civilians fled to the interior of the island as soon as the fighting began , a Japanese civilian and a Polynesian boy were both killed by German shellfire . Although the two French vessels in the harbor had been sunk , there were no military casualties on either side and the German vessels took no damage . Overall , the bombardment was estimated in 1915 to have caused over 2 million francs ' worth of property damage , some of which was recouped through the seizure of a German store on the island . In addition to the seizure of their property , several local Germans were interned and forced to repair the damage von Spee 's squadron had caused . Perhaps the most lasting effect of the bombardment on the French was the dramatic fall of copra prices in the region , as local suppliers had previously sold a majority of their produce to German merchants in the area who were now interned . Further havoc and distress spread throughout the island 18 days after von Spee 's squadron had left , when rumors started to spread that a second German bombardment was about to begin . 
 After withdrawing , Scharnhorst and Gneisenau rendezvoused with Nürnberg and Titania at Nuku <unk> , where they resupplied and their crews took shore leave before moving on to meet the rest of the squadron at Easter Island . Although the Germans had destroyed the shipping at Papeete and wreaked havoc in the town , they had been denied their primary objective of seizing the French coal piles and replenishing their own stocks . Von Spee 's raid allowed the British Admiralty to receive word on his position and heading , allowing them to inform Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock of the German intentions thus leading to the Battle of Coronel . Another effect was the reduction of ammunition available to the two German cruisers . The hundreds of shells fired by von Spee 's ships at Papeete were irreplaceable . The depletion of ammunition as a result of the action at Papeete contributed to the German East Asia Squadron 's failure to adequately defend itself at the Battle of the Falkland Islands against British battlecruisers . Lieutenant Destremau was chastised by his misinformed superior officer for his actions during the defense of Papeete and for the loss of the gunboat Zélée . He was summoned back to Toulon under arrest to be court @-@ martialled , but died of illness in 1915 before the trial . In 1918 , Destremau was finally recognized for his actions at Papeete and was posthumously awarded the Légion d 'honneur . 
 = Forbes Field = 
 Forbes Field was a baseball park in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , from 1909 to June 28 , 1970 . It was the third home of the Pittsburgh Pirates Major League Baseball ( MLB ) team , and the first home of the Pittsburgh Steelers , the city 's National Football League ( NFL ) franchise . The stadium also served as the home football field for the University of Pittsburgh " Pitt " Panthers from 1909 to 1924 . The stadium was named after British general John Forbes , who fought in the French and Indian War , and named the city in 1758 . 
 The US $ 1 million ( $ 26 @.@ 3 million today ) project was initiated by Pittsburgh Pirates ' owner Barney Dreyfuss , with the goal of replacing his franchise 's then @-@ current home , Exposition Park . The stadium was made of concrete and steel ( one of the first of its kind ) in order to increase its lifespan . The Pirates opened Forbes Field on June 30 , 1909 against the Chicago Cubs , and would play the final game that was also against the Cubs on June 28 , 1970 . The field itself featured a large playing surface , with the batting cage placed in the deepest part of center field during games . Seating was altered multiple times throughout the stadium 's life ; at times fans were permitted to sit on the grass in the outfield during overflow crowds . The Pirates won three World Series while at Forbes Field and the other original tenant , the Pittsburgh Panthers football team had five undefeated seasons before moving in 1924 . 
 Some remnants of the ballpark still stand , surrounded by the campus of the University of Pittsburgh . Fans gather on the site annually on the anniversary of Bill Mazeroski 's World Series winning home run , in what author Jim O 'Brien writes is " one of the most unique expressions of a love of the game to be found in a major league city " .

 In 1903 , Pittsburgh Pirates ' owner Barney Dreyfuss began to look for ground to build a larger capacity replacement for the team 's then @-@ current home , Exposition Park . Dreyfuss purchased seven acres of land near the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh , adjacent to Schenley Park , with assistance from his friend , industrialist Andrew Carnegie . The low @-@ priced land was selected so Dreyfuss could spend more on the stadium itself . Dreyfuss signed a contract that he would " make the ballpark ... of a design that would harmonize with the other structures in the Schenley Park district . " The site was initially labeled " Dreyfuss 's Folly " due to its long distance — a 10 @-@ minute trolley ride — from downtown Pittsburgh , but the land around the park developed and criticisms were dropped . Official Pirates ' records show that Forbes Field cost US $ 1 million for site acquisition and construction , however some estimates place the cost at twice that amount . 
 Dreyfuss announced that unlike established wooden ballparks such as the Polo Grounds , he would build a three @-@ tiered stadium out of steel and concrete to increase longevity — the first of its kind in the nation . Charles <unk> Leavitt , Jr. was contracted to design the stadium 's grandstand . A civil engineer , Leavitt had founded an engineering and landscape architecture firm in 1897 . He had gained experience in steel and concrete constructs while designing the Belmont and Saratoga racetracks . Based on Dreyfuss ' architectural requirements , Leavitt presented a plan for Forbes Field — the only ballpark he would design . Pirates ' manager Fred Clarke also had input into the stadium 's design , giving groundskeepers advice on the field , in addition to designing and patenting a device to spread and remove a canvas tarpaulin over the infield in case of rain . 
 Initial work on the land began on January 1 , 1909 , but ground was not officially broken until March 1 . Nicola Building Company built the stadium in 122 days and play began less than four months after ground was broken , on June 30 . Though the scoreboard was operated by hand , the ballpark featured multiple innovations such as ramps and elevators to assist fan movement throughout the park , a room for the umpires , and a visiting team clubhouse similar to the Pirates ' . The facade of the stadium featured " buff @-@ colored terra cotta " spelling out " PAC " for the Pittsburgh Athletic Company . The light green steelwork contrasted with the red slate of the roof . Some members of the press urged Dreyfuss to name the stadium after himself . However , the owner decided on Forbes Field , in honor of General John Forbes , who captured Fort Duquesne from the French in 1758 and rebuilt a new " Fort Pitt " at the site . In 1935 , after Dreyfuss ' death , there was renewed media interest in renaming the stadium " Dreyfuss Field " . His widow , Florence , resisted . However , a monument to Dreyfuss was placed in center field just in front of the wall . 
 = = = Opening = = = 
 On June 29 , 1909 , the Pittsburgh Pirates defeated the Chicago Cubs , 8 – 1 at Exposition Park . The two teams opened Forbes Field the following day . Fans began to arrive at the stadium six and one @-@ half hours early for the 3 : 30 pm game . The game started at 3 : 30 p.m. Weather conditions were reported as clear skies with a temperature around 80 ° . Of the crowd , the Pittsburgh Press wrote , " the ceremonies were witnessed by the largest throng that ever attended an event of this kind in this or any other city in the country ... Forbes Field is so immense — so far beyond anything else in America in the way of a baseball park — that old experts , accustomed to judging crowds at a glance , were at a loss for reasonable figures . " Records show that the first game was attended by a standing @-@ room only crowd of 30 @,@ 338 . Various National League officials and owners were present for the opening pre @-@ game ceremonies , including league president Harry Pulliam , Civil War veteran and manager of Pittsburgh 's first professional baseball team Al Pratt , and American League president Ban Johnson . Pittsburgh Mayor William A. Magee threw out the stadium 's ceremonial first pitch . The Chicago Cubs won the first game , 3 – 2 . Dreyfuss declared , " This is indeed the happiest day of my life . " The stadium was widely considered the best in the league . 
 It is more accurate to say Mayor Magee threw out the first ball . He was in the second tier and threw the ball to John M. Morin , Director of Public Safety , on the field below . Morin then went to the mound and threw the first pitch to the Pirate catcher . 
 Pictures depict the flag at Forbes Field at half staff on opening day . This occurred to honor recently deceased presidents of the Philadelphia Phillies and the Boston Doves . 
 The first batter at Forbes Field was future Hall of Famer Johnny Evers , the Cubs second baseman and lead off batter . He was hit by a pitch and later in the inning scored the first run . The first hit by a Pirate was by catcher George Gibson , who eventually became a Pirate manager . 
 = = = Playing field = = = 
 Barney Dreyfuss " hated cheap home runs and vowed he 'd have none in his park " , which led him to design a large playing field for Forbes Field . The original distances to the outfield fence in left , center , and right field were 360 feet ( 110 m ) , 462 feet ( 141 m ) and 376 feet ( 115 m ) , respectively . 
 In 1925 , the right field grandstand was extended into the corner and into fair territory , reducing the foul line distance from 376 feet ( 115 m ) to 300 feet ( 91 m ) . Due to the reduced distance , Dreyfuss erected a 28 @-@ foot ( 8 @.@ 5 m ) high screen to limit home runs . 
 Even at this long distance from home plate , the wall stood 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) in height all around the field , with the right field wall reduced to 9 @.@ 5 feet ( 2 @.@ 9 m ) following the 1925 construction ( topped by the screen ) . The backstop was set at 110 feet ( 34 m ) behind home plate , larger than the average of 60 feet ( 18 m ) in most stadiums of the time . Additional seating eventually cut down the plate @-@ to @-@ screen distance to a still larger @-@ than @-@ average 75 feet ( 23 m ) . 
 With such a large outfield space , triples and inside @-@ the @-@ park home runs were common . The Pirates hit a record eight triples in a single game , on May 30 , 1925 . Conversely , the stadium was one of the most difficult to hit over @-@ the @-@ fence home runs . The closeness of the right field line from 1925 onward was the only area that compromised Dreyfuss ' original design concept . Even at that , the right field wall angled sharply out to 375 feet ( 114 m ) , a typical distance for a major league power alley . The final three home runs of Babe Ruth 's career were hit in Forbes Field on May 25 , 1935 ; the third of these cleared the 89 @-@ foot ( 27 m ) right field roof and was considered the longest home run in the park 's history . 
 Although Forbes Field developed a reputation as a " pitcher @-@ friendly " ballpark , there was never a no @-@ hitter thrown in the more than 4 @,@ 700 games at the stadium . 
 The field itself consisted of natural grass grown in Crestline , Ohio . 
 The batting cage was placed just to the left of the 457 @-@ foot ( 139 m ) center field " Death Valley " marker during games , because it was believed impossible to hit the ball that far . The open part of the cage faced the wall , the back of the cage effectively serving as a convex fence . In right- and left @-@ center fields , light towers stood on the field , and like the batting cage and flagpole in center field , were in @-@ play . 
 In 1947 , well after Dreyfuss ' death , and upon the arrival of veteran slugger Hank Greenberg , the bullpens were moved from foul territory to the base of the scoreboard in left field and were fenced in , cutting 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) from the left field area , from 365 feet ( 111 m ) to 335 feet ( 102 m ) down the line and 406 feet ( 124 m ) to 376 feet ( 115 m ) in left @-@ center field . These were not abnormal major league outfield distances , but the obvious attempt to take advantage of Greenberg 's bat led the media to dub the area " Greenberg Gardens " . Greenberg retired after the season , but by then Ralph Kiner was an established slugger with the Pirates , and the bullpen was redubbed " Kiner 's Korner " . Kiner was traded after the 1953 season , and the field was restored to its previous configuration in time for the 1954 season . 
 The final posted dimensions of the ballpark were left field line 365 feet ( 111 m ) , left @-@ center field 406 feet ( 124 m ) , deepest left @-@ center 457 feet ( 139 m ) , deep right @-@ center 436 feet ( 133 m ) , right @-@ center field 375 feet ( 114 m ) , and right field line 300 feet ( 91 m ) . The only marker in exact straightaway center field was the Barney Dreyfuss monument , which sat on the playing field just in front of the wall . 
 Forbes Field 's ivy @-@ covered walls featured no advertising , except a 32 @-@ foot ( 9 @.@ 8 m ) United States Marine Corps billboard during the 1943 season . 
 The infield developed a " rock @-@ hard " surface throughout the stadium 's history . During the final game of the 1960 World Series , Yankees shortstop Tony Kubek was struck in the neck with a ball that bounced off the hard dirt surface , breaking up a potentially rally @-@ killing double play and causing Kubek to exit the game . Pittsburgh went on to win the game and the championship . <unk> burned gasoline on the mound to dry it off . Because of the bounces , Pirates ' play @-@ by @-@ play announcer Bob Prince nicknamed the ballpark , The House of Thrills . 
 = = = Seating and tickets = = = 
 Forbes Field had an original capacity of 25 @,@ 000 , the largest in the league at the time . Seating at the stadium was remodeled numerous times , peaking at a capacity of 41 @,@ 000 in 1925 and closing in 1970 at 35 @,@ 000 seats . On opening day , ticket prices ranged from $ 1 @.@ 25 ( equal to $ 32 @.@ 92 today ) for box seats and $ 1 ( equal to $ 26 @.@ 34 today ) for reserved grand stand sections ; temporary bleachers were set up for the occasion and cost $ 0 @.@ 50 . Ticket prices were considered high for the day and steel pillars supporting the roof occasionally blocked fans ' views of the field . 2 @,@ 000 bleachers were situated along the left field side , tickets were sold for a maximum of $ 1 . When winning streaks would attract high attendance to games , fans were permitted to sit on the grass in right field , provided they would agree to allow a player to catch any ball hit in the area . The lowest season of attendance came in 1914 when 139 @,@ 620 people attended games ; the highest at the stadium came in 1960 , when 1 @,@ 705 @,@ 828 people watched the Pirates play . On September 23 , 1956 , the stadium 's largest crowd , 44 @,@ 932 , gathered to see the home team play the Brooklyn Dodgers . The game was cut short in the top of the ninth inning , after a rain delay forced it past the Pennsylvania Sunday curfew . The Dodgers won the game 8 – 2 the following day .

 Though Forbes Field was praised upon its opening , it began to show its age after 60 years of use . The park was the second oldest baseball field in the league at the time – only Shibe Park in Philadelphia was older ( it too was replaced in 1971 by Veterans Stadium ) . The location of the park , which was initially criticized for not being developed , grew into a " bustling business district " which led to a lack of parking space . One sportswriter wrote that The House of Thrills had become " as joyless as a prison exercise yard " . Following a plan to expand their adjacent campus , the University of Pittsburgh purchased Forbes Field in 1958 , with an agreement to lease the stadium to the Pirates until a replacement could be built . A proposal for a new sports stadium in Pittsburgh was first made in 1948 , but plans did not attract much attention until the late 1950s . Construction began on Three Rivers Stadium on April 25 , 1968 . The Pittsburgh Pirates and the Chicago Cubs played a double @-@ header on June 28 , 1970 . Pittsburgh won the first game 3 – 2 . In the later game Al Oliver hit the last home run in the park , and Matty Alou drove in two runs as the Pirates closed the 62 @-@ year @-@ old stadium with a 4 – 1 victory . The 40 @,@ 918 spectators in attendance stood and cheered as Dave Giusti retired Willie Smith for the final out at the stadium . Pirates Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente played 15 seasons at Forbes Field . He was emotional during the last game saying , " I spent half my life there . " After the game , home plate was dug up and taken by helicopter to Three Rivers Stadium to be installed in the artificial turf . 
 A community group attempted to rescue the structure from demolition , proposing such things as a stage , apartments and a farmers market for the site and comparing it to the Eiffel Tower in significance . 
 The abandoned structure suffered two separate fires that damaged the park , on December 24 , 1970 and July 17 , 1971 . 11 days after the second fire , demolition began , and the site was cleared for use by the University of Pittsburgh .

 In 1955 , a statue of Honus Wagner was dedicated in Schenley Plaza adjacent to Forbes Field . Several thousand fans attended the dedication as well as Wagner himself . His failing health caused him to never leave his open convertible in which he arrived ( Wagner died near the end of that year ) . The 1 @,@ 800 pound statue was moved to Three Rivers Stadium in 1970 . Today , the statue stands at the home plate entrance of PNC Park . 
 The portion of the left field wall over which Bill Mazeroski hit his walk @-@ off home run to end the 1960 World Series , between the scoreboard and the " 406 FT " sign , no longer stands at its original location . A portion of that wall , including the distance marker , had been sliced off and moved to the Allegheny Club at Three Rivers Stadium . Before the Three Rivers demolition , the section of the wall was salvaged , and in 2009 it was restored and placed on the Riverwalk outside of PNC Park . 
 Meanwhile , the original location of that wall is outlined by bricks extending from the left @-@ center field wall across Roberto Clemente Drive and into the sidewalk . A plaque embedded in the sidewalk marks the spot where Mazeroski 's home run cleared the wall . The left @-@ center and center field brick wall with " 457 FT " and " 436 FT " painted on it still stands at its original location , along with the stadium 's flagpole , adjacent to the University of Pittsburgh 's Mervis and <unk> Halls . Despite not technically being the correct section of wall where Mazeroski 's famous home run cleared , it is often locally referred to as " Mazeroski 's Wall . " This portion of the wall remained after Forbes Field was torn down , and was refurbished in 2006 in time for the All @-@ Star Game hosted in Pittsburgh . In addition , a wooden replica of an entrance to the stadium , including a ticket window and players entrance , was constructed and placed near the remaining wall in 2006 . The home plate used in the stadium 's final game remains preserved in the University of Pittsburgh 's <unk> Hall . However , its location has been altered ; author John McCollister wrote , " Had architects placed home plate in its precise spot about half of the Pirates fans could not view it . The reason : it would have to be on display in the fifth stall of the ladies ' restroom . " However , the original location of the home plate has been more recently determined by others to be approximately 81 feet away from its current display , just inside the <unk> / Economics Library , and not in a restroom as has been popularly believed . 
 A ceremony is held each October 13 at the outfield wall in Oakland to listen to a taped broadcast of the final game of the 1960 World Series . The tradition was started by Squirrel Hill resident Saul Finkelstein , who at 1 : 05 pm on October 13 , 1985 , sat alone at the base of the flagpole and listened to the NBC radio broadcast of Chuck Thompson and Jack Quinlan . Finkelstein continued the tradition for eight more years , until word spread and other people began attending in 1993 . On October 13 , 2000 — the game 's 40th anniversary — over 600 people attended to listen to the broadcast , including Mazeroski himself . For the 50th anniversary , on October 13 , 2010 , a plaque honoring Mazeroski was dedicated and more than 1 @,@ 000 attended the broadcast , including Mazeroski and several other former Pirates .

 In 1925 , the Pirates became the first team to come back from a three @-@ game to one deficit to defeat the Washington Senators and win the World Series . Pittsburgh 's third and final World Series championship while they played at Forbes Field came in 1960 . Bill Mazeroski hit the first home run to end a World Series and as of 2015 , the only walk @-@ off home run in World Series Game 7 history . 
 Two unassisted triple plays were turned at Forbes Field . The first took place on May 7 , 1925 , when Pittsburgh 's Glenn Wright achieved the feat . Two seasons later , in 1927 , Jimmy Cooney — who had been a victim of the first triple play — also acquired three outs by himself . 
 On May 25 , 1935 , at Forbes Field , Babe Ruth hit the last three home runs of his career as his Boston Braves lost to the Pirates , 11 @-@ 7 . His last home run cleared the right field stands roofline , making him the first player to ever do so .

 The Homestead Grays of the Negro leagues played all home games at Forbes Field from 1922 to 1939 . Grays owner Cumberland Posey became friends with Dreyfuss , who rarely missed a Grays game . In 1930 , Josh Gibson made his premiere for the Grays at Forbes Field . Also in 1930 , the Grays and the Kansas City Monarchs played the first baseball game at night in Pittsburgh on July 18 , 1930 . A crowd of over 15 @,@ 000 was expected . Floodlights were installed the day before the game after they were transported from Cleveland , where the Grays and Monarchs had played on July 16 . Six members of the Grays ' 1936 team have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame . Beginning in 1937 , the Grays won nine consecutive Negro National League championships .

 The University of Pittsburgh 's football team moved from Exposition Park into Forbes Field upon its opening in 1909 and played there until 1924 when it moved into the larger Pitt Stadium only a few blocks away . In their first game at Forbes Field on October 16 , 1909 , the Panthers defeated Bucknell University 18 – 6 . In 1910 , Pitt 's second year at Forbes Field , the Panthers went undefeated without allowing a single point . The Panthers had several successful seasons while playing at Forbes Field , including five in which they went undefeated and were awarded national championship titles in 1910 , 1915 , 1916 , 1917 , and 1918 . During their years at Forbes Field , Pitt 's teams were led by Hall of Fame coaches Joe Thompson , Glenn " Pop " Warner and Jock Sutherland .

 = Mark Stimson = 
 Mark Nicholas Stimson ( born 27 December 1967 ) is an English former footballer and is currently manager of Thurrock . He signed his first professional contract with Tottenham Hotspur in 1985 , but was unable to gain a regular place in the team . In 1989 , he moved on to Newcastle United , where he made over 80 appearances in the Football League . He later played for Portsmouth , Southend United and Leyton Orient before dropping into non @-@ League football . 
 He was appointed manager of Grays Athletic in 2002 and remained in charge until 2006 when he took over as manager of Stevenage Borough . He led Grays to victory in the Final of the FA Trophy in 2005 and 2006 , and repeated the feat with Stevenage in 2007 . In November 2007 , he became manager of a Football League team for the first time when he took over at one of his former clubs , Gillingham , but he was unable to prevent the club 's relegation from League One at the end of the 2007 – 08 season . He led Gillingham back into League One the following season via the League Two play @-@ off Final , but his contract was terminated after the team were relegated back to League Two the following season . On 1 June 2010 , Stimson was appointed as the new manager of League Two club Barnet , but he was sacked on New Year 's Day 2011 with the club near the bottom of the table . He later had a spell as manager with Conference club Kettering Town . 
 = = Playing career = = 
 Born in Plaistow in east London , Stimson played for the Essex county representative football team and was on the books of Queens Park Rangers , before joining Tottenham Hotspur on an apprenticeship in July 1984 . A year later , he signed his first professional contract , at the age of 17 . He made his Football League debut against Everton in May 1987 , but struggled to gain a place in the first team , and was sent to Leyton Orient on loan in March 1988 , where he played ten times . During the following season , he was loaned out again , this time to Gillingham , whose manager , Keith Burkinshaw , had worked with him at Tottenham . Stimson made 18 appearances for the Kent @-@ based club and , although he was unable to help the team avoid relegation from the Third Division , his contribution impressed the fans , who voted him into second place in the club 's player of the year ballot . 
 At the end of the 1988 – 89 season , Stimson was transferred to Newcastle United , then in the Second Division , for a fee of £ 200 @,@ 000 . He spent four years with the club and finally gained a regular first team place , making over 80 appearances . After Kevin Keegan took over as manager , however , Stimson found himself out of favour and he had a short spell on loan to Portsmouth in December 1992 , which led to a £ 100 @,@ 000 transfer at the end of that season . He made over fifty appearances for Portsmouth but was also loaned out again , this time to Barnet during the early part of the 1995 – 96 season . In March 1996 , he was transferred to Southend United for a fee of £ 25 @,@ 000 . His first season at the club was affected by a long lay @-@ off due to injury , meaning that he did not play between August and November , but he ultimately made over 50 Football League appearances for the club . During his time at Roots Hall the club suffered two consecutive relegations , dropping from the First Division into the Second Division in 1997 and from there into the Third Division in 1998 . In March 1999 , having not played for Southend since the previous November , he returned to former club Leyton Orient on a free transfer . He played for the club in the semi @-@ finals of the play @-@ offs , but was restricted to an appearance as an unused substitute in the final , which Orient lost . 
 Prior to the 1999 – 2000 season , Stimson spent a short period on trial at another of his former clubs , Gillingham , but manager Peter Taylor decided against offering him a contract and he instead joined Isthmian League club Canvey Island . He helped the " Gulls " win the FA Trophy in the 2000 – 01 season , setting up the only goal and winning the man of the match award in Canvey 's 1 – 0 defeat of Forest Green Rovers in the final . He was also selected to play for the England National Game XI , the national team for semi @-@ professional players , earning one cap against an equivalent team from the United States . He left Canvey in May 2002 to join Grays Athletic as player @-@ coach . 
 = = Managerial career = = 
 In September 2002 , Stimson took over as manager of Grays after the sacking of Craig Edwards , initially as caretaker manager , but after leading the team to its first victory of the season , he was quickly given the job on an ongoing basis . Despite the signing of a number of former top @-@ level players , such as Carl <unk> and Jason Dozzell , the team escaped relegation by only one point . The following season , however , boosted by a switch to full @-@ time professional status and helped by the goals of Freddy Eastwood , Grays finished in 6th place , sufficient to gain a place in the newly formed Conference South for the 2004 – 05 season . Grays won the Conference South at the first attempt by a margin of 23 points , thus achieving promotion to the Conference National , the top level of non @-@ league football , for the first time in their history . In the same season , Stimson also led Grays to the FA Trophy Final , where the team beat Hucknall Town in a penalty shoot @-@ out . Grays reached the FA Trophy Final again in the following season , and claimed a second successive win after a 2 – 0 victory over Woking at Upton Park . In the Conference , Grays finished in third place and qualified for the play @-@ offs for promotion to the Football League , but lost to Halifax Town in the semi @-@ finals . 
 Citing his disappointment at failing to gain promotion , Stimson resigned from his post at Grays on 16 May 2006 . He stated that at the time he had received no firm job offers from other clubs , and acknowledged that he was taking a gamble with his career , but said that if he was unable to find a new job as a manager he would move into youth coaching or open his own football school . He was linked with the managerial vacancy at League Two Peterborough United , but eventually took over as manager of Stevenage Borough on 28 May , and led the club to an eighth @-@ place finish in the Conference National in his first season in charge . Stevenage also defeated Stimson 's former club Grays to reach the FA Trophy final , and beat Kidderminster Harriers 3 – 2 at the new Wembley Stadium in the final , giving Stimson a third consecutive Trophy win as a manager . 
 In the early part of the 2007 – 08 season , speculation began to mount that Stimson would be approached to take over as manager of a Football League club , with Gillingham , Port Vale and Millwall all alleged to be interested in his services . He was offered a new contract by Stevenage on 16 October 2007 , but resigned the following day . On 1 November , he was appointed as the new manager of Gillingham , and quickly moved to sign a number of Stevenage players , including Adam Miller and John Nutter . He was unable to recreate his previous success , however , and at the end of the 2007 – 08 season Gillingham were relegated from League One . He was also criticised by departing player Aaron Brown , who acknowledged that Stimson had strong coaching skills but described his man @-@ management as " shocking " . The following season the Gills finished fifth in League Two and beat Shrewsbury Town 1 – 0 in the play @-@ off Final at Wembley Stadium to gain promotion , but in the 2009 – 10 season Gillingham were relegated back to League Two , after which Stimson 's contract was terminated " by mutual consent " on 10 May 2010 . 
 On 1 June , Stimson was appointed as the new manager of League Two club Barnet , but was sacked seven months later on 1 January 2011 due to a bad string of results which left the club near the bottom of the table . Towards the latter stages of the 2010 – 11 season , Stimson accepted a coaching role at Dagenham & Redbridge . After a brief spell at Dagenham , he was appointed manager of Conference National club Kettering Town on 7 September 2011 . On 4 January 2012 , Stimson left Kettering with the team placed in the Conference relegation places . Four months later he was appointed manager of Thurrock following the club 's relegation to the Isthmian League .

 James Stephen " Steve " Fossett ( April 22 , 1944 – c . September 3 , 2007 ) was an American businessman and a record @-@ setting aviator , sailor , and adventurer . He was the first person to fly solo nonstop around the world in a balloon . He made his fortune in the financial services industry and was best known for many world records , including five nonstop circumnavigations of the Earth : as a long @-@ distance solo balloonist , as a sailor , and as a solo flight fixed @-@ wing aircraft pilot . 
 A fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and the Explorers Club , Fossett set more than a hundred records in five different sports , sixty of which still stood at the time of his death . 
 Fossett disappeared on September 3 , 2007 , while flying a light aircraft over the Great Basin Desert , between Nevada and California . Extensive searches proved unsuccessful , and he was declared legally dead in February of the following year . 
 In September 2008 , a hiker found Fossett 's identification cards in the Sierra Nevada Mountains , California , leading shortly after to the discovery of the plane 's wreckage . Fossett 's only remains , two large bones presumably scattered by wild animals , were found half a mile from the crash site . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Fossett was born in Jackson , Tennessee and grew up in Garden Grove , California , where he graduated from Garden Grove High School . 
 Fossett 's interest in adventure began early . As a Boy Scout , he grew up climbing the mountains of California , beginning with the San Jacinto Mountains . " When I was 12 years old I climbed my first mountain , and I just kept going , taking on more diverse and grander projects . " Fossett said that he did not have a natural gift for athletics or team sports , so he focused on activities that required persistence and endurance . His father , an Eagle Scout , encouraged Fossett to pursue these types of adventures and encouraged him to become involved with the Boy Scouts early . He became an active member of Troop 170 in Orange , California . At age 13 , Fossett earned the Boy Scouts ' highest rank of Eagle Scout . He was a Vigil Honor member of the Order of the Arrow , the Boy Scouts ' honor society , where he served as lodge chief . He also worked as a Ranger at Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico during the summer of 1961 . Fossett said in 2006 that Scouting was the most important activity of his youth . 
 In college at Stanford University , Fossett was already known as an adventurer ; his Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity brothers convinced him to swim to Alcatraz and raise a banner that read " Beat Cal " on the wall of the prison , closed two years previously . He made the swim , but was thwarted by a security guard when he arrived . While at Stanford , Fossett was a student body officer and served as the president of a few clubs . In 1966 , Fossett graduated from Stanford with a degree in economics . Fossett spent the following summer in Europe climbing mountains and swimming the Dardanelles . 
 = = Business career = = 
 In 1968 , Fossett received an MBA from the Olin School of Business at Washington University in St. Louis , Missouri , where he was later a longtime member of the Board of Trustees . Fossett 's first job out of business school was with IBM ; he then served as a consultant for Deloitte and Touche , and later accepted a job with Marshall Field 's . Fossett later said , " For the first five years of my business career , I was distracted by being in computer systems , and then I became interested in financial markets . That 's where I thrived . " 
 Fossett then became a successful commodities salesman in Chicago , first for Merrill Lynch in 1973 , where he proved a highly successful producer of commission revenue for himself and that firm . He began working in 1976 for Drexel Burnham , which assigned him one of its memberships on the Chicago Board of Trade and permitted him to market the services of the firm from a phone on the floor of that exchange . In 1980 , Fossett began the process that eventually produced his enduring prosperity : renting exchange memberships to would @-@ be floor traders , first on the Chicago Board Options Exchange . 
 After fifteen years of working for other companies , Fossett founded his own firms , Marathon Securities and Lakota Trading , from which he made millions renting exchange memberships . He founded Lakota Trading for that purpose in 1980 . In the early 1980s , he founded Marathon Securities and extended that successful formula to memberships on the New York stock exchanges . He earned millions renting floor trading privileges ( exchange memberships ) to hopeful new floor traders , who would also pay clearing fees to Fossett 's clearing firms in proportion to the trading activity of those renting the memberships . In 1997 , the trading volume of its rented memberships was larger than any other clearing firm on the Chicago exchange . Lakota Trading replicated that same business plan on many exchanges in the United States and also in London . Fossett would later use those revenues to finance his adventures . Fossett said , " As a floor trader , I was very aggressive and worked hard . Those same traits help me in adventure sports . " 
 Fossett said he did not participate in any of the " interesting things " he had done in college during his time in exchange @-@ related activities : " There was a period of time where I wasn 't doing anything except working for a living . I became very frustrated with that and finally made up my mind to start getting back into things . " He began to take six weeks a year off to spend time on sports and moved to Beaver Creek , Colorado in 1990 . Fossett later sold most of his business interests , although he maintained an office in Chicago until 2006 .

 In 1968 Fossett married Peggy Fossett ( née <unk> ) , who was originally from Richmond Heights , Missouri . They had no children . The <unk> had homes in Beaver Creek , Colorado and Chicago , and a vacation home in Carmel , California . 
 Fossett became well known in the United Kingdom for his friendship with billionaire Richard Branson , whose Virgin Group sponsored some of Fossett 's adventures .

 Steve Fossett was well known for his world records and adventures in balloons , sailboats , gliders , and powered aircraft . He was an aviator of exceptional breadth of experience . He wanted to become the first person to achieve a solo balloon flight around the world ( finally succeeding on his sixth attempt , in 2002 , becoming the first person to complete an uninterrupted and unrefueled solo circumnavigation of the world in any kind of aircraft ) . He set , with co @-@ pilot Terry <unk> , 10 of the 21 Glider Open records , including the first 2 @,@ 000 km Out @-@ and @-@ Return , the first 1 @,@ 500 km Triangle and the longest Straight Distance flights . His achievements as a jet pilot in a Cessna Citation X include records for U.S. Transcontinental , Australia Transcontinental , and Round @-@ the @-@ World westbound non @-@ supersonic flights . Prior to Fossett 's aviation records , no pilot had held world records in more than one class of aircraft ; Fossett held them in four classes . 
 In 2005 Fossett made the first solo , nonstop unrefueled circumnavigation of the world in an airplane , in 67 hours in the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer , a single @-@ engine jet aircraft . 
 In 2006 , he again circumnavigated the globe nonstop and unrefueled in 76 hours , 45 minutes in the GlobalFlyer , setting the record for the longest flight by any aircraft in history with a distance of 25 @,@ 766 statute miles ( 41 @,@ 467 km ) . 
 He set 91 aviation world records ratified by Fédération Aéronautique Internationale , of which 36 stand , plus 23 sailing world records ratified by the World Sailing Speed Record Council . 
 On August 29 , 2006 , he set the world altitude record for gliders over El <unk> , Argentina at 15 @,@ 460 metres ( 50 @,@ 720 ft ) .

 On February 21 , 1995 , Fossett landed in Leader , Saskatchewan , Canada , after taking off from South Korea , becoming the first person to make a solo flight across the Pacific Ocean in a balloon . 
 In 2002 , he became the first person to fly around the world alone , nonstop in any kind of aircraft . He launched the 10 @-@ story high balloon Spirit of Freedom from Northam , Western Australia on June 19 , 2002 and returned to Australia on July 3 , 2002 , subsequently landing in Queensland . Duration and distance of this solo balloon flight was 13 days , 8 hours , 33 minutes ( 14 days 19 hours 50 minutes to landing ) , 20 @,@ 626 @.@ 48 statute miles ( 33 @,@ 195 @.@ 10 km ) . The balloon dragged him along the ground for 20 minutes at the end of the flight . The control center for the mission was in Brookings Hall at Washington University in St. Louis . Fossett 's top speed during the flight was 186 miles per hour ( 299 km / h ) over the Indian Ocean . Only the capsule survived the landing ; it was taken to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , DC , where it was displayed . The trip set a number of records for ballooning : Fastest ( 200 miles per hour ( 320 km / h ) , breaking his own previous record of 166 miles per hour ( 270 km / h ) ) , Fastest Around the World ( 13 @.@ 5 days ) , Longest Distance Flown Solo in a Balloon ( 20 @,@ 482 @.@ 26 miles ( 32 @,@ 963 @.@ 00 km ) ) , and 24 @-@ Hour Balloon Distance ( 3 @,@ 186 @.@ 80 miles ( 5 @,@ 128 @.@ 66 km ) on July 1 ) . 
 While Fossett had financed five previous tries himself , his successful record @-@ setting flight was sponsored by Bud Light . In the end , Fossett actually made money on all his balloon flights . He bought a contingency insurance policy for $ 500 @,@ 000 that would pay him $ 3 million if he succeeded in the flight . Along with sponsorship , that payout meant that in the end Fossett did not have to spend any of his money other than for initial expenses .

His average speed of 342 @.@ 2 mph ( 550 @.@ 7 km / h ) was also the absolute world record for " speed around the world , nonstop and non @-@ refueled . " His aircraft , the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer , had a carbon fiber reinforced plastic airframe with a single Williams <unk> turbofan engine .

The fuel fraction , the weight of the fuel divided by the weight of the aircraft at take @-@ off , was 83 percent . 
 On February 11 , 2006 , Fossett set the absolute world record for " distance without landing " by flying from the Kennedy Space Center , Florida , around the world eastbound , then upon returning to Florida continuing across the Atlantic a second time to land in Bournemouth , England . The official distance was 25 @,@ 766 statute miles ( 41 @,@ 467 km ) and the duration was 76 hours 45 minutes .

 Fossett and co @-@ pilot Einar Enevoldson flew a glider into the stratosphere on August 29 , 2006 . The flight set the Absolute Altitude Record for gliders at 15 @,@ 460 metres ( 50 @,@ 720 ft ) . Since the glider cockpit was unpressurized , the pilots wore full pressure suits ( similar to space suits ) so that they would be able to fly to altitudes above 45 @,@ 000 feet ( 14 @,@ 000 m ) . Fossett and Enevoldson had made previous attempts in three countries over a period of five years before finally succeeding with this record flight . This endeavor is known as the <unk> Project .

 As a young adventurer , Fossett was one of the first participants in the Worldloppet , a series of cross country ski marathons around the world . While he had little experience as a skier , he was in the first group of ' citizen athletes ' to participate in the series debut in 1979 . And in 1980 , he became the eighth skier to complete all 10 of the long distance races , earning a Worldloppet medallion . He has also set cross @-@ country skiing records in Colorado , setting an Aspen to Vail record of 59 h , 53 min , 30 s in February 1998 , and an Aspen to Eagle record of 12 hr , 29 min in February 2001 .

 Fossett was a lifelong mountain climber and had climbed the highest peaks on six of the seven continents . In the 1980s , he became friends with Patrick Morrow , who was attempting to climb the highest peaks on all seven continents for the " Seven Summits " world record , which Morrow achieved in 1985 . Fossett accompanied Morrow for his last three peaks , including Vinson Massif in Antarctica , Carstensz Pyramid in Oceania , and Elbrus in Europe . While Fossett went on to climb almost all of the Seven Summits peaks himself , he declined to climb Mount Everest in 1992 due to asthma . He later returned to Antarctica to climb again .

 Fossett competed in and completed premier endurance sports events , including the 1 @,@ 165 @-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 875 km ) Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race , in which he finished 47th on his second try in 1992 after training for five years . He became the 270th person to swim across the English Channel on his fourth try in September 1985 with a time of 22 hours , 15 minutes . Although Fossett said he was not a good enough swimmer " to make the varsity swim team " , he found that he could swim for long periods . Fossett competed in the Ironman Triathlon in Hawaii ( finishing in 1996 in 15 : 53 : 10 ) , the Boston Marathon , and the Leadville Trail 100 , a 100 @-@ mile ( 160 km ) Colorado ultramarathon which involves running up elevations of more than 14 @,@ 000 feet ( 4 @,@ 300 m ) in the Rocky Mountains . 
 Fossett raced cars in the mid @-@ 1970s and later returned to the sport in the 1990s . He competed in the 24 hours of Le Mans road race in 1993 and in 1996 , along with the Paris to Dakar Rally . 
 = = = Previous attempts at records = = = 
 Fossett tried six times over seven years for the first solo balloon circumnavigation . His fifth attempt cost him $ 1 @.@ 25 million of his own money ; his sixth and successful attempt was commercially sponsored . Two of the attempts were launched from Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis , Missouri . Washington University in St. Louis served as control center for four of the six flights , including the record @-@ breaking one . 
 In 1998 , one of the unsuccessful attempts at the ballooning record ended with a five @-@ mile ( 8 km ) plummet into the Coral Sea off the coast of Australia that nearly killed Fossett ; he waited 72 hours to be rescued , at a cost of $ 500 @,@ 000 . The first attempt began in the Black Hills of South Dakota and ended outside Hampton , New Brunswick 1 @,@ 800 miles ( 2 @,@ 900 km ) later . The second attempt , launched from Busch Stadium , cost $ 300 @,@ 000 and lasted 9 @,@ 600 miles ( 15 @,@ 400 km ) before being downed halfway in a tree in India ; the trip set records at the time for duration and distance of flight ( with Fossett doubling his own previous record ) and was called Solo Spirit after Lindbergh 's Spirit of St. Louis . Fossett slept an average of two hours a night for the six @-@ day journey , conducted in below @-@ zero temperatures . After taking too much fuel to cross the Atlantic Ocean and circling Libya for 12 hours while officials decided whether or not to allow him into their airspace , Fossett did not have enough fuel to finish the flight . That year , Fossett flew farther for less money than better @-@ financed expeditions ( including one supported by Richard Branson ) in part due to his ability to fly in an unpressurized capsule , a result of his heavy physical training at high altitudes . The Solo Spirit capsule was put on display at the Smithsonian 's National Air and Space Museum across from the Apollo 11 command module . 
 = = Scouting = = 
 Fossett grew up in Garden Grove , California and earned the Eagle Scout award in 1957 . He credited his experience in Scouting as a foundation for much of his later success . " As a Scout , I learned how to set goals and achieve them , " he once said . " Being a Scout also taught me leadership at a young age when there are few opportunities to be a leader . Scouting values have remained with me throughout my life , in my business career , and now as I take on new challenges . " In his later years , he was described as a " legend " by fellow Scouts . As a national BSA volunteer , he served as Chairman of the Northern Tier High Adventure Committee , Chairman of the Venturing Committee , member of the Philmont Ranch Committee , and member of the National Advisory Council . He later became a member of the BSA National Executive Board , and in 2007 , Fossett succeeded Secretary of Defense Robert Gates as president of the National Eagle Scout Association . Fossett previously had served on the World Scout Committee . 
 Fossett was honored with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award in 1992 . In 1999 he received the Silver Buffalo Award , BSA 's highest recognition of service to youth . 
 = = Awards and honors = = 
 In 2002 , Fossett received aviation 's highest award , the Gold Medal of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale ( FAI ) and in July 2007 , he was inducted into the Aviation Hall of Fame . He was presented at the ceremony by Dick Rutan . 
 In 1997 , Fossett was inducted into the Balloon and Airship Hall of Fame . In February 2002 , Fossett was named America 's Rolex <unk> of the Year by the American Sailing Association at the New York Yacht Club . He was the oldest recipient of the award in its 41 @-@ year history , and the only recipient to fly himself to the ceremony in his own plane . 
 He received the Explorers Medal from the Explorers Club following his solo balloon circumnavigation . He was given the <unk> de Montgolfier by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale in 1996 . He received the Harmon Trophy , given annually " to the world 's outstanding aviator and aeronaut " , in 1998 and 2002 . He received the Grande Médaille of the Aéro @-@ Club de France , and the British Royal Aero Club 's Gold Medal in 2002 . He received the Order of Magellan and the French Republic 's Médaille de l <unk> in 2003 . 
 The Scaled Composites White Knight Two <unk> Spirit of Steve Fossett , was named in Fossett 's honor by his friend Richard Branson , in 2007 . Following his disappearance , Peggy Fossett and Dick Rutan accepted the Spread Wings Award in Steve Fossett 's behalf at the 2007 Spreading Wings Gala , Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum , Denver , Colorado .

 At 8 : 45 am on the morning of Monday , September 3 , 2007 ( Labor Day ) , Fossett took off in a single @-@ engine Super Decathlon light aircraft from the Flying @-@ M Ranch private airstrip ( 38 ° 36 ′ 13 ″ N 119 ° 00 ′ 11 ″ W ) , near Smith Valley , Nevada . 
 After failing to return , searches were launched about six hours later . The aircraft had tail number <unk> registered to the " Flying M Hunting Club , Inc . " There was no signal from the plane 's emergency locator transmitter ( ELT ) designed to be automatically activated in the event of a crash , but it was of an older type notorious for failing to operate after a crash . 
 It was first thought that Fossett may have also been wearing a Breitling Emergency watch with a manually operated ELT that had a range of up to 90 miles ( 140 km ) , but no signal was received from it . On September 13 , Fossett 's wife , Peggy , issued a statement clarifying that he owned such a watch but was not wearing it when he took off for the Labor Day flight . 
 Fossett took off with enough fuel for four to five hours of flight , according to spokesperson Major Cynthia S. Ryan , Public Information Officer with the Civil Air Patrol ( CAP ) . Searchers with CAP were told that Fossett had gone out for a short flight over favorite territory , possibly including the areas of Lucky Boy Pass and Walker Lake . At one point it was suggested that he might have been out scouting for potential sites to conduct a planned land speed run . A Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) spokesperson noted that Fossett apparently did not file a flight plan and was not required to do so . On the second day , Civil Air Patrol aircraft searched but found no trace of wreckage after initiating a complex and expanding search of what would later evolve into a nearly 20 @,@ 000 square miles ( 52 @,@ 000 km2 ) area of some of the most rugged terrain in North America . The search presented a severe challenge from the standpoint of safely flying hundreds of hours in very difficult conditions . On the first day of CAP searching , operations were suspended by mid @-@ day due to high winds , according to Ryan . By the fourth day , the CAP was using fourteen aircraft in the search effort , including one equipped with the ARCHER system that could automatically scan detailed imaging for a given signature of the missing aircraft . By September 10 , search crews had found eight previously uncharted crash sites , some of which were decades old , but none related to Fossett 's disappearance . The urgency of what was still regarded as a rescue mission meant that minimal immediate effort was made to identify the aircraft in the uncharted crash sites , although some had speculated that one could have belonged to Charles Clifford Ogle , missing since 1964 . All told , about two dozen aircraft were involved in the massive search , operating from the primary search base at Minden , Nevada , with a secondary search base located at Bishop , California . CAP searchers came from Wings across the United States , including Nevada , Utah , California , Arizona , New Mexico , Idaho , Oregon , Pennsylvania and Texas . 
 On September 7 , Google Inc. helped the search for the aviator through its connections to contractors that provide satellite imagery for its Google Earth software . Richard Branson , a British billionaire and friend of Fossett , said he and others were coordinating efforts with Google to see if any of the high @-@ resolution images might include Fossett 's aircraft . 
 On September 8 , the first of a series of new high @-@ resolution imagery from <unk> was made available via the Amazon Mechanical Turk beta website so that users could flag potential areas of interest for searching , in what is known as crowdsourcing . By September 11 , up to 50 @,@ 000 people had joined the effort , scrutinizing more than 300 @,@ 000 278 @-@ square @-@ foot squares of the imagery . Peter Cohen of Amazon believed that by September 11 , the entire search area had been covered at least once . Amazon 's search effort was shut down the week of October 29 , without any measurable success . Major Cynthia Ryan later said it had been more of a hindrance than a help . She said that persons purporting to have seen the aircraft on the Mechanical Turk or have special knowledge clogged her email during critical days of the search , and for even months afterward . Many of the ostensible sightings proved to be images of CAP aircraft flying search grids , or simply mistaken artifacts of old images . <unk> flooded the search base in Minden with predictions of where the aviator could be found . Ryan got the majority of these calls personally , often at her home , in the middle of the night . One man from Canada was particularly persistent with daily calls to Ryan , interfering with her press briefings . Ryan asked her Incident Commander to issue a cease and desist order , backed up by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police ( RCMP ) if necessary . Ryan noted that every message , letter , or phone call was taken seriously – which swamped the USAF specialists assigned the task of reviewing every one of them without regard to apparent plausibility . In retrospect , the crowdsource effort was " not ready for prime time , " according to Ryan . 
 On September 12 , survival experts speculated that Fossett was likely to be dead . 
 On September 17 , the Nevada Wing of the Civil Air Patrol said it was suspending all flights in connection with its search operations , but National Guard search flights , private search flights and ground searches continued . 
 The National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) began a preliminary investigation into the likely crash of the plane that Fossett was flying . The preliminary report originally stated that Fossett was " presumed fatally injured and the aircraft substantially damaged " , but was subsequently revised to remove that assumption . Fossett 's friend and fellow explorer , Sir Richard Branson , made similar public statements . 
 On September 19 , 2007 , authorities confirmed they would stop actively looking for Fossett in the Nevada Desert , but would keep air crews on standby to fly to possible crash sites . " Nobody is giving up on this man " , said department spokesman . " The search is going to continue . It 's just going to be scaled back " , he said . On September 30 it was announced that after further analysis of radar data from the day of his disappearance , ground teams and two aircraft had resumed the search . 
 On October 2 , 2007 , the Civil Air Patrol announced it had called off its search operation Ryan later noted that the search was the largest , most complex peacetime search for an individual in U.S. history . 
 On August 23 , 2008 , almost a year after Fossett went missing , twenty @-@ eight friends and admirers conducted a foot search based on new clues gathered by the team . That search concluded on September 10 . 
 = = = Search and rescue costs = = = 
 On May 1 , 2008 , the Las Vegas Review @-@ Journal attributed to Nevada State Governor Jim Gibbons 's spokesman , Ben Kieckhefer , the Governor 's decision to direct the state to charge Steve Fossett 's family for the $ 687 @,@ 000 expense of the search for Fossett . Kieckhefer later played that early report down , when he told the Tahoe Daily Tribune that Nevada did not intend to demand an involuntary payment from Fossett 's widow , but that such a payment would be voluntary : " We are going to request that they help offset some of these expenses , considering the scope of the search , the overall cost as well as our ongoing budget difficulties . " <unk> Barron Hilton , from whose ranch Fossett had departed on the day he went missing , had previously volunteered $ 200 @,@ 000 to help pay for the search costs . 
 In his later comments to the Tahoe Daily Tribune , Kieckhefer denied outright that a bill for the family was being prepared , and he said , " It will probably be in the form of a letter " , which Kieckhefer indicated would include a financial outline of the steps taken by the state , the associated costs , and a mention of the state 's ongoing budget difficulties . 
 Days prior to this announcement , state Emergency Management Director Frank Siracusa noted that " there is no precedent where government will go after people for costs just because they have money to pay for it . You get lost , and we look for you . It is a service your taxpayer dollars pay for " , although he conceded that legally any decision would rest with Gibbons . At an April 10 , 2008 Legislature 's Interim Finance Committee hearing , Siracusa indicated that he had hired an independent auditor to review costs incurred by the state in searching for Fossett , but added , " We are doing an audit but not because we are critical of anybody or suspect something was done wrong " . Chairman Morse <unk> queried Siracusa as to why , since they lacked funds , had the state not billed the Fossett family for its search costs , to which Siracusa did not directly respond . In his later interview with the Las Vegas Review @-@ Journal , he stated that his comments to the Committee may have given the false impression that he had hired an auditor for the purpose of later challenging the state 's financial burden incurred on its behalf by the National Guard during the search operation . Upon interview regarding reports that the state would seek payment , <unk> was recorded as stating that he was glad to hear steps were being taken to try to recoup some of the costs . 
 The Nevada search cost $ 1 @.@ 6 million , " the largest search and rescue effort ever conducted for a person within the U.S. " Jim Gibbons asked Fossett 's estate to shoulder $ 487 @,@ 000 but it declined , saying Fossett 's wife had already spent $ 1 million on private searching . 
 = = = Recovery of wreckage and remains = = = 
 On September 29 , 2008 , a hiker found three crumpled identification cards in the Eastern Sierra Nevada in California about 65 miles ( 100 km ) south ( 186 degrees ) of Fossett 's take @-@ off site . The items were confirmed as belonging to Fossett and included an FAA @-@ issued card , his Soaring Society of America membership card and $ 1 @,@ 005 in cash . 
 On October 1 , late in the day , air search teams spotted wreckage on the ground at coordinates 37 ° 40 ′ 2 @.@ 8 ″ N 119 ° 08 ′ 0 ″ W at an elevation of 10 @,@ 100 feet ( 3 @,@ 100 m ) and about 750 yards ( 690 m ) from where the personal items had been found . Later that evening the teams confirmed identification of the tail number of Fossett 's plane . The crash site is on a slope beneath the southwest side of a ridge line ( 600 feet ( 180 m ) lower than the top of the ridge ) in the Ansel Adams Wilderness in Madera County , California . Other named places near the crash site include Minaret Mine ( 2 @,@ 000 feet ( 600 m ) west ) , Emily Lake ( 0 @.@ 7 miles ( 1 @.@ 1 km ) northeast ) , Minaret Lake ( 1 @.@ 8 miles ( 2 @.@ 9 km ) west @-@ southwest ) , the Minaret peaks ( 3 miles ( 5 km ) west ) , Devils <unk> National Monument ( 4 @.@ 5 miles ( 7 @.@ 2 km ) southeast ) , and the town of Mammoth Lakes ( the nearest populated place , 9 miles ( 14 km ) east @-@ southeast ) . The site is 10 miles ( 16 km ) east of Yosemite National Park . 
 Over the next two days , ground searchers found four bone fragments that were about 2 by 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 5 by 4 cm ) in size . However , DNA tests subsequently showed that these fragments were not human . 
 On October 29 , search teams recovered two large human bones that they suspected might belong to Fossett . These bones were found 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) east of the crash site . Tennis shoes with animal bite marks on them were also recovered . On November 3 , California police coroners said that DNA profiling of the two bones by a California Department of Justice forensics laboratory confirmed a match to Fossett 's DNA . Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said Fossett would have died on impact in such a crash , and that it was not unusual for animals to drag remains away . 
 = = = NTSB report and findings = = = 
 On March 5 , 2009 , the NTSB issued its report and findings . It states that the plane crashed at an elevation of about 10 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) , 300 feet ( 90 m ) below the crest of the ridge . The elevation of peaks in the area exceeded 13 @,@ 000 feet ( 4 @,@ 000 m ) . However , the density altitude in the area at the time and place of the crash was estimated to be 12 @,@ 700 feet ( 3 @,@ 900 m ) . The aircraft , a tandem two @-@ seater , was nearly 30 years old and Fossett had flown approximately 40 hours in this type . The plane 's operating manual says that at an altitude of 13 @,@ 000 feet ( 4 @,@ 000 m ) the rate of climb would be 300 feet per minute ( about 1 @.@ 5 m / s ) . The NTSB report says that " a meteorologist from Salinas provided a numerical simulation of the conditions in the accident area using the WRF @-@ ARW ( Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting ) numerical model . At 0930 [ the approximate time of the crash ] the model displayed downdrafts in that area of approximately 300 feet per minute . " There was no evidence of equipment failure . The report stated that a postmortem examination of the skeletal fragments had been performed under the auspices of the Madera County Sheriff 's Department . The cause of death was determined to be multiple traumatic injuries . 
 On July 9 , 2009 , the NTSB declared the probable cause of the crash as " the pilot 's inadvertent encounter with downdrafts that exceeded the climb capability of the airplane . Contributing to the accident were the downdrafts , high density altitude , and mountainous terrain . "

In the show " arrests and other activities of interest are recited " ; it ended with a 30 @-@ second " thought for the day " . Cox had been refused equal @-@ time by the station " on the ground that the program is a public service feature . " The FCC upheld the complaint , deciding the content of the program was " determined by Sheriff Whiston and not by the station " and that remarks made by the sheriff were of an editorial nature . Whiston would go on to win the primary over Cox by about 300 votes . 
 The station 's coverage of the explosion at the Farmington Number 9 mine , which killed 78 , earned the station an the Associated Press Radio @-@ Television Association ( <unk> ) in early 1969 . The station earned another <unk> award for " Outstanding News Coverage " the following year . 
 Sister station WCLG @-@ FM began broadcasting on September 28 , 1974 . Also during 1974 , WCLG began a Top 40 format . Another change in format took place in 1978 , with middle of the road ( MOR ) music taking the place of Top 40 . WCLG became part of the NBC Radio Network on October 2 , 1978 . In 1979 , Bowers became the station 's general manager . 
 WCLG applied for another broadcasting power increase on November 4 , 1980 , to 2 @,@ 500 watts , but remained a daytime @-@ only station . The station added oldies to its MOR music format in 1983 . 
 In 1985 , WCLG switched formats to a soft adult contemporary playlist . On March 15 of that year , Freed Broadcasting Corporation sold WCLG @-@ FM and sister station WCLG to Bowers Broadcasting Corporation , owned by Garry Bowers , for $ 715 @,@ 000 . 
 The station changed formats again in 1988 , this time to classic hits . Two years later , WCLG began broadcasting during the nighttime with 44 watts of power , enough to cover the city of Morgantown . Another format change took place in 1991 , when the station switched to golden oldies using the " Pure Gold " format from Satellite Music Network ( now Cumulus Media Networks ) .

 The Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) rescinded the transfer @-@ of @-@ ownership application on October 21 , 2013 , after an objection by Joe Potter , Senior Vice President of IMG Sports .

" The co @-@ directors of West Virginia Radio Corporation , John and David <unk> , operate AJG Corporation as a trust for their descendents . 
 Potter 's complaint went on to say that " IMG was close to finalizing a contract to air WVU sports " but was " prevented by the terms of AJG 's purchase agreement " , which barred Bowers Broadcasting Corporation from " ' entering into any contract or agreement ' without the consent of AJG " . 
 West Virginia Radio Corporation previously held the rights to West Virginia University sports before losing them to IMG Sports . West Virginia Radio Corporation filed a lawsuit against West Virginia University and IMG Sports to retain the broadcast rights , which it lost in late August 2013 .

 Edward Elric is the youngest State Alchemist to be selected by the State Military of the country , receiving the title of " Fullmetal Alchemist " shortly thereafter from the military head , King Bradley . He and his younger brother , Alphonse , seek to obtain the legendary Philosopher 's Stone in order to restore their bodies after a disastrous failed attempt to bring their mother back to life through alchemy . Edward was born in a small town named Resembool , where he lived with Alphonse and his parents , Trisha Elric and Van Hohenheim . After Hohenheim left the family on a journey early in his sons ' lives , and Trisha died of an illness years later , the two young boys concentrated on studying alchemy in the hopes of bringing their mother back to life , and trained with a skilled alchemist named Izumi Curtis . They attempt to revive their mother and failed , costing Edward his left leg , and Alphonse his entire <unk> this first transmutation , Edward sees the Truth ( <unk> , <unk> ) , thus gaining great knowledge as well as the prodigious ability to perform transmutations just by clapping his hands together . Edward then performed a second transmutation , sacrificing his own right arm to bind Alphonse 's soul to a nearby suit of armor . In order to move with his lost limbs , Edward has had prosthetic " automail " limbs designed and implemented by his childhood friend , Winry Rockbell . Winry is often kept busy repairing Edward 's automail , as he regularly breaks and damages the machines during heavy bouts . As the series continues , the two progressively develop a romantic relationship , eventually confessing their feelings to each other by the series ' end . 
 Edward 's motivation stems from a love for his brother , Alphonse , whom he is desperately seeking to restore to human form after their mistake . He is extremely idealistic , and strongly believes in the alchemical concept of " Equivalent Exchange , " which states that every outcome requires an equal payment . Edward also behaves in a childish manner when confronted about his short height , tending to overreact to any negative comment regarding the subject , usually attacking people in a fit of rage . Unlike regular alchemists who use transmutation circles , Edward has the ability to create alchemical currents in his body simply by connecting his hands as a result of his failed human transmutation which gave him such trait . In addition to this , Edward is a formidable fighter as a result of his training with Izumi , who had extensively trained both brothers in martial arts . 
 During their search for the Stone , they become targets of Scar , a vengeful <unk> , and the immortal creatures known as the homunculi . When Edward and Alphonse discover that the homunculi and the Philosopher 's Stone are related , they work together with their comrades in order to find them . However , after the Elric brothers meet the homunculi 's creator , " Father , " they are forced to keep working with the military by high @-@ ranking officials who are secretly using their friends from Resembool as hostages . Unable to protect their friends , the Elrics travel to the northern area of the country in order to request help from General Olivier Mira Armstrong . Shortly after their arrival , the State Alchemist Solf J. Kimblee takes Winry to the north as a hostage , unknown to Winry , in order to force Edward to continue his work . When the brothers are ordered to capture Scar , they end up using his help to move Winry to a safe place . Upon their success , Edward learns when Father plans to make a human transmutation circle out of the entire country . Edward , Alphonse , and their allies thus unite in an effort to bring down Father . They make their way into the underground complex where Edward is to be used as a sacrifice for Father 's transmutation . While battling Father , Edward loses his automail arm , rendering him unable to perform alchemy . Alphonse transmutes his soul in order to restore Edward 's original flesh @-@ and @-@ blood arm . After defeating Father , Edward manages to restore Alphonse to his original body by sacrificing his own ability to use alchemy . Giving up on alchemy forever , they return to their hometown to live normal lives . Two years later , Edward decides to research alchemy by heading out west . In the epilogue he and Winry get married and have a son and daughter together .

As a result , Edward finds himself on the other side of the Gate , a parallel world , while Alphonse recovers his original body . Determined to return to Alphonse , Edward becomes involved in rocketry research in Germany , with the intention of using that technology to return to his home world .

 Author Hiromu Arakawa integrated several social problems into the plot , such as the way Edward and Alphonse live as brothers after the death of their mother , Trisha . She also looks at how the brothers help people all over the country to gain an understanding of the meaning of family . When describing the character 's personality , Arakawa comments that after his father 's departure from home and his mother 's death , Edward tried to replace the role of the man for the Elric family . As a result , Van Hohenheim 's reappearance caused a shocking and terrified reaction in the character . Arakawa has noted that Edward is one of her favorite characters from the series , although she denied having the same personality as him when one of her assistants mentioned it . 
 When comparing the two brothers during the time Alphonse obtained the ability to use alchemy without a circle like Edward , Arakawa stated nobody was better at alchemy as the two had different preferences in the same way as other alchemist appearing in the series . Although she claims she has not thought of the characters ' birthdates , Arakawa noted that she decided Edward 's birthdate during the series ' serialization . During a chapter in which it was mentioned that Edward was about to be 16 , winter was about to begin in Hokkaido , Arakawa 's birthplace , so it was decided Edward 's birthdate would be in winter . In a common slapstick gag from the series , Edward is often struck by Winry Rockbell 's wrench . While commenting that Edward has an ability easily dodge her , Arakawa comments that he gets hit on purpose as a result of his personality . The director of the first anime series , Seiji Mizushima , says that in the development of the story Edward " evolves and devolves " ; Mizushima comments that Edward is continuously overcoming inner struggles in order to determine how to grow up . The appearance of his automail in the anime is used to symbolize the intangibles of his character , making viewers note that Edward lost something important . 
 In a prototype from the series , Edward was an eighteen @-@ year @-@ old teenager travelling alongside his father whose soul sealed in a flying squirrel . Edward 's prototype had an average height , but retained his automail . In order to fit with the readers from the manga magazine Monthly Shonen Gangan , Edward 's traits were further modified , leaving his current one . His height was reduced in order to contrast with Alphonse 's huge armor . In the design of the character , Arakawa is often worried about not making his automail too bulky to avoid balancing it by increasing Edward 's muscles , making his appearance unsuitable for his age . She has also often drawn the character in full body length , but at one point noticed she made it too tall . As the manga continued serialization , Arakawa found that she drew Edward half naked several times even more than Alex Louis Armstrong who tends to show his torso . While stating that this was because she wanted to draw Edward 's automail , she commented that it was common for men to walk in underwear at their homes . 
 In the Japanese version of Fullmetal Alchemist 's anime adaptations , Edward has been voiced by Romi Park . In the English version , the role has been played by Vic Mignogna . Mignogna has stated that performing Edward may be his biggest voice acting achievement since fans do not compare him with Park , noting that their voices are not similar and that he did not plan to sound like her . Additionally , in the upcoming live @-@ action of the series , Edward will be portrayed by Ryosuke Yamada .

 Edward 's character is well received by manga readers ; in each of the popularity polls made by Monthly Shōnen Gangan he has ranked first . Edward also won the Twenty @-@ sixth Annual Animage Readers ' Poll , Anime Grand Prix , in the " Favorite Male Character " ; Romi Park , who voices Edward in Japanese , won in the " Favorite Seiyu " category . Edward maintained a high place in the next year 's poll in the same category . In the July 2009 issue of Newtype , Edward ranked at the top of the survey Male Character Rankings . In the August 2009 issue his rank changed to fourth . In a Newtype poll from March 2010 , Edward was voted as the fourth most popular male anime character from the 2000s .

He was also seventh in IGN 's 2009 Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time with writer Chris Mackenzie saying , " [ Edward ] and his kid brother Al make one of the best action @-@ comedy teams in recent memory " . In 2014 , IGN ranked him as the eighth greatest anime character of all time , saying that " In Edward we had a character who was truly multidimensional . He could be comedic and pull off wild takes and sight gags . He could be placed in the most tragic circumstances and portray the deepest kind of sadness . He could be a complete badass , but he could also be the nicest guy on the planet . " Several pieces of merchandise have been released in Edward 's likeness , including plush toys , action figures , and key @-@ chains . Vic Mignogna , who performs the voice of Edward in the English dub , was the winner in American Anime Awards in the category " Best Actor " for voicing Edward . 
 Several publications for manga , anime , and other pop culture media have provided both praise and criticism on Edward 's character . IGN writer Hilary Goldstein praises Edward as the perfect balance between the typical clever kid and the stubborn kid persona , explaining that this allows the character to " float between comical moments and underlying drama without seeming false . " Additionally , Melissa Harper from Anime News Network praises Edward 's facial expressions as some of the most humorous highlights of the series , including also the moments in which he reacts quite violently to comments about his small stature . They also praise him for not being a stereotypical shōnen character as it is noted that he has " very real skills , relationships , and personality " . Samuel Arbogast from T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews also comments that the interaction between the Elric brothers as they travel is interesting , and praises their humor scenes as they help to balance the dark parts of the series . Similarly , Mania Entertainment 's Jarred Pine liked the dynamic between the Elrics brothers as while Edward is often faced with following " dark paths " in the same way as villains with the series , he is always supported by Alphonse who makes sure he is okay . Judge Joel Pearce from DVD Verdict commented on Edward 's journey , considering it very complex morally because he is trying to do good within a morally questionable organization . Lydia <unk> listed Ed as one of the reasons she likes Fullmetal Alchemist , noting the progression of the character 's personality throughout the series , from simple maturity to a deeper sensitivity . The character was noted to go through a notable development in the manga after meeting his father by Holly Ellingwood from Active Anime as it made him decide to see the investigate from the human he and Alphonse created as children which led him to find a clue about how to recover his brother 's body . On the other hand , Maria Lin from Animefringe criticized Edward 's development in the first animated adaptation of Fullmetal Alchemist , as in the series ' finale he once again attempted to resurrect a human . 
 = Picardy Spaniel = 
 The Picardy Spaniel is a breed of dog developed in France for use as a gundog . It is related to the Blue Picardy Spaniel , and still has many similarities , but the Picardy Spaniel is the older of the two breeds . It is thought to be one of the two oldest continental spaniel breeds and was favoured by the French nobility , remaining popular for hunting after the French Revolution due to its weather resistant coat that enabled it to hunt in a variety of conditions and terrain . However its popularity waned following the influx of English hunting breeds in the early 20th century . Slightly smaller than an English Setter but larger than most of its spaniel cousins , it has no major health issues although as with many breeds with pendulous ears , it can be prone to ear infections . 
 = = History = = 
 The French Spaniel and the Picardy Spaniel are considered to be the two oldest continental breeds of spaniel . Both breeds are speculated to have stemmed from the Chien d ' <unk> described in the writings of Gaston Phoebus . Hunting during this period in France was one of the favourite sports of the nobility and the French type of Spaniel became the favourite hunting dog of the French Royalty . The breed can be seen in paintings dating from this period by artists Alexandre @-@ François <unk> and Jean @-@ Baptiste Oudry . They were also the first breed of dog to be admitted into salons . 
 The breed became more popular still following the French Revolution and the aftermath in which hunting was no longer restricted to the nobility . Although spread throughout France , a large concentration was located in the north west where the weather resistant coat of the breed made it ideal for the wooded and swampy conditions . During the early 19th century , British hunters crossed the channel to hunt in the grounds of north west France . The British brought their own hunting dogs , and this resulted in a change of preference as French hunters switched to English breeds and caused a major blow to the existence of the Picardy Spaniel . In addition the infusion of blood from the English Setter into the local spaniel population created the Blue Picardy Spaniel . 
 = = = Recognition = = = 
 The <unk> Picard Club was formed in 1921 and was merged with the Club of Blue Picardy Spaniel on 28 July 1937 . A further merger took place on 21 May 1980 when these clubs merged with the Pont @-@ Audemer Club to form the Club des <unk> <unk> , Bleus de Picardie & Pont Audemer . 
 The Picardy Spaniel is recognised by a variety of Kennel Clubs and associations including the North American Kennel Club , American Rare Breed Association , United Kennel Club , and the Fédération Cynologique Internationale . All four associations use the standard as set by the FCI .

 = U @-@ Drop Inn = 
 The U @-@ Drop Inn , also known as Tower Station and U @-@ Drop Inn and Tower Café , was built in 1936 in Shamrock , Texas along the historic Route 66 highway . Inspired by the image of a nail stuck in soil , the building was designed by J. C. Berry . An unusual example of art deco architecture applied to a gas station and restaurant , the building features two flared towers with geometric detailing , curvilinear massing , glazed ceramic tile walls , and neon light accents . It has traditionally held two separate business : " Tower Station " , a gas station on the western side , and the " U @-@ Drop Inn " , a café on the eastern side . Though it has passed hands several times in its history , the building has consistently housed the same types of businesses it was originally constructed for . 
 Once considered a beautiful and impressive example of Route 66 architecture in Texas , the U @-@ Drop Inn fell into disrepair with the decommissioning of Route 66 . It closed for business in the late 1990s . After it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in September 1997 , the building was purchased by the First National Bank of Shamrock , which then gave it to the city . Primarily funded by a US $ 1 @.@ 7 million federal grant , the city hired a firm specializing in historical renovation to restore the building to its original glory and adapt it into a museum , visitors ' center , gift shop , and the city 's chamber of commerce . In 2006 animated film Cars , the cartoon village of Radiator Springs was based on multiple real U.S. Route 66 landmarks from Peach Springs to Baxter Springs ; the U @-@ Drop Inn 's distinctive architecture appears as Ramone 's automotive body and paint shop . 
 On St. Patrick 's Day 2014 , a Tesla high power electric vehicle charging station , known commonly as a supercharger , was opened on site .

 Opened on April 1 , 1936 , the U @-@ Drop Inn was built by J.M. Tindall using a design created by his friend , John Nunn , who scratched the design on a patch of dirt in the driveway of a nearby motel . Tindall had Pampa architect J.C. Berry draw up the blueprints for the art deco structure , and construction began at the busy intersection of Route 66 and U.S. Route 83 . Nunn , whose family owned and ran the business , sponsored a contest to decide the name of the new building . An eight @-@ year @-@ old boy won a week 's worth of waitressing pay ( approximately $ 50 @.@ 00 at the time ) with his entry of " U @-@ Drop Inn " . In addition to a café , the building housed a gas station that sold Conoco brand fuel and a store . The store was never actually opened as a store , and became a ballroom and overflow dining area for the café . 
 When the business opened , the local newspaper called it " the most up @-@ to @-@ date edifice of its kind on U.S. Highway 66 between Oklahoma City and Amarillo " , with the café considered " the <unk> of the swank eating places " . At the time of opening , the U @-@ Drop was the only café within 100 miles ( 160 km ) of Shamrock , enjoying brisk business and becoming a successful establishment . Nunn sold the Inn after several years , but purchased it back in 1950 and renamed it Nunn 's Café . In 1957 , John Nunn died and his wife Bebe sold the café to Grace Brunner who again renamed it , this time to Tower Café , and added a Greyhound bus station . 
 = = = Decline = = = 
 After Nunn 's death , the building passed through the hands of a few more owners and the station sold gasoline from various other companies . In the 1970s , Fina took over the building , painting it red , white , and blue . In the early 1980s , James R. Tindall , Sr. purchased the building , the construction of which his father had originally financed , repainted it to its original colors , and changed the name back to the original name of U @-@ Drop Inn . In the mid @-@ 1990s , the building was repossessed by the bank and closed completely in 1997 . Up through its closing , the café at the U @-@ Drop was praised for its low @-@ priced and tasty " home cooking " . 
 With signing of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 , Route 66 fell into decline , with segments being bypassed via turnpikes and newer highways . With the opening of Interstate 40 , Shamrock became one of the bypassed towns and the U @-@ Drop Inn , which once served thousands of travelers fell into disrepair due to neglect . In 1984 , Route 66 was decommissioned by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials , seeming to seal the fate of the town and the U @-@ Drop Inn . In 1990 , several state and local historical associations began efforts to preserve the architectural landmarks along the old route , particularly the many derelict or abandoned motels .

 Called " one of the most impressive examples " of Route 66 architecture by the Texas Historical Commission , the U @-@ Drop Inn was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 18 , 1997 . In May 1999 , the First National Bank of Shamrock purchased the U @-@ Drop Inn , then gave it to the city of Shamrock . 
 The city of Shamrock began taking measures to revive the neglected structure as a tourist attraction . In 2000 , the city hired Phillips <unk> Associates of Dallas and <unk> , a firm specializing in historical preservation , to begin implementing a phased restoration plan . 
 The company adapted the old gas station and café to act as the community 's chamber of commerce and visitor center while preserving the building 's architectural features and historical authenticity . Old photographs and interviews with residents were used to aid the company in uncovering the buildings original details . They peeled away decades of paint layers and fabric to find the original interior and exterior colors . One of the more difficult aspects was in restoring the neon accents . While historical photographs showed where neon existed , they had all been taken during the daytime when the neon lights were off , making it difficult to determine what color the lights originally were . 
 The restoration also included turning the building into a museum of its own history , giving it the authentic appearance of a working 1940 gas station . With $ 1 @.@ 7 million in funding by the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century , the restoration was completed in July 2003 . 
 In May 2013 , the neon lighting of the restored U @-@ Drop Inn was damaged by a hailstorm ; the damaged elements were replaced by LEDs in February 2014 . The café will serve fountain drinks , coffee and floats in 2014 after many years with no food or beverage service . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 With its glazed brick , " zigzag " motif , strong vertical elements , and the decorative structure , particularly the metal " tulip " , the building is considered to be an excellent example of the Art Deco style . Art Deco was most commonly seen in large commercial and public buildings , so its use in a gas station and roadside restaurant was a rare sight . The U @-@ Drop is one of the few Art Deco cafés built in the 1930s , and it stands out architecturally from its peers , as most depression @-@ era cafés had simpler and similar wood @-@ frame and clapboard designs or followed the Streamline Moderne offshoot of Art Deco . 
 The original building was designed by John Nunn and architect J. C. Berry . The 1 @-@ story concrete and brick building has a modified rectangular layout with a flat roof . It features a flared tower over the gas station , and two canopies , one facing Route 66 and one facing Highway 83 over the front of the gas station office . In the rear , a second , shorter tower contained the restaurant . The main buildings were built of structural clay tile with terra @-@ cotta glazed brick . The two towers are clad in stucco with decorative green and gold glazed terra @-@ cotta tiles and cast concrete stepped forms . Designed to attract the attention of the passing motorists , the towers also feature geometric detailing , curvilinear massing , and are outlined with neon lighting added additional character and uniqueness to the building 's design . 
 Historically , the U @-@ Drop Inn held two separate businesses that shared a single interior wall . The west side , commonly called " Tower Station " " is dominated by a large four @-@ sided obelisk rising from the flat roof and topped by a metal " tulip " . " The tower displayed the station name , Conoco , in all capital letters on each side , with neon lighting on the corners . Vertical @-@ rubbed detailing goes along the base of both towers , as well as two canopies that extend south and west from the western tower . The posts of the canopies were originally encased in decorative glazed tile and vintage metal signs . Between the canopy posts are fuel islands designed to hold three fuel pumps each . 1960s @-@ vintage pumps are situated on the islands , with three on the western canopy and two on the southern . A chamfered corner separates the two canopies . Multiple @-@ pane windows surround the glass doors of the office station , as well as dominating much of the southern side of the building . Situated between the office and the café are two service station bays with roll @-@ up style overhead doors . 
 The east side of the building , commonly called the " U @-@ Drop Inn café " has a similarly designed , three @-@ sided , shorter version of the main tower . Mirroring the " Conoco " wording , it has " Café " written in the same green paint with drop shadowed lettering , and a small ornamental metal sphere perched at its top . Just below the tower , an outstretched metal and wooden sign , added in 1950 , displays the name of the building and points towards the recessed entrance . This side mirrors the tiled detail found in the station side , and once had a neon " starburst " around the sign and entryway . Inside the café , the eastern and southern interior walls are lined with booths . The northern wall holds two small restrooms , with the kitchen once located in the northeastern corner . On the southern wall , a recessed doorway flanked by large single @-@ paned windows led into the café 's main dining room . The building 's exterior is pained beige with dark green accents . On the northern facade , the original brick remains unpainted .

 = They Don 't Care About Us = 
 " They Don 't Care About Us " is the fourth single from Michael Jackson 's album HIStory : Past , Present and Future , Book I , released on March 31 , 1996 . The song remains one of the most controversial pieces Jackson ever composed . In the US , media scrutiny surrounding allegations of antisemitic lyrics were the catalyst for Jackson issuing multiple apologies and re @-@ recording the song with altered lyrics . The singer countered allegations of antisemitism , arguing that reviews had misinterpreted the context of the song , either unintentionally or deliberately . The song was also covered by Christian alternative metal band P.O.D. in 1998 as a bonus track on the special edition version of their album , The Fundamental Elements of Southtown . The album contains an uncensored version of the song . Christian stores removed the album when the special edition came out because of the controversial lyrics including " Jew me " and " Kike me . " 
 The song was accompanied by two music videos directed by Spike Lee . The first was shot in two locations in Brazil , in Pelourinho , the historic city centre of Salvador , and in a favela of Rio de Janeiro called Dona Marta , where the state authorities had tried to ban all production over fears the video would damage their image , the area and prospects of Rio de Janeiro staging the 2004 Olympics . Still , the residents of the area were happy to see the singer , hoping their problems would be made visible to a wider audience . The second video was shot in a prison and contained video footage of multiple references to human rights abuses . 
 Commercially , the song became a top ten hit in all European countries and number one in Germany for three weeks . In the US , radio stations were reluctant to play the controversial composition ; it , however , managed to peak at number 30 on the Billboard Hot 100 . 
 The song was remixed with parts of songs such as " Privacy " ( from the album Invincible ) and " Tabloid Junkie " , and released on the Immortal album , in November , 2011 . 
 The song was performed during Jackson 's third and final concert series , the HIStory World Tour which ran from 1996 to 1997 as part of a medley with " Scream " and " In the Closet " . The song was set to be performed on Jackson 's This Is It comeback concert series at The O2 Arena in London from July 2009 to March 2010 but the shows were ultimately cancelled due to his sudden death on June 25 , 2009 .

 The song begins with a child chanting , " Enough is enough of this garbage ! " and someone else helps sing the chorus — " All I wanna say is that they don 't really care about us " . According to the sheet music published on Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing " They Don 't Care About Us " is played in the key of D minor and the track 's time signature is common time . The song , which is cited as being a pop song , has a moderately slow tempo of 88 beats per minute . Instruments used include a piano and guitar . Jon Pareles stated that Jackson was calling himself " a victim of police brutality " and a " victim of hate " . He continued , " A listener might wonder just who ' Us ' is supposed to be ... To make the songs lodge in the ear , Jackson uses elementary singsong melodies – a ' <unk> , <unk> ' two @-@ note motif in ' They Don 't Care About Us ' ... and he comes up with all kinds of surprises in the arrangements " . 
 James Hunter of Rolling Stone magazine noted that musically , Jackson was no longer trying to hide any eccentricities he had , he expressed the opinion that in " They Don 't Care About Us " , the pop musician sounded more embattled than ever . Jim Farber of New York Daily News said that Jackson " snarled " while singing , that the song " clicked " and has an " original clattering rhythm " . The review of HIStory in The Washington Times noted of " They Don 't Care About Us " : " [ it ] follows fast , inviting more pathos – and more controversy . With haunting clapping and a police scanner in the background " . The Sacramento Bee described it as a " looped reggae @-@ lite dance beat " . 
 The song gained renewed attention and relevance due to its use during Black Lives Matter protests in 2014 and 2015 .

The song reached the top of the charts for three weeks in Germany and stayed a full 30 weeks in the survey . It is the longest consecutive chart run of a Michael Jackson song in the German charts . The lyrical controversy surrounding " They Don 't Care About Us " brought partial commercial disappointment in the US ; radio stations were reluctant to play the song . It peaked at number 30 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart , falling short of the record breaking success of the two previous singles " Scream / Childhood " and " You Are Not Alone " , yet the song peaked at number 10 on the US Billboard Hot R & B Singles chart .

 Producing the first video proved to be a difficult task for Jackson . State authorities unsuccessfully tried to ban the singer filming in Salvador ( Pelourinho ) and in Rio de Janeiro . Officials in the state of Rio feared images of poverty might affect tourism and accused Jackson of exploiting the poor . Ronaldo Cezar Coelho , the state secretary for Industry , Commerce and Tourism demanded editing rights over the finished product , stating , " I don 't see why we should have to facilitate films that will contribute nothing to all our efforts to rehabilitate Rio 's image " . Some were concerned that scenes of poverty and human rights abuses would affect their chances of hosting the Olympics in 2004 . Others supported Jackson 's wish to highlight the problems of the region , arguing that the government were embarrassed by their own failings . 
 A judge banned all filming but this ruling was overturned by an injunction . Although officials were angry , the residents were not and Jackson was surrounded by crowds of enthusiastic onlookers during filming . One woman managed to push through security to hug Jackson who continued dancing while hugging her . Another woman appeared and hugged him from behind . He then fell to the ground as police pulled the two women off him and escorted them away . After the director helped Jackson get up off the street , he continued to sing and dance . This incident made it into the music video . 1 @,@ 500 policemen and 50 residents acting as security guards effectively sealed off the Dona Marta favela . Some residents and officials found it offensive that Jackson 's production team had negotiated with drug dealers in order to gain permission to film in one of the city 's shantytowns . 
 The music video was directed by Spike Lee . Asked why he chose Lee to direct the video , Jackson responded , " ' They Don 't Care About Us ' has an edge , and Spike Lee had approached me . It 's a public awareness song and that 's what he is all about . It 's a protest kind of song ... and I think he was perfect for it " . 
 Jackson also collaborated with 200 members of the cultural group Olodum , who " swayed to the heavy beat of Salvador 's ' samba @-@ reggae ' music " . The media interest surrounding the music video exposed Olodum to 140 countries around the world . It brought them worldwide fame and increased their credibility in Brazil . At the beginning of the video , a Brazilian woman says " Michael , <unk> não <unk> pra gente " which means " Michael , they don 't care about us " . 
 Speaking of the music video , in The New Brazilian Cinema , Lúcia Nagib observed : 
 When Michael Jackson decided to shoot his new music video in a favela of Rio de Janeiro ... he used the favela people as extras in a visual super @-@ spectacle ... All the while there is a vaguely political appeal in there ... The interesting aspect of Michael Jackson 's strategy is the efficiency with which it gives visibility to poverty and social problems in countries like Brazil without resorting to traditional political discourse . The problematic aspect is that it does not entail a real intervention in that poverty . 
 In 2009 , Billboard described the area as " now a model for social development " and claimed that Jackson 's influence was partially responsible for this improvement . 
 For the first time in his career , Jackson made a second music video for a single . This second version was filmed in a prison with cell mates ; in the video Jackson is seen handcuffed . It also contains real footage of police attacking African Americans , the military crackdown of the protest in the Tiananmen Square , the Ku Klux Klan , war crimes , genocide , execution , martial law , and other human rights abuses . 
 The first music video of the song appears on the box set Visionary : The Video Singles , and the video albums HIStory on Film , Volume II and Vision ; the latter additionally includes the prison version . 
 The voice intro , " Michael , Michael , <unk> não <unk> pra gente " ( <unk> for " they don 't care about us " ) , was recorded by Angélica Vieira , producer of Manhattan Connection .

 In 2009 , Northern Kings covered the song as bonus track for on their 2008 album <unk> . 
 In 2012 , Italian jazz trumpeter Enrico Rava released a version on his tribute album Rava on the Dance Floor . 
 In 2014 , 2Cellos released a cover of the song on their album <unk> . 
 In 2014 , a Nigerian , King A @-@ Maz , used the song to protest the Nigerian government 's nonchalance concerning the Boko Haram carnage going on at that time . The single was uploaded to YouTube , along with amateur footage , which caused a lot of controversy due to the newspaper clippings used in the footage . 
 The Tupac Shakur album entitled Better <unk> ( 2002 ) features a song named " They Don 't Give a Fuck About Us " . With different lyrics , the song contained a similar theme and musical composition style . Tupac discusses the trials and tribulations of the black and working class communities , referring to " they " as the middle class , media , U.S. that did not understand him .

 A short video clip released after Jackson 's death of the June 23 , 2009 rehearsal for the This Is It concert series shows Jackson performing the song as the main song in a medley with parts of " HIStory " song as well as " Why You Wanna Trip On Me " and " She Drives Me Wild " from Dangerous . 
 = = Dispute regarding lyrics and context = = 
 The New York Times reported the song contained racist and anti @-@ Semitic content on June 15 , 1995 , just a day before the album 's release . The publication highlighted the lyrics , " Jew me , sue me , everybody do me / Kick me , kike me , don 't you black or white me . " Jackson responded directly to the publication , stating : 
 When questioned further about the lyrics on the ABC News program Prime Time Live , Jackson stated , " It 's not anti @-@ Semitic because I 'm not a racist person ... I could never be a racist . I love all races . " The singer also claimed that some of his closest employees and friends were Jewish . That same day , Jackson received support from his manager and record label , who described the lyrics as " brilliant " , that they were about opposition to prejudice and taken out of context . The following day , two leading members of the Jewish community stated that Jackson 's attempt to make a song critical of discrimination had backfired . They expressed the opinion that the lyrics used were unsuitable for a teenage audience that might not understand the song 's context , adding that the song was too ambiguous for some listeners to understand . They accepted that Jackson meant well and suggested that the entertainer write an explanation in the album booklet . 
 On June 17 , Jackson issued another public apology for his choice of words . He promised that future copies of the album would include an apology . By this point , however , two million copies of the record had already been shipped . The singer concluded , " I just want you all to know how strongly I am committed to tolerance , peace and love , and I apologize to anyone who might have been hurt . " The next day , in his review of HIStory , Jon Pareles of The New York Times alleged , " In ... ' They Don 't Care About Us ' , he gives the lie to his entire catalogue of brotherhood anthems with a burst of anti @-@ Semitism . " 
 On June 21 , Patrick Macdonald of The Seattle Times criticized Jackson , stating , " He may have lived a sheltered life , but there really is no excuse for using terms like ' Jew me ' and ' kike ' in a pop song , unless you make it clear you are denouncing such terms , and do so in an artful way . " Two days later , Jackson decided , despite the cost incurred , he would return to the studio and alter the offending wording on future copies of the album ; " Jew me " and " Kike me " would be substituted with " do me " and " strike me " . The music video and some copies of the album still carry the original words , but with loud , abstract noises partially drowning them out . He reiterated his acceptance that the song was offensive to some . Spike Lee claimed there was some kind of double standard in the music industry . " While the New York Times asserted the use of racial slurs in " They Don 't Care About Us " , they were silent on other racial slurs in the album . The Notorious B.I.G. says " nigga " on " This Time Around , " another song on the HIStory album , but it did not attract media attention , as well as , many years before , use in lyrics of word " nigger " by John Lennon .

 = Benzodiazepine = 
 Benzodiazepines ( BZD , <unk> ) , sometimes called " <unk> " , are a class of psychoactive drugs whose core chemical structure is the fusion of a benzene ring and a diazepine ring . The first such drug , chlordiazepoxide ( Librium ) , was discovered accidentally by Leo Sternbach in 1955 , and made available in 1960 by Hoffmann – La Roche , which , since 1963 , has also marketed the benzodiazepine diazepam ( Valium ) . In 1977 benzodiazepines were globally the most prescribed medications . 
 Benzodiazepines enhance the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) at the GABAA receptor , resulting in sedative , hypnotic ( sleep @-@ inducing ) , anxiolytic ( anti @-@ anxiety ) , anticonvulsant , and muscle relaxant properties . High doses of many shorter @-@ acting benzodiazepines may also cause anterograde amnesia and dissociation . These properties make benzodiazepines useful in treating anxiety , insomnia , agitation , seizures , muscle spasms , alcohol withdrawal and as a <unk> for medical or dental procedures . Benzodiazepines are categorized as either short- , <unk> , or long @-@ acting . <unk> and intermediate @-@ acting benzodiazepines are preferred for the treatment of insomnia ; longer @-@ acting benzodiazepines are recommended for the treatment of anxiety . 
 Benzodiazepines are generally viewed as safe and effective for short @-@ term use , although cognitive impairment and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur . A minority of people can have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic . Long @-@ term use is controversial because of concerns about adverse psychological and physical effects , decreasing effectiveness , and physical dependence and withdrawal . As a result of adverse effects associated with the long @-@ term use of benzodiazepines , withdrawal from benzodiazepines , in general , leads to improved physical and mental health . The elderly are at an increased risk of suffering from both short- and long @-@ term adverse effects , and as a result , all benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers List of inappropriate medications for older adults . 
 There is controversy concerning the safety of benzodiazepines in pregnancy . While they are not major teratogens , uncertainty remains as to whether they cause cleft palate in a small number of babies and whether <unk> effects occur as a result of prenatal exposure ; they are known to cause withdrawal symptoms in the newborn . Benzodiazepines can be taken in overdoses and can cause dangerous deep unconsciousness . However , they are much less toxic than their predecessors , the barbiturates , and death rarely results when a benzodiazepine is the only drug taken ; however , when combined with other central nervous system ( CNS ) depressants such as ethanol and opioids , the potential for toxicity and fatal overdose increases . Benzodiazepines are commonly misused and taken in combination with other drugs of abuse . 
 = = Medical uses = = 
 Benzodiazepines possess sedative , hypnotic , anxiolytic , anticonvulsant , muscle relaxant , and amnesic actions , which are useful in a variety of indications such as alcohol dependence , seizures , anxiety , panic , agitation , and insomnia . Most are administered orally ; however , they can also be given intravenously , intramuscularly , or rectally . In general , benzodiazepines are well @-@ tolerated and are safe and effective drugs in the short term for a wide range of conditions . Tolerance can develop to their effects and there is also a risk of dependence , and upon discontinuation a withdrawal syndrome may occur . These factors , combined with other possible secondary effects after prolonged use such as psychomotor , cognitive , or memory impairments , limit their long @-@ term applicability . The effects of long @-@ term use or misuse include the tendency to cause or worsen cognitive deficits , depression , and anxiety . 
 = = = Panic disorder = = = 
 Because of their effectiveness , tolerability , and rapid onset of anxiolytic action , benzodiazepines are frequently used for the treatment of anxiety associated with panic disorder . However , there is disagreement among expert bodies regarding the long @-@ term use of benzodiazepines for panic disorder . The views range from those that hold that benzodiazepines are not effective long @-@ term and that they should be reserved for treatment @-@ resistant cases to that they are as effective in the long term as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors . 
 The American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) guidelines note that , in general , benzodiazepines are well tolerated , and their use for the initial treatment for panic disorder is strongly supported by numerous controlled trials . APA states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any of the established panic disorder treatments over another . The choice of treatment between benzodiazepines , SSRIs , serotonin – norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors , tricyclic antidepressants , and psychotherapy should be based on the patient 's history , preference , and other individual characteristics . Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are likely to be the best choice of pharmacotherapy for many patients with panic disorder , but benzodiazepines are also often used , and some studies suggest that these medications are still used with greater frequency than the SSRIs . One advantage of benzodiazepines is that they alleviate the anxiety symptoms much faster than antidepressants , and therefore may be preferred in patients for whom rapid symptom control is critical . However , this advantage is offset by the possibility of developing benzodiazepine dependence . APA does not recommend benzodiazepines for persons with depressive symptoms or a recent history of substance abuse . The APA guidelines state that , in general , pharmacotherapy of panic disorder should be continued for at least a year , and that clinical experience support continuing benzodiazepine treatment to prevent recurrence . Although major concerns about benzodiazepine tolerance and withdrawal have been raised , there is no evidence for significant dose escalation in patients using benzodiazepines long @-@ term . For many such patients stable doses of benzodiazepines retain their efficacy over several years . 
 Guidelines issued by the UK @-@ based National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) , carried out a systematic review using different methodology and came to a different conclusion . They questioned the accuracy of studies that were not placebo @-@ controlled . And , based on the findings of placebo @-@ controlled studies , they do not recommend use of benzodiazepines beyond two to four weeks , as tolerance and physical dependence develop rapidly , with withdrawal symptoms including rebound anxiety occurring after six weeks or more of use . Nevertheless , benzodiazepines continue to be prescribed for the long @-@ term treatment of anxiety disorders , although specific antidepressants and psychological therapies are recommended as the first @-@ line treatment options with the anticonvulsant drug <unk> indicated as a second- or third @-@ line treatment and suitable for long @-@ term use . NICE stated that long @-@ term use of benzodiazepines for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia is an unlicensed indication , does not have long @-@ term efficacy , and is , therefore , not recommended by clinical guidelines . Psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy are recommended as a first @-@ line therapy for panic disorder ; benzodiazepine use has been found to interfere with therapeutic gains from these therapies . 
 Benzodiazepines are usually administered orally ; however , very occasionally lorazepam or diazepam may be given intravenously for the treatment of panic attacks . 
 = = = Generalized anxiety disorder = = = 
 Benzodiazepines have robust efficacy in the short @-@ term management of generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD ) , but were not shown to be effective in producing long @-@ term improvement overall . According to National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) , benzodiazepines can be used in the immediate management of GAD , if necessary . However , they should not usually be given for longer than 2 – 4 weeks . The only medications NICE recommends for the longer term management of GAD are antidepressants . 
 Likewise , Canadian Psychiatric Association ( CPA ) recommends benzodiazepines alprazolam , <unk> , lorazepam , and diazepam only as a second @-@ line choice , if the treatment with two different antidepressants was unsuccessful . Although they are second @-@ line agents , benzodiazepines can be used for a limited time to relieve severe anxiety and agitation . CPA guidelines note that after 4 – 6 weeks the effect of benzodiazepines may decrease to the level of placebo , and that benzodiazepines are less effective than antidepressants in alleviating ruminative worry , the core symptom of GAD . However , in some cases , a prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines as the add @-@ on to an antidepressant may be justified . 
 A 2015 review found a larger effect with medications than talk therapy . Medications with benefit include serotonin @-@ noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors , benzodiazepines , and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors . 
 = = = Insomnia = = = 
 Benzodiazepines can be useful for short @-@ term treatment of insomnia . Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due to the risk of dependence . It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose . They improve sleep @-@ related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep , prolonging the sleep time , and , in general , reducing wakefulness . However , they worsen sleep quality by increasing light sleep and decreasing deep sleep . Other drawbacks of hypnotics , including benzodiazepines , are possible tolerance to their effects , rebound insomnia , and reduced slow @-@ wave sleep and a withdrawal period typified by rebound insomnia and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation . 
 The list of benzodiazepines approved for the treatment of insomnia is fairly similar among most countries , but which benzodiazepines are officially designated as first @-@ line hypnotics prescribed for the treatment of insomnia can vary distinctly between countries . Longer @-@ acting benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam and diazepam have residual effects that may persist into the next day and are , in general , not recommended . 
 Since the release of nonbenzodiazepines in 1992 in response to safety concerns , individuals with insomnia and other sleep disorders have increasingly been prescribed nonbenzodiazepines ( 2 @.@ 3 % in 1993 to 13 @.@ 7 % of Americans in 2010 ) , less often prescribed benzodiazepines ( 23 @.@ 5 % in 1993 to 10 @.@ 8 % in 2010 ) . It is not clear as to whether the new <unk> hypnotics ( Z @-@ drugs ) are better than the short @-@ acting benzodiazepines . The efficacy of these two groups of medications is similar . According to the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , indirect comparison indicates that side @-@ effects from benzodiazepines may be about twice as frequent as from nonbenzodiazepines . Some experts suggest using nonbenzodiazepines preferentially as a first @-@ line long @-@ term treatment of insomnia . However , the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence did not find any convincing evidence in favor of Z @-@ drugs . NICE review pointed out that short @-@ acting Z @-@ drugs were inappropriately compared in clinical trials with long @-@ acting benzodiazepines . There have been no trials comparing short @-@ acting Z @-@ drugs with appropriate doses of short @-@ acting benzodiazepines . Based on this , NICE recommended choosing the hypnotic based on cost and the patient 's preference . 
 Older adults should not use benzodiazepines to treat insomnia unless other treatments have failed to be effective . When benzodiazepines are used , patients , their caretakers , and their physician should discuss the increased risk of harms , including evidence which shows twice the incidence of traffic collisions among driving patients as well as falls and hip fracture for all older patients . 
 = = = Seizures = = = 
 Prolonged convulsive epileptic seizures are a medical emergency that can usually be dealt with effectively by administering fast @-@ acting benzodiazepines , which are potent anticonvulsants . In a hospital environment , intravenous clonazepam , lorazepam , and diazepam are first @-@ line choices , clonazepam due to its stronger and more potent anticonvulsant action , diazepam due to its faster onset and lorazepam for its longer duration of action . In the community , intravenous administration is not practical and so rectal diazepam or ( more recently ) buccal midazolam are used , with a preference for midazolam as its administration is easier and more socially acceptable . 
 When benzodiazepines were first introduced , they were enthusiastically adopted for treating all forms of epilepsy . However , drowsiness and tolerance become problems with continued use and none are now considered first @-@ line choices for long @-@ term epilepsy therapy . Clobazam is widely used by specialist epilepsy clinics worldwide and clonazepam is popular in the Netherlands , Belgium and France . Clobazam was approved for use in the United States in 2011 . In the UK , both <unk> and clonazepam are second @-@ line choices for treating many forms of epilepsy . Clobazam also has a useful role for very short @-@ term seizure prophylaxis and in catamenial epilepsy . Discontinuation after long @-@ term use in epilepsy requires additional caution because of the risks of rebound seizures . Therefore , the dose is slowly tapered over a period of up to six months or longer . 
 = = = Alcohol withdrawal = = = 
 <unk> is the most commonly used benzodiazepine for alcohol detoxification , but diazepam may be used as an alternative . Both are used in the detoxification of individuals who are motivated to stop drinking , and are prescribed for a short period of time to reduce the risks of developing tolerance and dependence to the benzodiazepine medication itself . The benzodiazepines with a longer half @-@ life make detoxification more tolerable , and dangerous ( and potentially lethal ) alcohol withdrawal effects are less likely to occur . On the other hand , short @-@ acting benzodiazepines may lead to breakthrough seizures , and are , therefore , not recommended for detoxification in an outpatient setting . <unk> and lorazepam are often used in patients at risk of drug accumulation , in particular , the elderly and those with cirrhosis , because they are metabolized differently from other benzodiazepines , through conjugation . 
 Benzodiazepines are the preferred choice in the management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome , in particular , for the prevention and treatment of the dangerous complication of seizures and in subduing severe delirium . Lorazepam is the only benzodiazepine with predictable intramuscular absorption and it is the most effective in preventing and controlling acute seizures . 
 = = = Anxiety = = = 
 Benzodiazepines are sometimes used in the treatment of acute anxiety , as they bring about rapid and marked or moderate relief of symptoms in most individuals ; however , they are not recommended beyond 2 – 4 weeks of use due to risks of tolerance and dependence and a lack of long @-@ term effectiveness . As for insomnia , they may also be used on an irregular / " as @-@ needed " basis , such as in cases where said anxiety is at its worst . Compared to other pharmacological treatments , benzodiazepines are twice as likely to lead to a relapse of the underlying condition upon discontinuation . Psychological therapies and other pharmacological therapies are recommended for the long @-@ term treatment of generalized anxiety disorder . Antidepressants have higher remission rates and are , in general , safe and effective in the short and long term . 
 = = = Other indications = = = 
 Benzodiazepines are often prescribed for a wide range of conditions : 
 They can be very useful in intensive care to sedate patients receiving mechanical ventilation or those in extreme distress . Caution is exercised in this situation due to the occasional occurrence of respiratory depression , and it is recommended that benzodiazepine overdose treatment facilities should be available . 
 Benzodiazepines are effective as medication given a couple of hours before surgery to relieve anxiety . They also produce amnesia , which can be useful , as patients will not be able to remember any unpleasantness from the procedure . They are also used in patients with dental phobia as well as some ophthalmic procedures like refractive surgery ; although such use is controversial and only recommended for those who are very anxious . Midazolam is the most commonly prescribed for this use because of its strong sedative actions and fast recovery time , as well as its water solubility , which reduces pain upon injection . Diazepam and lorazepam are sometimes used . Lorazepam has particularly marked amnesic properties that may make it more effective when amnesia is the desired effect . 
 Benzodiazepines are well known for their strong muscle @-@ relaxing properties and can be useful in the treatment of muscle spasms , although tolerance often develops to their muscle relaxant effects . <unk> or <unk> are sometimes used as an alternative to benzodiazepines . <unk> has been found to have superior tolerability compared to diazepam and baclofen . 
 Benzodiazepines are also used to treat the acute panic caused by hallucinogen intoxication . Benzodiazepines are also used to calm the acutely agitated individual and can , if required , be given via an intramuscular injection . They can sometimes be effective in the short @-@ term treatment of psychiatric emergencies such as acute psychosis as in schizophrenia or mania , bringing about rapid <unk> and sedation until the effects of lithium or neuroleptics ( antipsychotics ) take effect . Lorazepam is most commonly used but clonazepam is sometimes prescribed for acute psychosis or mania ; their long @-@ term use is not recommended due to risks of dependence . 
 <unk> , a benzodiazepine is used to treat many forms of <unk> . Rapid eye movement behavior disorder responds well to low doses of clonazepam . Restless legs syndrome can be treated using clonazepam as a third line treatment option as the use of clonazepam is still investigational . 
 Benzodiazepines are sometimes used for obsessive – compulsive disorder ( OCD ) , although they are generally believed to be ineffective for this indication ; effectiveness was , however , found in one small study . Benzodiazepines can be considered as a treatment option in treatment resistant cases . 
 Antipsychotics are generally a first @-@ line treatment for delirium ; however , when delirium is caused by alcohol or sedative hypnotic withdrawal , benzodiazepines are a first @-@ line treatment . 
 There is some evidence that low doses of benzodiazepines reduce adverse effects of electroconvulsive therapy . 
 = = Contraindications = = 
 Because of their muscle relaxant action , benzodiazepines may cause respiratory depression in susceptible individuals . For that reason , they are contraindicated in people with myasthenia gravis , sleep apnea , bronchitis , and COPD . Caution is required when benzodiazepines are used in people with personality disorders or intellectual disability because of frequent paradoxical reactions . In major depression , they may precipitate suicidal tendencies and are sometimes used for suicidal overdoses . Individuals with a history of alcohol , opioid and barbiturate abuse should avoid benzodiazepines , as there is a risk of life @-@ threatening interactions with these drugs . 
 = = = Pregnancy = = = 
 In the United States , the Food and Drug Administration has categorized benzodiazepines into either category D or X meaning potential for harm in the unborn has been demonstrated . 
 Exposure to benzodiazepines during pregnancy has been associated with a slightly increased ( from 0 @.@ 06 to 0 @.@ 07 % ) risk of cleft palate in newborns , a controversial conclusion as some studies find no association between benzodiazepines and cleft palate . Their use by expectant mothers shortly before the delivery may result in a floppy infant syndrome , with the newborns suffering from hypotonia , hypothermia , lethargy , and breathing and feeding difficulties . Cases of neonatal withdrawal syndrome have been described in infants chronically exposed to benzodiazepines in utero . This syndrome may be hard to recognize , as it starts several days after delivery , for example , as late as 21 day for chlordiazepoxide . The symptoms include tremors , hypertonia , hyperreflexia , hyperactivity , and vomiting and may last for up to three to six months . <unk> down the dose during pregnancy may lessen its severity . If used in pregnancy , those benzodiazepines with a better and longer safety record , such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide , are recommended over potentially more harmful benzodiazepines , such as temazepam or triazolam . Using the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time minimizes the risks to the unborn child . 
 = = = Elderly = = = 
 The benefits of benzodiazepines are least and the risks are greatest in the elderly . The elderly are at an increased risk of dependence and are more sensitive to the adverse effects such as memory problems , daytime sedation , impaired motor coordination , and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls , and an increased risk of hip fractures . The long @-@ term effects of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine dependence in the elderly can resemble dementia , depression , or anxiety syndromes , and progressively worsens over time . Adverse effects on cognition can be mistaken for the effects of old age . The benefits of withdrawal include improved cognition , alertness , mobility , reduced risk incontinence , and a reduced risk of falls and fractures . The success of gradual @-@ tapering benzodiazepines is as great in the elderly as in younger people . Benzodiazepines should be prescribed to the elderly only with caution and only for a short period at low doses . Short to intermediate @-@ acting benzodiazepines are preferred in the elderly such as oxazepam and temazepam . The high potency benzodiazepines alprazolam and triazolam and long @-@ acting benzodiazepines are not recommended in the elderly due to increased adverse effects . Nonbenzodiazepines such as <unk> and zolpidem and low doses of sedating antidepressants are sometimes used as alternatives to benzodiazepines . 
 Long @-@ term use of benzodiazepines has been associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment , but its relationship with dementia remains inconclusive . The association of a past history of benzodiazepine use and cognitive decline is unclear , with some studies reporting a lower risk of cognitive decline in former users , some finding no association and some indicating an increased risk of cognitive decline . 
 Benzodiazepines are sometimes prescribed to treat behavioral symptoms of dementia . However , like antidepressants , they have little evidence of effectiveness , although antipsychotics have shown some benefit . Cognitive impairing effects of benzodiazepines that occur frequently in the elderly can also worsen dementia . 
 = = Adverse effects = = 
 The most common side @-@ effects of benzodiazepines are related to their sedating and muscle @-@ relaxing action . They include drowsiness , dizziness , and decreased alertness and concentration . Lack of coordination may result in falls and injuries , in particular , in the elderly . Another result is impairment of driving skills and increased likelihood of road traffic accidents . Decreased libido and erection problems are a common side effect . Depression and disinhibition may emerge . Hypotension and suppressed breathing ( hypoventilation ) may be encountered with intravenous use . Less common side effects include nausea and changes in appetite , blurred vision , confusion , euphoria , depersonalization and nightmares . Cases of liver toxicity have been described but are very rare . 
 The long @-@ term effects of benzodiazepine use can include cognitive impairment as well as affective and behavioural problems . Feelings of turmoil , difficulty in thinking constructively , loss of sex @-@ drive , agoraphobia and social phobia , increasing anxiety and depression , loss of interest in leisure pursuits and interests , and an inability to experience or express feelings can also occur . Not everyone , however , experiences problems with long @-@ term use . Additionally an altered perception of self , environment and relationships may occur . 
 = = = Cognitive effects = = = 
 The short @-@ term use of benzodiazepines adversely affects multiple areas of cognition , the most notable one being that it interferes with the formation and consolidation of memories of new material and may induce complete anterograde amnesia . However , researchers hold contrary opinions regarding the effects of long @-@ term administration . One view is that many of the short @-@ term effects continue into the long @-@ term and may even worsen , and are not resolved after stopping benzodiazepine usage . Another view maintains that cognitive deficits in chronic benzodiazepine users occur only for a short period after the dose , or that the anxiety disorder is the cause of these deficits . 
 While the definitive studies are lacking , the former view received support from a 2004 meta @-@ analysis of 13 small studies . This meta @-@ analysis found that long @-@ term use of benzodiazepines was associated with moderate to large adverse effects on all areas of cognition , with visuospatial memory being the most commonly detected impairment . Some of the other impairments reported were decreased IQ , <unk> coordination , information processing , verbal learning and concentration . The authors of the meta @-@ analysis and a later reviewer noted that the applicability of this meta @-@ analysis is limited because the subjects were taken mostly from withdrawal clinics ; the coexisting drug , alcohol use , and psychiatric disorders were not defined ; and several of the included studies conducted the cognitive measurements during the withdrawal period . 
 = = = Paradoxical effects = = = 
 Paradoxical reactions , such as increased seizures in epileptics , aggression , violence , impulsivity , irritability and suicidal behavior sometimes occur . These reactions have been explained as consequences of disinhibition and the subsequent loss of control over socially unacceptable behavior . Paradoxical reactions are rare in the general population , with an incidence rate below 1 % and similar to placebo . However , they occur with greater frequency in recreational abusers , individuals with borderline personality disorder , children , and patients on high @-@ dosage regimes . In these groups , impulse control problems are perhaps the most important risk factor for disinhibition ; learning disabilities and neurological disorders are also significant risks . Most reports of disinhibition involve high doses of high @-@ potency benzodiazepines . Paradoxical effects may also appear after chronic use of benzodiazepines . 
 = = = Long @-@ term worsening of psychiatric symptoms = = = 
 While <unk> may have short @-@ term benefits for anxiety , sleep and agitation in some patients , long @-@ term ( i.e. , greater than 2 – 4 weeks ) use can result in a worsening of the very symptoms the medications are meant to treat . Potential explanations include exacerbating cognitive problems that are already common in anxiety disorders , causing or worsening depression and suicidality , disrupting sleep architecture by inhibiting deep stage sleep , withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms in between doses mimicking or exacerbating underlying anxiety or sleep disorders , inhibiting the benefits of psychotherapy by inhibiting memory consolidation and reducing fear extinction , and reducing coping with trauma / stress and increasing vulnerability to future stress . Anxiety , insomnia and irritability may be temporarily exacerbated during withdrawal , but psychiatric symptoms after discontinuation are usually less than even while taking benzodiazepines . Fortunately , for those with benzodiazepine @-@ induced problems , functioning significantly improves within 1 year of discontinuation . 
 = = = Reinforcement disorders = = = 
 = = = = Tolerance = = = = 
 The main problem of the chronic use of benzodiazepines is the development of tolerance and dependence . Tolerance manifests itself as diminished pharmacological effect and develops relatively quickly to the sedative , hypnotic , anticonvulsant , and muscle relaxant actions of benzodiazepines . Tolerance to anti @-@ anxiety effects develops more slowly with little evidence of continued effectiveness beyond four to six months of continued use . In general , tolerance to the amnesic effects does not occur . However , controversy exists as to tolerance to the anxiolytic effects with some evidence that benzodiazepines retain efficacy and opposing evidence from a systematic review of the literature that tolerance frequently occurs and some evidence that anxiety may worsen with long @-@ term use . The question of tolerance to the amnesic effects of benzodiazepines is , likewise , unclear . Some evidence suggests that partial tolerance does develop , and that , " memory impairment is limited to a narrow window within 90 minutes after each dose " . 
 A major disadvantage of benzodiazepines that tolerance to therapeutic effects develops relatively quickly while many adverse effects persist . Tolerance develops to hypnotic and <unk> effects within days to weeks , and to anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects within weeks to months . Therefore , benzodiazepines are unlikely to be effective long @-@ term treatments for sleep and anxiety . While BZD therapeutic effects disappear with tolerance , depression and impulsivity with high suicidal risk commonly persist . Several studies have confirmed that long @-@ term benzodiazepines are not significantly different from placebo for sleep or anxiety . This may explain why patients commonly increase doses over time and many eventually take more than one type of benzodiazepine after the first loses effectiveness . Additionally , because tolerance to benzodiazepine sedating effects develops more quickly than does tolerance to brainstem depressant effects , those taking more benzodiazepines to achieve desired effects may suffer sudden respiratory depression , hypotension or death . Most patients with anxiety disorders and PTSD have symptoms which persist for at least several months , making tolerance to therapeutic effects a distinct problem for them and necessitating the need for more effective long @-@ term treatment ( e.g. , psychotherapy , serotonergic antidepressants ) . 
 = = = = Withdrawal symptoms and management = = = = 
 Discontinuation of benzodiazepines or abrupt reduction of the dose , even after a relatively short course of treatment ( three to four weeks ) , may result in two groups of symptoms — rebound and withdrawal . Rebound symptoms are the return of the symptoms for which the patient was treated but worse than before . Withdrawal symptoms are the new symptoms that occur when the benzodiazepine is stopped . They are the main sign of physical dependence . 
 The most frequent symptoms of withdrawal from benzodiazepines are insomnia , gastric problems , tremors , agitation , fearfulness , and muscle spasms . The less frequent effects are irritability , sweating , depersonalization , derealization , hypersensitivity to stimuli , depression , suicidal behavior , psychosis , seizures , and delirium tremens . Severe symptoms usually occur as a result of abrupt or over @-@ rapid withdrawal . Abrupt withdrawal can be dangerous , therefore a gradual reduction regimen is recommended . 
 Symptoms may also occur during a gradual dosage reduction , but are typically less severe and may persist as part of a protracted withdrawal syndrome for months after cessation of benzodiazepines . Approximately 10 % of patients will experience a notable protracted withdrawal syndrome , which can persist for many months or in some cases a year or longer . Protracted symptoms tend to resemble those seen during the first couple of months of withdrawal but usually are of a sub @-@ acute level of severity . Such symptoms do gradually lessen over time , eventually disappearing altogether . 
 Benzodiazepines have a reputation with patients and doctors for causing a severe and traumatic withdrawal ; however , this is in large part due to the withdrawal process being poorly managed . Over @-@ rapid withdrawal from benzodiazepines increases the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and increases the failure rate . A slow and gradual withdrawal customised to the individual and , if indicated , psychological support is the most effective way of managing the withdrawal . Opinion as to the time needed to complete withdrawal ranges from four weeks to several years . A goal of less than six months has been suggested , but due to factors such as dosage and type of benzodiazepine , reasons for prescription , lifestyle , personality , environmental stresses , and amount of available support , a year or more may be needed to withdraw . 
 Withdrawal is best managed by transferring the physically dependent patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam because it has the longest half @-@ life of all of the benzodiazepines , is metabolised into long @-@ acting active metabolites and is available in low @-@ potency tablets , which can be quartered for smaller doses . A further benefit is that it is available in liquid form , which allows for even smaller reductions . <unk> , which also has a long half @-@ life and long @-@ acting active metabolites , can be used as an alternative . 
 Nonbenzodiazepines are contraindicated during benzodiazepine withdrawal as they are cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and can induce dependence . Alcohol is also cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and more toxic and thus caution is needed to avoid replacing one dependence with another . During withdrawal , <unk> @-@ based antibiotics are best avoided if possible ; they displace benzodiazepines from their binding site and reduce GABA function and , thus , may aggravate withdrawal symptoms . Antipsychotics are not recommended for benzodiazepine withdrawal ( or other CNS depressant withdrawal states ) especially clozapine , olanzapine or low potency <unk> e.g. chlorpromazine as they lower the seizure threshold and can worsen withdrawal effects ; if used extreme caution is required . 
 Withdrawal from long term benzodiazepines is beneficial for most individuals . Withdrawal of benzodiazepines from long @-@ term users , in general , leads to improved physical and mental health particularly in the elderly ; although some long term users report continued benefit from taking benzodiazepines , this may be the result of suppression of withdrawal effects . 
 = = Overdose = = 
 Although benzodiazepines are much safer in overdose than their predecessors , the barbiturates , they can still cause problems in overdose . Taken alone , they rarely cause severe complications in overdose ; statistics in England showed that benzodiazepines were responsible for 3 @.@ 8 % of all deaths by poisoning from a single drug . However , combining these drugs with alcohol , opiates or tricyclic antidepressants markedly raises the toxicity . The elderly are more sensitive to the side effects of benzodiazepines , and poisoning may even occur from their long @-@ term use . The various benzodiazepines differ in their toxicity ; temazepam appears to be most toxic in overdose and when used with other drugs . The symptoms of a benzodiazepine overdose may include ; drowsiness , slurred speech , nystagmus , hypotension , ataxia , coma , respiratory depression , and cardiorespiratory arrest . 
 A reversal agent for benzodiazepines exists , flumazenil ( <unk> ) . Its use as an antidote is not routinely recommended because of the high risk of <unk> and seizures . In a double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled trial of 326 patients , 4 patients suffered serious adverse events and 61 % became <unk> following the use of flumazenil . Numerous contraindications to its use exist . It is contraindicated in patients with a history of long @-@ term use of benzodiazepines , those having ingested a substance that lowers the seizure threshold or may cause an arrhythmia , and in those with abnormal vital signs . One study found that only 10 % of the patient population presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for treatment with flumazenil . 
 = = Interactions = = 
 Individual benzodiazepines may have different interactions with certain drugs . Depending on their metabolism pathway , benzodiazepines can be divided roughly into two groups . The largest group consists of those that are metabolized by cytochrome P450 ( <unk> ) enzymes and possess significant potential for interactions with other drugs . The other group comprises those that are metabolized through <unk> , such as lorazepam , oxazepam , and temazepam , and , in general , have few drug interactions . 
 Many drugs , including oral contraceptives , some antibiotics , antidepressants , and antifungal agents , inhibit cytochrome enzymes in the liver . They reduce the rate of elimination of the benzodiazepines that are metabolized by <unk> , leading to possibly excessive drug accumulation and increased side @-@ effects . In contrast , drugs that induce cytochrome P450 enzymes , such as St John 's wort , the antibiotic rifampicin , and the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and phenytoin , accelerate elimination of many benzodiazepines and decrease their action . Taking benzodiazepines with alcohol , opioids and other central nervous system depressants potentiates their action . This often results in increased sedation , impaired motor coordination , suppressed breathing , and other adverse effects that have potential to be lethal . <unk> can slow down absorption of some benzodiazepines ; however , this effect is marginal and inconsistent . 
 = = Pharmacology = = 
 = = = Mechanism of action = = = 
 Benzodiazepines work by increasing the efficiency of a natural brain chemical , GABA , to decrease the excitability of neurons . This reduces the communication between neurons and , therefore , has a calming effect on many of the functions of the brain . 
 GABA controls the excitability of neurons by binding to the GABAA receptor . The GABAA receptor is a protein complex located in the synapses of neurons . All GABAA receptors contain an ion channel that conducts chloride ions across neuronal cell membranes and two binding sites for the neurotransmitter gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) , while a subset of GABAA receptor complexes also contain a single binding site for benzodiazepines . Binding of benzodiazepines to this receptor complex does not alter binding of GABA . Unlike other positive allosteric modulators that increases ligand binding , benzodiazepine binding acts as a positive allosteric modulator by increasing the total conduction of chloride ions across the neuronal cell membrane when GABA is already bound to its receptor . This increased chloride ion influx <unk> the neuron 's membrane potential . As a result , the difference between resting potential and threshold potential is increased and firing is less likely . Different GABAA receptor subtypes have varying distributions within different regions of the brain and , therefore , control distinct neuronal circuits . Hence , activation of different GABAA receptor subtypes by benzodiazepines may result in distinct pharmacological actions . In terms of the mechanism of action of benzodiazepines , their similarities are too great to separate them into individual categories such as anxiolytic or hypnotic . For example , a hypnotic administered in low doses will produce anxiety @-@ relieving effects , whereas a benzodiazepine marketed as an anti @-@ anxiety drug will at higher doses induce sleep . 
 The subset of GABAA receptors that also bind benzodiazepines are referred to as benzodiazepine receptors ( <unk> ) . The GABAA receptor is a <unk> composed of five subunits , the most common ones being two <unk> , two <unk> , and one γ ( <unk> ) . For each subunit , many subtypes exist ( α1 – 6 , β1 – 3 , and <unk> – 3 ) . GABAA receptors that are made up of different combinations of subunit subtypes have different properties , different distributions in the brain and different activities relative to pharmacological and clinical effects . Benzodiazepines bind at the interface of the α and γ subunits on the GABAA receptor . Binding also requires that alpha subunits contain a histidine amino acid residue , ( i.e. , α1 , α2 , <unk> , and <unk> containing GABAA receptors ) . For this reason , benzodiazepines show no affinity for GABAA receptors containing <unk> and <unk> subunits with an arginine instead of a histidine residue . Once bound to the benzodiazepine receptor , the benzodiazepine ligand locks the benzodiazepine receptor into a conformation in which it has a greater affinity for the GABA neurotransmitter . This increases the frequency of the opening of the associated chloride ion channel and <unk> the membrane of the associated neuron . The inhibitory effect of the available GABA is potentiated , leading to <unk> and anxiolytic effects . For instance , those ligands with high activity at the α1 are associated with stronger hypnotic effects , whereas those with higher affinity for GABAA receptors containing α2 and / or <unk> subunits have good anti @-@ anxiety activity . 
 The benzodiazepine class of drugs also interact with peripheral benzodiazepine receptors . Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors are present in peripheral nervous system tissues , glial cells , and to a lesser extent the central nervous system . These peripheral receptors are not structurally related or coupled to GABAA receptors . They modulate the immune system and are involved in the body response to injury . Benzodiazepines also function as weak adenosine reuptake inhibitors . It has been suggested that some of their anticonvulsant , anxiolytic , and muscle relaxant effects may be in part mediated by this action . 
 = = = Pharmacokinetics = = = 
 A benzodiazepine can be placed into one of three groups by its elimination half @-@ life , or time it takes for the body to eliminate half of the dose . Some benzodiazepines have long @-@ acting active metabolites , such as diazepam and chlordiazepoxide , which are metabolised into <unk> . <unk> has a half @-@ life of 36 – 200 hours , and flurazepam , with the main active metabolite of <unk> , with a half @-@ life of 40 – 250 hours . These long @-@ acting metabolites are partial agonists . 
 Short @-@ acting compounds have a median half @-@ life of 1 – 12 hours . They have few residual effects if taken before bedtime , rebound insomnia may occur upon discontinuation , and they might cause daytime withdrawal symptoms such as next day rebound anxiety with prolonged usage . Examples are <unk> , midazolam , and triazolam . 
 Intermediate @-@ acting compounds have a median half @-@ life of 12 – 40 hours . They may have some residual effects in the first half of the day if used as a hypnotic . Rebound insomnia , however , is more common upon discontinuation of intermediate @-@ acting benzodiazepines than longer @-@ acting benzodiazepines . Examples are alprazolam , <unk> , flunitrazepam , clonazepam , lormetazepam , lorazepam , nitrazepam , and temazepam . 
 Long @-@ acting compounds have a half @-@ life of 40 – 250 hours . They have a risk of accumulation in the elderly and in individuals with severely impaired liver function , but they have a reduced severity of rebound effects and withdrawal . Examples are diazepam , clorazepate , chlordiazepoxide , and flurazepam . 
 = = Physical and chemical properties = = 
 Benzodiazepines share a similar chemical structure , and their effects in humans are mainly produced by the allosteric modification of a specific kind of neurotransmitter receptor , the GABAA receptor , which increases the overall conductance of these inhibitory channels ; this results in the various therapeutic effects as well as adverse effects of benzodiazepines . Other less important mechanisms of action are also known . 
 = = = Chemistry = = = 
 The term benzodiazepine is the chemical name for the heterocyclic ring system ( see figure to the right ) , which is a fusion between the benzene and diazepine ring systems . Under <unk> – <unk> nomenclature , a diazepine is a <unk> with two nitrogen atoms , five carbon atom and the maximum possible number of cumulative double bonds . The " benzo " prefix indicates the benzene ring fused onto the diazepine ring . 
 Benzodiazepine drugs are substituted 1 @,@ 4 @-@ benzodiazepines , although the chemical term can refer to many other compounds that do not have useful pharmacological properties . Different benzodiazepine drugs have different side groups attached to this central structure . The different side groups affect the binding of the molecule to the GABAA receptor and so modulate the pharmacological properties . Many of the pharmacologically active " classical " benzodiazepine drugs contain the 5 @-@ phenyl @-@ 1H @-@ benzo [ e ] [ 1 @,@ 4 ] <unk> @-@ 2 ( 3H ) <unk> substructure ( see figure to the right ) . Benzodiazepines have been found to mimic protein reverse turns structurally which enable them with their biological activity in many cases . 
 Nonbenzodiazepines also bind to the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABAA receptor and possess similar pharmacological properties . While the nonbenzodiazepines are by definition structurally unrelated to the benzodiazepines , both classes of drugs possess a common pharmacophore ( see figure to the lower @-@ right ) , which explains their binding to a common receptor site .

 = = History = = 
 The first benzodiazepine , chlordiazepoxide ( Librium ) , was synthesized in 1955 by Leo Sternbach while working at Hoffmann – La Roche on the development of tranquilizers . The pharmacological properties of the compounds prepared initially were disappointing , and Sternbach abandoned the project . Two years later , in April 1957 , co @-@ worker Earl Reeder noticed a " nicely crystalline " compound left over from the discontinued project while spring @-@ cleaning in the lab . This compound , later named chlordiazepoxide , had not been tested in 1955 because of Sternbach 's focus on other issues . Expecting the pharmacology results to be negative and hoping to publish the chemistry @-@ related findings , researchers submitted it for a standard battery of animal tests . However , the compound showed very strong sedative , anticonvulsant , and muscle relaxant effects . These impressive clinical findings led to its speedy introduction throughout the world in 1960 under the brand name Librium . Following chlordiazepoxide , diazepam marketed by Hoffmann – La Roche under the brand name Valium in 1963 , and for a while the two were the most commercially successful drugs . The introduction of benzodiazepines led to a decrease in the prescription of barbiturates , and by the 1970s they had largely replaced the older drugs for sedative and hypnotic uses . 
 The new group of drugs was initially greeted with optimism by the medical profession , but gradually concerns arose ; in particular , the risk of dependence became evident in the 1980s . Benzodiazepines have a unique history in that they were responsible for the largest @-@ ever class @-@ action lawsuit against drug manufacturers in the United Kingdom , involving 14 @,@ 000 patients and 1 @,@ 800 law firms that alleged the manufacturers knew of the dependence potential but intentionally withheld this information from doctors . At the same time , 117 general practitioners and 50 health authorities were sued by patients to recover damages for the harmful effects of dependence and withdrawal . This led some doctors to require a signed consent form from their patients and to recommend that all patients be adequately warned of the risks of dependence and withdrawal before starting treatment with benzodiazepines . The court case against the drug manufacturers never reached a verdict ; legal aid had been withdrawn and there were allegations that the consultant psychiatrists , the expert witnesses , had a conflict of interest . This litigation led to changes in the British law , making class action lawsuits more difficult . 
 Although antidepressants with anxiolytic properties have been introduced , and there is increasing awareness of the adverse effects of benzodiazepines , prescriptions for short @-@ term anxiety relief have not significantly dropped . For treatment of insomnia , benzodiazepines are now less popular than nonbenzodiazepines , which include zolpidem , <unk> and <unk> . Nonbenzodiazepines are molecularly distinct , but nonetheless , they work on the same benzodiazepine receptors and produce similar sedative effects . 
 = = Society and culture = = 
 = = = Legal status = = = 
 In the United States , benzodiazepines are Schedule IV drugs under the Federal Controlled Substances Act , even when not on the market ( for example , nitrazepam and <unk> ) . <unk> is subject to more stringent regulations in certain states and temazepam prescriptions require specially coded pads in certain states . 
 In Canada , possession of benzodiazepines is legal for personal use . All benzodiazepines are categorized as Schedule IV substances under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act . 
 In the United Kingdom , the benzodiazepines are schedule 4 controlled drugs , except for flunitrazepam , temazepam and midazolam , which are schedule 3 controlled drugs and carry stronger penalties for possession and trafficking . 
 In the Netherlands , since October 1993 , benzodiazepines , including formulations containing less than 20 mg of temazepam , are all placed on List 2 of the Opium Law . A prescription is needed for possession of all benzodiazepines . Temazepam formulations containing 20 mg or greater of the drug are placed on List 1 , thus requiring prescriptions to be written in the List 1 format . 
 In East Asia and Southeast Asia , temazepam and <unk> are often heavily controlled and restricted . In certain countries , triazolam , flunitrazepam , <unk> and midazolam are also restricted or controlled to certain degrees . In Hong Kong , all benzodiazepines are regulated under Schedule 1 of Hong Kong 's Chapter 134 Dangerous Drugs Ordinance . Previously only <unk> , flunitrazepam and triazolam were classed as dangerous drugs . 
 Internationally , benzodiazepines are categorized as Schedule IV controlled drugs , apart from flunitrazepam which is a Schedule III drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances . 
 = = = Recreational use = = = 
 Benzodiazepines are considered to be major drugs of abuse . Benzodiazepine abuse is mostly limited to individuals who abuse other drugs , i.e. , poly @-@ drug abusers . On the international scene , benzodiazepines are categorized as Schedule IV controlled drugs by the <unk> , apart from flunitrazepam which is a Schedule III drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances . Some variation in drug scheduling exists in individual countries ; for example , in the United Kingdom , midazolam and temazepam are Schedule III controlled drugs . British law requires temazepam ( but not midazolam ) to be stored in safe custody . Safe custody requirements ensures that pharmacists and doctors holding stock of temazepam must store it in securely fixed double @-@ locked steel safety cabinets and maintain a written register , which must be bound and contain separate entries for temazepam and must be written in ink with no use of correction fluid ( although a written register is not required for temazepam in the United Kingdom ) . Disposal of expired stock must be witnessed by a designated inspector ( either a local drug @-@ enforcement police officer or official from health authority ) . Benzodiazepine abuse ranges from occasional binges on large doses , to chronic and compulsive drug abuse of high doses . 
 Benzodiazepines are used recreationally and by problematic drug misusers . Mortality is higher among poly @-@ drug misusers that also use benzodiazepines . Heavy alcohol use also increases mortality among poly @-@ drug users . Dependence and tolerance , often coupled with dosage escalation , to benzodiazepines can develop rapidly among drug misusers ; withdrawal syndrome may appear after as little as three weeks of continuous use . Long @-@ term use has the potential to cause both physical and psychological dependence and severe withdrawal symptoms such as depression , anxiety ( often to the point of panic attacks ) , and agoraphobia . Benzodiazepines and , in particular , temazepam are sometimes used intravenously , which , if done incorrectly or in an unsterile manner , can lead to medical complications including abscesses , cellulitis , thrombophlebitis , arterial puncture , deep vein thrombosis , and gangrene . Sharing syringes and needles for this purpose also brings up the possibility of transmission of hepatitis , HIV , and other diseases . Benzodiazepines are also misused intranasally , which may have additional health consequences . Once benzodiazepine dependence has been established , a clinician usually converts the patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam before beginning a gradual reduction program . 
 A 1999 – 2005 Australian police survey of detainees reported preliminary findings that self @-@ reported users of benzodiazepines were less likely than non @-@ user detainees to work full @-@ time and more likely to receive government benefits , use methamphetamine or heroin , and be arrested or imprisoned . Benzodiazepines are sometimes used for criminal purposes ; they serve to incapacitate a victim in cases of drug assisted rape or robbery . 
 Overall , anecdotal evidence suggests that temazepam may be the most psychologically habit @-@ forming ( addictive ) benzodiazepine . Temazepam abuse reached epidemic proportions in some parts of the world , in particular , in Europe and Australia , and is a major drug of abuse in many Southeast Asian countries . This led authorities of various countries to place temazepam under a more restrictive legal status . Some countries , such as Sweden , banned the drug outright . Temazepam also has certain pharmacokinetic properties of absorption , distribution , elimination , and clearance that make it more apt to abuse compared to many other benzodiazepines .

 Benzodiazepines are used in veterinary practice in the treatment of various disorders and conditions . As in humans , they are used in the first @-@ line management of seizures , status epilepticus , and tetanus , and as maintenance therapy in epilepsy ( in particular , in cats ) .

 Claire Hale Underwood is a fictional character in House of Cards , played by Robin Wright . She is the wife of the show 's protagonist Francis J. " Frank " Underwood . She is a lobbyist and runs an environmental nonprofit organization , but in later seasons ascends to the position of Second Lady of the United States , and finally First Lady of the United States and the United States Ambassador to the United Nations . Underwood made her first appearance in the series ' pilot episode , " Chapter 1 " . The character is based on Elizabeth Urquhart , a character from the British miniseries from which the current series is derived . Unlike the original character , however , Claire has her own storylines . 
 The role has been critically acclaimed . Wright won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama for this role at the 71st Golden Globe Awards , becoming the first actress to win a Golden Globe Award for a web television online @-@ only role in a series . She was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for this role at the 65th , 66th and 67th Primetime Emmy Awards .

 Claire Hale Underwood is originally from the exclusive Highland Park enclave of Dallas , Texas . Her late father was a major Texas Republican . While at Radcliffe College in Cambridge , she met a Harvard Law student from South Carolina . That student was Francis J. Underwood . She is of wealthy background and the show characterizes her as a " Dallas Debutante " and " Lily White " . She recounts her father taking her to Dealey Plaza , where John F. Kennedy was assassinated , and that she felt “ so sad , so angry . ” She has a difficult relationship with her mother , Elizabeth Hale ( Ellen Burstyn ) , who despises Frank and is disappointed in Claire for marrying him . 
 Brian Stelter of The New York Times described her as Frank Underwood 's conniving wife and described the Underwoods as " the scheming husband and wife at the center of ' House of Cards ' " . She is a woman " who will stop at nothing to conquer everything " . Hank Stuever of The Washington Post describes her as an " ice @-@ queen wife " . The Independent 's Sarah Hughes echoes this description , saying she is so dedicated to the couple 's schemes that it is clear she will execute them herself if Frank wavers . Following season 4 , Robin Wright stated that she felt Claire Underwood was the equal of Frank Underwood and demanded equal pay for her performance . Netflix acquiesced .

 While Frank is Machiavellian , Claire presents a woman urging on her husband 's assertion of power in the image of Lady Macbeth . She encourages his vices while noting her disapproval of his weaknesses , saying " My husband doesn ’ t apologize ... even to me . " This gives a credibility to their symbiosis . 
 Willimon notes that , " What 's extraordinary about Frank and Claire is there is deep love and mutual respect , but the way they achieve this is by operating on a completely different set of rules than the rest of us typically do . " 
 Nancy deWolf Smith of The Wall Street Journal describes Claire as " a short @-@ haired blonde who manages to be masculine and <unk> at the same time . " Smith describes their relationship as pivotal to the show : " Benign though they may seem — and their harmless air is what makes the Underwoods so effective as political plotters — this is a power couple with the same malignant chemistry as pairs of serial killers , where each needs the other in order to become lethal " . 
 Upon viewing a four episode preview of season 2 , Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter says the series " ... sells husband and wife power @-@ at @-@ all @-@ costs couple Frank ( Kevin Spacey ) and Claire ( Robin Wright ) Underwood as a little too oily and reptilian for anyone 's good . " Los Angeles Times critic Mary McNamara makes the case that House of Cards is a love story on many levels but most importantly between Frank and Claire .
