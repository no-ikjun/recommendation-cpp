 Liz is seeking closure after breaking up with her boyfriend Floyd during the summer and a chance encounter with Seinfeld gives her the advice she needs , so she calls Floyd only for another woman to pick up the phone . While dealing with her problems , Liz and Jenna are invited to be Cerie 's maids of honour . They accept the invitation .

 It was announced , by Fey and executive producer Lorne Michaels , at the annual Television Critics Association tour in July 2007 that Jerry Seinfeld would be appearing in the season premiere of 30 Rock . Seinfeld had only appeared in two television acting roles since his own sitcom ended in 1998 . Those roles were in Mad About You and Newsradio . 
 The scenes featuring Jerry Seinfeld were filmed on August 20 , 2007 . Seinfeld wore a wig in the episode to make him look more like the character version of Jerry Seinfeld . Upon first wearing the wig , Seinfeld said " This looks weird , " but his wife assured him that " That 's what [ he ] looked like [ in Seinfeld ] . " This episode effectively ended the story arc of Liz 's relationship with Floyd , which began mid @-@ way through season one . There was a joke in this episode in which Cerie 's surname was revealed as Xerox , but the joke was cut . This is the first episode in which Katrina Bowden ( as Cerie ) , Keith Powell ( James " Toofer " Spurlock ) and Lonny Ross ( Josh Girard ) receive star billing . 
 = = Reception = = 
 " SeinfeldVision " brought in an average of 7 @.@ 33 million American viewers , making 30 Rock the sixtieth most watched series of the week . When it first aired , this episode was the second highest @-@ rated episode of the series , after " Pilot " , which garnered 8 @.@ 13 million viewers . This episode achieved a 3 @.@ 4 / 9 in the key 18 – 49 demographic , a series high in that category .

 Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly wrote that " SeinfeldVision was a clever and ironic way to incorporate Seinfeld . " Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide said that " [ ' SeinfeldVision ' ] was a solid start to the new , fought @-@ for season " and that it did have " some great , great moments . " Despite this praise , Webb Mitovich criticised Kenneth and Tracy 's " office wife " storyline saying that " we 've seen this shtick before on countless other sitcoms , so it was a bit empty and filled with ' easy ' jokes . " Criticism was also received regarding the " striped outfit ... it didn 't work . No , " referring to a joke involving Jenna trying to distract the TGS writers from her newly gained weight . Lisa <unk> of Television Without Pity graded this episode as a " B + . " Rick Porter of Zap2it thought that this episode " started off [ 30 Rock 's ] second season on a pretty strong note . " Porter said that this episode wasn 't the best episode of 30 Rock but it was still " one of the sharpest and wittiest comedies on television . " Bob Sassone of AOL 's TV Squad wrote that " SeinfeldVision " " was a really funny beginning to the second season . " Sassone also notes that the appearance of Seinfeld did not feel like stunt casting . He also said that the joke about Jerry being able to buy NBC for $ 4 million was " one of the many reasons [ he , Sassone , loves ] this show . " Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette wrote that this episode " proves the low @-@ rated show 's best comedy Emmy win was no undeserved fluke . " Alan Sepinwall of The Star @-@ Ledger described this episode as " really funny " and thought that " everyone is played in a style that 's believable within [ the series ] . " Linda Stasi of The New York Post said that " the on @-@ going story of the regulars that had me laughing so hard I almost fell out of bed . " Jake Brooks of The New York Observer thought that this episode was " a rather poor 22 minutes of television ( well , only [ Jerry Seinfeld 's ] portion of it , the rest was pretty great ) . " Robert Canning of IGN said that " 30 Rock delivers a fantastic episode to open the season . Let 's hope they can also deliver an audience to keep this great show on the air . " Canning also awarded this episode a rating of 9 @.@ 4 out of 10 . Brian Lowry of Variety said that it " neatly highlights this series ' strengths and weaknesses , elevated by moments of inspiration and Alec Baldwin 's brilliance and leavened by considerably @-@ less @-@ flattering silliness . " Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times thought that " SeinfeldVision " " is mostly a reminder that even the most talented actors and writers sometimes slip under pressure . " Seinfeld was criticized as using his appearance in this episode as a plug for his upcoming feature film Bee Movie . Seinfeld , NBC and General Electric stated that this was done as <unk> . 
 = Spanish battleship Alfonso XIII = 
 Alfonso XIII was a Spanish dreadnought battleship , the second member of the España class . She had two sister ships , España and Jaime I. Alfonso XIII was built by the SECN shipyard ; she was laid down in February 1910 , launched in May 1913 , and completed in August 1915 . Named after King Alfonso XIII of Spain , she was renamed España in 1931 after the king was exiled following the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic . The new name was the namesake of her earlier sister ship , the España that served in the Spanish fleet from 1913 to 1923 . 
 Alfonso XIII served in the Spanish fleet from 1915 to 1937 . Spain remained neutral during World War I , and so Alfonso XIII and her sisters were the only European dreadnoughts to avoid the war . She and her sisters participated in the Rif War , where they provided gunfire support to Spanish Army forces . The ship was seized by General Francisco Franco at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War . While steaming off Santander on 30 April 1937 , she struck a mine and sank ; most of her crew was taken off by the destroyer Velasco . 
 = = Technical characteristics = = 
 Alfonso XIII was 132 @.@ 6 m ( 435 ft ) long at the waterline and 140 m ( 460 ft ) long overall . She had a beam of 24 m ( 79 ft ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 8 m ( 26 ft ) ; her freeboard was 15 ft ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) amidships . Her propulsion system consisted of four @-@ shaft Parsons steam turbines and twelve Yarrow boilers . The engines were rated at 15 @,@ 500 shaft horsepower ( 11 @,@ 600 kW ) and produced a top speed of 19 @.@ 5 knots ( 36 @.@ 1 km / h ; 22 @.@ 4 mph ) . Alfonso XIII had a cruising radius of 5 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 9 @,@ 300 km ; 5 @,@ 800 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Her crew consisted of 854 officers and enlisted men . 
 Alfonso XIII was armed with a main battery of eight 305 mm ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) / 50 guns , mounted in four twin gun turrets . One turret was placed forward , two were positioned en echelon amidships , and the fourth was aft of the superstructure . This mounting scheme was chosen in preference to superimposed turrets , as was done in the South Carolinas , to save weight and cost . Her secondary battery consisted of twenty 102 mm ( 4 @.@ 0 in ) guns mounted in casemates along the length of the hull . They were too close to the waterline , however , which made them unusable in heavy seas . She was also armed with four 3 @-@ pounder guns and two machine guns . Her armored belt was 203 mm ( 8 @.@ 0 in ) thick amidships ; the main battery turrets were protected with the same amount of armor plate . The conning tower had 254 mm ( 10 @.@ 0 in ) thick sides . Her armored deck was 38 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) thick . 
 = = Operational history = = 
 Alfonso XIII was laid down at the Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval shipyard in Ferrol on 23 February 1910 . She was launched on 7 May 1913 , and completed on 16 August 1915 . After their completion , Alfonso XIII and her sisters , España and Jaime I , the three battleships formed the 1st Squadron of the Spanish fleet . Spain remained neutral after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , so Alfonso XIII and her sisters were the only European dreadnoughts to avoid the war . In August 1917 , Alfonso XIII assisted in the suppression of general strikes in Vizcaya and Bilbao . After the end of the war , Alfonso XIII conducted cruises to show the flag , including a visit to Annapolis , Maryland , in 1920 , during which USS Reina Mercedes , a former Spanish Navy cruiser captured by the United States during the Spanish – American War in 1898 , flew the Spanish flag to honor her visit . 
 Throughout the early 1920s , she provided fire support to the Spanish Army in its campaigns in Morocco during the Rif War . On 17 September 1921 , she and España bombarded Rif positions south of Melilla while Spanish Foreign Legion troops assaulted the positions . In August 1923 , she participated in the first aerial , naval , and land combined arms operation in Spanish military history . In September 1925 , she provided fire support for the Al Hoceima landings , a decisive Franco @-@ Spanish operation ; there , she served as the flagship of the Spanish naval contingent . 
 In April 1931 , after the advent of the Second Spanish Republic , Alfonso XIII became part of the Spanish Republican Navy and was renamed España , the name previously held by her sister ship España , which had been wrecked in 1923 while engaged in combat operations at Cape Tres Forcas . By 1934 , the renamed España was laid up at Ferrol awaiting disposal . That year , the Spanish Navy considered rebuilding the ship and Jaime I into analogues to the German Deutschland @-@ class cruisers , with new oil @-@ fired boilers . The ships ' hulls would have been lengthened , and the main battery turrets rearranged so they would all be on the centerline . The ships ' secondary batteries would have been replaced with dual @-@ purpose 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) guns . The plan was nevertheless abandoned . In 1936 , the Navy again proposed a modernization for the two ships . It was a less radical plan , and called for additional anti @-@ aircraft guns , modern fire control equipment , oil @-@ fired boilers , and an increase to the elevation of the main guns . 
 At the time of General Francisco Franco 's coup in July 1936 the battleship was still laid up in Ferrol . As detachments of the army , including some coastal artillery units around the harbor , sided with Franco 's Nationalists , sailors who supported the Republican government took control of the ship with the intent of resisting the coup . Along with the crew of the cruiser Almirante Cervera , España engaged in an artillery duel with the shore batteries and the Nationalist @-@ controlled destroyer Velasco . The engagement lasted several days and resulted in considerable destruction in the harbor , while Velasco was also heavily damaged before the crews of España and Almirante Cervera were convinced to surrender . España was then refitted and fought on the Nationalist side in the Spanish Civil War , operating as part of a naval task force along with Almirante Cervera and Velasco , which captured or drove back a number of Republican and foreign merchant ships . España seized the Republican freighter Mar <unk> with a cargo of iron ore on 13 February 1937 , and on 30 April she prevented the entry of the British steamer Consett to Santander by firing her main guns across the freighter 's bows . According to Nationalist sources the Consett and other blockade @-@ runners were escorted at the time by the destroyer HMS Forester . Later that day the España accidentally struck a mine laid by her own side and sank three hours later off the coast near Santander , while assisting the destroyer Velasco in turning away the British merchantman <unk> . While the ship was sinking , Republican aircraft attacked her . All her crew , with the exception of five seamen , were rescued by the Velasco .

 Friedrich Hans Ulrich Mühe ( German : [ <unk> <unk> ] ; 20 June 1953 – 22 July 2007 ) was a German film , television and theatre actor . He played the role of Hauptmann ( Captain ) Gerd Wiesler in the Oscar @-@ winning film Das Leben der Anderen ( The Lives of Others , 2006 ) , for which he received the gold award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role , at the Deutscher Filmpreis ( German Film Awards ) ; and the Best Actor Award at the 2006 European Film Awards . 
 After leaving school , Mühe was employed as a construction worker and a border guard at the Berlin Wall . He then turned to acting , and from the late 1970s into the 1980s appeared in numerous plays , becoming a star of the Deutsches Theater in East Berlin . He was active in politics and denounced Communist rule in East Germany in a memorable address at the Alexanderplatz demonstration on 4 November 1989 shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall . After German reunification he continued to appear in a large number of films , television programmes and theatre productions . In Germany he was particularly known for playing the lead role of Dr. Robert <unk> in the long @-@ running forensic crime series Der letzte Zeuge ( The Last Witness , 1998 – 2007 ) . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 The son of a furrier , Mühe was born on 20 June 1953 in <unk> , Saxony , in the German Democratic Republic ( East Germany ) . After leaving school he trained as a construction worker , then did compulsory military service in the Nationale Volksarmee ( National People 's Army ) as a border guard at the Berlin Wall . He was relieved of duty after contracting stomach ulcers ; a number of commentators have said that this was due to stress , and also suggested that it marked the beginnings of the stomach cancer that would eventually lead to his death . 
 He then turned to acting , and studied at the Hans Otto <unk> in Leipzig from 1975 to 1979 . He appeared in his first professional stage role in 1979 , as <unk> in Ibsen 's <unk> fra <unk> ( The Lady from the Sea ) at the <unk> Theater in Karl @-@ Marx @-@ Stadt ( now Chemnitz ) . He followed this by appearing in a production of Macbeth by playwright and director Heiner Müller at the <unk> in East Berlin . 
 = = Career = = 
 In 1983 at Müller 's invitation he joined the ensemble of East Berlin 's Deutsches Theater , and became its star due to his versatility in comic and serious roles , appearing in productions such as Goethe 's Egmont ( 1986 ) , Ibsen 's Peer Gynt and Lessing 's Nathan der Weise ( Nathan the Wise , 1988 ) . He took the lead role of Hamlet in both Shakespeare 's play and Heiner Müller 's Die <unk> ( <unk> , 1989 ) . Mühe later said : " Theatre was the only place in the GDR where people weren 't lied to . For us actors it was an island . We could dare to criticise . " On screen , he co @-@ starred with his second wife Jenny Gröllmann in Herman <unk> 's film <unk> des Lebens ( Half of Life , 1984 ) about the German lyric poet Friedrich Hölderlin ( 1770 – 1843 ) . 
 Mühe played a leading role in organizing the demonstrations that took place prior to the reunification of Germany . He often gave public readings from Walter Jenka 's essay <unk> mit der Wahrheit ( Difficulties with the Truth , 1989 ) at the Deutsches Theater , before the book was permitted to be published in East Germany . On 4 November 1989 shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall , in front of half a million people during the Alexanderplatz demonstration , he declared the Communists ' monopoly on power to be invalid . In the same year he became internationally known after playing , next to Armin Mueller @-@ Stahl and Klaus Maria Brandauer , the leading role in Bernhard Wicki 's Das <unk> ( The Spider 's Web , based on the expressionist , fragmentary novel of the same name by Austrian writer Joseph Roth ) right @-@ wing lieutenant Lohse who sleeps and murders his way to professional success in the early Weimar Republic following a near fatal injury during the Wilhelmshaven mutiny of 29 October 1918 . 
 After German reunification he continued to appear in a large number of films , television programmes and theatre productions in Germany and abroad . He proved his ability to take on comic roles in Schtonk ! ( 1991 ) , an Oscar @-@ nominated satire about the Hitler Diaries hoax , and showed his more serious side in Michael Haneke 's Benny 's Video ( 1992 ) , Das Schloss ( The Castle , 1996 ) ( an adaptation of Kafka 's The Castle ( 1922 ) ) and Funny Games ( 1997 ) . In the latter film , Mühe and his third wife Susanne Lothar played a husband and wife held captive in their holiday cabin by two psychotic young men who force them to play sadistic " games " with one another . 
 In the 2000s Mühe played a series of Nazis . He portrayed Joseph Goebbels in Goebbels und <unk> ( Goebbels and <unk> , 2001 ) ; Dr. Josef Mengele in Amen . ( 2002 ) , a film by Costa Gavras ; and was to have played Klaus Barbie in an upcoming feature . His last film was the comedy Mein Führer – Die <unk> <unk> Wahrheit über Adolf Hitler ( My Führer : The Truly <unk> Truth about Adolf Hitler , 2007 ) , in which he played Prof. Adolf Israel <unk> , an actor hired to give Hitler lessons . 
 In 2006 he appeared at the Barbican Arts Centre in London in <unk> , Thomas <unk> 's German production of Sarah Kane 's <unk> , playing a middle @-@ aged journalist whose encounter with a young girl leads to pandemonium in a Leeds hotel room . 
 Mühe was also well known in Germany for playing the brilliant but eccentric pathologist Dr. Robert <unk> in 73 episodes of the forensic crime serial Der letzte Zeuge ( The Last Witness , 1998 – 2007 ) , for which he was awarded the prize for <unk> / r <unk> / in in einer Serie ( Best Actor or Actress in a TV Series ) at the Deutscher <unk> ( German Television Awards ) in 2005 . 
 = = The Lives of Others , and later life = = 
 To English @-@ speaking audiences , Mühe was probably best known for portraying Hauptmann ( Captain ) Gerd Wiesler in Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck 's Das Leben der Anderen ( The Lives of Others , 2006 ) , which won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2007 . The film is set in the mid @-@ 1980s , and Wiesler is a Stasi agent who is assigned to bug and conduct surveillance of the apartment of an East German playwright , Georg <unk> ( Sebastian Koch ) , and his girlfriend , the actress Christa @-@ Maria <unk> ( Martina <unk> ) . However , he becomes disillusioned about the necessity of monitoring the couple for national security reasons after discovering that the government minister who ordered the surveillance did so for sexual rather than political motives . Gradually , Wiesler 's heart moves from contempt and envy to compassion . For his performance , in 2006 Mühe received , among other things , the <unk> <unk> <unk> – <unk> <unk> ( Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role ) , Gold , at Germany 's most prestigious film awards , the Deutscher Filmpreis ( German Film Awards ) ; and the Best Actor Award at the European Film Awards . 
 The <unk> zur <unk> der SED @-@ <unk> ( Federal Foundation for the <unk> of the SED Dictatorship , known in short as " Stiftung <unk> " ) , the government @-@ funded organization tasked with examining and reappraising East Germany 's Communist dictatorship , said of Mühe : " Through his impressive performance ... Ulrich Mühe sensitized an audience of millions to the Stasi 's machinations and their consequences . " The statement added that Mühe had been an active and valued participant in the foundation 's events . 
 Mühe was already seriously ill at the prize @-@ giving ceremony in Los Angeles in February 2007 when Das Leben der Anderen was awarded its Oscar , and flew back to Germany hours later for an urgent stomach operation . In an article in Die Welt dated 21 July 2007 , Mühe discussed his diagnosis of stomach cancer which had put his acting career on hold ; he died the following day . On 25 July 2007 he was buried in his mother 's village of Walbeck in the Landkreis ( rural district ) of <unk> , Saxony @-@ Anhalt . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Mühe was married three times . He was first married to dramaturge Annegret Hahn and had two sons by her : Andreas , a Berlin @-@ based photographer , and Konrad , a painter . His second marriage was in 1984 to the actress Jenny Gröllmann , after they fell in love while acting together in the TV film Die <unk> ( The <unk> ) in that year . Mühe and Gröllmann had a daughter , Anna Maria Mühe , who is also an actress , and he was stepfather to Gröllmann 's daughter Jeanne , a make @-@ up artist . 
 After German reunification , Mühe allegedly discovered evidence in his Stasi file that he had been under surveillance not only by four of his fellow actors in the East Berlin theatre , but also by his wife Gröllmann . The file held detailed records of meetings that Gröllmann , who was registered as an " <unk> <unk> " ( unofficial collaborator ) , had with her controller from 1979 to 1989 . This mirrored the plot of Das Leben der Anderen as in the film pressure exerted by the Stasi on the playwright 's girlfriend makes her betray him as the author of an exposé of covered @-@ up GDR suicide rates . Mühe and Gröllmann divorced in 1990 . In a book accompanying the film , Mühe spoke about the sense of betrayal he felt when he found out about his former wife 's alleged Stasi role . However , Gröllmann 's real @-@ life controller later claimed he had made up many of the details in the file and that the actress had been unaware that she was speaking to a Stasi agent . After a highly public and acrimonious battle in the courts , Gröllmann , who died in August 2006 , won an injunction preventing the book 's publication . Mühe 's response when asked how he prepared for his role in Das Leben der Anderen was , " I remembered . " 
 At the time of his death , Mühe was married to his third wife , stage actress Susanne Lothar , and living in Berlin with her and their two children , Sophie Marie and Jakob . Mühe and Lothar starred together in Mühe 's last film , Nemesis ( 2010 ) , which deals with a couple 's troubled relationship . However , Lothar , who died in 2012 , launched a lawsuit to block the film from release for nearly three years , apparently because she felt that it would cast the couple in a bad light .

 The Great Zab or Upper Zab ( Arabic : <unk> الكبير ( al @-@ <unk> al @-@ Kabīr ) , Kurdish : <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , Turkish : Zap , Syriac : <unk> <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) ) is an approximately 400 @-@ kilometre ( 250 mi ) long river flowing through Turkey and Iraq . It rises in Turkey near Lake Van and joins the Tigris in Iraq south of Mosul . The drainage basin of the Great Zab covers approximately 40 @,@ 300 square kilometres ( 15 @,@ 600 sq mi ) , and during its course , the rivers collects the water from many tributaries . The river and its tributaries are primarily fed by rainfall and snowmelt – as a result of which discharge fluctuates highly throughout the year . At least six dams have been planned on the Great Zab and its tributaries , but construction of only one , the Bekhme Dam , has commenced but was halted after the Gulf War . 
 The Zagros Mountains have been occupied since at least the Lower Palaeolithic , and Neanderthal occupation of the Great Zab basin has been testified at the archaeological site of Shanidar Cave . Historical records for the region are available from the end of the third millennium BCE onward . In the Neo @-@ Assyrian period , the Great Zab provided water for irrigation for the lands around the capital city of Nimrud . The Battle of the Zab – which ended the Umayyad Caliphate – took place near a tributary of the Great Zab , and the valleys of the river provided shelter for refugees from the Mongol conquest of Iraq . During the 19th and 20th centuries , the Great Zab basin saw frequent uprisings of local Kurdish tribes striving for autonomy . 
 = = Course = = 
 The Great Zab rises in Turkey in the mountainous region east of Lake Van at an elevation of approximately 3 @,@ 000 metres ( 9 @,@ 800 ft ) <unk> and joins the Tigris on its left bank in Iraq . In Turkey , the Great Zab traverses the provinces of Van and Hakkâri , whereas in Iraq it flows through Duhok Governorate and Erbil Governorate , both part of the Kurdistan Region . Together with the Tigris , the Great Zab forms the boundary between Erbil Governorate and <unk> Governorate . In its upper reaches , the Great Zab flows through steep , rocky gorges . The stretch between Amadiya and the Bekhme Gorge , where the Bekhme Dam remains unfinished , has been called the Sapna valley and will have a large portion of it inundated with water if the project is completed . Numerous mountain streams and wadis join the Great Zab on its right and left banks . The Great Zab receives most of its waters from the left @-@ bank tributaries ; the <unk> @-@ i @-@ Shin , <unk> , <unk> @-@ i @-@ <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> Chai . 
 The length of the Great Zab has been variously estimated at 392 kilometres ( 244 mi ) and 473 kilometres ( 294 mi ) . Approximately 300 kilometres ( 190 mi ) of the river 's course are located within Iraq . The average discharge of the Great Zab is 419 cubic metres ( 14 @,@ 800 cu ft ) per second , but peak discharges of up to 1 @,@ 320 cubic metres ( 47 @,@ 000 cu ft ) per second have been recorded . The average annual discharge is 13 @.@ 2 cubic kilometres ( 3 @.@ 2 cu mi ) . Because of its torrential nature , Medieval Arab geographers have described the Great Zab – together with the Little Zab – as " <unk> possessed " .

 Estimates of the drainage basin of the Great Zab vary widely – from a low 25 @,@ 810 square kilometres ( 9 @,@ 970 sq mi ) to a high figure of 40 @,@ 300 square kilometres ( 15 @,@ 600 sq mi ) . Approximately 62 percent of the basin is located in Iraq ; the remainder is in Turkey . To the south , the Great Zab basin borders on that of the Little Zab while on the east it adjoins the Tigris basin . The Zagros consists of parallel limestone folds rising to elevations of over 3 @,@ 000 metres ( 9 @,@ 800 ft ) <unk> . The valleys – including that of the Great Zab – and the south @-@ western foothill zone are filled with gravel , conglomerate , and sandstone ; the result of water erosion . The Amadiya valley within the Great Zab drainage basin is the third @-@ largest valley in the Iraqi Zagros , after the <unk> and the <unk> Plain . 
 The Great Zab rises in the highlands of the Zagros Mountains , where a climate with cold winter and annual precipitation in excess of 1 @,@ 000 millimetres ( 39 in ) prevails . From there , the river flows into the foothill zone of the Zagros , where rainfall drops to less than 300 millimetres ( 12 in ) per year at the confluence with the Tigris . Average summer temperature in the foothill zone are generally higher in the foothill zone than in the mountains . The high Zagros is characterized by three different ecozones : the area above the treeline at 1 @,@ 800 metres ( 5 @,@ 900 ft ) where shrubs and herbs dominate , the area between 1 @,@ 800 and 610 metres ( 5 @,@ 910 and 2 @,@ 000 ft ) that was in the past dominated by open oak forest ( Quercus <unk> ) , and the wetter and sometimes marshy river valleys . Other trees besides oak that can be found in the forested zone including juniper at higher elevations ; ash , hawthorn , maple and walnut at intermediate elevations ; and pistachio and olive trees in lower , drier areas . In the foothill zone , many areas are now cultivated , but there remain small patches of natural vegetation dominated by herbs of the genus <unk> .

 To date , one large dam has been partially constructed on the Great Zab : Iraq 's Bekhme Dam and Turkey 's 24 MW weir @-@ controlled run @-@ of @-@ the @-@ river <unk> Hydroelectric Power Plant . Five others have been planned in the Great Zab basin by both Turkey and Iraq . Turkey 's State Hydraulic Works plans to construct the Çukurca and <unk> Dams near Çukurca and the Hakkâri Dam near the city of Hakkâri . The Hakkâri Dam with a 245 MW power station is in final design and the Çukurca and <unk> Dams will support 245 MW and 462 MW power stations , respectively . 
 Iraq has commenced construction of the Bekhme and <unk> Dams and planned two others – the Khazir @-@ Gomel and <unk> Dams . Plans to build a dam in the Great Zab at the Bekhme Gorge for flood control and irrigation were first proposed in 1937 . A feasibility study determined that the site was not suited for dam construction and the plan was abandoned . In 1976 , another study proposed three different locations on the Great Zab , including the site suggested in the earlier study . This site was eventually chosen in 1989 , when work on the dam commenced . Construction of the Bekhme Dam was interrupted by the outbreak of the Gulf War in 1990 and the dam remains unfinished . After the war , the site of the dam was looted . The plans of the Bekhme Dam called for a 230 @-@ metre ( 750 ft ) high rockfill dam and an underground hydroelectric power station housing six turbines with a total capacity of 1 @,@ 560 MW . The reservoir that would have been created by the Bekhme Dam would have a storage capacity of 17 cubic kilometres ( 4 @.@ 1 cu mi ) and would have flooded numerous villages , the archaeological site of Zawi Chemi Shanidar and the access road to Shanidar Cave ( although not the cave itself ) .

 Evidence for human occupation of the Zagros reaches back into the Lower Palaeolithic , as evidenced by the discovery of many cave @-@ sites dating to that period in the Iranian part of the mountain range . Middle Palaeolithic stone tool assemblages are known from Barda <unk> , a cave @-@ site south of the Little Zab ; and from the Iranian Zagros . A Mousterian stone tool assemblage – produced by either Neanderthals or anatomically modern humans – was recently excavated in Arbil . Neanderthals also occupied the site of Shanidar . This cave @-@ site , located in the Sapna Valley , has yielded a settlement sequence stretching from the Middle Palaeolithic up to the <unk> period . The site is particularly well known for its Neanderthal burials . The <unk> occupation of Shanidar , contemporary with the use of the <unk> stone tool assemblage , is the oldest evidence for anatomically modern human occupation of the Great Zab basin . The following <unk> , or Natufian , occupation is contemporary with the oldest occupation of the nearby open @-@ air site Zawi Chemi Shanidar . M <unk> on the Khazir River ( a tributary to the Great Zab ) was a small village of hunter @-@ gatherers dating to the 10th millennium BCE that was contemporary with the Pre @-@ Pottery Neolithic A in the Levant . An archaeological survey of the Citadel of Arbil , in the plain south of the lower course of the Great Zab , has shown that this site was continuously occupied at least from the 6th millennium BCE upward . 
 The earliest historical reference to the region dates to the Ur III dynasty , when king <unk> mentioned the city of <unk> – the ancient name of modern @-@ day Arbil . The great Assyrian capitals of Assur , Nineveh , Nimrud and Dur @-@ Sharrukin were all located in the foothill zone where the Great Zab flows into the Tigris , and the Great Zab basin became increasingly integrated into the Middle Assyrian and Neo @-@ Assyrian empires . Nimrud , the capital of the empire until 706 BCE , was located only 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) away from the confluence of the Great Zab with the Tigris . The Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II constructed a canal called Patti @-@ <unk> that tapped water from the Great Zab to irrigate the land around Nimrud , and this canal was restored by his successors Tiglath @-@ Pileser III and Esarhaddon . This canal ran along the right bank of the Great Zab and cut through a rock bluff by means of a tunnel and is still visible today . After the fall of the Neo @-@ Assyrian empire , the Medes gained control of the area , followed by the Achaemenids in 550 BCE . The Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BCE – one of the decisive battles leading to the fall of the Achaemenid empire at the hands of Alexander the Great – supposedly took place north of the Great Zab in the vicinity of Mosul . After Alexander ’ s death in 323 BCE , control of the area shifted to the Seleucids . 
 In 750 CE , the last Umayyad caliph Marwan II was defeated by the Abbasid As @-@ Saffah in the Battle of the Zab on the banks of the Khazir River , a tributary to the Great Zab . When the Mongols swept over Iraq in the 13th century and sacked Arbil , many survivors sought a refuge in the inaccessible valleys of the Great Zab . The Sapna Valley was home to both Christian and Muslim communities , as evidenced by Christian artefacts found at Zawi Chemi Shanidar . During the 19th century , the area was controlled by local Kurdish leaders . During World War I , heavy fighting took place in the area , and <unk> was pillaged by Russian soldiers in 1916 . Following World War I , episodes of heavy fighting took place between the <unk> tribe – striving for the establishment of an independent Kurdish polity – and several other Kurdish tribes , and between the <unk> and the Iraqi Government . The last of these uprisings started in 1974 and led to heavy bombardments of towns and villages in the Great Zab basin . 
 = Glenwood Generating Station = 
 Glenwood Generating Station is a power station in Glenwood Landing , New York owned by National Grid plc . It is mainly known for being the former site of an architecturally significant 1920s brick power station . That building and an adjacent 1950s station were demolished over the course of 2013 to 2015 , due to their obsolescence as well as the excessive cost of safely retaining the building given its poor condition . Two smaller generators constructed in 2002 remain in operation . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 Station 2 was constructed in the 1920s and considered significant as a rare surviving example of early 20th @-@ century industrial architecture . It was designed in an industrial Beaux @-@ Arts style , with large arched windows and stringcourse intended to prevent it from becoming an eyesore given its proximity to affluent communities . It was constructed with Flemish bond brickwork and decorative limestone elements . It was also constructed to minimize noise and ash pollution . Buildings with such architectural detail were usually found in urban areas , making the Glenwood plant unusual for being far from urban areas at the time of its construction . The building was divided into three sections : a narrow four @-@ story administration section to the north containing offices ; a five @-@ story turbine room containing a large open space with decorated glazed buff brick walls ; and a six @-@ story boiler house mainly filled with equipment , topped by six 140 @-@ foot smoke stacks ( ultimately reaching 265 feet above the floor slab ) . At the time of its demolition the New York State Office of Parks , Recreation and Historic Preservation determined that it appeared to meet the criteria for listing on the National Register of Historic Places , triggering an alternative use analysis . Given the building 's poor condition after three decades of disuse , the excessive cost of making the building structurally sound prevented any plans to retain or renovate it .

 = = = Construction and early history = = = 
 The first facility on the site was Station 1 , constructed in 1906 and expanded during World War I , which existed until at least 1939 . The Station 2 building was constructed from 1928 to 1931 by the Nassau Power and Light Company , a predecessor of the Long Island Lighting Company ( LILCO ) . The extra generating capacity was needed due to a sixfold increase in Long Island 's electricity demand from 1910 to 1925 . The expansion also reflected LILCO 's then @-@ novel philosophy of using few centralized power plants interconnected by transmission lines , rather than many small plants distributed through the region . In 1936 it was described as " the key electric generating plant of the Long Island system , " and its control room managed LILCO 's entire system . In 1939 it was upgraded to burn both coal and oil , and in 1946 natural gas capability was added . 
 In 1942 , a 3 @-@ hour power outage caused by testing of new distribution circuits affected seven major factories producing material for World War II . These included the Grumman plant in Bethpage and the Republic Aviation plant in Farmingdale , where workers staged an impromptu baseball game while they waited for power to return . Local hospitals and Mitchel Field were able to continue operating under auxiliary power . Although sabotage was not suspected , it caused the colonel in charge of civilian protection for Nassau County to request that the Army guard the power station . 
 The two units of Station 3 became operational in 1952 and 1954 . At the time The New York Times called it " one of the most modern power plants in the country , " with both mechanical and electrostatic precipitators for dust and ash collection , as well as valve silencers and noise barriers . It was the first turbine generator mounted on an open deck in the Northeastern United States . An identical unit was constructed in Far Rockaway , Queens in 1953 . 
 = = = Later history = = = 
 In 1972 , the Town of Oyster Bay board unanimously denied LILCO a permit to further expand the plant with five 50 MW gas turbines , citing air @-@ quality concerns and the effects of the 1970s energy crisis . Town Supervisor John W. Burke at the time noted the board 's recognition that " in view of the fuel shortage , construction of gas turbines just seems out of step with the direction being taken by the average consumer , who lowers his thermostat and wears a sweater in his home to reduce the amount of fuel burning . " 
 The Station 2 generating units were taken out of operation in 1978 , but as late as 2009 the building was used for such purposes as a waste water treatment facility for the adjacent operational units , office and warehouse space , and transmission and fiber optic lines . 
 In 1998 , as part of a state @-@ brokered deal , LILCO 's power generation facilities , including the Glenwood plant , were absorbed into KeySpan Energy , with the public Long Island Power Authority ( LIPA ) taking over transmission and delivery functions . In 2001 , LIPA proposed building two mini @-@ turbines at Glenwood Landing as part of a plan to build ten such plants across Long Island to avoid the risk of rolling blackouts in the face of increased demand like those experienced in California the previous year . The pair of turbines produced 79 MW , just under an 80 MW threshold that would have triggered a full regulatory and environmental review . The new turbines were completed by May 2002 , and were the first of the ten to enter operation . 
 As a result of the 1998 deal , LIPA had an option to purchase KeySpan 's power plants outright before December 2005 . Just before the option expired , LIPA decided to purchase two plants in Far Rockaway and Oceanside with the intention of modernizing them , while there was no provision for immediate modernization of the remaining major plants in Glenwood Landing , Port Jefferson , and the Northport Power Station . KeySpan was acquired by National Grid in 2007 . 
 Station 3 's utilization decreased from 43 percent in 2001 to 11 @.@ 2 percent in 2005 . As of 2009 , the power station was used as a peaking power plant operating in the summer , with two operational natural gas steam @-@ electric generating units with a combined 210 MW capacity . It had a once @-@ through water cooling system using water from the adjacent Hempstead Harbor . By 2014 the Station 2 building had deteriorated to the point where it was nearing condemnation . 
 = = = Demolition = = = 
 In 2011 it was announced that the Glenwood Landing station would be shut down and demolished along its sister plant in Far Rockaway . The two stations were described as the oldest and least efficient of the power plants on Long Island , with the closures saving $ 76 million through 2015 . 
 Local resident Karin Barnaby campaigned to renovate Station 2 for commercial and cultural uses rather than demolish it , pointing to other redeveloped historic power plants in the United States such as the Pratt Street Power Plant in Baltimore and the Homan Square Power House in Chicago . Despite collecting 780 signatures for a petition , this was rejected due to the excessive cost of renovating the building given its poor condition . Demolition was estimated to cost $ 8 million , as opposed to $ 31 million to make the building structurally sound without improving it , and $ 100 million to renovate it into a mixed @-@ use development including an exhibition hall in the old turbine room . Using the building for new power generation capacity was deemed unfeasible because modern generation equipment was incompatible with the building design . 
 Demolition of the plant raised concern about the financial effects on the local North Shore School District , as the over $ 20 million annual tax payments from the plant provided 20 percent of the district 's budget . This led to fears of a 15 – 19 % increase in residential taxes in late 2014 . However , it was determined that according to state law there could be no more than a 1 % increase in property taxes for a given tax class as a result of a decreased tax assessment in another class ( the four tax classes being residential , cooperatives / condominiums , commercial , and utilities ) . The financial effects on the district would thus have to be mitigated by increased taxes on remaining utilities in the district , as well as a $ 2 @.@ 5 million one @-@ time grant from the state arranged by local state legislators . The site 's municipal and school payments in lieu of taxes fell from $ 23 @.@ 2 million in 2012 to $ 16 @.@ 6 million in 2015 . 
 Station 3 was demolished in November 2013 , and demolition of Station 2 was completed in 2015 . National Grid opted for a controlled deconstruction rather than an implosion or using a wrecking ball . The demolition of Station 2 required the relocation of a peregrine falcon nest from the top of one of the smoke stacks . After demolition and land remediation had been completed , the area was planned to be paved over with asphalt and offered to developers . Two gas @-@ turbine peaking generators , three electrical substations , three fuel tanks , and a water tower elsewhere on the site remain in operation . 
 = Milnrow = 
 Milnrow ( pop . 13 @,@ 062 ( 2011 ) ) is a suburban town within the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale , in Greater Manchester , England . It lies on the River Beal at the foothills of the South Pennines , and forms a continuous urban area with Rochdale . It is 1 @.@ 9 miles ( 3 @.@ 1 km ) east of Rochdale 's town centre , 10 @.@ 4 miles ( 16 @.@ 7 km ) north @-@ northeast of the city of Manchester , and spans urban , suburban and rural locations — from Windy Hill in the east through to the Rochdale Canal in the west . Milnrow includes the villages of Tunshill and Newhey , and is adjacent to junction 21 of the M62 motorway . 
 Historically a part of Lancashire , Milnrow during the Middle Ages was a hamlet located within the township of Butterworth and parish of Rochdale . It was named by the Anglo @-@ Saxons , but the Norman conquest of England resulted in its ownership by minor Norman families , such as the Schofields and Cleggs . In the 15th century , the descendants of these families successfully agitated for a chapel of ease to be constructed in Milnrow by the banks of the River Beal , triggering its development as the main settlement in Butterworth . Despite this distinction , Milnrow did not increase much further in size or population until the dawn of the woollen trade in the Late Middle Ages . 
 To supplement their income , the inhabitants of Milnrow entered the domestic system , producing flannel and woollen cloth in purpose @-@ built weavers ' cottages , some of which from the Early Modern period have survived as listed buildings . <unk> and metalworking also flourished in this period , but the Industrial Revolution supplanted the domestic industries and converted Milnrow into an urban mill town that mass @-@ produced textile goods in cotton mills , such as Ellenroad Ring Mill ( now a museum ) . The Milnrow Urban District was established in 1894 and was governed thereafter by its own district council until its abolition in 1974 . 
 Milnrow has been described as " the centre of the south Lancashire dialect " . John Collier ( who wrote under the pseudonym of Tim Bobbin ) was an acclaimed 18th @-@ century caricaturist and satirical poet from Milnrow who wrote in a broad Lancashire dialect . Rochdale @-@ born poet Edwin Waugh was influenced by Collier 's work , and wrote an extensive account of Milnrow during the mid @-@ 19th century in a tribute to Collier . Although Milnrow 's heavy textile industries declined during the mid @-@ 20th century , the town has continued to grow as a result of suburbanisation , urban renewal and its immediate proximity to road , rail and motorway networks . 
 = = History = = 
 Neolithic human activity in Milnrow is evidenced with an ancient stone axe found at Hollingworth . Bronze and Iron Age peoples left thousands of flint tools which have been found on the moorland surrounding Milnrow , including a stone hammer found at Low Hill in 1879 . Low Hill was the site of an ancient burial mound where a funerary urn was found . A small Roman statue of the goddess Victory was discovered at Tunshill Farm in 1793 . During excavations at Piethorne Reservoir in the mid @-@ 18th century , a Celtic spear @-@ head with a 5 @-@ inch ( 130 mm ) blade was unearthed , implying human habitation in the locality during the British Iron Age . <unk> evidence implies the presence of the Anglo @-@ Saxons and Norsemen in the locality , and inscribed stones discovered in 1986 at <unk> Farm , one of which has Latin text , suggest the existence of a 9th @-@ century Anglo @-@ monastic site , or of a Viking @-@ Age literate community from Milnrow , Rochdale or the surrounding region . 
 The name Milnrow is derived from Old English , but its meaning has not been deciphered with any certainty . The name may be a corruption of an old pronunciation of " Millner Howe " , a water driven corn mill at a place called Mill Hill on the River Beal that was mentioned in deeds dating from 1568 . Another explanation is that it means a " mill with a row of houses " , combining the Old English elements <unk> and raw . Others have suggested that the name " Milnrow " is derived from a local family with the surname Milne , who owned a row of houses in the locality . A map from 1292 shows " <unk> " at Milnrow 's present location , other spellings have included " <unk> " ( 1545 ) and " <unk> " ( 1577 ) . 
 Milnrow emerged as a settlement after the Norman conquest of England in 1066 ; the Norman families of " de Butterworths " , " de <unk> " , " de Schofields " , " de <unk> " , " de <unk> " and " Cleggs " controlled the lands which formed the township of Butterworth from which Milnrow evolved as its main settlement . In addition to the chapelry of Milnrow , Butterworth encompassed the hamlets of Clegg , <unk> , Belfield , Butterworth Hall , <unk> , Newhey , Ogden , Tunshill , <unk> , and <unk> @-@ gate @-@ cum @-@ <unk> . Butterworth was linked , ecclesiastically , with the parish of Rochdale . 
 During the Middle Ages , the small , scattered community in and around Milnrow was primarily agrarian , with the growing and milling of grain and cereal being the main labour of the people . Dry ironstone smelting was introduced into Milnrow at a very early time as evidenced from ancient kilns found at Tunshill . A chantry was constructed in the year 1400 by the Byrons — the then Lords of the Manor — and a chapel for the wider community in 1496 ; A document dated 20 March 1496 , during the reign of Henry VII , proclaims that open land by the River Beal would be the site of the new chapel . 
 Legal documents dated 1624 state that Milnrow consisted of six cottages ; there were a further nine at Butterworth Hall , and three at Ogden . Milnrow did not expand until the introduction of a woollen weaving trade which began in the Late Middle Ages and continued until the 19th century . During this time nearby Rochdale — the local market town — was used as a central marketing , finishing and <unk> hub . The handloom weaving of woollen cloth and flannels in the domestic system became the staple industry of Milnrow , facilitating the community 's growth and prosperity . Between 40 @,@ 000 and 50 @,@ 000 sheep skins were needed every week to provide for Milnrow 's industries , and as early as the 16th century , the demand for wool was so great it had outstripped the local supply of the region and had to be imported from Ireland and the English Midlands . As a consequence of the woollen trade , rows of " fine stone domestic workshops " or weavers ' cottages were constructed beyond Milnrow 's original core , with dwelling quarters on the lower floors and loom @-@ shops on the top floor . 
 With the onset of the Industrial Revolution , the River Beal was used to power large weaving mills . Within one generation during the late @-@ 19th century , and following a boom in nearby Oldham , Milnrow 's staple industry changed from wool weaving to cotton spinning . Soon , distinctive rectangular brick @-@ built mills dominated Milnrow 's landscape . Milnrow , the location of some of the earliest ring spinning companies , had many of the characteristics of a company town . The Heaps of Milnrow exercised significant deferential and political influence in the local area . Following the Great Depression , the region 's textile sector experienced a decline until its eventual demise in the mid @-@ 20th century . Milnrow 's last cotton mill was Butterworth Hall Mill , demolished in the late 1990s . Milnrow experienced population growth and suburbanisation in the second half of the 20th century , spurred by the construction of the M62 motorway through the area , making Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire commutable . Milnrow Metrolink station opened as part of Greater Manchester 's light @-@ rail Metrolink network on 28 February 2013 .

 Lying within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire since the early 12th century , Milnrow was a chapelry and component area of Butterworth , an ancient township within the parish of Rochdale and hundred of Salford . Under feudalism , Butterworth was governed by a number of ruling families , including the Byrons , who obtained the title of Lords of the Manor . Throughout the Late Middle Ages , local men acted as jurors and constables for the purposes of upholding law and order in Butterworth . Butterworth in the 19th century constituted a civil parish , until its dissolution in 1894 . 
 Milnrow 's first local authority was a Local board of health established in 1870 . Milnrow Local Board of Health was a regulatory body responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation in the wards of Belfield , Haugh and Milnrow . In 1879 , a part of Castleton and another part of Butterworth were included in the area of the Local board . Under the Local Government Act 1894 , the area of the local board broadly became the Milnrow Urban District , a local government district in the Rochdale Poor Law Union and administrative county of Lancashire . Under the Local Government Act 1972 , the Milnrow Urban District was abolished , and Milnrow has , since 1 April 1974 , formed an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale , within the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester . In anticipation of the new local government arrangement , Milnrow Urban District Council applied for successor parish status to be granted to the locality after 1974 , but the application was not successful . 
 From 1983 to 1997 , Milnrow was represented in the House of Commons as part of the parliamentary constituency of Littleborough and Saddleworth . Between 1997 and 2010 it was within the boundaries of Oldham East and Saddleworth . In 2010 Milnrow became part of the Rochdale constituency , which is represented by Simon <unk> MP , a member of the Labour Party .

Milnrow 's highest point ( 1 @,@ 310 feet or 399 metres ) is by its east @-@ southeastern border with the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham at <unk> and <unk> Moor , above the rugged , upland Piethorne Valley and close to Windy Hill . From this point the average height of the land falls gradually towards the direction of Rochdale to the northwest , into a mixture of undulating farmland and suburbia . Milnrow experiences a temperate maritime climate , like much of the British Isles , with relatively cool summers and mild winters . There is regular but generally light precipitation throughout the year . 
 In 1855 , the poet Edwin Waugh said of <unk> : 
 Milnrow lies on the ground not unlike a tall tree laid lengthwise , in a valley , by a riverside . At the bridge , its roots spread themselves in clots and fibrous shoots , in all directions ; while the almost <unk> trunk runs up , with a little bend , above half a mile towards Oldham , where it again spreads itself out in an <unk> way . 
 Surrounded by open moor and grassland on its northern and eastern sides , Milnrow forms a continuous urban area with neighbouring Rochdale to the west , and , according to the Office for National Statistics , is part of the Greater Manchester Urban Area , the United Kingdom 's third largest conurbation . 
 There are a number of small named @-@ places in and around Milnrow , including Clegg , <unk> , Gallows , Haugh , Newhey , Kitcliffe , Ogden , and Tunshill . Newhey , at the south of Milnrow by Shaw and Crompton , is the most distinct of these areas , and , with its own parish church and Metrolink station , is invariably given as a separate village . The Gallows public house is said to occupy the land of an ancient execution site ; Gallows , a former hamlet at northeastern Milnrow , is named in reference to a baronial gallows . Kitcliffe , Ogden and Tunshill , to the east of central Milnrow , are hamlets that occupy the upper , mid and lower Piethorne Valley respectively .

 = = Economy = = 
 Prior to deindustrialisation in the late @-@ 20th century , Milnrow 's economy was linked closely with a spinning and weaving tradition which had evolved from developments in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution . Industries ancillary to textile production were also operational , such as coal mining at Tunshill , and metalworking at Butterworth Hall . Butterworth Hall Colliery was the largest colliery in the Rochdale region , employing around 300 men in 1912 . Modern sectors in the area include engineering , packaging materials , the dyeing and finishing of textiles and carpets , and ink production . The main street comprises a variety of shops , restaurants and food outlets . 
 The biggest employers are Holroyd Machine Tools , part of Precision Technologies Group who have been based in the town since they moved from Manchester to Milnrow in 1896 . In the early 20th century they operated a foundry in Whitehall Street and employed engineers and apprentices .

 The Grade II listed Church of St James , Milnrow 's Anglican parish church , was built in 1869 and is dedicated to James the Apostle . It is part of the Church of England and lies within the Diocese of Manchester . The origins of the church can be traced to a chantry built by the Byrons in the year 1400 . When that baronial family moved from Milnrow to another of their homes following the Wars of the Roses , the local population was left without a place of worship and a chapel was constructed by the River Beal to serve this community . This structure existed until the 1790s , when a " poorly designed " chapel was erected and consecrated ; however , due to structural weaknesses , that church was demolished in 1814 . Following an interim period when a " plain building " was used for worship , the present church building was built and consecrated by the Bishop of Manchester on 21 August 1869 . 
 Described as " by far the most distinctive and splendid building in the district " , the neo @-@ Gothic Newhey , St Thomas parish church was built in 1876 and served a new Anglican parish of Newhey created in the same year . Dedicated to Thomas the Apostle , it is part of the Church of England , and its patron is the Bishop of Manchester . The church was extensively damaged in an arson attack on 21 December 2007 . 
 Milnrow War Memorial is located in Memorial Park at Newhey , and is a Grade II listed structure . The war memorial was originally sited in central Milnrow , set back from the road near Milnrow Bridge , and was unveiled on 3 August 1924 by Major General A. Solly @-@ Flood , a former commander of 42nd ( East Lancashire ) Division . The memorial is constructed of sandstone surmounted by a bronze statue of a World War I infantry soldier with rifle and fixed bayonet symbolic of the young manhood of the district in the early days of World War I. In selecting the design the Milnrow War Memorial Committee was influenced by the statue unveiled at Waterhead in Oldham ; the work of George Thomas . Thomas sculpted Milnrow 's memorial in 1923 . The plinth holds bronze and slate panels recording the names of those who died in the two World Wars . 
 Clegg Hall is a 17th @-@ century hall and Grade II * listed building situated in green space between Milnrow , Rochdale and Littleborough . It was constructed in about 1610 for Theophilus Aston and may have been built on the site of a mediaeval house and inn . 
 In Newhey is the Ellenroad Steam Museum , the retained engine house , boiler house , chimney and steam engine of Ellenroad Mill , a former 1892 @-@ built cotton mill designed by Sir Philip Stott , 1st Baronet . Now operated as an industrial heritage centre , the mill itself is no longer standing , but the steam engine ( the world 's largest working steam mill engine ) is maintained and steamed once a month by the Ellenroad Trust . The museum has the only fully working cotton mill engine with its original steam @-@ raising plant in the world . Ellenroad Mill produced fine cotton yarn using mule spinning . 
 Hollingworth Lake lies beyond Milnrow , by Littleborough and is part of a local country park . It was built in 1801 as a feeder reservoir for the Rochdale Canal , but it soon became a tourist destination for local people during their leisure time .

 Milnrow Metrolink station is on the Oldham and Rochdale Line with tram services operating every 12 minutes . It was previously a railway station on the Oldham Loop Line which connected Manchester , Oldham and Rochdale . The station was constructed in 1862 by navvies drafted by contractors under the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway . On 12 August 1863 , the line was opened to commercial traffic and 2 November 1863 , to passenger trains . Milnrow station was originally staffed , and the line through it was dual @-@ track ; however this section was reduced to single @-@ track in 1980 . Milnrow railway station closed on 3 October 2009 to be converted for use with an expanded Metrolink network .

 John Collier ( who wrote under the pseudonym of Tim Bobbin ) was an acclaimed 18th @-@ century caricaturist and satirical poet who was raised and spent all his adult life in Milnrow . Born in Urmston in 1708 , Collier was schoolmaster for Milnrow . Inspired by William Hogarth , Collier 's work savagely lampooned the behaviour of upper and lower classes alike , and was written in a strong Lancashire dialect . Many of his works and personal possessions are preserved in Milnrow 's library , and he is commemorated in the name of a " prominent pub " in central Milnrow . Francis Robert Raines ( 1805 – 1878 ) was the Anglican vicar of Milnrow , and an antiquary . He edited 23 volumes for the Chetham Society publications . He was ordained in 1828 and , after short appointments at Saddleworth and Rochdale , he was vicar at Milnrow for the rest of his life . John Milne was a professor , geologist and mining engineer who invented a pioneering seismograph ( known as the Milne @-@ Shaw seismograph ) to detect and measure earthquakes . Although born in Liverpool in 1850 owing to a brief visit there by his parents , Milne was raised in Rochdale and at Tunshill in Milnrow . Other notable people of Milnrow include Lizzy Bardsley , who , in 2003 , gained fame from appearing on Channel 4 's Wife Swap , and Newhey @-@ raised Stuart <unk> , who won a Silver Medal in the Men 's 470 class at the 2012 Summer Olympics . 
 = GMB Class 71 = 
 GMB Class 71 is an electric multiple unit used by Flytoget for the Airport Express Trains on the Gardermoen Line of Norway . Sixteen three @-@ car train sets were built by Adtranz Strømmen between 1997 and 1998 . The units are capable of 210 km / h ( 130 mph ) , connecting Oslo Central Station and other stations in Metropolitan Oslo to the Oslo Airport , Gardermoen , along Norway 's only high @-@ speed railway . 
 In a three @-@ car configuration , the units weigh 158 tonnes ( 156 long tons ; 174 short tons ) and are 82 @.@ 3 metres ( 270 ft 0 in ) long , with a power output of 2 @,@ 645 kW ( 3 @,@ 547 hp ) . The units are similar to the NSB Class 73 , and are related to the Swedish X2 units . By 2009 , all units were expanded with a fourth car . 
 = = Specifications = = 
 The unit is based on the Swedish X2 designed by Kalmar Verkstad in the 1980s , and delivered from 1990 to the Swedish State Railways for use in their X 2000 high @-@ speed intercity trains . Although the technology involved is similar , like spot @-@ welded stainless steel car bodies , the Class 71 differs in several ways . First , the unit does not have a separate locomotive unit , but has the motors spread throughout the train , with one powered and one unpowered bogie in each car . The car bodies are totally different in layout , including the doors between bogies instead of at the end of the cars . In addition , the trains are pressure tight to increase comfort for passengers while passing through tunnels . They also have hydraulic couplers at the ends , which are hidden behind covers when not used . The Class 71 is also shorter , with only three cars , and does not have any tilting technology installed . The exterior design , especially the nose , is quite different . Norges Statsbaner later took order of 22 units of the Class 73 , that is almost identical , but has four cars and tilting technology . Class 73 's pantograph is pivoted in order to keep it centred under the catenary when the body tilts . 
 Each train has a 2 @,@ 645 kW ( 3 @,@ 550 hp ) power output ; this is an unusually high power to weight ratio for trains with that maximum speed . The units use the standard Norwegian voltage of 15 kV 16 2 ⁄ 3 Hz AC . Up to four units can be run in multiple , creating 12 @-@ car ( or 16 @-@ car after the upgrade ) trains . However , the trains normally only operate as single or double units , limiting the length to eight cars . End cars are 27 @.@ 9 m ( 92 ft ) and weigh 52 t ( 51 long tons ; 57 short tons ) , while center cars are 26 @.@ 32 m ( 86 @.@ 4 ft ) and weigh 54 t ( 53 long tons ; 60 short tons ) . The pantograph is located on the center car . Each unit has 168 seats , that are built <unk> so that the seating can be reconfigured . The sixteen units cost NOK 1 @.@ 4 billion . 
 During construction , the weight had increased from 149 to 170 tonnes ; to reduce this to 158 tonnes , the original idea of step @-@ free access was discontinued . Instead , a wheelchair lift was installed , but it proved not to work . The area around the doors are step @-@ free from the platform , but within the trains steps must be taken to reach the seating area . The Norwegian Federation of Organisations of Disabled People have criticized Flytoget for ordering identical additional cars that will not ease access for the disabled . 
 The Class 71 is capable of speeds up to 210 km / h ( 130 mph ) , compared to 200 km / h ( 120 mph ) in the original . This speed was chosen to make it possible to get from Oslo Central Station to Oslo Airport , Gardermoen in less than 20 minutes . The signalling system ATC @-@ 2 is built for 200 km / h , and could not be adopted for much more than that . The three car units ( <unk> four car units ) can only be separated at a railway workshop , and are never used in anything but their native car configuration . 
 = = History = = 
 When the Parliament of Norway decided to build Oslo Airport , Gardermoen , on 8 October 1992 , they also decided to build a high @-@ speed airport rail link from Oslo Central Station to the airport . This railway , the Gardermoen Line , was to be built and operated by a subsidiary of Norwegian State Railways , NSB Gardermobanen . To operate the railway they needed sixteen electric multiple units . 
 In addition to tests in Sweden , the X2 was tried out on the Randsfjord Line on 12 March 1993 . The order for the units was placed on 23 February 1995 , after NSB had received bids from ABB ( that later merged with Daimler 's train division to become ADtranz ) , AEG , Fiat Ferroviaria , Talbot , Linke @-@ Hofmann @-@ Busch , Siemens and Görlitz . During 1996 , an X2 train was rented to test out performance on the Norwegian railway system , and for a short period put into service on the Sørland Line . The first Class 71 unit was delivered on 19 September 1997 , and the last on 30 January 1998 . The last unit , no . 71 @.@ 16 , was delivered with tilting mechanism to be used to test performance on the Norwegian railways , due to the similarities between Class 71 and Class 73 . It could be seen during the winter on the challenging Bergen Line and Dovre Line . After a few years the tilting mechanism was removed . 
 In 2007 , Flytoget announced that they had ordered a fourth car for each of the units . This increased the capacity of each unit by 40 % to 244 seats , and allows the company to manage the annual 10 % growth in passengers . The delivery of the fourth cars started in 2008 and were built by Bombardier Transportation , who has bought ADtranz , with the rebuilding scheduled to be completed during 2009 . The rebuilding created several challenges for Bombardier , since most of the components used in the class were no longer available . Significant components such as the car body and rectifiers had to be built by Bombardier based on abandoned production lines , and many of the original manufacturers for the interior have become defunct . 
 From 2010 , the Norwegian Rail School operates a simulator center for training motormen . It consists of six mock @-@ ups of the Class 71 driver 's cab , and is used both by the school and to train existing Airport Express Train drivers in exceptional circumstances . The simulators were built by <unk> and cost NOK 35 million . 
 = = Incidents = = 
 The sister trains in service with NSB were prone to technical failures , since they have to operate on hundred @-@ year @-@ old infrastructure on cross @-@ mountain services . The Class 71 has more lenient operating conditions thanks to better infrastructure , and therefore has not been prone to as much malfunction . The only incident to ground all the Class 71 trains occurred on 17 June 2000 , after a Class 73 @-@ train operated by NSB derailed at Nelaug Station owing to stress on the axles . The Oslo Airport Express Trains were back in service the next day , while the 73 @-@ series had to wait another month before returning to service . On 24 January 2004 , a Class 71 unit had to be taken out of service due to smoke from a stressed bearing , causing the replacement of the bearings on all units within days . 
 Several deaths have taken place on the route , but only one due to an accident . In 1999 , an employee of the Norwegian National Rail Administration was killed after impact with a train ; the authorities stated that the cause was due to the train operating at 160 kilometres per hour ( 99 mph ) , instead of the temporarily reduced limit of 80 kilometres per hour ( 50 mph ) . The company was fined for not informing the driver of the speed limit reduction . Several other deaths on the line have been classified as suicides , and so are not part of the accident statistics ; they do however cause delays on all services for hours after the incidents take place . 
 In 2000 and 2001 , Flytoget experienced three derailments with empty trains at Gardermoen ; one caused by the engineer falling asleep and two by the train passing a red light . No more such accidents occurred after Automatic Train Control was installed in 2001 . 
 = Hurricane Ella ( 1978 ) = 
 Hurricane Ella was the strongest hurricane on record in Canadian waters . It formed on August 30 , 1978 to the south of Bermuda , and quickly intensified as it tracked west @-@ northwestward . By September 1 , Ella reached winds of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) , and it was expected to pass close to the Outer Banks of North Carolina during the busy Labor Day Weekend . The hurricane became stationary for about 24 hours , and later turned to the northeast away from the coast . On September 4 , Ella reached Category 4 status on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale off the coast of Nova Scotia . It subsequently weakened , passing southeast of Newfoundland before being absorbed by a large extratropical cyclone . 
 In North Carolina , the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch due to the large influx of people expected during the holiday weekend . As such , there was a significant drop in tourism , although no significantly adverse weather occurred along the Outer Banks . High waves and some minor beach erosion was reported , but there were no deaths , injuries , or damage from Ella . By the time the hurricane passed Newfoundland , the strongest winds were to the southeast of the center , and as a result , no significant impact was reported on Canada . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Towards the end of August 1978 , a cold front stalled and dissipated across the western Atlantic Ocean , which spawned a tropical disturbance southeast of Bermuda on August 28 . A circulation was present , and it developed into a tropical depression on August 30 , about 520 miles ( 840 km ) south @-@ southeast of Bermuda . Located to the south of a subtropical ridge , the depression tracked steadily west @-@ northwestward , and it attained tropical storm status 18 hours after forming , based on a nearby ship observation . At 2200 UTC on August 30 , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) initiated advisories on the system , but three hours later , as its rapid strengthening became evident , it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Ella . 
 Tropical Storm Ella intensified quickly and reached hurricane status late on August 31 , based on confirmation from nearby ship reports and a Hurricane Hunters flight . At the time , the hurricane was forecast to avoid making landfall on North Carolina and ultimately turn northeastward , although it was expected to pass within 50 miles ( 85 km ) of land during the busy Labor Day Weekend . On September 1 , Ella reached a preliminary peak intensity of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) , a major hurricane and a Category 3 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . At the same time a short @-@ wave trough reached the East Coast of the United States . The trough caused the hurricane to decelerate and turn slightly to the north , and a ridge behind the trough caused Ella to become nearly stationary for 24 hours . During that time , the threat toward the North Carolina coast diminished , and concurrently , the winds decreased as the convection diminished . 
 On September 3 , another trough exited the coast of the United States , allowing the hurricane to accelerate toward the northeast through the diminished ridge . By that time , the winds had decreased to 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) , although forecasters expected baroclinic instability to maintain much of the cyclone 's remaining force . Instead of continued weakening , the hurricane began to significantly re @-@ intensify . Early on September 4 , Ella again reached major hurricane status , and later that day it peaked with winds of 140 mph ( 220 km / h ) ; at the time it was about 335 miles ( 540 km ) south of Halifax , Nova Scotia , and its peak winds were measured by Hurricane Hunters . This made it the strongest hurricane ever recorded in Canadian waters . Weakening began immediately after peak intensity due to cooler water temperatures . Early on September 5 , Ella passed very near Cape Race , although the strongest winds were south and east of the center . Associated convection became completely removed from the center , and the hurricane became extratropical as it was absorbed by a larger mid @-@ latitude system . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 On September 1 , as Hurricane Ella was strengthening to its first peak in strength , the National Hurricane Center anticipated a track near the North Carolina coast during the busy Labor Day Weekend ; as a result , the agency issued a hurricane watch for the Outer Banks . The Cape Hatteras National Weather Service office requested radio and television stations in the threatened area to continue broadcasting beyond normal hours , so to convey storm updates to people in the region . Additionally , the Cape Hatteras agency issued an advisory for small craft to remain at port , and also for affected people to " keep alert [ and ] ignore rumors . " Due to the threat , campgrounds on Ocracoke Island and Cape Lookout , each only accessible by ferry , were closed to reduce their populations . 
 The hurricane ultimately stayed far away from the coast , and the heavy rainfall and thunderstorms remained at least 50 miles ( 85 km ) offshore . While nearly stationary , Hurricane Ella produced waves of 5 to 9 feet ( 2 to 3 metres ) in height , as well as rip currents along the coast . The highest wind gust from the storm over land was 31 mph ( 50 km / h ) at Diamond Shoal Light . The waves reached the dunes along most beaches , causing some minor beach erosion ; the depleted sand returned within a few days . Further north , along the coast of Virginia , no large waves were reported , which was considered unusual for how close the hurricane was to the state . 
 Ultimately , the most significant effect from the hurricane was the significant drop in tourism . The Labor Day Weekend is typically the last significant week of the summer tourist season , and normally , many people vacation along the Outer Banks . Due to the hurricane watch , traffic was light , and many businesses and hotels reported much less business than usual . A forecaster with the National Weather Service said the hurricane watch was put into effect because of " thousands of people streaming in and only one road off the Outer Banks , [ and they ] couldn 't wait until the last minute . " The same forecaster noted that a " alert " less than a hurricane watch " would have been used [ during Ella ] . 
 No significant impact was reported in Canada , as the strongest winds were south and east of the center . Prior to the storm 's arrival , the Newfoundland Weather Forecast Office issued a hurricane warning for southeastern Newfoundland . The ferry between Nova Scotia and Newfoundland was disrupted , and boats across the region were sent back to harbor . Rainfall was fairly light , peaking at 2 @.@ 39 inches ( 60 @.@ 8 mm ) in southeastern Newfoundland , and sustained winds reached 71 mph ( 115 km / h ) at Cape Race .

Ranariddh became the secretary @-@ general of FUNCINPEC in 1989 , and its president in 1992 . When FUNCINPEC won the 1993 Cambodian general election , it formed a coalition government with the Cambodian People 's Party ( CPP ) , which was jointly headed by two concurrently serving prime ministers . Ranariddh became the First Prime Minister of Cambodia while Hun Sen , who was from the CPP , became the Second Prime Minister . As the First Prime Minister , Ranariddh promoted business interests in Cambodia to leaders from regional countries and established the Cambodian Development Council ( CDC ) . 
 From early 1996 , relations between Ranariddh and Hun Sen deteriorated as Ranariddh complained of unequal distribution of government authority between FUNCINPEC and the CPP . Subsequently , both leaders publicly argued over issues such as the implementation of construction projects , signing of property development contracts , and their rival alliances with the Khmer Rouge . In July 1997 , a major clash between troops separately aligned to FUNCINPEC and the CPP took place , forcing Ranariddh into exile . The following month , Ranariddh was ousted from his position as First Prime Minister . He returned to Cambodia in March 1998 , and led his party in the 1998 Cambodian general election . When FUNCINPEC lost the elections to the CPP , Ranariddh , after initially challenged the results , became President of the National Assembly in November 1998 . He was seen as a potential successor to Sihanouk as the King of Cambodia , until in 2001 he renounced his interest in the succession . As the President of the National Assembly , Ranariddh was one of the nine members of the throne council which in 2004 selected Sihamoni as Sihanouk 's successor . 
 In March 2006 , Ranariddh resigned as the President of the National Assembly and in October 2006 was ousted as President of FUNCINPEC . The following month , he founded the Norodom Ranariddh Party ( NRP ) . After accusations of embezzlement and adultery he went into exile again , and in March 2007 was convicted in absentia of embezzlement and sentenced to 18 months ' imprisonment . After being pardoned in September 2008 and returning to Cambodia , Ranariddh announced his retirement from politics , but resumed the NRP leadership in December 2010 . He failed to merge the NRP and FUNCINPEC , and retired again , but in March 2014 re @-@ emerged to launch the Community of Royalist People 's Party ( CRPP ) . In January 2015 , Ranariddh dissolved the CRPP and returned to FUNCINPEC . He was subsequently re @-@ elected to the FUNCINPEC presidency .

 Ranariddh was born in Phnom Penh to Sihanouk and his first wife Phat Kanhol , a ballet dancer attached to the royal court . Ranariddh was separated from his mother at three years of age when she remarried , and subsequently grew up mostly under the care of his aunt , Norodom <unk> and <unk> , Norodom <unk> . Ranariddh attended primary education at Norodom School and completed part of his high school studies at <unk> Descartes in Phnom Penh . During his childhood , he developed a close relationship with his grandparents , Norodom Suramarit and Sisowath Kossamak , but was distanced from his father . In 1958 , Ranariddh was sent to a boarding school in Marseille together with his half @-@ brother Norodom Chakrapong . Ranariddh initially planned to pursue medical studies as he did well in science subjects , but was persuaded by Kossamak to study law . After finishing high school in 1961 , he enrolled in the undergraduate programme of law at the University of Paris . He struggled to focus on his studies in Paris , which he attributed to the social distractions that he encountered in the city . 
 In 1962 , Ranariddh enrolled in the law faculty at the University of Provence ( now part of Aix @-@ Marseille University ) . He obtained his bachelor 's and master 's degrees in 1968 and 1969 respectively , specialising in Public Law . After completing his master 's , Ranariddh took the PhD qualifying examinations in 1969 . He returned to Cambodia in January 1970 , and worked briefly as a secretary at the Interior Ministry . When Lon Nol staged a successful coup against Sihanouk in March 1970 , Ranariddh was dismissed from his job and fled into the jungle where he was a close associate of resistance leaders . In 1971 , Ranariddh was captured , along with several members of the royal family , and was held in prison for six months before being released . He was rearrested the following year , and spent a further three months in detention . In 1973 , Ranariddh returned to the University of Provence , where he completed his PhD in 1975 . Between 1976 and 1979 , he worked as a research fellow at the CNRS , and was awarded a diploma of higher studies in air transport . In 1979 Ranariddh went back to the University of Provence as an associate professor , teaching courses in constitutional law and political sociology .

 When Sihanouk formed FUNCINPEC in 1981 , Ranariddh declined his father 's invitation to join the party as he disagreed with its association with the Khmer Rouge . In June 1983 , Sihanouk urged Ranariddh to leave his teaching career in France and join FUNCINPEC , and this time he agreed . Ranariddh was appointed as a personal representative to Sihanouk , and relocated to Bangkok , Thailand , where he took charge of the party 's diplomatic and political activities in Asia .

When the 1991 Paris Peace Accords were signed in October of that year , officially ending the Cambodian – Vietnamese War , Ranariddh was one of the SNC signatories . In February 1992 , he was elected to the presidency of FUNCINPEC .

 When the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia ( UNTAC ) – a parallel administrative body with the SNC – was formed in February 1992 , Ranariddh was appointed as one of its council members . He spent time travelling between Bangkok and Phnom Penh , and while in Phnom Penh led efforts in opening FUNCINPEC party offices across Cambodia . At the same time , FUNCINPEC began to criticise the ruling CPP , which retaliated with violent attacks by police against low @-@ level FUNCINPEC officials . The attacks prompted Ranariddh 's close aides , Norodom Sirivudh and Sam Rainsy , to advise him against registering the party for the 1993 general elections . However , the chef @-@ de @-@ mission for UNTAC , Yasushi Akashi , encouraged Ranariddh to run in the elections . Persuaded by Akashi , he registered the party and the election campaign began in April 1993 . Ranariddh , as well as other FUNCINPEC officials , wore T @-@ shirts depicting Sihanouk on the campaign trail . This nominally complied with an election rule by the UNTAC administration not to use Sihanouk 's name during the campaign , who now served as the politically neutral head of the SNC . Voting took place in May 1993 ; FUNCINPEC secured about 45 percent of the valid votes , winning 58 out of a total of 120 parliamentary seats . The CPP refused to recognise the election results and complained of electoral fraud . 
 On 3 June 1993 , CPP leaders Chea Sim and Hun Sen met with Sihanouk and persuaded him to head an interim government with the CPP and FUNCINPEC as joint coalition partners . That evening , Sihanouk announced the formation of the interim government over national radio . Ranariddh , who had not been consulted , expressed surprise . At the same time , the United States and China declared their opposition to the plan , prompting Sihanouk to rescind his announcement the following day . On 10 June 1993 , CPP leaders led by General Sin Song and Chakrapong threatened to secede eight eastern provinces from Cambodia . Ranariddh feared a civil war with the CPP , which had a much larger army than the ANS . Accordingly , he accepted the idea of FUNCINPEC working with the CPP , and both parties agreed to a dual prime minister arrangement in the new government . On 14 June , Ranariddh presided over a parliamentary meeting which made Sihanouk the Head of State , with Hun Sen and Ranariddh serving as co @-@ Prime Ministers in an interim government . A new constitution was drafted over the next three months , and was adopted in early September . On 24 September 1993 , Sihanouk resigned as the head of state and was reinstated as King of Cambodia . In the new government , Ranariddh and Hun Sen were appointed as the First Prime Minister and Second Prime Minister , respectively .

 Benny Widyono , the UN secretary @-@ general 's representative in Cambodia from 1994 to 1997 , has observed that although Ranariddh was nominally senior to Hun Sen , he held less executive power . Ranariddh initially viewed Hun Sen with suspicion , but the pair soon developed a close working relationship , agreeing on most policy decisions made until early 1996 . In August 1993 , while Cambodia was still under the administration of an interim government , Ranariddh and Hun Sen jointly applied to make the country a member in the International Organization of the Francophonie . The decision to enter the Francophonie sparked a debate among students in higher educational institutes , particularly those from the Institute of Technology of Cambodia who called for French to be replaced with English as the language of instruction . In response , Ranariddh encouraged students to simultaneously learn both English and French . 
 In August 1995 , Ranariddh expressed admiration for the political and economic systems of Singapore , Malaysia and Indonesia . As he saw it , these countries , characterised by hybrid regimes , active economic interventionism and limited press freedom , served as good models to propel Cambodia 's socio @-@ economic growth . Ranariddh espoused the view that economic development should take precedence over democratic and human rights . In the initial months of the administration , he actively courted political leaders from various regional countries , including Indonesia , Singapore and Malaysia , with a view to encouraging investment in Cambodia . In early 1994 , Ranariddh established the Cambodian Development Council ( CDC ) to encourage foreign investment , and served as its chairperson . The Malaysian Prime Minister , Mahathir Mohamad , supported Ranariddh 's plans , and encouraged Malaysian businessmen to invest and assist in developing the tourism , infrastructural development and telecommunications industries . 
 As the chairman of the CDC , Ranariddh gave his approval to at least 17 business contracts submitted by Malaysian businessmen between August 1994 and January 1995 . The projects mostly covered infrastructural development , and included construction of a racing track , power plants and petrol stations . In November 1994 , the CDC opened a tender to build a casino near Sihanoukville and proposals submitted by three companies were shortlisted ; Ariston Berhad from Malaysia , <unk> Corporation from Singapore and Hyatt International from the US . Ariston 's proposal was valued at USD 1 @.@ 3 billion , and included bringing a luxury cruise ship with casino to Cambodia , to be used to accommodate tourists until the Sihanoukville resort was built . Before the tender was even concluded , Ariston 's ship was brought to Phnom Penh in early December . The Tourism Minister , Veng <unk> suspected that there was backroom dealing activities between CDC and Ariston , who were nevertheless awarded the contract , which Ranariddh signed in January 1995 . 
 In 1992 , the UNTAC administration had banned forest logging and timber exports , a major industry and source of foreign earnings . In October 1993 , Ranariddh issued an order to lift the ban on a temporary basis so as to allow trees that were already felled to be exported for timber . The Khmer Rouge still controlled large tracts of forests in the regions of western and northern Cambodia bordering Thailand , and helped finance its operations by selling timber to Thai forestry companies The Cambodian government was unable to impose its will in Khmer Rouge territory , and was eager to regain the logging revenues . In January 1994 , Ranariddh and Hun Sen signed a bilateral agreement with Thai Prime Minister Chuan <unk> . The agreement provided for felled trees to be legally exported to Thailand on a temporary basis until 31 March 1994 . The agreement also arranged for specially @-@ designated customs zones to be created within Thai territory , which allowed Cambodian custom officials to inspect the logs and collect export duties . 
 The logging ban went into force on 31 March 1994 , but trees continued to be felled and a new stockpile of timber was created . Ranariddh and Hun Sen gave special authorisation for the lumber to be exported to North Korea . They would continue the practice of periodically lifting export bans and granting special approvals to clear stocks of fallen timber on an on @-@ and off @-@ basis until Ranariddh 's ouster in 1997 . According to Canadian geographer Philippe Le <unk> , Ranariddh and Hun Sen were tacitly supported continued Khmer Rouge logging activities as it provided a lucrative backdoor source of cash revenue to finance their own political activities . Under Ranariddh 's co @-@ administration , Malaysia 's Samling Berhad and Indonesia 's Macro @-@ <unk> were among the largest beneficiaries of government contracts , as these two logging companies , in 1994 – 1995 , secured rights to log 805 @,@ 000 hectares and 1 @.@ 4 million hectares of forests , respectively . 
 = = = Conflicts within the government = = = 
 In October 1994 , Ranariddh and Hun Sen dropped Sam Rainsy as Finance Minister during a cabinet reshuffle . Rainsy had been appointed by Ranariddh in 1993 , but both prime ministers became uncomfortable working with Rainsy , because of his pursuit of allegations of government corruption . Rainsy 's dismissal upset Norodom Sirivudh , who resigned as Foreign Minister the following month . In March 1995 , during an academic forum on corruption in Cambodia , Rainsy publicly questioned Ranariddh 's acceptance of a Fokker 28 airplane and a US $ 108 million commission from Ariston Berhad . This angered Ranariddh , who expelled him from FUNCINPEC in May 1995 . The following month , Ranariddh introduced a parliamentary motion to remove Rainsy as a Member of Parliament ( MP ) . 
 From January 1996 onwards , Ranariddh 's relations with Hun Sen began to show signs of tension . Hun Sen submitted a government circular to reinstate 7 January as a national holiday , the anniversary of Phnom Penh 's liberation from the Khmer Rouge by Vietnamese forces . Ranariddh added his signature to the circular , which incurred the ire of Sihanouk and several FUNCINPEC leaders . A few days later , apparently to tone down dissatisfaction from party members , Ranariddh publicly accused the Army of Vietnam of encroaching into the territories of four Cambodian provinces bordering it . As Widyono saw it , Ranariddh intended to test Hun Sen 's response to his accusations , of which the latter chose to remain quiet . During a closed @-@ door FUNCINPEC meeting in the later part of January 1996 , party members criticised Hun Sen and the CPP for monopolizing government power , and also chided Ranariddh for being too subservient to Hun Sen. 
 In February 1996 , Ranariddh expressed concern over repeated delays in the construction of the resort @-@ cum @-@ casino complex at Sihanoukville , for which he had signed an agreement with Ariston in January 1995 . Ariston blamed the lack of a governmental authority in Sihanoukville for the delay . At the end of April 1996 , the government formed the Sihanoukville Developmental Authority ( SDA ) to oversee regulatory affairs and facilitate development . At a conference in May 1996 , Ranariddh charged that CPP @-@ controlled ministries were deliberately delaying the paperwork needed to complete the approval of Ariston 's project . According to Tioulong <unk> , the former deputy governor of Cambodia 's Central Bank ( and Sam Rainsy 's wife ) , the delays were part of Hun Sen 's strategy to undermine projects associated with Ranariddh . In an apparent act of retaliation , Ranariddh directed FUNCINPEC 's co @-@ minister of the interior , You Hockry to close down all casinos in the country , citing the absence of authorising legislation . Ranariddh also proposed the cancellation of Ariston 's contracts due to the delays . Hun Sen responded by meeting with Mahathir , and assured him that agreements which Ranariddh had previously approved would be honoured . 
 At a FUNCINPEC congress in March 1996 , Ranariddh expressed unhappiness over his relationship with Hun Sen and the CPP . He likened his position as prime minister , and those of the FUNCINPEC ministers , to " puppets " . He also questioned the CPP over their delays in appointing FUNCINPEC local officials as district chiefs . Ranariddh threatened to dissolve the National Assembly before the end of 1996 , should FUNCINPEC 's concerns remain unresolved . Several FUNCINPEC MPs , including Loy Sim <unk> and Ahmad Yahya , called on Ranariddh to reconcile with Sam Rainsy and work with the newly formed Khmer Nation Party ( KNP ) in the forthcoming general election . On 27 April Ranariddh , while vacationing in Paris , attended a meeting with Sihanouk , Rainsy , Chakrapong and Sirivudh . A few days later , Sihanouk issued a declaration praising Hun Sen and the CPP , while also stating that FUNCINPEC had no intention of leaving the coalition government . According to Widyono , Sihanouk 's statement was an attempt to defuse the tension between Ranariddh and Hun Sen. Hun Sen rejected the king 's conciliatory overtures , and responded by publishing several public letters attacking Sihanouk , Ranariddh and FUNCINPEC . At a CPP party meeting on 29 June 1996 , Hun Sen chided Ranariddh for not following through on his March threat to leave the coalition government and called him a " real dog " . At the same time , Hun Sen urged provincial governors from the CPP not attend Ranariddh 's rallies . 
 = = = Conflict escalation & military clashes = = = 
 In August 1996 , Khmer Rouge leaders Pol Pot and Ieng Sary publicly split , with the former denouncing the latter in a radio broadcast . Ieng Sary responded by disassociating himself from the Khmer Rouge and went on to form his own political party , the Democratic National Union Movement . Pol Pot 's announcement prompted Ranariddh and Hun Sen to briefly set their political differences aside to jointly seek a royal pardon for Ieng Sary , who had been sentenced to death by the People 's Republic of Kampuchea ( PRK ) government in 1979 . Subsequently , in October and December 1996 , both Ranariddh and Hun Sen competed to win Ieng Sary 's favour by separately visiting the leader at his fiefdom in <unk> . Hun Sen gained the upper hand , when he announced at the end of his visit that he had managed to convince Khmer Rouge soldiers under Ieng Sary 's charge to join the CPP . When Ranariddh announced plans for a follow @-@ up to visit <unk> , another town located within Ieng Sary 's fiefdom , his soldiers threatened to shoot down Ranariddh 's helicopter if he went there , prompting Ranariddh to cancel his visit . 
 In September 1996 Ariston Berhad signed three agreements with CPP 's minister Sok An , without Ranariddh 's knowledge or that of other FUNCINPEC ministers . The agreements provided for the leasing of land to Ariston to develop a golf course , holiday resort and an airport in Sihanoukville . These actions angered Ranariddh , who in a February 1997 letter to Ariston 's president Chen Lip Keong , declared the agreements null and void . Subsequently , Ariston claimed that they had tried unsuccessfully to contact FUNCINPEC officials , with a view to getting them to jointly sign the agreements . Hun Sen was offended by Ranariddh 's actions , and in April 1997 wrote to Mahathir assuring him of the validity of the agreements . 
 Ranariddh forged a political coalition by bringing FUNCINPEC to work together with the KNP , the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party and the Khmer Neutral Party . On 27 January 1997 , the four political parties formalised their alliance , which became known as the " National United Front " ( NUF ) . Ranariddh was nominated as the president of the NUF , and stated his intent to lead the alliance against the CPP , in the general elections scheduled to be held in 1998 . The CPP issued a statement condemning NUF 's formation , and formed a rival coalition consisting of political parties ideologically aligned to the former Khmer Republic . 
 Meanwhile , Ranariddh stepped up his attacks against Hun Sen , accusing him of harbouring plans to restore a Communist regime should the CPP win the next general election . At the same time Ranariddh attempted to persuade moderate leaders of the Khmer Rouge , including Khieu Samphan and <unk> <unk> , to join the NUF . Khieu Samphan accepted Ranariddh 's overtures , and on 21 May 1997 , he announced that his party , the Khmer National Solidarity Party ( <unk> ) would support the NUF . Ranariddh welcomed Samphan 's announcement , and on 4 June 1997 , both leaders signed a communiqué pledging mutual support . Five days later , customs officials at Sihanoukville discovered a three @-@ ton shipment of rocket launchers , assault rifles and handguns , labelled " spare parts " and consigned to Ranariddh . The rocket launchers were seized by Cambodian Air Force officers aligned to the CPP , while Royal Cambodian Armed Forces ( RCAF ) officials aligned to FUNCINPEC were allowed to keep the light weapons . In mid @-@ June , Khmer Rouge radio , controlled by Khieu Samphan , broadcast a speech praising the <unk> @-@ NUF alliance and calling for an armed struggle against Hun Sen. Fighting subsequently broke out between Ranariddh 's and Hun Sen 's bodyguards . 
 In response Hun Sen issued an ultimatum , calling for Ranariddh to make a choice between siding with the Khmer Rouge or with the coalition government . Eleven days later , he followed up by announcing that he would stop working with Ranariddh altogether . On 3 July 1997 , while travelling to Phnom Penh , Ranariddh encountered troops aligned to the CPP . These troops persuaded his bodyguards to surrender their weapons , which prompted him to flee Cambodia the following day . On 5 July , fighting broke out between RCAF troops separately aligned to CPP and FUNCINPEC , after CPP @-@ aligned generals unsuccessfully attempted to coax FUNCINPEC @-@ aligned troops into surrendering their weapons . The FUNCINPEC @-@ aligned units suffered major casualties the following day , and subsequently fled from Phnom Penh to the border town of O <unk> in <unk> <unk> Province .

 The defeat of FUNCINPEC @-@ aligned troops in the military clashes on 6 July 1997 amounted to the effective ouster of Ranariddh . On 9 July 1997 , the Cambodian Foreign Ministry issued a White paper labelling Ranariddh a " criminal " and a " traitor " , as well as accusing him of conspiring with the Khmer Rouge to destabilise the government . Ranariddh travelled to the Philippines , Singapore and Indonesia , where he met with Fidel Ramos , Goh Chok Tong and Suharto to seek their help in his restoration . During his absence , at a party meeting on 16 July 1997 , Ung Huot was nominated by FUNCINPEC MPs loyal to Hun Sen to replace Ranariddh as First Prime Minister . Huot was subsequently endorsed as First Prime Minister during a National Assembly sitting on 6 August 1997 . A few days later , Sihanouk expressed his unhappiness over the clashes , and threatened to abdicate the throne and take over the premiership . Sihanouk also claimed that Ranariddh 's ouster was unconstitutional , and initially refused to endorse Ung Huot 's appointment , but later relented when Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) member states supported Ung Huot 's appointment . In September 1997 , the UN secretary general , Kofi Annan met separately with Ranariddh and Hun Sen , to mediate the return of FUNCINPEC politicians and prepare for the 1998 Cambodian general elections . The UN proposed that its representatives monitor the elections , to which both Ranariddh and Hun Sen agreed , but Hun Sen insisted that Ranariddh be prepared to face court charges , to which Ranariddh responded with a threat to boycott the election . 
 At O <unk> , FUNCINPEC @-@ aligned troops fought along with the Khmer Rouge forces against CPP @-@ aligned troops until February 1998 , when a ceasefire brokered by the Japanese government came into effect . In March 1998 , Ranariddh was convicted in absentia by a military court of illegally smuggling ammunitions in May 1997 , and of colluding with the Khmer Rouge to cause instability in the country . He was sentenced to a total of 35 years ' imprisonment , but this was nullified by a pardon from Sihanouk . Ranariddh returned to Cambodia at the end of March 1998 to lead FUNCINPEC 's election campaign , which focused on pro @-@ monarchical sentiments and anti @-@ Vietnamese rhetoric . FUNCINPEC faced numerous obstacles , including lack of access to television and radio channels which had come under CPP 's exclusive control following the 1997 clashes , and the difficulties of its supporters in getting to party rallies . In the vote on 26 July 1998 , FUNCINPEC polled 31 @.@ 7 percent and secured 43 out of a total of 122 parliamentary seats . The CPP won the elections by polling 41 @.@ 4 percent of all votes and securing 64 parliamentary seats . The Sam Rainsy Party ( SRP ) , Rainsy 's renamed KNP , was in third place with 14 @.@ 3 percent of the vote and 15 parliamentary seats . 
 Both Ranariddh and Rainsy protested against the election results , claiming that the CPP @-@ led government had intimidated voters and tampered with ballot boxes . They filed petitions with the National Election Commission ( NEC ) and Constitutional Court ; when these were rejected in August 1998 , Ranariddh and Rainsy organised street protests to demand that Hun Sen relinquish power . The government responded on 7 September 1998 , by banning street protests and cracking down on participants . At this point Sihanouk intervened , and arranged a summit meeting on 24 September 1998 in Siem Reap . He summoned Hun Sen , Ranariddh and Rainsy for discussions aimed at ending the political impasse . On the day of the summit meeting , a <unk> rocket was fired from an RPG @-@ 2 rocket launcher at the direction of Hun Sen 's motorcade , who was travelling en route to Siem Reap . The rocket missed the motorcade , and Hun Sen escaped unhurt . The police accused FUNCINPEC and SRP leaders of plotting the attack , with Rainsy as its ringleader . Both Ranariddh and Rainsy denied any involvement , but fled to Bangkok the following day , fearing government crackdowns on their parties . 
 = = = President of the National Assembly ( 1998 – 2006 ) = = = 
 Following Ranariddh 's departure , Sihanouk urged him to return with a view to joining the CPP in a coalition government , reckoning that FUNCINPEC faced the prospect of breaking up if Ranariddh refused . Ranariddh returned to Cambodia on 12 November 1998 to attend a summit meeting hosted by Sihanouk , at which Ranariddh negotiated with Hun Sen and Chea Sim over the structure of a new government . An agreement was reached whereby FUNCINPEC would be given the National Assembly presidency together with several low and mid @-@ level cabinet posts , in exchange for its support for the creation of the Cambodian Senate . On 25 November 1998 , Ranariddh was nominated as the President of the National Assembly . According to Mehta , the creation of the Senate was to provide an alternative platform to pass legislation in the event that Ranariddh exerted his influence as the President of the National Assembly to block legislation . 
 After his appointment , Ranariddh worked with Hun Sen to re @-@ integrate the FUNCINPEC @-@ aligned troops into the RCAF . He also participated in efforts to foster better relations with Vietnam , and liaised with the Vietnamese National Assembly president Nông Đức Mạnh to develop friendship and cooperation initiatives . This led to several mutual visits between Cambodian and Vietnamese political leaders , between 1999 and 2000 , but relations between Cambodia and Vietnam deteriorated from September 2000 onwards amid renewed border clashes . Ranariddh steered FUNCINPEC towards political rapprochement with the CPP , and actively discouraged FUNCINPEC ministers and MPs from criticising their CPP counterparts . During the party 's congress in March 2001 , Ranariddh declared the CPP an " eternal partner " . 
 As early as 1999 , a sizeable minority of FUNCINPEC 's politicians were unhappy with Ranariddh 's leadership , as rumours began to circulate that he had accepted bribes from the CPP . In February 2002 , FUNCINPEC performed poorly in the commune elections , winning 10 out of 1 @,@ 600 commune seats . As a result of FUNCINPEC 's poor performance in the commune elections , rifts within the party boiled into the open . In March 2002 , the Deputy Commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the RCAF – Khan Savoeun , accused You Hockry , the co @-@ Minister of the Interior , of corruption and nepotism , acts which Savoeun claimed had alienated voters . When Ranariddh expressed support for Savoeun in May 2002 , Hockry resigned . Around the same time , two new political parties , splintered from FUNCINPEC , were formed : the Khmer Soul Party , led by Norodom Chakrapong , and the Hang Dara Democratic Party , led by Hang Dara . Both new parties attracted sizeable numbers of FUNCINPEC defectors , who were apparently unhappy with Ranariddh 's leadership . The defections caused Ranariddh to fear that FUNCINPEC would fare poorly in the 2003 general elections . 
 When general elections were held in July 2003 , the CPP won , while FUNCINPEC polled 20 @.@ 8 percent of the popular vote and secured 26 out of a total of 120 parliamentary seats . This marked an 11 percentage point drop in FUNCINPEC 's share of the popular vote compared with 1998 . Both Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy , whose SRP had also participated in the elections , expressed unhappiness with the outcome of the election , and once again accused the CPP of winning through fraud and voter intimidation . They also refused to support a CPP @-@ led government , which needed the joint support of more MPs from FUNCINPEC or SRP to attain the two @-@ thirds majority in forming a new government . Subsequently in August 2003 , Ranariddh and Rainsy formed a new political alliance , the " Alliance of Democrats " ( AD ) , and together they lobbied upon the CPP to form a three @-@ party government consisting of the CPP , FUNCINPEC and the SRP . At the same time , they also called for Hun Sen to step down and the NEC , which they claimed that it was stacked with pro @-@ CPP appointees . Hun Sen rejected their demands , bringing several months of political stalemate . 
 In March 2004 , Ranariddh privately proposed to Hun Sen that FUNCINPEC should join CPP in the new government as a junior coalition partner . Discussions between CPP and FUNCINPEC began on the composition of the coalition government and legislative procedures . An agreement was reached in June 2004 , when Ranariddh walked out of his alliance with Rainsy , dropped his demands to reform the NEC and once again pledged to support Hun Sen as Prime Minister . Hun Sen also pressured Ranariddh into supporting a constitutional amendment known as a " package vote " , which required MPs to support legislation and ministerial appointments by an open show of hands . While Ranariddh acquiesced to Hun Sen 's demand , the " package vote " amendment was opposed by Sihanouk , Chea Sim , the SRP as well as several senior leaders within FUNCINPEC . After the " package vote " amendment was passed in July 2004 , several FUNCINPEC leaders resigned in protest . Ranariddh , who remained as President of the National Assembly as part of the agreement , attempted to lure SRP leaders into defecting to FUNCINPEC with the promise of jobs within the government . At least one senior SRP leader , Ou Bun Long , caved into Ranariddh 's enticements . 
 = = = Exit from FUNCINPEC = = = 
 On 2 March 2006 , the National Assembly passed a constitutional amendment which required only a simple majority of parliamentarians to support a government , instead of the two @-@ thirds majority that was previously stipulated . Rainsy had first proposed the amendment in February 2006 , who had hoped that a simple majority would make it easier for his party to form a government should they win in future elections . The following day after the constitutional amendment was passed , Hun Sen relieved Norodom Sirivudh and Nhek Bun Chhay of their posts as FUNCINPEC 's co @-@ minister of interior and co @-@ minister of defense respectively . Ranariddh protested against the dismissals , and resigned as the President of the National Assembly on 14 March . He then left Cambodia , to reside in France . Shortly after his departure , local tabloids published stories that Ranariddh had had an affair with Ouk Phalla , an Apsara dancer . 
 In early September 2006 , a new law was passed to outlaw adultery , and Ranariddh responded by accusing the government of attempting to undermine FUNCINPEC . On 18 September 2006 , Hun Sen and Nhek Bun Chhay called for Ranariddh to be replaced as FUNCINPEC 's president , after party reports suggested that Phalla had lobbied Ranariddh to appoint her relatives to government posts . On 18 October 2006 , Nhek Bun Chhay convened a party congress which dismissed Ranariddh from his position as FUNCINPEC 's president . In turn , he was given the titular position of " Historic President " . At the congress , Nhek Bun Chhay justified Ranariddh 's ouster on the grounds of his deteriorating relations with Hun Sen as well as his practice of spending prolonged periods of time overseas . 
 = = Recent political activities ( 2006 – present ) = = 
 = = = Norodom Ranariddh Party , exile and retirement = = = 
 Following Ranariddh 's exit from FUNCINPEC , Nhek Bun Chhay filed a lawsuit in November 2006 , accusing Ranariddh of pocketing $ 3 @.@ 6 million from the sale of its headquarters to the French embassy in 2005 . In mid @-@ November , Ranariddh returned to Cambodia , announced the formation of the Norodom Ranariddh Party ( NRP ) and became its president . The following month , the National Assembly expelled Ranariddh as an MP . Within days his wife , Eng Marie , sued him for adultery . Ranariddh 's half @-@ brother Chakrapong was also expelled from the party , and joined the NRP as the party 's deputy president . In March 2007 , Ranariddh was convicted by the Phnom Penh Municipal Court for embezzlement of the sale proceeds of FUNCINPEC headquarters , and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment . To avoid imprisonment , Ranariddh sought asylum in Malaysia shortly before the sentencing . 
 While living in exile in Malaysia , Ranariddh communicated to NRP party members and supporters through telephone and video conferencing . In November 2007 , he proposed a merger between the NRP , SRP and the Human Rights Party , to better their prospects against the CPP in the 2008 general elections . Rainsy , the leader of the SRP , rejected his proposal . When the election campaign began in June 2008 , Ranariddh , though not able to enter the country , raised issues such as border disputes with Cambodia 's neighbours , illegal logging , and promised to lower petrol prices . When voting took place in July , the NRP won two parliamentary seats . Immediately after the election , the NRP joined the SRP and the HRP in charging the Election Commission with irregularities . The NRP subsequently dropped their accusations , after Hun Sen brokered a secret deal with Ranariddh which allowed the latter to return from exile , in exchange for the NRP 's recognition of the election results . 
 In September 2008 , Ranariddh received a royal pardon from Sihamoni ( who had succeeded to the throne in October 2004 ) for his embezzlement conviction , allowing him to return to Cambodia without risking imprisonment . Following his return , Ranariddh announced his retirement from politics and pledged to support the CPP @-@ led government . After his retirement , Ranariddh dedicated most of his time to philanthropic work and supporting royal activities . In late 2010 , NRP and FUNCINPEC leaders including Nhek Bun Chhay publicly called for Ranariddh to return to politics . Ranariddh initially resisted the calls , but changed his mind and announced his return in December 2010 . For the next one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years , Ranariddh and Nhek Bun Chhay negotiated for a merger between NRP and FUNCINPEC . An agreement was formalised in May 2012 , whereby Ranariddh would be made the president of FUNCINPEC , while Nhek Bun Chhay would become its vice @-@ president . The merger agreement was rescinded a month later , when Nhek Bun Chhay accused Ranariddh of supporting other opposition parties . Two months later , Ranariddh declared his retirement from politics for a second time , and tendered his resignation as the president of NRP . 
 = = = Community of Royalist People 's Party = = = 
 In March 2014 , Ranariddh renounced his retirement and launched a new political party , the Community of Royalist People 's Party ( CRPP ) . Sam Rainsy , now president of the Cambodian National Rescue Party ( CNRP ) , accused Ranariddh of intending to split the opposition vote to favour the ruling CPP in future elections . Ranariddh responded by accusing the CNRP of harbouring republican sentiments , while also stating that his motivation in launching CRPP was to reunite royalist supporters within the Cambodian electorate . The CRPP attracted support from some senior FUNCINPEC party members ; in December 2014 an ex @-@ secretary of state , a senator and a deputy police chief declared their support for the CRPP . Hun Sen then proposed to Ranariddh that he return to FUNCINPEC . 
 = = = Return to FUNCINPEC = = = 
 In early January 2015 , Ranariddh announced his intention to dissolve the CRPP and return to FUNCINPEC . At a party congress on 19 January 2015 , he was reappointed as FUNCINPEC president ; his half @-@ sister and previous FUNCINPEC president , Norodom <unk> became the first vice @-@ president , while Nhek Bun Chhay was appointed as second vice @-@ president . In March 2015 , Ranariddh held another party congress where he appointed four more vice @-@ presidents to the FUNCINPEC executive committee . He also convinced the congress to adopt a new party logo , which had a design almost identical that of the now @-@ defunct CRPP . Ranariddh supported the formation of the Cambodian Royalist Youth Movement in July 2015 , a youth organisation aimed at garnering electoral support for FUNCINPEC from younger voters , which he was appointed as its honorary president .

 In June 1993 Ranariddh was granted the Cambodian royal title of " <unk> Krom Luong " ( Khmer : <unk> ្ <unk> ្ <unk> ) , which translates as " Senior Prince " in English . Five months later , in November 1993 , he was elevated to the rank of " Samdech Krom Preah " ( Khmer : <unk> ្ <unk> ្ <unk> ្ រះ ) , or " Leading Senior Prince " in English , in recognition of his efforts to re @-@ instate Sihanouk as the King of Cambodia . Ranariddh has been a recipient of several awards from the palace ; in December 1992 he was decorated as the Grand Officer of the Royal Order of Cambodia . In May 2001 he received the Grand Order of National Merit and in October 2001 was awarded the Order of <unk> , with the class of <unk> . He was also awarded the Grand Officer de l 'Ordre de la <unk> by the La Francophonie in March 2000 . 
 In December 2008 , Sihamoni appointed Ranariddh as President of the Supreme Privy Council of Cambodia , equivalent in rank to that of prime minister , and , during an interview in December 2010 Ranariddh revealed that this royal appointment entitles him to a monthly salary of three million <unk> ( about US $ 750 ) .

 Debates on the succession to the throne began in November 1993 , shortly after Sihanouk was diagnosed with cancer . In a 1995 poll of 700 people conducted by the Khmer Journalists ' Associations , 24 percent of respondents preferred Ranariddh to take the throne , although a larger proportion indicated no preference over any members of the royal family . In a March 1996 interview with the Cambodia Daily , Sihanouk encouraged Ranariddh to succeed him as king , but also expressed concern that a leadership vacuum within FUNCINPEC would occur , should Ranariddh accede . Sihanouk repeated these concerns in an interview with the Phnom Penh Post in February 1997 . Sihanouk mentioned Sihamoni as another potential candidate , despite the latter 's view that the responsibilities attached to the throne were " frightening " . Sihamoni 's candidacy found favour with Hun Sen and Chea Sim , because of his non @-@ involvement in politics . 
 In two reports from 1993 and 1996 , Ranariddh rejected the notion of becoming the next king . In November 1997 , Ranariddh suggested that his outspoken and passionate personality made him an unsuitable candidate for the throne . However , by March 1999 Ranariddh had become became more receptive to the idea of succeeding his father . In early 2001 , in an interview to Harish Mehta , Ranariddh discussed his conflicting desires between taking the throne and staying in politics . In November 2001 , Ranariddh told the Cambodia Daily that he had decided to prioritize his political career over the throne . In the same interview , he added that Sihamoni had in the past supported him to become the next king . In September 2004 , Ranariddh revealed that although he had been offered the throne by both Sihanouk and <unk> , who was Sihamoni 's mother , he would prefer to see Sihamoni take the throne . When the throne council convened in October 2004 to select Sihanouk 's successor , Ranariddh was part of the council which unanimously chose Norodom Sihamoni to be the next king . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Ranariddh is known for his physical resemblance to his father Sihanouk , inheriting his facial features , high @-@ pitched voice and mannerisms . Contemporaries including Harish Mehta , Lee Kuan Yew and Benny Widyono have so stated after meeting with him . An opinion poll conducted in July 1997 by the Cambodian Information Centre also supports similar observations of Ranariddh 's physical resemblance to Sihanouk . Journalists such as those from the Phnom Penh Post have observed that Ranariddh had used his resemblance to canvass support for FUNCINPEC during the 1993 and 1998 general elections . Ranariddh acknowledged these observations during an interview with Mehta in 2001 , saying : 
 " People adore the king and I look like him . It is not my achievement they are remembering , but the deeds of my father . On the contrary , if I fail the people would say ' Oh you are the son , but you are not like your father ' . It 's rather a burden . " 
 Ranariddh speaks Khmer , French and English fluently . He also holds dual Cambodian and French citizenship , having obtained the latter in 1979 . He enjoys listening to music and watching films , though in a 2001 interview he described himself as lacking the artistic talent which Sihanouk possessed . In 2002 , Ranariddh produced and directed a 90 @-@ minute film , titled Raja Bori which was shot at Angkor Wat . 
 = = = Family = = = 
 Ranariddh has 12 half @-@ siblings from his father by different wives ; Norodom <unk> Devi is the only full @-@ sibling of Ranariddh . <unk> Devi became a ballet dancer , like her mother Phat Kanhol had been during her younger days . Kanhol remarried in 1947 to a military officer , Chap Huot , and had five children with him . Phat Kanhol died from cancer in February 1969 at the age of 49 , while Chap Huot was killed in an explosion a year later . Four of Ranariddh 's half @-@ siblings by his mother and Chap Huot were killed during the Khmer Rouge years , while one of them , Chap <unk> survived . Chap <unk> served as the governor of Siem Reap Province between 1998 and 2004 . 
 Ranariddh met his first wife , Eng Marie in early 1968 . Marie was the eldest child of Eng <unk> , an Interior Ministry official of Sino @-@ Khmer descent , and Sarah Hay , a Muslim of Cham ethnicity . Marie had nine younger siblings , and among them was Roland Eng , the former ambassador to Thailand and the United States . The couple married in September 1968 at the royal palace , and had three children : <unk> ( born 1970 ) , <unk> ( born 1972 ) and Rattana Devi ( born 1973 ) . The couple separated , and Marie filed for divorce in March 2006 when Ranariddh 's relationship with Ouk Phalla became known . The divorce was not finalised until June 2010 . Ranariddh has two sons with Ouk Phalla : <unk> ( born 2003 ) , and <unk> ( born 2011 ) . Phalla is a descendant of King Sisowath and was a classical dancer . She met Ranariddh when the latter was producing and directing the movie , Raja Bori .

 = = Plot = = 
 One year after the first film , college student Kimberly Corman is headed to Daytona Beach , Florida for spring break with her friends , Shaina McKlank , Dano Estevez , and Frankie Whitman . En route , Kimberly has a premonition of logs falling off a semi , causing a massive car crash that kills everyone involved . She stalls her car on the entrance ramp , preventing several people from entering the highway , including Lottery winner Evan Lewis ; widow Nora Carpenter and her fifteen @-@ year @-@ old son Tim ; businesswoman Kat Jennings ; stoner Rory Peters ; pregnant Isabella Hudson ; high school teacher Eugene Dix ; and Deputy Marshal Thomas Burke . While Thomas questions Kimberly , the pileup occurs . Shaina , Dano and Frankie are killed by a speeding truck , but Kimberly is saved by Thomas . 
 The survivors are brought to the police station , where they learn about the curse of Flight 180 . Later , a chain reaction causes a fire in Evan 's apartment which he barely escapes ; but when Evan slips the escape ladder falls and impales his eye . Thomas researches the survivors of Flight 180 , and discovers that Alex Browning was killed by a falling brick . Kimberly visits Clear Rivers , the last survivor of Flight 180 , who is now a voluntary inmate at a psychiatric ward . Clear refuses to help , but while arguing with Kimberly realizes that the survivors are dying in reverse , and warns Kimberly to look out for " signs " of Death . Upon arriving home , Kimberly has a vision of a flock of pigeons attacking her and she and Thomas rush to save Nora and Tim , but they arrive too late and Tim is crushed by a glass pane at a dentist . Clear decides to help and introduces Kimberly Thomas to mortician William Bludworth , who tells them that only " new life " can defeat Death . They believe that if Isabella has her baby it will ruin Death 's plan and they will all be safe . 
 Isabella is accused of driving a stolen van and taken into custody , while the other survivors reunite for safety . After Nora is decapitated by malfunctioning elevator doors , the group leaves to find Isabella , who has gone into labor at the police station , while the policeman on duty rushes Isabella to the hospital in her van . Along the way they discover they have all cheated death twice ; had it not been for the survivors of Flight 180 they would all be dead , which explains why the survivors are dying in reverse . Since Thomas saved Kimberly from being hit by the truck , she is last on Death 's list . 
 The survivors ' vehicle suffers a blowout , prompting them to swerve onto a farm . The back of the car is penetrated by PVC pipes which injure Eugene , and he is rushed to the hospital . As rescuers arrive at the scene , Brian Gibbons , the son of a farm owner , is nearly killed by a speeding news van , but Rory saves him . Using the Jaws of Life Kat 's rescuer accidentally activates the airbag and her head is impaled by a pipe protruding from her headrest . Her cigarette falls out of her hand and into a gasoline leak leading to the news van , causing the van to explode , and sending a barbed wire fence flying through the air , which kills Rory . 
 Kimberly , Clear and Thomas rush to the hospital , and Kimberly has another vision of Dr. Ellen Kalarjian " strangling " Isabella . After Thomas immobilizes Dr. Kalarjian , Kimberly and Thomas witness Isabella give birth and assume they have cheated death . However , Kimberly has another vision of someone with bloody hands in a submerging van and realizes that Isabella was never meant to die in the pile @-@ up . 
 Clear searches for Eugene , but accidentally causes his room to explode from an oxygen combustion , killing them both . Kimberly realizes the person in her vision was herself and immerses a van in a lake to drown herself . Kimberly is rescued by Thomas and resuscitated by Kalarjian , which was her actual premonition , granting her new life . Sometime later , Kimberly and Thomas have a picnic with Brian 's family and Kimberly 's father to celebrate their survival . There they learn of Brian 's deterrence from Death when his father tells them he was almost hit by a van , but Rory saved him .

 Final Destination was conceived by writers Jeffrey Reddick , James Wong , and Glen Morgan from Flight 180 , a spec script intended for use in The X @-@ Files . The film premiered across the United States and Canada on March 17 , 2000 , grossing $ 10 @,@ 015 @,@ 822 on its opening weekend and an overall gross of $ 112 @,@ 880 @,@ 294 internationally . The film 's success inspired New Line Cinema then @-@ President of Production Toby Emmerich to approach Reddick for a sequel , to which he responded positively . Reddick asserted that he " wanted to expand on the mythology and not just tell the same story over again . ” Unfortunately , Wong and Morgan weren 't available for production since they had already signed on their respective projects The One and Willard . Instead , New Line hired second unit director and stunt coordinator David R. Ellis as director and writing partners Eric Bress and J. <unk> Gruber as co @-@ writers . " Second unit is like an extension of directing , you ’ re doing big action sequences on film and it was just something I was going after . Once I got the offer from New Line and we got a good script , it was kind of a natural transition , " Ellis professed . " I wanted our film to be able to stand alone but I watched Final Destination to see what they did that was so successful . I tried to use some of that while trying to keep a stand @-@ alone feel for our movie . I kind of took what worked and tried to improve on it , " Ellis added . " We wanted to take what the first film did effectively , and add levels and layers that would come out through the characters . When we first started writing this , we were trying to think , ' How can we make Death just a total badass ? ' and to be perfectly honest , the first crack we ever took at this script had to be reined in ! " Bress uncovered . On the other hand , producers Craig Perry and Warren Zide from Zide / Perry Productions also returned and helped on financing the film . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 The protagonist of the prior film , Alex Browning ( Devon Sawa ) , was killed off @-@ screen in the film . Rumors indicated that Sawa had a contract dispute with New Line concerning the deduction of his salary ; however , Perry resolved the issue with the statement that " it had everything to do with narrative , and nothing to do with money or Devon ’ s unwillingness to come back . " Despite this , New Line reinstated Ali Larter to reprise her character as Clear Rivers . " When New Line asked me to come back , I thought it was great . They showed me the script and let me have some input , and it was really terrific , " Larter revealed . Larter indicated that Clear " [ has ] gotten to a hardened place and tucked herself inside because she has felt so much pain in her life . By having herself committed to a mental hospital , she has created a safehouse so that Death can 't get her . " Tony Todd also resumed his character as mortician William Bludworth . " It ’ s the same character that we saw before that the audience loved , " Ellis expressed . 
 The role of Kimberly Corman was given to Canadian actress A.J. Cook , who previously starred in the 1999 film The Virgin Suicides . Cook described her role as " a very strong girl , very determined because her mother died a year earlier , right in front of her eyes , so she had to grow up quick . " Ellis described her role as " a girl who can have some fun cause they 're going on a trip and they 're gonna have a good time , yet someone who can stand up to Clear , to come and challenge Clear on a race , and to bother with Clear . " Cook added that " it 's rare to find one strong female lead in a horror film , not to mention two [ Larter ] . ” Ellis and Perry were amazed by her sensitivity and vulnerability in her performance , and she was hired instantly . " [ We ] were at the beginning of what 's going to be a long successful career for her , " Perry cited . Michael Landes , who appeared in the TV series Lois & Clark : The New Adventures of Superman , was cast as Thomas Burke . Landes defined him as " a real nice , decent guy who comes across this huge car accident [ and ] who is very intrigued to begin with " and as " the guy who bumps into the girl and he goes nuts as her protector . " Ellis pointed out that he " just wanted to find someone who 's young and who can relate to these kids . It wasn 't an older guy , but still strong enough and yet sensitive . [ Landes ] brought this really good balance to his part . " Landes was cast a day after his audition , which caused flight schedule problems on his departure two days after and cancellation of his appointments . 
 Former Living Single star T. C. Carson was hired as Eugene Dix . Carson identified his role as " a very by @-@ the @-@ book type of person but soon has a change of heart as the corpses begin to pile up . " The crew was enticed of Carson 's casting , with Bress mentioning how his " originally envisioned Woody Allen @-@ type of character has got ten more times life than it ever had . It 's got ten times the personality , this charisma that T.C. brings to it ... he 's just such a great presence . " Similarly , Perry was astonished by how Carson " can take the most absurd lines and deliver them in such <unk> form with his eyes and his deep rich speaking voice . " Jonathan Cherry , who recently emerged in the 2003 film House of the Dead , was appointed as Rory Peters . Cherry characterized Rory as " a very opposite of me whose arc goes from , ' I don 't really care at all ' , to ' Oh my God , this is really happening ! ' " In the script , Bress said that Rory was his favorite character to write since " he 's great comic relief , he 's got a drug problem , he 's funny , and he 's all that . " Bress bragged that " Cherry is awesome , awesome casting cause he 's just so funny and the way he delivers his lines . It 's like ' Oh yeah . That 's good ! That 's better ! ' " " What I think was surprising on him was that from all of the humor he 's involved and his sort of itchiness that he has with Kat , there is some moments where he reveals how vulnerable he really is and so the shield comes down and right in there you 're really becoming sympathetic to Rory . You like him at first cause he 's the funny guy , but then you care about him because you realize that there 's a place that humor comes from that we all share , " Perry appended . 
 <unk> actress Keegan Connor Tracy played Kat Jennings . Tracy claimed that " [ Kat ] doesn 't really buy it at first , but pretty soon even her cynical attitude can 't ignore the truth of the situation they 're all in . " Perry defined the role as " someone who is really so self @-@ absorbed that without being overly malicious is incredibly rude and insensitive to the feelings of all those around her . " Her casting was assessed by Perry as " full of energy " and " embodies the self @-@ aware nervous energy of Kat . [ Tracy ] created a character that you kind of dislike intensely but you don 't dislike so much that you don 't understand why she is the way she is . " Rounding up the cast are Lynda Boyd ( Rachel Todd in You , Me and the Kids ) as widow Nora Carpenter and James Kirk ( Kyle Morgan in Once Upon a Christmas ) as her son Tim Carpenter , David <unk> ( Hunter Kerrigan in Just Deal ) as gambler Evan Lewis , Justina Machado ( Vanessa Diaz in Six Feet Under ) as pregnant Isabella Hudson , and Noel Fisher ( Todd <unk> of X @-@ Men : Evolution ) as farmer Brian Gibbons . Novice actors Sarah Carter , Alejandro Rae , and Shaun <unk> were hired as Kimberly 's friends Shaina McKlank , Dano Estevez , and Frankie Whitman correspondingly . Andrew Airlie portrayed Kimberly 's father Michael Corman , while Enid @-@ Raye Adams appeared as Dr. Ellen Kalarjian . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Likewise the first film , the film was shot in and around Vancouver Island . " We know the arena , we know the people up there and let 's be honest , there ’ s an enormous economic incentive to shoot there . We were very fortunate to get [ unit production manager ] Justis Greene , who ’ s been working as a line producer up there for 30 years and who was able to get us the best crew working in town right now . It was advantageous to us on so many levels , that it was just the right place to go for this movie , " Perry stated as the reason for the film 's production in British Columbia . British Columbia Highway 19 was utilized as Route 23 . The Plaza of Nations was used as a stand @-@ in for Ellis Medical Complex , the site of Tim 's death . 
 The farm and lake scenes were filmed in Campbell River and Okanagan Lake respectively , though it is depicted in Greenwood Lake , New York . " We shot part of it at the lake where it was 37 ° cold , which is beyond an ice cream headache . And the second stuff we shot in a big huge tank where we filmed all the underwater sequence , that was in a 93 ° pool , " Landes clarified . Cook and Landes performed their own stunts in both sequences . " My biggest fear is being trapped in a car underwater . So it was kind of cool to face my fear and all that , " Cook divulged . " We took a couple of lessons with a scuba guide to be comfortable being underwater and breathing off the regulator , " Landes enunciated . 
 To avoid confusion with Larter and Carter , Cook was required to dye her hair brown for the role . " I like being a chameleon . It opens you up for so much more in this work . You don 't get typecast , " Cook professed . Landes also denied plots regarding Thomas and Kimberly 's relationship . " It 's kind of a protected relationship , more like a brother / sister thing than a love interest . They didn ’ t want to go there , I guess . They did go that way in an earlier draft of the script but they didn ’ t want it to seem like the cop is like lascivious or something . So what they have now , hopefully , is a little bit of chemistry and you get the idea that through tragedy something good will come . So it ends in an optimistic way , that maybe they can be together but there ’ s no real love story , " Landes articulated . 
 = = = Effects = = = 
 Digital Dimension took charge of the visual effects of the film . CG supervisor Jason Crosby pointed out that their studio was mainly selected for the highway sequence after the crew realized real logs only bounced about an inch off the road when dropped from a logging truck . " They were concerned about how they would make the shot happen , not knowing if CG would work . The timing was great because we had just finished a test shot of our CG logs bouncing on the freeway . We sent a tape to Vancouver and after seeing it the crew was convinced that any of the log shots could be done with CG , " Crosby indicated . " It began with R & D on the log dynamics . Scripts were written to help manage the dynamic simulations with real world numbers for gravity , density , etc . The results were remarkably similar to the original logs shot in Vancouver , a testament to the accuracy of the software and the data we had collected , however the logs still lacked the ' jumping through windshields killer instinct ' we were looking for . By tweaking the parameters , we coaxed the logs into a much livelier role . " Senior technical director James Coulter added creative 3D tracking on shots with fast pans , motion blur , and filters such as dust , mist , slabs of bark , broken chains , and other debris . Digital artist Edmund <unk> manipulated high resolution photos which were carefully stitched together to achieve realistic texture amongst the 22 CG logs of the film . Hair shaders were also <unk> for splintering and frayed wood looks for the logs . Physics such as speed and height of the logging truck , length and width of the logs , type of wood and density of a Douglas @-@ fir were also considered . 
 In spite of this , there are no CG cars incorporated in the actual film . " It was a possibility in the beginning so we did some dynamics tests using the logs as rigid bodies to hit cars with soft body <unk> on them , but when they were done shooting they didn ’ t end up needing any CG cars , " Crosby avowed . <unk> of the actors were also used for all of the death scenes , including the highway setting . Landes experienced claustrophobia during the procedure . Fake blood was also used , but CG blood was also shown .

 Like its predecessor , no official album accompanied the motion picture ; however , there are ten songs featured in the film itself and two music videos embedded in its subsequent home release . Two singles of The Sounds , Dance with Me and Rock ' n Roll , were promoted on Kimberly 's car stereo . Besides these , the music video of Seven Days a Week accompanied the film 's DVD . Middle of Nowhere by The Blank Theory was both heard on Evan 's car radio and inserted in the DVD along with its music video . Rocky Mountain High by John Denver was covered twice in the end credits by Pete Snell and Jude <unk> . <unk> also performed My Name is Death during Brian 's death and the end credits . Other songs integrated were Highway to Hell by AC / DC ( on Kimberly 's car AV ) , Jon F.

 Analogous to its forerunner , the film received generally mixed reviews from critics . Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports 48 % of critics gave the film positive write @-@ ups based on 109 reviews , with an average rating of 5 / 10 . The site 's consensus of opinion is that " This sequel is little more than an excuse to stage elaborate , gory scenes of characters getting killed off . " At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the film holds an average score of 38 based on 25 reviews . On June 14 , 2010 , Nick Hyman of Metacritic included Final Destination 2 in the website 's editorial 15 Movies the Critics Got Wrong , denoting that " the elaborate suspense / action set pieces from the first two films are more impressive than most . " 
 Negative evaluations condemned the film 's plot , acting , and screenplay . Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun @-@ Times <unk> that " perhaps movies are like history , and repeat themselves , first as tragedy , then as farce . " James Berardinelli of ReelViews stressed that " the movie mandates complete gullibility and vacuous attention in order to work on any level . " Claudia Puig of USA Today <unk> on how that " there is an audience for a movie in which innocent people suffer hideous accidental deaths is troubling enough , but a group of creative people chose to direct their energies on this repulsive spectacle [ which ] simply provokes disgust . " Justine Elias of The Village Voice asserted that " this risible thriller is merely a sadistic series of misread premonitions and vile murders . " David Grove of Film Threat stated that " [ he ] wasn ’ t much scared by anything in Final Destination 2 which is silly and illogical . " Jeff Vice of Deseret News censured to " not even get into the awful script or the numbingly awful performances " ; while Bruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly reviled " everything else about the film is also deadly . " 
 Conversely , other columnists applauded the film 's comedic theme . A. O. Scott of The New York Times imparted " it 's not as cheekily knowing as the Scream movies or as <unk> Grand Guignol as the Evil Dead franchise , but like those pictures it recognizes the close relationship between fright and laughter , and dispenses both with a free , unpretentious hand . " C. W. <unk> of San Francisco Chronicle conveyed its " funnier than the original . " Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide pronounced " if this is your idea of fun , step right up . " William Arnold of Seattle Post @-@ Intelligencer found it as " a series of Grand Guignol skits played for mean @-@ spirited laughs . " Marc Savlov of Austin Chronicle admired how " it is surprisingly good fun for the current crop of horror films , reasonably well @-@ plotted and full of jaw @-@ dropping , white @-@ knuckle scares . That said , it ’ s most definitely not for the squeamish nor the easily offended . " Nev Pierce of BBC saw that " it 's simple , but effective " ; whereas Sheila Norman @-@ Culp of The Atlanta Journal @-@ Constitution proclaimed that " what Final Destination did for the fear of flying , Final Destination 2 does for the fear of driving . " 
 Amongst the cast ensemble , Carson , Cherry , Cook , Landes , Larter , and Todd were prominent amidst the analysis for their performances as Eugene , Rory , Kimberly , Thomas , Clear , and Bludworth respectively . Koehler of Variety said that " Carson as skeptical Eugene energizes what had been a rote conception on the page " ; " Cherry offered some dry comic balance " ; Larter was " casted little light " ; Todd was squandered by his " single , distinctly flat scene " ; and " the generally awful <unk> , led by Cook , whose blurry grasp of emotions betrays Ellis ' apparent disinterest in his actors . " Grove of Film Threat panned Cook , uttering that " she ’ s no great actress , but she ’ s a real looker " and teased that " since when did a horror movie suffer from having two dumb blondes as leads " , the other actress referring to Larter , whom " spends the whole movie looking miserable with her frigid acting . " Dustin Putman of <unk> commented how " Cook is serviceable as the premonition @-@ fueled Kimberly , but doesn 't evoke enough emotion in the scenes following the brutal deaths of her close friends . " Robin Clifford of Reeling Reviews stated that " Cook was strident as the catalyst that sparks events with her premonitions of disaster and her fervent desire to cheat the Reaper " whereas Larter was " giving the smart @-@ ass edge her character needs " ; while Brett <unk> of Oh , The Horror ! claimed that Larter " is again the bright spot " , along with Cook and Landes who were " serviceable as leads " and Todd " whose purpose has still yet to be revealed in the franchise .

 = Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism = 
 Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism is the conviction of the Sri Lankan Tamil people , a minority ethnic group in the South Asian island country of Sri Lanka ( formerly known as Ceylon ) , that they have the right to constitute an independent or autonomous political community . This idea has not always existed . Sri Lankan Tamil national awareness began during the era of British rule during the nineteenth century , as Tamil Hindu revivalists tried to counter Protestant missionary activity . The revivalists , led by <unk> Navalar , used literacy as a tool to spread Hinduism and its principles . 
 The reformed legislative council , introduced in 1921 by the British , was based on principles of communal representation , which led the Tamils to realize that they were the minority ethnic group and that they should be represented by a member of their own community . It was under this communal representation that Tamil national awareness changed to national consciousness — a less passive state . They formed a Tamil political party called the All Ceylon Tamil Congress ( ACTC ) . In the years leading to Sri Lankan independence , political tension began to develop between the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil communities as the ACTC , citing the possibility of the majority Sinhalese adopting a dominant posture , pushed for “ fifty @-@ fifty ” representation in parliament . This policy would allot half the seats in parliament to the Sinhalese majority and half to the minority communities : the Muslims , the Tamils and the Indian Tamils . 
 After Sri Lanka achieved independence in 1948 , the ACTC decided to merge with the ruling United National Party ( UNP ) . This move was not supported by half of the ACTC members and resulted in a split — one half of the party decided to merge with the UNP and the other half decided to leave the party altogether , forming a new Tamil party in 1949 , the Federal party . Policies adopted by successive Sinhalese governments , and the 1956 success of the Sinhala Nationalist government under Solomon Bandaranaike , made the Federal Party the main voice of Tamil politics . Increased racial and political tension between the two communities led to the merger of all Tamil political parties into the Tamil United Liberation Front . This was followed by the emergence of a militant , armed form of Tamil nationalism . 
 = = Before Independence = = 
 = = = Early beginning = = = 
 The arrival of Protestant missionaries on a large scale to Sri Lanka ( then called Ceylon ) , beginning in 1814 , was a primary contributor to the development of political awareness among Tamils . The activities of missionaries from the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions , Methodists and Anglican churches led to a revival among Tamils of the Hindu faith . <unk> Navalar led a Hindu religious revivalist and reformist movement as a defensive response to the threat to their native culture posed by the British colonial and missionary activities . He translated literary works to encourage the use of the Tamil Language and spread Hindu Saiva principles . Navalar ’ s efforts to revive Hinduism , the predominant religion of the Sri Lankan Tamil people , influenced Tamils who built their own schools , temples , and societies , and who published literature to counter that of the missionaries . Thus , by 1925 nearly 50 schools , including the <unk> Seminary , were fully functioning . This revival movement also set the stage for modern Tamil prose . 
 The success of this effort led the Tamils to think confidently of themselves as a community and prepared the way for their awareness of a common cultural , religious and <unk> kinship in the mid @-@ nineteenth century . For these contributions to the Tamil people , Arumugam Navalar has been described as a leader who gave his community a distinct identity . 
 = = = Communal Consciousness = = = 
 Great Britain controlled the whole island by 1815 , and unified the country administratively in 1833 with a legislative council that acted as advisor to the Governor . The council was composed of three Europeans and one representative each of the Sinhalese , the Sri Lankan Tamils , and the Burghers . But this situation changed in 1919 with the arrival of British Governor William Manning , who actively encouraged the idea of " communal representation " . He created the reformed legislative council in 1921 and its first election returned thirteen Sinhalese and three Tamils , a significant loss in representation for the Tamils when compared to the previous council based on direct appointment by the governor . Because of this , the Tamils began to develop a communal consciousness and to think of themselves as a minority community . They focused on communal representation in the council rather than national representation , and decided that their delegates should be leaders from their own community . This new sense of community identity changed the direction of Tamil nationalism . Starting in the mid @-@ 1920s , their developing national awareness transformed into a more active national consciousness , with a heightened determination to protect the interests of the Ceylon Tamil community . Influenced heavily by political history and , perhaps more importantly , Colombo @-@ centered developments of the British administration , this emerging Tamil national consciousness led to the establishment of the All Ceylon Tamil Congress headed by Tamil politician , G. G. Ponnambalam . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 Historic changes occurred in 1931 : the reformed legislative council was eliminated , and the <unk> Commission , which rejected communal representation , was formed . Instead , the Commission introduced universal franchise , in which representation was proportionate to percentage of population . The Tamil leadership strongly opposed this plan , realizing that they would be reduced to a minority in parliament . Many Sinhalese were also against the idea of universal franchise for all <unk> G. Ponnambalam publicly protested the <unk> Commission and proposed to the Soulbury Commission , which had replaced the <unk> Commission , that roughly equal numbers of congressional seats be assigned to Tamils and to Sinhalese in the new independent Ceylon being planned , but his proposal was rejected . From the introduction of the advisory council , through the <unk> Commission in 1931 , to the Soulbury Commission in 1947 , the primary dispute between the elite of the Sinhalese and Tamils was over the question of representation , not the structure of the government . This issue of power @-@ sharing was used by the nationalists of both communities to create an escalating inter @-@ ethnic rivalry which has been gaining momentum ever since . 
 Ponnambalam 's advocacy of Tamil nationalism was paralleled by a similar Sinhala nationalism of Sinhala Maha Sabha , led by future Prime Minister Solomon Bandaranaike . This created tension between the two leaders and caused the exchange of verbal attacks , with Ponnampalam calling himself a " proud Dravidian " . This interethnic and political stress led to the first Sinhala @-@ Tamil riot in 1939 . ( see Riots and pogroms in Sri Lanka ) 
 = = After Independence = = 
 = = = All Ceylon Tamil Congress = = = 
 The All Ceylon Tamil Congress ( ACTC ) , founded by G. G. Ponnambalam in 1944 , was popular among Tamils because it promoted the preservation of Tamil identity . The ACTC advocated a " fifty @-@ fifty " policy , in which fifty percent of the seats in parliament would be reserved for Tamils and other minorities , the remaining fifty percent going to the Sinhalese . Which means 50 % of the opportunities [ Education ( University seats ) , Employment , etc . ) should be allocated to minorities . According to the ACTC this was a necessary defensive measure to prevent unwarranted dominance by the Sinhalese . In 1947 , Ponnambalam warned the Soulbury Commission about this potential problem , and presented the ACTC 's solution , which he called a " balanced representation " . This fifty @-@ fifty policy was opposed by a Muslim minority and sections of the Tamil community . D. S. Senanayake , the leader of the Sinhalese political groups , allowed Ponnambalam full control over presentations before the Soulbury Commission , prevented Sinhalese nationalists such as Solomon Bandaranaike from taking the stage , and avoided the eruption of acrimonious arguments . But the Soulbury commission rejected the charges of discrimination against the Tamils , and also rejected the fifty @-@ fifty formula as subverting democracy . 
 Later the ACTC decided to adopt a new policy : " responsive cooperation " with " progressive @-@ minded Sinhalese " . Yet in 1948 , Ponnampalam decided to merge the ACTC with the ruling United National Party ( UNP ) , although he had stated earlier that the UNP was not progressive @-@ minded . The merge was not supported by the entire party , and it ended up splitting the ACTC in half , with one faction merging with D. S. Senanayake ’ s UNP and the other , led by <unk> Chelvanayakam , deciding to leave the party altogether and advocated for equal rights , 100 % opportunities for Tamils without any racial barrier . In 1948 , Ponnampalam voted in favour of one of several bills , later known as the Ceylon Citizenship Act which disenfranchised Indian Tamils ( " Hill Country Tamils " ) . Although he did not vote for the other bills in the Ceylon Citizenship Act , because of his silence in parliament the Tamil public believed that he was not committed to Indian Tamil rights . The ACTC remained the major Tamil political party until 1956 , when the Federal Party took over that position . The Tamil Congress still held parliamentary positions , however , and continued to be a force in Tamil politics . In 1976 , the ACTC merged with other Tamil political factions to form a new party called the Tamil United Liberation Front ( TULF ) . According to A. J Wilson , it was the legacy of Ponnampalam that the consciousness of the Tamil people was raised , and they were inspired to see themselves as a separate Tamil national identity rather as merged in an all @-@ island polity . 
 = = = Federal Party = = = 
 In 1949 , a new Tamil party , called the Federal Party ( " <unk> <unk> Arasu <unk> " ) , was organized by the people who broke away from the ACTC . Led by Chelvanayakam , it gained popularity among the Tamil people because it advocated Tamil rights . Its popularity was also due to the party 's opposition to the Ceylon Citizenship Act and the Sinhala Only Act . As a result , the Federal party became the dominant party in the Tamil districts after the 1956 elections . Despite this , the Federal Party never asked for a separate Tamil state or even for self @-@ determination . Instead they lobbied for a unified state which gave Tamil and Sinhalese equal status as the official language and provided for considerable autonomy in the Tamil areas . It was against this backdrop that the Bandaranaike @-@ Chelvanayakam Pact was signed in July 1957 , but pressure from the opposition and extremist groups forced Bandaranaike to abolish the pact . After the assassination of Bandaranaike , another pact was signed in 1965 between Chelvanayakam and Dudley <unk> called the Dudley @-@ Chelvanayakam Pact , but this agreement , like the Bandaranaike @-@ Chelvanayakam pact , was never implemented . The UNP was defeated in the 1970 election and replaced by the United Front ( UF ) , led by <unk> Bandaranaike , the widow of Solomon Bandaranaike . 
 The new government adopted two new policies that discriminated against the Tamil people . First , the government introduced a double standard for admission grades to universities , requiring the Tamil students to achieve higher grades than the Sinhalese students . Secondly , the same kind of policy was adopted for jobs as public servants , which were held by less than ten percent of the Tamil @-@ speaking population . The Federal Party opposed these policies , and as a result Chelvanayakam resigned his parliamentary seat in October 1972 . Shortly after , in 1973 , the Federal Party decided to demand a separate , autonomous Tamil state . Until 1973 , Chelvanayakam and the Federal Party had always campaigned for a unified country and thought that any partitioning would be “ suicidal ” . The new policies , however , were considered to be discriminatory by the Tamil leadership , and this modified the official position on Tamil Nationalism . To further the new political agenda , in 1975 the Federal Party merged with the other Tamil political parties to become the Tamil United Liberation Front ( TULF ) . In 1976 , after the first national convention of TULF , the Ceylon Tamils moved toward a revised nationalism and were now unwilling to live within a confined , single @-@ island entity . 
 = = = Tamil United Liberation Front = = = 
 The Tamil United Liberation Front ( TULF ) was formed when the Tamil political parties merged and adopted the Vaddukoddai Resolution , named after the village , Vaddukoddai , where it was developed . In the 1977 election , TULF became the first Tamil Nationalist party to run on a separatist platform . It gained a majority of the votes in the north and east , won 18 seats , and became the largest opposition party in parliament . The Vaddukoddai Resolution had a profound effect on Tamil politics — the parliamentary system was soon to be replaced by guns . TULF tried to refashion itself as the political division , negotiating an agreement with the executive president of Sri Lanka at that time , J.R. <unk> . This agreement , known as the District Development Councils ’ Scheme , was passed in 1980 , but TULF rejected it because J.R. <unk> had not agreed to let TULF have the five District <unk> in the five Tamil districts where TULF received the most votes . The Sixth Amendment was passed in 1983 , requiring Tamils in parliament and other public offices to take an oath of allegiance to the unified state of Sri Lanka . It forbade the advocating of a separate state , and consequently TULF members were expelled from parliament for refusing to take the oath . 
 = = = Militant groups = = = 
 After the expulsion of TULF from parliament , militants ruled the Tamil political movement . As a result , the 1970s saw the emergence of more than 30 Tamil militant groups . Anton <unk> , the theoretician of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) , states that the causes of the militarization of the Tamil youth were unemployment , lack of opportunities for higher education , and the imposition of an alien language . He further alleges that the majority Sinhalese government was responsible for these problems , adding that the only alternative left for Tamil youths was a " revolutionary armed struggle for the independence of their nation " . Only five of the militant groups — People 's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam ( <unk> ) , Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization ( <unk> ) , Eelam People 's Revolutionary Liberation Front ( <unk> ) , Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students ( EROS ) and LTTE — remained a potent political force ; the rest were flawed ideologically and therefore not strictly Tamil Nationalist factions . 
 Of these five dominant groups , the LTTE is the most solidly nationalistic Tamil resistance organization . Furthermore , because of its policies , constructive Tamil Nationalist platform , and desire for national self @-@ determination , the LTTE is supported by major sections of the Tamil community . It had established a de facto state in the areas under its control , called Tamil Eelam , and had managed a government in these areas , providing state functions such as courts , a police force , a human rights organization , and a humanitarian assistance <unk> a health board , and an education board . In addition , it ran a bank ( Bank of Tamil Eelam ) , a radio station ( Voice of Tigers ) and a television station ( National Television of Tamil Eelam ) .

 = 2010 Michigan Wolverines football team = 
 The 2010 Michigan Wolverines football team represented the University of Michigan in the 2010 NCAA Division I FBS football season . Michigan played its home games at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor , Michigan and competed in the Big Ten Conference . The season was the first since the renovation of Michigan Stadium , begun in 2007 , was completed . The Wolverines were led by third @-@ year head coach Rich Rodriguez . After its week 10 win against Illinois , Michigan became bowl eligible for the first time since 2007 , and later accepted a bid to play in the Gator Bowl against Mississippi State on January 1 , 2011 , losing 52 – 14 . The Wolverines finished the season sixth out of 120 Division I FBS teams in total offense , 110th in total defense and 112th in passing defense . Michigan finished with an overall record of 7 – 6 , 3 – 5 in Big Ten play . After the season , head coach Rich Rodriguez and his staff were dismissed on January 5 , 2011 . 
 Several individual players had standout performances . Quarterback Denard Robinson set several school records , became the first quarterback in college football history to rush and pass for 1 @,@ 500 yards , and finished sixth in Heisman Trophy voting . He surpassed Drew Brees ' single @-@ season Big Ten Conference total offense record and the FBS single @-@ season quarterback rushing record . He also won the 2010 Big Ten rushing title , the Chicago Tribune Silver Football for being the Big Ten 's Most Valuable Player , and was named the Big Ten 's Offensive Player of the Year . 
 Jonas Mouton was the Big Ten 's statistical champion in tackles , while Jordan Kovacs finished second . In conference games alone , Roy Roundtree led the conference in receiving yards per game , in part on the strength of a school single @-@ game record 246 @-@ yard outing against Illinois . Reserve quarterback Tate Forcier also set a school single @-@ game completion percentage record with a 12 @-@ for @-@ 12 performance against Bowling Green . The defense also set several records , including most points allowed and yards allowed . 
 = = Preseason = = 
 In 2009 , the Wolverines started out 4 – 0 , but finished the season 5 – 7 and missed a bowl game for the second year in a row . Michigan finished the season seventh in the Big Ten in total offense and ninth in total defense . 
 The team entered the season surrounded by questions of how they would overcome the late season collapse from last year and what it would take for Rich Rodriguez to return for a fourth year . On January 5 , Michigan hired David Brandon to replace Bill Martin as its athletic director . Martin had previously announced his retirement during the 2009 season . Reaction to the hire was positive , but the hire also brought increased scrutiny upon Rich Rodriguez , as Brandon made it clear that he would do whatever was necessary to turn the program around from its recent slump . 
 The team also faced uncertainty relating to who would be the starting quarterback . While it was expected that Tate Forcier would retain his starting job , the build @-@ up to the season led to a quarterback controversy that turned into a three way battle between Forcier , Denard Robinson , and highly touted recruit Devin Gardner . On defense , Michigan installed a new 3 – 3 – 5 formation that the coaches hoped would better suit the players currently on the team . Michigan lost several key players from the previous season , including DE Brandon Graham , the 2009 Big Ten defensive Most Valuable Player , RB 's Brandon Minor and Carlos Brown , LB Stevie Brown , and CB Donovan Warren . Michigan suffered a severe blow to its defensive secondary during fall practice , as starting CB Troy Woolfolk suffered a dislocated ankle that ended his season before it began .

 Michigan opened the 2010 season at home against the Connecticut Huskies , the first ever meeting between the two schools . Michigan celebrated the re @-@ dedication of Michigan Stadium with a special flyover by a World War II era B @-@ 25 bomber from the nearby Yankee Air Museum in Ypsilanti Township , and then another flyover immediately following the national anthem by two A @-@ 10 aircraft . Brock Mealer — the brother of Michigan guard Elliot Mealer — led the team onto the field by walking to the banner and touching it , which sparked a standing ovation from the crowd . Elliot Mealer had only recently regained the ability to walk following injuries in a car crash . 
 Although a close game was predicted , the game was the exact opposite , as the Wolverines finally displayed the long sought offensive firepower from a Rich Rodriguez offense . Michigan scored the only points of the first quarter , as Vincent Smith opened the scoring with a 12 @-@ yard touchdown run and quarterback Denard Robinson added another touchdown on a 32 @-@ yard run . Michigan started the second quarter with another touchdown , this time with a 3 @-@ yard run by Michael Shaw . All of Connecticut 's scoring came in the second quarter : a 32 @-@ yard field goal by Dave <unk> , and then a 2 @-@ yard run by Jordan Todman . The only scoring of the third quarter came on a 24 @-@ yard Michigan field goal by Brendan Gibbons . Connecticut managed to enter Michigan 's red zone during the third quarter , but D.J. <unk> fumbled the ball after a hit by J.T. Floyd and Obi Ezeh recovered it to prevent Connecticut from scoring . In the fourth quarter , Smith caught an 11 @-@ yard touchdown pass from Robinson ; however , the extra point attempt was no good . 
 The attendance of 113 @,@ 090 was the highest in college football history . Robinson had 29 carries and completed 19 @-@ of @-@ 22 passes for 186 yards , contributing 383 of Michigan 's 473 total yards . Robinson ran for 197 yards , setting a school record for a quarterback , surpassing Steve Smith , who rushed for 147 yards on four carries at Minnesota on November 12 , 1983 . Michigan committed no turnovers , the first time since the game against Miami ( Ohio ) on September 6 , 2008 . With the win , the Wolverines improved to 108 – 18 – 2 all @-@ time in home openers .

 Following their win against Connecticut , the Wolverines traveled to South Bend , Indiana to take on their long @-@ time rivals , the Notre Dame Fighting Irish , in their first road game of the season . Michigan won the previous year 's contest on a Tate Forcier to Greg Mathews touchdown pass with 11 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter . The game was seen as a crucial test to Michigan 's season , as it was Michigan 's first game in a hostile environment . 
 Notre Dame began the scoring early in the first quarter with a 1 @-@ yard touchdown run by quarterback Dayne Crist ; however , Crist suffered a concussion during the opening drive and was forced to miss the remainder of the first half . Michigan responded with three unanswered touchdowns . First was a 31 @-@ yard reception by Roy Roundtree midway through the first quarter , then a 1 @-@ yard run by Stephen Hopkins near the end of the first , and later an 87 @-@ yard run by QB Denard Robinson , the longest in Notre Dame Stadium history . After halftime , the Fighting Irish responded with two touchdowns and a field goal . First was a 53 @-@ yard pass to TJ Jones , followed by a 24 @-@ yard field goal by David <unk> . Next was a 95 @-@ yard catch by Kyle Rudolph , which put Notre Dame ahead late in the game . Michigan retook the lead with 27 seconds left with a 2 @-@ yard run by Denard Robinson . Michigan 's defense held off Notre Dame on its final drive of the game , with Crist 's final pass sailing over everyone and out of the end zone . 
 Denard Robinson set a school record for total offense at 502 total yards – 258 rushing , 244 passing . The rushing yards set a new high for yards on the ground in one game by a Big Ten quarterback , as Robinson broke the league record of 217 yards set by Mike Kafka at Minnesota on November 1 , 2008 . Robinson became the ninth quarterback in NCAA history to rush and pass for 200 yards or more in a game , the last being West Virginia 's Pat White against Pittsburgh on November 16 , 2006 ( 220 rushing and 204 passing ) . The last 200 @-@ yard rusher for Michigan was Mike Hart , who had 215 yards against Eastern Michigan on October 6 , 2007 .

 After its dramatic win in South Bend against Notre Dame , Michigan played the Division I FCS Massachusetts Minutemen ( UMass ) in Ann Arbor , the first ever meeting between the two teams . Michigan sought to avoid an upset similar to the 2007 team , which lost to Appalachian State . 
 The game proved to be much closer than expected , and much more similar to the upset of 2007 than Michigan desired . On the opening drive , UMass drove to the Michigan 12 @-@ yard line , but was forced to settle for a 29 @-@ yard field goal . On Michigan 's first possession , Denard Robinson threw an interception on the second play ( and first pass ) of the drive . After a defensive stop , Michigan drove 93 yards for a touchdown on a drive that featured passes of 16 yards to Martavious Odoms and 43 yards to Kelvin Grady . Michael Shaw scored the touchdown on a 1 @-@ yard run . Thirty @-@ five seconds into the second quarter , UMass retook the lead on a 7 @-@ yard touchdown run by Jonathan Hernandez , capping a 67 @-@ yard scoring drive . Mid @-@ way through the second quarter , Michigan drove 64 yards ( including 40 rushing yards by Robinson ) , but Seth <unk> missed a 38 @-@ yard field goal attempt . In the closing minutes of the first half , UMass drove 79 yards , capped by the second touchdown run by Hernandez . UMass led 17 – 7 with 1 : 17 remaining in the half , but Michigan stormed back in the final 61 seconds of the half . On Michigan 's first play from scrimmage after the UMass touchdown , Robinson threw a 66 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Darryl Stonum with 1 : 01 left in the half . On the second play from scrimmage after the kickoff , Jordan Kovacs forced a fumble by Hernandez , and Michigan recovered the ball at their own 45 @-@ yard line . Michigan quickly drove 55 yards and scored on a 9 @-@ yard touchdown pass from Robinson to Stonum with 16 seconds left in the half . Michigan led 21 – 17 at halftime on the strength of 259 yards ( 195 passing yards and 64 rushing yards ) of total offense from Denard Robinson . 
 On the opening drive of the second half , Michigan drove 69 yards and scored on Shaw 's 34 @-@ yard touchdown run , his second touchdown of the game . On their second possession of the second half , Michigan drove 94 yards and scored on an 8 @-@ yard run by Robinson . The score marked Michigan 's fourth touchdown in four drives as Michigan scored 28 unanswered points after UMass took the 17 – 7 lead . UMass scored on a 7 @-@ yard touchdown run by Havens at 13 : 47 of the fourth quarter . On Michigan 's first possession of the fourth quarter , Shaw led the way with a 50 @-@ yard run and a 4 @-@ yard touchdown run to put Michigan ahead 42 – 24 . UMass responded with its second touchdown of the quarter on a five @-@ yard pass from Havens to Julian Talley , but missed on the two @-@ point conversion attempt . After a three @-@ and @-@ out by Michigan , UMass blocked Michigan 's punt and drove for its third fourth @-@ quarter touchdown aided by a pass interference penalty against Michigan 's James Rogers . With 2 : 05 left to play , and Michigan leading 42 – 37 , UMass attempted an onside kick that went out of bounds at the 40 @-@ yard line , allowing Michigan to run out the clock for the win . 
 = = = vs. Bowling Green = = = 
 Following its close win against UMass , Michigan hosted the Bowling Green Falcons . This was the first meeting between the schools since 2000 , which saw Michigan emerge victorious 42 – 7 . 
 After the opening kickoff , Michigan drove 80 yards for a touchdown on a 2 @-@ yard run by quarterback Denard Robinson . On its second possession , Michigan drove the ball 88 yards and took a 14 – 0 lead on a 47 @-@ yard run by Robinson . Michigan began its third possession at its own 9 @-@ yard line . Robinson ran 46 yards on the first play of the drive , but he injured his knee and did not return to the game . Devin Gardner substituted for Robinson and concluded the drive with an 11 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Jeremy Gallon . Michigan led 21 – 0 at the end of the first quarter , but Bowling Green scored 14 unanswered points in the second quarter on a 1 @-@ yard run by Jordan Hopgood and a 71 @-@ yard reception by Tyrone <unk> . With Michigan 's lead cut to 7 points , Tate Forcier entered the game late in the second quarter . Forcier completed all 6 of his passes in leading the team on 69 @-@ yard touchdown drive to give Michigan a 28 – 14 lead at halftime .

 After the 2010 season , an NCAA investigation was launched into rules violations by Ohio State , which included allegations that Buckeyes head coach Jim Tressel knowingly played ineligible players during several 2010 games , including the Michigan game . The NCAA investigation , which resulted in Tressel 's resignation , is ongoing and may lead to sanctions ; Ohio State preemptively in July 2011 imposed internal sanctions , one of which was vacating all of Ohio State 's 2010 victories , including the game over Michigan . For this reason , the Columbus Dispatch reported in May 2011 that Ohio State had delayed the award of its traditional " gold pants " charms for the 2010 victory over Michigan .

 William Maldon " Bill " Woodfull OBE ( 22 August 1897 – 11 August 1965 ) was an Australian cricketer of the 1920s and 1930s . He captained both Victoria and Australia , and was best known for his dignified and moral conduct during the tumultuous bodyline series in 1932 – 33 that almost saw the end of Anglo @-@ Australian cricketing ties . Trained as a schoolteacher , Woodfull was known for his benevolent attitude towards his players , and his patience and defensive technique as an opening batsman . Woodfull was not a flamboyant player , but was known for his calm , unruffled style and his reliability in difficult situations . His opening pairing with fellow Victorian Bill Ponsford for both his state and Australia remains one of the most successful in history . While not known for his tactical skills , Woodfull was widely admired by his players and observers for his sportsmanship and ability to mould a successful and loyal team through the strength of his character . 
 Woodfull started playing cricket from a young age , but did not distinguish himself in his youth . He did make his debut in Melbourne 's district competition until the age of 19 , and his progress was interrupted by a posting as a schoolteacher to a country town . After returning to Melbourne in 1921 , he came to the attention of the state selectors , and made his first @-@ class debut for Victoria at the age of 24 late in the 1921 – 22 . After scoring a century in his second match , Woodfull was promoted to open the following season , and he opened for the rest of his career . In his first four seasons at first @-@ class level , he accumulated over 3 @,@ 000 first @-@ class runs at an average beyond 65 . At the end of the 1924 – 25 season , Woodfull scored 522 runs in four innings , including three centuries . After scoring three centuries , including a 236 , in 1925 – 26 , he was selected for the 1926 tour of England . 
 Regarded as one of the last players selected , Woodfull scored a double century and century in his first two innings in England to earn his debut in the first Test . He played in each Test , scoring two centuries . Woodfull made eight centuries during the tour and topped the Australian averages and was named one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year . 
 Upon returning to Australia , Woodfull established his partnership with Ponsford , and in 1926 – 27 Shield season , they put on a record @-@ breaking 375 @-@ run opening stand , setting up a world record first @-@ class team score of 1107 . Woodfull averaged 69 @.@ 00 for the season , and both he and Ponsford averaged over 125 the following summer , overwhelming opposition bowlers and helping Victoria win the Sheffield Shield easily . Woodfull was appointed as vice @-@ captain to Jack Ryder for the 1928 – 29 home Ashes series following a spate of retirements . Woodfull carried his bat in a record @-@ breaking first Test defeat . Although England easily won 4 – 1 , Woodfull stood firm to score three centuries in the last four Tests , and added his best first @-@ class score for 275 not out in a tour match against the Englishmen . The following season , Woodfull 's campaign was truncated by a hand injury . 
 Woodfull reluctantly became captain in 1930 when Jack Ryder was dropped , and his team was derided as the worst Australian squad to tour England . It was the youngest squad to leave Australia , and only four of the fifteen players had prior experience in England , prompting commentators to label the team " Woodfull 's <unk> " . After losing the first Test , Woodfull scored a century as Australia levelled the series and they won the fifth Test to regain the Ashes . Woodfull ended the tour with six first @-@ class centuries . In 1930 – 31 Woodfull broke up his combination with Ponsford and dropped down the order to accommodate Archie Jackson in the Tests against the West Indies . The Australian captain struggled in his unfamiliar role , scoring 204 runs at 34 @.@ 00 for the series , which Australia won 4 – 1 . The following season , restored to his customary position , Woodfull had his most successful Test series in his career , against South Africa , scoring 421 runs at 70 @.@ 17 , including his Test highest score of 161 ; Australia won all five Tests . 
 In 1932 – 33 , great controversy erupted during England 's tour of Australia . The visitors , captained by Douglas Jardine , used bodyline tactics — persistently aiming at the upper bodies and heads of the Australian batsmen in the hope of stifling the hosts ' strong batting line @-@ up . The Australian public and cricket community abhorred the tactic , but Woodfull refused to retaliate or complain publicly , despite some of his players wanting to do so . After the first Test , which Australia lost heavily , Woodfull was not confirmed as captain until just before the start of the next match , prompting speculation that the Australian Board of Control might remove him for refusing to retaliate . The controversy peaked during the third Test at the Adelaide Oval . Woodfull was felled by a blow to the heart , almost provoking a riot . After Woodfull was dismissed , English manager Plum Warner came to privately express his sympathy , to which Woodfull famously replied " I do not want to see you , Mr Warner . There are two teams out there . One is playing cricket and the other is not . " The comment was leaked to the media and caused an uproar , after a teammate suffered a fractured skull , the Australian Board formally complained to English administrators about whether bodyline was sporting . This prompted threats of a trade boycott and a tour cancellation , so the Australian Board retracted . England completed a convincing 4 – 1 victory , but Woodfull was much praised for his stoic public behaviour . The Australian captain batted for 20 hours during the series , defying the bruising bowling for a longer time than any of his compatriots . 
 In 1934 , Woodfull led the Australians back to England for a tour that was to mend relations after assurances had been given that bodyline would not be repeated . The Australians won 2 – 1 , and Woodfull remains the only first captain to regain the Ashes twice . Woodfull was criticised for adopting excessively cautious tactics after the advent of bodyline . Woodfull retired after the tour ; his family claimed that the bodyline controversy had sapped his passion for cricket . The British king offered Woodfull a knighthood for his services to cricket , and in reference to his actions during the bodyline series , but Woodfull declined , stating that his work as a teacher was far more important than cricket . A mathematics teacher , Woodfull went on to become headmaster at his alma mater , Melbourne High School . 
 = = Style = = 
 Woodfull batted in a manner which had little aesthetic pleasure or grace , with Wisden describing stating that " at first sight , he gave the impression of being clumsy " . Affected by a bout of rheumatic fever in childhood , he had stiff @-@ jointed style , and played with little noticeable backlift . This gave the impression of a laboured playing style . Despite this , he scored consistently through good placement and powerful drives generated by his strong forearms . Despite his leaden appearance , he often advanced down the pitch to spin bowling . He was known for playing with a straight bat and a close watch on the ball , which were the core features of a strong defensive ability . He typically took block on leg stump and shuffled across to cover his stumps . His defensive prowess yielded names such as " the <unk> " ( a reference to the fact that he was rarely bowled as a result of missing the ball ) and " <unk> " . The latter epithet was given to him by English bowlers who said that his backlift was so small that it was only enough to decapitate worms that had raised their heads above ground level . He was also known for his reliability in crisis match situations , leading to epithets such as " The Rock " and " Old Steadfast " . Woodfull formed an opening partnership with Bill Ponsford at state and international level which yielded 18 century opening stands . Dubbed " Mutt and Jeff " by team @-@ mates after the famous comic strip duo , as well as " Willy Wo and Willy Po " , they were regarded as one of the finest opening partnerships in Test history . Their Victorian teammates had such faith in the pair that if they were batting , the wicket @-@ keeper and bowlers who batted low in the order would leave the ground to go to work . 
 As a captain , Woodfull was known for his courage and high moral principles in the face of the bodyline series . Fellow player Stan McCabe described him as " the greatest man I ever met " , while wicket @-@ keeper Bert Oldfield said that he had never met a more exemplary character . Oldfield said that Woodfull was a psychologist and humanitarian in addition to a captain . Bradman attributed Woodfull 's success to his ability to command the intense loyalty of his players and convert it into team spirit . Bill O 'Reilly said that Woodfull 's men " all held imperishable memories of his personal touch and his courage " . Ray Robinson said that " nobody thought Bill Woodfull the cat 's whiskers as a strokeplayer but his many qualities made him a pre @-@ eminent leader of men " . He added that " Woodfull 's unrivalled selflessness won fidelity bordering on devotion " . Australian cricket writer Jack Pollard said that " Woodfull had the habit of being where things were tough , and he brought rare dignity to the Australian captaincy " . Pollard compared the respect he commanded from his players to that of Ian Chappell . The English writer RC Robertson @-@ Glasgow said of Woodfull : 
 The most calm @-@ browed cricketer I have seen . He reminded me of a master who gets the whole school to and from a picnic without losing his reason or a boy . Of all the protagonists in that fiercest controversy [ bodyline ] , I should say that he alone came out of it with reputation heightened and personal friendships increased . He neither concealed nor exaggerated a difficulty . 
 Woodfull was known for his gentlemanly nature and his adherence to the spirit of the game . Aside from refusing to retaliate against bodyline , Woodfull refused to exploit loopholes to dismiss batsmen . On one occasion , Jack Fingleton was run out after wandering out of the crease to inspect the crease , without intending to run . A teammate broke the wicket and the umpire upheld the appeal , but Woodfull called Fingleton back . He led his team in an understated way , preferring to give broad objectives to his players and trusting them to choose their own methods to fulfil the task at hand . However , he was known to organise his team tightly on tour to ensure that things proceeded smoothly . 
 Although Woodfull was a devout Methodist , he would show a deep concern in the personal welfare of all players , which extended to finding the location of the nearest Catholic Church for those teammates who followed the religion . At the time , Australian society at large was divided along Catholic @-@ Protestant lines , and while O 'Reilly and McCabe were full of praise for Woodfull , they were later accused of leading a Catholic revolt against the leadership of the Protestant Bradman during a divisive period in the late @-@ 1930s . While Woodfull himself never touched alcohol due to his strict adherence to his religious principles , he did not impose his beliefs on his team . He would buy drinks for his players , and ask administrators to provide more alcohol for his teammates when they were exhausted . At the time , cricketers widely regarded beer as a highly effective means of rehydration , and on one occasion Woodfull threatened to halt play when administrators refused his players more ale on the grounds that they had already consumed their quota . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Born in the central Victorian town of Maldon , Woodfull was the third of four sons of Reverend Thomas Staines Brittingham Woodfull , a Methodist preacher . The <unk> moved to Melbourne when Thomas was given a transfer to Collingwood Methodist Mission , in an inner city suburb . The religious traditionalism stayed with the younger Woodfull throughout his life . He once refused to play an interstate match that was scheduled for Christmas Day . Woodfull 's father installed a net in the backyard and taught him the emphasis on defensive technique and patience that were to become his hallmark . Woodfull attended Melbourne High School and his early career was unremarkable . He made his district cricket debut in 1916 for Essendon , at the age of 19 , but did not distinguish himself . He played no further cricket at the level before he gained his qualification as a schoolteacher in 1919 . Because of a bout of rheumatic fever in childhood , Woodfull had stiff muscles and as a result was rejected when he tried to join the First Australian Imperial Force to fight in World War I. He was posted to Maryborough High School , and it was in the rural cricket competition that he began to gain attention . In 1920 and 1921 , he accumulated 1 @,@ 335 runs at average of 225 @.@ 83 in the local competition . 
 When the England cricket team toured Australia in 1920 – 21 , Woodfull played for a Ballarat XV , and scored 50 and 1 . A teaching transfer in 1921 saw him return to Melbourne , where the Victorian selectors trialled him in Second XI fixtures during the 1921 – 22 season . In two matches against South Australia and New South Wales , he registered unbeaten scores of 186 and 227 respectively . At the time , Victoria had so much depth that their Second XI was of comparable strength to the first @-@ choice teams from other states . 
 In early @-@ 1922 , he made his Sheffield Shield debut against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval . He batted at No. 8 and made an unbeaten 22 . Batting at No. 7 in his second match against Western Australia , Woodfull registered his maiden first @-@ class century with 153 . He was run out in his second and final innings of his debut first @-@ class season , so he was yet to be dismissed by a bowler . Both matches were won by an innings , part of a dominant summer for the Victorians . During this time , he also studied for an arts degree at night in addition to his post at Williamstown High School . 
 The following season , Woodfull was promoted to open and his consistent performances in all conditions meant that he was to play there for the rest of his career . Between 1922 and 1926 , he accumulated over 3 @,@ 000 first @-@ class runs at an average of 67 . 
 In the first match of the 1922 – 23 season , Woodfull scored 74 run out and four not out as Victoria scraped past the Marylebone Cricket Club by two wickets . The next match against New South Wales was Woodfull 's first against Victoria 's arch @-@ rivals . Woodfull made 47 in the first innings before being dismissed by Test leg spinner Arthur Mailey . After exactly 300 first @-@ class runs , a bowler had dismissed him for the first time . He then made an unbeaten 84 to steer his team to a seven @-@ wicket victory . He showed a liking for the South Australian bowlers , scoring 0 , 115 , 123 and 94 not out as Victoria won both of their matches against the aforementioned team . He ended his first full season with 598 runs at 74 @.@ 75 . Despite this , Victoria lost the Sheffield Shield to New South Wales on scoring difference ; both teams had finished equal on points . 
 He played in each match for the Victorian Sheffield Shield team in the 1923 – 24 season , when he scored 300 runs at 37 @.@ 50 , including a 117 against New South Wales . Victoria won all five of their matches and took the title . 
 In a match against New South Wales in 1924 – 25 , he compiled 81 and 120 not out as Victoria managed to take a seven @-@ wicket win after their opponents had accumulated 614 in the first innings . He scored fifties in each of the four other matches , three of which were won . Woodfull ended the Australian season with 494 runs at 61 @.@ 75 . Woodfull was nevertheless omitted for selection in the Tests against the touring England team . As a reward for winning the Sheffield Shield , Victoria embarked on a tour of New Zealand at the end of the season . Woodfull scored 212 not out against Canterbury , before scoring 110 , 50 and 150 against New Zealand without being dismissed at all . The unbeaten 150 was achieved on a sticky wicket . He ended the tour with 706 runs at 176 @.@ 50 . In one two @-@ year period , Woodfull 's defence was so solid that he was never bowled . 
 During the 1925 – 26 season , players were vying for selection for the 1926 Ashes tour . The selectors were interested in Woodfull and selected him for an Australian XI to play the Rest of Australia in a Test trial . He made 11 and 42 as The Rest upset the Australian XI . After three matches without passing 53 , Woodfull added 97 and 236 in a match against South Australia . He scored 126 in the next match , but was unable to stop an innings defeat to New South Wales for the second time in the season . 
 As a result of consistent performances for Victoria , Woodfull was selected for Herbie Collins ' Test team for the 1926 Ashes tour . He scored 148 and 64 as the Australians defeated Tasmania by an innings in consecutive matches before sailing for England . He ended the Australian season with 890 runs at 63 @.@ 57 . 
 = = Test debut = = 
 Despite being regarded as the last man picked for the tour , Woodfull headed the batting averages in the first @-@ class matches and was third in the Tests . 
 In his first two first @-@ class innings on tour , Woodfull struck a 201 against Essex at Leyton and a 118 against Surrey at The Oval . Both were made on damp pitches , with the double century coming in only four hours of batting . Woodfull 's effort was the only double century by an Australian during the tour . They were the first of eight centuries during the tour , in which he compiled 1809 runs at 58 @.@ 35 . 
 After making a duck against the Marylebone Cricket Club , which was a dress rehearsal for the Tests as the MCC fielded a virtual England team , Woodfull scored an unbeaten 98 against Cambridge University before running out of partners . He added 69 against the South of England and 100 against Middlesex and entered the Tests with 653 runs on tour at an average of 59 @.@ 36 . 
 Woodfull made his debut in the first Test at Trent Bridge , but it was an anti @-@ climax ; Australia did not bat in a washed @-@ out match as England reached 0 / 32 when rain ended play . He failed to make an impression in the second Test at Lord 's , scoring 13 and a duck in another drawn match . It capped off an unhappy June for Woodfull ; he had scored only 120 runs at 13 @.@ 33 for the month , with rain interruptions being frequent . 
 Woodfull then regained his form , striking 102 not out in an innings win over Nottinghamshire . He then established himself as a Test opener in the third Test at Headingley , where Australia were sent in to bat on a sticky wicket with erratic bounce . After opening partner Warren Bardsley was dismissed without scoring from the first ball , Woodfull put on a second wicket partnership of 235 with Charlie Macartney to register his maiden Test century of 141 . Macartney launched a vicious counterattack and became the second Australian to score a Test century before lunch on the opening day ; this bold play helped Woodfull to settle in and the Australians to seize the initiative on a bowler @-@ friendly surface . The tourists made 494 on the sticky wicket and forced England to follow on , but were unable to finish them off . 
 After scoring 65 against Lancashire , Woodfull made it back @-@ to @-@ back Test centuries in the fourth Test at Old Trafford with 117 , the highest score of the innings . It was another rain @-@ affected draw in a wet summer , Woodfull followed this with 156 in another weather @-@ curtailed match against Surrey . 
 The first four Tests were drawn , so the fate of the Ashes depended on the fifth Test , which would be timeless . Woodfull could manage only 35 and a duck as Australia lost the Test by 289 runs and thus the Ashes . His 306 runs at 51 @.@ 00 in the Tests placed him third behind Bardsley and Macartney . In the closing stages of the tour , Woodfull compiled his eighth and final century of the campaign , an unbeaten 116 against an England XI in a drawn match . 
 Upon his return to Australia , he established his partnership with Bill Ponsford , and in the 1926 – 27 Shield season , they put on a 375 @-@ run opening stand in less than four hours , which laid the foundation for the world record first @-@ class score of 1107 against New South Wales . The stand eclipsed the Sheffield shield record of 298 for the first wicket by Victor Trumper and Reg Duff in 1902 – 03 . Woodfull made 133 and the Victorians won by an innings and 656 runs . He ended the season by scoring 140 and 29 not out as the Australian XI defeated The Rest by seven wickets . He scored two further fifties and ended the season with 483 runs at 69 @.@ 00 in five matches . He then toured Malaya and Singapore with Bert Oldfield 's team during the off @-@ season , scoring three centuries ; none of the matches were first @-@ class . 
 In 1927 – 28 Australian season , Woodfull played in five matches and was highly productive in the last three . He scored 99 and 191 not out in a victory over New South Wales , before adding 106 in an innings triumph over South Australia . He rounded off the season with 94 and 81 not out in a draw in the return match against New South Wales . He ended the Australian campaign with 645 runs at 129 @.@ 00 . With Ponsford amassing 1217 runs at 152 @.@ 12 , Victoria usually got off to a strong start with the bat , and won the Shield easily . 
 Woodfull recorded his career best score of 284 , compiled in five and a half hours of batting , during a brief tour to New Zealand as part of an Australian XI at the end of the season . He added 184 for the first wicket with Ponsford and 218 for the fourth with Karl Schneider . He scored centuries in the first two matches before adding fifties in the next two . He ended the first @-@ class matches with 781 runs at 130 @.@ 16 . 
 Woodfull was appointed as vice @-@ captain to Jack Ryder for the 1928 – 29 home Ashes series . The Australian board had spent a great deal of time arguing over whether Woodfull or Victor Richardson should be Ryder 's deputy , before realising that he selectors had omitted the latter . With six members of the team that played in the last Test in 1926 having retired , Australia would field and young and inexperienced team . Woodfull prepared for the Tests with an unbeaten 67 for Victoria in a drawn tour match against Percy Chapman 's touring Englishmen . 
 Woodfull played his first Test on Australian soil in the first Test at Brisbane . He made a duck in the first innings as Australia fell for 122 to concede a 411 @-@ run first innings <unk> before Australia were forced to chase 742 for victory . Woodfull carried his bat to make an unbeaten 30 as Australia were skittled for 66 on a sticky wicket in Brisbane in the first Test to lose by a record 675 runs . Woodfull then made 68 to top @-@ score in the first innings of the second Test in Sydney . Australia conceded another mammoth first innings lead , 383 . Woodfull then scored his first Test century in Australia , with 111 in the second innings to force the tourists to bat again . Despite this , England scored 2 / 16 to win the match . 
 The third Test was Woodfull 's first at his home ground in Melbourne , and despite scoring 107 in the second innings , the tourists won by three wickets in front of Test world record crowd . Woodfull made only one and 30 as Australia fell short by 12 runs in the fourth Test in Adelaide , but ended the season on a high . 
 In a tour match against the Englishmen , Woodfull made 275 not out for Victoria , his highest score for his state . During the match , Woodfull was captain and had agreed with English captain Chapman to vary rules that had been laid by the Australian Board of Control . The two men agreed to cover the pitch throughout the match and to bowl overs of six balls instead of eight . The Australian Board of Control reacted by reprimanding the Victorian Cricket Association . The match was a high @-@ scoring draw . 
 The teams returned to Melbourne for the fifth Test , where Woodfull scored 102 and 35 in front of his home crowd as Australia won by five wickets . It was the first time that Woodfull had played in a winning Test , after ten matches . He hit three centuries in the series , with 491 runs at 54 @.@ 56 despite which Australia lost the Ashes 4 – 1 . Woodfull ended the entire season with 854 runs at 85 @.@ 40 . 
 Woodfull started the 1929 – 30 Australian season by scoring an unbeaten 100 against the touring MCC , overseeing a successful run @-@ chase . However , his season was cut short in the third match when he suffered a broken hand after being hit by a short ball from Hugh Thurlow in a match against Queensland . Woodfull was forced to retired hurt and recovered just in time for the warm @-@ up matches against Tasmania before the national team headed to England . He had scored 231 runs at 77 @.@ 00 in five matches during the season . 
 = = Captaincy = = 
 After the heavy 4 – 1 defeat in the previous Ashes series , captain and fellow Victorian Jack Ryder was omitted altogether from the 1930 Ashes tour , and Woodfull appointed captain . Ryder was one of the three selectors and advocated his own retention , but his two colleagues had voted him off . At first , Woodfull was reluctant to accept the job , feeling that it rightfully belonged to Ryder . When he was informed that Ryder was not even touring , Woodfull only agreed after a ballot was organised . He was unanimously selected by the board . Woodfull had limited leadership experience and in his brief captaincy duties had been the first captain to declare his team 's second innings in Shield history . 
 After winning the vote , Woodfull led the youngest fifteen @-@ man squad to ever tour England , with eleven never having played on English soil . Commentators expected Australia to be easily defeated , being described as " the weakest squad ever to come to these shores " . In some quarters , the team was dubbed " Woodfull 's kindergarten " . 
 The tour started with a match against Worcestershire , with Woodfull scoring a century and Don Bradman making 236 * in 275 minutes . Woodfull 's first game in command ended with a resounding innings victory . He added 54 in a win over Essex and scored 121 a drawn match against Yorkshire , the dominant county of the era with many leading Test players . Woodfull then added consecutive fifties in draws against the MCC and Surrey . After consecutive innings wins of Oxford University and Hampshire , Woodfull completed his Test preparation by striking 216 in an innings win over Cambridge University . Heading into the Tests , Woodfull had amassed 662 runs at 66 @.@ 20 . However , concerns over the Australian bowling attack prompted Woodfull and the senior players to ask the board to send another spinner . This was refused . 
 However , Woodfull 's Test captaincy started poorly in the first Test at Trent Bridge ; he scored two and four as Australia fell to a 93 @-@ run defeat , after losing their last seven wickets for 104 . Immediately after , he scored 141 against Surrey . 
 He set the tone with an opening stand of 162 with fellow Victorian Ponsford in the second Test at Lord 's . Ponsford was dismissed immediately after the teams had an audience with King George V. Woodfull then made a 231 @-@ run stand with Bradman ( 254 ) in only two and a half hours and reached 155 . Australia put themselves in control with 6 / 729 declared . Woodfull was unbeaten on 26 in the second innings as Australia reached 72 to complete a seven @-@ wicket triumph . Woodfull then won the toss for the first time and contributed 50 to a stand of 192 with Bradman in the third Test at Headingley ( the match in which Bradman scored 309 in a day ) . Australia reached 566 but rain helped England to a draw after being forced to follow on . Woodfull scored 54 as the fourth Test was rained out before the second innings . With the series tied at 1 – 1 the fifth Test at The Oval was a timeless match . Woodfull won the toss and after England made 405 , he scored 54 as Australia amassed 695 to win by an innings and regain the Ashes 2 – 1 . During the Tests , Woodfull had contributed 345 runs at 57 @.@ 50 , second only to Bradman . In all first @-@ class matches , he compiled 1 @,@ 435 runs at 57 @.@ 36 including six centuries . Woodfull and his fellow Victorian Ponsford played a significant part by making three century opening stands — 162 at Lord 's , 159 at The Oval and 106 at Old Trafford to help Australia take the initiative in three Tests . The Times commented that " No praise is too high for Woodfull " and commended the Australian captain 's encouragement of his young team . 
 Upon returning to Australia , Woodfull was elected as Victoria 's delegate on the five @-@ man national selection panel , replacing Ryder . However , he resigned from the role before the next international series , thereby never participating in the selection of a Test team . 
 This was followed by home series against the West Indies in 1930 – 31 , the first Test tour of Australia by the Caribbean side . Ahead of the Tests , Victoria defeated the tourists by an innings and 254 , but Woodfull was unable to score any runs against his Test opponents , making a duck . 
 In the Tests , Woodfull unselfishly broke up his opening combination with Ponsford by dropping down to No. 6 to accommodate the prodigiously talented young batsman Archie Jackson . Woodfull was uncomfortable batting out of position , scoring six , 58 and 17 in the first three Tests . Woodfull batted only once in each Test , as Australia easily won the first Test by ten wickets , and the next two by an innings . Woodfull was restored to the top of the order for the fourth Test in Melbourne after Jackson 's illness became too much , forcing the young batsman to withdraw from competition . Woodfull struck 83 run out as Australia took a third consecutive innings victory . He then scored his first century for the season , making 177 and 27 not out in a state match against South Australia . 
 However , Australia 's winning run came to an end with a 30 @-@ run loss in the fifth Test , with Woodfull scoring 22 and 18 . He ended the series with a modest 204 runs at 34 @.@ 00 as Australia won 4 – 1 . He ended the summer with 477 runs at 47 @.@ 70 . 
 The following season saw a tour to Australia by the South Africans for the first time in two decades . Woodfull started the season by scoring 121 and leading his state to an 88 @-@ run win over the tourists ahead of the Tests . It was a signal of what was to follow in the Tests . He then managed only 32 and nine as Victoria narrowly lost to South Australia by 21 runs . 
 Woodfull scored 74 and 58 as Australia took innings victories in the first two Tests over the South Africans in Brisbane and Sydney . He then scored 147 to script a three @-@ wicket win over arch @-@ rivals New South Wales , after Victoria had been forced to chase 434 for victory . 
 In the third Test in Melbourne , Australia found themselves on the back foot for the first time in the series . Woodfull scored only seven in the first innings , as Australia made only 198 and South Africa took a 160 @-@ run lead . He then compiled his Test best of 161 in the second innings , adding 274 in partnership with Bradman in only three hours , to help Australia make 554 and set up a 169 @-@ run win . It was the second successive Test season in which Woodfull had saved his highest Test score of the series for his home crowd . He continued his run with 82 and 37 not out in the fourth Test , which was won by ten wickets . 
 Woodfull had an opportunity to inflict more blows on the tourists as Victoria played them for the second time ahead of the final Test . While his state was unable to force a result , Woodfull continued his strong form with 44 and 73 not out . The Australian captain finished the season with a duck from the opening ball of the fifth Test , bowled after failing to offer a shot , but Australia won by an innings an 72 runs in the equivalent of a single day 's play on a sticky wicket . 
 Woodfull opened for the entire series , and returned his best ever series figures of 421 at 70 @.@ 17 , second only to Bradman . The 5 – 0 result remains the only time that Australia has clean @-@ swept South Africa over five Tests . He ended the season with 849 runs at 65 @.@ 31 . 
 = = = Bodyline = = = 
 In 1932 – 33 , the English team led by Douglas Jardine toured Australia and won the Ashes in a very acrimonious series . It has been described as the most controversial period in Australian cricket history , and voted the most important Australian moment by a panel of Australian cricket identities . 
 England 's bodyline tactics , which involved bowling at speeds of around 150 km / h at the heads and <unk> of the Australian batsmen — including Woodfull — and employing a close leg @-@ side cordon to catch balls fended away from the upper body , caused great controversy and ill @-@ feeling among Australian players and crowds . England devised the tactics in an attempt to curb Donald Bradman , Australia 's star batsman , whose average hovered around 100 , around twice that of all other world @-@ class batsman . However , they also hoped to restrict the other batsmen , Woodfull among them , through such means . 
 During the season , Woodfull 's physical courage , stoic and dignified leadership won him many admirers . He refused to employ retaliatory tactics and did not publicly complain even though he and his men were repeatedly hit — according to Ken Piesse , 34 times in all . Once the issue was resolved , and practice stopped , Woodfull refused to discuss the matter , fearing that it would disturb the peace . 
 Woodfull started the season strongly , scoring 74 and 83 in a loss to New South Wales in the second match of the summer , but was soon confronted by Jardine 's Englishmen . He made five and 25 as England crushed Victoria by an innings . Although England did aim at the batsmen 's body , they did not enforce the second half of the Bodyline structure , by not packing the leg side . This changed in the next match , when Woodfull led an Australian XI against the tourists in Melbourne , in what was effectively a Test rehearsal . With Jardine rested from the match , his deputy Bob Wyatt used the full Bodyline tactics for the first time . The match was drawn and Woodfull struggled , making 18 and a duck . Utilising his hopping technique and attempting to play unorthodox shots resembling overhead tennis smashes , Bradman failed to make an impact , and England were buoyed ahead of the Tests . 
 Australia lost heavily by ten wickets in the first Test at Sydney , when the bodyline spearhead , Harold Larwood , took ten wickets , while Woodfull managed only seven and a duck . Before the second Test in Melbourne , Woodfull had to wait until minutes before the game before he was confirmed as captain by the selectors . This caused the toss to be delayed and fomented speculation that the Australian Board of Control were considering the possibility of removing Woodfull because of his absolute refusal to allow his bowlers to use retaliatory tactics . His deputy Victor Richardson had advocated retaliation along with several other players . Richardson recalled Woodfull 's private response : 
 There is no way I will be influenced to adopt such tactics which bring such discredit to the game . I know Tim could do it but I am not going to participate in actions that can only hurt the game . 
 Although Woodfull led Australia to a dramatic victory by 111 runs , his form was a problem as he managed only 10 and 26 ; he was also hit by the bowling . The bodyline controversy reached its peak during the second day of the third Test . An all @-@ time record Adelaide Oval crowd of 50 @,@ 962 watched Australia finish off England 's first innings for 341 . Then , Woodfull opened Australia 's batting with Jack Fingleton , who was dismissed straight away for a duck . Minutes later Larwood , bowling to a conventional field setting , struck Woodfull an agonising blow under his heart with a short , lifting delivery . As Woodfull bent down over his bat in pain for several minutes , an image that became one of the defining symbols of the series , the huge crowd began jeering , hooting and verbally abusing the English team , something that was almost unheard of for the social standards of the era . Jardine reacted by saying " Well bowled , Harold " . 
 When play resumed , England 's Gubby Allen bowled an entire over to Bradman . As Larwood prepared to bowl his next over to Woodfull , Jardine changed to the Bodyline field setting . The capacity Saturday afternoon crowd viewed this as hitting a man when he was down . Journalist @-@ cricketer Dick Whitington , wrote that Jardine 's actions were seen as " an unforgivable crime in Australian eyes and certainly no part of cricket " . Mass hooting and jeering occurred after almost every ball . Whitington noted that " [ Umpire ] Hele believes that had what followed occurred in Melbourne the crowd would have leapt the fence and <unk> the English captain ; Larwood , and possibly the entire side " . Some English players later expressed fears that a large @-@ scale riot and that the police would not be able to stop the irate home crowd , who were worried that Woodfull or Bradman could be killed , from attacking them . When Larwood immigrated to Australia two decades later , he remained fearful for his safety . 
 During the over , another rising Larwood delivery knocked the bat out of Woodfull 's hands . He battled it out for 89 minutes , collecting more bruises before Allen bowled him for 22 . Later in the day , the English team manager Pelham Warner visited the Australian dressing room to express his sympathies to Woodfull . Woodfull had remained calm in public , refusing to complain about Jardine 's tactics . Woodfull 's abrupt response was meant to be private , but it was leaked to the press and became the most famous quotation of this tumultuous period in cricket history : 
 I do not want to see you , Mr Warner . There are two teams out there . One is playing cricket and the other is not . 
 Woodfull reportedly added " This game is too good to be spoilt . It 's time some people got out of it " , hinting that he might withdraw his team from competition in protest . Australia 's Leo O 'Brien later reported that Warner was close to tears following Woodfull 's rebuke . 
 In the meantime , the second innings in Adelaide saw England set Australia a near @-@ impossible 532 for victory ; even today , the highest successful Test run chase is 418 . Australia lost its first wicket at three when Jack Fingleton was bowled by Larwood . Woodfull was joined by Bradman , who played in an unorthodox counterattacking method , before being dismissed for 66 . Woodfull continued on to score an unbeaten 73 , carrying his bat as his teammates capitulated around him . Australia was eventually all out for 193 , with Oldfield unable to bat due to his fractured skull . 
 Woodfull made scores of 67 , 19 , 14 and 67 in the final two Tests , which Australia lost by six and eight wickets respectively ; In the fifth Test in Sydney , Larwood broke a bone in his foot , but Jardine made him complete the over , even though the laws of cricket permit a captain to switch bowlers mid @-@ over in the case of injury . Larwood stood stationary at the wicket and bowled without a run @-@ up , but Woodfull refused to take advantage of the injured bowler . He blocked the five remaining deliveries back down the wicket towards Larwood and refused to take a run . 
 England reclaimed the Ashes 4 – 1 . Overall , Woodfull had scored 305 runs at a moderate 33 @.@ 89 average — it was the slowest scoring rate for his career , but significantly , he had defied the English bowling for over twenty hours in total , more than any other Australian . Amid the high drama of the season , Woodfull 's struggles spread beyond the Test arena ; he scored only 297 runs at 33 @.@ 00 in matches outside the Tests . 
 In 1933 – 34 cricket returned to normality with the departure of Jardine 's men . Woodfull scored 118 in a one @-@ off match between his XI and Richardson 's XI , which ended in a draw . He then scored 129 in the run @-@ chase as The Rest of Australia narrowly defeated New South Wales by two wickets . Woodfull scored fifties in both interstate matches against New South Wales and added consecutive centuries for the national team against Tasmania before departing for his final tour of England . He ended the season with 818 runs at 62 @.@ 92 , returning to form after the tumult of the previous summer .

 In 1934 , having been reappointed to a position on the selection panel , Woodfull led Australia back to England on a tour that had been under a cloud after the tempestuous cricket diplomacy of the previous bodyline series . After agreements were put in place so that bodyline would not be used , the tour went ahead . However , there were occasions when the Australians felt that their hosts had crossed the mark with tactics resembling bodyline . 
 Woodfull started his final English campaign slowly . In his first eight innings , he scored only 161 runs at 20 @.@ 12 with one half @-@ century . Other players sensed that Woodfull had become less cheerful following the bodyline series and he offered to drop himself following his run of poor form , but fellow selectors Bradman and Alan Kippax disagreed . In the traditional Test rehearsal against the MCC , Australia reduced the hosts to be eight down in their second innings , still in arrears when the match ended in a draw . In his final innings before the Tests , Woodfull struck form with 172 not out against Lancashire . 
 In the first Test at Trent Bridge , Woodfull struck 26 and two . Australia led by 106 on the first innings and although Woodfull was so concerned with batting England out of the match that he declared with less than five hours remaining on the final day , his men went on to win by 238 runs , albeit with only ten minutes of play remaining . England struck back in the second Test at Lord 's . Woodfull made 22 as Australia replied to England 's 440 with 284 . The hosts enforced the follow on as rain breathed life into the pitch , and Woodfull made 43 as Australia were all out for 118 in an innings defeat . 
 He then scored 73 run out , his only fifty in the Tests , as Australia made 491 and ceded a 136 @-@ run lead in the third Test at Old Trafford . However , they held on for a draw . Woodfull made a duck in the fourth Test at Headingley , but another Bradman triple century put them in control before rain shortened the match ; England still needed 155 runs to make Australia bat again with only four wickets in hand when the match ended . The draw meant that the series was at 1 – 1 heading into the final Test at The Oval , which would be timeless . 
 In the lead @-@ up to the decider , Woodfull ran into form . In consecutive innings , he scored 131 and 228 not out against Gloucestershire and Glamorgan respectively . However controversy followed in a match against Nottinghamshire . In the first innings , Woodfull scored 81 as Australia batted first and made 237 . Bill Voce , one of the bodyline practitioners of 1932 – 33 , employed it with the wicket @-@ keeper standing to the leg side and took 8 / 66 . In the second innings , Voce repeated the tactic late in the day , in fading light against Woodfull and Bill Brown . Of his 12 balls , 11 were no lower than head height . 
 Woodfull told the Nottinghamshire administrators that , if Voce 's leg side bowling was repeated , his men would leave the field and return to London . He further said that Australia would not return to the county in future . The following day , Voce was absent , ostensibly due to a leg injury . Already angered by the absence of Larwood , the Nottinghamshire faithful heckled the Australians all day . Australia had previously and privately complained that some pacemen had strayed past the agreement in the Tests . 
 When the teams took to the field for the deciding Test , Woodfull won the toss and elected to bat . He scored 49 as Australia amassed 701 in the timeless match . England replied with 321 , and Woodfull made 13 in his final Test innings . The tourists made 327 and set England a target of 708 for victory . His bowlers then dismissed the hosts for 145 to seal a decisive win by 562 runs , and the series 2 – 1 . On 22 August , for the second time in four years , Australia had won the Ashes on Woodfull 's birthday . 
 The victory made Woodfull the only captain to regain the Ashes twice . He scored 1 @,@ 268 runs at 52 @.@ 83 during the tour with three centuries . His tally of 25 Tests as captain was a world record and remained unsurpassed for a quarter of a century . 
 Woodfull performed poorly in the Tests , with 228 runs at 28 @.@ 50 , but it was sufficient for an Australian triumph as Bradman and Ponsford each averaged over 90 and Clarrie Grimmett and Bill O 'Reilly each took over 25 wickets . Woodfull was criticised by Robinson for his relatively defensive captaincy , tending to bat opponents out of the match instead of going directly for victory from the off . Woodfull relied on O 'Reilly and Grimmett , using only three specialist bowlers as he sought to reinforce the batting line @-@ up . However , he was effective in curtailing leading English batsmen Wally Hammond . When Woodfull was captaining Australia , Hammond only averaged half as much as he did when another player was captaining Australia . 
 He retired immediately after the tour and was awarded a joint testimonial with Ponsford on his return to Victoria . The match raised a total of 2 @,@ 084 pounds . In this match between Woodfull 's XI and Richardson 's XI , he scored 111 in his final innings , as his men made 316 in reply to 196 . Woodfull then took his only wicket at first @-@ class level in the second innings and his team reached the target of 280 with seven wickets in hand without him having to bat . 
 In early 1935 , Woodfull lost his position as the Victorian delegate on the national selection panel after being defeated by William Johnson in a vote . 
 = = Retirement = = 
 Outside cricket , Woodfull had a successful career as a mathematics teacher at Melbourne High School , and was headmaster for six years . He was known for his stern discipline throughout his career . One of his students was future Australian Test all rounder and Australian Cricket Hall of Fame inductee Keith Miller , whom he taught in year nine . Miller was a mediocre student , as he did little study and focused his energy on sport . This disappointed Woodfull , a disciplined man who invoked the school motto , which meant Honour the Work and exhorted his students to work hard as Australia was attempting to emerge from the depths of the Great Depression . Miller scored zero in his final exam for Woodfull 's geometry class , and was forced to repeat the year . Despite his credentials , Woodfull refused to involve himself in coaching the school 's cricket teams , feeling that it would intrude on the responsibilities of the sports teachers . Despite this , Woodfull watched the students at cricket training and quickly noticed Miller 's skills , writing in the school magazine that " Miller has Test possibilities " . Other notable students included Doug Ring , a leg spinner who was a member of Bradman 's Invincibles , left arm orthodox spinner Jack Wilson and world record breaking Olympic distance runner Ron Clarke . The school oval was later named the Miller @-@ Woodfull Oval . 
 The rejuvenated Maldon Oval in his home town was renamed the Bill Woodfull Recreation Reserve , and when the Great Southern Stand was constructed at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1992 , one of the entrances was named the Bill Woodfull Gate . 
 Woodfull married Gwen King , whom he met while singing in the choir at his father 's church in Albert Park , and they married after Woodfull 's return from the England tour in 1926 . They had three children . His two sons Jack and Bill Jr , played for Melbourne University Cricket Club and became successful dentists . 
 In November 1934 , the governor general informed him that the King had offered him a knighthood , " for services to cricket " , The citation made a veiled reference to Woodfull 's actions during the bodyline episode . Woodfull always considered his contributions to education more important than anything he ever did on the cricket field , and declined the honour . In later life he said " Had I been awarded it for being an educationalist , then I would have accepted it . But under no circumstances would I accept it for playing cricket . In 1963 , he was invested as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire ( OBE ) for services to education . In 1965 , while on holiday with his wife and daughter Jill , he collapsed and died while playing golf in Tweed Heads , New South Wales . His family remained adamant that the bruising bodyline attack had permanently damaged his health and curtailed his life . Woodfull was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2001 , one of the first 15 inductees .

 = Messier 87 = 
 Messier 87 ( also known as Virgo A or NGC <unk> , and generally abbreviated to M87 ) is a supergiant elliptical galaxy in the constellation Virgo . One of the most massive galaxies in the local universe , it is notable for its large population of globular clusters — M87 contains about 12 @,@ 000 compared to the 150 @-@ 200 orbiting the Milky Way — and its jet of energetic plasma that originates at the core and extends outward at least 1 @,@ 500 parsecs ( 4 @,@ 900 light @-@ years ) , travelling at relativistic speed . It is one of the brightest radio sources in the sky , and is a popular target for both amateur astronomy observations and professional astronomy study . 
 French astronomer Charles Messier discovered M87 in 1781 , cataloguing it as a nebulous feature while searching for objects that would confuse comet hunters . The second brightest galaxy within the northern Virgo Cluster , M87 is located about 16 @.@ 4 million parsecs ( 53 @.@ 5 million light @-@ years ) from Earth . Unlike a disk @-@ shaped spiral galaxy , M87 has no distinctive dust lanes . Instead , it has an almost featureless , ellipsoidal shape typical of most giant elliptical galaxies , diminishing in luminosity with distance from the centre . Forming around one sixth of M87 's mass , the stars in this galaxy have a nearly spherically symmetric distribution , their density decreasing with increasing distance from the core . At the core is a supermassive black hole , which forms the primary component of an active galactic nucleus . This object is a strong source of <unk> radiation , particularly radio waves . M87 's galactic envelope extends out to a radius of about 150 kiloparsecs ( 490 @,@ 000 light @-@ years ) , where it has been truncated — possibly by an encounter with another galaxy . Between the stars is a diffuse interstellar medium of gas that has been chemically enriched by elements emitted from evolved stars . 
 = = Observation history = = 
 In 1781 , French astronomer Charles Messier published a catalogue of 103 objects that had a nebulous appearance . This list was intended to identify objects that might be confused with comets . In subsequent use , each item in the catalogue was prefixed with an ' M ' . Thus , M87 was the eighty seventh member of Messier 's catalogue . During the 1880s , this nebula was included in the New General Catalogue as NGC <unk> . This compilation of nebulae and star clusters was assembled by the Danish @-@ Irish astronomer John Dreyer based primarily on the observations of English astronomer John Herschel . 
 In 1918 , American astronomer Heber Curtis of Lick Observatory observed that there was no spiral structure in M87 and he noticed a " curious straight ray ... apparently connected with the nucleus by a thin line of matter . " The ray appeared brightest at the inner end . The following year , a supernova within M87 reached a peak photographic magnitude of 21 @.@ 5 , although this event was not reported until photographic plates were examined by the Russian astronomer <unk> A. <unk> in 1922 . 
 American astronomer Edwin Hubble categorized M87 as one of the brighter globular nebulae , as it lacked any spiral structure but appeared to belong to the same family of non @-@ galactic nebulae as spiral nebulae . In 1926 he produced a new categorization of nebulae , with M87 being classified as a type of elliptical extra @-@ galactic nebula with no apparent elongation ( class E0 ) . By 1931 , Hubble had identified M87 as a member of the Virgo cluster , for which he gave a provisional estimate of 1 @.@ 8 million parsecs from Earth . At the time it was the only known example of an elliptical nebula for which individual stars could be resolved . M87 continued to be called an extragalactic nebula for many years thereafter , but by 1956 it had been identified as an E0 @-@ type galaxy . 
 In 1947 , a prominent radio source was identified overlapping the location of M87 , and this was labeled Virgo @-@ A. This source was confirmed to be M87 by 1953 , and the linear relativistic jet emerging from the core of the galaxy was suggested as the cause . This jet extended from the core at a position angle of 260 ° to an angular distance of 20 ″ with an angular width of 2 ″ . In 1969 @-@ 70 , a strong component of the radio emission was found to closely align with the optical source of the jet . 
 In April 1965 , the US Naval Research Laboratory group launched an Aerobee 150 equipped with a pair of geiger counters . This flight discovered seven candidate X @-@ ray sources , including the first extragalactic X @-@ ray source ; Virgo X @-@ 1 was designated as the first X @-@ ray source detected in Virgo . A later Aerobee rocket launched from White Sands Missile Range on July 7 , 1967 , yielded further evidence that the source Virgo X @-@ 1 was the radio galaxy M87 . Subsequent X @-@ ray observations by the <unk> 1 and Einstein Observatory showed a complex source that included the active galactic nucleus of M87 . However , there is little central concentration of the X @-@ ray emission . 
 = = Visibility = = 
 M87 is located near the high declination border of the Virgo , next to the constellation of Coma Berenices . It lies along a line between the stars Epsilon Virginis and <unk> . At an apparent magnitude of 9 @.@ 59 , this galaxy can be readily observed using a small telescope with a 6 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) aperture , extending across an angular area of 7 @.@ 2 × 6 @.@ 8 arcminutes with a bright , 45 arcsecond core . Viewing the jet is a challenge without the aid of photography . Before 1991 , Russian @-@ American astronomer Otto Struve was the only person known to have seen the jet visually , using the 254 cm ( 100 in ) Hooker telescope . In recent years , however , it has been observed in larger amateur telescopes under excellent conditions . 
 = = Properties = = 
 In the modified Hubble sequence galaxy morphological classification scheme of French astronomer Gérard de Vaucouleurs , M87 is categorized as an <unk> galaxy . The E0 designation is used for an elliptical galaxy that displays no flattening — that is , it appears spherical . A ' p ' suffix indicates a peculiar galaxy that does not fit cleanly into the classification scheme ; in this case , the peculiarity denotes the presence of the jet emerging from the core . M87 is considered a type @-@ cD galaxy , which is a supergiant D class galaxy . The latter category , first proposed by American astronomer William W. Morgan in 1958 , is a galaxy that has an elliptical @-@ like nucleus surrounded by an extensive , <unk> , diffuse envelope . 
 The distance to M87 has been estimated using several independent techniques . These include measuring the luminosity of planetary nebulae , comparison with nearby galaxies whose distance has been estimated using standard candles such as cepheid variables , the linear size distribution of globular clusters , and the tip of the red giant branch method using individually resolved red giant stars , These measurements are consistent with each other , and their weighted average yields a distance estimate of 16 @.@ 4 ± 0 @.@ 5 megaparsecs ( 53 @.@ 5 ± 1 @.@ 63 million light @-@ years ) . 
 This galaxy is one of the most massive in the local Universe . This galaxy spans a diameter of 120 @,@ 000 light years , about the same as the Milky Way . But M87 is a spheroid , not a flat spiral . So it contains close to 2 @.@ 7 trillion solar masses by some estimates . The mass of M87 within a radius of 9 – 40 kiloparsecs ( 29 – 130 thousand light @-@ years ) from the core steadily increases roughly in proportion to <unk> , where r is the radius from the core . Within a radius of 32 kiloparsecs ( 100 thousand light @-@ years ) , the mass is ( 2 @.@ 4 ± 0 @.@ 6 ) × 1012 times the mass of the Sun , which is double the mass of the Milky Way galaxy . Only a fraction of this mass is in the form of stars , as M87 has an estimated mass to luminosity ratio of 6 @.@ 3 ± 0 @.@ 8 . That is , about one part in six of the galaxy 's mass is in the form of stars that are radiating energy . The total mass of M87 may be 200 times that of the Milky Way . 
 Gas is infalling into the galaxy at the rate of two to three solar masses per year , most of which may be accreted onto the core region . The extended stellar envelope of this galaxy reaches a radius of about 150 kiloparsecs ( 490 thousand light @-@ years ) , compared to about 100 kiloparsecs ( 330 thousand light @-@ years ) for the Milky Way . Beyond that distance the outer edge of the galaxy has been truncated by some means ; possibly by an earlier encounter with another galaxy . There is some evidence of linear streams of stars to the northwest of the galaxy , which may have been created by tidal stripping of orbiting galaxies , or by small satellite galaxies falling in toward <unk> as well as a filament of hot , ionized gas in the northeastern outer part of this galaxy that has been proposed to be the remnant of a small , gas @-@ rich galaxy that was disrupted by M87 and that could be feeding its active nucleus . 
 Using the Very Large Telescope to study the motions of about 300 planetary nebulae , it has been shown that M87 has absorbed a medium @-@ sized galaxy over the last billion years . The distinctive spectral properties of the planetary nebulae allowed astronomers to discover a chevron @-@ like structure in M87 's halo which was produced by the incomplete phase @-@ space mixing of a disrupted galaxy . 
 = = Components = = 
 At the core of this galaxy is a supermassive black hole ( SMBH ) with an estimated from ( 3 @.@ 5 ± 0 @.@ 8 ) × 109 times the mass of the Sun to ( 6 @.@ 6 ± 0 @.@ 4 ) × 109 M ☉ . This is one of the highest masses known for such an object . Surrounding the black hole is a rotating disk of ionized gas that is oriented roughly perpendicular to the relativistic jet . This disk is rotating at velocities of up to roughly 1 @,@ 000 km / s , and spans a maximum diameter of 0 @.@ 12 parsecs ( 0 @.@ 39 light @-@ years ) . Gas is accreting onto the black hole at an estimated rate equal to the mass of the Sun every ten years ( about 91 earth masses per day ) . 
 Observations suggest that the black hole in M87 may be displaced from the galaxy center by a distance of about 25 parsecs ( 82 light @-@ years ) . The displacement is in the opposite direction from the one @-@ sided jet , which may indicate that the black hole has been accelerated away from the center by the jet . Another possibility is that the displacement occurred during the merger of two SMBH . However care has to be taken with these findings . The study does not include any spectroscopic discrimination between the stellar and active galactic nucleus component . It is therefore possible that the seeming position of the galaxy center with respect to the black hole is misinterpreted by an optical flare of the jet itself . In 2011 , an analysis of M87 did not find any statistically significant displacement . 
 Active elliptical galaxies of a form similar to M87 are believed to form as a result of one or more mergers between smaller galaxies . There is now little dust remaining to form the diffuse nebulae where new stars are created , so the stellar population is dominated by old , population II stars that contain relatively low abundances of elements other than hydrogen and helium . The elliptical shape of this galaxy is maintained by random orbital motions of its member stars , in contrast to the more orderly rotational motions found in a spiral galaxy such as the Milky Way . 
 The space between the stars in the M87 galaxy is filled with a diffuse interstellar medium of gas , which has been chemically enriched by the elements ejected from stars as they passed beyond the end of their main sequence lifetime . Carbon and nitrogen is being continuously supplied by intermediate mass stars as they pass through the asymptotic giant branch . The heavier elements from oxygen to iron are primarily produced by supernova explosions within the galaxy . About 60 % of the abundance of these heavy elements was produced by core @-@ collapse supernovae , while the remainder came from Type Ia supernovae . The distribution of these elements suggests that early enrichment was from core @-@ collapse supernovae . The contribution from these sources was much lower in abundance than in the Milky Way . Type Ia supernovae have provided a continuous contribution to the interstellar medium of M87 throughout the history of the galaxy . 
 Examination of M87 at far infrared wavelengths shows an excess emission at wavelengths longer than 25 μm . Normally such emission may be an indication of thermal emission by warm dust . However , in the case of M87 , the emission appears to be fully explained by synchrotron radiation from the jet . Within the galaxy , silicate grains are expected to survive for no more than 46 million years because of the X @-@ ray emission from the core . This dust may be destroyed by the hostile environment or expelled from the galaxy . The combined mass of dust in this galaxy is no more than 70 @,@ 000 times the mass of the Sun . By comparison , the Milky Way contains about a hundred million ( 108 ) solar masses worth of dust . 
 Within a 4 kpc ( 13 × 10 ^ 3 ly ) radius of the core , the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium — what astronomers term the metallicity — is about half the abundance in the Sun . Outside this radius , the abundance of metals steadily decreases with increasing distance from the core . Although this is classified as an elliptical galaxy and therefore lacks the dust lanes of a spiral galaxy , optical filaments have been observed in M87 . These filaments have an estimated mass of about 10 @,@ 000 times the mass of the Sun . Surrounding the galaxy is an extended corona with hot , low density gas . 
 M87 has an abnormally large population of globular clusters . A 2006 survey out to an angular distance of 25 ′ from its core estimates that there are 12 @,@ 000 ± 800 globular clusters in orbit around M87 , as compared to the Milky Way 's 150 – 200 . These clusters are similar in size distribution to the globular clusters of the Milky Way , with most having an effective radius between 1 and 6 parsecs . The size of the M87 clusters shows a gradual increase with distance from the galactic center . The first hypervelocity globular cluster , <unk> @-@ 1 , was discovered escaping M87 . The discovery of <unk> @-@ 1 suggests that the core of M87 holds not one but two supermassive black holes . The two supermassive black holes are the result of a long @-@ ago collision between two galaxies , which merged to form a single giant galaxy . 
 Ultra @-@ compact dwarfs resemble globular clusters but have a diameter of 10 parsecs ( 33 light @-@ years ) or more , much larger than the 3 @-@ parsec ( 10 light @-@ year ) maximum of globular clusters . Their nature is unclear as to whether they are dwarf galaxies captured by M87 or a new class of massive globular cluster . Almost a hundred have been identified from the thousands of globular clusters in M87 . 
 = = Jet = = 
 The relativistic jet of matter emerging from the core extends at least 1 @.@ 5 kiloparsecs ( 5 thousand light @-@ years ) from the nucleus of M87 and is made up of matter ejected from the galaxy by a supermassive black hole . This jet is highly collimated , appearing constrained to an angle of 60 ° within 0 @.@ 8 parsecs ( 2 @.@ 6 light @-@ years ) of the core , about 16 ° at a distance of 2 parsecs ( 6 @.@ 5 light @-@ years ) and an angle of 6 – 7 ° at a distance of 12 parsecs ( 39 light @-@ years ) . The jet 's base has the diameter of 5 @.@ 5 ± 0 @.@ 4 Schwarzschild radii . The jet is probably powered by a prograde accretion disk around a spinning supermassive black hole . It is surrounded by a lower velocity , non @-@ relativistic component . There is evidence of a counter jet , but this feature remains unseen from the Earth due to relativistic beaming . The jet is precessing , causing the outflow to form a helical pattern out to a distance of 1 @.@ 6 parsecs ( 5 @.@ 2 light @-@ years ) . <unk> of matter from the jet extend out to a distance of 77 kiloparsecs ( 250 thousand light @-@ years ) . German @-@ American astronomer Walter Baade found that the light from the jet is plane polarized , which suggested that the energy was being generated by the acceleration of electrons moving at relativistic velocities in a magnetic field . The total energy output of these electrons was estimated as 5 @.@ 1 × 1056 ergs ( or 5 @.@ 1 × 1049 joules or 3 @.@ 2 × 1068 eV ) . For comparison , the entire Milky Way galaxy output is estimated at 5 × 1036 joules per second ( watts ) . 
 In pictures taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1999 , the motion of M87 's jet was measured at four to six times the speed of light . This motion is presumably an optical illusion caused by the relativistic velocity of the jet , and not true superluminal motion . However , detection of such motion supports the theory that quasars , BL Lac objects and radio galaxies may all be the same phenomenon , known as active galaxies , viewed from different perspectives . It has been proposed M87 could actually be a BL <unk> object ( with a low @-@ luminosity nuclei compared with the brightness of its host galaxy ) seen from an unfavorable angle to appreciate the properties of that kind of galaxies . 
 Observations made by Chandra X @-@ ray Observatory indicate the presence of loops and rings in the hot X @-@ ray emitting gas that permeates the cluster and surrounds M87 . These loops and rings are generated by pressure waves . The pressure waves are caused by variations in the rate at which material is ejected from the supermassive black hole in jets . The distribution of loops suggests that minor eruptions occur every six million years . One of the rings , caused by a major eruption , is a shock wave 26 kiloparsecs ( 85 thousand light @-@ years ) in diameter around the black hole . Other features observed include narrow X @-@ ray emitting filaments up to 31 kiloparsecs ( 100 thousand light @-@ years ) long , and a large cavity in the hot gas caused by a major eruption 70 million years ago . The regular eruptions prevent a huge reservoir of gas from cooling and forming stars , implying that M87 ’ s evolution may have been seriously affected , preventing it from becoming a large spiral galaxy . The observations also imply the presence of sound waves , 56 octaves below middle C for the minor eruptions and 58 to 59 below middle C for the major eruptions . 
 M87 is a very strong source of gamma rays , which are the most energetic rays of the electromagnetic spectrum . Gamma rays coming from M87 have been observed since the late 1990s , but in 2006 , using the <unk> Cherenkov telescopes , scientists have measured the variations of the gamma ray flux coming from M87 , and found that the flux changes over a matter of days . This short period makes the immediate vicinity of the supermassive black hole in M87 the most promising source for these gamma rays . In general , the smaller the diameter of the emission source , the faster the variation in flux , and vice versa . 
 A knot of matter in the jet , designated HST @-@ 1 , has been tracked by the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X @-@ ray Observatory . This knot is about 65 parsecs ( 210 light @-@ years ) from the core . By 2006 , the X @-@ ray intensity of this knot had increased by a factor of 50 over a four @-@ year period . This X @-@ ray emission has since been decaying in a variable manner .

 This supergiant elliptical galaxy is located near the center of the Virgo Cluster . This rich cluster has about 2 @,@ 000 members and it forms the core of the larger Virgo Supercluster , of which the Local Group , and hence the Milky Way galaxy , is an outlying member . The cluster is organized into at least three distinct subsystems that are associated with the three galaxies M87 , M49 and <unk> , with the one centered around M87 known as Virgo A and the one around M49 as Virgo B. There is a preponderance of elliptical and S0 galaxies around M87 , with a chain of elliptical galaxies aligned with the jet . In terms of mass , M87 is a dominant member of the cluster , and hence appears to be moving very little relative to the cluster as a whole . Indeed , M87 is defined as the cluster center . The cluster has a sparse gaseous atmosphere that emits X @-@ rays that decrease in temperature toward the middle , where M87 is located . The combined mass of the cluster is estimated to be ( 0 @.@ 15 – 1 @.@ 5 ) × 1015 solar masses . 
 Measurements of the motion of intracluster planetary nebulae between M87 and <unk> suggest that these two galaxies are moving toward each other and this may be their first encounter . M87 may have encountered <unk> in the past , as evidenced by the truncation of the outer halo of the former from tidal effects . However , another possible cause of this truncation is a contraction due to an unseen mass falling into M87 from the rest of the cluster , which , in particular , may be the hypothesized dark matter . A third possibility is that the halo formation was truncated as a result of early feedback from the active galactic nucleus at the core of M87 .

 " Terms of Endearment " is the seventh episode of the sixth season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files , and originally aired on the Fox network on January 3 , 1999 . Written by David Amann and directed by Rob Bowman , " Terms of Endearment " is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . It earned a Nielsen rating of 10 @.@ 5 and was watched by 18 @.@ 7 million people on its initial broadcast . The performance given by guest actor Bruce Campbell attracted positive comments , but the plot was criticized . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . In the installment , an unborn child is apparently abducted from its mother 's womb by a demon after the prospective parents discover that their child has birth defects . After Agent Spender dismisses the assignment as irrelevant to the X @-@ Files , Mulder and Scully steal the case and investigate the creature . While looking into the report , the duo discover that Wayne Weinsider ( Campbell ) is a child @-@ abducting demon . 
 " Terms of Endearment " , an inversion of the 1968 film Rosemary 's Baby , was the first episode written by The X @-@ Files ' executive story editor David Amann , a staff member who later became a regular contributor to the series . Campbell , already well known as a cult film actor in several Sam Raimi horror movies , was cast as Wayne Weinsider . Many of the episode 's special effects were created without elaborate computer @-@ generated effects . Critics have complimented the episode 's unique representation of its antagonist , who has been classified as a sympathetic villain . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In Roanoke , Virginia , Wayne Weinsider ( Bruce Campbell ) and his pregnant wife Laura ( Lisa Jane Persky ) learn via an ultrasound scan that their unborn child has bizarre physical abnormalities , such as horn @-@ like protrusions . Weinsider appears to be especially distraught after hearing the news . That night , Laura has a terrifying dream in which a demon @-@ like figure snatches the baby from her womb . When she wakes up , the couple discover that Laura has seemingly miscarried . Laura 's brother , local deputy sheriff Arky Stevens , reports her story to the X @-@ Files section at the FBI . Agent Jeffrey Spender ( Chris Owens ) discards the report , but Agent Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) salvages the case and travels to Virginia , along with Agent Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) to interview the <unk> . 
 The police , who suspect an illegal abortion , find the remains of the baby in the garden furnace . Wayne quickly confesses to destroying the evidence . He asserts that his wife had aborted the child while in a trance @-@ like state and attempts to convince her of this . Laura takes the blame for the abortion and goes to jail . While visiting Laura in her cell , Wayne attempts to steal her soul , but the EMT is able to save her life , much to Wayne 's surprise . Meanwhile Wayne has another wife , Betsy Monroe , who is also pregnant . 
 Mulder , determining that Wayne is a Czech immigrant by the name of Ivan Veles , reaches the conclusion that Wayne is a demon who is trying to have a normal baby , and suspects that he terminates pregnancies when the fetus exhibits demon @-@ like traits . Betsy has a dream similar to Laura 's , but recognizes the dream @-@ demon as her husband . Nevertheless , she loses her baby and tracks down Mulder and Scully . The two seek out Weinsider and catch him digging in Betsy 's backyard . After a short conversation , the sheriff arrives at the house and shoots Weinsider . He is taken to hospital and placed in a bed next to Laura . A mist passes from Weinsider 's body into Laura 's , at which point Weinsider dies and Laura recovers . 
 Mulder and Scully discover remains of normal human babies in Betsy 's yard where Weinsider was digging . When seeing the evidence , Mulder deduces that Betsy is another demon who is unable to have a baby demon unless another demon impregnates her . Unlike Weinsider , she has been terminating pregnancies that resulted in non @-@ demonic fetuses : the very type Weinsider has been so desperate to father . As a demon , she could recognize her husband as a demon in her dream and stop him extracting her baby . However , it becomes apparent that she never lost her baby ; it was merely a trick to frame her demon husband . At the end of the narrative , Betsy Monroe drives away with her new demon baby . Her eyes flash with a red gleam before returning to normal .

 " Terms of Endearment " was the first episode written by The X @-@ Files executive story editor David Amann . Amann had previously written two network movies titled The Man Who Wouldn 't Die and Dead Air and had served two years on the staff of the CBS medical drama Chicago Hope . The concept for " Terms of Endearment " was " about the fifth or sixth idea " Amann came up with for the show . Amann 's original idea was to write what he described as " Rosemary 's Baby in reverse " . He explained , " I had this idea [ for doing the episode ] not from the point of view of the hapless woman unwittingly impregnated , but from the point of view of the devil " . Amann pitched his idea to series creator Chris Carter , who gave him the commission to write the rest of the episode . 
 According to Amann , the initial draft was " heavier on pure shock value and lighter on humor and human interest " . In this version , Laura Weinsider gave birth to a serpent rather than a demon baby . In addition , the story unraveled in a more " linear " fashion . This draft also called for the devil to seek a human baby , resulting in the sacrifice of his wife . The series regular writers felt that this initial version of the story had a certain " inevitability " to it . Carter suggested that the second woman should be a demon . Amann later admitted that this addition made the story " work well " . Kerry Fall from DVD Journal suggested that the plot revolved around " the wives and lives of a demon trying to have a normal child . " 
 The score for " Terms of Endearment " was composed by series regular Mark Snow , who used Gregorian chants to give the atmosphere a " creepy " feel . The 1995 song " Only Happy When It Rains " by alternative rock group Garbage plays several times in the episode , most notably when Betsy Monroe drives away with her demon baby . The quote " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> " — what Laura Weinsider was to have said while " in a trance " — is what the occultist Aleister Crowley used to open the 10th <unk> of the Thelemic demon Choronzon . " Terms of Endearment " is not the first occasion that the series drew influence from Crowley ; a high school from the episode " Die Hand Die Verletzt " was named after him as well . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Rick Millikan selected Lisa Jane Persky , who was at the top of his casting " wish list " , for the role of Laura . In the middle of filming , a cast member withdrew from the production for religious reasons . A mother withdrew her baby from the cast during the final run @-@ through of the " cursed @-@ birth " scene . Although a fan of the show , as a devout Catholic she was uncomfortable with her child representing a demon . Director Rob Bowman assured her that the production staff understood her dilemma ; the casting staff called down and found a replacement in less than 45 minutes . It was the first time during the filming of the series that a cast @-@ member withdrew for religious reasons . 
 Bruce Campbell , known for taking leading roles in Sam Raimi horror movies such as The Evil Dead trilogy , was cast as the episode 's antagonist Wayne Weinsider . Campbell had previously worked for the Fox network on his short lived series The Adventures of Brisco County , Jr . , which began as the lead @-@ in show for The X @-@ Files during the first season . Fox had initially assumed that Brisco County , Jr. was going to be the more successful series , while The X @-@ Files was more <unk> referred to as " the other drama Fox ordered that spring " . Several of the individuals who worked on the failed Brisco County , Jr. series later found a career working on The X @-@ Files , which led Campbell to call the process a " coming home " experience . 
 Campbell first met both Duchovny and Anderson during the promotional campaigns for both series in 1993 . He commented that , although Duchovny was known for playing a serious role on the show , in real life he was quite a funny person . During shooting , Campbell and Duchovny entertained themselves on set by pranking the crew members , eventually stopping it when crew members became upset . Although Campbell had a positive opinion of working on the show , he commented that the nature of the show did not allow for much improvisation , describing the production as a " well oiled machine " . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 The first five seasons of the series were mainly filmed in Vancouver , British Columbia , and production of the show 's sixth season was based in Los Angeles , California . The principal outdoor filming for " Terms of Endearment " took place in and around Pasadena , called " the most East Coast @-@ like part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area " by Andy Meisler in his book The End and the Beginning . The car featured in the episode was a Chevrolet Camaro Z28 convertible . Meisler sardonically wrote that General Motors had " no qualms about seeing their vehicles driven onscreen by a relative of Satan " . 
 Several of the special effects used in the episode were created in a " low @-@ stress " manner that did not rely wholly on Computer @-@ generated imagery . During the childbirth scene , gas @-@ burners were set a distance away from a fire @-@ proof bed . The scene was then filmed with a long lens to give the effect that the fire was mere inches away from the bed . Producer John Shiban said that the film crew made " a big deal out of the eyes " to make the scene frightening . The devil sonogram was created by using the videotape of a real sonogram of a crew member 's wife . The videotape was then edited to give it a demonic look . 
 The burnt baby skeleton was built from scratch . Originally , the crew had planned on renting a real fetal skeleton , but the $ 3 @,@ 000 cost forced them to make their own . Office manager Donovan Brown noted that , " we got two or three of those adults skeleton models , cut a foot or so off a leg here and shortened an arm there , glued them together to a plaster model of a fetal skull we found , and put together something that worked wonderfully " . 
 = = Themes = = 
 A main theme in the episode is the horror of child birth . Amann describes the episode as an inversion of the 1968 horror film Rosemary 's Baby which is about a woman scared of giving birth to a demonic baby . As with many other episodes of the series , " Terms of Endearment " is heavily influenced by horror films , and features gothic imagery . In addition to Rosemary 's Baby and other Roman Polanski films , the episode shows stylistic references to the 1972 film The Exorcist and the 1981 film The Evil Dead . The influence of the genre extends to the casting of Campbell , an actor unfamiliar to the mainstream public but with a prominent cult following among horror fans . 
 The main antagonist of " Terms of Endearment " , Weinsider , is a child @-@ murdering demon . However , the episode plays against genre archetypes by turning Weinsider into a sympathetic villain . Critics have pointed out that the character 's presentation was not entirely negative . Some have commented that Campbell humanized the character , portraying him in a manner that adds likability to a character who could have been more sinister . By the time Weinsider is defeated , the audience is led to partially identify with him . He ultimately sacrifices himself to save the life of his wife , showcasing heroic qualities and subverting the way that villains are often portrayed in the genre .

 " Terms of Endearment " originally aired on the Fox network on January 3 , 1999 , with a tagline of " Born to raise hell . Tonight , something terrifying is about to be born " .

 Upon its first broadcast , the episode received mixed reviews from critics . Michael Liedtke and George Avalos , in a review of the sixth season in The Charlotte Observer , called the episode " just plain bad . " Sarah Stegall awarded the episode two stars out of five , positively comparing it to the work of Roman Polanski , but criticizing its failure to deliver truly scary material . Stegall mused that " Terms of Endearment " lacked the edgy writing of some of the best episodes of the series , though she did note that Campbell " turns in a good performance with mediocre material " . She also criticized the depiction of religious material , comparing it negatively to other episodes with religious themes including " Revelations " and " Miracle Men " . 
 Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four , calling it a disappointment . Vitaris heavily criticized Mulder 's line : " I 'm not a psychologist " — reportedly an ad lib from Duchovny himself — noting that it undermines established continuity within the series including the character 's background in psychology . Tom Kessenich , in his 2002 book Examination : An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6 – 9 of the X @-@ Files , praises the installment , saying , " Place a devil in the plot and I 'll follow you to see what you can cook up . ... I enjoyed this tale of a devil looking to be just a normal dad immensely . " In his view the episode showed a return to the earlier horror @-@ based narratives the series was known for ; though he praises the casting of Campbell , he writes that moments between Mulder and Scully are lacking .

 In the years following " Terms of Endearment " ' s original broadcast , critical reception improved . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , gave three stars out of five , describing it as " a very brave story " . Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode suffered from its attempt to balance comedy and horror , " not having enough comedy to explore the premise properly , and not enough suspense to provide much drama " . However , both Persky and Campbell were praised for their acting , despite the perceived shallowness of the latter 's character . David Wharton of Cinema Blend called Campbell 's performance " <unk> " and subtle , commenting that he portrayed Weinsider " a bit less madcap than many of the roles that he 's known for " . Wharton praised the casting , describing it as " against type " , which he claimed worked well because the material of the episode was more serious and dramatic than usual for the series . 
 Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review and awarded it a " B " . He praised Campbell 's acting , calling him " the best thing about " the installment , and complimented the entry 's general concept . VanDerWerff stated that after several humorous stories in a row , " Terms of Endearment " was a " return to form " for the series , bringing the season back to the more straightforward monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week format . VanDerWerff did , however , note that the episode 's biggest weaknesses were its limited use of Scully and its over @-@ the @-@ top use of Spender as a villain . Another critic from The A.V. Club , Zack Handlen , commented that " Terms of Endearment " was notably more influenced by horror than the following week 's " The Rain King " . Edward Olivier of The Celebrity Cafe stated that the installment strayed away from regular X @-@ Files formula , showcasing Campbell in a " major role " . 
 Retrospective reviews of " Terms of Endearment " with regards to the series as a whole were mixed . In a run @-@ down of The X @-@ Files guest stars who left a lasting impression , Lana Berkowitz from the Houston Chronicle included Campbell , calling him the " demon who wants to be a father . " Christine Seghers of IGN described the entry as a " creepy standout " from the sixth season , and named Campbell 's guest appearance as the sixth best of the series . Campbell 's performance was called " moving " by Seghers , who viewed that Campbell managed to deliver a performance that " completely shed his trademark snark " . Cinefantastique later named the dream sequence from " Terms of Endearment " as the ninth scariest moment in The X @-@ Files . Andrew Payne from Starpulse cited the episode as the second most disappointing of the series , calling the premise " lame " . Payne stated that only " Chinga " , an episode written by author Stephen King , wasted its potential more .

 Following his involvement with this episode , Campbell was considered as a possible contender for the role of John Doggett , a character that would appear in the eighth season . Over a hundred actors auditioned for the role . Due to a contractual obligation , Campbell could not take any work during the filming of his series Jack of All Trades . On potentially being cast as the series regular , Campbell mused , " I had worked on an X @-@ Files episode before , and I think they sort of remembered me from that . It was nice to be involved in that – even if you don 't get it , it 's nice to hang out at that party . " The character was eventually portrayed by actor Robert Patrick . Later in Campbell 's novel Make Love ! The Bruce Campbell Way , he joked that Patrick " stiffed him out of the role " . 
 " Terms of Endearment " was the first entry of the series written by Amann , who beforehand had unsuccessfully pitched several ideas for the show . Based on the success of this episode , Amann went on to write several more episodes for the series , such as " Agua Mala " later in the same season . During the ninth season , Amann became one of the main supervising producers and had writing involvement in several episodes , most notably " Release " and " Hellbound " . 
 Chris Owens , who portrayed Jeffrey Spender on the show , was negatively affected by the episode . Following the premiere of " Terms of Endearment " , he received " strange reactions " from people on the street who were displeased with his character . In the series , the character staunchly disbelieves in the paranormal , and tries to remove the initial report about child @-@ abducting demons in the episode , only for it to be salvaged by Mulder and Scully . People were so annoyed by the nature of the character that Owens was pestered during his everyday life ; during one incident , a person angrily called him a " paper shredder " .
