 The other victims of the crash were four members of the Bar @-@ Kays — guitarist Jimmy King , tenor saxophonist Phalon Jones , organist Ronnie Caldwell and drummer Carl Cunningham ; their valet , Matthew Kelly ; and the pilot , Richard Fraser . 
 Redding 's body was recovered the next day when the lake was searched . The family postponed the funeral from December 15 to December 18 so that more could attend . The service took place at the City Auditorium in Macon . More than 4 @,@ 500 people came to the funeral , overflowing the 3 @,@ 000 @-@ seat hall , although many did not know who he was . Johnny Jenkins and Isaac Hayes did not attend , fearing their reaction would be worse than Zelma Redding 's . Redding was entombed at his ranch in Round Oak , about 20 miles ( 32 km ) north of Macon . Jerry Wexler delivered the eulogy . Redding died just three days after recording " The Dock of the Bay " . He was survived by Zelma and three children , Otis III , Dexter and Karla . Otis , Dexter and cousin Mark Lockett later founded the <unk> , a band managed by Zelma . She also maintained or worked at the janitorial service Maids Over Macon , several nightclubs and booking agencies . On November 8 , 1997 , a memorial plaque was placed on the lakeside deck of the Madison convention center , <unk> Terrace .

 " ( Sittin ' on ) The Dock of the Bay " was released in January 1968 . It became Redding 's only single to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and the first posthumous number @-@ one single in U.S. chart history . It sold approximately four million copies worldwide and received more than eight million airplays . The album The Dock of the Bay was the first posthumous album to reach the top spot on the UK Albums Chart . 
 Shortly after Redding 's death , Atlantic Records , distributor of the Stax / Volt releases , was purchased by Warner Bros. Stax was required to renegotiate its distribution deal and was surprised to learn that Atlantic actually owned the entire Stax / Volt catalog . Stax was unable to regain the rights to its recordings and severed its Atlantic relationship . Atlantic also held the rights to all unreleased Otis Redding masters . It had enough material for three studio albums — The Immortal Otis Redding ( 1968 ) , Love Man ( 1969 ) , and Tell the Truth ( 1970 ) — all issued on its Atco Records label . A number of successful singles emerged from these LPs , among them " Amen " ( 1968 ) , " Hard to Handle " ( 1968 ) , " I 've Got Dreams to Remember " ( 1968 ) , " Love Man " ( 1969 ) , and " Look at That Girl " ( 1969 ) . Singles were also lifted from two live Atlantic @-@ issued Redding albums , In Person at the Whisky a Go Go , recorded in 1966 and issued in 1968 on Atco , and Monterey International Pop Festival , a Reprise Records release featuring some of the live performances at the festival by the Jimi Hendrix Experience on side one and Redding on side two . 
 In September 2007 , the first official DVD anthology of Redding 's live performances was released by Concord Music Group , then owners of the Stax catalog . Dreams to Remember : The Legacy of Otis Redding featured 16 full @-@ length performances and 40 minutes of new interviews documenting his life and career . On May 18 , 2010 , Stax Records released a two @-@ disc recording of three complete sets from his Whisky a Go Go date in April 1966 . 
 Carla Thomas claimed that the pair had planned to record another duet album in December the same year , but Phil Walden denied this . Redding had proposed to record an album featuring cut and rearranged songs in different tempos ; for example , ballads would be uptempo and vice versa . Another suggestion was to record an album entirely consisting of country standards . 
 = = Personal life and wealth = = 
 Redding , who was 6 feet 1 inch ( 1 @.@ 85 m ) tall and weighed 220 pounds ( 100 kg ) , was an athletic family man who loved football and hunting . He was described as vigorous , trustworthy , full of fun and a successful businessman . He was active in philanthropic projects . His keen interest in black youth led to plans for a summer camp for disadvantaged children . 
 Redding 's music made him wealthy . According to several advertisements , he had around 200 suits and 400 pairs of shoes , and he earned about $ 35 @,@ 000 per week for his concerts . He spent about $ 125 @,@ 000 in the " Big O Ranch " . As the owner of Otis Redding Enterprises , his performances , music publishing ventures and royalties from record sales earned him more than a million dollars in 1967 alone . That year , one columnist said , " he sold more records than Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin combined . " After the release of Otis Blue , Redding became a " catalogue " artist , meaning his albums were not immediate blockbusters , but rather sold steadily over time .

 = = = Style = = = 
 Early on Redding copied the rock and soul style of his role model Little Richard . He was also influenced by soul musicians such as Sam Cooke , whose live album Sam Cooke at the Copa was a strong influence , but later explored other popular genres . He studied the recordings of the Beatles and Bob Dylan . His song " Hard to Handle " has elements of rock and roll and influences of Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix . Most of his songs were categorized as Southern soul and Memphis soul . 
 His hallmark was his raw voice and ability to convey strong emotion . Richie Unterberger of Allmusic noted his " hoarse , gritty vocals , brassy arrangements , an emotional way with both party tunes and aching ballads . " In the book Rock and Roll : An Introduction , authors Michael Campbell and James Brody suggested that " Redding 's singing calls to mind a fervent black preacher . Especially in up @-@ tempo numbers , his singing is more than impassioned speech but less than singing with precise pitch . " According to the book , " Redding finds a rough midpoint between impassioned oratory and conventional singing . His delivery overflows with emotion " in his song " I Can 't Turn You Loose " . Booker T. Jones described Redding 's singing as energetic and emotional , but said that his vocal range was limited , reaching neither low nor high notes . Peter Buckley , in The Rough Guide to Rock , describes his " gruff voice , which combined Sam Cooke 's phrasing with a <unk> delivery " and later suggested he " could testify like a hell @-@ bent preacher , croon like a tender lover or get down and dirty with a bluesy yawp " . 
 Redding received advice from Rufus Thomas about his clumsy stage appearance . Jerry Wexler said Redding " didn 't know how to move " , and stood still , moving only his upper body , although he acknowledged that Redding was well received by audiences for his strong message . Guralnick described Redding 's painful vulnerability in Sweet Soul Music , as an attractive one for the audience , but not for his friends and partners . His early shyness was well known . 
 = = = Songwriting = = = 
 In his early career Redding mostly covered songs from popular artists , such as Richard , Cooke and Solomon Burke . Around the mid @-@ 1960s he began writing his own songs — always taking along his cheap red acoustic guitar — and sometimes asked for Stax members ' opinion of his lyrics . He often worked on lyrics with other musicians , such as Simms , Rodgers , Huckaby , Phil Walden and Cropper . During his recovery from his throat operation , Redding wrote about 30 songs in two weeks . Redding was the sole copyright holder on all of his songs . 
 In " ( Sittin ' on ) The Dock of the Bay " he abandoned familiar romantic themes for " sad , wistful <unk> , amplified by unforgettable descending guitar riffs by Cropper " . The website of the Songwriters Hall of Fame noted that the song " was a kind of brooding , dark voicing of despair , ( ' I 've got nothin ' to live for / Look like nothin ' gonna come my way ' ) " although " his music , in general , was exultant and joyful . " According to journalist Ruth Robinson , author of the liner notes for the 1993 box set , " It is currently a revisionist theory to equate soul with the darker side of man 's musical expression , blues . That <unk> of the flame of ' Trouble 's got a hold on me ' music , might well be the father of the form if it is , the glorified exaltation found in church on any Sunday morning is its mother . " The Songwriters Hall of Fame website adds that " glorified exaltation indeed was an apt description of Otis Redding 's songwriting and singing style . " Booker T. Jones compared Redding with Leonard Bernstein , stating , " He was the same type person . He was a leader . He 'd just lead with his arms and his body and his fingers . " 
 Redding favored short and simple lyrics ; when asked whether he intended to cover Dylan 's " Just Like a Woman " , he responded that the lyrics contained " too much text " . Furthermore , he stated in an interview , 
 Basically , I like any music that remains simple and I feel this is the formula that makes " soul music " successful . When any music form becomes cluttered and / or complicated you lose the average listener 's ear . There is nothing more beautiful than a simple blues tune . There is beauty in simplicity whether you are talking about architecture , art or music . 
 Redding also authored his ( sometimes difficult ) recordings ' horn arrangements , humming to show the players what he had in mind . The recording of " Fa @-@ Fa @-@ Fa @-@ Fa @-@ Fa ( Sad Song ) " captures his habit of humming with the horn section . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Redding has been called the " King of Soul " , an honorific also given to Brown and Cooke . He remains one of the genre 's most recognized artists . His lean and powerful style exemplified the Stax sound ; he was said to be " the heart and soul of Stax " , while artists such as Al Jackson , Dunn and Cropper helped to expand its structure . His open @-@ throated singing , the tremolo / vibrato , the manic , electrifying stage performances and perceived honesty were particular hallmarks , along with the use of interjections ( such as " gotta , gotta , gotta " ) , some of which came from Cooke . Producer Stewart thought the " begging singing " was stress @-@ induced and enhanced by Redding 's shyness . 
 Artists from many genres have named Redding as a musical influence . George Harrison called " Respect " an inspiration for " Drive My Car " . The Rolling Stones also mentioned Redding as a major influence . Other artists influenced by Redding include Led Zeppelin , Grateful Dead , Lynyrd Skynyrd , the Doors , and virtually every soul and R & B musician from the early years , such as Al Green , Etta James , William Bell , Aretha Franklin , Marvin Gaye and Conley . Musicians have covered or mixed his songs , notably Kanye West and Jay @-@ Z in their Grammy Award – winning song " Otis " . Janis Joplin was influenced by his singing style , according to Sam Andrew , a guitarist in her band Big Brother and the Holding Company . She stated that she learned " to push a song instead of just sliding over it " after hearing Redding .

 The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted Redding in 1989 , declaring his name to be " synonymous with the term soul , music that arose out of the black experience in America through the transmutation of gospel and rhythm and blues into a form of funky , secular testifying . " Readers of the British music newspaper Melody Maker voted him the top vocalist of 1967 , superseding Elvis Presley , who had topped the list for the prior 10 years . In 1988 , he was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame . Five years later , the United States Post Office issued a 29 @-@ cent commemorative postage stamp in his honor . Redding was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1994 , and in 1999 he received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award . The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included three Redding recordings , " Shake " , " ( Sittin ' on ) The Dock of the Bay " , and " Try a Little Tenderness , " on its list of " The 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll . " American music magazine Rolling Stone ranked Redding at number 21 on their list of the " 100 Greatest Artists of All Time " and eighth on their list of the " 100 Greatest Singers of All Time " . Q ranked Redding fourth among " 100 Greatest Singers " , after only Frank Sinatra , Franklin and Presley . 
 Five of his albums , Otis Blue : Otis Redding Sings Soul , Dreams to Remember : The Otis Redding Anthology , The Dock of the Bay , Complete & Unbelievable : The Otis Redding Dictionary of Soul and Live in Europe , were ranked by Rolling Stone on their list of the " 500 Greatest Albums of All Time " . The first album was singled out for praise by music critics ; apart from the Rolling Stone listing at number 74 , NME ranked it 35 on their list of the " Greatest Albums of All Time " . Music critic Robert Christgau said that Otis Blue was " the first great album by one of soul 's few reliable long @-@ form artists " , and that Redding 's " original LPs were among the most intelligently conceived black albums of the ' 60s " . 
 In 2002 , the city of Macon honored its native son by unveiling a memorial statue ( 32 ° 50 ′ 19 @.@ 05 ″ N 83 ° 37 ′ 17 @.@ 30 ″ W ) in the city 's Gateway Park . The park is next to the Otis Redding Memorial Bridge , which crosses the Ocmulgee River . The Otis Redding Memorial Library is also housed in the city . The Rhythm and Blues Foundation named Redding as the recipient of its 2006 Pioneer Award . Billboard awarded Redding the " Otis Redding Excellence Award " the same year . A year later he was inducted into the Hollywood 's <unk> in California . On August 17 , 2013 , in Cleveland , Ohio , the city where he did his last show at Leo 's Casino , Redding was inducted into the inaugural class of the Official Rhythm & Blues Music Hall of Fame at Cleveland State University .

 Halo 2 is a 2004 first @-@ person shooter video game developed by Bungie Studios . Released for the Xbox video game console on November 9 , 2004 , the game is the second installment in the Halo franchise and the sequel to 2001 's critically acclaimed Halo : Combat Evolved . A Microsoft Windows version of the game was released on May 31 , 2007 , developed by an internal team at Microsoft Game Studios known as Hired Gun . The game features a new game engine , as well as using the Havok physics engine ; added weapons and vehicles , and new multiplayer maps . The player alternately assumes the roles of the human Master Chief and the alien Arbiter in a 26th @-@ century conflict between the human United Nations Space Command and genocidal Covenant . 
 After the success of Combat Evolved , a sequel was expected and highly anticipated . Bungie found inspiration in plot points and gameplay elements that had been left out of their first game , including multiplayer over the Internet through Xbox Live . Time constraints forced a series of cutbacks in the size and scope of the game , including a cliffhanger ending to the game 's campaign mode that left many in the studio dissatisfied . Among Halo 2 's marketing efforts was an alternate reality game called " I Love Bees " that involved players solving real @-@ world puzzles . 
 On release , Halo 2 was the most popular video game on Xbox Live , holding that rank until the release of Gears of War for the Xbox 360 nearly two years later . By June 20 , 2006 , more than 500 million games of Halo 2 had been played and more than 710 million hours have been spent playing it on Xbox Live ; by May 9 , 2007 , the number of unique players had risen to over five million . Halo 2 is the best @-@ selling first @-@ generation Xbox game with at least 6 @.@ 3 million copies sold in the United States alone . The game received critical acclaim , with most publications lauding the strong multiplayer component . The campaign however , was the focus of criticism for its cliffhanger ending . 
 A high @-@ definition remake of Halo 2 was released as part of Halo : The Master Chief Collection on November 11 , 2014 , for the Xbox One . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Halo 2 is a shooter game , with players predominantly experiencing gameplay from a first @-@ person perspective . Players use a combination of human and alien weaponry and vehicles to progress through the game 's levels . The player 's health bar is not visible , but players are instead equipped with a damage @-@ absorbing shield that regenerates when not taking fire . 
 Certain weapons can be dual @-@ wielded , allowing the player to trade accuracy , the use of grenades and melee attacks for raw firepower . The player can carry two weapons at a time ( or three if dual @-@ wielding ; one weapon remains holstered ) , with each weapon having advantages and disadvantages in different combat situations . For example , most Covenant weapons eschew disposable ammo clips for a contained battery , which cannot be replaced if depleted . However , these weapons can overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods . Human weapons are less effective at penetrating shields and require reloading , but cannot overheat due to prolonged fire . The player can carry a total of eight grenades ( four human grenades , four Covenant ) to dislodge and disrupt enemies . New in Halo 2 is the ability to board enemy vehicles that are near the player and traveling at low speeds . The player or AI latches onto the vehicle and forcibly ejects the other driver from the vehicle . 
 = = = Campaign = = = 
 The game 's " Campaign " mode offers options for both single @-@ player and cooperative multiplayer participation . In campaign mode , the player must complete a series of levels that encompass Halo 2 's storyline . These levels alternate between the Master Chief and a Covenant Elite called the Arbiter , who occupy diametrically opposed roles in the story 's conflict . Aside from variations in storyline , the Arbiter differs from Master Chief only in that his armor lacks a flashlight ; instead , it is equipped with a short duration rechargeable form of active camouflage that disappears when the player attacks or takes damage . 
 There are four levels of difficulty in campaign mode : Easy , Normal , Heroic , and Legendary . An increase in difficulty will result in an increase in the number , rank , health , damage , and accuracy of enemies ; a reduction of duration and an increase in recharge time for the Arbiter 's active camouflage ; a decrease in the player 's health and shields ; and occasional changes in dialog . 
 There is hidden content within the game , including Easter eggs , messages , hidden objects , and weapons . The most well known of the hidden content are the skulls hidden on every level . The skulls , which can be picked up like a weapon , are located in hard @-@ to @-@ reach places . Many are exclusive to the Legendary mode of difficulty . Once activated , each skull has a specific effect on gameplay . For example , the " Sputnik " skull found on the Quarantine Zone level alters the mass of objects in the game ; thus resulting in explosions being able to launch these objects across larger distances . Skull effects can be combined to provide various new levels of difficulty and / or novelty . 
 = = = Multiplayer = = = 
 Like Halo : Combat Evolved , the Xbox version of Halo 2 features a multiplayer system that allows players to compete with each other in split @-@ screen and system link modes ; in addition , it adds support for online multiplayer via Xbox Live . 
 Halo 2 introduced an entirely new paradigm for matchmaking players together . In earlier games , one person specifies a game type and map and configures other settings , before setting up his or her device as a game server and advertising the game to the world at large . Halo 2 introduced a " playlist " system that automated this process to keep a steady flow of games available at all times , and layered a skill @-@ ranking system on top . 
 The Xbox Live multiplayer and downloadable content features of the Xbox version of Halo 2 were supported until the discontinuation of the service in April 2010 . The online multiplayer of Halo 2 for Windows Vista uses Games for Windows – Live . In January 2013 , it was reported that the PC multiplayer servers would be taken offline on February 15 , 2013 , due to inactivity . On February 12 , 2013 , it was announced that the multiplayer servers for Halo 2 on PC would remain online until June , while further support options would be investigated .

 Halo 2 takes place in the 26th century . Humans , under the auspices of the United Nations Space Command or UNSC , have developed faster @-@ than @-@ light slipspace travel and colonized numerous worlds . According to the game 's backstory , the outer colony world of Harvest was decimated by a collective of alien races known as the Covenant in 2525 . Declaring humanity an affront to their gods , the Forerunners , the Covenant begin to systemically obliterate the humans with their superior numbers and technology . After the human bastion at the planet Reach is destroyed , a single ship , The Pillar of Autumn , follows protocol and initiates a random slipspace jump to lead the Covenant away from Earth . The crew discovers a Forerunner ringworld called Halo , which the Covenant wants to activate because of their religious belief that the activation of the ring will bring about a " Great Journey , " sweeping loyal Covenant to salvation . Leading a guerilla insurgency on the ring 's surface , the humans discover that the rings are actually weapons of last resort built to contain a terrifying parasite called the Flood . The human supersoldier Master Chief Petty Officer John @-@ 117 and his AI companion Cortana learn from Halo 's AI monitor , 343 Guilty Spark , that activation of the Halos will prevent the spread of the Flood by destroying all sentient life the parasite can subsist on in the galaxy . Instead of activating the ring , however , the Master Chief evades Guilty Spark and his robots and detonates the Pillar of Autumn 's engines , destroying the installation and preventing the escape of the Flood . The Master Chief and Cortana race back to Earth to warn of an impending invasion by Covenant forces . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 Taking place shortly after the events of the novel Halo : First Strike , Halo 2 opens with the trial of Thel ' Vadam , a Covenant Elite commander aboard the Covenant 's mobile capital city of High Charity . The Elite is stripped of his rank , branded a heretic for failing to stop the humans from destroying Halo , and is tortured by Tartarus , the Chieftain of the Covenant Brutes . On Earth , the Master Chief and Sergeant Avery Johnson are commended for their actions at Halo . Lord Terrence Hood awards the soldiers alongside Commander Miranda Keyes , who accepts a medal on behalf of her deceased father , Captain Jacob Keyes . 
 A Covenant fleet appears outside Earth 's defensive perimeter and begins an invasion of the planet . While the UNSC repels most of the fleet , a single Covenant cruiser carrying an important member of the Covenant hierarchy , the High Prophet of Regret , assaults the city of New Mombasa , Kenya . The Master Chief assists in clearing the city of Covenant ; with his fleet destroyed , Regret makes a hasty slipspace jump , and Keyes , Johnson , Cortana and the Master Chief follow aboard the UNSC ship In Amber Clad . The crew discover another Halo installation ; realizing the danger the ring presents , Keyes sends the Master Chief to kill Regret while she and Johnson find Halo 's key to activation , the Index . 
 Meanwhile , the disgraced Covenant commander is presented before the Prophet Hierarchs , who acknowledge that though the destruction of Halo was his fault , he is no heretic . They offer him the honored position of Arbiter so that he can continue to fight for the Covenant . On his first mission to kill a heretic , the Arbiter discovers 343 Guilty Spark , who the Covenant calls an " oracle , " and brings him back to High Charity . Responding to Regret 's distress call , High Charity and the Covenant fleet arrive at the new Halo , Installation 05 , just before the Master Chief kills Regret . <unk> from space , the Chief falls into a lake and is rescued by a mysterious tentacled creature . 
 Regret 's death triggers discord among the races of the Covenant , as the Hierarchs have given the Brutes the Elites ' traditional job of protecting them in the wake of the death . The Arbiter is sent to find Halo 's Index and captures it , Johnson , and Keyes before being confronted by Tartarus . He reveals to the Arbiter that the Prophets have ordered the annihilation of the Elites , and sends the Arbiter falling down a deep chasm . 
 The Arbiter is saved by the tentacled creature and meets the Master Chief in the bowels of the installation . The creature , Gravemind , is the leader of the Flood on Installation 05 . The Gravemind reveals to the Arbiter that the Great Journey would destroy Flood , humans , and Covenant altogether , and sends both the Arbiter and Master Chief to different places to stop Halo 's activation . The Master Chief is teleported into High Charity , where a civil war has broken out among the Covenant ; In Amber Clad crashes into the city , and Cortana realizes that Gravemind used them as a distraction to infest In Amber Clad and spread the Flood . As the parasite overruns the city , consuming the Prophet of Mercy in the process , the Prophet of Truth orders Tartarus to take Keyes , Johnson , and Guilty Spark to Halo 's control room and activate the ring . The Master Chief follows Truth aboard a Forerunner ship leaving the city ; Cortana remains behind to destroy High Charity and Halo if Tartarus succeeds in activating the ring . 
 The Arbiter is sent to the surface of Halo , where he rallies his allies to assault the Brute 's position . With the help of Johnson , he confronts Tartarus in Halo 's control room . When the Arbiter tries to convince Tartarus that the Prophets have betrayed them both , Tartarus angrily activates the ring , and a battle ensues . The Arbiter and Johnson manage to kill Tartarus while Keyes removes the Index . Instead of shutting down the ring entirely , a system wide fail @-@ safe protocol is triggered , putting Installation 05 and all the other Halo rings on standby for activation from a remote location , which Guilty Spark refers to as " the Ark " . As Truth 's ship arrives amidst a raging battle on Earth , Hood asks the Master Chief what he is doing aboard the ship . The Chief replies , " Sir , finishing this fight . " 
 In a post @-@ credits scene , Gravemind is seen arriving on High Charity , where Cortana agrees to answer the Flood intelligence 's questions . 
 = = Development = = 
 Halo had never been planned as a trilogy , but with the critical and commercial success of Combat Evolved , a sequel was expected . Bungie writer and cinematic director Joseph Staten recalled that during Combat Evolved 's development , Bungie " certainly had strong ideas for extending the story and gameplay experience that we knew we couldn 't fit into one game " . The added publisher support for a sequel allowed greater leeway and the ability to return to more ambitious ideas lost during Combat Evolved 's development . 
 An important feature for Halo 2 was multiplayer . Multiplayer in Combat Evolved was accomplished via System Link , and only came together weeks before the game was released . Most players never played large maps , while a subset greatly enjoyed 16 @-@ player action via four networked consoles . " We looked at the small set of fans who were able to do this , " said engineering lead Chris Butcher , " and just how much they were enjoying themselves , and asked ourselves if we could bring that to everybody . That would be something really special , really unique . " 
 The story for Halo 2 grew out of all the elements that were not seen in Halo : Combat Evolved . Jason Jones organized his core ideas for the sequel 's story and approached Staten for input . According to Staten , among the elements that did not make it to the finished game was a " horrible scene of betrayal " where Miranda Keyes straps a bomb to the Master Chief 's back and throws him into a hole ; " Jason was going through a rather difficult breakup at the time and I think that had something to do with it , " he said . 
 Halo 2 was officially announced in September 2002 with a cinematic trailer , subsequently packaged with Halo : Combat Evolved DVDs . A real @-@ time gameplay video was shown at E3 2003 , which was the first actual gameplay seen by the public ; it showcased new features such as dual @-@ wielding and improved graphics . Many elements of the trailer , however , were not game @-@ ready ; the entire graphics engine used in the footage had to be discarded , and the trailer 's environment never appeared in the final game due to limitations on how big the game environments could be . The restructuring of the engine meant that there was no playable build of Halo 2 for nearly a year , and assets and environments produced by art and design teams could not be prototyped . 
 In order to ship the game , Bungie began paring back their ambitions for the single- and multiplayer parts of the game . Chris Butcher commented , " For Halo 2 we had our sights set very high on networking . ... Going from having no Internet multiplayer to developing a completely new online model was a big challenge to tackle all at once , and as a result we had to leave a lot of things undone in order to meet the ship date commitment that we made to our fans . " With only a year to go until release , Bungie went into the " mother of all crunches " in order to finish the game ; in a 2007 interview , Jamie Griesemer , one of Halo 's design leads , said that this lack of a " polish " period near the end of the development cycle was the main reason for Halo 2 's shortcomings . Butcher retrospectively described Halo 2 's multiplayer mode as " a pale shadow of what it could and should have been if we had gotten the timing of our schedule right " ; the campaign mode 's abrupt cliffhanger ending also resulted from the frenzy to ship on time . 
 = = = Windows version = = = 
 On February 9 , 2006 , Nick Baron announced that a version of Halo 2 would be released on PC , exclusively for the Windows Vista operating system . While this was a deliberate decision by Microsoft to push sales of Vista , the game could be enabled to play on Windows XP through an unauthorized third @-@ party patch . The game was ported by a small team at Microsoft Game Studios ( codenamed Hired Gun ) who worked closely with Bungie . As one of the launch titles of Games for Windows – Live , the game offered Live features not available in the Xbox version , such as guide support and achievements . The Windows port also added two exclusive multiplayer maps and a map editor . 
 Halo 2 for Windows Vista was originally scheduled for release on May 8 , 2007 , but the release was pushed back to May 31 on the discovery of partial nudity in the game 's map editor – a photograph of a man mooning the camera was presented as part of the " <unk> " error message . Microsoft offered patches to remove the nude content and revised the box ratings . 
 = = = Cheating and updates = = = 
 A common complaint regarding Halo 2 's online play was widespread cheating , which began occurring almost immediately after the game 's release . Users exploited bugs in the game and vulnerabilities of the network to win ranked games and thus increase their matchmaking rank . 
 Some players used " <unk> " to cheat , in which the player hosting the game intentionally presses the standby button on his or her modem ; this results in all players except the cheaters freezing in place . This way , the cheater would be given time to accomplish an objective in the game . " <unk> " involves using an Elite character and a vehicle , exploiting a glitch which would cause a doppelganger of the player to appear . Cheating also includes <unk> , in which a player uses devices such as Action Replay and computer programs to gain unfair advantages , and bridging , which uses computer programs to give a player " host " status , and therefore the ability to disconnect other players from the game session . A game exploitation called " <unk> " or " <unk> " is labeled cheating by many in the Xbox Live community , and Bungie employees have described it as cheating when used in matchmaking . Another exploit called " <unk> " allowed players to melee , cancel the animation , and quickly attack for an instant kill ; this exploit and many others were removed from the game 's sequel . 
 Bungie released several map packs for Halo 2 , both over Xbox Live and on game discs . The Multiplayer Map Pack is an expansion pack intended to make Xbox Live content and updates available to offline players , and was released on July 5 , 2005 . The disk contains the game 's software update , all nine new multiplayer maps , a documentary about the making of the maps , and a bonus cinematic called " Another Day on the Beach " , among other features . 
 On March 30 , 2007 , Bungie announced that two new maps would be available on April 17 , 2007 . Bungie 's own Frank O 'Connor confirmed that both Xbox and Xbox 360 users would have access to the content . The two new maps were remakes of maps from the original Halo : Combat Evolved , " Hang em ' High " and " Derelict " . Due to issues with distribution of the maps , the updates which made the maps mandatory was released on May 9 , 2007 , later than planned . Bungie also reset all ranks for Halo 2 at the same time . On July 7 , also known as " Bungie Day " , Bungie released the map pack called the " <unk> Map Pack " for free . 
 = = Soundtrack = = 
 Halo 2 's soundtrack was composed primarily by Martin O 'Donnell and his musical partner Michael Salvatori , the team that had composed the critically acclaimed music of Halo . O 'Donnell noted in composing the music for Halo 2 that " Making a sequel is never a simple proposition . You want to make everything that was cool even better , and leave out all the stuff that was weak . " O 'Donnell made sure that no part of the game would be completely silent , noting " Ambient sound is one of the main ways to immerse people psychologically . A dark room is spooky , but add a creaking floorboard and rats skittering in the walls and it becomes really creepy . " Halo 2 , unlike its predecessor , was mixed to take full advantage of Dolby 5 @.@ 1 Digital surround sound . 
 In the summer of 2004 , producer Nile Rodgers and O 'Donnell decided to release the music from Halo 2 on two separate CDs ; the first ( Volume One ) would contain all the themes present in the game as well as music " inspired " by the game ; the second would contain the rest of the music from the game , much of which was incomplete , as the first CD was shipped before the game was released . The first CD was released on November 9 , 2004 , and featured guitar backing by Steve Vai . Additional tracks included various outside musicians , including Steve Vai , Incubus , Breaking Benjamin , and Hoobastank . The Halo 2 Original Soundtrack : Volume Two CD , containing the game music organized in suite form , was released on April 25 , 2006 .

There was a Halo 2 Celebrity Pre @-@ Release Party at E3 2004 , in which a private home was transformed to replicate the world of Halo , complete with camouflaged Marines and roaming <unk> . 
 In addition to more traditional forms of promotion , Halo 2 was also part of an elaborate Alternate Reality Game project titled " I Love Bees , " which cost an estimated one million dollars . This " game " centered on a hacked website , supposedly a site about beekeeping , where an AI from the future was residing . The project garnered significant attention from sites including Slashdot and Wired News ; Wired noted that the game was drawing attention away from the 2004 Presidential Election . The game won an award for creativity at the 5th annual Game Developers Choice Awards and was nominated for a Webby award . On the morning of October 14 , 2004 , a leak of the French version of the game was posted on the Internet , and circulated widely . 
 Halo 2 was sold in both a standard and " Limited Collector 's Edition " . The Collector 's Edition features the regular edition and includes several promotional offers , a special cover and a special DVD of the making of Halo 2 . The instructional booklet is also written from the Covenant point of view rather than from the UNSC point of view used in the regular edition . Also enclosed is the " Conversations from the Universe " booklet that contains additional information from both the human and the Covenant side of the Halo storyline ; transcripts are available online . The game is enclosed in an aluminum case with the Halo 2 logo . 
 The first official release of Halo 2 was in Canada , Australia , New Zealand and the United States on November 9 , 2004 . Anticipation for the game was high ; three weeks before this release , a record 1 @.@ 5 million copies had already been pre @-@ ordered . Massive lines formed at midnight releases of the game ; the event garnered significant media attention . This was followed by releases on November 10 , 2004 in France and other European countries , and November 11 in the UK . The game sold 2 @.@ 4 million copies and earned up to US $ 125 million in its first 24 hours on store shelves , thus out @-@ grossing the film Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Man 's Chest as the highest grossing release in entertainment history . The game sold 260 @,@ 000 units in the United Kingdom in its first week , making it the third fastest @-@ selling title in that territory . On June 20 , 2006 , Xbox.com reported that more than a half @-@ billion games of Halo 2 have been played on Xbox Live since its debut . Halo 2 is the best @-@ selling first @-@ generation Xbox game with 8 @.@ 46 million copies sold by November 2008 . As of September 25 , 2007 , Halo 2 was the fifth best @-@ selling video game in the United States with 6 @.@ 3 million copies sold , according to the NPD Group . From the day of its initial release and up until mid @-@ November 2006 , Halo 2 was the most popular video game on Xbox Live , even after the release of the Xbox 360 ; its position was eventually surpassed in 2006 by the 360 @-@ exclusive Gears of War . Halo and Halo 2 are still some of the most played games for the Xbox console .

 Halo 2 received critical acclaim . On review aggregate sites GameRankings and Metacritic , the game has attained overall scores of 94 @.@ 57 % and 95 out of 100 , respectively . Halo 2 received multiple awards , including Best Console game and Best Sound Design from the Interactive Achievement Awards . According to Xbox.com , the game has received more than 38 individual awards . 
 Many reviewers praised the audio for being especially vivid . Multiplayer especially was noted in being the best on Xbox Live at the time . Game Informer , along with numerous other publications , rated it higher than Halo : Combat Evolved , citing enhanced multiplayer and less repetitive gameplay . Most critics noted that Halo 2 stuck with the formula that made its predecessor successful , and was alternatively praised and faulted for this decision . Edge 's review concluded that Halo 2 could be summed up with a line from its script : " It 's not a new plan . But we know it 'll work . " 
 The game 's campaign mode received some criticism for being too short , and for featuring an abrupt cliffhanger ending . GameSpot noted that although the story 's switching between the Covenant and human factions made the plot more intricate , it distracted the player from Earth 's survival and the main point of the game ; while Edge labeled the plot " a confusing mess of fan @-@ fiction sci @-@ fi and bemusing Episode @-@ II @-@ style politics . " 
 The Windows version of the game received mixed reviews , with IGN rating it a 7 @.@ 5 / 10 , and GameSpot giving it a 7 @.@ 0 / 10 . Most criticism was due to the late release date , and the graphics being dated . It received an aggregate score of 72 @.@ 67 % from GameRankings and 72 out of 100 from Metacritic .

 Several publications have listed Halo 2 's innovative matchmaking technology as one of the turning points in the gaming industry during the 2000s . Television channel G4 's Sterling McGarvey wrote that " Bungie 's sequel was a shot in the arm for Xbox Live subscriptions and previewed many of the features that would set the standard for Microsoft 's online service on the next machine " . The editors of Popular Mechanics listed Halo 2 as one of the top fifteen events of the decade , crediting the game with bringing online multiplayer to the console masses . The Province 's Paul Chapman concurred , writing that games like Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 would not be as enjoyable to play if not for the ground Halo 2 broke .

 While initially released in Europe as a bonus disc for a special edition of Youthanasia , Hidden Treasures was released as a stand @-@ alone EP in Japan and the US on July 18 , 1995 . It debuted at number 90 on the Billboard 200 chart and sold 13 @,@ 000 copies in its first week . By December 2005 , Hidden Treasures sold 286 @,@ 000 copies in the United States . It also appeared on album charts in the UK and Japan , but did not achieve notable success . The album has gone out of print in the US , but was reissued in 2007 for the Japanese and European markets . 
 The EP has received generally mediocre reaction from critics . AllMusic 's Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that the EP doesn 't have many " first @-@ rate songs " and that only " 99 Ways to Die " made an impression . The Rolling Stone Album Guide was dismissive of the EP ; the staff reviewer commented that the album is worth hearing only for " 99 Ways to Die " . Dean <unk> of the Chicago Tribune wrote that the album is " typical Megadeth " featuring " fast @-@ forward riffing " and " snooty snarling " vocals . Carlos Ramirez from Noisecreep felt that the album contains many underrated songs that " also deserve their time in the spotlight " and highlighted the dueling guitar leads by Mustaine and Friedman featured in " Go to Hell " . Despite the negative reviews , material featured on the EP has been credited with helping expand the group 's MTV audience in the early 1990s .

 = Japanese battleship Musashi = 
 Musashi ( <unk> ) was the second ship of the Yamato class of Imperial Japanese Navy World War II battleships . 
 She and her sister ship , Yamato , were the heaviest battleships ever constructed , displacing 72 @,@ 800 tonnes at full load and armed with nine 46 cm ( 18 @.@ 1 inch ) 45 Caliber Type 94 main guns , which were the largest guns ever mounted on a warship . Neither ship survived the war . 
 Named after Japan 's ancient Musashi Province , the Musashi was commissioned in mid @-@ 1942 , modified to serve as the flagship of the Combined Fleet , and spent the rest of the year working up . The ship was transferred to Truk in early 1943 and sortied several times that year with the fleet in unsuccessful searches for American forces . She was used to transfer forces and equipment between Japan and various occupied islands several times in 1944 . <unk> in early 1944 by an American submarine , Musashi was forced to return to Japan for repairs , where the navy greatly augmented her anti @-@ aircraft armament . She was present during the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June , but did not come in contact with American surface forces . Musashi was sunk by an estimated 19 torpedo and 17 bomb hits from American carrier @-@ based aircraft on 24 October 1944 during the Battle of Leyte Gulf . Over half of her crew was rescued . 
 Her wreck was located in March 2015 by Microsoft co @-@ founder Paul Allen and his team of researchers . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 During the 1930s the Japanese government adopted an ultranationalist militancy with a view to greatly expanding the Japanese Empire . Japan withdrew from the League of Nations in 1934 , renouncing its treaty obligations . After withdrawing from the Washington Naval Treaty , which limited the size and power of capital ships , the Imperial Japanese Navy began their design of the new Yamato class of heavy battleships . Their planners recognized Japan would be unable to compete with the output of U.S. naval shipyards should war break out , so the 70 @,@ 000 ton vessels of the Yamato class were designed to be capable of engaging multiple enemy battleships at the same time . 
 Musashi had a length of 244 metres ( 800 ft 6 in ) between perpendiculars and 263 metres ( 862 ft 10 in ) overall . She had a beam of 36 @.@ 9 metres ( 121 ft 1 in ) and a draft of 10 @.@ 86 metres ( 35 @.@ 6 ft ) at deep <unk> she displaced 64 @,@ 000 long tons ( 65 @,@ 000 t ) at standard load and 71 @,@ 659 long tons ( 72 @,@ 809 t ) at deep load . Her crew consisted of 2 @,@ 500 officers and enlisted men in 1942 , and about 2 @,@ 800 in 1944 . 
 The battleship had four sets of Kampon geared steam turbines , each of which drove one propeller shaft . The turbines were designed to produce a total of 150 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 110 @,@ 000 kW ) , using steam provided by 12 Kampon water @-@ tube boilers , to give her a maximum speed of 27 knots ( 50 km / h ; 31 mph ) . She had a stowage capacity of 6 @,@ 300 long tons ( 6 @,@ 400 t ) of fuel oil , giving a range of 7 @,@ 200 nautical miles ( 13 @,@ 300 km ; 8 @,@ 300 mi ) at a speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Musashi 's main battery consisted of nine 45 @-@ calibre 46 cm ( 18 @.@ 1 in ) Type 94 guns mounted in three triple gun turrets , numbered from front to rear , each with an elevation range of − 5 to + 45 degrees . They fired a 1 @,@ 460 @-@ kilogram ( 3 @,@ 220 lb ) armour @-@ piercing ( AP ) shell to a range of 42 @,@ 000 metres ( 46 @,@ 000 yd ) . These were the largest @-@ calibre guns ever fitted to a ship . The guns had a rate of fire of 1 @.@ 5 to 2 rounds per minute . 
 The ship 's secondary battery consisted of twelve 60 @-@ calibre 15 @.@ 5 cm ( 6 @.@ 1 in ) 3rd Year Type guns mounted in four triple turrets , one each fore and aft of the superstructure and one on each side amidships . These had become available once the Mogami @-@ class cruisers were rearmed with 20 @.@ 3 @-@ centimetre ( 8 @.@ 0 in ) guns . With a 55 @.@ 87 @-@ kilogram ( 123 @.@ 2 lb ) AP shell , the guns had a maximum range of 27 @,@ 400 metres ( 30 @,@ 000 yd ) at an elevation of 45 degrees . Their rate of fire was five rounds per minute . Heavy anti @-@ aircraft defence was provided by a dozen 40 @-@ calibre 127 @-@ millimetre Type 89 dual @-@ purpose guns in six twin turrets , three on each side of the superstructure . When firing at surface targets , the guns had a range of 14 @,@ 700 metres ( 16 @,@ 100 yd ) ; they had a maximum ceiling of 9 @,@ 440 metres ( 30 @,@ 970 ft ) at their maximum elevation of 90 degrees . Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute ; their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute . 
 Musashi also carried thirty @-@ six 25 mm Type 96 light anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns in triple @-@ gun mounts , all mounted on the superstructure . These 25 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) guns had an effective range of 1 @,@ 500 – 3 @,@ 000 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 – 3 @,@ 300 yd ) , and an effective ceiling of 5 @,@ 500 metres ( 18 @,@ 000 ft ) at an elevation of + 85 degrees . The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteen @-@ round magazines . This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II ; it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon . According to historian Mark Stille , the twin and triple mounts " lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation ; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets ; the gun exhibited excessive vibration ; the magazine was too small , and ... the gun produced excessive muzzle blast " . The ship was also provided with two twin mounts for the licence @-@ built 13 @.@ 2 mm Type 93 anti @-@ aircraft machine guns , one on each side of the bridge . The maximum range of these guns was 6 @,@ 500 metres ( 7 @,@ 100 yd ) , but the effective range against aircraft was only 1 @,@ 000 metres ( 1 @,@ 100 yd ) . The cyclic rate was adjustable between 425 and 475 rounds per minute ; the need to change 30 @-@ round magazines reduced the effective rate to 250 rounds per minute . 
 While the ship was under repair in April 1944 , the two 15 @.@ 5 centimetre wing turrets were removed and replaced with three triple 25 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) gun mounts each . Twenty @-@ one triple 25 mm mounts and 25 single mounts were added , for a total light AA armament of one hundred and thirty 25 mm guns . 
 = = = Armour = = = 
 The ship 's waterline armour belt was 410 millimetres ( 16 @.@ 1 in ) thick and angled outwards 20 degrees at the top . Below it was a strake of armour that ranged in thickness from 270 to 200 millimetres ( 10 @.@ 6 to 7 @.@ 9 in ) over the magazines and machinery spaces respectively ; it tapered to a thickness of 75 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) at its bottom edge . The deck armour ranged in thickness from 230 to 200 millimetres ( 9 @.@ 1 to 7 @.@ 9 in ) . The turrets were protected with an armour 650 millimetres ( 25 @.@ 6 in ) thick on the face , 250 millimetres ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) on the sides , and 270 millimetres on the roof . The barbettes of the turrets were protected by armour 560 to 280 millimetres ( 22 @.@ 0 to 11 @.@ 0 in ) thick , and the turrets of the 155 mm guns were protected by 50 @-@ millimetre ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) armour plates . The sides of the conning tower were 500 millimetres ( 19 @.@ 7 in ) thick and it had a 200 @-@ millimetre thick roof . Underneath the magazines were 50 @-@ to @-@ 80 @-@ millimetre ( 2 @.@ 0 to 3 @.@ 1 in ) armour plates to protect the ship from mine damage . Musashi contained 1147 watertight compartments ( 1065 underneath the armour deck , 82 above ) to preserve buoyancy in the event of battle damage . 
 = = = Aircraft = = = 
 Musashi was fitted with two catapults on her quarterdeck and could stow up to seven floatplanes in her below @-@ decks hangar . The ship operated Mitsubishi F1M biplanes and Aichi <unk> monoplanes and used a 6 @-@ tonne ( 5 @.@ 9 @-@ long @-@ ton ) , stern @-@ mounted crane for recovery . 
 = = = Fire control and sensors = = = 
 The ship was equipped with four 15 @-@ metre ( 49 ft 3 in ) rangefinders , one atop her forward superstructure and one each in her main gun turrets , and another 10 @-@ metre ( 32 ft 10 in ) unit atop her rear superstructure . Each 15 @.@ 5 @-@ centimetre ( 6 @.@ 1 in ) gun turret was equipped with an 8 @-@ metre ( 26 ft 3 in ) rangefinder . Low @-@ angle fire was controlled by two Type 98 fire @-@ control directors mounted above the rangefinders on the superstructure . Type 94 high @-@ angle directors controlled the 12 @.@ 7 mm AA guns , with Type 95 short @-@ range directors for the 25 mm AA guns . 
 Musashi was built with a Type 0 hydrophone system in her bow . It was only usable while stationary or at low speed . In September 1942 a Type 21 air @-@ search radar was installed on the roof of the 15 @-@ metre rangefinder at the top of the forward superstructure . Two Type 22 surface @-@ search radars were installed on the forward superstructure in July 1943 . During repairs in April 1944 , the Type 21 radar was replaced by a more modern version and a Type 13 early warning radar was fitted . 
 = = Construction = = 
 To cope with Musashi 's great size and weight , the construction slipway was reinforced , nearby workshops were expanded , and two floating cranes were built . The ship 's keel was laid down on 29 March 1938 at Mitsubishi 's Nagasaki shipyard , and was designated " Battleship No. 2 " . Throughout construction , a large curtain made of hemp rope weighing 408 t ( 450 short tons ) prevented outsiders from viewing construction . 
 Launching the Musashi presented its own problems . The ship 's 4 @-@ metre ( 13 ft 1 in ) thick launch platform , made of nine 44 cm ( 17 in ) Douglas fir planks bolted together , took two years to assemble ( from keel @-@ laying in March 1938 ) because of the difficulty in drilling perfectly straight bolt holes through four metres of fresh timber . The problem of slowing and stopping the massive hull once inside the narrow Nagasaki Harbour was addressed by attaching 570 tonnes ( 560 long tons ) of heavy chains divided evenly between the two sides of the hull to create dragging resistance in the water . The launch , like the ship itself , had to be concealed from prying eyes ; the most important means of accomplishing this was a citywide air @-@ raid drill staged on the launch day to keep everyone inside their homes . Musashi was successfully launched on 1 November 1940 , coming to a stop only 1 metre ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) in excess of the hull 's calculated 220 metres ( 720 ft ) travel distance across the harbour . The entry of such a large mass into the water caused a 120 cm ( 3 ft 11 in ) tsunami , which propagated throughout the harbour and up the local rivers , flooding homes and capsizing small fishing boats . Musashi was fitted out at nearby Sasebo , with Captain Kaoru Arima assigned as her commanding officer . 
 Towards the end of fitting out , the ship 's flagship facilities , including those on the bridge and in the admiral 's cabins , were modified to satisfy Combined Fleet 's desire to have the ship equipped as the primary flagship of the commander @-@ in @-@ chief , as her sister Yamato was too far along for such changes . These alterations , along with improvements in the secondary battery armour , pushed back completion and pre @-@ handover testing of Musashi by two months , to August 1942 . 
 = = Service = = 
 Musashi was commissioned at Nagasaki on 5 August 1942 , and assigned to the 1st Battleship Division together with Yamato , Nagato , and Mutsu . Beginning five days later , the ship conducted machinery and aircraft @-@ handling trials near Hashirajima . Her secondary armament of twelve 127 mm guns , 12 triple 25 mm gun mounts , and four 13 @.@ 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 52 in ) anti @-@ aircraft machine guns was fitted from 3 – 28 September 1942 at Kure , as well as a Type 21 radar . The ship was working up for the rest of the year . Captain Arima was promoted to rear admiral on 1 November . 
 Musashi was assigned to the Combined Fleet , commanded by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto , on 15 January 1943 and sailed for Truk three days later , arriving on 22 January . On 11 February , she replaced her sister ship Yamato as the fleet 's flagship . On 3 April , Yamamoto left Musashi and flew to Rabaul , New Britain to personally direct " Operation I @-@ Go " , a Japanese aerial offensive in the Solomon Islands . His orders were intercepted and deciphered by Magic , and American Lockheed P @-@ 38 Lightning fighters shot down his aircraft and killed him in Operation Vengeance while he was en route from New Britain to <unk> , Bougainville . On 23 April , his cremated remains were flown back to Truk and placed in his cabin on board Musashi . 
 On 17 May , in response to American attacks on Attu Island , Musashi — together with the carrier Hiyō , two heavy cruisers , and nine destroyers — sortied to the northern Pacific . When no contact was made with American forces , the ships sailed to Kure on 23 May , where Yamamoto 's ashes were taken from the vessel in preparation for a formal state funeral . Immediately afterwards , Musashi 's task force was significantly reinforced to counterattack American naval forces off Attu , but the island was captured before the force could intervene . On 9 June Arima was relieved by captain Keizō Komura . On 24 June , while being overhauled at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal , Musashi was visited by Emperor Hirohito and high @-@ ranking naval officers . From 1 to 8 July , the ship was fitted with a pair of Type 22 radars at Kure . She sailed for Truk on 30 July and arrived there six days later , where she resumed her position as fleet flagship for Admiral Mineichi Koga . 
 In mid @-@ October , in response to suspicions of planned American raids on Wake Island , Musashi led a large fleet — three carriers , six battleships , and 11 cruisers — to intercept American forces , but failed to make contact and returned to Truk on 26 October . She spent the remainder of 1943 in Truk Lagoon . Captain Komura was promoted to rear admiral on 1 November and transferred to the 3rd Fleet on 7 December as Chief of Staff , Captain Bunji Asakura assuming command of Musashi . 
 The ship remained in Truk Lagoon until 10 February 1944 , when she returned to Yokosuka . On 24 February , Musashi sailed for Palau , carrying one Imperial Japanese Army battalion and another of Special Naval Landing Forces and their equipment . After losing most of her deck cargo during a typhoon , she arrived at Palau on 29 February and remained there for the next month . On 29 March , Musashi departed Palau under cover of darkness to avoid an expected air raid , and encountered the submarine USS Tunny , which fired six torpedoes at the battleship ; five of them missed , but the sixth blew a hole 5 @.@ 8 metres ( 19 ft ) in diameter near the bow , flooding her with 3000 tonnes of water . The torpedo hit killed seven crewmen and wounded another eleven . After temporary repairs , Musashi sailed for Japan later that night and arrived at Kure Naval Arsenal on 3 April . From 10 to 22 April , she was repaired and her anti @-@ aircraft armament was substantially increased . When she undocked on 22 April , the ship 's secondary battery comprised six 15 @.@ 5 cm guns , twenty @-@ four 12 @.@ 7 cm guns , one hundred and thirty 25 mm guns , and four 13 @.@ 2 mm machine guns . She also received new radars ( which were still primitive compared to American equipment ) , and depth @-@ charge rails were installed on her fantail . 
 In May 1944 , captain Asakura was promoted to rear admiral and Musashi departed Kure for Okinawa on 10 May , then for Tawitawi on 12 May . She was assigned to the 1st Mobile Fleet , under the command of Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa , with her sister . On 10 June , the battleships departed Tawitawi for <unk> under the command of Vice Admiral Matome Ugaki , in preparation for Operation Kon , a planned counterattack against the American invasion of Biak . Two days later , when word reached Ugaki of American attacks on Saipan , his force was diverted to the Mariana Islands . After they rendezvoused with Ozawa 's main force on 16 June , the battleships were assigned to Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita 's 2nd Fleet . During the Battle of the Philippine Sea , Musashi was not attacked . Following Japan 's disastrous defeat in the battle ( also known as the " Great Marianas Turkey Shoot " ) , the Second Fleet returned to Japan . On 8 July , Musashi and her sister embarked 3 @,@ 522 men and equipment of the Army 's 106th Infantry Regiment of the 49th Infantry Division and sailed for Lingga Island , where they arrived on 17 July . 
 = = = Battle of Leyte Gulf = = = 
 Captain <unk> Inoguchi relieved Asakura in command of Musashi on 12 August and was promoted to rear admiral on 15 October . Three days later , she sailed for Brunei Bay , Borneo , to join the main Japanese fleet in preparation for " Operation Sho @-@ 1 " , the counterattack planned against the American landings at Leyte . The Japanese plan called for Ozawa 's carrier forces to lure the American carrier fleets north of Leyte so that Kurita 's 1st Diversion Force ( also known as the Central Force ) could enter Leyte Gulf and destroy American forces landing on the island . Musashi , together with the rest of Kurita 's force , departed Brunei for the Philippines on 22 October . 
 The following day , the submarine USS Dace torpedoed and sank the heavy cruiser Maya near Palawan . The destroyer <unk> rescued 769 survivors and transferred them to Musashi later in the day . On 24 October , while transiting the Sibuyan Sea , Kurita 's ships were spotted by a reconnaissance aircraft from the fleet carrier USS Intrepid . Just over two hours later , the battleship was attacked by eight Curtiss SB2C Helldiver dive bombers from Intrepid at 10 : 27 . One 500 @-@ pound ( 230 kg ) bomb struck the roof of Turret No. 1 , failing to penetrate . Two minutes later , Musashi was struck starboard amidships by a torpedo from a Grumman TBF Avenger , also from Intrepid . The ship took on 3 @,@ 000 long tons ( 3 @,@ 000 t ) of water and a 5 @.@ 5 degree list to starboard that was later reduced to 1 degree by counterflooding compartments on the opposite side . During this attack two Avengers were shot down . 
 An hour and a half later , another eight Helldivers from Intrepid attacked Musashi again . One bomb hit the upper deck and failed to detonate ; another hit the port side of the deck and penetrated two decks before exploding above one of the engine rooms . Fragments broke a steam pipe in the engine room and forced its abandonment as well as that of the adjacent boiler room . Power was lost to the port inboard propeller shaft and the ship 's speed dropped to 22 knots ( 41 km / h ; 25 mph ) . Anti @-@ aircraft fire shot down two Helldivers during this attack . Three minutes later , nine Avengers attacked from both sides of the ship , scoring three torpedo hits on the port side . One hit abreast Turret No. 1 , the second flooded a hydraulic machinery room forcing the main turrets to switch over to auxiliary hydraulic pumps , and the third flooded another engine room . More counterflooding reduced the list to one degree to port , but the degree of flooding reduced the ship 's forward freeboard by 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) . During this attack , Musashi fired <unk> anti @-@ aircraft shells from her main armament ; one shell detonated in the middle gun of Turret No. 1 , possibly because of a bomb fragment in the barrel , and wrecked the turret 's elevating machinery . 
 At 13 : 31 , the ship was attacked by 29 aircraft from the fleet carriers Essex and Lexington . Two Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters strafed the ship 's deck and Helldivers scored four more bomb hits near her forward turrets . Musashi was hit by four more torpedoes , three of which were forward of Turret No. 1 , causing extensive flooding . The ship was now listing one degree to starboard , and had taken on so much water that her bow was now down 13 feet ( 4 @.@ 0 m ) and her speed had been reduced to 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) . Two hours later nine Helldivers from Enterprise attacked with 1 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 450 kg ) armour @-@ piercing bombs , scoring four hits . The ship was hit by three more torpedoes , opening up her starboard bow and reducing her speed to 13 knots ( 24 km / h ; 15 mph ) . At 15 : 25 , Musashi was attacked by 37 aircraft from Intrepid , the fleet carrier Franklin and the light carrier Cabot . The ship was hit by 13 bombs and 11 more torpedoes during this attack for the loss of three Avengers and three Helldivers . Her speed was reduced to 6 knots ( 11 km / h ; 6 @.@ 9 mph ) , her main steering engine was temporarily knocked out and her rudder was briefly jammed 15 degrees to port . Counterflooding reduced her list to six degrees to port from its previous maximum of ten degrees . Musashi had been struck by a total of 19 torpedoes and 17 bombs . 
 Kurita left Musashi to fend for herself at 15 : 30 , and encountered her again at 16 : 21 after reversing course . The ship was headed north , with a list of 10 degrees to port , down 26 feet ( 7 @.@ 9 m ) at the bow with her forecastle awash . He detailed a heavy cruiser and two destroyers to escort her while frantic efforts were made to correct her list , including flooding another engine room and some boiler rooms . Her engines stopped before she could be beached . At 19 : 15 her list reached 12 degrees and her crew was ordered to prepare to abandon ship , which they did fifteen minutes later when the list reached 30 degrees .

 = Ontario Highway 7A = 
 King 's Highway 7A , commonly referred to as Highway 7A , is a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario that serves as a bypass of Highway 7 . The highway begins in the community of Manchester , where Highway 7 is concurrent with Highway 12 , and travels east through Port Perry , <unk> Station , Bethany and Cavan , ending at Highway 115 southwest of Peterborough . From there , Highway 7 can be reached via Highway 115 northbound . Near its midpoint the route is concurrent with Highway 35 for 1 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 93 mi ) . 
 Highway 7A is 48 @.@ 3 kilometres ( 30 @.@ 0 mi ) long , passing through the Regional Municipality of Durham , city of Kawartha Lakes and Peterborough County . Outside of the communities it serves , the highway passes through generally agricultural areas , though it enters the Oak Ridges Moraine near Highway 35 . 
 The highway was designated in the 1930s in downtown Peterborough and shortly thereafter was extended west to Manchester . The causeways over Lake Scugog date back to the 1850s , and were repeatedly reinforced over the course of a century to reach their current state . During the 1950s , the construction of Highway 115 caused the route of Highway 7A to be modified . At the end of the decade , the causeways were reconstructed for the final time . The eastern end of the highway was reconfigured several times before arriving at its current routing after the 1960s . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Highway 7A is a 48 @.@ 3 @-@ kilometre ( 30 @.@ 0 mi ) highway which serves as an alternative route to Highway 7 , bypassing Lindsay and providing a shorter and more direct southern route between Whitby and Peterborough . It begins in the community of Manchester at an intersection with Highway 7 and Highway 12 . West of this intersection , the road continues as Durham Regional Road 21 towards Stouffville . The highway travels northeast into the town of Port Perry , where it curves east and becomes Scugog Street . Passing through the town , the highway serves as a commercial strip , centring on Simcoe Street . In the east end of the town , the highway passes several big @-@ box retailers before crossing the western arm of Lake Scugog on the Scugog Causeway . 
 On Scugog Island now , the highway first passes Island Road ( Durham Regional Road 7 ) , which leads to Great Blue Heron Casino and the Mississaugas of Scugog Island reserve , then curves southeast and enters the Osler Marsh . It once continued east along what is now Reader Road and curved southeast at the end of that road . The modern route , constructed when the causeways were reinforced in the 1960s , lies south of the original route . The route continues southeast across the Cartwright Causeway , separating the eastern arm of Lake Scugog from the marsh . After approximately a kilometre ( 0 @.@ 6 miles ) , the highway curves east and continues for 1 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 93 mi ) to the end of the causeway . For the next 3 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 0 mi ) , the highway travels straight to the east past farmland , then curves north near Blackstock . It intersects Durham Regional Road 57 , which travels south to Bowmanville . The two routes travels north concurrently with for 1 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 75 mi ) before Road 57 departs north towards Caesarea as Highway 7A gently curves east and passes through the former railway village of <unk> Station . 
 Returning to farmland , the highway enters the northern tip of the Oak Ridges Moraine and the terrain begins to undulate near the border between Durham Region and Kawartha Lakes . Eventually , the farmland transitions into forests and the highway dives into and out of glacial ravines ; these form the headwaters of the Pigeon River . The route intersects Highway 35 approximately 11 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 8 mi ) east of <unk> Station ; both highways travel south concurrently for 1 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 93 mi ) before Highway 7A branches east and Highway 35 continues south to Orono and Newcastle . A carpool parking lot is also available at this junction . 
 Highway 7A continues east through a valley @-@ ridden region containing a mix of thick deciduous forests and farmland . Shortly after passing the northern terminus of City Road 32 ( Porter Road ) , the highway enters the village of Bethany , where it crosses the Victoria Rail Trail and intersects the southern terminus of City Road 38 ( Ski Hill Road ) before curving southeast and entering Peterborough County . The highway curves back to the east and passes through a final ravine . It crosses through farmland before entering the community of Cavan , where it meets County Road 10 . Approximately 1 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 93 mi ) east of Cavan , Highway 7A ends at an interchange with Highway 115 , which itself intersects and becomes concurrent with Highway 7 approximately 4 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 8 mi ) northeast of this point , thereafter continuing into Peterborough . 
 = = History = = 
 The history of Highway 7A is largely connected to that of Lake Scugog , and has played an important role for over a century , although the highway was not designated until the 1930s . Joseph Bigelow , a businessman and later the Reeve of Port Perry and James Graham , Reeve of Scugog , played a significant role in the construction of two causeways across the lake – the Scugog and the Cartwright Causeways . These were gradually reinforced over the span of a century ( 1856 – 1960 ) before reaching their present state , and now carry Highway 7A . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 Lake Scugog was created when William Purdy and his sons dammed the Scugog River in Lindsay ( Upstream from the current dam and locks ) in 1834 to power his grist mill . With the raised water levels , the highlands of Scugog Township became an island , separated from Cartwright Township to the southeast , and from Port Perry and Reach Township to the west . As a result , residents were forced to ferry across the lake during the summer and across the ice during the winter . The periods between were precarious , with many carts falling through the thawing ice and into the marsh . In 1852 , Ontario County was formed , and residents began to petition the new government for construction of a bridge from Port Perry across to the island . Scugog Township passed Bylaw No. 2 on February 25 , 1856 , which granted $ 1000 towards construction of a floating bridge . 
 The bridge proved to be an expensive burden , and for many years the responsibility for maintaining it was repeatedly shifted from township to county and back again . Ice would often carry away entire sections of the bridge during the spring thaw , requiring <unk> or complete reconstruction . In the spring of 1876 , work began to convert the first 180 metres ( 590 ft ) of the Port Perry side of the floating bridge into a permanent embankment . Logs were placed along both sides the bridge and various materials piled between them , sinking it into the soft soil below . Earth laid over top to provide a stable surface . The process also increased the width of the roadbed from 3 @.@ 7 metres ( 12 ft ) to 5 @.@ 5 metres ( 18 ft ) . 
 Further construction on the Scugog Causeway met fierce opposition from county officials , who argued that the new method had not even faced a winter season . It took until July 1878 for work to resume , when Port Perry Reeve Joshua Wright managed to manipulate the county council , convincing them " to strike out the magnificent $ 150 [ grant for seasonal maintenance which they had offered ] and stipulate that 600 feet be filled in on the east end of the bridge . " A contract for this work was tendered in June 1879 , and completed one year later . Finally , in early 1885 , work on the final 180 metres began . This work was completed in July , at which point repairs were carried out on the existing sections . 
 Construction of the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ kilometre ( 2 @.@ 6 mi ) Cartwright Causeway took place after nearly two decades of effort by its chief promoter , Joseph Bigelow . Bigelow witnessed the business opportunity that the Scugog Bridge opened up , and wished to construct a second structure towards Blackstock , opening the Port Perry markets to the fertile agricultural land of Cartwright Township . He first approached the Ontario County council in 1872 with his proposal , but was refused the funding . The council agreed to set up a committee , through which Bigelow sought out investors . In 1882 , the Lake Scugog Marsh Lands Drainage Company , which had purchased the marshlands south of the proposed causeway , approached Bigelow with an offer to build his causeway as part of their plans to drain the marsh . They required a small investment in order to proceed with the work , but council ultimately refused even this , forcing the company to sell off its lands . 
 Undeterred , Bigelow continued to accrue funds from other level of government and surrounding townships . By 1889 , he had enough to begin work . Unlike the Scugog Bridge , Bigelow ensured that his structure would be permanent from the beginning and constructed a majority of the causeway by removing the top layer of peat from the marsh , piling logs in lengthwise approximately a metre deep and covering the exposed surface with the same depth of earth . By early 1891 , the causeway was completed , and shortly thereafter trees were planted along both sides . 
 The combined 12 @-@ kilometre ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) route quickly grew to be the main east – west transportation corridor in the area . However , due to the soft soils and clay on which the causeway was built , it sank at a continuous rate and still required maintenance to keep it above water during the spring thaw . In 1928 , both causeways were reinforced , widened and heightened in response to growing automobile usage . 
 = = = King 's Highway = = = 
 By 1934 , the Department of Highways assumed Lansdowne Street in Peterborough as Highway 7A , providing an alternate route south of downtown . At that point in time , Highway 7 entered Peterborough by following Lindsay Street east from Fowlers Corners to <unk> Road and curving southeast . It followed <unk> Road to Reid Street , which it then followed south . The route proceeded west along <unk> Street and south along George Street to Lansdowne Street , which it followed east out of Peterborough . Highway 28 entered Peterborough from the west along Lansdowne Street , curving north at what is now Ford Street . It followed this onto what is now <unk> Avenue , and curved east onto Charlotte Street , which it followed to George Street . Highway 7A thus provided a direct route between Highway 28 and Highway 7 south of Peterborough . 
 In May 1938 , Highway 7A was extended west to Highway 7 and Highway 12 at Manchester via Bethany and Port Perry . This created a concurrency with Highway 28 and brought the length of the highway to 68 kilometres ( 42 mi ) . The new extension was a gravel road between Port Perry and Highway 28 , but the section between Port Perry and Blackstock was paved by October 1939 . 
 In late 1954 , Highway 115 was opened between Highway 35 at Enterprise Hill and Highway 28 south of Springville . As a result , Highway 7A was rerouted concurrently along a short section of the new highway . Several highways were rerouted in 1960 , including Highway 7 , which was redirected at Fowlers Corners to curve south and meet Highway 28 near Springville ; the former route became Highway 7B . During the spring of 2003 , Highway 7A was truncated at Highway 115 near Cavan , taking on its current routing . 
 During the late 1950s , spring flooding began to become problematic on both causeways , prompting the Department of Highways to reconstruct them and the approaches . Soil investigations were carried out over the length of the road in mid @-@ 1959 , and in August 1960 contracts were tendered for construction . The existing causeways were both closed as the adjacent marsh was excavated up to 6 metres ( 20 ft ) deep . Nearby properties were purchased for the sole purpose of excavating for earth for fill , which was trucked at a continuous rate . Over 8 @,@ 100 @,@ 000 cubic feet ( 230 @,@ 000 m3 ) of organic material was removed from the marsh and 12 @,@ 494 @,@ 574 cubic feet ( 353 @,@ 806 @.@ 9 m3 ) of fill placed over several years of construction . As a result of this , the roadbed no longer sinks into the marsh and spring melt no longer poses an issue .

 = Rotavirus = 
 Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe vomiting and diarrhoea among infants and young children . It is a genus of double @-@ stranded RNA viruses in the family <unk> . Nearly every child in the world has been infected with rotavirus at least once by the age of five . Immunity develops with each infection , so subsequent infections are less severe ; adults are rarely affected . There are eight species of this virus , referred to as A , B , C , D , E , F , G and H. Rotavirus A , the most common species , causes more than 90 % of rotavirus infections in humans . 
 The virus is transmitted by the faecal @-@ oral route . It infects and damages the cells that line the small intestine and causes gastroenteritis ( which is often called " stomach flu " despite having no relation to influenza ) . Although rotavirus was discovered in 1973 by Ruth Bishop and her colleagues by electron <unk> images and accounts for up to 50 % of hospitalisations for severe diarrhoea in infants and children , its importance has been underestimated within the public health community , particularly in developing countries . In addition to its impact on human health , rotavirus also infects animals , and is a pathogen of livestock . 
 Rotavirus is usually an easily managed disease of childhood , but worldwide more than 450 @,@ 000 children under five years of age still die from rotavirus infection each year , most of whom live in developing countries , and almost two million more become severely ill . In the United States , before initiation of the rotavirus vaccination programme , rotavirus caused about 2 @.@ 7 million cases of severe gastroenteritis in children , almost 60 @,@ 000 hospitalizations , and around 37 deaths each year . Public health campaigns to combat rotavirus focus on providing oral rehydration therapy for infected children and vaccination to prevent the disease . The incidence and severity of rotavirus infections has declined significantly in countries that have added rotavirus vaccine to their routine childhood immunisation policies . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 <unk> enteritis is a mild to severe disease characterised by nausea , vomiting , watery diarrhoea and low @-@ grade fever . Once a child is infected by the virus , there is an incubation period of about two days before symptoms appear . The period of illness is acute . Symptoms often start with vomiting followed by four to eight days of profuse diarrhoea . Dehydration is more common in rotavirus infection than in most of those caused by bacterial pathogens , and is the most common cause of death related to rotavirus infection . 
 Rotavirus A infections can occur throughout life : the first usually produces symptoms , but subsequent infections are typically mild or asymptomatic , as the immune system provides some protection . Consequently , symptomatic infection rates are highest in children under two years of age and decrease progressively towards 45 years of age . Infection in newborn children , although common , is often associated with mild or asymptomatic disease ; the most severe symptoms tend to occur in children six months to two years of age , the elderly , and those with immunodeficiency . Due to immunity acquired in childhood , most adults are not susceptible to rotavirus ; gastroenteritis in adults usually has a cause other than rotavirus , but asymptomatic infections in adults may maintain the transmission of infection in the community . 
 = = Transmission = = 
 Rotavirus is transmitted by the <unk> @-@ oral route , via contact with contaminated hands , surfaces and objects , and possibly by the respiratory route . Viral diarrhea is highly contagious . The faeces of an infected person can contain more than 10 trillion infectious particles per gram ; fewer than 100 of these are required to transmit infection to another person . 
 Rotaviruses are stable in the environment and have been found in estuary samples at levels up to 1 – 5 infectious particles per US gallon , the viruses survive between 9 and 19 days . Sanitary measures adequate for eliminating bacteria and parasites seem to be ineffective in control of rotavirus , as the incidence of rotavirus infection in countries with high and low health standards is similar . 
 = = Disease mechanisms = = 
 The diarrhoea is caused by multiple activities of the virus . <unk> occurs because of the destruction of gut cells called enterocytes . The toxic rotavirus protein NSP4 induces <unk> and calcium ion @-@ dependent chloride secretion , disrupts <unk> transporter @-@ mediated reabsorption of water , apparently reduces activity of brush @-@ border membrane <unk> , and possibly activates the calcium ion @-@ dependent secretory reflexes of the enteric nervous system . Healthy enterocytes secrete lactase into the small intestine ; milk intolerance due to lactase deficiency is a symptom of rotavirus infection , which can persist for weeks . A recurrence of mild diarrhoea often follows the reintroduction of milk into the child 's diet , due to bacterial fermentation of the disaccharide lactose in the gut . 
 = = Diagnosis and detection = = 
 Diagnosis of infection with rotavirus normally follows diagnosis of gastroenteritis as the cause of severe diarrhoea . Most children admitted to hospital with gastroenteritis are tested for rotavirus A. Specific diagnosis of infection with rotavirus A is made by finding the virus in the child 's stool by enzyme immunoassay . There are several licensed test kits on the market which are sensitive , specific and detect all serotypes of rotavirus A. Other methods , such as electron microscopy and PCR , are used in research laboratories . Reverse transcription @-@ polymerase chain reaction ( RT @-@ PCR ) can detect and identify all species and serotypes of human rotavirus . 
 = = Treatment and prognosis = = 
 Treatment of acute rotavirus infection is nonspecific and involves management of symptoms and , most importantly , management of dehydration . If untreated , children can die from the resulting severe dehydration . Depending on the severity of diarrhoea , treatment consists of oral rehydration therapy , during which the child is given extra water to drink that contains small amounts of salt and sugar . In 2004 , the WHO and UNICEF recommended the use of low @-@ osmolarity oral rehydration solution and zinc supplementation as a two @-@ pronged treatment of acute diarrhoea . Some infections are serious enough to warrant hospitalization where fluids are given by intravenous therapy or nasogastric intubation , and the child 's electrolytes and blood sugar are monitored . <unk> have been shown to reduce the duration of rotavirus diarrhoea , and according to the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology " effective interventions include administration of specific probiotics such as Lactobacillus <unk> or Saccharomyces <unk> , <unk> or <unk> . " Rotavirus infections rarely cause other complications and for a well managed child the prognosis is excellent . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 Rotavirus A , which accounts for more than 90 % of rotavirus gastroenteritis in humans , is endemic worldwide . Each year rotavirus causes millions of cases of diarrhoea in developing countries , almost 2 million resulting in hospitalization and an estimated 453 @,@ 000 resulting in the death of a child younger than five , 85 percent of whom live in developing countries . In the United States alone — before initiation of the rotavirus vaccination programme — over 2 @.@ 7 million cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis occurred annually , 60 @,@ 000 children were hospitalised and around 37 died from the results of the infection . The major role of rotavirus in causing diarrhoea is not widely recognised within the public health community , particularly in developing countries . Almost every child has been infected with rotavirus by age five . It is the leading single cause of severe diarrhoea among infants and children , being responsible for about 20 % of cases , and accounts for 50 % of the cases requiring hospitalization . Rotavirus causes 37 % of deaths attributable to diarrhoea and 5 % of all deaths in children younger than five . Boys are twice as likely as girls to be admitted to hospital . Rotavirus infections occur primarily during cool , dry seasons . The number attributable to food contamination is unknown . 
 Outbreaks of rotavirus A diarrhoea are common among hospitalised infants , young children attending day care centres , and elderly people in nursing homes . An outbreak caused by contaminated municipal water occurred in Colorado in 1981 . During 2005 , the largest recorded epidemic of diarrhoea occurred in Nicaragua . This unusually large and severe outbreak was associated with mutations in the rotavirus A genome , possibly helping the virus escape the prevalent immunity in the population . A similar large outbreak occurred in Brazil in 1977 . 
 Rotavirus B , also called adult diarrhoea rotavirus or <unk> , has caused major epidemics of severe diarrhoea affecting thousands of people of all ages in China . These epidemics occurred as a result of sewage contamination of drinking water . Rotavirus B infections also occurred in India in 1998 ; the causative strain was named CAL . Unlike <unk> , the CAL strain is endemic . To date , epidemics caused by rotavirus B have been confined to mainland China , and surveys indicate a lack of immunity to this species in the United States . 
 Rotavirus C has been associated with rare and sporadic cases of diarrhoea in children , and small outbreaks have occurred in families . 
 = = Prevention = = 
 Because improved sanitation does not decrease the prevalence of <unk> disease , and the rate of hospitalizations remains high despite the use of oral rehydrating medicines , the primary public health intervention is vaccination . Two vaccines against Rotavirus A infection are safe and effective in children : Rotarix by GlaxoSmithKline and RotaTeq by Merck . Both are taken orally and contain attenuated live virus . In 2009 , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommended that rotavirus vaccine be included in all national immunisation programmes . The incidence and severity of rotavirus infections has declined significantly in countries that have acted on this recommendation . In Mexico , which in 2006 was among the first countries in the world to introduce rotavirus vaccine , <unk> disease death rates dropped during the 2009 rotavirus season by more than 65 percent among children age two and under . In Nicaragua , which in 2006 became the first developing country to introduce a rotavirus vaccine , severe rotavirus infections were reduced by 40 percent and emergency room visits by a half . In the United States , rotavirus vaccination since 2006 has led to drops in rotavirus @-@ related hospitalizations by as much as 86 percent . The vaccines may also have prevented illness in non @-@ vaccinated children by limiting the number of circulating infections . 
 Rotavirus vaccines are licensed in more than 100 countries , but only 28 countries have introduced routine rotavirus vaccination . Following the introduction of routine rotavirus vaccination in the US in 2006 , the health burden of rotavirus gastroenteritis " rapidly and dramatically reduced " despite lower coverage levels compared to other routine infant immunizations . Clinical trials of the Rotarix rotavirus vaccine in South Africa and Malawi , found that the vaccine significantly reduced severe diarrhoea episodes caused by rotavirus , and that the infection was preventable by vaccination . Safety and efficacy trials of Rotarix and RotaTeq in Africa and Asia found that the vaccines dramatically reduced severe disease among infants in developing countries , where the majority of rotavirus deaths occur . A 2012 Cochrane review of 41 clinical trials that included 186 @,@ 263 participants concluded Rotarix and RotaTeq are effective vaccines . Additional rotavirus vaccines are under development . In September 2013 , the vaccine was offered to all children in the UK , aged between two and three months , and it is expected to halve the cases of severe infection and reduce the number of children admitted to hospital because of the infection by 70 percent . 
 International non @-@ governmental organization PATH , the WHO , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , and the <unk> Alliance are working to bring rotavirus vaccines to developing countries , where children face the greatest burden . Through the Rotavirus Vaccine Program and the Accelerating Vaccine Introduction initiative , these groups are partnering with research institutions and governments to reduce child morbidity and mortality from <unk> disease by making a vaccine against rotavirus available for use in developing countries . 
 = = Infections of other animals = = 
 Rotaviruses infect the young of many species of animals and they are a major cause of diarrhoea in wild and reared animals worldwide . As a pathogen of livestock , notably in young calves and piglets , rotaviruses cause economic loss to farmers because of costs of treatment associated with high morbidity and mortality rates . These rotaviruses are a potential reservoir for genetic exchange with human rotaviruses . There is evidence that animal rotaviruses can infect humans , either by direct transmission of the virus or by contributing one or several RNA segments to <unk> with human strains . 
 = = Virology = = 
 = = = Types of rotavirus = = = 
 There are eight species of rotavirus , referred to as A , B , C , D , E , F , G , and H. Humans are primarily infected by species A , B and C , most commonly by species A. A – E species cause disease in other animals . Within rotavirus A there are different strains , called serotypes . As with influenza virus , a dual classification system is used based on two proteins on the surface of the virus . The glycoprotein VP7 defines the G serotypes and the protease @-@ sensitive protein VP4 defines P serotypes . Because the two genes that determine G @-@ types and P @-@ types can be passed on separately to progeny viruses , different combinations are found . 
 = = = Structure = = = 
 The genome of rotavirus consists of 11 unique double helix molecules of RNA which are 18 @,@ 555 nucleotides in total . Each helix , or segment , is a gene , numbered 1 to 11 by decreasing size . Each gene codes for one protein , except genes 9 , which codes for two . The RNA is surrounded by a three @-@ layered icosahedral protein capsid . Viral particles are up to 76 @.@ 5 nm in diameter and are not enveloped . 
 = = = Proteins = = = 
 There are six viral proteins ( VPs ) that form the virus particle ( virion ) . These structural proteins are called VP1 , VP2 , VP3 , VP4 , VP6 and VP7 . In addition to the VPs , there are six nonstructural proteins ( <unk> ) , that are only produced in cells infected by rotavirus . These are called NSP1 , NSP2 , NSP3 , NSP4 , NSP5 and <unk> . 
 At least six of the twelve proteins encoded by the rotavirus genome bind RNA . The role of these proteins play in rotavirus replication is not entirely understood ; their functions are thought to be related to RNA synthesis and packaging in the virion , mRNA transport to the site of genome replication , and mRNA translation and regulation of gene expression . 
 = = = = Structural proteins = = = = 
 VP1 is located in the core of the virus particle and is an RNA polymerase enzyme . In an infected cell this enzyme produces mRNA transcripts for the synthesis of viral proteins and produces copies of the rotavirus genome RNA segments for newly produced virus particles . 
 VP2 forms the core layer of the virion and binds the RNA genome . 
 VP3 is part of the inner core of the virion and is an enzyme called <unk> transferase . This is a capping enzyme that catalyses the formation of the 5 ' cap in the post @-@ transcriptional modification of mRNA . The cap stabilises viral mRNA by protecting it from nucleic acid degrading enzymes called nucleases . 
 VP4 is on the surface of the virion that protrudes as a spike . It binds to molecules on the surface of cells called receptors and drives the entry of the virus into the cell . VP4 has to be modified by the protease enzyme trypsin , which is found in the gut , into <unk> * and <unk> * before the virus is infectious . VP4 determines how virulent the virus is and it determines the P @-@ type of the virus . 
 VP6 forms the bulk of the capsid . It is highly antigenic and can be used to identify rotavirus species . This protein is used in laboratory tests for rotavirus A infections . 
 VP7 is a glycoprotein that forms the outer surface of the virion . Apart from its structural functions , it determines the G @-@ type of the strain and , along with VP4 , is involved in immunity to infection . 
 = = = = <unk> viral proteins = = = = 
 NSP1 , the product of gene 5 , is a nonstructural RNA @-@ binding protein . NSP1 also blocks the interferon response , the part of the innate immune system that protects cells from viral infection . NSP1 causes the <unk> to degrade key signaling components required to stimulate production of interferon in an infected cell and to respond to interferon secreted by adjacent cells . Targets for degradation include several <unk> transcription factors required for interferon gene transcription . 
 NSP2 is an RNA @-@ binding protein that accumulates in cytoplasmic inclusions ( <unk> ) and is required for genome replication . 
 NSP3 is bound to viral mRNAs in infected cells and it is responsible for the shutdown of cellular protein synthesis . NSP3 inactivates two translation initiation factors essential for synthesis of proteins from host mRNA . First , NSP3 ejects poly ( A ) -binding protein ( <unk> ) from the translation initiation factor <unk> . <unk> is required for efficient translation of transcripts with a 3 ' poly ( A ) tail , which is found on most host cell transcripts . Second , NSP3 inactivates <unk> by stimulating its phosphorylation . Efficient translation of rotavirus mRNA , which lacks the 3 ' poly ( A ) tail , does not require either of these factors . 
 NSP4 is a viral <unk> that induces diarrhoea and was the first viral <unk> discovered . 
 NSP5 is encoded by genome segment 11 of rotavirus A. In virus @-@ infected cells NSP5 accumulates in the <unk> . 
 <unk> is a nucleic acid binding protein and is encoded by gene 11 from an out @-@ of @-@ phase open reading frame . 
 This table is based on the simian rotavirus strain <unk> . RNA @-@ protein coding assignments differ in some strains . 
 = = = Replication = = = 
 Rotaviruses replicate mainly in the gut , and infect enterocytes of the villi of the small intestine , leading to structural and functional changes of the epithelium . The triple protein coats make them resistant to the acidic pH of the stomach and the digestive enzymes in the gut . 
 The virus enter cells by receptor mediated endocytosis and form a vesicle known as an endosome . Proteins in the third layer ( VP7 and the VP4 spike ) disrupt the membrane of the endosome , creating a difference in the calcium concentration . This causes the breakdown of VP7 trimers into single protein subunits , leaving the VP2 and VP6 protein coats around the viral dsRNA , forming a double @-@ layered particle ( DLP ) . 
 The eleven dsRNA strands remain within the protection of the two protein shells and the viral RNA @-@ dependent RNA polymerase creates mRNA transcripts of the double @-@ stranded viral genome . By remaining in the core , the viral RNA evades innate host immune responses called RNA interference that are triggered by the presence of double @-@ stranded RNA . 
 During the infection , rotavirus produces mRNA for both protein biosynthesis and gene replication . Most of the rotavirus proteins accumulate in <unk> , where the RNA is replicated and the DLPs are assembled . <unk> is formed around the cell nucleus as early as two hours after virus infection , and consists of viral factories thought to be made by two viral nonstructural proteins : NSP5 and NSP2 . Inhibition of NSP5 by RNA interference results in a sharp decrease in rotavirus replication .

 In 1943 , Jacob Light and Horace Hodes proved that a filterable agent in the faeces of children with infectious diarrhoea also caused scours ( livestock diarrhoea ) in cattle . Three decades later , preserved samples of the agent were shown to be rotavirus . In the intervening years , a virus in mice was shown to be related to the virus causing scours . In 1973 , Ruth Bishop and colleagues described related viruses found in children with gastroenteritis . 
 In 1974 , Thomas Henry <unk> suggested the name rotavirus after observing that , when viewed through an electron microscope , a rotavirus particle looks like a wheel ( rota in Latin ) ; the name was officially recognised by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses four years later . In 1976 , related viruses were described in several other species of animals . These viruses , all causing acute gastroenteritis , were recognised as a collective pathogen affecting humans and animals worldwide . Rotavirus serotypes were first described in 1980 , and in the following year , rotavirus from humans was first grown in cell cultures derived from monkey kidneys , by adding trypsin ( an enzyme found in the duodenum of mammals and now known to be essential for rotavirus to replicate ) to the culture medium . The ability to grow rotavirus in culture accelerated the pace of research , and by the mid @-@ 1980s the first candidate vaccines were being evaluated . 
 In 1998 , a rotavirus vaccine was licensed for use in the United States . Clinical trials in the United States , Finland , and Venezuela had found it to be 80 to 100 % effective at preventing severe diarrhoea caused by rotavirus A , and researchers had detected no statistically significant serious adverse effects . The manufacturer , however , withdrew it from the market in 1999 , after it was discovered that the vaccine may have contributed to an increased risk for <unk> , a type of bowel obstruction , in one of every 12 @,@ 000 vaccinated infants . The experience provoked intense debate about the relative risks and benefits of a rotavirus vaccine . In 2006 , two new vaccines against rotavirus A infection were shown to be safe and effective in children , and in June 2009 the World Health Organization recommended that rotavirus vaccination be included in all national immunisation programmes to provide protection against this virus . 
 In 2015 , India unveiled a cheaper vaccine with support of US National Institute of Health . 
 = The Historian = 
 The Historian is the 2005 debut novel of American author Elizabeth Kostova . The plot blends the history and folklore of Vlad Țepeș and his fictional equivalent Count Dracula . Kostova 's father told her stories about Dracula when she was a child , and later in life she was inspired to turn the experience into a novel . She worked on the book for ten years and then sold it within a few months to Little , Brown and Company , which bought it for US $ 2 million . 
 The Historian has been described as a combination of genres , including Gothic novel , adventure novel , detective fiction , travelogue , postmodern historical novel , epistolary epic , and historical thriller . Kostova was intent on writing a serious work of literature and saw herself as an inheritor of the Victorian style . Although based in part on Bram Stoker 's Dracula , The Historian is not a horror novel , but rather an eerie tale . It is concerned with history 's role in society and representation in books , as well as the nature of good and evil . As Kostova explains , " Dracula is a metaphor for the evil that is so hard to undo in history . " The evils brought about by religious conflict are a particular theme , and the novel explores the relationship between the Christian West and the Islamic East . 
 Little , Brown and Company heavily promoted the book and it became the first debut novel to become number one on The New York Times bestseller list in its first week on sale . As of 2005 , it was the fastest @-@ selling hardback debut novel in U.S. history . In general , the novel received mixed reviews . While some praised the book 's description of the setting , others criticized its structure and lack of tonal variety . Kostova received the 2006 Book Sense award for Best Adult Fiction and the 2005 Quill Award for Debut Author of the Year . Sony has bought the film rights and , as of 2007 , was planning an adaptation . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 The Historian interweaves the history and folklore of Vlad Țepeș , a 15th @-@ century prince of Wallachia known as " Vlad the Impaler " , and his fictional equivalent Count Dracula together with the story of Paul , a professor ; his 16 @-@ year @-@ old daughter ; and their quest for Vlad 's tomb . The novel ties together three separate narratives using letters and oral accounts : that of Paul 's mentor in the 1930s , that of Paul in the 1950s , and that of the narrator herself in the 1970s . The tale is told primarily from the perspective of Paul 's daughter , who is never named . 
 = = = Part I = = = 
 Part I opens in 1972 Amsterdam . The narrator finds an old vellum @-@ bound book with a woodcut of a dragon in the center associated with Dracula . When she asks her father Paul about it , he tells her how he found the handmade book in his study carrel when he was a graduate student in the 1950s . Paul took the book to his mentor , Professor Bartholomew Rossi , and was shocked to find that Rossi had found a similar handmade book when he was a graduate student in the 1930s . As a result , Rossi researched Țepeș , the Dracula myth surrounding him , and the mysterious book . Rossi traveled as far as Istanbul ; however , the appearance of curious characters and unexplained events caused him to drop his investigation and return to his graduate work . Rossi gives Paul his research notes and informs him that he believes Dracula is still alive . 
 The bulk of the novel focuses on the 1950s timeline , which follows Paul 's adventures . After meeting with Paul , Rossi disappears ; smears of blood on his desk and the ceiling of his office are the only traces that remain . Certain that something unfortunate has befallen his advisor , Paul begins to investigate Dracula . While in the university library he meets a young , dark @-@ haired woman reading a copy of Bram Stoker 's Dracula . She is Helen Rossi , the daughter of Bartholomew Rossi , and she has become an expert on Dracula . Paul attempts to convince her that one of the librarians is trying to prevent their research into Dracula , but she is <unk> . Later , the librarian attacks and bites Helen . Paul intervenes and overpowers him , but he wriggles free . The librarian is then run over by a car in front of the library and apparently killed . 
 Upon hearing her father 's story , the narrator becomes interested in the mystery and begins researching Dracula as she and her father travel across Europe during the 1970s . Although he eventually sends her home , she does not remain there . After finding letters addressed to her that reveal he has left on a quest to find her mother ( previously believed to be dead ) , she sets out to find him . As is slowly made clear in the novel , Helen is the narrator 's mother . The letters continue the story her father has been telling her . The narrator decides to travel to a monastery where she believes her father might be . 
 = = = Part II = = = 
 Part II begins as the narrator reads descriptions of her father and Helen 's travels through Eastern Europe during the 1950s . While on their travels , Helen and Paul conclude that Rossi might have been taken by Dracula to his tomb . They travel to Istanbul to find the archives of Sultan Mehmed II , which Paul believes contain information regarding the location of the tomb . They fortuitously meet Professor Turgut Bora from Istanbul University , who has also discovered a book similar to Paul 's and Rossi 's . He has access to Mehmed 's archive , and together they unearth several important documents . They also see the librarian who was supposedly killed in the United States – he has survived because he is a vampire and he has continued following Helen and Paul . Helen shoots the vampire librarian but misses his heart and consequently , he does not die . 
 From Istanbul , Paul and Helen travel to Budapest , Hungary , to further investigate the location of Dracula 's tomb and to meet with Helen 's mother , who they believe may have knowledge of Rossi – the two had met during his travels to Romania in the 1930s . For the first time Helen hears of her mother and Rossi 's torrid love affair . Paul and Helen learn much , for example that Helen 's mother , and therefore Helen herself and the narrator , are descendants of Vlad Țepeș . 
 = = = Part III = = = 
 Part III begins with a revelation by Turgut Bora that leads the search for Dracula 's tomb to Bulgaria . He also reveals that he is part of an organization formed by Sultan Mehmed II from the elite of the Janissaries to fight the Order of the Dragon , an evil consortium later associated with Dracula . In Bulgaria , Helen and Paul seek the assistance of a scholar named Anton <unk> . Through information gained from <unk> , Helen and Paul discover that Dracula is most likely buried in the Bulgarian monastery of Sveti Georgi . 
 After many difficulties Paul and Helen discover the whereabouts of Sveti Georgi . Upon reaching the monastery they find Rossi 's interred body in the crypt and are forced to drive a silver dagger through his heart to prevent his full transformation into a vampire . Before he dies , he reveals that Dracula is a scholar and has a secret library . Rossi has written an account of his imprisonment in this library and hidden it there . Paul and Helen are pursued to the monastery by political officials and by the vampire librarian – all of them are seeking Dracula 's tomb , but it is empty when they arrive . 
 Paul and Helen move to the United States , marry , and Helen gives birth to the narrator . However , she becomes depressed a few months afterwards . She later confesses that she feared the taint of the vampiric bite that she acquired earlier would infect her child . The family travels to Europe in an attempt to cheer her up . When they visit the monastery Saint @-@ Matthieu @-@ des @-@ Pyrénées @-@ Orientales , Helen feels Dracula 's presence and is compelled to jump off a cliff . Landing on grass , she survives and decides to hunt him down and kill him in order to rid herself of his threat and her fears . 
 When the narrator arrives at Saint @-@ Matthieu @-@ des @-@ Pyrénées @-@ Orientales , she finds her father . Individuals mentioned throughout the 1970s timeline converge in a final attempt to defeat Dracula . He is seemingly killed by a silver bullet fired into his heart by Helen . 
 In the epilogue , which takes place in 2008 , the narrator attends a conference of medievalists in Philadelphia , and stops at a library with an extensive collection of material related to Dracula . She accidentally leaves her notes and the attendant rushes out and returns them to her , as well as a book with a dragon printed in the center , revealing that either Dracula is still alive or one of his minions is imitating the master .

 = = = Biographical background = = = 
 Kostova 's interest in the Dracula legend began with the stories her father told her about the vampire when she was a child . The family moved from the U.S. to Ljubljana , Slovenia in 1972 , while her father was teaching for a year at a local university . During that year , the family traveled across Europe . According to Kostova , " It was the formative experience of my childhood . " She " was fascinated by [ her father 's Dracula stories ] because they were ... from history in a way , even though they weren 't about real history , but I heard them in these beautiful historic places . " Kostova 's interest in books and libraries began early as well . Her mother , a librarian , frequently took her and her sisters to the public library – they were each allowed to check out 30 books and had a special shelf for their library books . 
 She listened to recordings of Balkan folk music as a child and became interested in the tradition . Later , she sang in and directed a Slavic chorus while an undergraduate at Yale University . She and some friends traveled to Eastern Europe in 1989 , specifically Bulgaria and Bosnia , to study local musical customs . The recordings they made will be deposited in the Library of Congress . While Kostova was in Europe , the Berlin Wall collapsed , heralding the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe , events which shaped her understanding of history . 
 = = = Composition and publication = = = 
 Five years later , in 1994 , when Kostova was hiking in the Appalachian Mountains with her husband , she had a flashback to those storytelling moments with her father and asked herself " what if the father were spinning his Dracula tales to his entranced daughter and Dracula were listening in ? What if Dracula were still alive ? " She immediately scratched out seven pages of notes into her writer 's notebook . Two days later , she started work on the novel . At the time she was teaching English as a second language , creative writing and composition classes at universities in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . She moved to Ann Arbor , Michigan , entered the writing program at the University of Michigan and finished the book as she was obtaining her Master of Fine Arts degree . 
 Kostova did extensive research about Eastern Europe and Vlad Țepeș . She found a vampire @-@ killing kit at the Mercer Museum , which included a pistol , silver bullets , a crucifix , a wooden stake , and powdered garlic . 
 As she was writing , she posted maps of Eastern Europe in her office and constructed a chart to help her keep track of the book 's timelines . Her husband , whom she had met in Bulgaria , assisted her with related geographical descriptions and diction . It took her ten years to finish the novel . 
 Kostova finished the novel in January 2004 and sent it to a potential literary agent in March . Two months later and within two days of sending out her manuscript to publishers , Kostova was offered a deal – she refused it . The rights to the book were auctioned off and Little , Brown and Company bought them for US $ 2 million ( US $ 30 @,@ 000 is typical for a first novel from an unknown author ) . Publishers Weekly explained the high price as a result of a bidding war between firms ' believing that they might have the next Da Vinci Code within their grasp . One vice @-@ president and associate publisher said , " Given the success of The Da Vinci Code , everybody around town knows how popular the combination of thriller and history can be and what a phenomenon it can become . " Little , Brown and Company subsequently sold the rights in 28 countries . The book was published in the United States on 14 June 2005 . 
 = = Genre and style = = 
 The Historian has been described as a combination of genres , including the Gothic novel , the adventure novel , the detective novel , the travelogue , the postmodern historical novel , the epistolary epic , and the historical thriller . 
 Kostova wanted to write a serious literary novel , with scholarly heroes , that was at the same time reminiscent of 19th @-@ century adventures . She was inspired by Victorian writers such as Wilkie Collins ; his novel The Moonstone ( 1868 ) , with its plot twists and bevy of narrators , was " a major model " . The primary literary ancestor of The Historian , however , is Bram Stoker 's Dracula ( 1897 ) . For example , in The Historian and Dracula , the protagonist is both fascinated and repulsed by Dracula . Both are told through a series of letters and memoirs . The Historian also includes many intertextual references to Stoker 's work – Dracula even owns a copy of the novel . Yet , Kostova shapes Dracula into her own character . While Stoker 's vampire is the focus of his novel , Kostova 's is at the edges . Moreover , the blend of the fictional Dracula and the historical Vlad " adds a sinister and frightening edge " to the character , according to scholar Stine Fletcher . 
 Despite its Gothic roots , The Historian is not suffused with violence nor is it a horror novel . Kostova aimed to write a " chilling " Victorian ghost story , and her realistic style is what creates this effect . Marlene Arpe of The Toronto Star praises Kostova 's imagery in particular , quoting the following passage : 
 A smell rose from its pages that was not merely the delicate scent of aging paper and cracked vellum . It was a reek of decay , a terrible , sickening odor , a smell of old meat or corrupted flesh . I had never noticed it before and I leaned closer , sniffing , <unk> , then shut the book . I reopened it , after a moment , and again stomach @-@ churning fumes arose from its pages . The little volume seemed alive in my hands , yet it smelled like death . 
 As Peter <unk> explains in The Boston Globe , " Instead of <unk> blood , Kostova <unk> documents ( manuscripts , maps , letters ) and the places that house them ( libraries , archives and monasteries ) . " As one critic explains , " the real horror rests in the possibility of what Dracula truly is " . For example , the narrator comments : 
 The thing that most haunted me that day , however , as I closed my notebook and put my coat on to go home , was not my ghostly image of Dracula , or the description of impalement , but the fact that these things had – apparently – actually occurred . If I listened too closely , I thought , I would hear the screams of the boys , of the ' large family ' dying together . For all his attention to my historical education , my father had neglected to tell me this : history 's terrible moments were real . I understand now , decades later , that he could never have told me . Only history itself can convince you of such a truth . And once you 've seen that truth – really seen it – you can 't look away . 
 The novel 's tone and structure place it within the serious literary tradition for which Kostova was aiming . For example , the alternating timelines are suggestive of A. S. Byatt 's Possession ( 1990 ) and the intermingling of academia and the occult suggests Arturo Perez @-@ <unk> 's The Club Dumas ( 1993 ) . Although many reviewers compared The Historian to Dan Brown 's historical thriller The Da Vinci Code ( 2003 ) , Kostova has said her book " is part of a tradition where literary craft and experiments in form are all as important as action ... the only overlap is this idea of people searching for something in history . I 'm still surprised when people make this comparison , I 'm very grateful my publisher has never pushed it . " Moreover , the only real historical personage in her novel is Vlad Țepeș and she changed the name of some locations " fearing some readers might confuse fantasy and reality , as they have with Brown 's novels " . 
 Reviewers praised Kostova 's lush descriptions of the setting and the fascinating European cities and countries which the story traverses : Amsterdam , Slovenia , Romania , Bulgaria , Turkey , France , Oxford , Switzerland and Italy . 
 = = Themes = = 
 History and questions about its role in society pervade The Historian . In particular , the novel argues that knowledge of history is power , particularly as it is written in books . The title can refer to any of the major characters , including Dracula . As Nancy Baker explains in The Globe and Mail , the novel is " about the love of books " and the knowledge and comfort they offer the characters – even Dracula himself is a bibliophile . As one critic explains , the novel is specifically about the love of scholarship . At the heart of the novel is an exploration of " the power and price of scholarly obsession " . As Paul explains in the novel : 
 It is a fact that we historians are interested in what is partly a reflection of ourselves we would rather not examine except through the medium of scholarship ; it is also true that as we steep ourselves in our interests , they become more and more a part of us . Visiting an American university ... I was introduced to one of the first of the great American historians of Nazi Germany . He lived in a comfortable house at the edge of the campus , where he collected not only books on his topic but also the official china of the Third Reich . His dogs , two enormous German shepherds , patrolled the front yard day and night . Over drinks with other faculty members , he told me in no uncertain terms how he despised Hitler 's crimes and wanted to expose them in the greatest possible detail to the outside world . I left the party early , walking carefully past those big dogs , unable to shake my revulsion . 
 The novel explores questions of good and evil and as Jessica Treadway states in The Chicago Tribune , it " is intriguing for its thorough examination of what constitutes evil and why it exists " . For example , Dracula at one point asks Rossi : 
 History has taught us that the nature of man is evil , sublimely so . Good is not <unk> , but evil is . Why should you not use your great mind in service of what is <unk> ? ... There is no purity like the purity of the sufferings of history . You will have what every historian wants : history will be reality to you . We will wash our minds clean with blood . 
 As Kostova explains , " Dracula is a metaphor for the evil that is so hard to undo in history . " For example , he is shown influencing Eastern European tyrants and supporting national socialism in Transylvania . He is " vainglorious , vindictive , [ and ] vicious " . As Michael Dirda explains in The Washington Post , the novel conveys the idea that " Most of history 's worst nightmares result from an unthinking obedience to authority , high @-@ minded zealotry seductively overriding our mere humanity . " It is in the figure of the vampire that Kostova reveals this , since " our fear of Dracula lies in the fear of losing ourselves , of relinquishing our very identities as human beings " . In fact , the narrator is never named in the novel , suggesting , as one critic explains , " that the quest for the dark side of human nature is more universal than specific to a concrete character " . 
 Religion is also a dominant theme of The Historian . Dracula is Christian and , as <unk> explains , " Much of what is frightening in the novel is the suggestion of heretical Christian practices and conspiratorial monks . " Kostova herself notes that the world is still " wracked by religious conflict " , therefore historical fiction about the topic is relevant . The portions of the novel set in Istanbul , for example , highlight the extent to which the real Vlad detested the Ottomans , waging holy war upon them . More specifically , Amir Taheri in Asharq <unk> argues that the novel highlights the relationship between the West and Turkey . The West , which is laden with the " dead " weight of this past ( represented by the vampires ) needs the help of Turkey ( and perhaps the entire Muslim world ) to recover . As Taheri points out , one of the most appealing characters in the novel is Professor Bora , a Turkish professor who is part of an ancient Ottoman society dedicated to defeating Dracula . Taheri emphasizes that the novel highlights that " Western civilisation and Islam have common enemies represented by ' vampires ' such as postmodernism in Europe and obscurantism in the Muslim world " .

 Little , Brown and Company spent $ 500 @,@ 000 heavily promoting The Historian . In what Publishers Weekly called a " carefully calibrated advertising campaign " , 7 @,@ 000 advance copies were sent to booksellers , and in January 2005 Kostova began her book promotion tour six months before the novel 's publication . She met with book retailers who , impressed with her presentation , bought large numbers of the book . As an article in The Age explains , " By the time it arrived in the bookstores , The Historian had already made the news several times " . As soon as the book was published in June , Kostova went on a 15 @-@ city tour , including book signings and readings , which prompted further media reports on it . She appeared on ABC 's Good Morning America on 28 June , and there were stories about the novel in USA Today , Entertainment Weekly and Newsweek . Kostova was billed as the next literary phenomenon , the next Alice Sebold or Susanna Clarke . 
 The Historian was the first debut novel to land at number one on The New York Times bestseller list in its first week on sale , and as of 2005 was the fastest @-@ selling hardback debut novel in U.S. history . The book sold more copies on its first day in print than The Da Vinci Code – 70 @,@ 000 copies were sold in the first week alone . As of the middle of August 2005 , the novel had already sold 915 @,@ 000 copies in the U.S. and had gone through six printings . ( For comparison , according to Publishers Weekly , only ten fiction books sold more than 800 @,@ 000 hardcover copies in the US in 2004 . ) Little , Brown and Company also released an edition of Dracula in September 2005 with an introduction by Kostova , thinking her readers would want to delve into the original novel after reading hers . Kostova is one of the few female bestselling authors , but her popularity is unusual because it is founded on a literary novel . 
 Reviews of the novel were " at best , mixed " . Several reviewers noted that Kostova described the setting of her novel well ; Laura Miller of Salon.com , for example , wrote that " Kostova has a genius for evoking places " . Malcolm Jones of Newsweek wrote that the novel was " strikingly fresh and <unk> " . Baker praised Kostova 's prose , saying that it " has a leisurely grace " . Francis Atkinson of The Age praised the " Gothic sensuality " of the novel . However , some thought the book was too long , or criticized Kostova 's lack of tonal variety ; Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times that the book was " ponderous " and had a " contorted narrative structure " . Jane Stevenson of The Observer agreed , noting that the multiple timelines and narrators of the novel were not sufficiently differentiated . Several reviewers complained that the climax of the novel was a disappointment and that Dracula was not terrifying . 
 According to Paul <unk> of The News @-@ Gazette , the novel 's fundamental weakness is that after the slow buildup , " there is a final shying away from a full rendering of the nature of the beast . ... there 's a curious holding back here as elsewhere from a really probing look at the seductive appeal of vampirism , particularly the sensuality at its core . " Susanna Sturgis , agreed , writing in the Women 's Review of Books that the plot dragged and that " the reader loses interest " in the core mysteries of the novel . Ong Sor Fern of The Straits Times criticized Kostova 's portrayal of women , writing that her unnamed female narrator " feels even more drab and colourless than Stoker 's idealised female , Mina Harker " . Sturgis criticized Kostova 's characterization in general , contending that the major characters seemed more like " disembodied tour guides " . Polly Shulman of Newsday also argued that the book " fail [ s ] to grapple with its supposed themes : evil , death and history " . She saw " little of the terror of these periods " in the novel and little of the tension between the Islamic East and the Christian West .

 The 12 @-@ hour abridged audio book , released by Time Warner , is narrated by six different actors ( Joanne Whalley , Martin Jarvis , Dennis <unk> , Jim Ward , Rosalyn Landor and Robin Atkin Downes ) . <unk> ' voicing of Paul has been called " flat " while Publishers Weekly complained that it was " nonchalant and impersonal " . They also singled out the voicing of Dracula for criticism , writing that " his accent and delivery is exactly the stereotypical vampire voice used by everyone from Bela Lugosi to Sesame Street 's the Count " . There is swelling orchestral music at the beginning and end of each chapter , of which the reviewers approved . 
 The 26 @-@ hour unabridged audio book , released by Books on Tape ( a division of Random House ) , is narrated by Justine Eyre and Paul Michael . According to Booklist , they " do an incredible job voicing an array of characters with European accents ranging from Dutch , French , and German " .

 = Roger Miller = 
 Roger Dean Miller , Sr. ( January 2 , 1936 – October 25 , 1992 ) was an American singer , songwriter , musician and actor , best known for his honky @-@ tonk @-@ influenced novelty songs . His most recognized tunes included the chart @-@ topping country / pop hits " King of the Road " , " Dang Me " and " England Swings " , all from the mid @-@ 1960s Nashville sound era . 
 After growing up in Oklahoma and serving in the United States Army , Miller began his musical career as a songwriter in the late 1950s , penning such hits as " Billy Bayou " and " Home " for Jim Reeves and " Invitation to the Blues " for Ray Price . He later began a recording career and reached the peak of his fame in the mid @-@ 1960s , continuing to record and tour into the 1990s , charting his final top 20 country hit " Old Friends " with Willie Nelson in 1982 . Later in his life , he wrote the music and lyrics for the 1985 Tony @-@ award winning Broadway musical Big River , in which he acted . 
 Miller died from lung cancer in 1992 , and was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame three years later . His songs continued to be recorded by younger artists , with covers of " Tall , Tall Trees " by Alan Jackson and " Husbands and Wives " by Brooks & Dunn , each reaching the number one spot on country charts in the 1990s . The Roger Miller Museum in his home town of Erick , Oklahoma , is a tribute to Miller . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Roger Miller was born in Fort Worth , Texas , the third son of Jean and <unk> ( Holt ) Miller . Jean Miller died from spinal meningitis when Roger was a year old . Unable to support the family during the Great Depression , <unk> sent her three sons to live with three of Jean 's brothers . Thus , Roger grew up on a farm outside Erick , Oklahoma with Elmer and <unk> Miller . 
 As a boy , Miller did farm work , such as picking cotton and plowing . He would later say he was " dirt poor " and that as late as 1951 the family did not own a telephone . He received his primary education at a one @-@ room schoolhouse . Miller was an introverted child , and would often daydream or compose songs . One of his earliest compositions went : " There 's a picture on the wall . It 's the dearest of them all , Mother . " 
 Miller was a member of the National FFA Organization in high school . He listened to the Grand Ole Opry and Light Crust Doughboys on a Fort Worth station with his cousin 's husband , <unk> Wooley . Wooley taught Miller his first guitar chords and bought him a fiddle . Wooley , Hank Williams , and Bob Wills were the influences that led to Miller 's desire to be a singer @-@ songwriter . He began to run away and perform in Oklahoma and Texas . At 17 , he stole a guitar out of desperation to write songs ; however , he turned himself in the next day . He chose to enlist in the United States Army to avoid jail . He later quipped , " My education was Korea , Clash of ' 52 . " Near the end of his military service , while stationed in Atlanta , Georgia , Miller played fiddle in the " Circle A Wranglers , " a military musical group started by Faron Young . While Miller was stationed in South Carolina , an army sergeant whose brother was Kenneth C. " Jethro " Burns from the musical duo Homer and Jethro , persuaded him to head to Nashville after his discharge .

 = = = Nashville songwriter = = = 
 On leaving the Army , Miller traveled to Nashville to begin his musical career . He met with Chet Atkins , who asked to hear him sing , loaning him a guitar since Miller did not own one . Out of nervousness , Miller played the guitar and sang a song in two different keys . Atkins advised him to come back later , when he had more experience . Miller found work as a bellhop at Nashville 's Andrew Jackson Hotel , and he was soon known as the " singing bellhop , " He was finally hired by Minnie Pearl to play the fiddle in her band . He then met George Jones , who introduced him to music executives from the <unk> Records label , who scheduled an audition . The executives were impressed and set up a recording session with Jones in Houston . Jones and Miller collaborated to write " Tall , Tall Trees " and " Happy Child . " 
 After marrying and becoming a father , Miller put aside his music career and became a fireman in Amarillo , Texas . A fireman by day , he performed at night . Miller said that during his time as a fireman , he saw only two fires , one in a " chicken coop " and the other that he " slept through , " after which the department " suggested that ... [ he ] seek other employment . " Miller met Ray Price , and became a member of his Cherokee Cowboys . He returned to Nashville , and wrote " Invitation to the Blues , " which was covered by Rex Allen and later by Ray Price , whose recording was a number three hit on country charts . Miller then signed with Tree Publishing on a salary of $ 50 a week . He wrote : " Half a Mind " for Ernest Tubb , " That 's the Way I Feel " for Faron Young ; and his first number one , " Billy Bayou , " which along with " Home " were recorded by Jim Reeves . Miller became one of the biggest songwriters of the 1950s . However , Bill Anderson would later remark that " Roger was the most talented , and least disciplined , person that you could imagine " citing the attempts of Miller 's Tree Publishing boss , Buddy Killen to force him to finish a piece . He was known to give away lines , inciting many Nashville songwriters to follow him around since , according to Killen , " everything he said was a potential song . "

 Miller signed a recording deal with Decca Records in 1958 . He was paired with singer Donny Lytle , who later gained fame under the name Johnny Paycheck , to perform the Miller @-@ penned " A Man Like Me " , and later " The Wrong Kind of Girl . " Both songs were honky @-@ tonk @-@ style and did not chart . His second single with the label , featuring the B @-@ side " Jason Fleming , " foreshadowed Miller 's future style . To make money , Miller went on tour with Faron Young 's band as a drummer , although he had never drummed . During this period , he signed a record deal with Chet Atkins at RCA Victor , for whom Miller recorded " You Don 't Want My Love " ( also known as " In the Summertime " ) in 1960 , which marked his first appearance on country charts , peaking at No. 14 . The next year , he would make an even bigger impact , breaking through the top 10 with his single " When Two Worlds Collide " , co @-@ written with Bill Anderson . But Miller soon tired of writing songs , divorced his wife and began a party lifestyle that earned him the moniker " wild child . " He was dropped from his record label and began to pursue other interests . 
 After numerous appearances on late night comedy shows , Miller decided that he might have a chance in Hollywood as an actor . Short of money , he signed with the up @-@ and @-@ coming label Smash Records , asked the label for $ 1 @,@ 600 in cash , in exchange for recording 16 sides . Smash agreed to the proposal , and Miller performed his first session for the company early in 1964 , when he recorded the hits " Dang Me " and " Chug @-@ a @-@ Lug " . Both were released as singles , peaking at No. 1 and No. 3 respectively on country charts ; both fared well on the Billboard Hot 100 reaching No. 7 and No. 9 . The songs transformed Miller 's career , although the former was penned by Miller in just four minutes . Later that year , he recorded the No. 15 hit " Do @-@ <unk> @-@ Do , " and soon after the biggest hit of his career " King of the Road " , which topped Country and Adult Contemporary charts while peaking at No. 4 on the Billboard 100 . The song was inspired by a sign in Chicago that read " Trailers for Sale or Rent " and a hobo happened upon by Miller at an airport in Boise , but took months for Miller to write . The song was certified gold in May 1965 after selling a million copies . It won numerous awards , and earned a royalty check of $ 160 @,@ 000 that summer . Later in the year Miller scored hits with " Engine Engine No. 9 " , " Kansas City Star " ( a Top Ten country hit in 1965 about a local television children 's show personality who would rather stay in the safety and security of his success in Kansas City rather than become a bigger star – or risk failure – in Omaha ) and " England Swings " ( an adult contemporary No. 1 ) . He began 1966 with the hit " Husbands and Wives . " 
 Miller was given his own TV show on NBC in September 1966 but it was canceled after 13 weeks in January 1967 . During this period Miller recorded songs written by other songwriters . The final hit of his own composition was " Walkin in the Sunshine , " which reached No. 7 and No. 6 on the country and adult contemporary charts in 1967 . Later in the year he scored his final top 10 hit with a <unk> cover of Bobby Russell 's " Little Green Apples " . The next year , he was first to cover Kris Kristofferson 's " Me and Bobby McGee , " taking the song to No. 12 on country charts . In 1970 , Miller recorded the album A Trip in the Country , honky @-@ tonk @-@ style standards penned by Miller , including " Tall , Tall Trees . " Later that year , after Smash Records folded , Miller was signed by Columbia Records , for whom he released Dear Folks : Sorry I Haven 't Written Lately in 1973 . Later that year , Miller wrote and performed three songs in the Walt Disney animated feature Robin Hood as the rooster / minstrel Allan @-@ a @-@ Dale , including " Whistle @-@ Stop " which was sampled for use in the popular Hampster Dance web site . The other songs are Oo @-@ De @-@ Lally and Not In Nottingham . He provided the voice of <unk> , the equine narrator of the Rankin / Bass holiday special Nestor the Long @-@ <unk> Christmas Donkey in 1978 . Miller collaborated with Willie Nelson on an album titled Old Friends . The title track was based on a song he had previously penned for his family in Oklahoma . The song , with guest vocals from Ray Price , was the last hit of Miller 's career , peaking at No. 19 on country charts in 1982 . 
 = = = Late career = = = 
 He continued to record for different record labels and charted a few songs , but stopped writing in 1978 , feeling that his more " artistic " works were not appreciated . This was the time when his only visit to England led him to Kippax , he played the social club there but was outdone by 17 Elvis performers . He was absent from the entertainment business following the release of Old Friends in 1981 , but returned after receiving an offer to write a Broadway score for a musical based upon Mark Twain 's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn . Although he had not read the novel , Miller accepted the offer after discovering how the story brought him back to his childhood in rural Oklahoma . It took a year and a half to write the opening , but he eventually finished . The work , entitled Big River premiered at Eugene O 'Neill Theatre in New York on April 25 , 1985 . The musical received glowing reviews , earning seven Tony Awards including " Best Score " for Miller . He acted the part of Huck Finn 's father Pap for three months after the exit of actor John Goodman , who left for Hollywood . In 1983 , Miller played a dramatic role on an episode of Quincy ME . He played a country and western singer who is severely burned while <unk> cocaine . 
 Miller left for Santa Fe to live with his family following the success of Big River . He co @-@ wrote Dwight Yoakam 's hit " It Only Hurts When I Cry " from his 1990 album If There Was a Way , and supplied background vocals . The song was released as a single in 1991 , peaking at No. 7 on country charts . He began a solo guitar tour in 1990 , ending the following year after being diagnosed with lung cancer . His last performance on television occurred on a special tribute to Minnie Pearl which aired on TNN on October 26 , 1992 , the day after Miller 's death . 
 = = Style = = 
 Although he is usually grouped with country music singers , Miller 's unique style defies easy classification . Many of his recordings were humorous novelty songs with whimsical lyrics , coupled with scat singing or vocalese riffs filled with nonsense syllables . Others were sincere ballads , which caught the public 's fancy , none more so than his signature song , " King of the Road . " The biographical book Ain 't Got No Cigarettes described Miller as an " <unk> talent " , and stated that many regarded him as a genius . 
 On his own style , Miller remarked that he " tried to do " things like other artists but that it " always came out different " so he got " frustrated " until realizing " I 'm the only one that knows what I 'm thinking . " He commented that the favorite song that he wrote was " You Can 't <unk> in a Buffalo Herd . " Johnny Cash discussed Miller 's bass vocal range in his 1997 autobiography . He commented that it was the closest to his own that he had heard . 
 = = Personal life and death = = 
 Miller was married three times , and fathered seven children . Miller 's first wife Barbara bore his first child , Michael , who later died . The couple had three more children subsequent to Michael 's death — Alan , Rhonda and Shari . By the time Shari was born , Miller 's career was blossoming into national popularity . The family remained in Inglewood for a short time after Miller found fame . The increasing interest in Miller caused struggles for the performer : He suffered from depression and insomnia , and had a drug addiction which contributed to the end of his first and second marriages . Miller was known to walk off shows and to fight . 
 After the divorce from his first wife , he married Leah Kendrick . She gave birth to two children , Shannon and Dean Miller , who like his father , went on to become a singer @-@ songwriter . The Christmas song " Old Toy Trains " was written by Miller about his son , who was two years old when it was released in 1967 . 
 After divorcing Leah , Miller married Mary Arnold , whom he met through Kenny Rogers . Arnold was a member of The First Edition , a band that included Rogers . They adopted two children : Taylor and Adam . After the break @-@ up of The First Edition , she performed with her husband Miller on tours , including a White House performance for President Gerald Ford . In 2009 , she was inducted into the Iowa Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame , She currently manages Roger Miller 's estate . She sued Sony for copyright infringement in the 2007 case Roger Miller Music , Inc. v. Sony / ATV Publishing , LLC , which went to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit . Arnold was ultimately awarded nearly $ 1 million in royalties and rights to the songs Miller wrote in 1964 . 
 Miller was a lifelong cigarette smoker . During a television interview , Miller explained that he composed his songs from " bits and pieces " of ideas he wrote on scraps of paper . When asked what he did with the unused bits and pieces , he half @-@ joked , " I smoke ' em ! " Miller died of lung and throat cancer in 1992 , at age 56 , shortly after the discovery of a malignant tumor under his vocal cords . His remains were cremated . 
 A main street in Erick , Oklahoma was named Roger Miller Boulevard in his memory .

 = Upnor Castle = 
 Upnor Castle is an Elizabethan artillery fort located on the west bank of the River Medway in Kent . It is in the village of Upnor , opposite and a short distance downriver from the Chatham Dockyard , at one time a key naval facility . The fort was intended to protect both the dockyard and ships of the Royal Navy anchored in the Medway . It was constructed between 1559 – 67 on the orders of Elizabeth I , during a period of tension with Spain and other European powers . The castle consists of a two @-@ storeyed main building protected by a curtain wall and towers , with a triangular gun platform projecting into the river . It was garrisoned by about 80 men with a peak armament of around 20 cannon of various calibres . 
 Despite its strategic importance , the castle and the defences of the Thames and Medway were badly neglected during the 17th century . The Dutch Republic mounted an unexpected naval raid in June 1667 , and the Dutch fleet was able to breach the defences , capturing two warships and burning others at anchor in the river at Chatham , in one of the worst defeats suffered by the Royal Navy . Upnor Castle acquitted itself better than many of the other defensive sites along the upper Medway , despite its lack of provisioning . Gun fire from the fort and from adjoining emplacements forced a Dutch retreat after a couple of days , before they were able to burn the dockyard itself . 
 The raid exposed the weaknesses of the Medway defences and led to the castle losing its role as an artillery fortification . New and stronger forts were built further downriver over the following two centuries , culminating in the construction of massive casemated forts such as Garrison Point Fort , Hoo , and <unk> Forts . Upnor Castle became a naval ammunition depot , storing great quantities of gunpowder , ammunition , and cannon to replenish the warships that came to Chatham for repair and resupply . It remained in military use until as late as 1945 . The castle was subsequently opened to the public and is now an English Heritage property . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Strategic context = = = 
 The River Medway is a major tributary of the Thames , merging at an estuary about 35 miles ( 56 km ) east of London . Its upper reaches from Rochester to the confluence with the Thames at Sheerness meander between sand and mud banks for about 10 miles ( 16 km ) . The water flows slowly without strong currents and is free of rocks , while the surrounding hills provide shelter from the south @-@ west wind . These characteristics made the section of the river below Rochester Bridge a desirable anchorage for large ships , as they could be anchored safely and grounded for repairs . The complexity of the channel 's navigation also provided it with defensive advantages . 
 During Henry VIII 's reign , the upper Medway gradually became the principal anchorage for ships of the Royal Navy while they were " in ordinary , " or out of commission . They were usually stripped of their sails and rigging while in this state and the opportunity was taken to refit and repair them . <unk> and servicing facilities were built in the Medway towns of Gillingham and Chatham which eventually became the nucleus of the Chatham Dockyard . By the time Elizabeth I came to the throne in 1558 , most of the royal fleet used this section of the Medway , known as Chatham and Gillingham Reaches , as an anchorage . 
 Although the Thames had been defended from naval attack since Henry VIII 's time , when five blockhouses were built as part of the Device Forts chain of coastal defences , there were no equivalents on the Medway . Two medieval castles – Rochester Castle and Queenborough Castle – existed along the river 's south bank , but both were intended to defend landward approaches and were of little use for defence . There was thus a pressing need for proper defences to protect the vulnerable ships and shore facilities on the upper Medway . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 Upnor Castle was commissioned in 1559 by order of Queen Elizabeth and her Privy Council . Six " indifferent persons " chose a site opposite St Mary 's Creek in Chatham , on 6 acres ( 24 @,@ 000 m2 ) of land belonging to a Thomas <unk> of Frindsbury . It was acquired by the Crown – possibly compulsorily purchased – for the sum of £ 25 . Military engineer Sir Richard Lee was given the task of designing the new fortification , but he appears to have been fully occupied with working on the defences of Berwick @-@ upon @-@ Tweed , and the project was carried out by others to his designs . His deputy Humphrey Locke took the role of overseer , surveyor , and chief carpenter , while Richard Watts , the former Rochester mayor and victualler to the navy , managed the project on a day @-@ to @-@ day basis and handled the accounting . 
 The castle 's original appearance differed significantly from that of today . The arrow @-@ shaped Water Bastion facing into the Medway and the main block behind it were part of the original design . There were also towers at either end of the water frontage , though these were subsequently replaced by towers of a different design . The gatehouse and moat were later additions . A number of derelict buildings in Rochester Castle , Aylesford , and <unk> were pulled down to provide stone for the castle . The main structure had been completed by 1564 , but it took another three years and an infusion of extra funds to finish the project . The total cost came to £ 4 @,@ 349 . 
 = = = Improvements and repairs = = = 
 During the late 16th century , tensions grew between Protestant England and Catholic Spain , leading ultimately to the undeclared Anglo @-@ Spanish War of 1585 – 1604 . Spain was in a strong position to attack the south of England from its possessions in the Spanish Netherlands . New fortifications were erected along the Medway , including a chain stretched across the width of the river below Upnor Castle . The castle itself was poorly manned until Lord High Admiral Charles Howard , 1st Earl of Nottingham highlighted this and recommended that the garrison should be increased . By 1596 , it was garrisoned by eighty men who were each paid eight pence per day ( equivalent to £ 6 today ) . 
 Continued fears of a Spanish incursion led to the castle 's defences being strengthened between 1599 – 1601 at the instigation of Sir John Leveson . An arrowhead @-@ shaped timber palisade was erected in front of the Water Bastion to block any attempted landings there . An enclosing ditch some 5 @.@ 5 metres ( 18 ft ) deep and 9 @.@ 8 metres ( 32 ft ) wide was dug around the castle . Flanking turrets were constructed to protect the bastion on the site of the present north and south towers . The bastion itself was raised and a high parapet was added to its edge . A gatehouse and drawbridge were also built to protect the castle 's landward side . 
 A survey conducted in 1603 recorded that Upnor Castle had 20 guns of various calibres , plus another 11 guns split between two sconces or outworks , known as Bay and Warham <unk> . The castle 's armament consisted of a demi @-@ cannon , 7 culverin , 5 demi @-@ culverin , a minion , a falconet , a saker , and four <unk> with two chambers each . Bay Sconce was armed with 4 demi @-@ culverin , while Warham Sconce had 2 culverin and 5 demi @-@ culverin . Eighteen guns were recorded as being mounted in the castle twenty years later . The garrison 's armament included 34 longbows , an indication that archery was still of military value even at this late date . By this time , however , the castle was in a state of disrepair . The drawbridge and its raising mechanism were broken , the gun platforms needed repairs , and the courtyard wall had collapsed . A new curtain wall had to be built to protect the landward side of the castle . The foundations of Warham Sconce were reported to have been washed away by the tide , and it appears that both sconces were allowed to fall into ruin . 
 Upnor Castle fell into Parliamentary hands without a fight when the English Civil War broke out in 1642 , and was subsequently used to intern Royalist officers . In May 1648 , a Royalist uprising took place in Kent and Essex , with the royalists seizing a number of towns , including Gravesend , Rochester , Dover , and Maidstone . The Royalists were defeated in the Battle of Maidstone on 1 June , and the castle was restored to Parliamentary hands . Parliamentary commander @-@ in @-@ chief Sir Thomas Fairfax inspected the castle and ordered further repairs and strengthening of the gun platforms . It appears that the height of the gatehouse was also increased at this time , and the north and south towers were built up . They appear to have been left open at the back ( on the landward side ) , but this was remedied in 1653 in the course of further repairs , making them suitable for use as troop accommodation . 
 = = = Raid on the Medway = = = 
 The castle only saw action once in its history , during the Dutch Raid on the Medway in June 1667 , part of the Second Anglo @-@ Dutch War . The Dutch , under the nominal command of Lieutenant @-@ Admiral Michiel de Ruyter , bombarded and captured the town of Sheerness , sailed up the Thames to Gravesend , then up the Medway to Chatham . They made their way past the chain that was supposed to block the river , sailed past the castle , and towed away HMS Royal Charles and Unity , as well as burning other ships at anchor . The Dutch anchored in the Medway overnight on 12 June , while the Duke of Albemarle took charge of the defences and ordered the hasty construction of an eight @-@ gun battery next to Upnor Castle , using guns taken from Chatham . The castle 's guns , the garrison 's muskets , and the new battery were all used to bombard the Dutch ships when they attempted a second time to sail past Upnor to Chatham . The Dutch were able to burn some more ships in the anchorage , but they were unable to make further progress and had to withdraw . The outcome of the raid has been described as " the worst naval defeat England has ever sustained . " 
 The castle had acquitted itself well in the eyes of contemporary observers , despite its inability to prevent the raid , and the dedication of its garrison was praised . The pro @-@ government London Gazette reported that " they were so warmly entertained by Major Scot , who commanded there [ at Upnor ] , and on the other side by Sir Edward Spragg , from the Battery at the <unk> , that after very much <unk> received by them in the shattering of their ships , in sinking severall of their Long Boats manned out by them , in the great number of their Men kill 'd , and some Prisoners taken , they were at the last forced to retire . " Military historian Norman Longmate observes <unk> , " in presenting damning facts in the most favourable light Charles [ II 's ] ministers were unsurpassed . " Samuel Pepys , secretary of the Navy Board , got closer to the truth when he noted in his diary that the castle 's garrison were poorly provisioned : " I do not see that Upnor Castle hath received any hurt by them though they played long against it ; and they themselves shot till they had hardly a gun left upon the carriages , so badly provided they were . " 
 = = = Usage as a magazine and naval facility = = = 
 Upnor Castle had been neglected previously , but the Dutch attack prompted the government to order that it be maintained " as a fort and place of strength " . In the end , the raid marked the end of the castle 's career as a fortress . New and more powerful forts were built farther down the Medway and on the Isle of Grain with the aim of preventing enemies reaching Chatham , thus making the castle redundant . It was converted into " a Place of Stores and Magazines " in 1668 with a new purpose of supplying munitions to naval warships anchored in the Medway or the Swale . Guns , gun carriages , shot , and gunpowder were stored in great quantities within the main building of the castle , which had to be increased in height and its floors reinforced to accommodate the weight . By 1691 , it was England 's leading magazine , with 164 iron guns , 62 standing carriages , 100 ships ' carriages , 7 @,@ 125 pieces of iron shot , over 200 muskets of various types , 77 pikes , and 5 @,@ 206 barrels of powder . This was considerably more than was held at the next largest magazine , the Tower of London . 
 Upnor Castle ceased to be used as a magazine after 1827 and was converted into an Ordnance Magazine . No gunpowder or explosives were stored there after 1840 , though other magazines continued to be built nearby . It was linked to <unk> Barracks , originally the School of Military Railways , via a 2 ft 6in ( 76 cm ) narrow @-@ gauge line built for steam locomotives . In 1891 , the castle and its associated depot came under the full control of the Admiralty , ending an arrangement in which the War Office had managed the site with the Admiralty providing the funding . It became a Royal Naval Armaments Depot ( <unk> ) , one of a group of such facilities around the country . The castle and magazine were used for a time as a <unk> for testing firearms and explosives . 
 The castle remained in military ownership , but it became more of a museum from the 1920s onwards . During the Second World War , the castle was still in service as part of the Magazine Establishment and was damaged by two enemy bombs which fell in 1941 . The bombing dislodged pieces of plaster in the castle 's south tower and gatehouse , under which were discovered old graffiti , including a drawing of a ship dated to around 1700 .

 Following the end of the war in 1945 , the Admiralty gave approval for Upnor Castle to be used as a Departmental Museum and to be opened to the public . It subsequently underwent a degree of restoration . The castle was scheduled as an Ancient Monument in January 1960 and is currently managed by English Heritage . It remains part of the Crown Estate . 
 = = Description = = 
 Upnor Castle 's buildings were constructed from a combination of Kentish ragstone and ashlar blocks , plus red bricks and timber . Its main building is a two @-@ storeyed rectangular block that measures 41 m ( 135 ft ) by 21 m ( 69 ft ) , aligned in a north @-@ east / south @-@ west direction on the west bank of the Medway . Later known as the Magazine , it has been changed considerably since its original construction . It would have included limited barrack accommodation , possibly in a small second storey placed behind gun platforms on the roof . After the building was converted into a magazine in 1668 many changes were made which have obscured the earlier design . The second storey appears to have been extended across the full length of the building , covering over the earlier rooftop gun platforms . This gave more room for storage in the interior . The ground floor was divided into three compartments with a woodblock floor and copper @-@ <unk> doors to reduce the risk of sparks . Further stores were housed on the first floor , with a windlass to raise stores from the waterside . 
 A circular staircase within the building gives access to the castle 's main gun platform or water bastion , a low triangular structure projecting into the river . The castle 's main armament was mounted here in the open air ; this is now represented by six mid @-@ 19th century guns that are still on their original carriages . There are nine embrasures in the bastion , six facing downstream and three upstream , with a rounded parapet designed to deflect shot . The water bastion was additionally protected by a wooden palisade that follows its triangular course a few metres further out in the river . The present palisade is a modern recreation of the original structure . 
 A pair of towers stand on the river 's edge a short distance on either side from the main building . They were originally two @-@ <unk> open @-@ backed structures with gun platforms situated on their first floors , providing flanking fire down the line of the ditch around the castle 's perimeter . They were later adapted for use as accommodation , with their backs closed with bricks and the towers increased in height to provide a third storey . Traces of the gun embrasures can still be seen at the point where the original roofline was . The South Tower was said to have been for the use of the castle 's governor , though their lack of comfort meant that successive governors declined to live there . The two towers are linked to the main building by a <unk> curtain wall where additional cannon were emplaced in two embrasures on the north parapet and one on the south . 
 The castle 's principal buildings are situated on the east side of a rectangular courtyard within which stand two large Turkey oaks , said to have been grown from acorns brought from Crimea after the Crimean War . A stone curtain wall topped with brick surrounds the courtyard , standing about 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) thick and 4 m ( 13 ft ) high . The courtyard is entered on the north @-@ western side through a four @-@ storeyed gatehouse with gun <unk> for additional defensive strength . It was substantially rebuilt in the 1650s after being badly damaged in a 1653 fire , traces of which can still be seen in the form of scorched stones on the first floor walls . A central gateway with a round arch leads into a passage that gives access to the courtyard . Above the gateway is a late 18th century clock that was inserted into the existing structure . A wooden bellcote was added in the early 19th century and a modern flagpole surmounts the building . 
 The curtain wall is surrounded by a dry ditch which was originally nearly 10 m ( 33 ft ) wide by 5 @.@ 5 m ( 18 ft ) deep , though it has since been partially infilled . Visitors to the castle crossed a drawbridge , which is no longer extant , to reach the gatehouse . A secondary entrance to the castle is provided by a sally port in the north wall . On the inside of the curtain wall the brick foundations of buildings can still be seen . These were originally lean @-@ to structures , constructed in the 17th century to provide storage facilities for the garrison . 
 A short distance to the south @-@ west of the castle is a barracks block and associated storage buildings , constructed soon after 1718 . Built to replace the original barrack accommodation within the castle when it was redeveloped to convert it into a magazine , it has changed little externally in the last 300 years . It is a rare surviving example of an 18th @-@ century building of this type and was one of the first distinct barracks to be built in England . 
 Depot buildings formerly associated with the castle still survive in the area immediately to the north @-@ east and remain in Ministry of Defence hands . They were constructed on top of earlier gun emplacements , of which earthwork traces can still be seen in the form of a broad bank running north @-@ east from the castle towards the depot . 
 = VR Class Sm3 = 
 The Sm3 Pendolino ( originally branded as Pendolino S220 , and usually referred to simply as the Pendolino ) is a class of high @-@ speed body @-@ tilting trains operated by VR Group . It is a member of the Pendolino train family ; its design is based on the ETR 460 . The first two trainsets were assembled in Finland by <unk> @-@ <unk> in the mid @-@ 1990s . The rest of the series of eighteen EMUs were built by FIAT Ferroviaria ( later Alstom ) between 2000 and 2006 . The trains serve most of Finland 's major cities such as Helsinki , Turku , Oulu and Joensuu with a maximum speed of 220 km / h ( 140 mph ) , although this speed is only attained between Kerava and Lahti . The train has a power output of 4 @,@ 000 kW ( 5 @,@ 400 hp ) and weighs 328 tonnes ( 323 long tons ; 362 short tons ) . 
 The Sm3 had a long prototype phase before the main series was ordered , with reliability issues being brought up by the press from time to time . Negative reporting continues to haunt the series ' reputation . Reliability problems cannot be proven , as no statistics of specific train types are available . The train has not managed to cope with harsh Finnish weather conditions , and the time benefit of the tilting mechanism will not be taken into account in timetables of winter 2011 – 2012 . Nevertheless , the Sm3 has also received positive feedback from passengers and has led to increased operating speeds on the Finnish rail network . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = 1992 : Ordering = = = 
 VR announced its 2 billion Finnish Mark Pendolino order on 7 February 1992 , consisting of two firm orders and twenty @-@ three options . ABB 's X 2000 was considered in addition of the Italian train ; the latter was chosen due to its lower price ( 70 million FIM per unit ) and because it was already running . Only these two tilting trains were considered due to the twisting nature Finland 's railway network . Thanks to its tilting mechanism , the Pendolino – unlike such other European high @-@ speed trains like the TGV , Thalys , and AVE – does not need to run on specialised high @-@ speed lines , which was important to VR ; instead , it runs on existing lines , and was expected to surpass the speed attained by traditional trains by 35 % . This has both beneficial and negative consequences . The trains cannot run at as high a speed as , for example , the TGV , due to the lines . However , the Pendolino can also run alongside normal non @-@ tilting trains , allowing for greater use of the railway . Building trains that could ensure passenger comfort at high speed on these routes by tilting through the curves was seen as a much cheaper solution than reconstructing the railway network itself due to Finland 's low population and long distances . The train was originally called the <unk> , but in May 1995 it was officially named Sm3 according to VR 's nomenclature for multiple units . 
 It was expected that the train would , as in Italy , run at a maximum speed of 250 kilometres per hour ( 160 mph ) and significantly shorten the travel times between major cities . As an example , the 2 hour and 7 minute travel time between Helsinki and Turku was expected to drop to 1 : 28 by 2010 ; however , the top speed of the train was limited to 220 km / h ( 140 mph ) and the advertised times were never achieved . As of July 2011 , 1 : 44 is the fastest train link between the two cities ( on the S 126 ) . 
 = = = 1993 – 1997 : Testing the prototypes = = = 
 A test carriage from an ETR 460 arrived by boat into Finland from Italy in March 1993 . It was used to test how the Pendolino would cope with Finland 's winter and rail network by running it in Northern <unk> between Nurmes and <unk> . The carriage had to be fitted with new bogies over night at Hanko as it was designed for standard gauge instead of the broader Finnish 1 @,@ 524 mm ( 5 ft ) gauge . Another carriage was built by <unk> according to the specifications of the new train ( nomenclature <unk> from <unk> , test carriage ) . It was later included in the first completed unit as the fourth car , TT <unk> . Before a full trainset was finished , some test runs were made with only the first three carriages of the train in late 1994 . 
 The first finished train was unveiled to the press on 14 October 1994 , and the first two trainsets started their regular test traffic on 27 November 1995 between Helsinki and Turku on the coastal track . Test traffic was stopped only after three months , at the end of February 1996 , due to technical difficulties with the trains . Testing later resumed , and VR announced in 1997 that it would start normal operations with the Pendolino despite electrical problems . The ability of the train to cope with the Finnish winter was put into question , but VR denied that coldness had been a factor in the electrical failures . 
 = = = 1997 – 2006 : The main series = = = 
 Testing ended in August 1997 , after the two trainsets had covered a total of 815 @,@ 000 kilometres ( 506 @,@ 000 mi ) during 3 @,@ 870 trips between Helsinki and Turku . Only six of three thousand journeys were terminated due to technical issues . VR 's CEO Henri Kuitunen was positive about the new train in 1998 , stating that passengers feel it has been a good purchase . Passenger numbers rose by 17 % between Helsinki and Turku in 1997 . 
 Eight additional <unk> were ordered at the end 1997 at the price of FIM 77 million per train ( € 13 million ) . They were delivered between 2000 and 2002 . The main series trains differed in various ways from the prototypes . The new trains allowed Pendolino traffic to extend : they started running between Helsinki and Jyväskylä on 22 October 2001 . In June 2002 , the network was expanded further , and routes were continued from Tampere onwards to Oulu and from Jyväskylä to Kuopio . One of the main series trains ( number <unk> ) was damaged during maritime transport in October 2001 . The badly secured train had come loose during a storm on the Atlantic , almost causing the loss of M / S <unk> , the ship carrying it . Thanks to good actions of the ship 's crew , it was able to reach Le Havre and the train was sent back to Italy to be repaired . 
 Not all passengers were happy with the new train . In 2005 , a delegation of commuters between Helsinki and Tampere collected criticism from fellow passengers on the Internet and delivered it to VR 's head of passenger transport Antti <unk> . The delegation 's leader , Kaj @-@ Erik <unk> , had made 30 trips between the two cities in January 2005 using the Pendolino , 12 of which had been on schedule . 
 The last eight trains were ordered in 2002 and delivered in 2004 – 2006 , finalising the fleet of 18 trains . At that point it had become clear that the speed limits on the rail network were mostly too low for the trains to run at their maximum operating speed , even though they were chosen specifically to prevent the costly work of straightening existing lines . Work on lines has continued , and , on modernised lines , the speed difference between the Pendolino and non @-@ tilting trains has become minimal . The Sm3 was able to attain its maximum operating speed in regular traffic only in 2006 , when a new rail line was opened between Kerava and Lahti and the full Pendolino fleet was available . Seven of the original 23 options never came to be . 
 = = = 2006 onwards : The New Train Era = = = 
 VR advertised the arrival of the full Pendolino fleet with the slogan " New Train Era " ( Finnish : Uusi <unk> @-@ <unk> ) . It started on 3 September 2006 , when the line between Kerava and Lahti was officially opened and timetables changed to take the full potential of the Sm3 into account . Travel times between Helsinki and eastern Finland were cut by up to an hour . 
 The Pendolino has received bad publicity since the first units were taken in service for its serious reliability issues , mostly caused by technical problems with the tilting system and the couplers . The coupling problems grew particularly important with the expansion of the Pendolino network in 2006 , requiring rapid on @-@ the @-@ fly coupling of two trains at intersection stations . Because the units often could not be coupled the train units had to be run as two separate trains running one after another . This consumed one extra train slot on the heavily used rail sections causing cascading timetable delays . Sometimes two trains would not separate after coupling them , caused by moisture in the couplers . Due to the problems VR ended the practice of coupling Pendolino trains on @-@ the @-@ fly at the two intersection stations ; in Tampere in late 2007 and in Kouvola during autumn 2008 . 
 VR has given mixed statements about the fault @-@ sensitivity of the train . <unk> <unk> , project coordinator of VR Engineering downplayed the problems when questioned about the reliability of another Fiat Ferroviaria multiple unit , the <unk> , in 1999 . According to him , the Pendolino had been VR 's most reliable passenger train during winter 1998 – 1999 . In 2006 , VR 's CEO Henri Kuitunen affirmed that the Pendolino was causing serious image problems to VR Group . In 2010 , the company 's head of traffic control Mauno <unk> stated that the Sm3 was not more fault @-@ sensitive than their other trains . However during winter 2011 , VR Group 's head of service and production department Pertti <unk> gave a totally different answer , saying that <unk> are more prone to failures especially during winter . It is impossible to know if the train has more problems than VR 's other rolling stock , as the company does not give out punctuality statistics for specific train types . 
 In the 2010s , the novelty of the Pendolino has worn off and VR has even used the train in regional traffic between Oulu and Rovaniemi due to rail works in summer 2011 . The problematic tilting mechanism was not used during winter 2010 – 2011 and the time benefit of the tilting was not taken into account in timetables of winter 2011 – 2012 . 
 On 19 August 2011 , VR announced it would start a refurbishment of all its Sm3 units to improve the operating conditions during winter . The work will be done between 2012 and 2014 and will cost 10 million Euros . Alstom will cover half of the expenses . The problematic couplers will be changed to allow trains to be coupled on @-@ the @-@ fly again at intermediate stations . <unk> will be installed in the trains ' undercarriages to prevent the formation of ice during the winter . In addition to these modifications , the tilt angle of the bogies will be lowered from the current eight degrees . The operating speed of the train will remain the same . As of January 2013 , new couplers have been installed in at least Sm3 units <unk> and <unk> . 
 Pendolino traffic on the coastal track ended in December 2012 . The two remaining services were replaced with InterCity trains , which run at similar speeds .

 With its eight asynchronous three @-@ phase AC motors delivering 4 @,@ 000 kW ( 5 @,@ 400 hp ) to move its weight of 328 tonnes ( 323 long tons ; 362 short tons ) , the Sm3 does not accelerate particularly fast , reaching 200 km / h ( 120 mph ) from a standstill only after 3 minutes and 13 seconds and a distance of 6 @.@ 8 km ( 4 @.@ 2 mi ) . The tilting mechanism lets the body tilt up to 8 ° at speeds of over 70 km / h ( 43 mph ) , which helps to lessen the G @-@ forces in the corners and allows the train to achieve its maximum speed of 220 kilometres per hour ( 140 mph ) . According to VR , the tilting system enables a 30 to 40 % higher speed compared to traditional trains . The highest speed ever reached by the class has been 242 km / h ( 150 mph ) during testing . 
 Each train consists of six cars , from front to back : IM , CM , TTC , TT , CM and IM . The IM class carriages at each end of the train are powered and fitted with a driver 's compartment . The CM class is a powered passenger car . Class TTC is unpowered , it is equipped with a pantograph and a restaurant . The TT class is an unpowered passenger car which has also a pantograph on its roof . Each of the powered carriages is fitted with one motor on each of the two bogies . If needed , two trains can be coupled together . 
 The prototype and series trains have various differences . The number of seats was increased from 264 to 309 by changing the seat configuration in second class from 2 + 1 to 2 + 2 . The information screens on the outside of the carriages were moved from the center of the carriages to next to the doors . There are also differences with the light switch logic , which often leads to the trains running with both front and tail lights on at the same end . The prototypes differed also originally by their restaurant car and Extra class features . They were modified in the mid @-@ 2000s to be similar to the series trains . 
 The doors of the two prototype trains were changed in 1999 as they were not working properly . 
 VR does the maintenance work of the trains itself , getting expert advice from Alstom as needed . The work is done in Helsinki and Turku . 
 = = Services = = 
 The Pendolino is designed as a premium facility train . The seats are fitted with audio sockets for radio and music channels ; however the radio service was dropped in 2010 due to low usage . All seats have electricity sockets for laptops and mobile phones . All Sm3 trains offer a free onboard Wi @-@ Fi Internet access since 2010 . The passenger information monitors over the aisle in the carriages show a clock and the train 's current speed in addition to VR 's marketing material and station information . They are also used to convey passenger information for the deaf . The train is accessible for wheelchairs , contains pet spaces and seats for allergic passengers . 
 The train has an onboard bistro , named <unk> . It has an Italian theme and serves Italian @-@ style beverage and food in addition to more common Finnish snack bar dishes . Extra class passengers have access to a self @-@ service counter with coffee , tea and the day 's newspapers . Each train has also a closed @-@ off conference compartment for business groups . 
 = = Routes = = 
 The trains are distinguished in Finnish railway timetables by the letter S. The Pendolino network radiates out from the capital Helsinki . Five main routes serve most of Finland 's big cities : 
 Regular service 
 Helsinki – Oulu ( – Rovaniemi ) 
 Helsinki – Vaasa 
 Helsinki – Jyväskylä – Kuopio 
 Helsinki – Kouvola – Kuopio 
 Helsinki – Joensuu 
 Former routes 
 Helsinki – Turku from 27 November 1995 to 8 December 2012 
 The newest service between Helsinki and Vaasa started on 12 December 2011 , with the completion of the electrification work on the Seinäjoki – Vaasa line . 
 The trains can run at speeds up to 200 km / h ( 120 mph ) on routes between Helsinki and Seinäjoki , Helsinki and Turku and Lahti and <unk> as lines are being upgraded . Only the line between Kerava and Lahti permits operation at the maximum speed of 220 kilometres per hour ( 140 mph ) . 
 = = Livery = = 
 At least two livery variants were tested on scale models , which were later exposed at VR 's conference centre at Helsinki central railway station : one has a red strip for the whole length of the train , with the window backgrounds painted grey . The other is more similar to the final result , but the front of the train includes more red and no grey paint at all . VR finally settled to a combination of both of them , which bore resemblance to the company 's InterCity livery . The bottom of the carriages is dark grey , with a red stripe distinguishing it from the white base colour . The top of the carriages is painted grey . Red colouring at the end of each car forms red parallelograms when the carriages are combined . When asked why the trains were not blue and white , VR 's CEO answered that red and white fits the train and its design the best . 
 The trains were originally marked with only a V instead of the full VR logo to symbolise the company 's high speed transport . The same logo was also used on the Sr2 locomotive . The text " Pendolino S220 " was written on the units according to the train 's original branding . On later units , VR 's logo was fully painted ( the same happened with the Sr2 ) and " S220 " dropped . 
 Since 2009 , VR has been repainting its fleet in new colours according to its changed visual identity . Green colour has replaced red , and each car now has two green parallelograms instead of one larger figure between carriages . Artwork showcasing Finnish nature decorates them . As of December 2012 , Sm3 units <unk> to <unk> , <unk> to 7x10 and <unk> have been repainted in the new livery . 
 = = Incidents and accidents = = 
 On 9 January 2003 an improperly locked door came loose in a high speed tunnel at <unk> . No @-@ one was injured in the accident . The settings of all Sm3 doors were checked by the operator in the following days . 
 A Sm3 derailed near <unk> on 25 July 2003 due to a defect in a turnout . The train derailed at a low speed after mechanics turned the turnout blades manually into the correct position , but forgot to check the turnout frog , which was set to a diverging track . The first three carriages of the train derailed completely , in addition to the first bogie of the fourth car . 
 = = Sm6 Allegro = = 
 In December 2010 , Karelian Trains , a joint venture by VR and <unk> , started a new service linking Helsinki to St. Petersburg , Russia using a new model of the Pendolino called the Sm6 Allegro . The Sm6 is technically based on the Pendolino Nuovo , but its looks are similar to the Sm3 . The most significant difference is that an Sm6 unit is composed of seven carriages . The train is capable of dual @-@ voltage running due to differences between the electric systems of the Finnish and Russian rail network and is equipped with four pantographs . 
 The Sm6 is reserved for international passengers and therefore cannot be used to travel inside of Finland . There are four trains per day in each direction . 
 = Mount Edziza volcanic complex = 
 The Mount Edziza volcanic complex is a large and potentially active north @-@ south trending complex volcano in Stikine Country , northwestern British Columbia , Canada , located 38 kilometres ( 24 mi ) southeast of the small community of Telegraph Creek . It occupies the southeastern portion of the Tahltan Highland , an upland area of plateau and lower mountain ranges , lying east of the Boundary Ranges and south of the <unk> River , which is the east fork of the Taku River . As a volcanic complex , it consists of many types of volcanoes , including shield volcanoes , calderas , lava domes , stratovolcanoes , and cinder cones . 
 Most of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex is encompassed within a large provincial park called Mount Edziza Provincial Park . Named after Mount Edziza , this 2 @,@ 660 @.@ 95 km2 ( 1 @,@ 027 @.@ 40 sq mi ) park was established in 1972 to preserve the volcanic and cultural treasures unique to the northern British Columbia area . The Mount Edziza volcanic complex is remote , and , without roads , accessible only along trails . The easiest access is from Highway 37 and a spur road from Dease Lake to Telegraph Creek . From <unk> Lake , on Highway 37 , a poorly maintained trail extends west for 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) into the heart of the complex . From Telegraph Creek another trail extends east for 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) to the north slope of Mount Edziza . 
 = = Geology = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 The Mount Edziza volcanic complex began forming about 7 @.@ 5 million years ago and has grown steadily since then . Like other volcanoes in northwestern British Columbia , the Mount Edziza volcanic complex has its origins in continental rifting — a long divergent plate boundary where the lithosphere is being pulled apart . Here , the continental crust of the North American Plate is being stretched at a rate of about 2 cm ( 1 in ) per year . This incipient rifting has formed as a result of the Pacific Plate sliding northward along the Queen Charlotte Fault , on its way to the Aleutian Trench , which extends along the southern coastline of Alaska and the adjacent waters of northeastern Siberia off the coast of Kamchatka Peninsula . As the continental crust stretches , the near @-@ surface rocks fracture along steeply dipping cracks parallel to the rift known as faults . Hot basaltic magma rises along these fractures to create passive lava eruptions , known as effusive eruptions . 
 The rift zone has existed for at least 20 million years , and has created a line of volcanoes called the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province , also called the Stikine Volcanic Belt , stretching from the Alaska @-@ Yukon border to near Prince Rupert , British Columbia . Several presently dormant volcanoes in the province are potentially active , three of them having erupted in the last few hundred years , two witnessed by First Nations and placer miners during the 18th and 19th centuries . The Tseax Cone , which last erupted in the 18th century , is the southernmost historically active volcano in the province , while Prindle Volcano in easternmost @-@ central Alaska , which erupted during the Pleistocene period , is generally considered the northernmost . 
 = = = Structure = = = 
 The Mount Edziza volcanic complex is Canada 's second largest volcano of young volcanic activity , with an area of 1 @,@ 000 km2 ( 390 sq mi ) , exceeded only by Level Mountain north of Edziza , which has an area of 1 @,@ 800 km2 ( 690 sq mi ) . Four central volcanoes , known as Armadillo Peak , Spectrum Range , Ice Peak , and Mount Edziza , lie along the northerly trending axis of an oval , composite shield volcano . The composite shield volcano consists of overlapping shields , two of which are clearly noticeable on maps . The composite shield volcano forms a broad lava plateau , 65 kilometres ( 40 mi ) long and 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) wide , mainly made of basaltic lava flows ; it is dotted with cinder cones and surrounded by steep ridges called escarpments , which expose layers of black columnar basaltic lava flows with distal rock fragments and pyroclastic deposits . More light @-@ coloured magmas of mainly trachyte and comendite with very little aluminum are mainly confined to the four central volcanoes and associated lava dome . The lava plateau is flanked by <unk> River to the north , Mess Creek and larger Stikine River to the west and the Iskut River to the east . Elevations of the lava plateau are 1 @,@ 500 to 1 @,@ 800 metres ( 4 @,@ 900 – 5 @,@ 900 ft ) with volcanic mountains rising 2 @,@ 590 metres ( 8 @,@ 500 ft ) above sea level . Three sections of the lava plateau have official names ; these are the Arctic Lake , Big Raven , and Kitsu plateaus . The history of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex includes at least two periods of regional glaciation , when deep ice sheets covered the land , and several lesser advances of mountain glaciers . 
 = = = = <unk> composition = = = = 
 The steep @-@ sided , symmetrical stratovolcanoes in the region were built by repeated eruptions of thick , slow @-@ moving lava that have commonly flowed only a few kilometres from the vent . Explosive eruptions are often associated with these volcanoes , depositing alternating layers of volcanic ash , cinders , blocks , and globes of molten rock called volcanic bombs or lava bombs , which are added to its slopes to create the stratovolcano . Edziza 's stratovolcanoes contain a fine @-@ grained silica @-@ rich volcanic rock called trachyte ; they have not erupted for thousands of years , allowing erosion to destroy the original cone , creating craggy ridges and rock outcrops of more resistant materials . 
 = = = = Caldera composition = = = = 
 Circular calderas in the Mount Edziza volcanic complex were formed as a result of emptying the magma chamber beneath a volcano . If enough magma is erupted , the emptied chamber will not be able to support the weight of the volcanic edifice above it . A roughly circular fracture — a " ring fault " — develops around the edge of the chamber . These ring fractures serve as feeders for fault intrusions that are also known as ring dikes . Secondary volcanic vents form above the ring fracture . As the magma chamber empties , the centre of the volcano within the ring fracture begins to collapse . The collapse may occur as the result of a single cataclysmic eruption , or it may occur in stages as the result of a series of eruptions . These caldera collapses are relatively small compared to most other caldera collapses . The largest caldera at the Mount Edziza volcanic complex is about 6 kilometres ( 4 mi ) in diameter while most calderas are at least 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) in diameter . Volcanic eruptions accompanying these collapses produced trachyte and a white , <unk> rhyolite called comendite . 
 = = = = Lava dome composition = = = = 
 Edziza 's rounded , steep @-@ sided lava domes were built by eruptions of very thick light @-@ coloured magma , including trachyte . Such magmas are typically too thick to move far from the vent it extrudes from , causing it to solidify quickly and build on previous volcanic extrusions , creating a characteristic dome @-@ like shape . The thickness of the magma is attributed to high levels of silica , a naturally occurring silicon dioxide found in various crystalline and amorphous forms . Edziza 's domes reach heights of several hundred metres , and grew slowly and steadily for months to years . The sides of these structures are composed of unstable rock debris . Due to the possibility of the building of gas pressure , the dome can experience more explosive eruptions over time . When part of a lava dome collapses while it still contains molten rock and gases , it can produce a pyroclastic flow , a super @-@ heated mix of gas , ash , and pumice . 
 Characteristics of lava dome eruptions include shallow , long @-@ period and hybrid seismic activity , which is attributed to excess fluid pressures in the contributing vent chamber . Other characteristics of lava domes include their spherical dome shape , cycles of dome growth over long periods , and sudden onsets of violent explosive activity . The average rate of dome growth may be used as a rough indicator of magma supply , but it shows no systematic relationship to the timing or characteristic of lava dome explosions . 
 = = = = Cinder cone composition = = = = 
 The steep conical cinder cones of Edziza were formed by lava fountain eruptions , emitting particles and blobs of congealed lava from a single vent . As the gas @-@ charged lava is blown violently into the air , it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as cinder around the vent to form a circular or oval cone . Edziza 's cinder cones have bowl @-@ shaped craters at their summits and rise more than a hundred metres above their surroundings . Cinder cones are widespread in British Columbia as well as throughout other volcanic terrains of the world . 
 Eve Cone , a black cinder cone of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex , is one of the most famous symmetrical and best preserved cinder cones in Canada , reaching a height of 1 @,@ 740 metres ( 5 @,@ 710 ft ) and a topographic prominence of 150 metres ( 490 ft ) . 
 = = = = Shield volcano composition = = = = 
 Edziza 's shield volcanoes are built almost entirely of fluid lava flows . They formed as a result of lava flowing out in all directions from central summit vents and from groups of vents , building a broad , gently sloping cone of flat , domical shape . They are built up slowly by the accretion of thousands of lava flows of highly fluid basaltic lava , which spread widely over great distances , and then cool as thin , gently dipping sheets . In some shield volcano eruptions , basaltic lava has poured out quietly from fissure vents instead of central vents , flooding the surrounding countryside with lava flow upon lava flow , forming Edziza 's broad lava plateau . 
 Lava plateaus similar to Edziza 's can be found elsewhere in North America , including the Snake River Plain in Idaho , and the Columbia River Basalt Group in southeastern Washington , and eastern Oregon , United States ; they can also be found in Iceland . 
 = = = = Subglacial mound composition = = = = 
 Subglacial mounds ( <unk> ) of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex are an unusual type of subglacial volcano formed when subglacial eruptions began melting overlying glacial ice at a time when this region was covered by glacial ice during the Pleistocene and early Holocene periods . These subglacial eruptions were not hot enough to melt a vertical pipe right through the overlying glacial ice , instead forming mounds of hydrated volcanic rock made up of volcanic fragments called hyaloclastite and lava that solidified into pillow @-@ shaped masses called pillow lava deep beneath the glacial ice field . Once the glaciers had retreated , the subglacial volcanoes would be revealed , with a unique shape as a result of their confinement within glacial ice . 
 = = = Eruptive history = = = 
 The lava domes , calderas , stratovolcanoes , subglacial mounds and cinder cones forming the volcanic complex were constructed in five phases , each of which began with the effusion of dark olivine basalt which formed the flat @-@ lying shield volcanoes and concluded with the eruption of light @-@ coloured magma . This cyclical behavior is attributed to the episodic rise of basic , mantle @-@ derived alkali basalt both to the surface and partly into crustal reservoirs where the light @-@ coloured magmas with very little aluminum were created by prolonged crystal fractionation . The silica @-@ rich trachyte and comendite lavas are similar to those associated with the most violent eruptions on Earth . 
 = = = = Armadillo Peak eruptive period = = = = 
 The first phase of activity resulted in the creation of Armadillo Peak seven million years ago , today represented by an eroded remnant of a small caldera flanked by steep @-@ sided light @-@ coloured secondary lava domes , including <unk> Peak , <unk> Peak , IGC Centre , and <unk> Volcano , and a thick pile of interlayered light @-@ coloured lava flows , pyroclastic flows , air @-@ fall pumice , and <unk> deposits . It is the most central of the four central volcanoes and its 2 @,@ 210 metres ( 7 @,@ 250 ft ) summit is capped by 180 metres ( 590 ft ) of fine @-@ grained silica @-@ rich trachyte lava flows which were ponded inside the caldera to produce a lava lake six million years ago during its final stage of activity . 
 = = = = Spectrum Range eruptive period = = = = 
 The second phase of activity began three million years ago , emplacing rhyolitic magma 150 metres ( 490 ft ) thick and 13 metres ( 43 ft ) long during a single event of activity . A broad circular lava dome was eventually created called the Spectrum Range . This is the southernmost of the four central volcanoes and is over 10 kilometres ( 6 mi ) wide and up to 650 metres ( 2 @,@ 130 ft ) thick on the southwestern flank of Armadillo Peak and north of the Arctic Lake Plateau . Named for its extensive colourful alteration , it overlies a basal shield volcano and contains deeply carved circular valleys displaying portions of massive silica @-@ rich comendite and trachyte lava flows which comprise the lava dome . The deeply carved circular valleys also display the bounding faults of a buried , <unk> caldera approximately 4 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 8 mi ) across . More than 100 cubic kilometres ( 24 cu mi ) of rhyolite and trachyte was erupted during the Spectrum Range dome eruptive period , with its activity ending 2 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 years ago . 
 = = = = Ice Peak eruptive period = = = = 
 Ice Peak , 2 @,@ 500 metres ( 8 @,@ 200 ft ) high , which overlaps the northern flank of Armadillo Peak , began to form during Edziza 's third phase of activity , starting 1 @,@ 600 @,@ 000 years ago when the regional Cordilleran Ice Sheet began retreating . It is a stratovolcano that was constructed when large areas of the Edziza lava plateau were free from glacial ice and now enclosed by glacial deposits . However , additional parts of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex were likely still covered by glacial ice . The volcanic activity from Ice Peak during this period produced both basic and intermediate to light @-@ coloured lava flows and pyroclastic rocks which mixed with meltwater to produce debris flows . As Ice Peak began to form , basic lava spread to the flanks of the cone where it formed meltwater lakes and combines with and forms part of the adjacent shield volcano . As lava continued to flow into these meltwater lakes , pillow lava and solidified rubble was created . Many of the lava flows with compositions of trachyte and basalt were however erupted just below the surface of the soil . Continuous volcanic activity eventually made Ice Peak reach an elevation of 2 @,@ 400 metres ( 7 @,@ 900 ft ) when three viscous , intermediate , and light @-@ coloured lava flows built up around secondary lava domes parallel with its western side during its final stage of activity 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 years ago and develops nearly all of the steep , higher flanks of the volcano . These viscous light @-@ coloured lava flows are displayed at two cliffs with broad faces , known as <unk> Bluff and <unk> Bluff and contain basic rock made of solidified rubble overlain by large fractured lava with massive , poorly established pillars . 
 Two cinder cones on Ice Peak 's southern flank called Camp Hill and Cache Hill and possibly first erupted when glacial ice was still existing on the Edziza lava plateau . As lava flowed into the glacial ice above a vent , pools of meltwater were created . Continuous lava eruptions that flowed into the meltwater pools were cooled and fractured . This fragmental material was interrupted by explosions of steam , water , ash , rock , and volcanic bombs called phreatic eruptions . Camp Hill was eventually developed and over time it grew above water level inside the meltwater lake . Later eruptions produced a pyroclastic cone on top of the original fragmental cone . Cache Hill erupted when nearly all the glacial ice had retreated . The first lava flows from Cache Hill flowed through and dammed a river valley , which eventually ponded to produce a small lake . Subsequent lava flows traveled into the lake to produce pillow lava and solidified rubble . During the long period of Ice Peak activity , high @-@ altitude glaciers developed and melted cutting valleys into the volcano . The current 2 @,@ 500 metres ( 8 @,@ 200 ft ) high summit of Ice Peak is a remnant of the western rim of a small summit caldera , which has been nearly destroyed by erosion from high @-@ altitude glaciation . Near the end of Ice Peak activity 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 years ago , this high @-@ altitude glacial ice combined with the regional ice forming part of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet . It is likely that only the tallest mountains might have been visible over the Cordilleran Ice Sheet which was at least 2 @,@ 285 metres ( 7 @,@ 497 ft ) thick . A small volume of intermediate lava was erupted from Ice Peak compared to the other central volcanoes . 
 = = = = Mount Edziza eruptive period = = = = 
 The fourth phase of activity began one million years ago when the Cordilleran Ice Sheet retreated from the upper flanks of the adjacent lava plateau , creating Mount Edziza proper which is the most northerly of the four central volcanoes . It is a steep @-@ sided stratovolcano and the largest and highest of the peaks that form the volcanic complex with an elevation of 2 @,@ 787 metres ( 9 @,@ 144 ft ) , overlapping the northern flank of Ice Peak . The stratovolcano is made up of a fine @-@ grained volcanic rock called trachyte and is associated with several lava domes which were formed by trachyte lava flows and explosive eruptions . Its smooth northern and western flanks , only slightly channeled by erosion , curve up to a circular 2 @,@ 700 @-@ metre ( 8 @,@ 900 ft ) summit ridge which surrounds a central , ice @-@ filled caldera 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) in diameter . Many glaciers cover Mount Edziza proper , including the Tencho Glacier on its southern flank . Active cirques on the eastern flank have breached the caldera rim , exposing the remnants of numerous lava lakes which ponded in the caldera 900 @,@ 000 years ago and rest on hydrothermally altered breccia of the main conduit . Piles of pillow lava and hyaloclastite , formed by subglacial eruptions , are found on the flanks of Mount Edziza and nearby Ice Peak , as well as on the surface of the surrounding shield volcano . Pillow Ridge on Edziza 's northwest flank was formed when basaltic lava erupted beneath the regional Cordilleran Ice Sheet when it was close to its greatest thickness . 
 = = = = Central volcano flank eruptive period = = = = 
 The fifth and final phase of eruptive activity occurred from secondary volcanic vents along the flanks of the four central volcanoes starting 10 @,@ 000 years ago . This phase of activity began at a time when remnants of glacial ice were still present and continued after the glacial period . The initial flank eruptions , quenched by glacial meltwater , formed hyaloclastite tuff rings , whereas later activity created 30 small cinder cones , primarily of basaltic composition , including Mess Lake Cone , Kana Cone , Cinder Cliff , <unk> Cone , Ridge Cone , Williams Cone , <unk> Creek Cone , Moraine Cone , <unk> Cone , Sleet Cone , Storm Cone , Triplex Cone , Twin Cone , Cache Hill , Camp Hill , Cocoa Crater , Coffee Crater , Nahta Cone , Tennena Cone , The Saucer and the well @-@ preserved Eve Cone . These cinder cones were formed no more than the year 700 based on the age of burnt plant stems still rooted in former soil under 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) of loose basaltic fragments . These cinder cones were built on the basaltic fragments and blocky lava fields surrounding the cones . The Snowshoe lava field , on the southern end of the Big Raven Plateau , is one of the areas of young lava flows in the region while the Desolation lava field , on the northern end of the Big Raven Plateau , is the largest area of young lava flows , covering an area of 150 km2 . The longest lava flow is 12 kilometres ( 7 mi ) . This volcanic activity was followed by at least two younger , but still undated eruptions , including an undated air @-@ fall pumice deposit . 
 The undated air @-@ fall pumice deposit exists across the southwestern part of the Big Raven Plateau called Sheep Track Pumice or Sheep Track member . Pumice is a light volcanic rock full of air spaces and commonly pale in colour , ranging from white , cream , blue or grey , but can be green or black . The Sheep Track Pumice is mysterious because the vent of its origin is unknown , even though it is estimated from its state of preservation to be younger than 500 years . This pumice deposit emphasizes one of the significant volcanic hazards linked to the Mount Edziza volcanic complex - the likelihood of a violent explosive eruption . The volcano that produced the pumice might be covered by glacial ice . Collaborators at the University of British Columbia have started work on samples collected from deposits of Sheep Track Pumice .

 The Mount Edziza volcanic complex is one of the eleven Canadian volcanoes associated with recent seismic activity : the others are Castle Rock , Mount Garibaldi , Mount Cayley , Hoodoo Mountain , The Volcano , Crow Lagoon , Silverthrone Caldera , Mount Meager , Wells Gray @-@ Clearwater volcanic field and Nazko Cone . Seismic data suggests that these volcanoes still contain live magma plumbing systems , indicating possible future eruptive activity . Although the available data does not allow a clear conclusion , these observations are further indications that some of Canada 's volcanoes are potentially active , and that their associated hazards may be significant . The seismic activity correlates both with some of Canada 's most youthful volcanoes , and with long @-@ lived volcanic centres with a history of significant explosive behavior , such as the Mount Edziza volcanic complex . 
 The most recent volcanic activity at the Mount Edziza volcanic complex have been hot springs , several of which are found on the volcano 's western flank , including Elwyn springs ( 36 ° C or 97 ° F ) , <unk> springs ( 46 ° C or 115 ° F ) , and inactive springs near Mess Lake . The springs are near the youngest lava fields of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex and are most likely associated with the most recent eruptive activity . These hot springs were highly important to the adjacent Tahltan people . 
 Hot springs are closely associated with fumaroles , which are vents in an active volcanic area releasing steam and hot gases , such as sulfur dioxide . In general , the water is rotating groundwater that comes into contact with rocks heated by magma and finds openings to the surface . The formation of the springs depends both on the rocks the water has passed through and the profusion of volcanic discharges mixed with the groundwater . Iron oxide , iron sulfides and other substances usually colour pools of boiling mud brilliant yellow , red , brown or green . Hot springs comprising significantly softened silica may deposit it to form siliceous sinter , whereas those comprising softened calcium carbonate deposit spongy @-@ looking calcareous rock called tufa . Overflow of the springs can build masses , spires or stepped terraces of calcareous sinter or tufa .

 As early as 10 @,@ 000 years ago , the Tahltan First Nations people , who now live in Dease Lake , Telegraph Creek and the Iskut , used obsidian from the Mount Edziza volcanic complex to make tools and weapons for trading material . Most of the obsidian occurs at relatively high elevations at about 1 @,@ 800 to 1 @,@ 900 metres ( 5 @,@ 900 – 6 @,@ 200 ft ) . This is the main source of obsidian found in northwestern British Columbia , which was traded as far away as Alaska and northern Alberta . Obsidian is a type of naturally occurring glass that is highly valued for its cutting qualities and is produced by the rapid cooling of lava . Like all glass and some other types of naturally occurring rocks , obsidian breaks with a characteristic conchoidal fracture , creating razor sharp edges . A knife made of Edziza obsidian , possibly 2 @,@ 000 years old , has been recovered in the Stikine River area . Two exposed columnar basalt formations exist within the volcanic complex : the Tahltan Eagle at the meeting of the Tahltan and Stikine rivers , and Pipe Organ Mountain . The Tahltan Eagle has significant spiritual and cultural importance to the Tahltan people , while the correct name and cultural significance of Pipe Organ Mountain to the Tahltan people is unknown .

 This area of long @-@ lived volcanic activity has been studied and mapped in detail for many years by geoscientists . The first detail studying and mapping of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex was accomplished in the early 1970s by a Geological Survey of Canada society led by Canadian scientist Jack Souther . Edziza was a significant study area by Souther . While mapping , Souther looked at a mineral tenure map of Stikine Country and was surprised to see that many of the small cinder cones in the area had been maintained by mineral tenures . Upon investigation , the staking had been completed for the British Columbia Railway , then under construction to Dease Lake . The staking was designed to provide a ready source of weight for the railway bed . The Geological Survey of Canada agreed to support a series of Canada @-@ wide lectures by Jack Souther to establish the Mount Edziza Provincial Park to protect the Mount Edziza volcanic complex . Coincidentally , Jack Souther had an opportunity to examine the Red Dog ( Spectrum ) property gold veins and he accomplished several section studies of specimens . It was not Souther 's intention to include in the park any of the mineralization within near @-@ surface older rocks . However , the British Columbia Ministry of Parks established the Mount Edziza Recreation Area covering 1 @,@ 007 @.@ 7 km2 ( 389 @.@ 1 sq mi ) on July 27 , 1972 as the park proclamation , providing a 1 to 10 km ( 1 to 6 mi ) wide buffer zone around the park area . On March 21 , 1989 , all but 40 km2 ( 15 sq mi ) of the recreation area , covering the Spectrum gold property on its margin , was surreptitiously merged with Mount Edziza Provincial Park , almost doubling its size to 2 @,@ 287 square kilometres ( 883 sq mi ) . 
 Souther 's studies in 1992 highlighted the importance and size of the region , and proposed that numerous subglacial eruptions emplaced lava in a sub @-@ ice or ice @-@ contact environment . More recent studies have worked on Souther 's contributions with more detailed studies which are funded by colleges and universities . Since colleges and universities started studying the Mount Edziza volcanic complex , it has been an extremely important volcano for subglacial volcanism because its ice @-@ contact lavas record evidence of ice existence and thickness in an area for which there is very little data on ice conditions before the Illinoian Stage of glaciation , which preceded the last glacial , or " Wisconsin " , period . Several areas of possible basaltic and trachytic ice @-@ contact products were studied in detail on the western flank of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex , in order to approve their ice @-@ contact nature , and to eventually better constrain former ice existence and thickness . Its lava plateau has also been an important cultural resource . In 2006 , Jeff Hungerford , a student of the University of Pittsburgh in Carlisle , Pennsylvania , United States , focused on fieldwork on the region surrounding Edziza 's Tennena Cone , located immediately west of Ice Peak which formed <unk> during the early Holocene period when this area had remnants of glacial ice from the last ice age . Hungerford 's studies in 2006 focused on subglacial volcanism , sampling pillow lavas to be used for degassing studies aimed at determining ice thicknesses during a subglacial eruption , and describing coeval glaciogenic sediments immediately underlying pillow lavas at the distal end of the lava flows . Hungerford also worked on describing glaciogenic sediments immediately underlying lava flows from Ice Peak adjacent to Tennena Cone , which may preserve a record of a one @-@ million @-@ year @-@ old ice sheet . 
 Kristen LaMoreaux , another student of the University of Pittsburgh , focused on the emplacement of trachyte lava flows and domes . In 2006 , LaMoreaux analyzed jointing patterns at <unk> Bluff , a viscous series of trachyte lava flows on the western lava plateau of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex . LaMoreaux also examined trachytic lava flows from <unk> Bluff and Triangle Dome , a trachytic lava dome which last erupted during the Pleistocene period . Other studies by LaMoreaux determined criteria for understanding how lava flow thickness may or may not be an indication that the progress of a lava flow was impeded by an ice barrier , resulting in an unusually thick lava flow . 
 <unk> Endress , a student of Dickinson College in Carlisle , Pennsylvania , United States , focused on a section of glaciogenic sediments immediately beneath the same Ice Peak trachyte lava flow sampled and described by Jeff Hungerford during his 2006 studies . Endress <unk> to determine if the sediments were deposited immediately before the lava flow was emplaced , or if they are likely to be much older . Endress has quantified the mineralogy of clasts and sand @-@ sized particles from samples in the sediment , and has determined that the mineralogy of several of the trachytic clasts is very similar to that in the overlying lava flow , including the minerals clinopyroxene , magnetite , alkali feldspar , and <unk> . Endress has also found small lenses of pristine basaltic glass , which could have derived from the Pillow Ridge subglacial mound near Mount Edziza . 
 Alexander S. Lloyd , a student of Dickinson College , focused on the cooling rates of pillow lavas . Lloyd studied in detail the variation in crystal sizes from the edge pristine pillow lava , which could have derived from nearby Pillow Ridge which last erupted during the Pleistocene period . 
 Courtney Haynes , another student of Dickinson College , focused on mathematics of the pillow lavas in 2007 . 
 = = Monitoring = = 
 Currently the Mount Edziza volcanic complex is not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active the volcano 's magma system is . The existing network of seismographs has been established to monitor tectonic earthquakes and is too far away to provide a good indication of what is happening beneath the volcanic complex . The network may sense an increase in activity if the volcano becomes very restless , but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption . It might detect activity only once the volcano has started erupting . 
 A possible way to detect an eruption is studying Edziza 's geological history since every volcano has its own pattern of behavior , in terms of its eruption style , magnitude and frequency , so that its future eruption is expected to be similar to its previous eruptions . 
 While there is a likelihood of Canada being critically affected by local or close by volcanic eruptions argues that some kind of improvement program is required . Benefit @-@ cost thoughts are critical to dealing with natural hazards . However , a benefit @-@ cost examination needs correct data about the hazard types , magnitudes and occurrences . These do not exist for volcanoes in British Columbia or elsewhere in Canada in the detail required . 
 Other volcanic techniques , such as hazard mapping , displays a volcano 's eruptive history in detail and speculates an understanding of the hazardous activity that could possibly be expected in the future . A large volcanic hazard program has never existed within the Geological Survey of Canada . The information has been collected in a lengthy , separate way from the support of several employees , such as volcanologists and other geologic scientists . Current knowledge is best established at Mount Meager in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt of southwestern British Columbia and is likely to rise considerably with a temporary mapping and monitoring project . Knowledge at the Mount Edziza volcanic complex and other volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province is not as established , but certain contributions are being done at least Mount Cayley , another volcano in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt . An intensive program classifiying infrastructural exposure near all young Canadian volcanoes and quick hazard assessments at each individual volcanic edifice associated with recent seismic activity would be in advance and would produce a quick and productive determination of priority areas for further efforts . 
 The existing network of seismographs to monitor tectonic earthquakes has existed since 1975 , although it remained small in population until 1985 . Apart from a few short @-@ term seismic monitoring experiments by the Geological Survey of Canada , no volcano monitoring has been accomplished at the Mount Edziza volcanic complex or at other volcanoes in Canada at a level approaching that in other established countries with historically active volcanoes . Active or restless volcanoes are usually monitored using at least three seismographs all within approximately 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) , and frequently within 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) , for better sensitivity of detection and reduced location errors , particularly for earthquake depth . Such monitoring detects the risk of an eruption , offering a forecasting capability which is important to mitigating volcanic risk . Currently the Mount Edziza volcanic complex does not have a seismograph closer than 88 kilometres ( 55 mi ) . With increasing distance and declining numbers of seismographs used to indicate seismic activity , the prediction capability is reduced because earthquake location accuracy and depth decreases , and the network becomes less accurate . At carefully monitored volcanoes both the located and noticed events are recorded and surveyed immediately to improve the understanding of a future eruption . 
 In countries like Canada it is possible that small precursor earthquake swarms might go undetected , particularly if no events were observed ; more significant events in larger swarms would be detected but only a minor subdivision of the swarm events would be complex to clarify them with confidence as volcanic in nature , or even associate them with an individual volcanic edifice .

 Empire : Total War is a turn @-@ based strategy and real @-@ time tactics computer game developed by The Creative Assembly and published by Sega . The fifth installment in the Total War series , the game was released in North America on 3 March 2009 , and in the rest of the world the following day . The game , which focuses on the early modern period of the 18th century , was announced at the Leipzig Games Convention in August 2007 . The Mac OS X version of the game was released by Feral Interactive on 13 September 2012 . Linux version was released , also by Feral Interactive , on 9 December 2014 . 
 Following a similar style of interface and play to earlier Total War titles , players choose a contemporary 18th @-@ century faction and set out to ensure that faction 's domination over the known world through military force , diplomacy , espionage and economics . Although the campaign element of the game is turn @-@ based , players can direct battles in real @-@ time . Empire : Total War is the first game in the series to allow naval battles to be conducted in real @-@ time . In addition to the standard campaign mode , the game includes a special campaign that follows the development of the United States from the settlement of Jamestown to the American War of Independence . Players may also engage in recreations of several historical battles from the early modern era such as the Battle of Fontenoy , Battle of <unk> , Battle of Brandywine Creek and Battle of Lagos . 
 Reviewers gave Empire : Total War a positive response upon release ; several critics commended it as one of the foremost strategy titles of recent times . Praise was bestowed upon the extensive strategy breadth , accurate historical challenges and visual effects . The real @-@ time land battles , with a far greater focus on gunpowder weaponry than earlier Total War titles , were thought to be successfully implemented . Criticisms focused on shortcomings with the game 's artificial intelligence and on the real @-@ time naval battles , the latter of which were perceived to be difficult to control and co @-@ ordinate . The game was a commercial success , topping sales charts within the week of release ; nevertheless , several Creative Assembly employees later commented on issues caused by a perceived early release . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Empire : Total War is focused on exploration , economics , politics , religion , the founding of colonies and , ultimately , conquest . The game is set in the early modern period , spanning from 1700 until the end of the 18th century , allowing players to lead a variety of contemporary nations to dominate Europe , the Middle East , India , North America and the Caribbean , along with maritime trade theaters including the South American coast , the Gulf of Guinea , the Mozambique Channel and the East Indies . The player will use both complex strategies on the campaign map as well as command military forces in battles on both land and sea . As with previous Total War games , Empire : Total War consists of two broad areas of gameplay : a turn @-@ based geopolitical campaign that allows the user to move armies and navies across the globe , conduct diplomacy , trade , espionage , and the internal politics of their nation , and other tasks needed to run their nation , as well as a real @-@ time battle mode that enables players to direct the course of any battles that take place . 
 Empire : Total War features approximately fifty 18th @-@ century factions ; however , only eleven of the most powerful and influential factions of the era are playable . In western Europe , the main factions are Great Britain , France , the United Provinces , Spain and Sweden , while central and eastern Europe are represented by Prussia , Austria , Russia and Poland – Lithuania . In the Balkans and Middle East , the Ottoman Empire is depicted as a dominating faction for Islam , while the Maratha Confederacy and Mughal Empire are the major powers on the Indian subcontinent . The New World colonies of the major powers are represented as protectorates of their respective home nations . The establishment of key nations during the era , such as Revolutionary France and the United States , and the fall of native states to the larger empires is reflected in the game , though given player involvement any of these major events may be averted . Smaller factions , including the less powerful German and Italian states , Native American tribes and North African countries are also represented . Each faction varies in territory , strengths and specialities . 
 A story @-@ driven campaign mode entitled " Road to Independence " is also included in Empire : Total War , where the player guides the British colonisation of America in three structured chapters . The first chapter sees the player establish and develop the English colony of Jamestown , the second focuses on the British fighting both the French and their allied Native American nations in the French and Indian War , whilst the third portion has the player directing the American Continental Army against the British in the War of Independence . This campaign is goal @-@ oriented and strictly historical in nature , and additionally functions as an active learning experience , where players may learn , in each chapter : firstly , to manage and defend regional economies , secondly , to form alliances and to capture and hold territories and exploit their resources on increasingly large scales , and finally , to use all of the player 's acquired skills to survive and achieve victory in a total war against a superior opponent . Completion of " Road to Independence " unlocks the newly formed United States for use in a shorter , later version of the full campaign . 
 = = = Campaign = = = 
 The main campaign of Empire : Total War involves a player choosing a faction and moving to forge a global empire during the 18th century . Each faction controls various historical provinces , each with a regional capital , and a number of other settlements ranging from minor villages to prosperous sea ports ( as long as they are coastal territories ) . The player can recruit armies and navies to take and defend provinces by military means , or adopt diplomacy and politics to make advances in the game . In addition , players can use economics and religion to their advantage , as well as clandestine means such as espionage and assassination . The campaign mode is turn @-@ based , with each turn representing six months starting in summer or winter , allowing the player to attend to all needs of their faction before ending their turn and allowing the artificial intelligence to make all other factions ' moves . 
 The campaign mode features a similar approach to those in Rome : Total War and Medieval II : Total War , but includes several enhancements . The game features three main theatres of play : Europe ( which also includes North Africa and the Middle East ) , the Americas , and the Indian subcontinent , as well as four minor trade theatres : the East Indies , the Ivory Coast , the Straits of Madagascar and Brazil . The way provinces work has been decentralised ; although a central settlement is still used , other locations within a province can deal with trade and technology , allowing factions to disrupt a province 's productivity without assaulting the main settlement . Diplomacy , taxation , and trade have been streamlined with the aim of reducing the need for micromanagement . Part of this streamlining involves allowing the player to appoint ministers to form a cabinet or court to govern the nation . Previous Total War games required the player to promote governors for each major city , whose qualifications would affect only the government of that city , whereas in Empire ministers ' qualifications affect the government of all the player 's cities , modified in each individual case by the size of the metropolitan administration , reflecting the shift to modern nation @-@ statehood from premodern city @-@ statehood . The wandering scholars , spies , emissaries and assassins used in previous titles to deal with the diplomatic , trade and espionage aspects of the game have been replaced with just three units : gentlemen , rakes , and missionaries . The former handle research and can challenge other characters to a duel to dispose of them honourably ( thus eliminating the diplomatic risk of being implicated in an assassination plot ) , while rakes perform clandestine tasks such as spying , assassination , and sabotage . Missionaries serve to convert the populace of regions to the state religion of the nation deploying them , which reduces religious unrest and softens cultural unrest . <unk> units also exist for certain nations - namely , Ottomans , Persians , and other near eastern nations replace rakes with <unk> , while Indian nations use <unk> for the same purposes , and all nations south and east of the Ottoman Empire use Eastern Scholars instead of gentlemen ( these are not completely isomorphic , however , because they cannot duel ) , and a variety of isomorphic religious leaders exist , such as Catholic , Orthodox , and Protestant missionaries , Imams , and Brahmin . The way armies are produced also differs : in addition to being produced by settlements and then moved to generals by the player , generals can now also build their armies directly by recruiting from nearby settlements . Players can now research technologies along a technology tree , leading to advances and new discoveries in areas such as infrastructure , politics , agriculture or the military . 
 Changes in government may occur during the campaign as the rise of republicanism over the traditional rule by monarchy becomes an issue in the early modern time period . For instance , the United States may only come into existence if the ruling British Empire is unable to maintain social order . In addition , nations with highly unpopular governments and a history of workers ' strikes , riots , or popular demands for change may experience revolutions similar to the French Revolution . When the middle or upper classes become similarly disenchanted with a current government , a civil war or revolt may occur . Factions will also have a varying number of objectives such as establishing successful colonies , trade routes and dominance in certain regions as victory conditions . Rebellions and revolutions may occur , and are influenced by the form of government in place . When a revolution occurs , the player can opt to side with the rebellious forces or the loyalist troops . The type of government installed by the player in their faction will determine how other factions view the player and will influence their diplomatic relations . While religion no longer plays a central role as in Medieval II : Total War , it is still important in helping bring under control newly captured regions and in defining to some degree diplomatic relations between nations . 
 = = = Warfare = = = 
 The second major area of gameplay is the battle and or fighting system . Unlike the campaign part of the game , players control battles in real @-@ time . As with all titles in the series after Shogun : Total War , battles in Empire : Total War can take place on both land and water . However , Empire is the first Total War title to allow naval battles as well as land @-@ based engagements to be fought in real @-@ time ; previously , when a naval battle was fought it would be automatically resolved by the game 's artificial intelligence , taking into account factors such as number of ships and crew , and armament types to decide the victor . Automatic resolution of battles during a campaign is an option for both land and sea battles . Outside the main campaign mode , players can participate in recreations of historical battles in the 18th century and early 19th century . 
 In land engagements , players are given access to an 18th @-@ century army consisting of a variety of units , such as cavalry , musketeers , riflemen and artillery . Each unit has its own intrinsic advantages , disadvantages , cost , and overall level of effectiveness . Players must use 18th @-@ century tactics and formations with the units they have available to defeat their enemies . The terrain of the battlefield and the weather also impact on how a battle is fought . Factions can lay siege to settlements , replacing open land battles with street fighting and close @-@ quarters combat . Each unit has morale , which can increase if the battle goes well for their faction , or decrease in cases such as heavy casualties , army losses , being under artillery bombardment or the death of the general . Tactical situations such as attacking from a flank or a rear , or depriving a unit of allied reinforcements would also cause the morale of the unit to drop dramatically . When a unit 's morale is sufficiently depleted , it will be routed and attempt to flee the battlefield . Depending on whether the unit 's morale is merely broken or entirely shattered , the player may be able to rally the men in the unit and regroup . Victory in battle is achieved by causing every enemy unit to rout , or by annihilating the opposing army . In addition , siege battles can be won if the attacker manages to take control of the settlement 's central square for a set amount of time . Empire : Total War also introduces several new battlefield elements to the Total War series . Units can take cover behind walls or in buildings , allowing increased interactivity with the terrain and making some buildings points of strategic interest . Field defences may be set up in real @-@ time on the battlefield , to adjust for given situations . Infantry units can also scale small obstacles in the field , such as walls and fences . Weapons based on gunpowder are prone to accidents and can misfire . Each unit has different capabilities like Square Formation , Wedge , Diamond , <unk> bayonets , or Fire at will . 
 In naval battles , players can control a fleet of up to twenty ships , varying in class , size , armament and crew . As in land @-@ based conflicts , players must make use of 18th @-@ century tactics to overcome enemy fleets . As with army units , each ship 's crew has a set amount of morale that changes as a battle progresses ; a crew may attempt to withdraw their vessel from the battle if their morale is broken , or in extreme cases may surrender without further enemy action . A battle is won when all of the hostile ships have been sunk or captured or have left the map . Individual ships can be adjusted to allow for a maximum field of fire while attempting to maintain a minimised target , all whilst remaining within an overall formation with the rest of the fleet . Players can designate which parts of a hostile ship they want a crew to target , making ships prone to sustaining authentic damage during a battle : masts can be toppled , sails and gun ports can be destroyed and various other damage can entirely disable a ship 's ability to manoeuvre or eventually sink it . Various types of ammunition can be used during a battle , such as grapeshot , chain @-@ shot and round shot , which have different uses , from killing enemy crew to disabling enemy movement . As battles progress , crews can attempt to board enemy vessels and fight hand @-@ to @-@ hand in an attempt to capture the ship . Lastly , the weather in a naval battle can impact how it is fought ; bad weather can result in effects from poor visibility to endangering a ship 's safety . Ships cannot be repaired in mid @-@ battle unlike its successor , Napoleon : Total War but fires on board ships can be put out automatically . 
 = = = Multiplayer = = = 
 Multiplayer comes in two forms in Empire : Total War . As with previous Total War titles , players can engage in real @-@ time battles against each other either by creating the composition of their armies themselves , or reenacting historical battles . However , following a one @-@ month delay of Empire : Total War in January 2009 , the addition of a full campaign multiplayer mode was unveiled . The technology to create a multiplayer campaign game was not available in previous Total War games , and the extended development time allowed The Creative Assembly to implement the underlying technology for such a mode in Empire : Total War . The campaign multiplayer mode was first tested in a two @-@ player beta build which was released on 7 December 2009 . 
 = = Development = = 
 Empire : Total War was announced by The Creative Assembly and publisher Sega at the Leipzig Games Convention on 22 August 2007 . In their press release , The Creative Assembly outlined various features in the game , such as the new game engine and the addition of real @-@ time naval combat . However , while the game had been in the planning stages since the release of Rome : Total War , it was still in early development ; no gameplay footage was demonstrated at the convention . The game was announced alongside The Creative Assembly 's console title Viking : Battle for Asgard . Media releases over the subsequent months showed screenshots of the game and elaborated more on Empire : Total War 's game mechanics . The game 's trailer , consisting of computer @-@ generated cut scene footage , was released 10 July 2008 . A playable demonstration of the game 's naval combat was showcased at the E3 convention later in July 2008 , where it was estimated that the game would ship in 2009 . The land combat was demonstrated at the later 2008 Leipzig Game Convention in August 2008 . At the convention , The Creative Assembly announced that the game was out of the alpha development phase , and that they were aiming for a release date of 6 February 2009 . 
 On 28 October 2008 , it was announced that the game would be released on Valve Corporation 's content delivery system Steam on the official release date of 6 February ; the game requires Steam to install and run for both retail and electronic versions and is integrated into Valve 's Steamworks programme to allow updates and multiplayer to function more efficiently . The game 's release was delayed in December 2008 to allow for the development of extended multiplayer features , with a new release date for March 2009 . A demonstration of the game , featuring the Battle of Brandywine and the Battle of Lagos , was released over Steam on 20 February 2009 . The game was released on 3 March 2009 . Since release , Empire : Total War has been subject to updates delivered through the Steam system , aimed at optimising performance and removing any bugs remaining in the game . 
 James Russell , the lead designer on the project , stated in an interview that the 18th century was chosen as the setting as " it 's a fabulously colourful period ... the 18th century is the great age of fighting sail , and it 's the obvious arena in which to set our spectacular new sea battles . " Russell also stated that the dynamic and far @-@ reaching changes of the era , from political revolutions such as the French Revolution , economic revolutions such as the Industrial Revolution to military revolutions such as the widespread use of gunpowder , gave the " opportunity to develop some really interesting new features and gameplay dynamics that make for a lot of variation " . Motion capture animation was used extensively to make characters seem more lifelike . For increased authenticity , research was conducted into 18th @-@ century aspects such as duels , although designers also observed the choreography of actors in related films and TV series , such as Sharpe . 
 Empire : Total War ships with nine different versions of box art , eight of which represent the major faction for the market the game is sold in , and one general international version . For instance , German customers are presented artwork displaying colours with the Prussian eagle and Prussian army uniforms , whilst the American artwork shows the American revolutionaries and the Betsy Ross flag . A special edition version of Empire : Total War entitled Special Forces incorporates six elite faction @-@ specific units : HMS Victory , the French Irish Brigade , Spanish guerillas , Gurkha infantry , Rogers ' Rangers and the Ottoman <unk> . Additionally , three retailers were provided with a special unit for customers to receive ; Amazon.com customers were given the Dahomey Amazons , buyers from Best Buy were able to receive the USS Constitution and customers buying from Game received the Death 's Head Hussars . A further 14 units were added with the objective of increasing graphical and unit variety among the factions . These 14 units were released as part of the game 's 1 @.@ 3 patch in June 2009 ; accompanying the update was a second set of 14 units , released as downloadable content for purchase .

 Empire : Total War was released on 3 March 2009 to the North American market , and three days later in Europe . The game has become the fastest selling Total War title to date ; Empire topped British video game sales charts for all platforms in the week of release , the first PC exclusive title to do so in a year and a half . The game was reported to have sold nearly double the number of Rome : Total War and Medieval II : Total War . In the United States , Empire : Total War and its Special Forces edition were ranked as first and second respectively in the PC sales charts for the week of release . The game 's Australian version debuted as the top PC game ; across all platforms Empire : Total War was ranked fourth , behind Halo Wars , Wii Fit and Killzone 2 . Sega reported the game sold 810 @,@ 000 units worldwide during their last fiscal year period of 2008 . However , consumer response was hampered by technical problems arising from incompatibility with certain Nvidia drivers released after the game 's development was completed and reports of installation problems with the Steam content delivery system . In an interview with IGN , Studio Communications Manager Kieran Brigden discussed the problems inherent in developing such a huge and ambitious game , saying : " Are there some issues with Empire ? Yes there are . " As part of its post @-@ release support , he said that The Creative Assembly is planning on addressing issues with stability and performance , as well as adding improvements for gameplay and artificial intelligence . 
 Mike Simpson , The Creative Assembly 's studio director , started a blog in October 2009 , in a deliberate attempt to engage with the game 's user community and counter some of the negative reaction which the game had received . He explained The Creative Assembly " were not entirely happy with the state of Empire : Total War when it went out " , but felt the Metacritic user rating of 67 percent was unfair , stating that his reason for blogging was a concern that the negative ratings could even damage the amount of money available for developing future games . In later posts he described the February 2009 release date as " commercial reality " , and explained why they had hit significant problems with the game 's AI close to release . Simpson describes the campaign AI as " by far the most complex code edifice I ’ ve ever seen in a game " , and said that they had reached a tipping point where consideration of too many factors led to an AI which " disagrees with itself chronically and often ends up paralysed by indecision " . It was only after patch 1 @.@ 5 — six months after the original release — that Simpson felt comfortable sending it to friends of his , having previously been too embarrassed about the flaws . With regard to the battle AI , Simpson said that the lead battle AI programmer had left to return to his family just before the end of the project . The battle AI at that stage struggled to beat good players even with an obvious level of handicapping , and it had taken some time for other programmers to understand three years ' worth of code ; progress had been " frustratingly slow " as they strived for a game where real world tactics would work . 
 = = Expansion = = 
 In September 2009 , an expansion titled The Warpath Campaign was announced for release the following month , as was the next game in the series , Napoleon : Total War . The campaign , released as downloadable content , focuses on the battles of the Europeans and Native Americans throughout most of North and Central America . The new campaign expands the North American territories and features 5 new playable factions : Iroquois , Cherokee , Huron , Pueblo and Plains Nations . New <unk> technologies were also added , along with the new scout and shaman agents and new faction @-@ specific objectives . Napoleon : Total War , released February 2010 , focuses on the life of Napoleon Bonaparte , building upon the technology used for Empire : Total War . Napoleon was released as a standalone game rather than an expansion for a number of reasons , mostly to do with technical limitations ; according to Mike Simpson " the level of detail required to successfully depict the Napoleonic Wars is an order of magnitude greater than we were working to with Empire : Total War " . Empire and Napoleon Total War Collection - Game of the Year was then released on 1 October 2010 joining both games together , including all of the available downloadable content . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Empire : Total War was recipient to a strong critical response within the video game industry , holding aggregate review scores of 88 percent and 90 percent on GameRankings and Metacritic respectively . Reviewers praised the large scope of the game 's strategy map , PC Gamer UK noted that the game " takes a great deal of its design philosophy from the events and trends of its era " , which enabled the game to reasonably reflect the challenges faced by the factions ' historical counterparts . Praise was also given to the extensive number of factions , down to very small factions such as the Knights of St. John and a renegade pirate settlement . Kieron Gillen , reviewing for Eurogamer , described the campaign map as " endless " and due to the large amount of content , observed that he had managed to complete the entire campaign without even visiting the Indian theatre of play ( approximately a full one fourth of the playable game world ) ; a factor that enhanced the game 's replayability . Other reviews echoed this sentiment ; GameSpot stated that " even a short , 50 @-@ year campaign can take a good amount of time to complete , given that each turn requires strategic thinking on multiple fronts " . Praise was further bestowed on the refined interface , introduction of a technology tree and level of strategic thinking required for the campaign map . However , some reviewers noted inconsistent behaviour with the campaign artificial intelligence ; 1UP.com noted that it could perform illogical choices , such as " the occasional suicidal war between Dagestan and Russia " , while GamePro was critical of the artificial intelligence in a number of areas , including the inability to mount a naval invasion or utilise effective strategies on the campaign map . 
 The real @-@ time land battles in Empire were considered well constructed . Expressing that The Creative Assembly had effectively implemented what it had learned since Shogun : Total War , GameSpy described the addition of personal firearms and friendly fire as something that " changes the tactical nature of the game much as it did in real life " , and noting that the player controls and enemy AI were " competent " . IGN felt that the real @-@ time aspects captured " the cinematic brilliance of it all without ever falling back on obvious exaggerations or pretenses " and that the controls , specifically in relation to unit formation , were much improved . GameSpot put the real @-@ time land battles as " enjoyable to command and enjoyable to watch " , particularly commending the amount of detail in each model and animation for every soldier , points carried in several other reviews . However , GameSpot thought that the artificial intelligence could appear " confused " in some circumstances , and the Game Informer " second opinion " review said that " the enemy AI falls apart from time to time " . In addition , Eurogamer felt that units ' pathfinding abilities in fort sieges were insufficient , and Game Informer also criticised pathfinding around obstacles . 
 Naval combat was subject to more criticism than land battles . PC Format described the visuals in a naval battle as " incredible " , but stated that the controls were " frustrating ; genuine naval tactics fast disappear out of the window as [ the player ] struggles to bring [ their ] navy ’ s cannons to bear on the enemy " . PC Gamer UK reciprocated this view , but noted that naval strategy was a " deeply difficult task " for a developer , and that " The Creative Assembly have done the best that their game template would allow " . IGN praised the graphical quality of the naval battles and stated that " trying to line ships up correctly , making the most of the wind and choosing targets appropriately is very rewarding " , but that " the formations and pathfinding leave a lot to be desired " . GameSpot commented that " the AI seems incapable of managing [ a naval battle ] with much success " . 
 Despite criticisms , most reviews were ultimately favourable to Empire : Total War . While IGN felt that the game " drags a bit and there are some small , rough edges in the tactical battles " , the game still " deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the greatest names in gaming history " . 1UP.com finished by saying " For all its problems , it 's undoubtedly progress " , while Eurogamer felt that issues " limit [ the game ] to being merely one of the games of the year , " but implied that a post @-@ release patch could deal with these flaws . GameSpot summarised that the game was " complex and rewarding " and GameSpy praised the game for " the simplified interface elements , great campaign , and much @-@ improved map and information screens [ that ] make this the most accessible Total War yet , and a great place for those unfamiliar with the series to get started " . Crispy Gamer , while acclaiming the game " spectacular " and " lovingly historical " , criticised the documentation and concluded that the game falls apart due to its bad AI . The Game Informer reviewers criticised the AI , but still described the overall game experience as " fantastic " and " outstanding " . GamePro provided a dissenting opinion ; although describing Empire : Total War as a game with a potential that " with some extra tweaking , could have proven itself an excellent title " , noted that it " has a heap of problems that need resolving " with bugs and crashes . PC Gamer UK enthusiastically proclaimed the game as " one of the most playable , important and accomplished games ever created " . 
 The downloadable content The Warpath Campaign was criticised by Strategy Informer for not integrating into the original campaign and for only adding a few new units . Concerns were also voiced about the difficulty curve , though the reviewer felt the DLC provided players a challenge by playing as the technologically backward Native Americans against the European interlopers . Games Radar praised the focus on stealth and new tactics , and was complimentary about the low price of the DLC , but was critical of the campaign 's historical accuracy . 
 = Royal Maundy = 
 Royal Maundy / <unk> / is a religious service in the Church of England held on Maundy Thursday , the day before Good Friday . At the service , the British Monarch or a royal official ceremonially distributes small silver coins known as " Maundy money " ( legally , " the Queen 's Maundy money " ) as symbolic alms to elderly recipients . The coins are legal tender but do not circulate because of their silver content and numismatic value . A small sum of ordinary money is also given in lieu of gifts of clothing and food that the sovereign once bestowed on Maundy recipients . 
 The name " Maundy " and the ceremony itself derive from an instruction , or mandatum , of Jesus Christ at the Last Supper that his followers should love one another . In the Middle Ages , English monarchs washed the feet of beggars in imitation of Jesus , and presented gifts and money to the poor . Over time , additional money was substituted for the clothing and other items that had once been distributed . 
 Beginning in 1699 the monarch did not attend the service , sending an official in his place . The custom of washing the feet did not survive the 18th century . In 1931 Princess Marie Louise was at Royal Maundy , and afterwards suggested that her cousin , King George V , make the distributions the following year , which he did , beginning a new royal custom . Traditionally , the service was held in or near London , in most years in the early 20th century at Westminster Abbey . Today , Queen Elizabeth II almost always attends ( she has been absent only four times in her reign ) , and the service is held in a different church ( usually a cathedral ) every year . Recipients were once chosen for their poverty and were entitled to remain as Maundy recipients for life ; today new recipients are chosen every year for service to their churches or communities , on the recommendation of clergymen of various Christian denominations . Generally , recipients live in the diocese where the service is held , although this was altered for the 2011 and 2012 services . 
 Maundy money is struck in denominations of one penny , two pence , three pence , and four pence . Until the 18th century the coins given were from the circulating coinage , and it was not until the latter half of the century that the four Maundy coins developed as distinct , <unk> pieces . The obverse design of the coins features the reigning monarch . The reverse , with a crowned numeral enclosed by a wreath , derives from a design first used during the reign of William and Mary , and which has been virtually unaltered since 1822 . In most years there are fewer than 2 @,@ 000 complete sets of Maundy money ; they are highly sought after by collectors . 
 = = Origins ; early and medieval history = = 
 The word Maundy derives from the command or mandatum by Christ at the Last Supper , to love one another . The Gospels relate that on the eve of his Crucifixion , Jesus Christ ate a meal with his disciples . After the meal , it is recorded that Jesus washed their feet , and gave them the following mandatum or command : " If I then , your Lord and Master , have washed your feet , ye also ought to wash one another 's feet . For I have given you an example , that ye should do as I have done unto you . " <unk> is the derivation of the word " Maundy " , and the Royal Maundy service evolved from Jesus ' command to his disciples . 
 By the fourth or fifth century a ceremony had been developed following Holy Communion on Maundy Thursday , in which high Church leaders washed the feet of the poor . The ceremony , known as the pedilavium , was performed daily in some monasteries ; in 992 , Bishop Oswald of Worcester died during its performance . 
 The first English monarch to be recorded as distributing alms at a Maundy service was on 15 April 1210 , when John donated garments , forks , food , and other gifts to the poor of Knaresborough , Yorkshire . John is also the first English monarch to be recorded as giving gifts of small silver coins to the poor when in 1213 he gave 13 pence to each of 13 poor men at a ceremony in Rochester — the number being symbolic of the Twelve Apostles together with either Jesus or an angel . Few details of the 13th century Maundy survive ; they are known to have existed from records which show the spending necessary for the gifts to the poor . The monarch was not alone in performing the rituals of the Maundy service ; Henry III 's children assisted him as part of their political and religious training . Henry 's son , Edward I , was the first monarch to keep the Maundy only on or about Maundy Thursday ; before Edward , additional <unk> might be kept during the year . According to Virginia Cole in her study of royal children 's role in the 13th century Maundy , the service had a political purpose as well , as needing to humble himself by doing the pedilavium proclaimed the monarch 's greatness . Attendance at a Maundy service became an obligation for all major European ruling houses . 
 By 1363 the British monarch performed the pedilavium and also gave gifts : that year , fifty @-@ year @-@ old Edward III gave fifty pence to each of fifty poor men . It is not known , however , whether it was as yet the practice each year to have the number of pence and the number of recipients track the monarch 's age : Henry IV was the first monarch to decree that the number of pence given be determined by the monarch 's age . The ceremony was not always performed on Maundy Thursday ; it could be postponed a day to Good Friday by royal command , as it was in 1510 . Nobles could hold their own Maundy distributions , as did Henry Percy , 5th Earl of Northumberland in the early 16th century , according to a contemporary record : " My Lord <unk> and <unk> <unk> uppon the said Maundy Thursday when his <unk> is at home to <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> of <unk> ... with as <unk> <unk> in every purse to as many poore men as his <unk> is <unk> of <unk> and one for the Yere of my Lords <unk> to come . " 
 Although Mary I and Elizabeth I differed religiously , both performed elaborate Maundy ceremonies . Records from 1556 show that Mary washed the feet of forty @-@ one poor women ( reflecting her age ) while " ever on her knees " , and gave them forty @-@ one pence each , as well as gifts of bread , fish , and clothing , donating her own gown to the woman said to be poorest of all . In 1572 disliking the scenes as each woman tried to secure a piece of the royal gown , Queen Elizabeth granted a sum of £ 1 to each recipient in lieu of the gown , giving it in a red purse . Contemporary writer William Lambarde noted that the money was substituted for the gown " to avoid trouble of suite , which <unk> was made for that <unk> " . In years in which plague was rife , the monarch did not attend , sending an official , usually the Lord High Almoner , to make the distributions and perform the pedilavium . Even though scented water was used to disguise any unpleasant odours from the poor , the feet were washed three times before the monarch performed the pedilavium , once by a menial and twice by Court officials . In later years , sweet @-@ smelling nosegays were used to disguise odours — the nosegays are still carried today . 
 = = Post @-@ Restoration = = 
 Charles I rarely attended the Royal Maundy service . Author Brian Robinson , who traced the development of Royal Maundy , suggests that after the Restoration , his son Charles II attempted to gain popularity by assiduous attendance ( and distribution of money ) at the service . Charles II even attended during the plague years of 1661 and 1663 . His brother and successor , James II performed the ceremony as well . Although there is a record of William III doing so in 1698 , most sources state that James was the last to wash the feet of the poor himself , in 1685 . There is no record of any attendance by a monarch at the Royal Maundy ceremony after 1698 until 1932 , but pre @-@ 1725 records are vague . The Lord High Almoner continued to perform the pedilavium at the Maundy ceremony until 1737 . Today , the only traces of the pedilavium at Royal Maundy are the nosegays and the linen towels worn by several of the officials . 
 The service was usually held somewhere near London . This was done to suit the monarch 's convenience : in medieval times , it was held in Windsor , Eton , Richmond , Greenwich , or wherever the monarch happened to be at <unk> . In 1714 , with the monarch no longer present at the ceremony , the service was moved to the Chapel Royal , Whitehall , where it remained until 1890 , when the Chapel was given to the Royal United Services Institute . After 1890 , by order of Queen Victoria , it was moved to Westminster Abbey , though in years when there was a Coronation and the Abbey was closed for preparations , the service was held at St. Paul 's Cathedral . From 1954 to 1970 , it was held in even @-@ numbered years at Westminster , and in odd @-@ numbered years at provincial cathedrals ; since then it has , in most years , been held outside London . When the service was confined to London , recipients were customarily householders who had met their financial obligations to society , but had since fallen on hard times . 
 The number of recipients continued to track the monarch 's age . Until the joint reign of William and Mary , the recipients were of the same sex as the monarch . During that reign , each of the monarchs made gifts to poor people of their sex , but after the death of Mary , only men received gifts from King William . Beginning with the reign of George I ( 1714 – 1727 ) , both men and women have received gifts , each sex in a number corresponding to the monarch 's age , each recipient receiving that number of pence . Despite the monarch 's absence , the ceremony was held each year , with the Lord High Almoner or the Sub @-@ Almoner deputising for the sovereign . 
 The gift of clothing was eliminated for women beginning in 1724 , as the recipients immediately tried on the gifts and exchanged ill @-@ fitting ones with each other , a practice thought unseemly in a church . The women were instead given 35 shillings ( decimalised as £ 1 @.@ 75 ) . For men , the clothing gift was replaced by woollen cloth that year . Men continued to be given cloth until 1883 , when royal officials realised that many of the recipients were too poor to have the cloth made into garments and were instead selling it . Men were given 45 shillings ( decimalised as £ 2 @.@ 25 ) in lieu of the cloth , an amount increased in 1973 to £ 3 for both men and women . 
 There is a record of the 1802 Royal Maundy ; it notes that the recipients were given 4 pounds ( 1 @.@ 8 kg ) of beef and four <unk> loaves . After the 1837 Maundy , King William IV ordered that as the recipients were selling the food gift for less than its full value — they were to be given 30 shillings in food which was sometimes sold by the recipients for as little as five shillings — it was to be replaced by a money gift of 30 shillings . This amount ( decimalised into £ 1 @.@ 50 ) , is still given . The same year , a report on the Civil List written for the House of Commons proposed eliminating the Royal Maundy : " Considering that the sum distributed annually as alms and charity is applied in a manner suited rather to ancient than modern times and is attended with some expense , it may not be inexpedient to consider whether the purpose of the Royal benevolence might not be more fully attained if some other and better mode of distribution were adopted . " King William 's death at the age of 71 that year and the accession of 18 @-@ year @-@ old Queen Victoria resulted in a dramatic drop in the number of Maundy recipients . As at that time , a Maundy recipient continued in that status for life , the surplus recipients were placed on waiting lists , and given royal charity through other means . One vacancy occurred a week before the 1838 Maundy when recipient Elizabeth Love died at the age of 110 . 
 In 1843 , The Illustrated London News described a Maundy ceremony : 
 On the day alluded to a certain number of poor men and women , of each the exact number of our sovereign 's age , attends divine worship in the Royal Chapel , Whitehall in the morning and afternoon . Bread , meat and fish is distributed to them in large wooden bowls , and a procession formed of the royal almoner or sub @-@ almoner , with other officers , who are decorated with white scarfs and sashes , and each carrying a bouquet of flowers ; one of the officers supports a large gold dish or salver , on which are placed small red and white leather bags , the red containing a sovereign , the white the pieces ... termed Maundy Money . One of each of these bags is given to the persons selected to receive the royal bounty ; they have likewise given to them cloth , linen , shoes & c . , as well as a small maple cup , out of which previous to the termination of the ceremony they drink the Queen 's health ... These small pieces are , by an order of Government declared current coins of the realm , therefore no one dare refuse to take them if offered in payment , still they are not in reality intended for that purpose . 
 The drinking of the monarch 's health , which is believed to have originated with the custom of the loving cup , was abolished in the 19th century , though the exact date is uncertain . In the early 20th century , members of the Royal Family sometimes attended the Royal Maundy service — Queen Alexandra twice was present . Most Royal Maundy ceremonies in the first part of the century were attended by Princess Helena or by her daughter Princess Marie Louise . In 1931 , Marie Louise was present at Royal Maundy and suggested , after the service , that her cousin King George V make the distributions the following year . King George did so in 1932 , the only time he was at the service during his reign . In 1936 , the year of King George 's death , the new king , Edward VIII made the distribution . George VI ( who succeeded King Edward on his abdication late in 1936 ) did not attend until 1940 , and then not again until 1944 , his place being taken in most years by the Lord High Almoner , Cosmo Gordon Lang , Archbishop of Canterbury . Queen Elizabeth II has been present for all but four Royal Maundy services of her long reign . She was absent twice following childbirth , and twice because she was visiting other parts of the Commonwealth . She first attended Royal Maundy as Princess Elizabeth of York in 1935 . Until 1956 a recipient once chosen for the Maundy service had the right to continue to be a recipient for life . In 1957 , with the service leaving London for the first time in over two centuries ( it was held in 1957 at St. Albans ) , this became impractical and it was decided that , in future years , recipients would attend once only . To honour the promise to the surviving lifetime appointees , they were given the opportunity to attend whenever the service was held in London , and were sent an equivalent sum by post in years when it was not . 
 = = Royal Maundy today = = 
 Queen Elizabeth II views the service as an important part of her devotional life . It is the only occasion on which the Queen visits others to make awards , as recipients of honours usually come to her . According to Ronald Allison and Sarah Riddell in their The Royal Encyclopedia , the service " has become the occasion of a royal pilgrimage to different parts of the country " . The Queen has directed that the service not be held in London more often than once in ten years . Westminster Abbey was the site of the 2001 Royal Maundy , and again in 2011 , the first ever televised . 
 Today the recipients are pensioners , chosen on an interdenominational basis from various Christian churches for their service to their churches and communities . In most years , recipients are nominated by Christian clergy of various denominations in the diocese where the service is held . In 2011 , however , as well as recipients representing Westminster Abbey , forty recipients came from the Anglican Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe , which covers continental Europe , and forty from the Diocese of Sodor and Man , which consists of the Isle of Man . Robert Patterson , Bishop of Sodor and Man , while at a conference of Anglican bishops had invited the Queen to his cathedral for Maundy services ; he received word that this would be too difficult , but that his diocese could nominate recipients . For 2012 , in honour of the Queen 's Diamond Jubilee , recipients were selected from all 44 dioceses in the United Kingdom for the service at York Minster . 
 The Yeomen of the Guard are present at the ceremony and serve as " Indoor Guard " ; the choir of the Chapel Royal is also present . Six <unk> , whose original function is uncertain , guide the recipients to their places and render any other help which is needed . Present at the ceremony are four Maundy Children ( formally " Children of the Royal <unk> " ) , two boys and two girls . The original Maundy Children were four old men , charity recipients , whose sole duty was to attend at the Royal Maundy service wearing linen scarves . As their fees for the service amounted to over twenty pounds per year , this was deemed an abuse of charity , and in 1808 the old men were pensioned off and replaced by actual children . The first children appointed from 1808 did not personally attend the service , but their parents received five guineas per year to aid in their education until the age of fourteen , and four other children , from schools in the City of Westminster represented them at the service . Today , the Maundy Children are chosen from religious and state schools , and receive a set of Maundy coins for their participation . Officials in the Maundy service wear towels over their clothing , worn over the shoulder and tied at the waist . The linen towels were once retained by their wearers , but since 1883 , the same towels , laundered each year , have been used . 
 Until 1979 , the Queen made two distributions of money in leather purses to each recipient . The first distribution , given to women in green purses and to men in white , was of an allowance in lieu of the clothing formerly given . The white purses used for the clothing allowance may be distinguished from the white purses which contained Maundy money , as the former was tied with a short green string ; the latter bears a long red string . The clothing allowance purses had been introduced in 1936 ; prior to that , the clothing allowance was distributed in a paper packet . In the second distribution two purses were given by the monarch ; the red one contained £ 1 @.@ 50 for provisions , once given in kind , and the additional sum of £ 1 mandated by Elizabeth I. The white purses contained the Maundy money . After 1979 , the separate distribution of the clothing allowance was discontinued — the gifts have now been consolidated , and recipients now receive two purses in a single distribution , one white containing the Maundy coins , and one red containing the other money . The distributions were consolidated so as to reduce the physical strain of the ceremony on the Queen as she aged . The red purse contains £ 1 representing the money for redemption of the monarch 's gown , £ 3 in lieu of the clothing once given , and £ 1 @.@ 50 in place of the food once presented , totalling £ 5 @.@ 50 . In 2015 , for the ceremony at Sheffield Cathedral , the £ 5 @.@ 50 not given in Maundy money took the form of a £ 5 coin commemorating the 50th anniversary of the death of Sir Winston Churchill and a 50p piece for the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain . 
 One man and one woman are chosen for each year the Queen has lived ( including the year she is currently living ) , and they receive Maundy money equivalent in pence to that number of years . Recipients attend a " Maundy Lecture " in the cathedral in advance of the service to familiarise them with what will happen . The cathedral is designated the Royal Chapel for the day of the service , and the Royal Standard flies . The purses are carried into the church by the Yeomen on silver dishes , held above their heads . The origin of this custom is uncertain but apparently dates from the times when provisions were distributed to the poor ; some experts believe the dishes were carried high to stop the poor from grabbing at the food prematurely ; others believe that the position was to prevent the congregation from being overwhelmed by the smell of fish . 
 The Order of Service for Royal Maundy is a simple one . It begins with the reading of John 13 : 34 , which contains the mandatum from which Royal Maundy evolved . It contains two lessons , the first of which ( John 13 ) also recalls the mandatum . The second reading contains that portion of Matthew 25 which describes the Last Judgment . The Queen makes half of the presentations after the first lesson , and half after the second . Anthems , led by the Chapel Royal choir and the local choir , are sung while the distribution is going on , concluding with George Frideric Handel 's coronation anthem Zadok the Priest . The Royal Maundy service concludes with prayers , " God Save the Queen " and the blessing . Two hymns are sung ; there is no address . Six silver dishes are used to hold the gifts ; one , the traditional Maundy Dish , forms part of the Royal Regalia and is held at the Tower of London when not in use . All six dishes date from the reign of Charles II ; five of the six have been added to the service since 1971 . They are held by the Yeomen as the Queen walks about , greeting recipients and giving them their gifts . The Lord High Almoner receives his only recompense for his position if he attends the Royal Maundy service — a small fee , though payable in Maundy money . 
 The Pope still performs the pedilavium , as does the Archbishop of Canterbury . In recent years , the pedilavium has become more popular across Christian denominations , and even as a gesture of humility among those serving the poor . Today , the Royal Maundy ceremony involves a considerable security operation , with drains in the area checked . Two 17 @-@ year @-@ old boys were arrested in Wakefield in 2005 for popping balloons in the area of the service ; as the sound might be mistaken for gunfire . 
 The Queen interacts informally with the Maundy recipients , it is said , some of whom have given her gifts in return — one participant handed her a jar of marmalade . Mercia Tapsell , a 71 @-@ year @-@ old Maundy recipient who participated in the 1992 ceremony at Chester for her work with the Salvation Army , spoke of the ceremony before her death in July of that year : 
 It surpassed anything that I ever thought . I didn 't ever think that I should be in the cathedral with the Queen and all the dignitaries that were there . And the singing , the organ , the Queen , just everything and everybody . It 's really been out of this world . Just to hear Zadok the Priest , I think , has lifted me to Cloud Nine , because it 's something that I love . And to hear that and to have the Queen pass so close to me . And yes , she smiled . She smiled at me .

 Sets of 1d ( one penny ) to 4d silver coins are known from the time of Charles II onwards . However , as there is no record of any denomination higher than 1d ( then struck for circulation in silver ) being used in the Maundy gift before 1731 , sets from before then are most likely ordinary circulation strikes . At that time , coins used for the Maundy money distribution were indistinguishable from those struck for circulation . It was not until 1752 that coins not struck for circulation were used for the Maundy distribution . At times when little silver was being struck by the Royal Mint , the coins distributed might bear a previous year 's date . To evade statutory prohibitions on the striking of silver coin during the Napoleonic Wars , all Maundy pieces issued from 1800 to 1815 bear the date 1800 , though most were struck later . When the date was finally changed in 1816 , after the prohibition ended , the size of the coins was slightly reduced , as the Royal Mint increased the amount struck from one troy pound of sterling silver from 62 to 66 shillings of silver coin . The last year in which no Maundy coins were struck was 1821 . 
 In 1689 , the Royal Mint began using a design for the reverse of the four low @-@ denomination silver coins depicting a crowned numeral . The designer is unknown ( Richard Lobel , in his catalogue of British coins , suggests the artist was George Bower , an employee of the Royal Mint whose medals bear similar characteristics ) but his work has endured , in a revised form , for over 300 years . In 1822 an amended reverse was introduced , and has been struck every year since then in all four denominations . The 1822 reverse design , which places the crowned numeral within an oak wreath , was created by Jean Baptiste <unk> . This design is still struck each year , though the crown was altered in 1888 , as was the appearance of the numeral " 2 " on the twopence . These changes were made by Royal Mint engraver Leonard Charles <unk> . A proposal by the Royal Mint in 1950 to return to the pre @-@ 1888 " 2 " as more artistic was refused by George VI , who felt the current numeral was stylistically similar to the numerals on the other coins , and the pre @-@ 1888 " 2 " was not . 
 Beginning in 1834 , threepence ( 3d ) pieces were struck for circulation , bearing the same design as the Maundy 3d . The circulation pieces were initially struck for use in the West Indies , but beginning in 1845 , were coined for use in Britain as well . Many of the 3d pieces presented to impoverished Maundy recipients were spent , and these are rarer than the other values today . Maundy 3ds may sometimes be distinguished from currency 3ds as dies with a more polished field were used for the Maundy pieces . The design of the circulation 3d remained the same as that of the Maundy 3d until 1928 , when a new design was introduced for the circulating coins . <unk> coins identical to Maundy pieces , intended for colonial use , were struck in 1838 , 1843 , and 1848 . 
 The original composition of the coins was sterling ( 0 @.@ 925 ) silver . In common with all British silver coins , the fineness was reduced to 0 @.@ 500 in 1921 . In 1947 silver was removed from all circulating British coinage in favour of cupronickel , but as it was felt to be inappropriate to strike Maundy coins in base metal , their fineness was restored to 0 @.@ 925 . On Decimal Day , 15 February 1971 , the pound sterling became decimalised , with 100 new pence instead of 20 shillings of 12 pence ( 240 pence ) in a pound . No change was made to the design of the Maundy pieces , and all Maundy pieces , both pre- and post @-@ Decimal Day , are by law deemed denominated in new pence , more than doubling the face value of the pre @-@ 1971 pieces . The Maundy pieces continue to use the original obverse design for Queen Elizabeth II by Mary Gillick , although the bust of the Queen on other British coins has been repeatedly replaced as she ages . At the time of decimalisation , the Royal Mint Advisory Commission recommended the retention out of affection for the Gillick design ; this was accepted by the Queen . 
 = = = Distribution and resale = = = 
 In the 19th century , as many as sixty times the number of pieces needed for the ceremony were struck , due to public interest in the ceremony and the pieces . Beginning in 1846 , Queen Victoria requested pieces for her private use , as much as £ 10 ( 2 @,@ 400 pence ) per year . Many sets were purchased by coin dealers , others by Mint officials as gifts . Small quantities of Maundy <unk> and <unk> ( principally the latter ) were obtained by colleges at the University of Cambridge for use in making token annual payments . These requests were fulfilled until the middle of the 20th century , after which the Royal Mint refused them ; the colleges thereafter used obsolete circulation groats ( <unk> ) , or dispensed with the custom . 
 According to Robinson , the practice of recipients being asked to sell their gifts " is of long standing " . Robinson recounts a description of the scenes after a Maundy service at the turn of the 19th century : 
 [ A ] s soon as the service is over , crowds of buyers flock eagerly around the old people , who take a price for their coins . The rate they usually charge is four or five times the face value of the coins . The purses are sometimes disposed of at from one to two shillings each , depending on the market . 
 By 1897 , Maundy recipients were being urged to sell the small pieces at a premium ; there are tales of Americans paying high prices for a set that year , wanting a souvenir of Victoria 's Diamond Jubilee . 
 In 1903 , the Royal Mint made its first effort to cut back on the number of pieces distributed , eliminating 200 Mint workers ( principally <unk> and labourers ) from the distribution list . Until 1908 Maundy sets could be ordered through banks . Beginning in 1909 , however , distribution of the pieces was restricted to Maundy recipients and certain officials . Mintage of sets of Maundy money dropped from 9 @,@ 929 in 1908 to 2 @,@ 428 the following year . By 1932 , Maundy recipients were routinely selling the coins to dealers at a premium . There was little official response to this until the 1960s , when questions were asked in the House of Lords after the press reported that recipients were being approached by dealers after the service and being offered cash for their gifts . In response , the Royal Mint decreased the number of sets available to officials , though Royal Mint employees of long service are offered the opportunity , every few years , to purchase a set . A number of sets are used as prizes for students at Westminster School , a practice said to have begun with Elizabeth I , though this now occurs only in years when the service is held at Westminster Abbey . Sets distributed by the Royal Mint in these ways are not given in purses , but in presentation cases . 
 In recent years , approximately 1 @,@ 600 – 1 @,@ 900 sets have been minted . Additional sets have been struck for inclusion in special silver proof sets marketed by the Royal Mint in 1996 , 2000 and 2006 , with a special issue in gold as part of a gold proof set in 2002 . Individual Maundy recipients have realised as much as £ 100 per set of four pieces by selling them on eBay .

 " There 's No Disgrace Like Home " is the fourth episode of The Simpsons ' first season . It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 28 , 1990 . In the episode , Homer becomes ashamed of his family after a catastrophic company picnic and decides to enroll them in therapy . The therapist struggles to solve their problems but eventually gives up and refunds their payment . 
 It was an early episode , showing early designs for a few recurring characters . The episode is inspired by the comedy of Laurel and Hardy and features cultural references to films such as Citizen Kane and Freaks as well as the Batman and Twilight Zone television series . Critics noted that the characters acted differently from the way they would in later seasons . In November 1996 , The BBC chose it as the first episode to be aired , when they started showing the series , later being beat in the ratings by Sabrina . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Homer takes his family to a company picnic organized by his boss , Mr. Burns , and hopes they will not embarrass him . After Bart , Lisa and Marge all misbehave , Homer is embarrassed by their behavior . Later on , he notices that Burns is drawn to a " normal " family that treats one another with respect and shows his blatant disgust for his own family . Homer wonders why he is cursed with a troubled family who misbehave and disrespects anyone , especially after the man from the normal perfect family admits he pities Homer . 
 Determined to improve his family 's behavior , Homer attempts to get them to sit at the table properly , which goes awry as the family prefers to eat while watching TV . When Marge , Bart and Lisa claim there 's nothing wrong with them , he decides to prove to them that there is something wrong . He takes them on a tour of the neighborhood , peeking through living room windows to observe how happy families spend time together . The rest of the Simpsons are unnerved by Homer 's sudden rash behavior along with unnecessarily spying on their neighbors and retreat quickly back to the safety of their own home . Depressed by the outing , he stops by Moe 's Tavern for a drink . After getting into a fight with Barney , Homer later sees a commercial for Dr. Marvin Monroe 's Family Therapy Center . Dr. Monroe guarantees " family bliss or double your money back . " This gives Homer an idea to improve his family 's behavior . 
 Homer makes an appointment at the clinic and pays for it by pawning their television . This only frustrates the rest of the Simpsons as he takes them to the scheduled appointment . In the waiting room , they claim the family doesn 't have a problem and are silenced by Homer . Dr. Monroe encourages them to express their unhappiness with a series of exercises . The first is a drawing exercise , which he encourages them to draw out the source of their problems . Most the Simpsons vent out their anger by drawing Homer as they see him . When Dr. Monroe observes it , he realizes that Homer is likely the source of their issues in the family . This is evident when he proves his own inattentive nature in being lost in the exercise and having the family view him as such , including being too strict as a disciplinarian . The other methods in getting the family to talk to each other in a normal matter fails . Dr. Monroe finally takes matters into his own hands and sends them all to a generator room , allowing them to deliver electric shocks to each other . The family shocks one another to the point of causing a power drain on the city . Unable to help them , Dr. Monroe gives the Simpsons double their money back . With a fresh sense of family unity , they use the money to buy a new television set . 
 = = Production = = 
 The episode shows telltale signs of being one of the earliest produced . The characters act completely differently from later seasons ; Lisa , for example , is an undisciplined brat , Marge gets drunk and is inattentive , while Homer is the voice of reason . These roles are reversed in later episodes . It was an early episode for Mr. Burns , who was voiced by Christopher Collins in the previous episode , " Homer 's Odyssey " . Originally , the character was influenced by Ronald Reagan , a concept which was later dropped . The idea that he would greet his employees using index cards was inspired by the way Reagan would greet people . The episode marks the first time Burns refers to " releasing the hounds " . 
 The episode marked the first appearance of Dr. Marvin Monroe and Itchy & Scratchy ; the latter had previously appeared in the shorts . It also marked the first appearance of yellow Smithers , who was drawn as an African @-@ American in the previous episode . Eddie and Lou also appeared for the first time , although Lou was mistakenly animated with yellow instead of black , as he would later become . Lou was named after Lou Whitaker , a former Major League Baseball player . 
 The idea behind the shock therapy scene was based on Laurel and Hardy throwing pies at each other . The scene was rearranged in the editing room ; it played out differently when first produced . The edits to this scene were preliminary , but well @-@ received , and remained unchanged in the finished product . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The episode 's title is a parody of the famous phrase " There 's no place like Home " from " Home ! Sweet Home ! " , an 1823 song by Henry Bishop and John Howard Payne . The scene in which the family enters Burns ' Manor contains two cultural references . The Manor resembles Charles Foster Kane 's mansion from the 1941 film Citizen Kane . The characters refer to it as " stately Burns Manor " , a reference to the Batman TV series . In addition , there is a reference to Freaks , the Tod Browning cult horror film , in the repetition of the line " one of us " . When Marge gets drunk , she sings Dean Martin 's " Hey , Brother , Pour the Wine " . 
 The shock therapy scene is reminiscent of the 1971 film A Clockwork Orange . The shock therapy scene appeared in the 1990 film Die Hard 2 . 
 The Paul Mauriat version of the 1967 song L 'amour est bleu can be briefly heard in the episode .

It was the second highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week , following Married ... with Children . Since airing , the episode has received mixed reviews from television critics . The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , note : " It 's very strange to see Homer pawning the TV set in an attempt to save the family ; if this episode had come later Marge would surely have taken this stance . " 
 They continue , " A neat swipe at family counseling with some great set pieces ; we 're especially fond of the perfect version of the Simpsons and the electric @-@ shock aversion therapy . " In a DVD review of the first season , David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 2 @.@ 0 / 5 @.@ 0 , placing it as one of the worst of the season . Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that the episode is " [ his ] least favorite episode of Season One " and further commented : " Homer feels embarrassed by the others ? Marge acts poorly in public and doesn ’ t care about the upkeep of the family ? Lisa ( Yeardley Smith ) engages in pranks and silliness ? This ain ’ t the family we ’ ve grown to know and love . " 
 This episode was one of the first seen by British viewers . It was the first episode to be broadcast on terrestrial television by the BBC on November 23 , 1996 on a Saturday at 5 : 30pm , because the episodes were shown out of order . The episode was screened with five million viewers , slightly less than the show , Dad 's Army , which previously held the timeslot . The episode also faced competition from ITV 's screening of Sabrina the Teenage Witch .

 = Rhyolite , Nevada = 
 Rhyolite is a ghost town in Nye County , in the U.S. state of Nevada . It is in the Bullfrog Hills , about 120 miles ( 190 km ) northwest of Las Vegas , near the eastern edge of Death Valley . The town began in early 1905 as one of several mining camps that sprang up after a prospecting discovery in the surrounding hills . During an ensuing gold rush , thousands of gold @-@ seekers , developers , miners and service providers flocked to the Bullfrog Mining District . Many settled in Rhyolite , which lay in a sheltered desert basin near the region 's biggest producer , the Montgomery Shoshone Mine . 
 Industrialist Charles M. Schwab bought the Montgomery Shoshone Mine in 1906 and invested heavily in infrastructure , including piped water , electric lines and railroad transportation , that served the town as well as the mine . By 1907 , Rhyolite had electric lights , water mains , telephones , newspapers , a hospital , a school , an opera house , and a stock exchange . Published estimates of the town 's peak population vary widely , but scholarly sources generally place it in a range between 3 @,@ 500 and 5 @,@ 000 in 1907 – 08 . 
 Rhyolite declined almost as rapidly as it rose . After the richest ore was exhausted , production fell . The 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the financial panic of 1907 made it more difficult to raise development capital . In 1908 , investors in the Montgomery Shoshone Mine , concerned that it was overvalued , ordered an independent study . When the study 's findings proved unfavorable , the company 's stock value crashed , further restricting funding . By the end of 1910 , the mine was operating at a loss , and it closed in 1911 . By this time , many out @-@ of @-@ work miners had moved elsewhere , and Rhyolite 's population dropped well below 1 @,@ 000 . By 1920 , it was close to zero . 
 After 1920 , Rhyolite and its ruins became a tourist attraction and a setting for motion pictures . Most of its buildings crumbled , were salvaged for building materials , or were moved to nearby Beatty or other towns , although the railway depot and a house made chiefly of empty bottles were repaired and preserved . From 1988 to 1998 , three companies operated a profitable open @-@ pit mine at the base of Ladd Mountain , about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) south of Rhyolite . The Goldwell Open Air Museum lies on private property just south of the ghost town , which is on property overseen by the Bureau of Land Management . 
 = = Names = = 
 The town is named for rhyolite , an igneous rock composed of light @-@ colored silicates , usually buff to pink and occasionally light gray . It belongs to the same rock class , felsic , as granite but is much less common . The Amargosa River , which flows through nearby Beatty , gets its name from the Spanish word for " bitter " , <unk> . In its course , the river takes up large amounts of salts , which give it a bitter taste . 
 " Bullfrog " was the name Frank " Shorty " Harris and Ernest " Ed " Cross , the prospectors who started the Bullfrog gold rush , gave to their mine . As quoted by Robert D. McCracken in A History of Beatty , Nevada , Harris said during a 1930 interview for <unk> magazine , " The rock was green , almost like turquoise , spotted with big chunks of yellow metal , and looked a lot like the back of a frog . " The Bullfrog Mining District , the Bullfrog Hills , the town of Bullfrog , and other geographical entities in the region took their name from the Bullfrog Mine . 
 " Bullfrog " became so popular that Giant Bullfrog , Bullfrog Merger , Bullfrog Apex , Bullfrog Annex , Bullfrog Gold Dollar , Bullfrog Mogul , and most of the district 's other 200 or so mining companies included " Bullfrog " in their names . The name persisted and , decades later , was given to the short @-@ lived Bullfrog County . 
 Beatty is named after " Old Man " Montillus ( Montillion ) Murray Beatty , a Civil War veteran and miner who bought a ranch along the Amargosa River just north of what became the town of Beatty . In 1906 , he sold the ranch to the Bullfrog Water , Power , and Light Company . " Shoshone " in " Montgomery Shoshone Mine " refers to the Western Shoshone people indigenous to the region . In about 1875 , the Shoshone had six camps along the Amargosa River near Beatty . The total population of these camps was 29 , and because game was scarce , they subsisted largely on seeds , bulbs and plants gathered throughout the region , including the Bullfrog Hills . 
 = = Geology = = 
 The Bullfrog Hills are at the western edge of the southwestern Nevada volcanic field . <unk> faulted volcanic rocks , ranging in age from about 13 @.@ 3 million years to about 7 @.@ 6 million years , overlie the region 's Paleozoic sedimentary rocks . The prevailing rocks , which contain the ore deposits , are a series of rhyolitic lava flows that built to a combined thickness of about 8 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 400 m ) above the more ancient rock . After the flows ceased , tectonic stresses fractured the area into many separate fault blocks . Most of these blocks tilt to the east , and the horizontal banding of individual flows shows clearly on their western scarps . Within the blocks , the ore deposits tend to occur in nearly vertical mineralized faults or fault zones in the rhyolite . Most of the lodes in the Bullfrog Hills are not simple veins but rather fissure zones with many stringers of vein material . 
 = = Geography and climate = = 
 Rhyolite is at the northern end of the Amargosa Desert in Nye County in the U.S. state of Nevada . Nestled in the Bullfrog Hills , about 120 miles ( 190 km ) northwest of Las Vegas , it is about 60 miles ( 97 km ) south of Goldfield , and 90 miles ( 140 km ) south of Tonopah . Roughly 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) to the east lie Beatty and the Amargosa River . To the west , roughly 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) from Rhyolite , the Funeral and Grapevine Mountains of the Amargosa Range rise between the Amargosa Desert in Nevada and Death Valley in California . State Route 374 , passing about 0 @.@ 75 miles ( 1 @.@ 21 km ) south of Rhyolite , links Beatty to Death Valley via Daylight Pass . Rhyolite is about 25 miles ( 40 km ) west of Yucca Mountain and the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository , which is adjacent to the Nevada Test Site . 
 Bordered on three sides by ridges but open to the south , the ghost town is at 3 @,@ 800 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) above sea level . The high points of the ridges are Ladd Mountain to the east , Sutherland Mountain to the west , and Busch Peak to the north . Sawtooth Mountain , the highest point in the Bullfrog Hills , rises to 6 @,@ 002 feet ( 1 @,@ 829 m ) above sea level about 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) northwest of Rhyolite . The hills form a barrier between the Amargosa Desert and <unk> Flat to the north . Most of the primary mining communities in the Beatty – Rhyolite area during the gold @-@ rush boom of 1904 – 08 were either in or on the edge of the Bullfrog Hills . Of these and many smaller towns and camps in the Bullfrog district , only Beatty survived as a populated place . Prior to its demise , the rival town of Bullfrog lay about 0 @.@ 75 miles ( 1 @.@ 21 km ) southwest of Rhyolite , and the Montgomery Shoshone Mine was on the north side of Montgomery Mountain , about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) northeast of Rhyolite . 
 Nevada 's main climatic features are bright sunshine , low annual precipitation , heavy snowfall in the higher mountains , clean , dry air , and large daily temperature ranges . Strong surface heating occurs by day and rapid cooling by night , and usually even the hottest days have cool nights . The average percentage of possible sunshine in southern Nevada is more than 80 percent . Sunshine and low humidity in this region account for an average evaporation , as measured in evaporation pans , of more than 100 inches ( 2 @,@ 500 mm ) of water a year . 
 Beatty , about 500 feet ( 150 m ) lower in elevation than Rhyolite , receives only about 6 inches ( 152 mm ) of precipitation a year . July is the hottest month in Beatty , when the average high temperature is 97 ° F ( 36 ° C ) and the average low is 61 ° F ( 16 ° C ) . December and January are the coolest months with an average high of 54 ° F ( 12 ° C ) and an average low of 27 ° F ( − 3 ° C ) in December and 28 ° F ( − 2 ° C ) in January . Rhyolite is high enough in the hills to have relatively cool summers , and it has relatively mild winters . However , it is far from sources of water .

 On August 9 , 1904 , Cross and Harris found gold on the south side of a southwestern Nevada hill later called Bullfrog Mountain . <unk> of ore samples from the site suggested values up to $ 3 @,@ 000 a ton , or about $ 79 @,@ 000 a ton in 2016 dollars when adjusted for inflation . Word of the discovery spread to Tonopah and beyond , and soon thousands of hopeful prospectors and speculators rushed to what became known as the Bullfrog Mining District . 
 Within the district , gold rush settlements quickly arose near the mines , and Rhyolite became the largest . It sprang up near the most promising discovery , the Montgomery Shoshone Mine , which in February 1905 produced ores assayed as high as $ 16 @,@ 000 a ton , equivalent to $ 421 @,@ 000 a ton in 2016 . Starting as a two @-@ man camp in January 1905 , Rhyolite became a town of 1 @,@ 200 people in two weeks and reached a population of 2 @,@ 500 by June 1905 . By then it had 50 saloons , 35 gambling tables , cribs for prostitution , 19 lodging houses , 16 restaurants , half a dozen barbers , a public bath house , and a weekly newspaper , the Rhyolite Herald . Four daily stage coaches connected Goldfield , 60 miles ( 97 km ) to the north , and Rhyolite . Rival auto lines ferried people between Rhyolite and Goldfield and the rail station in Las Vegas in Pope @-@ <unk> , White Steamers , and other touring cars . 
 Ernest Alexander " Bob " Montgomery , the original owner , and his partners sold the mine to industrialist Charles M. Schwab in February 1906 . Schwab expanded the operation on a grand scale , hiring workers , opening new tunnels and drifts , and building a huge mill to process the ore . He had water piped in , paid to have an electric line run 100 miles ( 160 km ) from a hydroelectric plant at the foot of the Sierras to Rhyolite , and contracted with the Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad to run a spur line to the mine . Three railroads eventually served Rhyolite . The first was the Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad ( <unk> ) , which began running regular trains to the city on December 14 , 1906 . Its depot , built in California @-@ mission style , cost about $ 130 @,@ 000 , equivalent to about $ 3 @,@ 420 @,@ 000 in 2016 . About a half @-@ year later , the Bullfrog Goldfield Railroad ( <unk> ) began regular service from the north . By December 1907 , the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad ( TTR ) began service to Rhyolite on tracks leased from the <unk> . The TTR was built to reach the borax @-@ bearing colemanite beds in Death Valley as well as the gold fields . 
 By 1907 , about 4 @,@ 000 people lived in Rhyolite , according to Richard E. <unk> in Death Valley & the Amargosa : A Land of Illusion . Russell R. Elliott cites an estimated population of 5 @,@ 000 in 1907 – 08 in Nevada 's Twentieth @-@ Century Mining Boom , noting that " accurate population figures during the boom are impossible to obtain " . Alan H. Patera in Rhyolite : The Boom Years states published estimates of the peak population have been " as high as 6 @,@ 000 or 8 @,@ 000 , but the town itself never claimed more than 3 @,@ 500 through its newspapers " . The newspapers estimated that 6 @,@ 000 people lived in the Bullfrog mining district , which included the towns of Rhyolite , Bullfrog , Gold Center , and Beatty as well as camps at the major mines . 
 Rhyolite in 1907 had concrete sidewalks , electric lights , water mains , telephone and telegraph lines , daily and weekly newspapers , a monthly magazine , police and fire departments , a hospital , school , train station and railway depot , at least three banks , a stock exchange , an opera house , a public swimming pool and two formal church buildings . Most prominent was the three @-@ story John S. Cook and Co . Bank on Golden Street . Finished in 1908 , it cost more than $ 90 @,@ 000 , equivalent to $ 2 @,@ 370 @,@ 000 in 2016 . Much of the cost went for Italian marble stairs , imported stained @-@ glass windows , and other luxuries . The building housed brokerage offices , and a post office , as well as the bank . Other large buildings included the train depot , the three @-@ story Overbury Block , and the two @-@ story eight @-@ room school . A miner named Tom T. Kelly built the Bottle House in February 1906 from 50 @,@ 000 discarded beer and liquor bottles . Another building housed the Rhyolite Mining Stock Exchange , which opened on March 25 , 1907 , with 125 members , including brokers from New York , Philadelphia , Los Angeles , and other large cities . The small , modestly equipped storefront listed shares of 74 Bullfrog companies and a similar number of companies in nearby mining districts . Sixty thousand shares changed hands on the first day , and by the end of the second week the number had topped 750 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Bust = = = 
 Although the mine produced more than $ 1 million ( equivalent to about $ 24 million in 2009 ) in bullion in its first three years , its shares declined from $ 23 a share ( in historical dollars ) to less than $ 3 . In February 1908 , a committee of minority stockholders , suspecting that the mine was overvalued , hired a British mining engineer to conduct an inspection . The engineer 's report was unfavorable , and news of this caused a sudden further decline in share value from $ 3 to 75 cents . Schwab expressed disappointment when he learned that " the wonderful high @-@ grade [ ore ] that had brought [ the mine ] fame was confined to only a few stringers and that what he had actually bought was a large low @-@ grade mine . " Although the mine was still profitable , by 1909 no new ore was being discovered , and the value of the remaining ore steadily decreased . In 1910 , the mine operated at a loss for most of the year , and on March 14 , 1911 , it was closed . By then , the stock , which had fallen to 10 cents a share , slid to 4 cents and was dropped from the exchanges . 
 Rhyolite began to decline before the final closing of the mine . At roughly the same time that the Bullfrog mines were running out of high @-@ grade ore , the 1906 San Francisco earthquake diverted capital to California while interrupting rail service , and the financial panic of 1907 restricted funding for mine development . As mines in the district reduced production or closed , unemployed miners left Rhyolite to seek work elsewhere , businesses failed , and by 1910 , the census reported only 675 residents . All three banks in the town closed by March 1910 . The newspapers , including the Rhyolite Herald , the last to go , all shut down by June 1912 . The post office closed in November 1913 ; the last train left Rhyolite Station in July 1914 , and the Nevada @-@ California Power Company turned off the electricity and removed its lines in 1916 . Within a year the town was " all but abandoned " , and the 1920 census reported a population of only 14 . A 1922 motor tour by the Los Angeles Times found only one remaining resident , a 92 @-@ year @-@ old man who died in 1924 . 
 Much of Rhyolite 's remaining infrastructure became a source of building materials for other towns and mining camps . Whole buildings were moved to Beatty . The Miners ' Union Hall in Rhyolite became the Old Town Hall in Beatty , and two @-@ room cabins were moved and reassembled as multi @-@ room homes . Parts of many buildings were used to build a Beatty school .

 Mining in and around Rhyolite after 1920 consisted mainly of working old tailings until a new mine opened in 1988 on the south side of Ladd Mountain . A company known as Bond Gold built an open @-@ pit mine and mill at the site , about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) south of Rhyolite along State Route 374 . LAC Minerals acquired the mine from Bond in 1989 and established an underground mine there in 1991 after a new body of ore called the North Extension was discovered . Barrick Gold acquired LAC Minerals in 1994 and continued to extract and process ore at what became known as the Barrick Bullfrog Mine until the end of 1998 . The mine used a chemical extraction process known as vat leaching involving the use of a weak cyanide solution . The process , like heap leaching , makes it possible to process ore profitably that otherwise would not qualify as mill @-@ grade . Over its entire life , the mine processed about 2 @,@ 800 @,@ 000 short tons ( 2 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 t ) of ore and produced about 690 @,@ 000 ounces ( 20 @,@ 000 kg ) of gold .
