 On 2 December 1943 , orders for 100 production FR @-@ 1s were placed , with a follow @-@ up order of 1 @,@ 000 additional fighters in January 1945 . All of the contracts were contingent on the aircraft successfully completing carrier trials . Only 66 Fireballs were completed by November 1945 as orders for 1 @,@ 044 FR @-@ 1s were canceled on VJ Day .

 One squadron , VF @-@ 66 , received its first Fireballs in March 1945 , but they never saw combat . On 1 May , three of the squadron 's aircraft were craned aboard the carrier Ranger to attempt to qualify seven pilots , but two of the fighters were damaged while landing . One missed the arresting gear and hit the crash barrier while the other aircraft 's nose gear collapsed . The following month the pilots qualified and were on pre @-@ embarkation leave when the Japanese surrendered . The squadron was decommissioned on 18 October with all pilots and aircraft transferred to VF @-@ 41 . 
 On 6 November 1945 , a Fireball of VF @-@ 41 became the first aircraft to land under jet power on an aircraft carrier , albeit unintentionally . After the radial engine of an FR @-@ 1 failed on final approach to the escort carrier Wake Island , the pilot managed to start the jet engine and land , barely catching the last arrestor wire before hitting the ship 's crash barrier . The squadron was attempting to qualify its pilots for carrier operations during this time , but only 14 of its 22 pilots made the six required takeoffs and landings . A number of accidents occurred when the nose gear failed on landing , but the pilots were at least partly responsible as they were slamming the nose gear onto the deck after landing on the main gear . 
 The squadron qualified on the escort carrier Bairoko in March 1946 , but nose gear problems persisted and cut the cruise short . Ryan installed a steel fork for the nosewheel , but inspections also revealed evidence of partial wing failures so the aircraft was limited to maneuvers not to exceed 5 Gs . VF @-@ 41 suffered three fatal accidents in 1946 before being redesignated as VF @-@ 1E on 15 November 1946 . One Ensign collided with the target banner during gunnery practice and spun into the water . A few months later , the squadron commander was performing a barrel roll when his wing broke off and he struck another Fireball , killing both pilots . 
 VF @-@ 1E conducted carrier qualification in March 1947 aboard the escort carrier <unk> Strait and only eight pilots successfully qualified , not least because the FR @-@ 1s were proving to be too fragile to endure repeated carrier landings . During one brief deployment in June aboard Rendova , one aircraft broke in two during a hard landing . Subsequent inspections of the squadron 's aircraft showed signs of structural failure and all the Fireballs were withdrawn by 1 August 1947 . 
 After the withdrawal of the type from service , except for a few examples retained for modifications and testing , the FR @-@ 1s were scrapped .

 Jeremy Morley " Jerry " Gill ( born 8 September 1970 ) is an English former professional footballer who is currently the head coach of the under @-@ 18 team at Wolverhampton Wanderers . Despite his late entry into the professional game – he made his debut in the Football League at the age of 27 – and a career @-@ threatening injury sustained five years later , Gill played more than 250 Football League matches , for Birmingham City , Northampton Town and Cheltenham Town , and was still playing in Football League One , the third tier of English football , three weeks after his 38th birthday . He usually played at right @-@ back , but could play elsewhere in defence or in midfield . His various managers viewed his strengths to be his professional approach to the game and the enthusiasm and whole @-@ hearted determination he shows on the field . 
 Gill began his football career with non @-@ league club Trowbridge Town . After an unsuccessful 18 months in London with Leyton Orient , he returned to the semi @-@ professional game with Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare followed by six seasons with Bath City . A season at Yeovil Town , where his goals from midfield helped the club to promotion to the Conference , earned Gill selection for the England National Game XI – England 's representative side for semi @-@ professional players – and a transfer to the Football League with First Division club Birmingham City . 
 Though Gill struggled to establish himself with Birmingham , and was never an undisputed member of the starting eleven , he played a big part in the club 's 2001 League Cup run , and was controversially omitted from the squad for the final . After Birmingham 's promotion to the Premier League , he moved to Northampton Town , where he suffered knee ligament damage which ended his career with the club . He went on to spend four seasons with Cheltenham Town , helping them to promotion to League One via the play @-@ offs . He spent most of the 2008 – 09 season as player @-@ coach of Conference National club Forest Green Rovers . After two unsuccessful applications for managerial posts , and a spell playing for Conference North club Redditch United , Gill was appointed manager of Conference South club Weymouth in January 2010 , only to resign 44 days later . He worked as youth team coach at Bristol Rovers , spent 18 months as academy director at Kidderminster Harriers , before being employed at Norwich City , initially as a scout then as an academy coach . He parted company with the Canaries in July 2015 and soon took up his current post with Wolves .

 Gill was born in Clevedon , Somerset , and attended Backwell School . As a schoolboy he played football for Parkway Youth Club , alongside fellow future professional player Marcus Stewart , and for Backwell United , and was invited to join the Bristol Rovers youth team for a tournament in Germany . After losing in the final , Gill and his Rovers team @-@ mates indulged in the local beer to the extent that they were arrested and kept in police cells overnight . At the age of 16 he joined Trowbridge Town , then playing in the regional divisions of the Southern League ( level 7 of the English football league system ) under the management of Ken Knighton . The young Gill was spotted by Frank Clark , who had worked with Knighton at Sunderland and succeeded him as Leyton Orient manager , and Clark signed Gill on an 18 @-@ month contract in 1988 . However , he found it difficult to settle – " moving to the east end of London from a small village was a real culture shock for me " – and returned to the West Country at the end of his contract without featuring for the Orient first team . 
 = = = Bath City = = = 
 In December 1990 , after a brief stint with Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare , Gill joined Bath City , newly promoted to the Conference . In his first 18 months with the club he appeared only infrequently for the first team , but in the 1992 – 93 season he established himself as a first @-@ team player and remained so for the duration of his Bath City career . In all he spent six seasons with the club on a semi @-@ professional basis , playing part @-@ time while working as a representative for a supplier of pitch care products , and made 218 appearances for the club in all competitions , scoring 14 goals . He helped the club reach the third round of the 1993 – 94 FA Cup , in which they held First Division club Stoke City to a goalless draw at Stoke before losing the replay 4 – 1 . 
 Since 1986 , Bath City had drawn a significant amount of income from allowing Football League club Bristol Rovers to share their Twerton Park ground ; Rovers ' return to Bristol at the end of the 1995 – 96 season meant that savings needed to be made , including cuts in the playing budget . Together with team @-@ mate Rob Cousins , Gill joined local rivals Yeovil Town for the 1996 – 97 season for a fee of £ 9 @,@ 500 . 
 = = = Yeovil Town = = = 
 Though Yeovil were at the time in the Isthmian League Premier Division , the level below the Conference , under player @-@ manager Graham Roberts they were playing good football and were expected to challenge for promotion . Gill scored 16 goals in all competitions playing in central midfield , and was capped for the England National Game XI , England 's representative team for semi @-@ professional footballers , against an Ireland B team in Dublin . In 2002 , the Football Association selected an " all @-@ time " team of players capped at semi @-@ professional level , " representing the very best of this level over the years " . Gill occupied the right @-@ back spot in this team , which had previously featured players such as Alan Smith and Steve Guppy who had gone on to represent England at full international level . 
 International selection attracted scouts from Football League clubs , and Gill was invited to Birmingham City to take part in trial matches . Halfway through the season , Roberts had brought striker Howard <unk> to Yeovil from Oxford City ; his 23 goals in 21 games did much to secure the Isthmian League title and promotion to the Conference , and also caught the eye of Birmingham manager Trevor Francis . A deal was struck which saw Gill and <unk> join the First Division side in August 1997 for a combined fee of £ 100 @,@ 000 , with Gill valued at £ 30 @,@ 000 plus an additional £ 10 @,@ 000 payable when he played ten first @-@ team matches . 
 = = = Birmingham City = = = 
 Gill spent nearly a full season at St Andrew 's before he finally made his Football League debut , at the age of 27 , on 18 April 1998 in a 3 – 0 defeat of Swindon Town . His second game for the club , away to Oxford United , was particularly eventful . With the score goalless , the referee first failed to award a penalty kick when Gill handled the ball in the penalty area , then disallowed the goal scored when the player deflected an opponent 's cross into his own net ; a few minutes later Gill was substituted , though he kept his place in the starting eleven for the next game . Then in the summer of 1998 , Birmingham paid £ 1 million for Derby County 's Gary Rowett . Installed as first @-@ choice right back , in two seasons at the club Rowett missed only five league games . During this period Gill captained the reserve team to victories in the Birmingham Senior Cup in 1999 and 2000 . 
 After Rowett made a £ 3 million move to Premier League club Leicester City , Gill faced competition from Nicky <unk> , newly arrived from Barnsley , Northern Ireland international winger Jon McCarthy , often used at right wing @-@ back , and a variety of loan signings . Manager Francis said : 
 Jerry knows what the situation is . I think he 's done very well for us , considering we plucked him out of non @-@ league football at Yeovil . But he is aware that I have been looking for a right @-@ back and I will continue looking for one . That doesn 't mean I don 't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years ago . There isn 't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill . He captains my reserve team , his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm . When I put him in the first team , he never lets me down . I value Jerry 's professionalism and for as long as I remain manager of Birmingham , there will always be a place for him here . 
 Gill signed a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year contract in January 2001 . Having taken part in most of the games in Birmingham 's League Cup run , he was omitted from the first leg of the semi @-@ final at Ipswich Town in favour of loan player Steve Jenkins . When Jenkins returned to his owning club , Gary Rowett said that Gill should be given a run of games in the Birmingham first team , suggesting that " if anything , he 's too nice . He doesn 't complain a lot and it 's easy for people not to take notice of you . Perhaps if he moaned a bit more he 'd get a start ! " Recalled for the second leg , he produced an excellent performance , making a goal @-@ line clearance from a header which would have left Birmingham two goals adrift had it crossed the line . Yet when it came to the final , manager Francis was unable to find a place for Gill even among the substitutes , preferring <unk> and McCarthy , making only his second start after recovering from a broken leg , in the starting eleven and David Holdsworth , a defender unavailable since the previous November due to serious illness , on the bench . Gill was devastated by this decision , describing it as " the biggest disappointment of [ his ] whole life " . 
 Gill played in almost every game after the League Cup Final until Francis left the club the following October , but lost his place soon afterwards through injury . Though he did then receive a League Cup runners @-@ up medal : club secretary Alan Jones had kept a spare one back , which he presented to Gill after Francis left . Under new manager Steve Bruce he played only one game , a 3 – 0 FA Cup defeat at Liverpool for which Jeff Kenna was cup @-@ tied , and when the team won promotion to the Premier League that season , it became clear that his future lay elsewhere . 
 = = = Northampton Town = = = 
 At the start of the 2002 – 03 season Gill joined Second Division club Northampton Town on a month 's loan . Northampton 's manager , the former Birmingham player Kevan Broadhurst , praised his qualities of leadership and determination : 
 Jerry will lead at the back by example . He does not pull out of anything and if there is a tackle to be won he will win it . 
 The loan was twice extended for a further month , and on 11 November 2002 Gill left Birmingham permanently , signing for Northampton until the end of the season . His season proceeded successfully – a new two @-@ year contract had been discussed , and he finished as runner @-@ up for the club 's Player of the Year award – until with two games remaining he damaged his anterior cruciate ligament and was expected to be out for several months . Northampton were prepared to give him a six @-@ month contract , albeit on reduced wages , to allow him time to recover and prove his fitness . Birmingham City allowed him to use their facilities for his rehabilitation , and he recovered sufficiently to play a couple of reserve games for Northampton , but by that time new manager Colin Calderwood had other players in Gill 's position and he was not offered another contract . 
 = = = Cheltenham Town = = = 
 Following a trial at the club , Gill signed for Cheltenham Town on 25 February 2004 on a non @-@ contract basis until the end of the season . He was given a one @-@ year contract for the 2004 – 05 season and , at the age of 34 , played in all 46 league games ; he believed that all the fitness work he did during rehabilitation from his knee injury had given him a new lease of life . Gill acted as regular deputy when club captain John Finnigan was unavailable through injury . For the following season , he was given another one @-@ year contract , with an option for 2006 – 07 if he managed to play 20 games during the season . Not only did he start twice that number , he contributed to the club reaching the final of the League Two play @-@ offs at the Millennium Stadium . His starting place and winners ' medal , achieved with the help of his " excellent last @-@ ditch defending " , went some way to alleviate the disappointment of missing the 2001 League Cup final . In addition , his sales experience enabled the players to look smart for the occasion ; expecting to be wearing tracksuits for their big day because the club was unable to afford a set of new suits , Gill persuaded a local outfitters to supply a set of suits at reasonable cost . While at Cheltenham Town he became a fan favourite and even had a song created by the fans who jokingly sung about his less than impressive goal scoring abilities , " If Jerry scores , We 're on the pitch , if Jerry scores , We 're on the pitch ! " to the tune of Tom Hark . 
 By Christmas 2006 , while the team worked towards maintaining their place in League One , Gill had already reached his target of 25 games for the whole season which triggered the offer of another year 's contract ; he chose to take up the offer . Gill missed only three games in all competitions in the 2007 – 08 season , and then signed a contract for yet another year with the club . Manager Keith Downing said : 
 Jerry 's form has been impressively consistent over the past few seasons , he has maintained excellent fitness levels and will once again be a very valuable player for us next season . He is a very good professional who is always on the training field . That is why his career has lasted as long as it has . Jerry is a very good influence on the dressing room as well and I 'm delighted that he will be staying with us . 
 He made his 200th start for the club in August 2008 , but was transfer @-@ listed , together with five team @-@ mates , when Martin Allen replaced Downing as manager in September 2008 . He had become involved with coaching at Cheltenham , but still felt capable of a playing role , albeit at a lower level , so saw Forest Green Rovers ' offer of a role as player @-@ coach as " too good an opportunity to miss " . 
 = = = Later career = = = 
 Gill joined Forest Green Rovers as player @-@ coach on 1 October 2008 , initially on loan , expecting to make the move permanent when the transfer window opened in January 2009 . He made his playing debut three days later , in the starting eleven in a 3 – 2 defeat at home to Wrexham . When January arrived , the loan was not made permanent , instead being extended until the end of the 2008 – 09 season . During a match against Oxford United in March 2009 , Gill suffered a triple fracture to his cheekbone and eye socket when a " nudge " from opponent Chris Carruthers , a former team @-@ mate at Northampton Town , propelled him into the advertising boards surrounding the pitch with such force that he was unable to prevent his head taking the full impact of a collision with a steel bar . Surgery to insert a titanium plate into Gill 's face was performed two days later , and he was restricted to a coaching role for the remainder of the season . He contributed to Forest Green avoiding relegation , and developed his skills by attending a fast @-@ track coaching course at the end of which he received the UEFA " B " licence . In June 2009 , the club made the financial decision that player David Brown would take over as assistant to manager Jim Harvey , and that Gill would leave the club . 
 During the summer of 2009 Gill worked as a coach in Birmingham City 's youth system . He was shortlisted for the post of manager at Conference club Cambridge United , but lost out to the more experienced Martin Ling , and was a favourite to replace Harvey , dismissed by Forest Green , but was again unsuccessful . Gill signed for Conference North club Redditch United in September 2009 , where he became a regular in the first team . 
 = = Coaching career = = 
 In January 2010 , Gill was appointed manager of Weymouth , then bottom of the Conference South . With the club already in financial difficulty , many first @-@ team players left . Budgetary constraints meant Gill was unable to bring in replacements , and after 44 days in post , he resigned , feeling the job had become untenable . Weymouth 's chairman claimed the cost of travelling from his Midlands home was a factor in his departure , a suggestion Gill refuted . In mid @-@ 2010 , he joined Bristol Rovers as youth team coach . He led the team to the third round of the FA Youth Cup , in which they lost narrowly to Aston Villa 's youth team , before a management restructure at the club resulted in his departure . 
 In June 2011 , Gill was appointed director of Kidderminster Harriers ' new football academy . According to the director of sport at Stourbridge College , Harriers ' academy partner , he " was instrumental in setting up the Football Academy and has laid down some very solid foundations in relation to shaping the discipline and attitude of our young players " . He left Harriers in February 2013 to concentrate on scouting for Premier League club Norwich City , a role he had been involved with for some months on a part @-@ time basis . He replaced Gary Holt , who departed to manage Falkirk , as Professional Development Phase Coach at Norwich City 's academy , and was subsequently appointed as the U18s Academy Team Manager . He parted company with the club in July 2015 and soon took up his current post with Wolverhampton Wanderers . 
 = = On and off the field = = 
 Gill has been popular wherever he has played . At Birmingham the fans used to greet him with a Jerry Springer @-@ style chant of " Jerry ! Jerry ! " , support which the player greatly appreciated . At the end of the 2000 – 01 season , he was chosen Birmingham 's Clubman of the Year . Cheltenham manager John Ward told the Western Daily Press : 
 We played Birmingham City in pre @-@ season and he got a lovely ovation from their supporters and it was the same at Yeovil last year . He got a lovely clap at Northampton a few weeks ago when he was taken off . I don 't think that happened by coincidence . And I 've got a feeling that if he leaves Cheltenham he will get a similar reception if he comes back with another club . Supporters recognise him and they see the whole @-@ heartedness and the commitment and the ability that he has got . 
 When Gill did leave Cheltenham , chairman Paul Baker confirmed Ward 's feeling : 
 Jerry has been a fantastic ambassador for the club following his arrival from Northampton some four years ago . He quickly established himself in the first team and became one of the fans ' favourites with his consistent performances , cheery smile and friendly manner . Without question he has played a very important part in the club 's success in achieving promotion and subsequently retaining our Coca @-@ Cola League One status . 
 His enthusiasm for the game remained undaunted . Asked at the age of 37 what part of training he enjoyed , he replied " All of it . There 's no better feeling than coming in , even on a cold day , and feeling fit and on top of your game . " 
 Gill is married to Victoria and has a son . After the knee injury which threatened his career , he became involved with a company which helps sportspeople prepare themselves for life and work after their sporting career comes to an end . As of 2008 , he was director of the sports marketing and retail company , Protech Sport , which managed the club shop at Cheltenham Town F.C. In his spare time he is a keen golfer .

 Interstate 605 ( I @-@ 605 ) is the common designation given by local media outlets to several proposals for a new auxiliary Interstate Highway bypassing I @-@ 5 and I @-@ 405 in the U.S. state of Washington . Proposals have been heard from since the 1960s , including highways connecting from I @-@ 5 all the way to the Canada – US border , and some just between I @-@ 5 and I @-@ 90 . The Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) has no projects designated I @-@ 605 at this time . However , a project to convert State Route 18 ( SR 18 ) to a limited @-@ access freeway is under construction currently . 
 = = Proposals = = 
 Some of the first plans for a new Interstate Highway freeway , bypassing I @-@ 405 , surfaced in 1968 . The first proposal was to create a new highway between I @-@ 405 and the west banks of Lake Sammamish . Residents however forced the highway to the east banks of the lake after voicing their concerns . Residents on the east side of the lake voiced similar concerns and the plan was later dropped . 
 In 1998 , the Washington State Legislature ordered a $ 500 @,@ 000 study to investigate the benefits of extending SR 18 north to Everett through the Snoqualmie Valley . The plan was dropped as the study found that on average only five minutes would be saved over current routes . In 2002 , Bellevue Square owner Kemper Freeman , Jr. made his support known for a new freeway linking Snohomish County via the Snoqualmie Valley . 
 Another $ 500 @,@ 000 study was ordered in 2003 by the legislature , creating a new commerce corridor to link Lewis County in the south to the Canada – US border in the north . However the study showed that a highway existing north of I @-@ 90 was not economically feasible . The study proposed a toll road only for trucks , since the presence of passenger cars would discourage truck drivers from using the new alternate route . The highway was estimated to cost between $ 13 @.@ 5 and $ 19 billion . 
 = = Related projects = = 
 The state currently has no plans to build Interstate 605 . WSDOT however is widening SR 18 between I @-@ 5 and I @-@ 90 , with only the segment between the Issaquah Hobart Road and I @-@ 90 yet to be completed , creating a full limited @-@ access freeway between I @-@ 5 and I @-@ 90 , southeast of I @-@ 405 . While SR 18 has been a part of some I @-@ 605 proposals , it only allows drivers to bypass the Greater Seattle area on the southern and eastern sides . 
 = 1982 Florida subtropical storm = 
 The 1982 Florida subtropical storm , officially known as Subtropical Storm One , was the only subtropical cyclone of the inactive 1982 Atlantic hurricane season . The storm originated from two different systems around the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea on June 16 . The systems merged into trough while a circulation began to form off the coast of Florida on June 18 . The depression made landfall in Florida and strengthened into a storm over land . The storm entered the Atlantic Ocean and headed to the northeast , becoming extratropical on June 20 near Newfoundland . The storm was the only system of 1982 to affect the eastern half of the United States , and it caused three fatalities and caused $ 10 million in damage ( 1982 USD , $ 21 million 2007 USD ) . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The subtropical storm had an unusual origin by forming from an interaction of two different systems near the Yucatán Peninsula . This occurrence is unusual , but not unique , as Subtropical Storm One in the 1974 season formed in similar pattern . A reconnaissance flight on June 17 reported that there appeared to be multiple transient circulations at the surface , but no well @-@ defined center . The first disturbance can be traced back to June 15 in the northwest Caribbean Sea . The disturbance moved north , along with a low @-@ pressure area that formed over the Yucatán Peninsula . A trough merged with the low @-@ pressure area creating an even stronger trough over the eastern Gulf of Mexico . Conditions in the Gulf of Mexico were favorable for tropical storm formation . Some severe weather had been occurring over the Florida Peninsula as early as June 16 , as the fringes of disturbance moved across the Florida Straits and over the Peninsula . 
 A circulation began to form on June 18 in the eastern Gulf of Mexico , prompting gale warnings . It was declared Subtropical Depression One the same day . The depression made landfall on the morning of June 18 just north of Spring Hill , Florida and gained subtropical storm status over land . The storm was classified as Subtropical Storm One by the National Hurricane Center , as the rule was not to name subtropical storms . The subtropical storm moved to the northeast and crossed the Outer Banks of North Carolina on June 19 . Even though the minimum central pressures remained low , the circulation expanded and became distorted . The subtropical storm peaked at 70 mph winds ( 110 km / h ) on June 18 , but did not reach its minimum pressure until June 20 , when it dropped to 984 mbar ( 29 @.@ 07 inHg ) . The subtropical storm was declared an extratropical storm near the Canadian Maritimes the same day . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Several warnings were issued in association with the subtropical storm . On June 16 , severe thunderstorm watches and warnings were issued for Florida . The next day , more warnings were issued , including tornado , small craft , and special marine warnings . There were also various types of special weather statements issued for heavy rains . Five gale warnings were issued on June 18 and June 19 for the cities on the western coast of Florida . All warnings were discontinued by 12 p.m. EDT ( 1600 UTC ) June 19 . The same day , a gale warning was issued from Cape Henlopen , Delaware to Watch Hill , Rhode Island . 
 The subtropical storm postponed the bi @-@ annual Newport , Rhode Island to Bermuda sailboat race for two consecutive days due to the forecast one of the storm . Subsequent reports from sailboats said that with the track of the storm , if not for the delay , there would have been a marine disaster . 
 = = Impact = = 
 In its main inflow band over Cuba , rainfall amounts up to 28 @.@ 66 inches ( 728 mm ) were recorded . 
 Most of the storm 's effects were felt in Florida where it made landfall on the morning of June 18 , causing gales , heavy rains , flooding , beach erosion and tornadoes . The highest winds were recorded at 41 mph ( 66 km / h ) and up to 48 mph ( 77 km / h ) during a thunderstorm at <unk> Air Force Base in Tampa on June 18 . Rainfall peaked at 10 @.@ 72 inches ( 272 @.@ 28 mm ) in <unk> City , while much of the rest of the state reported between 1 – 5 inches ( 25 – 125 inches ) of precipitation . High tides and waves caused flooding and beach erosion from Naples to the Tampa Bay area .

The Varden , who are effectively refugees , suffer financial troubles , until Nasuada learns that she can create an expensive lace with magic , and sell it at extremely low rates . One night when Nasuada is in her room , a character named Elva saves her from an assassination attempt . Elva is enchanted , and locates the assailant , who is killed after unwillingly surrendering information to Varden magicians about a subversive group based in Surda called the Black Hand , who is plotting to kill Nasuada . Nasuada later attends a meeting with key figures in Surda 's government to discuss a potential upcoming battle against the Empire . They learn that the conflict is coming sooner than they initially suspected , and mobilize forces to attack , as well as sending for help from the dwarves . 
 In the meantime , Eragon continues his training , but is discouraged when the scar on his back causes him to have agonizing seizures multiple times per day . He has been swooning over Arya for most of the book . Saphira also has a similar problem with Glaedr , as she believes him to be a good choice for a mate and tries to win his affections . Eragon tells her it would not be proper , and she in turn replies that Arya is not as important as his education . Both efforts fail miserably , but bring Eragon and Saphira closer together . Later , at the ancient elven ceremony , the <unk> <unk> ( Blood @-@ Oath Celebration ) , Eragon is altered by a spectral dragon . The changes alter his senses , and enhance his abilities , effectively turning him into an elf @-@ human hybrid , as well as healing all of his wounds , scars , and back injury .

Roran is stunned that his cousin is a Dragon Rider , and he asks Jeod for help to reach the Varden . Jeod decides to go with them and he gathers a group of his friends to steal a ship called the Dragon Wing . The village is chased by a group of Galbatorix 's boats , but they force themselves into the gigantic <unk> , the Boar 's eye , so that they can trap the enemy ships . 
 Meanwhile , Eragon arrives at the Varden 's camp , who are under attack by an army of one hundred thousand of Galbatorix 's soldiers . A group of Urgals join the Varden , and Eragon is able to repel the opposing army with help from the dwarves ' reinforcements . Eventually , a Dragon Rider appears in favor of the Empire . The hostile Dragon Rider kills the dwarf king Hrothgar , and soon begins to fight with Eragon . The Dragon Rider is soon unmasked by Eragon and is revealed to be Murtagh , his old friend . Murtagh tells Eragon that he was kidnapped and forced into loyalty by Galbatorix after a dragon hatched for him , whom he named Thorn . Murtagh <unk> Eragon , but shows mercy due to their old friendship . Before leaving , Murtagh reveals that Eragon is his brother , and takes Eragon 's sword Zar 'roc , which he believes to be his inheritance . Ultimately , Galbatorix 's army is forced to retreat due to heavy losses , after the arrival of the dwarves and the village of Carvahall and the departure of Murtagh and Thorn . Roran manages to defeat the Twins by bashing them in the heads with his hammer , thus enhancing his title of Roran <unk> . In the end , Eragon reunites with Roran and Eragon decides to help Roran rescue Katrina from the Ra 'zac in Dras @-@ Leona .

A third review , while not identifying any specific themes , said the author was " layering his themes " to make the book more exciting . Another review praised the story for the themes of power , family , and maturing . Paolini commented on the theme in Eldest of vegetarianism : 
 " One of my goals as an author is to explore various aspects of human nature . It 's my job , then , to attempt to understand why people act , even if it differs from my own point of view or practice , and to present those reasons to the best of my ability . The actions and beliefs of my characters are not necessarily my own . "

 = 2010 Shanghai fire = 
 The 2010 Shanghai fire was a fire on 15 November 2010 that destroyed a 28 @-@ story high @-@ rise apartment building in the city of Shanghai , China , killing at least 58 people and injuring more than 70 others ( with at least one source reporting more than 120 others injured ) . 
 An investigation under the PRC State Council was announced on 16 November , the day after the fire , to determine the cause of the blaze . A preliminary finding by investigators concluded that sparks from welding work being done on the building , undertaken by unlicensed welders , ignited scaffolding around the structure , which led to the apartment 's destruction . The municipal government also placed the blame on illegal multi @-@ layered subcontracting , and detained four managers from several construction companies . In all , sixteen individuals have been arrested in connection to the fire , including four others accused of being unlicensed welders . 
 The week after the fire , city officials announced a compensation plan for victims of the fire and their families . The fire also prompted the government to pass stricter regulations on the construction industry , as well as increased fire safety inspections . Some citizens have criticized the government , accusing it of censoring the media and providing an inadequate response to the fire . 
 = = Fire = = 
 The fire began at 2 : 15 pm local time ( 06 : 15 UTC ) around the tenth floor . The building , constructed in 1997 , was located at the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Yuyao Road in Shanghai 's Jing 'an District , and was being renovated at the time of the fire . Witnesses said that the fire started with construction materials and spread throughout the building . It took over 80 fire engines and several hours to contain the fire . Shanghai residents were able to see smoke from the fire several kilometres away . Firefighters were unable to hose water on the top of the 85 metres ( 279 ft ) -tall building from the ground . 
 China Youth Daily reported that the contractor for the construction said the cause of the fire was probably sparks caused by welding work done on the 20th floor . Qiu <unk> , a worker on the 18th floor , said sparks from welding being done on another building flew over and caused the scaffolding to catch fire . Afterward , it was established that the fire " was caused by unlicensed welders improperly operating their equipment " , and several welders were arrested . 
 = = = Rescue efforts = = = 
 Firefighters were able to save over 100 people out of 156 families living in the high @-@ rise apartment building . According to Al Jazeera , the fire began at the scaffolding that surrounded the building , but spread to the complex 's main building of around 500 apartments . Xinhua News Agency said the fire was contained at about 6 : 30 pm local time ( 10 : 30 UTC ) , more than four hours after it began . 
 Three helicopters had been called in to assist in the rescue , but were prevented by thick smoke generated by the fire . The upper portion of the building was beyond the reach of fire apparatus ; the blaze was brought under control only after firefighters set up hoses atop a nearby building . In all , 25 fire stations and over 100 fire appliances were mobilised in response to the incident . 
 Television coverage of the event showed people holding on to scaffolding around the building , and some were able to climb down to safety . One worker on the 28th floor said that workers were adding insulation to the building when the fire broke out . 
 Victims not in hospitals , as well as evacuees from three surrounding city blocks , were sent to public buildings , including a school and a stadium , until their housing situation could be addressed . 
 = = Casualties = = 
 The building housed around 440 people , mainly retired teachers . An early report showed that the ages of those injured in the fire range from 3 to 85 , with the majority ( 64 @.@ 5 % ) over the age of 50 . Most of the injured appeared to be elderly residents or children , and it was confirmed that the youngest victim of the fire was 16 months old . A firefighter said that 57 of the 58 killed had died inside the building . 
 Earliest reports put the death toll at eight , but Xinhua later revised the count several times , and then finally confirmed 53 deaths . 26 bodies were identified using DNA tests . Some media outlets reported 79 fatalities by adding the number of identified victims to the number of previously reported fatalities , although Xinhua later said that the 26 identified were included amongst the 53 . 
 As of 24 November , 58 people ( 22 males and 36 females ) were officially reported dead while 56 people remained missing . The Global Times reported that , as of 28 December 2010 , 71 people had been injured , and 36 were still missing . Of the deceased , 57 were identified by DNA tests early on , while one male , from Japan , was still being identified when the official death count was released . 
 A doctor at Shanghai 's Jing 'an Hospital said that over 20 people injured in the fire had been admitted , many suffering from asphyxia caused by smoke inhalation . State media reports said the hospital was treating 55 survivors , including nine in serious condition . At least 70 people , and possibly more than 120 people were reported to have been injured . According to BBC News , people who survived the blaze were searching hospitals for missing family and friends . As of 24 November , 66 wounded people , 14 of which were in critical condition , were being treated at seven area medical centers . In all , nine hospitals received victims of the fire . 
 The list of the dead was not released as the victims ' families wanted privacy . Authorities said more than one @-@ third of the families did not want the names of the deceased published . However , several newspapers listed some of the names of the dead . The artist Ai Weiwei compiled an unofficial list of the victims ' names by contacting their relatives , along with officials and journalists . He claimed that the actual death toll was two more than the official count , but authorities did not provide access to the list of casualties . 
 = = Response = = 
 = = = Investigation = = = 
 Meng <unk> , the Minister of Public Security , went to Shanghai to manage rescue operations . Jing 'an officials set up temporary lodging and food at area hotels , and some survivors stayed at a gymnasium overnight . After the flames were extinguished , the Shanghai Municipal Government held a press conference about the damage caused by the fire . Liu <unk> , Vice Minister of Public Security , described the firefighting as " a successful model " , leading to a dispute by Chinese netizens . Later in the week of the fire , government officials began a drive to increase fire and safety inspections at buildings and construction sites . They also said that improvements would be made to the city 's firefighting capabilities . 
 Local residents said that fire safety requirements at the high @-@ rise were lax , and that workers often tossed used cigarettes into the building 's hallways . Week @-@ long safety inspections were done on the two other buildings of the apartment complex , both of which were unharmed . The several hundred people living in those buildings were expected to be allowed to move back on 20 December 2010 . Until then , the survivors would live in 17 nearby hotels . 
 According to Ming Pao , family members of the victims were dissatisfied with the official investigation and held a sit @-@ in protest , calling for a fair judgement . Some locals blamed the official rescue work by comparing it with a large emergency response exercise on a 330 @-@ meter building several days before , and the successful firefighting for a blaze at Shanghai World Financial Center in 2007 . Others blamed an ineffective firefighting system for the high death toll , and were dissatisfied that they were not given more details about the fire . 
 In Beijing , authorities halted renovation projects similar to the one being done on the apartment in Shanghai shortly after the blaze . The projects , intended to save energy by installing insulation , were stopped on 19 November , pending safety evaluations of the work . The insulation is still flammable , despite the use of fire retardants . Shanghai officials temporarily stopped such renovations after the fire , but later allowed them to resume . 
 On 20 December 2010 , the mayor of Shanghai , Han Zheng , said that the city would crack down on unfair practices of construction companies and contracting firms . Han said that there is little regulation of the construction industry and that certain companies have had advantages over other companies when being awarded contracts . On 11 January 2011 , Shanghai authorities placed into effect a new set of regulations aimed at better official supervision of construction companies . The city will also require that such companies will not be permitted to have any non @-@ official relationship with local government offices after one year . Some media organizations had been questioning the connections between Jing 'an District 's government and the contracting groups involved in the fire , leading to accusations of corruption . 
 = = = Compensation = = = 
 On 23 November , it was announced that the families of each victim of the fire would receive 960 @,@ 000 yuan in compensation for the ordeal . The compensation would include 650 @,@ 000 yuan for every death and 310 @,@ 000 yuan in financial assistance from the government and charities . Zhang <unk> , the top official of Jing 'an District , said that Shanghai residents and foreign workers would be compensated equally . Survivors of the blaze would be fully compensated for the loss of possessions and property . Some who lost relatives in the disaster , however , were not satisfied with the announcement . They said that the compensation plan was not enough to pay for another apartment in the district , and that would rather have a new apartment than the money . 
 = = = Media censorship allegations = = = 
 Hong Kong @-@ based Sing Tao Daily and Singapore @-@ based <unk> <unk> reported that four journalists from <unk> News ( <unk> ) , China Daily , Reuters and a local newspaper were detained for one hour as security forces demanded a guarantee for positive news coverage by the journalists , before they were to interview families of the victims at a funeral parlour . The reporters wrote about their detainment on two websites . 
 A Chinese webmaster said that the authorities demanded for Chinese websites to cut down on their reporting of the fire , and only allowed usage of the official Xinhua news source . The New York Times reported that Chinese website <unk> Online was blocked by government censors after criticizing the country 's real @-@ estate industry . 
 = = Responsibility = = 
 Han Zheng said on 22 November that the city was largely responsible for the disaster . He said , " Poor supervision of the city 's construction industry was one of the causes behind the high @-@ rise apartment building fire . And we are responsible for that . " Willy Wo @-@ Lap Lam , a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong , said Han was trying " to do some damage control to dispel anger and to comfort the families of the victims and the Shanghai people . " Luo Lin , chief of the PRC State Administration of Work Safety , blamed the fire on illegal employment methods , poor project oversight , and incompetent , inexperienced workers . 
 On the day following the fire , Meng <unk> said he wanted an investigation into the fire to determine who was responsible for it , so those at fault could be punished appropriately . He told rescue officials to be meticulous in their efforts and that information regarding the fire should be released to the public . He also asked local governments across China to take preventative measures against such fires , including building inspections . A team of investigators , led by the State Administration of Work Safety , was formed under the PRC State Council to look into the incident . Many details about the " November 15 Relief and Rehabilitation Working Team " have not been publicly announced . 
 The investigation into the fire made a preliminary conclusion that negligence by unlicensed welders on the tenth floor caused the bamboo scaffolding and attached nylon netting to catch fire , which subsequently spread to the entire structure . Shanghai authorities detained eight individuals on 16 November , at least four of whom were accused of being unlicensed welders . As of 19 November , a total of twelve individuals were being held by officials in connection to the blaze , including four more who were detained that day . The four were representatives of <unk> Building Decoration , a part of renovation contractor Jing 'an Construction , Shanghai Jing 'an Construction Supervision , and the apartment management company . 
 On 24 December 2010 , Shanghai officials announced that three government employees had been taken into custody in connection with the fire . Those detained were accused of abusing their authority to permit illicit construction practices to occur . The three were reported to be Gao <unk> , director of Jing 'an 's construction and transportation commission ; Zhang Quan , of the commission 's main office ; and Zhou <unk> , of the organization 's construction department . 
 = = = Cause of fire = = = 
 The fire may have been caused by the accidental ignition of polyurethane foam insulation used on the building 's outer walls . In China , the foam is commonly used as insulation material without the addition of flame retardants , and the foam produces toxic gases and carbon monoxide when burned . The Beijing Television Cultural Center was said to have used polyurethane insulation , which magnified the ferocity of a 2009 fire that consumed the center . In a 24 November press conference , local authorities said that the two apartments next to the destroyed building would be renovated as well , and that foam cladding on their exteriors would be replaced switched out in favor of fire @-@ resistant materials . Chinese citizens have also questioned the lack of an indoor fire sprinkler system in high rise buildings . 
 = = Public mourning = = 
 Local citizens put flowers and wreaths near the site , and offered prayers around the destroyed building . Mourners , including Government officials , came bearing chrysanthemums . At one point , the crowd stretched around 250 metres ( 820 ft ) down the road . 
 According to Xinhua , about 10 @,@ 000 people attended a public mourning at the site on 21 November , seven days after the fire ; mourners left large amounts of flowers surrounding the burnt building . The seventh day after death is the day that Chinese people believe the souls of the dead return to their relatives before departing , and mourners at the site burned paper and made a feast for the deceased , in accordance with Chinese tradition . During the event , the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra played " Ave Maria " and monks recited <unk> at a local temple . 
 On 19 December 2010 , the 35th day following the fire , authorities were reported to be detaining mourners who were visiting the site . According to Chinese legend , souls of the dead also visit humans 35 days after death , but police were taking mourners away on buses . Local officials did not provide an explanation for the event . 
 = Music of Dominica = 
 The music of Dominica includes a variety of genres including all the popular genres of the world . Popular music is widespread , with a number of native Dominican performers gaining national fame in imported genres such as calypso , reggae , soca , <unk> , zouk and rock and roll . Dominica 's own popular music industry has created a form called bouyon , which combines elements from several styles and has achieved a wide fanbase in Dominica . Groups include WCK ( Windward Caribbean Kulture ) , Native musicians in various forms , such as reggae ( <unk> Fontaine , Lazo , Brother Matthew Luke ) , kadans ( Ophelia Marie , ( Exile One , Grammacks ) and calypso ( The Wizzard ) , have also become stars at home and abroad . 
 There is also " Cadence @-@ lypso " , the Dominica kadans , which has set the stage for some of the region 's most significant musical developments such as zouk , bouyon ( another Dominican creation ) and soca music . 
 Like the other Francophone musics of the Lesser Antilles , Dominican folk music is a hybrid of African and European elements . The quadrille is an important symbol of French Antillean culture , and is , on Dominica , typically accompanied by a kind of ensemble called a jing ping band . In addition , Dominica 's folk tradition includes folk songs called bélé , traditional storytelling called kont , masquerade , children 's and work songs , and Carnival music . 
 Until the late 1950s , the Afro @-@ Dominican culture of most of the island was repressed by the colonial government and the influence of the Roman Catholic Church , both of which taught that African @-@ derived music was evil , demonic and uncultured . This perception changed in the mid- to late 20th century , when Afro @-@ Dominican culture came to be celebrated through the work of promoters like Cissie <unk> . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Dominica 's terrain is rugged , which has fostered distinct regional traditions . The northern , eastern , southern , western and central parts of the island are music areas . The villages of Wesley and Marigot are also unique in their preservation of English language and music rather than the more French @-@ based styles of the rest of the island . 
 Dominican folk music is an oral tradition , learned informally through watching others perform . As of 1987 , most performers of traditional music were either over 50 years old or under 35 , which indicates an ongoing revival of previously declining traditions . Music is evaluated based on both characteristics of the music , such as complex syncopated rhythms , as well as social factors , such as the ability of the performers to improvise and respond to their surroundings and to keep the audience excited and participating in the music . 
 Characteristics of Dominican music include the West African use of call and response singing , clapping as a major part of rhythm and lyrical , dance and rhythmic improvisation . Lyrics are almost all in Dominican Creole French , and are traditionally sung by women ( chantwèl ) , while the instrumental traditions are predominantly practiced by men . Drums , generically known as lapo kabwit , are the most prominent part of Dominica 's instrumental tradition . 
 = = Folk music = = 
 Dominican folk music includes , most influentially , the French Antillean quadrille tradition , the jing ping style of dance music , as well as bélé and heel @-@ and @-@ toe polka . Traditional Carnival music includes chanté mas and lapo kabwit . Folk music on Dominica has historically been a part of everyday life , including work songs , religious music and secular , recreational music . 
 The quadrille is one of the most important dance of the Dominican folk tradition , which also includes the lancer and distinctive forms of several dances , many of them derived from European styles . The <unk> ( biguine ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , polka <unk> ( pure polka ) , <unk> o <unk> ( Viennese waltz ) and <unk> ( mazurka ) are particularly widespread . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 <unk> are folk songs of West African origin , traditionally performed recreationally in the evening during the full moon , and more rarely , <unk> ( wakes ) . The bélé tradition has declined in the 20th and 21st century , but is still performed for holidays like Easter , Independence Day , Christmas , Creole Day ( Jounen Kwéyòl ) and patron saint festivals held annually in the Parishes of Dominica , especially in the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> for fishermen and workers respectively . 
 All bélé are accompanied by an eponymous drum , the tanbou bélé , along with the <unk> ( triangle ) and chakchak ( maracas ) . <unk> start with a lead vocalist ( chantwèl ) , who is followed by the responsorial chorus ( <unk> ) , then a drummer and dancers . Traditional dances revolve around stylized courtship between a male and female dancer , known as the <unk> and <unk> respectively . The bélé song @-@ dances include the bélé <unk> , bélé <unk> , bélé <unk> , bélé <unk> , bélé rickety and bélé <unk> . 
 = = = Quadrille = = = 
 The quadrille is a dance form that is an important symbol of French Antillean culture , not just in Dominica , but also Martinique , Guadeloupe and other Francophone islands . Dominican quadrilles are traditionally performed by four sets of couples in subscription picnics or dances , and in private parties . However , the quadrille tradition now only survives at holidays and festivals . 
 The Dominican quadrille generally has four figures , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . Some regions of Dominica , such as Petite Savanne , are home to local variants such as the <unk> . Many quadrilles are found across Dominica under a wide variety of names . In addition to the standard quadrille , the lancer is also an important Dominican dance . 
 Accompaniment for the quadrille is provided by a four @-@ instrument ensemble called a jing ping band . 
 = = = Jing ping = = = 
 Jing Ping is a kind of folk music originated on the slave plantations of Dominica , also known colloquially as an accordion band . In Dominican folk music , jing ping bands accompany a circle dance called the flirtation , as well as the Dominican quadrille . 
 Jing ping bands are made up of a <unk> ( boom pipe ) , <unk> or <unk> ( scraper @-@ rattle ) , <unk> or tanbou ( tambourine ) and accordion . The double bass and banjo are also sometimes used . Bamboo flutes led the jing ping ensembles before the 1940s , when accordions were introduced . The Dominican flute tradition declined as a result , despite their additional use in serenades , until being revived after the National Independence Competitions . 
 = = = Chanté mas = = = 
 The chanté mas ( masquerade song ) tradition is based around pre @-@ calypso Carnival music performed in a responsorial style by partygoers . The Dominican Carnival masquerade lasted for two days of parading through the streets , with a singer dancing backwards in front of the drummer on a tanbou <unk> . Chanté mas lyrics are traditionally based on gossip and scandal , and addressed the personal shortcomings of others . 
 = = = Other folk music = = = 
 Dominica 's folk musical heritage includes work songs , storytelling , children 's music and masquerade songs . Dominican work songs are accompanied by the <unk> <unk> drum , and are performed by workers while gathering fruit , building roads , fishing , moving a house or sawing wood . Many are responsorial , and are generally short and simple , with the lyrical text and rhythm tying into the work to be accompanied . On modern Dominica , work songs are rarely performed . 
 The kont , or storytelling , folk tradition of Dominica was focused around entertainment for night @-@ time festivals , funeral wakes and feasts and festivals . Modern kont is mostly performed during major festival competitions . Most kont storytellers work with local traditions , such as legends and history , and provide an ethical or moral message . A one line theme song , often based around a duet between two characters , recurs throughout most kont performances . 
 Unlike most Dominican folk songs , children 's songs and musical games are mostly in English . They were originally in the same Creole as the rest of the island , but have come to be primarily of English , Scottish , and Irish derivation . Children 's musical traditions include ring games and circle dances , and music accompanied by thigh @-@ slapping and circle dancing . 
 = = Early popular music = = 
 Dominican popular music history can be traced back to the 1940s and ' 50s , when dance bands like the Casimir Brothers and , later , The Swinging Stars , became famous across the island . Their music was a dance @-@ oriented version of many kinds of Caribbean and Latin popular music , such as Cuban bolero , Brazilian samba , the merengue from the Dominican Republic , Trinidadian calypso , and American funk . 
 By the beginning of the 1960s , calypso and Trinidadian steelpan became the most popular styles of music on Dominica , replacing traditional Carnival music like chanté mas and lapo kabwit . Early recording stars from this era included Swinging Busters , The Gaylords , De Boys an Dem and Los Caballeros , while chorale groups also gained fans , especially <unk> <unk> , <unk> Montan 'y and the Dominica Folk singers . These early popular musicians were aided by the spread of radio broadcasting , beginning with <unk> and later Radio Dominica . 
 Of these early popular musicians , a few pioneering the use of native influences . The Gaylords ’ hits , such as " Ti Mako " , " Pray for the Blackman " , " Lovely Dominica " and " <unk> Jo " , were either English or the native Creole , ( <unk> ) . By the end of the 1960s and beginning of the 1970s , American rock and roll , soul and funk had reached Dominica and left lasting influences . Funky rock @-@ based bands like Voltage Four , <unk> and Every Mother 's Child became popular . 
 The first internationally known bands from Dominica were 1970s groups such as Exile One and Grammacks . These bands were the stars of the cadence @-@ lypso scene , which was the first style of Dominican music to become popular across the Caribbean . By the 1980s , however , Martinican zouk and other styles were more popular . In 1988 , WCK formed , playing an experimental fusion of cadence @-@ lypso with the island ’ s jing ping sound . The result became known as bouyon , and has re @-@ established Dominica in the field of popular music . 
 = = = Calypso = = = 
 In the 1960s , calypso and steelband music became very popular and indeed replaced lapo kabwit and chanté mas as the music of carnival , particularly in the capital Roseau . Many of the traditional songs were performed in the new calypso beat . <unk> and Calypso Monarch competitions emerged and became extremely popular . <unk> emerged all around the country . The older musicians and bands had moved on and were replaced by the younger musicians . Bands such as Swinging Stars , The Gaylords , De Boys an Dem , Los Caballeros and Swinging Busters surfaced and began to cut records . The emergence of radio , first <unk> and later Radio Dominica helped to spread the music . 
 Calypso has been popular in Dominica since the 1950s ; the first Calypso King was crowned in 1959 . Popular calypso in Dominica has always been closely associated with steelpan music . The first wave of Dominican steelpan includes such bands as Esso , Shell and Regent , Vauxhall and Old Oak . 
 = = = Cadence ( kadans ) / compas = = = 
 In the 1970s , a wave of Haitian , mostly musicians , to Dominica and the French Antilles ( Guadeloupe and Martinique ) brought with them the kadans , a sophisticated form of music that quickly swept the island and helped unite all the former French colonies of the Caribbean by combining their cultural influences . This was followed by mini @-@ jazz like Les Gentlemen , Les Leopards , Les Vikings de Guadeloupe and others . 
 Later in the decade and into the 1980s , the French Antilles became home to a style of cadence music called cadence @-@ lypso . Gordon Henderson 's Exile One innovated this style , as well as turned the mini @-@ jazz combos into guitar @-@ dominated big bands with a full @-@ horn section and the newly arrived synthesizers , paving the way for the success of large groups like Grammacks , Experience 7 , among others . Drawing on these influences , the supergroup Kassav ' invented zouk and popularized it with hit songs including " Zouk @-@ La @-@ Se Sel <unk> Nou Ni " . Kassav ' formed in Paris in 1978 . 
 = = = Cadence @-@ lypso = = = 
 The most influential figure in the promotion of Cadence @-@ lypso was the Dominican group Exile One ( based on the island of Guadeloupe ) that featured mostly the cadence <unk> of Haiti and calypso music from the English @-@ speaking Caribbean . It was pushed in the 1970s by groups from Dominica , and was the first style of Dominican music to find international acclaim . 
 Dominica cadence music has evolved under the influence of Dominican and Caribbean / Latin rhythms , as well as rock and roll , soul , and funk music from the United States . By the end of the 1970s , Gordon Henderson defined Cadence @-@ lypso as " a synthesis of Caribbean and African musical patterns fusing the traditional with the contemporary " . 
 Aside from Exile One , other bands included the Grammacks , Black Roots , Black Machine , Naked Feet , Belles Combo , Mantra , Black Affairs , Liquid Ice , <unk> , <unk> <unk> and Milestone , while the most famous singers included Bill Thomas , Chubby Marc , Gordon Henderson , Linford John , Janet <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Tony <unk> , Jeff Joseph , Mike Moreau and Anthony Gussie . Ophelia Marie is a popular singer of cadence @-@ lypso in the 1980s . 
 Cadence @-@ lypso was influenced by nationalist movement that espoused Rastafari and Black Power . Many groups performed songs with intensely ideological positions , and much of the repertoire was in the vernacular Creole language . 
 Gordon Henderson , Exile One 's leader and founder , coined the name " Cadence @-@ lypso " in his full band that used a full @-@ horn section and was the first to use the synthesizers in kadans . Many mini @-@ jazz from Haiti and the French Antilles followed this format . The band is considered by some to be one of the pioneers of soca . During the early 1970s , they initiated a fusion of cadence and calypso " Cadence @-@ lypso " that would later become soca music . 
 Exile One was the most promoted Creole band of the Caribbean . The first to sign a production contract with major label Barclay Records . The first to export kadans music to the four corners of the globe : Japan , the Indian Ocean , Africa , North America , Europe , The Cape Verde islands . 
 = = Recent popular music = = 
 During the 1980s , cadence @-@ lypso ’ s popularity declined greatly . Some Dominican performers remained famous , such as Ophelia , a very renowned singer of the period . Popular music during this time was mostly zouk , a style pioneered by the French Antillean band Kassav , who used styles of folk music of Martinique and Guadeloupe . Soca , a kind of Trinidadian music , was also popular at the time , producing bands like Windward Caribbean Kulture . The ' 80s also saw a rise in popular for jazz and the formation of several jazz bands , while groups like Exile One began exploring tradition rhythms from jing ping and lapo kabwit . 
 = = = Zouk = = = 
 The inspiration for Zouk 's style of rhythmic music comes from the Haitian compas , as well as music called cadence @-@ lypso – Dominica cadence popularized by Grammacks and Exile One . Elements of gwo ka , tambour , ti bwa and biguine <unk> are prominent in zouk . Though there are many diverse styles of zouk , some commonalities exist . The French Creole tongue of Martinique and Guadeloupe is an important element , and are a distinctive part of the music . Generally , zouk is based around star singers , with little attention given to instrumentalists , and is based almost entirely around studio recordings . 
 Music authors Charles De Ledesma and Gene <unk> trace zouk 's development to the Guadeloupean gwo ka and Martinican <unk> ( tambour and ti bwa ) folk traditions . Ethnomusicologist Jocelyn Guilbault , however , describes zouk as a synthesis of Caribbean popular styles , especially Dominica cadence @-@ lypso , Haitian cadence , Guadeloupean biguine . Zouk arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s , using elements of previous styles of Antillean music , as well as imported genres . 
 = = = Zouk @-@ love = = = 
 Zouk Love is the French Antilles cadence or compas , characterized by a slow , soft and sexual rhythm . The lyrics of the songs often speak of love and sentimental problems . 
 The music <unk> from Angola and <unk> @-@ love from Cape Verde are also derivatives of this French Antillean compas style , which sounds basically the same , although there are notable differences once you become more familiar with these genres . A main exponent of this subgenre is Ophelia Marie of Dominica . Other Zouk Love artists come from the French West Indies , the Netherlands , and Africa . 
 Grammacks , Exile One , Ophelia Marie , and many Dominican bands played cadence @-@ lypso ( Dominica <unk> ) that later influenced zouk love in the French Antilles . Nowadays , zouk @-@ love is called the French Antilles cadence or compas . Popular artists include French West Indian artists Edith Lefel and Nichols , or like Netherlands @-@ based Suzanna <unk> and Gil Semedo , the African artist <unk> . 
 = = = Soca = = = 
 The <unk> Lord Shorty of Trinidad was the first to really define his music and with " Indrani " in 1973 and " Endless Vibration " ( not just the song but the entire album ) in 1975 , calypso music really took off in another direction . Later in 1975 Lord Shorty visited his good friend Maestro in Dominica where he stayed ( at Maestro 's house ) for a month while they visited and worked with local cadence artists . You had Maestro experimenting with calypso and cadence ( " cadence @-@ lypso " ) . Sadly a year later Maestro would die in an accident in Dominica and his loss was palpably felt by Shorty , who penned " Higher World " as a tribute . 
 In Dominica , Shorty had attended an Exile One performance of cadence @-@ lypso , and collaborated with Dominica 's 1969 Calypso King , Lord Tokyo and two calypso lyricists , Chris <unk> and Pat Aaron in the early 1970s , who wrote him some Creole lyrics . Soon after Shorty released a song , " Ou Petit " , with words like " Ou dee <unk> ou petit Shorty " ( meaning " you told me you are small Shorty " ) , a combination of calypso , cadence and Creole . 
 Soca 's development includes its fusion of calypso , cadence , and Indian musical instruments — particularly the dholak , tabla and <unk> — as demonstrated in Shorty 's classic compositions " <unk> " and " Shanti Om " . 
 = = = Bouyon = = = 
 Bouyon is a fusion of Jing ping , Cadence @-@ lypso and traditional dances namely <unk> , Quadrille , chanté mas and lapo kabwit , Mazurka , Zouk and other styles of Caribbean music , developed by a band called Windward Caribbean Kulture ( later WCK ) . WCK was among the most prominent of ' 80s Dominican soca bands . They began using native drum rhythms such as lapo kabwit and elements of the music of jing ping bands , as well as ragga @-@ style vocals . Bouyon is popular across the Caribbean , and is known as jump up music in Guadeloupe and Martinique . 
 The best @-@ known band in the genre was Windward Caribbean Kulture " WCK " in 1988 by experimenting a fusion of Jing Ping and Cadence @-@ lypso . While the Cadence @-@ lypso sound is based on the creative usage of acoustic drums , an aggressive up @-@ tempo guitar beat , and strong social commentary in the local Creole language , this new music created by the " WCK " band focused more on the use of modern technology with strong emphasis on keyboard rhythmic patterns . 
 Bouyon has diversified into multiple subgenres . These include bouyon soca , bouyon @-@ muffin , <unk> , and bouyon gwada . 
 = = = Bouyon soca = = = 
 Bouyon soca : , sometimes referred to as Jump up soca , is a fusion @-@ genre that typically blends old bouyon rhythms from the ' 90s and soca music . Bouyon soca , is a term coined by non @-@ Dominican producers and musicians who wish to attribute the current success of bouyon music to other islands . In its native Dominica , the concept of bouyon soca is pretty much unheard of . Bouyon is a very specific and original genre and is very much distinguishable from its " colleague " Soca . 
 While there may have been the occasional fusion , Bouyon has always maintained a very clear , recognisable and obviously different style from soca . This style of bouyon music was originated in Dominica , but is also very popular in Saint Lucia , Guadeloupe and Martinique .

 Religious music , influenced by American gospel , has become an important part of Dominican popular music in the 1990s . Calypso has also retained much popularity in Dominica , as has Jazz . The band Impact has fused jazz with Caribbean music . Other styles include steelpan , which has declined popularity despite the efforts of groups like Dancehall .

 The Caribbean Carnival is an important part of Dominican culture . Originally featuring masquerade songs ( chanté mas ) and other local traditions , traditional Carnival , Mas <unk> , came to be dominated by imported calypso music and steel bands in the early 1960s ; calypso appealed to Carnival @-@ goers because the lyrical focus on local news and gossip was similar to that of chanté mas , despite a rhythmic pattern and instrumentation which contrast sharply with traditional Dominican Mas <unk> music . After a fire in 1963 , the traditional Carnival was banned , though calypso and steelpan continued to grow in popularity . Modern Carnival on Dominica takes place on the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday , and is a festive occasion during which laws against libel and slander are suspended . The modern Dominican Carnival is heavily based on the Trinidadian celebration , but is not as commercialized due to a lack of corporate sponsorship . 
 The World Creole Music Festival takes place on the island of Dominica , in Festival City , Roseau , which is run by the governmental Dominica Festivals Commission . The National Independence Competitions are an important part of Dominican musical culture . They were founded by Chief Minister of Dominica Edward Olivier Leblanc in 1965 , and promote the traditional music and dance of Dominica . The government of Dominica also promotes Dominican music through the Dominican Broadcasting Station , which broadcasts between 20 % and 25 % local music as a matter of policy . 
 = Negros fruit dove = 
 The Negros fruit dove ( Ptilinopus arcanus ) is a species of bird in the pigeon and dove family , Columbidae . It is endemic to the island of Negros in the Philippines . This fruit dove is known from a single female specimen collected from the slopes of Mount Kanlaon in the northern part of the island . While it was found at a high elevation , it is suspected that the species originally lived in the lowland dipterocarp forests and was driven to higher elevations by habitat destruction . While some have suggested that the specimen is either a runt or a hybrid instead of a valid species , this is not widely accepted . The female Negros fruit dove was a small fruit dove with vivid dark green plumage and an ashy @-@ grey forehead . It had a distinctive ring of bare yellow skin around its eye , and yellow fringes to some of its feathers gave it the appearance of having a yellow wingbar when perched . The throat was white , while the undertail and vent were yellow . 
 The original specimen was shot along with a bird suspected to be its mate from a fruiting tree . Nothing else is known about its behavior . The species has not been definitively reported since its original discovery in 1953 , and as several searches of Mount Kanlaon and the surrounding forests have not discovered any sign of the bird , many believe that it may be extinct . However , a local hunter from southern Negros claimed to have shot it the nineties , and the discovery of many species formerly thought endemic to Negros on the nearby island of Panay have given some hope that the species may persist . As such , it is currently listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN . Any surviving population would be very small , likely numbering fewer than 50 individuals , and would be threatened by habitat destruction and hunting . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The Negros fruit dove was described in 1955 as Ptilinopus arcanus by Sidney Dillon Ripley and Dioscoro <unk> on the basis of a single female specimen collected by <unk> on May 1 , 1953 . This specimen , collected near Pula on the slopes of Mount Kanlaon in the Philippines , was shot along with a second bird , presumed to be its mate , which was lost in the undergrowth . The holotype is preserved as a skin by Yale University 's Peabody Museum of Natural History . The generic name Ptilinopus comes from the Ancient Greek words ptilon " feather , " and pous , " foot . " The specific name arcanus comes from the Latin word <unk> " secret . " 
 Some authors have suggested that the specimen was either a runt of either the yellow @-@ breasted fruit dove or a <unk> pigeon , or a hybrid instead of a unique species ; however , these views are generally considered invalid due in part to the distinctiveness of the specimen , particularly in the bare skin around the eye , and no proper evidence has suggested that the Negros fruit dove is an invalid species . It is uncertain where the dove should be placed within the genus Ptilinopus as the male 's plumage , a key feature used in organizing the Ptilinopus doves , is unknown . It has been suggested that the Negros fruit dove is either most closely related to the black @-@ naped fruit dove or represents an early colonization of the Philippines by the genus that has left no surviving close relatives . It has no known subspecies and is also known as Ripley 's fruit dove .

 The Negros fruit dove is a small , short @-@ tailed fruit dove . Only the appearance of the adult female is known as the presumed male specimen was lost in the undergrowth . The female is a vivid dark green overall with an ash @-@ grey forehead above an extensive ring of bare yellow skin that surrounds the eye . The greater coverts and tertial feathers have broad yellow fringes that create a narrow , if conspicuous , wingbar when the wing is folded .

 The Negros fruit dove is believed to be endemic to the island of Negros in the central part of the Philippines . However , some hope exists that the bird may persist undetected on a nearby island . The only known birds were collected from a forest at the edge of a clearing on Mount Kanlaon at an elevation of about 1 @,@ 100 m ( 3 @,@ 600 ft ) . The forest was noted as being " halfway between the genuine lowland dipterocarp forest type ... and the real mid @-@ mountain forest type . " It is suspected that the species preferred habitat at a lower altitude , and that the collected pair may have been driven to higher elevations by deforestation in the lowlands . 
 = = Ecology and behavior = = 
 The sole sighting of the Negros fruit dove involved a pair of birds seen eating at a fruiting tree . No other information is known about its behavior . 
 = = Status = = 
 The species has not been recorded since the original pair of Negros fruit doves were shot in May 1953 at Mt Kanlaon . However , a local hunter in southern Negros claimed to have shot it in the nineties , which has given hope that the species may still exist , and as such the IUCN lists the Negros fruit dove as Critically Endangered , as any surviving population is likely to number fewer than 50 birds . If the species still exists , it is likely that habitat destruction for agriculture , timber , and charcoal @-@ burning and hunting , a common problem for all other pigeons on Negros , are major threats . 
 As numerous collectors had visited Negros prior to 1953 and did not record the species , it is likely that it was already very rare by the time of its discovery . It is suspected that the Negros fruit dove was originally a lowland species , but the destruction of forests in northern Negros forced the dove from its ideal habitat and led to its probable extinction . Today , no forest exists in northern Negros at an elevation lower than 750 m ( 2 @,@ 460 ft ) , and several searches in the 1990s of Mount Kanlaon and the surrounding area failed to discover any sign of the species ' continued existence . Ornithological fieldwork has discovered that the nearby island of Panay is home to some species previously thought to be endemic to Negros , including the Negros bleeding @-@ heart . This discovery and the presence of unexplored lowland forests on Panay give hope that the Negros fruit dove may still exist in low numbers on a nearby island . Other than the depiction of the bird on a Philippine environmental education poster in the 1990s , no conservation measures have been enacted to protect any surviving population . 
 = Operation Summer ' 95 = 
 Operation Summer ' 95 ( Bosnian , Croatian : Operacija Ljeto ' 95 ) was a joint military offensive of the Croatian Army ( HV ) and the Croatian Defence Council ( HVO ) that took place north @-@ west of the Livanjsko field , and around Bosansko Grahovo and Glamoč in western Bosnia and Herzegovina . The operation was carried out between 25 and 29 July 1995 , during the Croatian War of Independence and the Bosnian War . The attacking force of 8 @,@ 500 troops commanded by HV 's Lieutenant General Ante Gotovina initially encountered strong resistance from the 5 @,@ 500 @-@ strong Army of Republika Srpska ( VRS ) 2nd Krajina Corps . The HV / HVO pushed the VRS back , capturing about 1 @,@ 600 square kilometres ( 620 square miles ) of territory and consequently intercepting the Knin — Drvar road — a critical supply route of the self @-@ declared Republic of Serbian Krajina ( RSK ) . The operation failed to achieve its declared primary goal of drawing VRS units away from the besieged city of Bihać , but it placed the HV in position to capture the RSK 's capital Knin in Operation Storm days later . 
 Operation Summer ' 95 was launched in response to the resumption of attacks by the VRS and the RSK military on the Bihać pocket — one of six United Nations Safe Areas established in Bosnia and Herzegovina . The area was viewed as strategic to the Croatian military effort by the HV General Staff because it presented an obstacle to the supply of the RSK and it pinned down a portion of the RSK military , as well as some VRS forces that would otherwise have been redeployed . The international community feared the worst humanitarian disaster of the war to that point would occur if the RSK or the VRS overran the Bihać pocket . The United States , France and the United Kingdom were divided about the best way to protect the pocket . 
 = = Background = = 
 In August 1990 , a revolution took place in Croatia ; it was centred on the predominantly Serb @-@ populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around the city of Knin , and in parts of the Lika , Kordun , and Banovina regions , and settlements in eastern Croatia with significant Serb populations . The areas were subsequently named the Republic of Serbian Krajina ( RSK ) . After declaring its intention to integrate with Serbia , the Government of Croatia declared the RSK a rebellion . By March 1991 , the conflict escalated into the Croatian War of Independence . In June 1991 , Croatia declared its independence as Yugoslavia disintegrated . A three @-@ month moratorium followed , after which the decision came into effect on 8 October . The RSK then initiated a campaign of ethnic cleansing against Croatian civilians , and most non @-@ Serbs were expelled by early 1993 . By November 1993 , fewer than 400 ethnic Croats remained in the UN @-@ protected area known as Sector South , and a further 1 @,@ 500 – 2 @,@ 000 remained in Sector North . 
 The Croatian National Guard ( ZNG ) was formed in May 1991 because the Yugoslav People 's Army ( JNA ) increasingly supported the RSK and the Croatian Police were unable to cope with the situation . The ZNG was renamed the HV in November . The establishment of the military of Croatia was hampered by a UN arms embargo introduced in September . The final months of 1991 saw the fiercest fighting of the war , culminating in the Battle of the Barracks , the Siege of Dubrovnik , and the Battle of Vukovar . 
 In January 1992 , the Sarajevo Agreement was signed by representatives of Croatia , the JNA and the UN , and fighting between the two sides was paused . After a series of unsuccessful ceasefires , the United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) was deployed to Croatia to supervise and maintain the agreement . A stalemate developed as the conflict evolved into static trench warfare , and the JNA soon retreated from Croatia into Bosnia and Herzegovina , where a new conflict was anticipated . Serbia continued to support the RSK , but a series of HV advances restored small areas to Croatian control as the siege of Dubrovnik was lifted , and Operation Maslenica resulted in minor tactical gains . In response to the HV successes , the RSK intermittently attacked a number of Croatian towns and villages with artillery and missiles . 
 As the JNA disengaged from Croatia , its personnel prepared to set up a new Bosnian Serb army ; Bosnian Serbs declared the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992 . Between 29 February and 1 March 1992 , a referendum on independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina — which would later be cited as a pretext for the Bosnian War — was held . Bosnian Serbs set up barricades in the capital Sarajevo and elsewhere on 1 March , and the next day the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and Doboj . In the final days of March , the Bosnian Serb army started shelling Bosanski Brod , and Sarajevo was attacked on 4 April . 
 The Bosnian Serb army — renamed the Army of Republika Srpska ( VRS ) after the Republika Srpska state proclaimed in the Bosnian Serb @-@ held territory — was fully integrated with the JNA . As 1992 carried on , it controlled about 70 % of Bosnia and Herzegovina . This was achieved through a large @-@ scale campaign of territorial conquest and ethnic cleansing which was backed by military and financial support from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . The war , which originally pitted Bosnian Serbs against non @-@ Serbs , evolved into a three @-@ sided conflict by 1993 when the Croat – Bosniak alliance deteriorated and the Croat – Bosniak war broke out . The Bosnian Croats declared a Herzeg @-@ Bosnia state with the intent of eventually joining Croatia . This was incompatible with Bosniaks ' aspirations of establishing a unitary state confronted by demands to partition the country . The VRS was involved in the Croatian War of Independence in a limited capacity , through military and other aid to the RSK , occasional air raids launched from Banja Luka , and most significantly through artillery attacks against urban centres , while the extent of territory it controlled did not change significantly until 1994 . 
 Ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Herzegovina happened on a larger scale than in the RSK , and all the major ethnic groups became victims of ethnically motivated violence . The conflict produced a vast number of displaced persons . It is estimated that there were over a million refugees in areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina outside VRS control at the end of 1994 , while the area 's total population was about 2 @.@ 2 million . About 720 @,@ 000 Bosniaks , 460 @,@ 000 Serbs and 150 @,@ 000 Croats fled the country . Croatia hosted a large proportion of the Bosniak and Croat refugees ; by November 1992 there were around 333 @,@ 000 registered , and an estimated 100 @,@ 000 unregistered , refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina in Croatia . The refugees left their homes under varied circumstances . The ethnic violence committed by Bosnian Serbs against civilians resulted in the greatest number of civilian victims in the Bosnian war , culminating in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 In November 1994 , the Siege of Bihać — a battle of the Bosnian War — entered a critical stage as the VRS and the RSK came close to capturing the town . A strategic area since June 1993 , Bihać had been one of six United Nations Safe Areas established in Bosnia and Herzegovina . The US administration considered that if Serb forces captured the city , the war would intensify and cause the worst humanitarian disaster of the war to that point . The US , France and the UK were divided about protecting the area . The US called for airstrikes against the VRS , but the French and the British opposed them , citing safety concerns and a desire to maintain the neutrality of French and British troops serving with the UNPROFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina . In turn , the US was unwilling to commit ground troops . According to David Halberstam , the Europeans recognized that the US was free to propose military confrontation with the Serbs while relying on the European powers to block any such move . French president François Mitterrand discouraged any military intervention , greatly helping the Serb war effort . The French stance reversed after Jacques Chirac became President of France in May 1995 ; Chirac pressured the British to adopt a more aggressive approach . Denying Bihać to the Serbs was also strategically important to Croatia , and Chief of the Croatian General Staff General Janko Bobetko considered that the fall of Bihać would end Croatia 's war effort . 
 In March 1994 , the Washington Agreement was signed , ending the Croat – Bosniak War , and providing Croatia with US military advisors from the Military Professional Resources Incorporated ( MPRI ) . The US involvement reflected a new military strategy endorsed by Bill Clinton in February 1993 . Because the UN arms embargo was still in place , the MPRI was hired ostensibly to prepare the HV for participation in the NATO Partnership for Peace programme . They trained HV officers and personnel for 14 weeks from January to April 1995 . It has also been speculated in several sources , — including The New York Times and various Serbian media reports , — that the MPRI may have provided doctrinal advice , scenario planning and US government satellite intelligence to Croatia . MPRI , American and Croatian officials have denied such claims . In November 1994 , the US unilaterally ended the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina , allowing the HV to supply itself as arms shipments flowed through Croatia . 
 The Washington Agreement also resulted in a series of meetings between Croatian and US government and military officials held in Zagreb and Washington , D.C. On 29 November 1994 , the Croatian representatives proposed to attack Serb @-@ held territory from Livno in Bosnia and Herzegovina , to draw off a part of the force besieging Bihać and to prevent its capture by the Serbs . As the US officials gave no response to the proposal , the Croatian General Staff ordered Operation Winter ' 94 the same day , to be carried out by the HV and the Croatian Defence Council ( HVO ) — the main military force of the Bosnian Croats . Besides contributing to the defence of Bihać , the attack shifted the line of contact of the HV and the HVO closer to the RSK 's supply routes . 
 On 17 July , the RSK and the VRS militaries started Operation Sword @-@ 95 , a push to capture Bihać by expanding on gains made during Operation Spider . The move provided the HV with a chance to extend their territorial gains from Operation Winter ' 94 by advancing from the Livno Valley . On 22 July , President of Croatia Franjo Tuđman and President of Bosnia and Herzegovina Alija Izetbegović signed the Split Agreement on mutual defence , permitting the large @-@ scale deployment of the HV in Bosnia and Herzegovina .

 The HV and the HVO fielded Operational Group <unk> , a combined force controlled by the HV Split Corps under command of Lieutenant General Ante Gotovina . The Operational Group comprised approximately 8 @,@ 500 troops arranged in two groups , and was directed against Bosansko Grahovo and Glamoč . The HVO troops were deployed against Glamoč and the HV force was arrayed in the Glamoč and Bosansko Grahovo areas . The defending force consisted of approximately 5 @,@ 500 troops drawn from the VRS 2nd Krajina Corps , commanded by Major General Radivoje Tomanić . The 2nd Krajina Corps was supported by the <unk> battlegroup put together by the RSK 7th North Dalmatian Corps and initially deployed to the Bosansko Grahovo area as a 500 @-@ strong unit in late 1994 . The area was additionally reinforced following the HV 's Operation Leap 2 in June 1995 , using three VRS brigades deployed to Bosansko Grahovo and Glamoč . The VRS @-@ deployed units were strengthened by platoons and companies transferred from seven brigades of the VRS 1st Krajina Corps and from three brigades of the VRS East Bosnian Corps .

 Operation Summer ' 95 started at 0500 on 25 July . The HV 7th Guards Brigade advanced north @-@ west along the Livno – Bosansko Grahovo road towards the town of Bosansko Grahovo — the offensive 's main objective . A composite company drawn from the HV 114th Infantry Brigade attacked VRS positions on the right flank of the advance . The 7th Guards Brigade managed to move forward by about 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 miles ) , but had to suspend its effort as the 114th Brigade company could not defeat the VRS ' entrenched defences at Marino Brdo to cover the 7th Brigade 's right flank . The VRS defences were well prepared all along the front line attacked by the HV and the HVO . The Bosansko Grahovo zone was particularly well prepared for defence — fortifications , shelters and covered trenches were built to establish defence in depth , with obstacles , including minefields , in between them . 
 The same day , the HV / HVO force advancing towards Glamoč — the offensive 's secondary objective — also met strong resistance from VRS troops . The HV 81st Guards Battalion advancing south @-@ east from the Šator Mountain to the rear of Glamoč broke forward the defences of the VRS 3rd Serbian Brigade . However , it paused its push after less than 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 miles ) because its right flank came into jeopardy when the HV and HVO units to their right were held back by the VRS 's determined defence . The 1st Croatian Guards Brigade ( 1 @.@ hrvatski gardijski zdrug - HGZ ) , the Bosnian Croat special police and the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Guards Brigade were blocked by the VRS holding a fortified position on a mountaintop between the Šator Mountain and Glamoč . The 2nd and 3rd Guards Brigades of the HVO attacking the VRS 5th Glamoč Brigade south @-@ west of Glamoč made little progress . The HVO 60th Guards Airborne Battalion and the 22nd Sabotage Detachment attacked in <unk> Hill south @-@ east of Glamoč , but they too made only marginal gains . 
 On 26 July , Gotovina deployed the 2nd Battalion of the 9th Guards Brigade to the Bosansko Grahovo axis . The battalion outflanked the VRS force blocking the HV 114th Infantry Brigade composite company and attacked the VRS defences from their rear . Even though the HV could not advance more than 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 miles ) , the move was sufficient to allow the HV 7th Guards Brigade to press on with their attack and push the VRS back by 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 miles ) that day , reaching within 7 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 3 miles ) from Bosansko Grahovo . The imminent threat to the town sitting astride the most significant route between the Republika Srpska and the RSK capital of Knin , became an urgent matter to the RSK . The 2nd Guards Brigade of the RSK Special Units Corps was ordered to disengage from the ARBiH 5th Corps in Bihać pocket area and move to Bosansko Grahovo to defend the town . A battalion of RSK police was also ordered to bolster the defence in the area . While the police battalion declined to deploy claiming that the General Staff had no authority over the police , the RSK 2nd Guards Brigade did not reach Bosansko Grahovo in time to contribute to the defence . 
 On the second day of the operation , the HV 1st Guards Corps and the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Guards Brigade outflanked the VRS mountaintop position between the Šator Mountain and Glamoč that had blocked them the previous day , allowing the HV 81st Guards Battalion to advance a further 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 miles ) and threaten to interdict a road used by the VRS to supply Glamoč from the north . To secure the high ground south of Glamoč , Gotovina released the 1st Battalion of the HV 1st Guards Brigade , supported by an anti @-@ terrorist unit of the HV 72nd Military Police Battalion , from the reserve and used them to attack VRS positions on the 1 @,@ 600 @-@ metre ( 5 @,@ 200 ft ) <unk> Mountain . The HVO units continued their attack towards Glamoč , achieving little progress . The HVO 2nd Guards Brigade only advanced 1 @-@ kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) towards Glamoč . By the end of its second day , Operation Summer ' 95 was suffering from delays . 
 On 27 July , Gotovina reinforced the Bosansko Grahovo axis by deploying the 4th Guards Brigade on the right flank . The brigade broke through the VRS defence in its sector , advancing about 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 miles ) and arriving within 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 miles ) of Bosansko Grahovo . Advances in the Glamoč area were still being achieved slowly . The Croatian Air Force took part in the attack the same day , using two MiG @-@ 21s to conduct airstrikes designed to disrupt the road network around Glamoč , violating a no @-@ fly zone imposed by the UN and enforced by NATO as Operation Deny Flight . 
 The HV 4th and 7th Guards Brigades defeated the VRS defences around Bosansko Grahovo on 28 July , and the two HV brigades captured the town that day . At the same time , the HV 81st Guards Battalion and the 1st HGZ , supported by the special police , moved north of Glamoč , reaching its outskirts and cutting the main route between the town and the rest of the Bosnian Serb @-@ held territory . After the HV threatened the VRS positions in Glamoč from their rear , defence of the town became less determined and the HVO 2nd Guards Brigade , the 60th Guards Airborne Battalion and the 22nd Sabotage Detachment broke through the VRS defences . HVO troops attacking from the south captured Glamoč on 29 July . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Gotovina assessed the VRS 's resistance to the HV and the HVO units early on during the battle as fierce , while former RSK officers said that the overall resistance of the VRS and the RSK battlegroup in Bosansko Grahovo area was not great . Of the attacking HV / HVO forces , 18 men were killed in action and 155 were wounded . Approximately 1 @,@ 600 square kilometres ( 620 square miles ) of territory changed hands and the Knin – Drvar road , vital to resupply of the RSK , was interdicted . The offensive displaced between 12 @,@ 000 and 14 @,@ 000 Serb refugees who fled towards Banja Luka . 
 On 30 July , the RSK declared a state of war and the RSK President Milan Martić stated that the Croatian territorial gains would soon be reversed in cooperation with the VRS . VRS Supreme Commander Colonel General Ratko Mladić visited Knin the same day , also promising to restore the territory lost that month . However , the RSK military concluded that the VRS had no units in western Bosnia capable of the attack . Analyses of the RSK military showed that the HV had saved the Bihać pocket for the second time and that it was preparing to attack the RSK at several points . Following the offensive , the RSK authorities reported fear and panic among the population caused by the conviction that the RSK could not defend itself against the HV . On 2 August , the RSK civil defence authorities ordered preparation for evacuation of the RSK , and the RSK prime minister Milan Babić asked the government ministers to prepare to move to Donji Lapac . Women and children started to evacuate to FR Yugoslavia , while a mobilization of the RSK military was largely completed by 3 August . 
 Operation Summer ' 95 failed to achieve its goal of relieving Bihać by drawing substantial RSK forces and the VRS away from the city to contain the HV / HVO advance . The RSK 2nd Guards Brigade was ordered to move from Bihać to Bosansko Grahovo , and it remained in the Knin area until the beginning of the following HV offensive , Operation Storm , on 4 August . The capture of Bosansko Grahovo and Glamoč by the HV and the HVO , their achievement of favourable positions to attack Knin and a large @-@ scale HV mobilization in preparation for Operation Storm caused the RSK to shift its focus from Bihać . On 30 July , RSK civilian and military leaders , Milan Martić and General Mile Mrkšić , met with a personal representative of Secretary @-@ General of the United Nations Yasushi Akashi and agreed upon a plan to withdraw from Bihać to prevent the expected Croatian offensive . Days later , the area captured in Operation Summer ' 95 was used as a staging area for the 4th and the 7th Guards Brigades ' advance into Knin in Operation Storm . The VRS 2nd Krajina Corps tried to retake Bosansko Grahovo on the night of 11 – 12 August . Their advance from the direction of Drvar broke through the HV 's reserve infantry left to garrison the area and reached the outskirts of the town , but was beaten back by two HV Guards battalions .

 The trocaz pigeon , Madeira laurel pigeon or long @-@ toed pigeon ( Columba trocaz ) is a pigeon which is endemic to the island of Madeira . It is a mainly grey bird with a pinkish breast ; its silvery neck patch and lack of white wing markings distinguish it from its close relative and probable ancestor , the common wood pigeon . Its call is a characteristic six @-@ note cooing , weaker and lower @-@ pitched than that of the wood pigeon . Despite its bulky , long @-@ tailed appearance , this pigeon has a fast , direct flight . 
 A scarce resident breeder in laurisilva forests , the trocaz pigeon lays one white egg in a flimsy twig nest . Its numbers fell sharply after human colonisation of the Madeira archipelago , and it vanished altogether from Porto Santo Island . The major cause of its population decline was habitat loss from forest clearance , but hunting and nest predation by introduced rats were also contributory factors . Protection of the laurel forests and a ban on hunting have enabled numbers to increase , so that the species is no longer endangered . 
 = = Description = = 
 The trocaz pigeon is a rather plain , dark grey bird 40 – 45 cm ( 15 @.@ 7 – 17 @.@ 7 in ) long with a 68 – 74 cm ( 26 @.@ 8 – 29 @.@ 1 in ) wingspan . The upper back has a violet sheen , becoming green on the back of the neck , and the neck sides are patterned with silver @-@ white . The tail is blackish with a wide , pale grey band , and the flight feathers are mainly black . The upper breast is pinkish , the eye is yellow , the bill has a yellow tip and a reddish @-@ purple base , and the legs are red . The sexes are similar in appearance , but the juvenile has generally browner plumage , with limited or no development of the silvery neck patch . Its closed wings have a scaly appearance due to pale buff feather edges . The trocaz pigeon 's voice is weaker and deeper than that of common wood pigeon , typically consisting of six syllables with the middle pair of notes extended and stressed : uh @-@ uh <unk> @-@ <unk> ho @-@ ho . When flying , it appears heavy and large @-@ tailed , although its flight is rapid and direct . 
 The common wood pigeon had a poorly defined Madeiran subspecies , Columba palumbus maderensis . This was paler than the trocaz pigeon and had white wing patches and a more extensive green iridescence on the nape , but it became extinct before 1924 . Bolle 's pigeon is more similar in appearance to the trocaz pigeon , although it lacks the whitish neck patch and has a more extensively pink breast . However , that species is endemic to the Canary Islands , so there is no range overlap . The only other pigeon currently present on Madeira is the feral pigeon ; this is slimmer , has more pointed wings and a much smaller tail . It often has dark wing markings , and a lighter flight . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The genus Columba is the largest within the pigeon family , and has the widest distribution . Its members are typically pale grey or brown , often with white head or neck markings or iridescent green or purple patches on the neck and breast . The neck feathers may be stiffened and aligned to form grooves . One of several subgroups within Columba consists of the widespread Eurasian common wood pigeon , Bolle 's pigeon , the trocaz pigeon , and the African <unk> pigeon . The two Macaronesian endemic pigeons , Bolle 's and trocaz , are thought to be derived from isolated island populations of C. palumbus . 
 The Atlantic archipelagos of the Canaries , Azores , and Madeira have a volcanic origin and they have never been part of a continent . The formation of Madeira started in the Miocene and the island was substantially complete by 700 @,@ 000 years ago . At various times in the past , the major islands of these archipelagos were all colonised by ancestral wood pigeons , which evolved on their respective islands in isolation from the mainland populations . Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences suggest that the ancestor of Bolle 's pigeon may have arrived in the Canaries about 5 mya , but an older lineage that gave rise to another Canarian endemic , the laurel pigeon , C. <unk> , may date from 20 mya . The most recent wood pigeon arrival on Madeira was that which gave rise to the subspecies C. palumbus maderensis . 
 The trocaz pigeon was formally described in 1829 by Karl Heineken , a German medical doctor and ornithologist who was living on Madeira at the time . He recognised it as different from the now @-@ extinct local form of the common wood pigeon , which he called the " <unk> " , and noted that the two pigeons never interbred or habitually associated together . He suggested designating the new species by its local name , " trocaz " . <unk> is a variant of Portuguese <unk> , the common wood pigeon ; both words are ultimately derived from the Latin <unk> , a collar , and refer to the bird 's coloured neck patches . This is a monotypic species , although in the past Bolle 's pigeon was sometimes regarded as a subspecies of the trocaz pigeon . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The trocaz pigeon is endemic to the mountainous subtropical Atlantic main island of Madeira , although it formerly also bred on the neighbouring Porto Santo Island . It mainly occurs on the northern slopes of the mountains , but smaller numbers are found in the south where suitable patches of laurel forest remain . 
 The natural habitat is tall laurisilva forest or dense tree heaths which are cloud @-@ covered for much of the year . The forests consist mainly of Azores Laurel , <unk> foetens , Til , Madeira Mahogany , Canary Laurel , Faya , Lily of the Valley Tree and the <unk> . The trocaz pigeon prefers primary forests , but secondary growth is used for feeding , and agricultural land is also visited , especially at times of fruit shortage . Most of the pigeons are found below 1 @,@ 000 m ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) , and their prime environment appears to be steep ravine @-@ indented slopes along artificial watercourses , with the occasional large dead laurel tree and much tree heath . This species is highly mobile between different areas at different times of year . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 Pigeons can breed from their first year , and nesting occurs throughout the year , although mainly from February to June . The displays are similar to those of the common wood pigeon ; the male climbs quickly in flight , gives a loud wing @-@ clap , and then glides down with his wings and tail spread . The display may be repeated two or three times before the bird returns to a perch . On the ground the male performs a bowing display with his neck inflated to show off the iridescent neck patches ; meanwhile , the tail is raised , fanned , then closed again . This display is usually accompanied by calling . The nest is a typical pigeon construction , a flimsy structure of twigs and grasses usually placed high in a tree in thick forest . One , rarely two , smooth white eggs are laid , although no nest with two chicks has ever been found . The eggs , 3 @.@ 0 – 5 @.@ 0 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 2 @.@ 0 in ) in size , are incubated for 19 – 20 days ; the young are able to fly in 28 days , and are independent within eight weeks . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The trocaz pigeon is exclusively herbivorous . Nearly 60 % of its diet is fruit , with most of the rest being leaves , and just 1 % is flowers . The fruits of Til , Azores Laurel and Persea indica , and the fruits and leaves of Small @-@ leaved Holly are the most frequently detected food items . Most seeds pass through the digestive system intact , apart from those of Azores Laurel , which are usually damaged . Fruit is the main component of the diet when it is readily available in autumn and winter , and leaves are consumed in spring and summer when fruits are scarce . In one study , 27 % of the leaves consumed came from native trees , especially Small @-@ leaved Holly , 61 % from herbs and shrubs , and nearly 10 % from introduced trees , mainly apples and peaches . This pigeon will feed in agricultural areas , where cabbage is the most commonly taken crop plant . Pigeon faeces from agricultural areas contain few native plants , and samples from forests have few crop species , so some individual birds may concentrate on crops . Feeding in cultivated land is commonest in winter , when fruit is readily available , so it appears not to be a shortage of natural foods that causes them to leave the forest , but is mostly opportunistic , resulting from the birds ' movements through nearby forest . However , when the fruit crop of Til and Azores Laurel is poor , large numbers of pigeons may leave the forest to feed on cabbage , flowering cherries and vine shoots . Competition for food with rats can be significant in parts of the island . 
 = = Status = = 
 The trocaz pigeon formerly bred on both the main island of Madeira and nearby Porto Santo Island . It was very abundant when the islands were first colonised by humans , but was extirpated on Porto Santo , and by 1986 had declined to about 2 @,@ 700 birds . Hunting was banned in that year , and there are now between 7 @,@ 500 and 10 @,@ 000 individuals in approximately 160 square kilometres ( 62 sq mi ) of suitable habitat . The losses on the two islands , the only inhabited ones in the archipelago , were largely the result of deforestation for wood and to create agricultural and grazing land . 
 The exclusion of livestock from the native forest allows the forest to regenerate and create more suitable habitat . Some illegal hunting and poisoning continues because of the damage this pigeon can do to crops , and the government allowed a cull in 2004 . Perhaps the main limiting factor on the rate at which the pigeon increases its numbers is predation by introduced black rats on its eggs and young . The Parque Natural da Madeira national park has a management plan for the trocaz pigeon , and it is hoped that an education campaign and the promotion of bird scarers may reduce persecution . Its increasing population means that it is now classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List , an improvement on its Threatened status in 1988 . This species is protected under the European Union Birds Directive , and the laurel forests under the Habitats Directive . 
 = Beyoncé ( album ) = 
 Beyoncé is the fifth studio album by American singer and songwriter Beyoncé , released on December 13 , 2013 , by Parkwood Entertainment and Columbia Records . Developed as a simultaneous audio @-@ visual medium , Beyoncé 's songs are accompanied by non @-@ linear short films that illustrate the musical concepts conceived during production . Its dark , intimate subject material includes feminist themes of sex , monogamous love and relationship issues , inspired by Beyoncé 's desire to assert her full creative freedom . 
 The album 's initial recording began in New York , where Beyoncé invited producers and songwriters to live with her for a month . During extensive touring the following year , the album changed as she conceived of creating a visual accompaniment to its songs and resumed recording sessions with electronic producer and rock musician Boots . Their collaboration led to more sonically experimental material , which combined rhythm and blues with electronic and soul music . Throughout this period , the album 's songs and videos were composed in strict secrecy as Beyoncé devised an unexpected release . 
 Beyoncé was released digitally to the iTunes Store without prior announcement or promotion . It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 , earning Beyoncé her fifth consecutive number @-@ one album in the country . The record sold 617 @,@ 000 copies in the U.S. , and 828 @,@ 773 copies worldwide in its first three days of availability , becoming the fastest @-@ selling album in the history of the iTunes Store . It was reissued in November 2014 as part of a platinum edition , along with an extended play of new songs . It received universal acclaim from critics who praised its exploration of sexuality , production and Beyoncé 's vocals . It has sold 5 million copies worldwide as of November 2014 , and has spawned the singles " XO " , " Drunk in Love " , " Partition " , " Pretty Hurts " and " Flawless " .

 On January 7 , 2012 , Beyoncé gave birth to her first child , Blue Ivy Carter , at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City . Two months after her labor , she announced a three @-@ night residency show called Revel Presents : Beyoncé Live at Revel Atlantic City 's Ovation Hall in May 2012 . The residency was announced soon after conceiving as she wanted to set an example to mothers that they need not halt their careers . After the Revel shows , Beyoncé spent her summer in The Hamptons , New York , where she mostly cared for Blue Ivy , but also began recording her next project . In early 2013 , Beyoncé sang " The Star @-@ Spangled Banner " at President Obama 's second inauguration and headlined the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show where there was expectation she would debut new music , although these rumors never materialized . She also released a self @-@ directed autobiographical documentary in February entitled Life Is But a Dream . 
 In March 2013 , a two @-@ part hip hop track entitled " Bow Down / I Been On " was released onto Beyoncé 's Soundcloud account . " Bow Down " , produced by Hit @-@ Boy , was written after Beyoncé woke up one morning with a chant stuck in her head , feeling angry and defensive , while the Timbaland @-@ produced second half , " I Been On " , uses a pitch @-@ distortion vocal as a homage to the Houston hip hop scene . Michael Cragg of The Guardian described the song as " brilliantly odd " , commending its loud , abrasive production . Pitchfork 's Lindsay Zoladz viewed the song as assertive and believed it served as an introduction of what was to come . " Bow Down / I Been On " was perceived as a significant departure from Beyoncé 's existing catalogue , particularly for its aggressive nature . The song 's atmosphere and its controversial " Bow down , bitches " refrain drew a mixed reaction from those who questioned whether the lyric was aimed at women or merely a moment of braggadocio . Beyoncé clarified after the album 's release , where elements of " Bow Down " appear on the track " Flawless " , that the song and its refrain were intended as a statement of female empowerment . 
 Beyoncé did not explain the intent behind the release of " Bow Down / I Been On " , leaving confusion as to how the song fit into the project . In mid @-@ 2013 , portions of other tracks , " Grown Woman " and " Standing on the Sun " , were used for television advertising campaigns . It was during this time the media reported that the album was delayed or scrapped , with one story alleging Beyoncé had scrapped fifty songs in favor of starting again . There was considerable confusion among music journalists and fans as Beyoncé engaged in extensive touring , yet avoided discussing the album or its release . 
 = = Recording = = 
 Recording sessions began in the summer of 2012 in The Hamptons , New York , where Beyoncé and her husband Jay @-@ Z were living . She invited producers and songwriters to accompany them , including Sia , Timbaland , Justin Timberlake and The @-@ Dream . Beyoncé described the atmosphere as unconventional , saying , " We had dinners with the producers every day , like a family ... it was like a camp . Weekends off . You could go and jump in the pool and ride bikes ... the ocean and grass and sunshine ... it was really a safe place . " She would spend the majority of her day with her newborn daughter , taking some hours out to record music . The album 's opening track " Pretty Hurts " , co @-@ written by Sia , was completed during these sessions . The project was suspended until 2013 and relocated to New York City 's Jungle City and Oven studios where most of the album was recorded . In an interview for Vogue in January 2013 , Jason Gay described Beyoncé 's attention to detail as " obsessive " when observing her studio , noting the vision boards she created for inspiration , which contained potential song titles , old album covers and pictures of performances . 
 In mid @-@ 2013 , newly discovered musician Boots , notable for fronting rock band Blonds , signed a publishing deal with Jay @-@ Z 's Roc Nation . In an interview for Pitchfork after the album 's release , Boots was coy when answering questions about how Beyoncé discovered his demo or of his work previous to the project , only confirming his signing . In June 2013 , they met in person for the first time and presented her with material he felt would resonate with her . However , Beyoncé was more interested in his experimental material , and he reluctantly played her the piano demo of " Haunted " on his cellphone , believing its instrumental to be lacklustre . She disagreed and refused to ignore it , saying " this shit has to knock harder than any rap album out there " . At a later meeting , he played her a stream of consciousness rap called " Ghost " , which he wrote after an exasperating meeting with a potential record label . Boots began by composing a melody that reminded him of a hypnotic state , then layering guitar arpeggios to resemble the work of English electronic musician Aphex Twin . Subsequently , " Ghost " became the first half of " Haunted " ; he later described Beyoncé as the " only visionary in the room " for her ability to find potential in scraps of songs . Following these sessions , Boots would go on to work on eighty percent of Beyoncé . 
 While recording in New York City , the previously @-@ released " Bow Down " was incorporated into a track that became " Flawless " . During its composition , Beyoncé was motivated to interpolate archive footage from her loss on the television competition Star Search as a child ; her resulting strength manifested itself into the more aggressive , dominant persona featured in the song . Additionally , a portion of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie 's TED talk " We Should All Be Feminists " was sampled on the same song as Beyoncé identified with her interpretations of feminism . Organic approaches were taken when writing and recording " Drunk in Love " and " Partition " . When working with Detail and Timbaland on a beat that became " Drunk in Love " , she was inspired by what she described as pure enjoyment , as both she and Jay @-@ Z free @-@ styled their verses for the track in the studio . Similarly , the bassline of " Partition " , which Beyoncé found reminiscent of hip hop music during her early romance with Jay @-@ Z , influenced her to accompany the track with sexual lyrics . She took to a microphone without pen and paper and rapped the first verse , finding herself initially embarrassed by the explicitness of the lyrics . When composing " Partition " , a rap known as " Yoncé " was used as the opening of the track , the beat of which was built by Justin Timberlake banging on buckets in the studio . 
 Only four songs were not recorded entirely in New York studios : " Superpower " and " Heaven " were partially recorded in California , " No Angel " was composed in London and " XO " in Berlin and Sydney . Although the demo of " XO " was recorded when Beyoncé had contracted a sinus infection , the vocals were never rerecorded as she felt their imperfections fit more appropriately . In October , the album began taking shape and " Standing on the Sun " and " Grown Woman " — songs which had been previewed in 2013 on television advertisements — were <unk> Beyoncé to fit in with its minimalist approach . During Thanksgiving week , the vocals on the album were edited and producers were notified to submit their final cuts . Beyoncé spent less time on vocal production than she had done with her previous projects , instead focusing on perfecting the album 's music . Beyoncé was mastered at Sterling Sound in New York . In total , 80 songs were recorded for the album . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Beyoncé is a fourteen track set with seventeen short films : a video for each audio track , two extra videos to accompany the two @-@ part tracks " Haunted " and " Partition " , as well as a bonus video for " Grown Woman " , which lacks an equivalent audio counterpart . Described by NME as " post @-@ dubstep tinted future R & B " , the album delves into the motifs of alternative R & B with emotive vocals , minimalist production and streams of consciousness . Several critics noted the album 's prominent fusion of electronic music with R & B and soul . The album 's dark , moody production was deemed Beyoncé 's most experimental record to date , with " subdued pulses , ambient effects and throbbing grooves that sneak up on you , threatening to explode " . Its vocal production is even more diverse ; several songs are half @-@ rapped and half @-@ sung with particular use of falsetto . Beyoncé also exercises her expansive vocal range , though unlike her previous releases , restrains from vocal belting and runs as to increase tension in the music . 
 Several critics identified the album 's central theme as sex . Having been a singer since the age of nine , Beyoncé expressed the restraint she felt by her responsibility as a role model for children , and , into her thirties during recording , desired to assert her creative freedom entirely . Much like her previous albums , the record is feminist , with greater exploration of gender issues and conflated with " an unwavering look at black female sexual agency . " Soraya McDonald of The Washington Post viewed Beyoncé as significant to black feminism as it celebrates black female sexuality in mainstream music and in the context of hip hop , where it is often only shown through the male perspective . The album 's other themes include fear , loss , the benefits and insecurities of monogamous love and motherhood , as well as darker issues , previously unexplored in her music , such as bulimia and postnatal depression . 
 The album 's opening track " Pretty Hurts " was written with Australian songwriter and recording artist Sia Furler . A neo soul and pop song , its intended as a self @-@ empowerment anthem that decries society 's obsession with harmful and unattainable standards of beauty . The song includes audio snippets of beauty pageants , where Beyoncé was a contestant in , to frame the song in the context of her childhood . The two @-@ part song " Haunted " begins with a stream of consciousness rap called " Ghost " which compares privileged lifestyles to that of the working class over a rhythm similar to that of a heartbeat . In its second @-@ half , she sings of being haunted by a lover over minimalist keyboards and a gradual , building beat that simulates a cold atmosphere . A duet with husband Jay @-@ Z , Beyoncé uses explicit lyrics in " Drunk in Love " to celebrate monogamous love . Her vocal styles are particularly prominent , with a fast @-@ rapped second verse and a chorus sung in her upper register . " XO " , intended as a tribute to the singer 's fans , is executed with " firework synths and a marching @-@ drum beat " . 
 " Blow " is a funk song that evokes the work of Janet Jackson , particularly her 1997 opus The Velvet Rope . Accompanied by jazz and disco elements , the song has a piano @-@ led electronic groove and a running cunnilingus metaphor in its chorus : " Can you eat my Skittles / That 's the sweetest in the middle " . Far more minimalist in its production , " No Angel " continues the album 's run of sexual songs . Over heavy bass , Beyoncé sings in a high falsetto of how she , and the object of her affections , are by no means perfect . The slow @-@ jam " Rocket " , written with Miguel and Justin Timberlake , harks back to the 1990s soul @-@ infused style of D 'Angelo . Described as a " slippery , six @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ minute funk excursion " with excessive double entendres , the song features Beyoncé adopting a slow , harmonious vocal . With a first @-@ half known as " Yoncé " , the two @-@ part hip hop track " Partition " begins with Beyoncé rapping over a Middle Eastern rhythm . The song is divided by a brief interlude of camera clicks and the sound of a car window , before launching into a second @-@ half that melds synthesizer pulses with finger snaps to create a bassline reminiscent of the work of Too Short and E @-@ 40 . Over this , the song follows a candid narrative that describes sex in the back of a limousine when travelling to a nightclub . 
 On several songs , Beyoncé demonstrates contentment with expressing all aspects of her personal life , in @-@ keeping with the album 's motif of self @-@ liberation . " Mine " , a collaboration with rapper Drake , is set against an understated , jazzy beat with lyrics that convey the singer 's everyday fears for her family , her postnatal depression and doubts of weakness in her marriage . " Jealous " functions similarly and contains a morose beat replete with echo sounds , which examines the female perspective on suspicion and revenge when taken for granted . The album 's most explicit commentary on gender , featuring an excerpt of a speech by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie on the socialization of girls , is found on " Flawless " . It presents an aggressive and confrontational stance , in which Beyoncé yells the refrain " Bow down , bitches " over a clattering beat . It starts and finishes with an excerpt from Beyoncé 's performance with Girl 's Tyme on Star Search when she was a child , intended to draw attention to her work ethic . " Superpower " is a doo wop @-@ inspired duet with Frank Ocean which is sung in their lower registers with harmonies similar to that of her work in Destiny 's Child . The album 's closing tracks " Heaven " and " Blue " are ballads . " Heaven " is an emotive , piano @-@ led hymn with gospel elements , and " Blue " is built on a piano melody over which Beyoncé sings of the love for her daughter , showcasing the extent of her range . The end of " Blue " features Blue Ivy Carter talking as a toddler .

 All of the music videos , including the bonus , " Grown Woman " , were released with the album on the iTunes Store . The videos were filmed between June and November 2013 as Beyoncé traveled on her world tour ; set locations included a roller @-@ skating rink she frequented as a child , a Brazilian beach , the Cyclone at Coney Island in New York , a Parisian château and a South American church . The project 's exclusive , surprise online release meant that the videos were shared through platforms such as Twitter , Instagram and Tumblr where they gained considerable exposure . Jenna Wortham of The New York Times identifies the choreography and lyric " I woke up like this " from the song " Flawless " as a moment that became instantly popular with fans and created a " ripple effect " across social networking platforms . 
 The visual aspect of the album was first considered by Beyoncé in June 2013 , when only three or four songs had been completed . She would often connect images , childhood memories , emotions and fantasies to songs she was in the midst of composing , and was subsequently motivated to shoot visuals to convey the concepts behind what she had conceived during production . Todd Tourso , who directed the videos for " Jealous " and " Heaven " , served as the creative director for the entire project . Much of his role concerned liaising between Beyoncé , who for most videos already had concepts , and the respective directors who also had propositions . As most videos were shot outside of the US , the crew surrounding the videos was kept small , consisting only of Tourso , the director of photography and producer , as well as Beyoncé and her stylist , make @-@ up artist and security . When filming in public , Beyoncé would wear in @-@ ear headphones instead of having the music played out loud , in order to prevent any snippets of the songs from being heard by the public . Many of the videos were shot without prior preparation , as the singer found enjoyment in the spontaneity of the filming locations and in resisting the urge to perfect them . The videos centered on Beyoncé 's sexuality and motherhood . Noting the visuals ' explicit content and exposure of her body , she found shooting them as liberating and was determined to demonstrate sexuality as a power that women should have , especially after giving birth . 
 Tourso designed Beyoncé 's album cover . The original mock up was submitted in Puerto Rico where Tourso directed the video for " Heaven " . Over the next three months , he considered over a hundred options for the cover , only to proceed with his original idea . He was inspired by the cover of Metallica 's 1991 eponymous fifth album to create a bold statement , specifically to deviate from a " beauty shot " of Beyoncé which he felt would be expected . Tourso used a font similar to boxing @-@ match placards to represent abrasive masculinity ; which was contrasted by the greyish @-@ pink font which he described as " a subversion of femininity " . 
 = = Release and reaction = = 
 Throughout 2013 , Beyoncé worked on the project in secrecy , sharing details of the album with a small circle of people and shifting the deadline , which was only finalized a week before its release . Secrecy was imposed as Beyoncé felt like album releases had lost meaning as a significant , exciting event in the face of hype created around singles and she wanted the album to be released unexpectedly . In July 2013 , a spokesperson for Beyoncé denied speculation that her album had been delayed , stating there was no official release date to begin with and that when a date is set , it would be announced via an official press release . 
 In early December 2013 , Beyoncé and her management company Parkwood Entertainment held meetings concerning its release with executives from Columbia Records and the iTunes Store , using the code name " Lily " for the album . On December 9 , 2013 , Rob Stringer , Chairman of Columbia Records , knowingly told media that the album would be released at some point in 2014 and it would be " monumental " . On December 13 , 2013 , the album was released without any prior announcement or promotion exclusively on the iTunes Store . Beyoncé explained that she was " bored " of her music being marketed as it had been done previously , and wanted its release to be a different experience for her fans . The album was available exclusively on iTunes Stores until December 20 , 2013 , when physical copies were distributed to other retailers . 
 As soon as the album became exclusively available to iTunes Stores , Sony Music Entertainment handed down an edict that forbade retailers to put the album up for pre @-@ order , as to further protect the exclusivity with iTunes . It was then reported that US retailers Target and Amazon refused to sell the physical copy of the album . According to a Target spokesperson , the store was only interested in retailing albums which were released digitally and physically simultaneously . On December 21 , 2013 , all the videos from the album were screened at the SVA Theater in New York . 
 The surprising release caused " hilarious , honest and hysterical " reaction among Beyoncé 's fans , and " shock " among other musicians . According to data provided by Twitter , the release generated over 1 @.@ 2 million tweets in 12 hours . Rolling Stone 's Rob Sheffield wrote , " Beyoncé has delivered countless surprises in her 15 years on top of the music world , but she 's never dropped a bombshell like this . The Queen Bey woke the world in the midnight hour with a surprise ' visual album ' – 14 new songs , 17 videos , dropped via iTunes with no warning . The whole project is a celebration of the Beyoncé Philosophy , which basically boils down to the fact that Beyoncé can do anything the hell she wants to . " Additionally , Peter Robinson of The Guardian hailed the shock release as " <unk> " , describing it as a " major triumph [ ... ] a masterclass in both exerting and relinquishing control . " Forbes Zack O 'Malley Greenburg 's included Beyoncé on his " Music Industry Winners 2013 " list , highlighting the unconventional release of her album . Music journalists have noted that the album 's release led to other artists adopting similar strategies , including Drake , D 'Angelo , Azealia Banks , J. Cole and Kid Cudi . In September 2014 , Harvard University 's Business School published a case study on the release strategy of the album which examines its difficult planning and execution , as well as its short @-@ term and long @-@ term impact .

 After the album 's release , Beyoncé performed " XO " during the remaining stops of the North American leg of The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour in December 2013 . In early 2014 , she performed " Drunk in Love " for the first time at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards on January 26 . " XO " ' s first televised performance was at the 2014 BRIT Awards on February 19 , 2014 , marking her first performance at the ceremony since the one held in 2004 . Later that month , songs from the album were added to the set list of the second European leg of The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour . All the music videos from the album were screened at the 2014 Los Angeles Film Festival on June 13 , 2014 along with commentary from three of the videos ' directors who were present at the ceremony . To further promote the album , Beyoncé embarked on her first co @-@ headlining stadium tour with Jay @-@ Z. The On the Run Tour kicked off in Miami on June 25 , 2014 and ended in Paris on September 13 , 2014 . A pre @-@ recorded performance of " Partition " from the tour was broadcast at the 2014 BET Awards on June 29 , 2014 .

 Upon release , Beyoncé received universal acclaim from music critics . Kitty Empire of The Observer praised the album for its " squeaky sexed @-@ up falsettos , hood rat rapping , wordless ecstasies and effortless swoops " . She found the album 's overt feminist message to be a particular highlight . In The Daily Telegraph , Neil McCormick applauded Beyoncé as " one of the most technically gifted vocalists in pop , with gospel power , hip @-@ hop flow and a huge range . " He also noted the album 's sexual tone and loose song @-@ structure as distinct features . Jon Pareles of The New York Times described the tracks as " steamy and sleek , full of erotic exploits and sultry vocals ; every so often , for variety , they turn vulnerable , compassionate or pro @-@ feminist " . He also noted they were " alert to the current sound of clubs and radio , but not trapped by it " . Noting the lack of " guaranteed hits " , NME found it to be Beyoncé 's most experimental work to date , particularly for its dark production and complex themes . 
 Pitchfork Media critic Carrie Battan concludes it is " her most explicit and sonically experimental music to date , exploring sounds and ideas at the grittier margins of popular music " . Spin 's Anupa Mistry felt it was Beyoncé 's best album and " more textured than its predecessors in both sound and content " . Mistry also believed the album signified her <unk> from " diva @-@ pop R & B [ ... ] into a different lane , albeit subtly and gracefully " . Andy Kellman of AllMusic called the album " a career highlight " and " her most entertaining and sexually explicit work , yet substantive in every respect . " . Nick Catucci , writer for Entertainment Weekly , found the singer indulging in " clashing impulses — between strength and escape , <unk> and fresh sounds , big messages and resonant lyrics " . Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club wrote that " without playing into cheap ' tortured by fame ' tropes , she 's made an emotional album that 's dense and substantial but never difficult or self @-@ important " . 
 Mof Gimmers who reviewed the album for The Quietus was fond of the confidence displayed on Beyoncé , calling it " a bold , expansive body of work " and " one of the strongest albums of the year " . PopMatters ' David Amidon praised the album 's honest , albeit highly sexual nature . He also observed it was " her first attempt at bridging an audience , making music that makes the men want to hear what she has to say and the women feel like they can say it to men as well " . Consequence of Sound viewed the album as " not concerned with moving units [ but ] with Beyoncé ’ s self @-@ exploration , in a complicated , incredibly intriguing way . " Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times believed the album presented a desire to push creative boundaries and particularly praised " how the music similarly blends the intimate and the extravagant " . In a less enthusiastic review , The Independent 's Andy Gill found its feminist message significant , but its music too similar to contemporary R & B.

 Despite being released in December when several publications had completed their year @-@ end lists , Beyoncé was ranked the best album of the year by Billboard , Houston Chronicle and Los Angeles Times , while Spin ranked it the best R & B album of the year . As of January 2015 , Billboard also named Beyoncé as the second best album of the 2010s ( so far ) .

 In his accompanying essay for The Barnes & Noble Review , Christgau remarked that the sex depicted on the album is " the raunchiest and most convincing I can recall on record , and married sex at that " . He also commended its density and " juicy physicality " suggesting " ideals of interactive performance absent from [ ... ] the regal self @-@ possession that stiffens Beyoncé 's supposedly more serious songs . " Geeta Dayal of Slate compared the album to Michael Jackson 's Thriller , calling it a " tour de force " and helped to reinstate ideas of " the album as an event [ ... ] as a grand , career @-@ defining statement . " The album has been described as the most sexually explicit since Madonna 's Erotica ( 1992 ) . GQ included it on their list of the best albums since 2000 because " the greatest female R & B artist of the century finally made a record as sexy , snarling , soft , strange , and outright superlative as she is . And by releasing it without warning [ she gave us ] a moment when we all listened to the same thing , at the same time " . Pitchfork ranked the album at number 14 on their list of the Top 100 Best Albums of the Decade , writing , " the real shock of Beyoncé was that a seasoned pro who looked to be headed toward adult @-@ contemporary blandness and inoffensive commercial tie @-@ ins had instead used the most adventurous means her money could buy to express an alternate vision of contemporary adulthood . " FACT magazine also included the album at number 9 on their list of the Top 100 Best Albums of the Decade So Far , writing that " what will be remembered most about Beyoncé isn 't its surprising release , but its surprising character .

 = 1962 South Vietnamese Independence Palace bombing = 
 The 1962 South Vietnamese Independence Palace bombing in Saigon was an aerial attack on 27 February 1962 by two dissident Vietnam Air Force pilots , Second Lieutenant Nguyễn Văn Cử and First Lieutenant Phạm Phú Quốc . The pilots targeted the Independence Palace , the official residence of the President of South Vietnam , with the aim of assassinating President Ngô Đình Diệm and his immediate family , who acted as his political advisors . 
 The pilots later said they attempted the assassination in response to Diệm 's autocratic rule , in which he focused more on remaining in power than on confronting the Vietcong , a Marxist – Leninist guerilla army who were threatening to overthrow the South Vietnamese government . Cử and Quốc hoped that the airstrike would expose Diệm 's vulnerability and trigger a general uprising , but this failed to materialise . 
 One bomb penetrated a room in the western wing where Diệm was reading but failed to detonate , leading the president to claim that he had " divine " protection . With the exception of Diệm 's sister @-@ in @-@ law Madame Nhu , who suffered minor injuries , the Ngô family were unscathed . However , three palace staff died and 30 were injured . Afterwards , Cử escaped to Cambodia , but Quốc was arrested and imprisoned . 
 In the wake of the airstrike , Diệm became hostile towards the American presence in South Vietnam . Diệm claimed that the American media was seeking to bring him down and he introduced new restrictions on press freedom and political association . The media speculated that the United States would use the incident to justify the deployment of combat troops to South Vietnam in the event the U.S. remained circumspect . Domestically , the incident was reported to have increased plotting against Diệm by his officers . 
 = = Planning = = 
 Cử was the second son of Nguyễn Văn Lực , a leader of the VNQDD ( Vietnamese : Vietnamese Nationalist Party ) , which opposed the Diệm regime . In 1960 , Diệm had jailed Lực for one month for engaging in " anti @-@ government activities " . The VNQDD planned that Cử and Quốc , another pilot from the same squadron , would attack the Independence Palace on 27 February . Quốc had recently been personally commended by Diệm for his achievements in combat , having been honoured as one of the best pilots in the Vietnam Air Force ( VNAF ) . Quốc had relatives who were involved with the VNQDD . Cử recruited Quốc by claiming the Vietnamese armed services and the United States were aware of the plot , showing him a Newsweek article critical of Diệm as evidence . 
 Quốc had more subordinates but was not sure of their loyalty , so he did not try to recruit them for the attack on the palace . Years later , Cử blamed Diệm 's treatment of opposition parties as the motivation for his attack . He believed that Diệm had prioritised remaining in power over fighting the VC and that , for six years , Cử had been denied promotion because of Diệm 's obsession with hindering political opponents . Cử criticised the Americans for having supported Diệm , saying : " the Americans had slammed the door on those of us who really wanted the fight against the communists " . 
 = = Attack = = 
 Quốc and Cử , who were trained in France and the United States , respectively , were given orders to fly from Saigon to the Mekong Delta in an early morning mission against the Vietcong ( VC ) , an armed Marxist guerilla army who wished to overthrow the government and who had backing from the Marxist government of North Vietnam . The communists had been involved in attacks on Army of the Republic of Vietnam units 60 km ( 37 mi ) south of the capital and had inflicted heavy damage . Instead of proceeding south as ordered , they changed course to attack the Independence Palace , the official presidential residence . This meant that two companies of communist guerrillas were able to retreat after their attack without counter @-@ attack . 
 At around 07 : 00 , the deer on the expansive lawns of the French colonial @-@ era palace were frightened off as Quốc and Cử — flying American @-@ built A @-@ 1 Skyraiders ( <unk> / AD @-@ 6 variant ) single @-@ seater ground attack planes — flew low over their target to inspect the ruling family 's residence . On their second run , they dropped bombs and napalm before firing rockets and strafing the presidential compound with machine @-@ gun fire . The two continued their runs for 30 minutes before units loyal to the president arrived and launched a counter @-@ attack . 
 Taking advantage of poor weather and low cloud cover , the two pilots circled the palace at altitudes of around 150 m ( 490 ft ) , periodically diving out of the clouds to re @-@ attack before darting back into them . The airstrike caught the Saigon garrison off guard and , in the confusion , they were unable to determine whether the aircraft were acting alone or with ground forces . Loyalist tanks and armoured personnel carriers rushed to their battle stations and anti @-@ aircraft batteries opened fire , nearly hitting the loyalist aircraft from Bien Hoa Air Base in pursuit of the two rebel planes . Two tanks and a number of jeeps armed with 50 @-@ calibre machine guns patrolled the smoke @-@ filled streets as a precaution . 
 The first 500 lb ( 230 kg ) bomb penetrated a room in the western wing where Diệm was reading a biography of George Washington . The bomb failed to detonate , which gave Diệm enough time to seek shelter in a cellar in the eastern wing . He was joined there by his elder brother Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục , younger brother Ngô Đình Nhu , Madame Nhu — who sustained an arm fracture while running toward the cellar — and their children . 
 Elsewhere within the palace , three servants and guards were killed , and about thirty more staff were injured . Outside the palace grounds , an American contractor died after falling from a rooftop where he had been watching the bombing . Despite the confusion , most of the city 's inhabitants went about their usual business , indifferent to the chaos . The attack lasted 30 minutes and though they carried enough bombs to level the palace , the pilots did not expend all their munitions . 
 Quốc 's aircraft was damaged by naval fire from a minesweeper , forcing him to eject over the Saigon River and land in <unk> <unk> , suffering minor facial injuries in the landing . He was arrested by a nearby naval patrol , and before being taken away for interrogation reportedly asked , " [ d ] id I kill that filthy character ? " Cử believed the attack had been successful and managed to safely flee to Cambodia . Commenting on the attack , a US Air Force officer opined : " [ w ] ith that weather , they did a hell of a job . " 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 In a brief radio address after order was restored , Diệm dismissed the attack as an " isolated act " and attributed his escape to " divine " protection . He visited the soldiers wounded in the attacks , and also promised the rebel pilots ' colleagues that they would not bear any responsibility for the bombing . 
 American President John F. Kennedy promptly sent a message denouncing the attack as a " destructive and vicious act , " and expressed relief that Diệm was " safe and unharmed . " US ambassador Frederick Nolting determined that the attack had been the result of " two isolated cases " and opined that the incident did not represent widespread dissatisfaction with the regime . 
 The absence of a Vietcong reaction led Nolting to label the bombing as a " limited scope , anti @-@ Communist assassination attempt " . The National Assembly , Diệm 's rubber stamp legislative body , urged the president to " take drastic measures against irresponsible elements " . General Minh , the presidential military advisor , attributed the assault to " disgruntled pilots " , and noted that no hostile troop movements had occurred . 
 The Civil Guard had remained loyal , and its commander ordered his airborne forces to take over Tan Son Nhut Air Base . A spokesperson for Diệm also denied that napalm had been used against the palace . This was widely believed because the government was sensitive to the ramifications of the air force being revealed to have such weapons in their stocks . He claimed the situation was under " complete control " . 
 The VNAF reacted to the two pilots ' actions by sending a resolution to Diệm , saying that the attack was an " absolutely isolated and foolish " event that " impaired the prestige of the air force " and was " detrimental to the national effort in the present struggle and is profitable to the Communists in their work of subversion " . The National Revolutionary Movement , an organization used by the Ngô family to stage orchestrated mass demonstrations in support of themselves , called for the death penalty against the two pilots and further asked Diệm to enact the " strictest measures to insure discipline in the military " . 
 As a result of the attack , Diệm ordered that all VNAF aircraft be grounded , and all aerial combat missions suspended while his security officials investigated fighter pilots for any possible anti @-@ regime tendencies . This was achieved by placing tanks on the runway at Bien Hoa Air Base . Without assistance from accompanying fighter craft , the U.S. deemed it too risky for American helicopters to operate in the jungles against the communists . 
 On 2 March , three days after the attack , Diệm allowed the air force to resume combat operations , having concluded that Cử and Quốc 's sentiments were not representative of the air force . For a few days after the attack , the areas around the palace were cordoned off and tanks were stationed at prominent streets in the capital . 
 Quốc was imprisoned for his actions , while Cử remained in exile in Cambodia where he worked as a language teacher . Diệm asked Cambodia to extradite Cử , but this request was refused . Cambodia 's Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Diệm had extremely hostile relations , and the Ngô family had tried to depose him in the past by funding coup attempts . 
 In 1959 , Nhu tried to assassinate Sihanouk by sending him a parcel bomb . As a result , Sihanouk routinely gave asylum to political refugees who had tried to depose or kill Diệm . In November 1960 , he had given asylum to a group of paratroopers who tried to depose Diệm . 
 In the meantime , Diệm 's police sought to track down Cử 's father , who had gone into hiding following the assassination attempt . After Diệm 's assassination in November 1963 , Quốc was released from prison and Cử returned from exile on 16 November , and they resumed their service in the air force . Quốc advanced to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in 18 months before being killed in an air raid over North Vietnam on 20 April 1965 . 
 = = = Diệm reaction = = = 
 During Nolting 's first meeting with Diệm after the assassination attempt , the president adamantly asserted that the media was responsible for the bombing . He pointed to the Newsweek article and other " derogatory articles in the press " , using them to justify his claim that " the Americans were supporting the revolution " . Diệm declared that while some journalists were portraying the bombing as a wake @-@ up call he saw it as " a warning to them — an indicator of the danger of their irresponsibility [ in fomenting disorder ] " . 
 In a later meeting with General Paul D. Harkins , head of the US military mission to Vietnam , Diệm joked : " I shouldn 't have put him in the air force , because I had put his father in jail years ago " . Diệm went on to predict that " sometime I 'm going to get shot right in the back of the neck . Sometime they 'll get me that way " . ( He and Nhu were deposed and shot dead during the November 1963 coup . ) Diệm reacted to the assassination attempt by cracking down on political dissidents and further tightening control of the press . Off the record , one official admitted that " [ w ] e don 't even talk about freedom of the press or ask for other liberties any more ... [ Diệm ] had completely surrounded himself in a protective oligarchy " . Nhu justified further anti @-@ opposition restrictions , remarking that " [ t ] here 's always going to be an opposition . If we take these people in , there will be another opposition springing up , because they are controversial men . " Madame Nhu added , " [ y ] ou open a window to let in light and air , not bullets . We want freedom , but we don 't want to be exploited by it . " 
 = = = U.S. reaction = = = 
 The attack generated speculation that the US would respond by deploying combat troops in South Vietnam . At that time , US military personnel officially held only advisory capacities . In the response to media concerns about the stability of the Diệm government , US Secretary of State Dean Rusk denied that the US had plans to deploy combat forces . He also ruled out negotiations with the Vietcong , saying " the root of the trouble " was communist violations of the Geneva Accords . 
 United States Ambassador to India John Kenneth Galbraith lobbied Kennedy against the deployment of combat troops , believing that it would lead to endless South Vietnamese requests for more troops . Galbraith further believed that wasting US resources in the jungles of Vietnam would be playing into the hands of the Soviet Union . According to one US observer , the palace bombing provoked " full scale plotting against Diệm " . Galbraith noted that " [ w ] hen the man in power is on the way down , anything is better " and considered that any change in South Vietnamese leadership would bring an improvement .

The commercial community known as Depot Town was built over the thirty years following the arrival of the railroad , and most of the buildings standing today were built from 1850 to 1880 . In the early years , Depot Town included a flour mill , a large farmers ' store , an iron foundry , a fire department , a clothing store , and paved streets . Ypsilanti 's original city hall and jail were built just across the Huron River from Depot Town on West Cross Street . As the depot was built one mile north of the Chicago Road ( now Michigan Avenue ) , the community of Ypsilanti was split between competing locations . 
 One of the earliest developments of note in Depot Town was the Western Hotel , built by Mark Norris . Opening in May 1839 , the Western Hotel stood on a triangular plot west of River Street and north of the railroad track . Around 1860 , the Michigan Central Railroad bought the land to replace the old wood plank depot with a newer , more modern brick depot . Norris demolished his hotel and carried the bricks across River Street , where he built a three @-@ story Italianate structure , which became known as the Norris Block . 
 In early 1860 , Depot Town experienced a large fire , which spread sparks so far that a barn one @-@ third of a mile away was destroyed . 
 Tunnels , originally built for water drainage , passed beneath the railroad and ran between the Thompson Block and the businesses on Cross Street , and were used as hiding places by escaped slaves , who hid by day and then rode boats down the Huron River by night . Leonard Chase , a known abolitionist , also operated a station on the Underground Railroad from 1841 to 1860 , hiding escaped slaves in his home near the depot . Also during the American Civil War , the Norris Block was used as a barracks by two regiments : the Fourteenth Michigan Infantry Regiment in early 1862 , and the Twenty @-@ Seventh Michigan Infantry Regiment in 1863 . Oliver E. Thompson bought the building in 1869 , and as it passed down through several generations of the Thompson family , it eventually became known as the Thompson Block . 
 The Michigan Central Depot was widely known for the gardens which surrounded it . The longtime gardener , John Laidlaw , built enormous arrangements that evoked Niagara Falls , the battleship Maine , and well @-@ known landscapes . 
 By the 1950s , railroad traffic declined and parts of Depot Town began to fall into disrepair . The Thompson Block was put up for sale in 1950 , standing vacant for more than a year . A series of businesses opened and closed in the building , with none finding lasting success . In the late 1960s , landlord David Kircher bought the building , using it as a warehouse . From 1996 until 2005 , the building was tied up in legal disputes . Kircher was found guilty of demolition by neglect , and first Barnes and Barnes and then Beal Properties were named receivers . In May 2006 , Stewart Beal purchased the building outright . 
 Amtrak passenger trains continued to stop in Depot Town until the early 1980s , ending round trip stops in 1982 , with the eastbound train , the Michigan Executive , making its last Ypsilanti stop in 1984 . 
 Depot Town is expected to be a stop on a proposed Ann Arbor to Detroit SEMCOG Commuter Rail line . However , there is no boarding platform , and it is not clear which side of the tracks a platform would be built on .

 The original Michigan Central Depot , from which the area took its name , no longer stands , but it was between the northeast side of the tracks and the west side of River Street , directly across from the freighthouse , since replaced by a parking lot . The freighthouse , built in 1878 , does still stand , and the area immediately around the freighthouse is home to the Depot Town Farmers ' Market , one of two farmers ' markets in Ypsilanti . Also in the freighthouse courtyard , a caboose sits parallel to Rice Street . 
 The freighthouse was closed in 2004 due to safety concerns . In early 2009 , the city of Ypsilanti and the Friends of the Ypsilanti <unk> received more than $ 600 @,@ 000 for repairs to make the freighthouse usable again . 
 At the northeast corner of Cross and River Streets stands the Thompson Block , a historic building which was used as barracks in the Civil War . The Thompson Block suffered a bad fire early in the morning on September 23 , 2009 , and the temporary supports reaching into adjacent streets , installed shortly after the fire to stabilize the structure , blocked westbound traffic on Cross Street for more than three months and have resulted in legal tussles between the city and the property owner . 
 At the southwest corner of the same intersection , the building housing Sidetrack Bar & Grill — which has held a bar and restaurant continuously since at least 1850 — has an unusual shape resulting from a 1929 train derailment . On an early January morning , the twelfth car , laden with lumber , of an 85 @-@ car freight train came off the tracks and crashed into the corner of the building . The owner of the building , who lived just above the section that was hit , was uninjured , but had most of her personnel effects scattered into the street . There were only a few people near the railroad crossing when it derailed including an 18 @-@ year @-@ old female who was knocked unconscious and a man who was sitting in his car , but was able to get away unharmed . When the current owners went to build a patio on the spot , they found some of the debris had been piled up underneath , which made it more difficult to dig post holes . In 1931 , the entrance to the building was moved from the east side to its current position on the north side to accommodate a post @-@ prohibition law requiring bar entrances to be at least 500 feet from any church . The back patio was constructed after the nearby church burned down . According to Sidetrack owner Linda French , the first @-@ floor walls are three bricks deep , with the oldest remaining bricks dating to the 1850s . 
 At the southeast corner of Cross and River Streets , the Ypsilanti Automotive Heritage Museum is housed in the last Hudson Motor Car Company dealership . In 1927 the business opened as " Hudson Sales & Service " , becoming " Miller Motors " in 1955 . After the discontinuance of the Hudson brand in 1958 , Miller Motors continued as a service and parts supplier for Hudson collectors . 
 On the east side of River Street , south from the Ypsilanti Automotive Heritage Museum across the railroad tracks , the Mill Works Building , originally a foundry , contains the Ypsilanti Food Co @-@ op and the River Street Bakery , owned by the co @-@ op . On the roof of the Mill Works Building , Solar <unk> installed 12 solar panels for the co @-@ op in April 2009 , followed by 30 panels for the bakery in 2010 , producing a total of 8 @.@ 3 kilowatts during peak sunlight . Data from the meters can be viewed at the Solar <unk> website , allowing anyone to compare generation from different sites . 
 Most of the buildings in Depot Town are two or three stories . At the east end , the Ypsilanti Automotive Heritage Museum building is a single story . East of Rice Street , the building facing Cross Street from the north is four stories , while the freighthouse behind it is a single tall story . Toward the west end of Depot Town , on both sides of Cross Street , there are several one @-@ story structures , which are of more @-@ recent construction than the taller buildings .

 Depot Town is immediately northeast of downtown Ypsilanti . Frog Island and Riverside Parks , both on the Huron River , are immediately to the west of Depot Town , and are often informally considered part of the district . A three @-@ way bridge , known as the " <unk> " , links the two parks and Depot Town over the Huron River . Just beyond Riverside Park , the Michigan Firehouse Museum is at the corner of Cross Street and Huron Street . Prospect Park , the oldest park in Ypsilanti , is one block west of Depot Town on Cross Street . The Corner Brewery , just north of Depot Town , is also commonly associated with the district , and Highland Cemetery is a half @-@ mile north of Depot Town on River Street . 
 Depot Town is also a half @-@ mile southeast of the campus of Eastern Michigan University . During " New Student Orientation " , Eastern provides students with gift certificates called " <unk> " , which can be used at many restaurants in Depot Town and downtown Ypsilanti . Students use the day , known as " <unk> " , to walk around the city and become acquainted with Ypsilanti .

 In addition to antique stores , a Michigan artisan market ( The Eyrie ) , tattoo parlor , record shop , fly fishing store , one of Ypsilanti 's two farmers ' markets & a variety of services including massage therapy , Russian ballet instruction , and motorcycle / auto repair ; Depot Town is home to several well @-@ known restaurants . Depot Town 's newest restaurant <unk> Mexican Cantina opened June 2014 serving fresh from scratch Mexican fare complimenting the other institutions on Cross St. Sidetrack Bar & Grill has occupied the southwest corner of the River Street @-@ Cross Street intersection since 1980 , while <unk> 's Saloon is in the last building on the north side of Cross Street . The Ypsilanti Food Co @-@ op , established in 1975 , moved into the Mill Works Building in the 1980s and in addition to groceries , sells sandwiches , salads , soups , and fresh bread from the bakery next door . 
 The River Street Bakery , also in the Mill Works Building and now owned by the Co @-@ op , claims to have the only wood @-@ fired brick oven in commercial use in Washtenaw County . Originally called the Depot Town Sourdough Bakery , the bakery was founded by Tom Kinney as an independent cooperative non @-@ profit with a $ 20 @,@ 000 loan from the Cooperative Whole Grain Education Association and pledges from prospective customers . To stretch the limited funds , the brick oven was built by hand in 1989 . From the beginning , the Ypsilanti Food Co @-@ op retailed the bread . 
 The Ypsilanti Automotive Heritage Museum is housed in the world 's last surviving Hudson Motor Car Company dealership , across the street from the Thompson Block . 
 The Depot Town Farmers ' Market , one of Ypsilanti 's two farmers ' markets , began near downtown in 1919 , moving several times before settling in the freighthouse in the late 1970s . Inside the freighthouse , the market operated year @-@ round , and included a coffee shop and frequent live music . Since the 2004 closure of the freighthouse due to structural concerns , the farmers ' market has operated seasonally only , in the courtyard just outside the freighthouse .

 Due to Michigan 's cold winter , the majority of Depot Towns events are held from late March to early October . There are many events that take place in and around Depot Town such as the Michigan Brewers Guild Summer Beer Festival , Michigan ElvisFest , the Ypsilanti Heritage Festival , Tuesday " bike " night , and Thursday " cruise nights " .

 The Michigan Brewers Guild Summer Beer Festival , established in 1997 , is held in Riverside Park on the fourth Saturday ( and the Friday evening before ) of July . Beginning in 2008 , the Brewers Guild set a goal to operate its beer festivals as " zero @-@ waste " events . They work closely with local recycling and composting companies , such as Recycle Ann Arbor , to manage the removal of any plastic , aluminum , paper , and food waste to ensure that as much of it as <unk> is recycled , composted , or used as animal feed . This has been achieved by requiring vendors to biodegradeable plates and flatware . Also , unlike many such events , the festival is self @-@ supporting without any outside sponsors . 
 In 2010 , the festival drew about 9 @,@ 000 attendees , despite " sweltering heat , torrential downpours , an overflowing Huron River , power blackouts and the possibility of tornadoes " . Fifty @-@ four Michigan breweries served around 350 different beers that year .

 = Flashback ( Ivy Queen album ) = 
 Flashback is the fifth studio album by Puerto Rican reggaetón recording artist Ivy Queen , released on October 4 , 2005 through Univision and on September 15 , 2007 as Greatest Hits in Germany and Spain . It is often considered as a studio @-@ compilation release due to the amount of the album being previously released material . Queen began working on Flashback after the moderate success of Real in early 2005 . Featuring content dating back to 1995 , when she was still a part of the all @-@ male group The Noise , the album includes four new pieces of work all produced by Rafi Mercenario , the genre 's most requested record producer at the time . 
 The four tracks were written and recorded after the end of Queen 's nine @-@ year marriage to Omar Navarro , months before the album 's release . Lyrically , the remaining sixteen tracks tell stories of female empowerment , love and heartbreak and sociopolitical criticism . Following an international tour of South America which began in 2004 and presentations in the United States , Ivy Queen partnered with the co @-@ founder of Perfect Image Records , José Guadalupe , to form her own record label Filtro Musik and signed a distribution deal with Univision Music Group in 2005 . She was previously signed to Guadalupe 's independent label Perfect Image Records which was distributed by Universal Music Latino . The Flashback Tour was launched in September 2005 to promote the album . 
 It spawned three singles , " Cuéntale " , " Te He Querido , Te He Llorado " , and " Libertad " , all of which reached the Top 10 of various Latin charts in the United States . Commercially successful in the Latin market , the album peaked at number ten on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart , becoming her highest peak on that chart , until 2007 when her sixth studio album reached number four . Despite selling 5 @,@ 000 copies in its first week , it failed to debut on the Billboard 200 . It also reached number seven on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart , number two on both the Billboard Top Heatseekers ( Pacific ) and Billboard Top Heatseekers ( South Atlantic ) chart . It reached number three on the newly instated Billboard Latin Rhythm Albums chart , making the album ineligible for the Tropical Albums and Reggae Albums charts , which had previously been dominated by Queen . 
 The album was met with generally positive reviews from music critics , who praised its lyrical content and musical production whilst some noticed that Queen 's 1998 duet with Haitian rapper Wyclef Jean , " In The Zone " , was missing from the track list . Critics also noted that there was scarce new material to be found on the album , but complimented the album 's track list . It became one of the best @-@ selling reggaetón albums of 2005 along with Real , when sales of both albums went " through the roof " . This gained Queen several nominations for awards . At the Billboard Latin Music Awards 2006 , it was nominated for " Reggaetón Album of the Year " and for " Urban Album of the Year " at the Premio Lo Nuestro 2007 award ceremony . It received a nomination for " Compilation Album of the Year " at the 2007 People 's Choice Reggaetón and Urban Awards . 
 = = Background = = 
 Following the commercial failure of her first two studio albums , Queen was dropped from the Sony label , and subsequently took a hiatus from her music career in 1999 . Beginning in 2001 , Queen began appearing on other artists ' reggaetón compilation albums from which many of the songs on this release originate . Queen returned to the music industry with her highly anticipated third studio album , Diva , which was critically acclaimed and later recognized as a factor in reggaeton 's mainstream exposure in 2004 along with Daddy Yankee 's Barrio Fino and Tego Calderon 's El Enemy de los Guasíbiri . Diva was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America . She then began working on her fourth studio album Real . It too was a commercial success , albeit to a lesser extent , despite initially being Queen 's debut full @-@ length English @-@ language studio album . She then embarked on the " Reggaeton Tour 2004 " which also featured other artist such as Aldo Ranks and La Factoria . The tour touched upon various South American countries , including her first in Ecuador , where she performed songs such as " Papi Te Quiero " and " Tu No Puedes " to promote both Diva and Real . This followed presentations in Atlanta , Brooklyn , and New York City , where she was designated as the " Puerto Rico Youth God Mother of the National Puerto Rican Day Parade " in June 2004 . 
 In June 2005 , Ivy Queen partnered with co @-@ founder of Perfect Image Records , José Guadalupe to form Filtro Musik . This stemmed from Guadalupe parting ways with the other co @-@ founder of Perfect Image , Anthony Pérez who in turn would launch his own label The Roof Records . Filtro Musik 's concept initially stemmed from its name which means " filter " in English . Guadalupe explained the title , saying " I 've been in this industry for 15 years now , and we have the ability to filter and pick the best " . In the coming year , Univision Music Group signed the label to licensing plan to release the album in September 2005 , which ensured that the " album was positioned in Latin and mainstream accounts that would normally not carry Latin product . " Ivy Queen was previously married to fellow reggaeton artist Omar Navarro , known by his stage name Gran Omar . They were divorced in 2005 shortly before the release of Flashback , which influenced the composition of the album . She denied ever having found him in the act of adultery , while claiming that if she had found Navarro with another woman , she 'd be in La Vega Alta , a prison for women in Puerto Rico . She also denied rumors that she had physically assaulted the woman she caught with Navarro . She stated they had not lived with each other for two months citing the " extensive travels of her husband and his workload of being a producer " as being causes to the end of the nine @-@ year marriage . 
 = = Songs and repertoire = = 
 Flashback is a " fusion of the past , present , and future , consisting of a totally contagious medley of the best hits and entrancing rhythms " . The album 's repertoire consists of previously released material along with four new melodies . " Cuéntale " ( " Tell Her " ) , the lead single off the album , has Ivy Queen exploring lyrically as she " plays a mistress who tells her lover to pick between her and his wife " . She explained " the mistress just gets tired of seeing him for a short time and listening to him complain about his unloving wife " . Musically , it features danceable grooves , synthetic instrumentation and synthesizers while taking influences from Afro Latin and reggae music ; it is set in minor key . " Marroneo " is the second of four newly produced tracks by Rafi Mercenario , " the most highly requested producer in reggaetón " at the time . It received comparisons to Daddy Yankee 's " <unk> " . " Si Una Vez " ( " If Once " ) was originally written by Pete Astudillo along with A.B. Quintanilla III and performed by American singer Selena in 1994 on her album Amor Prohibido . Ivy Queen 's interpolation of the lyrics tell a story of a " woman who looks back at a lover and wonders why she even loved the lout who abused her love " . She choose to cover " Si Una Vez " over other songs by Selena including " Como La Flor " ( " Like The Flower " ) and " La Carcacha " because it was the one she could identify with the most , being more inline with what Queen stands for ; citing Selena as her primary influence . The " reggaetón @-@ ed up twist " on Selena 's classic , features bitter @-@ romantic lyrics , synthetic instrumentation and synthesizers , while taking reggae influences similar to the original . " I feel honored to be able to sing one of Selena 's songs , " Queen explained . " She was the first artist to make a successful crossover before Jennifer Lopez and all the rest . " " Libertad " ( " Freedom " ) , the last of the four new tracks on the album was composed in minor key tonality . Queen appears infuriated in the lyrics as the songs takes influences from Afro @-@ Latin music . 
 " La Mala " ( " The Bad Girl " ) , originally featured on Don Omar 's reggaetón compilation album Los <unk> ( 2005 ) as " <unk> Tú " ( " According To You " ) , employs simple harmonic progressions and synthetic instrumentation . The album , which collectively brought together almost every top name in reggaetón at the time featured only one female artist , Ivy Queen . The song interpolates La Lupe 's songs " La Tirana " and " Puro Teatro " . The opening verse of " La Mala " directly cites these two songs . Following this , Queen describes " a tumultuous relationship , where Ivy is considered " la mala , " where in reality , " the male lover is responsible for its demise . " " Te He Querido , Te He Llorado " ( " I Have Love , I Have Cried " ) , the third and final single from Flashback was originally included on Mas Flow 2 , a reggaetón compilation album by Luny Tunes . The song is a blend of reggaetón and bachata music known as bachaton or <unk> , a musical movement in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico which combines bachata melodies and reggaeton style beats , lyrics , rapping , and disc jockeying . Queen makes use " bachata 's signature guitar sound " and " slower more romantic rhythm " while incorporating " bachata 's exaggerated emotional singing style " in this song as well as in " La Mala " . Composed in major key tonality it features simple harmonic progressions , " angry @-@ romantic " lyrics , Puerto Rican and Caribbean roots and Afro @-@ Latin as well as Caribbean influences according to the Music Genome Project . Lyrically , the song calls for violence and revenge over a former lover . It " evokes the story of Lupe 's " Amor Gitano " . It begins with Queen " declaring her unwavering love for her partner , " later describing him as a " liar , cheater , and abused who made her suffer . " Queen threatens her former lover with a dagger , threatening to kill him with it , telling of the horrible life that awaits him . Queen " reverses the typical bolero structure by actively rejecting the assumption that her role as the woman is to suffer , instead imagining that she would inflict particularly violent forms of suffering on her former male lover " . " Yo Soy La Queen " ( " I Am The Queen " ) , featured on a mid @-@ 1990 installment of The Noise , contains a " speedier rap over a quick @-@ thump hypnotic beat " . Taking influence from Caribbean music , roots of Puerto Rican and Caribbean music can be found on the track of only one minute and twenty seconds ; the shortest on the album . " Muchos <unk> <unk> " ( " Many Want To Knock Me Down " ) , alludes to a boxing match with the phrase " many want to knock me down " , and cites female empowerment as a prominent theme in the song . In addition to this , she degrades the thought of women 's power being underestimated . She speaks directly to men requesting that they not be cowards . She then argues that women are actively struggling for equality among their male peers , later asserting that " women are coming strong " . 
 " Al Escuchar Mi Coro " ( " Hear My Chorus " ) and " Reggae Respect " are from the same installment of the album . On the former , Gran Omar accompanies her , while both return to the early styles of " old school reggaetón " . " Como Mujer " ( " How Women " ) , included on Queen 's debut studio album En Mi Imperio ( 1996 ) is a sociopolitical themed song . Returning to more modern reggaetón , " Yo Voy Pal Party " ( " I 'm Going To Party " ) contains erotic and sensual lyrics in which Queen describes what she wants to do at a party with her lover . Composed in the minor key , roots from various Caribbean countries are prominent on the song . " Quiero Saber " ( " I Want To Know " ) , the second single off of Queen 's third studio album Diva ( 2003 ) , is a duet with Gran Omar . The song was produced by Luny Tunes , Noriega , and DJ Nelson . It was also one of the first songs Luny Tunes produced as a duo when Queen trusted their talent and gave them their first assignment . " Quiero Bailar " ( " I Want To Dance " ) , the lead single off of Diva and Queen 's first big hit , incorporates the Liquid riddim , a musical riddim produced by the " Jamaican cross @-@ over guru " Jeremy Harding . The song 's lyrics warn her dance partner not to misinterpret her moves . In the song , Queen clears away her partner 's misconception that their partnership will lead to sexual relations between them afterwards . " Yo Lamento " ( " I Regret " ) , formerly on Noriega 's compilation Contra La Corriente ( 2004 ) , titled " Amiga No <unk> " ( " Friend Do Not Think " ) , contains modern reggaetón rhythm . 
 " En La Disco " ( " In The Club " ) , originally from Escorpiones ( 2004 ) , features an Arabic @-@ influenced beat infused with reggaetón . Lyrically , Queen assures her lover that if she finds him in the club , she promises to dance with him disregarding what other people have to say about it . She assures him that there will be no other like her . " Miles De Voces " ( " Thousands Of Voices " ) , a hip hop track from Buddha 's Family ( 2001 ) , contains simple harmonic progressions , synthesizers , affronted lyrics and a sociopolitical theme while alternating between major and minor key . " La <unk> " ( " The <unk> " ) originates from Iván Joy 's Diamond Hits ( 2004 ) . While reviewing the compilation Reggaeton Diamond Hits ( 2006 ) , Steve Leggett , from Allmusic , named the song the highlight of the album . " <unk> La Distancia " ( " Although The Distance " ) was originally included on the compilation release Romances Del <unk> 2 ( 2003 ) by Baby Rasta & Gringo as " <unk> Mi Corazón " ( " My Heart Cries " ) . Queen 's rap contributes to a hip hop beat accompanied by Gran Omar . It is also known by the name of " Eres Mi Hombre " ( " You 're My Man " ) . " Yo Lamento " ( Salsa Version ) , also from Contra La Corriente , is essentially the same track only re @-@ recorded and mixed into salsa with a duration of four minutes and sixteen seconds ; the longest on the album and only salsa track . In the song , Queen sings to her friend about loving her friend 's man . She tells her that she had never intended to hurt her . Queen assures that she loves her friend , but acknowledges the fact that their friendship was lost . " He looked at me and we started dancing while the music took us away . Dancing , he touched me . My mind wasn 't thinking , passion was leading . My friend don 't think that I don 't love you " , she sings .

 The album was released on October 4 , 2005 to physical retailers through Univision Records . On August 29 , 2006 , Flashback was released digitally on Machete Music . A television commercial was commissioned to promote it . A year after the standard edition 's release , on October 4 , 2006 , an album by the name of Reggaetón Queen was released in Japan . It featured a similar tracklist with " Si Una Vez " , " Yo Soy La Queen " , " Al Escuchar Mi Coro " , " Como Mujer " , " Voy Pal Party " , and " En La Disco " not appearing on the album . Instead , the a cappella version of " Libertad " and its remix instrumental were included . In September 2007 , the album was released in Germany and Spain as Greatest Hits . " Cuéntale " , " Te He Querido , Te He Llorado " , and " Libertad " served as the album 's singles . In September 2005 , to coincide with the release of " Cuéntale " to radio , she launched The Flashback Tour . The former was released in December 2005 to radio respectively , while the latter was released to radio in February 2006 . A CD single of " Libertad " was also released with remixes of the song . On November 14 , 2006 , a five track extended play ( EP ) was released featuring the three singles plus " Quiero Saber " and " Quiero Bailar " to digital retailers . 
 In February 2005 , further promoting the album , she appeared at the " Festival of Puerto Rican Stars " , which was a historic achievement for reggaetón , as no other performer from the genre was invited to attend the event . In June 2005 , she appeared on the " Invasion Del Reggaetón Tour " with Daddy Yankee , which grossed $ 817 @,@ 220 for the week of June 18 . In September 2005 , she headlined the La Kalle 105 @.@ 9 Block Party concert at Madison Square Garden , which grossed $ 962 @,@ 390 for the week of November 19 , 2005 . She also attended and performed at the Billboard Bash ! , the night before the 2005 Billboard Latin Music Awards . She performed " Cuéntale " at the 2005 Premios Juventud . Ivy Queen interpreted " Te He Querido , Te He Llorado " on The Cristina Show in August 8 , 2005 . In October 2005 , it was announced that MTV Networks would launch a " new cable television network devoted to Caribbean music and culture . " In conjunction with the launch on November 21 , MTV Networks hosted " Caribbean Rising " , " a series of concerts featuring performances from more than 80 artists across genres such as reggae , dancehall , reggaeton , hip @-@ hop , and calypso . " Queen appeared at the Nevis concert , held on October 30 , 2005 . She appeared alongside Wyclef Jean , Luciano , and Morgan Heritage , among others .

 On the cover of the album , Queen appears in a " low @-@ cut , cleavage @-@ showing little black dress " , and is seen wearing various gold bracelets that cover her right eye . Similar to the cover for Real , the look sported by Queen is more sexually provocative . The change in image for Queen is attributed to Universal Latino feeling that the album Real had crossover potential to U.S. mainstream audiences . This is also attributed to Queen responding to the criticism she has received in the past for looking like a tomboy , wearing baggy pants and larger shirts , from the Puerto Rican press , middle class and members of the older generation , a subject Queen addresses in her autobiography , Detrás Del Glamour ( Behind Glamour ) . However , Queen took responsibility for this change in image , which she attributed to a " new growth in person " . She confessed the makeover stemmed from a " crisis " and " female vanity " . Seeking to <unk> her figure , Queen enlisted the help of a Colombian plastic surgeon . Her breast were augmented in July 2004 , during a promotional tour of the country . The album cover also features Queen 's signature long nails which she sports in a variety of colors ; in this case they are light blue and white .

 = = Reception = = 
 Flashback was met with generally positive reviews from music critics . Johnathan Widran of Allmusic praised the album giving it a three out of five stars . He started off the reviewing by stating that through the album , Ivy Queen can give insight into reggaeton to a person who is unknown to the genre . While noting that " In The Zone " with Wyclef Jean was missing from the album , he stated the it " has more than enough driving grooves , chunky beats , symphonic atmospheres , and infectious raps to compensate " . He noted that the songs " Te He Querido , Te He Llorado , " Yo Soy La Queen " , and " Reggae Respect " capture Queen 's " irrepressible inspirations , spirit , and vibe " . Lastly , he praised " Quiero Bailar " and " En La Disco " as tracks that get the party and people going . An editor for the Star Tribune called the album a " retrospective that also has a few new tunes " , later claiming that Queen knows how to " take shots at men " . An editor for Newsday said the album " cements her status as the Queen of Reggaetón and Latin hip hop " . Wayne Marshall writing for The Phoenix opinionated that the " retrospective of recent hits and career standouts , is a crucial primer on the reigning Queen of reggaeton " . Ramiro Burr of the San Antonio Express @-@ News saw the release of Flashback , along with Daddy Yankee 's Barrio Fino En <unk> ( 2005 ) and Don Omar 's The Last Don Live ( 2004 ) as releases that combine current hits , remixes , live renditions and previously unreleased material , because the artists haven 't had time to produce an all @-@ new album due to the genre 's demanding status , at the time . An editor for the Dominican Times claimed the album to be " as strong as she [ Queen ] is " and awarded the album four and a half stars out of five . Natasha Washington from <unk> claimed the album to cover " Queen 's 10 @-@ year singing career with 16 classic hits familiar in Latin markets , fresh to the United States , " while selecting " <unk> " , " Te He Querido , Te He Llorado " , " Si Una Vez " , " Marroneo " and " Libertad " as the stand out tracks . 
 According to Noche Latina 's <unk> Otero , Queen represented the ladies on Omar 's release Los <unk> with " Segun Tu " , showcasing that " she too is a musical outlaw herself " . According to Jesus Trivino of Latina magazine , " Te He Querido , Te He Llorado " is the best song released by Queen during " Reggaetón 's Golden Era " , which lasted between 2003 until 2007 . Ramiro Burr of Billboard stated that " Quiero Bailar " shows how effortlessly and quickly she alternately sings and raps , claiming that she has a distinct vocal style that evokes Gwen Stefani . Kid Curry , PD of Rhythmic Top 40 WPOW ( Power 96 ) cites Ivy Queen 's release of " Yo Quiero Bailar " as " the last reggaetón super @-@ hit " . The album along with the singles received multiple nominations for numerous awards . At the 2006 Billboard Latin Music Awards , it was nominated for " Reggaetón Album of the Year " . This became her second nomination for the same award twice in a row . At the Premio Lo Nuestro 2007 awards , it was nominated for " Urban Album of the Year " . When the 2007 People 's Choice Reggaetón and Urban Awards arrived , Queen ended up with three nominations , winning two of them . These were " Female Artist of the Year " and " Song with the Best <unk> of Lyrics " for " Te He Querido , Te He Llorado " . Flashback was nominated for " Compilation Album of the Year " . At the Premios Juventud 2005 awards , Queen was nominated for " Voice of the Moment , Female " and " Favorite Urban Artist " . At the Premios Juventud 2006 awards , she was again nominated for " Favorite Urban Artist " and awarded the first ever " Diva Award " , which honored the singer for her musical career . Queen was awarded " Best Reggaetón Singer " at the 2006 Premios Furia Musical . At the Broadcast Music , Inc . ( BMI ) Awards of 2007 , " Cuéntale " and " Te He Querido , Te He Llorado " were presented " Award @-@ Winning Songs " . " Cuéntale " was also nominated for " Best Latin / Reggaetón Track " at the 22nd Annual International Dance Music Awards , which was ultimately won Shakira and Wyclef Jean with their # 1 single " Hips Don 't Lie " .

 = Rain = 
 Rain is liquid water in the form of droplets that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor and then precipitated — that is , become heavy enough to fall under gravity . Rain is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the Earth . It provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems , as well as water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation . 
 The major cause of rain production is moisture moving along three @-@ dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as weather fronts . If enough moisture and upward motion is present , precipitation falls from convective clouds ( those with strong upward vertical motion ) such as cumulonimbus ( thunder clouds ) which can organize into narrow rainbands . In mountainous areas , heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation which forces moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall along the sides of mountains . On the leeward side of mountains , desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of the air mass . The movement of the monsoon trough , or intertropical convergence zone , brings rainy seasons to savannah climes . 
 The urban heat island effect leads to increased rainfall , both in amounts and intensity , downwind of cities . Global warming is also causing changes in the precipitation pattern globally , including wetter conditions across eastern North America and drier conditions in the tropics . Antarctica is the driest continent . The globally averaged annual precipitation over land is 715 mm ( 28 @.@ 1 in ) , but over the whole Earth it is much higher at 990 mm ( 39 in ) . Climate classification systems such as the Köppen climate classification system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes . Rainfall is measured using rain gauges . Rainfall amounts can be estimated by weather radar . 
 Rain is also known or suspected on other planets , where it may be composed of methane , neon , sulfuric acid , or even iron rather than water . 
 = = Formation = = 
 = = = Water @-@ saturated air = = = 
 Air contains water vapor , and the amount of water in a given mass of dry air , known as the mixing ratio , is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air ( g / kg ) . The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity ; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature . How much water vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated ( 100 % relative humidity ) and forms into a cloud ( a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth 's surface ) depends on its temperature . Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated . Therefore , one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it . The dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated . 
 There are four main mechanisms for cooling the air to its dew point : adiabatic cooling , conductive cooling , radiational cooling , and evaporative cooling . <unk> cooling occurs when air rises and expands . The air can rise due to convection , large @-@ scale atmospheric motions , or a physical barrier such as a mountain ( orographic lift ) . Conductive cooling occurs when the air comes into contact with a colder surface , usually by being blown from one surface to another , for example from a liquid water surface to colder land . <unk> cooling occurs due to the emission of infrared radiation , either by the air or by the surface underneath . <unk> cooling occurs when moisture is added to the air through evaporation , which forces the air temperature to cool to its wet @-@ bulb temperature , or until it reaches saturation . 
 The main ways water vapor is added to the air are : wind convergence into areas of upward motion , precipitation or virga falling from above , daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans , water bodies or wet land , transpiration from plants , cool or dry air moving over warmer water , and lifting air over mountains . Water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust , ice , and salt in order to form clouds . Elevated portions of weather fronts ( which are three @-@ dimensional in nature ) force broad areas of upward motion within the Earth 's atmosphere which form clouds decks such as altostratus or cirrostratus . Stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool , stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass . It can also form due to the lifting of advection fog during breezy conditions . 
 = = = Coalescence and fragmentation = = = 
 Coalescence occurs when water droplets fuse to create larger water droplets . Air resistance typically causes the water droplets in a cloud to remain stationary . When air turbulence occurs , water droplets collide , producing larger droplets . As these larger water droplets descend , coalescence continues , so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain . Coalescence generally happens most often in clouds above freezing , and is also known as the warm rain process . In clouds below freezing , when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall . This generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the crystal and neighboring water droplets . This process is temperature dependent , as supercooled water droplets only exist in a cloud that is below freezing . In addition , because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level , these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain . 
 Raindrops have sizes ranging from 0 @.@ 1 to 9 mm ( 0 @.@ 0039 to 0 @.@ <unk> in ) mean diameter , above which they tend to break up . Smaller drops are called cloud droplets , and their shape is spherical . As a raindrop increases in size , its shape becomes more oblate , with its largest cross @-@ section facing the oncoming airflow . Large rain drops become increasingly flattened on the bottom , like hamburger buns ; very large ones are shaped like parachutes . Contrary to popular belief , their shape does not resemble a teardrop . The biggest raindrops on Earth were recorded over Brazil and the Marshall Islands in 2004 — some of them were as large as 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 39 in ) . The large size is explained by condensation on large smoke particles or by collisions between drops in small regions with particularly high content of liquid water . 
 Rain drops associated with melting hail tend to be larger than other rain drops . 
 Intensity and duration of rainfall are usually inversely related , i.e. , high intensity storms are likely to be of short duration and low intensity storms can have a long duration . 
 = = = <unk> size distribution = = = 
 The final droplet size distribution is an exponential distribution . The number of droplets with diameter between <formula> and <formula> per unit volume of space is <formula> . This is commonly referred to as the Marshall – Palmer law after the researchers who first characterized it . The parameters are somewhat temperature @-@ dependent , and the slope also scales with the rate of rainfall <formula> ( d in centimeters and R in millimetres per hour ) . 
 Deviations can occur for small droplets and during different rainfall conditions . The distribution tends to fit averaged rainfall , while instantaneous size spectra often deviate and have been modeled as gamma distributions . The distribution has an upper limit due to droplet fragmentation . 
 = = = Raindrop impacts = = = 
 Raindrops impact at their terminal velocity , which is greater for larger drops due to their larger mass to drag ratio . At sea level and without wind , 0 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 020 in ) drizzle impacts at 2 m / s ( 6 @.@ 6 ft / s ) or 7 @.@ 2 km / h ( 4 @.@ 5 mph ) , while large 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 20 in ) drops impact at around 9 m / s ( 30 ft / s ) or 32 km / h ( 20 mph ) . 
 Rain falling on loosely packed material such as newly fallen ash can produce dimples that can be fossilized . The air density dependence of the maximum raindrop diameter together with fossil raindrop imprints has been used to constrain the density of the air 2 @.@ 7 billion years ago . 
 The sound of raindrops hitting water is caused by bubbles of air oscillating underwater . 
 The METAR code for rain is RA , while the coding for rain showers is <unk> . 
 = = = Virga = = = 
 In certain conditions precipitation may fall from a cloud but then evaporates or sublimes before reaching the ground . This is termed virga and is more often seen in hot and dry climates . 
 = = Causes = = 
 = = = Frontal activity = = = 
 <unk> ( a broad shield of precipitation with a relatively similar intensity ) and dynamic precipitation ( convective precipitation which is showery in nature with large changes in intensity over short distances ) occur as a consequence of slow ascent of air in synoptic systems ( on the order of cm / s ) , such as in the vicinity of cold fronts and near and poleward of surface warm fronts . Similar ascent is seen around tropical cyclones outside of the eyewall , and in comma @-@ head precipitation patterns around mid @-@ latitude cyclones . A wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front , with thunderstorms possible , but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass . Occluded fronts usually form around mature low @-@ pressure areas . What separates rainfall from other precipitation types , such as ice pellets and snow , is the presence of a thick layer of air aloft which is above the melting point of water , which melts the frozen precipitation well before it reaches the ground . If there is a shallow near surface layer that is below freezing , freezing rain ( rain which freezes on contact with surfaces in subfreezing environments ) will result . Hail becomes an increasingly infrequent occurrence when the freezing level within the atmosphere exceeds 3 @,@ 400 m ( 11 @,@ 000 ft ) above ground level . 
 = = = Convection = = = 
 Convective rain , or showery precipitation , occurs from convective clouds ( e.g. , cumulonimbus or cumulus congestus ) . It falls as showers with rapidly changing intensity . Convective precipitation falls over a certain area for a relatively short time , as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent . Most precipitation in the tropics appears to be convective ; however , it has been suggested that stratiform precipitation also occurs . <unk> and hail indicate convection . In mid @-@ latitudes , convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as cold fronts , squall lines , and warm fronts . 
 = = = Orographic effects = = = 
 Orographic precipitation occurs on the windward side of mountains and is caused by the rising air motion of a large @-@ scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge , resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation . In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds ( for example , the trade winds ) , a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side . Moisture is removed by orographic lift , leaving drier air ( see katabatic wind ) on the descending and generally warming , leeward side where a rain shadow is observed . 
 In Hawaii , Mount Waiʻaleʻale , on the island of Kauai , is notable for its extreme rainfall , as it has the second highest average annual rainfall on Earth , with 12 @,@ 000 mm ( 460 in ) . Systems known as Kona storms affect the state with heavy rains between October and April . Local climates vary considerably on each island due to their topography , divisible into windward ( <unk> ) and leeward ( Kona ) regions based upon location relative to the higher mountains . Windward sides face the east to northeast trade winds and receive much more rainfall ; leeward sides are drier and sunnier , with less rain and less cloud cover . 
 In South America , the Andes mountain range blocks Pacific moisture that arrives in that continent , resulting in a desertlike climate just downwind across western Argentina . The Sierra Nevada range creates the same effect in North America forming the Great Basin and Mojave Deserts . 
 = = = Within the tropics = = = 
 The wet , or rainy , season is the time of year , covering one or more months , when most of the average annual rainfall in a region falls . The term green season is also sometimes used as a euphemism by tourist authorities . Areas with wet seasons are dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics . Savanna climates and areas with monsoon regimes have wet summers and dry winters . Tropical rainforests technically do not have dry or wet seasons , since their rainfall is equally distributed through the year . Some areas with pronounced rainy seasons will see a break in rainfall mid @-@ season when the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon trough move poleward of their location during the middle of the warm season . When the wet season occurs during the warm season , or summer , rain falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours . The wet season is a time when air quality improves , freshwater quality improves , and vegetation grows significantly . 
 Tropical cyclones , a source of very heavy rainfall , consist of large air masses several hundred miles across with low pressure at the centre and with winds blowing inward towards the centre in either a clockwise direction ( southern hemisphere ) or counter clockwise ( northern hemisphere ) . Although cyclones can take an enormous toll in lives and personal property , they may be important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they impact , as they may bring much @-@ needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions . Areas in their path can receive a year 's worth of rainfall from a tropical cyclone passage . 
 = = = Human influence = = = 
 The fine particulate matter produced by car exhaust and other human sources of pollution forms cloud condensation nuclei , leads to the production of clouds and increases the likelihood of rain . As commuters and commercial traffic cause pollution to build up over the course of the week , the likelihood of rain increases : it peaks by Saturday , after five days of weekday pollution has been built up . In heavily populated areas that are near the coast , such as the United States ' Eastern Seaboard , the effect can be dramatic : there is a 22 % higher chance of rain on Saturdays than on Mondays . The urban heat island effect warms cities 0 @.@ 6 ° C ( 1 @.@ 1 ° F ) to 5 @.@ 6 ° C ( 10 @.@ 1 ° F ) above surrounding suburbs and rural areas . This extra heat leads to greater upward motion , which can induce additional shower and thunderstorm activity . Rainfall rates downwind of cities are increased between 48 % and 116 % . Partly as a result of this warming , monthly rainfall is about 28 % greater between 32 to 64 km ( 20 to 40 mi ) downwind of cities , compared with upwind . Some cities induce a total precipitation increase of 51 % . 
 Increasing temperatures tend to increase evaporation which can lead to more precipitation . Precipitation generally increased over land north of 30 ° N from 1900 through 2005 but has declined over the tropics since the 1970s . Globally there has been no statistically significant overall trend in precipitation over the past century , although trends have varied widely by region and over time . Eastern portions of North and South America , northern Europe , and northern and central Asia have become wetter . The Sahel , the Mediterranean , southern Africa and parts of southern Asia have become drier . There has been an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events over many areas during the past century , as well as an increase since the 1970s in the prevalence of droughts — especially in the tropics and subtropics . Changes in precipitation and evaporation over the oceans are suggested by the decreased salinity of mid- and high @-@ latitude waters ( implying more precipitation ) , along with increased salinity in lower latitudes ( implying less precipitation and / or more evaporation ) . Over the contiguous United States , total annual precipitation increased at an average rate of 6 @.@ 1 percent since 1900 , with the greatest increases within the East North Central climate region ( 11 @.@ 6 percent per century ) and the South ( 11 @.@ 1 percent ) . Hawaii was the only region to show a decrease ( − 9 @.@ 25 percent ) . 
 Analysis of 65 years of United States of America rainfall records show the lower 48 states have an increase in heavy downpours since 1950 . The largest increases are in the Northeast and Midwest , which in the past decade , have seen 31 and 16 percent more heavy downpours compared to the 1950s . Rhode Island is the state with the largest increase 104 % . McAllen , Texas is the city with the largest increase , 700 % . Heavy downpour in the analysis are the days where total precipitation exceeded the top 1 percent of all rain and snow days during the years 1950 @-@ 2014 
 The most successful attempts at influencing weather involve cloud seeding , which include techniques used to increase winter precipitation over mountains and suppress hail . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 = = = Patterns = = = 
 Rainbands are cloud and precipitation areas which are significantly elongated . Rainbands can be stratiform or convective , and are generated by differences in temperature . When noted on weather radar imagery , this precipitation elongation is referred to as banded structure . Rainbands in advance of warm occluded fronts and warm fronts are associated with weak upward motion , and tend to be wide and stratiform in nature . 
 Rainbands spawned near and ahead of cold fronts can be squall lines which are able to produce tornadoes . Rainbands associated with cold fronts can be warped by mountain barriers perpendicular to the front 's orientation due to the formation of a low @-@ level barrier jet . Bands of thunderstorms can form with sea breeze and land breeze boundaries , if enough moisture is present . If sea breeze rainbands become active enough just ahead of a cold front , they can mask the location of the cold front itself . 
 Once a cyclone occludes , a trough of warm air aloft , or " trowal " for short , will be caused by strong southerly winds on its eastern periphery rotating aloft around its northeast , and ultimately northwestern , periphery ( also known as the warm conveyor belt ) , forcing a surface trough to continue into the cold sector on a similar curve to the occluded front . The trowal creates the portion of an occluded cyclone known as its comma head , due to the comma @-@ like shape of the mid @-@ tropospheric cloudiness that accompanies the feature . It can also be the focus of locally heavy precipitation , with thunderstorms possible if the atmosphere along the trowal is unstable enough for convection . Banding within the comma head precipitation pattern of an extratropical cyclone can yield significant amounts of rain . Behind extratropical cyclones during fall and winter , rainbands can form downwind of relative warm bodies of water such as the Great Lakes . Downwind of islands , bands of showers and thunderstorms can develop due to low level wind convergence downwind of the island edges . Offshore California , this has been noted in the wake of cold fronts . 
 Rainbands within tropical cyclones are curved in orientation . Tropical cyclone rainbands contain showers and thunderstorms that , together with the eyewall and the eye , constitute a hurricane or tropical storm . The extent of rainbands around a tropical cyclone can help determine the cyclone 's intensity . 
 = = = Acidity = = = 
 The phrase acid rain was first used by Scottish chemist Robert <unk> Smith in 1852 . The pH of rain varies , especially due to its origin . On America 's East Coast , rain that is derived from the Atlantic Ocean typically has a pH of 5 @.@ 0 @-@ 5 @.@ 6 ; rain that comes across the continental from the west has a pH of 3 @.@ 8 @-@ 4 @.@ 8 ; and local thunderstorms can have a pH as low as 2 @.@ 0 . Rain becomes acidic primarily due to the presence of two strong acids , sulfuric acid ( H2SO4 ) and nitric acid ( HNO3 ) . Sulfuric acid is derived from natural sources such as volcanoes , and wetlands ( sulfate reducing bacteria ) ; and anthropogenic sources such as the combustion of fossil fuels , and mining where H2S is present . Nitric acid is produced by natural sources such as lightning , soil bacteria , and natural fires ; while also produced <unk> by the combustion of fossil fuels and from power plants . In the past 20 years the concentrations of nitric and sulfuric acid has decreased in presence of rainwater , which may be due to the significant increase in ammonium ( most likely as ammonia from livestock production ) , which acts as a buffer in acid rain and raises the pH . 
 = = = Köppen climate classification = = = 
 The Köppen classification depends on average monthly values of temperature and precipitation . The most commonly used form of the Köppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. Specifically , the primary types are A , tropical ; B , dry ; C , mild mid @-@ latitude ; D , cold mid @-@ latitude ; and E , polar . The five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as rain forest , monsoon , tropical savanna , humid subtropical , humid continental , oceanic climate , Mediterranean climate , steppe , subarctic climate , tundra , polar ice cap , and desert . 
 Rain forests are characterized by high rainfall , with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between 1 @,@ 750 and 2 @,@ 000 mm ( 69 and 79 in ) . A tropical savanna is a grassland biome located in semi @-@ arid to semi @-@ humid climate regions of subtropical and tropical latitudes , with rainfall between 750 and 1 @,@ 270 mm ( 30 and 50 in ) a year . They are widespread on Africa , and are also found in India , the northern parts of South America , Malaysia , and Australia . The humid subtropical climate zone where winter rainfall is associated with large storms that the westerlies steer from west to east . Most summer rainfall occurs during thunderstorms and from occasional tropical cyclones . Humid subtropical climates lie on the east side continents , roughly between latitudes 20 ° and 40 ° degrees away from the equator . 
 An oceanic ( or maritime ) climate is typically found along the west coasts at the middle latitudes of all the world 's continents , bordering cool oceans , as well as southeastern Australia , and is accompanied by plentiful precipitation year round . The Mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin , parts of western North America , parts of Western and South Australia , in southwestern South Africa and in parts of central Chile . The climate is characterized by hot , dry summers and cool , wet winters . A steppe is a dry grassland . Subarctic climates are cold with continuous permafrost and little precipitation . 
 = = Measurement = = 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Rain is measured in units of length per unit time , typically in millimeters per hour , or in countries where imperial units are more common , inches per hour . The " length " , or more accurately , " depth " being measured is the depth of rain water that would accumulate on a flat , horizontal and impermeable surface during a given amount of time , typically an hour . One millimeter of rainfall is the equivalent of one liter of water per square meter . 
 The standard way of measuring rainfall or snowfall is the standard rain gauge , which can be found in 100 @-@ mm ( 4 @-@ in ) plastic and 200 @-@ mm ( 8 @-@ in ) metal varieties . The inner cylinder is filled by 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) of rain , with overflow flowing into the outer cylinder . Plastic gauges have markings on the inner cylinder down to 0 @.@ 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 0098 in ) resolution , while metal gauges require use of a stick designed with the appropriate 0 @.@ 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 0098 in ) markings . After the inner cylinder is filled , the amount inside it is discarded , then filled with the remaining rainfall in the outer cylinder until all the fluid in the outer cylinder is gone , adding to the overall total until the outer cylinder is empty . Other types of gauges include the popular wedge gauge ( the cheapest rain gauge and most fragile ) , the tipping bucket rain gauge , and the weighing rain gauge . For those looking to measure rainfall the most inexpensively , a can that is cylindrical with straight sides will act as a rain gauge if left out in the open , but its accuracy will depend on what ruler is used to measure the rain with . Any of the above rain gauges can be made at home , with enough know @-@ how . 
 When a precipitation measurement is made , various networks exist across the United States and elsewhere where rainfall measurements can be submitted through the Internet , such as <unk> or GLOBE . If a network is not available in the area where one lives , the nearest local weather or met office will likely be interested in the measurement . 
 = = = Remote sensing = = = 
 One of the main uses of weather radar is to be able to assess the amount of precipitations fallen over large basins for hydrological purposes . For instance , river flood control , sewer management and dam construction are all areas where planners use rainfall accumulation data . Radar @-@ derived rainfall estimates compliment surface station data which can be used for calibration . To produce radar accumulations , rain rates over a point are estimated by using the value of reflectivity data at individual grid points . A radar equation is then used , which is , 
 <formula> , 
 where Z represents the radar reflectivity , R represents the rainfall rate , and A and b are constants . Satellite derived rainfall estimates use passive microwave instruments aboard polar orbiting as well as geostationary weather satellites to indirectly measure rainfall rates . If one wants an accumulated rainfall over a time period , one has to add up all the accumulations from each grid box within the images during that time . 
 = = = Intensity = = = 
 Rainfall intensity is classified according to the rate of precipitation : 
 Light rain — when the precipitation rate is < 2 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 098 in ) per hour 
 Moderate rain — when the precipitation rate is between 2 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 098 in ) - 7 @.@ 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 30 in ) or 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 39 in ) per hour 
 Heavy rain — when the precipitation rate is > 7 @.@ 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 30 in ) per hour , or between 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 39 in ) and 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) per hour 
 Violent rain — when the precipitation rate is > 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) per hour 
 <unk> for a heavy or violent rain include gully washer , trash @-@ mover and toad @-@ strangler . The intensity can also be expressed by rainfall <unk> . R @-@ factor 
 = = = Return period = = = 
 The likelihood or probability of an event with a specified intensity and duration , is called the return period or frequency . The intensity of a storm can be predicted for any return period and storm duration , from charts based on historic data for the location . The term 1 in 10 year storm describes a rainfall event which is rare and is only likely to occur once every 10 years , so it has a 10 percent likelihood any given year . The rainfall will be greater and the flooding will be worse than the worst storm expected in any single year . The term 1 in 100 year storm describes a rainfall event which is extremely rare and which will occur with a likelihood of only once in a century , so has a 1 percent likelihood in any given year . The rainfall will be extreme and flooding to be worse than a 1 in 10 year event . As with all probability events , it is possible , though improbable , to have multiple " 1 in 100 Year Storms " in a single year .

 The Quantitative Precipitation Forecast ( abbreviated QPF ) is the expected amount of liquid precipitation accumulated over a specified time period over a specified area . A QPF will be specified when a measurable precipitation type reaching a minimum threshold is forecast for any hour during a QPF valid period . Precipitation forecasts tend to be bound by synoptic hours such as 0000 , 0600 , 1200 and 1800 GMT . Terrain is considered in QPFs by use of topography or based upon climatological precipitation patterns from observations with fine detail . Starting in the mid to late 1990s , QPFs were used within hydrologic forecast models to simulate impact to rivers throughout the United States . Forecast models show significant sensitivity to humidity levels within the planetary boundary layer , or in the lowest levels of the atmosphere , which decreases with height . QPF can be generated on a quantitative , forecasting amounts , or a qualitative , forecasting the probability of a specific amount , basis . Radar imagery forecasting techniques show higher skill than model forecasts within 6 to 7 hours of the time of the radar image . The forecasts can be verified through use of rain gauge measurements , weather radar estimates , or a combination of both . Various skill scores can be determined to measure the value of the rainfall forecast .

 = = = Effect on agriculture = = = 
 Precipitation , especially rain , has a dramatic effect on agriculture . All plants need at least some water to survive , therefore rain ( being the most effective means of watering ) is important to agriculture . While a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy plants , too much or too little rainfall can be harmful , even devastating to crops . Drought can kill crops and increase erosion , while overly wet weather can cause harmful fungus growth . Plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive . For example , certain cacti require small amounts of water , while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year to survive . 
 In areas with wet and dry seasons , soil nutrients diminish and erosion increases during the wet season . Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime . The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season , as the crops have yet to mature . Developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest , which occurs late in the wet season . Rain may be harvested through the use of rainwater tanks ; treated to potable use or for non @-@ potable use indoors or for irrigation . Excessive rain during short periods of time can cause flash floods . 
 = = = In culture = = = 
 Cultural attitudes towards rain differ across the world . In temperate climates , people tend to be more stressed when the weather is unstable or cloudy , with its impact greater on men than women . Rain can also bring joy , as some consider it to be soothing or enjoy the aesthetic appeal of it . In dry places , such as India , or during periods of drought , rain lifts people 's moods . In Botswana , the Setswana word for rain , pula , is used as the name of the national currency , in recognition of the economic importance of rain in this desert country . Several cultures have developed means of dealing with rain and have developed numerous protection devices such as umbrellas and raincoats , and diversion devices such as gutters and storm drains that lead rains to sewers . Many people find the scent during and immediately after rain pleasant or distinctive . The source of this scent is <unk> , an oil produced by plants , then absorbed by rocks and soil , and later released into the air during rainfall .
