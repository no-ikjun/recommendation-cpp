 Usher 's publicist , Patti Webster , resigned on August 1 , 2008 . Usher rehired Patton as his manager on August 6 , 2008 and " dissolved his management arrangement with Benny Medina " . At the time of the split from Medina , Here I Stand had sold two million copies worldwide compared to Confessions ' nineteen million copies ; some speculated that the disunion was because of the poorer album sales . Medina said that he and the singer " parted ways amicably " , and deflected comments that he was responsible for the lower album sales . He pointed out that Here I Stand and " Love in This Club " reached number one on the US charts , and that the music industry had changed since the release of Confessions . Due to the lower sales , Here I Stand was seen as a commercial failure . According to Tyler Lewis from PopMatters its failure was spurred by Usher 's marriage to Foster : " his fanbase hated his wife " . 
 Usher filed for divorce from Foster in June 2009 , stating that their marriage was " irretrievably broken " . " Papers " , the first single from Usher 's next album Raymond v. Raymond ( 2010 ) , discussed the divorce process , although it was recorded before the couple split .

 = Xerochrysum bracteatum = 
 Xerochrysum bracteatum , commonly known as the golden everlasting or <unk> , is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae native to Australia . Described by Étienne Pierre Ventenat in 1803 , it was known as Helichrysum bracteatum for many years before being transferred to a new genus Xerochrysum in 1990 . It grows as a woody or herbaceous perennial or annual shrub up to a metre ( 3 ft ) tall with green or grey leafy foliage . Golden yellow or white flower heads are produced from spring to autumn ; their distinctive feature is the papery bracts that resemble petals . The species is widespread , growing in a variety of habitats across the country , from rainforest margins to deserts and subalpine areas . The golden everlasting serves as food for various larvae of lepidopterans ( butterflies and moths ) , and adult butterflies , hoverflies , native bees , small beetles , and grasshoppers visit the flower heads . 
 The golden everlasting has proven very adaptable to cultivation . It was propagated and developed in Germany in the 1850s , and annual cultivars in a host of colour forms from white to bronze to purple flowers became available . Many of these are still sold in mixed seed packs . In Australia , many cultivars are perennial shrubs , which have become popular garden plants . <unk> , long @-@ stemmed forms are used commercially in the cut flower industry . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 French botanist Étienne Pierre Ventenat described the golden everlasting as <unk> bracteatum in his 1803 work Jardin de Malmaison , a book commissioned by Napoleon 's first wife Joséphine de Beauharnais to catalogue rare plants that she had collected and grown at the Château de Malmaison . The Latin species name bracteatum refers to the papery bracts ( often mistakenly called petals ) of the flower heads . Henry Charles Andrews transferred it to the genus Helichrysum based on the morphology of its receptacle in 1805 , and it was known as Helichrysum bracteatum for many years . Leo Henckel von Donnersmarck described it as Helichrysum lucidum in 1806 , and Christiaan Hendrik Persoon as Helichrysum <unk> in 1807 . It was given the name Bracteantha <unk> in 1991 , when Arne <unk> and Laurie <unk> placed the members that are known as <unk> of the large genus Helichrysum into a new genus Bracteantha , and designated B. <unk> as the type species . However , they were unaware that Russian botanist Nikolai <unk> had already placed X. bracteatum in the new , and at the time monotypic , genus Xerochrysum the previous year . This name was derived from the Greek words <unk> " dry " , and <unk> " golden " , likely relating to the nature of the distinctive bracts . Confusion existed for a decade , with Bracteantha appearing in literature and the horticultural trade until it was clarified in 2002 that the latter name took precedence . <unk> is the popular name for X. bracteatum in Europe , while in Australia it is known as an everlasting or paper daisy . An alternate name in 19th @-@ century Europe was <unk> . X. bracteatum itself is very variable and may represent several cryptic species . Alternately , the Tasmanian species Xerochrysum bicolor may be combined with it in future taxonomic revisions . 
 X. bracteatum and its relatives belong to the Gnaphalieae or paper daisies , a large tribe within the daisy family , Asteraceae . However , a 2002 molecular study of the Gnaphalieae has indicated the genus Xerochrysum is probably polyphyletic , as the two species sampled , X. bracteatum and X. viscosum , were not closely related to each other . X. bracteatum has been recorded hybridising with X. viscosum and X. <unk> in cultivation , and possibly also <unk> <unk> and C. <unk> . 
 = = Description = = 
 The plant is an erect perennial , or occasionally annual , herb that is simple or rarely branched at its base . It generally reaches 20 to 80 cm ( 8 to 31 @.@ 5 in ) in height , but can have a prostrate habit in exposed areas such as coastal cliffs . The green stems are rough and covered with fine hairs , and are robust compared with those of other members of the genus . The leaves are lanceolate , elliptic , or oblanceolate in shape and measure 1 @.@ 5 to 10 cm ( 0 @.@ 59 to 3 @.@ 94 in ) long and from 0 @.@ 5 to 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 20 to 0 @.@ 79 in ) wide . They are also covered with cobwebby hairs . Sitting atop tall stems above the foliage , the flower heads range from 3 to 7 cm ( 1 to 3 in ) in diameter . Occasionally , multiple heads arise from the one stem . Like the flowers of all Asteraceae , they are composed of a central disc which contains a number of tiny individual flowers , known as florets ; these sit directly on an enlarged part of the stem known as the receptacle . 
 Around the disc is an <unk> of modified leaves , the bracts , which in Xerochrysum , as in most Gnaphalieae , are petal @-@ like , stiff , and papery . Arranged in rows , these bracts curl over and enclose the florets , shielding them before flowering . They create the impression of a shiny and yellow corolla around the disc . The intermediate bracts are sometimes white , while the outer ones are paler and often streaked reddish or brown ( a greater variety of colours are found in cultivars ) . These bracts are papery and dry , or ' scarious ' , with a low water content , unlike leaves or flower parts of other plants . They are made up of dead cells , which are unusual in that they have a thin primary and a thick secondary cell wall , a feature only found in sclerenchyma , or structural , cells , not cells of flowers or leaves . 
 The individual florets are yellow . Those on the outer regions of the disc are female , while those in the centre are bisexual . Female flowers lack stamens and have only a very short , tube @-@ shaped corolla surrounding a pistil that splits to form two stigmas , while bisexual or hermaphrodite flowers have a longer corolla , and ( as in virtually all members of the family ) five stamens fused at the anthers , with the pistil emerging from the center . The yellow corolla and pistil are located above an ovary with a single ovule , and surrounded by the pappus , the highly modified calyx of Asteraceae . It comprises a number of bristles radiating around the florets . Yellow in colour , they persist and are thought to aid in the wind dispersal of the 0 @.@ 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 12 in ) long fruit . The smooth brown fruit , known as a <unk> , is 2 to 3 mm long with the pappus radiating from one end . 
 In the wild , X. bracteatum can be distinguished from X. bicolor in Tasmania by its broader leaves and cobwebby hairs on the stems , and from X. <unk> in Western Australia by the flower head colour ; the latter species has white flower heads whereas those of X. bracteatum are golden yellow . Xerochrysum <unk> from alpine and subalpine areas of New South Wales , Victoria , and Tasmania is rhizomatous , and has markedly pointed orange bracts . The eastern Australian species X. viscosum may be distinguished by its rough and sticky leaves . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Xerochrysum bracteatum occurs in all Australian mainland states and territories , as well as Tasmania . Widespread , it is found from North Queensland across to Western Australia , and in all habitats excluding densely shaded areas . It grows as an annual in patches of red sand in Central Australia , responding rapidly to bouts of rainfall to complete its lifecycle . It is common among granite outcrops in southwest Western Australia , and is found on heavier and more fertile soils in the Sydney region , such as <unk> , <unk> , or limestone @-@ based soils , generally in areas with a high water table . Associated species in the Sydney Basin include blackbutt ( Eucalyptus pilularis ) in open forest , and the shrubs Empodisma minus and <unk> <unk> in swampy areas . It has been reported growing in disturbed soil , along roadsides and in fields in the New England region in the United States . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 The brightly coloured bracts act as petals to attract insects such as hoverflies , native bees , and small beetles that pollinate the florets . Grasshoppers also visit the flower heads . The caterpillars of <unk> <unk> have been recorded on this species , as have those of the Australian painted lady ( Vanessa <unk> ) . The tiny fruits are dispersed by wind , and germinate and grow after fire or on disturbed ground . 
 Flower production is related to increasing day length , and in general , plants produced the most flowers from December to March . Varying planting times or artificially changing light levels might be ways to increase production of flowers outside these months . 
 The water mould ( oomycete ) <unk> <unk> has infected commercial crops in Italy and California . In 2002 on the Ligurian coast , widespread infection of several cultivars , most severely ' Florabella Pink ' and to a lesser extent ' Florabella Gold ' and ' Florabella White ' , resulted in leaf blistering and the development of chlorotic lesions on the leaves , and white patches on the undersides , particularly in areas of poor ventilation . There was an outbreak of downy mildew in a cultivated crop of Xerochrysum bracteatum in San Mateo County , California in 2006 , in which the leaves developed large chlorotic lesions . A <unk> infection damaged X. bracteatum crops in the Czech Republic between 1994 and 2001 , causing poor growth , <unk> of foliage , and malformation of flower heads . Genetically , the pathogen was indistinguishable from the agent of aster yellows . The root @-@ knot nematode ( <unk> incognita ) attacks and forms galls on the roots , which leads to the morbidity or death of the plant . 
 = = Cultivation = = 
 X. bracteatum had been introduced to cultivation in England by 1791 . German horticulturist Herren <unk> obtained material and developed it at his nursery in Arnstadt near Erfurt in Germany . He bred and sold cultivars of many colours from bronze to white to purple , which spread across Europe in the 1850s . The bracts of these early forms tended to remain cupped around the flower head rather than flatten out like the native Australian forms . These were also annual rather than perennial forms . Many were given cultivar names such as ' <unk> ' ( dark scarlet flower heads ) , ' <unk> ' ( dark blood @-@ red flower heads ) , ' aureum ' ( golden yellow flower heads ) , ' bicolor ' ( red @-@ tipped yellow flower heads ) , ' <unk> ' ( large multicoloured flower heads ) , ' <unk> ' ( large rose @-@ edged white flower heads ) , and ' <unk> ' ( flower heads with many bracts ) , although today they are generally sold in mixed seed for growing as annuals . Some coloured forms of South African Helichrysum are thought to have been introduced to the breeding program , which resulted in the huge array of colours . X. bracteatum was one of several species that became popular with European royalty and nobility from the early 19th century , yet were little noticed in Australia until the 1860s , when they became more prominent in Australian gardens . 
 Most of the cultivars brought into cultivation in Australia in the latter part of the 20th century are perennials . ' Dargan Hill Monarch ' was the first of these , and many more have followed . <unk> flowering , these grow in many colours including white , yellow , orange , bronze , pink , and red . Their commercial lifespans are generally around three years . Queensland @-@ based company Aussie Winners has a range of compact plants ranging from orange to white known as <unk> . Plants of this series usually have larger leaves . This range won the Gran <unk> d 'oro at the <unk> exposition in Geneva in 2001 , for the best new plant series in the previous three years . ' Florabella Gold ' , a member of the Florabella series , won the award for best new pot plant ( vegetative ) in the Society of American Florists ' competition of 1999 . The Wallaby cultivars are range of taller forms with narrow leaves and white , yellow or pink flowers . Other commercial ranges include the Nullarbor series , and Queensland Federation daisies , including ' <unk> Sunshine ' and ' Golden Nuggets ' . 
 X. bracteatum is easy to grow both from seeds and from cuttings , although named cultivars only grow true from cuttings . Plants benefit from pruning of old growth in winter to allow for new growth in spring . Dead @-@ heading , or pruning off old flower heads , promotes the production of more flowers . Fresh seeds germinate in 3 to 20 days and require no special treatment . Plants grow best in acid , well @-@ aerated soils of pH 5 @.@ 5 to 6 @.@ 3 , with low levels of phosphorus . They are sensitive to iron deficiency , which presents as yellowing ( chlorosis ) of the youngest leaves while the leaf veins remain green . 
 X. bracteatum can be grown in large pots or window boxes , and is a good pioneer plant in the garden until other plants become more established . Lower @-@ growing cultivars are suitable for hanging baskets and border plantings . The flowers attract butterflies to the garden . Dried flowers are long lasting — up to some years — and are used in floral arrangements and the cut flower industry . More robust longer stemmed forms are used for commercial cut flowers . The main factor limiting lifespan of dried flowers is the wilting of stems , so flowers are sometimes wired into arrangements . <unk> flowers in glycerol or polyethylene glycol also lengthens lifespan .

 Xerochrysum ' Dargan Hill Monarch ' was a natural form collected around 1 @.@ 6 km ( 0 @.@ 99 mi ) inland from Cunninghams Gap in southern Queensland in May 1961 , and registered in February 1977 . It is a low perennial shrub 60 to 80 cm ( 23 @.@ 5 to 31 @.@ 5 in ) high and 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) across . The foliage is grey and the large flowers are 7 – 9 cm in diameter and golden yellow in colour . It grows best in full sun and fair drainage . Cuttings strike readily , as does seed , although seedlings may differ from the parent . 
 Xerochrysum ' Cockatoo ' arose as a spontaneous hybrid between ' Dargan Hill Monarch ' and a white @-@ flowered perennial form of X. bracteatum , in the garden of Victorian plantsman Doug McKenzie in Ocean Grove near Geelong in Victoria . He applied to the Australian Cultivar Registration Authority ( ACRA ) for registration , which was granted in 1980 . It is a dense perennial shrub which reaches around 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) high and wide . The oblanceolate leaves measure 6 to 12 cm ( 2 @.@ 5 to 4 @.@ 5 in ) long and are covered with fine hairs that give them a greyish cast . Fine hairs also cover the stems . The flower heads have light lemon @-@ yellow bracts and orange discs and average 7 cm ( 3 in ) in diameter . They are held on long stems around 12 – 15 cm ( 4 @.@ 5 – 6 in ) above the foliage . Like all forms , it prefers full sun . Although a perennial , it loses vigour after a few years , at which time it is best replaced . The name ' Cockatoo ' was chosen as the shape and colour of the ray florets are reminiscent of the wing feathers of the sulphur @-@ crested cockatoo . 
 Xerochrysum ' Golden <unk> ' is a hybrid , bred by a deliberate backcross of ' Cockatoo ' to ' Dargan Hill Monarch ' by Doug McKenzie , who applied for registration with the ACRA in 1980 . ( It was granted in 1981 . ) It has much larger flower heads than both parents , yet is a smaller shrub , which reaches 40 cm ( 15 @.@ 5 in ) high by 70 cm ( 27 @.@ 5 in ) wide . Denser than that of other forms , the foliage is covered in fine grey hair . On stalks around 10 cm ( 4 in ) above the foliage , the flower heads measure up to 9 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) in diameter , although larger ones up to 10 cm are occasionally seen . They have around 300 bracts per flower head , compared with 80 for ' Dargan Hill Monarch ' and 200 in ' Cockatoo ' , giving them a " doubled " look . It is reported as producing fewer flower heads than ' Princess of Wales ' . 
 Xerochrysum ' Princess of Wales ' is a spontaneous hybrid , arising from a cross between ' Dargan Hill Monarch ' and an annual form . Arising in the Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra , it was selected by employee Peter <unk> in summer 1983 . He applied to register the cultivar with ACRA in March 1985 . It was named in honour of a visit by Diana , Princess of Wales to the gardens in November 1985 , the same month registration was granted . With compact foliage , this form reaches 60 cm ( 23 @.@ 5 in ) high and wide . Unlike its parent ' Dargan Hill Monarch ' , its foliage has hair only on the midrib on the leaf underside . It flowers very profusely , and the large flower heads are borne on stalks 5 – 9 cm ( 2 – 3 @.@ 5 in ) above the foliage . Unlike other forms , the stems wither and die naturally after flowering , making way for more new growth and flowers . The flower heads are golden yellow and measure 6 cm ( 2 @.@ 5 in ) across . 
 Xerochrysum ' Diamond Head ' was a natural form collected around Diamond Head in New South Wales , where it is quite common on bluffs and cliffs . John Wrigley , curator of the Australian National Botanic Gardens at the time , applied to the ACRA to have it registered , which it was in February 1977 . Found on an exposed headland in nature , it grows as a low mat @-@ like perennial shrub 8 cm ( 3 in ) high and 60 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 ft ) across . The foliage is green and rough and the flowers are 3 cm in diameter and yellow in colour with an orange disc . It makes an ideal plant for rockeries , and strikes easily from cuttings during the spring growing period . 
 Xerochrysum ' Hastings Gold ' was a natural form from Hastings Point to the east of Murwillumbah on the New South Wales far north coast . It is a perennial herb with green bushy foliage reaching 25 cm ( 10 in ) high and 70 cm ( 27 @.@ 5 in ) wide . The golden yellow flower heads measure 5 cm ( 2 in ) across and are held on stalks 20 cm ( 8 in ) above the foliage . It is smaller than the similarly coloured ' Dargan Hill Monarch ' and larger than ' Diamond Head ' . 
 Xerochrysum ' Nullarbor Flame ' was a selection introduced into cultivation in 1997 that produces abundant red flowers with yellow discs and a diameter of 4 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 8 in ) . The plant grows to 50 – 70 cm ( 19 @.@ 5 – 27 @.@ 5 in ) tall and 50 – 80 cm ( 19 @.@ 5 – 31 @.@ 5 in ) wide . 
 Xerochrysum ' Pink Sunrise ' was developed by <unk> Nurseries in Victoria in 1986 , of unknown origin , presumably a hybrid . It is a compact perennial that reaches 30 cm ( 12 in ) high and 60 cm ( 23 @.@ 5 in ) wide . The flower heads are pink in bud , before opening as cream with orange discs . 
 Xerochrysum ' White Monarch ' was a spontaneous garden hybrid that resembles ' Dargan Hill Monarch ' but with white flower heads with orange discs measuring up to 8 cm ( 3 in ) in diameter . 
 Xerochrysum ' Lemon Monarch ' resembles ' Cockatoo ' , but its lemon @-@ coloured flower heads have fewer bracts . It has bushy foliage . 
 Xerochrysum ' <unk> Yellow ' , patented as ' <unk> <unk> ' , is a form with large bright yellow flower heads averaging around 6 @.@ 3 cm ( 2 @.@ 5 in ) in diameter . The result of a planned breeding program in Gilroy , California , it was bred by Jason <unk> of Goldsmith Seeds from a lemon yellow @-@ flowered form crossed with a yellow @-@ flowered form in 2005 . The pollination occurred in May , the resultant seed was sown in September , and what was to become the clone was chosen in December for its large flower size , colour and compact foliage . 
 Xerochrysum ' Lemon Princess ' is thought to be a hybrid between X. bracteatum and X. viscosum .

 The island has a land area of 12 @.@ 83 ha ( 31 @.@ 7 acres ) with the southern part of the island rocky and elevated and the northern part covered by bigleaf maple and Western redcedar trees . It is the largest of the Wasp Island group , which includes Yellow Island , Reef Island , and others . 
 = = History = = 
 The island was originally known as Brown Island , named by Charles Wilkes for fourteen members of his United States Exploring Expedition crew who shared the same surname . It was later acquired by Victor McConnell , its first settler , who claimed squatters ' rights . 
 McConnell Island was purchased at the end of World War II by Thomas Gordon Thompson , a University of Washington professor and U.S. Army chemical warfare researcher who was later the namesake of the USNS Thomas Thompson and R / V Thomas Thompson . Thompson financed the purchase of the island through the sale of his valuable stamp collection and later built a home on it from native stone and driftwood . During his proprietorship of the remote island , Thompson used it to entertain friends and guests from the nearby Friday Harbor Laboratories . In one summer alone he received more than 700 visitors . 
 In 1997 a 3 @.@ 66 ha ( 9 @.@ 0 acres ) portion of the island was transferred to the San Juan Preservation Trust , a private conservation organization , to be used as a nature preserve . What is known as the Thompson Preserve includes 985 feet ( 300 m ) of protected shoreline as well as the original Thomas Thompson home . The rest of the island remains under private ownership . 
 = Edgar Speyer = 
 Sir Edgar Speyer , 1st Baronet ( 7 September 1862 – 16 February 1932 ) was an American @-@ born financier and philanthropist . He became a British subject in 1892 and was chairman of Speyer Brothers , the British branch of the Speyer family 's international finance house , and a partner in the German and American branches . He was chairman of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London ( UERL , forerunner of the London Underground ) from 1906 to 1915 , a period during which the company opened three underground railway lines , electrified a fourth and took over two more . 
 Speyer was a supporter of the musical arts and a friend of several leading composers , including Edward Elgar , Richard Strauss and Claude Debussy . He was chairman of the Classical Music Society for ten years , and he largely funded the Promenade Concerts between 1902 and 1914 . His non @-@ musical charitable activities included being honorary treasurer of the fund for Captain Scott 's Antarctic expedition . For his philanthropy he was made a baronet in 1906 and a Privy Counsellor in 1909 . 
 After the start of the World War I , he became the subject of anti @-@ German attacks in the Press . In 1915 , Speyer offered to resign from the Privy Council and to relinquish his baronetcy , but the Prime Minister turned down the offer . He resigned as chairman of the UERL and went to the United States . In 1921 , the British government investigated accusations that Speyer had traded with the enemy during the war , and had participated in other wartime conduct incompatible with his status as a British subject . Speyer denied the charges , but his naturalisation was revoked and he was struck off the list of members of the Privy Council .

 = = = Family = = = 
 Speyer was born on 7 September 1862 in New York City , the second son of German Jewish parents , Gustav Speyer and Sophia Speyer ( née Rubino ) from Frankfurt . His father was an international banker with businesses in Frankfurt , New York and London . Speyer was educated at the Realgymnasium in Frankfurt . On 10 February 1902 , in Hamburg , Speyer married the American violinist Leonora von Stosch . They had met at a concert held by Maude Valerie White at which Leonora performed . They had three daughters : Pamela , Leonora , and Vivien . 
 = = = Financier = = = 
 In 1884 , Speyer became a partner in each of his father 's businesses . He headed the Frankfurt office before taking control of the London office , Speyer Brothers , in 1887 . His older brother , James , headed the New York company . The firm specialised in arbitrage with Europe and the United States , and the financing of railway projects . On 29 February 1892 , Speyer became a naturalised British citizen . 
 Speyer Brothers ' involvement in railway finance brought Speyer into contact with American Charles Yerkes in 1900 . In Chicago , Yerkes had led the development of the city 's urban transport system , and he went to London to capitalise on the emerging opportunities for new deep @-@ level underground " tube " railways there . He and Speyer headed a consortium of international investors involved in the construction of three of London 's underground railways and the electrification of a fourth . 
 With Yerkes as chairman , the Underground Electric Railways Company of London ( UERL ) was established in 1902 with a capitalisation of £ 5 million , the majority of shares sold to overseas investors . Further share issues followed , which , by 1903 , raised a total of £ 18 million ( £ 1 @.@ 74 billion today ) to be used across all of the UERL 's projects . Yerkes died in December 1905 , and Speyer took his place as chairman of the UERL . By 1907 , the three new railways had opened and the electrification works had been completed . Despite the UERL 's engineering success in carrying out the works in such a short time , the company was in a difficult financial position . The preliminary estimates of passenger numbers proved to be over optimistic and revenues were not covering operating costs . After bailing out the company , Speyer , with Managing Director Albert Stanley , struggled for a number of years to restore its finances . This was finally achieved with the purchase of the London General Omnibus Company in 1912 , as its profits could be used to offset losses elsewhere in the group . In November 1912 , Speyer further consolidated the UERL 's control of London 's underground railways when he negotiated the purchase of London 's two other main tube railways , the City and South London Railway and the Central London Railway .

 As head of the London arm of the family businesses , Speyer became wealthy . He owned a pair of neighbouring houses at 44 and 46 Grosvenor Street , Mayfair , that he had rebuilt as a single residence at the cost of £ 150 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to £ 13 @.@ 8 million in 2015 ) . The rebuilding work was carried out by Detmar Blow and Fernand <unk> in 1910 and 1911 ; the architects gave the house a " Beaux @-@ Arts " style <unk> stone façade and lavish interiors including 11 bedrooms and a large music room . Speyer also had a large country house built in 1908 , in the fashionable Edwardian resort of Overstrand on the Norfolk coast . The house was named " Sea Marge " ( meaning land that borders the sea ) and was designed in the Mock Tudor style , surrounded by gardens . To decorate his homes , Speyer collected works of art , furniture and decorative items from across Europe . He also commissioned art works , including his wife 's portrait , painted by John Singer Sargent in 1907 , and his own portrait , painted by William Orpen , which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1914 . 
 Speyer was a music lover and patron of the arts , frequently holding concerts in his home . He was friends with composers Edward Elgar , Edvard Grieg , Richard Strauss , Claude Debussy and Percy Grainger , and with the German cellist and composer Hugo Becker . Speyer owned violins by Stradivarius and Giuseppe <unk> , used by his wife in public and private performances . He was chairman of the Classical Concert Society until 1912 and ( following financial problems experienced by Robert Newman ) held the position of chairman of the Queen 's Hall Concert board from 1902 to 1914 , paying £ 2 @,@ 000 per year ( equivalent to £ 200 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) to underwrite the Promenade Concerts . Speyer increased rehearsal time for the Queen 's Hall Orchestra and was involved in the challenge to the deputy system then operating , stopping musicians from sending under @-@ prepared substitutes to perform in their places . He was described by Bird as " the sole monetary force which kept the Queen 's Hall Orchestra afloat " . Speyer 's control of the Queen 's Hall enabled him to attract musicians and composers to perform modern new works at his concerts including Strauss , whom he brought to London to conduct the first English performance of A Hero 's Life , and Arnold Schoenberg , whose Five Orchestral Pieces received its première in 1912 . Becker dedicated Three Pieces for Cello with Piano Accompaniment to Speyer in recognition of their friendship , and Strauss dedicated his opera Salome to him . 
 Speyer also contributed £ 2 @,@ 500 to the foundation of Whitechapel Art Gallery where he was a trustee for 15 years . He was chairman of the Nervous Diseases Research Fund , president of Poplar Hospital , and sat on the board of the King Edward 's Hospital Fund , to which he donated £ 25 @,@ 000 in 1902 ( equivalent to £ 2 @.@ 45 million in 2015 ) . In December 1904 , having read of the loss in a newspaper article , Speyer donated £ 5 @,@ 700 to replace all of the funds lost by investors in the failure of a penny savings bank at Needham Market , Suffolk . From 1909 , Speyer was honorary treasurer of the fund raised to finance Robert Falcon Scott 's 1910 British Antarctic Expedition to which he donated £ 1 @,@ 000 of the £ 40 @,@ 000 that was required . Speyer was prepared to take personal responsibility for a share of the liabilities of the expedition , although the money raised from public donations was sufficient . Mount Speyer ( 78 ° 52 ′ 00 ″ S , 160 ° 42 ′ 00 ″ E ) in Antarctica is named in his honour . One of Scott 's last letters was written to Speyer . It was found when Scott 's body was recovered from his last camp after his unsuccessful return from the South Pole . 
 On 14 July 1906 , Speyer was created a baronet . Politically , Speyer was a Liberal . He was a member of the Reform Club , and a friend of H. H. Asquith , by whose recommendation he was made a Privy Counsellor ( PC ) in 1909 . In 1911 , he was awarded the Order of the Crown , 2nd class by Kaiser Wilhelm II .

 = = = Anti @-@ German pressure = = = 
 The end of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century saw rising anti @-@ German sentiment in Britain . As the naval arms race between Britain and Germany escalated , distrust of Germans and those of German origin was stirred @-@ up by press warnings of the rising military threat from Germany . This was developed further in popular magazines such as the National Review and in novels such as Erskine Childers ' The Riddle of the Sands and invasion novels such as William Le <unk> 's The Invasion of 1910 . 
 Following the British declaration of war with Germany on 4 August 1914 , Speyer resigned as a partner of the Frankfurt branch of the bank . After a Royal Proclamation on 11 September 1914 requiring British subjects to have no links with companies doing business with Germany , Speyer resigned as a partner of the American bank . Nonetheless , suspicions regarding Speyer 's German parentage led to a hate campaign against him . Crowds gathered outside his home and jeered visitors . Accusations of his disloyalty and treachery appeared in the Press , and he was accused of signalling to German submarines from his Norfolk house . Lady Speyer was ostracised from societies and associations of which she had formerly been a member . Speyer was asked to resign from the board of the Poplar Hospital due to threats of substantial reductions in donations if he remained . The couple was asked to remove their children from school as other parents were threatening to remove theirs . 
 Speyer ignored a call to write one of the " loyalty letters " that Sir Arthur Pinero proposed be provided by prominent naturalised citizens of German origin . Instead , on 17 May 1915 , Speyer wrote to Asquith , then Prime Minister , asking him to accept his resignation as a Privy Counsellor and to revoke his baronetcy , stating : 
 Nothing is harder to bear than a sense of injustice that finds no vent in expression . 
 For the last nine months I have kept silence and treated with disdain the charges of disloyalty and suggestions of treachery made against me in the Press and elsewhere . But I can keep silence no longer , for these charges and suggestion have now been repeated by public men who have not <unk> to use their position to inflame the <unk> feelings of the people . 
 I am not a man who can be driven or drummed by threats or abuse into an attitude of justification . But I consider it due to my honour as a loyal British subject and my personal dignity as a man to retire all my public positions . 
 I therefore write to ask you to accept my resignation as a Privy Councillor and to revoke my baronetcy . 
 He resigned as chairman of the UERL and from the boards of the King Edward 's Hospital Fund , the Poplar Hospital and the Whitechapel Art Gallery . 
 It is doubtful whether it was possible for Speyer to resign from the Privy Council or as a baronet , there being no normal mechanism to do so , but the Prime Minister 's response was supportive : " I have known you long , and well enough to estimate at their true value these baseless and malignant imputations upon your loyalty to the British Crown . The King is not prepared to take any step such as you suggest in regard to the marks of distinction which you have received in recognition of public services and philanthropic munificence . " On 26 May 1915 , Speyer and his family left for America . 
 In June 1915 , Sir George Makgill , Secretary of the Anti @-@ German Union , applied for permission from the High Court to issue quo warranto writs against Speyer and Sir Ernest Cassel , a German @-@ born Privy Counsellor , requiring them to prove their right to hold that position . Makgill 's claim was that the Act of Settlement 1701 prevented a person born outside Britain or its dominions from being a Privy Counsellor . In December 1915 , Lord Chief Justice Lord Reading rejected the application on the grounds that the relevant sections of the Act of Settlement had been repealed by later legislation . 
 = = = Revocation of naturalisation = = = 
 On 2 August 1918 , in a House of Lords debate on the <unk> Bill , the subject of Speyer 's membership of the Privy Council was brought up by Lord Lincolnshire , who condemned " the brutal and insolent German manner in which Sir Edgar Speyer had resigned his dignity . " Lord Curzon announced that the Home Office was examining his membership of the council . Speyer again offered the Prime Minister , then David Lloyd George , his resignation from the council , but received no response . 
 Following an investigation into Speyer 's wartime conduct held in camera by the Home Office 's Certificates of <unk> ( Revocation ) Committee , Speyer 's naturalisation was revoked by an order dated 1 December 1921 . On 13 December 1921 an order was issued by King George V for Speyer to be struck off the list of the Privy Council . The next person to be struck off the list was Elliot Morley in 2011 , though others resigned in the intervening period . 
 The committee decided that Speyer had " shown himself by act and speech to be disaffected and disloyal to His Majesty ; and [ had ] ... unlawfully communicated with subjects of an enemy State and associated with a business which was to his knowledge carried on in such manner as to assist the enemy in such war . " The committee 's final opinion was " that the continuance of Sir Edgar Speyer 's certificate is not conducive to the public good . " Lady Speyer and the couple 's children also lost their British nationality . 
 The report of the committee was published on 7 January 1922 . The committee had considered nine issues in making its decision : 
 Retirement from Speyer & Co . – it was decided that Speyer had been slow and reluctant to resign as a partner of the American bank of which he was still in partnership with his German brother @-@ in @-@ law , Edward Beit von Speyer . 
 Association with enemy traffic – Speyer Brothers had continued to trade jointly with a Dutch firm , Teixeira de Mattos Brothers , between February and June 1915 . As they were based in a neutral country , Teixeira had continued to trade with German businesses . The committee calculated that Speyer Brothers had made £ 1 @,@ 000 by these trades , despite an inspection of the company 's accounts showing no trade with Germany . It concluded that " Sir Edgar Speyer seems to have preferred his private financial interests to the prompt discharge of his duty to the State . " 
 Communication with enemy subjects – Speyer had continued to correspond with his German brother @-@ in @-@ law throughout the war . 
 Evasion of the censorship – in his correspondence with his brother @-@ in @-@ law , Speyer had used various means including aliases and intermediaries to avoid the censor inspecting his letters . 
 Proposed return to Berlin – the contents of intercepted letters from Edward Beit von Speyer suggested that Speyer had proposed living in Germany after the war . Speyer denied this and stated that the meaning of the letters had been misconstrued in the absence of his side of the correspondence being before the committee . 
 Association with Muck – while living in America Speyer had become friendly with Karl Muck , the German conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra , who remained strongly pro @-@ German even after the United States entered the war . Unknown to Speyer , who stated that their friendship was based on a shared love of music , Muck was suspected of being a German agent . 
 Association with Koren – in America , Speyer was friendly with John Koren , an American statistician who represented the United States on the International Prisons Commission . In 1916 , Speyer had funded a fact @-@ finding trip by Koren to Europe , during which Koren visited Germany and met Speyer 's sister and friends . Although the committee considered the trip strange , they drew no inference of disloyalty from the events . 
 The Boston Journal – in April 1917 , on the advice of John Koren , Speyer had provided a loan to The Boston Journal newspaper to prevent it from going out of business . The newspaper had printed some articles of a pro @-@ German nature and the committee thought it imprudent but not disloyal of Speyer to have lent the money . 
 Paying money to enemy subjects – some of Speyer 's friends had made claims at the Frankfurt bank for payment of sums due to them that were in the hands of Speyer in London . Speyer had authorised the payments , although this was not allowed by the wartime regulations . The committee commented that in similar circumstances it had shown leniency to others doing the same thing , and would not have attached great importance to the matter if it had stood alone . 
 On 7 January 1922 , Speyer 's partners published a letter supporting Speyer and rejecting the implications of his correspondence with his German relatives , stating that he was " incapable of any act of treachery against the country of his adoption " . Two days later , Speyer also issued a statement responding to the report and rebutting the committee 's interpretation of the facts . He stated that he had been advised of the committee 's investigation in 1919 and , after considerable delay by the Home Office , had persuaded it to carry out an investigation in America into allegations made against his conduct there . These investigations , he stated , had demonstrated that the allegations were false , but , after he returned to Britain for the formal hearing in 1921 , a further series of allegations were presented regarding his business transactions . Speyer stated that the issues involved were of a trivial nature and were similar to those encountered by other British banks which had traded without censure . He stated that " the whole thing is neither more nor less than the culmination of years of political persecution . The Home Secretary simply dared not give me the vindication to which I was entitled . " He challenged the government to publish the evidence presented , and " to point to a strip of material evidence that would induce any <unk> man to support the monstrous conclusions of this report " . 
 = = = Final years = = = 
 In January 1920 , Speyer Brothers sold its shareholding in the UERL for approximately £ 1 million ( 36 @.@ 2 million today ) . A month later , Speyer put the Grosvenor Street house up for sale although it did not reach its reserve price at auction . On 1 April 1922 , Speyer and his remaining partner in the London bank , Henry William Brown , dissolved Speyer Brothers . The Grosvenor Street house was eventually sold in early 1923 and became the American Women 's club . Speyer rejoined the surviving American and German branches of the family bank and continued to live in New York . In 1929 , he lived in Washington Square . He died on 16 February 1932 in Berlin , after having travelled there for an operation on his nose . He was buried in Dahlem , Berlin . He had continued to hold his baronetcy , although it became extinct with his death as he had no male heirs . 
 After his death , Speyer 's UK estate was assessed at £ 3 @,@ 362 19s 1d and his US estate at $ 245 @,@ 287 , equivalent to a net worth of approximately £ 210 @,@ 500 and $ 4 @.@ 34 million today . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Speyer 's two principal legacies are the three deep @-@ level tube lines of the London Underground , and the Promenade Concerts . The former might not have been built without the finance he raised with Yerkes , and would have struggled without his chairmanship . The latter may have failed in the early 20th century without his financial support . The tube lines now form the central sections of the Underground 's Northern , Piccadilly and Bakerloo lines . After Speyer 's funding of the Promenade Concerts ended , they were taken over by music publishers Chappell & Co. and , in 1927 , by the BBC . The characters of Sir Hermann and Lady Aline <unk> in E. F. Benson 's 1919 novel Robin Linnet were based on Sir Edgar and Lady Leonora . Leanne Langley suggests that the character of Appleton , a villainous stockbroker , in John Buchan 's The Thirty @-@ Nine Steps may have been based on Speyer . 
 After the American Women 's club moved out , his London home served as the Japanese Embassy for some years and is now the offices of stockbrokers <unk> & Co . It is a Grade II * listed building . The Sea Marge was sold after his death and became a hotel and , for many years , a well @-@ considered home for the elderly . It is currently operated as a hotel and is listed Grade II . After the <unk> returned to America , Lady Leonora began writing poetry and won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1927 . She died in 1956 . 
 The <unk> ' three daughters returned to Britain . Pamela Speyer married Count Hugo Moy in 1926 , but was widowed shortly after when he was killed in a hunting accident . She died in Sussex in 1985 . Leonora was married for less than a year and then lived with concert pianist Maria <unk> and died in Kent in 1987 . Vivien came to Britain as a member of the United States Women 's Army Auxiliary Corps and died in Norwalk , Connecticut , in 2001 . 
 = Typhoon Higos ( 2002 ) = 
 Typhoon Higos was considered the third strongest typhoon to affect Tokyo since World War II . The 21st named storm of the 2002 Pacific typhoon season , Higos developed on September 25 east of the Northern Marianas Islands . It tracked west @-@ northwestward for its first few days , steadily intensifying into a powerful typhoon by September 29 . Higos subsequently weakened and turned to the north @-@ northeast toward Japan , making landfall in that country 's Kanagawa Prefecture on October 1 . It weakened while crossing Honshu , and shortly after striking Hokkaidō , Higos became extratropical on October 2 . The remnants passed over Sakhalin and dissipated on October 4 . 
 Before striking Japan , Higos produced strong winds in the Northern Marianas Islands while passing to their north . These winds damaged the food supply on two islands . Later , Higos moved across Japan with wind gusts as strong as 161 km / h ( 100 mph ) , including record gusts at several locations . A total of 608 @,@ 130 buildings in the country were left without power , and two people were electrocuted in the storm 's aftermath . The typhoon also dropped heavy rainfall that peaked at 346 mm ( 13 @.@ 6 in ) . The rains flooded houses across the country and caused mudslides . High waves washed 25 boats ashore and killed one person along the coast . Damage in the country totaled $ 2 @.@ 14 billion ( ¥ 261 billion 2002 JPY ) , and there were five deaths in the country . Later , the remnants of Higos affected the Russian Far East , killing seven people involved in two shipwrecks offshore Primorsky Krai . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) first monitored an area of disturbed weather on September 25 . At the time , the system consisted of a weak circulation , but with good outflow and located in an area of low wind shear . The system moved to the west @-@ northwest , steered by a subtropical ridge to the east of Japan . On September 26 , a tropical depression developed about 925 km ( 575 mi ) east of the Northern Marianas Islands , and also to the south of the Japanese island of Minamitorishima . Later that day , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Higos , at the same time that the JTWC also upgraded to a tropical storm . By that time , the system had developed an organized area of convection . 
 The storm gradually intensified while passing to the north of Saipan , and Higos attained typhoon status on September 27 . Shortly thereafter , it also passed just south of Pagan Island . A well @-@ defined eye ( cyclone ) 15 km ( 9 mi ) in diameter developed , and Higos rapidly intensified . At 1200 UTC on September 29 , Typhoon Higos reached its peak intensity . The JMA estimated 10 minute maximum sustained winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) , and the JTWC estimated 1 minute winds of 250 km / h ( 155 mph ) , which made Higos a super typhoon . After having moved west @-@ northwestward for several days , Higos slowed and began turning to the north while it was at peak strength . Its change in movement was due to an eastward @-@ moving trough creating a weakness in the ridge . The typhoon accelerated to the north @-@ northeast toward Japan and gradually weakened due to increasing wind shear . 
 At around 1100 UTC on October 1 , Higos passed just east of the Miura Peninsula with winds of 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) , about 30 minutes before making landfall in the eastern portion of Kanagawa Prefecture near Yokosuka . Higos passed very near Tokyo around 1200 UTC that day , becoming the third strongest typhoon to affect the city since World War II , according to the JTWC . The typhoon weakened into a tropical storm while crossing Honshu . Higos briefly emerged over waters , before making a second landfall on <unk> , Hokkaidō at 2100 UTC on October 1 . By that time , the storm was beginning to transition into an extratropical cyclone , and at 0600 UTC on October 2 Higos completed the transition . Simultaneously , the JTWC discontinued advisories . The storm continued to the north before crossing Sakhalin . The remnants dissipated on October 4 just west of the Kamchatka Peninsula . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Typhoon Higos first affected the Northern Marianas Islands , producing winds of 94 km / h ( 59 mph ) , with gusts to 183 km / h ( 114 mph ) on Pagan Island . The typhoon caused heavy crop damage in <unk> and Alamagan , which led to food shortages on the islands . As a result , officials from Saipan sent a boat to the islands with food donated by the local Red Cross chapter . 
 Before Higos struck Japan , officials canceled 300 airplane flights , and also canceled train lines and ferry service . Some baseball games were postponed , and businesses closed early . The typhoon affected outlying islands of Japan , causing power outages due to strong winds . Upon making landfall in Japan , Higos produced strong winds that peaked at 104 km / h ( 65 mph ) in Shizuoka . Winds in Tokyo reached 94 km / h ( 58 mph ) . Stronger wind gusts were reported in Hokkaido after Higos became extratropical , including a peak gust of 161 km / h ( 100 mph ) in Urakawa . Several stations across Japan reported record @-@ high wind gusts . The typhoon also dropped torrential rainfall that peaked at 346 mm ( 13 @.@ 6 in ) in Hakone , Kanagawa ; the same station reported a one @-@ hour total of 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 15 in ) . The typhoon washed 25 boats ashore , including a cargo ship on Izu @-@ Oshima Island . One woman was washed away by high surf . 
 A total of 2 @,@ 254 houses were flooded in the country , forcing thousands of people to evacuate . Overall , 2 @,@ 694 houses were damaged , and another 12 were destroyed . Many houses lost their roofs , and high winds left 608 @,@ 130 buildings without power in Honshu , along with thousands of power on Hokkaido . Two people were electrocuted by downed power lines . High rainfall caused mudslides near Tokyo , which destroyed a few buildings , and caused the Tama River to reach above @-@ normal levels . Across Japan , the typhoon disrupted transportation by forcing highways to be closed . Storm debris injured several people , and a steel window frame struck and killed a man in Yokohama . A tree fell onto a car , injuring one person . Insured damage in Japan totaled $ 2 @.@ 14 billion ( ¥ 261 billion 2002 JPY ) . In Iwate Prefecture , there was about $ 73 million ( ¥ 8 billion 2002 JPY ) in damage , mostly from damaged roads and public buildings . Agriculture damage in the prefecture $ 18 @.@ 3 million ( ¥ 2 billion 2002 JPY ) for the first time since Typhoon Mireille in 1991 . There were five deaths , and 108 people were injured ; this included 55 people who were injured in Tokyo . 
 After becoming extratropical , Higos affected the Kuril Islands and later Sakhalin . Power was cut in 22 towns , and ferry service was canceled . On Sakhalin , high winds downed many trees , some of which blocked roads . Six people were injured by fallen trees . The remnants of Higos capsized two ships offshore <unk> , killing seven people . 
 = Gorilla ( Bruno Mars song ) = 
 " Gorilla " is a song recorded by American recording artist Bruno Mars for his 2012 studio album Unorthodox Jukebox . The song was written by Mars , Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine , while production was handled by the former along with Emile Haynie , Jeff Bhasker and Mark Ronson , who had all previously co @-@ produced the single " Locked Out of Heaven " for the same album . Atlantic Records serviced the track to Contemporary hit radio in the United States on September 10 , 2012 , as the fourth single from Unorthodox Jukebox . The official remix ( G @-@ Mix ) of the song features American singers Pharrell Williams and R. Kelly , and was released in Canada and US on November 12 . " Gorilla " is a midtempo rock and soft rock song with a power pop hook , epic guitars and a synth / percussion combination resembling a Phil Collins @-@ esque . Its style has drawn comparisons towards Prince 's 1984 single " Purple Rain " . 
 The single received mixed to positive reviews from critics , who praised its early 1980s arena rock tendencies , but was criticized for its explicit lyrical content , which addresses the subject of making love like wild animals . The song charted moderately worldwide ; it reached number 22 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number 62 on the UK Singles Chart , being unable to achieve the same success of the previous singles . It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , denoting digital downloads of over half a million copies in the US . Mars only performed " Gorilla " live at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards , however the song was included on the set list of the 2013 Moonshine Jungle Tour as the final act , usually performed as an encore .

 " Gorilla " was the first song written for the album , setting " the tone for the entire project and it kind of became the mascot " . This was the reason behind the gorilla on the cover of the album , as Mars explained in an interview with MTV News . In another interview , this time for GQ magazine , Mars revealed the song 's conception , saying that " it was just painting a picture — some animalistic sex " . When asked about what the meaning is for " making love like a gorilla " ? , Mars replied aggressively " What does that sound like to you ? Come on ... What is this , 1933 ? We can 't talk about this ? " . Regarding the line " I got a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker " , Mars said that his inspiration came " just because the room was dark " and he felt like Johnny Cash . 
 On the same interview , he was asked if his perfect idea of encounter was the same as described in the track , one in which your partner is screaming to you , " Give it to me , baby , give it to me , motherfucker " and having attracted the attention of the cops due to the violent noises you are making with your partner outside while " trying to get in " . To this question Mars said " It definitely sounds awesome . Right ? Isn 't that what matters ? It 's an awesome song ! I don 't know how to tell you that more " . In another interview , this time for Rolling Stone , he explained that the track is about " good old animalistic sex " . When the interviewer asked if Mars was concerned with the verses " Got a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker " due to his 2010 drug bust , he replied " To take that line out would dilute my art " , since the recording " needs a sense of danger . When I was a kid , pop could be dangerous but still massive . Michael Jackson would grab his crotch . Prince would rock <unk> chaps " . 
 A demo of the song , only featuring the vocals and an acoustic guitar , was exclusively released as bonus track on the Target edition of the album , on December 11 , 2012 . Almost a year later , on November 5 , 2013 , the demo of the song was also included on the deluxe edition of the album , released worldwide .

 = = Composition and lyrical interpretation = = 
 " Gorilla " has a length of four minutes and five seconds . The Observer magazine 's Kitty Empire characterized it as a soft rock , while Gail Mitchell , from Billboard 's magazine , called it a rock song . The track opens with a stark , insinuating beat and Mars ' bleating vocals . As it progresses , monstrous drums burst . A guitar , a piano , keyboards and a backbeat are also part of the instrumentation . The song features jungle noises in the background along with a pop hook . According to the digital sheet music published by Alfred Music Publishing , the song was composed in common time and in the key of B minor with a tempo of 70 beats per minute . Mars ' vocals range spans from the low note of Bb3 to the high note of A5 . 
 Billboard 's magazine reviewer , Jason Lipshutz , called the track " an ambitious arena @-@ rock sex jam " . It is often noted that " Gorilla " is a song rich of instruments that create a 1980s sound similar to Prince 's , with the drums and keyboards overwhelming the instrumental backbeat . About.com 's Bill Lamb and Slant Magazine 's Chan noticed the multiple high @-@ range falsettos performed by Mars during the whole song . Matt <unk> for Rolling Stone said that the recording features a " thundering , Def Leppard @-@ huge thump and risqué subject matter " . 
 The song has gained attention due to its explicit lyrics . The song begins with the lyrics " I got a body full of liquor and a cocaine kicker " , during the song " a slew of f @-@ bombs " can be heard , and varied graphic descriptions such as : " You got your legs up in the sky with the devil in your eyes / Let me hear you say you want it all " and the chorus " You and me , baby , making love like gorillas ! " . Overall , the lyrics portray the subject of having a " romantic evening " of making love like wild animals ( gorillas ) , despite being high from cocaine and drunk from liquor . On September 11 , 2013 , The Daily Telegraph reported that <unk> Miller , co @-@ founder of Enlighten Education , decided to appeal to mainstream radio in order to ban " Gorilla " , due to its sexual and violent lyrics towards women .

 " Gorilla " received mixed reviews by most music critics . Some of them praised its musical structure , while others complained for its lack for lyrical depth . In a review of Unorthodox Jukebox , Slant Magazine 's Andrew Chan wrote that it is the album 's highlight being the most energetic track on the album and found it " most infectious bedroom anthem of the year . Likewise , Lauren Kreisler from the Official Charts Company , described the song as an apparent bedroom antics . About.com critic Bill Lamb rated the song 3 out of 5 stars , praising the musicality , since the singer recaptures " the musical spirit of Prince 's arena sized ballad " Purple Rain " and " the pounding keyboards and crunchy guitar will invite a live audience to sway along in time to the music " . On the other hand , the " erotic connection " is misguided because " the words about alcohol and cocaine fueled rough sex , it is difficult to see the song as truly erotic " , making the lyrics " tasteless " and lacking concept . Official Charts Company 's Lauren Kreisler found that the lyrics ' concept simply " baffled " anyone , while ultimately described the song as " intriguing ( and anthemic ) enough to make us listen again , and again , and again , to work it out . " 
 Writing for The Washington Post , Allison Stewart opined that the track describes an eccentric night of romance , beginning with " a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker " and ending with " you and me / Making love like gorillas " . She concluded , " for all its awfulness " the song is the " image shifter Mars needs " . Idolator 's Emily Tan commented " the libidinous lyrics are disguised with epic guitars and Phil Collins @-@ esque heavy drum combinations ... strong enough to soundtrack a scene in a drama series " . Jason Lipshutz of Billboard magazine similarly felt that the " drums and keyboards are nicely overwhelming , but the overall concept floats too far away to make a dent on the listener " . Day Hyman of Spin thought that the lyrics on the album " desperately needed kick in the pants " mainly noticed on " Gorilla " . He also drew comparisons on the " Prince @-@ channeling " vibe . On the critical side , Amy Dawson of Metro described it as a " Phil Collins @-@ esque low point " in the album , " in which the button @-@ eyed singer makes plans to go at it in the same way as said giant ape , all over a Phil Collins @-@ esque synth / percussion combo backing … but by the time the jungle noises kick in , you think he surely must be in on the joke . " 
 Kory Grow of Rolling Stone 's magazine reviewed the remix of the song , in the song " Pharrell opens the track with a salacious rap " , setting " the thematic pace for track " , in the end of his verse the original " steamy " verses of Mars begin . He further added that R. Kelly 's appearance makes the song a " sort of sex jam " and only him has " the hubris and swagger to shout " : " I 'm like an anaconda in your garden / Baby girl , I 'm <unk> ' " in the song . Reviewing for Billboard 's column , Kevin Rutherford described the track as " raunchy " and if the original version was " dirty enough " , then " Mars and company have a treat in store for you " . Los Angeles Times 's Mikael Wood shared a similar opinion as the other reviewers , calling it a " little <unk> " than the original version thanks to Williams and Kelly . For Idolator , Mike Wass called the remix " X @-@ rated " , thanking the feature guests for that .

 The first and only time Mars performed the song , aside from the tour , was on 2013 MTV Video Music Awards , where Mars recreated his provocative music video with Nicole “ The Pole ” Williams . In his performance there was a green color scheme with a neon sign pulsating in the background with the same color . The singer was standing high up on a platform , using aviator sunglasses . Whilst there was a screen with a giant gorilla face behind him and lasers firing through the stage . He kicked his mic stand over and over , while his band was jamming along . Meanwhile , some pyrotechnics " shooting off at the climax " and " blasts of fire erupted during the chorus " . His face face was " superimposed " over Nicole Williams dancing around a stripper pole with " acrobatic ease " and " breathtaking moves in time to the song " , during the performance . The song was the final act on both set lists of his second worldwide tour , The Moonshine Jungle Tour ( 2013 @-@ 2015 ) . 
 Billboard 's Brad Wete said : " There ’ s something to be said about simplicity when whatever ’ s simply being done is awesome . Bruno Mars never moved more than three steps in any direction during his performance . His voice soared and his passion was palpable as he performed " . He concluded , " when his time came , Mars left his mark " . Mathew Jacobs of The Huffington Post believes that " the jazzy new song marked one of the night 's tamer moments " . He praised Mars performance by saying he " offered a brand of artistry unmatched by the bulk of the telecast . " Grading the performances of the show , the staff from Entertainment Weekly gave Mars ' performance an A- , describing it as " The most elegantly designed and executed performance of the evening " . MTV News ' Brenna Ehrlich classified the performance as a " show that rivaled anything you 'd find in the city 's famous — and infamous — Red Light District " . The UK edition of The Huffington Post commented that despite Mars ' voice being on top form , it was the pole @-@ dancer performance who stole the show . Other performers , such as Ed Sheeran and Adam Lambert praised the interpretation by calling it an amazing performance and noticing Mars ' vocals , respectively . Hilary Duff called " Gorilla " a " straight baby making music " . Writing for Billboard magazine , Jason Lipshutz , while reviewing the tour felt that Gorilla was " an odd selection for a set closer " . He further added , that Mars " lost his mind while perched upon an elevated platform with pyrotechnics blasting off behind him " .

 Mars had been filming the music video for " Gorilla " as he announced on his Twitter account , on October 2 , 2013 . He said " Sorry i 've been M.I.A , I was shooting a music video . # <unk> # <unk> # <unk> Wait till you see this " . It was directed by Mars ' himself and regular collaborator Cameron Duddy . On October 10 , 2013 it was announced on Bruno Mars ' official website , leading up to the release of the video , the unveil of teasers every day via Mars ' Instagram account . The teasers included a car parked in front of a strip club , a reptile , and an angry boss played by Luis Guzmán . Duddy along with Mars sought to create " more than a standard strip @-@ club video " by researching and going into strip clubs to appreciate the architecture of the local . Nevertheless , the search for the ideal strip club was fruitless , so Mars and Duddy decided to build one : " a joint that seemed like it was lifted straight out of Havana , dark and sweaty and seemingly untouched by time . They painted the walls themselves , and went back and forth on just what color neon they should use " . When the time came to cast someone to play a stripper , the only name was Freida Pinto 's one . However , Duddy had some doubts her choice , since he considered her " safe " . To this , Mars replied " it 's important to use someone who hasn 't been seen in this light before " . All in all , Duddy confessed that he trusted Mars instincts regarding Pinto 's choice for the role . Duddy explained that some scenes recorded for the video were dangerous . Pinto could have harmed herself in the scene where " she sheds her clothes among a sea of sparks " , as well as Mars ' guitar player " He got dangerously close to having his head burned " . Muriel <unk> starts as one of the jealous strippers . The official music video was set to premiere on October 14 , 2015 . Nevertheless , its release was delayed one day by Mars himself stating " I want it to be the best it can be . With that being said , I need one more day " . The video , finally arrived on October 15 , 2015 exclusively via Facebook . 
 = = = Synopsis = = = 
 The music video opens with a pair of jealous strippers applying lipstick and <unk> back @-@ and @-@ forth between backstage , in a South of the Border strip zoo named " La <unk> " . Meanwhile , Mars ' " Money Make Her Smile " can be heard from the room , the two of them are talking about a new girl who has been " fooling around " with someone else 's man ( Mr. Mars ) . The scene ends with one of the two women saying , " Wait ' til I tell the boss what she 's sleeping with " . It is shown that the new girl , Isabella , has been listening to the conversation and it 's her time to dance as soon as the boss says so . The role of Isabella is portrayed by Indian actress Freida Pinto , who after an introduction by Guzmán , the zoo owner , starts to pull off " gravity @-@ defying spins on the pole " as Mars and his mates , who serve as the house band , perform the song . On the following scene , Isabella sheds her clothes with such rage that sparks fall from the ceiling while Mars stares at her intensely singing " You and me baby making love like gorillas " . As the second verse starts , intermittent shots of Mars and Isabella " heating up the backseat of a car " along with shots of her " grinding on customers " and banging on Mars ' chest as he sings the line " Bang Bang , Gorilla " . The former shots are shown throughout the video . As the video continues , Isabella is shown " to drop on her knees and lick " Mars ' guitar . She grabs it and pours tequila over the same , before using a lighter to set it on fire . Afterwards , the roof sprinklers come on and Isabella lets the water shower her while she stands on her underwear . The video ends in a chase scene in which Mars runs down trough a dimly lit aisle , and suddenly transforms into a giant gorilla , while Isabella is seen at the end of the pathway waiting for him . The video doesn 't contain any of the teasers Mars released days before the video , including the iguana shot , the outer car scene and the one with Luis Guzman listening to the intro for Isabella .

 Upon its release , the video received positive response from critics . James Montgomery of MTV News said that the video " is undoubtedly indebted to the past few decades of pop @-@ cultural history ... yet , once again , he 's managed to create something entirely new , too " . He added that , " thanks to Pinto 's wattage , " Gorilla " goes to heights — and depths — Mars has never visited before " . Billboard 's Jason Lipshutz found Mars supporting " a more R @-@ rated side " in the video , calling the cameos by Freida Pinto and Luis Guzman unforgettable . Carl Williot of the website 's Idolator thought that the new video maintained the " sweaty nightclub vibe " style from the previous video " Locked Out of Heaven " . Additionally , she felt there is a story centered on Isabella , the new dancer , and Mars , which obviously upset " the club ’ s veteran strippers " . The Times of India newspaper considered the video one of the most controversial of 2013 because of " Freida Pinto strip act " . Ray Rahman of Entertainment Weekly opined that " Bruno Mars is getting real " since the video was set on a strip club and featured Freida Pinto striping , licking guitars and getting intimate with Mars . Lauren Kreisler of Official Charts Company praised the video concept and concluded that it was " racy as you might have expected " . The video for " Gorilla " broke the 1 million views mark in just over an hour in 2013 on the exclusive Facebook program premiere , " # <unk> " .

 = Wimbledon and Sutton Railway = 
 The Wimbledon and Sutton Railway ( W & SR ) was a railway company established by an Act of Parliament in 1910 to build a railway line in Surrey ( now south @-@ west London ) from Wimbledon to Sutton via Merton and Morden in the United Kingdom . The railway was promoted by local landowners hoping to increase the value of their land through its development for housing . It was initially planned that services on the railway would be operated by the London Underground 's District Railway ( DR ) by an extension of its existing service from Wimbledon . 
 Delays in finding the funding , opposition from the two mainline companies that the line was intended to connect , and World War I , led to the start of construction work being delayed until 1927 . The line was completed and opened in January 1930 , although the planned extension of the DR was not implemented and the service was provided by the Southern Railway . The opening of the line stimulated residential development as planned , but competition from the London Underground 's City and South London Railway , which had its terminus at Morden , meant that the line did not achieve the hoped for passenger numbers . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 During the second half of the 19th century , the Surrey villages of Wimbledon and Sutton experienced rapid residential growth stimulated by the railways running through their areas , with landowners in both areas profiting from the development of new suburban housing on their previously rural estates . Less accessible to the railways , the parishes of Merton and Morden which lay between Wimbledon and Sutton remained largely rural , and , starting in the 1880s , a series of railway schemes were proposed to bring a new line through the area and increase the value of the land . 
 Unsuccessful private bills were presented to Parliament in 1884 , 1888 , 1890 and 1891 seeking permission to construct a new railway between the London and South Western Railway 's ( L & SWR 's ) line through Wimbledon station to the north and the London , Brighton and South Coast Railway 's ( LB & SCR 's ) Sutton station in the south . 
 = = = Establishment = = = 
 On 7 October 1908 , engineer H. D. Searles @-@ Wood and Sir George Smallman organised a meeting to consider a new plan for a Wimbledon to Sutton railway , and a committee was formed to promote the plan . A further meeting , held in 1909 , included landowner William Innes , nephew of John Innes , the developer of Merton Park . It was estimated that £ 350 @,@ 000 ( approximately £ 32 @.@ 2 million today ) of capital was required , only part of which was to be provided by the promoters . Some of the remainder was sought from the DR ( now the London Underground 's District line ) which the promoters hoped would operate the service over the line by extending its service from Wimbledon . On 16 November 1909 , notice of the intention to bring a private bill before Parliament was published . 
 The bill proposed a 5 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 8 @.@ 9 km ) line with ten stations to be operated by electric trains which would provide a service taking 32 minutes to reach Waterloo from Sutton . The LB & SCR opposed the line on the grounds that it would compete with its own services from Sutton to central London , and claimed that its own planned electrification of its lines to Victoria and London Bridge would offer quicker journeys than the W & SR <unk> LB & SCR also believed that a connection for the W & SR would give the DR service the chance to extend its service to Epsom and beyond . The L & SWR had concerns that its tracks from Putney to Wimbledon , over which the DR provided the service , were already at capacity and could not cope with the extended DR service to Sutton . 
 Nonetheless , the Wimbledon and Sutton Railway Act , 1910 received Royal Assent on 26 July 1910 . The act approved the railway and allowed for the L & SWR connection at Wimbledon but did not allow for a connection to the LB & SCR at Sutton ; instead the W & SR was to build a separate station with a pedestrian connection to the LB & SCR 's station . Intermediate stations were approved for Elm Grove in Wimbledon , adjacent to the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club 's original grounds , Cannon Hill , Merton Park , Morden , Elm Farm , Sutton Common , Collingwood Road and Cheam . Power for the line was to be supplied by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London ( UERL ) , owner of the DR , from its Lots Road Power Station . 
 = = = Delays = = = 
 From the beginning , the company encountered delays in implementing its plans . Neither of the two main line railway companies were interested in investing in the line , so the W & SR 's promoters approached the DR for assistance . In 1911 , Albert Stanley , managing director of the DR , agreed that it would finance the construction if the promoters would guarantee a return of £ 6 @,@ 000 per year for ten years . The DR was to cover any shortfall below 4 @.@ 5 per cent return on capital . To provide additional capacity for Sutton trains on the DR 's Wimbledon branch , the DR published a bill on 21 November 1911 seeking permission to construct additional tracks on the L & SWR owned section from Wimbledon to East Putney . The works were approved by the Metropolitan District Railway Act , 1912 , which received assent on 7 August 1912 . The L & SWR was to build the additional tracks with the DR covering the cost . 
 On 22 November 1912 , both the W & SR and the DR published notices that further bills would be submitted to extend the time limit imposed by the 1910 Act for the compulsory purchase of the land needed for the railway , to enable the W & SR to raise additional capital , and to give the DR powers to take over the W & SR . The DR bill contained provisions to increase the capacity on the DR owned section of the Wimbledon branch by constructing further additional tracks from south of Parsons Green to south of Walham Green station ( now Fulham Broadway ) . The requested extension of time and other powers were granted by the Wimbledon and Sutton Railway Act , 1913 , given Royal Assent on 15 August 1913 . In December 1912 , the original promoters were replaced on the W & SR board by UERL nominees and the shares in the company were transferred to the UERL or its shareholders . In late 1913 , changes were made to the track layout at Wimbledon station , including a new platform for use by the W & SR line trains , and land for the junctions with the L & SWR mainline was purchased . 
 On 16 November 1914 , after the outbreak of war , the DR gave notice of another bill which sought a further extension of time for land purchases . The DR was also to stand guarantor for the W & SR and to lease the W & SR 's undertakings , in effect taking over the W & SR . This was granted under the Metropolitan District Railway Act , 1915 on 24 June 1915 . War @-@ time restrictions prevented any construction and so extensions to the earlier acts were granted each year from 1918 to 1922 to give a final date of 26 July 1924 for completion of the compulsory purchase . 
 = = = Revised plans = = = 
 In November 1922 , notices of new bills to be placed before Parliament were published by the W & SR , and by the UERL 's subsidiaries the London Electric Railway ( LER ) and the City and South London Railway ( C & SLR , now part of the London Underground 's Northern line ) . Taken together , the bills brought significant changes to the plans for the Wimbledon to Sutton line . 
 The C & SLR was an underground railway running in deep tunnels . In 1922 its line ran from Euston to Clapham Common . The C & SLR proposed to extend it for " 6 miles , 1 furlong and 7 @.@ 2 chains " ( 6 @.@ 215 miles or 10 @.@ 002 kilometres ) from Clapham Common through Balham , Tooting , Merton and Morden to connect to the route of the W & SR and then continue to Sutton . The LER , C & SLR , and DR would invest in the construction of the W & SR , for which the estimated cost had risen to £ 1 @.@ 7 million ( approximately £ 83 @.@ 7 million today ) . The DR would operate trains over the W & SR from Sutton to Wimbledon and thence to central London ; the C & SLR would operate trains over the southern end of the W & SR from Sutton to Morden then via the new C & SLR extension to Clapham Common and northwards . The plans also included the construction of a depot at Morden for use by DR and C & SLR trains . 
 The Southern Railway ( SR ) , successor to both the L & SWR and the LB & SCR under the 1923 grouping of railways , objected to the plan to extend the C & SLR line to Sutton – Sir Herbert Walker , General Manager of the SR , described the proposals as an " invasion " of the SR 's territory allocated by the grouping agreement . Walker proposed a limited extension of the CS & LR as far as Tooting and offered to allow the C & SLR 's tube trains to run to Wimbledon via a connection to the SR 's Tooting to Wimbledon line . He also proposed that the SR should build the W & SR instead . The UERL rejected Walker 's plan , claiming that the entire extension to Morden was needed as that was the only place to build the necessary depot . Without the compromise arrangement , the House of Lords rejected the whole scheme but the House of Commons , which wanted the tube service to be extended from Clapham , encouraged further negotiations between the UERL and SR . 
 In July 1923 , an agreement was made that the SR would withdraw its objection in exchange for a transfer of the UERL 's interests in the W & SR . The District railway would be allowed to operate to Sutton via the W & SR route , although this was not pursued further . The Wimbledon and Sutton Railway Act , 1923 , the London Electric Railway Act , 1923 and the City and South London Railway Act , 1923 all received Royal Assent on 2 August 1923 . The SR arranged for the take @-@ over and winding @-@ up of the W & SR . 
 The C & SLR soon started construction of its southern extension which opened to a terminus at Morden on 13 September 1926 , with a depot south of the station and within 200 yards ( 183 m ) of the W & SR route , although no connection was made between the two lines . Without the extension of the District line to Sutton , the additional tracks between Wimbledon and Putney were not required and the work was not carried out . The additional tracks between Parsons Green and Fulham Broadway were constructed but have only been used as sidings . Once the tube line was opened , the Underground company established a network of bus routes to the south , using Morden station as their hub . These routes had a significant impact on the SR 's operations in the area , with the SR estimating in 1928 that it had lost approximately four million passengers per year . The UERL though was able to demonstrate that its passenger numbers on its buses to Sutton station were actually more than double those for Morden . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 Construction of the line from Wimbledon to Sutton was slower . Work started at Wimbledon in October 1927 , but property purchases were not completed until the middle of 1928 and the contractor , Sir Robert McAlpine & Sons , did not begin work at Sutton until July 1928 . The landscape traversed by the line is undulating and rises from about 50 feet ( 15 m ) above sea @-@ level at Wimbledon to about 200 feet ( 61 m ) at Sutton . Designed for operation exclusively by the electric multiple unit , extensive embankments and cuttings were constructed and steep gradients up to 1 in 44 ( 2 @.@ 27 % ) and tight @-@ radius curves were employed . Only 35 chains ( 0 @.@ 438 mi or 0 @.@ 705 km ) of the route was built as level track and 24 bridges were required , the largest of which spans 120 feet ( 37 m ) over the A24 close to Morden Park . 
 The station buildings at the two end stations , Wimbledon and Sutton , were rebuilt between 1927 and 1930 and six stations were constructed at Wimbledon Chase , South Merton , Morden South , St. Helier , Sutton Common and West Sutton . Fewer stations were built than planned in 1910 , but all were on sites proposed then , except St Helier station which was built to serve the London County Council 's new St. Helier housing estate , then under construction . With the exception of South Merton , which was built without , all stations had white stone or concrete faced buildings with access to the platforms by stairs up or down from street level . Provided with 520 @-@ foot ( 160 m ) long island platforms , the stations could accommodate trains eight coaches long . 
 = = Opening and operation = = 
 Work from Wimbledon to South Merton was completed quickly so that services could begin running as a single @-@ track operation on 7 July 1929 . The remainder of the line opened on 5 January 1930 , more than forty @-@ five years after the first Wimbledon to Sutton link was proposed . 
 As hoped by the original promoters , the opening of the line stimulated the construction of new areas of private and public residential development throughout the 1930s , although large areas remain as parks and playing fields . The St. Helier estate was completed in 1936 . The opening of the Wimbledon to Sutton line and the C & SLR led the population of the parish of Morden , previously the most rural of the areas through which the lines passed , to increase from 1 @,@ 355 in 1921 to 12 @,@ 618 in 1931 and 35 @,@ 417 in 1951 . 
 Ordinary ticket sales from Morden South station increased from 9 @,@ 840 in 1930 to 50 @,@ 817 in 1938 but , from the SR 's perspective , the line was not a great success . The service , originally operating from West Croydon to Holborn Viaduct station in central London , was slow and indirect and many of the potential passengers from the line 's catchment area continued to use the buses and tube route via Morden . 
 Goods services operated on the line to a goods yard at St. Helier station until it was closed in 1963 , and to an Express Dairies bottling plant adjacent to Morden South station which opened in 1954 and closed in 1992 . 
 The line is now called the St Helier Line , and forms part of the Sutton Loop , served by trains from Thameslink and Southern . 
 = George S. Greene = 
 George Sears Greene ( May 6 , 1801 – January 28 , 1899 ) was a civil engineer and a Union general during the American Civil War . He was part of the Greene family of Rhode Island , which had a record of distinguished military service to the United States . He first served in the Army from 1823 to 1836 after graduating second from his class at West Point . As a civilian , he was a founder of the American Society of Civil Engineers and Architects and was responsible for numerous railroads and aqueduct construction projects in the northeastern United States . 
 After 25 years as a civilian , he rejoined the Army to fight in the American Civil War . Despite his age , he quickly rose up the ranks and was appointed a brigadier general in early 1862 . During the war , he took part in the Northern Virginia Campaign , the Battle of Antietam , and the Battle of Chancellorsville . His most notable contribution during the war was his defense of the Union right flank at Culp 's Hill during the Battle of Gettysburg . He returned to engineering work after the war until his death in 1899 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Greene was born in <unk> , Rhode Island , one of nine children of Caleb and Sarah Robinson ( Greene ) Greene . His family had roots in the founding of Rhode Island and in the American Revolutionary War , including General Nathanael Greene , George 's second cousin . Caleb was a financially shrewd ship owner and merchant , but the Embargo Act of 1807 , which prohibited U.S. vessels from carrying goods to other countries , and the War of 1812 left his family in financial difficulties . Young George attended Wrentham Academy and then a Latin grammar school in Providence and hoped to attend Brown University there , but his impoverished father could not afford it , so he moved to New York City and found work in a dry goods store on Pearl Street . 
 In the New York store , Greene met Major Sylvanus Thayer , superintendent of the United States Military Academy , who recommended him to the Secretary of War for appointment to the academy . Greene entered West Point at age 18 and graduated second of 35 cadets in the class of 1823 . Classmates of Greene 's included future Union Adjutant General Lorenzo Thomas , Joseph K. Mansfield , David Hunter , Dennis Hart Mahan , and Albert Sidney Johnston . Top graduates of the academy generally chose the Engineers as their branch , but Greene decided on the artillery and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 3rd U.S. Artillery Regiment . However , due to his excellent academic performance , he stayed at the academy until 1827 as an assistant professor of mathematics and as a principal assistant professor of engineering . One of the students he taught during this period was Cadet Robert E. Lee . 
 In the summer of 1828 Greene married Mary Elizabeth Vinton , sister of his best friend at West Point , David Vinton . Elizabeth gave birth to three children over the next four years : Mary Vinton , George Sears , and Francis Vinton Greene . While assigned to Fort Sullivan in Eastport , Maine in 1833 , tragedy struck Greene 's family : Elizabeth and all three of their children died within seven months , probably from tuberculosis . To ease the pain on his mind and to escape the isolation and loneliness of peacetime Army garrison duty , he immersed himself in study of both the law and medicine , coming close to professional certification in both by the time he resigned his commission in 1836 to become a civil engineer . 
 Greene built railroads in six states and designed municipal sewage and water systems for Washington , D.C. , Detroit , and several other cities . In New York City , he designed the Croton Aqueduct reservoir in Central Park and the enlarged High Bridge over the Harlem River . He was one of twelve founders in New York City of the American Society of Civil Engineers and Architects . While on a trip to Maine for railroad surveying , he met Martha Barrett Dana , daughter of Samuel Dana , a prominent Massachusetts politician . They were married in Charlestown , Massachusetts , on February 21 , 1837 . They had six children together , including four sons ( three of them later served in the military ) , one daughter , and one son who died in infancy . 
 = = Civil War = = 
 Despite being over 60 years old and having been out of the Army for 25 years , the crisis of the Union compelled Greene to seek to rejoin the service . He was essentially apolitical and was not an abolitionist , but he was a firm believer in restoring the Union . He was appointed colonel of the 60th New York Volunteer Infantry on January 18 , 1862 . The regiment of upstate New Yorkers had been dissatisfied with their colonel and the company commanders had petitioned for his removal . Governor Edwin D. Morgan , although initially reluctant to appoint Greene because of his age , saw his 13 years of regular army experience as a solution to his political / military problem . During this period , Governor John A. Andrew of Massachusetts was also prepared to offer Greene a regiment , but Greene chose to serve New York . The officers of the 60th were dismayed when the elderly , gray @-@ haired man reported for duty . They had requested that their lieutenant colonel be promoted , which would have raised many of them in rank themselves . 
 On April 28 , 1862 , Greene was appointed brigadier general of volunteers and served on the staff of Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Banks in the Shenandoah Valley campaign against Stonewall Jackson . At age 61 , Greene was one of the oldest generals in the Union army and his troops took to calling him " Old Man " or " Pap " Greene . ( There were actually 17 general officers in the Civil War older than Greene . ) However , his age did not keep him from being one of the most aggressive commanders in the army . He commanded the 3rd Brigade , 2nd Division , II Corps , of the Army of Virginia at the Battle of Cedar Mountain during the Northern Virginia Campaign . Attacked by a Confederate force three times the size of his own , Greene and his men refused to give ground , holding out until the neighboring Union units were forced to withdraw . His division commander , Brig. Gen. John W. Geary , received a severe wound during the action and Greene took command of the division temporarily . 
 Greene was again temporarily elevated to command of his division , now designated part of the XII Corps of the Army of the Potomac , at the Battle of Antietam . His division 's three brigades were led by junior officers who had survived Cedar Mountain . Even though XII Corps commander Brig. Gen. Joseph K. Mansfield was killed shortly after the fighting began , Greene led a crushing attack against the Confederates near the Dunker Church , achieving the farthest penetration of Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson 's lines than any Union unit . Under immense pressure , Greene held his small division ( only 1 @,@ 727 men engaged at the start of the day ) in advance of the rest of the army for four hours , but eventually withdrew after suffering heavy losses . While the division was posted to Harpers Ferry , Greene took a three @-@ week sick leave . Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard speculated that Greene , like many of his fellow officers , was sickened by the stench of dead and wounded at Antietam . When he returned , there was a new division commander , Brig. Gen. Geary . Greene was disgruntled that Geary , with only a few days seniority over him , was selected for the post ; Geary had been wounded at Cedar Mountain and his combat record was not as good , but his political connections and a sentiment that a wounded officer should not be set back in his career unnecessarily , gave him the nod . 
 Greene resumed command of the 3rd Brigade , which was involved in minor skirmishes in northern Virginia and not engaged at the Battle of Fredericksburg in December . At the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863 , his brigade was in the center of the line . When the Union right — the XI Corps — collapsed , Greene 's brigade was subjected to enfilade artillery fire and then infantry assaults . He had ordered his men to fortify their positions 200 yards ( 180 m ) to their front using abatis and trenches and they were able to hold out against several Confederate assaults , although losing 528 men of 2 @,@ 032 engaged . During part of the battle , Greene once again assumed temporary command of the division when Geary was wounded again . 
 = = = Gettysburg = = = 
 The Battle of Gettysburg was the highlight of Greene 's military career . On July 2 , 1863 , Maj. Gen. George G. Meade shifted almost the entire XII Corps from the Union right to strengthen the left flank , which was under heavy attack . Greene 's lone brigade of 1 @,@ 350 New Yorkers ( five regiments ) was left to defend a one @-@ half @-@ mile line on Culp 's Hill when an entire Confederate division attacked . Fortunately , Greene had previously demonstrated good sense ( as befits a civil engineer ) by insisting that his troops construct strong field fortifications , despite a lack of interest in doing so from his division commander , Geary , and corps commander , Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum . In Greene 's finest moment of the war , his preparations proved decisive and his brigade held off multiple attacks for hours . He was active the entire engagement rallying his men to defend their positions in the darkness . Brig. Gen. Alpheus Williams , acting corps commander on July 2 , commended Greene for his " skill and judgment " in this defense , especially in his using the " advantages " of his position . Late at night , the rest of the XII Corps returned to Culp 's Hill . The fighting resumed the next morning and raged for over seven hours , but the Union troops held Culp 's Hill . They regained some of the lost ground and thwarted renewed Confederate attacks . The battle for Culp 's Hill included the two oldest generals in each army , Greene at 62 and Brig. Gen. William " Extra Billy " Smith at 65 . 
 The desperate fighting on the Union right flank was as important as the more famous defense of the Union left flank on July 2 , by Col. Strong Vincent 's brigade on Little Round Top . In fact , given that the Union line was only 400 yards ( 370 m ) from the vital Union supply line on the Baltimore Pike , it can be argued that it was more important . However , Greene 's contribution to this critical battle have never been widely heralded , principally because of a dispute between Meade and Slocum over the filing of their official reports . But a member of Greene 's brigade wrote : 
 Had the breastworks not been built , and had there only been the thin line of our unprotected brigade , that line must have been swept away like leaves before the wind , by the oncoming of so heavy a mass of troops , and the [ Baltimore ] pike would have been reached by the enemy . 
 = = = Western Theater = = = 
 In the fall of 1863 , the XII Corps was transferred to the West to reinforce the Union forces besieged at Chattanooga . At the Battle of Wauhatchie , during a surprise night attack by the Confederate forces , Greene was wounded in the face , with his jaw crushed and some teeth carried away . Subsequent surgery was not able to correct his condition and he suffered from the effects of his wound for the rest of his life . After six weeks of medical leave , he was assigned to light court @-@ martial duty until January 1865 , when he was sent to join Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman 's army in North Carolina . Initially Greene voluntarily served on the staff of Maj. Gen. Jacob D. Cox participating in the battle at Kinston , where he had his horse shot out from under him . At the very end of the war Greene was in command of the 3rd Brigade in Absalom Baird 's 3rd Division , XIV Corps , and participated in the capture of Raleigh and the pursuit of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston 's army until its surrender . 
 = = Postbellum career = = 
 After the war , Greene served on court @-@ martial duty for a year and then returned to civil engineering in New York and Washington , D.C. From 1867 to 1871 he was the chief engineer commissioner of the Croton Aqueduct Department in New York . At the age of 86 , he inspected the entire 30 @-@ mile Croton Aqueduct structure on foot . He served as president of the American Society of Civil Engineers from 1875 to 1877 and president of the New York Genealogical and Biographical Society . He was appointed to West Point 's Board of Visitors in 1881 . 
 By 1892 , Greene was the oldest surviving Union general and the oldest living graduate of West Point . He petitioned the United States Congress for an engineer captain 's pension that would be of help to his family after his death . The best that Congress was willing to do was arranged by Congressman and Gettysburg veteran Daniel E. Sickles of New York , a first lieutenant 's pension , based on the highest rank Greene had achieved in the regular army . On August 18 , 1894 , Greene took the oath of office as a first lieutenant of artillery and became , at 93 , the oldest lieutenant in the U.S. Army for 48 hours . Veterans in the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States ( MOLLUS ) declared that he was the oldest lieutenant in world history . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Greene died at age 97 in Morristown , New Jersey , and was buried in the Greene family cemetery in Warwick , Rhode Island , with a two @-@ ton boulder from Culp 's Hill placed above his grave . He is memorialized with a statue erected in 1906 by the State of New York on Culp 's Hill in Gettysburg National Military Park . 
 Greene 's wife Martha died in 1883 at an age of 74 . Their oldest son , Lieutenant Samuel Dana Greene , was the executive officer on the ironclad ship USS Monitor during the Battle of Hampton Roads . Another of their sons , Francis V. Greene , commanded a brigade at the Battle of Manila during the Spanish – American War . A third , Charles Thurston Greene , was a lieutenant on his father 's staff at Culp 's Hill . Later in 1863 , Charles was wounded by an artillery shell and his leg was amputated , but he remained on active service until 1870 . George Sears Greene , Jr . , volunteered to serve but was not allowed to do so by his father so he could survive and carry on the family name . 
 A memorial tablet honoring Greene was approved by the Rhode Island General Assembly in 1910 at a sum of 460 dollars . The bronze plaque hangs inside the south entrance of the Rhode Island State House . 
 A description of George Sears Greene from Lt. George K. Collins of the 149th New York Infantry sums up the general : 
 He was a West Point graduate , about 60 years old , thick set , five feet ten inches high , dark complexioned , iron gray hair , full gray beard and mustache , gruff in manner and stern in appearance , but with all an excellent officer and under a rough exterior possessing a kind heart . In the end the men learned to love and respect him as much as in the beginning they feared him , and this was saying a good deal on the subject . He knew how to drill , how to command , and in the hour of peril how to care for his command , and the men respected him accordingly . 
 = The Castle Doctrine = 
 The Castle Doctrine is a 2014 strategy video game developed and published by Jason Rohrer for Microsoft Windows , OS X , and Linux via Valve Corporation 's Steam platform . The game was released on January 29 , 2014 for all platforms and is available as public domain software on <unk> . Set in the early 1990s , it pits players against one another as they invade others ' houses and attempt to steal money from their vaults , while also setting up traps and other obstacles to keep their own vaults safe . 
 In creating the game , Rohrer was influenced by his childhood fear of his house being robbed , numerous publicized shootings , and his own political views regarding gun rights and home invasions . During development and beta testing , the game went through several changes that increased its difficulty . It received mixed reviews from critics , with some praising the design and creativity and others finding it hard to empathize with the game 's intended message . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The Castle Doctrine incorporates elements of puzzle , strategy , stealth , and roguelike games , viewed from a 2D perspective . It focuses on maintaining and protecting a vault of money stored in one 's house from intruders . These intruders are actually other players of the game ; likewise , the player can invade others ' houses and steal their money — presented in a list rather than found through exploration — in the same way . This list shows a pre @-@ determined three @-@ name pseudonym of each player , the number of dollars contained in their vault , how many others have tried to rob it , and how many have died in the process . All deaths in the game are permanent ; upon dying , the player must create a new character . 
 The player can protect their vault in a number of ways , such as building walls , keeping guard dogs , setting up traps such as electrified floors and bottomless pits , and giving guns to the player 's family members so that they can defend the vault as well . The game does not punish the player for family members — by default , a wife and two children — being murdered by intruders ; the player can even view footage of the incident afterwards . Rather , protecting the money is the goal the game emphasizes . The player starts off with $ 2 @,@ 000 in cash and steals more from others ' vaults ; it can be used to purchase more objects to defend one 's own vault . Additionally , a house is not accessible by thieves when its owner is retooling it for defense . 
 When invading another 's house , the player can attempt to deter these defenses in such ways as smashing windows , dismantling walls , short @-@ circuiting machines , and even drugging guard dogs with tainted meat , in addition to killing any residents that are armed . Reaching a vault is always possible with enough skill ; the game forces players to escape their own traps before other players can access them . Being caught in one 's own traps has the same consequence as any other trap in the game : permadeath . 
 = = Development = = 
 = = = Conception and design = = = 
 The Castle Doctrine was created by indie developer Jason Rohrer ; its ideas were drawn from Rohrer 's childhood anxieties about his family 's house being burgled , and his adult sense of responsibility over protecting his family . The game 's central theme is the castle doctrine and includes the issue of gun rights ; Rohrer created it partially as an " artistic statement " on defending one 's family through violence . He summarized his goals with the game as creating something " that makes you feel violated and makes you want to protect stuff that ’ s yours , and puts you in the process of securing what ’ s yours . " However , he has remarked that the consequence of making players feel hypocritical — since they are invading others ' homes as well — was partially intentional and an " elegant " idea . 
 Rohrer noted in an interview his aversion to creating a " ridiculous caricature of some post @-@ apocalyptic man ’ s world , where we ’ ll all just robbing each other , " and instead called his game pre @-@ apocalyptic in setting and style . In terms of aesthetics , Rohrer aimed for a " very clean , no frills , no fluff , no filler kind of design " that emphasized function in all of its objects . He has noted that some players have complained about not being able to decorate their houses non @-@ functionally , but is unsympathetic , saying that the game is not FarmVille . The game was , however , influenced by Minecraft , which — while heavily tied to cosmetic decoration — involves similar themes of protecting one 's creations from other players as in The Castle Doctrine . 
 Rohrer thought of adding family members for the player 's character early in the game 's development , but scrapped it at first because of the extra complexity and not knowing how to make them more than inanimate objects . After a dream , however , he was inspired to see if there was a practical way to implement them that would further the game 's " moral dimension . " 
 = = = Testing and releases = = = 
 The Castle Doctrine was first released as a paid alpha and sold at half @-@ price from March 2013 until its official release on January 29 , 2014 . As was visible through its history of updates during beta testing , it went through several changes , primarily the increase of gameplay difficulty . One was the addition of dedicated " perma @-@ perma @-@ death " servers , where players could not even re @-@ create characters after dying , in contrast to the game 's generic " perma @-@ death " servers . Another was " blueprints , " which allow players to get a general sense of a house 's layout before entering and thus encourage setting up puzzle @-@ based — rather than luck @-@ based — vault defenses . Rohrer did not , however , want the game to be impossible , so he took the step of forcing players to evade their own traps before the houses would be accessible to others . The game has been placed in the public domain and is hosted on SourceForge . 
 Upon release , the game 's 50 % discount was scaled back to 25 % for one week . It has not gone on sale since , as Rohrer believes that " sales screw your fans " as they discourage buying games one wants during non @-@ sale periods . Following the game 's release , Rohrer used $ 3 @,@ 000 USD of alpha release earnings to fund a competition in which players could win money , paintings , gift cards , and other prizes by having the highest worth in @-@ game houses . The highest prize awarded was $ 316 USD .

 The Castle Doctrine received mixed reviews from critics , with a score on review aggregator Metacritic of 58 / 100 . Patrick Carlson of PC Gamer reviewed the game well , responding positively to the game rewarding experimentation and being easy to understand , describing it as thoughtfully designed . Game Informer 's Daniel Tack also rated the game well , commenting particularly on its creativity , stating though that he did not think the game was " deep enough to stay interesting for long . " Writing for Destructoid , Patrick Hancock shared Tack 's opinion that the game was a good experience , but said he would find it hard to recommend . 
 Polygon 's Russ Pitts found the game a frustrating exercise , his experience determined by the arbitrary quality of player designed houses , and further obstructed by the harsh consequences of failure . Pitts felt the game valued its message over the player 's time and yet found the message hard to take seriously ; he would describe the game as the most disturbing he had ever played . Keza MacDonald , in her review at IGN , shared these frustrations , finding that tackling player @-@ constructed houses made the game over @-@ reliant on trial and error . She also found it hard to empathize with the small , pixelated characters , leading her to believe that the game failed in " communicating much of a message " . Nick <unk> of GameSpot also gave the game a largely negative review , criticising the nihilistic feel , and saying that it did not bring out the emotions it was aimed to . 
 = 2010 – 11 Australian Baseball League season = 
 The 2010 – 11 Australian Baseball League season was the inaugural Australian Baseball League ( ABL ) season , and was held from 6 November 2010 to 13 February 2011 . It came 12 years after the old Australian Baseball League ceased and is the successor of the mostly amateur Claxton Shield competition that has been played since 1934 . The season consisted of six teams competing in a 40 @-@ game schedule , followed by a three @-@ round finals series to determine the ABL champion . 
 At the conclusion of the regular season , the Sydney Blue Sox , Perth Heat , Adelaide Bite and Melbourne Aces progressed to the finals series , while the Brisbane Bandits and Canberra Cavalry were only eliminated from contention on the final day of the season . Both Melbourne and Sydney were eliminated by Adelaide in the minor semi @-@ final series and the preliminary final series , respectively . Perth became the inaugural ABL champions when they defeated Adelaide two games to one in the championship series . 
 = = Formation = = 
 In June 2009 , it was announced that the rights to the Claxton Shield had been sold to a new Australian Baseball League , with ownership split between Major League Baseball 's 75 percent share and the 25 percent share owned by the Australian Baseball Federation . The 2010 Claxton Shield tournament was considered preparation for the inaugural ABL season . 
 Although initial reports suggested that between eight and ten teams would contest the first season , including the possibility of a team based in New Zealand , six teams representing Adelaide , Brisbane , Canberra , Melbourne , Perth and Sydney were announced in November 2009 as the foundation clubs . 
 Compared to the previous season 's Claxton Shield tournament , there were few structural changes to the competition . With the expansion from five to six teams , the need for teams to have a bye was eliminated , with all teams participating in games each round . The individual rounds were expanded from three to four games per round , resulting in an increase from 24 to 40 games per team for the season . The postseason was also expanded to include the top four teams , rather than only the top three .

 During the season each team made use of a 22 @-@ man active roster , drawn from 35 @-@ man squads announced on 28 October 2010 .

 Four of the six teams used their existing venues from the Claxton Shield : the Adelaide Bite , Perth Heat and Sydney Blue Sox all used the same grounds used in the 2010 Claxton Shield by the respective state teams , and the Canberra Cavalry used the same venue used by Australia Provincial when they last contested the Claxton Shield in 2008 : <unk> Ballpark . 
 The Melbourne Aces played at the Melbourne Showgrounds , after the Victorian state government announced a A $ 300 @,@ 000 upgrade of the grounds . Similarly the Queensland state government announced a A $ 300 @,@ 000 upgrade of the Brisbane Exhibition Ground for use by the Brisbane Bandits as their home field . 
 = = Regular season = = 
 The season length was similar to the 2010 Claxton Shield by spreading ten rounds over twelve weeks , playing only the season 's first game in the first week and taking a week off for Christmas and Boxing Day . Six teams were involved , playing a four @-@ game series every week totaling two series against each team , one at home and one away . In total , the schedule allowed for 40 regular season games per team before a four @-@ team finals series . During the regular season , games were played Thursday to Sunday , varying depending on the series and team , with 18 games scheduled as doubleheaders on a Saturday . <unk> were scheduled to have the first of the two games shortened to seven innings , with the second game using the full nine innings . 
 One of the regular season games resulted in a tie , which is unusual in baseball given the provision in the rules of the game to play extra innings to determine a winner . The game between the Sydney Blue Sox and the Melbourne Aces at Blacktown Olympic Park was the second game of a makeup doubleheader as a result of rain earlier that weekend washing out two games , and so had been shortened to seven innings . A rain delay during the first game of the day forced the second game to a later start . Under a provision in the ABL rules that is modeled on the International Baseball Federation 's tiebreaker rule , in any extra inning that starts within an hour of the curfew time for the game — a time set to allow the visiting team time to meet travel schedules to return home at the end of a series — each team starts with runners at first and second base with nobody out . In addition , no new inning may start within 15 minutes of the curfew time . The game was scoreless at the end of the regulation seven innings , and was tied at 1 – 1 at the end of the eighth inning , which ended at the curfew time . Though the game was an official game , the result did not count towards the season standings . 
 All but 4 of the scheduled 120 games were played . The four games that were not played were the series scheduled between the Brisbane Bandits and the Canberra Cavalry at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground for the ninth round . Flooding in Brisbane had resulted in the Exhibition Ground being used as an evacuation centre for affected residents . Initially the ABL postponed the series , leaving a decision as to whether the games would be re @-@ scheduled to a later time . Just prior to the final round of scheduled games , it was announced that the games would go ahead in the form of two doubleheaders , but that only games that would affect the playoffs would be played . When Brisbane lost the final game of their series against the Adelaide Bite , both they and Canberra were eliminated from contention for the playoffs ; hence , the makeup games were not played . 
 The Perth Heat and Sydney Blue Sox were the first teams to clinch positions in the finals series when Perth defeated the Melbourne Aces in the final game of their series in round 9 . The Adelaide Bite were the next team to secure a place in the top four , after winning the third of an expanded six @-@ game series against Brisbane . It was only on the final day of the regular season that Melbourne was able to claim the fourth finals position , and that the makeup of the semi @-@ final series was decided : Sydney hosting Perth in the major semi @-@ final series , and Adelaide hosting Melbourne in the minor semi @-@ final series .

 At the completion of the regular season , the top four teams progressed to the postseason . It was contested over three weeks , following the Page playoff system . Each stage was decided by a best – of – three game series . Unlike regular season games , which made use of a variation of the International Baseball Federation 's mercy rule after seven innings , no such rule was in place for postseason games ; all games went the full nine innings , with the only exception being two games that were tied after nine innings , therefore requiring extra innings . 
 The Perth Heat and Adelaide Bite each swept their semi @-@ final series against the Sydney Blue Sox and Melbourne Aces respectively , resulting in the Heat qualifying for and hosting the championship series , and the Aces being eliminated . The Bite won the preliminary final series against the Blue Sox two games to one , to advance to the championship series . Though Adelaide won the first championship series game , the Perth Heat won the remaining two games to claim the title of ABL Champions .

 = Finnish parliamentary election , 2011 = 
 Parliamentary elections were held in Finland on 17 April 2011 after the termination of the previous parliamentary term . Advance voting , which included voting by Finnish expatriates , was held between 6 and 12 April with a turnout of 31 @.@ 2 % . 
 The importance of the election was magnified due to Finland 's capacity to influence the European Union 's decision in regard to affecting a bailout for Portugal via the European Financial Stability Facility , as part of financial support systems for debt @-@ laden European countries , and the fall of the Portuguese government . Small differences in the opinion polls for the traditional three big parties ( the National Coalition Party , the Centre Party and the Social Democratic Party ) and the surprising rise in support for the True Finns also electrified the atmosphere ahead of the election . 
 The election resulted in a breakthrough for the populist True Finns , which came head @-@ to @-@ head with the three big parties , while every other parliamentary party in mainland Finland , excluding Åland , lost popularity . The National Coalition Party ( NCP ) also ended up as the biggest party for the first time in its history . The total turnout rose to 70 @.@ 5 % from 67 @.@ 9 % in the previous election ; and corruption scandals also resulted in an anti @-@ incumbency vote . The incumbent , Centre Party @-@ led coalition , which included the NCP , Green League and Swedish People 's Party ( SPP ) , lost its majority by two seats and their Prime Minister Mari Kiviniemi of the Centre Party signaled that her party would then sit in opposition . 
 The incumbent Minister of Finance Jyrki Katainen , as the leader of the biggest party in the new parliament , was tasked to form a new government . During government formation talks , the True Finns said they would withdraw if the government accepted the Portuguese bailout . Katainen then continued six @-@ party talks that included the NCP , the SDP , the Left Alliance , Green League , Christian Democrats and the SPP . However , these negotiations ran aground on 1 June as the Social Democrats and the Left Alliance walked out of the talks due to strong differences on economic policies . Negotiations were set to continue under Katainen 's proposed premiership , though the composition of the new government was not certain at the time . Due to the Green League 's opposition to forming a government with the NCP , the Centre Party and the Christian Democrats , Katainen — avoiding a resultant minority government — announced on 10 June that the same six parties would return to negotiations , describing it as the " only possible coalition . " On 17 June , the six parties came to an agreement on forming a coalition government , led by Katainen and consisting of 19 ministers . The ministerial portfolios were divided with the NCP and the SDP both having six ministers , while the Left Alliance , the Greens and the SPP would each have two and the Christian Democrats would have one . The six parties announced their ministers designate between 17 – 20 June . On 22 June the new parliament elected Jyrki Katainen as prime minister .

Vanhanen stepped down from the position of the Prime Minister a few days later and was replaced by Kiviniemi , who became the second female Prime Minister in Finland 's history . 
 The incumbent government was considering proposals for a new constitution , including a controversial phrase in the first paragraph of the third clause that would have read " Finland is a member of the European Union .

Then Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen was at the core of the accusations after the investigations showed he had also been among the beneficiaries of the groups ' financing ; this was despite one of the members of the group who had planned to build the biggest shopping mall in the country received Vanhanen 's support for the plans against the grain of public opinion , thus eliciting accusations that he could have been influenced by the individual . Blame was also put on the Centre Party 's secretary <unk> Korhonen . This was said to have helped the True Finns . 
 The European sovereign debt crisis was another important issue in the election , even more so after Portugal applied for an EU bailout on 6 April , the first day of advance voting . According to an opinion poll nearly 60 % of Finns were against Finland 's participation in bailing out the crisis @-@ ridden countries . All four parties of the governing coalition ( Centre Party , National Coalition Party , Green League and the Swedish People 's Party ) support Finland 's participation in the bailout and all four opposition parties ( Social Democrats , Left Alliance , Christian Democrats and the True Finns ) oppose such measures . The issue helped Soini become the most visible opposition leader . Soini then also stated that his party would not join in any coalition that supports guarantees to the crisis @-@ ridden EU countries . He said that their crises are a consequence of the EU 's failure . Finance Minister Jyrki Katainen had commented that a bailout for Portugal should only happen if the Portuguese parliament passed even tougher austerity measures than the failed programme that led to an early Portuguese election : " The package must be really strict because otherwise it doesn 't make any sense . The package must be harder and more comprehensive than the one the parliament voted against . " Despite his comments , the National Coalition Party believed the bailout to be in Finland 's interests . It , along with the Centre Party , supported the bailout under the EU 's auspices , while the True Finns and the Social Democrats were opposed to it . The True Finns said that Finnish taxpayers were being unjustly burdened by " <unk> " within the eurozone and pointed out that no one aided Finland during its own financial crisis in the 1990s . Helsingin Sanomat read the affair as having added " confusion " and complexity to the electoral race . The effect of the Finnish election on a possible EU bailout caused concern amongst to international investors as " it is a very distinct possibility that the next government and parliament of Finland will not want to agree to the things that the current government has signed up for , namely supporting Portugal and agreeing to the permanent and temporary crisis mechanisms , " as there was said to be an " even chance " of Finland blocking a bailout for Portugal as its support was crucial because it would need the unanimous support of all national governments to pass . Finland 's participation was further thrown in doubt as it was the only eurozone country to require parliamentary approval of any such measure . Should a new Finnish administration opt out of the bailout , this could throw into doubt the eurozone 's capacity to maintain financial stability . 
 Yet another important issue during the campaign was that of the languages in the country . The status of the Swedish and Russian languages was an hot @-@ button issue . A growing number of people believe that the Swedish language should be abolished as the country 's second official language , as only a small percentage of the country use Swedish as their first language and that a large number of government officials do not use Swedish . A report by the Council of Europe stated that the Swedish language 's status as Finland 's second official language was in danger of being eroded in the longer term because of the officials ' poor language skills and the lack of opportunities to study the language . However , the status of Russian was considered to be rising as several municipalities in eastern Finland sought to increase the role of the language at local schools . At the time , Swedish was spoken by 5 @.@ 42 % of the population as their mother tongue , with Russian spoken by 1 @.@ 01 % and the Sami languages spoken by 0 @.@ 03 % . 
 Furthermore , despite changes to the campaign finance laws , there was no perceptible decrease in campaigning activity . One reason was a compensatory expansion of advertising by way of internet search engines such as Facebook and other social media which were relatively inexpensive . Helsingin Sanomat called election workers in all electoral districts , excluding the Åland Islands , to ask for their assessments of the electoral campaigns . They reported that while the NCP 's campaign was the most visible , the Centre Party and the Social Democrats also had high @-@ profile campaigns with some variations across districts . The NCP were also said to be spending more of their own money than in the past .

 = = = = Centre Party = = = = 
 The Centre Party has been the traditional party of rural voters , but according to polls , it had been losing support to the True Finns in its traditional stronghold regions . The party has traditionally had both a liberal and a conservative wing , however , with the leadership reshuffling in 2010 , the central posts are now held by the liberal wing . The Centre Party has held the portfolio of the prime minister since 2003 . According to opinion polls , Kiviniemi 's personal support was higher than that of the party . She had also been campaigning as a staunch defender of Finland 's participation in guarantees to the crisis @-@ ridden EU countries .

 The Christian Democrats , led by <unk> Räsänen , had announced that they would not support any governing coalition that plans on legalising same @-@ sex marriage .

 The Green League , which was part of the governing coalition , announced that it will not participate in any coalition that plans to give licences to new nuclear reactors .

 As a defender of high taxes , the Left Alliance 's leader Paavo Arhinmäki has said that the party can be described as " supportive of income redistribution . " The Left Alliance is critical of nuclear energy and is also against Finland 's participation in the EU @-@ sponsored Portuguese bailout . 
 = = = = National Coalition Party = = = = 
 Traditionally a pro @-@ market economy and pro @-@ EU centre @-@ right party , the NCP were the largest party in the parliament for the first time in its history , though losing seats since the 2007 election . Although leading in the opinion polls for several years , it started to see some loss of support after the rise of the True Finns . Despite being originally founded as a primarily conservative party , an analysis on the party 's programmes made by an NCP @-@ affiliated think tank concluded that in the 2000s the liberal wing had gained the upper hand and had started to change the party 's political ideology . At the party conference in 2010 , the NCP delegates voted in favour of legalising same @-@ sex marriage . The party 's supporters are also generally very supportive of market economy , nuclear power and Finland 's admission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation . 
 Led by incumbent Minister of Finance Jyrki Katainen , the NCP has been strongly supportive of Finland 's participation in EU bailouts with Katainen underlining the importance of what he calls " European responsibility . " He also invited Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt to observe the campaign , though Reinfeldt did not address a party rally . MP Ben <unk> said that he could not estimate Reinfeldt 's effect on voters . 
 = = = = Social Democratic Party = = = = 
 Polls concerning preference for the favourite candidate for Prime Minister indicated that SDP leader Jutta Urpilainen did not enjoy the support of everyone in her party . Urpilainen herself has denied claims of a leadership crisis . 
 In early April , the new leader of the Swedish Social Democrats , Håkan <unk> , visited Finland in order to show support for the SDP in the election . The party also invited other foreign politicians and ministers for a campaign rally in the week before the election . Liisa <unk> , an SDP MEP , justified this by saying that it was a tradition to invite colleagues from other states . The party 's main guest was the German chairman of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament Martin Schulz . In the interim , the party also invited Swedish Social Democrat Marita <unk> who echoed the view that " investors and banks need to take responsibility . " Former Prime Minister Paavo <unk> was also present ; he praised the EU and EMU and said that Finland is in a " psychological and moral slump . " Following a recent election of his own , the leader of the Estonian Social Democratic Party Sven <unk> and MEP <unk> Padar traveled to campaign rallies in Helsinki and Espoo on 11 April to show support for their " sister party 's field campaign . " <unk> said that the " Social Democrats recently garnered a strong vote in Estonia and are clearly on the rise . Now we need the same to happen in Finland . " Padar also said that because of the rise of anti @-@ EU parties in both Finland and other countries : " That is why I personally consider it important to explain to the Finnish people that Europe should not be feared . Since Estonia and Finland are the only Nordic countries in the Eurozone , we need to have [ a ] strong partnership in the region . " 
 = = = = Swedish People 's Party = = = = 
 The Swedish People 's Party of Finland ( SPP ) is the dominant party amongst Swedish @-@ speaking voters ; a poll has indicated that 75 % of them support the party . Led by Stefan Wallin , the party is resolute on preserving the mandatory teaching of Swedish in schools . The SPP also wants to preserve the current immigration laws , which were passed on the initiative of incumbent Minister of Migration Astrid Thors , a member of the SPP . 
 = = = = True Finns = = = = 
 True Finns have said that Finland should not financially support the European Financial Stability Facility that led to bailouts for Ireland and Greece . Timo Soini asked : " How come they ( the European Union ) can 't see the euro doesn 't work ? " The party manifesto said that they would support a capital gains tax increase from 28 % to 30 % and an increased tax on alcohol . The party also opposed mention of Finland 's EU membership in the constitution and want to cut social welfare for immigrants . Soini also suggested Finland should unilaterally withdraw from the European Union Emission Trading Scheme and some other international commitments and that giving up the euro was an option . While speculating about a possible ministerial portfolio he later backed down on commitments when journalists asked him if the issues would be True Finns ' demands in any possible government formation talks , citing the proposals as his personal opinion and not necessarily incorporated into a prospective government policy programme . He continued to maintain that the EU membership issue in the constitution would be a threshold for their participation in government formation talks . Helsingin Sanomat suggested that these demands could prove detrimental to a chance for True Finns to join a governing coalition . The True Finns also support the continuation of social welfare benefits . The party 's support for the benefits along with its stance on the EU bailouts was also seen as one reason for its growth in popularity at a time when the country was facing welfare cuts by the government . The True Finns ' vice @-@ chairman Vesa @-@ Matti <unk> said that " the True Finns will not participate in a coalition government with any party ready to give further loan guarantees " . This stance on the EU 's bailout was read by The Wall Street Journal as detrimental to the euro zone 's attempt to reassure bond investors that it would not face debt problems . It also said that a good showing for the True Finns could threaten Portugal 's EU @-@ sponsored bailout . 
 Incumbent Prime Minister Kiviniemi said that she was ready to work with any party in Finland . When pressed by the media she said that she would not rule out working with the True Finns pending cooperation on negotiating a government platform . The True Finns and the Green League have both confirmed that the two parties are ideologically too far from each other to sit in the same coalition . The True Finns ' main campaign issues — lowering refugee quotas and cutting foreign aid and Finland 's financial contribution to the EU — were seen as a possible hindrance to coalition talks . 
 = = = Debates = = = 
 In February the three biggest parties partook in a debate organised by the Finnish Business and Policy Forum in front of an audience consisting of people from the field of business . The National Coalition 's Katainen said that as a result of February polling there were now four prime ministerial candidates from the four largest parties . However , the True Finns ' chairman and MEP Timo Soini was excluded because the various <unk> presented at the time were different . All parties insisted that the retirement age must not be lowered from 63 . The SDP 's Urpilainen said that the party would continue with what they said was a need to cut pensions and that increasing the retirement age is a form of cutting pensions ; to support this she pointed out an earlier retirement age law of 65 years and that the age had been lowered . She also added that because of a large proportion of disabled pensioners , younger people should join the workforce quickly after graduation . Katainen and the Centre Party 's Kiviniemi said they would consider raising the retirement age to lengthen work careers . Kiviniemi said that " some of the directors of our large corporations are retiring at the age of 59 – 60 " and that , at the same time , " demands are being presented that people should work longer . " Urpilainen also said that lowering the value added tax on food was mistake , though she said that it should not be raised either . 
 The first televised prime ministerial debate was organised by the state @-@ owned broadcaster Finnish Broadcasting Company on 31 March in Tampere and included the chairpersons of the four parties leading in the opinion polls . The European sovereign debt crisis featured prominently in the debate ; the leaders of the governing coalition , Katainen and Kiviniemi , defended Finland 's participation in guaranteeing the loans to crisis @-@ ridden EU countries claiming that Finland would otherwise risk plunging into a new recession as the country is dependent on exports to other European countries . As the chairpersons of the leading opposition parties , Soini and Urpilainen denied this claim and insisted that the debt @-@ ridden countries should rather be allowed to go into their own debt restructuring . Urpilainen was not entirely against emergency measures aimed at saving these countries , but insisted that the major European banks ought to play a larger role in the guarantees . Soini continued his criticism of the euro , reiterating that no referendum was ever called on the currency union — he remained steadfast on his party 's opposition to Finland guaranteeing the loans and presented the upcoming election as a referendum on the issue . On other economic issues , Kiviniemi continued to insist that spending cuts are not necessary in the following years — a claim repudiated by the other party leaders . Urpilainen and , initially , also Katainen were willing to make cuts on military spending ; Soini , however , contested the cut but was instead ready to cut development aid and immigration @-@ related expenses . 
 On 6 April , the television station MTV3 organised a debate for all the incumbent parties represented in the parliament . On the question of Finland 's participation in NATO operations in Libya during the 2011 Libyan civil war , Soini , saying " Finland should not be taken into wars , " was accompanied by the Left Alliance 's leader Paavo Arhinmäki on disagreeing with the other party leaders ' stance on supporting Finland 's participation . All the opposition parties criticised the government 's tax policies which they claimed were aiming towards the establishment of a flat tax . On the question of energy policy , the chairpersons of the NCP , True Finns and SPP were in favour of building more nuclear energy on the grounds of achieving energy self @-@ sufficiency . Jyrki Katainen said that " we need to decide to either import nuclear energy from Russia or produce it ourselves " and Soini pointed out that the steel industry does not get along with mere wind energy , — while the leaders of the other five parties were against it , with some preferring instead to build more renewable energy infrastructure . Anni Sinnemäki of the Green League said that " not all renewable energy is expensive " and Urpilainen insisted that after the summer 2010 decisions to give licences for two nuclear plants , a halt was needed for reconsideration in any decision to further nuclear projects . Stefan Wallin of the SPP was the only party leader willing to force municipalities to take in the refugees allocated to them . 
 On 13 April , MTV3 organised another debate , which featured the same four party chairpersons as the debate by the Finnish Broadcasting Company two weeks earlier ; Katainen , Kiviniemi , Urpilainen and Soini . The party leaders reiterated their stances regarding the EU @-@ sponsored Portuguese bailout ; Katainen and Kiviniemi were in favour of it , insisting that the bailout is necessary in order to assure the stability of the European economy and thus in the interest of Finland . Urpilainen and Soini were against the bailout , with Urpilainen demanding more responsibility from banks and investors and Soini repeating his stance that the eurozone cannot possibly function properly with countries like Portugal and Greece as members . Soini also criticised the governing parties for using scare tactics in the form of threatening Finns with rising unemployment if the bailout fails to pass . On other issues , Katainen , as he had stated earlier , willing to consider raising the minimum retirement age , while Urpilainen announced that the SDP would not join any coalition that does so . Katainen was the only party leader in favour of Finland 's admission to NATO . However , even he said that the admission does not seem possible during the next four years as the majority of Finns are against NATO membership . 
 The second televised debate organised by the Finnish Broadcasting Company on 14 April was the last before the election and it included all the eight parliamentary parties . The economy was a dominant theme of the debate . Jutta Urpilainen reiterated her claim that the incumbent government was furthering the establishment of a flat tax . She also accused the government for advancing the interests of the richest percentage at the expense of the poor people . Jyrki Katainen denied the claims , but the two main governing coalition parties , the NCP and the Centre Party , were the only parties opposed to increasing welfare for the unemployed . Prime Minister Mari Kiviniemi of the Centre Party had previously been quiet on spending cuts , but when pressed on the issue by the debate 's moderator she was rather indiscreet on cutting funding for the public sector and the Defence Forces . However , she still insisted that cuts may not be necessary if the economic growth is sufficiently high in the following years . Cuts on defence spending were supported by most parties , but Timo Soini contested this by saying that national security can not depend on economic conjectures . The crisis concerning the breaches against the campaign funding laws during the previous electoral campaign in 2007 was also discussed . Kiviniemi admitted that mistakes had been made . Soini called the mishandling an example of corruption and was glad that it was exposed . Kiviniemi discreetly said to Soini that the press had written about events in Soini 's party as well . Soini 's reply to this was : " The press ? Your people are on trial ! "

 During the night between Sunday 10 and Monday 11 April animal rights activists opposing fur farming systematically sabotaged a large number of the Centre Party 's electoral billboards in Helsinki and Turku . The billboards , featuring a portrait of incumbent Prime Minister Kiviniemi , were replaced with similar @-@ looking posters featuring a blood @-@ mouthed Kiviniemi and a text that read " Do you want to close the animals in small cages ? – I do as well . " Kiviniemi was known for having received support from fur industry . In a comment to the Finnish Broadcasting Company , Secretary of the Centre Party Timo <unk> condemned the action as " a serious violation of the democratic order that would be met with harsh countermeasures " , as volunteers hoped to restore the billboards by the morning of 13 April . In an official statement , Minister of Justice <unk> Brax of the Green League condemned the acts of vandalism as both alarming and illegal and urged citizens to report all vandalism to the authorities so as to allow the parties to replace the boards and bring the culprits to justice . Other parties also joined the Centre Party 's concern that election billboards were being repeatedly vandalised , bringing unwelcome expenses especially for the smaller parties . The Centre Party lodged an official complaint against the vandalism with the police . A police investigation has been launched into the incident . 
 Some campaigning by party workers of the True Finns caused controversy over the nature of their actions . Most complaints emanated from the Helsinki region . Jussi <unk> of the Left Alliance in the Uusimaa electoral district said of their actions that " [ ever since ] I have been involved in politics for 12 years and I have never seen such excesses . " This followed an event in <unk> in <unk> where he parked his campaign trailer in a spot the True Finns said was reserved for party chairman Timo Soini . True Finns ' candidate Mika <unk> however said those involved in the spat were no longer working for his campaign and he apologised to <unk> despite maintaining his stance that the placement of the trailer was a deliberate provocation : " I do not approve of being provoked when someone tries to provoke ; " he also added that the volunteers working for the True Finns campaign come " from here and there " and it was not possible to verify everyone beforehand . He further added a claim that True Finns supporters have also been targets of aggressive behaviour . " A month ago we were not verbally abused , but now you can hear all kinds of language . " The Social Democrats ' foreign @-@ born candidate Ranbir Sodhi was allegedly confronted by True Finns supporters in the <unk> district of <unk> who were said to have told him to go back " to his own country " where he could become a politician . A week after the confrontations , however , he said that " the same guys came to <unk> to apologise . " The National Coalition Party MP <unk> <unk> also complained that during a campaign event in Kirkkonummi the True Finns handed out leaflets at the same time that claimed she favoured Swedish @-@ speaking residents in allocating local school funding . The action was due to two local members of the True Finns who are not running to become MPs . The chairman of Kirkkonummi True Finns and a candidate in the election Pekka <unk> said he confiscated the remainder of the leaflets . " I do not approve of attacking <unk> ’ s person . Election fever sometimes leads to these kinds of excesses . " This was controversial as negative campaigning is unusual in Finnish elections . In response to such actions the party secretaries of the largest political parties held a meeting to discuss certain ground rules for the rest of the campaign , however the True Finns ' Ossi <unk> could not make it . 
 = = Opinion polls = = 
 <unk> carried out monthly telephone polls on party popularity for the Finnish Broadcasting Company . Since April 2007 , the monthly sample size has varied between 2 @,@ 900 – 3 @,@ 900 with a margin of error of about ± 1 @.@ 8 % . ( Polling does not include Åland as it has its own party system . ) However , there were also other less frequent opinion polls . 
 Most notably the True Finns saw a significant rise since the last election , becoming one of the top four parties . According to <unk> , the True Finns polled 6 @.@ 4 % in January 2010 and 17 @.@ 2 % in March 2011 , while all the traditional top @-@ three parties , the National Coalition Party , the Centre Party and the Social Democrats , lost popularity .

 The election saw a substantial increase in international media coverage . Eighty foreign media representatives from a multitude of countries registered for an event at the Foreign Ministry held during the election weekend as it usually is . The journalists also got to ask questions to the representatives of the various political parties . As the results came in , the Foreign Ministry set up broadcast coverage with interpreters on hand . Notably , most journalists were interested in the True Finns and their background . The following day , the Foreign Ministry invited professor Jan Sundberg of the Department of Political and Economic Studies at the University of Helsinki to lead an analysis of the result . He was asked about the reasons for the True Finns ' performance and the commonality with other European populist movements . There was also discussion about the possible composition of a new government and how the different parties could find common ground during talks on government formation . Sundberg said he believed an agreement could be found within the following few weeks .

 At the end of the advance voting period , the total number of votes was 1 @,@ 249 @,@ 198 , or 31 @.@ 2 % of the electorate , with more women voting . In the previous election , 29 @.@ 2 % voted in advance . Significantly , President Tarja Halonen voted during advance voting . However , there were some problems with expatriate voting as the embassy in Germany ran out of ballots on 9 April forcing an extension to 11 April . The expatriate vote was considerably higher than in the previous election , up from 8 @.@ 6 % in 2007 to 15 % . The Foreign Ministry said that out of a total of 228 @,@ 000 expatriates eligible to vote 35 @,@ 049 cast their ballots at the Finnish diplomatic missions , which was up from 27 @,@ 399 . 
 Advance voting took place in 901 polling stations in the country . Expatriate voting took place between 6 and 9 April at 241 polling stations at embassies and consulates . One national electronic voter list was used for early voting ; though for the 17 April poll , voters could only vote at their designated local polling station . The expatriate voter turnout in 91 countries rose by 2 @.@ 2 % to a record @-@ high 10 @.@ 7 % , with 35 @,@ 000 people casting their votes . In addition , 400 Finns voted on ships at sea . 
 However , despite the large advance voting , the race was not considered to have ended because the undecided voters , whose impact was termed crucial , were still being targeted during the remaining few days . As parties and candidate issues were already known by most of the electorate , the remaining days were seen as important over " image and force of personality " . Jan Sundberg said that " the more crisis [ sic ] out in the world , the better for the parties in opposition . "

 The National Coalition Party 's leader Jyrki Katainen said of potential government formation talks that " this is a challenging time but it is the politicians ' job to solve problems " , adding that " we will be fine . " Alexander Stubb , the biggest individual winner of the party , said that " it will be very difficult to keep a party with 39 seats out of government . " If able to find compromises , he believed the NCP can have the True Finns in the government . He also played down external fears of a government with the True Finns saying that " we Finns are very pragmatic and responsible . " He also claimed that " 80 % of Finns voted in favour of Europe and in favour of bail @-@ outs . " 
 Despite the loss of votes the SPP retained their number of seats in parliament . Party chairman Stefan Wallin described the election result as " interesting . " 
 Supranational bodies 
 EU – An unnamed representative of the European Union said that the result " would not affect the bailout for Portugal . " A spokesman said that : " There are no changes in plans . Negotiations are underway with Portugal . We 're certainly not going to interfere with talks in Finland to form a new government . We 're fully confident that member states will honour their commitments . "

 Portugal – Former President Mario Soares wrote that Finland had become an " ultra @-@ conservative " country . He also recalled his positive memories of the former Finnish Prime Minister Kalevi <unk> and , in comparison , called those politicians that now wish to rule Finland " midgets , " who he claimed are hostile toward Portugal . 
 Sweden – Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt congratulated Jyrki Katainen and called the National Coalition Party a sister party of the Swedish Moderate Party . However , Foreign Minister Carl Bildt was concerned that Finland might " turn its back " on both the Nordic countries and Europe , in referring to the True Finns ' electoral <unk> Åkesson of the Sweden Democrats , coming off a surprising electoral result himself , called the result delightful and that his party has such common themes with the True Finns as criticism of the EU and immigration . 
 UK – Nigel Farage of the United Kingdom Independence Party ( UKIP ) congratulated Timo Soini saying that he had proven the power of the eurosceptic movement ( UKIP and the True Finns were both members of the Europe of Freedom and Democracy group in the European Parliament at the moment ) .

 The euro fell against the US dollar for the two trading days preceding the vote on speculation that a win for the True Finns would hinder the prospects for the Portuguese bailout . Questions were raised whether the fall of the US dollar to a one @-@ year low could be stemmed . The questions were partially answered on the last trading day before the election , when the dollar rose on concern for a shake @-@ up for European confidence as a result of the election which caused <unk> traders to cover their open positions . The strong showing by the True Finns and the Social Democrats caused EU leaders to worry that they may not be able to count on Finland 's future support for any such bailout measure . Concerns for the euro grew in the run @-@ up to the election and caused worry after the result . Eurozone stock markets were also upset and could be further upset as the bailout talks , expected to be concluded in mid @-@ May , were affected . While there was no expectation that the bailout wound be derailed , " caution " was said to be the " watchword . " The London Stock Exchange also considered the result a possible obstruction to the bailout . 
 = = = = Media = = = = 
 Helsingin Sanomat called the result " shocking " and " exceptional , " as well terming the result a " protest vote . " In an editorial on the day after the election , the newspaper wrote that , as the biggest winner of the election , the True Finns have both the right and the responsibility to go into a coalition government . However , it was uncertain on whether the party can reach a compromise with the National Coalition Party . 
 The international media also interpreted the result as a new government that could cause hurdles to the Portuguese bailout . The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal wrote that the result of the election might complicate the realisation of the Portuguese bailout . The BBC described the result as " a tremor [ that ] hit the EU . " An article in The Guardian pointed out that : 
 These electoral successes tap into the the [ sic ] complex politics of these countries . Viewed from afar , they are all open , successful , externally orientated . Seen from inside , they address a fear that things are not as they were , that a combination of immigration and membership of the European Union poses a challenge to the traditions of the Nordic way of life . In some way the fact that Finland has joined the EU demonstrates that the country is no longer just the small , poor , well @-@ behaved neighbour of the Nordic block . 
 It gave two reasons for the populist surge across Europe : The " movements tap into a deep discontent with the mainstream parties in Europe 's political systems . Every funding scandal , every politician found to be corrupt , adds more wind to these parties ' sails . The European Union , lacking decisive leadership in times of financial difficulty , is an ideal further focus for this ire ; " and that populist appeals rely on having " an enemy to hand . This enemy is anyone coming from the outside – immigrants . Anti @-@ immigrant rhetoric is the only thing in common between the politics of these parties . More mainstream politicians such as David Cameron or Angela Merkel then start to adopt this rhetoric . Add to this the hurt inflicted on Europe 's populations due to the financial crisis and stagnant growth , and populists have ready material with which to work . " It postulated that a solution could lie with a " traditional approach " , which the UK @-@ based paper said was most effectively implemented by the group Hope Not Hate , though it only solved a part of the problem in " exposing the extremes of the populist parties " . It added that more mainstream parties on both sides of the political spectrum need to change as well by ensuring high standards of propriety and ethics and by articulating what it termed " positive and optimistic economic and political solutions " rather than what it said was populist rhetoric .

 Risto <unk> , an election analyst for the Finnish Broadcasting Company , predicted " the toughest negotiations on government formation since the 1970s " , as the three biggest parties have differing stances on many issues . Some analysts said that government formation talks could take weeks or even months due to disparities on such issues as the eurozone bail @-@ outs , taxation , pension reform , foreign aid and immigration . Pasi <unk> , a political scientist at the University of Helsinki , made a comparison between similar EU referendums in Denmark and Ireland ( following which a similar referendum passed the measure , though it was in turn followed by a similar proposed measure ) where the smaller EU member states wielded immense influence ; though he said that such controversial matters usually work out in the end .

 As the leader of the NCP , the largest party in parliament , Jyrki Katainen was tasked with forming a new coalition government . He said that the result of the election supported a coalition consisting of the three largest parties , i.e. the National Coalition , the Social Democratic Party and the True Finns . The most problematic question was believed to be the EU bailout policy , where the True Finns most differ from the other parties . Formal negotiations on government formation started after 24 April and the Kiviniemi government submitted its resignation on 29 April , starting to serve as a caretaker government until a new one was formed . 
 On 12 May , the True Finns announced that they would withdraw from the government formation negotiations due to the bailout issue . Soini said he would remain true to the True Finns ' campaign promises and not compromise the party 's core principles . After Soini 's announcement , Jyrki Katainen invited the SDP , Green League , SPP and Christian Democrats to negotiate on forming a coalition led by the NCP . On 18 May , Katainen announced that he would invite the Left Alliance to negotiate as well , beginning on 20 May . The Left Alliance 's participation had been demanded by the Social Democrats . 
 On 17 June , the six parties came to an agreement on forming a coalition government . The Katainen government will have 19 ministers with the portfolios divided with the NCP and the SDP both having six ministers , while the Left Alliance , the Greens and the SPP would each have two ministers and the Christian Democrats would have one . The NCP , SDP , SPP and the Christian Democrats announced their candidates for minister positions on 18 June , while the Left Alliance — with some of its notable members opposing joining the government — confirmed its participation in the government and its candidates for <unk> portfolios on its party council on 19 June . The Green League announced its ministers on 20 June . On 22 June , the parliament elected Katainen as prime minister by a vote of 118 – 72 ; two Left Alliance MPs voted against Katainen , for which they were formally reprimanded by the Left Alliance parliamentary group . President Tarja Halonen then formally inaugurated the government at the government palace in Helsinki the same afternoon . 
 = Battle of Kemp 's Landing = 
 The Battle of Kemp 's Landing , also known as the Skirmish of Kempsville , was a skirmish in the American Revolutionary War that occurred on November 15 , 1775 . Militia companies from Princess Anne County in the Province of Virginia assembled at Kemp 's Landing to counter British troops under the command of Virginia 's last colonial governor , John Murray , Lord Dunmore , that had landed at nearby Great Bridge . Dunmore was investigating rumors of Patriot troop arrivals from North Carolina that turned out to be false ; he instead moved against the Princess Anne militia , defeating their attempt at an ambush and routing them . 
 Dunmore followed up the victory with a reading of his proclamation declaring martial law and promising freedom to slaves belonging to Patriot owners if they served in the British military . This increased opposition to his activities , and he was eventually forced to leave Virginia . 
 = = Background = = 
 Tensions in the British Colony of Virginia were raised in April 1775 at roughly the same time that the hostilities of the American Revolutionary War broke out in the Province of Massachusetts Bay with the Battles of Lexington and Concord . Rebellious Whigs in control of the provincial assembly had begun recruiting troops by March 1775 , leading to a struggle for control of the colony 's military supplies . Under orders from John Murray , 4th Earl of Dunmore , the royal governor of Virginia , British troops removed gunpowder from the colonial storehouse in Williamsburg , alarming the Whigs that dominated the colonial legislature . Although the incident was resolved without violence , Dunmore , fearing for his personal safety , left Williamsburg in June 1775 and placed his family on board a Royal Navy ship . He then assembled a small British fleet at Norfolk , a port town whose merchants had significant Loyalist ( Tory ) tendencies . The threat posed by this fleet may have played a role in minimizing Whig activity in the town . 
 Incidents continued between Whigs on one side and Tories on the other until October , when Dunmore had acquired enough military support to begin operations , and the rebellious Whigs had accumulated a significant body of men at Williamsburg . General Thomas Gage , the British commander @-@ in @-@ chief for North America , had ordered small detachments of the 14th Regiment of Foot to Virginia in response to pleas by Dunmore for military help . These troops began raiding surrounding counties for rebel military supplies on October 12 . This activity continued through the end of October , when a small British ship ran aground and was captured by Whigs during a skirmish near Hampton . Navy boats sent to punish the townspeople were repulsed by Continental Army troops and militia in a skirmish that resulted in the killing and capture of several sailors . Dunmore reacted to this event by writing a proclamation on November 7 in which he declared martial law , and offered to emancipate Whig @-@ held slaves in Virginia willing to serve in the British Army . Although he did not immediately publicize the proclamation , Dunmore was able to recruit enough slaves to form the Ethiopian Regiment , as well as raising a company of Tories he called the Queen 's Own Loyal Virginia Regiment . These local forces supplemented the two companies of the 14th Foot that were the sole British military presence in the colony . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 Virginia 's Committee of Safety began organizing troops at Williamsburg to send to Norfolk in response to Dunmore 's actions . The forces raised , led by Continental Army Colonel William Woodford , did not leave Williamsburg until November 7 due to shortages of equipment and supplies . They were prevented from crossing the James River for a week by British ships sent by Dunmore to patrol the river . Dunmore , who was operating from a Royal Navy ship , landed " 109 Rank and file , with 22 <unk> from Norfolk " near Great Bridge on November 14 , to investigate rumors that Patriot militia had arrived in the area from North Carolina . His landing prompted the militia of Princess Anne County to be called out . About 170 men responded to the militia call issued by Joseph Hutchings , the local militia commander , and Anthony Lawson , a prominent local landowner . They mustered at Kemp 's Landing , about 10 miles ( 16 km ) from Great Bridge , and set up an ambush along the road to Great Bridge . 
 Dunmore 's search of the Great Bridge area the next day confirmed that the rumors were false , but heard of the militia mustering at Kemp 's Landing . Leaving a company of troops to defend the causeway to the bridge and begin construction of defenses , he took 100 regulars and 20 Loyalists toward Kemp 's Landing . 
 = = Skirmish = = 
 The Patriot ambush was spoiled when Hutchings ' inexperienced militiamen opened fire too early . Dunmore 's disciplined regulars returned fire , moving through the woods to flush out the rebels . The militia scattered , and in the ensuing chase , Hutchings was captured by one of his former slaves . Lawson was able to escape the battle , but was captured a few days later . In total , 18 Patriots were captured and seven were killed ; one British soldier suffered a single minor wound . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 After securing the town , Dunmore raised the British standard , and read out the text of his proclamation . The next day more than 100 militiamen that had previously opposed him swore an oath to the Crown , claiming that they had been forced into arms by the Patriots . Dunmore then moved on to Norfolk , where he again raised the standard , and began developing defenses in and around the town . 
 Woodford 's force eventually reached Great Bridge , and was joined by companies from North Carolina . This threat prompted Dunmore to order an attack against them ; in the December 9 Battle of Great Bridge Woodford won a decisive victory . Dunmore afterward withdrew from Norfolk , which was then burned on January 1 , 1776 , by a combination of Patriot and Loyalist action . He continued raiding operations against Virginia coastal communities until August 1776 , when he departed for New York City . 
 Kemp 's Landing incorporated in 1778 as Kempsville , and became the county seat for Princess Anne County . Princess Anne County was merged into Virginia Beach in 1963 ; Kempsville is now an urban neighborhood of the city . 
 = 30 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 50 gun = 
 The 30 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 50 gun was a heavy German gun mounted on 16 of the 26 German capital ships built shortly before World War I. Designed in 1908 , it fired a shell slightly greater than 12 inches in diameter and entered service in 1911 when the four Helgoland @-@ class battleships carrying it were commissioned into the High Seas Fleet . 
 It was also fitted on the four subsequent Helgoland class five Kaisers , four König @-@ class battleships , and three Derfflinger @-@ class battlecruisers . The guns were used to great effect at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916 , when the two Derfflinger @-@ class ships , Derfflinger and Lützow , used them to destroy the British battlecruisers Queen Mary and Invincible . The gun was eventually superseded in German naval use by the much larger and more powerful 38 cm SK L / 45 . 
 Before World War I , 30 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 50 guns were emplaced on the islands of Helgoland and Wangerooge to defend Germany 's North Sea coast . One battery was emplaced during the war to defend the port of Zeebrugge in Occupied Flanders . The guns on Helgoland were destroyed by the victorious Allies at the end of the war , but the battery at Wangerooge survived intact . Three of its guns were transferred to Helgoland after the island was <unk> in 1935 . During the Second World War , the other three guns were transferred to France and employed in coastal defense positions along the English Channel . 
 = = Specifications = = 
 = = = Naval Turrets = = = 
 The 30 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 50 guns were mounted in twin gun turrets . The Helgoland @-@ class ships used six Drh LC / 1908 mountings ; these turrets had 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) -thick roofs and 300 mm ( 11 @.@ 8 in ) -thick sides . Later ship classes used improved designs . The Kaiser class carried five Drh LC / 1909 gun houses , while the subsequent König class carried five turrets of the Drh LC / 1911 type . The primary improvement for the LC / 1909 turret was an increase in armor thickness of the roof , from 100 mm to 300 mm ; side armor remained the same . The turret roofs on the LC / 1911 mounts were reduced to 110 mm ( 4 @.@ 3 in ) ; again , the sides remained at a thickness of 300 mm . Derfflinger and Lützow used four Drh LC / 1912 mountings , while their half sister Hindenburg carried an improved Drh LC / 1913 type . The LC / 1912 mounts had 110 mm @-@ thick roofs and 270 mm @-@ thick sides . The turrets on the newer Hindenburg had the thickness of their roofs increased to 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) , though the sides were the same as in the preceding LC / 1912 type . Weights for the gun houses ranged from 534 – 549 tons ( 543 – 558 metric tons ) ; the variations depended primarily on the thickness of armor . 
 In the König @-@ class ships , each gun turret had a working chamber beneath it that was connected to a revolving ammunition hoist leading down to the magazine below . The turrets were electrically controlled , though the guns were elevated hydraulically . In an effort to reduce the possibility of a fire , everything in the turret was constructed of steel . This layout was also used in the preceding battleships . On the Derfflinger @-@ class battlecruisers , the two forward and the superfiring rear turret used this configuration , although the rearmost gun turret had its magazine and shell room inverted . 
 All of the German gun turrets initially allowed for elevation to 13 @.@ 5 degrees , although after the battle of Jutland , they were modified to allow elevation to 16 degrees . The centerline turrets on the warships could train 150 degrees in either direction , though the wing turrets on the Helgoland and Kaiser classes were limited to an arc of 80 degrees in either direction . 
 = = = Coast defense mounts = = = 
 The island of Helgoland received four twin gun turrets between 1909 – 12 , although their exact type is unknown . Battery Kaiser Wilhelm II was built to protect the port of Zeebrugge in Occupied Flanders during World War I. It consisted of four guns in concrete barbettes mounted on Bettungsschiessgerüst ( BSG ) ( firing platforms ) . These manually powered mounts rotated on a pivot at the front of the mount and the rear was supported by rollers resting on a semi @-@ circular rail . They were equipped with a gun shield and capable of all @-@ around fire . They were manned by sailors from Naval Artillery Regiment ( <unk> Artillerie Regiment ) 1 . 
 By the end of World War I , six guns in BSG mounts equipped Battery Friedrich August on the island of Wangerooge . Three of these were transferred to Helgoland after 1935 when Hitler renounced the Treaty of Versailles which had demilitarized the island . By 1938 , they equipped Battery von Schröder and were manned by troops of the Second Naval Artillery Battalion ( II . Marine @-@ Artillerie @-@ Abteilung ) , later 122nd Naval Artillery Battalion ( 122 . Marine @-@ Artillerie @-@ Abteilung ) . After the French were defeated in 1940 all three guns were transferred to Le <unk> , near Boulogne @-@ sur @-@ Mer , France where they assumed their former name of Battery Friedrich August . These guns were initially in open barbettes with 360 ° traverse , but these were later rebuilt into concrete casemates with overhead <unk> that could elevate to 50 degrees and train 220 degrees in either direction . 
 = = = Ammunition = = = 
 These guns fired two types of shells during World War I : armor @-@ piercing ( AP ) L / 3 @.@ 1 and high explosive ( HE ) L / 4 types . During World War II , the guns fired a wider variety of shells , including armor @-@ piercing L / 3 @,@ 4 and L / 4 @,@ 9 types , and high explosive L / 3 @.@ 8 , L / 5 , and L / 4 @.@ 8 shells , as well as specially designed coast defense artillery projectiles . The AP and HE rounds weighed between 405 and 415 kg ( 915 lb ) , while the coastal artillery projectiles weighed only 250 kg ( 551 lb ) . 
 Shells used during World War I used an RP C / 12 main propellant charge that weighed 91 kg ( 201 lb ) and a smaller RP C / 12 fore charge that weighed 34 @.@ 5 kg ( 76 lb ) ; this gave the guns a muzzle velocity of 855 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 805 feet per second ) . Coast defense guns used RP C / 32 charges that weighed 85 @.@ 4 kg ( 188 @.@ 3 lb ) for the main charge and 41 @.@ 6 kg ( 91 @.@ 7 lb ) for the fore charge . After 1942 , these were increased to 121 @.@ 5 kg ( 268 lb ) RP C / 38 for AP shells and 143 kg ( 315 lb ) RP C / 38 for HE rounds . These shells were fired with a muzzle velocity of between 850 – 855 m / s ( 2 @,@ 789 – 2 @,@ 805 ft / s ) , but the lightweight coast defense shell had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 120 m / s ( 3 @,@ 700 ft / s ) .

At a range of 12 @,@ 800 m ( 14 @,@ 000 yd ) , the L3 armor @-@ piercing shells fired by the gun were expected to penetrate 254 mm ( 10 in ) of armor plate . At 15 @,@ 000 m ( 16 @,@ 000 yd ) the effectiveness of the shell decreased ; it was able to pierce 229 mm ( 9 in ) -thick plate .

Stefani wanted to use the word dance in a chorus , so she decided to end each line of " Hella Good " ' s chorus with the phrase " keep on dancing " . The song 's funk sound is based on songs such as Queen 's 1980 single " Another One Bites the Dust " and The Commodores ' 1977 single " Brick House " . 
 " Hella Good " is a rock song composed in the key of G minor . It is written in common time and moves at a moderately fast 115 beats per minute . The song 's beat drew several comparisons to that of Michael Jackson 's 1983 single " Billie Jean " . Its hook comes from a simple progression of power chords alternating between G and A flat , suggesting Phrygian mode . " Hella Good " follows a verse @-@ chorus form with a chorus following each of the two verses . Following the bridge , the chorus is repeated and the song closes with an outro .

 The Battle of Haman was one engagement in the larger Battle of Pusan Perimeter between United Nations ( UN ) and North Korean ( NK ) forces early in the Korean War from August 31 to September 19 , 1950 , in the vicinity of Haman County in South Korea . The engagement ended in a victory for the United Nations after large numbers of United States and Republic of Korea ( ROK ) troops repelled a strong North Korean attack on the town of Haman . 
 Operating in defense of Masan during the Battle of Masan , the US Army 's 24th Infantry Regiment was stretched along a long line on a ridge to the west of the town , at Haman . When the North Korean People 's Army 6th Division attacked the town , the US troops fought to repel their advance in a weeklong battle in which the 24th Infantry performed poorly , and other US reinforcements were brought in to assist in fighting off the attack . The battle remained bitterly deadlocked long enough for another UN force to counterattack at Inchon , forcing the North Korean Army to retreat from Masan .

 = = = Outbreak of war = = = 
 Following the June 25 , 1950 , outbreak of the Korean War after the invasion of the Republic of Korea ( South Korea ) by the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea ( North Korea ) , the United Nations voted to commit troops to the conflict in support of South Korea . The United States , as a member of the UN , committed ground forces to the Korean peninsula with the goals of repelling the North Korean invasion and preventing South Korea from collapsing . By 1950 , US forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II , five years earlier , and at the time the closest forces were the US 24th Infantry Division , headquartered in Japan . The division was understrength , and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending . Regardless , the 24th was ordered to South Korea . However , it faced numerous disadvantages . The forces were poorly equipped ; many battalions had only two companies of infantry , as opposed to the regulation three . Headquarters Company , and supporting platoon elements were much smaller than regulation stated , making them substantially less effective . Most of the soldiers of the division had no combat experience and used to the luxuries of life in occupied Japan . Only one third of the officers in the Task Force had combat experience from World War II , and only one in six enlisted soldiers had combat experience . Many of them nevertheless volunteered to join the task force . The soldiers were each equipped with only 120 rounds of ammunition and two days of C @-@ rations . 
 The 24th Infantry Division was the first US unit sent into Korea with the mission to take the initial " shock " of North Korean advances , delaying much larger North Korean units for several weeks to buy time to allow reinforcements to arrive , such as the 1st Cavalry and the 7th and 25th Infantry Divisions . Advance elements of the 24th Infantry were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on July 5 , the first encounter between American and North Korean forces . For the first month after the defeat of Task Force Smith , the 24th Infantry was repeatedly defeated and forced south by superior North Korean numbers and equipment . The regiments of the 24th Infantry were systematically pushed south in engagements around Chochiwon , Chonan , and Pyongtaek . They made a final stand in the Battle of Taejon , where they were almost completely destroyed , but their resistance kept the North Koreans from advancing until July 20 . By that time , the number of Eighth Army front @-@ line combat troops was roughly equal to number of North Korean forces attacking the region , with new UN units arriving every day . 
 = = = North Korean advance = = = 
 With Taejon captured , North Korean forces began surrounding the Pusan Perimeter from all sides in an attempt to envelop it . The 4th and 6th North Korean Infantry Divisions advanced south in a wide flanking maneuver . The two divisions attempted to penetrate the UN 's left flank , but became highly dispersed in the process . They advanced on UN positions with armor and superior numbers , repeatedly pushing back US and South Korean forces . 
 American forces were repeatedly defeated before finally halting the North Korean advance in a series of engagements in the southern section of the country . Forces of the 3rd Battalion , 29th Infantry Regiment , newly arrived in the country , were wiped out at Hadong in a coordinated ambush by North Korean forces on July 27 , opening a pass into the Pusan Perimeter . Soon after , North Korean forces took Chinju to the west , pushing back the US 19th Infantry Regiment and leaving routes to the perimeter open for more North Korean attacks . US formations were subsequently able to defeat and push back the North Koreans on the flank in the Battle of the Notch on August 2 . Suffering mounting losses , the KPA force in the west withdrew for several days to reequip and receive reinforcements . This granted both sides a reprieve to prepare for the attack on the Pusan Perimeter . 
 = = = Attack on Masan = = = 
 Eighth Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker then ordered the US 25th Infantry Division , under Major General William B. Kean , to take up defensive positions on the Pusan Perimeter southern flank west of Masan . By August 15 , the 25th Infantry Division had moved into these positions . Rough terrain west of Masan limited the choice of the positions . The mountain group west of Masan was the first readily defensible ground east of the Chinju pass . The 2 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 610 m ) mountain ridges of Sobuk @-@ san dominated the area and protected the road from Komam @-@ ni to Haman to Chindong @-@ ni , which was the only means of north – south communication west of Masan . 
 To the north , from the Masan – Chinju highway to the Nam River , there were several easily defensible positions . The best one was the high ground near Chungam @-@ ni , which controlled the important road junction connecting the Masan road with the one over the Nam River to Uiryong . It was essential for the 25th Infantry Division 's right flank connect with the left flank of the 24th Infantry Division at the confluence of the Nam and the Naktong Rivers . Therefore , the 25th Infantry Division also moved to protect the Komam @-@ ni road intersection where the Chindong @-@ ni – Haman road met the Masan – Chinju highway . 
 Meanwhile , the NK 6th Division was ordered to await reinforcements before continuing the attack . The division 's 13th , 15th and 14th regiments stretched from north to south . The first replacements arrived at Chinju on about August 12 . Approximately 2 @,@ 000 unarmed South Koreans conscripted in the Seoul area joined the division by August 15 . At Chinju , the 6th Division issued them grenades and told the recruits they would have to pick up weapons from killed and wounded soldiers on the battlefield . Another group of 2 @,@ 500 South Koreans joined the 6th Division on August 21 , bringing the division strength to approximately 8 @,@ 500 men . In the last week of August and the first week of September , 3 @,@ 000 more recruits conscripted in southwest Korea joined the division . The 6th Division used these last recruits in labor details at only later employed them as combat troops . As part of the North Korean build @-@ up in the south , the untried NK 7th Division also arrived near Masan with another 10 @,@ 000 men . The 7th Division occupied key ports to protect the 6th Division against possible amphibious landings in its rear . 
 On August 31 , 1950 , the 25th Division held a front of almost 30 miles ( 48 km ) , beginning in the north at the Namji @-@ ri bridge over the Naktong River and extending west along the hills south of the river to the Nam 's confluence with it . It then bent southwest up the south side of the Nam to where the Sobuk @-@ san mountain mass tapered down in its northern extremity to the river . There the line turned south along rising ground to Sibidang @-@ san , crossed the saddle on its south face through which passed the Chinju @-@ Masan railroad and highway , and continued southward up to Battle Mountain and on to P 'il @-@ bong . From P 'il @-@ bong the line dropped down spur ridge lines to the southern coastal road near Chindong @-@ ni . The US 35th Infantry Regiment held the northern 26 @,@ 000 yards ( 24 @,@ 000 m ) of the division line , from the Namji @-@ ri bridge to the Chinju @-@ Masan highway . The regiment was responsible for the highway . The regiment 's weakest and most vulnerable point was a 3 @-@ mile ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) gap along the Naktong River between most of F Company on the west and its 1st Platoon to the east . This platoon guarded the Namji @-@ ri cantilever steel bridge on the division extreme right at the boundary with the US 2nd Infantry Division , which was across the Naktong River . South of the highway , the US 24th Infantry Regiment held the high ground west of Haman , including Battle Mountain and P 'il @-@ bong . Colonel John L. Throckmorton 's US 5th Infantry Regimental Combat Team held the southern spur of Sobuk @-@ san to the coastal road at Chindong @-@ ni . From Chindong @-@ ni some ROK Marine Corps units continued the line to the southern coast . Kean 's 25th Division command post was at Masan , the 35th Infantry command post was on the east side of the Chirwon – Chung @-@ ni road , the 24th Infantry command post was at Haman and Colonel Throckmorton 's command post was at Chindong @-@ ni . By August 31 , the division was suffering manpower shortages , and a limited number of KATUSAs ( English @-@ speaking Korean troops ) were brought in to replenish its ranks . 
 = = Battle = = 
 In the southern part of its sector , where the US 25th Infantry Division held the UN line , the NK I Corps planned a strong attack , coordinating it with an attack against the US 2nd Infantry Division to the north . The North Korean 6th and 7th Divisions received their attack orders on August 20 . The North Korean operations order called for the NK I Corps to assault all along the line at 22 : 00 on August 31 . The 6th Division , farthest south on the right flank , was to attack through Haman , Masan , and <unk> and then capture <unk> , on the west side of the Naktong River delta 15 miles ( 24 km ) from Pusan , by September 3 . The division zone of attack was to be south of the highway from Chinju to Komam @-@ ni to Masan . The 7th Division , next in line north of the 6th Division , was to attack north of the Masan highway , wheel left to the Naktong , and wait for the 6th Division on its right and the NK 9th Division on its left to join it . Part of the 7th Division was concentrated in the Uiryong area west of the Nam River . This plan pitted the 6th Division against the US 24th Infantry Regiment and the 7th Division against the US 35th Infantry Regiment . As a part of this plan , the NK 6th Division had been engaging the 24th Infantry at Battle Mountain for several weeks prior , with no gains for either side . Kean , aware of a pending offensive and distrusting the 24th Infantry 's ability , began to compile a report on the regiment 's performance to determine how to improve its capabilities . 
 = = = North Korean attack = = = 
 In the left center of the 25th Division line , Lieutenant Colonel Paul F. Roberts ' 2nd Battalion , 24th Infantry , held the crest of the second ridge west of Haman , 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from the town . From Chungam @-@ ni , in North Korean territory , a secondary road led to Haman along the shoulders of low hills and across rice paddy ground , running east 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) south of the main Chinju – Masan road . It came through Colonel Roberts ' 2nd Battalion position in a pass 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) west of Haman . Late in the afternoon of August 31 , observers with G Company , 24th Infantry , noticed activity 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) in front of their positions . They called in two air strikes that hit this area at dusk . US artillery sent a large concentration of fire into the area , but the effect of this fire was not known . All US units on the line were alerted for a possible North Korean attack . 
 That night the North Koreans launched a coordinated offensive against the entire UN force . The NK 6th Division advanced first , hitting F Company on the north side of the pass on the Chungam @-@ ni @-@ Haman road . The ROK troops in the pass left their positions and fell back on G Company south of the pass . The North Koreans captured a 75 mm recoilless rifle in the pass and turned it on American tanks , knocking out two of them . They then overran a section of 82 mm mortars at the east end of the pass . South of the pass , at dawn , First Lieutenant Houston M. McMurray found that only 15 out of 69 men assigned to his platoon remained with him , a mix of US and ROK troops . The North Koreans attacked this position at dawn . They came through an abandoned opening in the barbed wire perimeter . Throwing grenades and spraying the area with burp gun fire , the North Koreans quickly overran the position . Numerous officers and non @-@ commissioned officers attempted to get the men back into line , but they would not follow these orders . In one instance South Korean troops killed their own company commander when he tried to stop them from escaping . 
 On the line farther to the south , North Korean T @-@ 34 tank fire hit E Company at midnight . First Lieutenant Charles Ellis , the company commander , attempted to rally his men but they crumbled under fire , retreating without orders . During the night everyone in E Company ran off the hill except Ellis and 11 men . Several E Company men fled through a mine field they had set up and were killed . North Korean fire pinned Ellis ' men down after dawn on September 1 . When three or four of the group tried to escape , North Korean machine gun fire killed them . Ellis and the remaining men stayed in their foxholes on the hill for two days , repelling several attacks in that time . Ellis was then able to withdraw south , up the mountain to the 3rd Battalion 's position . In his withdrawal , Ellis , discovering a man who had been injured earlier in a mine explosion , entered the mine field to rescue him . 
 = = = 24th Infantry collapses = = = 
 Shortly after the North Korean attack started most of the 2nd Battalion , 24th Infantry , fled its positions . One company at a time , the battalion was struck with strong attacks all along its front , and with the exception of a few dozen men in each company , each formation quickly crumbled , with most of the troops running back to Haman against the orders of their officers . The North Koreans passed through the crumbling US lines quickly and overran the 2nd Battalion command post , killing several men there and destroying much of the battalion 's equipment . With the 2nd Battalion broken , Haman was open to direct North Korean attack . As the North Koreans encircled Haman , Lieutenant Colonel Paul F. Roberts , the 2nd Battalion commander , ordered an officer to take remnants of the battalion and establish a roadblock at the south edge of the town . Although the officer directed a large group of men to accompany him , only eight did so . The 2nd Battalion was no longer an effective fighting force . Pockets of its soldiers remained in place and fought fiercely , but the majority fled upon attack , and the North Koreans were able to move around the uneven resistance . They surrounded Haman as the 2nd Battalion crumbled in disarray . 
 Regimental commander Colonel Arthur S. Champney moved the 24th Regiment command post from Haman 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) northeast to a narrow defile on a logistics road the regimental engineers had constructed to improve supply movement , called the Engineer Road . At this time , a North Korean group attacked C Battery , 159th Field Artillery Battalion , 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from Haman . Two tanks of the 88th Tank Battalion helped defend the battery until the artillerymen could pack up the howitzers and escape back through Haman and then eastward over the Engineer Road . Troops of the US 27th Infantry Regiment and the 35th Infantry Regiment were alerted to begin to reform their lines to compensate for the 2nd Battalion , 24th Infantry 's collapse . At the time commanders blamed the African American troops for being sub @-@ par soldiers , but officers later contended that poor organization of defensive positions , over @-@ extension of the already weakened battalion , and reliance on unreliable South Korean troops to plug numerous gaps in the line were the primary factors in the quick defeats of the 2nd Battalion , 24th Infantry . 
 The assault did not strike the southern part of the line held by Lieutenant Colonel John T. Corley 's 3rd Battalion , 24th Infantry , and Throckmorton 's 5th Infantry . That part of the line , however , did receive artillery and mortar fire and some diversionary light attacks . At about 02 : 00 on September 1 , men in an outpost on the right flank of Corley 's battalion watched an estimated 600 North Korean soldiers file past at a distance of 100 yards ( 91 m ) , going in the direction of Haman . Viewed during the night from the high ground of the 3rd Battalion , Haman seemed to be in flames . At dawn , men in the battalion saw an estimated 800 North Korean troops enter the town . 
 When the North Korean attack broke through the 2nd Battalion , Champney ordered the 1st Battalion , about 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) south of Haman on the Chindong @-@ ni road , to counterattack and restore the line . Roberts assembled 40 men , all he could find of the disorganized 2nd Battalion , to join in this counterattack , which got under way at 07 : 30 . Upon contact with the enemy , the 1st Battalion broke and fled to the rear . Thus , shortly after daylight the scattered and disorganized men of the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 24th Infantry had fled to the high ground 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) east of Haman . The better part of two regiments of the NK 6th Division poured into and through the Haman gap , now that they were holding the town . 
 = = = North Korean breakthrough = = = 
 Kean saw the North Korean breakthrough at Haman as a serious threat to his division 's line . At dawn on September 1 , Kean requested permission from Walker to commit the entire 27th Infantry Regiment , just arrived at Masan the previous evening and still held in Eighth Army reserve . Walker denied this request , but did release one battalion of the regiment to Kean 's control . 
 Kean immediately dispatched Lieutenant Colonel Gilbert J. Check 's 1st Battalion , 27th Infantry from its assembly area near Masan toward Haman , to be attached to the 24th Infantry upon arrival at the regimental command post . The 1st Platoon of the 27th Regiment 's Heavy Mortar Company ; a platoon of B Company , 89th Tank Battalion ; and A Battery , 8th Field Artillery Battalion , reinforced Check 's battalion . Check with his battalion arrived at Champney 's 24th Infantry command post 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) east of Haman at 10 : 00 . 
 The scene there was chaotic . Large numbers of vehicles loaded with soldiers were moving down the road to the rear . Many soldiers on foot were on the road . Champney tried repeatedly but in vain to get these men to stop and turn around . The few North Korean mortar shells falling occasionally in the vicinity did no damage except to cause the troops of the 24th Infantry and intermingled South Koreans to panic further and increase their speed to the rear . The road was so clogged with retreating troops that Check had to delay his counterattack . In the six hours he waited at this point , Check observed that none of the retreating troops of the 1st and 2nd Battalions , 24th Infantry , could be assembled as units . Military police tried in vain to reassemble troops , but they refused even at gunpoint . At 16 : 00 , the 2nd Battalion , 24th Infantry , assembling in the rear of the 27th Infantry , could muster only 150 to 200 men . 
 The North Koreans , in the meantime , were suffering serious logistics problems which prevented them from supplying their troops effectively with ammunition , food , and medical care . At the same time , elements of the division , including thousands of people forcibly conscripted from South Korea , were becoming increasingly hard to keep in place . The division was having difficulty strengthening its position at Haman . 
 = = = UN counterattack = = = 
 At 14 : 45 on September 1 , Kean ordered an immediate counterattack to restore the 24th Infantry positions . For 30 minutes US Air Force aircraft , including F @-@ 51 Mustangs and F @-@ 80 Shooting Stars , struck North Korean positions around Haman with bombs , napalm , rockets , and machine gun fire . They also attacked the North Korean @-@ held ridges around the town . Fifteen minutes of concentrated artillery fire followed . Fires spread in Haman . Check 's infantry attacked west at 16 : 30 , reinforced by a platoon of tanks from A Company , 79th Tank Battalion . Eight tanks , mounting infantry , spearheaded the attack into Haman , capturing the city easily , as most of the North Korean troops had abandoned it . North Koreans in force held the ridge on the west side of the town , and their machine gun fire swept every approach . North Korean fire destroyed one tank and the attacking infantry suffered heavy casualties . But Check 's battalion pressed the attack and by 18 : 25 had seized the first long ridge 500 yards west of Haman . By 20 : 00 it had secured half of the old battle position on the higher ridge beyond , 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) west of Haman . Just 200 yards ( 180 m ) short of the crest on the remainder of the ridge , the infantry dug in for the night . It had recaptured Haman and was pushing back to the 24th 's old positions . 
 All day September 2 , air strikes harassed the North Koreans and prevented them from consolidating their gains and reorganizing for further coordinated attack . Some of the planes came from the carriers USS Valley Forge and USS Philippine Sea , 200 miles ( 320 km ) away in the Yellow Sea and steaming toward the Masan battlefield . At 10 : 45 , Eighth Army messaged Kean that the 27th Infantry was to be alerted for a possible move north into the US 2nd Infantry Division sector . West of Haman the North Koreans and US troops faced each other during the night without further battle , but the North Koreans kept flares over their position . In the rear areas , North Korean mortar fire on the 24th Regiment command post caused Champney to move it still farther to the rear . 
 In the morning , under cover of a heavy ground fog , the North Koreans struck Check 's battalion in a counterattack . This began a heavy fight which lasted all morning . Air strikes using napalm incinerated many North Korean troops and helped the infantry to gain the ridge . At 12 : 00 , the 1st Battalion , 27th Infantry , secured the former positions of the 2nd Battalion , 24th Infantry , and took over the same foxholes that unit had abandoned two nights before . During September 2 , the Air Force flew 135 sorties in the 25th Infantry Division sector , reportedly destroying many North Korean units , several tanks and artillery pieces , and three villages containing ammunition dumps . 
 Early the next morning , September 3 , the North Koreans heavily attacked Check 's men in an effort to regain the ridge . Artillery , mortar , and tank fire barrages , and an air strike directed from the battalion command post , met this attack . Part of the battalion had to turn and fight toward its rear . After the attack had been repulsed hundreds of North Korean lay dead around the battalion position . A prisoner estimated that during September 2 and 3 the four North Korean battalions fighting Check 's battalion had lost 1 @,@ 000 men . 
 Check 's battalion held the ridge until dark on September 4 , then the 1st Battalion and F Company of the 2nd Battalion , 24th Infantry , which had reorganized in the rear , relieved it . The 1st Battalion , 27th Infantry moved back into a secondary defensive position at 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) east of Haman . Champney moved his command post back into Haman , placing it at the base of a hill 300 metres ( 980 ft ) west of the center of the town . 
 = = = Infiltration = = = 
 Before dawn on September 5 , a North Korean force of two companies moved against Haman again . A part of this force approached the hill at the western edge of Haman , where H Company was posted as security for the 24th Regimental command post situated at its base . Most of the H Company men left their post without firing a shot , abandoning two new machine guns . North Koreans captured the guns and opened fire on the regimental command post . A small group of North Koreans infiltrated into Haman within 100 yards ( 91 m ) of the command post , where members of the Intelligence and Reconnaissance Platoon drove them off in a grenade battle . 
 About 20 North Korean soldiers approached , undiscovered , close enough to the 1st Battalion , 24th Infantry , command post west of Haman to throw grenades and fire into it . About 45 soldiers of the battalion command group and 20 South Korean recruits were in position there at the time . The North Koreans were driven off at dawn , but Major Eugene J. Carson , battalion executive officer , then discovered that he had on the position with him only 30 men , 7 of them wounded . Looking back down the hill , Carson saw approximately 40 men get up out of the rice paddies and go over to a tank at a roadblock position . These men reported to the regiment that they had been driven off the hill . Three tanks near the command post helped clear the town of North Koreans . 
 At the time of this infiltration , a white officer and 35 – 40 African @-@ American soldiers left their position south of Haman at a roadblock and fled to the rear until they reached Check 's 1st Battalion , 27th Infantry , command post 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) away . There , at 05 : 00 this officer said 2 @,@ 000 North Koreans had overrun his position and others near Haman , including the 24th Regiment command post . Check reported this story to Kean , and then sent a platoon of tanks with a platoon of infantry toward Haman to find out what had happened . Some of his officers , meanwhile , had stopped about 220 soldiers streaming to the rear . Check ordered these men to follow his tank and infantry patrol back into Haman . Some of them did so only when threatened with being shot . The tank @-@ led column entered Haman unopposed , where they found the 24th Regiment command post intact and everything quiet . The next day , September 6 , a sniper severely wounded Champney while he was inspecting his front @-@ line positions west of Haman . Champney was evacuated immediately . The commanding officer of the 3rd Battalion , Corley , succeeded to the command of the regiment . 
 Corley instituted sweeping changes in leadership in the regiment , hoping to improve its combat performance . He was able to cut down on straggling to a degree with more strict threats of court martial , but this had a negative effect on the regiment 's morale . He began a unit newspaper , eventually called Eagle Forward , and moved to allow more discourse for the soldiers and leaders of the unit , and this was shown to improve the morale to a degree . Wanting to build a sense of pride in the unit , he sought to emphasize the toughness of the battles the regiment had seen , and played up its victory at the Battle of Yechon while downplaying other poor performances . 
 After the North Korean infiltration on September 7 was repelled , the North Korean attack on Haman ground to a halt . The North Koreans , racked by logistical and manpower shortages , focused more heavily on their attacks against 24th Infantry positions on Battle Mountain , as well as 35th Infantry positions at the Nam River . 24th Infantry troops at Haman encountered only probing attacks until September 18 . 
 = = = North Korean withdrawal = = = 
 The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and forced them back on all fronts . On 16 September , however , 25th Infantry Division was still fighting North Korean forces behind its lines , and North Korean strong points existed on the heights of Battle Mountain , P 'il @-@ bong , and Sobuk @-@ san . Kean felt that the division could advance along the roads toward Chinju only when the mountainous center of the division front was clear . He therefore believed that the key to the advance of the 25th Division lay in its center where the North Koreans held the heights and kept the 24th Infantry Regiment under daily attack . The 27th Infantry on the left and the 35th Infantry on the right , astride the roads between Chinju and Masan , held their positions and could not advance until the situation in front of the 24th Infantry improved . 
 On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned Battle Mountain during the night , and the 1st Battalion , 24th Infantry , moved up and occupied it . On the right , the 35th Infantry began moving forward . There was only light resistance until it reached the high ground in front of Chungam @-@ ni where hidden North Korean soldiers in spider holes shot at 1st Battalion soldiers from the rear . The next day the 1st Battalion captured Chungam @-@ ni , and the 2nd Battalion captured the long ridge line running northwest from it to the Nam River . Meanwhile , the North Koreans still held strongly against the division left where the 27th Infantry had heavy fighting in trying to move forward . 
 The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area the night of September 18 – 19 . The NK 7th Division withdrew from south of the Nam River while the 6th Division sideslipped elements to cover the entire front . Covered by the 6th Division , the 7th had crossed to the north side of the Nam River by the morning of September 19 . Then the NK 6th Division had withdrawn from its positions on Sobuk @-@ san . The US units rapidly pursued them north , passing over the Battle Mountain positions , which were no longer of strategic importance . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The 24th Infantry suffered 267 killed , 796 wounded , one captured and two missing during its time at the Pusan Perimeter , of which 450 were wounded and 150 were killed at Battle Mountain . The 8th Field Artillery Battalion , supporting the 24th Infantry , suffered 18 killed and 26 wounded , while the 79th Tank Battalion , also in support , suffered two killed and 20 wounded . 
 The North Korean troops suffered heavily in the fight for Masan , and most became casualties in the attack . By mid @-@ September , the NK 7th Division was reduced to just 4 @,@ 000 men , a loss of 6 @,@ 000 from when it was committed to the perimeter . Only 2 @,@ 000 from the NK 6th Division returned to North Korea , a loss of 80 percent of its strength . Up to 3 @,@ 000 troops were captured as they attempted to return to North Korea . The attacking force of over 20 @,@ 000 had been reduced to only 6 @,@ 000 by the end of the fights around Masan . It is nearly impossible , however , to calculate how many were lost in each individual engagement . 
 Desertion was a problem for the 24th Infantry ; the 25th Infantry Division had to detain 116 deserters from the 24th Infantry during August , compared to 15 from the 27th Infantry and 12 from the 35th Infantry . In late August , Kean began investigating the unit 's behavior , including its poor performance at the battle of Sangju several weeks earlier , and found its performance was affecting other units of the division . After the 24th 's performance at the battles of Battle Mountain and Haman , Kean suggested to Walker that the regiment be disbanded and its troops be used as replacements for other units in the field . Virtually all of the officers and enlisted men in the regiment were supportive of this idea , but Walker declined , feeling he could not afford to lose a regiment . Even if his other units were reinforced , he did not feel they could be extended to cover the entire line .

 = Milwaukee Avenue Historic District = 
 The Milwaukee Avenue Historic District is a historic district in Minneapolis , Minnesota in the Seward neighborhood . The district comprises two city blocks of small homes on quarter @-@ sized lots . These houses were built between 1884 and 1890 by William Ragan , a Minneapolis real estate speculator . Built for lower @-@ income residents , the houses had deteriorated in condition by the end of World War II , and by the 1970s , were planned for demolition . A group of residents and concerned citizens fought to save the houses , eventually leading to their inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places and the federal protection and rehabilitation that comes with the designation . Today , the houses sit along a <unk> and pedestrian @-@ friendly mall on which motor traffic is prohibited . 
 = = Early history = = 
 During the late 19th century , the population of Minneapolis was growing rapidly , increasing 351 percent from 1880 to 1890 . With the number of people moving into the city , lower @-@ cost housing was needed for immigrants who were new to Minnesota . The street had originally been platted as an alley between 22nd and 23rd Avenues South , but William Ragan developed it as a street and labeled it 22 ½ Avenue . The houses were situated close together on narrow lots , with very narrow side yards and no front yards . This almost gives the impression of rowhouses . Most of the houses were built with brick veneer on timber frames , and they have uniform @-@ sized roof slopes , modified flat arch windows , and open front porches . 
 The street kept its ' ½ ' until 1906 , when petitioners asked the Minneapolis City Council to change the street 's name to Woodland Avenue because they said the ' ½ ' made them feel like they lived in an alley . For an unknown reason , the street 's name was not changed to Woodland Avenue , but to Milwaukee Avenue . The Avenue 's proximity to the Milwaukee Short Line Railroad has been suggested as a cause . 
 = = Deterioration and restoration = = 
 By the time World War II was over , the houses on Milwaukee Avenue were falling into disrepair . They had been neglected throughout the Great Depression and wartime . In 1959 , the City of Minneapolis presented a plan for the Seward neighborhood , which listed the houses on Milwaukee Avenue in ' deteriorated ' condition , meaning they had no indoor plumbing or were severely battered . 
 In many other neighborhoods , the City had renewed and thus gentrified areas without public hearings , because residents of those neighborhoods were low @-@ income renters . In Milwaukee Avenue 's case , however , the residents were of medium income , and seasoned protesters , since many had protested the Vietnam War . By 1970 , the City of Minneapolis planned to raze the Milwaukee Avenue houses using funds from the Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) program . 
 The residents of Milwaukee Avenue and the surrounding Seward neighborhood formed the Seward West Project Area Committee ( PAC ) in order to try to save the Milwaukee Avenue homes . They argued that the houses had significant historic value and needed to be preserved . The City argued that the houses were legally nonconforming , and rehabilitating them would cost more than just building new houses . 
 The City furthered its plan of renewing the area and took no heed of the PAC . In response , the PAC secretly submitted an application to the National Register of Historic Places for the Milwaukee Avenue district . It was approved on May 2 , 1974 by Secretary of the Interior Rogers CB Morton . This meant that the City could not alter or destroy the houses using federal funds without a public hearing . 
 Nine of Milwaukee Avenue 's houses had to be destroyed due to their decrepit conditions and a tenth was moved elsewhere . In the spaces where these houses once stood , townhomes were built , mirroring the style of the original houses . The rest of the houses got indoor plumbing , new basements , improved woodwork and porches added on . Additionally , a pedestrian mall was built down the center of Milwaukee Avenue to replace a one @-@ way street . The Avenue is now bike and pedestrian friendly , and cars are prohibited . 
 = = Milwaukee Avenue today = = 
 Milwaukee Avenue still stands today . In 2007 , to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Milwaukee Avenue 's rehabilitation , self @-@ guided walking tours of eight of the houses were offered to the public . 
 The houses were featured on local CBS station WCCO @-@ TV 's Finding Minnesota series in 2005 . The two @-@ minute video segment about the avenue featured interviews with a resident of Milwaukee Avenue , as well as Bob Roscoe , an activist who led the fight to save Milwaukee Avenue . 
 = Free State of Galveston = 
 The Free State of Galveston ( sometimes referred to as the Republic of Galveston Island ) was a whimsical name given to the coastal city of Galveston in the U.S. state of Texas during the early @-@ to @-@ mid @-@ 20th century . Today , the term is sometimes used to describe the culture and history of that era . 
 During the Roaring Twenties , Galveston Island emerged as a popular resort town , attracting celebrities from around the country . Gambling , illegal liquor , and other vice @-@ oriented businesses were a major part of tourism . The Free State moniker embodied a belief held by many locals that Galveston was beyond what they perceived were repressive mores and laws of Texas and the United States . Two major figures of the era were the organized @-@ crime bosses Sam and Rosario Maceo , who ran the chief casinos and clubs on the island and were heavily involved in the government and the tourism industry . The success of vice on the island , despite being illegal , was enabled by lax attitudes in the society and the government , both on the island and in the county . In one of the more famous examples of this , a state committee , investigating gambling at the fabled Balinese Room , was told by the local sheriff that he had not raided the establishment because it was a " private club " and because he was not a " member " . 
 Much of this period represented a high point in Galveston 's economy . It is sometimes referred to as the " open era " or the " wide @-@ open era " because the business owners and the community made little effort to hide the illegal vice activities . The tourist industry spawned by the illegal businesses helped to offset Galveston 's decline as a commercial and shipping center following a devastating hurricane in 1900 . However , crackdowns against gambling and prostitution in Texas during the mid @-@ 20th century made these businesses increasingly difficult to sustain . By the 1950s , this era of Galveston 's history had ended . 
 = = Background = = 
 The island of Galveston , which lies on the Gulf of Mexico , held one of the first major settlements in the eastern part of what is now Texas . During the mid @-@ to @-@ late @-@ 19th century , it became the largest city in the state . Galveston was also an important national commercial center and one of the busiest seaports in the United States , as the Port of Galveston was able to capitalize on Texas ' rapid rise in the cotton trade . Though nearby Houston was emerging as an important city in its own right , Galveston was the state 's cultural and economic center at the time . Vices such as prostitution and gambling , which were common throughout Texas during the 19th century , continued to be tolerated to various degrees on the island in the early 20th century . 
 The 1900 Galveston hurricane was an unparalleled disaster . According to some estimates 6 @,@ 000 people died on the island , in addition to thousands more on the Gulf Coast and along the shores of the bay . Immediately after the hurricane , Galveston worked to revive itself as a port and an entertainment center , including the construction of tourist destinations such as the Hotel Galvez , which opened in 1911 . In the same year , the Galveston – Houston Electric Railway opened and became recognized as the fastest interurban rail system in the country . Galveston 's port was also rebuilt quickly , and by 1912 had become the second @-@ leading exporter in the nation , behind New York . Nevertheless , after the 1900 storm and another in 1915 , many avoided investing in the island . 
 Galveston had been a major port of entry for Texas and the West during the 19th century , and a new wave of immigration came through the port in the early 20th century . In contrast to the heavily German immigration of the 19th century , the new arrivals in Galveston were Greeks , Italians , Russian Jews ( part of the Galveston Movement ) , and others who came to settle in many parts of the country , including some who remained on the island itself . Of particular note are the Sicilian immigrants who formed a significant community in Galveston County , as well as the nearby city of Brazoria . 
 The opening of the Houston Ship Channel in 1915 further challenged the port city . Houston and Texas City , as well as other ports , rapidly overtook Galveston as leading ports and commercial centers ; by 1930 map makers were showing Houston as the major city on the Texas coast , instead of Galveston . Cotton shipping , which Galveston had thoroughly dominated on a worldwide level , began migrating to other ports in Texas and on the West Coast . 
 As Galveston 's traditional economy declined , Texas ' oil boom began in 1901 , with oil wells and refineries constructed throughout the state . Galveston 's direct role in this boom was minimal as investors avoided building pipelines and refineries on the island itself ( though for a time oil was shipped through the island ) . Nevertheless , wealth brought on by the boom transformed nearby Houston , Texas City , Goose Creek ( modern Baytown ) , and other communities . Houston in particular became home to a large community of wealthy businessmen and investors . Galveston became even more tourism @-@ focused as the city sought to attract these nearby nouveau riche . Still , in the first two decades after the 1900 storm , the city 's economy struggled to recover . 
 = = Prohibition and the Maceos = = 
 During the early 20th century , reform movements in the United States ( the so @-@ called Progressive movement ) made most forms of gambling illegal in most communities . Gambling continued illegally in many places , though , creating new opportunities for criminal enterprises . The 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , ratified in 1919 , outlawed the manufacture , transportation , importation , and sale of alcoholic beverages and initiated the Prohibition era . The new law was widely unpopular , and bootlegging became rampant . Galveston 's already lax social attitudes allowed this , as well as brothels and other illegal businesses , to blossom in the city . These institutions were so accepted that at one point , the city required health inspections for prostitutes to ensure the safety of their clients . 
 At the beginning of Prohibition , two main gangs divided the city : the Beach Gang led by Ollie Quinn , and the Downtown Gang led by Johnny Jack <unk> . Though the gangs largely kept to themselves , shootouts and gang @-@ related killings were not unheard of . Rum @-@ running became big business ; liquor was imported from overseas and distributed throughout the city , the state , and other parts of the country . A rum row ( a line of booze @-@ laden ships from Cuba , Jamaica , and the Bahamas ) became a fixture approximately 35 miles ( 56 km ) beyond the coastline where smaller boats fetched the goods and brought them to shore . Quinn was the leading figure in Galveston 's vice market . Quinn 's partner Dutch Voight is often referred to as the " father " of organized gambling on the island because he established organized poker games in 1910 . Quinn 's main casino , the Deluxe Club , was an island landmark . 
 It was at this time that the Maceo family became important to Galveston 's history . The family had immigrated from Palermo , Sicily , to Louisiana in 1901 . Two brothers , Rosario ( Rose ) and Salvatore ( Sam ) Maceo , trained as barbers and moved to Galveston shortly before World War I to start their business . As Prohibition took hold the brothers began to give their customers gifts of ( low @-@ quality ) wine that they were able to smuggle . As their customers became more interested in the liquor , the Maceos gradually became more serious bootleggers . They allied themselves with the Beach Gang , opened a " cold drink place " ( i.e. , speakeasy ) , and invested in the gang 's gambling operations . 
 Eventually the Maceos , with Quinn , opened the Hollywood Dinner Club , at the time the most elegant night club on the Gulf Coast . The club featured crystal chandeliers , a massive dance floor , and even air conditioning ( a new technology at the time ; the Hollywood was the first club in the nation to use it ) . Because of Sam 's smooth personality he became the face of the nightclub . Guy Lombardo performed for the club 's opening , and Sam attracted a steady stream of celebrity performers thereafter . The club even hosted one of the nation 's first remote radio broadcasts , and featured Ben Bernie 's orchestra , which was introduced by a young Walter Cronkite . The club , the first venue in the nation to offer high @-@ class gaming , dining , and entertainment under one roof , was unique at the time . 
 A crackdown by federal law enforcement led to the arrests of the leaders of the city 's gangs , which allowed the Maceo brothers to gain control of the island 's underworld . The Maceos gradually invested in numerous clubs and other entertainment ventures in the city involving gambling and bootlegging . Their other big venture , besides the Hollywood , was a club and casino called Maceo 's Grotto ( later renamed the Balinese Room ) which opened in 1929 . The Maceos soon controlled most of the gambling and liquor on the island . Their wealth and Sam 's ability to deal with influential figures allowed them to exert increasing influence over other businesses and the government of the island . They established strong relationships with respectable business leaders such as the Moodys , the <unk> , and the <unk> . The Maceos ' influence on the island lasted for nearly three decades . To compensate for the sometimes @-@ ineffectual police force and judicial system on the island , Rose organized a group of vigilantes known as the Night Riders to keep the peace . Area residents considered the island and their homes entirely safe in spite of rampant criminal activity ; the Maceos protected the citizens of the island in many ways , such as limiting how much locals were allowed to gamble at the casinos , donating heavily to local charities , and investing in community development . 
 The Maceo empire soon extended beyond Galveston and gradually expanded throughout Galveston County . Investments in oil speculation helped to diversify the Maceos ' portfolio and add to their wealth . Law enforcement sources accused them of running the narcotics trade as far north as Dallas , though some sources claim that they were not involved in narcotics at all . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Like much of the country , and particularly Texas , Galveston boomed in the 1920s . Even the Great Depression did not stop Galveston 's run of prosperity . Despite the financial ruin that faced much of the country during the Depression , not a single Galveston bank failed and unemployment was almost unheard of . Key business sectors in Galveston during the Free State era were casinos and prostitution , in addition to many legitimate businesses . During much of the period , the vice industries provided the majority of employment . Two families held particular prominence on the island during this era : the Moodys controlled the largest legitimate interests , and the Maceos controlled the largest criminal enterprises . Both families were wealthy with business empires that extended beyond the island . 
 = = = Legitimate businesses = = = 
 As the island rebuilt from the 1900 storm , legitimate business interests attempted to expand the economy by rebuilding tourism and further diversifying from shipping . Important non @-@ entertainment businesses included insurance , hotels , banks , shipping , and commercial fishing . The medical and nursing schools , as well as the hospitals of the University of Texas Medical Branch were a stable sector on the island throughout the 20th century . The Moody family built one of the largest hotel empires in the U.S. , and their American National Insurance Company ( ANICO ) was so successful that it actually grew — tremendously — during the Depression . 
 In the entertainment sector various ploys were used to attract tourists . In 1920 an annual beauty contest , named the Pageant of <unk> in 1926 , was started in Galveston by C.E. <unk> , manager of a local amusement park owned by the Maceos . The contest was part of Splash Day , the kick @-@ off of the summer tourist season each year , and became the first international beauty contest , attracting participants from England , Russia , Turkey , and many other nations until its demise in 1932 . This contest is said to have served as a model for the modern Miss America pageant and others . At its height the pageant tripled the island 's population the weekend it ran . Even after the international contest 's closing , Splash Day was revived in various forms and continued to attract tourists . Other annual events included an extravagant Mardi Gras celebration in spring . 
 Much of Galveston 's success as a tourist destination was the result of E. Sid Holliday , who became the publicity and convention director of the Galveston Chamber of Commerce in 1925 and later became its head . The Chamber helped promote the legitimate face of Galveston 's tourism and business community ( though it cooperated heavily with the criminal enterprises ) . Legitimate amusements such as a Ferris wheel and a roller coaster , in addition to the beaches and up @-@ scale shopping districts ( notably the Strand ) drew visitors , including those less interested in the city 's illegal attractions . One of the most spectacular efforts by the Chamber , though not one of the city 's greatest successes , was the Pleasure Pier ( originally known as the <unk> Harris Recreational Pier ) . This huge pier ( later converted to the Flagship Hotel ) , built in the 1940s and used by the military until the end of the war , featured restaurants , rides , and an amphitheater . 
 A significant contributor to the economy up through the 1940s was the military . Fort Crockett , the Army Air Base at Scholes Field , the Navy Section Base on Pelican Island , Camp Wallace and the blimp base at Hitchcock all helped pump money into the local economy , as did military shipments at the port and shipbuilding . The soldiers and sailors were a steady stream of customers for area businesses . 
 = = = Vice businesses = = = 
 Casinos offering illegal gambling and drinking were the largest tourist draws on the island . Though the Maceos operated the island 's biggest casinos , they generally were very tolerant of competing clubs and casinos , provided their owners understood and respected the Maceos ' authority . By the 1930s Seawall Boulevard was filled with lavish casinos ; other areas of town also had pockets of gambling . The red @-@ light district , centered on <unk> Street and kept entirely separate from the nightclubs and other entertainment venues , was so successful that the island for a time had the highest concentration of prostitutes in the world . The financial success of these vice industries attracted mobsters such as New York 's Albert Anastasia and Chicago 's Al Capone , who tried to enter Galveston 's market without success . Capone 's enforcer Frank Nitti , in fact , had been a former partner of Galveston Downtown Gang leader Jack <unk> before the Maceo era . 
 Galveston became a major port of entry for illegal liquor from Mexico and Canada , shipped through the Caribbean and distributed from the island throughout Texas and to other destinations . Galveston became the primary supplier for Houston , Dallas , Denver , St. Louis and Omaha . This traffic helped to offset the gradual loss of shipping traffic in the cotton and sulfur trade . 
 The major legitimate businesses on the island , such as banking and hotels , were able to thrive in large part because of the illegal activities . Though many of these business leaders steered clear of direct involvement in the business affairs of the Maceos and the gangs , their relationships were hardly antagonistic . Some , such as financier , hotelier , and insurance executive William Lewis Moody , Jr . , actually welcomed illegal gambling because it brought tourists who filled up his hotels . He was even known to make loans to the Maceos ' syndicate . 
 The Free State economy was not confined simply to the island but extended through much of Galveston County . Throughout the county there were substantial casino operations developed by the Fertitta , <unk> and Maceo families , including the casino districts in Kemah ( featuring the Chili Bowl and White House casinos among others ) and Dickinson ( featuring the Silver Moon and the Dickinson Social Club ) . Houstonians often humorously referred to the Galveston County line as the " Maceo @-@ Dickinson line " ( a pun referring to the Mason @-@ Dixon line ) . 
 The vice activities on the island and in the county were not unique in Texas . San Antonio had perhaps the second most infamous red @-@ light district in the early 20th century and most major cities in the state had significant vice activities at least until mid @-@ century . During the Open Era Galveston 's vice industries dominated , while most other areas of the state were at times forced to crack down on vice due to public pressure . 
 = = Culture = = 
 = = = Society = = = 
 The city 's permissive attitude was not confined to gangs , politicians and elite businessmen . The citizenry in general took pride in the traditional Galveston approach to freedom . A notable example of this occurred at a political rally where one candidate openly blasted the " hoodlums " running illegal activities . His opponent then addressed the crowd as " my fellow hoodlums " , which helped guarantee his victory in the election . Even decades later in 1993 when Vic C. Maceo , cousin of Sam and Rose , opened fire on a local who he believed owed him money , the incident was viewed by many in the community with nostalgia recalling the Free State era . 
 Though other parts of Texas and the United States sometimes tolerated prostitution , gambling and violations of liquor laws ( e.g. Dallas is said to have had 27 casinos and numerous brothels during World War II ) , these communities usually at least made a pretense of trying to enforce vice laws . In Galveston , vice was conducted openly ; according to a 1993 Texas Monthly article by author Gary Cartwright , " Galveston 's red @-@ light district may have been the only one in the country that thrived with the blessings of both city hall and the Catholic church . " 
 High society in the city regularly attracted some of the biggest names in the entertainment business , from Frank Sinatra to Phil Harris . The clubs were regularly visited by famous Houstonians such as Howard Hughes , Diamond Jim West , and Glenn McCarthy . 
 Galveston 's attitudes toward race were at times unique in the region . The strict <unk> attitudes prevalent in many parts of the U.S. were not always as stark in Galveston 's society as in some other parts of Texas . One of the most striking examples of this was the gradual establishment of biracial labor unions of waterfront workers beginning in the 19th century , although eventually this alliance fell victim to segregationist influence . Racist ideology was always an ever @-@ present factor in the city , however , as evinced by the name of the group which ran the Mardi Gras , the <unk> <unk> Kids ( KKK , the same initials as the Ku Klux Klan ) . 
 = = = Arts = = = 
 The city had numerous venues for the arts , including the State Theater ( today the Grand Opera House ) , which featured vaudeville acts in addition to motion pictures . Less formally , entertainment could be found at the Balinese Room , Hollywood Dinner Club , and other clubs featuring musical performances by major entertainers . Additionally for many years the city held free concerts on the beach by major orchestras and other performers . The entertainment venues regularly attracted some of the biggest names in the entertainment business , including Frank Sinatra , Sammy Davis Jr . , Guy Lombardo , Jack Benny , Gene Autry , Phil Silvers , Jane Russell , George Burns , Duke Ellington , and Bob Hope . 
 = = Government and law enforcement = = 
 After experimenting with a commission government following the 1900 hurricane , Galveston adopted the council @-@ manager system in the 1960 . At the beginning of Prohibition the city council originally opposed gambling and vice ; though the council members were tolerant of small @-@ scale activities which had always been a part of the city , they were more concerned about organized crime . As the Maceos reorganized vice in the city and made these businesses more respectable , the council became far more accepting of the criminal enterprises , particularly as they became linchpins of the local economy . 
 Law enforcement at the county level , and to some degree at the state level , became notoriously tolerant of the illegal activities in Galveston , in no small part because of the prosperity they generated , and the bribery and influence peddled by the Maceos . The city police very early on became entirely complicit . 
 Galveston County Sheriff Frank <unk> served from 1933 to 1957 and was known for largely disregarding the mainstream illegal activities on the island . When a state committee investigating illegal activities on the island asked the sherriff about his reluctance to raid the Balinese Room , he replied only that it was a " private club " and he was not a " member " . The county attorney and the local police commissioner were similarly complicit ( Commissioner Johnston once bragged about being on the payroll of 46 brothels ) . According to a former Texas Ranger , a local justice of the peace would readily issue search warrants for local clubs to the Rangers , but would immediately telephone the owners to warn them . 
 Law enforcement 's corrupt attitude generally was not at the expense of the people . Apart from the economic benefits provided by the Maceos , these bosses provided a high degree of protection to the island 's citizens . When serious crimes were committed the local police would sometimes contact the Maceos to have the matter dealt with . However , the island was not completely peaceful ; threats at the point of a gun were a common means for the Maceo gang to ensure control . Though the average citizen was relatively safe , gangland slayings of potential rivals did take place on occasion . 
 = = End of an era = = 
 = = = Maceos move on = = = 
 The heyday of the Free State was over by the 1940s . Because of conflicts with the United States Treasury , the Hollywood Dinner Club was shut down in the late 1930s . The local clubs found it increasingly difficult to attract major entertainment figures . Gambling had been legalized in Nevada in 1931 and this distinct advantage over Galveston , and other illegal gambling centers , gradually lured mob figures such as New York City 's Bugsy Siegel to Las Vegas . The competition created by the up @-@ and @-@ coming entertainment center in the desert substantially challenged the island on the Gulf . Still , even during its later years , the Balinese Room was able to attract the likes of Tony Bennett and Peggy Lee , among others . And as late as 1950 the annual income of the Maceo empire was reportedly $ 3 @.@ 84 million ( $ 37 @.@ 7 million in today 's terms ) . 
 By the late 1940s corruption in Texas at the state and county level was in decline , while pressure against vice across the state and across the nation was on the rise . Even San Antonio 's famed Sporting District , once one of the nation 's largest red @-@ light districts , was shut down in 1941 . As state investigations of the Maceos ' activities became more serious , Sam and Rose began plans to move their empire to Nevada . The Maceos became major investors in the Desert Inn , which was the largest and most elaborate casino resort on the Las Vegas Strip when it opened in 1950 . Moe Dalitz ( who opened the Desert Inn ) and Sam Maceo had long been allies and business partners . The Las Vegas project 's financing was largely facilitated by the Maceos and Moodys through ANICO ( which loaned millions to known mob figures ) . Sam and Rose Maceo transferred controlling interest of most of their Galveston empire to a new group dominated by the Fertitta family , with investments coming from business interests around the island . The Fertitta group never wielded the influence that the Maceos had . Sam Maceo died in 1951 and Rose in 1954 . 
 = = = Free State ends = = = 
 During the 1950s more dangerous criminal elements took advantage of Galveston 's lax law enforcement and the absence of the Maceo brothers ' influence . Non @-@ vice crime increased in the city . The New Orleans crime syndicate , headed by Carlos Marcello , ran guns to Cuba through the island . Fugitives such as suspected JFK plotter David Ferrie used Galveston as a safe haven . 
 By the 1950s gambling and prostitution were being actively repressed in most parts of Texas . In 1953 , the police commissioner , Walter L. Johnston , under pressure from local citizens groups concerned about moral decline and high rates of venereal disease , shut down the red @-@ light district . However , the mayoral victory of George Roy Clough , a supporter of regulated vice , led to the district 's being re @-@ established in 1955 . That year Galveston was labeled by national anti @-@ prostitution groups as the " worst spot in the nation as far as prostitution is concerned " . 
 Paul Hopkins won the 1956 election for sheriff and set about shutting down the island 's illegal activities once and for all . One of the first successful busts of the gambling industry was an undercover operation by Texas Ranger Clint Peoples at the Balinese Room . In 1957 State Attorney General Will Wilson and Department of Public Safety head Homer Garrison ( with help from former FBI special agent Jim Simpson ) began a massive campaign of raids that wrecked the gambling and prostitution industry on the island , along with liquor imports . Forty @-@ seven clubs , brothels , and other vice establishments were reportedly closed , and 2 @,@ 000 slot machines were destroyed . Though officials said they destroyed all of the city 's gaming equipment , some locals including R.S. Maceo , nephew of Sam and Rose , claimed that most of the equipment was shipped to Las Vegas before authorities ever discovered it . 
 = = = Aftermath = = = 
 As the vice industries crashed , so did tourism , and the rest of the Galveston economy declined with it . The economy stagnated during the 1950s , and after 1957 the Free State was effectively gone . Fort Crockett , which had been used as an Army recreation center following the war , was shut down in 1955 . Many of the island 's most important entertainment business leaders left the city and set up shop in Las Vegas . Neither the economy nor the culture of the city were the same afterward . Civic leaders made several failed attempts at new ventures , including the Oleander Bowl football tournament ( 1948 ) and the Pelican Island bridge ( 1956 ) for access to a new industrial park , which never materialized . The city 's television station , KGUL , moved to Houston in 1959 ; the telephone company headquarters and many other businesses relocated off the island as well . To make matters worse , some of the island 's attractions were destroyed by Hurricane Carla in 1961 and never rebuilt . 
 The economy continued in muted form . The Splash Day celebrations restarted , drawing tourists to the coast . Many hotels , banks , and some insurance companies remained as did the medical and nursing schools , as well as the hospitals . Efforts at historical preservation ( notably including those of George P. Mitchell ) gradually helped to re @-@ establish the island 's tourism industry , though in a very different form from the past . <unk> referenda were put forward in the 1980s regarding legalization of casinos in the city but were defeated by the voters each time , demonstrating the changes in the city since the bygone era ( though an informal poll in 2008 indicated this sentiment may be changing ) . 
 = = In popular culture = = 
 Though this era in Galveston 's history has not received a great deal of attention in popular culture , there has been some popular fiction and true crime story @-@ telling centered on the era . Some notable examples include the novels Under the Skin by James Blake , No Greater Deception : A True Texas Story by Sydney Dotson , Galveston by Suzanne Morris , and Overlords by Matt Braun , as well as the anthology Lone Star <unk> : An Anthology of Texas Crime Fiction by Bill Davis , et al . Galveston 's Balinese Room was also the subject of a 1975 song by rock band ZZ Top . 
 Galveston , The Musical ! opened in 2003 at Galveston 's Strand Theatre and in 2011 at The Hobby Center in Houston ; the musical theater production centers on the arrival of the Maceo Brothers , who created their own empire that sustained Galveston during this period of the island 's history . 
 = Carl Joachim Hambro ( philologist ) = 
 Carl Joachim Hambro ( 7 June 1914 – 19 February 1985 ) was a Norwegian novelist , journalist , essayist , translator and Romance philologist . The son of the Conservative politician C. J. Hambro , he embarked on a philological career , graduating in 1939 . During the Second World War he taught at Oslo Commerce School and the Norwegian College in Uppsala . After the war , he taught Norwegian at Sorbonne , whilst also working as Paris correspondent for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and a few Norwegian daily newspapers . 
 Born into a well @-@ read and educated family , Hambro developed a penchant for French literature , marking an incongruity to the literary taste of his parents — they had been readers of English literature in the Anglo @-@ American tradition . Making his debut in 1960 with the satirical novel De <unk> <unk> , Hambro published trilogies and other novels for the next two decades . He had a keen interest in linguistics ; in the 1969 book Ting , <unk> , tale he <unk> linguistic questions in a popular scientific way . A translator of French literature , he chaired the Norwegian Association of Literary Translators in the early 1960s . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Hambro was born in Kristiania ( now Oslo ) , capital of Norway . He was the third of four sons born to Carl Joachim Hambro ( 1885 – 1964 ) , the President of Parliament and long @-@ time leader of the Conservative Party , and his first wife , Gudrun " Dudu " Grieg ( 1881 – 1943 ) . On his date of birth , 7 June 1914 , his father , for whom he was named , made a speech at the Jubilee Exhibition commemorating the 1814 constitution in the Frogner Park . The twins Edvard and Cato were his elder brothers ; his younger brother , Johan , <unk> their father . Living in the Uranienborg neighbourhood of Western Oslo , the Hambro family belonged to the upper @-@ class society of early 20th @-@ century Norway , and was , according to the biographer Tormod Petter <unk> , intellectually engaged ; its forebears included both businesspeople and women 's rights activists , of whom many were active in politics . 
 On 15 July 1939 , Hambro married <unk> <unk> @-@ Koren ( born 1916 ) ; They had one son together . Upon his divorce from <unk> Koren , Hambro married Christine Holter ( born 1931 ) . They had two daughters , one of them Ellen Hambro , who would later become director of Norway 's Climate and Pollution Agency . Carl Joachim Hambro died on 20 February 1985 and was buried in Grefsen . 
 = = Career = = 
 Hambro finished his secondary education in 1932 when taking the examen artium at <unk> Upper Secondary School . He had attended the Latin class , together with writer Niels Christian Brøgger and future Nazi politician Kaare Martin , among others . 
 Having made study trips to London and Paris in the mid @-@ 1930s , Hambro graduated from university with a <unk> degree in 1939 . At the outbreak of war , he was employed at the Oslo Commerce School , where he lectured until 1943 . Hambro spent the latter part of the war in Uppsala , Sweden , where he taught at the Norwegian College and chaired the local Norwegian Society ( 1943 – 1944 ) . After the war he returned to Oslo , teaching at the Commerce School until 1946 . He lectured in French literature at the Norwegian Library College in two spells , during and after the war : from 1940 to 1941 and from 1945 to 1946 . For the rest of the decade he taught Norwegian at Sorbonne , France . He also worked as a correspondent for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation ( 1946 – 1948 ) , Dagbladet ( 1946 – 1948 ) , Verdens Gang ( 1948 – 1949 ) and Arbeiderbladet ( 1949 – 1951 ) . From 1951 to 1952 he was a press worker for the Research Councils in Norway and for the Norwegian delegation to the United Nations . In that decade he mainly acted as cultural counsellor at the Norwegian embassy in London . Employed in 1952 , he acted in that position for seven years , whereupon he returned to Oslo . He was assistant teacher in French at the University of Oslo from 1963 to 1965 ; in that position he bemoaned the <unk> of his students in their own mother tongue , maintaining that the Norwegian language should be used more in foreign @-@ language education . 
 In 1958 , influenced by the country of his early adulthood , Hambro released a non @-@ fiction book titled <unk> ( " France " ) . His love for France was not inherited from his parents : the elder Carl Joachim and Dudu were fervent <unk> , the former having both written and translated English @-@ language works , and the latter having been a voracious reader of Anglo @-@ American novelists from Rudyard Kipling to Aldous Huxley . 
 His debut novel , the satirical De <unk> <unk> ( " The Club of the Estranged " ) , was published in 1960 . It tells a story of some fatigued cynics in France who create a new philosophical and literary " -ism " , which gains worldwide popularity . According to <unk> Jensen , Hambro critiques " the modern human being [ which embraces ] the first philosophical system that comes to sight " . In his review for Verdens Gang , Jensen commended Hambro for his " un @-@ Norwegian " perspective , calling him a " distinct European " . The literary scholar Willy Dahl opined that the novel denotes Hambro 's declared scepticism towards " every sort of intellectual or political pigeonholing " , a scepticism that he shared with his father C. J. Hambro , whose disdain for radical and totalitarian ideologies was well known . The elder Hambro was also , according to the literary scholar Per Thomas Andersen , vital for the next literary work of the younger Hambro : he provided biographical content to a trilogy comprising the novels <unk> oss fra det <unk> ( 1963 ) , <unk> <unk> ( 1964 ) and Vi vil oss en <unk> ( 1966 ) , which delineate the adolescence of a young man named Nico <unk> in the West End of Oslo . The first of them was favourably reviewed by <unk> Jensen in Verdens Gang , who called it " a declaration of love for Oslo " ; reviewing for the same newspaper , Ragnhild Lorentzen gave the next novel a laudatory review , commending Hambro for having taken an important task upon his shoulders , whilst also criticising him for blurring the line between adolescence and adulthood . Dahl argues that these novels constitute an unpretentious , yet perspicacious criticism of the necessity of conformity in that milieu , whilst Andersen considers them to be stories about double standards and liberation from one 's father . In September 1966 Hambro delivered a vehement critique of the Norwegian education system in the pamphlet Er <unk> <unk> ? . The last novel of his trilogy about Nico <unk> was released in November of the same year ; Lorentzen considered the first part of the book to be somewhat verbose and <unk> , concluding her review by calling the novel an unoriginal yet well written book . Hambro continued with <unk> <unk> ( " The Bear Is Sleeping " ) in 1967 , a marriage novel that disappointed the critics , before releasing his semantic and psycholinguistic study Ting , <unk> , tale in 1969 . The journalist Iver Tore <unk> recognizes this work as one of the very few successful attempts at a popular scientific treatment of structural linguistics , a view supported by Dahl . Hambro 's last novels were <unk> and <unk> , released in 1971 and 1974 . The former book is about a love affair between an erstwhile cultural radical and a young woman with aggressive political opinions . The affair makes , according to Dahl , the cultural radical think about his nonconformist past , yet he abandons it , and seeks safety in the bourgeoisie class . 
 He nevertheless continued his writings , albeit in the non @-@ fiction genre : in the 1970s he penned numerous articles on political and literary topics for Norwegian newspapers and periodicals . He especially contributed to the periodicals <unk> and Samtiden . In 1972 he resumed his endeavour to popularise linguistics : together with Erik <unk> and Knut <unk> he released <unk> i <unk> ( " Language in Operation " ) , an introductory book to improve language comprehension and essay writing . <unk> later recalled that it cited philosophers and linguists hitherto unknown in Norwegian public discourse , amongst them Michel Foucault ( 1926 – 1984 ) . Hambro 's obituarist Finn Jor describes him as a man fond of debate with a keen interest in societal issues , yet who was no front person in public dialogue , not possessing the eloquence of his father . In the latter part of his life he wrote books on the Norwegian authors Jens <unk> and Arnulf Øverland . He was active in the Norwegian Authors ' Union , becoming known as " a man of compromises " after having calmed a linguistic debate in the union . 
 A renowned translator of French prose , Hambro was awarded the Bastian Prize in 1963 for his translation of Claude Simon 's The Flanders Road . He chaired the Norwegian Association of Literary Translators from 1961 to 1965 . 
 = HMS Warrior ( 1860 ) = 
 HMS Warrior was a 40 @-@ gun steam @-@ powered armoured frigate built for the Royal Navy in 1859 – 61 . She was the name ship of the Warrior @-@ class ironclads . Warrior and her sister ship HMS Black Prince were the first armour @-@ plated , iron @-@ hulled warships , and were built in response to France 's launching in 1859 of the first ocean @-@ going ironclad warship , the wooden @-@ hulled Gloire . Warrior conducted a publicity tour of Great Britain in 1863 and spent her active career with the Channel Squadron . Obsolescent following the 1871 launching of the mastless and more capable HMS Devastation , she was placed in reserve in 1875 , and was " paid off " – that is , decommissioned – in 1883 . 
 She subsequently served as a storeship and depot ship , and in 1904 was assigned to the Royal Navy 's torpedo training school . The ship was converted into an oil jetty in 1927 and remained in that role until 1979 , at which point she was donated by the Navy to the Maritime Trust for restoration . The restoration process took eight years , during which many of her features and fittings were either restored or recreated . When this was finished she returned to Portsmouth as a museum ship . Listed as part of the National Historic Fleet , Warrior has been based in Portsmouth since 1987 . 
 = = Background = = 
 The launching of the steam @-@ powered ship of the line Napoléon by France in 1850 began an arms race between France and Britain that lasted for a decade . The destruction of a wooden Ottoman fleet by a Russian fleet firing explosive shells in the Battle of Sinop , early in the Crimean War , followed by the destruction of Russian coastal fortifications during the Battle of Kinburn in the Crimean War by French armoured floating batteries , and tests against armour plates , showed the superiority of ironclads over unarmoured ships . France 's launching in 1859 of the first ocean @-@ going ironclad warship , the wooden @-@ hulled Gloire , upset the balance of power by neutralising the British investment in wooden ships of the line and started an invasion scare in Britain , as the Royal Navy lacked any ships that could counter Gloire and her two sisters . The situation was perceived to be so serious that Queen Victoria asked the Admiralty if the navy was adequate for the tasks that it would have to perform in wartime . Warrior and her sister were ordered in response . 
 The Admiralty initially specified that the ship should be capable of 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) , and have a full set of sails for world @-@ wide cruising range . Iron construction was chosen as it gave the best trade @-@ off between speed and protection ; an iron hull was lighter than a wooden one of the same size and shape , giving more capacity for guns , armour and engines .

 = = = Overview = = = 
 Chief Constructor of the Navy Isaac Watts and Chief Engineer Thomas Lloyd designed the ship . To minimise risk they copied the hull design of the large wooden frigate HMS Mersey , modifying it for iron construction and to accommodate an armoured box , or citadel , amidships along the single gun deck , which protected most of the ship 's guns . Ships with this configuration of guns and armour are classified as broadside ironclads . 
 The Warrior @-@ class design used many well @-@ proven technologies that had been used in ocean @-@ going ships for years , including her iron hull , steam engine , and screw propeller ; only her wrought @-@ iron armour was a major technological advance . Naval architect and historian David K. Brown wrote , " What made [ Warrior ] truly novel was the way in which these individual aspects were blended together , making her the biggest and most powerful warship in the world . " Being faster , better armoured and harder to hit than her rivals , she was superior to any existing naval ship . The Admiralty immediately stopped the construction of all wooden ships of the line , and ordered another eleven ironclads over the next few years . Jacky Fisher , who was the ship 's gunnery lieutenant in 1863 – 64 , later wrote that in spite of this , most people did not realise at the time what a significant change it would bring about : " It certainly was not appreciated that this , our first <unk> ship of war , would cause a fundamental change in what had been in vogue for something like a thousand years . " 
 Although built in response to Gloire , the Warriors had a very different operational concept from the French ship , which was meant to replace wooden ships of the line . The Warriors were designed by Watts as 40 @-@ gun armoured frigates and were not intended to stand in the line of battle , as the Admiralty was uncertain about their ability to withstand concentrated fire from wooden two- and three @-@ deck ships of the line . Unlike Gloire , they were planned to be fast enough to force battle on a fleeing enemy and to control the range at which a battle was fought to their own advantage . In contrast to Gloire 's square profile , Warrior has a clipper bow , but she is twice as long as a typical clipper ship . 
 HMS Warrior is 380 feet 2 inches ( 115 @.@ 9 m ) long between perpendiculars and 420 feet ( 128 @.@ 0 m ) long overall . She has a beam of 58 feet 4 inches ( 17 @.@ 8 m ) and a draught of 26 feet 9 inches ( 8 @.@ 2 m ) . The ship displaces 9 @,@ 137 long tons ( 9 @,@ 284 t ) and has a tonnage of 6 @,@ 109 tons burthen . The ship 's length made her relatively unmanoeuvrable , making it harder for her to use her strengthened stem for ramming , an ancient tactic that was coming back into use at the time . The ends of the hull are subdivided by watertight transverse bulkheads and decks into 92 compartments , and the hull has a double bottom underneath the engine and boiler rooms . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The armament of the Warrior @-@ class ships was originally intended to be forty smoothbore , muzzle @-@ loading 68 @-@ pounder guns , nineteen on each side on the main deck and one each fore and aft as chase guns on the upper deck . The 7 @.@ 9 @-@ inch ( 201 mm ) 68 @-@ pounder had a range of 3 @,@ 200 yards ( 2 @,@ 900 m ) with solid shot . During construction the armament was changed to include ten Armstrong 110 @-@ pounder guns , an early rifled breech loader ( RBL ) design , along with twenty @-@ six 68 @-@ pounders , and four RBL Armstrong 40 @-@ pounder guns with a calibre of 4 @.@ 75 inches ( 121 mm ) and a maximum range of 3 @,@ 800 yards ( 3 @,@ 500 m ) . It had been planned to replace all the 68 @-@ pounders with the innovative 110 @-@ pounder , whose 7 @-@ inch ( 178 mm ) shell could reach 4 @,@ 000 yards ( 3 @,@ 700 m ) , but poor results in armour @-@ penetration tests halted this . During the first use in action of a 110 @-@ pounder aboard HMS Euryalus in 1863 , the gun was incorrectly loaded and the vent piece was blown out of the breech when fired . They were labour @-@ intensive to load and fire , and were henceforth only used with a reduced propellant charge , which left them ineffective against ironclad ships . 
 All the guns could fire either solid shot or explosive shells . The 68 @-@ pounders could also fire hollow iron shells filled with molten iron , which was heated in a furnace between the two forward boilers . The 40 @-@ pounder Armstrong guns were replaced with a better design of the same calibre in 1863 . Warrior 's original armament was replaced during her 1864 – 67 refit with twenty @-@ four 7 @-@ inch and four 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) rifled muzzle @-@ loading ( RML ) guns . The ship also received four RBL Armstrong 20 @-@ pounders for use as saluting guns . The RML 8 @-@ inch gun could penetrate 9 @.@ 6 inches ( 244 mm ) of wrought iron armour at the muzzle , and the RML 7 @-@ inch gun could pierce 7 @.@ 7 inches ( 196 mm ) . 
 = = = Armour = = = 
 Warrior 's armour consisted of 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 114 mm ) of wrought iron backed by 18 inches ( 457 mm ) of teak . The iron armour was made up of 3 @-@ by @-@ 12 @-@ foot ( 0 @.@ 91 by 3 @.@ 66 m ) plates that interlocked via the tongue and groove method . It was bolted through the teak to the iron hull . The teak consisted of two 9 @-@ inch @-@ thick ( 229 mm ) layers laid at right angles to each other ; they strengthened the armour by damping the shock waves caused by the impact of shells that would otherwise break the bolts connecting the armour to the hull . Based on tests at Shoeburyness in October 1861 when the Warrior was launched , it " was practically invulnerable to the ordnance at the time in use " . 
 The armour covered the middle 213 feet ( 64 @.@ 9 m ) of the ship and extended 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) above the waterline and 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) below it . The guns on the main deck were protected from raking fire by 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch transverse bulkheads . The ends of the ship were unprotected , but were subdivided into watertight compartments to minimise flooding . The lack of armour at the stern meant that the steering gear and rudder were vulnerable . 
 = = = Crew = = = 
 The ship 's crew comprised 50 officers and 656 ratings in 1863 . The majority of the crew had to do physically demanding tasks ; one such duty was the raising of the heaviest manually hauled anchors in maritime history . The day @-@ to @-@ day life of her crew differed little from those on the navy 's traditional wooden @-@ hulled vessels . 
 The majority of the crew lived on the single gun deck of the Warrior ; these crewmen slept in hammocks slung from the sides and deck beams , with up to 18 men between each pair of guns . The officers berthed in the rear of the ship in small individual cabins ; the wardroom was also the officers ' mess . The captain had two spacious , well @-@ furnished cabins . 
 Of the ratings , 122 were Royal Marines . As an experiment during the ship 's first commission , all of Warrior 's marines were from Royal Marine Artillery ; subsequently some marine infantrymen were assigned as was the usual naval practice . The marines manned the aft section of guns and slung their hammocks between the crew 's accommodation and the officers ' cabins .
