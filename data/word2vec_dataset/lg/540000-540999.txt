 Following those games , the Webfoots embarked on a long trip through the Eastern United States ; they were the first college basketball team from the West Coast to do so . Nine games were set up in as many cities , with eight held on the East Coast and one in San Francisco before the team returned home . In scheduling the extended trip away from Oregon , Hobson sought to show the team " different styles of play and officiating " and help them prepare for games later in the season . As a result of the extended travel , a University of Oregon student newspaper nickname the club the " Wandering Webfoots " . The first game of the trip came in December at New York City 's Madison Square Garden against City College of New York ( CCNY ) . Oregon had a poor start to the game ; according to the Sporting News , the team was " confused by officials ' interpretation of legal and illegal screens to the moving picks set by City College of New York . " CCNY took an early 10 @-@ point lead , but Oregon cut its deficit in half by the end of the first half , and tied the game at 30 – 30 . Despite Oregon 's comeback attempt , CCNY won 38 – 36 to hand the Webfoots their first loss of the season . The trip continued on December 19 with a game at Convention Hall in Philadelphia , against local team Saint Joseph 's . Oregon won easily by a 54 – 44 margin , as Gale and Wintermute led the Webfoots with 13 points each . 
 Future stops included Chicago , Cleveland , and Detroit , among other locations . Starting with the St. Joseph 's game , the Webfoots had a streak in which they played four games in five days before Christmas Eve . On December 20 , Oregon routed Miami ( Ohio ) 74 – 38 , as Sarpola led the team with 20 points . Wintermute suffered an ankle injury during the game . The Webfoots then defeated Canisius by a 12 @-@ point margin . In the next game , against an undefeated Wayne State team , the Webfoots entered halftime tied at 22 – 22 and needed a late burst of scoring , led by Gale and Johansen , to clinch an 11 @-@ point victory . After the Miami ( Ohio ) game , Wintermute missed three of the team 's following four games . The Webfoots won without him in their next two games , but not in the game in which he returned to action against Bradley . In Peoria , Illinois , Oregon fell behind by 17 points at halftime and lost 52 – 39 , as Bradley center Dar Hutchins tallied 17 points while defended by Wintermute , who was playing through his ankle injury . Following their loss to Bradley , Oregon traveled to the Chicago Coliseum for a game against Western Illinois State Teachers College . Despite being without the services of Wintermute again , the Webfoots posted a 60 – 45 victory . Drake , the Webfoots ' opponent on December 29 in Chicago , was defeated by 11 points . The final game of the road trip , held in San Francisco on New Year 's Eve , saw the Webfoots lose to Stanford . The stretch proved profitable for the school , which made $ 4 @,@ 400 off of the East Coast games , and Dick credited the trip for giving the Webfoots exposure to different styles of play than they had been accustomed to . 
 = = = Conference play = = = 
 The Webfoots then entered play in the PCC , with four games scheduled against each of the four other teams in the conference 's Northern Division ; Oregon hosted each club twice and played two games at all opposing teams ' arenas . At the beginning of 1939 , the Webfoots began its PCC schedule with consecutive home games against Washington State on January 6 and 7 . In the first , Oregon entered halftime with a nine @-@ point advantage and prevailed by a 46 – 35 margin . They lost the second , 39 – 34 , for their only home defeat of the season ; the loss broke a 23 @-@ game winning streak at McArthur Court , the Webfoots ' arena . 
 Oregon then began a 10 @-@ game winning streak , their longest since the start of the 1937 – 38 season . Oregon State was the Webfoots ' first opponent during the streak , on January 13 ; Oregon prevailed 31 – 26 . In two higher @-@ scoring contests at Washington State on January 17 and 18 , the Webfoots claimed 56 – 44 and 57 – 31 victories , respectively . A five @-@ game road trip concluded with games in Idaho on January 20 and 21 . The contests were closer than those against Washington State , but the Webfoots won 38 – 30 in the first game and 35 – 31 in the second to improve to 6 – 1 in conference play . Oregon 's next five games were at home , beginning with a second encounter against Oregon State , on January 27 that they won by a seven @-@ point margin . Washington traveled to Oregon for games on January 31 and February 1 , and 57 – 49 and 58 – 42 victories moved the Webfoots ' winning streak to eight . They then concluded their four @-@ game season series with Idaho , winning by 17 points in each game . On February 18 , the Webfoots ' streak ended with a 50 – 31 upset loss to Oregon State , which would be their last of the season . Six days later , Oregon posted a 48 – 37 win over the Beavers at home . That game was the Webfoots ' last appearance for the 1938 – 39 regular season at McArthur Court ; it was the school 's 100th win at the arena since it was opened in 1927 . 
 With two games left in the regular season , the Webfoots held a one @-@ game lead over Washington , with a pair of contests scheduled in Seattle against the Huskies . Oregon required one victory to clinch the Northern Division championship . On March 3 , the Webfoots defeated Washington in the first game of the series 39 – 26 ; Gale led the team in scoring with 11 points , as the team won despite missing 53 of their 67 field goal attempts . Anet suffered a dislocated finger and was held out of the second game against Washington , which took place the following day . The Webfoots claimed a two @-@ point win , their fourth of the season over Washington . Of the Huskies ' five losses in 1938 – 39 , all but one was against the Webfoots . By the end of the regular season , Oregon had won the PCC North Division with a 14 – 2 conference record , and had a 24 – 5 record overall .

 By winning the PCC Northern Division , Oregon earned the right to play the winner of the Southern Division in a best @-@ of @-@ three playoff series , with the games held at McArthur Court . In addition to the PCC championship , the winner would gain a berth in the first NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament , which the National Association of Basketball Coaches would run . The series was slated to be held between March 10 – 13 , but a tie between California and Southern California for first place in the Southern Division necessitated a one @-@ game playoff . Rumors began that the PCC championship series would be postponed by one week , which would have prevented the winner from competing in the NCAA Tournament ; the event was scheduled to begin on March 20 . In response , Oregon declared that they would not play if the series was scheduled to end after March 14 . Despite the school 's claim , it agreed to a rescheduling approved by PCC member schools , in which the series was set for March 16 – 18 . Hobson declared that Oregon would accept an invitation to the NCAA Tournament , following hints that the PCC champion might be passed over for a bid in favor of a PCC team that did not receive a shortened rest between games . California won the Southern Division playoff 42 – 36 over Southern California to become the Webfoots ' opponent in the PCC championship series . Dick later noted that he considered it vital for Oregon to sweep the Golden Bears in two games , to avoid an overnight trip to San Francisco for the NCAA Tournament and secure an off day in the Webfoots ' schedule . 
 In front of a crowd that included members of the Webfoots ' 1919 conference championship team , which had won the title over California , Oregon took a one @-@ point halftime lead on a late 30 @-@ foot shot by Johansen . The team switched its defense from zone to man @-@ to @-@ man for the second half and went on an early second half run to open up a 14 @-@ point lead with 12 minutes left . The Golden Bears made multiple comeback bids as the half progressed , but the Webfoots held on to win 54 – 49 and move ahead in the series . More than half of Oregon 's points were scored by Gale and Wintermute , who had 18 and 11 respectively . The second game of the series was closely contested in the first half , but Oregon opened a 25 – 23 lead at halftime and extended their advantage to eight points before a run of three baskets by California . A stretch featuring three scores by Dick helped the Webfoots rebuild their lead later in the second half , and they clinched a two @-@ game sweep with a 53 – 47 victory . Dick and Wintermute contributed 16 points apiece . It was Oregon 's first PCC championship in 20 seasons . 
 = = = NCAA Tournament = = = 
 Oregon received an invitation to the NCAA Tournament 's West Regional , which was held on March 20 and 21 in San Francisco . First , Oregon faced Texas in the first round , in a matchup of teams considered superior to either of their potential opponents in the regional final , according to analysts . The Webfoots scored 10 of the game 's first 12 points , led by Dick and Wintermute , and held a three @-@ point halftime advantage . After Texas had closed their deficit to one point multiple times in the second half , Oregon went on a scoring run and eventually opened a 19 @-@ point lead . The Webfoots defeated Texas by a final score of 56 – 41 . Wintermute had 14 points in the game , and Dick added 13 . In the regional final against Oklahoma , a 10 – 0 run to close the first half put the Webfoots in front , 21 – 14 . Oregon took advantage of Oklahoma 's strategy of attempting to play a fast @-@ paced game and extended their lead in the second half . Dick had 14 points and Gale and Wintermute scored 11 and 10 , respectively , as Oregon advanced to the national championship game with a 55 – 37 victory . All three of the Webfoots ' leading scorers in the regional final were selected to the all @-@ Western regional squad , as determined by Kansas head coach Phog Allen . Hobson commented on his team 's NCAA Tournament opponents that " We were head and shoulders above [ both ] , but not so with Washington and California . " 
 The title game was held on March 27 in Northwestern University 's Patten Gymnasium . Oregon 's opponent was Ohio State , who had won the East Regional by winning against Wake Forest and Villanova . Oregon took advantage of the Buckeyes ' defense , which was designed to stop Gale and Wintermute , by using Gale as " a decoy " , in his words . This created an opportunity for contributions from the Webfoots ' other players , including Dick , who led both teams by scoring 15 points . On Ohio State 's offensive possessions , the Webfoots used a match @-@ up zone defense , which held the Buckeyes ' field goal percentage to 17 percent for the game ; in addition , Oregon gained a rebounding advantage . The Webfoots held a five @-@ point lead at halftime , having led by as much as seven . After Ohio State closed to within one point , Oregon pulled away in the second half to win the national championship , 46 – 33 . Afterward came what Dick termed " a two @-@ handed trophy presentation " ; during the game , Anet had broken a figure off the top of the championship trophy while attempting to gain possession of the ball by the sideline . On the team 's way back to the University of Oregon , a crowd of 2 @,@ 000 – 3 @,@ 000 people greeted the Webfoots in The Dalles , Dick 's birthplace , and presented him with what Sporting News writer Joe Gergen called " the first championship watch in NCAA Tournament history . " The train stopped in several other cities on the way to Eugene , where a parade was held for the Webfoots . 
 = = Aftermath and legacy = = 
 At the end of the season , Anet , Gale , and Wintermute were selected as All @-@ Americans . In the 1939 – 40 season , the Webfoots were unable to defend their PCC championship , finishing second behind Oregon State in the division ; the following season , all but one of the players from the championship team had graduated , and the Webfoots ended tied for third . The team did not win the Northern Division again until 1944 – 45 . Hobson left the program before the 1947 – 48 season to become Yale 's men 's basketball head coach . Gale and Wintermute later played professional basketball in the National Basketball League ; both were members of the same team , the Detroit Eagles , and Anet declined an offer to join them . Dick briefly played Amateur Athletic Union ( AAU ) basketball before embarking on a military career of over 30 years after the U.S. entered World War II . Anet and Johansen joined a Eugene , Oregon @-@ based AAU team , the Rubenstein 's Oregonians , and helped the club win a state title and reach the quarterfinals of the AAU 's national basketball tournament in 1940 . Bob Hardy and Mullen both played minor league baseball , and Mullen reached the major leagues with the Philadelphia Phillies in 1944 . 
 Hobson was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1965 , and Gale followed him into the Hall 12 years later . The entire 1938 – 39 Oregon team was enshrined in the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1984 , and Anet , Dick , Gale , Hobson , Johansen , and Wintermute were inducted as individuals . The University of Oregon Athletic Hall of Fame selected the team and Hobson as part of its inaugural class of inductees in 1992 . Dick and Gale ( 1993 ) , Wintermute ( 1994 ) , and Anet and Johansen ( 1996 ) were also inducted in later years . All five of the team 's starters have had their numbers retired by the university .

 Anyang Halla ( Hangul : <unk> <unk> ; hanja : <unk> <unk> ) is a professional ice hockey team based in Anyang in Gyeonggi @-@ do , South Korea . It is one of the founding and current members of the Asia League Ice Hockey ( AL ) . Formed in 1994 , it is the oldest professional ice hockey team , and one of only three professional teams , in South Korea . The Halla Group contributes three billion won annually to run the club . 
 At its inception the team was based out of Mok @-@ dong , Seoul and named the Mando Winia . In 1998 the team took the name of Mando 's parent company , Halla . After the collapse of the Korean Ice Hockey League in 2003 they were the only team to survive . They joined four Japanese teams to create the new Asia League Ice Hockey . In 2005 the team relocated and took the name of their new hometown as their own , playing all current home games out of the Anyang Sports Complex Arena . After two years of finishing in 5th place , they became the first non @-@ Japanese team to finish first in the regular season in 2008 – 09 . However , they failed to defeat the Nippon Paper Cranes in the semi @-@ finals . In the following season Halla again finished in first and managed to win the semi @-@ final and final series giving them their first play @-@ off series win and first Asia League Championship . The club captured their second AL title after the league cancelled the championship final due to the earthquake in Japan . Asia League announced Halla and Tohoku Free Blades as the co @-@ champions .

 The team was originally founded in 1994 by the Halla Group to help promote hockey in Korea . The Halla Group also felt that by creating an ice hockey team , it would help them to fulfill their role as a responsible corporation by providing something to the community . The team was originally named " Mando Winia " . It was so named because Mando is a subsidiary company of Halla and Winia is a brand of air conditioner sold by the company . In 1997 the team was disbanded for a short time during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis . However , the chairman of Halla Group , Chung Mong @-@ won , fought to keep the team . 
 As a member of the Korean Ice Hockey League the team won the championship five times . During this time , the team also changed their name from " Mando Winia " to " Halla Winia " . The team first looked at adding foreign players to their roster in late 2001 with other members of the Korean League . In 2003 , the team was one of the founding members of Asia League Ice Hockey . 
 = = = 2003 – present : Asia League Ice Hockey = = = 
 While the team participates primarily in the Asia League , they also play in tournaments like the All Korea Ice Hockey Championship each year . In the inaugural year of Asia League Ice Hockey , Halla played a shortened seasons of only 16 games , and failed to break .500 . In the following year they brought Esa Tikkanen , a veteran player of 20 NHL seasons , on board . He was brought on primarily to coach the players but he also played during the team 's games . Tikkanen felt that as the players played against more skilled teams their own skill level showed greater improvement . He also felt that they should play more games and that the season was too short . That year the team was also noted for showing great improvement over the first year 's effort . Halla finished the season winning 18 games out of 42 with 5 ties . Their top offensive player , Marco Poulsen , finished 5th in the overall points race , however they didn 't reach their goal that year of making the playoffs , finishing in 5th place one spot out of the playoffs . In the off @-@ season the team changed their name from Anyang Halla Winia to Anyang Halla with the expiration of the sponsorship contract . As well they hired Otakar Vejvoda to be the team 's new coach . Vejvoda was considered a legend in the Czech Extraliga both for his skill as a player and a coach . 
 In the 2005 – 06 season Halla improved on the previous year 's performance finishing in second place . The league saw a reduced season of only 38 games . Song Dong @-@ hwan was the leader in goals for the league with 31 and Patrik Martinec ranked 2nd in assists with 44 . Martinec ranked number 2 on the total points list while Song finished in fourth place . Halla also scored the most short @-@ handed goals of any team in the league with 11 . The city of Anyang won an award for being " The best Hockey Town in Asia " . The team made the play @-@ offs for the first time since the league 's formation . They received a bye in the first round and played Kokudo , the winner of the 3rd place and 6th place match @-@ up . Anyang managed to win only a single game out of the first three which were played on home ice . They were eliminated in the 4th game which was played in Kokudo 's home rink by a score of 5 – 1 . Kokudo went on to be the league champions for the second year in a row . 
 After the conclusion of the 2005 – 06 season there were some roster changes . Two of the team 's top players , Song Dong @-@ hwan and Jang Jong @-@ moon , had to report for compulsory military service . Starting goaltender , Kim Sung @-@ Bae , retired after the previous season . Even though they were missing these players they were noted for having more players with more than 10 goals and 10 assists than in the previous season . With the departure of Song offensive output dropped slightly , the team 's top offensive player finished 7th overall in goals with 21 . However Martinec won the assists race with 53 and the overall points total with 71 . The team shared top spot in the short @-@ handed goals with 2 other teams , scoring 10 over the course of the season . With a further shortened season of only 34 games the team finished in 5th place and faced the other Korean team , Kangwon Land in the quarter finals . During the regular season Kangwon won 6 of 7 meetings , and the quarter finals were no different . Kangwon swept Halla in 3 games , the final game ending in 3 – 2 with a last minute desperate bid by Halla to tie the game . 
 The next season saw the AL further reduce the amount of games played to just 30 . In the pre @-@ season Halla won the Anyang Cup , which is a pre @-@ season tournament held in Anyang . The team 's record in the regular season remained relatively the same and they finished again in 5th place . Lee Yu @-@ Won was the top offensive player with 16 goals and was tied for 4th place with 3 other players . Martinec continued to contribute many assists to the team and finished in second place with 29 , one point off first . He finished in 4th place in the overall point totals . Halla did not have another player in the top 10 . The team once again led the league in short @-@ handed goals and gave up the fewest short @-@ handed goals against along with the Oji Eagles . In the playoffs the Halla faced the Nippon Paper Cranes in the first round . During the regular season the two teams split their series , each winning 2 games . The playoffs told a different story , and Nippon swept Halla in 3 games . Halla lost each game by a single goal . Vejvoda praised Nippon 's goalie for his excellent play and commended his players for their effort . 
 Following the defeat in the post @-@ season Halla replaced Vejvoda as head coach with Shim Eui @-@ Sik . Shim had spent his entire professional career playing for Halla and during the 2007 – 2008 season he was the coach of Little Halla . As a player Shim had 30 points in 80 games . He vowed to reorganize the team and set his sights on a league championship . The team 's general manager also hired Samuel H. Kim , then an analyst for SBS Sports and previously an NHL reporter from Vancouver , as a scout for the organization . Halla moved away from the heavy Czech influence which had previously dominated the team and filled 3 of the 4 spots for foreign players on the team with players from North America . Brock Radunske , Brad Fast and Jon Awe became the first three players from North America to play for the team . They also arranged for Eric Thurston , the head coach of University of Alberta 's team , to spend the first 3 weeks of the training camp assisting the new coach and new North American players . Martinec was the only Czech player to remain on the team . In addition to the new foreigner players , Song Dong @-@ hwan and Jang Jong @-@ moon returned from military service . In the 2008 pre @-@ season Anyang Cup , Halla finished 4th out of 5 teams . The AL increased the number of regular season games for the 2008 – 09 season to 36 . In September head coach Shim was suspended for 5 games for refusal to play . The incident stemmed from a goal that was scored as the final buzzer sounded during a 21 September game against High1 . Halla entered the dressing room and refused to return to the ice . The league considered the game a forfeit . Anyang Halla finished the season in first place with a total of 76 points . Their defeat of their rivals High1 in the final game of the season marks the first time a non @-@ Japanese team had finished first place in the Asia League . Brock Radunske captured the titles for both the most goals scored with 29 and most points on the season with 57 . Martinec finished in second place for the second year in a row in the assists category with 47 . Overall the team finished with 5 players in the top 10 in the overall points tally . For the first time the team ended the season with the number one powerplay scoring 54 goals . In contrast to earlier seasons the team did not lead the league in short @-@ handed goals , ranking in the middle of the pack both in goals for and against . They were the only team not shutout during the regular season . After receiving a bye in the first round of the play @-@ offs Halla had to face the Nippon Paper Cranes in the semi @-@ final . They returned to Anyang for game 6 of the series leading 3 – 2 . They were expected to win the series but Nippon 's <unk> scored two game @-@ winning goals and the Japanese club defeated Anyang in 7 games . 
 Halla opened the 2009 – 10 season with a loss on home ice , but at the midpoint of the season they were tied for first place with the Oji Eagles . The league maintained the number of games at 36 . The first half of the season saw Halla plagued with injuries . Particularly hard hit were the team 's foreign imports . After the third game of the season Jon Awe was diagnosed with a sports hernia that required surgery and was scheduled to miss 8 – 12 weeks . On 29 November , Brad Fast received a knee injury that would sideline him for 4 – 6 months , ending his season . Brock Radunske was also on the injury list with a concussion , while Patrik Martinec was day to day with a lower @-@ body injury . Halla replaced Awe quickly with Dustin Wood , who has played in both the American Hockey League and Deutsche Eishockey Liga . Fast was replaced by Lee Don @-@ ku from <unk> University . Halla also had several other regular players injured including Kim Won @-@ jun , Kim Kyu @-@ hun , and Lee Seung @-@ yup . After 18 games Halla led the league with 94 goals . On 31 January 2010 Halla defeated the Oji Eagles in overtime by a score of 4 – 3 , clinching first place for the second year in a row . The win also set up a semi @-@ final match @-@ up against Korean rivals High1 , guaranteeing that a Korean team would appear in the final for the first time in league history . Halla won all of their series against opposing teams , except against their rival High1 . Of 18 possible points available in their six @-@ game series , Halla took only eight . They were the only team to win a series against the Nippon Paper Cranes . The team led the league in goals scored with 180 . Individually , Kim Ki @-@ sung led the team in goals scored with 22 , while Patrik Martinec again led with 40 assists and 51 points . Halla finished with five players in the top ten point list .

Anyang city won the award for Best Hockey Town for the second time for their spirit and sell @-@ out crowds . Anyang Halla defeated High1 by a score of 5 – 2 to win the semi @-@ finals three games to one , winning their first play @-@ off series and becoming the first Korean team to play for the Championship Cup . Halla faced the Cranes , who had knocked them out of the playoffs twice , in the final . The series went to the full five games and four of the games went to overtime . Brock Radunske scored two overtime winners and assisted Kim Woo @-@ Jae in scoring the overtime winner in game five , making Halla the first non @-@ Japanese team to win the Asia League Championship . Radunske was named MVP while head coach Shim was named " Coach of the Year " . After retiring as a player , Martinec signed a 1 @-@ year deal to work as an assistant coach on the team . 
 Like the previous season , Halla lost the opening game against High1 . However , they once again found themselves on top at the midpoint of the season . The team was second in the league in goals scored with 65 . Halla retained Dustin Wood who was brought in as a replacement in the previous season . On 14 November 2010 the team defended their Korea Domestic Championship title against High1 by defeating them 5 – 1 in the final game of the week @-@ long tournament . After finishing first two consecutive years , Halla finished in fourth place one point behind the Free Blades . They won their season series against all teams except the Cranes and Eagles . They also finished fifth in goals scored with 130 , one behind High1 , but allowed the second fewest goals with 94 , three behind the Eagles .

The Free Blades defeated the Cranes and Halla were set to face them on 12 March 2011 in Sendai , Japan . However , a 9 @.@ 0 magnitude earthquake struck the Sendai area about one hour after the team landed there to prepare for the games . The League immediately cancelled the three games scheduled in Sendai and on 22 March 2011 they officially cancelled the final series , award co @-@ championship titles to both Anyang Halla and Tohoku Free Blades . This decision made Halla only the second team to capture back @-@ to @-@ back championships since the league 's inception .

 As a team and organization the Halla have engaged in charitable work . In 2008 they had two charity games on 27 and 28 December . The admission fee was waved and instead fans were asked to make donations . The proceeds were donated to the poor children of Anyang city as well as the sick children 's hospital . On 19 December 2009 The Anyang Halla organization donated 20 @,@ 000 won for each goal that had been scored in the season to charity , totaling just over 2 million won . On 25 and 26 December 2010 Halla repeated their charity game series , and offered free admission to the game in exchange for donations to the sick children 's hospitals in Gyeonggi Province . After the cancellation of the final series , the team held a charity game on 22 March 2011 to raise money for the Japanese earthquake victims . Instead of raising a trophy to celebrate their championship , the team took a final photo holding signs of sympathy and encouragement for Japan . The team raised almost 20 million won in donations for Japan .

 Charles Augustus May ( 1818 – 1864 ) was an American officer of the United States Army who served in the Mexican War and other campaigns over a 25 @-@ year career . He is best known for successfully leading a cavalry charge against Mexican artillery at the Battle of Resaca de la Palma . 
 May spent most of his career in the Second Regiment of Dragoons , but also had a brief stint in the First Regiment of Dragoons . As a lieutenant , he participated in the Second Seminole War , where he was responsible for the capture of an important tribal chief . During the Mexican War , he commanded a squadron during Zachary Taylor 's expedition , and saw action in the Battles of Palo Alto , Resaca de la Palma , Monterrey , and Buena Vista . He distinguished himself in those actions and was eventually promoted to the rank of brevet colonel , with a permanent rank of major . May later served in various parts of the American frontier , including during the Bleeding Kansas crisis . 
 He resigned his commission in 1861 and took a job as a railroad executive in New York City , but died three years later . His name is included in a verse that commemorates Mexican War heroes from Maryland in the state song , " Maryland , My Maryland " . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 May was born in Washington , D.C. on August 9 , 1818 , the son of a doctor in a prominent Baltimore family . He received a civil education , but applied for a commission directly to President Andrew Jackson , who was impressed by his soldierly appearance , bearing , and skill at horsemanship . In 1836 , he entered the United States Army as a second lieutenant in the Second Regiment of Dragoons . During the Second Seminole War , May was responsible for the capture of King Philip ( Ee @-@ mat @-@ la ) , the Seminole nation 's principal chieftain . He was promoted from first lieutenant to captain on February 2 , 1841 . 
 = = = Mexican War service = = = 
 On March 8 , 1846 , after a final attempt to pressure Mexico to settle on a boundary for Texas , Secretary of War William L. Marcy ordered Brigadier General Zachary Taylor to move his army , which included May 's dragoon squadron , to the Rio Grande . Taylor 's destination was the river 's north bank , directly opposite the Mexican town of Matamoros , which stood at a natural choke @-@ point and controlled access to well @-@ traveled routes to the south . When Taylor refused to leave the region , Mexican cavalry ambushed a dragoon detachment under Captain Seth B. Thornton on April 25 , 1846 , which officially commenced hostilities . On May 8 , 1846 , the two main forces met at the Battle of Palo Alto , where May 's squadron was held in reserve and mounted an unsuccessful cavalry charge . 
 = = = = Battle of Resaca de la Palma = = = = 
 Searching for more favorable terrain , the Mexican commander led his army five miles to the south . On May 9 , 1846 , the pursuing American element met them at the Battle of Resaca de la Palma . General Taylor 's force received heavy fire from a battery of eight Mexican artillery pieces , which halted its advance . Taylor ordered Captain May to lead his unit , a squadron consisting of D and E companies of the Second Dragoons , to silence the enemy guns . May told his men to " Remember your Regiment and follow your officers ! " Today , the phrase is the unofficial motto of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment , which traces its lineage to May 's unit . 
 He led his cavalry squadron on the charge and , despite heavy casualties , secured the objective and silenced the guns before being forced to withdraw due to a lack of infantry support . The dragoons also captured one of the Mexican commanders , General Rómulo Díaz de la Vega , on the gun line . With the Mexican artillery out of action , the 8th Infantry Regiment and 5th Infantry Regiment were able to maneuver forward and eventually drove the enemy from their positions . Of approximately eighty men , the dragoons lost one lieutenant , seven privates , and twenty @-@ eight horses , with an additional ten privates wounded . Colonel David E. Twiggs , the regimental commander , commented that " After the unsurpassed , if not unequalled charge of Captain May 's squadron , the enemy was unable to fire a gun . " In his official after @-@ action report , Taylor wrote that " The charge of cavalry against the enemy 's batteries on the 9th , was gallantly led by Captain May , and had complete success . " After the battle , May received two <unk> to the rank of lieutenant colonel . 
 = = = = Battle of Monterrey = = = = 
 After Resaca de la Palma , Mexican forces were cleared from the Texan side of the Rio Grande , but additional operations were required to force Mexico to agree to the border . The Mexican commander , General Mariano Arista , withdrew his forces to Linares , with Taylor in pursuit for sixty miles before returning to Fort Brown for reinforcements . He then marched against Monterrey . The heavily fortified city had a 10 @,@ 000 @-@ man garrison under Arista 's replacement , General Pedro de Ampudia , but its supply line running south to Saltillo was vulnerable . Lacking the heavy artillery needed for a siege , Taylor planned a double envelopment , with one division executing a turning movement to cut the supply line and attack from the west and south , and his other two divisions assaulting the north side of the city . 
 May 's squadron was attached as a direct @-@ reporting unit to the newly promoted General Twiggs ' 1st Texas Division , which was to be committed to the north side of Monterrey . On September 21 , Taylor launched his attack on the city , but failed to synchronize his two forces . Poor Mexican leadership allowed the Americans to avert disaster , and after some intense urban fighting , General Ampudia offered Taylor an eight @-@ week ceasefire that was highly favorable to the Mexicans . Taylor accepted , which caused President James K. Polk , furious at the agreement , to transfer most of his forces to Winfield Scott . 
 = = = = Battle of Buena Vista = = = = 
 On February 20 , 1847 , May led a reconnaissance force that included an attached company of Texas Rangers under Major Ben McCulloch and artillery section of six @-@ pounder guns under Captain J.M. Washington . During the mission , the advanced element encountered small units of Mexican General José Vicente Miñón 's cavalry brigade and spotted a dust cloud to the south , presumably produced by a much larger force . Lieutenant Samuel Sturgis was captured during a reconnoiter before May 's force caught up with the advanced element , spotted more Mexican lancers , and took up defensive positions . After scouting parties failed to locate the main enemy force , May 's unit returned to camp to report to General Taylor . After riding 80 miles in 24 hours , the only fire encountered was from the American sentries as May 's force re @-@ entered friendly lines . 
 Three days later , on February 23 , 1847 , after having moved to better defensive terrain , General Taylor 's force was met by General Antonio López de Santa Anna 's numerically superior army just south of Saltillo for the Battle of Buena Vista . May 's squadron was reinforced with Troops A and E of the First Dragoons and a squadron of Arkansas cavalry under the command of Captain Albert Pike . The American line was thrown into jeopardy when Colonel Bowles of the Second Indiana Regiment ordered his unit to retreat for reasons unknown . With skillful artillery support from Washington 's guns , the situation was restored by the Second Illinois Regiment and rallied <unk> . At that point , Taylor arrived with May 's dragoons and the First Mississippi Rifles under Colonel Jefferson Davis , which halted General Anastasio Torrejón 's cavalry . Miñón 's brigade of 1 @,@ 500 Mexican lancers flanked the American line and assaulted the supply trains guarded by the Kentucky and Arkansas cavalry , and in the process killed former governor Colonel Archibald Yell . The dragoons counterattacked Miñón 's flank and routed the Mexican lancers . May was wounded during the action . On May 24 , 1848 , he was promoted from brevet lieutenant colonel to brevet colonel for his gallantry , backdated to the day of the battle . 
 = = = Later years = = = 
 After the Mexican War , May was posted to several different parts of the American frontier , including California , New Mexico , and Texas . He served with the First Regiment of Dragoons in the Kansas Territory during its violent abolitionist clashes . On March 3 , 1855 , he was promoted to major and exchanged positions with another officer to return to his old unit , the Second Dragoons . On October 27 , 1855 , the regiment marched to Texas , under the command of Albert Sidney Johnson . 
 May resigned his commission as a brevet colonel on April 20 , 1861 , and moved to New York City , where he served as the vice president of the Eighth Avenue Railroad . He died there on December 24 , 1864 at the age of 46 . He had a history of heart problems and poor health dating back to at least 1850 . 
 May was described variously as a courageous , sometimes reckless , and unpopular officer . Samuel Chamberlain , who served in the First Dragoons and wrote scathing descriptions of most of his contemporaries , was most critical of May . Chamberlain believed May had received unjustified praise for his actions at Resaca de la Palma and referred to him as the " Murat of America " and an " ass in the lion 's skin " . In 1861 , James Ryder Randall referred to " dashing May " alongside other Mexican War heroes from Maryland in a poem that later became the state song , " Maryland , My Maryland " . 
 = SS Edmund Fitzgerald = 
 SS Edmund Fitzgerald was an American Great Lakes freighter that sank in a Lake Superior storm on November 10 , 1975 , with the loss of the entire crew of 29 . When launched on June 7 , 1958 , she was the largest ship on North America 's Great Lakes , and she remains the largest to have sunk there . 
 For 17 years Fitzgerald carried taconite iron ore from mines near Duluth , Minnesota , to iron works in Detroit , Toledo , and other Great Lakes ports . As a " workhorse , " she set seasonal haul records six times , often breaking her own previous record . Captain Peter <unk> was known for piping music day or night over the ship 's intercom while passing through the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers ( between Lakes Huron and Erie ) , and entertaining spectators at the Soo Locks ( between Lakes Superior and Huron ) with a running commentary about the ship . Her size , record @-@ breaking performance , and " DJ captain " endeared Fitzgerald to boat watchers . 
 Carrying a full cargo of ore pellets with Captain Ernest M. McSorley in command , she embarked on her ill @-@ fated voyage from Superior , Wisconsin , near Duluth , on the afternoon of November 9 , 1975 . En route to a steel mill near Detroit , Fitzgerald joined a second freighter , SS Arthur M. Anderson . By the next day , the two ships were caught in a severe storm on Lake Superior , with near hurricane @-@ force winds and waves up to 35 feet ( 11 m ) high . Shortly after 7 : 10 p.m. , Fitzgerald suddenly sank in Canadian ( Ontario ) waters 530 feet ( 160 m ) deep , about 17 miles ( 15 nautical miles ; 27 kilometers ) from Whitefish Bay near the twin cities of Sault Ste . Marie , Michigan , and Sault Ste . Marie , Ontario — a distance Fitzgerald could have covered in just over an hour at her top speed . Although Fitzgerald had reported being in difficulty earlier , no distress signals were sent before she sank ; Captain McSorley 's last message to Anderson said , " We are holding our own . " Her crew of 29 perished , and no bodies were recovered . 
 Many books , studies , and expeditions have examined the cause of the sinking . Fitzgerald might have fallen victim to the high waves of the storm , suffered structural failure , been swamped with water entering through her cargo hatches or deck , experienced topside damage , or <unk> in a shallow part of Lake Superior . The sinking of Edmund Fitzgerald is one of the best @-@ known disasters in the history of Great Lakes shipping . Gordon Lightfoot made it the subject of his 1976 hit song " The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald " after reading an article , " The Cruelest Month " , in the November 24 , 1975 , issue of Newsweek . The sinking led to changes in Great Lakes shipping regulations and practices that included mandatory survival suits , depth finders , positioning systems , increased freeboard , and more frequent inspection of vessels .

 = = = Design and construction = = = 
 Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company of Milwaukee , Wisconsin , invested in the iron and minerals industries on a large @-@ scale basis , including the construction of Fitzgerald , which represented the first such investment by any American life insurance company . In 1957 , they contracted Great Lakes Engineering Works ( GLEW ) , of River Rouge , Michigan , to design and construct the ship " within a foot of the maximum length allowed for passage through the soon @-@ to @-@ be completed Saint Lawrence Seaway . " Fitzgerald was the first <unk> built to the maximum St. Lawrence Seaway size , which was 730 feet ( 222 @.@ 5 m ) long , 75 feet ( 22 @.@ 9 m ) wide , and with a 25 foot ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) draft . The moulded depth ( roughly speaking , the vertical height of the hull ) was 39 ft ( 12 m ) . The hold depth ( the inside height of the cargo hold ) was 33 ft 4 in ( 10 @.@ 16 m ) . GLEW laid the first keel plate on August 7 the same year . 
 With a deadweight capacity of 26 @,@ 000 long tons ( 29 @,@ 120 short tons ; 26 @,@ 417 t ) , and a 729 @-@ foot ( 222 m ) hull , Fitzgerald was the longest ship on the Great Lakes , earning her the title Queen of the Lakes until September 17 , 1959 , when the 730 @-@ foot ( 222 @.@ 5 m ) SS Murray Bay was launched . Fitzgerald 's three central cargo holds were loaded through 21 watertight hatches , each 11 by 48 feet ( 3 @.@ 4 by 14 @.@ 6 m ) of 5 ⁄ 16 @-@ inch @-@ thick ( 7 @.@ 9 mm ) steel . Originally coal @-@ fired , her boilers were converted to burn oil during the 1971 – 72 winter layup . In 1969 , the ship 's maneuverability was improved by the installation of a diesel @-@ powered bow thruster . 
 By ore freighter standards , the interior of Fitzgerald was luxurious . Her J.L. Hudson Company @-@ designed furnishings included deep pile carpeting , tiled bathrooms , drapes over the portholes , and leather swivel chairs in the guest lounge . There were two guest state rooms for passengers . Air conditioning extended to the crew quarters , which featured more amenities than usual . A large galley and fully stocked pantry supplied meals for two dining rooms . The Fitzgerald pilothouse was outfitted with " state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art nautical equipment and a beautiful map room . " 
 = = = Name and launch = = = 
 Northwestern named the ship after its president and chairman of the board , Edmund Fitzgerald . Fitzgerald 's own grandfather had himself been a lake captain , and his father owned the Milwaukee Drydock Company that built and repaired ships . More than 15 @,@ 000 people attended Fitzgerald 's christening and launch ceremony on June 7 , 1958 . But the event was plagued by misfortunes : When Elizabeth Fitzgerald , wife of Edmund Fitzgerald , tried to christen the ship by smashing a champagne bottle over the bow , it took her three attempts to break it . A delay of 36 minutes followed while the shipyard crew struggled to release the keel blocks . Upon sideways launch , the ship crashed violently into a pier . On September 22 , 1958 , Fitzgerald completed nine days of sea trials . 
 = = = Career = = = 
 Northwestern 's normal practice was to purchase ships for operation by other companies . In Fitzgerald 's case , they signed a 25 @-@ year contract with Oglebay Norton Corporation to operate the vessel . Oglebay Norton immediately designated the Fitzgerald flagship of its Columbia Transportation fleet . 
 Fitzgerald was a record @-@ setting " workhorse , " often beating her own milestones . The vessel 's record load for a single trip was 27 @,@ 402 long tons ( 30 @,@ 690 short tons ; 27 @,@ 842 t ) in 1969 . For 17 years , Fitzgerald carried taconite from Minnesota 's Iron Range mines near Duluth , Minnesota , to iron works in Detroit , Toledo , and other ports . She set seasonal haul records six different times . Her nicknames included " Fitz " , " Pride of the American Flag " , " Mighty Fitz " , " Toledo Express " , " Big Fitz " , and the " Titanic of the Great Lakes " . Loading Fitzgerald with taconite pellets took about four and a half hours while unloading took around 14 hours . A round trip between Superior , Wisconsin , and Detroit , Michigan , usually took her five days and she averaged 47 similar trips per season . The vessel 's usual route was between Superior , Wisconsin , and Toledo , Ohio , although her port of destination could vary . By November 1975 , Fitzgerald had logged an estimated 748 round trips on the Great Lakes and covered more than a million miles , " a distance roughly equivalent to 44 trips around the world . " 
 Up until a few weeks before her loss , passengers had traveled on board as company guests . Frederick Stonehouse wrote : 
 Stewards treated the guests to the entire VIP routine . The cuisine was reportedly excellent and snacks were always available in the lounge . A small but well stocked kitchenette provided the drinks . Once each trip , the captain held a candlelight dinner for the guests , complete with mess @-@ jacketed stewards and special " <unk> " punch . 
 Because of her size , appearance , string of records , and " DJ captain , " Fitzgerald became a favorite of boat watchers throughout her career . Although Captain Peter <unk> was in command of Fitzgerald on trips when cargo records were set , " he is best remembered ... for piping music day or night over the ship 's intercom system " while passing through the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers . While navigating the Soo Locks he would often come out of the pilothouse and use a bullhorn to entertain tourists with a commentary on details about Fitzgerald . 
 In 1969 , Fitzgerald received a safety award for eight years of operation without a time @-@ off worker injury . The vessel ran aground in 1969 , and she collided with SS Hochelaga in 1970 . Later that same year , she struck the wall of a lock , an accident repeated in 1973 and 1974 . During 1974 , she lost her original bow anchor in the Detroit River . None of these mishaps , however , were considered serious or unusual . Freshwater ships were built to last more than half a century , and Fitzgerald should still have had a long career ahead of her when she sank . 
 = = = Final voyage and wreck = = = 
 Fitzgerald left Superior , Wisconsin , at 2 : 15 p.m. on the afternoon of November 9 , 1975 , under the command of Captain Ernest M. McSorley . She was en route to the steel mill on Zug Island , near Detroit , Michigan , with a cargo of 26 @,@ 116 long tons ( 29 @,@ 250 short tons ; 26 @,@ 535 t ) of taconite ore pellets and soon reached her full speed of 16 @.@ 3 miles per hour ( 14 @.@ 2 kn ; 26 @.@ 2 km / h ) . Around 5 p.m. , Fitzgerald joined a second freighter under the command of Captain Jesse B. " Bernie " Cooper , Arthur M. Anderson , destined for Gary , Indiana , out of Two Harbors , Minnesota . The weather forecast was not unusual for November and the National Weather Service ( NWS ) predicted that a storm would pass just south of Lake Superior by 7 a.m. on November 10 . 
 SS Wilfred Sykes loaded opposite Fitzgerald at the Burlington Northern Dock # 1 and departed at 4 : 15 p.m. , about two hours after Fitzgerald . In contrast to the NWS forecast , Captain Dudley J. Paquette of Sykes predicted that a major storm would directly cross Lake Superior . From the outset , he chose a route that took advantage of the protection offered by the lake 's north shore in order to avoid the worst effects of the storm . The crew of Sykes followed the radio conversations between Fitzgerald and Anderson during the first part of their trip and overheard their captains deciding to take the regular Lake Carriers ' Association <unk> route . The NWS altered its forecast at 7 : 00 p.m. , issuing gale warnings for the whole of Lake Superior . Anderson and Fitzgerald altered course northward seeking shelter along the Ontario coast where they encountered a winter storm at 1 : 00 a.m. on November 10 . Fitzgerald reported winds of 52 knots ( 96 km / h ; 60 mph ) and waves 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) high . Captain Paquette of Sykes reported that after 1 a.m. , he overheard McSorley say that he had reduced the ship 's speed because of the rough conditions . Paquette said he was stunned to later hear McSorley , who was not known for turning aside or slowing down , state that " we 're going to try for some lee from Isle Royale . You 're walking away from us anyway ... I can 't stay with you . " 
 At 2 : 00 a.m. on November 10 , the NWS upgraded its warnings from gale to storm , forecasting winds of 35 – 50 knots ( 65 – 93 km / h ; 40 – 58 mph ) . Until then , Fitzgerald had followed Anderson , which was travelling at a constant 14 @.@ 6 miles per hour ( 12 @.@ 7 kn ; 23 @.@ 5 km / h ) , but the faster Fitzgerald pulled ahead at about 3 : 00 a.m. As the storm center passed over the ships , they experienced shifting winds , with wind speeds temporarily dropping as wind direction changed from northeast to south and then northwest . After 1 : 50 p.m. , when Anderson logged winds of 5 knots ( 9 @.@ 3 km / h ; 5 @.@ 8 mph ) , wind speeds again picked up rapidly and it began to snow at 2 : 45 p.m. , reducing visibility ; Anderson lost sight of Fitzgerald , which was about 16 miles ( 26 km ) ahead at the time . 
 Shortly after 3 : 30 p.m. , Captain McSorley radioed Anderson to report that Fitzgerald was taking on water and had lost two vent covers and a fence railing . The vessel had also developed a list . Two of Fitzgerald 's six bilge pumps ran continuously to discharge shipped water . McSorley said that he would slow his ship down so that Anderson could close the gap between them . In a broadcast shortly afterward , the United States Coast Guard ( USCG ) warned all shipping that the Soo Locks had been closed and they should seek safe anchorage . Shortly after 4 : 10 p.m. , McSorley called Anderson again to report a radar failure and asked Anderson to keep track of them . Fitzgerald , effectively blind , slowed to let Anderson come within a 10 @-@ mile ( 16 km ) range so she could receive radar guidance from the other ship . 
 For a time , Anderson directed Fitzgerald toward the relative safety of Whitefish Bay ; then at 4 : 39 p.m. , McSorley contacted the USCG station in Grand Marais , Michigan , to inquire whether the Whitefish Point light and navigation beacon were operational . The USCG replied that their monitoring equipment indicated that both instruments were inactive . McSorley then hailed any ships in the Whitefish Point area to report the state of the navigational aids , receiving an answer from Captain Cedric Woodard of <unk> between 5 : 00 and 5 : 30 p.m. that the Whitefish point light was on but not the radio beacon . Woodard testified to the Marine Board that he overheard McSorley say , " Don 't allow nobody on deck , " as well as something about a vent that Woodard could not understand . Some time later , McSorley told Woodard , " I have a ' bad list , ' I have lost both radars , and am taking heavy seas over the deck in one of the worst seas I have ever been in . " 
 By late in the afternoon of November 10 , sustained winds of over 50 knots ( 93 km / h ; 58 mph ) were recorded by ships and observation points across eastern Lake Superior . Anderson logged sustained winds as high as 58 knots ( 107 km / h ; 67 mph ) at 4 : 52 p.m. , while waves increased to as high as 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) by 6 : 00 p.m. Anderson was also struck by 70 @-@ to @-@ 75 @-@ knot ( 130 to 139 km / h ; 81 to 86 mph ) gusts and rogue waves as high as 35 feet ( 11 m ) . 
 The last communication from the ship came at approximately 7 : 10 p.m. , when Anderson notified Fitzgerald of an <unk> ship and asked how she was doing . McSorley reported , " We are holding our own . " She sank minutes later . No distress signal was received , and ten minutes later , Anderson lost the ability either to raise Fitzgerald by radio or to detect her on radar . 
 = = = Search = = = 
 Captain Cooper of Anderson first called the USCG in Sault Ste . Marie at 7 : 39 p.m. on channel 16 , the radio distress frequency . The USCG responders instructed him to call back on channel 12 because they wanted to keep their emergency channel open and they were having difficulty with their communication systems , including antennas blown down by the storm . Cooper then contacted the <unk> saltwater vessel <unk> and was told that she could not pick up Fitzgerald on her radar . Despite repeated attempts to raise the USCG , Cooper was not successful until 7 : 54 p.m. when the officer on duty asked him to keep watch for a 16 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) outboard lost in the area . At about 8 : 25 p.m. , Cooper again called the USCG to express his concern about Fitzgerald and at 9 : 03 p.m. reported her missing . Petty Officer Philip Branch later testified , " I considered it serious , but at the time it was not urgent . " 
 Lacking appropriate search @-@ and @-@ rescue vessels to respond to the Fitzgerald disaster , at approximately 9 : 00 p.m. , the USCG asked Anderson to turn around and look for survivors . Around 10 : 30 p.m. , the USCG asked all commercial vessels anchored in or near Whitefish Bay to assist in the search . The initial search for survivors was carried out by Anderson , and a second freighter , SS William Clay Ford . The efforts of a third freighter , the Toronto @-@ registered SS Hilda <unk> , were foiled by the weather . The USCG sent a buoy tender , <unk> , from Duluth , Minnesota , but it took two and a half hours to launch and a day to arrive at the search area . The Traverse City , Michigan , USCG station launched an HU @-@ 16 fixed @-@ wing search aircraft that arrived on the scene at 10 : 53 p.m. while an HH @-@ 52 USCG helicopter with a 3 @.@ 8 @-@ million @-@ candlepower searchlight arrived at 1 : 00 a.m. on November 11 . Canadian Coast Guard aircraft joined the three @-@ day search and the Ontario Provincial Police established and maintained a beach patrol all along the eastern shore of Lake Superior . 
 Although the search recovered debris , including lifeboats and rafts , no survivors were found . On her final voyage , Fitzgerald 's crew of 29 consisted of the captain , the first , second and third mates , five engineers , three oilers , a cook , a wiper , two maintenance men , three watchmen , three deckhands , three <unk> , two porters , a cadet and a steward . Most of the crew was from Ohio and Wisconsin ; their ages ranged from 21 @-@ year @-@ old deckhand Mark Andrew Thomas to Captain McSorley , 63 years old and planning his retirement . 
 Fitzgerald is among the largest and best @-@ known vessels lost on the Great Lakes but she is not alone on the Lake Superior seabed in that area . In the years between 1816 , when Invincible was lost , and 1975 , when Fitzgerald sank , the Whitefish Point area had claimed at least 240 ships .

Fitzgerald lay about 15 miles ( 13 nmi ; 24 km ) west of Deadman 's Cove , Ontario , 17 miles ( 15 nmi ; 27 km ) from the entrance to Whitefish Bay to the southeast , in Canadian waters close to the international boundary at a depth of 530 feet ( 160 m ) . A further November 14 – 16 survey by the USCG using a side scan sonar revealed two large objects lying close together on the lake floor . The U.S. Navy also contracted Seaward , Inc . , to conduct a second survey between November 22 and 25 . 
 = = = Underwater surveys = = = 
 From May 20 to 28 , 1976 , the U.S. Navy dived the wreck using its unmanned submersible , CURV @-@ III , and found Fitzgerald lying in two large pieces in 530 feet ( 160 m ) of water . Navy estimates put the length of the bow section at 276 feet ( 84 m ) and that of the stern section at 253 feet ( 77 m ) . The bow section stood upright in the mud , some 170 feet ( 52 m ) from the stern section that lay capsized at a 50 @-@ degree angle from the bow . In between the two broken sections lay a large mass of taconite pellets and scattered wreckage lying about , including hatch covers and hull plating . 
 In 1980 , during a Lake Superior research dive expedition , marine explorer Jean @-@ Michel Cousteau , the son of Jacques Cousteau , sent two divers from RV Calypso in the first manned submersible dive to Fitzgerald . The dive was brief , and although the dive team drew no final conclusions , they speculated that Fitzgerald had broken up on the surface . 
 The Michigan Sea Grant Program organized a three @-@ day dive to survey the Fitzgerald in 1989 . The primary objective was to record 3 @-@ D videotape for use in museum educational programs and production of documentaries . The expedition used a towed survey system ( TSS Mk1 ) and a self @-@ propelled , tethered , free swimming remotely operated underwater vehicle ( ROV ) . The Mini Rover ROV was equipped with miniature stereoscopic cameras and wide angle lenses in order to produce 3 @-@ D images . The towed survey system and the Mini Rover ROV were designed , built and operated by Chris Nicholson of Deep Sea Systems International , Inc . Participants included the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , the National Geographic Society , the United States Army Corps of Engineers , the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society ( GLSHS ) , and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service , the latter providing RV Grayling as the support vessel for the ROV . The GLSHS used part of the five hours of video footage produced during the dives in a documentary and the National Geographic Society used a segment in a broadcast . Frederick Stonehouse , who wrote one of the first books on the Fitzgerald wreck , moderated a 1990 panel review of the video that drew no conclusions about the cause of Fitzgerald 's sinking . 
 Canadian explorer Joseph B. MacInnis organized and led six publicly funded dives to Fitzgerald over a three @-@ day period in 1994 . Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution provided Edwin A. Link as the support vessel , and their manned submersible , Celia . The GLSHS paid $ 10 @,@ 000 for three of its members to each join a dive and take still pictures . MacInnis concluded that the notes and video obtained during the dives did not provide an explanation why Fitzgerald sank . The same year , longtime sport diver Fred Shannon formed Deepquest Ltd . , and organized a privately funded dive to the wreck of Fitzgerald , using Delta Oceanographic 's submersible , Delta . Deepquest Ltd. conducted seven dives and took more than 42 hours of underwater video while Shannon set the record for the longest submersible dive to Fitzgerald at 211 minutes . Prior to conducting the dives , Shannon studied NOAA navigational charts and found that the international boundary had changed three times before its publication by NOAA in 1976 . Shannon determined that based on GPS coordinates from the 1994 Deepquest expedition , " at least one @-@ third of the two acres of immediate wreckage containing the two major portions of the vessel is in U.S. waters because of an error in the position of the U.S. – Canada boundary line shown on official lake charts . " 
 Shannon 's group discovered the remains of a crew member partly dressed in coveralls and wearing a life jacket lying face up on the lake bottom alongside the bow of the ship , indicating that at least one of the crew was aware of the possibility of sinking . The life jacket had deteriorated canvas and " what is thought to be six rectangular cork blocks ... clearly visible . " Shannon concluded that " massive and advancing structural failure " caused Fitzgerald to break apart on the surface and sink . 
 MacInnis led another series of dives in 1995 to salvage the bell from Fitzgerald . The Sault Tribe of Chippewa Indians backed the expedition by co @-@ signing a loan in the amount of $ 250 @,@ 000 . Canadian engineer Phil Nuytten 's atmospheric diving suit , known as the " <unk> , " was used to retrieve the bell from the ship , replace it with a replica , and put a beer can in Fitzgerald 's pilothouse . That same year , Terrence <unk> and Mike Zee set multiple records when they used trimix gas to scuba dive to Fitzgerald . The pair are the only people known to have touched the Fitzgerald wreck . They also set records for the deepest scuba dive on the Great Lakes and the deepest shipwreck dive , and were the first divers to reach Fitzgerald without the aid of a submersible . It took six minutes to reach the wreck , six minutes to survey it , and three hours to resurface to avoid decompression sickness , also known as " the bends . " 
 = = = Restrictions on surveys = = = 
 Under the Ontario Heritage Act , activities on registered archeological sites require a license . In March 2005 , the Whitefish Point Preservation Society accused the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society ( GLSHS ) of conducting an unauthorized dive to Fitzgerald . Although the director of the GLSHS admitted to conducting a sonar scan of the wreck in 2002 , he denied such a survey required a license at the time it was carried out . 
 An April 2005 amendment to the Ontario Heritage Act allowed the Ontario government to impose a license requirement on dives , the operation of submersibles , side scan sonars or underwater cameras within a designated radius around protected sites . Conducting any of those activities without a license would result in fine of up to CAD $ 1 million . On the basis of the amended law , to protect wreck sites considered " watery graves " , the Ontario government issued updated regulations in January 2006 , including an area with a 500 @-@ meter ( 1 @,@ 640 ft ) radius around Fitzgerald and other specifically designated marine archeological sites . In 2009 , a further amendment to the Ontario Heritage Act imposed licensing requirements on any type of surveying device . 
 = = Theories on the cause of sinking = = 
 Extreme weather and sea conditions play a role in all of the published theories regarding Fitzgerald 's sinking , but they differ on the other causal factors . 
 = = = Waves and weather theory = = = 
 In 2005 NOAA and the NWS ran a computer simulation , including weather and wave conditions , covering the period from November 9 , 1975 , until the early morning of November 11 . Analysis of the simulation showed that two separate areas of high wind appeared over Lake Superior at 4 : 00 p.m. on November 10 . One had speeds in excess of 43 knots ( 80 km / h ; 49 mph ) and the other winds in excess of 40 knots ( 74 km / h ; 46 mph ) . The southeastern part of the lake , the direction in which Fitzgerald was heading , had the highest winds . Average wave heights increased to near 19 feet ( 5 @.@ 8 m ) by 7 : 00 p.m. , November 10 , and winds exceeded 50 mph ( 43 kn ; 80 km / h ) over most of southeastern Lake Superior . 
 Fitzgerald sank at the eastern edge of the area of high wind where the long fetch , or distance that wind blows over water , produced significant waves averaging over 23 feet ( 7 @.@ 0 m ) by 7 : 00 p.m. and over 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) at 8 : 00 p.m. The simulation also showed one in 100 waves reaching 36 feet ( 11 m ) and one out of every 1 @,@ 000 reaching 46 feet ( 14 m ) . Since the ship was heading east @-@ southeastward , the waves likely caused Fitzgerald to roll heavily . 
 At the time of the sinking , the ship Arthur M. Anderson reported northwest winds of 57 mph ( 50 kn ; 92 km / h ) , matching the simulation analysis result of 54 mph ( 47 kn ; 87 km / h ) . The analysis further showed that the maximum sustained winds reached near hurricane force of about 70 mph ( 61 kn ; 110 km / h ) with gusts to 86 miles per hour ( 75 kn ; 138 km / h ) at the time and location where Fitzgerald sank . 
 = = = Rogue wave theory = = = 
 A group of three rogue waves , often called " three sisters , " was reported in the vicinity of Fitzgerald at the time she sank . The " three sisters " phenomenon is said to occur on Lake Superior as a result of a sequence of three rogue waves forming that are one @-@ third larger than normal waves . When the first wave hits a ship 's deck , before its water drains away the second wave strikes . The third incoming wave adds to the two accumulated <unk> , suddenly overloading the deck with tons of water . 
 Captain Cooper of Anderson reported that his ship was " hit by two 30 to 35 foot seas about 6 : 30 p.m. , one burying the aft cabins and damaging a lifeboat by pushing it right down onto the saddle . The second wave of this size , perhaps 35 foot , came over the bridge deck . " Cooper went on to say that these two waves , possibly followed by a third , continued in the direction of Fitzgerald and would have struck about the time she sank . This theory postulates that the " three sisters " compounded the twin problems of Fitzgerald 's known list and her slower speed in heavy seas that already allowed water to remain on her deck for longer than usual . 
 The Edmund Fitzgerald episode of the 2010 television series Dive Detectives features the wave @-@ generating tank of the National Research Council 's Institute for Naval Technology in St. John 's , and the tank 's simulation of the effect of a 17 @-@ meter ( 56 ft ) rogue wave upon a scale model of Fitzgerald . The simulation indicated such a rogue wave could almost completely submerge the bow or stern of the ship with water , at least temporarily . 
 = = = Cargo @-@ hold flooding theory = = = 
 The July 26 , 1977 , USCG Marine Casualty Report suggested that the accident was caused by ineffective hatch closures . The report concluded that these devices failed to prevent waves from inundating the cargo hold . The flooding occurred gradually and probably imperceptibly throughout the final day , finally resulting in a fatal loss of buoyancy and stability . As a result , Fitzgerald plummeted to the bottom without warning . Video footage of the wreck site showed that most of her hatch clamps were in perfect condition . The USCG Marine board concluded that the few damaged clamps were probably the only ones fastened . As a result , ineffective hatch closure caused Fitzgerald to flood and founder . 
 From the beginning of the USCG inquiry , some of the crewmen 's families and various labor organizations believed the USCG findings could be tainted because there were serious questions regarding their preparedness as well as licensing and rules changes . Paul Trimble , a retired USCG vice admiral and president of the Lake Carriers Association ( LCA ) , wrote a letter to the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) on September 16 , 1977 , that included the following statements of objection to the USCG findings : 
 The present hatch covers are an advanced design and are considered by the entire lake shipping industry to be the most significant improvement over the telescoping leaf covers previously used for many years ... The one @-@ piece hatch covers have proven completely satisfactory in all weather conditions without a single vessel loss in almost 40 years of use ... and no water accumulation in cargo holds ... 
 It was common practice for ore freighters , even in foul weather , to embark with not all cargo clamps locked in place on the hatch covers . Maritime author Wolff reported that depending on weather conditions , all the clamps were eventually set within one to two days . Captain Paquette of Wilfred Sykes was dismissive of suggestions that unlocked hatch clamps caused Fitzgerald to founder . He said that he commonly sailed in fine weather using the minimum number of clamps necessary to secure the hatch covers . 
 The May 4 , 1978 , NTSB findings differed from the USCG . The NTSB made the following observations based on the CURV @-@ III survey : 
 The No. 1 hatch cover was entirely inside the No. 1 hatch and showed indications of buckling from external loading . Sections of the coaming in way of the No. 1 hatch were fractured and buckled inward . The No. 2 hatch cover was missing and the coaming on the No. 2 hatch was fractured and buckled . Hatches Nos. 3 and 4 were covered with mud ; one corner of hatch cover No. 3 could be seen in place . Hatch cover No. 5 was missing . A series of 16 consecutive hatch cover clamps were observed on the No. 5 hatch coaming . Of this series , the first and eighth were distorted or broken . All of the 14 other clamps were undamaged and in the open position . The No. 6 hatch was open and a hatch cover was standing on end vertically in the hatch . The hatch covers were missing from hatches Nos. 7 and 8 and both coamings were fractured and severely distorted . The bow section abruptly ended just aft of hatch No. 8 and the deck plating was ripped up from the separation to the forward end of hatch No. 7 . 
 The NTSB conducted computer studies , testing and analysis to determine the forces necessary to collapse the hatch covers and concluded that Fitzgerald sank suddenly from flooding of the cargo hold " due to the collapse of one or more of the hatch covers under the weight of giant boarding seas " instead of flooding gradually due to ineffective hatch closures . The NTSB dissenting opinion held that Fitzgerald sank suddenly and unexpectedly from shoaling . 
 = = = Shoaling theory = = = 
 The LCA believed that instead of hatch cover leakage , the more probable cause of the Fitzgerald loss was shoaling or grounding in the Six Fathom Shoal northwest of Caribou Island when the vessel " unknowingly raked a reef " during the time the Whitefish Point light and radio beacon were not available as navigation aids . This theory was supported by a 1976 Canadian hydrographic survey , which disclosed that an unknown shoal ran a mile further east of Six Fathom Shoal than shown on the Canadian charts . Officers from Anderson observed that Fitzgerald sailed through this exact area . <unk> by proponents of the Six Fathom Shoal theory concluded that Fitzgerald 's downed fence rail reported by McSorley could occur only if the ship " <unk> " during shoaling , with the bow and stern bent downward and the midsection raised by the shoal , pulling the railing tight until the cables dislodged or tore under the strain . Divers searched the Six Fathom Shoal after the wreck occurred and found no evidence of " a recent collision or grounding anywhere . " Maritime authors Bishop and Stonehouse wrote that the shoaling theory was later challenged on the basis of the higher quality of detail in Shannon 's 1994 photography that " explicitly show [ s ] the devastation of the Fitzgerald . " Shannon 's photography of Fitzgerald 's overturned stern showed " no evidence on the bottom of the stern , the propeller or the rudder of the ship that would indicate the ship struck a shoal . " 
 Maritime author Stonehouse reasoned that " unlike the Lake Carriers , the Coast Guard had no vested interest in the outcome of their investigation . " Author Bishop reported that Captain Paquette of Wilfred Sykes argued that through their support for the shoaling explanation , the LCA represented the shipping company 's interests by advocating a theory that held LCA member companies , the American Bureau of Shipping , and the U.S. Coast Guard Service blameless . 
 Paul Hainault , a retired professor of mechanical engineering from Michigan Technological University , promoted a theory that began as a student class project . His hypothesis held that Fitzgerald grounded at 9 : 30 a.m. on November 10 on Superior Shoal . This shoal , charted in 1929 , is an underwater mountain in the middle of Lake Superior about 50 miles ( 80 km ) north of Copper Harbor , Michigan . It has sharp peaks that rise nearly to the lake surface with water depths ranging from 22 to 400 feet ( 6 @.@ 7 to 121 @.@ 9 m ) , making it a menace to navigation . Discovery of the shoal resulted in a change in recommended shipping routes . A seiche , or standing wave , that occurred during the low @-@ pressure system over Lake Superior on November 10 , 1975 , caused the lake to rise 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) over the Soo Locks 's gates to flood Portage Avenue in Sault Ste . Marie , Michigan , with 1 foot ( 0 @.@ 3 m ) of water . Hainault 's theory held that this seiche contributed to Fitzgerald shoaling 200 feet ( 61 m ) of her hull on Superior Shoal , causing the hull to be punctured mid @-@ body . The hypothesis contended that the wave action continued to damage the hull , until the middle third dropped out like a box , leaving the ship held together by the center deck . The stern section acted as an anchor and caused Fitzgerald to come to a full stop , causing everything to go forward . The ship broke apart on the surface within seconds . Compressed air pressure blew a hole in the starboard bow , which sank 18 degrees off course . The rear kept going forward with the engine still running , rolled to port and landed bottom up . 
 = = = Structural failure theory = = = 
 Another published theory contends that an already weakened structure , and modification of Fitzgerald 's winter load line ( which allows heavier loading and travel lower in the water ) , made it possible for large waves to cause a stress fracture in the hull . This is based on the " regular " huge waves of the storm and does not necessarily involve rogue waves . 
 The USCG and NTSB investigated whether Fitzgerald broke apart due to structural failure of the hull and because the 1976 CURV III survey found the Fitzgerald sections were 170 feet ( 52 m ) from each other , the USCG 's formal casualty report of July 1977 concluded that she had separated upon hitting the lake floor . The NTSB came to the same conclusion as USCG because : 
 The proximity of the bow and stern sections on the bottom of Lake Superior indicated that the vessel sank in one piece and broke apart either when it hit bottom or as it descended . Therefore , the Fitzgerald did not sustain a massive structural failure of the hull while on the surface ... The final position of the wreckage indicated that if the Fitzgerald had capsized , it must have suffered a structural failure before hitting the lake bottom . The bow section would have had to right itself and the stern portion would have had to capsize before coming to rest on the bottom . It is , therefore , concluded that the Fitzgerald did not capsize on the surface . 
 After maritime historian Frederick Stonehouse moderated the panel reviewing the video footage from the 1989 ROV survey of Fitzgerald , he concluded that the extent of taconite coverage over the wreck site showed that the stern had floated on the surface for a short time and spilled taconite into the forward section ; thus the two sections of the wreck did not sink at the same time . The 1994 Shannon team found that the stern and the bow were 255 feet ( 78 m ) apart leading Shannon to conclude that Fitzgerald broke up on the surface . He said : 
 This placement does not support the theory that the ship plunged to the bottom in one piece , breaking apart when it struck bottom . If this were true , the two sections would be much closer . In addition , the angle , repose and <unk> of clay and mud at the site indicate the stern rolled over on the surface , spilling taconite ore pellets from its severed cargo hold , and then landed on portions of the cargo itself . 
 The stress fracture theory was supported by the testimony of former crewmen . Former Second Mate Richard Orgel , who served on Fitzgerald in 1972 and 1973 , testified that " the ship had a tendency to bend and spring during storms ' like a diving board after somebody has jumped off . ' " Orgel was quoted as saying that the loss of Fitzgerald was caused by hull failure , " pure and simple . I detected undue stress in the side tunnels by examining the white enamel paint , which will crack and splinter when submitted to severe stress . " George H. " Red " Burgner , Fitzgerald 's steward for ten seasons and winter ship @-@ keeper for seven years , testified in a deposition that a " loose keel " contributed to the vessel 's loss . Burgner further testified that " the keel and sister <unk> were only ' tack welded ' " and that he had personally observed that many of the welds were broken . Burgner was not asked to testify before the Marine Board of Inquiry . 
 When Bethlehem Steel Corporation permanently laid up Fitzgerald 's sister ship , SS Arthur B. Homer , just five years after going to considerable expense to lengthen her , questions were raised as to whether both ships had the same structural problems . The two vessels were built in the same shipyard using welded joints instead of the riveted joints used in older ore freighters . <unk> joints allow a ship to flex and work in heavy seas , while welded joints are more likely to break . Reports indicate that repairs to Fitzgerald 's hull were delayed in 1975 due to plans to lengthen the ship during the upcoming winter layup . Homer was lengthened to 825 feet ( 251 m ) and placed back in service by December 1975 , not long after Fitzgerald foundered . In 1978 , without explanation , Bethlehem Steel Corporation denied permission for the chairman of the NTSB to travel on Homer . Homer was permanently laid up in 1980 and broken for scrap in 1987 . 
 Retired GLEW naval architect Raymond Ramsey , one of the members of the design team that worked on the hull of Fitzgerald , reviewed her increased load lines , maintenance history , along with the history of long ship hull failure and concluded that Fitzgerald was not seaworthy on November 10 , 1975 . He stated that planning Fitzgerald to be compatible with the constraints of the St. Lawrence Seaway had placed her hull design in a " straight jacket [ sic ? ] . " Fitzgerald 's long @-@ ship design was developed without the benefit of research , development , test , and evaluation principles while computerized analytical technology was not available at the time she was built . Ramsey noted that Fitzgerald 's hull was built with an all @-@ welded ( instead of riveted ) modular fabrication method , which was used for the first time in the GLEW shipyard . Ramsey concluded that increasing the hull length to 729 feet ( 222 m ) resulted in a L / D slenderness ratio ( the ratio of the length of the ship to the depth of her structure ) that caused excessive multi @-@ axial bending and springing of the hull , and that the hull should have been structurally reinforced to cope with her increased length . 
 = = = Topside damage theory = = = 
 The USCG cited topside damage as a reasonable alternative reason for Fitzgerald sinking and surmised that damage to the fence rail and vents was possibly caused by a heavy floating object such as a log . Historian and mariner Mark Thompson believes that something broke loose from Fitzgerald 's deck . He theorized that the loss of the vents resulted in flooding of two ballast tanks or a ballast tank and a walking tunnel that caused the ship to list . Thompson further conjectured that damage more extensive than Captain McSorley could detect in the pilothouse let water flood the cargo hold . He concluded that the topside damage Fitzgerald experienced at 3 : 30 p.m. on November 10 , compounded by the heavy seas , was the most obvious explanation for why she sank . 
 = = Possible contributing factors = = 
 The USCG , NTSB , and proponents of alternative theories have all named multiple possible contributing factors to the foundering of Fitzgerald . 
 = = = Weather forecasting = = = 
 The NWS long range forecast on November 9 , 1975 , predicted that a storm would pass just south of Lake Superior and over the Keweenaw Peninsula , extending into the Lake from Michigan 's Upper Peninsula . Captain Paquette of Wilfred Sykes had been following and charting the low pressure system over Oklahoma since November 8 and concluded that a major storm would track across eastern Lake Superior . He therefore chose a route that gave Sykes the most protection and took refuge in Thunder Bay , Ontario , during the worst of the storm . Based on the NWS forecast , Arthur M. Anderson and Edmund Fitzgerald instead started their trip across Lake Superior following the regular Lake Carriers Association route , which placed them in the path of the storm . The NTSB investigation concluded that the NWS failed to accurately predict wave heights on November 10 . After running computer models in 2005 using actual meteorological data from November 10 , 1975 , <unk> of the NWS said of Fitzgerald 's position in the storm , " It ended in precisely the wrong place at the absolute worst time . " 
 = = = Inaccurate navigational charts = = = 
 After reviewing testimony that Fitzgerald had passed near shoals north of Caribou Island , the USCG Marine Board examined the relevant navigational charts . They found that the Canadian 1973 navigational chart for the Six Fathom Shoal area was based on Canadian surveys from 1916 and 1919 and that the 1973 U.S. Lake Survey Chart No. 9 included the notation , " Canadian Areas . For data concerning Canadian areas , Canadian authorities have been consulted . " Thereafter , at the request of the Marine Board and the Commander of the USCG Ninth District , the Canadian Hydrographic Service conducted a survey of the area surrounding <unk> Island and Caribou Island in 1976 . The survey revealed that the shoal ran about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) further east than shown on Canadian charts . The NTSB investigation concluded that , at the time of the Fitzgerald foundering , Lake Survey Chart No. 9 was not detailed enough to indicate Six Fathom Shoal as a hazard to navigation . 
 = = = Lack of watertight bulkheads = = = 
 Mark Thompson , a merchant seaman and author of numerous books on Great Lakes shipping , stated that if her cargo holds had watertight subdivisions , " the Fitzgerald could have made it into Whitefish Bay . " Frederick Stonehouse also held that the lack of watertight bulkheads caused Fitzgerald to sink . He said : 
 The Great Lakes ore carrier is the most commercially efficient vessel in the shipping trade today . But it 's nothing but a motorized barge ! It 's the <unk> commercial vessel afloat . It has virtually no watertight integrity . Theoretically , a one @-@ inch puncture in the cargo hold will sink it . 
 Stonehouse called on ship designers and builders to design lake carriers more like ships rather than " motorized super @-@ barges " making the following comparison : 
 Contrast this [ the Fitzgerald ] with the story of the SS Maumee , an oceangoing tanker that struck an iceberg near the South Pole recently . The collision tore a hole in the ship 's bow large enough to drive a truck through , but the Maumee was able to travel halfway around the world to a repair yard , without difficulty , because she was fitted with watertight bulkheads . 
 After Fitzgerald foundered , Great Lakes shipping companies were accused of valuing cargo payloads more than human life , since the vessel 's cargo hold of 860 @,@ 950 cubic feet ( 24 @,@ 379 m3 ) had been divided by two non @-@ watertight traverse " screen " bulkheads . The NTSB Fitzgerald investigation concluded that Great Lakes freighters should be constructed with watertight bulkheads in their cargo holds . 
 The USCG had proposed rules for watertight bulkheads in Great Lakes vessels as early as the sinking of Daniel J. Morrell in 1966 and did so again after the sinking of Fitzgerald , arguing that this would allow ships to make it to refuge or at least allow crew members to abandon ship in an orderly fashion . The LCA represented the Great Lakes fleet owners and was able to forestall watertight subdivision regulations by arguing that this would cause economic hardship for vessel operators . A few vessel operators have built Great Lakes ships with watertight subdivisions in the cargo holds since 1975 , but most vessels operating on the lakes cannot prevent flooding of the entire cargo hold area . 
 = = = Lack of instrumentation = = = 
 A fathometer was not required under USCG regulations , and Fitzgerald lacked one , even though <unk> were available at the time of her sinking . Instead , a hand line was the only method Fitzgerald had to take depth soundings . The hand line consisted of a piece of line knotted at measured intervals with a lead weight on the end . The line was thrown over the bow of the ship and the count of the knots measured the water depth . The NTSB investigation concluded that a fathometer would have provided Fitzgerald additional navigational data and made her less dependent on Anderson for navigational assistance . 
 Fitzgerald had no system to monitor the presence or amount of water in her cargo hold , even though there was always some present . The intensity of the November 10 storm would have made it difficult , if not impossible , to access the hatches from the spar deck . The USCG Marine Board found that flooding of the hold could not have been assessed until the water reached the top of the taconite cargo . The NTSB investigation concluded that it would have been impossible to pump water from the hold when it was filled with bulk cargo . The Marine Board noted that because Fitzgerald lacked a draft @-@ reading system , the crew had no way to determine whether the vessel had lost freeboard ( the level of a ship 's deck above the water ) . 
 = = = Increased load lines , reduced freeboard = = = 
 The USCG increased Fitzgerald 's load line in 1969 , 1971 , and 1973 to allow 3 feet 3 @.@ 25 inches ( 997 mm ) less minimum freeboard than Fitzgerald 's original design allowed in 1958 . This meant that Fitzgerald 's deck was only 11 @.@ 5 feet ( 3 @.@ 5 m ) above the water when she faced 35 @-@ foot ( 11 m ) waves during the November 10 storm . Captain Paquette of Sykes noted that this change allowed loading to 4 @,@ 000 tons more than what Fitz was designed to carry . 
 Concerns regarding Fitzgerald 's keel @-@ welding problem surfaced during the time the USCG started increasing her load line . This increase and the resultant reduction in freeboard decreased the vessel 's critical reserve buoyancy . Prior to the load @-@ line increases she was said to be a " good riding ship " but afterwards Fitzgerald became a sluggish ship with slower response and recovery times . Captain McSorley said he did not like the action of a ship he described as a " wiggling thing " that scared him . Fitzgerald 's bow hooked to one side or the other in heavy seas without recovering and made a groaning sound not heard on other ships . 
 = = = Maintenance = = = 
 NTSB investigators noted that Fitzgerald 's prior groundings could have caused undetected damage that led to major structural failure during the storm , since Great Lakes vessels were normally drydocked for inspection only once every five years . It was also alleged that when compared to Fitzgerald 's previous captain , McSorley did not keep up with routine maintenance and did not confront the mates about getting the requisite work done . After August B. <unk> , Jr . , president of the American Society for Testing and Materials , examined photographs of the welds on Fitzgerald , he stated , " the hull was just being held together with patching plates . " Other questions were raised as to why the USCG did not discover and take corrective action in its pre @-@ November 1975 inspection of Fitzgerald given that her hatch coamings , gaskets , and clamps were poorly maintained . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 On the fateful evening of November 10 , 1975 , McSorley reported he had never seen bigger seas in his life . Paquette , master of Wilfred Sykes , out in the same storm , said , " I 'll tell anyone that it was a monster sea washing solid water over the deck of every vessel out there . " The USCG did not broadcast that all ships should seek safe anchorage until after 3 : 35 p.m. on November 10 , many hours after the weather was upgraded from a gale to a storm . 
 McSorley was known as a " heavy weather captain " who " ' beat hell ' out of the Fitzgerald and ' very seldom ever hauled up for weather ' " . Paquette held the opinion that negligence caused Fitzgerald to founder . He said , " in my opinion , all the subsequent events arose because ( McSorley ) kept pushing that ship and didn 't have enough training in weather forecasting to use common sense and pick a route out of the worst of the wind and seas . " Paquette 's vessel was the first to reach a discharge port after the November 10 storm ; she was met by company attorneys who came aboard Sykes . He told them that Fitzgerald 's foundering was caused by negligence . Paquette was never asked to testify during the USCG or NTSB investigations . 
 The NTSB investigation noted that Great Lakes cargo vessels could normally avoid severe storms , and called for the establishment of a limiting sea state applicable to Great Lakes bulk cargo vessels . This would restrict the operation of vessels in sea states above the limiting value . One concern was that shipping companies pressured the captains to deliver cargo as quickly and cheaply as possible regardless of bad weather . At the time of Fitzgerald 's foundering , there was no evidence that any governmental regulatory agency tried to control vessel movement in foul weather despite the historical record that hundreds of Great Lakes vessels had been wrecked in storms . The USCG took the position that only the captain could decide when it was safe to sail . 
 The USCG Marine Board issued the following conclusion : 
 The nature of Great Lakes shipping , with short voyages , much of the time in very protected waters , frequently with the same routine from trip to trip , leads to complacency and an overly optimistic attitude concerning the extreme weather conditions that can and do exist . The Marine Board feels that this attitude reflects itself at times in deferral of maintenance and repairs , in failure to prepare properly for heavy weather , and in the conviction that since refuges are near , safety is possible by " running for it . " While it is true that sailing conditions are good during the summer season , changes can occur abruptly , with severe storms and extreme weather and sea conditions arising rapidly . This tragic accident points out the need for all persons involved in Great Lakes shipping to foster increased awareness of the hazards which exist . 
 Mark Thompson countered that " the Coast Guard laid bare [ its ] own complacency " by blaming the sinking of Fitzgerald on industry @-@ wide complacency since it had inspected Fitzgerald just two weeks before she sank . The loss of Fitzgerald also exposed the USCG 's lack of rescue capability on Lake Superior . Thompson said that ongoing budget cuts had limited the USCG 's ability to perform its historical functions . He further noted that USCG rescue vessels were unlikely to reach the scene of an incident on Lake Superior or Lake Huron within 6 to 12 hours of its occurrence . 
 = = Legal settlement = = 
 Under maritime law , ships fall under the jurisdiction of the admiralty courts of their flag country . As Fitzgerald was sailing under the U.S. flag , even though she sank in foreign ( Canadian ) waters , she was subject to U.S. admiralty law . With a value of $ 24 million , Fitzgerald 's financial loss was the greatest in Great Lakes sailing history . In addition to the crew , 26 @,@ 116 long tons ( 29 @,@ 250 short tons ; 26 @,@ 535 t ) of taconite sank along with the vessel . Two widows of crewmen filed a $ 1 @.@ 5 million lawsuit against Fitzgerald 's owners , Northwestern Mutual , and its operators , Oglebay Norton Corporation , one week after she sank . An additional $ 2 @.@ 1 million lawsuit was later filed . Oglebay Norton subsequently filed a petition in the U.S. District Court seeking to " limit their liability to $ 817 @,@ 920 in connection with other suits filed by families of crew members . " The company paid compensation to surviving families about 12 months in advance of official findings of the probable cause and on condition of imposed confidentiality agreements . Robert Hemming , a reporter and newspaper editor , reasoned in his book about Fitzgerald that the USCG 's conclusions " were benign in placing blame on [ n ] either the company or the captain ... [ and ] saved the Oglebay Norton from very expensive lawsuits by the families of the lost crew . "

 The USCG investigation of the Fitzgerald sinking resulted in 15 recommendations regarding load lines , <unk> integrity , search and rescue capability , lifesaving equipment , crew training , loading manuals , and providing information to masters of Great Lakes vessels . NTSB 's investigation resulted in 19 recommendations for the USCG , four recommendations for the American Bureau of Shipping , and two recommendations for NOAA . Of the official recommendations , the following actions and USCG regulations were put in place : 
 1 . In 1977 , the USCG made it a requirement that all vessels of 1 @,@ 600 gross register tons and over use depth finders . 
 2 . Since 1980 , survival suits have been required aboard ship in each crew member 's quarters and at their customary work station with strobe lights affixed to life jackets and survival suits . 
 3 . A LORAN @-@ C positioning system for navigation on the Great Lakes was implemented in 1980 and later replaced with Global Positioning System ( GPS ) in the 1990s . 
 4 . Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons ( <unk> ) are installed on all Great Lakes vessels for immediate and accurate location in event of a disaster . 
 5 . Navigational charts for northeastern Lake Superior were improved for accuracy and greater detail . 
 6 . NOAA revised its method for predicting wave heights . 
 7 . The USCG rescinded the 1973 Load Line Regulation amendment that permitted reduced freeboard loadings . 
 8 . The USCG began the annual pre @-@ November inspection program recommended by the NTSB . " Coast Guard inspectors now board all U.S. ships during the fall to inspect hatch and vent closures and lifesaving equipment . " 
 Karl <unk> , an Upper Peninsula meteorologist , covered the sinking and storm in a book on local weather history . In this book , Joe Warren , a deckhand on Anderson during the November 10 , 1975 , storm , said that the storm changed the way things were done . He stated , " After that , trust me , when a gale came up we dropped the hook [ anchor ] . We dropped the hook because they found out the big ones could sink . " Mark Thompson wrote , " Since the loss of the Fitz , some captains may be more prone to go to anchor , rather than venturing out in a severe storm , but there are still too many who like to portray themselves as ' heavy weather sailors . ' "

 The day after the wreck , Mariners ' Church in Detroit rang its bell 29 times ; once for each life lost . The church continued to hold an annual memorial , reading the names of the crewmen and ringing the church bell , until 2006 when the church broadened its memorial ceremony to commemorate all lives lost on the Great Lakes . 
 The ship 's bell was recovered from the wreck on July 4 , 1995 . A replica engraved with the names of the 29 sailors who lost their lives replaced the original on the wreck . A legal document signed by 46 relatives of the deceased , officials of the Mariners ' Church of Detroit and the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historic Society ( GLSHS ) " donated the custodian and conservatorship " of the bell to the GLSHS " to be incorporated in a permanent memorial at Whitefish Point , Michigan , to honor the memory of the 29 men of the SS Edmund Fitzgerald . " The terms of the legal agreement made the GLSHS responsible for maintaining the bell , and forbade it from selling or moving the bell or using it for commercial purposes . It provided for transferring the bell to the Mariners ' Church of Detroit if the terms were violated . 
 An uproar occurred in 1995 when a maintenance worker in St. Ignace , Michigan , refurbished the bell by stripping the protective coating applied by Michigan State University experts . The controversy continued when the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum tried to use the bell as a touring exhibit in 1996 . Relatives of the crew halted this move , objecting that the bell was being used as a " traveling trophy . " The bell is now on display in the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum in Whitefish Point near Paradise , Michigan . 
 An anchor from Fitzgerald lost on an earlier trip was recovered from the Detroit River and is on display at the Dossin Great Lakes Museum in Detroit , Michigan . The Dossin Great Lakes Museum also hosts a Lost Mariners Remembrance event each year on the evening of November 10 . Artifacts on display in the Steamship Valley Camp museum in Sault Ste . Marie , Michigan , include two lifeboats , photos , a movie of Fitzgerald and commemorative models and paintings . Every November 10 , the Split Rock Lighthouse in Silver Bay , Minnesota emits a light in honor of Edmund Fitzgerald . 
 On August 8 , 2007 , along a remote shore of Lake Superior on the Keweenaw Peninsula , a Michigan family discovered a lone life @-@ saving ring that appeared to have come from Fitzgerald . It bore markings different from those of rings found at the wreck site , and was thought to be a hoax . Later it was determined that the life ring was not from Fitzgerald , but had been lost by the owner , whose father had made it as a personal memorial . 
 The Royal Canadian Mint commemorated the Fitzgerald in 2015 with a colored silver collector coin , with a face value of $ 20 .

 In 1976 , Ontario singer @-@ songwriter Gordon Lightfoot wrote , composed , and recorded the song " The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald " for his album Summertime Dream . On NPR 's Saturday Morning Edition on February 14 , 2015 , Gordon Lightfoot said he was inspired to write the song when he saw the name misspelled " Edmond " in Newsweek magazine two weeks after the sinking ; Lightfoot said he felt that it dishonored the memory of the 29 who died . Lightfoot 's popular ballad made the sinking of Fitzgerald one of the most well @-@ known disasters in the history of Great Lakes shipping . The original lyrics of the song show a degree of artistic license compared to the events of the actual sinking : it states the destination as Cleveland instead of Detroit and , in light of new evidence about what happened , Lightfoot has modified one line for live performances , changing “ When suppertime came the old cook came on deck / Saying ‘ Fellas , it ’ s too rough to feed ya . ’ / At 7 p.m. a main hatchway caved in / He said , ‘ Fellas , it 's been good to know ya . ” to “ When suppertime came the old cook came on deck / Saying ‘ Fellows it ’ s too rough to feed ya . ’ / At 7 p.m. it grew dark , it was then / He said , ‘ Fellas , it 's been good to know ya . ’ ” The song has been covered by many performers . The Toronto rock band <unk> recorded it for their second album , Melville , and their live album Double Live . The Dandy Warhols also covered the song in their The Black Album in 2004 . 
 In 1986 , writer Steven Dietz and songwriter / lyricist Eric <unk> wrote the musical Ten November in memory of Fitzgerald 's sinking . In 2005 , the play was re @-@ edited into a concert version called The Gales of November , which opened on the 30th anniversary of the sinking at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul , Minnesota .

 = Martha Logan = 
 Martha Logan is a fictional character played by Jean Smart in the television series 24 . As the first lady of the United States within the 24 universe , she is the capable yet mercurial wife of President Charles Logan . Critics praised Martha Logan as the breakout character of the show 's 2005 @-@ 2006 season . 
 In developing Martha Logan 's character , the show 's writers drew upon the historic example of a prominent whistleblower in the Watergate scandal , Martha Beall Mitchell . Similar to the real @-@ life model , Martha Logan becomes contemptuous of her husband 's conduct in office and decides to go public and end his career . Martha Logan takes part in a plot to get her husband to confess that he conspired with terrorists . Yet her mental health problems undermine her credibility and raise the possibility that she may be forced into treatment at an inpatient facility . After the events of the fifth season she was committed to a mental health facility . 
 = = Concept and creation = = 
 The inspiration for Martha Logan was Martha Beall Mitchell , the wife of John N. Mitchell , Attorney General during the Nixon administration . Mrs. Mitchell was a key whistleblower who contacted the press to disclose facts about the Watergate scandal , and for a time her statements were discredited because people believed she had a mental illness . Nixon said that " Watergate would have not occurred without Martha Mitchell . " 
 Howard Gordon , the executive producer of 24 , said that , during character development , they " wanted an actress that had the strength and intelligence to be a first lady , yet have the unpredictability of never knowing when she might snap . " Jean Smart was their first choice . Smart later told The New York Times that she decided she was eager to play the role after reading the character 's introductory scene , and commented that in her almost 30 years of acting she had come across few roles that offered the possibilities that this one did : a character that is sexy , mysterious , and powerful , yet is mentally unstable and has lost her trust and respect for her husband . 
 Smart also said of the opening scene that : " It encapsulates that character in one moment and says so much about her impulsiveness . We could not have accomplished that with a dozen speeches . When I saw it in the script , I thought ' this is great , this lady is going to be fun to play . ' " 
 On her first day on set , Smart was shocked to learn the producers wanted to cut the scene , a decision she felt was a mistake . She said " They had done this brilliant thing and now they were going to undo it . They were just being practical . They said , " It would be hours to get you back , your hair , your make @-@ up . " Smart spoke to the hair and makeup artists and guaranteed producers they could get it right in two takes ; they did it in one , and the scene stayed in . 
 Jean Smart 's character and Martha Mitchell were both labeled " unstable . " Although the real Martha Mitchell was not mentally ill , the fictional Martha Logan is , and with Smart 's input the writers enhanced this aspect of the character . Smart has said of Martha that she is an impulsive , powerful , and capable woman , and that she is intelligent , but has some " chemical problems " .

 Prior to his death , Palmer asks to meet Martha to discuss a " matter of national security " involving Charles Logan . After his death , Martha believes that Palmer was killed to thwart the meeting , not knowing that her husband was involved in his murder . 
 Several hours later , Martha is frustrated to see her husband negotiating with terrorist Vladimir Bierko and his willingness to compromise Yuri Suvarov and his wife 's safety . Aaron Pierce eventually saves her from the ambush on the <unk> ' motorcade . Martha continues to question Logan 's motives as her husband attempts to prevent her from finding out about his role in Palmer 's death . 
 When Charles reveals that he was involved in the plot to assassinate Palmer , she is deeply shocked and says that she can never forgive him . Contemplating suicide , Logan comes into her room , begging for forgiveness . Rather than accepting his apology , Martha tells him that she is horrified to be his wife . 
 After Jack Bauer fails to obtain a confession from Logan , she screams in public that he is a murderer during Palmer 's funeral . Afterwards , President Logan hits her , and threatens to put Martha in an asylum for life . During his tirade , Logan acknowledges all of his misdeeds , unaware that there is a small listening device on his pen . The confession quickly reaches the Attorney General , who orders the U.S. Marshals to arrest Logan .

" In the debut scene , she proclaimed , " I look like a wedding cake " just before dunking her face into the bathroom sink . Her marriage to President Logan was described by producer Howard Gordon as " one of the highlights of this year . " Smart was also nominated for an Emmy for her performance , Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Category , but lost the award to Blythe Danner .

 An udema ( Swedish pronunciation : [ <unk> ] or [ <unk> ] ; also <unk> ) was a type of warship built for the Swedish archipelago fleet in the late 18th and early 19th centuries . It was developed for warfare in the Archipelago Sea in the Baltic and along the coasts of Svealand and Finland against the Russian navy . The udema was designed by the prolific naval architect Fredrik Henrik af Chapman for use in an area of mostly shallow waters and groups of islands and islets that extend from Stockholm all the way to the Gulf of Finland . 
 The udema was of an innovative new design with a single line of guns along the ship 's centerline , a foreshadowing of the dreadnought battleships of the early 20th century . The design proved impractical for its time , however , and only three udemas were built between 1760 and 1776 . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the early 18th century , the establishment of Russian naval power in the Baltic challenged the interests of Sweden , one of the major powers in the Baltic . The Swedish empire at the time included territory in Northern Germany , all of modern Finland and most of the Baltic states , a dominion held together by the Baltic sea routes . Russian Tsar Peter the Great had established a new capital and naval base in Saint Petersburg in 1703 . During the Great Northern War Sweden lost its Baltic state territories , and suffered from Russian raiding in Finland and along the chain of islands and archipelagos that stretched all the way from the Gulf of Finland to the capital of Stockholm . The Swedes began building inshore flotillas of shallow @-@ draft vessels , beginning with smaller versions of the traditional Mediterranean warships , the galleys . Most of these were more akin to galiots and were complemented with gun prams . The disastrous war with Russia ( 1741 – 43 ) and the minor involvement in Prussia in the Seven Years ' War ( 1757 – 62 ) showed the need for further expansion and development of the inshore flotillas with more specialized vessels . 
 Traditional galleys were effective as troop transports for amphibious operations , but were severely under @-@ gunned , especially in relation to their large crews ; a galley with a 250 @-@ man crew , most of whom were rowers , would typically be armed with only one 24 @-@ pounder cannon and two 6 @-@ pounders , all in the bow . However , they were undecked and lacked adequate shelter for the rower @-@ soldiers , great numbers of which succumbed to illness in the war of 1741 – 43 . The Swedish military invested heavily in an " archipelago fleet " ( <unk> ) , a separate branch of the armed forces that organizationally belonged to the army . In 1756 , it was even officially designated <unk> flotta , " Navy of the Army " . It was in many ways a highly independent organization that attracted a social and cultural elite and enjoyed the protection of Gustav III after his 1772 coup that empowered him as an absolute monarch . 
 Several new ships were designed by the naval architect Fredrik Henrik af Chapman to bolster the hitting @-@ power of the new Swedish maritime forces , to provide it with better naval defense and to improve its fire support capabilities during amphibious operations . The result was four new vessels that combined the maneuverability of oar @-@ powered galleys with the superior rigs and more comfortable living conditions of sailing ships : the udema , pojama , turuma and hemmema , named after the Finnish regions of Uusimaa ( " <unk> " in genitive form ) , Pohjanmaa , Turunmaa and Hämeenmaa ( Tavastia ) . All four have been referred to as skärgårdsfregatter , " archipelago frigates " , in Swedish and English historical literature , though the smaller udema and pojama were also described as " archipelago corvettes " originally . 
 = = Design = = 
 The first udema was built in 1760 and had two masts ( mainmast and foremast ) that were originally rigged with lateen sails . It was later provided with a square sail rig similar to that of a polacca bark without topgallant sails . It had a low hull with a small quarterdeck structure and an arrangement of guns that was unique for its time . Its main armament consisted of a single line of eight 12 @-@ pound guns along the centerline of the ship and two 12 @-@ pounders in the bow facing forwards . The centerline guns used pivoting carriages that could be rotated 360 degrees and aimed to either side of the ship , similar to the main guns of the dreadnought battleships of the 20th century . 
 The first udema Gamla was c . 30 m ( 100 ft ) long and with a draft of 1 @.@ 5 m ( 5 ft ) . The later udemas , Torborg and Ingeborg , carried a mizzen mast , and were both longer and wider , 37 m ( 121 ft ) long and almost 9 m ( 29 ft ) wide with a draft of just over 3 m ( 10 ft ) . Torborg , built in 1772 , had three additional 12 @-@ pounders , eleven in the centerline and two in the bow facing forwards , housed under a decked superstructure with gun ports , but with the rowing seats left undecked . This arrangement proved to be less successful with reports about problems with splintering and lingering gunpowder smoke . She was also a poor sailer and slow under oars , earning the udema a poor reputation . 
 The Ingeborg , built in 1776 , had an eight @-@ 12 @-@ pounder centerline armament which was open to the elements , but two heavy 18 @-@ pounders in the bow and two 6 @-@ pounder chase guns in the stern . The rowing benches with room for three men per bench were on either side of the centerline battery , but had to swing forwards and outwards to allow the guns to pivot to either side . 
 For additional maneuverability , the udema carried 14 to 18 pairs of oars . Rowers sat on the weather deck on either side of the main armament with the oar ports placed on a rectangular outrigger which improved their leverage . However , they were positioned on either side of the centerline battery and could not row under fire ; in action , the udema had to rely on its sails for propulsion . 
 The concept of hybrid frigates with oar propulsion capabilities was not new . Small " galleasses " had been built for the English Tudor navy as early as the mid @-@ 16th century . The Royal Navy , its successor , later equipped the equivalent of sixth rates with oar ports on or below the gundeck as early as the 1660s . " <unk> " , Baltic variations on the Mediterranean xebecs , had been introduced in the Russian navy for inshore duties during the 18th century . Both of these have been suggested as possible inspirations for af Chapman 's new designs . 
 = = Service = = 
 Only three udemas were built for the Swedish navy . Russian ship builders copied the Swedish designs , particularly around the time of the war of 1788 – 90 , and it is believed by some historians that a type named simply " secret vessel " could have been a Russian udema . Other historians question this conclusion ; the number of guns ( 44 in total ) may suggest a considerably larger turuma , one of the larger " archipelago frigates " . 
 The three Swedish udemas served in the Finnish archipelago squadrons throughout the war of 1788 – 90 by supporting amphibious operations , raiding the opposing Russian archipelago fleet , and protecting the left flank of the Swedish army 's operations on the Finnish mainland . <unk> fought in both the First and Second Battles of Svensksund . The latter battle , one of the largest naval battles ever fought , was a disastrous defeat for the Russians and one of Sweden 's greatest naval victories ever ; the udema Ingeborg was among the few Swedish vessels lost . 
 Like the other specialized archipelago vessels , the udema proved to have only limited advantages . While it had superior firepower , its sailing qualities were poor , even compared with galleys , and were slow even under oars . The unconventional artillery layout was also deemed to be too weak and radical . The Second Battle of Svensksund showed that the smaller gunboats and <unk> were far more efficient for the same operations and had almost entirely replaced the " archipelago frigates " by the Finnish War of 1808 – 09 , where Sweden finally lost all of its Finnish possessions . 
 = = Influence = = 
 Historian Lars @-@ Olof Berg suggests that the radical new design of rotating gun mounts , though somewhat of a disappointment in Swedish service , may have influenced shipbuilders in other countries . Russian floating batteries were equipped with similar mounts by 1790 . Designs were also presented and built in Great Britain and the US . <unk> mounts were used in the US " gunboat navy " under Thomas Jefferson , even in much smaller craft , though they often proved risky since the recoil could destabilize vessels with a small displacement , especially if the guns were fired over the side . The genuine breakthrough for true centerline armament layouts , however , did not come until the advent of armored steamships in the late 19th century . The name " udema " has been carried on in the <unk> Finnish form Uusimaa for 20th century ships of the Finnish navy .

 The Mass Transit Railway ( MTR ) is the rapid transit railway system in Hong Kong . Opened in 1979 , the system now includes 218 @.@ 2 km ( 135 @.@ 6 mi ) of rail with 155 stations , including 87 railway stations and 68 light rail stops . The MTR system is operated by MTR Corporation Limited ( MTRCL ) . It is one of the most profitable systems in the world , with a high farebox recovery ratio of 186 % . 
 Under the government 's rail @-@ led transport policy , the MTR system is a common mode of public transport in Hong Kong , with over five million trips made in an average weekday . It consistently achieves a 99 @.@ 9 % on @-@ time rate on its train journeys . As of 2014 , the MTR has a 48 @.@ 1 % market share of the franchised public transport market , making it the most popular transport option in Hong Kong . The integration of the Octopus smart card fare @-@ payment technology into the MTR system in September 1997 has further enhanced the ease of commuting on the MTR . 
 Construction of the MTR was prompted by a study , released in 1967 , commissioned by the Hong Kong Government in order to find solutions to the growing road congestion problem caused by the expansion of the territory 's economy . Construction started soon after the release of the study , and the first line opened in 1979 . The MTR was immediately popular with residents of Hong Kong ; as a result , subsequent lines have been built to cover more territory . There are continual debates regarding how and where to expand the MTR network . 
 As a successful railway operation , the MTR has served as a model for other newly built systems in the world , particularly in mainland China .

In 1966 , British transportation consultants Freeman , Fox , Wilbur Smith & Associates were appointed to study the transportation system of Hong Kong . The study was based on the projection of the population of Hong Kong for 1986 , estimated at 6 @,@ 868 @,@ 000 . On 1 September 1967 , the consultants submitted the Hong Kong Mass Transport Study to the government , which recommended the construction of a 40 @-@ mile ( 64 km ) rapid @-@ transit rail system in Hong Kong . The study suggested that four rail lines be developed in six stages , with a completion date set between December 1973 and December 1984 . Detailed positions of lines and stations were presented in the study . These four lines were Kwun Tong Line ( from Western Market to Ma Yau Tong ) , Tsuen Wan Line ( from Admiralty to Tsuen Wan ) , Island Line ( from Kennedy to Chai Wan Central ) , and <unk> Line ( from Tsim Sha Tsui to Wo Liu Hang ) . 
 The study was submitted to the Legislative Council on 14 February 1968 . The consultants received new data from the 1966 by @-@ census on 6 March 1968 . A short supplementary report was submitted on 22 March 1968 and amended in June 1968 . The by @-@ census indicated that the projected 1986 population was reduced by more than one million from the previous estimate to 5 @,@ 647 @,@ 000 . The dramatic reduction affected town planning . The population distribution was largely different from the original study . The projected 1986 populations of Castle Peak New Town , Sha Tin New Town , and , to a lesser extent , Tsuen Wan New Town , were revised downward , and the plan of a new town in Tseung Kwan O was shelved . In this updated scenario , the consultants reduced the scale of the recommended system . The supplementary report stated that the originally suggested four tracks between Admiralty Station and Mong Kok Station should be reduced to two , and only parts of the Island Line , Tsuen Wan Line , and Kwun Tong Line should be constructed for the initial system . The other lines would be placed in the list of extensions . This report led to the final study in 1970 . 
 In 1970 , a system with four lines was laid out and planned as part of the British consultants ' new report , Hong Kong Mass Transit : Further Studies . The four lines were to be the Kwun Tong Line , Tsuen Wan Line , Island Line , and East Kowloon Line . However , the lines that were eventually constructed were somewhat different compared to the lines that were originally proposed by the Hong Kong Mass Transport Study . 
 In 1972 , the Hong Kong government authorised construction of the Initial System , a 20 @-@ kilometre ( 12 mi ) system that roughly translates to the Kwun Tong Line between Kwun Tong and Prince Edward , Tsuen Wan Line between Prince Edward and Admiralty , and Island Line between Sheung Wan and Admiralty of today . Negotiations with four major construction consortia started in 1973 . The government 's intention was to tender the entire project , based on the British design , as a single tender at a fixed price . A consortium from Japan signed an agreement to construct the system in early 1974 , but in December of the same year , it pulled out of the agreement for reasons stemming from fears of the oil crisis . 
 = = = Modified Initial System = = = 
 Several weeks later , in early 1975 , a government agency called the Mass Transport Provisional Authority was established to oversee the project . It announced that the Initial System would be reduced to 15 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 7 mi ) , and renamed it the " Modified Initial System " . Plans for a single contract were abandoned in favour of 25 engineering contracts and 10 electrical and mechanical contracts . In addition , the government @-@ owned Mass Transit Railway Corporation ( MTRC ) was established to replace the Mass Transport Provisional Authority . 
 Construction of the Modified Initial System ( now part of the Kwun Tong Line and Tsuen Wan Line ) commenced in November 1975 . The northern section was completed on 30 September 1979 and was opened on 1 October 1979 by Governor Murray MacLehose . Trains on this route ran from Shek Kip Mei Station to Kwun Tong Station , initially in a four @-@ car configuration . The first train drivers were trained on the London Underground . The route from Tsim Sha Tsui Station to Shek Kip Mei Station opened in December 1979 . The early stations were designed under the supervision of Roland Paoletti , the chief architect at MTR . 
 In 1980 , the first harbour crossing was made by an MTR train as the Kwun Tong Line was extended to Chater Station , since renamed Central Station . Trains were extended to six cars to accommodate an increase in passenger numbers . 
 = = = Line extensions = = = 
 The government approved construction of the Tsuen Wan Line in 1977 , then known as the Tsuen Wan Extension , and works commenced in November 1978 . The project added a 10 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometre ( 6 @.@ 5 mi ) section to the MTR system , from Prince Edward to Tsuen Wan . The line started service on 10 May 1982 with a total cost of construction ( not adjusted for inflation ) of HK $ 4 @.@ 1 billion ( US $ 526 million ) . The plan was modified from that in the 1970 report Hong Kong Mass Transit : Further Studies , with Kwai Chung Station , Lap Sap Wan Station , and a planned depot at Kwai Chung next to Lap Sap Wan Station being replaced by stations at Kwai Hing and Kwai Fong and a depot at Tsuen Wan . Several stations also had names different to that during planning : So Uk Station became Cheung Sha Wan , Cheung Sha Wan became Lai Chi Kok , and Lai Chi Kok became Lai Wan ( later renamed as Mei Foo ) . 
 When service of this line started , the section of the Kwun Tong Line from Chater to Argyle ( since renamed Central and Mong Kok stations respectively ) was transferred to the Tsuen Wan Line . Thus , Waterloo station ( since renamed Yau Ma Tei Station ) became the terminus of the Kwun Tong Line , and both Argyle and Prince Edward stations became interchange stations . This change was made because system planners expected the traffic of the Tsuen Wan Line to exceed that of the Kwun Tong Line . This forecast proved to be accurate , necessitating a bypass from the northwestern New Territories to Hong Kong Island . The Tung Chung Line was therefore launched in 1998 with an interchange station at Lai King for that purpose . 
 Although land acquisitions were made for a station at Tsuen Wan West , beyond Tsuen Wan station , as part of the Tsuen Wan branch , the station was never built . This is not to be confused with the modern @-@ day Tsuen Wan West Station on West Rail Line , which lies on a newly reclaimed area near the former ferry pier . 
 Since opening in 1982 , the Tsuen Wan Line is the line whose alignment has remained the same for the longest time . For example , the Kwun Tong Line 's alignment has changed twice since its opening – the taking over of Tsuen Wan Line from Mong Kok to Central , and the taking over of Eastern Harbour Crossing section by the Tseung Kwan O Line . 
 Government approvals were granted for construction of the Island Line in December 1980 . Construction commenced in October 1981 . On 31 May 1985 , the Island Line was opened with service between Admiralty Station and Chai Wan Station . Both Admiralty and Central Stations became interchange stations with the Tsuen Wan Line . Furthermore , each train was extended to eight cars . On 23 May 1986 , the Island Line was extended to Sheung Wan Station . Construction was delayed for one year , as government offices which were located over the station had to be moved before the construction could start . 
 In 1984 , the government approved the construction of the Eastern Harbour Crossing , a tunnel to be used by cars and MTR trains . The Kwun Tong Line was extended across the harbour on 5 August 1989 to Quarry Bay Station , which became an interchange station for the Kwun Tong Line and the Island Line . An intermediate station , Lam Tin , started operations on 1 October 1989 . 
 = = = Airport connection = = = 
 The Airport Express and Tung Chung Line started services in 1998 . The decision was made in October 1989 to construct a new international airport at <unk> Lap Kok on Lantau Island to replace the overcrowded Kai Tak International Airport . The government invited the MTRC to build a train line , then known as the Lantau Airport Railway , to the airport . Construction started in November 1994 , after the Chinese and British governments settled their financial and land disagreements . 
 The new line was included in the financing plans of the new Hong Kong International Airport as the airport was not considered viable without direct public transport links . Construction costs were also shared by the MTRC , which was granted many large @-@ scale developments in the construction plans for the new stations . 
 The Lantau Airport Railway turned into two MTR lines , the Tung Chung Line and the Airport Express . The Tung Chung Line was officially opened on 21 June 1998 by Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa , and service commenced the next day . The Airport Express opened for service on 6 July 1998 along with the new Hong Kong International Airport . 
 The Airport Express also offers flight check @-@ in facilities at Kowloon Station and Hong Kong Station – the in @-@ town check @-@ ins offer a more convenient and time @-@ saving routine ; a free shuttle bus service transports travellers from these stations to their respective hotels as well . Porters are also available to help transport luggage from and onto trains . It is the second most popular means of transport to the airport after buses . In 2012 , it had a 21 @.@ 8 % of share of the traffic to and from the airport . However , this has drastically declined from a peak of 32 % in 1999 .

 = = = Tseung Kwan O Line = = = 
 The Quarry Bay Congestion Relief Works extended the Hong Kong Island end of the Kwun Tong Line from Quarry Bay to North Point via a pair of 2 @.@ 1 @-@ kilometre ( 1 @.@ 3 mi ) tunnels . The project was initiated due to overcrowding at Quarry Bay and persistent passenger complaints about the five @-@ minute walk from the Island Line platforms to the Kwun Tong Line platform . Construction began in September 1997 and was completed in September 2001 at a cost of HK $ 3 @.@ 0 billion ( US $ 385 million ) . As with most earlier interchange stations , a cross @-@ platform interchange arrangement was provided here in both directions . 
 Construction of the Tseung Kwan O Line ( called the Tseung Kwan O Extension Line in the planning stage ) was approved on 18 August 1998 to serve new housing developments . Construction began on 24 April 1999 and the line officially opened in 2002 . It took over the existing Kwun Tong Line tracks running through the Eastern Harbour Tunnel , so that the full line stretches from Po Lam to North Point . When the line was opened , the Kwun Tong Line was diverted to Tiu Keng Leng on the new line . Construction costs were partly covered by the Hong Kong Government and private developers which linked construction of the Tseung Kwan O Line to new real estate and commercial developments . 
 = = = Interchange stations = = = 
 The interchange between the Tsuen Wan Line and the Kwun Tong Line , as well as that between the Kwun Tong Line and the Tseung Kwan O Line , are two stations long , allowing cross @-@ platform interchange wherein a passenger leaves a train on one side of the platform and boards trains on the other side of the platform for another line . For example , when passengers are travelling on the Kwun Tong Line towards Tiu Keng Leng , getting off at Yau Tong would allow them to switch trains across the platform for the Tseung Kwan O Line towards North Point . Whereas , staying on the train and reaching Tiu Keng Leng would allow them to board the Tseung Kwan O Line trains towards Po Lam / LOHAS Park . This design makes interchanging more convenient and passengers do not have the need to change to different levels . However this interchange arrangement is not available for all transferring passengers at Kowloon Tong , Central , Hong Kong , Quarry Bay , Nam Cheong ( except transfer between Tuen Mun and Hong Kong bound trains ) , Mei Foo , Tai Wai Station ( except alighting from Ma On Shan Line to change to southbound trains for East Rail Line ) and Sunny Bay ( except transfer between Tung Chung and Disneyland Resort bound trains ) stations , mainly because this service is available only when there are two continuous stations shared as interchange stations by two lines . 
 Two major works were undertaken to ease interchange between the Kwun Tong Line and East Rail Line . The modification of Kowloon Tong Station started in June 2001 . A new pedestrian link to Kowloon Tong Station southern concourse and a new entrance ( Exit D ) opened on 15 April 2004 to cope with the increase in interchange passenger flow . Modification to Tsim Sha Tsui Station involved upgrading station facilities and concourse layout to facilitate access from the East Tsim Sha Tsui Station via its pedestrian links . New entrances to the subway links were opened on 19 September 2004 ( Exit G ) and 30 March 2005 ( Exit F ) , with the whole scheme completed in May 2005 .

It is a 3 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometre ( 2 @.@ 2 mi ) single @-@ track railway that runs between Sunny Bay station and Disneyland Resort station . The Disneyland Resort station itself was designed to blend in with the ambiance of the resort . The line operates fully automated trains running every four to ten minutes without a driver . The carriages are refurbished M @-@ Train rolling stock to match the recreational and adventurous nature of the 3 @.@ 5 @-@ minute journey .

 The AsiaWorld – Expo Station is an extension of the Airport Express serving a new international exhibition centre , AsiaWorld – Expo , at Hong Kong International Airport . The station opened on 20 December 2005 along with the exhibition centre . To cope with the projected increase in patronage , Airport Express trains were lengthened to eight carriages from the previous seven . Additional trains are also deployed on the Tung Chung Line during major exhibitions and events . 
 = = = Privatisation and merger = = = 
 On 5 October 2000 the operator of the MTR network , MTR Corporation Limited ( MTRCL ) , became Hong Kong 's first rail company to be privatised , marking the beginning of the Hong Kong government 's initiative to dissolve its interests in public utilities . Prior to its listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange , the Mass Transit Railway Corporation ( MTRC ) was wholly owned by the Hong Kong government . The offering involved the sale of about one billion shares , and the company now has the largest shareholder base of any company listed in Hong Kong . In June 2001 , MTRCL was transferred to the Hang Seng Index . 
 MTRCL has often developed properties next to stations to complement its already profitable railway business . Many recently built stations were incorporated into large housing estates or shopping complexes . For example , Tsing Yi station is built next to the Maritime Square shopping centre and directly underneath the Tierra Verde housing estate . 
 On 11 April 2006 , MTRCL signed a non @-@ binding memorandum of understanding with the Hong Kong government , the owner of Kowloon @-@ Canton Railway Corporation , to merge the operation of the two railway networks in Hong Kong in spite of the strong opposition by the KCRC staff . The minority shareholders of the corporation approved the proposal at an extraordinary general meeting on 9 October 2007 , allowing MTRCL to take over the operation of the KCR network and combine the fare system of the two networks on 2 December 2007 . 
 On 2 December 2007 the Kowloon – Canton Railway Corporation ( KCRC ) granted a 50 @-@ year service concession ( which may be extended ) of the KCR network to MTRCL , in return for making annual payments to KCRC , thereby merging the railway operations of the two corporations under MTRCL 's management . At the same time MTRCL changed its Chinese name from " <unk> " ( Subway Limited Company ) to " <unk> " ( Hong Kong Railway Limited Company ) , but left its English name unchanged . After the merger , the MTR network included three more lines — East Rail Line , West Rail Line , and Ma On Shan Line — as well as the Light Rail network and Guangdong Through Train to Guangzhou . 
 On 28 September 2008 , fare zones of all urban lines , East Rail Line , Ma On Shan Line and West Rail Line were merged . A passenger could travel on these networks with only one ticket , except where a transfer is made between Tsim Sha Tsui and East Tsim Sha Tsui stations , where two tickets are required . Student discounts on Octopus Card were also issued .

 The West Island Line , first put forward to the government on 21 January 2003 , is an extension of the Island Line . It serves the Western District of Hong Kong Island . The construction of the West Island Line started on 10 August 2009 . Kennedy Town Station and HKU Station opened on 28 December 2014 . Sai Ying Pun Station opened later , on 29 March 2015 , due to construction delays . 
 = = = Future expansions = = = 
 Several future projects on the MTR have been put forward by MTRCL to the Hong Kong Government , with some already under construction . The network was expanded significantly with the merger of MTRCL and the government @-@ owned KCRC . A non @-@ binding Memorandum of Understanding was signed on the eleventh of April 2006 to grant MTRCL operation of the existing KCR network with a service concession of 50 years . The new Sha Tin to Central Link that was originally awarded to KCRC is also to be operated by MTRCL . 
 Provisions are made to upgrade the existing infrastructure of the MTR . New subway links to the stations are also being made for better access . A further proposal to extend the existing Kwun Tong Line to Whampoa Garden , together in a tie @-@ up with the Sha Tin to Central Link expansion have been made in April 2006 . In March 2008 , the MTR Corporation welcomed the Government 's decision for the Corporation to proceed with further planning and design for the Kwun Tong Line Extension and the <unk> to Central Link . The construction of the Kwun Tong Line Extension is expected to be completed at the end of 2016 . The Sha Tin to Central Link from Tai Wai to Hung Hom is expected to be completed in 2019 , and the section from Hung Hom to Admiralty is expected to be completed in 2021 . 
 The South Island Line , first put forward to the government by MTRCL on 21 January 2003 , only received approval on 30 June 2005 after its heavily modified fourth proposal . This consisted of the South Island Line ( East ) from Admiralty to South Horizons and the South Island Line ( West ) that connects HKU to Wong <unk> Hang . The South Island Line ( East ) is expected to be finished by the end of 2016 . 
 The Northern Link will be a new line which connects West Rail Line with the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line of East Rail Line . It also has Au Tau , <unk> Tam Mei , San Tin , a future interchange station between East Rail Line and Northern Link , <unk> Tung and finally Lok Ma Chau , which will become a terminus for both lines , just like Hung Hom nowadays . 
 The North Island Line is a planned extension of the Tseung Kwan O Line that will interchange at the future Tamar Station with the Tung Chung Line . It will alleviate traffic in the Northern part of Hong Kong Island . There will be three new stations : Tamar , Exhibition ( which will be an interchange between the North Island Line and the North South Corridor ) , and Causeway Bay North . Construction is expected to begin in 2021 and finish in 2026 . The cost is estimated to be HK $ 20 billion in 2013 prices .

 The architecture of MTR stations is less artistic , instead focusing on structural practicability . With the high level of daily passenger traffic , facilities of the MTR stations are built with durability and accessibility in mind . After extensive retrofitting , the MTR system has become , in general , disabled @-@ friendly — the trains have dedicated wheelchair space , the stations have special floor tiles to guide the blind safely on the platforms , and there are extra wide entry and exit gates for wheelchairs as well . On board the rolling stock , there are also flashing system maps on select trains while Active Line Diagrams and traditional route maps are installed on the others . <unk> as well as on Newsline Express TVs onboard trains display important messages such as next station announcements as well as operational messages . 
 = = = = Telecommunications = = = = 
 A full GSM ( GSM @-@ 900 and GSM @-@ 1800 ) , CDMA and <unk> mobile phone network is in place throughout the MTR system of stations and tunnels allowing passengers to stay connected underground . Currently , full 3G network coverage in all stations and tunnels ( except underground section on East Rail Line and West Rail Line ) for the MTR system has been provided by 3 Hong Kong , <unk> @-@ Vodafone and <unk> Mobile . Passengers with subscription services will be able to make video calls and access high speed video content on their mobile phones regardless whether the train is above ground or under ground . The MTR has already extended the Wi @-@ Fi service to all of the Airport Express trains and the expansion of the service to other MTR routes is still under consideration by MTR . As of 8 July 2013 , all 84 stations on the MTR offer free Wi @-@ Fi service to passengers with a limitation of 15 minutes per session and a maximum of five sessions per day . 
 In late 2015 it was announced that all 400 payphones in the MTR system would be removed in early 2016 . The contract with the service provider , <unk> Telecom , was expiring , and the MTR Corporation said that no one had tendered a proposal to take over the contract . 
 = = = = Announcements = = = = 
 When the transport started , announcements of information including arriving stations were made in British English and in Cantonese . Since 2004 , in order to accommodate Mainland Chinese visitors under the Individual Visit Scheme , Standard Mandarin Chinese has been added to the repertory . 
 = = = = Public toilets = = = = 
 Unlike many other metro systems around the world , " main line " MTR stations originally did not have toilet facilities available for public use . Passengers may use MTR staff toilets at all stations on request . In 2006 , MTRCL said it would not consider retrofitting existing underground toilets , because of the challenge of installing new piping and toilet facilities . Only stations on the Airport Express and Disneyland Resort Line had access to toilet facilities . All former KCR stations ( on the East Rail Line , West Rail Line , and Ma On Shan Line ) , merged into the MTR network in 2007 , have public toilets . 
 During Legco Rail Merger Bill discussions , MTR Corporation received criticism from Hong Kong Legislative Council Members for their unwillingness to install toilet facilities in main line stations . MTRCL indicated in rail merger discussions that it would carry out a review of the feasibility of installing public toilets at or in the vicinity of its above @-@ ground railway stations . Discussions between the Government and MTRCL have taken into account Legco members ' request for a stronger commitment by the corporation to the provision of public toilets on new railway lines . This resulted in MTRCL agreeing to include the provision of toilet facilities within , or adjacent to , stations in the overall design parameters for all future new railway lines , subject to planning and regulatory approval and any concerns raised by residents in the vicinity about the location of external ventilation exhausts . 
 <unk> have since been retrofitted into several existing MTR stations , including Sheung Wan Station , <unk> Tau Kok Station , Quarry Bay Station , Mong Kok Station , and Prince Edward Station . In addition , newly opened stations such as those of the West Island Line have toilets . The MTR plans to install public toilets at all interchange stations by 2020 . 
 = = = = Commerce and journals = = = = 
 Prior to the privatisation of MTRC , MTR stations only had branches of the Hang Seng Bank , and Maxim 's Cakes stores , and a handful of other shops . Since then , the number and types of shops have increased at certain stations , turning them into miniature shopping centres . ATMs and convenience stores are now commonplace . 
 The MTR has contracted with publishers for the distribution of free magazines and newspapers in MTR stations . Recruit was the first free magazine which was solely distributed in stations ( before railway merger ) since July 1992 , but the contract was terminated in July 2002 . Another recruitment magazine Jiu <unk> ( <unk> ) , published by South China Morning Post , replaced Recruit as the only free recruitment magazine distributed in MTR stations bi @-@ weekly . The Metropolis Daily ( <unk> ) , published by Metro International , is the first free newspaper distributed free in MTR stations during weekdays ( except public holidays ) ; and in 2005 , there is another weekend newspaper Express Post ( <unk> ) , distributed every Saturday except public holidays . The Metropop ( <unk> ) , a weekly magazine featuring cultural affairs and city trends also published by Metro International , started its distribution in MTR stations every Thursday since 27 April 2006 , a few months after the termination of Hui Kai Guide ( <unk> Guide ) in 2006 . MTR Stations on ex @-@ KCR lines feature two free Chinese @-@ language newspapers , namely <unk> and Headline Daily . MTR promotes reading of these newspapers by adding special coupons and promotion offers inside the newspapers , for example , a free trip to Lok Ma Chau or a free keyring . On the Kwun Tong Line , East Rail Line , Ma On Shan Line and West Rail Line , Newsline Express is available . 
 = = = MTR Bus = = = 
 At various stations of the MTR network , the MTRCL ( which took over from KCR ) has set up feeder buses which enhance the convenience of taking the MTR . These bus routes , which normally consist of one to two stops , terminate at housing estates and go past major landmarks . The feeder bus routes on the East Rail Line are run under the MTR name but are operated by Kowloon Motor Bus .

 Six types of Electric Multiple Unit rolling stock operate on the MTR network and four generations of light rail vehicles operate on the Light Rail network . All utilise either 1 @,@ 432 mm ( 4 ft 8 3 ⁄ 8 in ) rail gauge ( near standard gauge ) or 1 @,@ 435 mm ( 4 ft 8 1 ⁄ 2 in ) ( standard gauge ) . Except for Airport Express trains , all trains are designed with features to cope with high density passenger traffic on frequently used services , for example , seating arrangements , additional ventilation fans , and additional sets of extra wide doors . These configurations allow the MTR to run at 101 @,@ 000 passengers per hour per direction ( p / h / d ) on its busy suburban East Rail Line and 85 @,@ 000 p / h / d on its urban metro network .

The M @-@ Train uses sliding doors , unlike K @-@ Stocks and Grupo CAF Trains which use plug doors . They are in service on Kwun Tong Line , Tsuen Wan Line , Island Line and Tseung Kwan O Line . 
 Except for Airport Express and Disneyland Resort Line trains , all trains are designed with features to cope with high density passenger traffic on frequently used services . The Disneyland Resort Line uses driverless M @-@ Trains with their appearance overhauled to suit the atmosphere and theme of the line .

 The contract ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) for 10 new sets of trains was awarded to Changchun Railway Vehicles Co . Limited in October 2008 with a further 12 trains ordered in the summer of 2011 . These MTR trains were delivered to Hong Kong between 2011 and 2013 to enhance train frequency on the existing lines to cater for ongoing patronage growth on the existing Island Line , Kwun Tong Line , Tsuen Wan Line and Tseung Kwan O Line . These trains will feature new 22 " LCD TVs , like their counterpart trains on former @-@ KCR lines equipped with Newsline Express , offering better infotainment such as news and announcements . The first of these trains entered revenue service on 7 December 2011 on the Kwun Tong Line . They are tested service on Tsuen Wan Line and Tseung Kwan O Line . They have also been tested running on the Island Line , but have not been in service yet . 
 = = = = SP1900 / 1950 EMU = = = = 
 Both East Rail Line and West Rail Line use the SP1900 while Ma On Shan Line uses <unk> , a shorter model of the SP1900 . The electrification system used on these lines is 25 kV AC , 50 Hz , as opposed to the 1 @.@ 5 – kV DC used on the urban lines . Should the need arise in the future , dual voltage trains such as those utilised on Oresund Bridge would be required . 
 These two models of rolling stock are from the former KCRC network ( KCR East Rail , West Rail and Ma On Shan Rail ) . They did not receive major changes after the merger of the two companies except for the updated route map , the exterior company logo and such . The capability of this EMU fleet is similar to those on the urban network .

 Rolling stock running on the Light Rail system were ordered from three different manufacturers : Commonwealth Engineering ( <unk> ) , Kawasaki Heavy Industries and United <unk> . They are designed to run on the standard gauge and utilize 750 V DC through overhead lines . Trams are usually operated with one or two carriages while the second carriage functions as only a trailer . The arrangement allows each car to load approximately 300 passengers with 26 seats , while four sets of poach seats provide flexible riding for passengers . 
 In addition , the Light Rail will be modernised as part of a 20th Anniversary Activity according to the MTR . Trains will include better disabled facilities as well as a totally new interior . The MTR will refurbish 69 older trains and buy 22 new ones . The first trains have been completed and were scheduled to be put into service in November 2009 . The whole project is expected to be completed in 2011 . 
 = = Fares and tickets = = 
 After the rail merger , there are three different fare classes on the MTR : Adult , Students and Concessionary . Only children below the age of 12 and senior citizens 65 years or older are eligible for the concessionary rate on all lines . Full @-@ time Hong Kong students between the ages of 12 and 25 qualify for the concessionary rate using a personalized Octopus Card on all lines except on Airport Express , or travel to or from cross @-@ border stations ( Lo Wu / Lok Ma Chau ) . Children below the age of 3 travel free ( unless they exceed the height range ) . 
 The fare of MTR between any two particular stations is not calculated using a particular formula , and must be lookup up from the fare table . Fares for the Airport Express Line are significantly higher . Services to checkpoint termini are also more expensive than ordinary fares . Adult fares range from HK $ 3 @.@ 6 to $ 52 @.@ 6 ( US $ 0 @.@ 46 – 6 @.@ 74 ) . Concessionary fares are usually half the adult fare , and range from HK $ 1 @.@ 50 to $ 27 @.@ 00 . Student fares are the same as child and elderly fare on the urban lines , but are the same as the Adult fares for journeys to or from checkpoint termini , and range from HK $ 1 @.@ 50 to $ 51 @.@ 00 . The fare is subject to adjustment in June every year . 
 Prior to May 2009 , MTR did not provide concessionary fares for the disabled . Legislators such as social welfare constituency legislator Fernando Cheung Chiu @-@ hung and those from Hong Kong 's Association for Democracy and People 's Livelihood had for years demanded that such concessions be put in place . In May 2009 , MTR eventually agreed to offer the disabled concessionary fares with HK $ 2 million sponsorship from Transport and Housing Bureau and under the condition that Legislative Council amends the Disability Discrimination Ordinance . 
 Single journey tickets and Octopus card reloads can be purchased at vending machines while tourist passes , Octopus cards and other special tickets must be purchased at the ticket counter . Credit cards are only accepted to purchase Airport Express tickets . 
 = = = Octopus cards = = = 
 The Octopus card is a rechargeable contactless smart card used in an electronic payment system in Hong Kong developed by Australian company ERG Group . It was launched in September 1997 for use on the MTR ( and KCR , now operated by MTR ) and now is the most widely used electronic cash system for transactions in Hong Kong as many retailers ( including supermarkets , car parks and fast food outlets ) are fitted with readers . The technology used was Sony 's <unk> line of smartcard . The Octopus card uses radio frequency identification ( RFID ) technology so that users need only hold the card in front of the reader , without taking it out of handbags and wallets . 
 Except for the Airport Express , MTR fares are slightly lower when using an Octopus card compared to using single journey tickets . For example , the cost of the three @-@ minute journey from Admiralty to Tsim Sha Tsui across the Victoria Harbour is ( as of September 2015 ) HK $ 9 @.@ 4 using the Octopus card , compared with HK $ 10 @.@ 0 for a single @-@ journey ticket .

 The Tourist Day Pass gives tourists unlimited MTR rides for one day ( with the exception of MTR Bus routes , the First Class of the East Rail Line , the Airport Express , as well as journeys to and from Lo Wu , Lok Ma Chau and Racecourse stations ) . Each pass costs HK $ 55 and are available at all the MTR Customer Service Centres . Tourist Day Pass must be used within 30 days upon the day of issue . The Airport Express Tourist Octopus Cards are also available . Cardholders may enjoy three days of unlimited rides on the MTR ( except Airport Express , East Rail Line First Class , Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau stations ) refundable deposit of HK $ 50 and choice of either a single ( HK $ 220 ) or round trip ( HK $ 300 ) on the Airport Express .

 Since the merger in 2007 , MTR has consistently achieved a 99 @.@ 9 % on @-@ time rate , meaning out of the 5 @.@ 2 million passengers on average each working day , 5 @.@ 195 million passengers arrive within 5 minutes of scheduled time . This makes MTR one of the most efficient rapid transit systems on the planet . MTR must report all delays of more than eight minutes to the government . There were 143 reportable incidents in 2013 . MTR is fined HK $ 1 million for having delays of 31 minutes to an hour , with higher fines for longer delays . 
 = = Regulations and safety = = 
 According to the Mass Transit Railway By @-@ Law , eating or drinking , and smoking are not allowed in the paid area of stations or in trains . Offenders will be fined up to HK $ 5000 . 
 Various campaigns and activities are taken to help ensure that the MTR is a safe system to travel on . Poster campaigns displaying information on topics such as escalator safety are a common sight in all MTR stations , and announcements are made regularly as safety reminders to travelling passengers . Bylaws were also introduced to deter potentially dangerous actions on the MTR , such as the ban on flammable goods on the MTR and rushing into trains when the doors are closing . Penalties ranging from fines to imprisonment have been imposed for such offences . 
 Police officers patrol the trains and stations , and police posts are available at some stations . The Hong Kong Police Force has a Railway District responsible for the MTR . Closed @-@ circuit television cameras are installed in stations and on some of the newer trains . 
 The entire Tung Chung Line and Airport Express , as well those stations added by the Tseung Kwan O Line , has platform screen doors ( PSDs ) , ordered from Swiss glass door manufacturer Kaba <unk> AG , installed upon construction . So does the entire West Rail Line ( except Hung Hom Station ) , inherited from KCR . These doors make platforms safer by preventing people from falling onto the rails , even though MTRCL did not heavily promote it directly . However , the primary motivation was to separate the stations from the tunnels , hence allowing substantial energy savings on station air @-@ conditioning and tunnel ventilation . Automatic platform gates ( <unk> ) have also been installed at the Sunny Bay and Disneyland Resort stations . Their heights are half of the PSDs and only prevent people from falling onto the rails . MTR has finished installing the <unk> on all of the above @-@ ground stations of the MTR except on the East Rail and Ma On Shan lines ; they will be installed there as part of the Sha Tin to Central Link project . 
 In June 2000 , MTRCL proceeded with its plans to retrofit 2 @,@ 960 pairs of platform screen doors at all 30 underground stations on the Kwun Tong Line , Tsuen Wan Line , and Island Line in a six @-@ year programme . The programme made MTR the world 's first railway to undertake the retrofitting of PSDs on a passenger @-@ carrying system already in operation . A prototype design was first introduced at Choi Hung Station in the 3rd quarter of 2001 . The whole installation scheme was completed in October 2005 , ahead of the forecast completion date in 2006 . MTRCL said that part of the cost had to be assumed by passengers . HK $ 0 @.@ 10 per passenger trip was levied on Octopus card users to help fund the HK $ 2 billion retrofit programme . This levy was ended in 2013 after raising more than HK $ 1 billion .

 The service was founded because of the dissatisfaction of the MTR on handling the message of service disruptions . The service was based on one provided for the London Underground . Because the service is user @-@ driven , the involvement of passengers is very important . The MTR Service update team are now facing the problem on no data source in the areas which have a low level of participation , such as Tseung Kwan O.

The MTR Corporation admitted that 34 trees were felled by mistake ; all were common native woodland species and no rare tree species were affected . The corporation said owing to a technical misalignment of relevant drawings , the plan submitted to the Environmental Protection Department did not include the part of the Conservation Area which was included in the <unk> plan of their works .

 The corporation has limits on the size of items allowed on trains . The MTR system is facing pressure from the increasing number of passengers transporting goods and other oversized baggage , and is apparently overwhelmed by parallel traders , and was criticised for allowing parallel traders to board trains with their exports . It was accused of double standards in enforcement when while images of passengers pushing overladen trollies are appearing on social network sites on a regular basis , whilst students carrying large musical instruments are reported to have been stopped and issued with written warnings . Leading musicians also joined in the criticism of MTR 's unreasonable stance on large instruments ; some citizens invited players of celli and other large instruments to congregate on 3 October 2015 with their equipment at Tai Wai Station , where the majority of these instances occurred . Following the public uproar , MTR issued a press release in the early hours on acknowledged societal discontent and announced a one @-@ month review of the policy on oversized items to see whether there was room for fine @-@ tuning that would not compromise on passenger safety . The corporation said that staff would continue executing existing policy until any revisions are made . 
 = Woolly mammoth = 
 The woolly mammoth ( Mammuthus primigenius ) is a species of mammoth that lived during the Pleistocene epoch , and was one of the last in a line of mammoth species , beginning with Mammuthus subplanifrons in the early Pliocene . The woolly mammoth diverged from the steppe mammoth about 400 @,@ 000 years ago in eastern Asia . Its closest extant relative is the Asian elephant . The appearance and behaviour of this species are among the best studied of any prehistoric animal because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in Siberia and Alaska , as well as skeletons , teeth , stomach contents , dung , and depiction from life in prehistoric cave paintings . Mammoth remains had long been known in Asia before they became known to Europeans in the 17th century . The origin of these remains was long a matter of debate , and often explained as being remains of legendary creatures . The mammoth was identified as an extinct species of elephant by Georges Cuvier in 1796 . 
 The woolly mammoth was roughly the same size as modern African elephants . Males reached shoulder heights between 2 @.@ 7 and 3 @.@ 4 m ( 8 @.@ 9 and 11 @.@ 2 ft ) and weighed up to 6 tonnes ( 6 @.@ 6 short tons ) . Females averaged 2 @.@ 6 – 2 @.@ 9 metres ( 8 @.@ 5 – 9 @.@ 5 ft ) in height and weighed up to 4 tonnes ( 4 @.@ 4 short tons ) . A newborn calf weighed about 90 kilograms ( 200 lb ) . The woolly mammoth was well adapted to the cold environment during the last ice age . It was covered in fur , with an outer covering of long guard hairs and a shorter undercoat . The colour of the coat varied from dark to light . The ears and tail were short to minimise frostbite and heat loss . It had long , curved tusks and four molars , which were replaced six times during the lifetime of an individual . Its behaviour was similar to that of modern elephants , and it used its tusks and trunk for manipulating objects , fighting , and foraging . The diet of the woolly mammoth was mainly grass and sedges . Individuals could probably reach the age of 60 . Its habitat was the mammoth steppe , which stretched across northern Eurasia and North America . 
 The woolly mammoth coexisted with early humans , who used its bones and tusks for making art , tools , and dwellings , and the species was also hunted for food . It disappeared from its mainland range at the end of the Pleistocene 10 @,@ 000 years ago , most likely through climate change and consequent shrinkage of its habitat , hunting by humans , or a combination of the two . Isolated populations survived on St. Paul Island until 6 @,@ 400 years ago and Wrangel Island until 4 @,@ 000 years ago . After its extinction , humans continued using its ivory as a raw material , a tradition that continues today . It has been proposed the species could be recreated through cloning , but this method is as yet infeasible because of the degraded state of the remaining genetic material . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Remains of various extinct elephants were known by Europeans for centuries , but were generally interpreted , based on biblical accounts , as the remains of legendary creatures such as behemoths or giants . It was also theorised that they were remains of modern elephants that had been brought to Europe during the Roman Republic , for example the war elephants of Hannibal and Pyrrhus of Epirus , or animals that had wandered north . The first woolly mammoth remains studied by European scientists were examined by Hans Sloane in 1728 and consisted of fossilised teeth and tusks from Siberia . Sloane was the first to recognise that the remains belonged to elephants . Sloane turned to another biblical explanation for the presence of elephants in the Arctic , asserting that they had been buried during the Great Flood , and that Siberia had previously been tropical prior to a drastic climate change . Others interpreted Sloane 's conclusion slightly differently , arguing the flood had carried elephants from the Tropics to the Arctic . Sloane 's paper was based on travellers ' descriptions and a few scattered bones collected in Siberia and Britain . He discussed the question of whether or not the remains were from elephants , but drew no conclusions . In 1738 , Johann Philipp Breyne argued that mammoth fossils represented some kind of elephant . He could not explain why a tropical animal would be found in such a cold area as Siberia , and suggested that they might have been transported there by the Great Flood . In 1796 , French anatomist Georges Cuvier was the first to identify the woolly mammoth remains not as modern elephants transported to the Arctic , but as an entirely new species . He argued this species had gone extinct and no longer existed , a concept that was not widely accepted at the time . 
 Following Cuvier 's identification , Johann Friedrich Blumenbach gave the woolly mammoth its scientific name , Elephas primigenius , in 1799 , placing it in the same genus as the Asian elephant . This name is Latin for " first elephant " . Cuvier coined the name Elephas <unk> a few months later , but the former name was subsequently used . In 1828 , Joshua Brookes used the name Mammuthus borealis for woolly mammoth fossils in his collection that he put up for sale , thereby coining a new genus name . It is unclear where and how the word " mammoth " originated . According to the Oxford English Dictionary , it comes from an old <unk> word <unk> ' earth @-@ horn ' . It may be a version of <unk> , the Arabic version of the biblical word " behemoth " . Another possible origin is Estonian , where maa means earth , and mutt means mole . The word was first used in Europe during the early 17th century , when referring to <unk> tusks discovered in Siberia . Thomas Jefferson , who had a keen interest in palaeontology , is partially responsible for transforming the word mammoth from a noun describing the prehistoric elephant to an adjective describing anything of surprisingly large size . The first recorded use of the word as an adjective was in a description of a wheel of cheese ( the " Cheshire Mammoth Cheese " ) given to Jefferson in 1802 . 
 The taxonomy of extinct elephants was complicated by the early 20th century , and in 1942 , Henry Fairfield Osborn 's posthumous monograph on the Proboscidea was published , wherein he used various taxon names that had previously been proposed for mammoth species , including replacing Mammuthus with <unk> , as he believed the former name to be invalidly published . Mammoth taxonomy was simplified by various researchers from the 1970s onwards , all species were retained in the genus Mammuthus , and many proposed differences between species were instead interpreted as intraspecific variation . Osborn chose two molars ( found in Siberia and <unk> ) from Blumenbach 's collection at Göttingen University as the lectotype specimens for the woolly mammoth , since holotype designation was not practised in Blumenbach 's time . Vera Gromova further proposed the former should be considered the lectotype with the latter as paralectotype . Both molars were thought lost by the 1980s , and the more complete " <unk> mammoth " found in Siberia in 1948 was therefore proposed as the neotype specimen in 1990 . Resolutions to historical issues about the validity of the genus name Mammuthus and the type species designation of E. primigenius were also proposed . The paralectotype molar ( specimen <unk> ) has since been located in the Göttingen University collection , identified by comparing it with Osborn 's illustration of a cast . 
 = = = Evolution = = = 
 The earliest known members of Proboscidea , the clade which contains modern elephants , existed about 55 million years ago around the Tethys Sea . The closest known relatives of the Proboscidea are the sirenians ( dugongs and manatees ) and the hyraxes ( an order of small , herbivorous mammals ) . The family Elephantidae existed six million years ago in Africa and includes the modern elephants and the mammoths . Among many now extinct clades , the mastodon ( Mammut ) is only a distant relative of the mammoths , and part of the separate family <unk> , which diverged 25 million years before the mammoths evolved . The following cladogram shows the placement of the genus Mammuthus among other proboscideans , based on characteristics of the hyoid bone in the neck : 
 In 2005 , researchers assembled a complete mitochondrial genome profile of the woolly mammoth , which allowed them to trace the close evolutionary relationship between mammoths and Asian elephants ( Elephas maximus ) . A 2015 DNA review confirmed Asian elephants as the closest living relative of the woolly mammoth . African elephants ( Loxodonta africana ) branched away from this clade around 6 million years ago , close to the time of the similar split between chimpanzees and humans . Before the publication of the Neanderthal genome , many researchers expected the first fully sequenced nuclear genome of an extinct species would be that of the mammoth . A 2010 study confirmed these relationships , and suggested the mammoth and Asian elephant lineages diverged 5 @.@ 8 – 7 @.@ 8 million years ago , while African elephants diverged from an earlier common ancestor 6 @.@ 6 – 8 @.@ 8 million years ago . In 2008 , much of the woolly mammoth 's chromosomal DNA was mapped . The analysis showed that the woolly mammoth and the African elephant are 98 @.@ 55 % to 99 @.@ 40 % identical . The team mapped the woolly mammoth 's nuclear genome sequence by extracting DNA from the hair follicles of both a 20 @,@ 000 @-@ year @-@ old mammoth retrieved from permafrost , and another that died 60 @,@ 000 years ago . In 2012 , proteins were confidently identified for the first time , collected from a 43 @,@ 000 @-@ year @-@ old woolly mammoth . 
 Since many remains of each species of mammoth are known from several localities , it is possible to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the genus through morphological studies . Mammoth species can be identified from the number of enamel ridges ( or lamellar plates ) on their molars ; primitive species had few ridges , and the number increased gradually as new species evolved to feed on more abrasive food items . The crowns of the teeth became deeper in height and the skulls became taller to accommodate this . At the same time , the skulls became shorter from front to back to minimise the weight of the head . The short and tall skulls of woolly and Columbian mammoths ( Mammuthus columbi ) are the culmination of this process . 
 The first known members of the genus Mammuthus are the African species M. subplanifrons from the Pliocene , and M. <unk> from the Pleistocene . The former is thought to be the ancestor of later forms . Mammoths entered Europe around 3 million years ago . The earliest European mammoth has been named M. <unk> ; it spread across Europe and China . Only its molars are known , which show that it had 8 – 10 enamel ridges . A population evolved 12 – 14 ridges , splitting off from and replacing the earlier type , becoming M. meridionalis about 2 – 1 @.@ 7 million years ago . In turn , this species was replaced by the steppe mammoth ( M. trogontherii ) with 18 – 20 ridges , which evolved in eastern Asia around 1 million years ago . The Columbian mammoth evolved from a population of M. trogontherii that had crossed the Bering Strait and entered North America about 1 @.@ 5 million years ago ; it retained a similar number of molar ridges . Mammoths derived from M. trogontherii evolved molars with 26 ridges 400 @,@ 000 years ago in Siberia and became the woolly mammoth . Woolly mammoths entered North America about 100 @,@ 000 years ago . 
 Individuals and populations showing transitional morphologies between each of the mammoth species are known , and primitive and derived species coexisted as well until the former disappeared . The different species and their intermediate forms have therefore been termed " chronospecies " . Many taxa intermediate between M. primigenius and other mammoths have also been proposed , but their validity is uncertain ; depending on author , they are either considered primitive forms of an advanced species or advanced forms of a primitive species . Distinguishing and determining these intermediate forms has been called one of the most long lasting and complicated problems in Quaternary palaeontology . Regional and intermediate species and subspecies include M. intermedius , M. <unk> , M. p. primigenius , M. p. <unk> , M. p. sibiricus , M. p. <unk> , M. p. <unk> @-@ adamsi , M. p. <unk> , M. p. <unk> , M. p. americanus , M. p. compressus , and M. p. <unk> have been proposed . 
 A 2011 genetic study showed that two examined specimens of the Columbian mammoth were grouped within a subclade of woolly mammoths . This suggests that the two populations interbred and produced fertile offspring . A North American type formerly referred to as M. jeffersonii may be a hybrid between the two species . A 2015 study suggested that the animals in the range where M. columbi and M. primigenius overlapped formed a metapopulation of hybrids with varying morphology . It also suggested that Eurasian M. primigenius had a similar relationship with M. trogontherii , in areas where their range overlapped . 
 = = Description = = 
 The appearance of the woolly mammoth is probably the best known of any prehistoric animal due to the many frozen specimens with preserved soft tissue and depictions by contemporary humans in their art . Fully grown males reached shoulder heights between 2 @.@ 7 and 3 @.@ 4 m ( 8 @.@ 9 and 11 @.@ 2 ft ) and weighed up to 6 tonnes ( 6 @.@ 6 short tons ) . This is almost as large as extant male African elephants , which commonly reach 3 – 3 @.@ 4 m ( 9 @.@ 8 – 11 @.@ 2 ft ) , and is less than the size of the earlier mammoth species M. meridionalis and M. trogontherii , and the contemporary M. columbi . The reason for the smaller size is unknown . Female woolly mammoths averaged 2 @.@ 6 – 2 @.@ 9 m ( 8 @.@ 5 – 9 @.@ 5 ft ) in height and were built more lightly than males , weighing up to 4 tonnes ( 4 @.@ 4 short tons ) . A newborn calf would have weighed about 90 kg ( 200 lb ) . These sizes are deduced from comparison with modern elephants of similar size . Few frozen specimens have preserved genitals , so the gender is usually determined through examination of the skeleton . The best indication of sex is the size of the pelvic girdle , since the opening that functions as the birth canal is always wider in females than in males . Though the mammoths on Wrangel Island were smaller than those of the mainland , their size varied , and they were not small enough to be considered " dwarves " . It has been claimed that the last woolly mammoth populations decreased in size and increased their sexual dimorphism , but this was dismissed in a 2012 study . 
 Woolly mammoths had several adaptations to the cold , most noticeably the layer of fur covering all parts of the body . Other adaptations to cold weather include ears that are far smaller than those of modern elephants ; they were about 38 cm ( 15 in ) long and 18 – 28 cm ( 7 @.@ 1 – 11 @.@ 0 in ) across , and the ear of the 6 – 12 month old frozen calf " Dima " was under 13 cm ( 5 @.@ 1 in ) long . The small ears reduced heat loss and frostbite , and the tail was short for the same reason , only 36 cm ( 14 in ) long in the " Berezovka mammoth " . The tail contained 21 vertebrae , whereas the tails of modern elephants contain 28 – 33 . Their skin was no thicker than that of present @-@ day elephants , between 1 @.@ 25 and 2 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 49 and 0 @.@ 98 in ) . They had a layer of fat up to 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick under the skin , which helped to keep them warm . Woolly mammoths had broad flaps of skin under their tails which covered the anus ; this is also seen in modern elephants . 
 Other characteristic features depicted in cave paintings include a large , high , single @-@ domed head and a sloping back with a high shoulder hump ; this shape resulted from the spinous processes of the back vertebrae decreasing in length from front to rear . These features were not present in juveniles , which had convex backs like Asian elephants . Another feature shown in cave paintings was confirmed by the discovery of a frozen specimen in 1924 , an adult nicknamed the " Middle Kolyma mammoth " , which was preserved with a complete trunk tip . Unlike the trunk lobes of modern elephants , the upper " finger " at the tip of the trunk had a long pointed lobe and was 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) long , while the lower " thumb " was 5 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) and was broader . The trunk of " Dima " was 76 cm ( 2 @.@ 49 ft ) long , whereas the trunk of the adult " <unk> mammoth " was 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) long . The well @-@ preserved trunk of a juvenile specimen nicknamed " Yuka " was described in 2015 , and it was shown that it possessed a fleshy expansion a third above the tip . Rather than oval as the rest of the trunk , this part was ellipsoidal in cross section , and double the size in diameter . The feature was also shown to be present in two other specimens , of different sexes and ages . 
 = = = Coat = = = 
 The coat consisted of an outer layer of long , coarse " guard hair " , which was 30 cm ( 12 in ) on the upper part of the body , up to 90 cm ( 35 in ) in length on the flanks and underside , and 0 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 020 in ) in diameter , and a denser inner layer of shorter , slightly curly under @-@ wool , up to 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) long and 0 @.@ 05 mm ( 0 @.@ 0020 in ) in diameter . The hairs on the upper leg were up to 38 cm ( 15 in ) long , and those of the feet were 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) long , reaching the toes . The hairs on the head were relatively short , but longer on the underside and the sides of the trunk . The tail was extended by coarse hairs up to 60 cm ( 24 in ) long , which were thicker than the guard hairs . It is likely that the woolly mammoth moulted seasonally , and that the heaviest fur was shed during spring . Since mammoth carcasses were more likely to be preserved during autumn , it is possible that only the winter coat has been preserved in frozen specimens . Modern elephants have much less hair , though juveniles have a more extensive covering of hair than adults . Comparison between the over @-@ hairs of woolly mammoths and extant elephants show that they did not differ much in overall morphology . Woolly mammoths had numerous sebaceous glands in their skin , which secreted oils into their hair ; this would have improved the wool 's insulation , repelled water , and given the fur a glossy sheen . 
 Preserved woolly mammoth fur is orange @-@ brown , but this is believed to be an artefact from the bleaching of pigment during burial . The amount of pigmentation varied from hair to hair and also within each hair . A 2006 study sequenced the <unk> gene ( which influences hair colour in mammals ) from woolly mammoth bones . Two alleles were found : a dominant ( fully active ) and a recessive ( partially active ) one . In mammals , recessive <unk> alleles result in light hair . Mammoths born with at least one copy of the dominant allele would have had dark coats , while those with two copies of the recessive allele would have had light coats . A 2011 study showed that light individuals would have been rare . A 2014 study instead indicated that the colouration of an individual varied from non @-@ pigmented on the <unk> , bi @-@ coloured , non @-@ pigmented and mixed red @-@ brown guard hairs , and non @-@ pigmented <unk> , which would give a light overall appearance . 
 = = = Dentition = = = 
 Woolly mammoths had very long tusks ( modified incisor teeth ) , which were more curved than those of modern elephants . The largest known male tusk is 4 @.@ 2 m ( 14 ft ) long and weighs 91 kg ( 201 lb ) , but 2 @.@ 4 – 2 @.@ 7 m ( 7 @.@ 9 – 8 @.@ 9 ft ) and 45 kg ( 99 lb ) was a more typical size . Female tusks were smaller and thinner , averaging at 1 @.@ 5 – 1 @.@ 8 m ( 4 @.@ 9 – 5 @.@ 9 ft ) and weighing 9 kg ( 20 lb ) . The sheaths of the tusks were parallel and spaced closely . About a quarter of the length was inside the sockets . The tusks grew spirally in opposite directions from the base and continued in a curve until the tips pointed towards each other , sometimes crossing . In this way , most of the weight would have been close to the skull , and there would be less torque than with straight tusks . The tusks were usually asymmetrical and showed considerable variation , with some tusks curving down instead of outwards and some being shorter due to breakage . Calves developed small milk tusks a few centimetres long at six months old , which were replaced by permanent tusks a year later . Tusk growth continued throughout life but became slower as the animal reached adulthood . The tusks grew by 2 @.@ 5 – 15 cm ( 0 @.@ 98 – 5 @.@ 91 in ) each year . Some cave paintings show woolly mammoths with small or no tusks , but it is unknown whether this reflected reality or was artistic license . Female Asian elephants have no tusks , but there is no fossil evidence that any adult woolly mammoths lacked them . 
 Woolly mammoths had four functional molar teeth at a time , two in the upper jaw and two in the lower . About 23 cm ( 9 @.@ 1 in ) of the crown was within the jaw , and 2 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 in ) was above . The crown was continually pushed forwards and up as it wore down , comparable to a conveyor belt . The teeth had up to 26 separated ridges of enamel , which were themselves covered in " prisms " that were directed towards the chewing surface . These were quite wear resistant and kept together by cementum and dentine . A mammoth had six sets of molars throughout a lifetime , which were replaced five times , though a few specimens with a seventh set are known . The latter condition could extend the lifespan of the individual , unless the tooth consisted of only a few plates . The first molars were about the size of those of a human , 1 @.@ 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 51 in ) , the third were 15 cm ( 6 in ) 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) long , and the sixth were about 30 cm ( 1 ft ) long and weighed 1 @.@ 8 kg ( 4 lb ) . The molars grew larger and contained more ridges with each replacement . The woolly mammoth is considered to have had the most complex molars of any elephant . 
 Distortion in the molars is the most common health problem found in woolly mammoth fossils . Sometimes the replacement was disrupted , and the molars were pushed into abnormal positions , but some animals are known to have survived this . Teeth from Britain showed that 2 % of specimens had periodontal disease , with half of these containing caries . The teeth also sometimes had cancerous growths . 
 = = Palaeobiology = = 
 Adult woolly mammoths could effectively defend themselves from predators with their tusks , trunks and size , but juveniles and weakened adults were vulnerable to pack hunters such as wolves , cave hyenas and large felines . The tusks may also have been used in intra @-@ species fighting , such as territorial fights or fights over mates . Display of the large tusks of males could also have been used to attract females , and to intimidate rivals . Because of their curvature , the tusks were not suitable for stabbing , but may have been used for hitting , as indicated by injuries to some fossil shoulder blades . The very long hairs on the tail probably compensated for the shortness of the tail , enabling its use as a <unk> , similar to the tail on modern elephants . As in modern elephants , the sensitive and muscular trunk worked as a limb @-@ like organ with many functions . It was used for manipulating objects , and in social interactions . The well @-@ preserved foot of the adult male " Yukagir mammoth " shows that the soles of the feet contained many cracks that would have helped in gripping surfaces during locomotion . Like modern elephants , woolly mammoths walked on their toes and had large , fleshy pads behind the toes . 
 Like modern elephants , woolly mammoths were likely very social and lived in matriarchal ( female @-@ led ) family groups . This is supported by fossil assemblages and cave paintings showing groups . It is therefore probable that most of their other social behaviour was similar to that of modern elephants . It is unknown how many mammoths lived at one location at a time , as fossil deposits are often accumulations of individuals that died over long periods of time . It is likely that the amounts varied by season and life @-@ cycle events . Modern elephants can form large herds , sometimes consisting of multiple family groups , and these herds can include thousands of animals migrating together . Mammoths may have formed large herds more often , since animals that live in open areas are more likely to do this than those in forested areas . Trackways made by a woolly mammoth herd 11 @,@ 300 – 11 @,@ 000 years ago have been found in the St. Mary Reservoir in Canada , showing that there were in this case almost equal numbers of adults , sub @-@ adults and juveniles . The adults had a stride of 2 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) , and the juveniles ran to keep up . 
 The woolly mammoth was probably the most specialised member of the family Elephantidae . They had <unk> ( fat storage ) in their neck and withers , for times when food availability was insufficient during winter , and their first three molars grew more quickly than in the calves of modern elephants . The expansion identified on the trunk of " Yuka " and other specimens was suggested to function as a " fur mitten " ; the trunk tip was not covered in fur , but was used for foraging during winter , and could have been heated by curling it into the expansion . It was also suggested that the expansion could be used to melt snow if there was shortage of water to drink , as melting it directly inside the mouth could disturb the thermal balance of the animal . As in reindeer and musk oxen , the haemoglobin of the woolly mammoth was adapted to the cold , with three mutations to improve oxygen delivery around the body and prevent freezing . This feature may have helped the mammoths to live in high latitudes . 
 In a 2015 study , high @-@ quality genome sequences from three Asian elephants and two woolly mammoths were compared . Approximately 1 @.@ 4 million DNA nucleotide differences were found between mammoths and elephants , which affect the sequence of more than 1 @,@ 600 proteins . Differences were noted in genes for a number of aspects of physiology and biology that would be relevant to Arctic survival , including development of skin and hair , storage and metabolism of adipose tissue , and perceiving temperature . Genes related to both sensing temperature and transmitting that sensation to the brain were altered . One of the heat @-@ sensing genes encodes a protein , <unk> , found in skin which also affects hair growth . When inserted into human cells , the mammoth 's version of the protein was found to be less sensitive to heat than the elephant 's . This is consistent with a previous observation that mice lacking active <unk> are likely to spend more time in cooler cage locations than wild type mice , and have <unk> hair . There were also several alterations in circadian clock genes , perhaps needed to cope with the extreme polar variation in length of daylight . Similar mutations are known in other Arctic mammals , such as reindeer . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 Food at various stages of digestion has been found in the intestines of several woolly mammoths , giving a good picture of their diet . Woolly mammoths sustained themselves on plant food , mainly grass and sedges , which were supplemented with herbaceous plants , flowering plants , shrubs , mosses , and tree matter . The composition and exact varieties differed from location to location . Woolly mammoths needed a varied diet to support their growth , like modern elephants . An adult of six tonnes would need to eat 180 kg ( 397 lb ) daily , and may have foraged as long as twenty hours every day . The two @-@ fingered tip of the trunk was probably adapted for picking up the short grasses of the last ice age ( Quaternary glaciation , 2 @.@ 58 million years ago to present ) by wrapping around them , whereas modern elephants curl their trunks around the longer grass of their tropical environments . The trunk could also be used for pulling off large grass tufts , delicately picking buds and flowers , and tearing off leaves and branches where trees and shrubs were present . The " Yukagir mammoth " had ingested plant matter that contained spores of dung fungus . Isotope analysis shows that woolly mammoths fed mainly on C3 plants , unlike horses and rhinos . 
 Scientists identified milk in the stomach and faecal matter in the intestines of the mammoth calf " Lyuba " . The faecal matter may have been eaten by " Lyuba " to promote development of the intestinal microbes necessary for digestion of vegetation , as is the case in modern elephants . An isotope analysis of woolly mammoths from Yukon showed that the young nursed for at least three years , and were weaned and gradually changed to a diet of plants when they were two to three years old . This is later than in modern elephants and may be due to a higher risk of predator attack or difficulty in obtaining food during the long periods of winter darkness in high latitudes . 
 The molars were adapted to their diet of coarse tundra grasses , with more enamel plates and a higher crown than their earlier , southern relatives . The woolly mammoth chewed its food by using its powerful jaw muscles to move the mandible forwards and close the mouth , then backwards while opening ; the sharp enamel ridges thereby cut across each other , grinding the food . The ridges were wear @-@ resistant to enable the animal to chew large quantities of food , which often contained grit . Woolly mammoths may have used their tusks as shovels to clear snow from the ground and reach the vegetation buried below , and to break ice to drink . This is indicated on many preserved tusks by flat , polished sections up to 30 centimetres ( 12 in ) long on the part of the surface that would have reached the ground . The tusks were also used for obtaining food in other ways , such as digging up plants and stripping off bark . 
 = = = Life history = = = 
 The lifespan of mammals is related to their size , and since modern elephants can reach the age of 60 years , the same is thought to be true for woolly mammoths which were of a similar size . The age of a mammoth can be roughly determined by counting the growth rings of its tusks when viewed in cross section , but this does not account for their early years , as these are represented by the tips of the tusks , which are usually worn away . In the remaining part of the tusk , each major line represents a year , and weekly and daily ones can be found in between . Dark bands correspond to summers , and it is therefore possible to determine the season in which a mammoth died . The growth of the tusks slowed when it became harder to forage , for example during winter , during disease , or when a male was banished from the herd ( male elephants live with their herds until about the age of ten ) . Mammoth tusks dating to the harshest period of the last glaciation 25 – 20 @,@ 000 years ago show slower growth rates . Woolly mammoths continued growing past adulthood , like other elephants . <unk> limb bones show that males grew until they reached the age of 40 , and females grew until they were 25 . The frozen calf " Dima " was 90 cm ( 35 in ) tall when it died at the age of 6 – 12 months . At this age , the second set of molars would be in the process of erupting , and the first set would be worn out at 18 months of age . The third set of molars lasted for ten years , and this process was repeated until the final , sixth set emerged when the animal was 30 years old . When the last set of molars was worn out , the animal would be unable to chew and feed , and it would die of starvation . A study of North American mammoths found that they often died during winter or spring , the hardest times for northern animals to survive . 
 The best preserved head of a frozen adult specimen , that of a male nicknamed the " Yukagir mammoth " , shows that woolly mammoths had temporal glands between the ear and the eye . This feature indicates that , like bull elephants , male woolly mammoths also entered " musth " , a period of heightened aggressiveness . The glands are used especially by males to produce an oily substance with a strong smell called <unk> . Their fur may have helped in spreading the scent further . 
 Examination of preserved calves show that they were all born during spring and summer , and since modern elephants have gestation periods of 21 – 22 months , it is probable that the mating season was from summer to <unk> <unk> isotopic analysis of the teeth of " Lyuba " has demonstrated their prenatal development , and indicates its gestation period was similar to that of a modern elephant , and that it was born in spring . 
 Evidence of several different bone diseases has been found in woolly mammoths . The most common of these diseases was osteoarthritis , found in 2 % of specimens . One specimen from Switzerland had several fused vertebrae as a result of this condition . The " Yukagir mammoth " had suffered from spondylitis in two vertebrae , and osteomyelitis is also known from some specimens . Several specimens have healed bone fractures , showing that the animals had survived these injuries . An abnormal number of cervical vertebrae has been found in 33 % of specimens from the North Sea region , probably due to inbreeding in a declining population . Parasitic flies and protozoa were identified in the gut of the calf " Dima " . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The habitat of the woolly mammoth is known as " mammoth steppe " or " tundra steppe " . This environment stretched across northern Asia , many parts of Europe , and the northern part of North America during the last ice age . It was similar to the grassy steppes of modern Russia , but the flora was more diverse , abundant , and grew faster . Grasses , sedges , shrubs , and herbaceous plants were present , and scattered trees were mainly found in southern regions . This habitat was not dominated by ice and snow , as is popularly believed , since these regions are thought to have been high @-@ pressure areas at the time . The habitat of the woolly mammoth also supported other grazing herbivores such as the woolly rhinoceros , wild horses and bison . A 2014 study concluded that forbs ( a group of herbaceous plants ) were more important in the steppe @-@ tundra than previously acknowledged , and that it was a primary food source for the ice @-@ age megafauna . 
 The southernmost woolly mammoth specimen known is from the Shandong province of China , and is 33 @,@ 000 years old . The southernmost European remains are from the Depression of Granada in Spain and are of roughly the same age . DNA studies have helped determine the phylogeography of the woolly mammoth . A 2008 DNA study showed there were two distinct groups of woolly mammoths : one that became extinct 45 @,@ 000 years ago and another one that became extinct 12 @,@ 000 years ago . The two groups are speculated to be divergent enough to be characterised as subspecies . The group that became extinct earlier stayed in the middle of the high Arctic , while the group with the later extinction had a much wider range . Recent stable isotope studies of Siberian and New World mammoths have shown there were also differences in climatic conditions on either side of the Bering land bridge , with Siberia being more uniformly cold and dry throughout the Late Pleistocene . During the Younger Dryas age , woolly mammoths briefly expanded into north @-@ east Europe , whereafter the mainland populations became extinct . 
 A 2008 genetic study showed that some of the woolly mammoths that entered North America through the Bering land bridge from Asia migrated back about 300 @,@ 000 years ago and had replaced the previous Asian population by about 40 @,@ 000 years ago , not long before the entire species became extinct . Fossils of woolly mammoths and Columbian mammoths have been found together in a few localities of North America , including the Hot Springs sinkhole of South Dakota where their regions overlapped . It is unknown whether the two species were sympatric and lived there simultaneously , or if the woolly mammoths may have entered these southern areas during times when Columbian mammoth populations were absent there . 
 = = Relationship with humans = = 
 Modern humans coexisted with woolly mammoths during the Upper Palaeolithic period when the humans entered Europe from Africa between 30 @,@ 000 and 40 @,@ 000 years ago . Prior to this , Neanderthals had coexisted with mammoths during the Middle Palaeolithic , and these humans already utilised mammoth bones for tool making and building materials . Woolly mammoths were very important to ice @-@ age humans , and human survival may have depended on the mammoth in some areas . Evidence for such coexistence was not recognised until the 19th century . William Buckland published his discovery of the Red Lady of Paviland skeleton in 1823 , which was found in a cave alongside woolly mammoth bones , but he mistakenly denied that these were contemporaries . In 1864 , Édouard <unk> found an engraving of a woolly mammoth on a piece of mammoth ivory in the <unk> de la Madeleine cave in Dordogne , France . The engraving was the first widely accepted evidence for the coexistence of humans with prehistoric extinct animals and is the first contemporary depiction of such a creature known to modern science . 
 The woolly mammoth is the third most depicted animal in ice @-@ age art , after horses and bison , and these images were produced between 35 @,@ 000 and 11 @,@ 500 years ago . Today , more than five hundred depictions of woolly mammoths are known , in media ranging from cave paintings and engravings on the walls of 46 caves in Russia , France and Spain to engravings and sculptures ( termed " portable art " ) made from ivory , antler , stone and bone . Cave paintings of woolly mammoths exist in several styles and sizes . The French <unk> Cave has the most depictions , 159 , and some of the drawings are more than 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) in length . Other notable caves with mammoth depictions are the Chauvet Cave , Les <unk> Cave , and Font @-@ de @-@ <unk> . A depiction in the Cave of El Castillo may instead show <unk> , the " straight @-@ tusked elephant " . 
 " Portable art " can be more accurately dated than cave art since it is found in the same deposits as tools and other ice age artefacts . The largest collection of portable mammoth art , consisting of 62 depictions on 47 plaques , was found in the 1960s at an excavated open @-@ air camp near <unk> in Germany . There does not seem to be a correlation between the number of mammoths depicted and the species that were most often hunted , since reindeer bones are the most frequently found animal remains at the site . Two spear throwers shaped as woolly mammoths have also been found in France . Some portable mammoth depictions may not have been produced where they were discovered , but could have moved around by ancient trading . 
 = = = Exploitation = = = 
 Woolly mammoth bones were used as construction material for dwellings by both Neanderthals and modern humans during the ice age . More than 70 such dwellings are known , mainly from the Russian Plain . The bases of the huts were circular , and ranged from 8 to 24 square metres ( 86 to 258 sq ft ) . The arrangement of dwellings varied , and ranged from 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) to 20 m ( 66 ft ) apart , depending on location . Large bones were used as foundations for the huts , tusks for the entrances , and the roofs were probably skins held in place by bones or tusks . Some huts had floors that extended 40 cm ( 16 in ) below ground . Some huts included fireplaces , which used bones as fuel , probably because wood was scarce . It is possible that some of the bones used for materials came from mammoths killed by humans , but the state of the bones , and the fact that bones used to build a single dwelling varied by several thousands of years in age , suggests that they were collected remains of long @-@ dead animals . Woolly mammoth bones were also made into various tools , furniture , and musical instruments . Large bones , such as shoulder blades , were also used to cover dead human bodies during burial . 
 Woolly mammoth ivory was used to create art objects . Several Venus figurines , including the Venus of <unk> and the Venus of <unk> , were made from this material . Weapons made from ivory , such as daggers , spears , and a boomerang , are also known . To be able to process the ivory , the large tusks had to be chopped , chiselled and split into smaller , more manageable pieces . Some ivory artefacts show that tusks had been straightened , and it is unknown how this was achieved . 
 Several woolly mammoth specimens show evidence of being butchered by humans , which is indicated by breaks , cut @-@ marks , and associated stone tools . It is not known how much prehistoric humans relied on woolly mammoth meat , since there were many other large herbivores available . Many mammoth carcasses may have been scavenged by humans rather than hunted . Some cave paintings show woolly mammoths in structures interpreted as pitfall traps . Few specimens show direct , unambiguous evidence of having been hunted by humans . A Siberian specimen with a spearhead embedded in its shoulder blade shows that a spear had been thrown at it with great force . A specimen from the Mousterian age of Italy shows evidence of spear hunting by Neanderthals . The juvenile specimen nicknamed " Yuka " is the first frozen mammoth with evidence of human interaction . It shows evidence of having been killed by a large predator , and of having been scavenged by humans shortly after . Some of its bones had been removed , and were found nearby . A site near the Yana River in Siberia has revealed several specimens with evidence of human hunting , but the finds were interpreted to show that the animals were not hunted intensively , but perhaps mainly when ivory was needed . Two woolly mammoths from Wisconsin , the " Schaefer " and " <unk> mammoths " , show evidence of having been butchered by <unk> . 
 = = Extinction = = 
 Most woolly mammoth populations disappeared during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene , alongside most of the Pleistocene megafauna ( including the Columbian mammoth ) . This extinction formed part of the Quaternary extinction event , which began 40 @,@ 000 years ago and peaked between 14 @,@ 000 and 11 @,@ 500 years ago . Scientists are divided over whether hunting or climate change , which led to the shrinkage of its habitat , was the main factor that contributed to the extinction of the woolly mammoth , or whether it was due to a combination of the two . Whatever the cause , large mammals are generally more vulnerable than smaller ones due to their smaller population size and low reproduction rates . Different woolly mammoth populations did not die out simultaneously across their range , but gradually became extinct over time . Most populations disappeared between 14 @,@ 000 and 10 @,@ 000 years ago . The last mainland population existed in the <unk> Peninsula of Siberia 9 @,@ 650 years ago . A small population of woolly mammoths survived on St. Paul Island , Alaska , until 6 @,@ 400 years ago . The last known population remained on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean until 4 @,@ 000 years ago , well into the start of human civilization and concurrent with the construction of the Great Pyramid of ancient Egypt . 
 DNA sequencing of remains of two mammoths , one from Siberia 44 @,@ 800 years BP and one from Wrangel Island 4 @,@ 300 years BP , indicates two major population crashes : one around 280 @,@ 000 years ago from which the population recovered , and a second about 12 @,@ 000 years ago , near the ice age 's end , from which it did not . The Wrangel Island mammoths were isolated for 5000 years , and due to the small population present when the island was isolated by rising post @-@ ice @-@ age sea level , about 300 to 1000 individuals experienced a 20 % to 30 % loss of heterozygosity , and a 65 % loss in mitochondrial DNA diversity . However , the population seems to have subsequently been stable , without suffering further significant loss of genetic diversity . Genetic evidence thus implies the extinction of this final population was sudden , rather than the culmination of a gradual decline ; the disappearance coincides roughly in time with the first evidence for humans on the island . The woolly mammoths of eastern Beringia ( modern Alaska and Yukon ) had similarly died out about 13 @,@ 300 years ago , soon ( roughly 1000 years ) after the first appearance of humans in the area , which parallels the fate of all the other late Pleistocene <unk> ( mammoths , gomphotheres and mastodons ) , as well as most of the rest of the megafauna , of the Americas . In contrast , the St. Paul Island mammoth population apparently died out prior to human arrival due to habitat shrinkage resulting from the post @-@ ice @-@ age sea @-@ level rise . 
 A 2008 study estimated that changes in climate shrank suitable mammoth habitat from 7 @,@ 700 @,@ 000 km2 ( 3 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 sq mi ) 42 @,@ 000 years ago to 800 @,@ 000 km2 ( 310 @,@ 000 sq mi ) 6 @,@ 000 years ago . Woolly mammoths survived an even greater loss of habitat at the end of the Saale glaciation 125 @,@ 000 years ago , and it is likely that humans hunted the remaining populations to extinction at the end of the last glacial period . Studies of an 11 @,@ 300 – 11 @,@ 000 @-@ year @-@ old trackway in south @-@ western Canada showed that M. primigenius was in decline while coexisting with humans , since far fewer tracks of juveniles were identified than would be expected in a normal herd . 
 A 2010 study suggests that the decline of the woolly mammoth could have increased temperatures by up to 0 @.@ 2 ° C ( 0 @.@ 36 ° F ) at high latitudes in the northern hemisphere . Mammoths frequently ate birch trees , creating a grassland habitat . With the disappearance of mammoths , birch forests , which absorb more sunlight than grasslands , expanded , leading to regional warming . 
 = = Fossil specimens = = 
 Woolly mammoth fossils have been found in many different types of deposits , including former rivers and lakes , and also in " Doggerland " in the North Sea , which was dry at times during the ice age . Such fossils are usually fragmentary and contain no soft tissue . Accumulations of modern elephant remains have been termed " elephants ' graveyards " , as these sites were erroneously thought to be where old elephants went to die . Similar accumulations of woolly mammoth bones have been found ; it is thought these are the result of individuals dying near or in the rivers over thousands of years , and their bones eventually being brought together by the streams . Some accumulations are also thought to be the remains of herds that died together at the same time , perhaps due to flooding . Natural traps , such as kettle holes , sink holes , as well as mud , have also trapped mammoths in separate events over time . 
 Apart from frozen remains , the only soft tissue known is from a specimen that was preserved in a petroleum seep in <unk> , Poland . Frozen remains of woolly mammoths have been found in the northern parts of Siberia and Alaska , with far fewer finds in the latter . Such remains are mostly found above the Arctic Circle , in permafrost . It appears that soft tissue was less likely to be preserved between 30 @,@ 000 and 15 @,@ 000 years ago , perhaps because the climate was milder during that period . Most specimens have partially degraded prior to discovery , due to exposure or to being scavenged . This " natural mummification " required the animal to have been buried rapidly in liquid or semi @-@ solids such as silt , mud and icy water , which then froze . 
 The presence of undigested food in the stomach and seed pods still in the mouth of many of the specimens suggests neither starvation nor exposure are likely . The maturity of this ingested vegetation places the time of death in autumn rather than in spring , when flowers would be expected . The animals may have fallen through ice into small ponds or potholes , entombing them . Many are certainly known to have been killed in rivers , perhaps through being swept away by floods . In one location , by the <unk> River in Yakutia in Siberia , more than 8 @,@ 000 bones from at least 140 mammoths have been found in a single spot , apparently having been swept there by the current . 
 = = = Frozen specimens = = = 
 Between 1692 and 1806 , only four descriptions of frozen mammoths were published in Europe . None of the remains of those five were preserved , and no complete skeleton was recovered during that time . While frozen woolly mammoth carcasses had been excavated by Europeans as early as 1728 , the first fully documented specimen was discovered near the delta of the Lena River in 1799 by Ossip <unk> , a Siberian hunter . <unk> let it thaw until he could retrieve the tusks for sale to the ivory trade . While in Yakutsk in 1806 , Michael Friedrich Adams heard about the frozen mammoth . Upon arrival at the location , Adams discovered that wild animals had eaten most of the organs and flesh of the mammoth , including the trunk . He examined the carcass and realised what was left would still be the most complete mammoth recovered by that time . Adams recovered the entire skeleton , apart from the tusks , which <unk> had already sold , and one foreleg , most of the skin , and nearly 18 kg ( 40 lb ) of hair . During his return voyage he purchased a pair of tusks that he believed were the ones that <unk> had sold . Adams brought it to the Zoological Museum of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences , and the task of mounting the skeleton was given to Wilhelm Gottlieb <unk> . The <unk> , the museum established by Peter the Great , contained the skeleton of an Indian elephant that could be used as reference . This was one of the first attempts at reconstructing the skeleton of an extinct animal . Most of the reconstruction is correct , but <unk> placed each tusk in the opposite socket , so that they curved outward instead of inward . The error was not corrected until 1899 , and the correct placement of mammoth tusks was still a matter of debate into the twentieth century . 
 The 1901 excavation of the " Berezovka mammoth " is the best documented of the early finds . It was discovered at the Siberian Berezovka River , and the Russian authorities financed its excavation . Its head was exposed , and the flesh had been scavenged . The animal still had grass between its teeth and on the tongue , showing that it had died suddenly . The entire expedition took 10 months , and the specimen had to be cut to pieces before it could be transported to St. Petersburg . It was identified as a 35- to 40 @-@ year @-@ old male , which had died 35 @,@ 000 years ago . One of its shoulder blades was broken , which may have happened when it fell into a crevasse . 
 By 1929 , the remains of 34 mammoths with frozen soft tissues ( skin , flesh , or organs ) had been documented . Only four of them were relatively complete . Since then , about that many more have been found . In most cases , the flesh showed signs of decay before its freezing and later desiccation . Since 1860 , Russian authorities have offered rewards of up to <unk> for finds of frozen woolly mammoth carcasses . Often such finds were kept secret due to superstition . Several carcasses have been lost because they were not reported , and one was fed to dogs . In more recent years , scientific expeditions have been devoted to finding carcasses instead of relying solely on chance encounters . The most famous frozen specimen from Alaska is a calf nicknamed " Effie " , which was found in 1948 . It consists of the head , trunk , and a foreleg , and is about 25 @,@ 000 years old . 
 In 1977 , the well @-@ preserved carcass of a seven- to eight @-@ month @-@ old woolly mammoth calf named " Dima " was discovered . This carcass was recovered near a tributary of the Kolyma River in northeastern Siberia . This specimen weighed approximately 100 kg ( 220 lb ) at death and was 104 cm ( 41 in ) high and 115 cm ( 45 in ) long . Radiocarbon dating determined that " Dima " died about 40 @,@ 000 years ago . Its internal organs are similar to those of modern elephants , but its ears are only one @-@ tenth the size of those of an African elephant of similar age . A less complete juvenile , nicknamed " <unk> " , was found on the Yamal Peninsula in 1988 . It was 3 – 4 months old , and a laceration on its right foot may have been the cause of death . It is the westernmost frozen mammoth found . 
 In 1997 , a piece of mammoth tusk was discovered protruding from the tundra of the Taymyr Peninsula in Siberia , Russia . In 1999 , this 20 @,@ 380 @-@ year @-@ old carcass and 25 tons of surrounding sediment were transported by an Mi @-@ 26 heavy lift helicopter to an ice cave in <unk> . The specimen was nicknamed the " <unk> mammoth " . In October 2000 , the careful <unk> operations in this cave began with the use of hair dryers to keep the hair and other soft tissues intact . 
 In 2002 , a well @-@ preserved carcass was discovered near the <unk> River in northern Yakutia , which was recovered during three excavations . This adult male specimen was called the " Yukagir mammoth " , and is estimated to have lived around 18 @,@ 560 years ago , and to have been 282 @.@ 9 cm ( 9 @.@ 2 ft ) tall at the shoulder , and weighed between 4 and 5 tonnes . It is one of the best preserved mammoths ever found due to the almost complete head , covered in skin , but without the trunk . Some postcranial remains were also found , some with soft tissue . 
 In 2007 , the carcass of a female calf nicknamed " Lyuba " was discovered near the <unk> River , where it had been buried for 41 @,@ 800 years . By cutting a section through a molar and analysing its growth lines , they found that the animal had died at the age of one month . The mummified calf weighed 50 kg ( 110 lb ) , was 85 cm ( 33 in ) high and 130 cm ( 51 in ) in length . At the time of discovery , its eyes and trunk were intact and some fur remained on its body . Its organs and skin are very well preserved . " Lyuba " is believed to have been suffocated by mud in a river that its herd was crossing . After death , its body may have been colonised by bacteria that produce lactic acid , which " pickled " it , preserving the mammoth in a nearly pristine state . 
 In 2012 , a juvenile was found in Siberia , which had man @-@ made cut marks . Scientists estimated its age at death to be 2 @.@ 5 years , and nicknamed it " Yuka " . Its skull and pelvis had been removed prior to discovery , but were found nearby . After being discovered , the skin of " Yuka " was prepared to produce a taxidermy mount . Another mammoth discovery was reported in October 2012 , when it was excavated on the Taymyr Peninsula . It was dated to 30 @,@ 000 years old . Formally known as the <unk> mammoth , it was nicknamed " <unk> " after the boy who found it . 
 In 2013 , a well @-@ preserved carcass was found on Maly <unk> Island , one of the islands in the New Siberian Islands archipelago , a female between 50 and 60 years old at the time of death . The carcass contained well @-@ preserved muscular tissue . When it was extracted from the ice , liquid blood spilled from the abdominal cavity . The finders interpreted this as indicating woolly mammoth blood possessed anti @-@ freezing properties . 
 = = = Recreating the species = = = 
 The existence of preserved soft tissue remains and DNA of woolly mammoths has led to the idea that the species could be recreated by scientific means . Several methods have been proposed to achieve this . Cloning would involve removal of the DNA @-@ containing nucleus of the egg cell of a female elephant , and replacement with a nucleus from woolly mammoth tissue . The cell would then be stimulated into dividing , and inserted back into a female elephant . The resulting calf would have the genes of the woolly mammoth , although its fetal environment would be different . Most intact mammoths have had little usable DNA because of their conditions of preservation . There is not enough to guide the production of an embryo . 
 A second method involves artificially inseminating an elephant egg cell with sperm cells from a frozen woolly mammoth carcass . The resulting offspring would be an elephant – mammoth hybrid , and the process would have to be repeated so more hybrids could be used in breeding . After several generations of cross @-@ breeding these hybrids , an almost pure woolly mammoth would be produced . The fact that sperm cells of modern mammals are potent for 15 years at most after deep @-@ freezing is a hindrance to this method . In one case , an Asian elephant and an African elephant produced a live calf named <unk> , but it died of defects at less than two weeks old . 
 In 2008 , a Japanese team found usable DNA in the brains of mice that had been frozen for 16 years . They hope to use similar methods to find usable mammoth DNA . In 2009 , the Pyrenean ibex ( a subspecies of the Spanish ibex ) was the first extinct animal to be cloned back to life ; the clone lived for only seven minutes before dying of lung defects . As the woolly mammoth genome has been fully sequenced , it may be possible to recreate a complete set of woolly mammoth chromosomes in the future by adding mammoth @-@ only sequences to Asian elephant chromosomes , which represents a more feasible but extremely difficult and expensive means of recreating the species . If the process is ever successful , there are plans to introduce woolly mammoths to Pleistocene Park , a wildlife reserve in Siberia . 
 By March 2015 , woolly mammoth genes had been copied into the genome of an Asian elephant , using the CRISPR DNA editing technique . Genetic segments from frozen mammoth specimens , including genes for the ears , subcutaneous fat , and hair attributes , were copied into the DNA of skin cells from a modern elephant . This marked the first time that woolly mammoth genes had been functionally active since the species became extinct . 
 Mammoth researchers question the ethics of such recreation attempts . In addition to the technical problems , there is not much habitat left that would be suitable for woolly mammoths . Because the species was social and gregarious , creating a few specimens would not be ideal . The time and resources required would be enormous , and the scientific benefits would be unclear , suggesting these resources should instead be used to preserve extant elephant species which are endangered . The ethics of using elephants as surrogate mothers in cloning attempts has also been questioned , as most embryos would not survive , and it would be impossible to know the exact needs of a resurrected calf . 
 = = Cultural significance = = 
 The woolly mammoth has remained culturally significant long after its extinction . Indigenous peoples of Siberia had long found what are now known to be woolly mammoth remains , collecting their tusks for the ivory trade . Native Siberians believed woolly mammoth remains to be those of giant mole @-@ like animals that lived underground and died when burrowing to the surface . Woolly mammoth tusks had been articles of trade in Asia long before Europeans became acquainted with them . Güyük , the 13th @-@ century Khan of the Mongols , is reputed to have sat on a throne made from mammoth ivory . Inspired by the Siberian natives ' concept of the mammoth as an underground creature , it became recorded in the Chinese pharmaceutical encyclopedia , Ben Cao Gangmu , as yin shu , " the hidden rodent " . 
 The indigenous peoples of North America also used woolly mammoth ivory and bone for tools and art . As in Siberia , North American natives had " myths of observation " explaining the remains of woolly mammoths and other elephants ; the Bering Strait Inupiat also believed the bones came from underground burrowing creatures , while other peoples associated them with primordial giants or " great beasts " . Observers have interpreted legends from several Native American peoples as containing folk memory of extinct elephants , though other scholars are sceptical that folk memory could survive such a long time . 
 Siberian mammoth ivory is reported to have been exported to Russia and Europe in the 10th century . The first Siberian ivory to reach western Europe was brought to London in 1611 . When Russia occupied Siberia , the ivory trade grew and it became a widely exported commodity , with huge amounts being excavated . From the 19th century and onwards , woolly mammoth ivory became a highly prized commodity , used as raw material for many products . Today it is still in great demand as a replacement for the now @-@ banned export of elephant ivory , and has been referred to as " white gold " . Local dealers estimate that there are 10 million mammoths still frozen in Siberia , and conservationists have suggested that this could help save the living species of elephants from extinction . Elephants are hunted by poachers for their ivory , but if this could instead be supplied by the already extinct mammoths , the demand could instead be met by these . Trade in elephant ivory has been forbidden in most places following the 1989 Lausanne Conference , but dealers have been known to label it as mammoth ivory to get it through customs . Mammoth ivory looks similar to elephant ivory , but the former is browner and the Schreger lines are coarser in texture . In the 21st century , global warming has made access to Siberian tusks easier , since the permafrost thaws more quickly , exposing the mammoths embedded within it . 
 Stories abound about frozen woolly mammoth meat that was consumed once defrosted , especially that of the " Berezovka mammoth " , but most of these are considered dubious . The carcasses were in most cases decayed , and the stench so unbearable that only wild scavengers and the dogs accompanying the finders showed any interest in the flesh . It appears that such meat was once recommended against illness in China , and Siberian natives have occasionally cooked the meat of frozen carcasses they discovered . 
 = = = Cryptozoology = = = 
 There have been occasional claims that the woolly mammoth is not extinct , and that small isolated herds might survive in the vast and sparsely inhabited tundra of the Northern Hemisphere . In the 19th century , several reports of " large shaggy beasts " were passed on to the Russian authorities by Siberian tribesmen , but no scientific proof ever surfaced . A French chargé d 'affaires working in Vladivostok , M. Gallon , said in 1946 that in 1920 he had met a Russian fur @-@ trapper who claimed to have seen living giant , furry " elephants " deep into the taiga . Gallon added that the fur @-@ trapper had not heard of mammoths before . Due to the large area of Siberia , it cannot be completely ruled out that woolly mammoths survived into more recent times , but all evidence indicates that they became extinct thousands of years ago . It is likely that these natives had gained their knowledge of woolly mammoths from carcasses they encountered , and that this is the source for their legends of the animal . 
 In the late 19th century , there were persistent rumours about surviving mammoths in Alaska . In October 1899 , Henry <unk> detailed his killing of a mammoth in Alaska and his subsequent donation of the specimen to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , D.C. The museum denied the existence of any mammoth corpse ; the story was a hoax . Bengt Sjögren believed that the myth began when the American biologist Charles Haskins Townsend travelled in Alaska , saw Eskimos trading mammoth tusks , asked if there were still living mammoths in Alaska , and provided them with a drawing of the animal . 
 = William Jennings Bryan presidential campaign , 1896 = 
 In 1896 , William Jennings Bryan ran unsuccessfully for President of the United States . Bryan , a former Democratic congressman from Nebraska , gained his party 's presidential nomination in July of that year after electrifying the Democratic National Convention with his Cross of Gold speech . He was defeated in the general election by the Republican candidate , former Ohio governor William McKinley . 
 Born in 1860 , Bryan grew up in rural Illinois and in 1887 moved to Nebraska , where he practiced law and entered politics . He won election to the House of Representatives in 1890 , and was re @-@ elected in 1892 , before mounting an unsuccessful US Senate run . He set his sights on higher office , believing he could be elected president in 1896 even though he remained a relatively minor figure in the Democratic Party . In anticipation of a presidential campaign , he spent much of 1895 and early 1896 making speeches across the United States ; his compelling oratory increased his popularity in his party . 
 Bryan often spoke on the issue of the currency . The economic Panic of 1893 had left the nation in a deep recession , which still persisted in early 1896 . Bryan and many other Democrats believed the economic malaise could be remedied through a return to bimetallism , or free silver — a policy they believed would inflate the currency and make it easier for debtors to repay loans . Bryan went to the Democratic convention in Chicago as an undeclared candidate , whom the press had given only a small chance of becoming the Democratic nominee . His ' Cross of Gold ' speech , given to conclude the debate on the party platform , immediately transformed him into a favorite for the nomination , and he won it the next day . The Democrats nominated Arthur Sewall , a wealthy Maine banker and shipbuilder , for vice president . The left @-@ wing Populist Party ( which had hoped to nominate the only silver @-@ supporting candidate ) endorsed Bryan for president , but found Sewall unacceptable , substituting Thomas E. Watson of Georgia . 
 Abandoned by many gold @-@ supporting party leaders and newspapers after the Chicago convention , Bryan undertook an extensive tour by rail to bring his campaign to the people . He spoke some 600 times , to an estimated 5 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 listeners . His campaign focused on silver , an issue that failed to appeal to the urban voter , and he was defeated . 
 The 1896 race is generally seen as a realigning election . The coalition of wealthy , middle @-@ class and urban voters that defeated Bryan kept the Republicans in power for most of the time until 1932 . Although defeated in the election , Bryan 's campaign made him a national figure , which he remained until his death in 1925 .

 = = = Bryan = = = 
 William Jennings Bryan was born in rural Salem , Illinois in 1860 . His father , Silas Bryan , was a Jacksonian Democrat , judge , lawyer and local party activist . As a judge 's son , the younger Bryan had ample opportunity to observe the art of speechmaking in courtrooms , political rallies , and at church and revival meetings . In post @-@ Civil War America , oratory was highly prized , and Bryan showed aptitude for it from a young age , raised in his father 's house in Salem . Attending Illinois College beginning in 1877 , Bryan devoted himself to winning the school prize for speaking . He won the prize in his junior year , and also secured the affection of Mary Baird , a student at a nearby women 's academy . She became his wife , and was his principal assistant throughout his career . 
 While attending law school from 1881 to 1883 , Bryan was a clerk to former Illinois senator Lyman Trumbull , who influenced him in a dislike for wealth and business monopolies . Bryan was strongly affected by the emerging Social Gospel movement that called on Protestant activists to seek to cure social problems such as poverty . Looking for a growing city in which his practice could thrive , he moved to Lincoln , Nebraska in 1887 . 
 Bryan quickly became prominent in Lincoln as a lawyer and a public speaker , becoming known as the " Boy Orator of the Platte " . In 1890 , he agreed to run for Congress against William J. Connell , a Republican , who had won the local congressional seat in 1888 . At that time , Nebraska was suffering hard times as many farmers had difficulties making ends meet due to low grain prices , and many Americans were discontented with the existing two major political parties . As a result , disillusioned farmers and others formed a new far @-@ left party , which came to be known as the Populist Party . The Populists proposed both greater government control over the economy ( with some calling for government ownership of railroads ) and giving the people power over government through the secret ballot , direct election of United States Senators ( who were , until 1913 , elected by state legislatures ) , and replacement of the Electoral College with direct election of the president and vice president by popular vote . Party members in many states , including Nebraska , demanded inflation of the currency through issuance of paper or silver currency , allowing easier repayment of debt . After a candidate backed by the nascent Populists withdrew , Bryan defeated Connell for the seat by 6 @,@ 700 votes ( nearly doubling Connell 's 1888 margin ) , receiving support from the Populists and Prohibitionists . 
 In Congress , Bryan was appointed to the powerful Ways and Means Committee and became a major spokesman on the tariff and money questions . He introduced several proposals for the direct election of senators and to eliminate tariff barriers in industries dominated by monopolies or trusts . This advocacy brought him contributions from silver mine owners in his successful re @-@ election bid in 1892 . In the 1892 presidential election , former Democratic president Grover Cleveland defeated the Republican incumbent , Benjamin Harrison , to regain his office . Bryan did not support Cleveland , making it clear he preferred the Populist candidate , James B. Weaver , though he indicated that as a loyal Democrat , he would vote the party ticket . 
 In May 1894 , Bryan announced he would not seek re @-@ election to the House of Representatives , feeling the incessant need to raise money to campaign in a marginal district was inhibiting his political career . Instead , he sought the Senate seat that the Nebraska legislature would fill in January 1895 . Although Bryan was successful in winning the non @-@ binding popular vote , Republicans gained a majority in the legislature and elected John Thurston as senator . 
 = = = Economic depression ; rise of free silver = = = 
 The question of the currency had been a major political issue since the mid @-@ 1870s . Advocates of free silver ( or bimetallism ) wanted the government to accept all silver bullion presented to it and to return it , struck into coin , at the historic value ratio between gold and silver of 16 to 1 . This would restore a practice abolished in 1873 . A free silver policy would inflate the currency , as the silver in a dollar coin was worth just over half the face value / Someone who presented ten dollars in silver bullion would receive back almost twice that in silver coin . Advocates believed these proposals would lead to prosperity , while opponents warned that varying from the gold standard ( which the United States had , effectively , used since 1873 ) would cause problems in international trade . 
 The 1878 Bland @-@ Allison Act and the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890 required the government to buy large quantities of silver and strike it into coin . They had been passed as compromises between free silver and the gold standard . Bryan , who had been elected after the passage of the latter enactment , initially had little to say on the subject . Free silver was very popular among Nebraskans , though many powerful Democrats opposed it . After his election to Congress , Bryan studied the currency question carefully , and came to believe in free silver ; he also saw its political potential . By 1893 , Bryan had become a leading supporter of free silver , arguing in a speech in St. Louis that the gold standard was deflationary " making a man pay a debt with a dollar larger than the one he borrowed ... If this robbery is permitted , the farmer will be ruined , and then the cities will suffer . " 
 Even as Cleveland took office as president in March 1893 , there were signs of an economic decline . Sherman 's act required the government to pay out gold in exchange for silver and paper currency , and through the early months of 1893 gold flowed out of the Treasury . On April 22 , 1893 , the amount of gold in the Treasury dropped below $ 100 million for the first time since 1879 , adding to the unease . Rumors that Europeans were about to redeem a large sum for gold caused desperate selling on the stock market , the start of the Panic of 1893 . By August , many firms had gone bankrupt , and a special session of Congress convened , called by Cleveland to repeal the silver purchase act . Bryan , who was still in Congress , spoke eloquently against the repeal , but Cleveland forced it through . The President 's uncompromising stand for gold alienated many in his own party ( most southern and western Democrats were pro @-@ silver ) . The economy failed to improve , and when the President in 1894 sent federal troops to Illinois to break up the Pullman strike , he outraged even more Democrats . In late 1894 , pro @-@ silver Democrats began to organize in the hope of taking control of the party from Cleveland and other Gold Democrats and nominating a silver candidate in 1896 . In this , they were led by Illinois Governor John Peter Altgeld , who had opposed Cleveland over the Pullman strike . The Democrats lost control of both houses of Congress in the 1894 midterm elections , with a number of southern states , usually solid for the Democrats , electing Republican or Populist congressmen . 
 In 1893 , bimetallism had been just one of many proposals by Populists and others . As the economic downturn continued , free silver advocates blamed its continuation on the repeal of the silver purchase act , and the issue of silver became more prominent . Free silver especially resonated among farmers in the South and West , as well as miners . June 1894 marked the publication of William H. Harvey 's Coin 's Financial School . The book , composed of accounts of ( fictitious ) lectures on the silver issue given by an adolescent named Coin to Chicago audiences , became an immense bestseller . The book included ( as foils to the title character ) many of Chicago 's most prominent men of business ; some , such as banker and future Secretary of the Treasury Lyman Gage , issued denials that they had participated in any such lectures . This popular treatment of the currency issue was highly influential . A Missourian , Ezra Peters , wrote to Illinois Senator John M. Palmer , " Coins [ sic ] Financial School is raising h — in this neck of the woods . If those in favor of honest money don 't do something to offset its influence the country is going to the dogs . " A Minnesota correspondent wrote in Outlook magazine : " high school boys are about equally divided between silver and baseball , with a decided leaning toward the former " .

 In March 1895 , the same month he left Congress , Bryan passed his 35th birthday , making him constitutionally eligible for the presidency . By then , he had come to see his nomination for that office as possible , even likely . Bryan believed he could use the coalition @-@ building techniques he had applied in gaining election to Congress , uniting pro @-@ silver forces behind him to gain the Democratic nomination and the presidency . To that end , it was important that the Populists not nominate a rival silver candidate , and he took pains to cultivate good relations with Populist leaders . Through 1895 and early 1896 , Bryan sought to make himself as widely known as an advocate for silver as possible . He had accepted the nominal editorship of the Omaha World @-@ Herald in August 1894 . The position involved no day @-@ to @-@ day duties , but allowed him to publish his political commentaries . In the 17 months between his departure from Congress and the Democratic National Convention in July 1896 , Bryan travelled widely through the South and West , speaking on silver . At every stop , he made contacts that he later cultivated . Several times , in his addresses , Bryan repeated variations on lines he had spoken in Congress in December 1894 , decrying the gold standard , " I will not help to crucify mankind upon a cross of gold . I will not aid them to press down upon the bleeding brow of labor this crown of thorns . " 
 Historian H. Wayne Morgan described Bryan : 
 Robert La Follette remembered Bryan as " a tall , slender , handsome fellow who looked like a young divine " . A streak of the moralist preacher raised his political chances among a people attuned to the biblical phrase and <unk> [ sic ] stance . He was a fine actor , with a justly famous voice , but was not a charlatan . Bryan believed in the out @-@ dated Jeffersonian virtues he preached in the Hamiltonian world of 1896 ... He was young , had a respectable but not burdensome record , came from the West , and understood the arts of conciliation . Though men thought otherwise at the time , neither fate nor accident created his position in the party . 
 Through early 1896 , Bryan quietly sought the nomination . Any possible candidacy depended on silver supporters being successful in electing the bulk of convention delegates ; accordingly Bryan backed such efforts . He maintained contact with silver partisans in other parties , hopeful of gathering them in after a nomination . His campaign was low @-@ key , without excessive publicity : Bryan did not want to attract the attention of more prominent candidates . He continued to give speeches , and collected his traveling expenses , and most often a speaking fee , from those who had invited him . 
 Bryan faced a number of disadvantages in seeking the Democratic nomination : he was little @-@ known among Americans who did not follow politics closely , he had no money to pour into his campaign , he lacked public office , and had incurred the enmity of Cleveland and his administration through his stance on silver and other issues . There was little advantage to the Democratic Party in nominating a candidate from Nebraska , a state small in population that had never voted for a Democrat . As state conventions met to nominate delegates to the July national convention , for the most part , they supported silver , and sent silver men to Chicago . Gold Democrats had success in the Northeast , and little elsewhere . Most state conventions did not bind , or " instruct " , their delegates to vote for a specific candidate for the nomination ; this course was strongly supported by Bryan . Once delegates were selected , Bryan wrote to party officials and obtained a list ; he sent copies of his speeches , clippings from the World @-@ Herald , and his photograph to each delegate . 
 In June 1896 , Bryan 's old teacher , former senator Trumbull died ; on the day of his funeral , Bryan 's mother also died , suddenly in Salem . Bryan spoke at her funeral , quoting lines from Second Timothy : " I have fought a good fight , I have finished my course , I have kept the faith . " He also attended , as a correspondent for the World @-@ Herald , the Republican convention that month in St. Louis . The Republicans , at the request of their nominee for president , former Ohio governor William McKinley , included a plank in their party platform supporting the gold standard . Bryan was deeply moved when , after the adoption of the platform , Colorado Senator Henry M. Teller led a walkout of silver @-@ supporting Republicans . Bryan 's biographer , Paolo Coletta , suggests that Bryan may have played a part in inciting the silver men 's departure ; he was in close contact with Silver Republicans such as Teller and South Dakota Senator Richard Pettigrew . Historian James Barnes wrote of Bryan 's preparations : 
 The Nebraskan merely understood the political situation better than most of those who might have been his rivals , and he took advantage in a legitimate and thoroughly honorable manner of the existing conditions . He knew that hard work could turn the discontent of the people into a revolt against the gold wing of the party , and no group of individuals ever labored more diligently to gain their political ends than did the silver men in the [ Democratic Party ] between 1893 and 1896 . Bryan sensed the possibility of becoming the nominee long before 1896 ; his ambition was fully matured several months prior to the convention , and there is evidence that his hopes were becoming tinged with certainty before he left for Chicago . 
 = = = Convention = = = 
 In the run up to the Democratic National Convention , set to begin at the Chicago Coliseum on July 7 , 1896 , no candidate was seen as an overwhelming favorite for the presidential nomination . The leading candidates were former Missouri congressman Richard P. Bland and former Iowa governor Horace Boies . " Silver Dick " Bland was seen as the elder statesman of the silver movement ; he had originated the Bland @-@ Allison Act of 1878 , while Boies ' victories for governor in a normally Republican state made him attractive as a candidate who might compete with McKinley in the crucial Midwest . Both had openly declared their candidacies , and were the only Democrats to have organizations seeking to obtain pledged delegates . Neither candidate had much money to spend on his campaign . In addition to the frontrunners , other silver men were spoken of as candidates . These included Vice President Adlai Stevenson of Illinois , Senator Joseph C. Blackburn of Kentucky , Indiana Governor Claude Matthews , and Bryan . Illinois Governor Altgeld , a leader of the silver movement , was ineligible because he was not a natural @-@ born U.S. citizen as required for the presidency in the Constitution . When Senator Teller walked out of the Republican convention in protest over the currency plank , he immediately became another possible candidate for the Democratic nomination for president . However , he was deemed unlikely to succeed , as many Democrats feared that if elected , he might fill some patronage jobs with Republicans . President Cleveland spent the week of the convention fishing , and had no comment about the events there ; political scientist Richard Bensel attributes Cleveland 's political inaction to the President 's loss of influence in his party . 
 Bryan 's Nebraska delegation left Lincoln by train on July 5 . Carrying some 200 people , the train bore signs on each of its five cars , such as " The W.J. Bryan Club " and " Keep Your Eye on Nebraska . " Bryan 's strategy was simple : maintain a low profile as a candidate until the last possible moment , then give a speech that rallied the silver forces behind him and bring about his nomination . He was utterly confident that he would succeed , believing " the logic of the situation , " as he later put it , dictated his selection . He explained to Champ Clark , the future Speaker of the House , that Bland and others from southern states would fall because of prejudice towards the old Confederacy , that Boies could not be nominated because he was too little @-@ known , and all others would fail due to lack of support — leaving only himself . 
 Coletta noted the problems faced by Bryan in obtaining the nomination , and how his groundwork helped overcome them : 
 The maneuver that paid Bryan highest dividends was his fifteen months of missionary work in behalf of silver and cultivation of the Chicago delegates . He knew personally more delegates than did any other candidate ... and he was on the ground to supervise his strategy . When he spoke of himself as the nominee , some reacted as [ journalist ] Willis J. Abbot did and doubted his mental capacity . How could a boy in appearance , one not yet admitted to the convention , without a single state behind him , dare claim the nomination ? The answer was simple , Bryan told Abbot — he had prepared a speech that would stampede the convention . 
 Bryan stayed at the Clifton House , a modest hotel adjoining the opulent Palmer House . A large banner outside the Clifton House proclaimed the presence of Nebraska 's delegation headquarters , but did not mention Bryan 's campaign , which was run from Nebraska 's rooms . The main candidates headquartered at the Palmer House , their rooms often crowded as they served free alcoholic drinks . The Coliseum was located in a " dry " district of Chicago but the hotels were not . 
 Just before the convention , the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) made initial determinations of which delegations were to be seated — once convened , delegates would make the final determination after the convention 's Credentials Committee reported . The DNC seated a rival , pro @-@ gold Nebraska delegation , and recommended New York Senator David B. Hill as the convention 's temporary chairman , each by a vote of 27 — 23 . Bryan was present when it was announced that his delegation would not be initially seated ; reports state he acted " somewhat surprised " at the outcome . Since the DNC action meant Bryan would not have a seat at the start of proceedings , he could not be the temporary chairman ( who would deliver the keynote address ) ; the Nebraskan began looking for other opportunities to make a speech at the convention . Historian James A. Barnes deemed the DNC 's vote immaterial ; once the convention met on July 7 , it quickly elected a silver man , Virginia Senator John Daniel , as temporary chairman and appointed a committee to review credentials friendly to the silver cause . 
 As the committees met , the convention proceeded , though in considerable confusion . Many of the silver men had not attended a national convention before , and were unfamiliar with its procedures . Members of the Committee on Resolutions ( also called the Platform Committee ) intended to elect California Senator Stephen M. White as chairman ; they found that he had already been co @-@ opted as permanent chairman of the convention . Bryan had been widely supported as a candidate for permanent chairman by the silver men , but some western delegates on the Committee on Permanent Organization objected , stating that they wanted the chance to support Bryan for the nomination ( the permanent chairman was customarily ruled out as a candidate ) . 
 Delegates spent most of the first two days listening to various speeches by silver supporters . The first report from the Credentials Committee , on the afternoon of July 8 , recommended the seating of Bryan 's delegation . This was a matter of intense interest for the silver delegates : Bryan had written to large numbers of delegates urging them to support his men over their gold rivals ; once in Chicago , he and his fellow Nebraskans had spoken with many others about the dispute . The convention , by voice vote , seated the silver Nebraskans , who arrived in the convention hall a few minutes later , accompanied by a band . Soon afterwards , the delegates , bored , shouted for a speech from Bryan , but he was not to be found . 
 Once seated , Bryan went to the Platform Committee meeting at the Palmer House , displacing the Nebraska gold delegate on the committee . The proposed platform was pro @-@ silver ; Senator Hill had offered an amendment backing the gold standard , which had been defeated by committee vote . As Hill was determined to take the platform fight to the full convention , the committee discussed who should speak in the debate , and allocated 75 minutes to each side . South Carolina Senator Benjamin Tillman , a silver supporter , wanted an hour to address the convention , and to close the debate . When both Hill and Bryan ( who was selected as the other pro @-@ silver speaker ) objected to such a long closing address , Tillman settled for 50 minutes and for opening the debate rather than closing it ; Bryan was given 25 minutes to close . Bryan later asked the Platform Committee chairman , Arkansas Senator James K. Jones why he was given such a crucial role as closing the platform debate ; Senator Jones responded that he had three reasons : Bryan 's long service in the silver cause , the Nebraskan was the only major speaker not to have addressed the convention , and that Jones had a sore throat . That evening , Bryan dined with his wife and with friends . Looking upon the loud Boies and Bland supporters , Bryan commented , " These people don 't know it , but they will be cheering for me just this way tomorrow night . "

 On the morning of July 9 , 1896 , thousands of people waited outside the Coliseum , hoping to hear the platform debate . The galleries were quickly packed , but the delegates , slowed by fatigue from the first two days and the long journey from the downtown hotels , were slower to arrive . It was not until 10 : 45 am , three @-@ quarters of an hour late , that Chairman White called the convention to order . Bryan arrived during the delay ; he was greeted with a musical tribute from one of the convention bands , which then returned to playing a medley of Irish melodies . Once White started the proceedings , he turned over the gavel to Senator Jones , who read the proposed platform to great applause from silver delegates , and hissing from gold men . The minority report attracted the opposite reaction . 
 Senator Tillman , a fiery speaker who wore a pitchfork on his lapel , began the debate . His speech , set as the only one besides Bryan 's in favor of silver , portrayed silver as a sectional issue pitting the poorer folk of the South and West against gold @-@ supporting New York and the rest of the Northeast . It was badly received even by silver delegates , who wished to think of silver as a patriotic , national issue . Senator Jones felt compelled to spend five minutes ( granted by the gold side ) , stating that the silver issue crossed sectional lines . New York Senator Hill was next : the leading spokesman for gold , both gold and silver delegates quieted to hear him . He was followed by Senator William Vilas of Wisconsin and former Massachusetts Governor William D. Russell . Each made their cases for gold , and likely changed few votes . Only Bryan was left to speak , and no one at the convention had yet effectively championed the silver cause . The New York Times described the setting : 
 There never was such a propitious moment for such an orator than that which fell to Bryan . The minority [ gold faction ] had just been pleased and the majority had just been depressed and mortified by the appearance , as the champion of free silver , of Tillman ... The minority had indicated its position . The majority felt exposed , crestfallen , and humiliated . 
 Writer Edgar Lee Masters , who witnessed Bryan 's speech , remembered , " Suddenly I saw a man spring up from his seat among the delegates and with the agility and swiftness of an eager boxer hurry to the speaker 's rostrum . He was slim , tall , pale , raven @-@ haired , beaked of nose . " The Nebraska delegation waved red handkerchiefs as Bryan progressed to the podium ; he wore an alpaca sack suit more typical of Lincoln and the West than of Chicago . There was loud cheering as Bryan stood at the lectern ; it took him a full minute to gain silence . He began : 
 I would be presumptuous , indeed , to present myself against the distinguished gentlemen to whom you have listened if this were a mere measuring of abilities ; but this is not a contest between persons . The humblest citizen in all the land , when clad in the armor of a righteous cause , is stronger than all the hosts of error . I come to speak to you in defense of a cause as holy as the cause of liberty — the cause of humanity . 
 Bryan , with this declaration , set the theme of his argument , and as it would prove , his campaign : that the welfare of humanity was at stake with the silver issue . According to his biographer Michael Kazin , " Bryan felt he was serving his part in a grander conflict that began with Christ and showed no sign of approaching its end . " From the start , Bryan had his audience : when he finished a sentence , they would rise , shout and cheer , then quiet themselves to ready for the next words ; the Nebraskan later described the convention as like a trained choir . He dismissed arguments that the business men of the East favored the gold standard : 
 We say to you that you have made the definition of a business man too limited in its application . The man who is employed for wages is as much a business man as his employer ; the attorney in a country town is as much a business man as the corporation counsel in a great metropolis ; the merchant at the cross @-@ roads store is as much a business man as the merchant of New York ; the farmer who goes forth in the morning and toils all day , who begins in spring and toils all summer , and who by the application of brain and muscle to the natural resources of the country creates wealth , is as much a business man as the man who goes upon the Board of Trade and bets upon the price of grain ; the miners who go down a thousand feet into the earth , or climb two thousand feet upon the cliffs , and bring forth from their hiding places the precious metals to be poured into the channels of trade are as much business men as the few financial magnates who , in a back room , corner the money of the world . We come to speak of this broader class of business men . 
 Many of the elements of the speech had appeared in prior Bryan addresses . However , the business man argument was new , though he had hinted at it in an interview he gave at the Republican convention . Bryan always regarded that argument as the speech 's most powerful part , despite the fame its conclusion would gain . He responded to an argument by Senator Vilas that from silver forces might arise a Robespierre . Bryan affirmed that the people could be counted on to prevent the rise of a tyrant , and noted , " What we need is an Andrew Jackson to stand , as Jackson stood , against the encroachments of organized wealth . " He continued : 
 Upon which side will the Democratic Party fight ; upon the side of " the idle holders of idle capital " or upon the side of " the struggling masses " ? That is the question which the party must answer first , and then it must be answered by each individual hereafter . The sympathies of the Democratic Party , as shown by the platform , are on the side of the struggling masses , who have ever been the foundation of the Democratic Party . 
 Bryan concluded the address , seizing a place in American history : 
 Having behind us the producing masses of this nation and the world , supported by the commercial interests , the laboring interests , and the toilers everywhere , we will answer their demand for a gold standard by saying to them : " You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns ; you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold . " 
 As he spoke his final sentence , he brought his hands to his head , fingers extended in imitation of thorns ; amid dead silence in the Coliseum , he extended his arms , recalling with words and posture the Crucifixion of Jesus , and held that position for several seconds . He then lowered his arms , and began the journey back to his seat in the silence . 
 Bryan described the stillness as " really painful " ; his anxieties that he might have failed were soon broken by pandemonium . The New York World reported , " The floor of the convention seemed to heave up . Everybody seemed to go mad at once . " In a demonstration of some half an hour , Bryan was carried around the floor , then surrounded with cheering supporters . Men and women threw their hats into the air , not caring where they might come down . Delegates were shouting to begin the vote and nominate Bryan immediately , which he refused to consider , feeling that if his appeal could not last overnight , it would not last until November . Bryan left the convention , returning to his hotel to await the outcome . In the midst of the crazed crowd , Altgeld , a Bland supporter , commented to his friend , lawyer Clarence Darrow , " That is the greatest speech I ever listened to . I don 't know but its effect will be to nominate him . "

 When order was restored after Bryan 's speech , the convention passed the platform , voting down the minority report and a resolution in support of the Cleveland administration ; it then recessed for a few hours until 8 : 00 pm , when nominating speeches were to be made . According to The Boston Globe , Bryan " had locked himself within the four walls at the Clifton House , down town , and there blushes unseen . The dark horse is in his stall , feasting on the oats of hope and political straws . " Bryan had made no arrangements for formal nominating speeches given the short timeframe , and was surprised when word was brought to him at the Clifton House that he had been nominated by Henry Lewis of Georgia : the candidate had expected the Kansas delegation to name him . As Missouri Senator George Vest nominated Bland , his oratory was drowned out by the gallery , " Bryan , Bryan , W.J. Bryan " . 
 The balloting for the presidential nomination was held on July 10 , the day after the speech ; a two @-@ thirds majority was needed to nominate . Bryan remained at his hotel , sending word to his fellow Nebraskans , " There must be no pledging , no promising , on any subject with anybody . No delegation must be permitted to violate instructions given by a state convention . Our delegation should not be too prominent in applause . Treat all candidates fairly . " On the first ballot , Bryan had 137 votes , mostly from Nebraska and four southern states , trailing Bland who had 235 ; Boies was fourth with 67 votes and was never a factor in the balloting . Bland maintained his lead on the second and third ballots , but on the fourth , with the convention in a huge uproar , Bryan took the lead . Governor Altgeld had held Illinois , which was subject to the " unit rule " whereby the entirety of a state 's vote was cast as a majority of that state 's delegation directed . After the fourth ballot , the Illinois delegation caucused and Altgeld was one of only two remaining Bland supporters , thus giving Bryan all of the state 's 48 votes and bringing him near the two @-@ thirds mark and the nomination . On the fifth ballot , other states joined the Bryan bandwagon , making him the Democratic candidate for president . 
 At the Clifton House , Bryan 's rooms were overwhelmed with those wishing to congratulate him , despite the efforts of police to keep the crowds at bay . Bryan quipped , " I seem to have plenty of friends now , but I remember well when they were very few . " He left the choice of a running mate to the convention ; delegates selected Maine shipbuilder Arthur Sewall . Active in Democratic Party politics , Sewall was one of the few eastern party leaders to support silver , was wealthy and could help finance the campaign ; he also balanced the ticket geographically . According to historian Stanley Jones in his account of the 1896 election , " it seemed in retrospect a curious logic that gave a capitalist from Maine a leading role in a campaign intended to have a strong appeal to the masses of the South and West " . Bryan and Sewall gained their nominations without the ballots of the gold men , most of whom refused to vote . Amid talk that the Gold Democrats would form their own party , Senator Hill was asked if he remained a Democrat . " I was a Democrat before the Convention and am a Democrat still — very still . "

 Bryan 's nomination was denounced by many establishment Democrats . President Cleveland , stunned by the convention 's repudiation of him and his policies , decided against open support for a bolt from the party , either by endorsing McKinley or by publicly backing a rival Democratic ticket . Nevertheless , Gold Democrats began plans to hold their own convention , which took place in September . Many Cleveland supporters decried Bryan as no true Democrat , but a fanatic and socialist , his nomination procured through demagoguery . Some of the Democratic political machines , such as New York 's Tammany Hall , decided to ignore the national ticket and concentrate on electing local and congressional candidates . Large numbers of traditionally Democratic newspapers refused to support Bryan , including the New York World , whose circulation of 800 @,@ 000 was the nation 's largest , and major dailies in cities such as Philadelphia , Detroit , and Brooklyn . Southern newspapers stayed with Bryan ; they were unwilling to endorse McKinley , the choice of most African Americans , though few of them could vote in the South . Newspapers that supported other parties in western silver states , such as the Populist Rocky Mountain News of Denver , Colorado , and Utah 's Republican The Salt Lake Tribune , quickly endorsed Bryan . 
 Following his nomination in June , McKinley 's team had believed that the election would be fought on the issue of the protective tariff . Chicago banker Charles G. Dawes , a McKinley advisor who had known Bryan when both lived in Lincoln , had predicted to McKinley and his friend and campaign manager , Mark Hanna , that if Bryan had the chance to speak to the convention , he would be its choice . McKinley and Hanna gently mocked Dawes , telling him that Bland would be the nominee . In the three weeks between the two conventions , McKinley spoke only on the tariff question , and when journalist Murat Halstead telephoned him from Chicago to inform him that Bryan would be nominated , he responded dismissively and hung up the phone . When Bryan was nominated on a silver platform , the Republicans were briefly gratified , believing that Bryan 's selection would result in an easy victory for McKinley . 
 Despite the confidence of the Republicans , the nomination of Bryan sparked great excitement through the nation . His program of prosperity through free silver struck an emotional chord with the American people in a way that McKinley 's protective tariff did not . Many Republican leaders had gone on vacation for the summer , believing that the fight , on their terms , would take place in the fall . Bryan 's endorsement , soon after Chicago , by the Populists , his statement that he would undertake a nationwide tour on an unprecedented scale , and word from local activists of the strong silver sentiment in areas Republicans had to win to take the election , jarred McKinley 's party from its complacency . 
 = = = Populist nominee = = = 
 The Populist strategy for 1896 was to nominate the candidate most supportive of silver . Populist leaders correctly believed the Republicans unlikely to nominate a silver man . They hoped the Democrats either would not endorse silver in their platform or if they did , that the Democratic candidate would be someone who could be painted as weak on silver . Bryan 's sterling record on the issue left the Populists with a stark choice : They could endorse Bryan , and risk losing their separate identity as a party , or nominate another candidate , thus dividing the pro @-@ silver vote to McKinley 's benefit . According to Stanley Jones , " the Democratic endorsement of silver and Bryan at Chicago precipitated the disintegration " of the Populist Party ; it was never again a force in national politics after 1896 . 
 Even before their convention in late July , the Populists faced dissent in their ranks . Former Populist governor of Colorado Davis H. Waite wrote to former congressman Ignatius Donnelly that the Democrats had returned to their roots and " nominated a good & true man on the platform . Of course I support him . " Populist Kansas Congressman Jerry Simpson wrote , " I care not for party names . It is the substance we are after , and we have it with William J. Bryan . " Many Populists saw the election of Bryan , whose positions on many issues were not far from theirs , as the quickest path to the reforms they sought ; a majority of delegates to the convention in St. Louis favored him . However , many delegates disliked Sewall because of his wealth and ownership of a large business , and believed that nominating someone else would keep Populist issues alive in the campaign . Although they nominated Bryan for president , they chose Georgia 's Thomas E. Watson as vice @-@ presidential candidate ; some hoped Bryan would dump Sewall from his ticket . Bryan did not ; Senator Jones ( as the new Democratic National Committee chairman , in charge of the campaign ) stated , " Mr. Sewall , will , of course , remain on the ticket , and Mr. Watson can do what he likes . " 
 Historian R. Hal Williams , in his book about the 1896 campaign , believes that the Populist nomination did Bryan little good ; most Populists would have voted for him anyway and the endorsement allowed his opponents to paint him and his supporters as extremists . The vice presidential squabble , Williams argues , worried voters who feared that instability would follow a Bryan victory , and drove them towards McKinley . Populist leader Henry Demarest Lloyd described silver as the " cow @-@ bird " of the Populist Party , which had pushed aside all other issues . The National Silver Party , mostly former Republicans , met at the same time as the Populists ; both conventions were in St. Louis . They quickly endorsed Bryan and Sewall , urging all silver forces to unite behind that ticket .

 After the Democratic convention , Bryan had returned triumphantly to Lincoln , making speeches along the way . At home , he took a short rest , and was visited by Senator Jones to discuss plans for the campaign . Bryan was not interested in campaign organization ; what he wanted from the DNC was enough money to conduct a national tour by train . The campaign , as it proved , was badly organized : This was Jones ' first national campaign , and the party structure in many states was either only newly in the control of silver forces , or in gold states wanted no part of the national ticket . With little money , poor organization , and a hostile press , Bryan was his campaign 's most important asset , and he wanted to reach the voters by traveling to them . According to Stanley Jones in his study of the 1896 campaign , " Bryan expected that he alone , carrying to the people the message of free silver , would win the election for his party . " 
 Bryan set the formal acceptance of his nomination for August 12 at New York 's Madison Square Garden ; he left Lincoln five days earlier by rail , and spoke 38 times along the way , sometimes from the trackside in his nightgown . While speaking in McKinley 's hometown of Canton , Ohio , Bryan yielded to impulse and called upon his rival at his home with Congressman Bland ; the Republican candidate and his wife , somewhat startled , received the two men hospitably in a scene Williams calls , " surely bizarre . " August 12 was an extremely hot day in New York , especially for the crowd jammed into the Garden ; when Missouri Governor William J. Stone , chair of the notification committee , essayed a lengthy speech , he was drowned out by the crowd , which wanted to hear " the Boy Orator of the Platte " . Many were disappointed ; the Democratic candidate read a two @-@ hour speech from a manuscript , wishing to look statesmanlike , and fearing that if he spoke without a script , the press would misrepresent his words . Many seats were vacant before he concluded . 
 After several days in upstate New York , during which he had a dinner with Senator Hill at which the subject of politics was carefully avoided , Bryan began a circuitous journey back to Lincoln by train . At a speech in Chicago on Labor Day , Bryan varied from the silver issue to urge regulation of corporations . According to Stanley Jones , 
 The period of this tour , in the return from New York to Lincoln , was the high point of the Bryan campaign . Bryan was well rested . After invading " the enemy 's country " , he was returning to his own territory . Wherever his train went people , who had travelled from nearby farms and villages , waved and shouted encouragement . Their enthusiasm at the unrehearsed rear platform appearances and in the formal speeches was spontaneous and contagious . The smell of victory seemed to hang in the air . Perhaps a vote taken then would have given Bryan the election . 
 = = = Whistle @-@ stop tour = = = 
 Bryan 's plan for victory was to undertake a strenuous train tour , bringing his message to the people . Although Hanna and other advisors urged McKinley to get on the road , the Republican candidate declined to match Bryan 's gambit , deciding that not only was the Democrat a better stump speaker , but that however McKinley travelled , Bryan would upstage him by journeying in a less comfortable way . McKinley 's chosen strategy was a front porch campaign ; he would remain at home , giving carefully scripted speeches to visiting delegations , much to the gratification of Canton 's hot dog vendors and souvenir salesmen , who expanded facilities to meet the demand . Meanwhile , Hanna raised millions from business men to pay for speakers on the currency question and to flood the nation with hundreds of millions of pamphlets . Starved of money , the Democrats had fewer speakers and fewer publications to issue . Bryan 's supporters raised at most $ 500 @,@ 000 for the 1896 campaign ; McKinley 's raised at least $ 3 @.@ 5 million . Among the foremost supporters of Bryan was publisher William Randolph Hearst who both contributed to Bryan 's campaign and slanted his newspapers ' coverage in his favor . 
 On September 11 , 1896 , Bryan departed on a train trip that continued until November 1 , two days before the election . At first , he rode in public cars , and made his own travel arrangements , looking up train schedules and even carrying his own bags from train station to hotel . By early October , the DNC , at the urging of Populist officials who felt Bryan was being worn out , procured the services of North Carolina journalist Josephus Daniels to make travel arrangements , and also obtained a private railroad car , The Idler — a name Bryan thought somewhat inappropriate due to the strenuous nature of the tour . Mary Bryan had joined her husband in late September ; on The Idler , the Bryans were able to eat and sleep in relative comfort . 
 During this tour , Bryan spoke almost exclusively on the silver question , and attempted to mold the speeches to reflect local issues and interests . He did not campaign on Sundays , but on most other days spoke between 20 and 30 times . Crowds assembled hours or days ahead of Bryan 's arrival . The train bearing The Idler pulled in after a short journey from the last stop , and after he was greeted by local dignitaries , Bryan would give a brief speech addressing silver and the need for the people to retake the government . The shortness of the speech did not dismay the crowds , who knew his arguments well : they were there to see and hear William Jennings Bryan — one listener told him that he had read every one of his speeches , and had ridden 50 miles ( 80 km ) to hear him , " And , by gum , if I wasn 't a Republican , I 'd vote for you . " After a brief interval for handshakes , the train would pull out again , to another town down the track . 
 Throughout the nation , voters were intensely interested in the campaign , studying the flood of pamphlets . Speakers for both parties found eager audiences . Arthur F. Mullen , a resident of O 'Neill , Nebraska , described the summer and fall of 1896 : 
 O 'Neill buzzed with political disputation from dawn till next dawn . A <unk> had been built for the Fourth of July picnic and dance . Ordinarily , it was torn down after that event . In 1896 it was kept as a forum , and by day and night men and women met there to talk about the Crime of ' 73 , the fallacies of the gold standard , bimetallism and international consent , the evils of the tariff , the moneybags of Mark Hanna , the front porch campaign of McKinley . They read W. H. Harvey 's Coin 's Financial School to themselves , their friends , and opponents ... They read Bryan when they couldn 't go off to listen to him . 
 Bryan rarely emphasized other issues than silver ; leader of a disparate coalition linked by the silver question , he feared alienating some of his supporters . He occasionally addressed other subjects : in an October speech in Detroit , he spoke out against the Supreme Court 's decision ruling the federal income tax unconstitutional . He promised to enforce the laws against the trusts , procure stricter ones from Congress , and if the Supreme Court struck them down , to seek a constitutional amendment . In what Williams describes as " a political campaign that became an American legend " , Bryan traveled to 27 of the 45 states , logging 18 @,@ 000 miles ( 29 @,@ 000 km ) , and in his estimated 600 speeches reached some 5 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 listeners . 
 = = = Attacks and Gold Democrats ; the final days = = = 
 Republican newspapers painted Bryan as a tool of Governor Altgeld , who was controversial for having pardoned the surviving men convicted of involvement in the Haymarket bombing . Others dubbed Bryan a " <unk> " . On September 27 , The New York Times published a letter by an " eminent <unk> " who , based on an analysis of the candidate 's speeches , concluded that Bryan was mad . The paper editorialized on the same page that even if the Democratic candidate was not insane , he was at least " of unsound mind " . For the most part , Bryan ignored the attacks , and made light of them in his account of the 1896 campaign . Republican newspapers and spokesmen claimed that Bryan 's campaign was expensively financed by the silver interests . This was not the case : the mining industry was seeing poor times , and had little money to donate to Bryan . In his account , Bryan quoted a letter by Senator Jones : " No matter in how small sums , no matter by what humble contributions , let the friends of liberty and national honor contribute all they can to the good cause . " 
 In September , the Gold Democrats met in convention in Indianapolis . Loyal to Cleveland , they wanted to nominate him . However , the President ruled this out ; his Cabinet members also refused to run . Not even supporters thought the Gold Democrats would win ; the purpose was to have a candidate who would speak for the gold element in the party , and who would divide the vote and defeat Bryan . Illinois Senator John M. Palmer was eager to be the presidential candidate , and the convention nominated him with Kentucky 's Simon Bolivar Buckner as his running mate . Palmer was a 79 @-@ year @-@ old former Union general , Buckner a 73 @-@ year @-@ old former Confederate of that rank ; the ticket was the oldest in combined age in American history , and Palmer the second @-@ oldest presidential candidate ( behind Peter Cooper of the Greenback Party ; Bryan was the youngest ) . The Gold Democrats received quiet financial support from Hanna and the Republicans . Palmer proved an able campaigner who visited most major cities in the East , and in the final week of his campaign , told listeners , " I will not count it any great fault if next Tuesday you decide to cast your ballots for William McKinley . " 
 The South and most of the West were deemed certain to vote for Bryan . When early @-@ voting Maine and Vermont went strongly Republican in September , this meant that McKinley would most likely win the Northeast . These results made the Midwest the crucial battlefield that would decide the presidency . Bryan spent most of October there — 160 of his final 250 train stops were in the Midwest . Early Republican polls had shown Bryan ahead in crucial Midwestern states , including McKinley 's Ohio . Much of the blizzard of paper the Republican campaign was able to pay for concentrated on this area / By September , this had its effect as silver sentiment began to fade . Morgan noted , " full organization , [ Republican ] party harmony , a campaign of education with the printed and spoken word would more than counteract " Bryan 's speechmaking . Beginning in September , the Republicans concentrated on the tariff question , and as Election Day , November 3 , approached , they were confident of victory . 
 William and Mary Bryan returned to Lincoln on November 1 , two days before the election . He was not yet done with campaigning , however ; on November 2 , he undertook a train journey across Nebraska in support of Democratic congressional candidates . He made 27 speeches , including seven in Omaha , the last concluding a few minutes before midnight . His train reached Lincoln after the polls opened ; he journeyed from train station to polling place to his house escorted by a mounted troop of supporters . He slept much of the evening of election day , to be <unk> by his wife with telegrams showing the election was most likely lost .

 The 1896 presidential election was close by modern measurements , but less so by the standards of the day , which had seen close @-@ run elections over the previous 20 years . McKinley won with 7 @.@ 1 million votes to Bryan 's 6 @.@ 5 million , 51 % to 47 % . The electoral vote was not as close : 271 for McKinley to 176 for Bryan . The nation was regionally split , with the industrial East and Midwest for McKinley , and with Bryan carrying the Solid South and the silver strongholds of the Rocky Mountain states . McKinley did well in the border states of Maryland , West Virginia , and Kentucky . Although Bryan claimed that many employers had intimidated their workers into voting Republican , Williams points out that the Democrats benefited from the disenfranchisement of southern African Americans . Palmer received less than 1 % of the vote , but his vote total in Kentucky was greater than McKinley 's margin of victory there . Confusion over ballots in Minnesota resulted in 15 @,@ 000 voided votes and may have thrown that state to the Republicans . 
 In most areas , Bryan did better among rural voters than urban . Even in the South , Bryan attracted 59 % of the rural vote , but only 44 % of the urban vote , taking 57 % of the southern vote overall . The only areas of the nation where Bryan took a greater percentage of the urban than the rural vote were New England and the Rocky Mountain states ; in neither case did this affect the outcome , as Bryan took only 27 % of New England 's vote overall , while taking 88 % of the Rocky Mountain city vote to 81 % of the vote there outside the cities . McKinley even won the urban vote in Nebraska . Most cities that were financial or manufacturing centers voted for McKinley . Those that served principally as agricultural centers or had been founded along the railroad favored Bryan . The Democratic Party preserved control in the eastern cities through machine politics and the continued loyalty of the Irish @-@ American voter ; Bryan 's loss over the silver issue of many German @-@ American voters , previously solidly Democratic , helped ensure his defeat in the Midwest . According to Stanley Jones , " the only conclusion to be reached was that the Bryan campaign , with its emphasis on the free coinage of silver at 16 to 1 , had not appealed to the urban working classes . " 
 On November 5 , Bryan sent a telegram of congratulations to McKinley , becoming the first losing presidential candidate to do so , " Senator Jones has just informed me that the returns indicate your election , and I hasten to extend my congratulations . We have submitted the issues to the American people and their will is law . " By the end of 1896 , Bryan had published his account of the campaign , The First Battle . In the book , Bryan made it clear that the first battle would not be the last , " If we are right , we shall yet triumph . " 
 = = Appraisal and legacy = = 
 Michael Kazin , Bryan 's biographer , notes the many handicaps he faced in his 1896 campaign : " A severe economic downturn that occurred with Democrats in power , a party deserted by its men of wealth and national prominence , the vehement opposition of most prominent publishers and academics and ministers , and hostility from the nation 's largest employers " . According to Kazin , " what is remarkable is not that Bryan lost but that he came as close as he did to winning . " Williams believes that Bryan did better than any other Democrat would have , and comments , " The nominee of a divided and discredited party , he had come remarkably close to winning . " Bryan 's own explanation was brief : " I have borne the sins of Grover Cleveland . " 
 The consequences of defeat , however , were severe for the Democratic Party . The 1896 presidential race is generally considered a realigning election , when there is a major shift in voting patterns , upsetting the political balance . McKinley was supported by middle @-@ class and wealthy voters , urban laborers , and prosperous farmers ; this coalition would keep the Republicans mostly in power until the 1930s . The election of 1896 marked a transition as the concerns of the rural population became secondary to those of the urban ; according to Stanley Jones , " the Democratic Party reacted with less sensitivity than the Republicans to the hopes and fears of the new voters which the new age was producing " . This was evidenced in the tariff question : Bryan spent little time addressing it , stating that it was subsumed in the financial issue ; Republican arguments that the protective tariff would benefit manufacturers appealed to urban workers and went <unk> by the Democrats . 
 One legacy of the campaign was the career of William Jennings Bryan . He ran for president a second time in 1900 and a third time in 1908 , each time losing . Through the almost three decades before his death in 1925 , he was ever present on political platform and speaking circuit , fighting first for silver , and then for other causes . Bryan served as Secretary of State under President Woodrow Wilson from 1913 to 1915 , resigning as Wilson moved the nation closer to intervention in World War I. His final years were marked with controversy , such as his involvement in the Scopes Monkey Trial in the final weeks of his life , but according to Kazin , " Bryan 's sincerity , warmth , and passion for a better world won the hearts of people who cared for no other public figure in his day " . 
 Despite his defeat , Bryan 's campaign inspired many of his contemporaries . Writers such as Edgar Lee Masters , Hamlin Garland and his fellow Nebraskan , Willa Cather , like Bryan came from the prairies ; they wrote of their admiration for him and his first battle . The poet Vachel Lindsay , 16 years old in 1896 , passionately followed Bryan 's first campaign , and wrote of him many years later :
