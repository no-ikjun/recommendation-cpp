 " Bisexuality , The Rocky Horror Picture Show , and Me " , by Elizabeth Reba Weise , is a piece in Bi Any Other Name : Bisexual People Speak Out ( 1991 ) , an anthology edited by Loraine Hutchins and Lani Ka <unk> which is one of the seminal books in the history of the modern bisexual rights movement . 
 Rocky Horror remains a cultural phenomenon in both the U.S. and U.K. Cult film participants are often people on the fringe of society that find connection and community at the screenings although the film attracts fans of differing backgrounds all over the world . 
 = TWA Flight 159 = 
 Trans World Airlines ( TWA ) Flight 159 was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from New York to Los Angeles , California , with a stopover in Cincinnati / Northern Kentucky International Airport , Kentucky , that crashed after an aborted takeoff from Cincinnati on 6 November 1967 . The Boeing 707 attempted to abort takeoff when the copilot became concerned that the aircraft had collided with a disabled DC @-@ 9 on the runway . The aircraft overran the runway , struck an embankment and caught fire . One passenger died as a result of the accident . 
 The NTSB concluded that the crash occurred due to the TWA flight crew 's inability to successfully abort takeoff due to the speed of the aircraft , and that a runway overrun was unavoidable at the 707 's speed . The disabled DC @-@ 9 , a Delta Air Lines flight which had reported that it had cleared the runway when in fact it had not , was a contributing factor in the crash . The NTSB recommended that the FAA establish and publicize standards of safe clearance from runway edges for both aircraft and ground vehicles which also take into account the exhaust fumes of jet engines . The Board also recommended a reevaluation of training manuals and aircraft procedures in regards to abort procedures .

 = = Flight history and crash = = 
 Flight 159 was a New York @-@ Los Angeles flight with an intermediate stop at Greater Cincinnati Airport . The flight operated from New York to Cincinnati without incident . 
 At 18 : 38 Eastern Standard Time , Flight 159 was approaching Cincinnati 's runway 27L for takeoff , and was instructed by the tower controller to " taxi into position and hold " short of the runway . As Flight 159 approached Runway 27L , another flight , Delta Air Lines Flight 379 ( DAL 379 ) , a DC @-@ 9 , was coming in to land on the same runway . After landing , DAL 379 received permission to turn 180 ° to reach an intersection they had <unk> , but the DC @-@ 9 was unable to complete the turn and ran off the paved runway . While most of the aircraft was stuck in the mud well away from the runway , the tail was only approximately 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) from the edge of the runway . The rearmost exterior light on DAL 379 was 45 feet ( 14 m ) from the edge of the runway , which might have caused DAL 379 to appear at a distance to be farther from the runway than it actually was . 
 At 18 : 39 , while DAL 379 was in the process of clearing the runway , Flight 159 was cleared for takeoff . Before Flight 159 began moving , the tower controller observed that DAL 379 had stopped moving , and called DAL 379 to confirm they were clear of the runway . The captain of the Delta DC @-@ 9 replied , " Yeah , we 're in the dirt though . " The tower controller then advised TWA that DAL 379 was clear of the runway , and that Flight 159 was cleared for takeoff . With the first officer operating the controls , Flight 159 then began its takeoff roll down runway 27L . 
 Neither pilot aboard Flight 159 initially saw how close DAL 379 was to the runway . As Flight 159 sped down the runway , the captain observed that the DC @-@ 9 was " off the runway " by only " five , six , seven feet or something of that nature . " As the Boeing 707 passed the Delta plane , the pilots heard a loud bang which coincided with a movement of the flight controls and a yawing motion of the aircraft . Thinking he had hit the DC @-@ 9 , Flight 159 's first officer attempted to abort the takeoff , and both pilots attempted to use their aircraft 's thrust reversers , brakes , and spoilers to stop the aircraft . 
 The aircraft overran the end of the runway , went over the edge of a hill , and became airborne for 67 feet ( 20 m ) . It then struck the ground again , shearing off the main landing gear and displacing the nosewheel rearward . The Boeing 707 slid down an embankment and came to rest 421 feet ( 128 m ) from the end of the runway . The fuselage ruptured , and the structure of one wing failed during the crash . The right side wing of the plane caught fire as it left the runway . All 29 passengers and 7 crew members escaped the aircraft , with two passengers requiring hospitalization . One of the hospitalized passengers died as a result of their injuries four days after the accident . The 707 was damaged beyond repair and regarded as a complete write off after the fire damaged right wing and broken fuselage . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) investigated the accident . Although the tail of the Delta DC @-@ 9 was several feet from the runway , the NTSB determined that DAL 379 's engines were still operating at idle when Flight 159 attempted to take off , and DAL 379 's idling jet engines were directing hot jet exhaust over the runway . The NTSB determined that neither Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) regulations nor the Terminal Air Traffic Control Procedures Manual defined the phrase " clear of the runway , " and found that the pilots of each plane and the air traffic controller each had their own slightly different definition of the term . The NTSB concluded that DAL 379 was not actually " clear of the runway " because its jet exhaust continued to pose a hazard to aircraft attempting to use runway 27L . 
 The jet blast from DAL 379 caused a compressor stall in Flight 159 's number four engine . The compressor stall caused a loud noise heard by the pilots , and the jet blast caused a movement of the Boeing 707 's flight controls during the takeoff . The 707 did not make contact with the DC @-@ 9 , but the noise and movement convinced the first officer that a collision had occurred . The NTSB concluded that the first officer 's decision to abort was reasonable under the circumstances . 
 TWA company manuals indicated that aborting a takeoff at high speeds is dangerous , and should only be attempted if an actual engine failure occurs before V1 speed . " V1 " speed is the maximum speed at which the takeoff can be safely aborted ; after V1 speed is exceeded , the plane must take off to avoid overrunning the runway . The captain of Flight 159 failed to announce that Flight 159 had achieved V1 speed , and the first officer believed the plane was at or near V1 ( rather than having substantially exceeded V1 ) when he aborted the takeoff . On a Boeing 707 , the V1 speed is 132 knots ( 244 km / h ; 152 mph ) ; Flight 159 achieved a peak speed of 145 knots ( 269 km / h ; 167 mph ) . However , the NTSB determined that V1 was not relevant to this incident because it is only intended to advise pilots on whether they can abort after engine failure , and the first officer believed that his aircraft had been physically damaged and might not be capable of flight . As a result , the NTSB found the first officer 's decision to abort was reasonable , but criticized the pilots for failing to execute the abort rapidly . One NTSB board member , Francis H. McAdams , wrote in a separate minority report that he would have concluded that an abort was both reasonable and necessary under the circumstances , despite the fact that the aircraft had exceeded V1 and was certain to overrun the runway . 
 The majority opinion presented by the NTSB accident report determined that the cause of the accident was the TWA flight crew 's inability to successfully abort takeoff procedures due to an excess of speed . The NTSB recommended revisions and expansions to airline abort procedures and new FAA regulations defining runway clearance and procedures , taking into account jet engine exhaust . In his minority report , Mr. McAdams ' said that he would have found the probable cause of the accident to be the Delta crew 's failure to adequately advise the tower of the proximity to the runway , and the tower 's failure to request additional and precise information prior to clearing TWA 159 for takeoff . 
 The family of the deceased passenger received a $ 105 @,@ 000 settlement from Delta Air Lines in civil court . TWA also sued Delta for the loss of the Boeing 707 aircraft , and reached a settlement of $ 2 @,@ 216 @,@ 000 . 
 = 1994 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1994 Atlantic hurricane season produced seven named tropical cyclones and three hurricanes , a total below the Atlantic hurricane season average . It officially started on June 1 and ended on November 30 , dates which conventionally limit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean . The first tropical cyclone , Tropical Storm Alberto , developed on June 30 , while the last storm , Hurricane Gordon , dissipated on November 21 . The season was unusual in that it produced no major hurricanes , which are those of Category 3 status or higher on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane scale . The most intense hurricane , Hurricane Florence , peaked as a Category 2 storm with winds of 110 mph ( 180 km / h ) . Aside from Chris , Florence , and Gordon , none of the storms exceeded tropical storm intensity . 
 Tropical Storm Alberto produced significant rainfall and flooding in the Southeastern United States , damaging or destroying over 18 @,@ 000 homes . In August , Tropical Storm Beryl produced heavy rainfall in Florida , Georgia , South Carolina , and North Carolina , with moderate to heavy rainfall throughout several other states . Beryl caused numerous injuries , many of which occurred from a tornado associated with the tropical storm . Tropical Storm Debby killed nine people in the Caribbean in September . Hurricane Gordon was the most significant storm of the season , causing damage from Costa Rica to North Carolina among its six landfalls . Extreme flooding and mudslides from Gordon caused approximately 1 @,@ 122 fatalities in Haiti . In addition , a nor 'easter in December may have had tropical characteristics , though due to the uncertainty , it was not classified as a tropical system . 
 = = Seasonal forecasts and activity = = 
 Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as Dr. William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University . A normal season , as defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , has six to fourteen named storms , with four to eight of those reaching hurricane strength , and one to three major hurricanes . The 1994 forecast predicted that a total of 10 storms would form , of which six of the storms would reach hurricane status . The forecast also projected that three of the hurricanes would reach major hurricane status . 
 In terms of tropical cyclone activity , the season was below average , with only seven named storms , three hurricanes , and no major hurricanes . It was one of only five Atlantic hurricane seasons without major hurricanes , the others being the 1968 , 1972 , 1986 and 2013 seasons , although records before 1944 are incomplete . No storms of hurricane intensity formed within the months of September and October for the first time since reliable records began in the 1940s . The season did not produce any major hurricanes , storms of Category 3 status , the first such occurrence since 1986 . The low seasonal activity is attributed to the presence of El Niño , which is a global coupled ocean @-@ atmosphere phenomenon . The season officially began on June 1 , and ended on November 30 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when the majority of tropical cyclones tend to form in the Atlantic Ocean . 
 The season 's activity was reflected in a low cumulative accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 32 . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs . ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots ( 39 mph , 63 km / h ) or tropical storm strength . 
 = = Storms = = 
 = = = Tropical Storm Alberto = = = 
 The first storm of the season formed on June 30 near the western tip of Cuba . Initially tracking westward , the depression turned towards the north , though it remained poorly defined . Early on July 2 , the depression organized into Tropical Storm Alberto . Alberto peaked as a tropical storm with winds of 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) , and made landfall near Destin , Florida on July 3 . The storm quickly weakened to a tropical depression over Alabama as it continued to the northeast , but retained a well @-@ organized circulation . High pressures built to its north and east , causing the remnant tropical depression to stall over northwestern Georgia . It began a westward drift and dissipated over central Alabama on July 7 . 
 Alberto triggered some of the worst flooding ever observed across portions of Georgia , Alabama , and Florida . As a result of the storm 's slow motion , 27 inches ( 690 mm ) of rain fell in some locations . Due to flash flooding , 33 deaths were reported , primarily in Georgia . Over 18 @,@ 000 homes were damaged or destroyed , and in excess of 1 @,@ 000 roads sustained damage . About 900 @,@ 000 acres ( 360 @,@ 000 ha ) of crops were affected by the storm , and 218 dams failed . Total damage from the storm amounted to $ 750 million ( 1994 USD ; $ 1 @.@ 2 billion 2016 USD ) . The flooding from Alberto was considered the worst natural disaster in Georgia 's history . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Two = = = 
 The origins of the depression were from a broad upper @-@ level trough that extended northeastward from The Bahamas . An area of convection developed near the Bahamas , spawning a low @-@ pressure area on July 19 . The next day , the system organized into Tropical Depression Two , after confirmation from the Hurricane Hunters . Upon developing , the depression was poorly organized , with most of the thunderstorms located south of the center . On July 20 , the circulation became better organized as the convection increased ; however , the depression moved ashore near Georgetown , South Carolina at 1400 UTC without intensifying beyond winds of 35 miles per hour ( 55 km / h ) . As it moved inland , it turned to the north , dissipating on July 21 near Charlotte , North Carolina . The remnant low continued northeastward across the northeastern United States , becoming unidentifiable on July 22 while entering Nova Scotia . 
 The depression was never forecast to attain tropical storm status . Officials issued flash flood watches for portions of the southeastern United States . Tropical Depression Two dropped light rainfall throughout the Southeastern United States , the Mid @-@ Atlantic , and parts of New England . It was the first tropical system to make landfall in South Carolina since Hurricane Hugo . Rainfall peaked at 6 @.@ 84 in ( 173 @.@ 7 mm ) in Hamlet , North Carolina . There were no reports of damage or casualties associated with Tropical Depression Two . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Beryl = = = 
 After a slow start to the season , Tropical Storm Beryl formed as a tropical depression on August 14 in the Gulf of Mexico . The center moved slowly and erratically in response to an approaching trough , and after moving towards the north , the storm made landfall near Panama City , Florida as a tropical storm . The weakening storm accelerated towards the north @-@ northeast , and the system was identifiable as a low @-@ pressure system as far north as Connecticut . 
 Tropical Storm Beryl produced heavy rainfall in Florida , Georgia , South Carolina , and North Carolina , with moderate to heavy rainfall throughout several other states . Several rivers from Florida to New York approached or exceeded flood stage . Although no fatalities were directly related to Beryl , several injuries were reported , including 37 due to an associated tornado . Property damage was estimated at $ 73 million ( 1994 USD ; $ 117 million 2016 USD ) . 
 = = = Hurricane Chris = = = 
 Hurricane Chris originated from a tropical wave that emerged from the west coast of Africa on August 11 and tracked westward . The associated disturbance organized and was declared a tropical depression on August 16 , while Tropical Storm Beryl was over land . The depression intensified into a tropical storm on August 17 , and the next day it acquired hurricane intensity . Chris maintained hurricane strength for two days , before increased wind shear caused the cyclone to weaken . The storm remained away from land , passing to the east of Bermuda on August 21 , before it merged with an extratropical baroclinic zone to the southeast of Newfoundland . 
 Hurricane Chris dropped 2 @.@ 83 inches ( 72 mm ) of rain on Bermuda , though no damage or fatalities were reported . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Five = = = 
 A tropical wave that was first noted on August 17 tracked westward and reached the Caribbean on August 26 . The wave moved across the Yucatán Peninsula , and developed into a tropical depression on August 29 in the Bay of Campeche . Moving west @-@ northwestward , the system remained below tropical storm status , and made landfall near Tampico on August 31 . 
 Mexico was affected by rainfall from Tropical Depression Five , which peaked at 16 @.@ 18 inches ( 411 mm ) , while associated moisture from the depression affected San Antonio , Texas . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Debby = = = 
 A tropical depression developed from another tropical wave on September 9 . Surface observations and ship reports suggested that it developed into Tropical Storm Debby on September 10 , despite poor organization evidenced by satellite imagery . Peaking with winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) , the storm moved westward through the Leeward Islands and encountered wind shear which limited the storm 's intensity and organization . Wind shear caused the system to deteriorate , and the circulation degenerated into a tropical wave on September 11 . 
 Tropical Storm Debby killed four people and injured 24 on St. Lucia . Heavy rainfall caused flooding and mudslides , which washed away hillside shacks , eight bridges , and parts of roads . Flood waters were chest @-@ high in some locations , and the storm 's winds damaged banana plantations . Mudslides caused by the storm blocked roads , and water supply was disrupted . On Martinique , one person drowned and some towns were flooded . Downed trees made roads impassable , and up to 20 @,@ 000 people on the island lost power . Three deaths occurred in the Dominican Republic , and a fisherman drowned off of Puerto Rico . Throughout the areas affected by Debby , it is estimated that hundreds of people were homeless . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Ernesto = = = 
 A tropical wave exited Africa on September 18 with an area of organized deep convection . The wave was in a series of strong waves that exited Africa later than the climatological peak of the season . Dvorak classifications began on September 21 , and later that day the system developed into Tropical Depression Seven about 500 miles ( 806 km ) southwest of Cape Verde . Wind shear was marginally favorable for development , and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Ernesto on September 22 . The next morning , the storm attained its peak intensity , with winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) and a minimum atmospheric pressure of 997 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 53 inHg ) . 
 After peaking , Ernesto entered an area of increasing wind shear and stronger upper @-@ tropospheric flow , resulting in a steady weakening trend . After most of the convection diminished over the center , the storm weakened to a tropical depression on September 24 . Subsequently , it decelerated and turned to a west @-@ northwest drift . The last public advisory was issued on Tropical Depression Ernesto at 2100 UTC September 25 , although it did not dissipate until early the next day , about 450 miles ( 725 km ) west of Cape Verde . The remnants continued generally westward , occasionally redeveloping deep convection but never regenerating into a tropical cyclone . The remnants were no longer identifiable as of September 29 . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Eight = = = 
 The eighth depression of the season formed with little convection on September 19 in the southwestern Caribbean . The area of convection lasted for several days moving from northwestern direction to the northeastern . The wave was estimated to have strengthened into Tropical Depression Eight on September 24 near the coast of Honduras . An Air Force aircraft found the depression with a poorly organized circulation and a pressure of 1 @,@ 007 mbar ( 29 @.@ 7 inHg ) . The depression moved west at 7 to 10 mph ( 11 to 16 km / h ) on September 25 . Just before landfall in Belize on September 25 , Eight hit its peak intensity of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) and 1 @,@ 004 mbar ( 29 @.@ 6 inHg ) . The depression made landfall in Mexico and dissipated the next day over Guatemala . Reports show that the remnants of Eight became Tropical Depression Ten . The storm dropped heavy precipitation in and around Belize . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Nine = = = 
 Tropical Depression Nine started out as a well @-@ defined cloud circulation that moved off the coast of Africa on September 26 . The circulation was upgraded to the ninth depression of the 1994 season , 174 miles ( 280 km ) southeast of Cape Verde the next day at 1200 UTC when banding cloud patterns became evident on satellite imagery . The depression moved toward the north @-@ northwest at 12 mph ( 19 km / h ) or less , reaching peak intensity early on September 28 , around 0600 UTC , but the LLCC became exposed and the depression lost much of its deep convection later that day . The NHC declared Nine dissipated early on September 29 , near Sal in the Cape Verde Islands . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Ten = = = 
 The remnants of Tropical Depression Eight persisted over the northwestern Caribbean in late September . Convection increased and organized after a tropical wave reached the area . A circulation soon developed within the low @-@ pressure area . It was estimated that Tropical Depression Ten formed on September 29 at 0600 UTC . A reconnaissance aircraft did not indicate a closed circulation due to the proximity with Cuba , which caused difficulties with satellite intensity estimates . The system was relatively disorganized , potentially moving ashore in western Cuba near Cabo San Antonio . The tropical depression entered the Gulf of Mexico on September 30 as it turned to the northwest . On September 30 at 0600 UTC , the tropical depression attained its peak intensity , winds had reached 35 mph ( 56 km / h ) and the minimum central pressure had dropped down to 1004 mbar . The depression was soon becoming absorbed by a larger non @-@ tropical system in the southern Gulf of Mexico . By 1800 UTC on September 30 , Tropical Depression Ten had been completely absorbed by the non @-@ tropical system . Initial predictions from the National Hurricane Center estimated that the depression would rapidly develop into a tropical storm . The depression dropped heavy rainfall in Cuba , reaching 12 inches ( 300 mm ) in a 24 hour period in Giron . Rainfall from the tropical depression in the Florida Keys was around 5 inches ( 130 mm ) . The remnants of the depression dropped heavy rains in Florida , causing $ 5 million in damage ( 1994 USD ) . 
 = = = Hurricane Florence = = = 
 After a quiet October , the month of November began with the formation of a subtropical depression on November 2 . The storm intensified into a subtropical storm shortly thereafter before weakening to a depression the next day . The subtropical system transitioned into a tropical cyclone about 875 miles ( 1 @,@ 408 km ) east @-@ southeast of Bermuda , and the depression quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Florence . Florence rapidly intensified and was upgraded to a hurricane on November 4 . The intensification ceased shortly after it started and minor fluctuations in intensity took place over the following three days . Florence was subsequently upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane . A large extratropical system located to the north absorbed the storm on November 8 . 
 = = = Hurricane Gordon = = = 
 Hurricane Gordon was the final storm of the season . The system formed near Panama in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on November 9 . Strengthening into a tropical storm , Gordon wound its way north into the Greater Antilles . Despite warm waters , persistent wind shear prevented significant strengthening . Executing a slow turn to the north and then the northwest , Gordon made two more landfalls , on eastern Jamaica and eastern Cuba . As Tropical Storm Gordon made its fourth landfall crossing the Florida Keys , it interacted with a cyclone in the upper troposphere and a series of cyclonic lows which lent the storm some sub @-@ tropical characteristics . After a few days as an unusual hybrid of a tropical and a subtropical system in the Gulf of Mexico , the storm re @-@ claimed its tropical storm status and it made another landfall across the Florida peninsula and continued into the Atlantic Ocean . In the Atlantic , Gordon rapidly strengthened to a Category 1 hurricane . Gordon 's characteristic briefly approached North Carolina , but ultimately the storm headed south , weakening into a minor tropical storm before making its sixth and final landfall on Florida 's east coast . Overall , the storm made six separate landfalls . 
 Hurricane Gordon caused heavy damage and 1 @,@ 122 fatalities in Haiti ; the storm 's effects extended from Costa Rica to North Carolina in the United States . Over Hispaniola , the persistent southerly flow to the east of the storm , combined with the steep upslope motion of the land , generated prolonged rainfall which triggered disastrous flooding and mudslides . The extreme flooding led to an estimated 1 @,@ 122 fatalities in Haiti , although some reports indicate that up to 2 @,@ 000 people died . Six deaths were also reported in Costa Rica . Elsewhere , five fatalities were reported in the Dominican Republic , two in Jamaica , and two in Cuba . In Florida , the storm caused eight fatalities and 43 injuries . In Volusia County , 1 @,@ 236 buildings reported flood damage . In the state , damage totaled $ 400 million ( 1994 USD ; $ 639 million 2016 USD ) . 
 = = = Other storms = = = 
 A weak and broad frontal low absorbed the remnants of Tropical Depression Ten in the central Gulf of Mexico . The Hydrometeorological Prediction Center identified the system as a subtropical storm on October 1 . The subtropical storm moved across Florida and the Southeastern United States on October 2 and 3 ; when it reached the Atlantic Coast , it became an extratropical frontal wave . However , the National Hurricane Center does not confirm the existence of the subtropical cyclone . 
 In addition to the seven named storms , a nor 'easter formed in late December . As it entered the warm waters of the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean , it began to rapidly intensify , exhibiting signs of tropical development , including the formation of an eye . It attained a pressure of 970 millibars on December 23 and 24 , and after moving northward , it came ashore near New York City on Christmas Eve . However , due to the uncertain nature of the storm , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) did not classify it as a tropical cyclone .

 = M @-@ 85 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 85 , also known as Fort Street or Fort Road for its entire length , is a state trunkline highway in the U.S. state of Michigan . The highway serves several Downriver suburbs of Detroit , as well as neighborhoods in the city itself . From its southern terminus at exit 28 on Interstate 75 ( I @-@ 75 ) to its second interchange with exit 43 on I @-@ 75 in southwest Detroit , M @-@ 85 is part of the Lake Erie Circle Tour . In between , it serves mostly residential areas running parallel to a pair of rail lines ; the highway carries between 5 @,@ 000 and 43 @,@ 000 vehicles per day on average . Once in the city of Detroit , Fort Street runs parallel to I @-@ 75 for several miles before they separate near the Ambassador Bridge . The northern end of M @-@ 85 is at the intersection with Griswold Street in downtown Detroit , one block away from Campus Martius Park . 
 Two previous unrelated highways bore the M @-@ 85 designation . The first was in Montcalm County and the second near Caro . These uses were retired in the 1930s and the 1940s , respectively . The current M @-@ 85 was created in 1956 after the construction of the Detroit @-@ Toledo Freeway ; the original northern end was at an intersection with US Highway 25 ( US 25 ) in downtown . The northern end was truncated in the late 1960s to the northern junction with I @-@ 75 . The highway was then extended back into downtown Detroit in the first year of the 21st century . 
 = = Route description = = 
 M @-@ 85 starts a directional interchange with I @-@ 75 in near Rockwood ; traffic to or from southbound I @-@ 75 must use Gibraltar Road instead . M @-@ 85 runs north from this interchange to Gibraltar Road as a full freeway ; north of that intersection the highway becomes a boulevard . There are many businesses directly adjacent to Fort Street in the Downriver area with residential subdivisions on either side of them . The trunkline parallels lines of the Norfolk Southern and Canadian National railways . In this area , M @-@ 85 is also running parallel to , but inland from , the southern part of the Detroit River . The highway runs northeasterly through Gibraltar to Trenton , where it turns due north . Fort Street forms the boundary between Riverview and Trenton in the area near the Riverview Landing Shopping Center ; north of here , Riverview extends along both sides of the road . At Pennsylvania Road , Fort Street crosses into the city of Southgate and curves to the northeast . The highway returns to a due northerly course near Memorial Park and continues along the Southgate – Wyandotte city line . This area is mainly residential neighborhoods that extend in street grids on either side of the Fort Street boulevard . 
 The highway crosses the South Branch of the Ecorse River and enters the city of Lincoln Park . Through this Detroit suburb , Fort Street angles slightly northeasterly before turning sharply to the northeast at Champaign Road . M @-@ 85 's new direction keeps it parallel to the Detroit River about one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) away . When the trunkline crosses the North Branch of the Ecorse River , M @-@ 85 enters the city of Detroit near Outer Drive . Fort Street runs parallel to I @-@ 75 through the Boynton – Oakwood Heights neighborhoods of the city . North of the intersection with Schaefer Highway , M @-@ 85 meets an interchange with I @-@ 75 and passes under the freeway , crossing to its northwest side . At this interchange , the LECT designation is transferred from M @-@ 85 to I @-@ 75 . Fort Street continues running between an industrial area and I @-@ 75 . In this area , the highway crosses more rail lines belonging to Norfolk Southern and Conrail before crossing the River Rouge and turning east @-@ northeast . Fort Street continues through the Delray neighborhood and crosses under I @-@ 75 again ; there is no interchange at this location . These two highways continue in parallel to the north of Fort Wayne and the Detroit Harbor Terminals / <unk> Island Detroit Dock Building ; M @-@ 85 intersects Grand Boulevard and passes under the approaches for the Ambassador Bridge ; I @-@ 75 turns inland near the bridge 's toll plaza north of Fort Street . M @-@ 85 continues along the river into the Corktown neighborhood . 
 As M @-@ 85 approaches downtown , it crosses over the Michigan Central Railway Tunnel . Several blocks later , the highway passes over M @-@ 10 ( Lodge Freeway ) without an interchange near Joe Louis Arena . Fort Street continues carrying the M @-@ 85 designation as far east as the intersection with Griswold Street ; this intersection is also the location of the Chase Tower and the Cadillac Tower one block west of Cadillac Square . 
 M @-@ 85 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) like other state highways in Michigan . As a part of these maintenance responsibilities , the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction . These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic , which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway .

 = German nationalism in Austria = 
 German nationalism ( German : <unk> ) is a political ideology and historical current in Austrian politics . It arose in the 19th century as a nationalist movement amongst the German @-@ speaking population of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Empire . It favours close ties with Germany , which it views as the nation @-@ state for all ethnic Germans , and the possibility of the incorporation of Austria into a Greater Germany . 
 Over the course of Austrian history , from the Austrian Empire , to Austria @-@ Hungary , and the First and the Second Austrian Republics , several political parties and groups have expressed pan @-@ German nationalist sentiment . National liberal and pan @-@ Germanist parties have been termed the " Third Camp " ( German : <unk> Lager ) of Austrian politics , as they have traditionally been ranked behind mainstream Catholic conservatives and socialists . The Freedom Party of Austria , a far @-@ right political party with representation in the Austrian parliament , has pan @-@ Germanist roots . After the Second World War , both pan @-@ Germanism and the idea of political union with Germany were discredited by their association with Nazism , and by the rising tide of a civic Austrian national identity . 
 = = During the imperial period = = 
 Within the context of rising ethnic nationalism during the 19th century in the territories of the multi @-@ ethnic Austrian Empire , the " German National Movement " ( German : <unk> Bewegung ) sought the creation of a Greater Germany , along with the implementation of anti @-@ semitic and anti @-@ clerical policies , in an attempt to entrench the German ethnic identity . Starting with the revolutions of 1848 , many ethnic groups under imperial rule , including the Czechs , Italians , Croats , Slovenes , and Poles , amongst others , demanded political , economic , and cultural equality . Traditionally , the German @-@ speaking population of the Empire enjoyed societal privileges dating back to the reign of Empress Maria Theresa , and that of her son , Joseph II . German was considered the lingua franca of the Empire , and Empire 's elite consisted primarily of German @-@ speakers . The struggle between the many ethnic groups of the Empire and German @-@ speakers defined the social and political landscape of the Empire from the 1870s , after the Compromise of 1867 , which granted renewed sovereignty to the Kingdom of Hungary , until the dissolution of the Empire after the First World War . After the Austrian defeat in the Battle of Königgrätz of 1866 , and the unification of the what was known as " Lesser Germany " under Prussian stewardship in 1871 , German @-@ speakers in the Empire felt that they had been excluded from the German nation @-@ state , whilst other ethnicities within the Empire were tearing at its fabric . Conflict between Germans and Czechs grew particularly tense in 1879 , when minister @-@ president Viscount Taaffe did not include the German @-@ Liberal Party ( German : <unk> Partei ) in the government of Cisleithania . This party was considered the main representative of the German @-@ speaking middle class , and as such , the German National Movement went on to accuse the Party of not fighting for the rights of German @-@ speakers within the Empire . The " German School League " ( German : Deutscher <unk> ) was formed in 1880 to protect German @-@ language schools in parts of the Empire where German speakers were a minority . It promoted the establishment of German @-@ language schools in communities where public funding was used for non @-@ German schools . 
 A consortium of German nationalist groups and intellectuals published the Linz Program in 1882 , which demanded the recognition of German predominance in the Empire , along with the complete Germanisation of the Empire . This manifesto was signed by the radical German nationalist Georg von Schönerer , Vienna 's populist , pro @-@ Catholic , and royalist mayor Karl Lueger , and the Jewish social democrat Victor Adler . The diverse signatories of the Linz manifesto split ideologically after Schönerer revised it to add an " Aryan paragraph " in 1885 . 
 Schönerer founded the " German National Society " , and later , in 1891 , the " Pan @-@ German Society " . He demanded the annexation of all German @-@ speaking territories of Austria @-@ Hungary to the Prussian @-@ led German Empire and rejected any form of Austrian pan @-@ ethnic identity . His radical racist German nationalism was especially popular amongst the well @-@ educated intelligentsia : professors , grammar school teachers , and students . School administrations tried to counteract these sentiments by encouraging civic pride , along with a " cult of personality " around the Emperor , but these efforts were largely unsuccessful . Vienna mayor Karl Lueger even tried to dismiss all " <unk> " from city school administrations , but this too failed . National @-@ minded students rather identified with the Prussian @-@ led German Empire than with the multiethnic Dual Monarchy . Many idolised the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck , victor in the Battle of Königgrätz . Members of the pan @-@ German movement wore blue <unk> , known to be the favourite flower of German Emperor William I , in their <unk> , along with cockades in the German national colours ( black , red , and yellow ) . Both symbols were temporarily banned in Austrian schools . By contrast with the German National Society , the " German Club " accepted the Habsburg dynasty , and the sovereignty of Austria . The majority of German nationalists and liberals adhered to this more moderate ideology . 
 German nationalists protested vehemently against minister @-@ president Kasimir Count Badeni 's language decree of 1897 , which made German and Czech co @-@ official languages in Bohemia and required new government officials to be fluent in both languages . This meant in practice that the civil service would almost exclusively hire Czechs , because most educated Czechs knew German , but not the other way around . The support of <unk> Catholic politicians and clergy for this reform triggered the launch of the " Away from Rome " ( German : Los @-@ von @-@ Rom ) movement , which was initiated by supporters of Schönerer and called on " German " Christians to leave the Roman Catholic Church . 
 From the 1880s , the pan @-@ Germanist movement was fragmented into several splinter parties and factions . The most radical was the German Workers ' Party , formed in 1903 , which later transformed into the Austrian wing of the Nazi Party . Other pan @-@ Germanist parties that contested elections during the first decade of the 20th century include the German People 's Party and the German Radical Party . A broad coalition of all ethnic German national and liberal political parties known as the Deutscher <unk> ( lit . German National Association ) was formed to contest the 1911 election to the <unk> Imperial Council . It went on to gain the most seats in lower house of the Council , the House of Deputies ( German : <unk> ) , replacing the previously dominant Christian Social Party . Despite this victory , the German National Association was always a very loose coalition with little unity amongst its ranks , and collapsed in 1917 at the height of First World War . It disintegrated into seventeen scattered German liberal and national parties . This disintegration , combined with dissolution of Austria @-@ Hungary at the end of the First World War , led to the total fragmentation of pan @-@ Germanist movement . 
 = = Dissolution of Austria @-@ Hungary ( 1918 – 1919 ) = = 
 After the end of the First World War , which saw the collapse of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Empire , German @-@ speaking parts of the former Empire established a new republic under the name " German Austria " ( German : Deutsch @-@ Österreich ) . The republic was proclaimed on the principle of self @-@ determination , which had been enshrined within American president Woodrow Wilson 's Fourteen Points . A provisional national assembly was convened on 11 November , at which the Republic of German Austria was proclaimed . The assembly drafted a constitution that stated that " German Austria is a democratic republic " ( Article 1 ) and " German Austria is a component of the German Republic " ( Article 2 ) . This phrase referenced the establishment of the Weimar Republic in the former lands of the German Empire , and intended to unite German @-@ speaking Austrians with the German nation @-@ state , completing the Greater Germany plan . Plebiscites held in Tyrol and Salzburg yielded majorities of 98 % and 99 % respectively in favour of unification with Germany . 
 Despite this , the victors of the First World War , who drafted the treaties of Versailles and Saint @-@ Germain @-@ en @-@ Laye , strictly forbid any attempt by German Austria to unify with Germany . They also gave some lands that had been claimed by German Austria to newly formed nation @-@ states . An example of this was the giving of the provinces of German Bohemia and the Sudetenland to the Czecho @-@ Slovak Republic . These lands , having German @-@ speaking majorities , were prevented from being within their own nation @-@ state . Instead , they were trapped in the nation @-@ states of other ethnicities . This grievance would play a fundamental part in the rise of pan @-@ Germanism during the Interwar period . Karl Renner , a member of the Social Democratic Workers ' Party , served as chancellor of German Austria . Renner himself was a proponent of the idea of " Greater Germany " , and penned the unofficial anthem <unk> , du <unk> Land ( " German Austria , you wonderful country " ) . Renner was born in southern Moravia , which was one of the lands claimed by German Austria , but instead given to the Czecho @-@ Slovak Republic . Despite his background , however , he signed the Treaty of Saint @-@ Germain on 10 September 1919 , which established the Allied @-@ drawn borders of the new Austrian republic , and formally forbid any attempt to unify the German @-@ speaking lands of the former Austria @-@ Hungary with Germany . The name " German Austria " was changed to " Austria " , removing any hint of pan @-@ Germanist sentiment from the name of the state . Nevertheless , the Social Democrats would not forget their pan @-@ Germanist roots . To them , the Weimar Republic was regarded with " exaggerated sympathy " , whilst the Czecho @-@ Slovak Republic was viewed with " exaggerated suspicion " . 
 = = During the First Republic and <unk> period ( 1919 – 1938 ) = = 
 During the First Austrian Republic , pan @-@ Germanists were represented by the Greater German People 's Party and the agrarian <unk> . Although initially influential , these two groups soon lost most of their voters to the Christian Social Party and the Social Democratic Party . Both the Christian Socials and the Social Democrats accepted that unification between Austria and Germany was forbidden by the Treaty of Saint @-@ Germain . A conflict would develop , however , between those who supported an Austrian national identity , such as the Christian Socials , and those rooted in German nationalism , such as the Social Democrats . 
 One of the foundational problems of the First Republic was that those who had supported the concept of a democratic republic from the German Austria period onward , such as the Social Democrats , did not consider themselves " Austrian " , but instead were German nationalists . Those who supported an Austrian national identity , an Austria without the word " German " attached , were conservative and largely undemocratic in persuasion : former Imperial bureaucrats , army officers , priests , aristocrats , and affiliated with the Christian Social Party . In the words of historian A. J. P. Taylor , " The democrats were not ' Austrian ' ; the ' Austrians ' were not democrats . " These two groups , the German nationalist democrats , and the Austrian nationalist conservatives , would squabble throughout the first decade of the First Republic . Ultimately , the Austrian nationalist faction would overthrow the democratic republic in 1934 and establish a regime rooted in " <unk> " under the protection of Fascist Italy . 
 While most of right @-@ wing <unk> paramilitary groups active during the First Republic were rooted in Austrian nationalism , and either affiliated with the conservative Christian Socials , or inspired by Italian Fascism , there was also a German nationalist faction . This faction was most notable within the Styrian Heimatschutz ( " homeland protection " ) . Its leader , Walter Pfrimer , attempted a putsch against a Christian Social government in September 1931 . The putsch was directly modelled on the Benito Mussolini 's March on Rome , but failed almost instantly due to lack of support from other Heimwehr groups . Pfrimer subsequently founded the " German Heimatschutz " , which would later merge into the Nazi Party . 
 The idea of an Anschluss , that is , annexation of Austria to Germany in an attempt to create a Greater Germany , was one of the principle ideas of the Austrian branch of the National Socialist ( Nazi ) Party . Nazism can be seen as descended from the radical branches of the pan @-@ Germanist movement . In 1933 , the Nazis and the Greater German People 's Party formed a joint working @-@ group , and eventually merged . During the period while the Nazi Party and its symbols were banned in Austria , from 1933 to 1938 , Austrian Nazis resumed the earlier pan @-@ Germanist tradition of wearing a blue cornflower in their buttonhole . 
 The Nazis firmly fought the austrofascist regime of chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss , and orchestrated his assassination . They continued this battle against his successor , Kurt Schuschnigg . <unk> was strongly supported by Benito Mussolini , leader of Fascist Italy . Mussolini 's support for an independent Austria can be seen in a discussion he had with Prince Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg , an important Austrian nationalist and Heimwehr leader . He said that " an Anschluss with Germany must never be permitted ... Austria is necessary to the maintenance of Europe ... the day that Austria falls and is swallowed up by Germany will mark the beginning of European chaos . " The austrofascist party , Fatherland Front , would echo the sentiments of Mussolini , and continue to struggle for an independent Austria . Nazis in both Germany and Austria intended that the German Reich would quickly annex Austria , the homeland of its leader , Adolf Hitler . They attempted to bribe many low @-@ ranking Heimwehr leaders , and also attempted to bring Starhemberg into their fold , in effect merging the Heimwehr with the Nazi Freikorps . Gregor Strasser , a prominent Nazi figure , was charged with this effort . When Starhemberg , a fervent believer in an independent Austria , rejected his merger proposal , Strasser said " Don 't talk to me about Austria . There is no Austria ... there was once a living corpse which called itself Austria ... that this Austria collapsed in 1918 was a blessing ... particularly for the German people , who were thereby given the chance to create a Greater Germany . " 
 After this , tensions between the Nazis and <unk> worsened , culminating in the July Putsch of 1934 , when Nazis attempted to overthrow the government . Whilst they managed to assassinate chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss , the putsch was quickly crushed by the police , army , and <unk> . In the aftermath of the putsch , conflict between the Social Democrats and the ruling <unk> led to the Austrian Civil War later in the year . After their defeat , the Social Democratic Party was outlawed entirely . This , in tandem with a continued a campaign of violence and propaganda by the Nazis , destabilised the austrofascist regime , and rallied many to support the idea of Anschluss . The Nazi campaign was ultimately successful , and Hitler would go on to annex Austria in 1938 with the Anschluss . The historical aim of the pan @-@ Germanist movement in Austria was achieved . The pan @-@ Germanists were then fully absorbed into the Nazi Party ( NSDAP ) . 
 = = During the Second Republic ( since 1945 ) = = 
 After the end of the Second World War , when Austria was re @-@ established as an independent state , the German nationalist movement was discredited because of its links to the former Nazi regime . The dominant parties of the new republic were the Christian conservative Austrian People 's Party and the Socialist Party . Both promoted Austrian independence , and considered the idea of a " Greater Germany " an anachronism . All former members of the Nazi party were banned from any political activity , and disenfranchised . The pan @-@ Germanist and liberal " Third Camp " was later revived in the form of the Federation of Independents ( German : Verband der <unk> ) , which fought De @-@ Nazification laws imposed by the Allies , and represented the interests of former Nazis , Wehrmacht , and SS soldiers . In 1956 , the Federation was transformed into the Freedom Party of Austria . In the 1950s and 1960s , the German nationalist movement , represented by the Freedom Party and its affiliated organisations , was very active in universities , where the Burschenschaften , a type of student fraternity , helped spread German nationalist and liberal views . Inside the Freedom Party , the liberal wing grew to overtake the pan @-@ Germanist wing , and Austrian patriotism was gradually incorporated into the party 's ideology . During Norbert Steger 's party leadership during 1980 – 1986 , and the Freedom Party 's participation in a coalition government with the Social Democrats , the pan @-@ Germanist faction was weakened further . 
 By contrast , Jörg Haider 's assumption of party leadership in 1986 was considered a triumph by the German nationalist faction . However , Haider 's right @-@ wing populism did not stress pan @-@ Germanist traditions , as doing so would have cost votes . In 1987 , only six percent of Austrian citizens identified themselves as " Germans " . While Haider had branded Austrian national identity as an ideological construct , going so far to refer to it as a " monstrosity " ( German : <unk> ) in 1988 , he launched the " Austria First " petition in 1993 , and claimed two years later that the Freedom Party was a " classical Austrian patriotic party " , expressly renouncing his earlier " monstrosity " statement . The influence of German nationalism was still present , however , and could be seen in hostile actions against Slavic minorities in Austria , such as in conflicts over bilingual road sign with the Carinthian Slovenes , along with hostility to immigration and European integration . Traditional Greater German ideas have therefore been replaced by a German @-@ Austrian concept ( i.e. only considering Austrians of German origin and tongue as " real " Austrians ) . This may be summarised as an " amalgamation of traditional German nationalism with Austrian patriotism " . 
 Presently , the pan @-@ Germanist wing is only a minor faction within the Freedom Party . In 2008 , fewer than seventeen percent of the Freedom Party 's voters questioned the existence of a unique Austrian national identity . German nationalists , including Andreas <unk> and Martin Graf , now refer to themselves as " cultural Germans " ( <unk> ) , and stress the importance of their identity as ethnic Germans , in contrast to the distinct Austrian national identity . In 2006 , FPÖ members of parliament reaffirmed the party 's root in the pan @-@ Germanist tradition , at least symbolically , by wearing blue <unk> in their <unk> , along with ribbons in Austria 's national colours ( red and white ) , during the initial meeting of the National Council . This caused controversy , as the media interpreted the flower as a former Nazi symbol .

 = Operation Fustian = 
 Operation Fustian was an airborne forces operation undertaken during the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943 in the Second World War . The operation was carried out by Brigadier Gerald Lathbury 's 1st Parachute Brigade , part of the British 1st Airborne Division . Their objective was the Primosole Bridge across the Simeto River . The intention was for the brigade , with glider @-@ borne forces in support , to land on both sides of the river . They would then capture the bridge and secure the surrounding area until relieved by the advance of British XIII Corps , which had landed on the south eastern coast three days previously . Because the bridge was the only crossing on the river and would give the British Eighth Army access to the Catania plain , its capture was expected to speed the advance and lead to the defeat of the Axis forces in Sicily . 
 Many of the aircraft carrying the paratroopers from North Africa were shot down or were damaged and turned back by friendly fire and enemy action . <unk> action taken by the pilots scattered the brigade over a large area and only the equivalent of two companies of troops were landed in the correct locations . Despite this and the defence by German and Italian forces , the British paratroops captured the bridge , repulsed attacks and held out against increasing odds until nightfall . The relief force led by the 50th ( Northumbrian ) Infantry Division , under Major @-@ General Sidney C. Kirkman , which was short of transport , were still 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) away when they halted for the night . By this time , with casualties mounting and supplies running short , the parachute brigade commander , Gerald Lathbury , had relinquished control of the bridge to the Germans . The following day the British units joined forces and the 9th Battalion , Durham Light Infantry , with tank support , attempted to recapture the bridge . The bridge was not finally secured until three days after the start of the operation , when another battalion of the Durham Light Infantry , led by the paratroopers , established a bridgehead on the north bank of the river . 
 The capture of Primosole Bridge did not lead to the expected rapid advance , as by this time the Germans had gathered their forces and established a defensive line . It was not until early the following month that the Eighth Army captured Catania . By this time the 1st Parachute Brigade had been withdrawn to Malta and took no further part in the conquest of Sicily . Lessons were learned from the operation and were put into practice in Allied airborne operations . 
 = = Background = = 
 After the Axis powers were defeated in North Africa , the Allied armies ' next logical objective was to cross the Mediterranean , landing in either the south of France , the Balkans , Sicily or Italy . The objective chosen was Sicily , with the landing scheduled for 10 July 1943 . The Allied 15th Army Group was commanded by General Sir Harold Alexander . It consisted of the United States Seventh Army , commanded by Lieutenant General George S. Patton , which would land in the west between Licata and Scoglitti , and the veteran British Eighth Army , commanded by the experienced General Bernard Montgomery , which would land in the south east between Cape Passero and Syracuse . 
 In addition to the seaborne landings , there were also airborne landings during the invasion . The US 82nd Airborne Division would land in support of the Seventh Army , while the British 1st Airborne Division conducted brigade @-@ sized landings along the eastern coast to support the Eighth Army . 
 The first British airborne landing was Operation Ladbroke , which was carried out by the 1st Airlanding Brigade during the night of 9 – 10 July . Their objective was to seize and hold the Ponte Grande bridge just outside Syracuse . The second British airborne mission , Operation Glutton , was to have been undertaken by the 2nd Parachute Brigade on the night of 10 – 11 July , aiming to capture a bridge beside Augusta . However circumstances changed and the second operation was cancelled . 
 The third British airborne mission planned was Operation Fustian , to be carried out by the 1st Parachute Brigade , and scheduled for the night of 13 – 14 July . The 1st Parachute Brigade 's objective was the Primosole bridge , crossing the Simeto River , south of Catania . The bridge was a vital objective , as it was the only crossing point over the Simeto . Its capture would give the Eighth Army access to the Catania plain , to enable them to continue their advance northwards ; its destruction would seriously hamper the advance . Once the parachute brigade had captured the bridge , they would then have to defend it until relieved by units of the Eighth Army advancing from the landing beaches . 
 = = = British forces = = = 
 The 1st Parachute Brigade was commanded by Brigadier Gerald Lathbury and comprised the 1st Parachute Battalion , the 2nd Parachute Battalion , the 3rd Parachute Battalion , the 16th ( Parachute ) Field Ambulance , the 1st ( Parachute ) Squadron , Royal Engineers and the 1st ( Airlanding ) Anti @-@ Tank Battery , Royal Artillery . The airlanding anti @-@ tank battery were equipped with the 1st Para Brigade 's only anti @-@ tank guns , the British 6 pounder . Despite the formation being a parachute brigade , the only way to transport the anti @-@ tank guns and the jeeps required to pull them when they had landed , was by glider . Transporting artillery by air was something new to the British or any other army , and this would be the first time that any artillery guns had ever been flown into combat . 
 The 1st Parachute Brigade was an experienced formation , initially under command of the 1st Airborne Division before being detached from the division to fight in North Africa . The brigade had taken part in the landings in Algeria in November 1942 and the subsequent Battle of Tunisia , during which each of the brigade 's three parachute battalions had taken part in their own battalion @-@ sized parachute landings . It was during this campaign that the 1st Parachute Brigade had been given their nickname the Red Devils by the Germans . A British parachute battalion had an establishment of 556 men in three rifle companies . Each of the companies were divided into a small headquarters and three platoons . The platoons had three sections ; each section had a Bren machine gun and a 2 @-@ inch mortar as well as the men 's own personal weapons . The only heavy weapons in the parachute battalion were in the 3 @-@ inch Mortar platoon and the Vickers machine gun platoon which were part of the battalion headquarters . 
 It was decided that the brigade 's paratroops would land on four separate drop zones and that the gliders would land at two landing zones . The paratroops of the 1st Parachute Battalion were divided into two groups , one of which would land at ' Drop zone One ' to the north of the river , and the second at ' Drop zone Two ' to the south of it . Once they had landed the two groups would head for their assembly points , before conducting an assault on the bridge from both sides simultaneously . The 2nd Parachute Battalion were to be landed south of the bridge on ' Drop zone Three ' , in the area between the <unk> Canal and the main highway . The 2nd Battalion then had to assault and occupy three small hills , which had been given the codenames ' Johnny I ' , ' Johnny II ' and ' Johnny III ' . The hills were believed to be occupied by an Italian force of around platoon strength . Once the battalion had secured the three hills , they were to dig in and prepare to defend the hills against an attack from the south . The 3rd Parachute Battalion would land at ' Drop zone Four ' , 1 @,@ 000 yards ( 910 m ) north of the bridge . Their objective was to secure the ground in this area , defending against any counterattack from the direction of Catania . The brigade 's glider force had two landing areas , ' Landing zone Seven ' north of the river and ' Landing zone Eight ' south of the river . Owing to the complexity of the landing plan and the short time between inception and execution , the pathfinders belonging to the 21st Independent Parachute Company , Army Air Corps , would be deployed to mark the correct drop zones . This was the first occasion this had been done in British airborne operations . The pathfinder company had special marker lights and Rebecca and Eureka beacons that the transport aircraft and gliders would be able to identify and home in on . 
 The senior officers of the 1st Airborne Division had estimated that there would be around 450 casualties during the capture of the bridge , of which 25 per cent would be killed or missing , and the other 75 per cent wounded . It was appreciated that by themselves the three battalions ' medical officers and staff would be unable to cope with the expected numbers of casualties , so one section from the 16th ( Parachute ) Field Ambulance , consisting of one doctor and 16 other ranks , would be attached to each of the parachute battalions . The remainder of the field ambulance , comprising the headquarters with two surgical teams , would be co @-@ located with the brigade and establish their main dressing station in farm buildings to the south of the bridge . 
 After problems with the first two airborne operations in Sicily , the Royal Air Force advisor assigned to the 1st Airborne Division suggested that the American C @-@ 47 pilots adopt the Royal Air Force bomber stream formation . This entailed the aircraft flying in pairs one behind the other with one minute between each aircraft , instead of flying in their normal ' V ' formation . The suggestion was dismissed by the American pilots , who were mostly pre @-@ war airline pilots , not least because their training had not included any instruction in night time navigation and the inexperienced crews relied heavily on following the aircraft in front . 
 Unconnected with Operation Fustian , but being conducted at the same time , No. 3 Commando would carry out a separate operation 8 miles ( 13 km ) to the south of the Simeto River . The commando unit were to carry out an amphibious landing from the sea , then assault and capture the Malati Bridge over the Leonardo River . 
 The relieving force for both the commandos and paratroopers would be from British XIII Corps , commanded by Lieutenant @-@ General Miles C. Dempsey . The corps consisted of the 5th Infantry Division , 50th ( Northumbrian ) Infantry Division and the 4th Armoured Brigade . The armoured brigade , with three tank regiments , was equipped with the American built Sherman tank . Early on 13 July the commander of the 50th Division , Major @-@ General Sidney C. Kirkman , was called to General Montgomery 's Eighth Army headquarters . Here he was informed about the two missions by the British Commandos and the 1st Parachute Brigade , and the requirement for the bridges to be captured intact . Montgomery 's intention was for the 50th Division to lead the Eighth Army 's advance and relieve the commandos and the paratroopers . To assist Kirkman in the task , Montgomery placed the 4th Armoured Brigade under his command . Montgomery was insistent that he wanted the infantry division to relieve the parachute brigade early on 14 July , which would require the division to advance around 25 miles ( 40 km ) in 24 hours . The 50th Division had landed on 10 July and by this time had been fighting for three days non @-@ stop . With the daily temperature most of the time reaching 100 ° F ( 38 ° C ) , many of the men in the division were physically exhausted and suffering from heat exhaustion . The division 's situation was not improved by a grave error of judgement by Montgomery . During the planning for the invasion , he had overestimated the strength of the German and Italian resistance to the Allied landings . The British Eighth Army consisted mainly of infantry , tanks and heavy weapons but were light on any form of mechanical transport , so any advance by the 50th Division would have to be conducted on foot .

 The Italian Army force in the area of Primosole Bridge came from the 213 Coastal Division commanded by General Carlo Gotti . Coastal divisions were second line divisions , usually formed from men in their forties and fifties , and were intended to perform labour or other second line duties . Recruited from the local population , their officers were mostly men who had retired but had then been called up again . Their morale was low , not least because of their second rate equipment and weapons . It had been intended to improve their armaments with equipment seized from the recently disbanded Vichy French army , but when the arms arrived in Sicily , many of them had been made unusable , and some had the wrong type of ammunition or no ammunition at all . 
 The Italians were supported by German paratroopers of the 1st Parachute Division , who were ordered to move to Sicily from France , and if necessary were to parachute in on 9 July . The 1st Fallschirmjäger Machine Gun Battalion commanded by Major Werner Schmidt had landed at Catania during an Allied air raid early on 13 July . Their aircraft and anti @-@ tank guns were destroyed during the raid , so the battalion left on foot for Primosole Bridge . When Schmidt informed the divisional commander of his intentions , he was warned to expect a sea or airborne landing that night . If the Allies landed to the rear of the division , Schmidt 's battalion had to hold Primosole Bridge so that the division could escape . Forewarned in this way , the machine gun battalion started to dig in and prepare a defence around 2 @,@ 000 yards ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) to the south of the bridge once they arrived , well located to deal with any parachute or glider landing in that area . 
 = = = Primosole Bridge = = = 
 The Primosole Bridge is built from steel girders . It has a span of 400 feet ( 120 m ) , and is raised 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) above the Simeto River . The land to the north of the bridge is mainly olive and almond groves in tree @-@ lined fields . Immediately to the south of the bridge is the <unk> canal , and beyond that three prominent hills . The road crossing the bridge is Highway 114 , running from Lentini 10 miles ( 16 km ) to the south to <unk> 7 miles ( 11 km ) to the north . To assist the Italians defending the bridge , four pillbox bunkers had been constructed , two on the north bank and two on the south bank .

 At 19 : 30 on 12 July 1943 , the first aircraft carrying the 1 @,@ 856 men of the 1st Parachute Brigade took off from North Africa . The aircraft used consisted of 105 Douglas C @-@ 47 Skytrains belonging to the 51st Troop Carrier Wing , 51 each from the 60th and the 62d Troop Carrier Groups , while the 64th Troop Carrier Group supplied the other three . No. 38 Wing Royal Air Force supplied eleven Armstrong Whitworth Albemarles . Following behind the parachute force were the glider towing aircraft . These aircraft , again supplied by No. 38 Wing , comprised 12 Albemarles and seven Handley Page Halifaxes , towing 11 Horsa gliders and eight Waco gliders . The gliders were used to carry 77 men , mostly from the anti @-@ tank battery , ten 6 pounder anti @-@ tank guns and 18 jeeps . 
 The aircraft 's flight path took them around the south eastern corner of Malta and up the eastern coast of Sicily . The route was measured to ensure that the first planes arrived over the drop zones at 22 : 20 . When the planes arrived off Sicily , they were supposed to stay 10 miles ( 16 km ) offshore until reaching the Simeto River , when they would head inland for the drop zones . Somehow , 33 aircraft strayed off course and approached an Allied convoy . The naval gunners had been warned to expect an air raid , and opened fire on the American and British aircraft . Two of the planes , trying to avoid the unexpected anti @-@ aircraft fire , collided and crashed into the sea . Another two were shot down , and nine were so badly shot up , with wounded crew and passengers , that they were forced to turn back towards their airfields in North Africa . 
 Those aircraft that did reach the Sicilian coast were engaged by Axis anti @-@ aircraft guns , which shot down 37 of them . Another ten were damaged and were forced to abort their mission . Some of the inexperienced pilots now refused to go any further , and on his aircraft Lieutenant Colonel Alastair Pearson , commanding officer of the 1st Parachute Battalion , realising his plane was flying round in circles , had to threaten to shoot the crew to make them continue . The anti @-@ aircraft fire and the evasive action taken by the pilots had dispersed the aircraft formations , and the parachute drop was scattered over a large area . The violent evasive manoeuvring left some of the paratroopers in heaps on the aircraft floor , and they were unable to jump when ordered . When safely back out to sea , some of the pilots refused to try again , considering the risk too great . Of the surviving aircraft which carried on with the mission , only 39 managed to drop their paratroops within .5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) of the correct drop zone . The furthest off course were some groups from the 3rd Parachute Battalion and Royal Engineers who landed 12 miles ( 19 km ) to the south of the bridge , while another four aircraft landed their paratroops on the slopes of Mount Etna 20 miles ( 32 km ) to the north . 
 Those men of the 1st Parachute Brigade that landed on the southern drop zone were well within range of the 1st Fallschirmjäger Machine Gun Battalion . In the darkness , the Germans initially thought that the paratroopers were their own reinforcements landing , but they soon realised their mistake and opened fire . Some of those who escaped the machine gun fire were rounded up on the drop zone , and about 100 of them became prisoners of war as soon as they had touched ground . In the confusion of the landing , 50 men of the 1st Parachute Battalion had assembled , assaulted and managed to capture the bridge before the 50 Italian defenders could destroy it with the attached demolition charges . The Italians were taken prisoner , just as a second group of 40 paratroopers led by Brigadier Lathbury arrived at the bridge . Lathbury organised the safe removal of the demolition charges and set up a defensive perimeter . More paratroopers continued to gather at the bridge , and soon they numbered around 120 men , who dug in to the north and south . 
 The Brigade Headquarters and the field ambulance main dressing station were established to the south of the bridge , where the brigade 's casualties started arriving for treatment . Away from the main dressing station , the medics on the 2nd Battalion drop zone had 29 wounded as a result of the parachute drop , and there were 15 wounded on drop zone one from the 1st Battalion . 
 The first glider casualties had occurred on take off , when two aircraft towing Waco gliders crashed . While on route , one of the gliders was released early by its towing aircraft , and crashed into the sea . When they did arrive over Sicily , the element of surprise was gone , and four gliders were shot down by the coastal anti @-@ aircraft batteries . By the time the gliders arrived at their landing zones , two hours had lapsed since the parachute landings had started . One glider pilot later commented that they did not need the pathfinders , as the tracer and lights from explosions were brighter than any of the landing markers . Of the surviving glider force , only four gliders managed to land relatively unscathed , all the others being caught by the Fallschirmjäger machine gun fire and destroyed on their approach . The four intact gliders had been carrying three of the anti @-@ tank guns , which were now included in the bridge 's defences . Including the men from the gliders , the 1st Parachute Brigade had 295 men at the bridge . Shortage of manpower was not their only problem ; their only support weapons were the anti @-@ tank guns , two 3 @-@ inch mortars and a Vickers machine gun .

 By 04 : 30 on 14 July , the 1st Parachute Battalion was in control of Primosole Bridge , but the Fallschirmjäger Machine Gun Battalion were well dug in to the south . Beyond them , 140 men of the 2nd Parachute Battalion had occupied the three small hills , and taken 500 Italian prisoners . In numbers , both battalions had little more than company strength . The 3rd Parachute Battalion had suffered the worst in the scattered parachute drop , and only a few of their men had arrived at the bridge . With no command structure , they were attached to the 1st Parachute Battalion to help defend the bridge . To the north , the Italian 372nd Coastal Battalion and the Blackshirt Arditi Battalion had been informed of the parachute landings . Many of the 372nd Battalion had disappeared , while the Blackshirts mounted the first of a number of attacks on the British positions . Without the support of any heavy weapons , they were easily fought off . 
 Also at dawn the first attack by the Fallschirmjäger Machine Gun Battalion to the south began , when they opened fire with their machine guns and mortars . Their first assault was against the 2nd Parachute Battalion 's positions , and was unsuccessful . However , their next assault , later in the morning , succeeded in capturing Johnny II , the second of the small hills . Lieutenant Colonel John Frost , in command of the 2nd Parachute Battalion , immediately counterattacked , but his men were repulsed after sustaining a number of casualties . At 09 : 00 a forward observation officer attached to the 2nd Parachute Battalion managed to make radio contact with the British cruiser HMS Newfoundland , which then used its 6 @-@ inch guns to target the Fallschirmjäger positions . The naval gunfire had the desired effect , causing the Germans some casualties and keeping them under cover . From then on , German resistance from the south was restricted to harassing machine gun fire . A grass fire they started did force the 2nd Parachute Battalion to abandon Johnny I , and the remnants of the battalion now concentrated on Johnny III . 
 To the north of the bridge , a German battle group of 350 men , including the 1st Company , 1st Fallschirmjäger Signal Battalion , an anti @-@ aircraft battery and some anti @-@ tank guns , was gathered under the command of Captain Franz Strangenberg . Strangenberg was in position to launch his first assault on the bridge at 14 : 00 . This first attack was driven off by the British paratroopers . For his second attempt Strangenberg brought up three 88 mm anti @-@ aircraft guns in support . This assault was more successful , taking some prisoners , and almost succeeded in reaching the bridge . It also secured a position for the 88s to engage the two pillboxes on the north bank . By 17 : 00 the men of the 1st Parachute Battalion were almost out of ammunition , and were forced to withdraw to the southern side of the bridge . The German 88s were moved forward again , and this time demolished the pillboxes on the south side . Running short of supplies and with his casualties mounting , Brigadier Lathbury made the decision to relinquish control of the bridge to the Germans , and the parachute brigade moved back 1 @,@ 200 yards ( 1 @,@ 100 m ) . Of the 295 men who had been at the bridge , 115 had become casualties . The 16th ( Parachute ) Field Ambulance main dressing station could not be moved or evacuated , and remained behind in no man 's land . 
 An Italian officer entered the station , and informed the medical staff they were now prisoners of war . But since they were treating casualties from both sides , they were allowed to remain and continue operating . Treatment of the wounded continued all day , and by 22 : 00 the surgeons had carried out 21 surgical operations and were looking after 62 British and 29 German or Italian patients . At 18 : 30 , in the darkness , Lathbury led the remainder of his men to join the 2nd Parachute Battalion . 
 By dawn , the 50th ( Northumbrian ) Infantry Division had only managed to advance 10 miles ( 16 km ) , and were still 8 miles ( 13 km ) from No. 3 Commando at the Melati bridge and 15 miles ( 24 km ) from Primosole Bridge . It was not until 17 : 00 that the 5th Battalion , East Yorkshire Regiment , part of the 69th Infantry Brigade , eventually reached Malati Bridge , although by now the commandos had been forced to withdraw . The bridge was quickly captured ; the commandos had dismantled the demolition charges so that it could not be demolished . With their first objective secured , the British infantry continued their advance on foot towards the parachute brigade . The tanks and small amount of motor transport belonging to the 4th Armoured Brigade had been held up even further back . They had been stopped in <unk> by a destroyed bridge , and the 4th Armoured Brigade did not start moving again until after 19 : 00 . 
 The 50th ( Northumbrian ) Division eventually reached Lentini , about half way from their start point to Primosole Bridge , in the afternoon . Here the streets were blocked by debris , covered by snipers and machine gunners left as a rearguard by the retreating Germans . By nightfall only one of the 50th ( Northumbrian ) Division 's infantry battalions , the 6th Battalion , Durham Light Infantry , of 151st Infantry Brigade , with some tanks in support , had reached a position 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from Johnny II . Despite their orders to advance at all speed , they halted for the night . 
 = = = Recapture of the bridge = = = 
 After the parachute brigade withdrew , the Axis forces gathered at the bridge . They now comprised the Italian 372nd Coastal Battalion and the Blackshirt Arditi Battalion , with the German 1st Fallschirmjäger Machine Gun Battalion and Captain <unk> 's Battle group . The German High Command was aware of the importance of holding the bridge , and overnight they dispatched reinforcements who arrived by parachute . These came from the 1st Fallschirmjäger Division , and consisted of the 1st Fallschirmjäger Engineer Battalion , the 1st Battalion , 4th Fallschirmjäger Regiment and a battalion of the 1st Fallschirmjäger Artillery Regiment . The Fallschirmjäger engineers started to form a defensive line to the north of the bridge , and a smaller one on the southern bank . 
 Early on 15 July , the 1st Parachute Brigade heard tank fire to the south of their position . Brigadier Lathbury sent out a patrol to investigate , which located the tanks and infantry of XIII Corps that had halted just south of them the previous night . The 1st Parachute Brigade and 50th ( Northumbrian ) Division now moved forward together . The main dressing station , which had continued to operate after being captured , was liberated by the 2nd Parachute Battalion . In an attempt to recapture Primosole Bridge the 9th Battalion , Durham Light Infantry , supported by the 44th Royal Tank Regiment , carried out a number of assaults . At one stage they managed to cross the bridge , but three Sherman tanks accompanying them were knocked out by the German 88s , and with no armoured support the infantry were forced to withdraw . However , an error in communication caused the Fallschirmjäger Engineer Battalion to withdraw to the north bank of the river , and this allowed the <unk> to establish a position at the southern end of the bridge . At the main dressing station the surgeons had operated on another 14 wounded by the time ambulances arrived from XIII Corps at 17 : 00 to evacuate the wounded . At 18 : 00 the Main Dressing Station was closed and the men moved to Johnny I. During the time the main dressing station had been active , the surgeons had completed 31 operations , and the medics had treated 109 wounded . 
 The Germans were aware that the British paratroopers had dismantled the explosive charges attached to Primosole Bridge , and now attempted to destroy it by driving trucks laden with explosives onto it . This was unsuccessful . 
 During the night the 9th Battalion , Durham Light Infantry continued trying to capture the bridge . Their attacks also provided a distraction for the Germans while Lieutenant Colonel Pearson of the 1st Parachute Battalion led two companies of the 8th Battalion , Durham Light Infantry across the Simeto River using a small ford to establish another bridgehead on the northern bank . During the day 's battle both the British and Germans suffered heavy casualties , but the bridge was eventually retaken by the British infantry . 
 Leaving the British Eighth Army to continue their advance , at 07 : 00 16 July the 1st Parachute Brigade were transported in trucks to Syracuse , where they embarked on a LST . Here they remained overnight , sitting through a two @-@ hour air raid , and sailed for Valletta at 12 : 00 on 17 July . In Operation Fustian they had suffered around 141 dead , and 168 missing or wounded . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The recapture of Primosole Bridge did not result in the rapid advance over the Catania plain envisioned by Montgomery . The by now exhausted 50th ( Northumbrian ) Infantry Division was holding a position based on the bridge . The 5th Infantry Division took over the lead , but after a number of attacks could not make any further progress . Its 13th Infantry Brigade had to establish another bridgehead across the Simeto , but the Germans had brought in more troops and prepared defensive positions , and after hard fighting it was not until 5 August 1943 that the Eighth Army entered the city of Catania itself . Further hard fighting followed , and they entered Messina just after the United States Seventh Army on 17 August 1943 . 
 After an enquiry into the problems with the airborne missions in Sicily , the British Army and Royal Air Force submitted some recommendations . Aircrew had to be trained in parachute and glider operations , and pathfinders landing before the main force had to have enough time to set out their beacons . The landing plan was simplified , with complete brigades landing on one drop zone , instead of the smaller battalion landing areas used in Sicily . Gliders were no longer released at night while still over water , and their landing zones would be large enough to accommodate the aircraft with room to spare . Following the friendly fire incident over the convoy , more training was given to ships ' crews in aircraft recognition , and Allied aircraft were painted with three large white stripes on their wings . Training for pilots belonging to the Glider Pilot Regiment was increased , and improvements to the gliders were implemented , including better inter @-@ aircraft communication . 
 For transporting paratroops , to avoid relying solely on American aircraft and pilots , No. 38 Wing Royal Air Force was expanded , becoming No. 38 Group with its Halifax squadrons , now supported by four squadrons of Albemarles and four squadrons of Stirlings . To provide another method of delivering jeeps and artillery guns by air , the air force started experiments on parachuting them into combat , carrying the jeeps and guns in the aircraft 's large bomb bays . A second Royal Air Force transport group , No. 46 Group , was formed , and was equipped solely with Dakotas , instead of the mixture of aircraft in No. 38 Group . After these changes , the Royal Air Force groups could supply 88 <unk> , 88 Stirlings , 36 Halifaxes and 150 Dakotas , a total of 362 planes , in addition to aircraft held as reserves . 
 = Operation Barras = 
 Operation Barras was a British Army operation that took place in Sierra Leone on 10 September 2000 . The operation aimed to release five British soldiers of the Royal Irish Regiment who had been held by a militia group known as the " West Side Boys " . The soldiers were part of a patrol that was returning from a visit to Jordanian peacekeepers attached to the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone ( UNAMSIL ) at <unk> on 25 August 2000 when they turned off the main road and down a track towards the village of Magbeni . There the patrol was overwhelmed by a large number of heavily armed rebels , taken prisoner , and transported to Gberi Bana on the opposite side of Rokel Creek . 
 The British Army negotiated the release of six of the eleven men on the patrol , but were not able to gain the freedom of their Sierra Leone Army liaison officer and the other men before the West Side Boys ' demands became increasingly unrealistic . Negotiators concluded that these were delaying tactics rather than an effort to resolve the crisis ; by 9 September , the soldiers had been held for over a fortnight . Fearing that the soldiers would be killed or moved to a location from which it would be more difficult to extract them , the British government authorised an assault on the West Side Boys ' base , to take place at dawn the following day , 10 September . 
 The ground operation was conducted by D Squadron , 22 Regiment Special Air Service — who assaulted Gberi Bana in a bid to extract the Royal Irish — and elements of 1st Battalion , Parachute Regiment ( 1 PARA ) , who launched a diversionary assault on Magbeni . The operation freed the five soldiers as well as twenty @-@ one Sierra Leonean civilians who had been held prisoner by the West Side Boys . At least twenty @-@ five West Side Boys were killed in the assault , as was one British soldier , while eighteen West Side Boys — including the gang 's leader , Foday Kallay — were taken prisoner and later transferred to the custody of the Sierra Leone Police . Many West Side Boys fled the area during the assault , and over 300 surrendered to UNAMSIL forces within a fortnight . 
 The operation restored confidence in the British forces operating in Sierra Leone , which had been undermined by the capture of the Royal Irish patrol . After the operation , the British government increased its support of UNAMSIL and its efforts to bring the Sierra Leone Civil War to an end , both politically , through the United Nations Security Council , and through the provision of staff officers to support UNAMSIL . The successful use of 1 PARA in Operation Barras influenced the creation of the Special Forces Support Group — a permanent unit , initially built around 1 PARA , whose role is to act as a force multiplier for British special forces on large or complex operations . 
 = = Background = = 
 Sierra Leone is a former British colony in West Africa , close to the equator , with an area of 71 @,@ 740 square kilometres ( 27 @,@ 700 square miles ) — similar in size to South Carolina or Scotland . In 2000 , the country had been consumed by a civil war since 1991 . The West Side Boys were a militia group who had been involved in the civil war . They were initially loyal to the Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) , the rebel army opposing the government . They later fought for the government , against the RUF , and were involved in at least one operation directed by British officers in exchange for weapons and medical supplies . But the West Side Boys refused to integrate into the reconstituted Sierra Leone Army and began operating as bandits from the abandoned villages of Magbeni and Gberi Bana , on opposite sides of Rokel Creek . 
 British forces were deployed to Sierra Leone in May 2000 , initially for a non @-@ combatant evacuation operation under the codename Operation Palliser , in which they were tasked with evacuating foreign nationals — particularly those from the United Kingdom , other Commonwealth countries , and others for whom the British government had accepted consular responsibility . As part of the mission , British forces secured Sierra Leone 's main airport , Lungi . Having secured Freetown and Lungi , and evacuated the foreign nationals who wished to leave , the initial forces left and were replaced by a " Short Term Training Team " ( STTT ) , whose mission was to train and rebuild the Sierra Leone Army . The STTT was initially formed from a detachment from 2nd Battalion , The Royal Anglian Regiment , who were replaced in July 2000 by 1st Battalion , The Royal Irish Regiment ( 1 R IRISH ) . 
 The Special Air Service ( SAS ) is a corps of the British Army and part of the United Kingdom 's special forces . It consists of three regiments , of which two are drawn from the Territorial Army and one regular regiment — 22 Regiment , which was involved in Operation Barras . The SAS was formed by Colonel David Stirling in Africa in 1941 , at the height of the Second World War . Its original role was to penetrate enemy lines and strike at airfields and supply lines deep in enemy territory , first in North Africa and later around the Mediterranean and in occupied Europe . Stirling established the principle of using small teams — having realised that small , well @-@ trained teams could sometimes prove much more effective than a unit of hundreds of soldiers . The SAS first entered the public eye after Operation Nimrod , the operation to end the Iranian Embassy siege in 1980 . 
 The 1st Battalion , Parachute Regiment ( 1 PARA ) is part of the British Army 's infantry and , as in the SAS , applicants must undergo an additional level of scrutiny in order to be accepted . Unlike in the SAS , new recruits to the army can apply to join the Parachute Regiment directly from the Infantry Training Centre at Catterick in Yorkshire ( in the case of soldiers ) or the Royal Military Academy , Sandhurst ( for officers ) . The regiment , whose personnel are commonly known as " paras " , specialises in parachute and other types of airborne insertion , and has close ties to the SAS , providing more of its personnel than any other regiment . 
 = = Capture of the Royal Irish patrol = = 
 On 25 August 2000 , a patrol from 1 R IRISH left their base in Waterloo to visit Jordanian peacekeepers attached to the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone ( UNAMSIL ) and based at <unk> . Over lunch , they were informed that the West Side Boys had begun to disarm , despite their initial reluctance , and the company commander — Major Alan Marshall — decided to take the patrol to investigate en route back to their base . The patrol turned off the main road onto a dirt track that led to the village of Magbeni , where the West Side Boys were based . As they approached the base , they were surrounded by a large group of West Side Boys , who used an anti @-@ aircraft gun mounted on a Bedford truck to block the patrol 's route . Marshall dismounted his vehicle , then resisted an attempt to grab his rifle and was beaten . He and the rest of the patrol were then forced into canoes at the bank of Rokel <unk> and transported to Gberi Bana , a village on the other side of the river , just upstream from the point of the initial confrontation . 
 British forces in Sierra Leone were operating on the authority of the Sierra Leone government , but President Ahmad Kabbah allowed British forces to negotiate for the soldiers ' release themselves , as his government lacked the requisite expertise . The negotiations were led by Lieutenant Colonel Simon Fordham , commanding officer of 1 R IRISH , who was assisted by a small team which included hostage negotiators from the Metropolitan Police . The West Side Boys would not allow negotiators any closer to the village of Magbeni than the end of the track from the main road , so Fordham met there with the self @-@ styled " Brigadier " Foday Kallay , the gang 's leader , to negotiate for the soldiers ' release . On 29 August , Fordham demanded proof that the captive soldiers were still alive , and Kallay brought with him to that day 's meeting the two officers from the group — Marshall , the company commander , and Captain Flaherty , the regimental signals officer . During the meeting , Flaherty shook hands with Fordham and covertly passed him a sketch map of Gberi Bana which detailed the layout of the village and the building in which the soldiers were being held . 
 Two days later , on 31 August , five of the eleven hostages were released in exchange for a satellite telephone and medical supplies . The West Side Boys had originally decided to release the married men , but changed their minds at the last minute and released the three rangers and two of the corporals . The West Side Boys told the British negotiators that the officers and other NCOs would not be released until the gang 's remaining demands were met . The released soldiers were flown for debriefing to RFA Sir Percivale , of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary , off the coast . 
 After the release of the soldiers , the West Side Boys ' spokesman , the self @-@ styled " Colonel Cambodia " , used the satellite telephone to contact the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) for a lengthy interview in which they outlined a series of demands , including a re @-@ negotiation of the Lomé Peace Accord and the release of prisoners held by the Sierra Leone authorities . " Colonel Cambodia " quickly depleted the batteries in the telephone , but his call to the BBC enabled specialists from the Royal Corps of Signals to determine the exact position of the telephone . 
 = = Deterioration = = 
 The West Side Boys were unstable , possibly due to prolonged use of cannabis and cocaine , and their behaviour during the crisis was erratic . After their release , the five soldiers described an incident in which Kallay , dissatisfied with their explanation , conducted a mock execution in which he threatened to shoot the soldiers unless they told him why they had entered the West Side Boys ' territory . The gang 's drug habits also posed a problem for the British negotiators as the cannabis caused them to forget previous discussions and the cocaine made them distrustful . 
 During the negotiations , the relatives of several of the West Side Boys were brought to the gang 's camp to ask them to release the British soldiers . The gang responded that they had nothing against the soldiers , but that holding them had brought attention to their demands — which now included immunity from prosecution , safe passage to the UK to take up university courses , and guaranteed acceptance to the re @-@ formed Sierra Leone Army . 
 = = = Military planning = = = 
 Around the time that the five soldiers were released , two negotiators from the SAS joined Fordham 's negotiating team . One of them joined Fordham in several meetings with the West Side Boys , posing as a Royal Irish major in order to provide reconnaissance and gather intelligence in case an assault was required . At approximately the same time Lieutenant Jon Carty , RN , the medical officer on board HMS Argyll — which was operating off the coast — was brought ashore to assess the soldiers , should they be freed , or to provide immediate care in the event of an assault resulting in casualties . Argyll also served as a temporary base for two Army Air Corps Lynx attack helicopters which had been flown to Sierra Leone to support any direct action . 
 As planning for a potential military operation to release the captive soldiers progressed , it became clear that , given the number of West Side Boys and their separation between two locations ( Gberi Bana as well as the village of Magbeni ; see below ) , the operation could not be conducted by special forces alone . Thus , the headquarters of 1st Battalion , 1 PARA , was ordered to assemble an enhanced company group , which would support special forces if such an operation was launched . The battalion 's commanding officer selected A Company , led by Major Matthew Lowe , which had been on exercise in Jamaica at the time of the initial British deployment to Sierra Leone . Several members of A Company were new recruits who had only completed basic training two weeks prior . Lowe decided that replacing them with more experienced soldiers would risk undermining the cohesion and morale of the company , but several specialist units from elsewhere in 1 PARA were attached to A Company to bring the company group up to the required strength , including a signals group , snipers , heavy machine gun sections , and a mortar section . The additional firepower was included to maximise the options available to the planners , given that the West Side Boys had a numerical advantage and that additional resources would not be immediately available should the operation run into difficulties . 
 On 31 August , the company group was ordered to move to South Cerney in Gloucestershire , under the cover story that they were conducting a " readiness to move " exercise . It was only at this point , and after all mobile telephones had been confiscated to ensure operational security , that the entire company was briefed on the operation that was being planned . With the operation becoming more likely to be launched , Lowe and his planning group flew to Dakar , Senegal , on 3 September to continue planning and to study intelligence gathered from SAS patrols operating near the West Side Boys ' camp . The British government feared that deployment of forces to Sierra Leone might precipitate an adverse reaction by the West Side Boys against the captive soldiers . They calculated that it would take 14 hours to launch an assault from the United Kingdom should it be required in an emergency , so the remainder of the company group was also moved to Dakar in order to reduce the response time . In order to further reduce the response time , political authority to launch the assault in an emergency was delegated to the British High Commissioner in Freetown , Alan Jones , while the military decision was delegated to Brigadier David Richards , commander of British forces in Sierra Leone . Two days later , a pair of SAS observation teams ( one on each side of Rokel Creek ) were inserted near the villages by assault boats manned by the Special Boat Service ( SBS ) — the Royal Navy 's special forces unit . They began monitoring the West Side Boys ' movements and gathering intelligence , such as details of weapons , as well as identifying viable landing sites for helicopters . 
 With the progression of the plans , the enhanced A Company was tasked with planning for an assault on the village of Magbeni , to the south of Rokel Creek , while the SAS would aim to release the captive Royal Irish soldiers by assaulting Gberi Bana , on the north bank . The Magbeni assault had several purposes : to neutralise weapons in the village which could disrupt the SAS operation , to distract the West Side Boys in Magbeni and prevent them from crossing Rokel Creek to interfere with the operation in Gberi Bana , to defeat the West Side Boys and destroy their military capabilities , and to recover the Royal Irish patrol 's vehicles . 
 Several methods of insertion were considered , both for the paras and the special forces personnel , including an overland approach using four @-@ wheel drive vehicles , and a water @-@ borne insertion using the same method by which the SAS observation teams had arrived at their position . The planning group decided that the overland approach would not allow troops to enter the village undetected , largely due to the West Side Boys ' roadblocks on the road into the village , and that insertion from Rokel Creek was not feasible for large numbers of troops due to the sandbanks and powerful currents in the river . Thus , it was decided that the insertions would be made from three Chinook helicopters of the Joint Special Forces Aviation Wing ( <unk> ) , which had been in Sierra Leone since the beginning of Operation Palliser . 
 = = = Deployment to Sierra Leone = = = 
 By 5 September , the British media was openly speculating on the possibility that an operation would be launched to free the remaining soldiers , having picked up on 1 PARA 's heightened readiness . The following day , the media was reporting that British forces had arrived in Sierra Leone " as a contingency " . The British special forces kept a low profile , as was traditional , and the media interest surrounding 1 PARA allowed D Squadron , 22 SAS to enter Sierra Leone unnoticed . 
 The enhanced A Company group — approximately 130 troops in total — arrived in the country in several groups and joined the SAS , who had already established a base in Hastings , a village 30 miles ( 50 kilometres ) south of Freetown , where several of the paras recognised former colleagues among the troopers from D Squadron . At Hastings , the paras focused on live firing exercises and rehearsed various scenarios in a scale replica of Magbeni which had been constructed at the camp . As well as learning the layout of the village and refining battle technique , the rehearsals allowed the soldiers to acclimatise to the tropical heat , and led commanders to the decision that the paras would go into battle with minimal equipment to reduce the risk of heat exhaustion — excluding weapons and ammunition , they would carry only water and field dressings . Some officers feared that the weight of body armour would increase the risk of heat exhaustion , but commanders hoped that the cooler temperatures of the early morning ( when the operation was planned to be launched ) would mitigate the effects of the weight , and decided to order its use . 
 A day after the arrival of the paras , Director Special Forces ( DSF ) , Brigadier John Holmes , arrived in Freetown with a headquarters staff which included the commanding officer of 22 SAS and the officer commanding D Squadron , as well as three personnel from the Royal Air Force 's Tactical Communications Wing . Holmes based himself at Seaview House , the British military headquarters in Freetown , near the British High Commission . From there , his staff established contact with the SAS observation teams on either side of Rokel Creek and with COBRA , the British government 's emergency committee in London . The DSF , who usually attends COBRA meetings during crises which may require the use of special forces , was represented by his chief of staff and by Lieutenant Colonel Tim Collins , operations officer at Headquarters Special Forces .

 On 9 September , " Colonel Cambodia " stated that the remaining six members of the Royal Irish patrol , who had now been held for over a fortnight , would only be released after a new government was formed in Sierra Leone . The negotiators concluded that the West Side Boys ' increasingly unrealistic demands were stalling tactics rather than a serious attempt to conclude the crisis . At around the same time , the SAS teams near the West Side Boys ' base reported that they had seen no sign of the captive soldiers during the four days they had been in position . There were also concerns that the West Side Boys might move further inland , and either kill the soldiers or move them to a location from which it would be more difficult for British forces to extract them . The combination of these factors led COBRA to order an assault . 
 The operation was to commence at first light the next day , 10 September . The intervening time was spent securing the political and legal basis for the raid . Final approval was gained from Sierra Leonean President Ahmad Kabbah , and British Prime Minister Tony Blair , while the Army Legal Corps secured approval from the Sierra Leonean Police . Fordham , who had been leading the negotiations , telephoned the West Side Boys and was able to establish that the captive soldiers were alive , and the final orders were issued in the evening of 9 September . 
 The two villages were to be assaulted simultaneously — Gberi Bana , where the Royal Irish were held , by the SAS and Magbeni by the paras . In addition to the remaining Royal Irish soldiers , the SAS were also tasked with extracting Lieutenant Musa Bangura — the patrol 's SLA liaison , whose extraction was given the same priority as that of the Royal Irish — and a group of Sierra Leonean civilians who were being held by the West Side Boys . 
 = = = Assault = = = 
 The task force left Hastings — approximately 15 minutes ' flying time from the West Side Boys ' camp — at approximately 06 : 15 . Downstream from the villages — approximately 15 minutes ' flying time , just out of the West Side Boys ' visual and hearing range , the helicopters went into a holding pattern to allow the SAS observation teams time to get into position to prevent the West Side Boys from attacking any of the captives before the extraction teams were on the ground . Once the observation teams were in position , the helicopters proceeded up the line of Rokel Creek , the Chinooks flying low enough that the downdraft tore off the corrugated iron roofs of several huts in the villages , including the roof of the building in which the Royal Irish were being held . As the helicopters approached , the SAS observation team at Gberi Bana engaged West Side Boys in the vicinity of the captives to prevent any gang members from attempting to kill them before the area was secured . Upon their arrival , the attack helicopters strafed the villages to make the landing zones as safe as possible for the Chinooks and destroy the heavy weapons that had been identified by the SAS observation teams . 
 = = = = Gberi Bana = = = = 
 After the first sweep by the attack helicopters , two Chinooks carried the SAS to Gberi Bana . The troopers fast @-@ roped into the village and immediately came under fire from the West Side Boys . Early on in the confrontation , the British operation sustained its first casualty — a round entered Trooper Bradley Tinnion 's flank , leaving him seriously injured . He was dragged back to the helicopter and flown to the medical team aboard RFA Sir Percivale , dying despite intensive resuscitation attempts on board . The SAS proceeded to clear the village , engaging those West Side Boys who offered resistance and capturing those who surrendered , including Foday Kallay . 
 The SAS located the captive British soldiers from the latter 's shouts of " British Army , British Army ! " , though Bangura had been held separately and proved more difficult to locate . He was found in a squalid open pit , which had been used by the West Side Boys as a lavatory , and had been starved and beaten during his captivity , and thus had to be carried to the helicopter . Less than 20 minutes after the arrival of the SAS , the remaining members of the Royal Irish patrol , including Bangura , had been evacuated from the area . 
 As the SAS operation concluded , the Chinooks ferried prisoners and bodies from Gberi Bana to the Jordanian battalion of UNAMSIL . From there , the bodies would be identified and buried , and those prisoners identified as West Side Boys would be handed over to the Sierra Leonean Police . Operation Barras also freed 22 Sierra Leonean civilians who had been held captive by the West Side Boys — the men were used as servants and put through crude military training by the West Side Boys , possibly with the intention of forcing them to fight in the future , while the women were used as sex slaves . Planners had been concerned that West Side Boys might try to conceal themselves among the civilians and so the civilians were also restrained and taken to the Jordanian peacekeepers ' base to be identified . A 23rd civilian was caught in the crossfire and killed during the assault . 
 = = = = Magbeni = = = = 
 The third Chinook carried half of the enhanced A Company group from 1 PARA to Magbeni . The helicopter hovered low above the landing zone that had been identified by the second SAS observation team and the paras jumped from the rear ramp . The observation team had warned that the ground was wet but had been unable to determine the depth of the water , so the paras were surprised to find themselves jumping into a chest @-@ deep swamp . The majority of the first group immediately waded through the swamp to get to the nearby tree line and from there to the village , but a small party tasked with securing the landing zone had to wait in the swamp for the Chinook to pick up the remaining members of the company group and return to insert them at the landing zone . 
 The returning Chinook , carrying the remainder of the A Company group including second @-@ in @-@ command ( 2IC ) Captain Danny Matthews , came under fire from a heavy machine gun in Magbeni , which was promptly strafed by one of the Army Air Corps Lynx helicopters until it ceased firing . The soldiers in Matthews ' helicopter exited and joined the first half of the company group on the ground . As the company group moved forward , an explosion — possibly a mortar fired by the British fire support group — injured seven men , including company commander Major Matthew Lowe , one of the platoon commanders , a signaller , and two of Lowe 's headquarters staff . Another signaller radioed in a casualty report , and one of the Chinooks en route to Gberi Bana to extract the Royal Irish ( who had just been freed by the SAS ) landed on the track through the village . The casualties were loaded onto the helicopter , which then picked up the Royal Irish and flew to RFA Sir Percivale where all 13 men were assessed by medics . 
 The operation continued under the leadership of Matthews , the company 2IC , who had taken command almost immediately after the company commander was wounded . Under his command , each of the platoons assaulted a different cluster of buildings to which they had been assigned during training on the replica village at Hastings . The West Side Boys ' ammunition store was found and secured and , once the rest of the buildings had been cleared , the paras took up defensive positions to block any potential counter @-@ attack and patrols went into the immediate jungle in search of any West Side Boys hiding in the bushes . The village was completely secure by 08 : 00 and the paras secured the approaches with Claymore mines and mortars positioned to prevent a counter @-@ attack , while a detachment destroyed the remaining vehicles and heavy weapons including the Bedford lorry which had blocked the Royal Irish patrol . The paras also recovered the Royal Irish patrol 's Land Rovers , which were slung under the Chinooks and removed . The last British soldiers left the area at approximately 14 : 00 . 
 = = = = Conclusion of the assault = = = = 
 The remaining members of the captured patrol were flown to RFA Sir Percivale . Fordham visited the men shortly after the operation and stated " they looked remarkably well considering the ordeal they had been through " and described them as being " physically and mentally exhausted " . After medical checks , the soldiers , who had been held for 17 days , were allowed to telephone their families and then rejoined their battalion in Freetown . The paras were flown to RFA Argus , where they spent the night before being flown back to the United Kingdom the next day . D Squadron , 22 SAS also left Sierra Leone the day after the operation , along with Director Special Forces and his headquarters staff . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 One British soldier , Tinnion , was killed in the operation . Another twelve soldiers were injured , one seriously . The British Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) did not officially acknowledge the involvement of special forces , issuing a press release which made no mention of the SAS , but when it was made public that Brad Tinnion was a Lance Bombardier originally from 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery , it became clear to experts that Tinnion had been serving with special forces . Operation Barras was Tinnion 's first operational deployment as an SAS trooper . 
 Also confirmed to have died in the operation were 25 West Side Boys , but the gang 's resistance was stronger than had been expected and there was speculation that more bodies lay undiscovered in the jungle . Several other West Side Boys were captured , while others fled into the jungle . Many of those who fled later surrendered to Jordanian peacekeepers . The Jordanians had received 30 by the end of the day , and 371 — including 57 children — had surrendered within a fortnight of Operation Barras , to which Julius Spencer , Sierra Leone 's Minister for Information , declared that the West Side boys were " finished as a military threat " . Some of those who surrendered went on to volunteer for the new Sierra Leone Army and those who were accepted went into the British @-@ run training programme . Kallay , the gang 's leader , recorded a message for broadcast on Sierra Leonean radio urging the remaining West Side Boys to surrender to UNAMSIL . He also identified the bodies of West Side Boys killed in Magbeni and Gberi Bana , which were subsequently buried in a mass grave . 
 The morning of the operation , General Sir Charles Guthrie , Chief of the Defence Staff ( CDS ) — the professional head of the British Armed Forces — was coincidentally due to appear on Breakfast with Frost , a Sunday morning political television programme hosted by Sir David Frost . The first public knowledge of Operation Barras came from Guthrie 's interview with Frost , which took place while the operation was still concluding . Guthrie told Frost " [ W ] e didn 't want to have to assault , because it 's a very difficult operation , there are big risks in it but we have done it [ ... ] because our negotiations were getting nowhere . The hostages had been there for three weeks , they [ the West Side Boys ] were threatening to kill them , or they were threatening to move them to other parts of Sierra Leone and once they 'd done that we 'd never be able to recover [ the soldiers ] with ease , which I hope we 've done this morning " . The MoD issued a press release with more details later in the day . 
 Several decorations were awarded to the personnel who took part in Operation Barras , including two Conspicuous Gallantry Crosses , five Military Crosses ( one of which was awarded to Matthews , who took command of the operation in Magbeni after the officer commanding was injured ) , and five Distinguished Flying Crosses . Holmes ( Director Special Forces ) was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his part in the operation . Tinnion received a posthumous Mention in Despatches . 
 Marshall was later transferred to another regiment at his own request , while two of the soldiers on the patrol subsequently left the army and another two transferred to " Home Service " units ( those based permanently in Northern Ireland ) . 
 = = Long @-@ term impact = = 
 The capture of the Royal Irish patrol had undermined the confidence of the Sierra Leonean population in the British operation , which they hoped would help to bring an end to the country 's civil war , and embarrassed the British government , which had been critical of similar previous incidents involving UNAMSIL personnel . Operation Barras restored confidence in the British forces , prompting military historian William Fowler to call the operation " a necessarily spectacular endorsement of the rule of law and the elected government of Sierra Leone " . 
 The British media struck a celebratory note at the success of Operation Barras , but some suggested that Marshall had erred in diverting the patrol off the main road to visit the West Side Boys . Both Marshall and Bangura — the patrol 's Sierra Leone Army liaison — were adamant that the patrol had been asked by the Jordanian peacekeepers serving with UNAMSIL to , in Bangura 's words , " take a closer look " . However , the commander of UNAMSIL — General Mohamed Garba of Nigeria — initially denied that the Royal Irish had met the Jordanians and both UNAMSIL HQ and the Jordanian commanding officer denied that the patrol were asked to investigate the West Side Boys ' camp . An investigation into the capture of the patrol was launched by Land Command and a senior officer was despatched to Freetown to debrief the members of the patrol . The report was critical of Marshall , stating that he " made an error of professional judgement in diverting from a planned and authorised journey to make an unauthorised visit to the village of Magbeni . " 
 The risks of Operation Barras were acknowledged by the MoD and by officers involved in the planning and the assault . It was described by an SAS soldier as " not a clinical , black balaclava , Princes Gate type operation . It was a very grubby , green operation with lots of potential for things to go wrong " . Richard Connaughton observed in the journal Small Wars & <unk> that the operation showed that Tony Blair 's government was not averse to the possibility of casualties where they felt the cause was just . Geoff Hoon , British Secretary of State for Defence , summed up the effect of the operation at a press conference , stating that " [ Operation Barras ] sends a number of powerful messages . Firstly , it is a yet further demonstration of the refusal of successive British governments to do deals with terrorists and hostage takers . Secondly , we hope the West Side Group [ sic ] and other rebel units in Sierra Leone will now [ ... ] accept the rule of law and the authority of the democratically elected government of Sierra Leone . Thirdly , we hope all those who may in future consider taking similar actions against UK armed forces will think carefully about the possible consequences and realise there is nothing to be gained by such action " . Andrew M. Dorman of King 's College London suggested that the fate of the wider British operation in Sierra Leone depended heavily on the success or failure of Operation Barras and that , had the British forces been defeated , the United Kingdom would have been forced to withdraw all its forces from Sierra Leone . Dorman also suggests that a defeat would have " raised questions " regarding Tony Blair 's policy of using armed force for humanitarian intervention . 
 The success of Operation Barras was a factor in the decision to form the Special Forces Support Group ( SFSG ) , a permanent unit whose role is to act as a force multiplier for British special forces on large or complex operations . The SFSG was formed in 2006 from an infantry battalion — originally 1 PARA , which was the first battalion to serve in the role — with supporting elements from the Royal Marines and Royal Air Force Regiment . The SFSG went on to support special forces operations in Afghanistan and Iraq . 
 The capture of the Royal Irish patrol and the effectiveness of the operation to free them prompted the British government to increase its support of UNAMSIL , both politically and through the provision of staff officers to assist UNAMSIL 's operational headquarters ( though not with a significant contribution of peacekeepers , despite considerable lobbying ) . The British also applied political pressure through the United Nations Security Council on the Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) — the second main party to the civil war after the government — and on Sierra Leone 's neighbour Liberia , which had provided support to the RUF . The new approach , combined with a larger and more powerful UNAMSIL , hastened the demobilisation of the RUF and thus the end of the Sierra Leone Civil War . 
 = History of decompression research and development = 
 Decompression in the context of diving derives from the reduction in ambient pressure experienced by the diver during the ascent at the end of a dive or hyperbaric exposure and refers to both the reduction in pressure and the process of allowing dissolved inert gases to be eliminated from the tissues during this reduction in pressure . 
 When a diver descends in the water column the ambient pressure rises . Breathing gas is supplied at the same pressure as the surrounding water , and some of this gas dissolves into the diver 's blood and other tissues . Inert gas continues to be taken up until the gas dissolved in the diver is in a state of equilibrium with the breathing gas in the diver 's lungs , ( see : " Saturation diving " ) , or the diver moves up in the water column and reduces the ambient pressure of the breathing gas until the inert gases dissolved in the tissues are at a higher concentration than the equilibrium state , and start diffusing out again . Dissolved inert gases such as nitrogen or helium can form bubbles in the blood and tissues of the diver if the partial pressures of the dissolved gases in the diver gets too high when compared to the ambient pressure . These bubbles , and products of injury caused by the bubbles , can cause damage to tissues known as decompression sickness or the bends . The immediate goal of controlled decompression is to avoid development of symptoms of bubble formation in the tissues of the diver , and the long @-@ term goal is to also avoid complications due to sub @-@ clinical decompression injury . 
 The symptoms of decompression sickness are known to be caused by damage resulting from the formation and growth of bubbles of inert gas within the tissues and by blockage of arterial blood supply to tissues by gas bubbles and other emboli consequential to bubble formation and tissue damage . The precise mechanisms of bubble formation and the damage they cause has been the subject of medical research for a considerable time and several hypotheses have been advanced and tested . Tables and algorithms for predicting the outcome of decompression schedules for specified hyperbaric exposures have been proposed , tested , and used , and usually found to be of some use but not entirely reliable . Decompression remains a procedure with some risk , but this has been reduced and is generally considered to be acceptable for dives within the well @-@ tested range of commercial , military and recreational diving . 
 The first recorded experimental work related to decompression was conducted by Robert Boyle , who subjected experimental animals to reduced ambient pressure by use of a primitive vacuum pump . In the earliest experiments the subjects died from asphyxiation , but in later experiments , signs of what was later to become known as decompression sickness were observed . Later , when technological advances allowed the use of pressurisation of mines and caissons to exclude water ingress , miners were observed to present symptoms of what would become known as caisson disease , the bends , and decompression sickness . Once it was recognized that the symptoms were caused by gas bubbles , and that recompression could relieve the symptoms , further work showed that it was possible to avoid symptoms by slow decompression , and subsequently various theoretical models have been derived to predict low @-@ risk decompression profiles and treatment of decompression sickness .

 = = Haldanean ( perfusion limited , dissolved phase ) models = = 
 Early decompression theory generally assumed that inert gas bubble formation in the tissues could be avoided during decompression , and the aim of the decompression tables and algorithms was to prevent bubble formation while minimising decompression time . Most dissolved phase models are perfusion limited , and differ mainly by the number of compartments , the range of half @-@ times , and supersaturation tolerances assumed . These models are commonly referred to as Haldanean . 
 = = = Haldane 's theory and tables = = = 
 John Scott Haldane was commissioned by the Royal Navy to develop a safe decompression procedure . The current method was a slow linear decompression , and Haldane was concerned that this was ineffective due to additional nitrogen buildup in the slow early stages of the ascent . 
 Haldane 's hypothesis was that a diver could ascend immediately to a depth where the supersaturation reaches but does not exceed the critical supersaturation level , at which depth the pressure gradient for off @-@ gassing is maximized and the decompression is most efficient . The diver would remain at this depth until saturation had reduced sufficiently for him to ascend another 10 feet , to the new depth of critical supersaturation , where the process would be repeated until it was safe for the diver to reach the surface . Haldane assumed a constant critical ratio of dissolved nitrogen pressure to ambient pressure which was invariant with depth . 
 A large number of decompression experiments were done using goats , which were compressed for three hours to assumed saturation , rapidly decompressed to surface pressure , and examined for symptoms of decompression sickness . Goats which had been compressed to 2 @.@ 25 bar absolute or less showed no signs of DCS after rapid decompression to the surface . Goats compressed to 6 bar and rapidly decompressed to 2 @.@ 6 bar ( pressure ratio 2 @.@ 3 to 1 ) also showed no signs of DCS . Haldane and his co @-@ workers concluded that a decompression from saturation with a pressure ratio of 2 to 1 was unlikely to produce symptoms . 
 = = = = Haldane 's model = = = = 
 The decompression model formulated from these findings made the following assumptions . 
 Living tissues become saturated at different rates in different parts of the body . Saturation time varies from a few minutes to several hours 
 The rate of saturation follows a logarithmic curve and is approximately complete in 3 hours in goats , and 5 hours in humans . 
 The desaturation process follows the same pressure / time function as saturation ( symmetrical ) , provided no bubbles have formed 
 The slow tissues are most important in avoiding bubble formation 
 A pressure ratio of 2 to 1 during decompression will not produce decompression symptoms 
 A supersaturation of dissolved Nitrogen that exceeds twice ambient atmospheric pressure is unsafe 
 Efficient decompression from high pressures should start by rapidly halving the absolute pressure , followed by a slower ascent to ensure that the partial pressure in the tissues does not at any stage exceed about twice the ambient pressure . 
 The different tissues were designated as tissue groups with different half @-@ times , and saturation was assumed after four half @-@ times ( 93 @.@ 75 % ) 
 Five tissue compartments were chosen , with half @-@ times of 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 and 75 minutes . 
 Depth intervals of 10 ft were chosen for decompression stops . 
 = = = = Decompression tables = = = = 
 This model was used to compute a set of tables . The method comprises choosing a depth and time exposure , and calculation the nitrogen partial pressure in each of the tissue compartments at the end of that exposure . 
 The depth of the first stop is found from the tissue compartment with the highest partial pressure , and the depth of first decompression stop is the standard stop depth where this partial pressure is nearest without exceeding the critical pressure ratio . 
 The time at each stop is the time required to reduce partial pressure in all compartments to a level safe for the next stop , 10 ft shallower . 
 The controlling compartment for the first stop is usually the fastest tissue , but this generally changes during the ascent , and slower tissues usually control the shallower stop times . The longer the bottom time and closer to saturation of the slower tissues , the slower the tissue controlling the final stops will be . 
 Chamber tests and open water dives with two divers were made in 1906 . The divers were successfully decompressed from each exposure . The tables were adopted by the Royal Navy in 1908 . The Haldane tables of 1906 are considered to be the first true set of decompression tables , and the basic concept of parallel tissue compartments with half @-@ times and critical supersaturation limits are still in use in several later decompression models , algorithms , tables and decompression computers . 
 = = = U.S. Navy decompression tables = = = 
 US Navy decompression tables have gone through a lot of development over the years . They have mostly been based on parallel multi @-@ compartment exponential models . The number of compartments has varied , and the allowable supersaturation in the various compartments during ascent has undergone major development based on experimental work and records of decompression sickness incidents .

 The first decompression tables produced for the U.S. Navy were developed by the Bureau of Construction and Repair in 1915 and were consequently known as the C & R tables . They were derived from a Haldanean model , with oxygen decompression to depths up to 300 ft on air , and were successfully used to depths of slightly over 300 ft 
 = = = = Hawkins Schilling and Hansen ( 1930s ) = = = = 
 Submarine escape training led US Navy personnel to believe that Haldane 's allowable supersaturation ratios for fast tissues were unnecessarily conservative , as calculated values indicated that supersaturation in trainees exceeded Haldane 's limits , but they did not develop DCS . A large number ( <unk> ) of experimental dives were conducted over 3 years to derive allowable supersaturation ratios for a Haldanian 5 compartment model with compartment half @-@ times of 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 and 70 minutes . Values for critical supersaturation derived from this experimental work were different for each tissue compartment . Values for slow tissues ( 75 and 40 @-@ minute ) were close to Haldane 's findings , but considerably higher values were found for the fast tissues . These values were so high that the researchers concluded that the 5- and 10 @-@ minute tissues were not relevant to the development of DCS . Based on these conclusions , a set of tables was computed which omitted the 5- and 10 @-@ minute tissues . 
 = = = = Yarbrough ( 1937 tables ) = = = = 
 Yarbrough 's 1937 tables were based on a Haldanean 3 compartment model with compartment half @-@ times of 20 , 40 and 70 minutes . Ascent rate was chosen to be 25 ft per minute , which was a convenient rate to pull up a diver in standard dress . 
 = = = = 1956 tables = = = = 
 Van der Aue worked on procedures for surface decompression and oxygen use in the early 1950s and during his research found problems with the 1937 tables for long dive times . He also found that the fast tissues which had been dropped in the 1930s would control decompression in some cases , so he re @-@ introduced the fast compartments to the model , and added an extra slower compartment to better model long @-@ duration dives . 
 Assumptions of the 1956 model : 
 Six parallel tissue compartments with exponential uptake and elimination of gas with compartment half @-@ times of 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 , 80 and 120 minutes . 
 Symmetrical uptake and elimination half @-@ times ( same half @-@ time for each compartment for uptake and elimination ) 
 Supersaturation ratios decrease linearly with increased ambient pressure , ( M @-@ values ) and are different for each compartment . 
 Each tissue compartment is assumed to fully saturate / desaturate in 6 half @-@ times . This means desaturation of the slowest ( 120 min ) compartment takes 12 hours – hence the 12 @-@ hour surface interval before a dive is not considered repetitive with these tables . 
 Ascent rate was chosen at 60 fsw / min as a compromise between the practical requirements for military scuba and surface supplied diving operations . 
 Repetitive diving was accommodated in the tables using the slowest compartment to control surface off @-@ gassing . 
 A minimum surface interval of 10 minutes was found necessary to ensure that the 120 @-@ minute compartment would have controlling effect for repetitive dives . 
 = = = = U.S. Navy exceptional exposure tables = = = = 
 The U.S. Navy 1956 tables were soon found to be problematic for dives deeper than 100 fsw for longer than 2 to 4 hours . 
 US Navy exceptional exposure tables use an 8 compartment Haldanean model developed by Workman , with half @-@ times of 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 , 80 , 120 , 160 and 240 minutes , and are not compatible with the rest of the US Navy Air tables for repetitive diving , although for convenience they have been appended to the standard US Navy Air tables . The tables warn that no repetitive diving is permitted following an exceptional exposure dive , and although the 240 @-@ minute tissue would only desaturate completely in 24 hours , there is no restriction to assuming an unsaturated diver after 12 hours .

 Some of the earliest modifications to the U.S. Navy tables involved changes to their layout by the recreational diving community . These include :

 Decompression theory is not an exact science . Decompression models approximate a physiological process that is incompletely understood , and rather complex , by simple mathematical models , in the hope of producing a useful procedure with acceptably low risk of injury to the user . New information allows theories and models to be modified to provide more reliable results , and the availability of faster and more powerful computer processors at low cost has made more exhaustive numerical methods more practicable , and the computation of relatively far more complex models is now quite possible , even in real time . 
 Several factors have encouraged researchers to modify existing tables and develop new models : 
 Doppler bubble detection allows models to use bubble formation as an endpoint rather than symptomatic DCS . 
 The use of safety stops has been shown by Dr Andrew <unk> of the Catalina Marine Science Centre to greatly reduce bubble formation in divers . 
 Many decompression models use a slower ascent rate than the 60 fpm ( 18 m / min ) of the 1956 US Navy tables ( The 2008 US Navy tables have reduced ascent rate to 30 fpm ( 9 m / min ) ) . 
 Multiple repetitive dives . The US Navy tables were designed for a single repetitive dive , and there were concerns about the safety of extending their use to multiple repetitive dives . As an attempt to address this issue , some tables were modified to reduce the allowable bottom time for repetitive dives . 
 Longer nitrogen retention . The addition of longer half @-@ time compartments allows the accumulation of residual nitrogen over longer periods to be accounted for . 
 = = = = Jeppesen tables = = = = 
 Jeppesen made the simplest modification to the U.S. Navy tables by drawing a new line to reduce no @-@ stop limits on an otherwise unchanged table . Divers were recommended to remain within the modified no @-@ stop limit . If one of the new time limits was not listed on the U.S. Navy table , the next shorter table entry was to be selected . 
 = = = = Bassett tables = = = = 
 These tables were based on the 1956 US Navy tables and the no @-@ decompression limits recommended by Bruce Bassett . 
 Changes were also made to the table rules and decompression requirements : 
 Ascent rate of 10 m per minute . 
 A safety stop of 3 to 5 minutes at 3 to 5 metres is recommended where possible for all dives deeper than 9 m . 
 Total dive time is used to calculate repetitive group . 
 = = = = NAUI tables = = = = 
 The first NAUI tables were based on reformatted but otherwise unmodified US Navy 1956 tables and issued in the early 1980s . 
 The next version was a NAUI modification of the US Navy 1956 tables using the following modifications , and released a few years later . 
 No decompression limits have been reduced . In most cases this results in the repetitive group shifting one letter down , but for <unk> it shifted 2 letters , and for 40 fsw , by three letters . 
 A precautionary decompression stop ( safety stop ) of 3 minutes at 15 fsw is recommended after all dives , but the time spent at the safety stop is not included in the time used to calculate repetitive group . 
 A surface interval of at least one hour between repetitive dives is recommended . 
 Repetitive dive depths are limited to 100 fsw 
 A repetitive dive is defined as occurring within 24 hours of the previous dive ( this allows for the slowest tissues to <unk> with atmospheric partial pressures ) 
 All required decompression is done at a stop depth of 15 fsw 
 NAUI adapted the 1995 DCIEM Sports Table for use in all NAUI courses and these were used until they were replaced by RGBM based tables in 2002 . ( The NAUI recreational air tables based on RGBM model are copyrighted 2001 ) 
 NAUI RGBM Trimix and Nitrox tables copyrighted 1999 have also been released . 
 = = = = Pandora tables = = = = 
 These tables were designed for use on the excavation of the wreck of the Pandora 
 Table values at 30 fsw ( feet of seawater ) and deeper were shortened by 1 to 4 minutes , putting divers into higher repetitive groups sooner . 
 Repetitive group selection tables for repetitive dives were modified . The first repetitive dive uses the same repetitive group selection as the U.S. Navy tables but subsequent dives use more conservative tables which place the diver in a higher repetitive group than the Navy tables would for the same profile . This tendency is continued for the third and fourth repetitive dives . 
 Safety stops at 3 msw ( metres of seawater ) ( 10 fsw ) are required for repetitive dives ; 3 minutes is required after the second dive , 6 minutes after the third and 9 minutes after the fourth dive . 
 Maximum ascent rate was specified as 10 msw / min . ( 35 fsw / min . ) . 
 = = = = Huggins model and tables = = = = 
 In 1981 Karl Huggins modified the US Navy 6 compartment model using M values derived to follow the Spencer no @-@ decompression limits . The tables are exclusively for no @-@ decompression diving and are presented in the same format as the US Navy tables . 
 A major difference from the US Navy tables is that the repetitive group designators represent nitrogen levels in all tissues , unlike the USN table which represent only the 120 @-@ minute compartment . The Huggins repetitive group indicates a percentage of the M0 for the most saturated tissue , and this is intended to make the tables more applicable to multilevel diving procedures . 
 The Huggins tables have not been officially tested , but are more conservative than the 1956 US Navy tables . They have been calculated from limits which would theoretically produce venous bubbles 10 to 20 % of the time . 
 = = = = PADI Recreational Dive Planner = = = = 
 The PADI tables known as the PADI Recreational Dive Planner ( RDP ) were developed by Raymond Rogers and tested by <unk> ( Diving Science And Technology , an affiliate of PADI Inc . ) . The M values were derived from Spencer 's no @-@ stop limits and the repetitive group designators were based on a 60 @-@ minute tissue compartment . This combination resulted in more conservative first dives , but less conservative repetitive dives . 
 The RDP tables were developed for no @-@ stop diving , but recommend a safety stop at 15 fsw for 3 minutes . Emergency decompression for dives which inadvertently exceed the no @-@ stop limit is specified . 
 The RDP tables are available in two formats : 
 A regular table 
 " The Wheel " , Which is a circular slide @-@ rule type calculator , and allows depths to be read to 5 fsw intervals , and times to the nearest minute . 
 The RDP was tested for single day multi @-@ level dives and multi @-@ day dives with multiple dives per day . There were no incidences of symptomatic DCS during testing . 
 = = = Bühlmann tables = = = 
 Professor A.A. Bühlmann of the Laboratory of Hyperbaric medicine of the Medical Clinic of the University of Zurich developed the Swiss tables , more often referred to as Bühlmann tables , in the early 1960s . The model is Haldanian , with 16 tissue compartments with half @-@ times from 2 @.@ 65 minutes to 635 minutes , each with linearly varying supersaturation limits depending on the tissue and the ambient pressure , and is based on absolute pressures , which simplifies application to altitude diving . 
 The full set of Swiss Tables consists of tables for four altitude ranges : 0 to 700 m , 701 to 1500 m , 1501 to 2500 m and 2501 to 3500 m . Ascent rate was chosen as 10 m per minute . 
 No stop limits and decompression schedules tend to be more conservative than the US Navy air tables . 
 The Swiss tables use the 80 minute tissue compartment for control of repetitive dive calculations , which tends to be less conservative than the US Navy tables for this application .

 In 1986 the Bühlmann model was used to generate dive tables for recreational divers . One set was for altitudes from 0 to <unk> above sea level ( 0 to 2300 ft . ) and other for altitudes from 701 to 2 @,@ 500 m ( 2 @,@ 300 to 8 @,@ 202 ft ) . The repetitive group designators are based on the 80 @-@ minute compartment .

 The German tables were developed by Dr. Max Hahn using a derivative of the Bühlmann <unk> @-@ <unk> model using half @-@ times ranging from 2 @.@ 65 to 635 minutes . Three sets were published for altitude ranges 0 – 200 m , 201 – 700 m , and 701 @-@ 1 @,@ 200 m . The repetitive group designators are based on the 80 @-@ minute compartment . 
 Safety factors were added to the depths in the table to take into account depth gauge errors . The depths used for calculations were 2 @.@ 4 % greater than the depths listed in the two lower altitude tables , and 3 % + 1 msw greater than the depths listed in the highest altitude table . 
 = = = French Navy – Marine Nationale 90 ( MN90 ) decompression tables = = = 
 The mathematical model used for the development of the MN 90 tables is Haldanian , and was also used for the GERS ( Groupe d 'Etudes et Recherches Sous @-@ marines ) 1965 table . 
 Haldane 's assumptions about the limiting factors for ascent are : 
 gas exchange in decompression is symmetrical with compression 
 the role of bubbles in the modification of blood @-@ tissue exchange is neglected , 
 normal decompression does not produce bubbles : DCS occurs when bubbles appear , 
 bubbles appear in a compartment where the ratio of the dissolved gas pressure and ambient hydrostatic pressure reaches a critical value , characterizing the maximum tolerable pressure compartment . 
 Specific assumptions and conditions for use of the MN90 model and tables are as follows : 
 For Scuba dives using air as the breathing gas at sea level , with the diver initially saturated at atmospheric pressure 
 12 parallel tissue compartments with half @-@ times from 5 to 120 minutes , each with its own critical ratio 
 The ascent rate used is 15 to 17 metres per minute to the first stop , which is the same as used in the GERS 1965 tables . From the first stop to the surface this is reduced to 6 m / min 
 The reference population with respect to physiology is based on 1095 medically fit divers from the French Navy in 1988 : 
 weight 74 kg plus or minus 8 kg , 
 height 175 @.@ 9 plus or minus 5 @.@ 7 cm , 
 age 32 @.@ 3 plus or minus 6 @.@ 1 years . 
 Only the 120 @-@ minute tissue is used for calculation of residual nitrogen for repetitive dives . Letter groups are used to indicate the residual gas content of the 120 @-@ minute tissue . Letter groups are modified according to surface interval . A residual nitrogen time is found from the repetitive group and the repetitive dive depth which is to be added to the planned bottom time . 
 Decompression stops are at 3 m intervals 
 The tables have been validated by experimental dives and modified where necessary . 
 The maximum permitted depth for use of air is 60 m . The data for the decompression depths of 62 m and 65 m are included in the table in case of accidentally exceeding the depth limit of 60 m . 
 Only one repetitive dive is allowed as there is no validation data for multiple repetitive dives 
 Altitude corrections are available 
 The tables can be used for Nitrox by calculating equivalent air depth 
 Oxygen may be used to accelerate decompression in @-@ water at depths not exceeding 6 m 
 An unusual feature of these tables is a table for reduction of residual nitrogen by breathing pure oxygen on the surface between dives .

 In the early 1950s , Hempleman developed a diffusion limited model for gas transfer from the capillaries into the tissues ( Haldanian model is a perfusion model ) . The basis for this model is radial diffusion from a capillary into the surrounding tissue , but by assuming closely packed capillaries in a plane the model was developed into a " tissue slab " equivalent to one @-@ dimensional linear bulk diffusion in two directions into the tissues from a central surface . 
 The 1972 RNPL tables were based on a modified Hempleman tissue slab model and are more conservative than the US Navy tables . 
 A version of the RNPL tables was used by the British Sub @-@ Aqua Club ( BSAC ) until the production of the BSAC ' 88 tables in 1988 . 
 = = = DCIEM model and tables = = = 
 In the mid @-@ 1960s , the Canadian Defence and Civil Institute of Environmental Medicine developed the Kidd / Stubbs serial decompression model . This differs from Haldanian models which are parallel models and assume that all compartments are exposed to ambient partial pressures and no gas interchange occurs between compartments . A serial model assumes that the diffusion takes place through a series of compartments , and only one is exposed to the ambient partial pressures and is in effect a compartmentalised version of the <unk> bulk diffusion slab model . 
 The Kidd / Stubbs model has four serial compartments , each with a half time of approximately 21 minutes . Allowable surfacing supersaturation ratios for the initial two compartments are taken as 1 @.@ 92 and 1 @.@ 73 , while the gas concentration in the last two compartments is not considered in the computation . 
 DCIEM has continuously evaluated and modified the model over the years . A revised set of tables was released in 1984 , based on thousands of Doppler evaluated dives . The DCIEM 1983 decompression model is a decompression calculation model rather than a physiological model . Modifications were made to the model to get it to fit observed data , as the original model had several observed shortcomings , while retaining the basic model structure so that it could be applied to existing hardware with minimal modifications .

 LeMessurier and Hills published a paper in 1965 on A thermodynamic approach arising from a study on Torres Strait diving techniques which suggests that decompression by conventional models results in bubble formation which is then eliminated by re @-@ dissolving at the decompression stops , which is slower than elimination while still in solution , thus indicating the importance of minimising bubble phase for efficient gas elimination .

 In 1982 , the French government funded a research project for the evaluation of the MT74 tables using computer analysis of the dive report database , which indicated that the MT74 tables had limitations for severe exposures . The government then supported a second project to develop and validate new tables . A complete set of air tables , with options of pure oxygen breathing at 6 m ( surface supplied ) , at 12 m ( wet bell ) , surface decompression , split level diving , repetitive diving , etc. was developed in 1983 . This early model already implemented the concept of continuous compartment half @-@ times . For the safe ascent criteria , the Arterial Bubble model was not derived mathematically , but an approximation was defined empirically by fitting mathematical expressions to selected exposures from the Comex database . At the time , the best fit was obtained by the expression now called AB Model @-@ 1 , which was used to compute a set of decompression tables that was evaluated offshore on selected Comex <unk> . In 1986 , after some minor adjustments , the tables were included in the Comex diving manuals and used as standard procedures . In 1992 , the tables were included in the new French diving regulations under the name of Tables du Ministère du Travail 1992 or MT92 tables 
 = = = = The arterial bubble decompression model = = = = 
 The arterial bubble assumption is that the filtering capacity of the lung has a threshold radius of the size of a red blood cell and that sufficiently small decompression bubbles can pass to the arterial side , especially during the initial phase of ascent . Later in the ascent , bubbles grow to a larger size and remain trapped in the lung . This may explain why conventional Doppler measurements have not detected any bubbles in the arterial circulation . 
 The arterial bubble assumption can introduce variability in the decompression outcome through the lung function . The first variable is individual susceptibility . The filtering capacity of the lung may be assumed to vary between individuals , and for a given individual , from day to day , and may account for the inter @-@ personal and intra @-@ persona variability which have been observed in DCS susceptibility . Basically , a good diver is a good bubble filter . This is a justification for divers who seek top physical fitness for severe decompression exposures . 
 The second variable is related to dive conditions and speculates an influence of CO2 on the lung filter . Raised levels of CO2 could decrease the lungs ' filtration capacity and allow bubbles to pass to the arterial side of the circulation . Thus , diving situations associated with CO2 retention and hypercapnia would be associated with a higher risk of Type II DCS . This could explain why the following situations , which are all related to high levels of CO2 , have been identified as contributing factors to DCS : 
 anxiety and stress , 
 exhaustion or hyperventilation due to intense activity , 
 cold , 
 high work of <unk> . 
 The arterial bubble assumption is also consistent with the accidental production of arterial bubbles . One scenario considers a shunt at the heart or lung level that passes bubbles from the venous to the arterial side . A patent foramen ovale ( <unk> ) is thought to only open in certain conditions . A <unk> conveniently explains neurological accidents after recreational air diving without any procedure violation , but it does not explain vestibular hits in deep diving . <unk> symptoms can appear very early in the decompression , long before the massive bubble production required to overload the system . 
 A second scenario considers pressure increases during decompression that reduce bubble diameters . This can allow bubbles trapped in the lung during a normal decompression to suddenly pass through the capillaries and become responsible for Type II DCS symptoms . This could explain the difference in outcomes of in @-@ water decompression versus surface decompression . Data collected in the North Sea have shown that if the overall incidence rate of the two diving methods is about the same , that surface decompression tends to produce ten times more type II DCS than in @-@ water decompression . It is assumed that when the diver ascends to the surface , bubbles are produced that are trapped by the lung capillaries , and on recompression of the diver in the deck chamber , these bubbles are reduced in diameter and pass to the arterial side , later causing neurological symptoms . The same scenario was proposed for type II DCS recorded after sawtooth diving profiles or multiple repetitive dives . 
 The arterial bubble assumption also provides an explanation for the criticality of the initial ascent phase . Bubbles associated with symptoms are not necessarily generated on site . There is a growth process at the beginning of the ascent that may last for several cycles until the bubbles have reached a critical size when they are either filtered in the lung or stopped at the tissue level . It is postulated that the production of a shower of small arterial bubbles during the first minutes of the initial ascent is a precursor for DCS symptoms . 
 An attempt was made to turn this scenario into a decompression model . 
 The arterial bubble model assumptions 
 A Diver breathes a compressed gas mixture that contains inert gas which dissolves in the various tissues during the pressure exposure . When the ascent is initiated , the inert gas is off @-@ loaded as soon as a suitable gradient is created . 
 Bubbles are normally produced in the vascular bed and transported by the venous system to heart , then to the lungs . 
 The lungs work as a filter and trap the bubbles in the capillaries which have a smaller diameter . Gas transfer into the alveoli eliminates the bubbles . 
 The critical issue is the filtering capacity of the lung system . Small bubbles may pass through the lungs into the systemic circulation . 
 At the level of the aortic arch , the distribution of blood likely to carry bubbles to neurological tissue such as the brain or the spinal cord . 
 The brain is a fast tissue and might be in supersaturated state in the early phase of decompression . It acts as a gas reservoir and feeds any local bubble which will grow . The bubble may just proceed through the capillaries to the venous side for another cycle , but may be trapped and will then grow in place , causing local restriction of the blood supply and finally ischemia . This may develop into central neurological symptoms . 
 Similarly , arterial bubbles may reach the spinal cord and grow on site from local gas and produce spinal neurological symptoms . 
 Much later in the decompression , bubbles may reach a significant size and exert a local deformation , particularly in stiffer tissues such as tendons and ligaments , that excites nerve terminations and produces pain . 
 Derivation of the Arterial Bubble Model 
 A model based on the Arterial Bubble assumption ( Arterial Bubble model version 2 , or AB Model 2 ) was developed for the calculation of decompression tables . This gas phase model uses an equation which can be compared to a classic " M @-@ value " associated with a corrective factor that reduces the permitted gradient for small values of the compartment time constant . 
 The consequence is the introduction of deeper stops than a classic dissolved phase decompression model . 
 The rationalization of the arterial bubble assumption considers two situations : 
 In the initial phase of decompression , the critical event is assumed to be the arrival of an arterial bubble in a de @-@ saturating neurological tissue . The bubble exchanges gas with the surrounding tissue and the blood . If the bubble does not exceed a critical radius , it will eventually leave the site without growing , otherwise it will block the blood circulation and cause ischemia . The critical parameter is bubble radius . This criterion is used to prevent type II neurological symptoms . The strategy for a safe rate of ascent at this stage is to balance gas exchange . 
 In the later phase of decompression , the critical event is assumed to be the presence of a large bubble that has taken up a large quantity of dissolved gas from the adjacent tissue in a joint . If the bubble reaches a critical volume , it will have a mechanical effect on the nerve endings causing pain in a tendon . The bubble volume is the critical parameter . This criterion is used to prevent type I pain @-@ only symptoms . The strategy for a safe ascent at this stage is to prevent any gas phase from growing beyond a critical volume . 
 The critical volume concept was developed by Hennessy and Hempleman who formulated a simple mathematical condition linking the dissolved gas and the safe ascent pressure : 
 <unk> ≤ a × <unk> + b 
 Where <unk> represents the dissolved gas tension , <unk> , the ambient pressure and a and b two coefficients . This linear relationship between dissolved gas and ambient pressure has the same mathematical form as an M value , which suggests that all the Haldanean models using M @-@ values ( including the US Navy tables previous to those based on the E @-@ L model , the Bühlmann tables and all the French Navy tables ) , may be considered expressions of the critical volume criterion , though their authors may have argued for other interpretations . 
 = = = U.S. Navy E @-@ L algorithm and the 2008 tables = = = 
 The use of simple symmetrical exponential gas kinetics models has shown up the need for a model that would give slower tissue washout . In the early 1980s the US Navy Experimental Diving Unit developed an algorithm using a decompression model with exponential gas absorption as in the usual Haldanian model , but a slower linear release during ascent . The effect of adding linear kinetics to the exponential model is to lengthen the duration of risk accumulation for a given compartment time constant 
 The model was originally developed for programming decompression computers for constant oxygen partial pressure closed circuit rebreathers . Initial experimental diving using an exponential @-@ exponential algorithm resulted in an unacceptable incidence of DCS , so a change was made to a model using the linear release model , with a reduction in DCS incidence . The same principles were applied to developing an algorithm and tables for a constant oxygen partial pressure model for heliox diving 
 The linear component is active when the tissue pressure exceeds ambient pressure by a given amount specific to the tissue compartment . When the tissue pressure drops below this cross @-@ over criterion the tissue is modelled by exponential kinetics . During gas uptake , tissue pressure never exceeds ambient , so it is always modelled by exponential kinetics . This results in a model with the desired asymmetrical characteristics of slower washout than uptake . The linear / exponential transition is smooth . Choice of cross @-@ over pressure determines the slope of the linear region as equal to the slope of the exponential region at the cross @-@ over point . 
 During the development of these algorithms and tables , it was recognized that a successful algorithm could be used to replace the existing collection of incompatible tables for various air and Nitrox diving modes currently in the U.S. Navy Diving Manual with a set of mutually compatible decompression tables based on a single model , which was proposed by Gerth and Doolette in 2007 . This has been done in Revision 6 of the US Navy Diving Manual published in 2008 , though some changes were made . 
 An independent implementation of the EL @-@ Real Time Algorithm was developed by Cochran Consulting , Inc. for the diver @-@ carried Navy Dive Computer under the guidance of E. D. Thalmann . 
 = = = = Physiological interpretation = = = = 
 Computer testing of a theoretical bubble growth model reported by Ball , <unk> , Homer and Thalmann produced results which led to the interpretation of the three compartments used in the probabilistic LE model , with fast ( 1 @.@ 5 min ) , intermediate ( 51 min ) and slow ( 488 min ) time constants , of which only the intermediate compartment uses the linear kinetics modification during decompression , as possibly not representing distinct anatomically identifiable tissues , but three different kinetic processes which relate to different elements of DCS risk . 
 They conclude that bubble evolution may not be sufficient to explain all aspects of DCS risk , and the relationship between gas phase dynamics and tissue injury requires further investigation . 
 = = = BSAC ' 88 Tables = = = 
 The BSAC ' 88 Tables are published in the form of a booklet of four table sets giving no calculation repetitive diving solutions from sea level to 3000 metres altitude . 
 These tables were developed by Tom Hennessy to replace the RNPL / BSAC tables when the Club wanted a set of tables which could approach the versatility of a dive computer . 
 Very little information on the theoretical model and algorithm for the BSAC 1988 tables appears to be available . What is known , is that the tables were developed specifically for recreational diving for the British Sub @-@ Aqua Club by Dr Tom Hennessy and were released in 1988 . 
 Also in 1988 , a chapter titled Modelling Human Exposure to Altered Pressure Environments , by T.R. Hennessy was published in Environmental <unk> , discussing the shortcomings of several decompression models and the associated experimental validation procedures . In this work Hennessy proposes an alternative combined perfusion / diffusion model . The number of compartments discussed ranges from 4 in model " A " , ( perfusion limited aqueous tissue , perfusion limited lipid tissue , diffusion limited aqueous tissue and diffusion limited lipid tissue ) to 2 in model " B " ( where the assumption is made that if there is intravascular undissolved gas ( bubbles ) , the perfusion limited compartments would become diffusion limited ) . 
 Hennessy concludes that if the undissolved and dissolved gas content of a tissue cannot be independently measured either directly or indirectly then the safe maximum limits relative to the ambient pressure cannot be accurately determined through decompression trials and it will not be possible to systematically develop a comprehensive biophysical model for gas exchange . He proposes a best fit double compartment model for dissolved gas and a single compartment model for undissolved gas as these are the simplest models consistent with available data . 
 The parameters used in the design of these tables include : 
 Bubbles are assumed to form after every decompression . 
 These bubbles affect gas uptake and release on repetitive dives , resulting in a faster saturation on repetitive dives due to a combination of <unk> nitrogen from the bubbles , residual dissolved nitrogen , plus the nitrogen uptake due to the repeated exposure . 
 Bubbles do not <unk> immediately on recompression , and rates of gas uptake will alter from initial dive to repetitive dives , so repetitive dives must be handled differently in the mathematical model to predict safe decompression . 
 Rates of gas elimination are considered to be asymmetric to uptake , and the model becomes more conservative as the number of dives , depth and duration increases . 
 The BSAC ' 88 Tables use a series of seven tables , labelled A to G , to take into account the variation in ingassing and outgassing rates assumed for sequential dives . 
 Depth increments of 3 m are used . 
 In a significant departure from conventional practice , the tables are not based on a bottom time defined as time of leaving the surface to time leaving the bottom , but on time to reach a depth of 6 m during the ascent . 
 Ascent rate to 6m is restricted to a maximum of 15 m per minute . 
 Ascent from 6 m to the surface must take 1 minute . 
 Decompression stops are done at 9 m and 6 m , and at the surface , as surface interval is considered a decompression period . 
 No stops are scheduled at 3 m , as it is considered too difficult to maintain a consistent depth in waves . 
 The initial dive uses table A , and the diver is allocated a Surfacing Code based on depth and time of the dive . After a surface interval of at least 15 minutes the diver can select a new Current Tissue Code which models the residual nitrogen load , and uses this code to select the repetitive dive table . 
 The BSAC ' 88 tables are presented in a format which does not require any calculation by the user . 
 = = = Varying Permeability Model = = = 
 This decompression model was developed by D.E. Yount and others at the University of Hawaii to model laboratory observations of bubble formation and growth in both inanimate and in vivo systems exposed to pressure variations . It presumes that microscopic bubble nuclei always exist in aqueous media , including living tissues . These bubble nuclei are spherical gas phases that are small enough to remain in suspension yet strong enough to resist collapse , their stability being provided by an elastic surface layer consisting of surface @-@ active molecules with variable gas permeability . These skins resist the effect of surface tension , as surface tension tends to collapse a small bubble by raising internal pressure above ambient so that the partial pressure gradient favours diffusion out of the bubble in inverse proportion to the radius of the surface . 
 Any nuclei larger than a specific " critical " size , will grow during decompression . The VPM aims to limit the cumulative volume of these growing bubbles during and after decompression to a tolerable level by limiting the pressure difference between the gas in the bubbles and the ambient pressure . In effect , this is equivalent to limiting the supersaturation , but instead of using an arbitrary linear fit to experimental data , the physics of bubble growth is used to model the acceptable supersaturation for any given pressure exposure history . 
 Growth in size and number of gas bubbles is computed based on factors representing pressure balances in the bubbles , physical properties of the " skins " and the surrounding environment . If the total volume of gas in the bubbles is predicted to be less than a " critical volume " , then the diver is assumed to be within the safe limits of the model . 
 The bubble model is superposed on a multiple parallel tissue compartment model . <unk> is assumed to follow the classic Haldanean model . 
 = = = = Bubble population distribution = = = = 
 Bubble size vs number has an exponential distribution 
 = = = = Bubble nucleation = = = = 
 Gas bubbles with a radius greater than 1 micron should float to the surface of a standing liquid , whereas smaller ones should dissolve rapidly due to surface tension . The Tiny Bubble Group has been able to resolve this apparent paradox by developing and experimentally verifying a new model for stable gas nuclei . 
 According to the varying @-@ permeability model , gas bubble nuclei are simply stable microbubbles . The stability of these microbubbles is due to elastic skins or membranes consisting of surface @-@ active molecules . These skins are normally permeable to gas , and collapse is prevented by their compression strength . These skins can become stiff and effectively impermeable to gas when they are subjected to large compressions , typically exceeding 8 atm , at which stage the pressure inside increases during further compression as predicted by Boyle 's law . 
 Essentially , there are three parameters in the VP model : the compression strength of the skin ; the initial radius ; and the onset pressure for impermeability . 
 = = = = Ordering hypothesis = = = = 
 The ordering hypothesis states that nuclei are neither created nor destroyed by the pressure schedule , and initial ordering according to size is preserved . 
 It follows from the ordering hypothesis that each bubble count is determined by the properties and behavior of that one " critical " nucleus which is right at the bubble formation threshold . All nuclei that are larger than the critical nucleus will form bubbles , and all nuclei that are smaller will not . Furthermore , a family of pressure schedules which yields the same bubble count N is characterized by the same critical nucleus and hence by the same critical radius , the same crumbling compression , and the same onset of impermeability . 
 = = = = Development of decompression model = = = = 
 The original assumption was that bubble number is directly proportional to decompression stress . This approach worked well for long exposures , but not when the exposure time varied considerably . 
 A better model was obtained by allowing more bubbles to form on the shorter dives than on the longer dives . The constant bubble number assumption was replaced by a " dynamic @-@ critical @-@ volume hypothesis " . As in earlier applications of the critical @-@ volume criterion , it was assumed that whenever the total volume of gas phase accumulated exceeds a critical value , signs or symptoms of DCS will appear . In the special case of long exposures the two models are equivalent . 
 The " dynamic " aspect of this hypothesis is that gas is continuously entering and leaving the gas phase . 
 The accumulated volume is calculated as a function of time by integrating over the product of the bubble number and the degree of supersaturation , and subtracting the free gas that is being dissipated continuously by the lung . 
 Gas uptake and elimination are assumed to be exponential , as in conventional Haldanean models . 
 As a first approximation only the inert gasses are taken into account . For oxygen partial pressures above 2 @.@ 4 bar , the quantity of oxygen dissolved in the arterial blood exceeds the amount that the body can use , and the hemoglobin is saturated with oxygen in both the veins and the arteries . If more oxygen is added , the partial pressure of oxygen in the venous blood rises . 
 = = = = Comparison of VPM profiles with other models = = = = 
 Comparisons of VPM profiles with USN decompression schedules for extreme exposure dives consistently produce similar total ascent times , but significantly deeper first decompression stops . 
 = = = Reduced Gradient Bubble Model = = = 
 The RGBM developed by Dr Bruce Wienke at Los Alamos National Laboratory is a hybrid model which modifies a Haldanian model with factors to take some account of bubble mechanics to model gas phase production during decompression . The bubble factor modifies the M @-@ values of the Haldanian model , making it more conservative . 
 Features of the modifying factor ξ include : 
 ξ starts on the first dive of a repetitive series with the maximum value of one , so it will make the model more conservative or unchanged . 
 ξ decreases for repetitive dives . 
 ξ decreases as exposure time increases . 
 ξ increases with increased surface interval . 
 ξ modifies fast compartments more than slow compartments . 
 ξ decreases with the depth of a dive segment 
 ξ has more effect on repetitive dives which are deeper than previous dives in the series . 
 The effect is to reduce no @-@ stop dive time or increase decompression requirements for repetitive dive in the following categories : 
 Following a short surface interval . 
 Following a long dive . 
 Following a deep dive . 
 Which are deeper than previous dives . 
 The model has been used to some extent in some <unk> dive computers , and in the <unk> Explorer computer , where it is a user selected option for computation formula , with a choice of additional conservatism factors . 
 The complete RGBM treats coupled perfusion @-@ diffusion transport as a two @-@ stage process , with perfusion providing a boundary condition for gas penetration of the tissues by diffusion . Either process can dominate the exchange depending on time and rate coefficients . 
 Simplified implementations which require less computational power are available for use in personal decompression computers . These are dominated by perfusion . The inherent biological unsaturation of tissues is considered in the calculations . 
 The model assumes that bubble nuclei are always present in a specific size distribution , and that a certain number are induced to grow by compression and decompression . An iterative computation is used to model ascent to limit the combined volume of the gas phase . Gas mixtures of helium , nitrogen , and oxygen contain bubble distributions of different sizes , but the same phase volume limit is used . 
 The model postulates bubble nuclei with aqueous and / or lipid skin structure , in a number and size distribution quantified by an equation @-@ of @-@ state . Like the VPM , RGBM assumes the size distribution is exponentially decreasing in size . Unlike the varying permeability model , bubble seeds are assumed permeable to gas transfer across skin boundaries under all pressures . 
 The size of nuclei which will grow during decompression is inversely proportional to the supersaturation gradient . 
 At higher pressures , skin tension of the bubble nuclei reduces gas diffusion to a slower rate . The model assumes that bubble skins are stabilized by surfactants over calculable times scales , which results in variable persistence of the bubble nuclei in the tissues .

 Decompression models and algorithms developed for binary mixtures of nitrogen and oxygen can not be used for gases containing significant amounts of other diluent gases without modification to take into account the different solubilities and diffusion constants of the alternative or added diluents .

 To a large extent commercial offshore diving uses heliox tables that have been developed by the major commercial diving enterprises such as Comex , Oceaneering International ( <unk> ) Alpha tables , American Oilfield Diving ( AOD ) Company gas tables , though modifications of the US Navy Partial pressure tables are also used . In 2006 the unmodified US Navy tables ( Revision 5 ) were considered to result in an unacceptably high rate of decompression sickness for commercial applications . 
 " <unk> " heliox tables were developed and used by Comex between 1970 and 1982 . The tables were available in two versions . One was designed for surface @-@ supplied diving and limited to 75 m . The diver breathed heliox as the bottom mix and 100 % oxygen at the 6 m stop . The other was designed for closed bell bounce diving and allowed for exposures up to 120 minutes , and depths to 120 m . The diver breathed heliox in the water and in the bell , air after transfer into the deck decompression chamber , and finally oxygen on built in breathing system ( <unk> ) from 12 m to the surface . These tables produced a relatively high incidence of decompression sickness .

 = Veratalpa = 
 Veratalpa lugdunensiana is a fossil mammal from the Miocene of France . Known from a single astragalus ( a <unk> ) , the species was assigned to its own genus , Veratalpa , by Florentino Ameghino in 1905 . He placed it in Talpidae , the family of the moles , but in 1974 , John Howard Hutchison argued that the astragalus was not talpid and more likely came from a rodent . The astragalus is about 4 @.@ 5 mm long , broad for a talpid , and has the head oriented farther from the axis of the foot than in talpids . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Argentine naturalist Florentino Ameghino described Veratalpa in an overview of the astragali from the middle Miocene of Vieux Collonges in France . The astragalus is a bone of the foot that is part of the ankle joint . He listed several species of the family Talpidae ( moles and related species ) from Vieux Collonges , including " espèce C " ( " species C " ) , which he named as a new genus and species , Veratalpa lugdunensiana , in a footnote . In a 1906 review of Ameghino 's paper , Édouard Louis Trouessart affirmed that Veratalpa probably represented a new genus of mole , but noted that the specific name lugdunensiana would have been more correctly written " <unk> " . According to Trouessart , the suffix <unk> is appropriate for names that reference persons , but not for those that refer to places , such as this name , which is derived from Lugdunum ( the Latin name for Lyon ) . 
 In a 1974 review of Miocene European talpids , John Howard Hutchison wrote that the astragalus of Veratalpa lacked any features that would ally it with talpids and commented that it was most likely a rodent . In their 1997 Classification of Mammals , Malcolm McKenna and Susan Bell listed Veratalpa as a member of <unk> of uncertain affinities . 
 = = Description = = 
 The astragalus of Veratalpa is the largest among those from Vieux Collonges that Ameghino assigned to Talpidae . Although at 4 @.@ 5 mm it is about as long as his " species A " , it is broader , and Hutchison noted the broadness as one of the characters that argue against classification of Veratalpa in Talpidae . Like living moles , it has a broad , flat , and short head , but it forms a noticeably small angle with the body — in actual moles , the head is more axially oriented ( i.e. , towards the central axis of the foot ) . The surface of the head that contacts the <unk> is less rounded than in moles . The body is low and nearly square and has a diameter of about 3 mm . The trochlea — a surface on the body of the bone that articulates with the tibia ( lower leg bone ) — is not large and pulley @-@ like , as in talpids . There is a small perforation on the lower side of the body . This perforation is larger in Ameghino 's other supposed talpids , and Trouessart suggested on the basis of this feature that the internal parts of the toes were reduced in Veratalpa . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 Veratalpa is known only from the locality of Vieux Collonges near Lyon in southeastern France ; Ameghino knew this locality as " Mont @-@ <unk> " . This rich fissure filling locality has yielded thousands of fossils and is currently dated to the early @-@ middle Miocene boundary , around 17 million years ago ( MN 4 / 5 in the MN zonation ) . As Veratalpa is known from a single astragalus , Ameghino considered it to be rare . He distinguished six talpid species among the astragali , but according to Hutchison only Ameghino 's species F ( which was assigned to Talpidae with a query ) is really a talpid . 
 = SMS Arminius = 
 SMS Arminius was an ironclad warship of the Prussian Navy , later the Imperial German Navy . The ship was designed by the British Royal Navy Captain Cowper Coles and built by the Samuda Brothers shipyard in Cubitt Town , London as a speculative effort ; Prussia purchased the ship during the Second Schleswig War against Denmark , though the vessel was not delivered until after the war . The ship was armed with four 21 cm ( 8 @.@ 3 in ) guns in a pair of revolving gun turrets amidships . She was named for Arminius , the victor of the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest . 
 Arminius served as a coastal defense ship for the first six years of her service with the Prussian Navy . She saw extensive service in the Austro @-@ Prussian and Franco @-@ Prussian wars during the process of German unification . The vessel was the primary challenge to the French blockade of German ports during the latter conflict . After the wars , Arminius was withdrawn from front @-@ line service and used in a variety of secondary roles , including as a training ship for engine @-@ room crews and as a tender for the school ship Blücher . The ship was eventually sold in 1901 and broken up for scrap the following year . 
 = = Design = = 
 = = = General characteristics and machinery = = = 
 The warship that came to be SMS Arminius was designed by Captain Cowper Coles , a British Royal Navy officer and advocate of turret @-@ armed ironclad warships . Arminius was nearly identical to the Danish ironclad Rolf Krake , also designed by Captain Coles . The vessel was constructed with transverse frames and constructed with an iron hull , which contained eight watertight compartments . The ship was 61 @.@ 60 meters ( 202 @.@ 1 ft ) long at the waterline and 63 @.@ 21 m ( 207 @.@ 4 ft ) long overall . The ship had a beam of 10 @.@ 9 m ( 36 ft ) and a draft of 4 @.@ 32 m ( 14 @.@ 2 ft ) forward and 4 @.@ 55 m ( 14 @.@ 9 ft ) aft . She was designed to displace 1 @,@ 653 metric tons ( 1 @,@ 627 long tons ; 1 @,@ 822 short tons ) but at combat load , Arminius displaced up to 1 @,@ 829 t ( 1 @,@ 800 long tons ; 2 @,@ 016 short tons ) . 
 The ship 's crew consisted of ten officers and 122 enlisted men . She carried a number of smaller boats , including two pinnaces , two cutters , and one dinghy . Arminius was not a particularly successful design ; she suffered from severe , fast rolling , especially in heavier seas . She also shipped a great deal of water over the bow and was unbalanced in steering . The ship turned rapidly to starboard but was sluggish in turning to port . Indeed , the ship was required to have the rudder at 15 degrees to port in order to remain on a straight course . It was also impossible to control the ship with only sail power . 
 The ship was powered by a single two @-@ cylinder single expansion engine built by J. Penn & Sons , Greenwich . The engine drove a single two @-@ bladed screw that was 3 @.@ 96 m ( 13 @.@ 0 ft ) in diameter . Four transverse trunk boilers , each of which had four fireboxes apiece , supplied steam to the engine . The boilers were also built by J Penn & Sons , Greenwich , and were arranged in a single boiler room . Limited electrical power was provided by a single generator , which supplied 1 @.@ 9 kilowatts at 55 volts . The ship was equipped with a schooner rig with a surface area of 540 square meters . The propulsion system was rated at 1 @,@ 200 indicated horsepower ( 890 kW ) and a top speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) , though on trials , Arminius reached 1 @,@ 440 ihp ( 1 @,@ 070 kW ) and 11 @.@ 2 kn ( 20 @.@ 7 km / h ; 12 @.@ 9 mph ) . The ship carried 171 t ( 168 long tons ; 188 short tons ) of coal , which enabled a range of 2 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 700 km ; 2 @,@ 300 mi ) at a cruising speed of 8 kn ( 15 km / h ; 9 @.@ 2 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament and armor = = = 
 As built , Arminius was equipped with a main battery of four rifled , bronze 72 @-@ pounder cannon , but after delivery to the Prussian Navy , they were replaced with four 21 cm ( 8 @.@ 3 in ) L / 19 guns . These guns were supplied with a total of 332 rounds , and could elevate to 12 degrees . At maximum elevation , the guns could engage targets out to 2 @,@ 800 m ( 9 @,@ 200 ft ) . After 1881 , four machine guns were installed , along with a single 35 cm ( 14 in ) torpedo tube mounted in the bow above the waterline . 
 Arminius 's armor consisted of wrought iron backed with teak plating . The conning tower was protected by 114 mm ( 4 @.@ 5 in ) of wrought iron on 229 mm ( 9 @.@ 0 in ) of teak . The armored belt ranged in thickness from 76 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) of iron on the bow and stern to 114 mm amidships , the entire length of which was backed by 229 m of teak . The two turrets were armored with 114 mm of iron on 406 mm ( 16 @.@ 0 in ) of timber .

 She was built by the Samuda Brothers shipyard in London as a speculative project , possibly to sell to the Confederate Navy . The ship was laid down in 1863 and launched on 20 August 1864 . Prussia instead purchased the ship on 20 August 1864 , and commissioned her on 22 April 1865 as SMS Arminius . Delivery was delayed by the British government ; the British were sympathetic to Denmark , which was then engaged in a war with Prussia and Austria . The British therefore prevented the ship from being delivered until after the war was concluded . The cost of the ship , which amounted to some 1 @,@ 887 @,@ 000 gold marks , was paid in part by public donations . Arminius served as a harbor defense ship for six years , through 1871 . Along with the ironclad ram Prinz Adalbert , Arminius was the first armored warship acquired by the Prussian Navy . 
 At the outbreak of the Austro @-@ Prussian War in mid @-@ 1866 , Arminius was mobilized along with Prinz Adalbert , the only other Prussian ironclad . The ships were initially based in Kiel , but in the opening days of the war , Arminius raced to Hamburg via the Skagerrak and the Kattegat , a distance of some 940 nautical miles ( 1 @,@ 740 km ; 1 @,@ 080 mi ) , in 100 hours , an impressive feat for an early ironclad warship . Without a naval threat from Austria , the Prussian navy therefore concentrated its effort against the Kingdom of Hanover . For the remainder of the conflict , Arminius operated out of Geestemünde , under the command of Reinhold Werner , and the mere appearance of Arminius caused several Hanoverian coastal batteries to surrender . On 15 June , Arminius and a pair of gunboats , Tiger and Cyclops , covered the crossing of the Elbe river by General Edwin von Manteuffel and some 13 @,@ 500 soldiers to attack the city of Hanover . By the end of the month , the Prussian army had decisively defeated the Austrians at Königgrätz and ended the war . On 3 October 1866 , the ship raced the US Navy 's monitor USS Miantonomoh in Kiel ; Arminius was two knots faster than the American vessel . In 1870 , the ship had her sailing rig removed . 
 At the outbreak of the Franco @-@ Prussian War of 1870 – 1871 , the Prussian Navy concentrated Arminius and the armored frigates Kronprinz , Friedrich Carl , and König Wilhelm in the North Sea naval base Wilhelmshaven . Arminius was stationed in Kiel at the outbreak of war , but managed to break through the French blockade by hugging the Swedish coast , which her shallow draft permitted . Her passage through Swedish territorial waters also protected the ship from French attack . Despite the great French naval superiority , the French had conducted insufficient pre @-@ war planning for an assault on the Prussian naval installations , and concluded that it would only be possible with Danish assistance , which was not forthcoming . The four ships , under the command of Vice Admiral Jachmann , made an offensive sortie in early August 1870 out to the Dogger Bank , though they encountered no French warships . The three armored frigates thereafter suffered from chronic engine trouble , which left Arminius alone to conduct operations . 
 Captain Otto <unk> commanded the ship during the war . In the course of the war , she sortied from the port over forty times ; these also failed to result in major combat , though she occasionally traded shots with the blockading French warships . For the majority of the war , Arminius was stationed in the mouth of the Elbe along with the ironclad ram Prinz Adalbert and three small gunboats . The three armored frigates remained off the island of Wangerooge . On 11 September , the three frigates were again ready for action ; they joined Arminius for another major operation , though it too did not encounter French opposition . The French Navy had by this time returned to France . 
 After being removed from front @-@ line service in 1872 , she was used as a training vessel for naval engineers . The ship was decommissioned in 1875 and placed in reserve . Her ram bow allowed her to be used as an ice @-@ breaker in Kiel in the 1880s . In 1882 , she was used as a tender for the cadet training vessel Blücher . The ship was rebuilt in 1888 ; during the refit the propulsion system was overhauled and replaced with German @-@ built equipment and two searchlights were installed . The ship was ultimately stricken from the naval register on 2 March 1901 and sold to shipbreakers for 72 @,@ 000 gold marks . Arminius was broken up for scrap the following year .

 Tabitha A. D 'umo ( née <unk> ; born September 11 , 1973 ) and Napoleon Buddy D 'umo ( born October 17 , 1968 ) , known together as Nappytabs , are Emmy Award @-@ winning married choreographers who are often credited with developing lyrical hip @-@ hop . They are best known for their choreography on the television show So You Think You Can Dance and for being supervising choreographers and executive producers of America 's Best Dance Crew . Since being with the former , their choreography has received both praise and criticism . They own Nappytabs urban dancewear and have been working in the dance industry since 1996 . 
 Tabitha and Napoleon grew up on opposite coasts of the United States and met in the early 1990s as students at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas . They began their dance career together while still in college by choreographing industrial musicals for large corporations with the hip @-@ hop dance company Culture Shock . After moving to Los Angeles in 1999 , they started teaching hip @-@ hop classes at the Edge Performing Arts Center in North Hollywood . They took additional jobs choreographing for professional sports dance teams and back @-@ up dancing for musical artists . In 2003 , they joined the faculty of Monsters of Hip Hop dance convention . 
 Their work was introduced to mainstream audiences in 2008 when they became supervising choreographers on America 's Best Dance Crew and resident choreographers on So You Think You Can Dance . It was on the later show that their lyrical hip @-@ hop choreography style gained exposure . The pair 's career progressed to providing creative direction for tours and live events , where they worked with Christina Aguilera , Ricky Martin , Celine Dion , and Jennifer Lopez . They continued to develop their dancewear line by breaking out of its previously online @-@ only presence and opening a physical store location in 2010 . 
 From television and concerts , their move into theater occurred gradually . In 2010 , they directed the JabbaWockeeZ 's MÜS.I.C. stage show and began to work with Cirque du Soleil ; they choreographed Viva Elvis and were contributing choreographers for Michael Jackson : The Immortal World Tour . In 2012 , they continued to establish themselves in television as choreographers for Madonna 's Super Bowl halftime performance . They also choreographed several music videos including two for K @-@ pop artists TVXQ and BoA . Aside from their choreography , creative direction , and dancewear line , Tabitha and Napoleon continue to teach hip @-@ hop classes at dance studios and on the convention circuit .

 Napoleon was born October 17 , 1968 . While growing up as one of three children in Victorville , California , he learned b @-@ boying , locking , and popping by traveling to Los Angeles and frequenting the b @-@ boy scene ; he was eventually cast as an extra in the movie Breakin ' 2 : Electric Boogaloo in 1984 . After Napoleon graduated from Apple Valley High School , he joined the army and worked as a surgeon 's assistant while stationed in Germany . Once discharged , he attended the University of Nevada , Las Vegas ( UNLV ) where he majored in molecular biology and started taking jazz and modern dance classes . 
 Tabitha was born September 11 , 1973 , and grew up as an only child in Galloway Township , New Jersey . Her mother enrolled her in jazz dance classes when she was young . Since there were no hip @-@ hop classes , Tabitha learned by watching music videos and participating in her school 's cheer and dance teams . She cites Michael Jackson , Janet Jackson , and Paula Abdul as influences . While cheerleading at <unk> High School , Tabitha earned " All @-@ American " status at an NCA camp and got the opportunity to perform in the Aloha Bowl in Hawaii . After Tabitha graduated , she moved to Nevada in 1991 to attend UNLV where she majored in communications and started taking formal hip @-@ hop dance classes . It was there at a party that she met Napoleon . 
 While hanging out with her cheerleading and dance team friends , Tabitha invited Napoleon and his body building friends to come to a casual practice session and do stunt work with them . Napoleon and his friends eventually attended a formal practice session on campus , and the coach was so impressed with their work that they all received full scholarships to join the team . Tabitha and Napoleon started dating in 1994 , but their professional partnership and dance career did not start until 1996 when they began teaching hip @-@ hop classes together at the Las Vegas Athletic Club . Since the beginning of their career , they have always worked together including their first choreography job and the first dance class they taught .

 While Tabitha and Napoleon were still in college , they were accepted into the dance company Culture Shock where they met members of the JabbaWockeeZ before the JabbaWockeeZ became a crew . In addition to going to school and being a part of Culture Shock , they both maintained part @-@ time jobs . Together they worked at Bunker Dance Center in Las Vegas teaching hip @-@ hop classes . Separately Napoleon worked as a personal trainer and Tabitha worked at the Rio Hotel and Casino . While dancing with Culture Shock , Tabitha created demo reels of the company to send to event organizers who were having conventions in Las Vegas . Tabitha and Napoleon used this method to book choreography jobs and it was during this time that they honed their lyrical hip @-@ hop style . Through Culture Shock , they were hired to choreograph several industrial musicals for casinos and corporations such as Nike , Levi , Redken , Matrix Hair , and MAC . They eventually worked their way up from company dancers to become the artistic directors . As their college graduation was approaching — although Tabitha was planning to take a job in public relations and Napoleon was planning to attend medical school — they both decided to change their plans and pursue a career in the dance industry . 
 Tabitha and Napoleon were married April 19 , 1998 . In 1999 , they moved to Los Angeles to expand their opportunities . Upon arriving in L.A. , they taught hip @-@ hop classes at the Edge Performing Arts Center . 
 They found extra work as back @-@ up dancers for Beyoncé , Toni Braxton , Missy Elliott , Monica , Timbaland , Sisqó , and Destiny 's Child whom they both went on tour with in 2002 . Their move from dancing into choreography occurred gradually . Jobs included choreographing performances for NFL and NBA dance teams including the Dallas Cowboys , Denver Broncos , Chicago Bulls , and Orlando Magic . In November 2002 , they made the cover of Dance Spirit magazine . They were profiled with seven other choreographers and interviewed about what it takes to make it as a dancer in Los Angeles . In 2003 , Napoleon started teaching classes with Monsters of Hip Hop dance convention . Tabitha joined him later and they are still permanent faculty members to this day . 
 In 2005 , Tabitha and Napoleon started Nappytabs dancewear . They cite the lack of appropriate dancewear for the hip @-@ hop dance community as inspiration for the company . Early in its production , Tabitha sewed the clothes herself . The Nappytabs logo began as a yin and yang like symbol with an " n " and a " t " overlapping in the middle . The word itself — Nappytabs — is a combination of Napoleon ( Nappy ) and Tabitha 's ( Tab ) nicknames . Contrary to popular belief , the name ' Nappytabs ' started as their clothing line first . They did not call themselves Nappytabs , and the word being a nickname to refer to both of them did not start until they became choreographers on So You Think You Can Dance . 
 Tabitha and Napoleon began creative directing stage shows and concerts in the mid @-@ 2000s . In 2006 , they served as assistant directors for Christina Aguilera ’ s Back to Basics Tour . In 2007 , they were also assistant directors for Ricky Martin ’ s Black and White Tour . Both tours were directed by Jamie King who is known primarily for his work with Madonna . 
 Tabitha was the host / instructor of an exercise DVD by Prevention Fitness Systems titled Drop it with Dance . The video is split into six 10 @-@ minute routines that gradually increase in difficulty ; movements from all six routines are combined in the finale " Showtime " segment . She also appeared in Rock Your Body , another dance fitness DVD hosted by Jamie King .

 Tabitha and Napoleon became supervising choreographers for the inaugural season of America 's Best Dance Crew in 2008 . They were responsible for choreographing group routines , coming up with dance challenges , and assisting the crews as needed with polishing their performances . Also in 2008 , they took on hosting duties for Rock the Reception . On the show , they created wedding dances for engaged couples and their wedding party to perform at the reception . The participants were real life couples with no dance experience . In addition to America 's Best Dance Crew and Rock the Reception , they joined the choreography and judging team on the fourth season of So You Think You Can Dance . It was on this show that their lyrical hip @-@ hop choreography style gained mainstream exposure . 
 Lyrical hip @-@ hop is a fluid and more interpretive version of standard hip @-@ hop often danced to downtempo rap music or R & B music . The term itself was coined by choreographer and producer Adam Shankman in reference to a routine choreographed by Tabitha and Napoleon to Leona Lewis ' song " Bleeding Love " . " Bleeding Love " was nominated for a 2009 Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography . After the season ended , Tabitha and Napoleon directed the 2008 So You Think You Can Dance Tour . They continued creative directing several other concerts throughout the remainder of the year . 
 They teamed up with Jamie King again and served as assistant directors for Celine Dion 's Taking Chances Tour . They directed Monsters of Hip Hop : The Show and America 's Best Dance Crew Live which featured dance crews JabbaWockeeZ , Super <unk> , Fanny Pak , <unk> , and <unk> . OMG ! gave the concert a positive review stating that the five crews represented a good mix of styles and that the concert brought the best parts of the show to the stage . 
 In January 2009 , the Nappytabs dancewear website launched which began the start of online clothing sales . Their dancewear website is designed and maintained by Ryan <unk> 's <unk> Design media company . <unk> is also a professional dancer and a colleague of Tabitha and Napoleon ; they have all taught at Shock the Intensive dance convention . When Tabitha and Napoleon joined So You Think You Can Dance , dancers on the show , as well as on America 's Best Dance Crew and Dancing With the Stars , were already wearing their clothing line during rehearsals . Some of the sponsors were not happy about it and wanted to cover the Nappytabs logo on the clothing . In response to this , judge and executive producer Nigel Lythgoe decided to start calling Tabitha and Napoleon " Nappytabs " during the show so that viewers who looked them up on Google would find their store 's website . 
 In April 2009 , Tabitha and Napoleon choreographed two couples ' routines and a group routine for the second season of So You Think You Can Dance Australia . The " Arab Money " hip @-@ hop routine that they choreographed received positive reviews from the judges but their " Dead and Gone " lyrical hip @-@ hop routine , which was performed later on the same episode , received the most praise . Bonnie Lythgoe called it the " top routine of the night " . Jason Coleman added " the choreography [ was ] absolutely spectacular " and Matt Lee said it was " ... probably the best routine in the series . " While in Australia , Tabitha and Napoleon were judges at the 2009 Australian Hip Hop Championships in Sydney . 
 Tabitha and Napoleon choreographed several television specials later in the year . In September , they choreographed the opening dance sequence on the season seven premiere of The Ellen DeGeneres Show . The routine featured both DeGeneres and the top ten dancers from season five of So You Think You Can Dance . At the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards , they choreographed a routine honoring dance that featured Karina Smirnoff and Maksim Chmerkovskiy from Dancing With The Stars ; Katee Shean , Mark Kanemura , and Joshua Allen from So You Think You Can Dance ; and four members of Quest Crew — the winners of season three of America 's Best Dance Crew . They finished the year with choreography for Carrie Underwood 's All @-@ Star Holiday Special and Jennifer Lopez ' performances at the American Music Awards and Dick Clark 's New Year 's Rockin ' Eve with Ryan Seacrest .

 In 2010 , Tabitha and Napoleon returned to So You Think You Can Dance ( SYTYCD ) for season seven and started to work with four different productions of Cirque du Soleil . In February , they provided choreography for Cirque du Soleil 's Viva Elvis show at the Aria hotel in Las Vegas . They also choreographed a Viva Elvis guest appearance on Dancing with the Stars . On SYTYCD , they choreographed routines for the contestants as well as one guest performance for the cast of Cirque du Soleil 's Beatles Love . They worked with Love again at the NHL awards and with their sister Cirque productions Kà , for a guest performance on America 's Got Talent , and Mystère , for a guest performance on Lopez Tonight . After SYTYCD ended , they appeared as guest choreographers on the Ukrainian version of the show called Everybody Can Dance ! / <unk> <unk> ! . 
 Aside from choreography , Tabitha and Napoleon continued to develop and expand their dancewear line . In May , they opened the Nappytabs store and dance studio in the North Hollywood Arts District . Although they design their own clothing , they commissioned some print and t @-@ shirt designs from Alex <unk> who has also designed for <unk> , a clothing line owned by Ben Harper , David Arquette , and David Bedwell . Through Nappytabs , they also started to sponsor The Pulse on Tour dance convention and the Industry Voice online newsletter . Their clothing appears in independent R & B singer John Gillette 's music video " All Bad " . Tabitha was a featured dancer in the video and Napoleon made a cameo appearance at the end . 
 Also in May , the JabbaWockeeZ ' MÜS.I.C. ( pronounced MUSE @-@ i @-@ see ) stage show , which Tabitha and Napoleon directed , opened at the MGM Grand Las Vegas hotel . MÜS.I.C. was the first hip @-@ hop dance stage show on the Las Vegas Strip . The show was 90 minutes long involving dancing , comedy , and magic . In October , MÜS.I.C. moved to the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino . At the Monte Carlo premiere , the JabbaWockeeZ brought Tabitha on stage for a cameo appearance . 
 In February 2011 , Tabitha and Napoleon made their music video directorial debut with the song " All These Boys " by Jasmine Villegas . Unlike John Gillette 's " All Bad " they did not dance or appear in the video , but they did serve as the choreographers . In the Spring , they returned to working in television with two projects . At the invitation of Nigel Lythgoe , they joined the production crew on the tenth season of American Idol as staging and creative directors . They also choreographed the Howie Mandel @-@ produced television show <unk> which premiered after American Idol on March 31 , 2011 . The pilot episode was actually shot in September 2010 , but after drawing 10 @.@ 8 million views it was picked up as a series . 
 In April 2011 , they started work on the film Make Your Move starring Derek Hough from Dancing With the Stars and K @-@ pop singer BoA Kwon . Their relationship with BoA extended past the production of the film when they choreographed the music video for her song " Only One " — the title track from her seventh studio album . <unk> called Tabitha and Napoleon 's involvement " beyond perfect " and acknowledged that using lyrical hip @-@ hop suited the song 's tempo and BoA 's movement . Due to scheduling conflicts with the production of Make Your Move , Tabitha and Napoleon did not return to America 's Best Dance Crew as supervising choreographers for season six . When filming was complete , they did return to Cirque du Soleil as two of ten choreographers for Michael Jackson : The Immortal World Tour . Like other stage shows they 've worked on in the past , this one was also directed by Jamie King . In the midst of all their professional accomplishments during the year , Christmas 2011 brought personal changes as Napoleon announced on their Twitter page that Tabitha was pregnant .

 Tabitha and Napoleon spent the beginning of 2012 apart . While Tabitha was choreographing Madonna 's halftime performance for Super Bowl XLVI , Napoleon was shooting more scenes for <unk> 3D and scouting for the seventh season of America 's Best Dance Crew . Although they never returned to America 's Best Dance Crew as supervising choreographers , Napoleon continued to serve as a talent scout — an extra role he had on the show since its inception . After the Super Bowl , Tabitha worked with Madonna again . She choreographed her music video " Girl Gone Wild " which featured all @-@ male Ukrainian dance troupe Kazaky . On August 10 , 2012 , she gave birth to son , London Riley D 'umo . During the last months of the year , Tabitha and Napoleon continued to work with K @-@ pop artists . They choreographed the music videos " <unk> " by TVXQ and " I Got A Boy " by Girls ' Generation . TVXQ , Girls ' Generation , and BoA are all signed to S. M. Entertainment . 
 In May 2013 — two years after the premiere of MÜS.I.C. — the JabbaWockeeZ debuted a new stage show at the Luxor Las Vegas hotel and casino called PRiSM , a backronym for Painting Reality in a Spectrum of Movement . Like their previous show , this one was also directed by Tabitha and Napoleon . The previous month , Tabitha and Napoleon choreographed the music video " Puttin ' on the Ritz " by Herb Alpert , a jazz musician and co @-@ founder of A & M Records . On June 25 , 2013 , they recreated the video on SYTYCD as the opening routine for season ten 's Top 20 performance episode . Yahoo ! Music called the performance " absolutely epic " . Like the video , it was also shot in one take and several people made cameo appearances including Sean Cheesman , Travis Wall , Chris Scott , Nigel Lythgoe , Mary Murphy , Jason <unk> , Herb Alpert , Lani Hall , and Tabitha and Napoleon themselves . 
 In February 2014 , Tabitha and Napoleon teamed up with TVXQ again to choreograph their music video " Spellbound " — the title track from their seventh album . Just like Alpert 's " Puttin ' on the Ritz " , this video was shot in one take , and just like BoA 's " Only One " , <unk> gave it a positive review : " With two people in the group , there is not much of an opportunity to play around with different formations . However , Nappytabs tends to utilize this formation for TVXQ – rotating the members in the foreground and background , instead of always keeping the two in the centre . And this works especially well with the one @-@ shot style , since it allows room for the duo to work the entire space on set , on and off @-@ camera . " Billboard.com also gave the video a positive review : " The duo makes a strong case for 2014 's best choreography in the [ Spellbound ] video . " Tabitha and Napoleon also choreographed Super Junior @-@ M 's music video " Swing " — the title track from their third EP . 
 In the Spring , Tabitha and Napoleon were judges at the hip @-@ hop competition World of Dance Los Angeles . In the Summer , they directed Derek and Julianne Hough 's Move Live on Tour and Jennifer Lopez 's A.K.A. promotional tour . In the later part of the year , they directed and choreographed the music video for " Harlem Hopscotch " , the first single from Maya Angelou 's posthumous poetry album Caged Bird Songs . The video premiered December 23 , 2014 , on Oprah.com and features cameo appearances by ballroom dancer Derek Hough and actress Zendaya . Tabitha and Napoleon also choreographed Ed Sheeran 's music video for the single " Thinking Out Loud " . As of October 2015 , it had amassed over 750 million views . 
 In 2015 , Tabitha and Napoleon continued to work on music videos . They choreographed BoA 's " Kiss My Lips " and <unk> 's " Call Me Baby " . Afterward , they choreographed Mariah Carey 's Number 1 's residency at Ceasar 's Palace hotel and executive produced the eighth season of America 's Best Dance Crew . Toward the end of the year , they sponsored the Dance Teacher Summit through their clothing line and appeared as judges on Every Single Step , a show Dance Spirit magazine called the " Project Runway for choreographers " . 
 In 2016 , Tabitha and Napoleon directed Jennifer Lopez 's Las Vegas residency All I Have . 
 = = Choreography style = = 
 = = = Artistry = = = 
 Tabitha and Napoleon 's choreography is primarily hip @-@ hop ; however , it varies across genres depending on what project they 're working on . For example , on America 's Best Dance Crew the group routines they choreographed have all been hip @-@ hop . However , on So You Think You Can Dance ( SYTYCD ) they choreographed a few jazz routines and on Cirque du Soleil 's Viva Elvis their work incorporated acro . In general , their choreography emphasizes big visuals , which they attribute to their cheerleading past , and is " ... largely centered on storytelling and physical comedy . " Inspiration for lifts is taken from lucha libre , adagio , and swing dance . The style they are most known for is lyrical hip @-@ hop . 
 = = = Lyrical hip @-@ hop = = = 
 Lyrical dance is a studio @-@ based dance style that uses a combination of classical dance techniques from jazz and ballet to tell a story through movement . With jazz and ballet , technique alone can provide a good performance but in lyrical dance expressing emotion is emphasized just as much as technique . Hip @-@ hop is an urban dance style that is characterized as hard @-@ hitting involving isolations — moving certain body parts independently from others — and musicality , the body 's sensitivity to changes in music . Hip @-@ hop can incorporate movement from its substyles locking , breaking , popping , and boogaloo to add a different movement quality but conveying emotion does not have to be present as the dance is more about bravado and personal enjoyment . Lyrical hip @-@ hop is a fluid and more interpretive version of standard hip @-@ hop . It combines the nuances of lyrical dance with the vocabulary and foundational movements found in hip @-@ hop . According to Dance Spirit magazine , what differentiates lyrical hip @-@ hop from standard hip @-@ hop is that dancers interpret the beat differently . In lyrical hip @-@ hop there are still isolations , gliding , and body waves just like in standard hip @-@ hop . However , the movements are smoother and more fluid rather than hard @-@ hitting and , like lyrical dance , emphasis is placed on storytelling and conveying emotion through the choreography . 
 Lyrical hip @-@ hop first gained mainstream exposure , and its name , in 2008 on season four of SYTYCD . The term itself is credited to Adam Shankman , a choreographer and judge on the program , who made a comment in reference to a routine choreographed by Tabitha and Napoleon D 'umo to Leona Lewis ' song " Bleeding Love " . Due to Shankman 's comment and their subsequent work on seasons four through seven , Tabitha and Napoleon are credited with developing this style . 
 Some hip @-@ hop purists feel the interpretive and softer approach means lyrical hip @-@ hop is not hip @-@ hop at all . From a purist perspective , dancing to the lyrics would make the choreography linear and too technical . This is because dancing to the words would take precedence over dancing to the beat . Traditionally in hip @-@ hop , dancing to the beat is essential ; lyrics can accent the movement , but the beat is the guiding force for the dancing . Other hip @-@ hop dancers , such as choreographer Shane Sparks , believe that lyrical hip @-@ hop is hip @-@ hop but not different enough for it to have a separate label or be in its own subgenre . 
 = = = Teaching = = = 
 Although Tabitha and Napoleon have a solid career in choreography and creative direction , they spend a significant amount of time teaching classes at dance studios and conventions . They have stated that teaching helps their choreography because it keeps them current on new hip @-@ hop social dances ( party dances ) . They are faculty members at Monsters of Hip Hop dance convention . In the past they have taught at Shock the Intensive , the Edge Performing Arts Center , Millennium Dance Complex , Hip Hop International , Dance Blitz , Seattle Theater Group , Coastal Dance Rage , the Dance Teacher Web Conference and Expo , Teen Dance Company of the Bay Area , JUMP , Xtreme Dance Force , ProDance , Triple Threat Dance , Project 818 , <unk> , <unk> , the So You Think You Can Dance Experience , DANCE ! The Convention , the Hollywood Summer Tour , Velocity , <unk> , The Zoo , and VIP Dance Events .

 The JabbaWockeeZ performed the show MÜS.I.C. from May 2010 to September 2012 . Over the course of their two @-@ year run , the show received mixed reviews . For their second show PRiSM they signed a six @-@ year deal which included building a new 830 @-@ seat theater in a space that used to house a motion @-@ simulator ride . Upon opening , PRiSM was met with positive reviews . Tabitha and Napoleon directed both shows . 
 = = = = MÜS.I.C. = = = = 
 The first run of MÜS.I.C. was held at the MGM Grand Las Vegas hotel and casino . Las Vegas Weekly wrote that MÜS.I.C. had " game @-@ changing potential " because it was the first time hip @-@ hop dance had headlined a show on the Las Vegas Strip . In contrast , the Las Vegas Review @-@ Journal ( LVRJ ) criticized the show for being repetitious and for having a bare stage for the first 20 minutes . LVRJ also criticized the use of masks as not appealing to a casual viewer because it inhibited the dancers ' personality : " Even if a generational split is in play here , it would be tough to hear the creators argue that the show would suffer if , after 20 minutes or so -- gasp ! -- makeup or clown @-@ face replaced the masks to expand the original concept . " In October 2010 , the show moved to the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino . Changes to the original show included a bigger stage , a new set , and added dance routines . <unk> called the new show " amazing " and <unk> described it as " a vibrant , frenetic and multi @-@ genre extravaganza of visuals , sound and movement . " 
 In April 2012 , the Jabbawockeez began running two MÜS.I.C. shows in tandem . Some members stayed with the flagship show in Las Vegas while the others took the show on limited residencies elsewhere . Their first residency outside Las Vegas was in Australia at the Jupiters Hotel and Casino in Gold Coast , Queensland . Gold Coast Magazine gave the show a good review describing it as " magical ... it truly does stir an emotional response through your soul and the combination of dance and drama make it appealing to all ages . " After leaving Jupiters , the Jabbawockeez took up a second month @-@ long residency in August 2012 at Harrah 's Resort Atlantic City casino in New Jersey . Philly.com gave it a lukewarm review : " The problem is that as good as Jabbawockeez is at what [ they do ] , the novelty wears off about a third @-@ way through the show ... the bulk of the performance pretty much offers little more than variations on a theme . As such , Jabbawockeez would have much more impact as a featured act in a variety show than it has on its own . " The members that stayed in Las Vegas temporarily moved into an 800 @-@ seat tent outside the Monte Carlo to continue their show . <unk> reviewed the tent show and called it " an entertaining , fun , and interactive performance show . " They performed in the tent from June 2012 through September 2012 with the understanding they would take up residence in the Luxor Las Vegas hotel and casino in the Spring of 2013 . 
 = = = = PRiSM = = = = 
 The JabbaWockeeZ second stage show PRiSM opened at the Luxor Las Vegas on May 31 , 2013 . The show 's original title was Nonsense ( a nod to the crew 's name ) because , at the time , they lacked a cohesive theme . However , it was Napoleon 's idea to change the title to PRiSM since there were seven crew members and when light goes into a prism , seven colors emerge ( the Luxor hotel is in the shape of a triangular prism ) . From that point on , unity and color became the themes of the show . 
 PRiSM received positive reviews . Las Vegas Weekly wrote " Those who deride the art of pantomime or breakdancing need to check this show out . It will change your mind . " Las Vegas Sun ( <unk> ) described the show as " a mix of great choreography , interesting storylines and special effects reminiscent of Electric Daisy Carnival ... " . <unk> also wrote " It ’ s great to see a different kind of headliner — in content and ethnic makeup — thriving on the Strip . " Vegas Kool stated that the new theater " ... is laid out [ so ] everyone has a great view of the stage . " Las Vegas Review @-@ Journal ( LVRJ ) directly addressed Tabitha and Napoleon 's involvement in " ... turning the Jabbawockeez brand into an oddly endearing mix of mime , modern dance and physical theater . " 
 Several reviewers noted that overall PRiSM is better than MÜS.I.C. LVRJ wrote " ... it all seems to hang together better this time , with a seamless flow and unifying themes of brotherhood and diversity . " Dance Track Magazine wrote " Not only does the show have a much more intimate feel than previous Jabbawockeez shows , but PRiSM also includes increased audience participation , intensified humor and a storyline that is dramatic and flows through the entire performance . " <unk> had the same observation : " ... the [ previous ] shows were plagued by lost opportunities , undeveloped ideas , and repetition . They seem to have corrected these shortcomings . ' Prism ' is better in almost every way over its predecessors . The show has a cohesiveness that it never had before , good follow @-@ through on ideas , and far more intriguing staging . The choreography is strong , varied , and doesn ’ t suffer the repetition that had invaded it previously . " 
 = = = So You Think You Can Dance = = = 
 Most criticism of Tabitha and Napoleon 's choreography has come as a result of their work on So You Think You Can Dance ( SYTYCD ) . Over the course of their involvement with the show , they have received mixed reviews . At worst , their choreography has been criticized as " softie hip @-@ hop ( more like ' hip @-@ pop ' ) " . At best , it has been described as " amazing " and " bring [ ing ] out the best in their dancers ... " . 
 = = = = Seasons four , five , and six = = = = 
 Lyrical hip @-@ hop gained exposure and popularity during Tabitha and Napoleon 's first season with SYTYCD ( season four ) . On the first performance episode , contestants Katee Shean and Joshua Allen performed a D 'umo choreographed lyrical hip @-@ hop piece to the song " No Air " by Jordin Sparks . This routine received positive reviews and was later chosen as a " Judges ' Favorite " by judge and executive producer Nigel Lythgoe to be performed again during the finale . <unk> wrote that the routine deserved an Emmy nomination . Although Tabitha and Napoleon were not nominated for " No Air " , they were nominated for " Bleeding Love " , another lyrical hip @-@ hop routine performed by Mark Kanemura and <unk> Hightower which the San Francisco Gate called a " great drama from hip @-@ hop choreographers Tabitha and Napoleon D <unk> , danced with chemistry and theatrical flair . " This routine was picked as a " Judges ' Favorite " by choreographer and judge Christopher " Lil ' C " Toler . In June 2010 , <unk> named " No Air " and " Bleeding Love " two of the ten best routines from all seasons of SYTYCD . A third Tabitha and Napoleon lyrical hip @-@ hop routine choreographed to Alicia Keys ' song " Like You 'll Never See Me Again " did not receive as much critical praise or attention as " Bleeding Love " or " No Air " ; however , Nigel Lythgoe confessed when giving feedback on the dance that season four was the first time he had been emotionally affected by hip @-@ hop routines . 
 Seasons five and six brought less praise for Tabitha and Napoleon . During season five 's Top 8 performance episode , Lythgoe commented after a hip @-@ hop routine choreographed by Shane Sparks " It 's wonderful to have Shane Sparks back this season . He brings something else ... I 've been a little disappointed with our hip @-@ hop this year . " Out of the ten hip @-@ hop routines ( both couples and group routines ) choreographed on season five previous to Lythgoe 's comment , Tabitha and Napoleon choreographed seven . The most significant criticism came during season six in response to " People are Strange " — a routine about how aliens would attempt to dance hip @-@ hop . None of the judges liked the routine . Lythgoe said the routine placed concept ( theme ) over substance ( dancing ) . All the judges felt that the dance was weird and that the choreography was more to blame for the dancers ' performance than the dancing itself . Of the routine " Give it to me Right " that Tabitha and Napoleon choreographed on a later season six episode about two fraternizing office employees , <unk> wrote that many parts were awkward and that the dance only became enjoyable once the dancers " stopped cavorting around the desk and got out on the floor . " In contrast to the mediocre to bad reviews , two other routines they choreographed were picked as " Judges ' Favorite " during the season six finale : " <unk> ' " ( chosen by Lil ' C ) and " I Can Transform Ya " ( chosen by Mary Murphy ) . 
 = = = = Seasons seven and eight = = = = 
 Tabitha and Napoleon received their best reviews on SYTYCD during season seven after a performance they choreographed to the song " Outta Your Mind " by Lil Jon . <unk> called the routine " brilliantly imaginative . " Pioneer Local called it " powerful ... It 's been so long since [ Tabitha and Napoleon ] have had a showstopping hip @-@ hop number on SYTYCD . Not since Season 4 when they had Katee , Joshua , tWitch , Mark and <unk> have they pulled out hip @-@ hop this good . " The routine was performed by ballet dancer Alex Wong and " All @-@ Star " hip @-@ hop dancer Stephen " tWitch " Boss from season four . The concept is about a psychologist ( tWitch ) who teaches a dancer ( Alex ) to let go of his technique and inhibitions and just dance . After the performance , tWitch and Alex received a standing ovation from the crowd and all three judges — Nigel Lythgoe , Mia Michaels , and Adam Shankman . Host Cat Deeley commented " I have never , never , in ' So You Think You Can Dance ' history , heard a roar from a crowd like this - ever . " Lythgoe called the concept " brilliant ... This is about a ballet dancer doing the most incredible hip @-@ hop ... If this routine and you are not up for an Emmy with Napoleon and Tabitha next year , I don 't know why not . It 's probably one of the funnest , best hip @-@ hop routines we 've ever had on this show . " In slight disagreement , the Wall Street Journal noted that " Outta Your Mind " may in fact be nominated for an Emmy , but it is unlikely to win because past winners have all been lyrical , very emotional routines . 
 On a later episode , Tabitha and Napoleon choreographed a lyrical hip @-@ hop routine to Alicia Keys debut single " Fallin ' . " Of the dance , judge Mia Michaels stated " That to me felt more real than any contemporary piece , honestly , because it came from such a raw raw space and place . That was absolutely unbelievable , and it was like watching a dance film . " Lythgoe stated that the dance reminded him of " Bleeding Love " and " No Air " from season four and added " Somehow Napoleon and Tabitha have this ability ... to put emotion into hip @-@ hop routines and it really is a real talent . " 
 The positive reviews continued through the rest of the season . Of Tabitha and Napoleon 's " Scars " routine about angry clowns , Lythgoe called the piece " stunning " and Michaels described it as " hip @-@ hop theater " . After the episode aired , Dance Spirit magazine wrote " Tabitha and Napoleon are on FIRE this season ! " The Los Angeles Times echoed this comment stating that season seven had been " Nappytabs ' best season " . On the Top 3 performance episode , after their " Power " routine danced by eventual champion Lauren <unk> and " All @-@ Star " tWitch , Michaels commented " Nappytabs what a season you have had , my God . It 's been like home run after home run after home run ... " . Shankman echoed this comment on the finale by calling Tabitha and Napoleon " the MVPs of the season " . Four of their routines — " Fallin ' " , " Scars " , " Battle for the Beat " , and " My Chick Bad " — were chosen as " Judges ' Favorite " during the season seven finale broadcast . Due to an injury sustained by Alex Wong , " Outta Your Mind " was not picked as a judge 's favorite . Instead , it was performed by tWitch and special guest Ellen DeGeneres as a tribute to Alex just before Lauren <unk> was declared the winner of season seven . 
 Season eight brought back mixed feedback . Early in the season , Tabitha and Napoleon choreographed a lyrical hip @-@ hop routine " Coming Home " about a veteran coming back to his wife after returning from his deployment . The routine generated positive while emotional responses causing both guest judge Debbie Reynolds and resident judge Mary Murphy to cry while giving feedback . The Star Ledger placed " Coming Home " at number three in its list of the top five routines performed during season eight . Tabitha and Napoleon choreographed another lyrical hip @-@ hop routine " I Got You " on the Top 16 performance episode . <unk> called the routine " dramatic and breathtaking " . The dance generated positive reviews from the judges causing them to spontaneously kiss one another in response to a kiss that was choreographed into the dance . On the Top 8 performance episode , Lady Gaga appeared as a guest judge in which three hip @-@ hop routines were performed . Although Tabitha and Napoleon choreographed two of them , she criticized their work while giving feedback on all three . She indirectly criticized them after a lyrical hip @-@ hop piece choreographed by Marty Kudelka in which she referred to the dance style as " dated " . Of the two routines they did choreograph , she criticized their use of props in both of them . A flower was used in the first routine " Take a Bow " about a cheating boyfriend asking for forgiveness . Several props including trash cans , rags , and brooms were used in the second routine " Bad Boys for Life " about waste management workers . Aside from disliking the props , she described their hip @-@ hop choreography for " Bad Boys for Life " as " contrived " . On the finale , " Coming Home " was not picked as a " Judges Favorite " but two other routines they choreographed , " I Got You " and " Break Ya Neck " , were chosen instead by judges Nigel Lythgoe and Lil ' C respectively . 
 = = = Make Your Move = = = 
 Make Your Move was released in South Korea on April 17 and the United States on April 18 . With the exception of a make @-@ out scene the choreography was generally praised among critics . The Washington Post stated " Although the bit of bedroom footwork was more laugh @-@ inducing than anything , some of the dancing really is spectacular . Scenes from the competing clubs include impressive choreography and gravity @-@ defying moves . " <unk> wrote " The dance teams and performances are enough to dominate the scenes , and definitely deserve a look . They bring forth the unique charm of watching a dance movie . " RogerEbert.com stated " ' Make Your Move ' rests on the success of its various dance sequences , not its plot . And the dancing here is exciting , innovative , and specific . Each ' number ' has a story behind it , a motivation , a different look and feel ... I could have lived without the choreographed ( literally ) foreplay scene , as they dance their way to the bed , but there are other dance sequences between the two where their chemistry vibrates off the screen . " The Hollywood Reporter said " The Romeo and Juliet @-@ inspired plotline basically serves as a framing device allowing the opportunity for a plethora of exuberant dance sequences that particularly show off Hough 's considerable talent .

 = Joseph Szigeti = 
 Joseph Szigeti ( Hungarian : Szigeti József , [ <unk> <unk> ] ; 5 September 1892 – 19 February 1973 ) was a Hungarian violinist . 
 Born into a musical family , he spent his early childhood in a small town in Transylvania . He quickly proved himself to be a child prodigy on the violin , and moved to Budapest with his father to study with the renowned pedagogue Jenő Hubay . After completing his studies with Hubay in his early teens , Szigeti began his international concert career . His performances at that time were primarily limited to salon @-@ style recitals and the more overtly virtuosic repertoire ; however , after making the acquaintance of pianist Ferruccio Busoni , he began to develop a much more thoughtful and intellectual approach to music that eventually earned him the nickname " The Scholarly Virtuoso " . 
 Following a bout of tuberculosis that required a stay in a sanatorium in Switzerland , Szigeti settled in Geneva , where he became Professor of Violin at the local conservatory in 1917 . It was in Geneva that he met his future wife , Wanda Ostrowska , and at roughly the same time he became friends with the composer Béla Bartók . Both relationships were to be lifelong . 
 From the 1920s until 1960 , Szigeti performed regularly around the world and recorded extensively . He also distinguished himself as a strong advocate of new music , and was the dedicatee of many new works by contemporary composers . Among the more notable pieces written for him are Ernest Bloch 's Violin Concerto , Bartók 's Rhapsody No. 1 , and Eugène Ysaÿe 's Solo Sonata No. 1 . After retiring from the concert stage in 1960 , he worked at teaching and writing until his death in 1973 , at the age of 80 .

 = = = Early life = = = 
 Szigeti was born Joseph " <unk> " Singer to a Jewish family in Budapest , Austria @-@ Hungary . His mother died when he was three years old , and soon thereafter the boy was sent to live with his grandparents in the little Carpathian town of <unk> @-@ Sziget ( hence the name Szigeti ) . He grew up surrounded by music , as the town band was composed almost entirely of his uncles . After a few informal lessons on the cimbalom from his aunt , he received his first lessons on the violin from his Uncle Bernat at the age of six . 
 Szigeti quickly showed a talent for the violin . Several years later , his father took him to Budapest to receive proper training at the conservatory . After a brief stint with an inadequate teacher , Szigeti auditioned at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music and was admitted directly into the class of Jenő Hubay , without the usual delays and formalities . 
 Hubay , who had been a student of Joseph Joachim in Berlin , had by that time established himself as one of the preeminent teachers in Europe and a fountainhead of the Hungarian violin tradition . Szigeti joined such violinists as Franz von Vecsey , Emil Telmányi , Jelly d <unk> and <unk> Geyer in Hubay ’ s studio . 
 In those days , Europe produced a great many child prodigies , inspired by the phenomenal success of the young Czech virtuoso Jan Kubelík and formed by rigorous teaching and enthusiastic parents . The Hubay studio was no exception ; Szigeti and his fellow <unk> performed extensively in special recitals and salon concerts during their study at the Liszt Academy . 
 In 1905 , at the age of thirteen , Szigeti made his Berlin debut playing Bach 's Chaconne in D minor , Ernst 's Concerto in F @-@ sharp minor , and Paganini 's Witches Dance . Despite the formidable program , the event received mention only by a photograph in the Sunday supplement of the Berliner Tageblatt captioned : " A Musical Prodigy : Josef Szigeti " . 
 Szigeti spent the next few months with a summer theater company in a small Hungarian resort town , playing mini @-@ recitals in between acts of folk operetta . In that same vein , the next year he played at a circus in Frankfurt , where he appeared under the pseudonym " <unk> <unk> " . Also in 1906 , Hubay took Szigeti to play for Joseph Joachim in Berlin . Joachim was impressed , and suggested that Szigeti should finish his studies with him . Szigeti declined the offer , both out of loyalty to Hubay and a perceived aloofness and lack of rapport between Joachim and his students . 
 = = = <unk> horizons = = = 
 Soon after the meeting with Joachim , Szigeti embarked on a major concert tour of England . Midway through the tour , in Surrey , he met a music @-@ loving couple who effectively adopted him , extending an invitation to stay with them for an indefinite length of time . 
 Throughout England , he gave many successful concerts , including the premiere of the first work dedicated to him : Hamilton Harty 's Violin Concerto . Also during this time , Szigeti toured with an all @-@ star ensemble including legendary singer Dame Nellie Melba and pianists Ferruccio Busoni and Wilhelm Backhaus . Philippe <unk> , a famous French flutist of the day , as well as the young singer John McCormack , were also part of these tours . 
 The most significant of the new contacts was Busoni . The great pianist and composer became Szigeti 's mentor during these formative years , and the two would remain close friends until Busoni 's death in 1924 . By Szigeti 's own admission , before meeting Busoni his life was characterized by a certain laziness and indifference brought on by the then @-@ typical life of a young prodigy violinist . He had grown accustomed to playing crowd @-@ pleasing salon miniatures and dazzling virtuosic encores without much thought . He knew little of the works of the great masters ; he could play them , but not fully understand them . As Szigeti put it , Busoni — particularly through their careful study of Bach 's Chaconne — " shook me once and for all out of my adolescent complacency " .

 In 1913 , Szigeti was diagnosed with tuberculosis and was sent to a sanatorium in Davos , Switzerland to recover , interrupting his concert career . During his stay at the sanatorium , he became re @-@ acquainted with the composer Béla Bartók , who was recovering from pneumonia . The two had known each other only in passing during their conservatory days , but now they began a friendship that would last until Bartók ’ s death in 1945 . 
 In 1917 , having by then made a full recovery , at age 25 Szigeti was appointed Professor of Violin at the Geneva Conservatory of Music . Szigeti said that this job , although generally satisfying , was often frustrating due to the mediocre quality of many of his students . The years teaching in Geneva provided an opportunity for Szigeti to deepen his understanding of music as an art , along with other aspects such as chamber music , orchestral performance , music theory and composition . Also during that time , Szigeti met and fell in love with Wanda Ostrowska , a young woman of Russian parentage who had been stranded in Geneva by the Russian Revolution of 1917 . They married in 1919 .

 In 1925 , Szigeti met Leopold Stokowski and played the Bach Chaconne in D minor for him . Less than two weeks later , Szigeti received a telegram from Stokowski ’ s manager in Philadelphia inviting him to perform with the Philadelphia Orchestra later that year : it was his American debut . Szigeti had never played with an American orchestra before , nor heard one , and later he wrote of suffering stage fright . He was taken aback by the American concert scene , and the way that its publicity and popularity driven agents and managers determined much of what was heard in American concert halls . He believed they were not interested in works by the great masters , but preferred the popular light salon pieces he had left behind in his prodigy days . ( To the end of his life , Szigeti loved to quote one memorable , cigar @-@ chewing impresario who told him , with regard to Beethoven 's Kreutzer Sonata , " Well , let me tell you , Mister <unk> — and I know what I ’ m talking about — your <unk> Sonata bores the pants off my audiences ! " )

 By 1930 , Szigeti was established as a major international concert violinist . He performed extensively in Europe , the United States and Asia , and made the acquaintance of many of the era ’ s leading instrumentalists , conductors and composers . 
 In 1939 , to escape the war and Nazi persecution of the Jews , Szigeti emigrated with his wife to the United States , where they settled in California . ( A year later , Bartók also fled to America , and just two days after his arrival , he and Szigeti played a sonata recital at the Library of Congress in Washington , D.C. ) 
 During the 1930s , 1940s and into the 1950s , Szigeti recorded extensively , leaving a significant legacy . Notable recordings include the above @-@ mentioned Library of Congress sonata recital ; the studio recording of Bartók 's Contrasts with Benny Goodman on clarinet and the composer at the piano ; the violin concertos of Beethoven , Brahms , Mendelssohn , Prokofiev ( No. 1 ) and Bloch under the batons of such conductors as Bruno Walter , Hamilton Harty and Sir Thomas Beecham ; and various works by J.S. Bach , Busoni , Corelli , Handel and Mozart . One of his last recordings was of the Six Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin by Bach ; although his technique had deteriorated noticeably by that time , the recording is prized for Szigeti 's insight and depth of interpretation . 
 In 1950 , Szigeti was detained at Ellis Island upon returning from a European concert tour and was held for several days , officially " temporarily excluded " from the country . The reasons for his detention remain unclear . The following year , he became a naturalized American citizen . 
 = = = Later years = = = 
 During the 1950s , Szigeti began to develop arthritis in his hands and his playing deteriorated . Despite his weakened technical mastery , his intellect and musical expression were still strong , and he continued to draw large audiences to his concerts . In Naples , Italy , in November 1956 , just after the Soviets crushed the Hungarian uprising , as soon as he walked onto the stage the audience burst into wild applause and shouts of Viva l ’ <unk> ! ( Italian for " Long live Hungary ! " ) , delaying the concert for nearly fifteen minutes . 
 In 1960 Szigeti officially retired from performing , and returned to Switzerland with his wife . There he devoted himself primarily to teaching , although he still traveled regularly to judge international violin competitions . Top @-@ class students from all over Europe and the United States came to study under him . One of these students was Arnold Steinhardt , who spent the summer of 1962 with Szigeti . He came to the conclusion that " Joseph Szigeti was a template for the musician I would like to become : inquisitive , innovative , sensitive , feeling , informed " . 
 Toward the end of his life , Szigeti suffered from frail health . He was put on strict diets and had several stays in hospital , but his friends asserted that this did nothing to dampen his characteristic cheerfulness . He died in Lucerne , Switzerland on February 19 , 1973 , at the age of 80 . The New York Times ran a front @-@ page obituary that ended with this 1966 quote from violinist Yehudi Menuhin : 
 We must be humbly grateful that the breed of cultured and chivalrous violin virtuosos , aristocrats as human beings and as musicians , has survived into our hostile age in the person of Joseph Szigeti . 
 = = Family life = = 
 In 1918 , while teaching in Geneva , Szigeti met and fell in love with Wanda Ostrowska . She was born in Russia and had been stranded by the Russian Revolution of 1917 with her sister at a finishing school in Geneva . In 1919 , Szigeti and Ostrowska decided to get married , but due to the turbulent political situation in Europe , many unexpected bureaucratic obstacles were thrown up in their path . The first problem was the impossibility of contacting Ostrowska 's family , and the couple were forced to go ahead without parental consent , with the permission only of Ostrowska 's sister and the headmistress of the finishing school . Further bureaucratic entanglements threatened the young couple 's hopes , but eventually the officials responsible granted them a dispensation to marry . Szigeti recalls in his memoirs the words of Consul General Baron de <unk> at the critical moment : 
 Let us not , if we can avoid it , fall victim to the dead letter of the law . I don 't want to postpone the happiness of these two youngsters if we can help it . All laws have been twisted and tortured out of semblance of law , what with war and revolutions . For once let 's twist and turn one for a good cause , yes ?
