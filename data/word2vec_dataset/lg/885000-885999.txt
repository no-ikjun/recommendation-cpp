 Khmer differs from neighboring languages such as Thai , Burmese , Lao and Vietnamese in that it is not a tonal language . Words are stressed on the final syllable , hence many words conform to the typical Mon – Khmer pattern of a stressed syllable preceded by a minor syllable . The language has been written in the Khmer script , an <unk> descended from the Brahmi script via the southern Indian Pallava script , since at least the seventh century . The script 's form and use has evolved over the centuries ; its modern features include subscripted versions of consonants used to write clusters and a division of consonants into two series with different inherent vowels . Approximately 79 % of Cambodians are able to read Khmer . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Khmer is a member of the Austroasiatic language family , the autochthonous family in an area that stretches from the Malay Peninsula through Southeast Asia to East India . Austroasiatic , which also includes Mon , Vietnamese and Munda , has been studied since 1856 and was first proposed as a language family in 1907 . Despite the amount of research , there is still doubt about the internal relationship of the languages of Austroasiatic . <unk> places Khmer in an eastern branch of the Mon @-@ Khmer languages . In these classification schemes Khmer 's closest genetic relatives are the <unk> and <unk> languages . More recent classifications doubt the validity of the Mon @-@ Khmer sub @-@ grouping and place the Khmer language as its own branch of Austroasiatic equidistant from the other 12 branches of the family . 
 = = Geographic distribution and dialects = = 
 Khmer is spoken by some 13 million people in Cambodia , where it is the official language . It is also a second language for most of the minority groups and indigenous hill tribes there . Additionally there are a million speakers of Khmer native to southern Vietnam ( 1999 census ) and 1 @.@ 4 million in northeast Thailand ( 2006 ) . 
 Khmer dialects , although mutually intelligible , are sometimes quite marked . Notable variations are found in speakers from Phnom Penh ( Cambodia 's capital city ) , the rural Battambang area , the areas of Northeast Thailand adjacent to Cambodia such as Surin province , the Cardamom Mountains , and southern Vietnam . The dialects form a continuum running roughly north to south . Standard Cambodian Khmer is mutually intelligible with the others but a Khmer Krom speaker from Vietnam , for instance , may have great difficulty communicating with a Khmer native to <unk> Province in Thailand . 
 The following is a classification scheme showing the development of the modern Khmer dialects . 
 Middle Khmer 
 Cardamom ( Western ) Khmer 
 Central Khmer 
 Surin ( Northern ) Khmer 
 Standard Khmer and related dialects ( including Khmer Krom ) 
 Standard Khmer , or Central Khmer , the language as taught in Cambodian schools and used by the media , is based on the dialect spoken throughout the Central Plain , a region encompassed by the northwest and central provinces . 
 Northern Khmer ( called Khmer Surin in Khmer ) refers to the dialects spoken by many in several border provinces of present @-@ day northeast Thailand . After the fall of the Khmer Empire in the early 15th century , the <unk> Mountains served as a natural border leaving the Khmer north of the mountains under the sphere of influence of the Kingdom of Lan Xang . The conquests of Cambodia by <unk> the Great for Ayutthaya furthered their political and economic isolation from Cambodia proper , leading to a dialect that developed relatively independently from the midpoint of the Middle Khmer period . This has resulted in a distinct accent influenced by the surrounding tonal languages Lao and Thai , lexical differences , and phonemic differences in both vowels and distribution of consonants . Syllable @-@ final / r / , which has become silent in other dialects of Khmer , is still pronounced in Northern Khmer . Some linguists classify Northern Khmer as a separate but closely related language rather than a dialect . 
 Western Khmer , also called Cardamom Khmer or <unk> Khmer , is spoken by a very small , isolated population in the Cardamom mountain range extending from western Cambodia into eastern Central Thailand . Although little studied , this variety is unique in that it maintains a definite system of vocal register that has all but disappeared in other dialects of modern Khmer . 
 Phnom Penh Khmer is spoken in the capital and surrounding areas . This dialect is characterized by merging or complete elision of syllables , considered by speakers from other regions to be a " relaxed " pronunciation . For instance , " Phnom Penh " will sometimes be shortened to " m <unk> " . Another characteristic of Phnom Penh speech is observed in words with an " r " either as an initial consonant or as the second member of a consonant cluster ( as in the English word " bread " ) . The " r " , trilled or flapped in other dialects , is either pronounced as a uvular trill or not pronounced at all . This alters the quality of any preceding consonant , causing a harder , more emphasized pronunciation . Another unique result is that the syllable is spoken with a low @-@ rising or " dipping " tone much like the " <unk> " tone in Vietnamese . For example , some people pronounce / <unk> / ( ' fish ' ) as [ <unk> ] : the / r / is dropped and the vowel begins by dipping much lower in tone than standard speech and then rises , effectively doubling its length . Another example is the word / <unk> / ( ' study ' ) , which is pronounced [ <unk> ] , with the uvular " r " and the same intonation described above . 
 Khmer Krom or Southern Khmer is spoken by the indigenous Khmer population of the Mekong Delta , formerly controlled by the Khmer Empire but part of Vietnam since 1698 . Khmers are persecuted by the Vietnamese government for using their native language and , since the 1950s , have been forced to take Vietnamese names . Consequently , very little research has been published regarding this dialect . It has been generally influenced by Vietnamese for three centuries and accordingly displays a pronounced accent , tendency toward <unk> words and lexical differences from Standard Khmer . 
 Khmer Khe is spoken in the Se San , Srepok and <unk> river valleys of <unk> and Siem Pang districts in Stung Treng Province . Following the decline of Angkor , the Khmer abandoned their northern territories which were then settled by the Lao . In the 17th century , Chey <unk> XI led a Khmer force into Stung Treng to retake the area . The Khmer Khe living in this area of Stung Treng in modern times are presumed to be the descendants of this group . Their dialect is thought to resemble that of pre @-@ modern Siem Reap . 
 = = Historical periods = = 
 Linguistic study of the Khmer language divides its history into four periods one of which , the Old Khmer period , is subdivided into pre @-@ Angkorian and Angkorian . Pre @-@ Angkorian Khmer , the Old Khmer language from 600 CE through 800 , is only known from words and phrases in Sanskrit texts of the era . Old Khmer ( or Angkorian Khmer ) is the language as it was spoken in the Khmer Empire from the 9th century until the weakening of the empire sometime in the 13th century . Old Khmer is attested by many primary sources and has been studied in depth by a few scholars , most notably <unk> <unk> , Phillip Jenner and Heinz @-@ Jürgen <unk> . Following the end of the Khmer Empire the language lost the standardizing influence of being the language of government and accordingly underwent a turbulent period of change in morphology , phonology and lexicon . The language of this transition period , from about the 14th to 18th centuries , is referred to as Middle Khmer and saw borrowing from Thai , Lao and , to a lesser extent , Vietnamese . The changes during this period are so profound that the rules of Modern Khmer can not be applied to correctly understand Old Khmer . The language became recognizable as Modern Khmer , spoken from the 19th century till today . 
 The following table shows the conventionally accepted historical stages of Khmer . 
 Just as modern Khmer was emerging from the transitional period represented by Middle Khmer , Cambodia fell under the influence of French colonialism . Thailand , which had for centuries claimed suzerainty over Cambodia and controlled succession to the Cambodian throne , began losing its influence on the language . In 1887 Cambodia was fully integrated into French Indochina which brought in a French @-@ speaking aristocracy . This led to French becoming the language of higher education and the intellectual class . By 1907 , the French had wrested over half of modern @-@ day Cambodia , including the north and northwest where Thai had been the prestige language , from back Thai control and reintegrated it into the country . 
 Many native scholars in the early 20th century , led by a monk named <unk> Nath , resisted the French and Thai influences on their language . Forming the government sponsored Cultural Committee to define and standardize the modern language , they championed Khmerization , purging of foreign elements , reviving affixation , and the use of Old Khmer roots and historical Pali and Sanskrit to coin new words for modern ideas . Opponents , led by Keng <unk> , who embraced " total Khmerization " by denouncing the reversion to classical languages and favoring the use of contemporary colloquial Khmer for neologisms , and <unk> <unk> , who favored borrowing from Thai , were also influential . <unk> later joined the Cultural Committee and supported Nath . Nath 's views and prolific work won out and he is credited with cultivating modern Khmer @-@ language identity and culture , overseeing the translation of the entire Pali Buddhist canon into Khmer . He also created the modern Khmer language dictionary that is still in use today , thereby ensuring that Khmer would survive , and indeed flourish , during the French colonial period . 
 = = Phonology = = 
 The phonological system described here is the inventory of sounds of the standard spoken language , represented using appropriate symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet ( IPA ) . 
 = = = Consonants = = = 
 The voiceless plosives / p / , / t / , / c / , / k / may occur with or without aspiration ( as [ p ] vs. [ pʰ ] , etc . ) ; this difference is contrastive before a vowel . However , the aspirated sounds in that position may be analyzed as sequences of two phonemes : / ph / , / th / , / ch / , / kh / . This analysis is supported by the fact that infixes can be inserted between the stop and the aspiration ; for example [ <unk> ] ( ' big ' ) becomes [ <unk> ] ( ' size ' ) with a <unk> infix . When one of these plosives occurs initially before another consonant , aspiration is no longer contrastive and can be regarded as mere phonetic detail : slight aspiration is expected when the following consonant is not one of / ʔ / , / b / , / d / , / r / , / s / , / h / ( or / ŋ / if the initial plosive is / k / ) . 
 The voiced plosives are pronounced as implosives [ ɓ , ɗ ] by most speakers , but this feature is weak in educated speech , where they become [ b , d ] . 
 In syllable @-@ final position , / h / and / ʋ / approach [ ç ] and [ w ] respectively . The stops / p / , / t / , / c / , / k / are unaspirated and have no audible release when occurring as syllable finals . 
 In addition , the consonants / ɡ / , / f / , / ʃ / and / z / occur occasionally in recent loan words in the speech of Cambodians familiar with French and other languages . 
 = = = Vowels = = = 
 Various authors have proposed slightly different analyses of the Khmer vowel system . This may be in part because of the wide degree of variation in pronunciation between individual speakers , even within a dialectal region . The description below follows Huffman ( 1970 ) . The number of vowel nuclei and their values vary between dialects ; differences exist even between the Standard Khmer system and that of the Battambang dialect on which the standard is based . 
 In addition , there are diphthongs and <unk> which are analyzed as a vowel nucleus plus a semivowel ( / j / or / w / ) coda because they can not be followed by a final consonant . These include : ( with short monophthongs ) / <unk> / , / <unk> / , / aj / , / aw / , / <unk> / ; ( with long monophthongs ) / <unk> / , / <unk> / ; ( with long diphthongs ) / <unk> / , / <unk> / , / <unk> / , / <unk> / , / <unk> / and / <unk> / . 
 = = = Syllable structure = = = 
 A Khmer syllable begins with a single consonant , or else with a cluster of two , or rarely three , consonants . The only possible clusters of three consonants at the start of a syllable are / <unk> / , / <unk> / , and ( with aspirated consonants analyzed as two @-@ consonant sequences ) / <unk> / , / <unk> / . There are 85 possible two @-@ consonant clusters ( including [ pʰ ] etc. analyzed as / ph / etc . ) . All the clusters are shown in the following table , phonetically , i.e. superscript ʰ can mark either contrastive or non @-@ contrastive aspiration ( see above ) . 
 Slight vowel epenthesis occurs in the clusters consisting of a plosive followed by / ʔ / , / b / , / d / , in those beginning / ʔ / , / m / , / l / , and in the cluster / <unk> / . 
 After the initial consonant or consonant cluster comes the syllabic nucleus , which is one of the vowels listed above . This vowel may end the syllable or may be followed by a coda , which is a single consonant . If the syllable is stressed and the vowel is short , there must be a final consonant . All consonant sounds except / b / , / d / , / r / , / s / and the <unk> can appear as the coda ( although final / r / is heard in some dialects , most notably in Northern Khmer ) . 
 A minor syllable ( unstressed syllable preceding the main syllable of a word ) has a structure of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ( where C is a consonant , V a vowel , and N a nasal consonant ) . The vowels in such syllables are usually short ; in conversation they may be reduced to [ ə ] , although in careful or formal speech , including on television and radio , they are clearly articulated . An example of such a word is <unk> ្ <unk> ( ' person ' ) , pronounced [ <unk> ] , or more casually [ <unk> ] . 
 = = = Stress = = = 
 Stress in Khmer falls on the final syllable of a word . Because of this predictable pattern , stress is non @-@ phonemic in Khmer ( it does not distinguish different meanings ) . 
 Most Khmer words consist of either one or two syllables . In most native disyllabic words , the first syllable is a minor ( fully unstressed ) syllable . Such words have been described as <unk> ( i.e. as having one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half syllables ) . There are also some disyllabic words in which the first syllable does not behave as a minor syllable , but takes secondary stress . Most such words are compounds , but some are single morphemes ( generally loanwords ) . An example is <unk> ( ' language ' ) , pronounced [ <unk> ] . 
 Words with three or more syllables , if they are not compounds , are mostly loanwords , usually derived from Pali , Sanskrit , or more recently , French . They are nonetheless adapted to Khmer stress patterns . Primary stress falls on the final syllable , with secondary stress on every second syllable from the end . Thus in a three @-@ syllable word , the first syllable has secondary stress ; in a four @-@ syllable word , the second syllable has secondary stress ; in a five @-@ syllable word , the first and third syllables have secondary stress , and so on . Long <unk> are not often used in conversation . 
 Compounds , however , preserve the stress patterns of the constituent words . Thus <unk> , the name of a kind of cookie ( literally ' bird 's nest ' ) , is pronounced [ <unk> <unk> ] , with secondary stress on the second rather than the first syllable , because it is composed of the words [ <unk> ] ( ' nest ' ) and [ <unk> ] ( ' bird ' ) . 
 = = = <unk> and tone = = = 
 Khmer once had a phonation distinction in its vowels , but this now survives only in the most archaic dialect ( Western Khmer ) . The distinction arose historically when vowels after Old Khmer voiced consonants became breathy voiced and diphthongized ; for example * kaa , * <unk> became * kaa , * <unk> ̤ a . When consonant voicing was lost , the distinction was maintained by the vowel ( * kaa , * ke ̤ a ) ; later the phonation disappeared as well ( [ <unk> ] , [ <unk> ] ) . These processes explain the origin of what are now called a @-@ series and o @-@ series consonants in the Khmer script . 
 Although most Cambodian dialects are not tonal , colloquial Phnom Penh dialect has developed a tonal contrast ( level versus peaking tone ) to compensate for the elision of / r / . 
 = = = Intonation = = = 
 Intonation often conveys semantic context in Khmer , as in distinguishing declarative statements , questions and exclamations . The available grammatical means of making such distinctions are not always used , or may be ambiguous ; for example , the final interrogative particle <unk> / teː / can also serve as an emphasizing ( or in some cases negating ) particle . 
 The intonation pattern of a typical Khmer declarative phrase is a steady rise throughout followed by an abrupt drop on the last syllable . 
 <unk> ្ <unk> ់ <unk> [ ↗ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> | <unk> teː ] ( ' I don 't want it ' ) 
 Other intonation contours signify a different type of phrase such as the " full doubt " interrogative , similar to yes @-@ no questions in English . Full doubt interrogatives remain fairly even in tone throughout , but rise sharply towards the end . 
 <unk> ្ <unk> ់ <unk> [ ↗ <unk> ? <unk> | ↗ tɨw <unk> <unk> <unk> | <unk> ] ( ' do you want to go to Siem Reap ? ' ) 
 <unk> phrases follow the typical steadily rising pattern , but rise sharply on the last syllable instead of falling . 
 <unk> ្ <unk> ់ [ ↗ <unk> <unk> <unk> | ↗ <unk> | <unk> ] ( ' this book is expensive ! ' ) 
 = = Grammar = = 
 Khmer is primarily an analytic language with no inflection . <unk> relations are mainly determined by word order . Old and Middle Khmer used particles to mark grammatical categories and many of these have survived in Modern Khmer but are used sparingly , mostly in literary or formal language . Khmer makes extensive use of auxiliary verbs , " <unk> " and serial verb construction . Colloquial Khmer is a zero copula language , instead preferring predicative adjectives ( and even predicative nouns ) unless using a copula for emphasis or to avoid ambiguity in more complex sentences . Basic word order is subject – verb – object ( SVO ) , although subjects are often dropped ; prepositions are used rather than postpositions . Topic @-@ Comment constructions are common and the language is generally head @-@ initial ( modifiers follow the words they modify ) . Some grammatical process are still not fully understood by western scholars . For example , it 's not clear if certain features of Khmer grammar , such as actor <unk> , should be treated as a morphological process or a purely syntactic device , and some derivational morphology seems to be " purely decorative " and performs no known syntactic work . 
 Lexical categories have been hard to define in Khmer . Henri Maspero , an early scholar of Khmer , claimed the language had no parts of speech , while a later scholar , Judith Jacob , posited four parts of speech and innumerable particles . John <unk> , on the other hand , identifies " a couple dozen " parts of speech in Khmer with the caveat that Khmer words have the freedom to perform a variety of syntactic functions depending on such factors as word order , relevant particles , location within a clause , intonation and context . Some of the more important lexical categories and their function are demonstrated in the following example sentence taken from a hospital brochure : 
 = = = Morphology = = = 
 Modern Khmer is an isolating language which means that it uses little productive morphology . There is some derivation by means of prefixes and infixes , but this is a remnant of Old Khmer not always productive in the modern language . Khmer morphology is evidence of a historical process through which the language was , at some point in the past , changed from being an agglutinative language to adopting an isolating typology . <unk> forms are <unk> and cannot be used productively to form new words . Below are some of the most common affixes with examples as given by Huffman . 
 Compounding in Khmer is a common derivational process that takes two forms , coordinate compounds and repetitive compounds . Coordinate compounds join two unbound morphemes ( independent words ) of similar meaning to form a compound signifying a concept more general than either word alone . Coordinate compounds join either two nouns or two verbs . Repetitive compounds , one of the most productive derivational features of Khmer , use reduplication of an entire word to derive words whose meaning will depend on the class of the reduplicated word . A repetitive compound of a noun indicates plurality or generality while that of an adjectival verb could mean either an intensification or plurality . 
 Coordinate compounds : 
 Repetitive compounds : 
 = = = = Nouns and pronouns = = = = 
 Khmer nouns do not inflect for grammatical gender or singular / plural . There are no articles , but indefiniteness is often expressed by the word for " one " ( <unk> , / <unk> / ) following the noun as in <unk> ្ <unk> ( / <unk> <unk> / " a dog " ) . Plurality can be marked by postnominal particles , numerals , or reduplication of a following adjective , which , although similar to intensification , is usually not ambiguous due to context . 
 Classifying particles are used after numerals , but are not always obligatory as they are in Thai or Chinese , for example , and are often dropped in colloquial speech . Khmer nouns are divided into two groups : mass nouns , those which take classifiers , and specific nouns , which do not . The overwhelming majority are mass nouns . 
 Possession is colloquially expressed by word order . The possessor is placed after that which is possessed . Alternatively , in more complex sentences or when emphasis is required , a possessive construction using the word <unk> ់ ( / <unk> / ~ / <unk> / , " property , object " ) may be employed . In formal and literary contexts , the possessive particle <unk> ( <unk> ) is used : 
 Pronouns are subject to a complicated system of social register , the choice of pronoun depending on the perceived relationships between speaker , audience and referent ( see Social registers below ) . Kinship terms , nicknames and proper names are often used as pronouns ( including for the first person ) among intimates . Subject pronouns are frequently dropped in colloquial conversation . 
 Adjectives , verbs and verb phrases may be made into nouns by the use of <unk> particles . Three of the more common particles used to create nouns are / <unk> / , / sec <unk> / , and / <unk> / . These particles are prefixed most often to verbs in order to form abstract nouns . The latter , derived from Sanskrit , also occurs as a suffix in fixed forms borrowed from Sanskrit and Pali such as / <unk> / ( " health " ) from / sok / ( " to be healthy " ) . 
 = = = = Adjectives and adverbs = = = = 
 Adjectives , demonstratives and numerals follow the noun they modify . Adverbs likewise follow the verb . Morphologically , adjectives and adverbs are not distinguished , with many words often serving either function . Adjectives are also employed as verbs as Khmer sentences rarely use a copula . 
 Degrees of comparison are constructed syntactically . <unk> are expressed using the word <unk> / ciəŋ / : " A X / ciəŋ / [ B ] " ( A is more X [ than B ] ) . The most common way to express superlatives is with <unk> / ciəŋ <unk> / : " A X / ciəŋ <unk> / " ( A is the most X ) . Intensity is also expressed syntactically , similar to other languages of the region , by reduplication or with the use of <unk> . 
 = = = = Verbs = = = = 
 As is typical of most East Asian languages , Khmer verbs do not inflect at all ; tense , aspect and mood can be expressed using auxiliary verbs , particles ( such as <unk> / <unk> / , placed before a verb to express continuous aspect ) and adverbs ( such as " yesterday " , " earlier " , " tomorrow " ) , or may be understood from context . Serial verb construction is quite common . 
 Khmer verbs are a relatively open class and can be divided into two types , main verbs and auxiliary verbs . Huffman defined a Khmer verb as " any word that can be ( negated ) " , and further divided main verbs into three classes . 
 Transitive verbs are verbs which may be followed by a direct object : 
 Intransitive verbs are verbs which can not be followed by an object : 
 <unk> verbs are a word class that has no equivalent in English . When modifying a noun or verb , they function as adjectives or adverbs , respectively , but they may also be used as main verbs equivalent to English " be + adjective " . 
 = = = Syntax = = = 
 Syntax is the rules and processes that describe how sentences are formed in a particular language , how words relate to each other within clauses or phrases and how those phrases relate to each other within a sentence to convey meaning . Khmer syntax is very analytic . Relationships between words and phrases are signified primarily by word order supplemented with auxiliary verbs and , particularly in formal and literary registers , grammatical marking particles . Grammatical phenomena such as negation and aspect are marked by particles while interrogative sentences are marked either by particles or interrogative words equivalent to English " wh @-@ words " . 
 A complete Khmer sentence consists of four basic elements which include an optional topic , an optional subject , an obligatory predicate and various adverbials and particles . The topic and subject are noun phrases , predicates are verb phrases and another noun phrase acting as an object or verbal attribute often follows the predicate . 
 = = = = Basic constituent order = = = = 
 When combining these noun and verb phrases into a sentence the order is typically SVO : 
 When both a direct object and indirect object are present without any grammatical markers , the preferred order is SV ( DO ) ( IO ) . In such a case , if the direct object phrase contains multiple components , the indirect object immediately follows the noun of the direct object phrase and the direct object 's modifiers follow the indirect object : 
 This ordering of objects can be changed and the meaning clarified with the inclusion of particles . The word / <unk> / , which normally means " to arrive " or " towards " , can be used as a preposition meaning " to " : 
 Alternatively , the indirect object could precede the direct object if the object marking preposition / <unk> / were used : 
 However , in spoken discourse OSV is possible when emphasizing the object in a topic @-@ comment @-@ like structure . 
 = = = = Noun phrase = = = = 
 The noun phrase in Khmer typically has the following structure : 
 Noun Phrase = ( <unk> ) Noun ( <unk> modifiers ) ( Numeral ) ( Classifier ) ( Demonstrative ) 
 The elements in parentheses are optional . <unk> are a class of words that serve to index the social status of the referent . <unk> can be kinship terms or personal names , both of which are often used as first and second person pronouns , or specialized words such as / <unk> / ( ' god ' ) before royal and religious objects . The most common demonstratives are / <unk> / ( ' this , these ' ) and / <unk> / ( ' that , those ' ) . The word / ae <unk> / ( ' those over there ' ) has a more distal or vague connotation . If the noun phrase contains a possessive adjective , it follows the noun and precedes the numeral . If a descriptive attribute co @-@ occurs with a possessive , the possessive construction ( / <unk> / ) is expected . 
 Some examples of typical Khmer noun phrases are : 
 The Khmer particle / <unk> / marked attributes in Old Khmer noun phrases and is used in formal and literary language to signify that what precedes is the noun and what follows is the attribute . Modern usage may carry the connotation of mild intensity . 
 = = = = Verb phrase = = = = 
 Khmer verbs are completely <unk> , and once a subject or topic has been introduced or is clear from context the noun phrase may be dropped . Thus , the simplest possible sentence in Khmer consists of a single verb . For example , / tɨw / can mean " I 'm going . " , " He went . " , " They 've gone . " , " Let 's go . " , etc . This also results in long strings of verbs such as : 
 Khmer uses three verbs for what translates into English as the copula . The general copula is / <unk> / ; it is used to convey identity with nominal predicates . For locative predicates , the copula is / <unk> / . The verb / <unk> / is the " existential " copula meaning " there is " or " there exists " . 
 Negation is achieved by putting <unk> / <unk> / before the verb and the particle <unk> / teː / at the end of the sentence or clause . In colloquial speech , verbs can also be negated without the need for a final particle , by placing <unk> / <unk> / ~ / <unk> / before them . 
 Past tense can be conveyed by adverbs , such as " yesterday " or by the use of perfective particles such as / <unk> / 
 Different senses of future action can also be expressed by the use of adverbs like " tomorrow " or by the future tense marker / <unk> / , which is placed immediately before the verb , or both : 
 Imperatives are often unmarked . For example , in addition to the meanings given above , the " sentence " / tɨw / can also mean " Go ! " . Various words and particles may be added to the verb to soften the command to varying degrees , including to the point of politeness ( <unk> ) : 
 <unk> take the form " / kom / + V " and also are often softened by the addition of the particle / <unk> / to the end of the phrase . 
 = = = = Questions = = = = 
 There are three basic types of questions in Khmer . Questions requesting specific information use question words . Polar questions are indicated with interrogative particles , most commonly / teː / a homonym of the negation particle . Tag questions are indicated with various particles and rising inflection . The SVO word order is generally not inverted for questions . 
 In more formal contexts and in polite speech , questions are also marked at their beginning by the particle / <unk> / . 
 = = = = Passive voice = = = = 
 Khmer does not have a passive voice , but there is a construction utilizing the main verb / <unk> / ( " to hit " , " to be correct " , " to affect " ) as an auxiliary verb meaning " to be subject to " or " to undergo " which results in sentences that are translated to English using the passive voice . 
 = = = = Clause syntax = = = = 
 Complex sentences are formed in Khmer by the addition of one or more clauses to the main clause . The various types of clauses in Khmer include the coordinate clause , the relative clause and the subordinate clause . Word order in clauses is the same for that of the basic sentences described above . Coordinate clauses do not necessarily have to be marked ; they can simply follow one another . When explicitly marked , they are joined by words similar to English conjunctions such as / <unk> / ( " and " ) and / <unk> / ( " and then " ) or by clause @-@ final conjunction @-@ like adverbs / <unk> / and / <unk> / , both of which can mean " also " or " and also " ; disjunction is indicated by / <unk> / ( " or " ) . Relative clauses can be introduced by / deal / ( " that " ) but , similar to coordinate clauses , often simply follow the main clause . For example , both phrases below can mean " the hospital bed that has wheels " . 
 Relative clauses are more likely to be introduced with / deal / if they do not immediately follow the head noun . Khmer subordinate conjunctions always precede a subordinate clause . Subordinate conjunctions include words such as / <unk> / ( " because " ) , / hak <unk> / ( " seems as if " ) and / <unk> / ( " in order to " ) . 
 = = Numerals = = 
 Counting in Khmer is based on a <unk> system ( the numbers from 6 to 9 have the form " five one " , " five two " , etc . ) However , the words for multiples of ten from 30 to 90 are not related to the basic Khmer numbers , but are probably borrowed from Thai . The Khmer script has its own versions of the Arabic numerals . 
 The principal number words are listed in the following table , which gives Western and Khmer digits , Khmer spelling and IPA transcription . 
 Intermediate numbers are formed by compounding the above elements . Powers of ten are denoted by loan words : <unk> / <unk> / ( 100 ) , <unk> ់ / <unk> / ( 1 @,@ 000 ) , ម <unk> <unk> / <unk> / ( 10 @,@ 000 ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( 100 @,@ 000 ) and <unk> / <unk> / ( 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ) from Thai and <unk> / <unk> / ( 10 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ) from Sanskrit . 
 Ordinal numbers are formed by placing the particle <unk> / <unk> / before the corresponding cardinal number . 
 = = Social registers = = 
 Khmer employs a system of registers in which the speaker must always be conscious of the social status of the person spoken to . The different registers , which include those used for common speech , polite speech , speaking to or about royals and speaking to or about monks , employ alternate verbs , names of body parts and pronouns . This results in what appears to foreigners as separate languages and , in fact , isolated villagers often are unsure how to speak with royals and royals raised completely within the court do not feel comfortable speaking the common register . As an example , the word for " to eat " used between intimates or in reference to animals is / <unk> / . Used in polite reference to commoners , it is / <unk> / . When used of those of higher social status , it is / <unk> / or / <unk> <unk> / . For monks the word is / <unk> / and for royals , / <unk> / . Another result is that the pronominal system is complex and full of honorific variations , just a few of which are shown in the table below . 
 = = Writing system = = 
 Khmer is written with the Khmer script , an <unk> developed from the Pallava script of India before the 7th century when the first known inscription appeared . Written left @-@ to @-@ right with vowel signs that can be placed after , before , above or below the consonant they follow , the Khmer script is similar in appearance and usage to Thai and Lao , both of which were based on the Khmer system . The Khmer script is also distantly related to the Mon script , the ancestor of the modern Burmese script . Khmer numerals , which were inherited from Indian numerals , are used more widely than Hindu @-@ Arabic numerals . Within Cambodia , literacy in the Khmer alphabet is estimated at 77 @.@ 6 % . 
 Consonant symbols in Khmer are divided into two groups , or series . The first series carries the inherent vowel / ɑː / while the second series carries the inherent vowel / <unk> / . The Khmer names of the series , / <unk> / ( ' voiceless ' ) and / <unk> / ( ' voiced ' ) , respectively , indicate that the second series consonants were used to represent the voiced phonemes of Old Khmer . As the voicing of stops was lost , however , the contrast shifted to the phonation of the attached vowels which , in turn , evolved into a simple difference of vowel quality , often by diphthongization . This process has resulted in the Khmer alphabet having two symbols for most consonant phonemes and each vowel symbol having two possible readings , depending on the series of the initial consonant :

 Charles Kenneth Horne , generally known as Kenneth Horne , ( 27 February 1907 – 14 February 1969 ) was an English comedian and businessman . He is perhaps best remembered for his work on three BBC Radio series : Much @-@ Binding @-@ in @-@ the @-@ Marsh ( 1944 – 54 ) , Beyond Our Ken ( 1958 – 64 ) and Round the Horne ( 1965 – 68 ) . 
 The son of a clergyman who was also a politician , Horne had a burgeoning business career with Triplex Safety Glass , which was interrupted by service with the Royal Air Force during the Second World War . While serving in a barrage balloon unit he was asked to broadcast as a <unk> on the BBC radio show Ack @-@ Ack , Beer @-@ Beer . The experience brought him into contact with the more established entertainer Richard Murdoch , and the two wrote and starred in the comedy series Much @-@ Binding @-@ in @-@ the @-@ Marsh . After demobilisation Horne returned to his business career , and kept his broadcasting as a sideline . His career in industry flourished and he later became the chairman and managing director of toy manufacturers Chad Valley . 
 In 1958 Horne suffered a stroke and gave up his business dealings to focus on his entertainment work . He was the anchor figure in Beyond Our Ken , which also featured Kenneth Williams , Hugh Paddick , Betty Marsden and Bill Pertwee . When the programme came to an end in 1964 , the same cast recorded four series of the comedy Round the Horne . 
 Before the planned fifth series of Round the Horne began recording , Horne died of a heart attack while hosting the annual Guild of Television Producers ' and Directors ' Awards ; Round the Horne could not continue without him and was withdrawn . Since his death the series has been regularly re @-@ broadcast . A 2002 BBC radio survey to find listeners ' favourite British comedian placed Horne third , behind Tony Hancock and Spike Milligan .

 = = = Early life = = = 
 Kenneth Horne was born Charles Kenneth Horne on 27 February 1907 at Ampthill Square , London . He was the seventh and youngest child of Silvester Horne and his wife , Katherine Maria neé Cozens @-@ Hardy . Katherine 's father was Herbert Cozens @-@ Hardy , the Liberal MP for North Norfolk who became the Master of the Rolls in 1907 and Baron Cozens @-@ Hardy on 1 July 1914 . Silvester , a powerful orator , was a leading light in the Congregationalist movement , as minister at the Whitefield 's Tabernacle , Tottenham Court Road from 1903 and , from 1910 , chairman of the Congregational Union of England and Wales . Between 1910 – 14 he was the Liberal MP for Ipswich . 
 By 1913 Silvester was suffering from continual poor health . He resigned his position at the tabernacle on medical advice in January 1914 , and intended to resign his parliamentary seat . On a speaking tour of the US and Canada he lectured at Yale University , and then took the ferry to Toronto ; as it entered the harbour , he collapsed and died , aged 49 ; Horne was aged seven at the time . From September that year Horne attended St George 's School , Harpenden as a boarder — the seventh of the Horne children to attend the school . Although he was not strong academically , he developed into a good sportsman , representing the school in rugby and cricket , and during the summer holidays took part in the Public Schoolboys Lawn Tennis Championship at Queen 's Club ; in his final appearance in 1925 he was knocked out by the future Wimbledon finalist Bunny Austin . 
 Horne enrolled at the London School of Economics in October 1925 , where his tutors included Hugh Dalton and Stephen Leacock ; he was dissatisfied with his time at the university and called Leacock " one of the most boring lecturers I ever came across " . During the general strike in 1926 volunteers were asked to enlist at the Organisation for the Maintenance of Supplies to take over the essential services ; Horne joined and spent two days driving a London bus before the strike was called off . Through the influence and generosity of an uncle , Austin Pilkington of the Pilkington glassmaking family of St Helens , he was able to enrol at Magdalene College , Cambridge in October 1926 . He committed himself to the sporting side of life and represented the college at rugby , and in the relay team alongside the future Olympic gold medallist Lord Burghley . He also played tennis for the university , partnering Bunny Austin . Distracted by his athletic exploits , he neglected his studies and was sent down in December 1927 . 
 Austin Pilkington was aggrieved at Horne 's failure to make the most of the opportunity he had provided , and decided against offering the young man a post in the family firm . Despite the disappointment , through his contacts within the industry , he secured for the young Horne an interview with the Triplex Safety Glass Company at King 's Norton , a district of Birmingham . Horne 's sporting record commended him to the manager of the Triplex factory , and he was taken on as a management trainee on a modest salary . In September 1930 , despite his unimpressive finances , he married Lady Mary Pelham @-@ Clinton @-@ Hope , daughter of the 8th Duke of Newcastle . The marriage was happy at first , but had broken down by 1932 . Mary applied for an annulment in November 1932 ; she declared the reason was " the incapacity of the respondent [ Charles Kenneth Horne ] to consummate the marriage " , which was dissolved in 1933 , although the two remained on friendly terms thereafter . 
 When Horne 's first marriage was dissolved , he was sought out by a former girlfriend , Joan Burgess , daughter of a neighbour at King 's Norton . Unlike his first wife , she had much in common with him , including a liking for squash , tennis , golf and dancing . A month before her 21st birthday they were married , in September 1936 . Joan became pregnant soon after the wedding , and in July 1937 a baby boy was delivered ; he was stillborn .

 In 1938 Horne enlisted in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve on a part @-@ time training scheme . He was commissioned as an acting pilot officer in No. 911 ( County of Warwick ) Squadron , a barrage balloon unit in Sutton Coldfield , and was called up into the RAF full @-@ time on the outbreak of war . In the initial months of the conflict — the Phoney War — Horne 's duties were undemanding , and he formed a concert party from his friends and colleagues . In November 1940 he was promoted to flight lieutenant , and to squadron leader a year later . In early 1942 the BBC producer Bill <unk> asked whether the RAF station at which Horne was based could put on an edition of his programme Ack @-@ Ack , Beer @-@ Beer . Horne was ordered to put on the show , and he made his broadcasting debut on 16 April 1942 , as the compere . Although the standard of the talent on the show was not high , <unk> was impressed with Horne 's presentation , especially the way he hosted the programme 's quiz ; he invited Horne to be the programme 's regular <unk> , a role the latter fulfilled on over fifty Ack @-@ Ack , Beer @-@ Beer quizzes over the next two years . In January 1943 he became one of the show 's regular <unk> and presented the entire show for the first time . 
 In March 1943 Horne was posted to the Air Ministry in London with the rank of wing commander . Continuing to broadcast on Ack @-@ Ack , Beer @-@ Beer , he also began to write sketches for the programme , and make broadcasts on other shows , including the Overseas Recorded Broadcasting Service ( <unk> ) , to be transmitted to British forces in the Middle East . His work with <unk> brought him into contact with Flight Lieutenant Richard Murdoch , who he jokingly introduced in one broadcast as " the station commander of Much @-@ Binding @-@ in @-@ the @-@ Marsh " ; with a great deal in common in their backgrounds and a similar sense of humour , the pair quickly formed a friendship . Horne informed Murdoch of a squadron leader vacancy in his section at the Ministry , and Murdoch became his colleague . Murdoch , a professional actor and entertainer for 12 years before the war , recognised Horne 's talent as a performer , and used his contacts to secure him more broadcasting work . 
 Ack @-@ Ack , Beer @-@ Beer came to an end in February 1944 when the BBC decided to direct their programming at the general armed forces , rather than the barrage balloon crews . A month later Horne and Murdoch had expanded the idea of the remote and fictitious Royal Air Force station , Much @-@ Binding @-@ in @-@ the @-@ Marsh . The pair took the idea to the BBC producer Leslie <unk> who was responsible for the show Merry @-@ go @-@ Round , which featured , in weekly rotation , shows based on the Army , Navy and RAF . <unk> included a Much @-@ Binding @-@ in @-@ the @-@ Marsh section in Merry @-@ go @-@ Round on 31 March 1944 ; Horne played " an officer so dim that even the other officers noticed " , with Murdoch as his harassed second @-@ in @-@ command and Sam Costa as an " amiable chump who always got things wrong " . 
 During 1944 Horne met and fell in love with Marjorie Thomas , a war widow with a young daughter . He was divorced in early 1945 , and he and Thomas were married in November that year , three months after he had been demobilised . 
 = = = Postwar , a double career : 1945 – 58 = = = 
 On his return to civilian life , Horne resumed working at Triplex , and was promoted to the position of sales director . Despite his subsequent joint career in broadcasting and business , his commercial activities always took precedence . He declared that his work on radio was only a hobby , and that he would give it up before his business career . He combined his two roles by working full @-@ time , and writing scripts with Murdoch at weekends . 
 Much @-@ Binding @-@ in @-@ the @-@ Marsh had gained sufficient popularity over its run of 20 Merry @-@ go @-@ Round episodes to be given its own 39 @-@ week series beginning in January 1947 . With the coming of peace , the supposed RAF station became a civil airport , and the show continued much as before , written by and starring Horne and Murdoch , with Sam Costa . Maurice Denham — described by Murdoch as a vocal chameleon — joined the cast and played over 60 roles . The programme became popular , with audiences of 20 million , and ran for four series until September 1950 . 
 In March 1948 Horne appeared with Murdoch in six episodes of the BBC Television comedy series Kaleidoscope . In June that year he and Murdoch again appeared on television in a one @-@ off sitcom , At Home , which they wrote . The following year Horne began his connection with Twenty Questions , an association that lasted , on @-@ and @-@ off , for 20 years . By the fourth series of Much @-@ Binding in 1950 , the listener figures had declined to a level that concerned the BBC and they decided against a fifth series . Rather than wait to see what other offers of work would come in from the Corporation , Horne and Murdoch signed the comedy to a 35 @-@ programme series on Radio Luxembourg between October 1950 and June 1951 . The programme was poorly received on the commercial channel : Murdoch observed that " it wasn 't really a great success — even my mother said it was rotten , and she was my greatest fan " . After one series , the show returned to the BBC in 1951 – 52 , although renamed as Over to You . Murdoch and Horne again appeared together , in April 1952 , on Desert Island Discs . 
 In 1954 , after nine years in his senior position at Triplex , and 27 years at the company , Horne accepted the position of managing director of the British Industries Fair , a government @-@ backed organisation promoting British goods worldwide ; he took up his position in July 1955 . Much of the work involved liaising with foreign buyers and delegations , and he accompanied the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh on visits to the annual fair . In 1956 the government withdrew its funding and the <unk> closed . Horne received several attractive job offers , and chose the post of chairman and managing director of the toy manufacturers Chad Valley , where he was a success . In September that year he and Murdoch appeared in a one @-@ off television programme Show for the Telly . 
 In January 1957 Horne appeared as the compere on the popular Saturday evening comedy and music radio show Variety Playhouse , initially for a run of four months , but soon extended until the end of June . He also began to write a weekly column for the women 's magazine She , and to appear in an increasing number of other programmes . After his work on Variety Playhouse had finished , he and the programme 's writers , Eric Merriman and Barry Took , prepared a script for a pilot episode of a new show , Beyond Our Ken . The show , in which Horne was joined by Kenneth Williams , Ron Moody , Hugh Paddick and Betty Marsden , was broadcast in October 1957 . 
 = = = A single career : 1958 – 69 = = = 
 The pilot episode of Beyond Our Ken was well received by the BBC , and they commissioned a series to start in April 1958 . On 27 February that year — his 51st birthday — Horne suffered a debilitating stroke and was totally paralysed down his left @-@ hand side and lost the power of speech . He underwent a course of intensive physiotherapy and was able to return home after two weeks . His voice returned when , during heavy massage on his left thigh , a sharp pain led to him shouting " You bugger ! " at the physiotherapist . His doctor told him that the stroke was caused by the stress of combining a full @-@ time business post with his broadcasting work . He also told Horne that when he had recovered he would never be fit enough to continue as before . Horne considered that it was not the physical problem of combining his two careers , but the mental strain of problems in his business life ; accordingly he decided to give up commerce and concentrate on a career in entertainment . Because of the stroke , plans for Beyond Our Ken were suspended . 
 In April 1958 Horne eased himself back into broadcasting as chairman of Twenty Questions . This evidence of his recovery was sufficient for the BBC to begin recording Beyond Our Ken in June , in preparation for the broadcast of the first series between July and November . Beyond Our Ken was written around the imperturbable establishment figure of Horne , while the other performers played a " spectrum of characters never before heard on the radio " , including the exaggeratedly upper class Rodney and Charles , the genteel pensioners Ambrose and Felicity , the cook Fanny Haddock — a parody of popular TV cook Fanny Cradock — and the gardener Arthur Fallowfield . The first episode was not well received by a sample audience , but the BBC decided to back Horne and his team , and the initial six @-@ week contract was extended to 21 weeks . Before the series came to an end a second had been commissioned to run the following year . After the first series Moody was succeeded by Bill Pertwee ; Took left after the second series , leaving Merriman to write the remaining programmes on his own . 
 The second series of Beyond Our Ken followed in 1959 ; a third in 1960 . Horne also continued his work in television , hosting his own series , Trader Horne , and appearing on a number of other programmes . In April 1961 he made his second appearance on Desert Island Discs , this time unaccompanied by Murdoch . In October that year — three weeks after the fifth series of Beyond Our Ken began recording — Horne appeared as the anchorman on a new BBC television series , Let 's Imagine , a discussion programme which ran for 20 editions over 18 months . He was the subject of This Is Your Life in February 1962 , hosted by Eamonn Andrews , in which guests included friends and colleagues from his connections in business and entertainment . In June 1963 he began Ken 's Column , a series of 15 @-@ minute one @-@ man programmes for Anglia Television . 
 The seventh series of Beyond Our Ken finished in February 1964 , with an average audience of ten million listeners per programme . In September that year Horne returned from holiday and was scheduled to appear in a number of programmes ; Eric Merriman objected to Horne 's activities , saying that Horne had been made into a star by the writer , and that " no other comedy series should be allowed to use him " . When the BBC refused to withdraw Horne from the second programme , Down with Women , Merriman resigned from writing Beyond Our Ken and the show came to an end . After some pressure from Horne to keep the remainder of the team together , the BBC commissioned a replacement series , Round the Horne , on similar lines . They turned to one of the original writers of Beyond Our Ken , Barry Took and his new writing partner , Marty Feldman . Horne remained the genial and unflappable focal figure , and the writers invented several new and eccentric characters to revolve round him . They included J. <unk> <unk> , the walking slum ; the Noël Coward parodies Charles and Fiona ; the incompetent villain Dr. Chou En Ginsberg ; the folk singer Rambling Syd <unk> and the " outrageously camp " Julian and Sandy . The resulting programme was described by radio historians Andy Foster and Steve Furst as " one of the seminal comedies to come out of the BBC " , while The Spectator described it as " one of the great radio successes " . The first series of Round the Horne , consisting of 16 episodes , ran from March to June 1965 . Horne 's role was to provide " the perfect foil to the inspired lunacy happening all around him " : 
 On 7 October 1966 , at the age of 59 , Horne suffered a major heart attack . He was much weakened , and was unfit to work for three months . As a result , he did not appear in the Round the Horne Christmas special . He returned to work in January 1967 to record the third series . 
 Round the Horne ran to four series , broadcast in successive years , and finished in June 1968 . Three weeks after the fourth series finished , the first episode of Horne A <unk> was broadcast on ITV . In a sketch show format , and with Barry Took as script editor ( and later producer ) , this was an attempt to translate the spirit of Round the Horne to television , although with different actors supporting Horne : Graham Stark , for example , substituted for Kenneth Williams and Sheila <unk> for Betty Marsden . The first six @-@ part series ran from 22 June to 27 July 1968 , the second ( by which time ABC had become Thames Television ) from 27 November to 1 January 1969 . 
 = = = Death and tributes = = = 
 Because of his heart condition , Horne had been prescribed an anticoagulant , but had stopped taking it on the advice of a faith healer . Horne died of a heart attack on 14 February 1969 , while hosting the annual Guild of Television Producers ' and Directors ' Awards at the Dorchester hotel in London . Presenting the awards was Earl Mountbatten of Burma ; an award had gone to Barry Took and Marty Feldman for their TV series Marty , and Horne had just urged viewers to tune into the fifth series of Round the Horne ( which was due to start on 16 March ) when he fell from the podium . The televised recording of the event omitted the incident , with announcer Michael Aspel explaining , " Mr Horne was taken ill at this point and has since died . " A memorial service was held at St Martin @-@ in @-@ the @-@ Fields in March that year . 
 After his death , Horne was eulogised in The Times as " a master of the scandalous double @-@ meaning delivered with shining innocence " , while The Sunday Mirror called him " one of the few personalities who bridged the generation gap " and " perhaps the last of the truly great radio comics . " In the December 1970 issue of The Listener , Barry Took recalled Round the Horne and said of its star : 
 " He was an unselfish performer , but it was still always his show . You just knew it . A Martian would have known it . His warmth tempered the sharpness of the writing ... To say that everyone loved him sounds like every obituary ever written – nonetheless it 's true ... Horne was one of the few great men I have met , and his generosity of spirit and gesture have , in my experience , never been surpassed . I mourn him still . " 
 On hearing the news Kenneth Williams wrote in his diary that " I loved that man . His unselfish nature , his kindness , tolerance and gentleness were an example to everyone " . In The Sunday Times in February 1969 , Paul Jennings wrote of him : " If I ever knew a gentleman , it was Kenneth Horne . ... He gave you his whole attention , his whole courtesy . And what a courtesy it was ! ... I knew him in the context of panel games , to which his marvellous unforced humour , spontaneous but beautifully timed , always added sparkle . " 
 = = Technique = = 
 Horne 's friend , Barry Took , considered that " Horne 's rich , fruity voice and warm patrician manner made him the ideal link man and that , coupled with a mischievous sense of humour , ensured that any programme in which he was involved was the better for his presence " . Horne attributed his voice and delivery " to ' the Grace of God ' , his grandfather Lord Cozens @-@ Hardy , the former Master of the Rolls , and the hard training of being ' a jovial chap among the golf and motoring fraternity ' . " 
 The obituarist for The Times highlighted Horne 's " remarkably skilful but very personal comic technique " of playing " a friendly good @-@ natured old buffer who was simply doing his best , apparently lost in wonder , at the glossier , more spectacular talents of those among whom he found himself " . The media analysts Frank <unk> and Steve Neale see a similar role and consider that " Horne functioned , like [ Jack ] Benny , [ Fred ] Allen and [ Tommy ] Handley before him , as a ' stooge ' rather than a joke @-@ wielder , frequently switching roles between announcer and in @-@ sketch performer " . 
 In Round the Horne , as well as acting as link man , Horne also played other character roles in the film and melodrama spoofs , but always sounded exactly like Kenneth Horne . Referring to his ability with voices , he commented that " between them Betty , Ken W. , Hugh and Bill Pertwee can provide at least 100 voices , and if you take me into account the figure leaps to 101 . " Williams reported that Horne had a card index mind , " in which there seemed to be stored every funny voice , every dialect , every comedy trick , which he knew that each member of the cast was capable of " , and would suggest a change in approach if a line did not work during rehearsals . 
 Graham Ball , writing in the Sunday Express observed that Horne " didn 't tell jokes in the usual manner , didn 't have a catchphrase and never resorted to blue comedy " . Ball also identified that Horne 's " stage character , that of a slightly <unk> English gent , was adored by middle- and working @-@ class audiences alike . His humour was original , almost underplayed , but the effortless delivery and uncanny timing concealed an almost anarchic sense of mischief . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 By 24 February 1969 it had been decided that Round the Horne could not continue without its star . As a result , the scripts for Series Five ( which Horne had jokingly suggested should be subtitled ' The First All @-@ Nude Radio Show ' ) were hastily adapted into a new series for Kenneth Williams called Stop Messing About , which ran for two series but was widely judged a failure and discontinued in 1970 . On the first day of recording the new show , Williams wrote in his diary that " I miss [ Horne ] dreadfully . I could weep for all that goodness gone from our atmosphere at the show " . 
 A successful stage show called Round the Horne ... Revisited opened in London in October 2003 , compiled by Series Four co @-@ writer Brian Cooke from original scripts and featuring Jonathan Rigby as Horne . The West End production ran until April 2005 and generated a BBC Four television film and an appearance at the 2004 Royal Variety Performance , with Rigby playing Horne again on both occasions . Subsequently there were three national tours , the first two of which took place while the London run continued ; in the touring version Horne was played by Stephen Critchlow , who also played him in a Julian and Sandy sketch recreated in the 2006 BBC television drama Kenneth Williams : Fantabulosa ! 
 On 27 February 2007 ( Horne 's centenary ) , BBC Radio 4 broadcast a half @-@ hour documentary tribute entitled Sound the Horne , hosted by Jimmy Carr . The following year , on 18 September , another Radio 4 documentary was broadcast ; called Thoroughly Modest Mollie , this one focused on Horne 's frequent ghost @-@ writer , Mollie Millest , and featured Jonathan Rigby again as Horne . Rigby reprised the role yet again in a new stage show , devised this time by Barry Took 's widow Lyn , called Round the Horne – Unseen and Uncut , which toured in 2008 @-@ 09 . Also in 2009 , an unbroadcast pilot script written by Horne and Millest in 1966 was produced by the same Radio 4 team as the Millest documentary . Called Twice Ken is Plenty and intended as a two @-@ man showcase for Horne and Kenneth Williams , the 21st century version was performed by Rigby and , as Williams , Robin Sebastian . The show was broadcast on 1 September 2009 . 
 Horne has been the subject of two biographies , Norman <unk> 's Solo for Horne in 1976 and Barry Johnston 's Round Mr Horne : The Life of Kenneth Horne in 2006 . In 1998 Ernie Wise unveiled a blue plaque to Horne at BBC Broadcasting House . Editions of Beyond Our Ken and Round the Horne are regularly broadcast on the digital radio service BBC 4 Extra , and by 2006 over half a million copies of tapes and CDs of Round the Horne had been sold by the BBC . In a 2002 survey conducted by the BBC to find listeners ' favourite British comedian , Horne appeared third , behind Tony Hancock and Spike Milligan .

 = Influenza = 
 Influenza , commonly known as " the flu " , is an infectious disease caused by an influenza virus . Symptoms can be mild to severe . The most common symptoms include : a high fever , runny nose , sore throat , muscle pains , headache , coughing , and feeling tired . These symptoms typically begin two days after exposure to the virus and most last less than a week . The cough , however , may last for more than two weeks . In children , there may be nausea and vomiting , but these are not common in adults . Nausea and vomiting occur more commonly in the unrelated infection gastroenteritis , which is sometimes inaccurately referred to as " stomach flu " or " 24 @-@ hour flu " . Complications of influenza may include viral pneumonia , secondary bacterial pneumonia , sinus infections , and worsening of previous health problems such as asthma or heart failure . 
 Three types of influenza viruses affect people , called Type A , Type B , and Type C. Usually , the virus is spread through the air from coughs or sneezes . This is believed to occur mostly over relatively short distances . It can also be spread by touching surfaces contaminated by the virus and then touching the mouth or eyes . A person may be infectious to others both before and during the time they are showing symptoms . The infection may be confirmed by testing the throat , sputum , or nose for the virus . A number of rapid tests are available ; however , people may still have the infection if the results are negative . A type of polymerase chain reaction that detects the virus 's RNA is more accurate . 
 Frequent hand washing reduces the risk of infection because the virus is inactivated by soap . Wearing a surgical mask is also useful . Yearly vaccinations against influenza are recommended by the World Health Organization for those at high risk . The vaccine is usually effective against three or four types of influenza . It is usually well tolerated . A vaccine made for one year may not be useful in the following year , since the virus evolves rapidly . Antiviral drugs such as the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir , among others , have been used to treat influenza . Their benefits in those who are otherwise healthy do not appear to be greater than their risks . No benefit has been found in those with other health problems . 
 Influenza spreads around the world in a yearly outbreak , resulting in about three to five million cases of severe illness and about 250 @,@ 000 to 500 @,@ 000 deaths . In the Northern and Southern parts of the world outbreaks occur mainly in winter while in areas around the equator outbreaks may occur at any time of the year . Death occurs mostly in the young , the old and those with other health problems . Larger outbreaks known as pandemics are less frequent . In the 20th century three influenza pandemics occurred : Spanish influenza in 1918 , Asian influenza in 1958 , and Hong Kong influenza in 1968 , each resulting in more than a million deaths . The World Health Organization declared an outbreak of a new type of influenza A / H1N1 to be a pandemic in June 2009 . Influenza may also affect other animals , including pigs , horses and birds . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 Approximately 33 % of people with influenza are asymptomatic . 
 Symptoms of influenza can start quite suddenly one to two days after infection . Usually the first symptoms are chills or a chilly sensation , but fever is also common early in the infection , with body temperatures ranging from 38 to 39 ° C ( approximately 100 to 103 ° F ) . Many people are so ill that they are confined to bed for several days , with aches and pains throughout their bodies , which are worse in their backs and legs . Symptoms of influenza may include : 
 Fever and extreme coldness ( chills shivering , shaking ( rigor ) ) 
 Cough 
 Nasal congestion 
 <unk> nose 
 Sneezing 
 Body aches , especially joints and throat 
 Fatigue 
 Headache 
 Irritated , watering eyes 
 <unk> eyes , skin ( especially face ) , mouth , throat and nose 
 <unk> rash 
 In children , gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain , ( may be severe in children with influenza B ) 
 It can be difficult to distinguish between the common cold and influenza in the early stages of these infections , but a flu can be identified by a high fever with a sudden onset and extreme fatigue . Influenza is a mixture of symptoms of common cold and pneumonia , body ache , headache , and fatigue . Diarrhea is not normally a symptom of influenza in adults , although it has been seen in some human cases of the H5N1 " bird flu " and can be a symptom in children . The symptoms most reliably seen in influenza are shown in the table to the right . 
 Since antiviral drugs are effective in treating influenza if given early ( see treatment section , below ) , it can be important to identify cases early . Of the symptoms listed above , the combinations of fever with cough , sore throat and / or nasal congestion can improve diagnostic accuracy . Two decision analysis studies suggest that during local outbreaks of influenza , the prevalence will be over 70 % , and thus patients with any of these combinations of symptoms may be treated with neuraminidase inhibitors without testing . Even in the absence of a local outbreak , treatment may be justified in the elderly during the influenza season as long as the prevalence is over 15 % . 
 The available laboratory tests for influenza continue to improve . The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) maintains an up @-@ to @-@ date summary of available laboratory tests . According to the CDC , rapid diagnostic tests have a sensitivity of 50 – 75 % and specificity of 90 – 95 % when compared with viral culture . These tests may be especially useful during the influenza season ( prevalence = 25 % ) but in the absence of a local outbreak , or peri @-@ influenza season ( prevalence = 10 % ) . 
 Occasionally , influenza can cause severe illness including primary viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia . The obvious symptom is trouble breathing . In addition , if a child ( or presumably an adult ) seems to be getting better and then relapses with a high fever , that is a danger sign since this relapse can be bacterial pneumonia .

 In virus classification influenza viruses are RNA viruses that make up three of the five genera of the family <unk> : 
 Influenzavirus A 
 Influenzavirus B 
 Influenzavirus C 
 These viruses are only distantly related to the human parainfluenza viruses , which are RNA viruses belonging to the paramyxovirus family that are a common cause of respiratory infections in children such as croup , but can also cause a disease similar to influenza in adults . 
 A fourth family of influenza viruses has been proposed - influenza D. The type species for this family is Bovine Influenza D virus which was first isolated in 2012 . 
 = = = = Influenzavirus A = = = = 
 This genus has one species , influenza A virus . Wild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a large variety of influenza A. Occasionally , viruses are transmitted to other species and may then cause devastating outbreaks in domestic poultry or give rise to human influenza pandemics . The type A viruses are the most virulent human pathogens among the three influenza types and cause the severest disease . The influenza A virus can be subdivided into different serotypes based on the antibody response to these viruses . The serotypes that have been confirmed in humans , ordered by the number of known human pandemic deaths , are : 
 H1N1 , which caused Spanish Flu in 1918 , and Swine Flu in 2009 
 <unk> , which caused Asian Flu in 1957 
 H3N2 , which caused Hong Kong Flu in 1968 
 H5N1 , which caused Bird Flu in 2004

 This genus has one species , influenza B virus . Influenza B almost exclusively infects humans and is less common than influenza A. The only other animals known to be susceptible to influenza B infection are the seal and the ferret . This type of influenza mutates at a rate 2 – 3 times slower than type A and consequently is less genetically diverse , with only one influenza B serotype . As a result of this lack of antigenic diversity , a degree of immunity to influenza B is usually acquired at an early age . However , influenza B mutates enough that lasting immunity is not possible . This reduced rate of antigenic change , combined with its limited host range ( inhibiting cross species antigenic shift ) , ensures that pandemics of influenza B do not occur . 
 = = = = Influenzavirus C = = = = 
 This genus has one species , influenza C virus , which infects humans , dogs and pigs , sometimes causing both severe illness and local epidemics . However , influenza C is less common than the other types and usually only causes mild disease in children . 
 = = = Structure , properties , and subtype nomenclature = = = 
 <unk> A , B and C are very similar in overall structure . The virus particle is 80 – 120 nanometers in diameter and usually roughly spherical , although filamentous forms can occur . These filamentous forms are more common in influenza C , which can form cordlike structures up to 500 micrometers long on the surfaces of infected cells . However , despite these varied shapes , the viral particles of all influenza viruses are similar in composition . These are made of a viral envelope containing two main types of glycoproteins , wrapped around a central core . The central core contains the viral RNA genome and other viral proteins that package and protect this RNA . RNA tends to be single stranded but in special cases it is double . Unusually for a virus , its genome is not a single piece of nucleic acid ; instead , it contains seven or eight pieces of segmented negative @-@ sense RNA , each piece of RNA containing either one or two genes , which code for a gene product ( protein ) . For example , the influenza A genome contains 11 genes on eight pieces of RNA , encoding for 11 proteins : hemagglutinin ( HA ) , neuraminidase ( NA ) , nucleoprotein ( NP ) , M1 , M2 , NS1 , <unk> ( NEP : nuclear export protein ) , PA , PB1 ( polymerase basic 1 ) , PB1 @-@ F2 and PB2 . 
 <unk> ( HA ) and neuraminidase ( NA ) are the two large glycoproteins on the outside of the viral particles . HA is a lectin that mediates binding of the virus to target cells and entry of the viral genome into the target cell , while NA is involved in the release of progeny virus from infected cells , by cleaving sugars that bind the mature viral particles . Thus , these proteins are targets for antiviral drugs . Furthermore , they are antigens to which antibodies can be raised . Influenza A viruses are classified into subtypes based on antibody responses to HA and NA . These different types of HA and NA form the basis of the H and N distinctions in , for example , H5N1 . There are 16 H and 9 N subtypes known , but only H 1 , 2 and 3 , and N 1 and 2 are commonly found in humans . 
 = = = Replication = = = 
 Viruses can replicate only in living cells . Influenza infection and replication is a multi @-@ step process : First , the virus has to bind to and enter the cell , then deliver its genome to a site where it can produce new copies of viral proteins and RNA , assemble these components into new viral particles , and , last , exit the host cell . 
 Influenza viruses bind through hemagglutinin onto sialic acid sugars on the surfaces of epithelial cells , typically in the nose , throat , and lungs of mammals , and intestines of birds ( Stage 1 in infection figure ) . After the hemagglutinin is cleaved by a protease , the cell imports the virus by endocytosis . 
 The intracellular details are still being elucidated . It is known that virions converge to the microtubule organizing center , interact with acidic endosomes and finally enter the target endosomes for genome release . 
 Once inside the cell , the acidic conditions in the endosome cause two events to happen : First , part of the hemagglutinin protein fuses the viral envelope with the vacuole 's membrane , then the M2 ion channel allows protons to move through the viral envelope and acidify the core of the virus , which causes the core to disassemble and release the viral RNA and core proteins . The viral RNA ( vRNA ) molecules , accessory proteins and RNA @-@ dependent RNA polymerase are then released into the cytoplasm ( Stage 2 ) . The M2 ion channel is blocked by amantadine drugs , preventing infection . 
 These core proteins and vRNA form a complex that is transported into the cell nucleus , where the RNA @-@ dependent RNA polymerase begins transcribing complementary positive @-@ sense vRNA ( Steps 3a and b ) . The vRNA either is exported into the cytoplasm and translated ( step 4 ) or remains in the nucleus . Newly synthesized viral proteins are either secreted through the Golgi apparatus onto the cell surface ( in the case of neuraminidase and hemagglutinin , step 5b ) or transported back into the nucleus to bind vRNA and form new viral genome particles ( step 5a ) . Other viral proteins have multiple actions in the host cell , including degrading cellular mRNA and using the released nucleotides for vRNA synthesis and also inhibiting translation of host @-@ cell mRNAs . 
 Negative @-@ sense <unk> that form the genomes of future viruses , RNA @-@ dependent RNA polymerase , and other viral proteins are assembled into a virion . <unk> and neuraminidase molecules cluster into a bulge in the cell membrane . The vRNA and viral core proteins leave the nucleus and enter this membrane protrusion ( step 6 ) . The mature virus buds off from the cell in a sphere of host phospholipid membrane , acquiring hemagglutinin and neuraminidase with this membrane coat ( step 7 ) . As before , the viruses adhere to the cell through hemagglutinin ; the mature viruses detach once their neuraminidase has cleaved sialic acid residues from the host cell . After the release of new influenza viruses , the host cell dies . 
 Because of the absence of RNA proofreading enzymes , the RNA @-@ dependent RNA polymerase that copies the viral genome makes an error roughly every 10 thousand nucleotides , which is the approximate length of the influenza vRNA . Hence , the majority of newly manufactured influenza viruses are mutants ; this causes antigenic drift , which is a slow change in the antigens on the viral surface over time . The separation of the genome into eight separate segments of vRNA allows mixing or reassortment of <unk> if more than one type of influenza virus infects a single cell . The resulting rapid change in viral genetics produces antigenic shifts , which are sudden changes from one antigen to another . These sudden large changes allow the virus to infect new host species and quickly overcome protective immunity . This is important in the emergence of pandemics , as discussed below in the section on Epidemiology . 
 = = Mechanism = = 
 = = = Transmission = = = 
 When an infected person sneezes or coughs more than half a million virus particles can be spread to those close by . In otherwise healthy adults , influenza virus shedding ( the time during which a person might be infectious to another person ) increases sharply one @-@ half to one day after infection , peaks on day 2 and persists for an average total duration of 5 days — but can persist as long as 9 days . In those who develop symptoms from experimental infection ( only 67 % of healthy experimentally infected individuals ) , symptoms and viral shedding show a similar pattern , but with viral shedding preceding illness by one day . Children are much more infectious than adults and shed virus from just before they develop symptoms until two weeks after infection . In immunocompromised people , viral shedding can continue for longer than two weeks . 
 Influenza can be spread in three main ways : by direct transmission ( when an infected person sneezes mucus directly into the eyes , nose or mouth of another person ) ; the airborne route ( when someone inhales the aerosols produced by an infected person coughing , sneezing or spitting ) and through hand @-@ to @-@ eye , hand @-@ to @-@ nose , or hand @-@ to @-@ mouth transmission , either from contaminated surfaces or from direct personal contact such as a hand @-@ shake . The relative importance of these three modes of transmission is unclear , and they may all contribute to the spread of the virus . In the airborne route , the droplets that are small enough for people to inhale are 0 @.@ 5 to 5 µm in diameter and inhaling just one droplet might be enough to cause an infection . Although a single sneeze releases up to 40 @,@ 000 droplets , most of these droplets are quite large and will quickly settle out of the air . How long influenza survives in airborne droplets seems to be influenced by the levels of humidity and UV radiation , with low humidity and a lack of sunlight in winter aiding its survival . 
 As the influenza virus can persist outside of the body , it can also be transmitted by contaminated surfaces such as banknotes , doorknobs , light switches and other household items . The length of time the virus will persist on a surface varies , with the virus surviving for one to two days on hard , non @-@ porous surfaces such as plastic or metal , for about fifteen minutes from dry paper tissues , and only five minutes on skin . However , if the virus is present in mucus , this can protect it for longer periods ( up to 17 days on banknotes ) . Avian influenza viruses can survive indefinitely when frozen . They are inactivated by heating to 56 ° C ( 133 ° F ) for a minimum of 60 minutes , as well as by acids ( at pH < 2 ) . 
 = = = Pathophysiology = = = 
 The mechanisms by which influenza infection causes symptoms in humans have been studied intensively . One of the mechanisms is believed to be the inhibition of adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) resulting in lowered cortisol levels . Knowing which genes are carried by a particular strain can help predict how well it will infect humans and how severe this infection will be ( that is , predict the strain 's pathophysiology ) . 
 For instance , part of the process that allows influenza viruses to invade cells is the cleavage of the viral hemagglutinin protein by any one of several human proteases . In mild and <unk> viruses , the structure of the hemagglutinin means that it can only be cleaved by proteases found in the throat and lungs , so these viruses cannot infect other tissues . However , in highly virulent strains , such as H5N1 , the hemagglutinin can be cleaved by a wide variety of proteases , allowing the virus to spread throughout the body . 
 The viral hemagglutinin protein is responsible for determining both which species a strain can infect and where in the human respiratory tract a strain of influenza will bind . Strains that are easily transmitted between people have hemagglutinin proteins that bind to receptors in the upper part of the respiratory tract , such as in the nose , throat and mouth . In contrast , the highly lethal H5N1 strain binds to receptors that are mostly found deep in the lungs . This difference in the site of infection may be part of the reason why the H5N1 strain causes severe viral pneumonia in the lungs , but is not easily transmitted by people coughing and sneezing . 
 Common symptoms of the flu such as fever , headaches , and fatigue are the result of the huge amounts of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines ( such as interferon or tumor necrosis factor ) produced from influenza @-@ infected cells . In contrast to the rhinovirus that causes the common cold , influenza does cause tissue damage , so symptoms are not entirely due to the inflammatory response . This massive immune response might produce a life @-@ threatening cytokine storm . This effect has been proposed to be the cause of the unusual lethality of both the H5N1 avian influenza , and the 1918 pandemic strain . However , another possibility is that these large amounts of cytokines are just a result of the massive levels of viral replication produced by these strains , and the immune response does not itself contribute to the disease . 
 = = Prevention = = 
 = = = Vaccination = = = 
 The influenza vaccine is recommended by the World Health Organization and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for high @-@ risk groups , such as children , the elderly , health care workers , and people who have chronic illnesses such as asthma , diabetes , heart disease , or are immuno @-@ compromised among others . In healthy adults it is modestly effective in decreasing the amount of influenza @-@ like symptoms in a population . Evidence is supportive of a decreased rate of influenza in children over the age of two . In those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease vaccination reduces exacerbations , it is not clear if it reduces asthma exacerbations . Evidence supports a lower rate of influenza @-@ like illness in many groups who are immunocompromised such as those with : HIV / AIDS , cancer , and post organ transplant . In those at high risk immunization may reduce the risk of heart disease . Whether immunizing health care workers affects patient outcomes is controversial with some reviews finding insufficient evidence and others finding tentative evidence . 
 Due to the high mutation rate of the virus , a particular influenza vaccine usually confers protection for no more than a few years . Every year , the World Health Organization predicts which strains of the virus are most likely to be circulating in the next year ( see Historical annual reformulations of the influenza vaccine ) , allowing pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines that will provide the best immunity against these strains . The vaccine is reformulated each season for a few specific flu strains but does not include all the strains active in the world during that season . It takes about six months for the manufacturers to formulate and produce the millions of doses required to deal with the seasonal epidemics ; occasionally , a new or overlooked strain becomes prominent during that time . It is also possible to get infected just before vaccination and get sick with the strain that the vaccine is supposed to prevent , as the vaccine takes about two weeks to become effective . 
 Vaccines can cause the immune system to react as if the body were actually being infected , and general infection symptoms ( many cold and flu symptoms are just general infection symptoms ) can appear , though these symptoms are usually not as severe or long @-@ lasting as influenza . The most dangerous adverse effect is a severe allergic reaction to either the virus material itself or residues from the hen eggs used to grow the influenza ; however , these reactions are extremely rare . 
 The cost @-@ effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination has been widely evaluated for different groups and in different settings . It has generally been found to be a cost @-@ effective intervention , especially in children and the elderly , however the results of economic evaluations of influenza vaccination have often been found to be dependent on key assumptions . 
 = = = Infection control = = = 
 Reasonably effective ways to reduce the transmission of influenza include good personal health and hygiene habits such as : not touching your eyes , nose or mouth ; frequent hand washing ( with soap and water , or with alcohol @-@ based hand rubs ) ; covering coughs and sneezes ; avoiding close contact with sick people ; and staying home yourself if you are sick . Avoiding spitting is also recommended . Although face masks might help prevent transmission when caring for the sick , there is mixed evidence on beneficial effects in the community . Smoking raises the risk of contracting influenza , as well as producing more severe disease symptoms . 
 Since influenza spreads through both aerosols and contact with contaminated surfaces , surface sanitizing may help prevent some infections . Alcohol is an effective sanitizer against influenza viruses , while quaternary ammonium compounds can be used with alcohol so that the sanitizing effect lasts for longer . In hospitals , quaternary ammonium compounds and bleach are used to sanitize rooms or equipment that have been occupied by patients with influenza symptoms . At home , this can be done effectively with a diluted chlorine bleach . 
 During past pandemics , closing schools , churches and theaters slowed the spread of the virus but did not have a large effect on the overall death rate . It is uncertain if reducing public gatherings , by for example closing schools and workplaces , will reduce transmission since people with influenza may just be moved from one area to another ; such measures would also be difficult to enforce and might be unpopular . When small numbers of people are infected , isolating the sick might reduce the risk of transmission . 
 = = Treatment = = 
 People with the flu are advised to get plenty of rest , drink plenty of liquids , avoid using alcohol and tobacco and , if necessary , take medications such as acetaminophen ( paracetamol ) to relieve the fever and muscle aches associated with the flu . Children and teenagers with flu symptoms ( particularly fever ) should avoid taking aspirin during an influenza infection ( especially influenza type B ) , because doing so can lead to Reye 's syndrome , a rare but potentially fatal disease of the liver . Since influenza is caused by a virus , antibiotics have no effect on the infection ; unless prescribed for secondary infections such as bacterial pneumonia . Antiviral medication may be effective , if given early , but some strains of influenza can show resistance to the standard antiviral drugs and there is concern about the quality of the research . 
 = = = Antivirals = = = 
 The two classes of antiviral drugs used against influenza are neuraminidase inhibitors ( oseltamivir and zanamivir ) and M2 protein inhibitors ( <unk> derivatives ) . 
 = = = = <unk> inhibitors = = = = 
 Overall the benefits of neuraminidase inhibitors in those who are otherwise healthy do not appear to be greater than the risks . There does not appear to be any benefit in those with other health problems . In those believed to have the flu , they decreased the length of time symptoms were present by slightly less than a day but did not appear to affect the risk of complications such as needing hospitalization or pneumonia . Previous to 2013 the benefits were unclear as the manufacturer ( Roche ) refused to release trial data for independent analysis . Increasingly prevalent resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has led to researchers to seek alternative antiviral drugs with different mechanisms of action . 
 = = = = M2 inhibitors = = = = 
 The antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine inhibit a viral ion channel ( M2 protein ) , thus inhibiting replication of the influenza A virus . These drugs are sometimes effective against influenza A if given early in the infection but are ineffective against influenza B viruses , which lack the M2 drug target . Measured resistance to amantadine and rimantadine in American isolates of H3N2 has increased to 91 % in 2005 . This high level of resistance may be due to the easy availability of <unk> as part of over @-@ the @-@ counter cold remedies in countries such as China and Russia , and their use to prevent outbreaks of influenza in farmed poultry . The CDC recommended against using M2 inhibitors during the 2005 – 06 influenza season due to high levels of drug resistance . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 Influenza 's effects are much more severe and last longer than those of the common cold . Most people will recover completely in about one to two weeks , but others will develop life @-@ threatening complications ( such as pneumonia ) . Thus , influenza can be deadly , especially for the weak , young and old , or chronically ill . People with a weak immune system , such as people with advanced HIV infection or transplant patients ( whose immune systems are medically suppressed to prevent transplant organ rejection ) , suffer from particularly severe disease . Pregnant women and young children are also at a high risk for complications . 
 The flu can worsen chronic health problems . People with emphysema , chronic bronchitis or asthma may experience shortness of breath while they have the flu , and influenza may cause worsening of coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure . Smoking is another risk factor associated with more serious disease and increased mortality from influenza . 
 According to the World Health Organization : " Every winter , tens of millions of people get the flu . Most are only ill and out of work for a week , yet the elderly are at a higher risk of death from the illness . We know the worldwide death toll exceeds a few hundred thousand people a year , but even in developed countries the numbers are uncertain , because medical authorities don 't usually verify who actually died of influenza and who died of a flu @-@ like illness . " Even healthy people can be affected , and serious problems from influenza can happen at any age . People over 50 years old , very young children and people of any age with chronic medical conditions are more likely to get complications from influenza , such as pneumonia , bronchitis , sinus , and ear infections . 
 In some cases , an autoimmune response to an influenza infection may contribute to the development of Guillain @-@ Barré syndrome . However , as many other infections can increase the risk of this disease , influenza may only be an important cause during epidemics . This syndrome has been believed to also be a rare side effect of influenza vaccines . One review gives an incidence of about one case per million vaccinations . Getting infected by influenza itself increases both the risk of death ( up to 1 in 10 @,@ 000 ) and increases the risk of developing GBS to a much higher level than the highest level of suspected vaccine involvement ( approx . 10 times higher by recent estimates ) . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 = = = Seasonal variations = = = 
 Influenza reaches peak prevalence in winter , and because the Northern and Southern Hemispheres have winter at different times of the year , there are actually two different flu seasons each year . This is why the World Health Organization ( assisted by the National Influenza Centers ) makes recommendations for two different vaccine formulations every year ; one for the Northern , and one for the Southern Hemisphere . 
 A long @-@ standing puzzle has been why outbreaks of the flu occur seasonally rather than uniformly throughout the year . One possible explanation is that , because people are indoors more often during the winter , they are in close contact more often , and this promotes transmission from person to person . Increased travel due to the Northern Hemisphere winter holiday season may also play a role . Another factor is that cold temperatures lead to drier air , which may dehydrate mucus , preventing the body from effectively expelling virus particles . The virus also survives longer on surfaces at colder temperatures and aerosol transmission of the virus is highest in cold environments ( less than 5 ° C ) with low relative humidity . The lower air humidity in winter seems to be the main cause of seasonal influenza transmission in temperate regions . 
 However , seasonal changes in infection rates also occur in tropical regions , and in some countries these peaks of infection are seen mainly during the rainy season . Seasonal changes in contact rates from school terms , which are a major factor in other childhood diseases such as measles and pertussis , may also play a role in the flu . A combination of these small seasonal effects may be amplified by dynamical resonance with the endogenous disease cycles . H5N1 exhibits seasonality in both humans and birds . 
 An alternative hypothesis to explain seasonality in influenza infections is an effect of vitamin D levels on immunity to the virus . This idea was first proposed by Robert Edgar Hope @-@ Simpson in 1965 . He proposed that the cause of influenza epidemics during winter may be connected to seasonal fluctuations of vitamin D , which is produced in the skin under the influence of solar ( or artificial ) UV radiation . This could explain why influenza occurs mostly in winter and during the tropical rainy season , when people stay indoors , away from the sun , and their vitamin D levels fall . 
 = = = Epidemic and pandemic spread = = = 
 As influenza is caused by a variety of species and strains of viruses , in any given year some strains can die out while others create epidemics , while yet another strain can cause a pandemic . Typically , in a year 's normal two flu seasons ( one per hemisphere ) , there are between three and five million cases of severe illness and around 500 @,@ 000 deaths worldwide , which by some definitions is a yearly influenza epidemic . Although the incidence of influenza can vary widely between years , approximately 36 @,@ 000 deaths and more than 200 @,@ 000 hospitalizations are directly associated with influenza every year in the United States . One method of calculating influenza mortality produced an estimate of 41 @,@ 400 average deaths per year in the United States between 1979 and 2001 . Different methods in 2010 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) reported a range from a low of about 3 @,@ 300 deaths to a high of 49 @,@ 000 per year . 
 Roughly three times per century , a pandemic occurs , which infects a large proportion of the world 's population and can kill tens of millions of people ( see pandemics section ) . One study estimated that if a strain with similar virulence to the 1918 influenza emerged today , it could kill between 50 and 80 million people . 
 New influenza viruses are constantly evolving by mutation or by reassortment . Mutations can cause small changes in the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens on the surface of the virus . This is called antigenic drift , which slowly creates an increasing variety of strains until one evolves that can infect people who are immune to the pre @-@ existing strains . This new variant then replaces the older strains as it rapidly sweeps through the human population , often causing an epidemic . However , since the strains produced by drift will still be reasonably similar to the older strains , some people will still be immune to them . In contrast , when influenza viruses reassort , they acquire completely new antigens — for example by reassortment between avian strains and human strains ; this is called antigenic shift . If a human influenza virus is produced that has entirely new antigens , everybody will be susceptible , and the novel influenza will spread uncontrollably , causing a pandemic . In contrast to this model of pandemics based on antigenic drift and shift , an alternative approach has been proposed where the periodic pandemics are produced by interactions of a fixed set of viral strains with a human population with a constantly changing set of immunities to different viral strains . 
 From a public health point of view , flu epidemics spread rapidly and are very difficult to control . Most influenza virus strains are not very infectious and each infected individual will only go on to infect one or two other individuals ( the basic reproduction number for influenza is generally around 1 @.@ 4 ) . However , the generation time for influenza is extremely short : the time from a person becoming infected to when he infects the next person is only two days . The short generation time means that influenza epidemics generally peak at around 2 months and burn out after 3 months : the decision to intervene in an influenza epidemic therefore has to be taken early , and the decision is therefore often made on the back of incomplete data . Another problem is that individuals become infectious before they become symptomatic , which means that putting people in quarantine after they become ill is not an effective public health intervention . For the average person , viral shedding tends to peak on day two whereas symptoms peak on day three .

 = = = Etymology = = = 
 The word Influenza comes from the Italian language meaning " influence " and refers to the cause of the disease ; initially , this ascribed illness to unfavorable astrological influences . Changes in medical thought led to its modification to influenza del <unk> , meaning " influence of the cold " . The word influenza was first used in English to refer to the disease we know today in 1703 by J. Hugger of the University of Edinburgh in his thesis De <unk> <unk> , vel Influenza , <unk> in India <unk> <unk> <unk> . Archaic terms for influenza include epidemic catarrh , <unk> ( from the French , first used by Molyneaux in 1694 ) , sweating sickness , and Spanish fever ( particularly for the 1918 flu pandemic strain ) . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The symptoms of human influenza were clearly described by Hippocrates roughly 2 @,@ 400 years ago . Although the virus seems to have caused epidemics throughout human history , historical data on influenza are difficult to interpret , because the symptoms can be similar to those of other respiratory diseases . The disease may have spread from Europe to the Americas as early as the European colonization of the Americas ; since almost the entire indigenous population of the Antilles was killed by an epidemic resembling influenza that broke out in 1493 , after the arrival of Christopher Columbus . 
 The first convincing record of an influenza pandemic was of an outbreak in 1580 , which began in Russia and spread to Europe via Africa . In Rome , over 8 @,@ 000 people were killed , and several Spanish cities were almost wiped out . <unk> continued sporadically throughout the 17th and 18th centuries , with the pandemic of 1830 – 1833 being particularly widespread ; it infected approximately a quarter of the people exposed . 
 The most famous and lethal outbreak was the 1918 flu pandemic ( Spanish flu pandemic ) ( type A influenza , H1N1 subtype ) , which lasted from 1918 to 1919 . It is not known exactly how many it killed , but estimates range from 50 to 100 million people . This pandemic has been described as " the greatest medical holocaust in history " and may have killed as many people as the Black Death . This huge death toll was caused by an extremely high infection rate of up to 50 % and the extreme severity of the symptoms , suspected to be caused by cytokine storms . Symptoms in 1918 were so unusual that initially influenza was misdiagnosed as dengue , cholera , or typhoid . One observer wrote , " One of the most striking of the complications was hemorrhage from mucous membranes , especially from the nose , stomach , and intestine . Bleeding from the ears and petechial hemorrhages in the skin also occurred . " The majority of deaths were from bacterial pneumonia , a secondary infection caused by influenza , but the virus also killed people directly , causing massive hemorrhages and edema in the lung . 
 The 1918 flu pandemic ( Spanish flu pandemic ) was truly global , spreading even to the Arctic and remote Pacific islands . The unusually severe disease killed between 2 and 20 % of those infected , as opposed to the more usual flu epidemic mortality rate of 0 @.@ 1 % . Another unusual feature of this pandemic was that it mostly killed young adults , with 99 % of pandemic influenza deaths occurring in people under 65 , and more than half in young adults 20 to 40 years old . This is unusual since influenza is normally most deadly to the very young ( under age 2 ) and the very old ( over age 70 ) . The total mortality of the 1918 – 1919 pandemic is not known , but it is estimated that 2 @.@ 5 % to 5 % of the world 's population was killed . As many as 25 million may have been killed in the first 25 weeks ; in contrast , HIV / AIDS has killed 25 million in its first 25 years . 
 Later flu pandemics were not so devastating . They included the 1957 Asian Flu ( type A , <unk> strain ) and the 1968 Hong Kong Flu ( type A , H3N2 strain ) , but even these smaller outbreaks killed millions of people . In later pandemics antibiotics were available to control secondary infections and this may have helped reduce mortality compared to the Spanish Flu of 1918 . 
 The first influenza virus to be isolated was from poultry , when in 1901 the agent causing a disease called " fowl plague " was passed through Chamberland filters , which have pores that are too small for bacteria to pass through . The etiological cause of influenza , the <unk> family of viruses , was first discovered in pigs by Richard Shope in 1931 . This discovery was shortly followed by the isolation of the virus from humans by a group headed by Patrick Laidlaw at the Medical Research Council of the United Kingdom in 1933 . However , it was not until Wendell Stanley first crystallized tobacco mosaic virus in 1935 that the non @-@ cellular nature of viruses was appreciated . 
 The first significant step towards preventing influenza was the development in 1944 of a killed @-@ virus vaccine for influenza by Thomas Francis , Jr .. This built on work by Australian Frank Macfarlane Burnet , who showed that the virus lost virulence when it was cultured in fertilized hen 's eggs . Application of this observation by Francis allowed his group of researchers at the University of Michigan to develop the first influenza vaccine , with support from the U.S. Army . The Army was deeply involved in this research due to its experience of influenza in World War I , when thousands of troops were killed by the virus in a matter of months . In comparison to vaccines , the development of anti @-@ influenza drugs has been slower , with amantadine being licensed in 1966 and , almost thirty years later , the next class of drugs ( the neuraminidase inhibitors ) being developed .

 Influenza produces direct costs due to lost productivity and associated medical treatment , as well as indirect costs of preventative measures . In the United States , influenza is responsible for a total cost of over $ 10 billion per year , while it has been estimated that a future pandemic could cause hundreds of billions of dollars in direct and indirect costs . However , the economic impacts of past pandemics have not been intensively studied , and some authors have suggested that the Spanish influenza actually had a positive long @-@ term effect on per @-@ capita income growth , despite a large reduction in the working population and severe short @-@ term depressive effects . Other studies have attempted to predict the costs of a pandemic as serious as the 1918 Spanish flu on the U.S. economy , where 30 % of all workers became ill , and 2 @.@ 5 % were killed . A 30 % sickness rate and a three @-@ week length of illness would decrease the gross domestic product by 5 % . Additional costs would come from medical treatment of 18 million to 45 million people , and total economic costs would be approximately $ 700 billion . 
 Preventative costs are also high . Governments worldwide have spent billions of U.S. dollars preparing and planning for a potential H5N1 avian influenza pandemic , with costs associated with purchasing drugs and vaccines as well as developing disaster drills and strategies for improved border controls . On 1 November 2005 , United States President George W. Bush unveiled the National Strategy to Safeguard Against the Danger of Pandemic Influenza backed by a request to Congress for $ 7 @.@ 1 billion to begin implementing the plan . Internationally , on 18 January 2006 , donor nations pledged US $ 2 billion to combat bird flu at the two @-@ day International Pledging Conference on Avian and Human Influenza held in China . 
 In an assessment of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic on selected countries in the Southern Hemisphere , data suggest that all countries experienced some time @-@ limited and / or geographically isolated socio / economic effects and a temporary decrease in tourism most likely due to fear of 2009 H1N1 disease . It is still too early to determine whether the H1N1 pandemic has caused any long @-@ term economic impacts .

 Research on influenza includes studies on molecular virology , how the virus produces disease ( pathogenesis ) , host immune responses , viral genomics , and how the virus spreads ( epidemiology ) . These studies help in developing influenza countermeasures ; for example , a better understanding of the body 's immune system response helps vaccine development , and a detailed picture of how influenza invades cells aids the development of antiviral drugs . One important basic research program is the Influenza Genome Sequencing Project , which is creating a library of influenza sequences ; this library should help clarify which factors make one strain more lethal than another , which genes most affect immunogenicity , and how the virus evolves over time . 
 Research into new vaccines is particularly important , as current vaccines are very slow and expensive to produce and must be reformulated every year . The sequencing of the influenza genome and recombinant DNA technology may accelerate the generation of new vaccine strains by allowing scientists to substitute new antigens into a previously developed vaccine strain . New technologies are also being developed to grow viruses in cell culture , which promises higher yields , less cost , better quality and surge capacity . Research on a universal influenza A vaccine , targeted against the external domain of the transmembrane viral M2 protein ( <unk> ) , is being done at the University of Ghent by Walter Fiers , Xavier <unk> and their team and has now successfully concluded Phase I clinical trials . There has been some research success towards a " universal flu vaccine " that produces antibodies against proteins on the viral coat which mutate less rapidly , and thus a single shot could potentially provide longer @-@ lasting protection . 
 A number of biologics , therapeutic vaccines and <unk> are also being investigated for treatment of infection caused by viruses . Therapeutic biologics are designed to activate the immune response to virus or antigens . Typically , biologics do not target metabolic pathways like anti @-@ viral drugs , but stimulate immune cells such as lymphocytes , macrophages , and / or antigen presenting cells , in an effort to drive an immune response towards a cytotoxic effect against the virus . Influenza models , such as murine influenza , are convenient models to test the effects of prophylactic and therapeutic biologics . For example , <unk> T @-@ Cell Immune Modulator inhibits viral growth in the murine model of influenza . 
 = = Other animals = = 
 Influenza infects many animal species , and transfer of viral strains between species can occur . Birds are thought to be the main animal reservoirs of influenza viruses . Sixteen forms of hemagglutinin and nine forms of neuraminidase have been identified . All known subtypes ( <unk> ) are found in birds , but many subtypes are endemic in humans , dogs , horses , and pigs ; populations of camels , ferrets , cats , seals , mink , and whales also show evidence of prior infection or exposure to influenza . Variants of flu virus are sometimes named according to the species the strain is endemic in or adapted to . The main variants named using this convention are : bird flu , human flu , swine flu , horse flu and dog flu . ( Cat flu generally refers to feline viral <unk> or feline <unk> and not infection from an influenza virus . ) In pigs , horses and dogs , influenza symptoms are similar to humans , with cough , fever and loss of appetite . The frequency of animal diseases are not as well @-@ studied as human infection , but an outbreak of influenza in harbor seals caused approximately 500 seal deaths off the New England coast in 1979 – 1980 . However , outbreaks in pigs are common and do not cause severe mortality . Vaccines have also been developed to protect poultry from avian influenza . These vaccines can be effective against multiple strains and are used either as part of a preventative strategy , or combined with culling in attempts to eradicate outbreaks . 
 = = = Bird flu = = = 
 Flu symptoms in birds are variable and can be unspecific . The symptoms following infection with low @-@ pathogenicity avian influenza may be as mild as ruffled feathers , a small reduction in egg production , or weight loss combined with minor respiratory disease . Since these mild symptoms can make diagnosis in the field difficult , tracking the spread of avian influenza requires laboratory testing of samples from infected birds . Some strains such as Asian <unk> are highly virulent to poultry and may cause more extreme symptoms and significant mortality . In its most highly pathogenic form , influenza in chickens and turkeys produces a sudden appearance of severe symptoms and almost 100 % mortality within two days . As the virus spreads rapidly in the crowded conditions seen in the intensive farming of chickens and turkeys , these outbreaks can cause large economic losses to poultry farmers . 
 An avian @-@ adapted , highly pathogenic strain of H5N1 ( called HPAI A ( H5N1 ) , for " highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of type A of subtype H5N1 " ) causes H5N1 flu , commonly known as " avian influenza " or simply " bird flu " , and is endemic in many bird populations , especially in Southeast Asia . This Asian lineage strain of HPAI A ( H5N1 ) is spreading globally . It is epizootic ( an epidemic in non @-@ humans ) and <unk> ( a disease affecting animals of many species , especially over a wide area ) , killing tens of millions of birds and spurring the culling of hundreds of millions of other birds in an attempt to control its spread . Most references in the media to " bird flu " and most references to H5N1 are about this specific strain . 
 At present , HPAI A ( H5N1 ) is an avian disease , and there is no evidence suggesting efficient human @-@ to @-@ human transmission of HPAI A ( H5N1 ) . In almost all cases , those infected have had extensive physical contact with infected birds . In the future , H5N1 may mutate or reassort into a strain capable of efficient human @-@ to @-@ human transmission . The exact changes that are required for this to happen are not well understood . However , due to the high lethality and virulence of H5N1 , its endemic presence , and its large and increasing biological host reservoir , the H5N1 virus was the world 's pandemic threat in the 2006 – 07 flu season , and billions of dollars are being raised and spent researching H5N1 and preparing for a potential influenza pandemic . 
 In March 2013 , the Chinese government reported three cases of H7N9 influenza infections in humans . Two of whom had died and the third was critically ill . Although the strain of the virus is not thought to spread efficiently between humans , by mid @-@ April , at least 82 persons had become ill from H7N9 , of which 17 had died . These cases include three small family clusters in Shanghai and one cluster between a neighboring girl and boy in Beijing , raising at least the possibility of human @-@ to @-@ human transmission . WHO points out that one cluster did not have two of the cases lab confirmed and further points out , as a matter of baseline information , that some viruses are able to cause limited human @-@ to @-@ human transmission under conditions of close contact but are not transmissible enough to cause large community outbreaks . 
 = = = Swine flu = = = 
 In pigs swine influenza produces fever , lethargy , sneezing , coughing , difficulty breathing and decreased appetite . In some cases the infection can cause abortion . Although mortality is usually low , the virus can produce weight loss and poor growth , causing economic loss to farmers . Infected pigs can lose up to 12 pounds of body weight over a 3- to 4 @-@ week period . Direct transmission of an influenza virus from pigs to humans is occasionally possible ( this is called zoonotic swine flu ) . In all , 50 human cases are known to have occurred since the virus was identified in the mid @-@ 20th century , which have resulted in six deaths . 
 In 2009 , a swine @-@ origin H1N1 virus strain commonly referred to as " swine flu " caused the 2009 flu pandemic , but there is no evidence that it is endemic to pigs ( i.e. actually a swine flu ) or of transmission from pigs to people , instead the virus is spreading from person to person . This strain is a reassortment of several strains of H1N1 that are usually found separately , in humans , birds , and pigs . 
 = Abu Bakar of Johor = 
 Sultan Sir Abu Bakar Ibni Al @-@ <unk> Tun Temenggung Raja Daing Ibrahim ( 3 February 1833 – 4 June 1895 ) ( Jawi : <unk> سلطان <unk> <unk> بكر ابن <unk> <unk> <unk> إبراهيم <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , also known as Albert Baker [ 1 ] , the Temenggong of Johor . Informally , he was known as “ Father of Modern Johor ” . He was the 1st Sultan of Modern Johor , the 21st Sultan of Johor and the first Maharaja of Johor from the House of Temenggong . He was also informally known as " The Father of Modern Johor " , as many historians accredited Johor 's development in the 19th century to Abu Bakar 's leadership . He initiated policies and provided aids to ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs to stimulate the development of the state 's agricultural economy which was founded by Chinese migrants from Southern China in the 1840s . He also took charge of the development of Johor 's infrastructure , administrative system , military and civil service , all of which were modelled closely along Western lines . 
 Abu Bakar was noted for his diplomatic skills , and both the British and Malay rulers had approached him for advice in making important decisions . He was also an avid traveller , and became the first Malay ruler to travel to Europe during his first visit to England in 1866 . In particular , Abu Bakar became a lifetime friend of Queen Victoria in his later years . Abu Bakar 's friendship with Queen Victoria played an important role in shaping Johor 's relationships with Britain , and was the only state by the end of the 19th century in the Peninsular Malaya to maintain autonomy in its internal affairs as the British Colonial Government pushed for greater control over the Malay states by placing a British Resident in the states . He was also an Anglophile , and many of his personal habits and decisions were aligned to European ideas and tastes . 
 Abu Bakar became the sovereign ruler of Johor when his father , Temenggong Daing Ibrahim died in 1862 . Six years later , Abu Bakar changed his legal state title of " Temenggong " to " Maharaja " . In 1885 , Abu Bakar sought legal recognition from Britain for another change in his legal state title of " Maharaja " to a regnal title of " Sultan " , and was proclaimed the following year . In all , Abu Bakar 's reign lasted for thirty @-@ two years until his death in 1895 . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Wan Abu Bakar was born on 3 February 1833 in Teluk <unk> ( the present Telok Blangah ) , Singapore . He was the oldest son of Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim , who in turn was a matrilineal descendant of Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah IV , the first Sultan of Johor 's Bendahara dynasty . Abu Bakar spent his childhood years in his father 's kampung in Teluk Blanga ; at a young age he was tutored by local teachers on Islam and <unk> ( traditional Malay law ) , before he was sent to the Teluk Blanga Malay school , a mission school run by Reverend Benjamin Peach <unk> . Under the guidance of the missionary teachers , Abu Bakar was observed to develop the manners of an English gentleman , and the ability to speak fluent English in addition to his native Malay . 
 In 1851 , the Temenggong delegated Abu Bakar , then an eighteen @-@ year @-@ old youth , to assist him in negotiation efforts against Sultan Ali , who was making frivolous attempts to claim sovereignty rights over Johor . As the Temenggong aged , he gradually delegated his state administrative duties to Abu Bakar . During this period , several British officers praised of Abu Bakar 's excellent diplomatic skills , as mentioned in William Napier 's diaries , who was the senior law agent of Singapore . Napier had accompanied Abu Bakar to fetch Tengku Teh , the mother of the deposed Sultan of Lingga , Mahmud Muzaffar Shah to Johor shortly after her son began to exert sovereignty claims over Pahang . 
 The outbreak of the Pahang Civil War the following year saw Abu Bakar befriending Tun Mutahir , whom he provided support for his war efforts . Abu Bakar married Mutahir 's daughter in 1860 during a visit in Pahang , and the following year he signed a treaty of friendship , alliance and a guarantee of mutual support with Mutahir in 1861 . Meanwhile , Temenggong Ibrahim was already suffering from a prolonged period of ill health , and a bout of high fever resulted in his death on 31 January 1862 .

 = = = Years as Temenggong ( 1862 – 1868 ) = = = 
 Abu Bakar assumed office as the Temenggong of Johor within three days of his father 's demise . At the time of his succession , Johor was facing a political threat from the deposed Sultan , Mahmud Muzaffar Shah . The Sultan was pursuing his sovereignty claims over Johor and Pahang and aimed to overthrow the Sultan of Terengganu with the backing of Siam . Mahmud Muzaffar Shah established an alliance with Tun Ahmad , half @-@ brother and rival of the Bendahara Tun Koris . The alliance caused Abu Bakar concern that the fall of Tun Koris in Pahang would threaten his own political position in Johor . Abu Bakar signed a treaty of friendship with Tun Koris in June 1862 , and sent a small expeditionary force to Pahang to support Tun Koris when war broke out in August 1862 . 
 During the first two years of his reign , Abu Bakar began issuing Western @-@ style contracts ( termed as Surat Sungai in Malay , literally " River Documents " ) to the Kapitan Cina ( Chinese leaders ) who had established riverside plantations along in Johor . Letters of authority ( Surat <unk> ) were issued when the first Chinese leaders began settling in Johor during the 1850s . Abu Bakar quickly established goodwill relations with the Kapitan Cina ; a Malay administrator who could speak the Teochew dialect ( the language spoken by most Kapitan Cina ) and read Chinese was employed for these purposes . He also employed the service of a Chinese contractor from <unk> , Wong Ah Fook , to oversee the construction of Istana Besar . 
 Various Chinese dialect groups began to compete for commercial interests in the 1850s and 1860s . This led to communal violence . Abu Bakar and the Kapitan Cina in Johor ( who were mainly migrants from Chaozhou ) tried to assimilate Chinese entrepreneurs of non @-@ Teochew origin . Abu Bakar gave official recognition and support for the Johor branch of the Ngee Ann Kongsi , which was seen as a secret society in Singapore at that time . As Johor prospered from the large revenues generated from the gambier and pepper plantations managed by the Kapitan Cina , Abu Bakar gave generous provisions to the Kapitan Cina in recognition for their contributions to the state ; among his beneficiaries was a long @-@ time family friend , Tan Hiok Nee , who was given a seat in the state council . The plantations operated relatively independently of the state government , and Abu Bakar was worried by the possible danger to the plantations in the event of an economic crisis . Shortly after a financial crisis broke out in Singapore in 1864 , Abu Bakar imposed new regulations on these plantations , as many of them were owned by Chinese businessmen from Singapore . The Kapitan Cina and the Singapore Chamber of Commerce were particularly disturbed by the new regulations , and accused Abu Bakar of attempting to impose a trade monopoly over Johor . The British government pressured Abu Bakar to retract the regulations , which he did in January 1866 . In addition , the Kapitan Cina also faced considerable difficulties in securing new agreements with Abu Bakar . The crisis was only resolved in 1866 after Abu Bakar designated five new ports for the registration of cargo , and the British softened their animosity against Abu Bakar . 
 Abu Bakar 's relationship with the ruler of Muar , Sultan Ali was strained . Soon after Abu Bakar succeeded his father , he sent a letter to Sultan Ali asserting Johor 's sovereignty over Segamat , which Sultan Ali had hoped to exert political influence over . In addition , Sultan Ali , who had borrowed a large sum from an Indian moneylender in 1860 , became a source of irritation for Abu Bakar . Facing difficulties in repaying his debt , Sultan Ali asked Abu Bakar to pay Ali 's monthly pension to the moneylender ; but he alternated asking for payment to himself and to the moneylender . In 1866 , when the moneylender lodged a complaint with the British government , Sultan Ali tried to borrow from Abu Bakar to repay his outstanding debts . As a result of these constant irritations , Abu Bakar persuaded the Straits Governor to sign an agreement to terminate Sultan Ali 's pension at the agreement of Abu Bakar and Governor . 
 Abu Bakar made revisions to Johor 's Islamic code in 1863 , after the Sultan of Terengganu <unk> his state 's Islamic judicial <unk> to be more closely aligned with Sharia law . In a letter to the Straits Governor , Abu Bakar expressed hope that his revisions would suit more comfortably with European ideas . He founded an English school in Tanjung Puteri in 1864 . Two years later , Abu Bakar moved the administrative headquarters to Tanjung Puteri , and officially renamed it as Johor Bahru . A new administration was set up , which was modelled after European styles and certain elements of a traditional Malay government . He recruited some of his close relatives and his classmates from the Teluk Blanga Malay school into the bureaucracy , and also set up an advisory council which included two Chinese leaders . In the early 1870s , Straits Governor Sir Harry Ord said of Abu Bakar ( who became a Maharaja in 1868 ) that he was the " only Raja in the whole peninsula or adjoining states who rules in accordance with the practice of civilized nations . " 
 = = = Years as Maharaja ( 1868 – 1885 ) = = = 
 During a state visit to England in 1866 , Abu Bakar was commonly addressed as the " Maharaja " of Johor and led him to realise that the Malay title of Temenggong was hardly known to the Western World . He contemplated a change of another title , which led him to send his cousin , Ungku Haji Muhammad and the Dato <unk> , Dato Jaafar to meet the Bugis historian , Raja Ali Haji who was residing in Riau . Raja Ali supported Abu Bakar 's cause , after they did a cross examination and concluded that the past office holders had wielded actual control over the affairs of Johor , rather than the Sultans of the Bendahara dynasty . In addition , questions pertaining to Abu Bakar 's pursuits to clamour for recognition were also sidelined as he was able to trace his ancestry to the first Sultan of the Bendahara dynasty , Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah IV by his patrilineal ancestors . The Sultan of Lingga , gave his approval for a formal recognition of Abu Bakar as the Maharaja of Johor , after Ungku Haji and Dato Jaafar travelled to Lingga and presented their claims . Abu Bakar also secured approval from the Governor of the Straits Settlements for his change in title , and was officially proclaimed as the Maharaja of Johor on 30 June 1868 . 
 Shortly after his proclamation as Maharaja , Abu Bakar laid plans for the construction of a wooden railway between Johor Bahru and Gunung Pulai after some Europeans had raised proposals to set up a retreat and sanatorium . Construction of the railway started in July 1869 and construction of the first phase was completed in 1874 , which ran between Skudai and Johor Bahru . The construction project was later halted after an accident which saw a locomotive falling off the tracks as a result of termite attacks on the wooden tracks within the Skudai portion and a shortage of funds . 
 In the mid @-@ 1870s , the Straits Governor , William Jervois contemplated on placing Maharaja Abu Bakar as the overlord of the chiefs in Negeri Sembilan after the British failed to quell the sectarian violence in Sungai Ujong . Abu Bakar 's client , Tunku <unk> was placed as the Yam Tuan of the Sri <unk> confederacy ( comprising several small states within the region ) , and Abu Bakar was made the adviser of Negeri Sembilan ( except Sungai Ujong ) in 1878 . Abu Bakar was believed to have nursed expansionist ambitions , which was suggested by his involvement in the Pahang Civil War between 1857 and 1864 . A later governor , Frederick Weld , aspired for stronger British control over the Malay states and was weary of Abu Bakar 's influence . The chiefs were lukewarm to the prospect of Johor 's sphere of influence over Negeri Sembilan , and in 1881 Weld convinced the chiefs within the Sri <unk> confederacy to deal directly with Singapore rather than with Abu Bakar . British officers were also appointed to oversee the affairs in 1883 and 1887 , and were gradually given the powers similar to that of a British resident . 
 After Sultan Ali 's death in 1877 , the Raja Temenggong of Muar and its village chieftains voted in favour of a merger of Muar with Johor following a succession dispute between two of Sultan Ali 's sons . Sultan Ali 's oldest son , Tengku Alam , disputed the legitimacy of the chieftains ' wishes and staked his hereditary claims over Muar . Tengku Alam instigated the 1879 <unk> Civil War in a bid to reclaim Muar , but was quickly crushed by the Maharaja 's forces . During the 1880s , Abu Bakar actively encouraged the Chinese leaders to set up new gambier and pepper plantations in Muar . 
 Meanwhile , Weld 's continued efforts to keep Abu Bakar 's political influence in check and relations between Johor and Singapore became increasingly strained . Abu Bakar was reportedly said to be increasingly reluctant to accept advice from the British @-@ appointed state lawyers , and increasingly turned to his private lawyers which he had employed . Weld voiced his intent to place a Resident in Johor , which prompted Abu Bakar to make a trip to England in August 1884 to negotiate new terms with the British Colonial Office . The Assistant Under @-@ Secretary of the Colonial Office , Robert Meade , conceded to Abu Bakar 's request for an absence of a British Resident in Johor , although Abu Bakar gave an in @-@ principle acceptance for a British adviser in Johor ( though none was appointed until 1914 ) . An agreement was drawn up , and Abu Bakar was promised control over internal affairs in exchange for British control over foreign affairs pertaining to the state . 
 = = = Years as Sultan ( 1885 – 1895 ) = = = 
 The Bendahara of Pahang , Wan Ahmad , was proclaimed Sultan in 1881 . Abu Bakar , who was weary of the increasingly hostile political environment imposed by Weld , considered the importance of the superior moral authority that was accorded to a " Sultan " than to a " Maharaja " . In 1885 , Abu Bakar instituted the creation of a state postal and judiciary system modelled along British lines , as well as a military force , the Johor Military Forces ( Malay : Askar <unk> Setia ) upon his return to Johor . 
 During his stay in London in late 1885 , Abu Bakar expressed his desire to Meade for a formal recognition as the Sultan of Johor . He also met up with Queen Victoria , who had become a personal friend of Abu Bakar , within the same course of his visit . Queen Victoria consented to his wishes , and a treaty was signed on 11 December 1885 which formalised relations between Great Britain and Johor , was concluded between Abu Bakar and the Colonial Office . Abu Bakar also founded the state advisory board in London , which was intended to oversee state interests in London . Several retired officers from the Colonial Office , including William Fielding and Cecil Smith were personally appointed by Abu Bakar to oversee the board 's administration . 
 The formal recognition of Abu Bakar by the British as the Sultan of Johor quickly drew criticisms among the Malays in Johor . A pantun circulated among the Malays in Johor , which poked jibes at Abu Bakar 's background , became very popular . Many Malays were coy on accepting Abu Bakar as their paramount ruler , as they were sceptical of Abu Bakar 's Temenggong political origins and Buginese heritage . Furthermore , his affinity with Western culture did not go down well with the culturally @-@ conservative Malays . A proclamation ceremony was held on 13 February 1886 , whereby Abu Bakar made an official announcement on his adoption of the title " Sultan " in place of " Maharaja " . In the same year on 31 July , Abu Bakar instituted the first state decorations , Darjah <unk> Yang <unk> <unk> ( also translated into English as " The Most <unk> Family Order of Johor " ) and the Seri Paduka Mahkota Johor ( Order of the Crown of Johor ) . 
 Abu Bakar employed the service of a Chinese contractor and long @-@ time acquaintance , Wong Ah Fook , to oversee the development of Johor Bahru . The Johor Archives showed that Wong was the largest building contractor at that time and had been involved in at least twenty public works projects between 1887 and 1895 . In addition , Wong was contracted to oversee the construction of the state mosque and several palaces under the direction of Abu Bakar . As a gratitude to Wong 's contributions to the state , Abu Bakar granted him a plot of land in the heart of Johor Bahru in 1892 . Wong then oversaw the construction of a village , Kampong Ah Fook , as well as a road , Jalan Wong Ah Fook on the land that he was granted . 
 Abu Bakar <unk> the Johor State Establishment Constitution ( Malay : Undang @-@ undang <unk> Negeri Johor ) on 14 April 1895 . The state 's constitution was seen as a turning point by many as a step in laying the groundwork for the administration of Johor . It was suggested that Abu Bakar , who was fearful of his possible <unk> death in light of his failing health , promogulated the state constitution with the intent of preserving the state 's independence in the light of growing British political influence in the Malay states .

 Abu Bakar made his inaugural state visit while he was still a Temenggong . He toured England in 1866 with Dato ' Jaafar , and met with members of the English royalty , notably Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales , Prince Edward . The Queen conferred Abu Bakar with the Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India ( KCSI ) , which he valued highly . The trip reportedly gave both Abu Bakar and Dato ' Jaafar lasting memories of England , and inspired Abu Bakar to develop Johor along British lines . Nine years later , Abu Bakar travelled to Calcutta to meet up with Prince Edward who was then spending his time in the city . The following year , Prince Edward conferred Abu Bakar the Prince of Wales 's Gold medal . He made another trip to London in 1878 , where he was invited to attend the State Ball at Buckingham Palace . Abu Bakar 's palaces were modelled closely along British lines ; when Prince George and Prince Albert Victor visited Johor in the 1880s , they had commented that the huge drawing room of Abu Bakar 's palace closely resembled the state @-@ rooms found at Windsor Castle . He was also an avid polo player , and had raced with the princes during their state visits to Johor . The Duke of Sutherland also praised Abu Bakar 's hospitality during his state visit after he became Sultan , and had reportedly enjoyed the Malay cuisine which the Abu Bakar had served to him . 
 In particular , Queen Victoria became a close friend of Abu Bakar especially during his later years . During a visit to England in February 1891 , Abu Bakar was personally received by the Queen , and was invited to dine and stay with the Queen at Windsor Castle . Queen Victoria held Abu Bakar in very high esteem , which she had signed herself off as an " affectionate friend " in a letter to Abu Bakar in March 1891 . Reportedly , Queen Victoria was quoted to have highly valued the silver model Albert Memorial which Abu Bakar sent to her during her Golden Jubilee in 1887 . Shortly before his death in May 1895 , Queen Victoria sent her personal physician to attend to Abu Bakar 's medical needs , who was by then very ill when he arrived in London .

 Abu Bakar visited Ottoman Turkey during his European tour in 1866 , where he met Sultan Abdülaziz . The Sultan presented <unk> <unk> , a Circassian princess to Abu Bakar as a gift . <unk> <unk> married Ungku Abdul Majid , a brother of Abu Bakar after she arrived to Johor , and later remarried Dato Jaafar ( whom accompanied Abu Bakar during his 1866 trip ) after Ungku Majid 's death . During his second visit to England in August 1878 , Abu Bakar wrote to Colonel Anson from South Kensington of his wishes to visit European royalties in Paris , Vienna and Italy . He visited Paris and Vienna and was given a warm reception by Prince Henry of Liechtenstein before he returned to Johor . Three years later , he visited Prussia , where he was conferred the Royal Prussian Order of the Crown . He made two separate European tours in 1891 and 1893 with a personal physician by his side , during which he met Emperor Francis Joseph , King Umberto , Pope Leo XIII and Sultan Abdul Hamid II , and was conferred the awards of Commander of the Cross of Italy , Imperial Order of the <unk> ( Turkey ) and the Commander of the Cross of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha . 
 In 1881 , Abu Bakar also visited Java , which was under Dutch rule . In the same year , he travelled to Hawaii and met King Kalākaua , where he was conferred the Grand Cross of the Order of Kalakaua I of <unk> and State Secretary , Muhammad Salleh . The Emperor of China , Guangxu , bestowed upon him the First Class Order of the Double Dragon for his just treatment of the Chinese in Johor .

 Abu Bakar married his first wife , Engku Chik during his stay in Pahang in 1857 . Abu Bakar was related to Engku Chik by family ties ; Engku Chik was the sister of Tun Koris , who was also a brother @-@ in @-@ law to Abu Bakar . Abu Bakar had a daughter with Engku Chik , Tunku Besar Putri . He also had a son , Tunku Ibrahim , and a daughter , Tunku Mariam with his second wife Cecilia Catherina Lange , who was the daughter of a Danish trader , Mads Johansen Lange and his Chinese wife <unk> <unk> . Lange met Abu Bakar while she was in Singapore , and adopted the Muslim name of " Zubaidah " after her marriage to Abu Bakar in 1870 . In 1885 , Abu Bakar married a Chinese woman of Cantonese heritage , Wong Ah <unk> , with whom he had a daughter , Tunku <unk> . Wong took on the Muslim name of " Fatimah " at her marriage to Abu Bakar , and was crowned the Sultanah in July 1886 . Abu Bakar held Wong in very high esteem , who became Abu Bakar 's confidant pertaining to his involvement in state affairs . Wong became a close friend of Abu Bakar 's building contractor , Wong Ah Fook as they shared a common surname and dialect group . Wong died in 1891 . During his state visit to the Ottoman Empire in September 1893 , Abu Bakar married his fourth wife , Khadijah <unk> , who was of Circassian heritage . ( Khadijah 's sister , <unk> , became the wife of Abu Bakar 's brother and later the wife of the first Menteri Besar of Johor , Dato ' Jaafar . ) He had a daughter , Tunku Fatimah with Khadijah the following February , who was later crowned as the Sultanah of Johor . 
 = = Death = = 
 In early May 1895 , Abu Bakar travelled to London together with his son and successor , Tunku Ibrahim ( later Sultan Ibrahim ) with the hope to mustering support and recognition of his rule . He was by then already very ill and was already suffering from an inflammation of the kidneys for sometime and diagnosed with Bright 's disease ( a type of kidney disease ) . At the <unk> of the voyage in early May , he became very weak , and had to be carried aboard a ship in a wheelchair . He reached London on 10 May , and checked into Bailey 's Hotel but was bedridden throughout his remaining days . He was not allowed to receive many visitors , though the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn , Prince Arthur paid two visits . Queen Victoria sent her personal physician , Douglas Powell to attend to his medical needs upon receiving news of his illness . 
 Abu Bakar contracted pneumonia during his stay in the hotel , which led to his demise on the evening of 4 June 1895 . His body was then brought back to Johor by an English man @-@ of @-@ war from Penang . A state funeral was given to Abu Bakar , and he was laid to rest at the royal mausoleum at <unk> <unk> on 7 September 1895 . His son , Tunku Ibrahim was later installed as the Sultan of Johor in November 1895 . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Abu Bakar was often accredited as the " Founder of Modern Johor " ( Malay : Bapa <unk> Johor ) . He established a Western @-@ styled bureaucratic system and civil service , and consolidated the state 's agricultural economy , which consisted of gambier and pepper plantations headed by Chinese leaders , known as " Kangchu " in the Teochew dialect . The gambier and pepper plantations were first introduced during the 1840s by Chinese immigrants . Often , Abu Bakar was called in by Malay rulers from neighbouring states to provide advise in the event when the rulers had to make important decisions . In particular , he became a close confidante of the Sultan of Pahang , Wan Ahmad in 1887 , with whom Abu Bakar had persuaded Sultan Ahmad to accept a British consultant instead of a Resident . The Colonial Government at that time was seeking for greater control over the Malay States and was making vociferous attempts to impose British Residents into the Malay states . The Colonial Government also made a failed attempt to impose a British Resident in Johor in 1885 ; the state maintained its independence in its internal affairs until 1914 . 
 Abu Bakar was also the first Malay ruler to visit Europe in 1866 . He was an Anglophile , and mingled comfortably with the Europeans . The British governor , Sir Harry Ord had once written to the Secretary of State of Great Britain and described Abu Bakar as an " English gentleman " in his tastes and habits . Abu Bakar had gained his share of critics , especially among the more conservative Malay scholars who were critical of his Western tastes . Abu Bakar 's penchant for an extravagant lifestyle and foreign travel resulted in a depleted state treasury at the time of his death in 1895 . At least one scholar , <unk> Nadarajah , had suggested that Johor 's loss of independence in the early 20th century was attributed to this depleted state treasury . In addition , Nadarajah also believed that the loss of Johor 's independence was also attributed to Abu Bakar 's failure of giving attention to his young son , Tunku Ibrahim , who lacked proper education and training in the art of state administration and diplomacy when he succeeded his father as the Sultan of Johor in his early twenties . 
 Many state 's buildings which were constructed during Abu Bakar 's reign were modelled after British Victorian and Moorish architectural styles . Abu Bakar placed the construction of these state buildings under close supervision , and was often called in to lay the foundation stones of these buildings personally . A few of these buildings were named after Abu Bakar himself , notably the Sultan Abu Bakar State Mosque ( Malay : Masjid Negeri Sultan Abu Bakar ) , which was built between 1892 and 1900 .

 = Urban heat island = 
 An urban heat island ( UHI ) is a city or metropolitan area that is significantly warmer than its surrounding rural areas due to human activities . The phenomenon was first investigated and described by Luke Howard in the 1810s , although he was not the one to name the phenomenon . The temperature difference usually is larger at night than during the day , and is most apparent when winds are weak . UHI is most noticeable during the summer and winter . The main cause of the urban heat island effect is from the modification of land surfaces . Waste heat generated by energy usage is a secondary contributor . As a population center grows , it tends to expand its area and increase its average temperature . The less @-@ used term heat island refers to any area , populated or not , which is consistently hotter than the surrounding area . 
 Monthly rainfall is greater downwind of cities , partially due to the UHI . Increases in heat within urban centers increases the length of growing seasons , and decreases the occurrence of weak tornadoes . The UHI decreases air quality by increasing the production of pollutants such as ozone , and decreases water quality as warmer waters flow into area streams and put stress on their ecosystems . 
 Not all cities have a distinct urban heat island . Mitigation of the urban heat island effect can be accomplished through the use of green roofs and the use of lighter @-@ colored surfaces in urban areas , which reflect more sunlight and absorb less heat . 
 There are concerns raised about possible contribution from urban heat islands to global warming . Research on China and India indicates that urban heat island effect contributes to climate warming by about 30 % . On the other hand , one 1999 comparison between urban and rural areas proposed that the urban heat island effects have little influence on global mean temperature trends . Many studies reveal increases in the severity of the effect with the progress of climate change . 
 = = Causes = = 
 There are several causes of an urban heat island ( UHI ) ; for example , dark surfaces absorb significantly more solar radiation , which causes urban concentrations of roads and buildings to heat more than suburban and rural areas during the day ; materials commonly used in urban areas for pavement and roofs , such as concrete and asphalt , have significantly different thermal bulk properties ( including heat capacity and thermal conductivity ) and surface radiative properties ( albedo and emissivity ) than the surrounding rural areas . This causes a change in the energy budget of the urban area , often leading to higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas . Another major reason is the lack of evapotranspiration ( for example , through lack of vegetation ) in urban areas . With a decreased amount of vegetation , cities also lose the shade and cooling effect of trees , and the removal of carbon dioxide . 
 Other causes of a UHI are due to geometric effects . The tall buildings within many urban areas provide multiple surfaces for the reflection and absorption of sunlight , increasing the efficiency with which urban areas are heated . This is called the " urban canyon effect " . Another effect of buildings is the blocking of wind , which also inhibits cooling by convection and prevents pollution from dissipating . Waste heat from automobiles , air conditioning , industry , and other sources also contributes to the UHI . High levels of pollution in urban areas can also increase the UHI , as many forms of pollution change the radiative properties of the atmosphere . As UHI raises the temperature of cities , it also increases the concentration of ozone , a greenhouse gas whose production accelerates with an increase in temperature . 
 Some cities exhibit a heat island effect , largest at night . Seasonally , UHI shows up both in summer and winter . The typical temperature difference is several degrees between the center of the city and surrounding fields . The difference in temperature between an inner city and its surrounding suburbs is frequently mentioned in weather reports , as in " 68 ° F ( 20 ° C ) downtown , 64 ° F ( 18 ° C ) in the suburbs " . " The annual mean air temperature of a city with 1 million people or more can be 1 @.@ 8 – 5 @.@ 4 ° F ( 1 @.@ 0 – 3 @.@ 0 ° C ) warmer than its surroundings . In the evening , the difference can be as high as 22 ° F ( 12 ° C ) . " 
 = = Diurnal behavior = = 
 The IPCC stated that " it is well @-@ known that compared to non @-@ urban areas urban heat islands raise night @-@ time temperatures more than daytime temperatures . " For example , Barcelona , Spain is 0 @.@ 2 ° C ( 0 @.@ 4 ° F ) cooler for daily maxima and 2 @.@ 9 ° C ( 5 @.@ 2 ° F ) warmer for minima than a nearby rural station . A description of the very first report of the UHI by Luke Howard in the late 1810s said that the urban center of London was warmer at night than the surrounding countryside by 3 @.@ 7 ° F ( 2 @.@ 1 ° C ) . Though the warmer air temperature within the UHI is generally most apparent at night , urban heat islands exhibit significant and somewhat paradoxical diurnal behavior . The air temperature difference between the UHI and the surrounding environment is large at night and small during the day . The opposite is true for skin temperatures of the urban landscape within the UHI . 
 Throughout the daytime , particularly when the skies are free of clouds , urban surfaces are warmed by the absorption of solar radiation . Surfaces in the urban areas tend to warm faster than those of the surrounding rural areas . By virtue of their high heat capacities , urban surfaces act as a giant reservoir of heat energy . For example , concrete can hold roughly 2 @,@ 000 times as much heat as an equivalent volume of air . As a result , the large daytime surface temperature within the UHI is easily seen via thermal remote sensing . As is often the case with daytime heating , this warming also has the effect of generating convective winds within the urban boundary layer . It is theorized that , due to the atmospheric mixing that results , the air temperature perturbation within the UHI is generally minimal or nonexistent during the day , though the surface temperatures can reach extremely high levels . 
 At night , the situation reverses . The absence of solar heating causes the atmospheric convection to decrease , and the urban boundary layer begins to stabilize . If enough stabilization occurs , an inversion layer is formed . This traps urban air near the surface , and keeping surface air warm from the still @-@ warm urban surfaces , forming the nighttime warmer air temperatures within the UHI . Other than the heat retention properties of urban areas , the nighttime maximum in urban canyons could also be due to the blocking of " sky view " during cooling : surfaces lose heat at night principally by radiation to the comparatively cool sky , and this is blocked by the buildings in an urban area . Radiative cooling is more dominant when wind speed is low and the sky is cloudless , and indeed the UHI is found to be largest at night in these conditions . 
 = = Prediction = = 
 If a city or town has a good system of taking weather observations the UHI can be measured directly . An alternative is to use a complex simulation of the location to calculate the UHI , or to use an approximate empirical method Such models than allow the UHI to be included in estimates of future temperatures rises within cities due to climate change . 
 Professor Leonard O. <unk> , University of California at Davis , developed and published in 1969 the first comprehensive numerical treatment to predict the effects of the urban heat island ( UHI ) . His paper published in the American Meteorological Society 's Journal of Applied Meteorology surveys UHI and criticizes then @-@ existing theories as being excessively qualitative . A general purpose , numerical energy budget model is described and applied to the urban atmosphere . Calculations for several special cases as well as a sensitivity analysis are presented . The model is found to predict the correct order of magnitude of the urban temperature excess . The heat island effect is found to be the net result of several competing physical processes . In general , reduced evaporation in the city center and the thermal properties of the city building and paving materials are the dominant parameters . It is suggested that such a model could be used in engineering calculations to improve the climate of existing and future cities . 
 = = Impact on animals = = 
 Ant colonies in urban heat islands have an increased heat tolerance at no cost to cold tolerance . 
 Species that are good at colonizing can utilize conditions provided by urban heat islands to thrive in regions outside of their normal range . Examples of this include grey @-@ headed flying fox ( Pteropus poliocephalus ) and the common house gecko ( Hemidactylus frenatus ) . Grey @-@ headed flying foxes , found in Melbourne Australia , colonized urban habitats following increase in temperatures there . Increased temperatures , causing warmer winter conditions , made the city more similar in climate to the more northerly wildland habitat of the species . 
 With attempts to mitigate and manage urban heat islands , Temperature changes and availability of food and water are reduced . With temperate climates , urban heat islands will extend the growing season , therefore altering breeding strategies of inhabiting species . This can be seen the best in the effects that urban heat islands have on water temperature . With the temperature of the nearby buildings sometimes reaching over 50 degrees different from the near @-@ surface air temperature , precipitation will warm rapidly , causing runoff into nearby streams , lakes and rivers ( or other bodies of water ) to provide excessive thermal pollution . The increase in the thermal pollution has the ability to increase water temperature by 20 to 30 degrees . This increase will cause the fish species inhabiting the body of water to undergo thermal stress and shock due to the rapid change in temperature to their climate . 
 Urban heat islands caused by cities have altered the natural selection process . Selective pressures like temporal variation in food , predation and water are relaxed causing for a new set of selective forces to roll out . For example , within urban habitats , insects are more abundant than in rural areas . Insects are ectotherms . This means that they depend on the temperature of the environment to control their body temperature , making for the warmer climates of the city perfect for their ability to thrive . A study done in Raleigh North Carolina conducted on <unk> <unk> ( oak scales ) , showed that this particular species preferred warmer climates and were therefore found in higher abundance in the urban habitats than on oak trees in rural habitats . Over time of living in urban habitats , they have adapted to thrive in warmer climates than in cooler . 
 The presence of non @-@ native species is heavily dependent on the amount of human activity . An example of this can be seen in the populations of cliff swallows seen taking nests under the eaves of homes in urban habitats . They make their homes using the shelter provided by the humans in the upper regions of homes , allowing for an influx in their populations due to added protection and reduced predator numbers . 
 = = Other impacts on weather and climate = = 
 Aside from the effect on temperature , UHIs can produce secondary effects on local meteorology , including the altering of local wind patterns , the development of clouds and fog , the humidity , and the rates of precipitation . The extra heat provided by the UHI leads to greater upward motion , which can induce additional shower and thunderstorm activity . In addition , the UHI creates during the day a local low pressure area where relatively moist air from its rural surroundings converges , possibly leading to more favorable conditions for cloud formation . Rainfall rates downwind of cities are increased between 48 % and 116 % . Partly as a result of this warming , monthly rainfall is about 28 % greater between 20 miles ( 32 km ) to 40 miles ( 64 km ) downwind of cities , compared with upwind . Some cities show a total precipitation increase of 51 % . 
 Research has been done in a few areas suggesting that metropolitan areas are less susceptible to weak tornadoes due to the turbulent mixing caused by the warmth of the urban heat island . Using satellite images , researchers discovered that city climates have a noticeable influence on plant growing seasons up to 10 kilometers ( 6 @.@ 2 miles ) away from a city 's edges . Growing seasons in 70 cities in eastern North America were about 15 days longer in urban areas compared to rural areas outside of a city 's influence . 
 = = Health effects = = 
 UHIs have the potential to directly influence the health and welfare of urban residents . Within the United States alone , an average of 1 @,@ 000 people die each year due to extreme heat . As UHIs are characterized by increased temperature , they can potentially increase the magnitude and duration of heat waves within cities . Research has found that the mortality rate during a heat wave increases exponentially with the maximum temperature , an effect that is exacerbated by the UHI . The nighttime effect of UHIs can be particularly harmful during a heat wave , as it deprives urban residents of the cool relief found in rural areas during the night . 
 Research in the United States suggests that the relationship between extreme temperature and mortality varies by location . Heat is more likely to increase the risk of mortality in cities at mid @-@ latitudes and high latitudes with significant annual temperature variation . For example , when Chicago , New York and Philadelphia experience unusually hot summertime temperatures , elevated levels of illness and death are predicted . In contrast , parts of the country that are mild to hot year @-@ round have a lower public health risk from excessive heat . Research shows that residents of southern cities , such as Los Angeles , Phoenix , and Miami , tend to be acclimated to hot weather conditions and therefore less vulnerable to heat related deaths ; however , the high humidity of large southern cities such as Atlanta , Dallas , Houston , Nashville and New Orleans lead to deadly conditions when temperatures rise above normal . 
 Increased temperatures have been reported to cause heat stroke , heat exhaustion , heat syncope , and heat cramps . Some studies have also looked at how severe heat stroke can lead to permanent damage to organ systems . This damage can increase the risk of early mortality because the damage can cause severe impairment in organ function . Other complications of heat stroke include respiratory distress syndrome in adults and disseminated intravascular coagulation . Some researchers have noted that any compromise to the human body 's ability to thermoregulate would in theory increase risk of mortality . This includes illnesses that may affect a person 's mobility , awareness , or behavior . Researchers have noted that individuals with cognitive health issues ( e.g. depression , dementia , Parkinson 's disease ) are more at risk when faced with high temperatures and " need to take extra care " as cognitive performance has been shown to be differentially affected by heat . People with diabetes , are overweight , have sleep deprivation , or have cardiovascular / cerebrovascular conditions should avoid too much heat exposure . Some common medications that have an effect on thermoregulation can also increase the risk of mortality . Specific examples include anticholinergics , diuretics , <unk> and barbiturates . Not only health , but heat can also affect behavior . A U.S. study suggests that heat can make people more irritable and aggressive , noting that violent crimes increased by 4 @.@ 58 out of 100 @,@ 000 for every one degree increase in temperature . 
 A researcher found that high UHI intensity correlates with increased concentrations of air pollutants that gathered at night , which can affect the next day 's air quality . These pollutants include volatile organic compounds , carbon monoxide , nitrogen oxides , and particulate matter . The production of these pollutants combined with the higher temperatures in UHIs can quicken the production of ozone . Ozone at surface level is considered to be a harmful pollutant . Studies suggest that increased temperatures in UHIs can increase polluted days but also note that other factors ( e.g. air pressure , cloud cover , wind speed ) can also have an effect on pollution . 
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that it " is difficult to make valid projections of heat @-@ related illness and death under varying climate change scenarios " and that " heat – related deaths are preventable , as evidenced by the decline of all @-@ cause mortality during heat events over the past 35 years " . However , some studies suggest the possibility that health impacts from UHIs are disproportionate because the impacts can be unevenly distributed based on a variety of factors ( e.g. age , ethnicity and socioeconomic status ) . This raises the possibility of health impacts from UHIs being an environmental justice issue . 
 = = = Inequality of tree canopy cover = = = 
 Relationship between neighborhood income and tree canopy cover 
 In recent years , researchers have discovered a strong correlation between neighborhood income and tree canopy cover . In 2010 , researchers at Auburn University and University of Southern California found that the presence of trees are " highly responsive to changes in [ neighborhood ] income . " Low @-@ income neighborhoods tend to have significantly less trees than neighborhoods with higher incomes . They described this unequal distribution of trees as a demand for " luxury , " rather than " necessity . " According to the study , " for every 1 percent increase in per capita income , demand for forest cover increased by 1 @.@ 76 percent . But when income dropped by the same amount , demand decreased by 1 @.@ 26 percent . " 
 Trees are a necessary feature in combating the urban heat island effect because they reduce air temperatures by 10 ° F or 5 @.@ 5 ° C , and surface temperatures by up to 20 @-@ 45 ° F or 11 @-@ 25 ° C. Researchers hypothesized that less @-@ well @-@ off neighborhoods do not have the financial resources to plant and maintain trees . Affluent neighborhoods can afford more trees , on " both public and private property . " Part of this is also that wealthier homeowners and communities can afford more land , which can be kept open as green space , whereas poorer ones are often rentals , where landowners try to maximize their profit by putting as much density as possible on their land . 
 Additionally , many blogging sites overlay satellite imagery provided by Google Maps and census data to confirm or debunk the aforementioned research . 
 = = Impact on nearby water bodies = = 
 UHIs also impair water quality . Hot pavement and rooftop surfaces transfer their excess heat to stormwater , which then drains into storm sewers and raises water temperatures as it is released into streams , rivers , ponds , and lakes . Additionally , increased urban water body temperatures lead to a decrease in diversity in the water . In August 2001 , rains over Cedar Rapids , Iowa led to a <unk> ( <unk> ) rise in the nearby stream within one hour , which led to a fish kill . Since the temperature of the rain was comparatively cool , it could be attributed to the hot pavement of the city . Similar events have been documented across the American Midwest , as well as Oregon and California . Rapid temperature changes can be stressful to aquatic ecosystems . <unk> pavements may mitigate these effects by percolating water through the pavement into subsurface storage areas where it can be dissipate through absorption and evaporation . 
 = = Impact on energy usage = = 
 Another consequence of urban heat islands is the increased energy required for air conditioning and refrigeration in cities that are in comparatively hot climates . The Heat Island Group estimates that the heat island effect costs Los Angeles about US $ 100 million per year in energy . Conversely , those that are in cold climates such as Moscow , Russia would have less demand for heating . However , through the implementation of heat island reduction strategies , significant annual net energy savings have been calculated for northern locations such as Chicago , Salt Lake City , and Toronto . 
 = = Mitigation = = 
 The temperature difference between urban areas and the surrounding suburban or rural areas can be as much as 5 ° C ( 9 @.@ 0 ° F ) . Nearly 40 percent of that increase is due to the prevalence of dark roofs , with the remainder coming from dark @-@ colored pavement and the declining presence of vegetation . The heat island effect can be counteracted slightly by using white or reflective materials to build houses , roofs , pavements , and roads , thus increasing the overall albedo of the city . Relative to remedying the other sources of the problem , replacing dark roofing requires the least amount of investment for the most immediate return . A cool roof made from a reflective material such as vinyl reflects at least 75 percent of the sun 's rays , and emit at least 70 percent of the solar radiation absorbed by the building envelope . Asphalt built @-@ up roofs ( <unk> ) , by comparison , reflect 6 percent to 26 percent of solar radiation . 
 Using light @-@ colored concrete has proven effective in reflecting up to 50 % more light than asphalt and reducing ambient temperature . A low albedo value , characteristic of black asphalt , absorbs a large percentage of solar heat creating warmer near @-@ surface temperatures . Paving with light @-@ colored concrete , in addition to replacing asphalt with light @-@ colored concrete , communities may be able to lower average temperatures . However , research into the interaction between reflective pavements and buildings has found that , unless the nearby buildings are fitted with reflective glass , solar radiation reflected off light @-@ colored pavements can increase building temperatures , increasing air conditioning demands . 
 A second option is to increase the amount of well @-@ watered vegetation . These two options can be combined with the implementation of green roofs . Green roofs are excellent insulators during the warm weather months and the plants cool the surrounding environment . Air quality is improved as the plants absorb carbon dioxide with concomitant production of oxygen . The city of New York determined that the cooling potential per area was highest for street trees , followed by living roofs , light covered surface , and open space planting . From the standpoint of cost effectiveness , light surfaces , light roofs , and curbside planting have lower costs per temperature reduction . 
 A hypothetical " cool communities " program in Los Angeles has projected that urban temperatures could be reduced by approximately 3 ° C ( 5 ° F ) after planting ten million trees , <unk> five million homes , and painting one @-@ quarter of the roads at an estimated cost of US $ 1 billion , giving estimated annual benefits of US $ 170 million from reduced air @-@ conditioning costs and US $ 360 million in smog related health savings . 
 Mitigation strategies include : 
 White roofs : Painting rooftops white has become a common strategy to reduce the heat island effect . In cities , there are many dark colored surfaces that absorb the heat of the sun in turn lowering the albedo of the city . White rooftops allow high solar reflectance and high solar <unk> , increasing the albedo of the city or area the effect is occurring . 
 Green roofs : Green roofs are another method of decreasing the urban heat island effect . Green <unk> is the practice of having vegetation on a roof ; such as having trees or a garden . The plants that are on the roof increase the albedo and decreases the urban heat island effect . This method has been studied and criticized for the fact that green roofs are affected by climatic conditions , green roof variables are hard to measure , and are very complex systems 
 Planting trees in cities : Planting trees around the city can be another way of increasing albedo and decreasing the urban heat island effect . Trees absorb carbon dioxide and provide shade . It is recommended to plant deciduous trees because they can provide many benefits such as more shade in the summer and not blocking warmth of winter 
 Green parking lots : Green parking lots use surfaces other than asphalt and vegetation to limit the impact urban heat island effect .

 AB32 required the California Air Resources Board to create a scoping plan . This plan is California 's approach on how to carry out their goal of combatting climate change by reducing greenhouse emissions by 2020 to levels from the 1990s . The scoping plan had four primary programs , advanced clean cars , cap and trade , renewables portfolio standard and low @-@ carbon fuel standard all geared toward increased energy efficiency . The plan has main strategies to reduce green house gases such as having monetary incentives , regulations and voluntary actions . Every five years the scoping plan is updated . 
 The advanced clean car rules program was made to reduce tail pipe emissions . The Air Resources Board approved the program to control emissions for newer models from the year 2017 to 2025 . Some of their goals by 2025 are to have more environmentally superior cars to be available in different models and different types of cars . New automobiles will emit 34 percent fewer global warming gases and 75 percent fewer smog @-@ forming emissions . And if fully implemented consumers can save an average of $ 6 @,@ 000 over the life of the car . 
 The renewable portfolio standard mandates to increase renewable energy from a variety of sources such as solar power and wind . Investor @-@ owned utilities , community choice aggregators and electric service providers are required to increase procurement to 33 % by 2020 . 
 Low carbon fuel standards is administered by the California Air Resources Board and attempts to make wider choice of cleaner fuels to Californians . Producers of petroleum @-@ based fuels are required to reduce the carbon intensity of their products to 10 percent in 2020 . 
 Cap and trade is designed to reduce the effects of climate change by setting a cap on greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere . The cap will decline approximately three percent each year in 2013 . The trading will create incentives to reduce the effects of climate change in California communities by reducing greenhouse gases through investments in clean technologies . 
 Clean Air Act 
 The EPA has initiated several air quality requirements that help reduce ground @-@ level ozone that leads to urban heat islands . In the Clean Air Act , one of the EPA 's chief policies , there are certain regulations that are put in place to ensure the state 's emissions stay below a certain level . Included in the Clean Air Act , all states must set forth a State Implementation Plan ( SIP ) which is designed to guarantee all states meet a central air quality standard . 
 State implementation plans and policies 
 The Emerging and Voluntary Measures Policy allows a state to add unconventional forms of heat island mitigation . This can include removing pollution after it has already been emitted into air , water , or soil . These measures are not implemented into law , but they do make it possible for certain parties to voluntarily become more efficient . The purpose of this policy is for all polluting sources to follow by example and use the most successful forms of mitigation . 
 The Guidance on State Implementation Plan Credits for Emissions Reductions from Electric @-@ Sector Energy Efficiency or Renewable Energy Measures is an educational tool for states to create an up to date and well @-@ organized SIP . It allows states to include plans that meet the guidelines or plans that exceed expectations . Based on the success of their SIP , some states can have their plans incorporated into other <unk> . 
 The Bundled Measures Policy authorizes different factions within the state to collaborate on mitigation projects . This policy takes a more of a community @-@ based approach by adding several groups for the purpose of multiple perspectives and inventive approaches . The Bundled Measures Policy is one method that generates co @-@ benefits for both parties . In example , if a partaking business were to add cool roofs , there will be a reduction in greenhouse gases which is beneficial for the environment as well as the need for excess energy which is beneficial for the business .

 The Seattle Green Factor , a multifaceted system for urban landscaping , has seen much success in the mitigation of urban heat islands . The program focuses on areas that are prone to high pollution , such as business districts . There are strict guidelines for any new construction that exceeds roughly 20 parking spaces , and this platform helps developers physically see their levels of pollution while trying different methods of construction to figure out the most effective course of action . Seattle has correspondingly produced a " score sheet " for cities to use in their city planning .

 Sacramento Municipal Utility District ( <unk> ) and the Sacramento Tree Foundation have partnered to provide the city of Sacramento shade trees for free . The program allows citizens to receive trees from four to seven feet tall . They also give them fertilizer , and delivery , all at no cost . They encourage citizens to plant their trees to benefit their home by reducing air conditioning costs . Approximately more than 450 @,@ 000 shade trees have been planted in the Sacramento area . 
 The Eco @-@ Roof Incentive Program : In Canada , grants are distributed throughout Toronto for installing green and cool roofs on residential and commercial buildings . This will reduce usage of energy and lower green house gas emissions . 
 Tree <unk> : This program is a partnership with multiple entities that focuses on helping restore tree cover in the city , it also educates citizens about the positive effects of trees on climate change and the urban heat island effect . And another goal they have is to build capacity among local governments to understand , protect and restore their urban trees . Because there is a need for educating citizens about the maintenance of trees , <unk> provides nine hours of classroom and field training to community residents . The classes cover a variety of topics such as tree identification , pruning , tree biology , and proper species selection .

 = = Tree protection ordinances = = 
 A variety of local governments have implemented tree and landscape ordinances , which will help communities by providing shade during summer . Tree protection is an ordinance that does not allow someone to prune or remove trees without a city permit . An example is the city of Glendale , California : Through the Indigenous Tree Ordinance , the city of Glendale protects the following species of trees , the California sycamore , the coast live oak , mesa oak , valley oak , scrub oak , California bay . Anyone who is planning on removing or trimming the trees has to obtain an indigenous tree permit . Within the permit they have to provide detailed information about the number of trees affected , trunk diameter and the health of the tree itself . They also have to submit photographs of the site , and a site plan sketch . 
 Another example is the city of Berkeley , California . The tree protection ordinance prohibits the removal of coast live oak trees and any excessive pruning that can cause harm to the tree is also prohibited . The only exception is if the tree is poses a danger to life or limb and danger to the property . 
 The city of Visalia , California has implemented a street tree ordinance intended to promote and regulate the planting , maintenance , and protection of street trees within the city . Their ordinance does not allow street trees to be altered , pruned or removed . Street trees are also protected during construction .

 Trees provide benefits such as absorbing carbon dioxide , and other pollutants . Trees also provide shade and reduce ozone emissions from vehicles . By having many trees , we can cool the city heat by approximately 10 degrees to 20 degrees , which will help reducing ozone and helping communities that are mostly affected by the effects of climate change and urban heat islands . 
 = = = Green building programs = = = 
 Voluntary green building programs have been promoting the mitigation of the heat island effect for years . For example , one of the ways for a site to earn points under the US Green Building Council 's ( <unk> ) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ( LEED ) Green Building Rating System is to take action that reduces heat islands , minimizing impacts on microclimates and human and wildlife habitats . Credits associated with reflective roofing or planted roofs can help a building achieve LEED certification . Buildings also receive credits by providing shade . Similarly , The Green Building Initiative ( GBI ) ' s Green Globes program awards points to sites that take measures to decrease a building 's energy consumption and reduce the heat island effect . As many as 10 points may be awarded to sites with roof coverage from vegetation , highly reflective materials , or a combination of the two . 
 = = Cost analysis = = 
 Every year in the U.S. 15 % of energy goes towards the air conditioning of buildings in these urban heat islands . According to Rosenfeld et al . , " the air conditioning demand has risen 10 % within the last 40 years . " Home and business owners alike can benefit from building a cool community . A decrease in energy usage directly correlates to cost efficiency . Areas with substantial vegetation and reflective surface materials used for roofs of houses , pavement , and roads are proven to be more effective and cost efficient . 
 In a case study of the Los Angeles Basin , simulations showed that even when trees are not strategically placed in these urban heat islands , they can still aid in minimization of pollutants and energy reduction . It is estimated that with this wide @-@ scale implementation , the city of Los Angeles can annually save $ 100M with most of the savings coming from cool roofs , lighter colored pavement , and the planting of trees . With a city @-@ wide implementation , added benefits from the lowering smog @-@ level would result in at least one billion dollars of saving per year . 
 The cost efficiency of green roofs is quite high because of several reasons . According to Carter , " A conventional roof is estimated to be $ 83 @.@ 78 / m2 while a green roof was estimated at $ 158 @.@ 82 / m2 . " For one , green roofs have over double the lifespan of a conventional roof , effectively decelerating the amount of roof replacements every year . In addition to roof @-@ life , green roofs add stormwater management reducing fees for utilities . The cost for green roofs is more in the beginning , but over a period of time , their efficiency provides financial as well as health benefits . 
 In Capital E Analysis ' conclusions of the financial benefits of green buildings , it was determined that green roofs successfully lowered energy usage and raised health benefits . For every square foot of green roof used in one study the savings amounted to $ 5 @.@ 80 energy @-@ wise . There were also savings seen in the emissions , water , and maintenance categories . Overall , the savings amounted to $ <unk> $ 71 @.@ 30 on average while the cost of going green totaled - $ <unk> $ 5 @.@ 00 . 
 = = Global warming = = 
 Because some parts of some cities may be hotter than their surroundings , concerns have been raised that the effects of urban sprawl might be misinterpreted as an increase in global temperature . Such effects are removed by homogenization from the raw climate record by comparing urban stations with surrounding stations . While the " heat island " warming is an important local effect , there is no evidence that it biases trends in the homogenized historical temperature record . For example , urban and rural trends are very similar . 
 The Third Assessment Report from the IPCC says : 
 However , over the Northern Hemisphere land areas where urban heat islands are most apparent , both the trends of lower @-@ tropospheric temperature and surface air temperature show no significant differences . In fact , the lower @-@ tropospheric temperatures warm at a slightly greater rate over North America ( about 0 @.@ 28 ° C / decade using satellite data ) than do the surface temperatures ( 0 @.@ 27 ° C / decade ) , although again the difference is not statistically significant . 
 Ground temperature measurements , like most weather observations , are logged by location . Their siting predates the massive sprawl , <unk> programs , and high- and medium @-@ rise expansions which contribute to the UHI . More importantly , station logs allow sites in question to be filtered easily from data sets . Doing so , the presence of heat islands is visible , but overall trends change in magnitude , not direction . The effects of the urban heat island may be overstated . One study stated , " Contrary to generally accepted wisdom , no statistically significant impact of urbanization could be found in annual temperatures . " This was done by using satellite @-@ based night @-@ light detection of urban areas , and more thorough <unk> of the time series ( with corrections , for example , for the tendency of surrounding rural stations to be slightly higher in elevation , and thus cooler , than urban areas ) . If its conclusion is accepted , then it is necessary to " unravel the mystery of how a global temperature time series created partly from urban in situ stations could show no contamination from urban warming . " The main conclusion is that microscale and local @-@ scale impacts dominate the mesoscale impact of the urban heat island . Many sections of towns may be warmer than rural sites , but surface weather observations are likely to be made in park " cool islands . " 
 Not all cities show a warming relative to their rural surroundings . After trends were adjusted in urban weather stations around the world to match rural stations in their regions , in an effort to <unk> the temperature record , in 42 percent of cases , cities were getting cooler relative to their surroundings rather than warmer . One reason is that urban areas are heterogeneous , and weather stations are often sited in " cool islands " – parks , for example – within urban areas . 
 Studies in 2004 and 2006 attempted to test the urban heat island theory , by comparing temperature readings taken on calm nights with those taken on windy nights . If the urban heat island theory is correct then instruments should have recorded a bigger temperature rise for calm nights than for windy ones , because wind blows excess heat away from cities and away from the measuring instruments . There was no difference between the calm and windy nights , and one study said that " we show that , globally , temperatures over land have risen as much on windy nights as on calm nights , indicating that the observed overall warming is not a consequence of urban development . " 
 A view often held by those who reject the evidence for global warming is that much of the temperature increase seen in land based thermometers could be due to an increase in urbanization and the siting of measurement stations in urban areas . For example , Ross McKitrick and Patrick J. Michaels conducted a statistical study of surface @-@ temperature data regressed against socioeconomic indicators , and concluded that about half of the observed warming trend ( for 1979 – 2002 ) could be accounted for by the residual UHI effects in the corrected temperature data set they studied — which had already been processed to remove the ( modeled ) UHI contribution . Critics of this paper , including Gavin A. Schmidt , have said the results can be explained away as an artifact of spatial autocorrelation . McKittrick and Nicolas Nierenberg stated further that " the evidence for contamination of climatic data is robust across numerous data sets . " 
 The preliminary results of an independent assessment carried out by the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature group , and made available to the public in October 2011 , found that among other scientific concerns raised by skeptics , the urban heat island effect did not bias the results obtained by NOAA , the Hadley Centre and NASA 's <unk> . The Berkeley Earth group also confirmed that over the past 50 years the land surface warmed by 0 @.@ 911 ° C , and their results closely matched those obtained from earlier studies . 
 Climate Change 2007 , the Fourth Assessment Report from the IPCC states the following . 
 Studies that have looked at hemispheric and global scales conclude that any urban @-@ related trend is an order of magnitude smaller than decadal and longer time @-@ scale trends evident in the series ( e.g. , Jones et al . , 1990 ; Peterson et al . , 1999 ) . This result could partly be attributed to the omission from the gridded data set of a small number of sites ( < 1 % ) with clear urban @-@ related warming trends . In a worldwide set of about 270 stations , Parker ( 2004 , 2006 ) noted that warming trends in night minimum temperatures over the period 1950 to 2000 were not enhanced on calm nights , which would be the time most likely to be affected by urban warming . Thus , the global land warming trend discussed is very unlikely to be influenced significantly by increasing urbanisation ( Parker , 2006 ) . ... Accordingly , this assessment adds the same level of urban warming uncertainty as in the TAR : 0 @.@ 006 ° C per decade since 1900 for land , and 0 @.@ 002 ° C per decade since 1900 for blended land with ocean , as ocean UHI is zero . 
 A 2014 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America looks at the potential of large @-@ scale urban adaptation to counteract the effects of long @-@ term global climate change . The researchers calculate that without any adaptive urban design , by 2100 the expansion of existing U.S. cities into regional <unk> could raise near @-@ surface temperatures between 1 and 2 degrees Celsius over large regions , " a significant fraction of the 21st @-@ century greenhouse gas @-@ induced climate change simulated by global climate models . " Large @-@ scale adaptive design could completely offset this increase , however . For example , the temperature increase in California was calculated to be as high as 1 @.@ 31 degrees Celsius , but a 100 % deployment of " cool roofs " would result in a temperature drop of 1 @.@ 47 degrees Celsius — more than the increase . 
 = Passengers of the RMS Titanic = 
 The passengers of the RMS Titanic were among the estimated 2 @,@ 344 people who sailed on the maiden voyage of the second of the White Star Line 's Olympic class ocean liners , from Southampton , England to New York City in the US state of New York . Partway through the voyage , the ship struck an iceberg and sank in the early morning of 15 April 1912 , resulting in the deaths of over 1 @,@ 500 people , including approximately 815 of the passengers . 
 The Titanic 's passengers were divided into three separate classes , determined not only by the price of their ticket but by wealth and social class : those travelling in first class , most of them the wealthiest passengers on board , included prominent members of the upper class , businessmen , politicians , high @-@ ranking military personnel , industrialists , bankers , entertainers , socialites , and professional athletes . Second class passengers were middle class travellers and included professors , authors , clergymen , and tourists . Third class or steerage passengers were primarily emigrants moving to the United States and Canada . 
 = = Passengers = = 
 = = = First class = = = 
 The Titanic 's first class passenger list was a " who 's who " of the rich and prominent of the upper class in 1912 . A single person berth in first class cost between £ 30 ( equivalent to £ 2 @,@ 700 in 2015 ) , up to £ 870 ( equivalent to £ 78 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) for a parlour suite and small private promenade deck . First class passengers enjoyed a number of amenities including a gymnasium , a squash court , a salt water swimming pool , electric and Turkish baths , a barbershop , kennels for first class dogs , elevators , and both open and enclosed promenades . First class passengers also traveled accompanied by personal staff — valets , maids , nurses and governesses for the children , chauffeurs and cooks . 
 Members of the British aristocracy made the trip : The Countess of Rothes , wife of the 19th Earl of Rothes , embarked at Southampton with her parents , Thomas and Clementina Dyer @-@ Edwardes , and cousin Gladys Cherry . Sir Cosmo Duff @-@ Gordon , 5th Baronet of Halkin , and his wife , Lucy , Lady Duff @-@ Gordon were on board as well . Sir Cosmo was a wealthy Scottish landowner and Olympic fencing medalist , while Lady Duff @-@ Gordon , known professionally as Lucile , was a leading fashion designer who served a wealthy and exclusive clientele including the British Royal Family . Colonel Archibald Gracie IV , a real estate investor , member of the wealthy Scottish @-@ American Gracie family , embarked at Southampton . The <unk> of London were among other prominent British couples on board as well . Lord <unk> , chairman of Harland and Wolff intended to travel aboard the Titanic , but illness prevented him from joining the ill @-@ fated voyage ; however White Star Line 's Managing Director J. Bruce Ismay and the ship 's Harland and Wolff designer , Thomas Andrews , were both on board to oversee the ship 's progress on her maiden voyage . 
 Some of the most prominent members of the American social elite made the trip : real estate builder , businessman , and multimillionaire Colonel John Jacob Astor IV and his 18 @-@ year @-@ old pregnant wife Madeleine were returning to the United States for their child 's birth . Astor was the wealthiest passenger aboard the ship and one of the richest men in the world ; his great @-@ grandfather John Jacob Astor was the first multimillionaire in America . Among others were industrialist magnate and millionaire Benjamin Guggenheim ; Macy 's department store owner and member of the United States House of Representatives , Isidor Straus and his wife Ida ; George <unk> Wick , founder and president of Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company ; millionaire streetcar magnate George Dunton Widener ; vice president of Pennsylvania Railroad , John Thayer and his wife Marian ; Charles Hays , president of Canada 's Grand Trunk Railway ; William Ernest Carter and his wife , American social elite Lucile Carter ; millionaire , philanthropist and women 's rights activist Margaret Brown ; tennis star and banker Karl Behr ; famous American silent film actress Dorothy Gibson ; prominent Buffalo architect Edward Austin Kent ; and President William Howard Taft 's military aide , Major Archibald Butt , who was returning to resume his duties after a six @-@ week trip to Europe . Swedish first class passenger and businessman Mauritz Håkan <unk> @-@ <unk> , owned the most highly valued single object on board ; a masterpiece of French neoclassical painting entitled La <unk> au Bain , for which he would later claim $ 100 @,@ 000 in compensation ( equivalent to $ 2 @.@ 4 million in 2015 ) . 
 White Star financier J. P. Morgan and Milton S. Hershey , founder of Hershey 's chocolate , made plans to sail aboard the ship 's maiden voyage but cancelled at the last minute . 
 = = = Second class = = = 
 Second classes passengers were leisure tourists , academics , members of the clergy and middle class English and American families . The ship 's musicians travelled in second class accommodations ; they were not counted as members of the crew but were employed by an agency under contract to the White Star Line . The average ticket price for an adult second class passenger was £ 13 , the equivalent of £ 1 @,@ 123 <unk> and for many of these passengers , their travel experience on the Titanic was akin to travelling first class on smaller liners . Second class passengers had their own library and the men had access to a private smoking room . Second class children could read the children 's books provided in the library or play deck quoits and shuffleboard on the second class promenade . Twelve @-@ year @-@ old Ruth Becker passed the time by pushing her two @-@ year @-@ old brother Richard around the enclosed promenade in a stroller provided by the White Star Line . 
 Two Roman Catholic priests on board , Father Thomas Byles and Father Joseph <unk> , celebrated Mass every day for second and third class passengers during the voyage . Father Byles gave his homilies in English , Irish and French and Father <unk> gave his in German and Hungarian . 
 Rev. John Harper , a well @-@ known Baptist pastor from Scotland , was travelling to America with his daughter and niece in order to preach at the Moody Church in Chicago . 
 <unk> Lawrence Beesley , a science master at Dulwich College , spent much of his time aboard the ship in the library . Two months after the sinking , he wrote and published The Loss of the SS Titanic , the first eyewitness account of the disaster . 
 The Laroche family , father Joseph and daughters Simonne and Louise , were the only known passengers of black ancestry on board the ship . They , along with Joseph 's pregnant wife Juliette , were travelling to Joseph 's native island of Haiti . Joseph hoped that a move from their former home in Paris back to Haiti , where his uncle Cincinnatus Leconte was president , would take his family away from racial discrimination . 
 Another French family travelling in second class was the <unk> , travelling under the assumed name Hoffman . Michel Navratil , a Slovak @-@ born French tailor , had kidnapped his two young sons , Michel Jr. and Edmond from his estranged wife , assumed the name Louis M. Hoffman and boarded the ship in Southampton , intent on taking his children to the United States . Michel Sr. died in the sinking and photographs of the boys were circulated throughout the world in the hopes that their mother or another relative could identify the French toddlers , who became known as " The Titanic Orphans . " After arriving in New York , the children were cared for by Titanic survivor Margaret Hays until their mother , Marcelle Navratil travelled from Nice , France to claim them . 
 = = = Third class = = = 
 The third class passengers or steerage passengers left hoping to start new lives in the United States and Canada . Third class passengers paid £ 7 ( £ 777 today ) for their ticket , depending on their place of origin ; ticket prices often included the price of rail travel to the three departure ports . Tickets for children cost £ 3 ( £ 259 today ) . 
 Third class passengers were a diverse group of nationalities and ethnic groups . In addition to large numbers of British , Irish , and Scandinavian immigrants , there were passengers from Central and Eastern Europe , the Middle East ( primarily Lebanon and Syria ) and Hong Kong . Some travelled alone or in small family groups . Several groups of mothers were travelling alone with their young children — most going to join their husbands who had already gone to America to find jobs , and , having saved up enough money , could now send for their families . 
 Among the larger third @-@ class families were John and Annie Sage , who were immigrating to Jacksonville , Florida with their nine children , ranging in age from 4 to 20 years ; Anders and <unk> Andersson of Sweden and their five children , who were travelling to Canada along with <unk> 's younger sister Anna , husband Ernst and baby Gilbert ; and Frederick and Augusta Goodwin , who were moving with their six children to his new job at a power plant in New York . In 2007 , scientists using DNA analysis identified the body of a small fair @-@ haired toddler , one of the first victims to be recovered by the CS Mackay Bennett , as Frederick 's youngest child , 19 @-@ month @-@ old Sidney . The Sages , <unk> and Goodwins all perished in the sinking . 
 The youngest passenger on board the ship , two @-@ month @-@ old Millvina Dean who , with her parents Bertram Sr. and Eva Dean and older brother Bertram , were emigrating from England to Kansas , died in 2009 . She was the last survivor of the Titanic disaster to die . 
 In order to compete with rival shipping company Cunard , the White Star Line offered their steerage passengers modest luxuries , in the hopes that emigrants would write to relatives back home and encourage them to travel on White Star Line ships . Third class passengers had their own dining facilities , with chairs instead of benches , and meals prepared by the third class kitchen staff . On other liners , the steerage passengers would have been expected to bring their own food . Rather than dormitory @-@ style sleeping areas , third class passengers had their own cabins . The single men and women were separated , women in the stern in two to six berth cabins , men in the bow in up to ten berth cabins , often shared with strangers . Each stateroom was fitted with wood panelling and beds with mattresses , blankets , pillows , electric lights , heat and a washbasin with running water , except for the bow cabins which did not have a private washbasin . Two public bathtubs were also provided , one for the men , the other for women . 
 Passengers gathered in the third class common room where they could play chess or cards , or walk along the poop deck . Third class children played in the common room or explored the ship — nine @-@ year @-@ old Frank Goldsmith recalled peering into the engine room and climbing up the baggage cranes on the poop deck . 
 Ship 's regulations were designed to keep third class passengers confined to their area of the ship . The Titanic was fitted with grilles to prevent the classes from mingling and these gates were normally kept closed , although the stewards could open them in the event of an emergency . In the rush following the collision , the stewards , occupied with waking up sleeping passengers and leading groups of women and children to the boat deck , did not have time to open all the gates , leaving many of the confused third class passengers stuck below decks . 
 = = = Ticket @-@ holders who did not sail = = = 
 Numerous notable and prominent people of the era , who held tickets for the westbound passage or were guests of those who held tickets , did not sail . Others were waiting in New York to board for the passage back to Plymouth , England , on the second leg of Titanic 's maiden voyage . Many unused tickets that survived , whether they were for the westbound passage or the return eastbound passage , have become quite valuable as Titanic @-@ related artifacts . Among those who held tickets for a passage , but did not actually sail , include : Theodore Dreiser , Henry Clay Frick , Milton S. Hershey , Guglielmo Marconi , John Pierpont Morgan , Edgar Selwyn , Hugh Sullivan , and Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt ( who died in the sinking of the RMS Lusitania ) .

 = = = Arab passengers = = = 
 Several passengers on the Titanic had Arabic origins . At the time , many carried identification from the Ottoman Empire that stated they were from Greater Syria , which included what is today Palestine , Jordan , Lebanon , and Syria . Passengers from Lebanon , for instance , had hometown villages today located in Lebanon . Kamal <unk> of Al Arabiya said " Even though the list of victims who died on the Titanic denotes who among them was Arab , it is difficult to find enough information on their Arab nationalities and what circumstances drove them to board the doomed ship . This [ difficulty ] even applies to Encyclopedia Titanic , the most comprehensive source on the 1912 tragedy . " The names of Arab people on the passenger register do not necessarily correspond to the original Arabic . For instance " Badr " was rendered " <unk> , " Yusuf " was rendered " Joseph , " and " Boutros " was rendered as " Peter . " Of the Arab passengers who died , all were from today 's Lebanon except for one Egyptian . 
 According to <unk> Assaf , mayor of Hardin , Lebanon , 93 passengers originated from what is today Lebanon , and Hardin had 20 passengers , the highest number of any Lebanese location . Of the Hardin passengers , 11 adult men died , while eight women and children and one adult man survived . Kamal <unk> , an individual quoted in an article from the Lebanese publication Daily Star , stated that according to a May 16 , 1912 issue of the Al @-@ <unk> magazine stored in the American University of Beirut , of the 125 Lebanese aboard , 23 survived . The magazine states that 10 people from Kfar <unk> died on the Titanic . 
 In 1997 , Ray Hanania , a Palestinian American journalist , watched the Titanic ( 1997 ) film and noticed some background characters saying <unk> , meaning " come on " in Arabic . This prompted him to research the issue and he discovered that Arab passengers were on board . In 1998 , he wrote a column about the Arabs on the RMS Titanic , " Titanic : We Share the Pain But Not the Glory . " According to Hanania 's analysis , there were 79 Arab passengers . According to Hanania , the task to " identify precisely " which passengers were Arab is difficult . Hanania stated that many were Christians because church sponsorship made it easier for Christians to get passage as opposed to Muslims . 
 In the book Titanic : Women and Children First ( October 1998 ) , Judith Geller stated that " officially were 154 Syrians on board the Titanic and 29 were saved : four men , five children and 20 women " .

 On the night of 14 April 1912 at around 11 : 40 pm , while the RMS Titanic was sailing about 400 miles ( 640 km ) south of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland , the ship struck an iceberg and began to sink . Shortly before midnight , Captain Edward Smith ordered the ship 's lifeboats to be readied and a distress call was sent out . The closest ship to respond was Cunard Line 's Carpathia 58 miles ( 93 km ) away , which would arrive in an estimated four hours — too late to rescue all of Titanic 's passengers . Forty @-@ five minutes after the ship hit the iceberg , Captain Smith finally ordered the lifeboats to be loaded and lowered under the orders women and children first . 
 The first lifeboat launched was Lifeboat 7 on the starboard side with 28 people on board out of a capacity of 65 . It was lowered at around 12 : 45 am as believed by the British Inquiry . Collapsible Boat D was the last lifeboat to be launched , at 2 : 05 . Two more lifeboats , Collapsible Boats A and B , were in the process of being removed from their location on the roof of the officer 's house but could not be properly launched . Collapsible B floated away from the ship upside down , while Collapsible A became half @-@ filled with water after the supports for its canvas sides were broken in the fall from the roof of the officers ' quarters . There were arguments in some of the lifeboats about going back to pick up people in the water , but many survivors were afraid of being swamped by people trying to climb into the lifeboat or being pulled down by the suction from the sinking Titanic , though it turned out that there had been very little suction . At 2 : 20 am , Titanic herself sank . A small number of passengers and crew were able to make their way to the two <unk> collapsible boats , surviving for several hours ( some still clinging to the overturned Collapsible B ) until they were rescued by Fifth Officer Harold Lowe . 
 At 4 : 10 am , the RMS Carpathia arrived at the site of the sinking and began rescuing survivors . By 8 : 30 am , she picked up the last lifeboat with survivors and left the area at 08 : 50 bound for Pier 54 in New York City . Of the 711 passengers and crew rescued by the Carpathia , six , including first class passenger William F. Hoyt , either died in a lifeboat during the night or on board the Carpathia the next morning , and were buried at sea . 
 In the days following the sinking , several ships sailed to the disaster area to recover victims ' bodies . The White Star Line chartered the cable ship Mackay @-@ Bennett from Halifax , Nova Scotia to retrieve bodies . Three other ships followed in the search : the cable ship Minia , the lighthouse supply ship <unk> and the sealing vessel Algerine . Each ship left with embalming supplies , undertakers , and clergy . Upon recovery , each body retrieved by the Mackay @-@ Bennett was numbered and given as detailed a description as possible to help aid in identification . The physical appearance of each body — height , weight , age , hair and eye colour , visible birthmarks , scars or tattoos , was catalogued and any personal effects on the bodies were gathered and placed in small canvas bags corresponding to their number . 
 However , the ship found so many bodies that the embalming supplies aboard were quickly exhausted . Health regulations permitted that only embalmed bodies could be returned to port . Captain <unk> of the Mackay @-@ Bennett and the undertakers aboard decided to preserve all bodies of First Class passengers because of the need to visually identify wealthy men to resolve any disputes over large estates . As a result , the majority of the burials at sea were third class passengers and crew . <unk> himself claimed that as a mariner , he would expect to be buried at sea . However complaints about the burials at sea were made by families and undertakers . Later ships such as Minia found fewer bodies , requiring fewer embalming supplies , and were able to limit burials at sea to bodies which were too damaged to preserve . 
 Bodies recovered were preserved and taken to Halifax , Nova Scotia , the closest city to the sinking with direct rail and steamship connections . A large temporary morgue was set up in a curling rink and undertakers were called in from all across Eastern Canada to assist . Relatives from across North America came to identify and claim the bodies of their relatives . Some bodies were shipped to be buried in their home towns across North America and Europe . About two @-@ thirds of the bodies were identified . Of the remaining 150 unclaimed bodies , 121 were taken to the non @-@ denominational Fairview Lawn Cemetery ; 19 were buried in the Roman Catholic Mount Olivet Cemetery , and 10 were taken to the Jewish Baron de Hirsch Cemetery . Unidentified victims were buried with simple numbers based on the order in which their bodies were discovered . 
 In mid @-@ May 1912 , over 200 miles ( 320 km ) from the site of the sinking , RMS Oceanic recovered three bodies , numbers 331 , 332 and 333 , who were among the original occupants of Collapsible A , which was swamped in the last moments of the sinking . Although several people managed to reach this lifeboat , three died during the night . When Fifth Officer Harold Lowe and six crewmen returned to the wreck site after the sinking with an empty lifeboat to pick up survivors , they rescued surviving passengers from Collapsible A , but left the three dead bodies in the boat : Thomson Beattie , a first @-@ class passenger , and two crew members , a fireman and a seaman . After their retrieval from Collapsible A by Oceanic , the bodies were buried at sea .

 Crime Cutz is the second extended play by American synthpop duo Holy Ghost ! , consisting of Nick Millhiser and Alex Frankel . Its title came from the name of a person of the same name who offered a drum break for the title track that was not included in the final mix . Containing a 1980s @-@ style atmosphere and noted by one reviewer to be the duo 's cleaning sounding release so far , the extended play was influenced by Russian disco records Frankel found on eBay . DFA Records released the title track as a single in February 2016 , and the EP was distributed in April 2016 to generally positive reviews . 
 = = Production and composition = = 
 Crime Cutz has been described by Lily Moayeri of Under the Radar as an EP that strongly showcases the nu @-@ disco side of the duo . The music of the EP was influenced by records by Russian jazz musicians that were released in the 1970s and 1980s but were never distributed in the duo 's home country ; these musicians attempted to copy the disco style of American and French acts such as Chic . Frankel , who was sent mp3 files of these tracks by a Russian record dealer on eBay , said that their failure to mimic the style of the popular songs they wanted to recreate due to their different synthesizer sounds is what made the songs unique : " I guess that 's kind of what Nick and I do ... We find a sound we like , try to make it and fail , but in the process we make something new . " The rhythm of each track was developed first before writing the melodies and lyrics , given that the main goal of the EP was for it to be " instantly rhythmically gratifying " , as member Nick Millhiser described . In addition to its disco element , Crime Cutz features exaggerated arrangements and childlike R & B vocals that gives it a 1980s @-@ esque atmosphere . Consequence of Sound 's David <unk> noted Crime Cutz to be Holy Ghost ! ' s cleanest @-@ sounding release to date . As for the lyrical content , Frankel wanted the songs ' seductive lyrics to be " phonetically fun " as with most other disco records .

 The starting title track of Crime Cutz derived its title from a person of the same name who gave Holy Ghost ! a drum break to be used in the song ; it was not included in the final mix , however . It begins with " spacey " synthesizers , before the acoustic drum beat kicks in around a minute into the song . Halfway into the song , diva vocals from the East Coast Inspirational Singers group join in , which Frankel , " literally found them on the internet . We met up the next day , and it was awesome and really moving to hear them sing . In general we 've tried to be a bit more off the cuff when recording recently , [ and they were ] a last minute addition while mixing the song . " Sequenced synth arpeggios , " super @-@ dry " guitars , and falsetto lead vocals are also present in the arrangement . " Stereotype " is about the band 's self @-@ awareness and pride towards them being of a very well @-@ known musical genre , singing in a mournful tone that " I know I 'm a stereotype , don 't be so critical [ … ] Let go . " In the track 's first draft , the drum parts and chord progression were developed first . Holy Ghost ! traveled to Los Angeles to work with DJ and production duo Oliver on the song , but with little success in making the type of track Holy Ghost ! wanted it to be . It was not until Oliver created a bassline for the duo that Holy Ghost ! reworked the arrangement of the song into what would be the final mix that ended up on Crime Cutz . 
 The title of " Compass Point " , a song Frankel wrote in 45 minutes , is a reference to Chris Blackwell 's Compass Point Studios , where numerous popular musicians in the style mixture of funk , reggae and synthpop , that Crime Cutz pays a tribute to , recorded their music . Its working title was " Back to Earth " , and was the first song to be written for but was not included on their second studio album Dynamics . As Millhiser explains , " There was always some indescribable thing about it that irked us , so we went back to that song with the intention of being like , ' Oh , you know , it ’ s just a matter of re @-@ recording the vocals or the piano , and it ’ ll be done . ' That of course was not the case , and we ended basically just keeping the drums and one line from the song , making a totally different song out of it , essentially remixing ourselves . " Frankel called the EP 's closer , " Footsteps " , to be the least rhythmic of all the tracks . Its original title was " Your Favorite Band / Footsteps " . As Frankel described coming up with the name , " I was going the other night to see our friends in Hot Chip . When I was there , I overheard some people saying , ' I thought they were playing , but they ’ re DJing , ' and that ’ s something that happens all the time now . People go to see their favorite band , and it turns out it ’ s a DJ set . I thought it was kind of funny , and also kind of sad — but in a funny way . " While the version of Crime Cutz that was officially released only consists of four tracks , Holy Ghost ! said in their January 2016 announcement of the EP that a fifth track might be included ; " We ’ re still messing around , because we have a lot of demos from this last year and a half , and we ’ re sifting through , figuring out if there ’ s one more we want to finish . "

 Holy Ghost ! first announced in a January 7 , 2016 interview with The Boston Globe that an extended play titled Crime Cutz was to be released in late spring of that year . The title track of Crime Cutz first premiered worldwide on Zane Lowe 's Apple Music show Beats 1 on February 4 , 2016 . The label DFA Records released it as a digital download single a day later . As part of the PopMatters feature Singles Going Steady , multiple writers reviewed the track upon its release . The 12 " vinyl single for the song that also includes the instrumental version of the song was a 300 @-@ copy limited edition . An official Ben Fries @-@ directed video for the song depicted multicolored lights flashing to the beat , with Aubrey Cook starring as the dancer . On April 22 , 2016 , DFA released a " Crime Cutz " remix EP featuring two re @-@ cuts of the song , one by Alan Palomo 's project Neon Indian and another by producer Eli Escobar . DFA released the Crime Cutz EP on April 29 .

 Reviews of Crime Cutz were generally positive , holding an aggregate 67 out of 100 on the website Metacritic based on four critics . Lily Moayeri wrote in her review that " Holy Ghost ! has sculpted its production for a sharply defined quadruple hit . " Austin Reed , writing for Pretty Much Amazing , praised the band for returning to a little @-@ to @-@ no effort approach that was used in making their self @-@ titled debut album : " Dynamics fell short because neither Frankel nor bandmate Nick Millhiser seemed 100 % convinced that what they were doing made any sense . But on tracks like " Crime Cutz " , and EP highlight " Compassion Points " , that confidence sounds fully restored and more galvanized than ever " . 
 Cameron Cook of Pitchfork Media honored Crime Cutz as " a bright , tight , tense mini @-@ epic , solidifying [ Holy Ghost ! ] as one of the pillars of the mid- ' 00s disco resurgence . " His only major criticism of the EP was its lack of stylistic variety : " you spend a lot of the record hoping for something to take them even further over the edge , but they continue to pull back until the very end . " The group 's lack of musical risk on the EP was also criticized in a more mixed review by <unk> , spotlighting " Compass Point " as the set 's only memorable track : " At best , Crime Cutz is a decent release by a talented group that clearly has potential to make some great retro records . At its lowest points , it ’ s filled with clumsy lyrics and meandering tracks that never really go anywhere . "

 = Bat Out of Hell = 
 Bat Out of Hell is the second album and major @-@ label debut by American rock singer Meat Loaf , as well as being his first collaboration with composer Jim Steinman , released in October 1977 on Cleveland International / Epic Records . It is one of the best @-@ selling albums in the history of recorded music , having sold over 30 million copies worldwide . Rolling Stone magazine ranked it at number 343 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time in 2003 . 
 Its musical style is influenced by Steinman 's appreciation of Richard Wagner , Phil Spector , Bruce Springsteen and The Who . Bat Out of Hell has been certified by the Recording Industry Association of America as a platinum album , fourteen times over . As of May 2015 , it has spent 485 weeks in the UK Charts . The album went on to become one of the most influential and iconic albums of all time and its songs have remained classic rock staples . 
 This album 's title also became the title for two more Meat Loaf albums . Steinman produced the album Bat Out of Hell II : Back into Hell ( 1993 ) . Desmond Child produced the album Bat Out of Hell III : The Monster Is Loose ( 2006 ) . 
 = = Pre @-@ production = = 
 The album developed from a musical , Neverland , a sci @-@ fi update of Peter Pan , which Steinman wrote for a workshop in 1974 , and performed at the Kennedy Center Music Theatre Lab in 1977 . Steinman and Meat Loaf , who were touring with the National Lampoon show , felt that three songs were " exceptional " and Steinman began to develop them as part of a seven @-@ song set they wanted to record as an album . The three songs were " Bat Out of Hell " , " Heaven Can Wait " and " The Formation of the Pack " , which was later retitled " All Revved Up with No Place to Go " . 
 Bat Out of Hell is often compared to the music of Bruce Springsteen , particularly the album Born to Run . Steinman says that he finds that " puzzling , musically " , although they share influences ; " Springsteen was more an inspiration than an influence . " A BBC article added , " that Max Weinberg and Roy Bittan from Springsteen 's E Street Band played on the album only helped reinforce the comparison . " 
 Steinman and Meat Loaf had immense difficulty finding a record company willing to sign them . According to Meat Loaf 's autobiography , the band spent most of 1975 writing and recording material , and two and a half years auditioning the record and being rejected . Manager David Sonenberg jokes that they were creating record companies just so they could be rejected . They performed the album live in 1976 , with Steinman on piano , Meat Loaf singing , and sometimes Ellen Foley joining them for " Paradise " . Steinman says that it was a " medley of the most brutal rejections you could imagine . " Meat Loaf " almost cracked " when CBS executive Clive Davis rejected the project . The singer recounts the incident in his autobiography . Not only did Davis , according to Meat Loaf , say that " actors don 't make records " , the executive challenged Steinman 's writing abilities and knowledge of rock music : 
 Do you know how to write a song ? Do you know anything about writing ? If you 're going to write for records , it goes like this : A , B , C , B , C , C. I don 't know what you 're doing . You 're doing A , D , F , G , B , D , C. You don 't know how to write a song ... Have you ever listened to pop music ? Have you ever heard any rock @-@ and @-@ roll music ... You should go downstairs when you leave here ... and buy some rock @-@ and @-@ roll records . 
 Meat Loaf asserts " Jim , at the time , knew every record ever made . [ He ] is a walking rock encyclopedia . " Although Steinman laughed off the insults , the singer screamed " Fuck you , Clive ! " from the street up to his building . 
 However , Todd Rundgren found the album hilarious , thinking that it was a parody of Springsteen . The singer quotes him as saying : " I 've got to do this album . It 's just so out there . " They told the producer that they had previously been signed to RCA . In one 1989 interview with Classic Rock magazine , Steinman labeled him " the only genuine genius I 've ever worked with . " In a 1989 interview with Redbeard for the In the Studio with Redbeard episode on the making of the album , Meat Loaf revealed that Jimmy Iovine and Andy Johns were potential candidates for producing Bat Out of Hell before being rejected by Meat and Steinman in favor of Rundgren , who Meat initially found cocky but grew to like . 
 = = Production = = 
 Recording started in late 1975 in Bearsville Studios , Woodstock , New York . Roy Bittan and Max Weinberg , the pianist and drummer from Bruce Springsteen 's E Street Band played on the album , in addition to members of Rundgren 's group Utopia : Kasim Sulton , Roger Powell and John " Willie " Wilcox . Edgar Winter played the saxophone on " All Revved Up " . Rundgren himself played guitar , including the " motorcycle solo " on " Bat Out of Hell " . Both Steinman and Rundgren were influenced by Phil Spector and his " wall of sound " . According to Meat Loaf , Rundgren put all the arrangements together because although " Jim could hear all the instruments " in his head , Steinman hummed rather than orchestrating . 
 When Rundgren discovered that the deal with RCA did not actually exist , Albert Grossman , who had been Bob Dylan 's manager , offered to put it on his Bearsville label but needed more money . Rundgren had essentially paid for the album himself . Mo Ostin at Warner Bros. was impressed , but other senior people rejected them after they performed live . Steinman had offended them a few years earlier by auditioning with a song named " Who Needs the Young " , which contains the lyric " Is there anyone left who can fuck ? Screw ' em ! " 
 Another E Street Band member , Steve Van Zandt , and Sonenberg arranged to contact Cleveland International Records , a subsidiary of Epic Records . After listening to the spoken word intro to " You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth " ( " Hot Summer Night " ) , founder Steve Popovich accepted the album for Cleveland . 
 Rundgren mixed the record in one night . However , the mixes were not suitable to the extent that Meat Loaf did not want " Paradise " on the album . Jimmy Iovine , who had mixed Springsteen 's Born to Run , remixed some of the tracks . After several attempts by several people , John Jansen mixed the version of " Paradise " that is on the album . According to Meat Loaf , he , Jansen and Steinman mixed the title track . 
 Phil Rizzuto 's baseball play @-@ by @-@ play call for " Paradise by the Dashboard Light " was recorded in 1976 at The Hit Factory in New York City by Rundgren , Meat Loaf and Steinman . As an Italian Catholic , Rizzuto publicly maintained he was unaware that his contribution would be equated with sex in the finished song . However , Meat Loaf asserts that Rizzuto only claimed ignorance to stifle some criticism from a priest and was fully aware of the context of what he was recording . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Todd Rundgren acknowledges that Steinman was highly influenced by the " rural suburban teenage angst " of Bruce Springsteen . According to manager David Sonenberg , " Jim would always come up with these great titles and then he would write a song that would try to justify the greatness of the title . " 
 The album opens with its title track , " Bat Out of Hell " , taken from Steinman 's Neverland musical . It is the result of Steinman 's desire to write the " most extreme crash song of all time . " It features a boy who is riding so fast and ecstatically that he is unable to see an obstruction until it is " way too late " . The next track , " You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth " , opens with spoken word , performed by Steinman and Marcia McClain , that was also taken from the Neverland musical , as were the next two tracks . 
 " All Revved Up with No Place to Go " describes the beginning of a relationship and also the taking of the girl 's virginity : 
 You and me ' round about midnight 
 Someone 's got to draw first blood [ ... ] 
 Oooh I got to draw first blood . 
 Side two opens with " Two Out of Three Ain 't Bad " , which was written near the end of the album 's production . The song documents the break @-@ up of a relationship where despite the fact that the man wants and needs the woman , he will never love her , however he tries to be positive and supportive in emphasizing that the two emotions of want and need are very positive and " Ain 't Bad " , which gives the song a sarcastic twist . A further twist is that the reason the man will never love the woman is because he already loves another woman , who broke up with him because she already loved another man . Rundgren identifies how the song was influenced by the Eagles , who were successful at the time . The producer also highlights the " underlying humor in the lyrics " , citing the line " There ain 't no Coupe de Ville hiding at the bottom of a Cracker Jack box . " He says you could only " get away " with that lyric " in a Meat Loaf song " . 
 The sixth track , " Paradise by the Dashboard Light " , is an epic story about teen romance and sex . A duet between Meat Loaf and Ellen Foley , the couple reminisce about driving to a secluded spot , at which he plans to have sex . They " make out " heavily in the middle instrumental section , described in metaphor in a baseball commentary by New York Yankees announcer Phil Rizzuto . However , she stops him just before they have sex , insisting that he first proclaim that he will " love her forever " . He swears to love her until the end of time . The final part of the song displays the couple in an acrimonious relationship , in which they are " praying for the end of time " because " if I got to spend another minute with you I don 't think that I can really survive . " Whereas the title track is the " ultimate car crash song " , this , according to the writer , is the " ultimate car sex song " . It epitomizes the album 's , as Ellen Foley describes , " pre @-@ pubescent sexual mentality " . 
 The seventh and final track , " For Crying Out Loud " , is a more sedate love song . It recounts the positive changes that a girl has made to the singer 's life , which had " reached the bottom " . The song also incorporates some sexual innuendo with the line " And can 't you see my faded Levi 's bursting apart . " 
 Comparing the album to Steinman 's late @-@ 1960s musical The Dream Engine , Classic Rock magazine says that Steinman 's imagery is " revved up and testosterone @-@ fueled . Songs like " Paradise by the Dashboard Light " , " Two Out of Three Ain 't Bad " and " For Crying Out Loud " echoed the textbook teenage view of sex and life : irrepressible physical urges and unrealistic romantic longing . " 
 Steinman 's songs for Bat Out of Hell are personal but not autobiographical : 
 I never thought of them as personal songs in terms of my own life but they were personality songs . They were all about my obsessions and images . None of them takes place in a normal world . They all take play in extreme world . Very operatic ... they were all heightened . They don 't take place in normal reality . 
 For example , citing the narrative of " Paradise " , Rundgren jokes that he can 't imagine Steinman being at a lakeside with the most beautiful girl in school , but he can imagine Steinman imagining it . 
 = = Cover = = 
 Steinman is credited with the album cover concept , which was illustrated by Richard Corben . The cover depicts a motorcycle , ridden by a long @-@ haired man , bursting out of the ground in a graveyard . In the background , a large bat perches atop a mausoleum that towers above the rest of the tombstones . In 2001 , Q magazine listed the cover as number 71 in its list of " The Hundred Best Record Covers of All Time . " 
 Steinman had wanted equal billing with Meat Loaf on the album 's title . He wanted it to be called " Jim Steinman presents ... " or " Jim and Meat , " or vice versa . For marketing reasons , the record company wished to make ' Meat Loaf ' the recognizable name . As a compromise , the words " Songs by Jim Steinman " appear relatively prominently on the cover . The singer believes that this was probably the beginning of their " ambivalent relationship . " 
 = = Title = = 
 The phrase " Bat Out of Hell " can be traced back to the Greek playwright Aristophanes ' 414 B.C. work titled The Birds . In it is what is believed to be the first reference to a bat out of Hell : 
 Near by the land of the <unk> there is a marsh , from the borders whereof the unwashed Socrates evokes the souls of men . Pisander came one day to see his soul , which he had left there when still alive . He offered a little victim , a camel , slit his throat and , following the example of Odysseus , stepped one pace backwards . Then that bat of a <unk> came up from hell to drink the camel 's blood . 
 Steinman registered " Bat Out of Hell " as a trademark in 1995 , and sought to prevent Meat Loaf from using the title . In 2006 , however , the singer sought to cancel Steinman 's trademark and use the title for Bat Out of Hell III : The Monster Is Loose . 
 In the film The Rocky Horror Picture Show , Eddie , the character played by Meat Loaf , is killed and then served as dinner . As the meal is rolled out , audience members now traditionally yell out , " Here comes Meat Loaf like a bat out of hell . " ( The phrase " Let me sleep on it " , from " Paradise by the Dashboard Light " , is yelled out at another point . ) Originally , the audience yelled out " What ? Meat Loaf again ? " until Meat Loaf 's album became a hit .

 Bat Out of Hell was released by Cleveland International on October 21 , 1977 . Cleveland International 's parent label was Epic Records , where almost everyone hated it . Steve Popovich , the head of Cleveland International Records , was relentless in his efforts to get Epic and all of CBS Records and radio on board . In 1993 , Steinman reflected that the album is " timeless in that it didn 't fit into any trend . It 's never been a part of what 's going on . You could release that record at any time and it would be out of place . " 
 Response to the album was slow . Steinman asserts that it was " underpromoted " , having a reputation of being " damaged goods because it had been walked around to so many places . " Due to the enthusiastic response to the music videos from the record Australia and England were the first to develop interest . The BBC television programme Old Grey Whistle Test aired a clip of the live band performing the nine @-@ minute title track . According to Classic Rock , response was so overwhelming , that they screened it again the following week . They later invited the band to perform " Paradise " live . " As a result , in the UK Bat became an unfashionable , uncool , non @-@ radio record that became a ' must @-@ have ' for everyone who heard it , whether they ' got ' Steinman 's unique perspective or not . " 
 The album was not an immediate hit ; it was more of a growing one . Bat Out of Hell still sells about 200 @,@ 000 copies per year and has sold an estimated 43 million copies worldwide , including 14 million in the United States and over 1 @.@ 7 million albums in Australia , where it is the second best @-@ selling album in the country behind John Farnham 's Whispering Jack ( 1 @.@ 73 million copies ) and even re @-@ entered the ARIA Charts in June 2007 , at # 34 . It stayed on the United Kingdom charts for 485 weeks , a feat surpassed only by the 522 weeks of Fleetwood Mac 's Rumours . In 1989 , Kerrang ! magazine listed the album at No. 38 among the " 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time " . In 2003 , the album was ranked number 343 on Rolling Stone magazine 's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time . In 2005 , Bat Out of Hell was ranked number 301 in Rock Hard magazine 's book of The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time . In 2006 it was voted number nine in a poll conducted by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to discover Australia 's most popular album . In November 2007 , Meat Loaf was awarded the Classic Album award in Classic Rock 's Classic Rock Roll Of Honour . 
 Reviews were initially mixed , but have since become much more positive . At first Rolling Stone called the songs " swell , but ... entirely mannered and derivative " and noted that the arrangements " aren 't bad " , although the musicians were commended . The review ended with the assertion that the " principals have some growing to do . " Modern reviews are more positive , however . Allmusic declares " this is Grand Guignol pop — epic , gothic , operatic , and silly , and it 's appealing because of all of this . " They acknowledge that Steinman is " a composer without peer , simply because nobody else wanted to make mini @-@ epics like this . " Rundgren 's production is applauded , as is the wit in the music and lyrics . " It may elevate adolescent passion to operatic dimensions , and that 's certainly silly , but it 's hard not to marvel at the skill behind this grandly silly , irresistible album . " 
 Also , Meat Loaf revealed on In the Studio with Redbeard that he was not well received early on in the tour when he was opening for Cheap Trick . In the same interview , Meat Loaf revealed that when he played at a CBS Records convention in 1978 , record executives and superstar Billy Joel ( who was in the audience ) gave Meat Loaf a standing ovation for his performance after a haunting rendition of the closing track " For Crying Out Loud " , and credits this as the turning point in the album 's success in the United States .

 In 1995 , Cleveland International sued Sony for unpaid royalties from sales of the album . Under the terms of the 1998 settlement agreement ending the suit , Sony agreed to include the Cleveland International logo on all future releases of the album . In 2002 , Stephen Popovich , founder of Cleveland International and the owner of the rights to its name , sued Sony , alleging that Sony had failed to include the Cleveland International logo on some copies of the album and on some compilations Sony released that included songs from the album . On May 31 , 2005 , the federal district court in Cleveland , Ohio , entered judgment against Sony pursuant to a jury verdict in favor of Popovich and awarded Popovich more than US $ 5 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in damages for Sony 's breach of the 1998 settlement agreement .

 = Miniopterus manavi = 
 Miniopterus manavi ( Manavi long @-@ fingered bat ) is a bat in the genus Miniopterus that occurs in east @-@ central Madagascar . First described in 1906 , this species was later included in the mainland African M. minor . A 1995 revision united populations of small Miniopterus from Madagascar and the Comoros as M. manavi , but molecular and morphological studies in 2008 and 2009 showed that this concept of M. manavi in fact included five different species . M. manavi itself was restricted to a few locations in the eastern Central Highlands and populations in the Comoros and northern and western Madagascar were allocated to different species . 
 Miniopterus manavi is a small , blackish or reddish @-@ brown Miniopterus ; its forearm length is 37 @.@ 6 to 39 @.@ 2 mm ( 1 @.@ 48 to 1 @.@ 54 in ) . The tragus ( a projection in the outer ear ) is narrow and ends in an angular tip . The uropatagium ( tail membrane ) is well @-@ furred and the palate is flat . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Miniopterus , a widespread genus of bats in Africa , southern Eurasia , and Australia , was first recorded from Madagascar by George Edward Dobson , who mentioned the larger Miniopterus schreibersii and the smaller M. <unk> ( currently M. natalensis ) in his 1878 catalog of the bats in the British Museum . In 1906 , Oldfield Thomas named the larger species M. majori and the smaller M. manavi . He regarded M. manavi as close to the mainland African M. minor , and in 1971 , R.W. Hayman and J.E. Hill placed it as a subspecies of that species . In their 1995 Faune de Madagascar review of Malagasy bats , however , Randolph Peterson and colleagues again separated M. manavi as a species , with M. manavi griveaudi ( currently Miniopterus griveaudi ) from Grande Comore as a subspecies . Peterson , who died before the review was completed , had originally divided M. manavi into several species occurring in different areas , but his collaborators decided conservatively to keep M. manavi as a single species , recommending reassessment of the status of those forms as new material would become available . 
 In the 2000s , molecular studies helped clarify the systematics of Miniopterus . In 2007 , Javier Juste and colleagues , using sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene , found that bats from Madagascar ( M. manavi ) , Grande Comore ( M. manavi griveaudi ) and São Tomé ( M. minor newtoni ; currently Miniopterus newtoni ) did not cluster together to the exclusion of other African Miniopterus ; however , their samples of " M. manavi " were in fact misidentified M. majori . The next year , Nicole <unk> and colleagues used cytochrome b and mitochondrial D @-@ loop sequences to assess the relationships of Comoran Miniopterus . They found two unrelated clades within Malagasy and Comoran samples of " Miniopterus manavi " , neither of which was closely related to M. newtoni or to Tanzanian samples of M. minor . 
 During 2009 , Steven Goodman and colleagues published two papers that found a total of five genetically and morphologically distinct species within Miniopterus manavi as defined by Peterson and colleagues ( 1995 ) , up to four of which can be found in a single locality . In order to determine the true identity of M. manavi , Goodman and Claude <unk> obtained bats near the type locality of M. manavi ( the site where the original material was collected , from which the species was described ) for inclusion in the analysis ; they also sequenced one of Thomas 's original specimens . Among the five species they identified , M. griveaudi occurs on Grande Comore and Anjouan and in northern and western Madagascar ; M. aelleni occurs on Anjouan and in northern and western Madagascar ; M. brachytragos is found in northern Madagascar only ; M. mahafaliensis is confined to the southwestern part of the island ; and M. manavi itself is known only from the eastern edge of the Central Highlands . These five species are not each other 's closest relatives according to analyses of cytochrome b sequences and their similarities reflect convergent evolution . Cytochrome b suggested that the closest relative of M. manavi is the slightly larger M. petersoni from southeastern Madagascar . Two specimens of M. manavi differed by 1 @.@ 3 % in their cytochrome b sequences and by 2 @.@ 5 % from M. petersoni . 
 = = Description = = 
 Miniopterus manavi is a diminutive species with fur of medium length . The upperparts are blackish or reddish brown . Other small Malagasy Miniopterus are lighter . The ears mostly lack hair and end in a rounded tip . The tragus ( a projection on the inner side of the outer ear ) is thin for most of its length , ends in an angular tip , and has a flange at the medial side ( towards the midline of the animal ) . The tragus is differently shaped in other species . The wings and uropatagium ( tail membrane ) are blackish and are attached to the upper leg at the same level , above the ankle . The uropatagium is densely haired above and more sparsely below , as in M. mahafaliensis and M. brachytragos ; M. griveaudi and M. aelleni have more nearly naked uropatagia . 
 In the single specimen of true M. manavi that Goodman and colleagues could measure , total length is 90 mm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) , tail length is 39 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) , hindfoot length is 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 24 in ) , tragus length is 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 24 in ) , ear length is 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 39 in ) , and body mass is 6 @.@ 4 g ( 0 @.@ 23 oz ) . The length of the forearm is known from four specimens ; it ranges from 37 @.@ 6 to 39 @.@ 2 mm ( 1 @.@ 48 to 1 @.@ 54 in ) , averaging 38 @.@ 5 mm ( 1 @.@ 52 in ) . 
 In the skull , the rostrum ( front part ) is rounded . The central groove in the nasal depression is relatively narrow . The frontal bones are inflated and bear a prominent sagittal crest . Further back on the braincase , the lambdoid crest is poorly developed . The middle part of the palate is flat , not concave as in M. brachytragos , M. griveaudi , and M. mahafaliensis . At the palate 's back margin is a short , thick posterior palatal spine . 
 = = Distribution and ecology = = 
 The currently known distribution of M. manavi extends around the eastern margin of the Central Highlands , from the vicinity of <unk> in the north to <unk> in the south , at 900 to 1 @,@ 500 m ( 3 @,@ 000 to 4 @,@ 900 ft ) above sea level . The 2008 IUCN Red List assesses the species as " Least Concern " , citing its wide distribution , though it is sometimes hunted for food . However , the account predates the recognition of M. aelleni , M. brachytragos , M. griveaudi , and M. mahafaliensis as separate species . Although some ecological data about M. manavi have been published , these need to be reevaluated with the recognition of numerous additional species within M. manavi . Species of Miniopterus generally feed on insects , breed seasonally , and roost in large colonies in caves . The <unk> mite <unk> <unk> has been recorded on M. manavi . 
 = Calgary Tigers = 
 The Calgary Tigers , often nicknamed the Bengals , were an ice hockey team based in Calgary , Alberta , Canada from 1920 until 1927 as members of the Big Four League , Western Canada Hockey League and Prairie Hockey League . The Tigers were revived in 1932 , playing for a short @-@ lived four years in the North Western Hockey League . They played their games at the Victoria Arena . 
 Created ostensibly as an amateur team in hopes of competing for the Allan Cup , the Tigers helped form the Western Canada Hockey League in 1921 to become the first major professional team in Calgary . In 1924 , after winning both the league and Western Canadian championships , the Tigers became the first Calgary based club to compete for the Stanley Cup . 
 After succumbing to financial pressures in 1927 , the Tigers were briefly revived in the mid @-@ 1930s as a minor professional club . The Tigers competed a total of eleven seasons in four leagues , winning four championships during their existence . Five Tigers players would later gain election to the Hockey Hall of Fame . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Big @-@ 4 League = = = 
 In 1919 , under the guidance of Alberta Amateur Hockey Association league president Allan McCaw , a new elite senior amateur league was established in Alberta with two teams each in Calgary and Edmonton . The Big @-@ 4 League 's intention was to compete for the Allan Cup , emblematic of Canada 's national senior championship . The Tigers were created in 1920 , along with the Canadians , to represent Calgary in the Big Four after the city 's two original teams , the Wanderers and Columbus Crew , withdrew following the league 's first season . The Tigers also faced the Edmonton Eskimos and Dominions who served as representatives of Alberta 's capital . The Calgary teams were hosted at the Victoria Arena , which had been converted into a hockey rink in 1918 . 
 While the Big @-@ 4 billed itself as an amateur circuit , it became known as a notorious example of a " <unk> " league , as amateur teams secretly employed professional players in an attempt to gain an upper hand on their competition . When the Big Four announced their intention to compete in the Allan Cup playdowns , the Pacific Coast Hockey Association sent a letter of protest to the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association demanding that the league be declared professional , thus ineligible to compete for the Allan Cup . The Big Four ultimately chose to withdraw from the <unk> , and operated as an independent league in 1920 – 21 . 
 The Tigers ' inaugural game was played at home on December 29 , 1920 as 2 @,@ 500 fans saw them defeat the Edmonton Dominions 6 – 1 on the strength of a goal and two assists by Gordon Fraser . Late in the season , the Canadians protested the use of goaltender Bill Tobin by the Edmonton Eskimos , arguing that he had not lived in Alberta long enough to be eligible per the league 's residency rules . Following a last minute change of one of the arbitrators , a three @-@ man panel denied the protest . The decision led the front @-@ running Tigers to refuse to play any series against the second @-@ place Eskimos for the league championship as the team felt the Canadians ' protest was improperly handled . Efforts to reach a compromise failed as the Edmonton clubs refused to allow the protest to be reconsidered , resulting in the collapse of the league on February 24 , 1921 . 
 The Tigers remained active despite the demise of the league , playing a series of exhibition games against the Saskatoon Crescents and a team from Moose Jaw . The Eskimos eventually agreed to face the Tigers without Tobin in an informal championship that was known as the Intercity Championship . The Tigers claimed the title on total @-@ goals as they defeated Edmonton 2 – 0 in the first game at Calgary before dropping the second 2 – 1 at Edmonton . The Tigers ended their season with a 2 – 0 exhibition loss to the defending Stanley Cup champion Ottawa Senators , who were touring the country as they travelled west to defend their title against the PCHA champion Vancouver Millionaires .

 The former Big Four teams joined with the Saskatoon Sheiks in forming a new professional league in 1921 that intended to compete against the National Hockey League and Pacific Coast Hockey Association . The Western Canada Hockey League was recognized as a major league and granted the right to compete for the Stanley Cup . Shortly before the inaugural season was set to begin , Calgary Canadians president Dr. C.E. Coleman and Tigers manager Eddie Poulin agreed amalgamate the two franchises under the Tigers name , allowing Calgary to present a unified front in the new league . 
 The Tigers played the first professional hockey game in Calgary on December 19 , 1921 , defeating the Regina Capitals 3 – 2 before a crowd of 3 @,@ 000 fans . The Tigers , Eskimos and Capitals battled for first place in the league , each team holding the top spot numerous times throughout the season . The Tigers and Capitals finished tied for second , forcing a two @-@ game , total @-@ goals playoff to determine who would meet the Eskimos for the league championship . In the series , the Capitals defeated the Tigers 1 – 0 in Calgary , while the two teams tied 1 – 1 in Regina sending the Capitals through by a 2 – 1 aggregate total . 
 Prior to the start of the 1922 – 23 season , the Tigers faced the Stanley Cup champion Toronto St. Patricks in two exhibition games . They defeated the St. Pats 7 – 5 in Calgary , and again 6 – 2 in a game held in Winnipeg , Manitoba . The WCHL and PCHA adopted an interlocking schedule for this season , with the Tigers struggling against their pacific coast opposition , winning just two of six games . Calgary finished third in the standings , behind Edmonton and Regina , as former Tiger Barney Stanley scored the winning goal against Calgary in a 2 – 1 victory by the Regina Capitals that eliminated Calgary from playoff contention . They ended the season with a 4 – 0 exhibition victory over the NHL 's Ottawa Senators in a game described as one of the " most sensational " games ever held in Calgary . 
 The 1923 – 24 season began with tragedy , as Tigers ' forward Foley Martin died of blood poisoning during the team 's season opening road trip to the pacific coast . The Tigers played on despite Martin 's death , winning two of three games against their PCHA rivals . The Tigers finished atop the league standings with 37 points . They met the Regina Capitals in the league championship in a two @-@ game , total goals series . After battling Regina to a 2 – 2 draw in the Saskatchewan capital , the Tigers returned home to Calgary , capturing the championship on home ice in a 2 – 0 victory . They then moved on to face the Vancouver Maroons of the PCHA in the best @-@ of @-@ three Western Canadian final . After dropping the first game in Vancouver , the Tigers came back to defeat the Maroons 6 – 3 at home , and again 3 – 1 at a neutral site game in Winnipeg , Manitoba . The victory earned the Tigers the right to play for the Stanley Cup , the first such opportunity for a Calgary @-@ based club . 
 Despite defeating the Maroons , the PCHA champions were not eliminated . Rather , the Tigers earned a bye into the finals , while Vancouver met the Montreal Canadiens in the semi @-@ final . The blue , blanc et rouge swept Vancouver in two games , setting the matchup for the 1924 Stanley Cup Finals where the Canadiens easily handled the Tigers . In the first game , played at Mount Royal Arena in Montreal , Canadiens rookie Howie Morenz recorded a hat trick as Montreal won 6 – 1 . Due to poor ice conditions , the second game was moved to the Ottawa Auditorium in Ottawa . Led by goaltender Georges Vezina , Montreal won 3 – 0 to sweep the series , and claim the Cup . 
 Calgary began the 1924 – 25 season with a series of exhibition games in eastern Canada . They faced the St. Pats and Senators , proving to be a popular draw in the capital as Ottawa fans lined up for tickets for the pair of games played . Additionally , the Tigers negotiated to face the NHL 's expansion Montreal Maroons if the newly constructed Montreal Forum was ready in time . Those games did not come to pass . In WCHL league play , the Tigers once again finished the regular season in first place . Led by Oliver 's team leading 20 goals , the Tigers earned a bye into the WCHL championship . Their opponent was the Victoria Cougars , who moved over to the WCHL following the collapse of the PCHA the previous summer . The Tigers were unable to earn a return trip to the Stanley Cup Finals , losing the two @-@ game total @-@ goals series 3 – 1 . The Cougars went on to become the last non @-@ NHL team to win the Stanley Cup . The Tigers struggled throughout the 1925 – 26 season , languishing in last place for most of the season until a 2 – 0 victory over Victoria on the last day of the season moved Calgary one point ahead of Vancouver to end the season . 
 The financial pressures of trying to keep up with rapidly escalating salaries took its toll on the league . The prairie clubs , including the Tigers , were struggling under financial hardships while a mild winter of 1925 – 26 reduced the quality of the natural ice at Victoria arena which , coupled with the team 's poor performance , reduced attendance . Manager Lloyd Turner confirmed on May 4 , 1926 that the Tigers were sold to the National Hockey League , along with the franchises in Edmonton , Regina , Victoria , Vancouver and Portland , and that the league had ceased operations . The six franchises were sold for $ 300 @,@ 000 . 
 Turner immediately began efforts to form a new team and league that would operate as a " class B " league , one level below the NHL . Three weeks after the collapse of the Western League , the Tigers were reformed as a charter member of the five team Prairie Hockey League . The team struggled to attract fans in the Prairie League , and consequently announced late in the season that it would cease operations after one year . The Tigers were successful on the ice , however , as they finished atop the league standings and met the Saskatoon Sheiks in a best @-@ of @-@ three series for the league title . Calgary dropped the first game , 2 – 1 in Saskatoon , but tied the series with a 2 – 1 victory in Calgary on the strength of two goals in the last five minutes by Andy <unk> . The Tigers were then awarded the league championship after the Sheiks defaulted the third game , refusing to play in opposition to the referee assigned for the deciding game . As Prairie champions , the Tigers traveled east to face the Winnipeg Maroons for the western Canadian professional championship . Calgary won the first game , then were awarded the title after the Maroons were unable to play the second game when the American Hockey Association re @-@ scheduled their league playoff series and created a conflict . The Tigers ended their season with exhibition games in the United States before the team was disbanded .

 In 1932 , the Tigers were revived as a charter franchise of a reformed , minor @-@ professional , Western Canada Hockey League . They opened the season with a 1 – 0 defeat in Edmonton on December 7 , 1932 in what was the first professional game for either city in six years , while a near capacity crowd of 4 @,@ 100 fans witnessed a 7 – 0 victory by the Tigers over the Eskimos two nights later in Calgary . The Tigers finished the season in first place with on the strength of giving up the fewest goals against during the season , but struggled to attract fans . Attendance declined throughout the season to a low of just 560 for their victory over Saskatoon in early March that clinched the league 's top record . Overall , the team averaged 2 @,@ 270 fans per game . Having earned a bye to the championship series , the Tigers faced the Eskimos in a best @-@ of @-@ five series marred by poor ice caused unseasonably warm weather in both cities . Following a 1 – 1 tie in the first game at Calgary , the league ordered the remaining games of the series be played in Edmonton due to the poor condition of the ice surface . The second game was also tied at 1 after bad ice in Edmonton forced it to be ended early . Two victories for the Eskimos pushed Calgary to the brink of elimination before the Tigers rebounded with a 5 – 1 victory in the fifth game . The ties earlier in the series forced the teams to a sixth game that also went to overtime tied at 1 before the Eskimos scored to win the championship after four minutes of an extra period . 
 The league reformed as the North Western Hockey League following the season after the Saskatchewan clubs dropped out and were replaced with three teams on the Pacific Coast . Calgary again won the regular @-@ season title in 1933 – 34 , advancing directly to the league championship , on the strength of a 12 – 3 victory over the Vancouver Lions in the final game of the regular season . Dutch Gainor won the league scoring title with 43 points . Fearing a repeat of the previous season 's playoff disaster , the league ordered Calgary to play their championship series against the Lions in Seattle and Vancouver as both cities had arenas capable of making artificial ice . The disadvantage did not affect the Tigers in the opening game of the series , a 5 – 2 victory at Seattle . The teams traded victories in the next three contests , ending in a 2 – 1 Vancouver win in the fourth game that tied the series at 2 wins apiece . Calgary won the championship with a 6 – 1 victory before a Vancouver crowd of over 6 @,@ 000 fans . 
 The 1934 championship would prove to be the Tigers ' last hurrah , as the team fell to the bottom of the NWHL standings in 1934 – 35 , winning only three games . They once again finished in last place in 1935 – 36 and were embroiled in another <unk> with Edmonton over the rights to a player as the Eskimos claimed they had gained the rights to Tony Savage from the Montreal Canadiens though he had already been sent to Calgary on loan . The Tigers issued an ultimatum to the league , threatening to disband for the season if Savage did not remain in Calgary . Savage ultimately remained with Calgary for the entire season . 
 1936 proved to be the final year for the Tigers , as the Great Depression and declining interest in professional hockey in favour of the senior game had threatened the team 's viability . After the Eskimos announced intentions to relocate to Victoria , British Columbia as part of a realignment of the league , Tigers ' manager Clair Manning contemplated relocating the franchise to Spokane , Washington . The team instead hoped to operate for another season in Calgary , but met its final demise after the NWHL reformed into the Pacific Coast Hockey League for 1936 – 37 and denied the Tigers ' application to join the new league .

 The WCHL 's short and unstable existence was a result of salary escalation caused by having three leagues competing for top talent . As a result , by the mid @-@ 1920s , hockey players were among the highest paid athletes in North America , with top players able to demand even higher salaries than the top baseball stars of the time . Though the WCHL lasted only five years , the Tigers boasted five future Hockey Hall of Famers on their roster during that time . 
 Barney Stanley , a former PCHA star , spent two seasons with the Tigers from 1920 – 22 . Joining the Tigers in the last season of the Big Four League , he once again turned pro when the Tigers joined the WCHL . Stanley led the Tigers in scoring with 26 goals in 1921 – 22 before being traded to Regina . Red Dutton , a World War I veteran who refused doctors orders to have his leg amputated after suffering a shrapnel wound , played 123 games with the Tigers before moving to the NHL where he played 449 more with the Montreal Maroons and New York Americans . Rusty Crawford , a former standout in the National Hockey Association and National Hockey League before the war , spent three seasons in Calgary from 1922 – 25 . Crawford recorded 19 goals in 64 games as a Tiger . 
 Herb Gardiner began his professional career in Calgary in 1920 , remaining with the Tigers until he was sold to the Montreal Canadiens in 1926 , where he would go on to win the Hart Memorial Trophy as NHL Most Valuable Player in 1927 . Harry Oliver also began his pro career in Calgary , playing with the Tigers from 1921 – 26 where he scored 90 goals before being sold to the Boston Bruins . Oliver would go on to play eleven seasons in the NHL with the Bruins and New York Americans .
