Beneath " The Streets " and the bell tower are the offices of the Dean of Students , the Registrar 's Office , and the Office of Residential Life . Until 1919 , the college consisted solely of Alumni Hall . Before this expansion , the monks lived on the second floor and students lived on the third and fourth floors . The first floor and basement had classrooms , a library and cafeteria . 
 = = = Saint Anselm Abbey Church and monastery = = = 
 The Abbey Church is the liturgical center of the college . It is frequently cited as the " heart of campus . " The upper church allows the college community to join with the monastic community for the daily celebration of the Eucharist and the Liturgy of the Hours . The lower church permits smaller groups of the community to assemble for worship and houses the Lady Chapel , the Saint Basil Byzantine Chapel , the former offices of Campus Ministry ( relocated to Cushing Center ) , and meeting rooms . The Lower Church is the location of the weekly 9 p.m. Mass held on Wednesday nights . The original monastery was Alumni Hall . An interim monastery existed between 1919 and 1955 in what is now Joseph Hall , adjacent to Alumni Hall . The current monastery , built in 1955 , is staffed with only a cook , as the monks perform all other tasks such as cleaning , maintenance and upkeep . Having four floors , including a basement , the monastery can house up to one hundred monks ; as of 2012 approximately 30 rooms were filled . The Dean of the College and several members of the board of trustees live in the monastery , as they are practicing Benedictine monks . Since 2012 , Abbot Mark Cooper , <unk> has been the fifth elected Abbot of Saint Anselm Abbey . Male students frequently dine in the monastery as guests ; they are required to comply with the Benedictine rule of silence while eating , which allows for contemplation and prayer . The monastery has a refectory , a smaller guest refectory , a smaller chapel , two welcoming rooms near the main entrance and is complete with elevator access to all four floors . The monastery also serves as the mother house for the Woodside Priory School and the abbot serves as the spiritual father for the monks who live there . Saint Anselm Abbey is a member of the American @-@ <unk> Congregation of the Benedictine Confederation . Saint Anselm Abbey was originally founded from Saint Mary 's Abbey in Newark , New Jersey . 
 = = = Geisel Library = = = 
 The Saint Anselm College Geisel Library has three floors and over 60 @,@ 000 square feet ( 5 @,@ 600 m2 ) of space housing books , resources and electronic equipment . The library is complete with several reference desks , over 30 computers , and the Institute of Saint Anselm Studies . On the second floor , there are three enclosed study areas ; two are group study rooms that are available for student use , and the third is named the <unk> Room , a locked , faculty @-@ only study . 
 Geisel Library 's collection of over 200 @,@ 000 books originated in a sack of books brought by Father Hugo Paff , O.S.B. from Saint Mary 's Abbey in Newark , New Jersey ; these books are still in the library and date back to the mid- to late @-@ 19th century . The college 's first library , shaped around this initial collection , was situated on the first floor of Alumni Hall . During the early years of the college , Benedictines served as librarians on an ad hoc basis , but by 1929 , Saint Anselm had its first official librarian , Father Cuthbert Redmond , O.S.B. New books were purchased under Father Edwin Davitt , O.S.B. By 1937 , Saint Anselm could boast 8 @,@ 000 books in several mini @-@ libraries , as well as the main repository , by this time located on the second floor . 
 The college performed a self @-@ study in 1950 that revealed the need for a larger library . Joseph Geisel , a prominent Manchester businessman , contributed $ 500 @,@ 000 in stock , and in 1959 the college broke ground on Geisel Library ; the library opened its doors in the fall of 1960 . The 20 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 900 m2 ) library featured reading rooms , study areas , a reference center , a music room , seating for 385 students , and space for 100 @,@ 000 volumes . Two expansions , one in 1973 and the final in 1992 , each increased the library 's area by 20 @,@ 000 square feet ( 1 @,@ 900 m2 ) . In 2012 , the college updated several areas of the library ; the computer work stations were moved , and new desks , tables , lamps , paint , couches and chairs , as well as the addition of two cutting @-@ edge " media : scape " tables , which are designed to facilitate online group work , were added . In addition , Internet Technology ( IT ) has moved its Help Desk to the library . 
 = = = Performing Arts – Dana Center = = = 
 The Dana Center for the Humanities is the premier performing arts center on the campus of Saint Anselm College . The center was home to the nationally recognized humanities program , " Portraits of Human Greatness " , and is also the headquarters for the student theater group , the Anselmian Abbey Players . The Anselmian Abbey Players have been a center of theater , culture and music on campus for over 60 years . This tradition began in the fall of 1949 with a production of " Career Angel " . Since then , this student @-@ run organization has enjoyed a long record of excellence . The Abbey Players offer students the opportunity to develop their artistic talents both on and off the stage , stressing the importance of self @-@ esteem , teamwork , and leadership . The Dana Center also hosts many touring companies throughout the year . These performances include classical theater , contemporary dance , concerts , and films . These performances attract visitors from throughout the region . On stage , international and domestic performers stage both traditional and modern programs ranging from contemporary Indian dance to Piedmont blues to Russian classical music . 
 The Dana Center has continued to be the site of the presidential debates since 2000 . In 2009 , the Saint Anselm College Choir earned the 8th most searched college choirs under Google search . 
 = = = Residence halls = = = 
 34 buildings on campus are devoted to student housing , with approximately 95 % of the student body living on campus . The majority of freshman males live in Dominic Hall , while most freshman females reside in either Joan of Arc Hall ( commonly referred to as JOA ) or <unk> Hall . Dominic Hall is a freshman dorm , located adjacent to the Coffee Shop and in close proximity to Alumni Hall and Bradley House . Dominic Hall houses over 205 students , offering mostly doubles , very few singles and several " quads " , or four @-@ person rooms . Dominic is affectionately nicknamed " Dirty Dom " ; however , new lights , windows , doors and ceiling tiles have been installed and the custodial staff cleans the hallways and communal bathrooms five days a week . Joan of Arc is a female freshman residence hall where double @-@ type rooms predominate . However , freshmen may be placed in any residence hall on campus . The Lowers are located near the NHIOP at the bottom of Saint Anselm Drive ; these apartments were built in the mid @-@ 1990s and have a kitchen , one and a half bathrooms , a family room and bedrooms . A similar setup is available in Uppers ; however , these dorms are slightly newer and are the favorite of seniors because they are located closer to central campus . Traditionally , residence halls have been single sex , though this began to change in the 2007 – 2008 academic year , when Brady Hall had female residents on its third floor while the bottom two floors were male . Hilary , Bertrand and Brady Halls are some of the largest on campus , as they can house over 120 students each . Holy Cross Hall , formerly named Building M has mostly singles and very few doubles ; these rooms connect to a central hallway , two bathrooms and a large common room to form a " Pod " . 
 = = = Joseph Hall = = = 
 The campus underwent a substantial facelift in 2009 , as new faculty offices and instructional spaces were created within the newly renovated Saint Joan of Arc Convent , which is now known as Joseph Hall . Joseph Hall is named after the third Abbot of Saint Anselm Abbey and former Bishop of Portland , Maine , Bishop Joseph John Gerry . At an estimated cost of $ 2 @.@ 5 million , Joseph Hall has a Bloomberg trading room , where business students learn to use a Bloomberg terminal for real @-@ time tracking of financial markets . Constructed in 1919 , Joseph Hall served as the first monastery outside of Alumni Hall for over 100 Benedictine monks . In 1955 , when the current abbey was built , the Sisters of Saint Joan of Arc , from Quebec , Canada moved in from Bradley House ( across campus ) , and the building was renamed the " Saint Joan of Arc Convent . " Their departure in 2008 ended over 50 years of service to the college , as the sisters were cooks , seamstresses and performed other domestic services for the monastic community .

 Construction began on " New Hall " in the summer of 2013 . The project was expected to cost over $ 9 @.@ 5 million and is situated near the lower entrance of campus in back of Brady Hall . The dorm is able to hold 150 students , and has expanded the residential options for undergraduates and should eliminate the need for triple occupancy rooms . The dormitory 's common spaces are air @-@ conditioned to a certain extent , while the individual rooms are not air @-@ conditioned . " New Hall " also features student @-@ friendly amenities such as a recycling room , bike storage , general storage space for students , and an elevator . Additionally , over 3 @,@ 000 square feet ( 280 m2 ) is dedicated to common space , including modern kitchenettes and individual study areas on each floor . 
 A new parking lot has been constructed on college @-@ owned land between Sullivan Arena and privately owned Clarke Farm in Bedford . This parking lot has replaced the former Joan of Arc parking lot , which was located between the Dana Center , Davison Dining Hall , and the Joan of Arc dormitory ( JOA ) . The former parking lot was torn down , and a grassy open quadrangle was constructed during the summer of 2012 . A grotto has been built between JOA and <unk> Hall and was dedicated in late 2014 , with the placement of a religious statue . The quadrangle is yet to be named , and has new lights and walkways ; the centerpiece is a large granite seal of the college . The project is the first place on campus where electronic gates have been installed . The gates are used to cordon off the roads of the new quad during the regular semester and can be opened for emergency vehicles and during move in / out days . 
 = = = Environmental responsibility = = = 
 Saint Anselm College RECYCLES was a greening movement which started on campus in 2009 . Up to that time , recycling was limited on campus , and students had to resort to their own methods of recycling containers and other recyclables in dorms . An impromptu recycling program — Saint Anselm College RECYCLES — was started through the Knights of Columbus and the Club Soccer organization that served the Uppers section of campus , every Saturday , averaging around 650 pounds of material per week . In the 2010 spring semester , this plan funded by Club Soccer and the Knights of Columbus provided over fifty recycle bins , purchased from the city of Providence , Rhode Island . In the spring of 2010 , the New Hampshire Institute of Politics installed seven recycling bins throughout its facilities . Inspired by this student @-@ led activity , the college 's physical plant purchased 120 bins for all of the apartments in the Uppers , Lowers and Falvey and Collins Houses . In the fall of 2010 , Physical Plant installed five Waste Management recycling dumpsters throughout campus . Campus @-@ wide recycling is planned by 2013 . 
 On May 22 , 2010 , Saint Anselm had its first " Green Graduation " . A proposal submitted by the three student founders of Saint Anselm College RECYCLES , Eric Ricci , Ryan McCarty , and Kevin McIntyre was accepted by the executive vice president of the college , Dr. Suzanne Mellon . Programs were printed on recycled paper , recycling containers were available for usage on the quad , plastic cups replaced bottled water , and water canisters replaced the large amounts of plastic required in previous years .

 According to the college website , Saint Anselm " seeks to help you develop into a precise and critical thinker , articulate and clear communicator , and an active and compassionate citizen . " Saint Anselm used to require the completion of a nationally recognized two @-@ year Humanities program . The " Portraits of Human Greatness " program began freshman year and would end at the completion of a student 's sophomore year . Seeking to develop a well @-@ rounded student , the College replaced the program with the " Conversatio " lecture series . However , this has caused significant outcry from some alumni , charging that this " new humanities program " is too watered down . After the addition of " Conversatio " in 2014 , the number of classes taken by full @-@ time students dropped from 5 classes to 4 classes per semester , with the credit hours of each class increasing . By studying the humanities , comprising art , science , literature , philosophy , and theology , faculty and students attempt to understand profound issues , specifically focusing on the human condition . In addition , three philosophy and three theology courses are required in order for a student to graduate . Two out of the three required courses for philosophy are " Nature and the Human Person " , which details the philosophy and psyche of the human being ; " Ethics " , which discusses issues ranging from medical to sexual ethics ; and an elective of the student 's choosing . One of the required theology courses is " Biblical Theology " , which is an overview of the Old and New Testaments of the Bible . 
 While the college does not have an established " Honor Code " , there is a " faith based honor code " , which requires students to remain faithful to the college 's mission , faith and identity .

 Saint Anselm College has resisted what the college sees as the grade inflation trend at many of America 's college 's and universities . At Saint Anselm , the top 25 % of the class has a 3 @.@ 1 GPA ; the median grade at the college is around a 2 @.@ 5 GPA . While the Dean 's List at most schools begin at a 3 @.@ 5 GPA , Saint Anselm awards students with the honor at a 3 @.@ 0 GPA . According to a 2006 Fox News article , former Dean of the College Father Peter Guerin , O.S.B. , is quoted as saying that today 's " parents may view universities as a consumer market in which they 're in a way paying for the diploma .... Students who attend class on a regular basis and are paying tuition feel that they should be receiving that A , even if they have not deserved it . " Some professors and administrators believe that inflating grades makes it harder for students to realize their academic strengths and weaknesses and may encourage students to take classes based on grade expectations . The practice also makes it harder for parents and students to determine whether or not the grade was earned . A curriculum committee was set up in 1980 to meet with the academic dean and review the grading polices on a monthly basis . The previous president of the college , Father Jonathan DeFelice , is quoted as saying , " I cannot speak for everyone , but if I 'm headed for the operating room , I will take the surgeon who earned his or her ' A ' the honest way " .

 Marc Ambinder , political editor of The Atlantic , described the role Saint Anselm plays in national politics by saying , " no one runs for president without speaking at St. A 's New Hampshire Institute of Politics . " U.S. News & World Report also ranked the college as the single , most popular location in New Hampshire for presidential candidates to visit . For over the past forty years , the New Hampshire Institute of Politics ( NHIOP ) has played host to hundreds of presidential aspirants that have delivered policy speeches at Saint Anselm College . It was founded on the basis that " educated and engaged citizens are vital for a healthy democracy . " The NHIOP houses the Politics department , as well as providing classroom space for use by all departments . The institute is credited with raising the national profile of the college by incorporating the college in the New Hampshire primary , the first primary of the United States presidential election . 
 The Institute was founded in 2001 through a nine million dollar grant which was secured by then U.S. Senator Judd Gregg from the National Institute of Standards and Technology . The idea of the Institute came from a series of conversations between Professors Kuehne and Manuel of the politics department and assistant vice president Anne <unk> . All involved believed in the potential that the college could harness from the New Hampshire primary through the college 's traditions and location . In December 1995 , Fr . Jonathan DeFelice asked Professor Manuel , as chairman of the politics department , to chair a committee to study the question and to make recommendations . A proposal was presented to the board of trustees by fellow trustee and former Massachusetts Senate president Kevin B. Harrington . Passing by a unanimous vote , the Institute was constructed in 2000 and dedicated on September 7 , 2001 . 
 The Institute consists of a 20 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 900 m2 ) building built in 2001 . The Institute contains six classrooms , four seminar rooms , an auditorium , television studio , offices for the college 's department of politics and Institute administration , the Common Ground cafe , a research center , and a computer lab . All of the classrooms are " smart classrooms " equipped with interactive whiteboards , LCD projectors , and built in audio and video equipment . The television studio is the only live video production and broadcast studio in the Greater Manchester area . Television journalists can interview individuals , including Saint Anselm 's experts , politicians , business and civic leaders , remotely from the studio without requiring a TV crew on site or the source to travel to the network . Operated in partnership with <unk> , the studio is equipped with <unk> technology that allows <unk> to control the camera and lighting remotely from their Boston headquarters . 
 The Washington Post recently referred to Saint Anselm College as " the Benedictine college with a box seat on America 's most riveting political theater " , as the college and institute have both played major roles in the New Hampshire primary . CNN contributor and former Harvard Institute of Politics chair Jennifer Donahue was the institute 's political director from 2002 to 2009 . The current director of the institute is Neil Levesque . 
 Steve Scully , host , senior producer , and political editor of C @-@ <unk> Washington Journal , is among the directors of the institute . 
 The Kevin B. Harrington Student Ambassador Program is an academic program through the New Hampshire Institute of Politics ; it is named after the late Massachusetts State Senator Kevin B. Harrington , who was a member of the Saint Anselm College Board of Trustees and an instrumental force in the creation of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics itself . Student Ambassadors play an important role in supporting special events , giving tours of the institute , welcoming and introducing presidential and congressional candidates , public figures and a range of scholars who headline the institute 's special events and public programs . 
 Its youth programs are modeled after those of the Sorensen Institute for Political Leadership in Virginia . 
 The Public Advisory Board , established by Father Jonathan DeFelice in 2008 seeks to help the Institute expand its role in both state and national dialogues . Board members include U.S. Senator Judd Gregg ( Chair ) , former United States Congressman Paul Hodes , New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner ( Vice @-@ Chair ) , 2010 Massachusetts gubernatorial candidate Charlie Baker , Time magazine 's Mark Halperin , U.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte , and John <unk> , member of the White House Council for Community Solutions .

Similarly , in June 2007 the college hosted two national debates , sponsored by CNN , for candidates of the Republican and Democratic Party . In 2008 , the college hosted the back @-@ to @-@ back ABC / Facebook / WMUR debates on January 5 , 2008 . Saint Anselm College students volunteered and became " runners " for the Fox News , CNN and ABC debates ; students have had the unique opportunity to meet many Presidential candidates and media personalities . In his welcoming address to the class of 2012 , President Father Jonathan DeFelice said , " Almost from the first day of classes you will have the opportunity that many other college students will not have – to meet candidates and media experts , political reporters and analysts from all over our country . " On June 13 , 2011 , the college partnered with CNN , WMUR , and the New Hampshire Union Leader to host the first Republican presidential primary debate in New Hampshire for the 2012 campaign . Similarly , in January 2012 , the college hosted an ABC national debate . On August 3 , 2015 , the college partnered with C @-@ SPAN and a long and unusual list of co @-@ sponsors to host a nationally @-@ broadcast candidate forum , three days before the first officially @-@ RNC @-@ sanctioned debate on FOX .

 The institute has attracted notable speakers , including then @-@ presidential candidate Barack Obama and former presidents of the United States George W. Bush , Bill Clinton , George H. W. Bush , Ronald Reagan , Gerald Ford , Richard Nixon , and John F. Kennedy . 
 President John F. Kennedy gave a historic speech at Saint Anselm College on March 5 , 1960 , regarding America 's conduct in the new realities of the emerging Cold War . The speech was the first time that Kennedy detailed how American foreign policy should be conducted towards African nations , noting a hint of support for modern African nationalism by saying , " for we , too , founded a new nation on revolt from colonial rule . " According to a Time magazine article from February 8 , 1960 @,@ 
 " ... a motorcade of students from St. Anselm 's College gave him an <unk> welcome from 35 automobile horns , then mobbed him with such enthusiasm that Jack had to climb into an open convertible in order to be seen . Afterward , the college kids dragged out a reluctant donkey ( rented for $ 20 by the efficient Kennedy organization ) , then followed Kennedy into a supermarket , waving homemade college @-@ humor signs ( PUT <unk> IN THE <unk> <unk> , PUT A NEW JOHN IN THE <unk> HOUSE ) . " 
 While at the college , Kennedy said the famous line , " I forgot my Nixon button . " 
 The day after declaring his candidacy for the 1968 election , President Richard Nixon 's first stop was at Saint Anselm College where a reception was held . At the college , on February 3 , 1968 , Nixon unveiled his campaign strategy regarding the Vietnam War by saying , " let 's help them fight the war , and not fight the war for them . " The ramifications of this policy , first voiced at the college had a profound effect on the 1968 presidential campaign and the war in Vietnam . 
 = = = Former presidential candidates and other notable speakers = = = 
 Hundreds of presidential candidates have toured and spoken at the college over the past fifty years . More recent speakers have ranged from current Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to the 2008 Republican nominee John McCain . In the weeks before the 2008 election , John McCain 's comeback campaign returned to New Hampshire where McCain held a rally in Sullivan arena in front of a crowd of over two thousand students , faculty , staff and visitors from the community . A group of eight students painted the word " M @-@ A @-@ V @-@ E @-@ R @-@ I @-@ C @-@ K " across their chests and lined up next to each other atop the stands behind McCain . 
 In March 2010 , the former head of the U.S. Central Command and four star U.S. Army General David Petraeus lectured at the Dana Center for the Humanities through a NHIOP sponsored program ; the change of venue was required because the Institute 's auditorium could not accommodate the six hundred plus students , faculty and staff in attendance . This lecture in particular generated national media attention as rumors spread about Petraeus planning to run for the 2012 presidential election . Petraeus highlighted how America has begun to implement the same counter insurgency strategy which worked in Iraq to Afghanistan . 
 The following candidates have participated in one of the many national debates held by the college over the years – the current President of the United States Barack Obama , former New York senator Hillary Clinton , Arizona senator John McCain , Jon Huntsman , Kansas senator Sam Brownback , former Alaska senator Mike Gravel , Connecticut senator Joe Lieberman , former Democratic nominee for the 2004 election , John Kerry , former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney , former Vermont governor Howard Dean , former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee , New Mexico governor Bill Richardson , Ohio congressman Dennis Kucinich , Congressman Ron Paul , Ralph Nader , General Wesley Clark and many more . 
 Former Republican candidate Sam Brownback 's visit attracted the negative attention of the national media as the image of Brownback at the podium speaking to a mostly empty room epitomized his failing candidacy . In 1972 , the eventual Democratic nominee for United States presidential election George McGovern visited the college and after his speech jokingly declared he would become a vice presidential candidate , as he was clearly the front runner . 
 Inside the Institute 's main hallway hangs over one hundred images that represent the college 's role in the political process ; former Missouri congressman Richard Gephardt once recognized a picture of an elderly woman holding a sign " Gephardt for President " in a rather emotional moment as his own mother . It is not uncommon to run into current New Hampshire senator Jeanne Shaheen or then @-@ senator John E. Sununu , New Hampshire governor John Lynch , former New Hampshire governors Judd Gregg , Craig Benson and Steve Merrill in the hallways , guest lecturing in classrooms or leaving the politics department after conversing with faculty ; some faculty are politicians – New Hampshire Senator Lou D <unk> is a faculty member of the politics department . 
 Many of the modern media personalities have lectured at the institute on topics ranging from their predictions during the 2008 New Hampshire primary to hosting live campaign coverage on the quad , as seen in the image to the right . Fox News Channel 's Brit Hume and Christopher Wallace both reported live from the " Fox @-@ Box " in both 2004 and 2008 as Alumni Hall served as a backdrop for the primary . For the 2012 Fox News New Hampshire Primary coverage , the college showed live shots of Alumni Hall and reported live from Davison Dining Hall . The former anchor of ABC 's World News Tonight , Peter Jennings had reported live from the north side of Alumni Hall during nightly broadcasts of his show during the primary . CNN 's well known personality Wolf Blitzer was the moderator for the national 2007 debates held in the college 's Sullivan Arena . , ABC News correspondent and television personality Barbara Walters has visited the college on several occasions , hosting the presidential national debate in 1984 . Bob Schieffer , the host of CBS 's Face The Nation broadcast live from , " historic Saint Anselm College 's Alumni Hall " in June 2007 to interview then candidate John Edwards and his former wife Elizabeth Edwards ; in addition to this interview , Mr. Edwards has visited the college on numerous campaign stops talking with students and dropping by classrooms in the institute building . 
 Journalists who work for many major media outlets stop by the college in the years between the primary when in the area . Time magazine 's editor @-@ at @-@ large and political analyst Mark Halperin is one of twenty or so members of the Public Advisory Board set up by the President of the college , Father Jonathan DeFelice Washington Post columnist , and Senior Research Fellow E. J. Dionne lectured in 2007 at the Institute and spoke during an American Government politics <unk> and Senior editor of The Weekly Standard William Kristol . 
 The college has been honored with the visit of two Secretaries of State , the former Madeleine Albright , and the current Hillary Clinton . 
 In August 2012 , Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan held a town hall event for 3 @,@ 000 plus people on the college quad . The event was covered by all of the national media outlets not only because it was Mitt Romney 's 100th town hall event , but it was the first time since announcing that Paul Ryan would be his running mate , that the two appeared in New England . As is often with television " live shots " from the Alumni Hall , the Abbey bells tolled at 11 : 00 , interrupting Paul Ryan during his remarks . This caused Romney to quip , " Only a Catholic guy ( Paul Ryan ) would be able to get the bells to toll just at the right time at Saint Anselm " .

Annually , some 850 students , faculty , and staff volunteer more than 16 @,@ 000 community service hours . The Princeton Review has described the Meelia Center as " the nerve center of Saint Anselm 's bustling service community " , adding that " the center , according to the school , ' employs nearly sixty student service leaders , who in turn recruit , place , and support over 200 volunteers and 210 service learners each semester who perform weekly service in over thirty community agencies .

 = = Student publications = = 
 The Saint Anselm Crier , founded in the early 1960s as " The Anselmian Crier " is the student newspaper of Saint Anselm College . It is published twice monthly when school is in session . The Crier won the 2008 – 2009 First Place Scholastic Newspaper Award from the American Scholastic Press Association . In 2009 , The Saint Anselm Crier adopted new terminology designating the publication as the " independent " student newspaper instead of the " official " student newspaper of Saint Anselm College . This was done to separate student opinion from official college news released by Saint Anselm 's public relations department . 
 The Hilltop , founded in 2009 , was an independent student newsletter . It was published bi @-@ weekly , and sought to provide substance over entertainment and integrity over controversy , as some students had supported this publication over the " Crier . " claiming the latter 's quality had deteriorated . In the Fall of 2010 , " The Hilltop " merged with " The Saint Anselm Crier " after an agreement was made at the urging of the " Crier 's " advisor , Fr . Jerome Day , O.S.B. , PhD. who claimed that Saint Anselm College is not large enough for two student newspapers . " The Hilltop 's " staff agreed to become part of the " Crier 's " staff and " The Saint Anselm Crier " will attempt to focus on its quality , including a page called the " The Hilltop " devoted to substantial issues . 
 The Saint Anselm Whiner , founded in February 2010 , is an underground joke newspaper independently published by a group of anonymous students . It is published bi @-@ weekly .

 Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis is a table tennis simulation video game developed by Rockstar San Diego and published by Rockstar Games . The game was first released for the Xbox 360 on May 23 , 2006 in North America , and on May 26 , 2006 in Europe . It was later released for the Wii on October 17 , 2007 in North America , and on October 19 , 2007 in Europe . The game is a realistic simulation of the sport table tennis , with the main objective to make the opponent fail to hit the ball . 
 The game features various methods of serving and returning the ball , designed for players to beat their opponent . Players can compete against the game 's artificial intelligence , while the game 's multiplayer mode lets two players compete in matches , either through local multiplayer or online . Initially developed specifically for the Xbox 360 console , the development team took advantage of the hardware 's graphical power , allowing the game to play at a faster pace than with previous hardware . The game was the first to be developed using Rockstar 's proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine , later used in games such as Grand Theft Auto IV and Red Dead Redemption . 
 Its announcement in March 2006 led to confusion and surprise , due to its significantly different style from Rockstar 's previous projects . It received generally positive reviews upon release , with praise particularly directed at its simplicity , replayability and detailed visuals . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis is a realistic simulation of the sport of table tennis . In the game , two players hit a ball back and forth from one another . The goal of the game is to make the opponent fail to return the ball . Players have the ability to challenge a multiplayer partner , either offline or online , or can select to challenge the game 's artificial intelligence . Players can select from a roster of eleven characters , which are unlocked as they progress through the game ; each character has particular skills in different areas . The game features two modes : Tournament , which involves players participating against a variety of players in different circuits ; and Exhibition , which involves players challenging individual opponents in non @-@ ranked matches . 
 When preparing to serve the ball , players enter a stance . During this stance , players aim the ball , followed by selecting the amount of spin and power to place on the ball , as indicated by the spin meter . Players can also place a level of spin on their ball , curving it in a different direction . After the opponent returns the ball , players have the ability to " charge " their shots . As the shots are charged , the Focus meter increases ; when the meter fills , players enter the Full Focus state , in which their shots are faster and more accurate . Players can also perform soft shots and smashes , respectively decreasing and increasing the speed of the ball , and Focus Shots , high powered returns that help players counter difficult shots . 
 The Wii port of the game offers three different control schemes : Standard , using the Wii Remote ; Sharp Shooter , which uses the Nunchuk 's analog control to place the ball ; and Control Freak , using the Nunchuk 's analog stick to control the player 's position . 
 = = Development = = 
 Preliminary work on Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis began in 2005 , prior to the announcement of the Xbox 360 , which the game was developed for . Rockstar San Diego , the core team behind the game , found that the hardware allowed them to develop games at a faster pace than with the previous hardware . Rockstar president Sam Houser felt that Rockstar San Diego was a suitable developer for the game due to their demonstration of skill in developing advanced engines , particularly early in a console generation , citing Midnight Club : Street Racing and Smuggler 's Run ( both 2000 ) , which were launch games for the PlayStation 2 . Houser also said that , though the game 's physics were achievable on the old hardware , the team waited for the possibility to develop for the Xbox 360 due to the " different level of production and technology " that it allowed . In developing the game 's concept , the team was fascinated with concentrating the entire power of a particular hardware into one activity . The game runs off the proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine ( RAGE ) , and is the first game to do so ; the engine was later used for other projects such as Grand Theft Auto IV ( 2008 ) , Red Dead Redemption ( 2010 ) , Max Payne 3 ( 2012 ) and Grand Theft Auto V ( 2013 ) . 
 Network programmer John <unk> found the development of the online multiplayer mode challenging , due to the level of realism the development team attempted to create . In addition , the speed and accuracy required for the game was also a challenge for the team , due to the fast pace of the matches . When discussing the possibility of porting the game to the Wii , the team agreed almost immediately , as they felt that the console was a " perfect fit " for the game . While developing the Wii version , the team particularly considered how to serve all types of players , thus allowing a range of different control schemes . 
 The game was first announced by Rockstar Games on March 3 , 2006 . Journalists noted the surprised reactions that the announcement caused within the gaming industry , which they owed to the game 's significant difference when compared to Rockstar 's reputation of developing mature titles . The game was released for the Xbox 360 on May 23 , 2006 in North America , and on May 26 , 2006 in Europe . On July 18 , 2007 , Rockstar announced that the game would be ported to the Wii , taking advantage of the motion sensing Wii Remote . The Wii version was released on October 17 , 2007 in North America , and on October 19 , 2007 in Europe .

Tom Orry of VideoGamer.com felt that the visuals improve the gameplay , particularly applauding smaller details such as the player models and ball physics . 
 Many reviewers found the gameplay simple yet effective . Perry of IGN found the gameplay " deep and addictive " , and the controls intuitive . GamesRadar 's Amrich echoed similar remarks , writing that the controls " feel accessible without alienating ' serious ' sports gamers " , and Orry of VideoGamer.com called the controls " slick " . Eurogamer 's Tom Bramwell also praised the game 's simplicity . 
 The game 's multiplayer mode was commended by many reviewers . GamesRadar 's Amrich felt that the multiplayer mode extended the game 's replayability , giving players a reason to return to the game " long after [ they 've ] learned the weaknesses " of the playable characters . Orry of VideoGamer.com and Bramwell of Eurogamer both named the online multiplayer " excellent " ; the former noted minor lag but wrote that the " performance was generally very good " . 
 When the game was ported to the Wii , the additional Wii Remote controls received positive reactions . IGN 's Mark Bozon felt that they were an improvement over the original controls , calling it a " huge testament to Rockstar 's design " . Eurogamer 's Ellie Gibson found that the altered controls work " perfectly " , finding them intuitive and " easy to grasp " . GameSpot 's Davis wrote that the controls " work pretty well " , though felt that they fail to complement the gameplay . Conversely , Orry of VideoGamer.com felt that the original controls " have more depth " than those on the Wii . 
 Following its previews at the Electronic Entertainment Expo , the game won Best Sports Game from GameSpot , and received a nomination from IGN . At the end of the year , the game received nominations for Best Sports Game from GameTrailers . 
 = Thomas White ( Australian politician ) = 
 Sir Thomas Walter White , KBE , DFC ( 26 April 1888 – 13 October 1957 ) was an Australian politician and First World War pilot . He was one of the first airmen trained for the Australian Flying Corps in 1914 , and among the first to see action when he deployed to the Middle East with the Mesopotamian Half Flight in 1915 . He was captured in November that year but escaped in July 1918 . Awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and twice mentioned in despatches , White began his parliamentary career in 1929 when he was elected Member for Balaclava in Victoria . He served as Minister for Trade and Customs in Joseph Lyons ' United Australia Party government from 1932 to 1938 , but resigned when he was excluded from Lyons ' inner cabinet . He joined the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) during the Second World War and saw service in Australia and the United Kingdom . Returning to parliament as a member of the newly formed Liberal Party in 1945 , he served as Minister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation in Robert Menzies ' government from 1949 to 1951 . His term coincided with the commitment of RAAF squadrons to the Korean War and the Malayan Emergency . Australia 's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom from 1951 to 1956 , White was knighted in 1952 and died in October 1957 . 
 = = Early life and First World War = = 
 Thomas Walter White was born on 26 April 1888 at Hotham , North Melbourne , the son of Charles James White , a brass @-@ finisher from England , and Emily Jane Jenkins of Victoria . Educated at Moreland State School , White was commissioned in the 5th Australian Regiment , Citizen Military Forces ( CMF ) , in 1911 . In August 1914 , two weeks after the outbreak of the First World War , he became one of the first four students to commence training at Point Cook as a pilot in the Australian Flying Corps ( AFC ) . He was later described by a biographer as " pugnacious and impatient for success , with a disdain for authority and a suspicion of elites " . White recalled flying in the school 's Bristol Boxkite thus : " The senses took the place of the instruments . One 's eyes and ears did duty as engine counters ; the rush of the air in the face told whether the climb or glide was at the right angle . " He graduated with his four fellow students , who included future Chief of the Air Staff ( Sir ) Richard Williams , in November . 
 In April 1915 , White was appointed a captain in the Australian Imperial Force and adjutant of the Mesopotamian Half Flight , the first AFC unit to see active service . Based initially in Basra and operating primitive Maurice Farman biplanes , the Half Flight assisted the Indian Army during the Mesopotamian campaign , conducting reconnaissance and sabotage missions . White successfully carried out several operations that involved landing behind enemy lines . On a mission in October 1915 , he was forced to land owing to engine trouble and , rather than risk attempting repairs , taxied the aircraft some twenty @-@ four kilometres ( fifteen miles ) past enemy encampments while his observer kept watch with his rifle at the ready ; the " Keystone Cops adventure " , as historian Alan Stephens described it , culminated in the engine finally powering up and allowing White to take off and fly to the safety of the Australian base . White himself touted the feat as " a taxi @-@ ing record " . 
 On 13 November 1915 , White was captured while attempting to cut telegraph wires near Baghdad . He was mentioned in despatches in July 1916 . Imprisoned in Turkey , he escaped from a train in Constantinople in July 1918 , and managed to stow away on a cargo ship to Odessa , Ukraine , before travelling to London . His experience of the Soviets in Odessa helped inform his subsequent anti @-@ communism . White was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in June 1919 . In December , he was again mentioned in despatches , for " valuable services whilst in captivity " . Still in London , he met Vera Deakin , daughter of former Australian Prime Minister Alfred Deakin , and promptly became engaged to her . White was discharged from the AIF in January 1920 , and married Vera on 22 March at St John 's Church of England in Toorak , despite the opposition of some of the Deakin family . That year he also became managing director of his father 's hardware company , C.J. White & Sons Pty Ltd . From 1926 to 1931 , he commanded the 6th Battalion , CMF , as a lieutenant colonel . In 1928 he published an account of his wartime exploits as Guests of the Unspeakable .

 White ran unsuccessfully as a Nationalist for the House of Representatives seat of Maribyrnong in the 1925 elections . In 1927 , he failed to win the Victorian Legislative Assembly seat of Prahran . Denied pre @-@ selection as a Nationalist for the Senate the following year , he won the seat of Balaclava at a by @-@ election held on 3 August 1929 . He succeeded retiring member William Watt . The United Australia Party ( UAP ) came to power in the 1931 elections and in March 1933 he was appointed Minister for Trade and Customs in the first Lyons Ministry , replacing Henry Gullett , who had stood down due to ill @-@ health . White had given up the directorship of C.J. White & Sons the previous year . His portfolio was responsible for reducing tariffs and attempting to increase trade with Britain as opposed to the United States and Japan , and also with book and film censorship ; for the latter he established an advisory board , chaired by Robert Garran , to make recommendations to him . In 1934 , White became Australian chairman of the Royal Life Saving Society , serving until 1951 ; he was also an active supporter of such organisations as Legacy and the Royal Flying Doctor Service . 
 In July 1938 , White represented Australia at an inter @-@ governmental conference on Jewish refugees held at Évian , France , to discuss the growing numbers of Jewish emigrants seeking to leave Germany and occupied territories . He expressed remorse after listening to stories from refugees during the conference , but ultimately hedged his offer of support , saying that , " As we have no real racial problem , we are not desirous of importing one by encouraging any scheme of large @-@ scale foreign migration " . Australia would go on to accept 15 @,@ 000 refugees over three years . White 's reaction to the Australian government 's support for the Munich Agreement was to <unk> : " I think we should hang our heads that we did not stand up to the bully of Europe ... It may yet mean peace but at what price ? " He called for stronger preparations at home in case of war , including the introduction of conscription . On 8 November 1938 , he resigned his portfolio , having discovered that Joseph Lyons had established an inner cabinet from which he was excluded . Lyons ' response in parliament to White 's resignation publicly highlighted the divisions in the UAP . White stood for the UAP 's leadership after Lyon 's death the following year but was eliminated early in the balloting , and Robert Menzies eventually became leader . 
 With the outbreak of the Second World War , White became a flight lieutenant ( temporary squadron leader ) in the part @-@ time Citizen Air Force . He took leave from parliament in April 1940 and was appointed the inaugural commanding officer of No. 1 Initial Training School at Somers , Victoria . The following year he travelled to England , where he administered Australian airmen at Bournemouth , served as Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) Liaison Officer with RAF Training Command , and commanded RAF Station Brighton . According to the Parliamentary Library of Australia , White also " surreptitiously flew on several sorties as a second @-@ pilot " . He paid tribute to the men of the Empire Air Training Scheme with the narrative poem Sky Saga in 1943 . Returning to Melbourne later that year , White served at RAAF Staff School until his discharge as an honorary group captain in October 1944 . The same month , he attended the conference that resulted in the establishment of the Liberal Party ; the new party was officially launched in August 1945 . 
 Following the election of the Menzies Liberal government in the 1949 elections , White was appointed Minister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation , despite his personal animosity for Menzies , which partly stemmed from the latter 's failure to serve in the First World War . In January 1950 , White and the Minister for Supply and Development , Richard Casey , announced that the English Electric Canberra had been selected to replace the RAAF 's Avro Lincoln bombers , and that the new jet would be manufactured by the Government Aircraft Factory in Victoria . White 's term as Minister for Air saw the deployment of RAAF squadrons to the Korean War and the Malayan Emergency in mid @-@ 1950 , and the establishment of the Women 's Royal Australian Air Force , the successor organisation to the wartime Women 's Auxiliary Australian Air Force , that November . The following year he gave his approval for the manufacture of a licensed version of the North American F @-@ 86 Sabre jet fighter for the RAAF , and played a major part in the controversial decision to replace the long @-@ serving Chief of the Air Staff , Air Marshal ( Sir ) George Jones , with an RAF officer , Air Vice Marshal ( later Air Chief Marshal Sir ) Donald Hardman . White also sought to strengthen the Citizen Air Force , and personally ordered the establishment of No. 24 ( City of Adelaide ) Squadron at Mallala , South Australia .

 On 21 June 1951 , White resigned from parliament to become Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom , a position he held until 1956 . He was succeeded as the member for Balaclava by Liberal Percy <unk> . White was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in January 1952 . As High Commissioner he advocated continued British migration to Australia , and participated in the renewal of the assisted passage scheme between the two countries in 1954 . He suffered from emphysema and on 13 October 1957 died of a heart attack at his home in the Melbourne suburb of South Yarra . Survived by his wife and four daughters , he was accorded a state funeral at St Paul 's Cathedral , Melbourne , and interred at Point Lonsdale cemetery . His daughters donated his papers to the National Library of Australia in 1997 and 1998 .

 " It was a hard decision , and this was not remotely having to do with us wanting to upgrade the acting ability or jump the character in age . The twins who play the part ( Jaden and Ella Hiller ) were not happy . We started feeling like we were just being mean to these little girls , making them come to the stage .

 Joel Stuart Otto ( born October 29 , 1961 ) is an American former professional ice hockey center in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) for the Calgary Flames and Philadelphia Flyers . An undrafted player , Otto signed with the Flames as a free agent in 1984 and played 11 seasons with the team . He was one of the top defensive centers in the league during his career and one of the NHL 's best at faceoffs ; Otto was a two @-@ time finalist for the Frank J. Selke Trophy . He was known for his confrontations with Mark Messier as part of the Flames ' rivalry with the Edmonton Oilers and was a member of Calgary 's 1989 Stanley Cup championship winning team . He joined the Flyers in 1995 , with whom he played three seasons . 
 Otto was a frequent member of the United States national team . He played in two World Championships and two Canada Cups , captaining the United States to the final in 1991 . Otto was a member of the team that won the inaugural World Cup of Hockey in 1996 and played in the 1998 Winter Olympics .

 Otto was never drafted , and upon graduation , sought opportunities from National Hockey League ( NHL ) clubs . The teams he contacted offered only a try @-@ out , some insisting he pay his own way . Finally , his agent contacted Cliff Fletcher , general manager of the Calgary Flames , who offered him a contract to play for the Moncton Golden Flames , their American Hockey League ( AHL ) affiliate . Otto agreed , scored 63 points in 56 games for the Golden Flames in the 1984 – 85 AHL season and appeared in 17 games with Calgary . He made his NHL debut on November 23 , 1984 , against the St. Louis Blues . On March 1 , 1985 , he recorded his first point , an assist , against the Montreal Canadiens . He scored his first goal two nights later against goaltender Darren Eliot of the Los Angeles Kings . 
 Otto established himself as a top defensive forward for the Flames in 1985 – 86 . Coach Bob Johnson discovered his niche when he had Otto shut down Marcel Dionne , the top player of the Los Angeles Kings . Afterward , Otto was consistently used against the opposition 's top line where he used his size and faceoff ability to his advantage . He was most famous for shadowing Mark Messier of the Edmonton Oilers when the Battle of Alberta reached its peak in the late 1980s . Otto later remarked that Messier was the reason he was in the NHL , as the Flames needed a big center who could match Messier physically , especially in the faceoff circle . 
 Johnson also used Otto in front of the opposition net to screen the goaltender . He struggled offensively early in the 1985 – 86 season , scoring only two goals in the first third of the year , but as he grew in confidence and saw increasing ice time , his offense improved . Otto finished the season with 25 goals and 59 points . He added 5 goals and 15 points in the playoffs as the Flames reached the Stanley Cup final . The Flames lost the series in five games to the Montreal Canadiens . 
 Continuing to chip in on offense in the following seasons , Otto scored at least 50 points in each of his first four full seasons . He reached the 20 @-@ goal mark for the second time in 1988 – 89 , a season he ended on an 11 @-@ game point scoring streak . The Flames entered the 1989 Stanley Cup Playoffs as the top team in the NHL , and a prohibitive favorite against their first round opponent , the Vancouver Canucks . Nonetheless , the Canucks forced the Flames into overtime of the seventh and deciding game of the series . Late in the first overtime period , Otto rushed toward the net as Jim Peplinski carried the puck up the right side boards . Peplinski 's shot deflected off Otto 's skate and past Vancouver goaltender Kirk McLean . Otto was credited with the series @-@ winning goal . He scored a total of 19 points in 22 playoff games as the Flames won their first Stanley Cup championship in franchise history . 
 Considered one of the league 's best faceoff men and a top two @-@ way forward , Otto was frequently the subject of inquiries by other teams in trade talks , which the Flames refused . He scored his 100th career goal on October 30 , 1990 , against the New Jersey Devils and his 300th point on October 4 , 1991 , against Edmonton . He was the Flames ' nominee for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy in 1991 – 92 , a league award given for dedication and perseverance . His role with the Flames changed into the 1990s as the team placed greater emphasis on his defensive play into the 1990s , though he surpassed 50 @-@ points for the fifth time in 1992 – 93 . Otto was also named a finalist for the Frank J. Selke Trophy as the league 's top defensive forward that season . He was again named a finalist for the Selke Trophy in 1994 – 95 . 
 = = = Philadelphia Flyers = = = 
 Otto hoped to remain in Calgary after his contract expired following the 1995 season , but with the Flames facing financial difficulties as the NHL 's salary structure rapidly changed , the team was unable to agree to a new contract . He was among the most sought after players in free agency , and was pursued by the New York Rangers , who hoped that he could help their team shut down Eric Lindros of the Philadelphia Flyers . Otto considered the offer , and thought if the Rangers thought that highly of their opponent , he would be better off playing with Lindros than against him . Otto signed a three @-@ year contract with the Philadelphia Flyers on July 21 , 1995 . 
 He scored 41 points in 67 games in 1995 – 96 , including the 500th of his career , when he notched a goal and an assist in a 5 – 4 win over the Edmonton Oilers on March 13 , 1997 . Still regarded as one of the league 's top defensive centers in 1996 – 97 , Otto helped the Flyers reach the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals , which they lost to the Detroit Red Wings . He scored only 7 points in 68 games in 1997 – 98 after recording 32 the season before , and had lost some of his skating speed . Following the season , Otto announced his retirement .

 Otto made his debut with the United States national team at the 1985 World Ice Hockey Championships . He appeared in ten games , scoring two goals .

The Americans ultimately finished fourth in the tournament . Otto played in a second World Championship in 1990 , scoring six points in nine games for the fifth @-@ place Americans . 
 The 1987 Canada Cup was Otto 's first appearance in a best @-@ on @-@ best tournament .

 The Doctor ( Matt Smith ) and Rory ( Arthur Darvill ) have discovered Amy ( Karen Gillan ) , Rory 's wife and the Doctor 's companion , has been abducted from them and her place taken by an avatar made from " the Flesh " , a semi @-@ sentient being which can create near perfect replicas of other individuals , and are able to change their molecular structure to suit their surroundings or needs ( " The Almost People " ) , through which Amy has been experiencing events as if she were physically present . The Doctor has come to learn the real Amy is being held on a secret asteroid base called " Demon 's Run " , and collects several old debtors from across time and space to lay assault on the base , including Sontaran Commander Strax ( Dan Starkey ) , Silurian Madame Vastra ( Neve McIntosh ) and her human wife Jenny Flint ( Catrin Stewart ) , and the black market trader Dorium <unk> ( Simon Fisher @-@ Becker ) . Rory , after collecting information on the base 's location from a Cyberman fleet , attempts to recruit River Song ( Alex Kingston ) from her Stormcage prison cell , but she refuses , saying she cannot be with the Doctor at this time as this battle is when he will discover her identity . Aboard the base , Madame Kovarian ( Frances Barber ) , who has been watching over Amy during her pregnancy and has taken her child , Melody , from her , prepares her human troops to fight the Doctor alongside the Order of the Headless Monks who reside at Demon 's Run ; the monks are literally headless and incapable of being fooled or intimidated . Human soldier Lorna Bucket ( Christina Chong ) , who met the Doctor as a young girl in the Gamma forests , attempts to befriend Amy , giving her a good luck token made of cloth sewn with Melody 's name on it in the language of the Gamma forests . Amy warns Bucket of the Doctor 's fury if she fights against him . 
 Assisted by additional Silurian and Judoon forces , the Doctor and his allies launch a surprise attack and secure the base . The Doctor and Rory free Amy and retake Melody before Madame Kovarian can escape with her . As the Doctor celebrates , considering this his greatest achievement , Vastra and Dorium discover Kovarian has been scanning Melody and has found the child has both human and Time Lord DNA . The Doctor surmises Melody was likely conceived on Amy and Rory 's wedding night aboard the TARDIS ( " The Big Bang " ) , the baby 's DNA influenced by the time vortex . The rest of the Doctor 's allies regroup , and Amy and Rory tend to their daughter using an ancient wooden baby cot the Doctor claims was his own . Meanwhile , Bucket has arrived and warns the group of Kovarian 's trap , but they are too late , as the TARDIS is blocked by a forcefield . They are attacked by the Headless Monks , and several Silurians are killed immediately . Dorium is beheaded , while Strax and Bucket are fatally wounded in the battle . Meanwhile , Kovarian , well away from the base , contacts the Doctor , explaining they will be using Melody as a weapon in the war against him . She takes delight in telling him he has fallen into another trap , and " fooling [ the Doctor ] once was a joy , twice in the same way is a privilege " . The Doctor races to the hangar to warn his friends , unaware he is too late . At the same time , Kovarian appears to Melody in a hatch in midair , as she had to Amy 's Flesh duplicate , and tells the baby to wake up . The baby dissolves into the Flesh liquid , leaving Amy horrified and in shock . 
 The Doctor arrives too late to help his wounded allies , and so he and Rory console Amy . Lorna Bucket dies , remembering her childhood adventure with the Doctor . River appears , and the Doctor berates her for not helping . She tries to explain she could not have interfered in these events , and tells the Doctor what transpired was partially his fault , having been brought about by those who feared his reputation . The Doctor becomes angry and demands to know who she is . River shows the Doctor the cot , and The Doctor recognises River 's identity . <unk> , he goes off on his own in the TARDIS to rescue Melody , asking River to return everyone to their proper time period . Amy , holding a gun at her , demands River explain what she said to the Doctor , and so River shows Amy and Rory the cot . Initially Amy believes River is referring to the Gallifreyan symbols engraved on it , but they cannot be read by humans even with the aid of the TARDIS translation system . Instead , River shows them Bucket 's cloth prayer leaf with Melody 's name , still in the cot . Amy tells River she knows her daughter 's name ; River tells her the people of the Gamma Forest do not have a word for " Pond " , as the only water in the forest is the river .

 " A Good Man Goes to War " is the seventh episode of series six and also the <unk> episode of Doctor Who , but there are no seven puns as the production team did not realise this until after shooting . The episode 's idea stemmed from lead writer and executive producer Steven Moffat wondering if the Doctor , who was typically a pacifist , could be provoked enough to assemble an army . The Headless Monks were first mentioned in " The Time of Angels " , added to that episode 's script to help explain the monastic look of the Delirium Archive the Doctor and Amy were visiting . Similar troops also known as " Clerics " appeared in " The Time of Angels " / " Flesh and Stone " ; Moffat stated it seemed many armies in the future in Doctor Who were of religious origin . The possibility of the English word " doctor " originating from the Doctor was a notion made by Moffat on Usenet in 1995 . 
 Moffat had planned the revelation about River Song " for a long time " ; when creating Amy , he chose " Pond " for her last name to create a link . Moffat intended for the " answer to be as complicated as the question " . Moffat informed Kingston of the secrets of her character at the end of the previous series and she was not allowed to tell anyone ; Smith , Gillan , and Darvill were unaware of the identity of her character . River 's identity was kept in top secrecy ; the script read at the read @-@ through had a false ending , and only a select few were issued the real script . 
 The episode sees the return of several minor characters . Dorium previously appeared in " The Pandorica Opens " , while Henry and Toby Avery from " The Curse of the Black Spot " and the Spitfire pilot Danny Boy from " Victory of the Daleks " make cameos . Moffat said he planned writing in a cameo for John Barrowman to reprise his role as Jack Harkness , but Barrowman was busy filming Torchwood : Miracle Day and was unavailable . Originally the episode contained a scene with Ood Sigma , previously seen in " Planet of the Ood " , " The Waters of Mars " , and The End of Time , but it was cut from the final episode . Russell T Davies is still listed in the credits for creating the Ood .

 " A Good Man Goes to War " began shooting in mid @-@ January 2011 . The various sets seen at the beginning of the episode were challenging for the production team . A Cardiff alleyway was dressed to look like a Victorian street for a brief introduction scene with Vastra , while a hotel bar in Cardiff was used for Dorium 's nightclub . Demon 's Run was filmed in a military base and hangar in Cardiff . Steam was added to the set to give it a more spaceship @-@ like feel . The army of clerics was made larger with visual effects . The set used for the chamber Amy was kept in was the same used as the Oval Office in " The Impossible Astronaut " / " Day of the Moon " . Baby Melody Pond was played by twins , a common practice used in filming so that one twin can rest while the other is on set . The twins were three months old . Gillan and Darvill were both nervous about holding the infants , but they felt it added to their acting . Gillan stated the episode showed a different side of Amy and thought female viewers would sympathize with her . 
 The Headless Monks were played by stuntmen , and so the actors were free to improvise on their choreography when fighting them . For the scene in which the hoods of the Headless Monks are pulled back , a <unk> was created for actors who were shorter than the ones who normally portrayed the monks . Dan Starkey , who plays the Sontaran Commander Strax , previously appeared as Sontarans in " The Sontaran Stratagem " / " The Poison Sky " ( 2008 ) and The End of Time ( 2010 ) . Neve McIntosh , who played the Silurian Warrior Vastra , previously played the sisters Alaya and Restac in " The Hungry Earth " / " Cold Blood " ( 2010 ) . Both Starkey and McIntosh underwent extensive make @-@ up and prosthetics for their characters .

 " A Good Man Goes to War " has received mixed to positive reviews . IGN 's Matt Risley rated the episode 9 out of 10 , describing it as an " epic " mid @-@ series finale which " opened with a grandstanding , wonderfully <unk> pre @-@ credits tease and didn 't really let up from there " . He praised the spectacle and character development , but felt it led to a certain amount of " the odd rushed scene ... forgettable supporting [ characters ] , and little opportunity to develop the Headless Monks into anything particularly imposing " . Dave Golder of SFX gave " A Good Man Goes to War " four and a half out of five stars , feeling it " saved " the sixth series and offered " a satisfying slice of fantasy television which ticked lots of boxes : it featured dashing , daring storytelling which was bold and confident ; it looked fantastic , there were some hilarious lines and the performance of the star upped his wattage a couple of notches once again " . However , he was more critical of the Headless Monks and the direction of the battle at the end . Neela Debnath of The Independent was also favourable , praising the use of the cliffhanger and felt the complicated nature of the episode " draws people more into the show and gets them thinking about it " . 
 Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph said the episode was good but lacked significant background motivation into the villains . Fuller also noted the revelation of River Song being Amy 's grown up child " is perhaps a narrative strand which would sit uncomfortably with a series where loss has often been brushed off as soon as the next couple of episodes " . However , he did have praise for the performance of Smith 's Doctor , commenting " the last few weeks have seen Matt Smith 's Doctor in a welcome generally more serious vein , which he kept up here , with leavening at the right moments where his alien lack of comfort with human emotions , although used to comic effect , rang very true , as did his awkwardness when discovering the truth about River " . 
 Dan Martin of The Guardian was less favourable , stating the producers " promised us a cliffhanger , and now we 're left the whole summer long to contemplate whether our favourite show can really have just dropped the ball . Oh there was plenty to love about this mid @-@ season finale , and even more to pick over . But as an hour of drama it was all over the place " . Because the episode was so fast @-@ paced with little being explained , he did not feel any emotional connection to the Anglican marines or Lorna Bucket . Unlike Fuller , Martin was not favourable to Smith 's Doctor , stating " the non @-@ event of the battle means the Doctor never really gets to show this dark side we 've been hearing so much about " and that Smith 's predecessor , David Tennant , " got angrier most weeks " . Martin did have praise for the final reveal of the episode , stating that although it had been " hidden in plain view from the very beginning as soon as it 's revealed Amy has called the baby Melody " , he was unable to make the connection and was suitably surprised . Martin later rated it the second @-@ to @-@ worst episode of the series , though the finale was not included in the list . 
 The episode was nominated for the 2012 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation ( Short Form ) , though it lost to Neil Gaiman 's episode " The Doctor 's Wife " . 
 Two of the new characters introduced in the episode , a 19th @-@ century crimefighter Silurian named Madame Vastra and her assistant Jenny have proven quite popular among fans , with numerous forums and SFX calling for the BBC to commission a spin @-@ off series . Steven Moffat stated in an interview that he did not have time to work on a spin @-@ off but was open to the possibility of the characters returning . Vastra and Jenny , as well as a revived Strax , were made a recurring part of the seventh series . 
 = Northern mockingbird = 
 The northern mockingbird ( Mimus polyglottos ) is the only mockingbird commonly found in North America . This bird is mainly a permanent resident , but northern birds may move south during harsh weather . This species has rarely been observed in Europe . This species was first described by Linnaeus in his Systema Naturæ in 1758 as Turdus polyglottos . The northern mockingbird is renowned for its mimicking ability , as reflected by the meaning of its scientific name , ' many @-@ tongued mimic . ' The northern mockingbird has gray to brown upper feathers and a paler belly . Its tail and wings have white patches which are visible in flight . 
 The northern mockingbird is an omnivore . It eats both insects and fruits . It is often found in open areas and forest edges but forages in grassy land . The northern mockingbird breeds in southeastern Canada , the United States , northern Mexico , the Bahamas , the Cayman Islands and the Greater Antilles . It is replaced further south by its closest living relative , the tropical mockingbird . The Socorro mockingbird , an endangered species , is also closely related , contrary to previous opinion . The northern mockingbird is listed as of Least Concern according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) . 
 The northern mockingbird is known for its intelligence and has also been noted in North American culture . A 2009 study showed that the bird was able to recognize individual humans , particularly noting those who had previously been intruders or threats . Also birds recognize their breeding spots and return to areas in which they had greatest success in previous years . Urban birds are more likely to demonstrate this behavior . Finally , the mockingbird has influenced United States culture in multiple ways . The bird is a state bird of five different states , has been used in book titles , and has also been used in popular songs and lullabies among other appearances in U.S. culture . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus first described this species in his Systema Naturae in 1758 as Turdus polyglottos . Its current Latin name , Mimus polyglottos , means “ many @-@ tongued mimic ” , representing its outstanding ability to mimic various sounds . The northern mockingbird is considered to be conspecific with the tropical mockingbird ( Mimus gilvus ) . This species is categorized as the northern mockingbird as the closest living relative to M. gilvus . 
 = = = Subspecies = = = 
 There are three recognized subspecies for the northern mockingbird . There have been proposed races from the Bahamas and Haiti placed under the orpheus section . 
 M. p. polyglottos ( Linnaeus , 1758 ) : generally found in the eastern portion of North America ranging from Nova Scotia to Nebraska , to as far south as Texas and Florida . 
 M. p. leucopterus ' Western Mockingbird ' ( Vigors , 1839 ) : generally found in the western portion of North America ranging from NW Nebraska and Western Texas to the Pacific Coast , and south to Mexico ( the Isthmus of Tehuantepec ) , and Socorro Island . Larger than M. p. polyglottos and has a slightly shorter tail , upperparts are more buff and paler , underparts have a stronger buff pigment . 
 M. p. orpheus ( Linnaeus , 1758 ) from the Bahamas to the Greater Antilles , also the Cayman and Virgin Islands . Similar to M. m. polyglottos except smaller , a paler shade of gray on its back , and underparts with practically little , if any buff at all . 
 = = Description = = 
 The northern mockingbird is a medium @-@ sized mimid that has long legs and tail . Males and females look alike . Its upper parts are colored gray , while its underparts have a white or whitish @-@ gray color . It has parallel wing bars on the half of the wings connected near the white patch giving it a distinctive appearance in flight . The black central rectrices and typical white lateral rectrices are also noticeable in flight . The iris is usually a light green @-@ yellow or a yellow , but there have been instances of an orange color . The bill is black with a brownish black appearance at the base . The juvenile appearance is marked by its streaks on its back , distinguished spots and streaks on its chest , and a gray or grayish @-@ green iris . 
 Northern mockingbirds measure from 20 @.@ 5 to 28 cm ( 8 @.@ 1 to 11 @.@ 0 in ) including a tail almost as long as its body . The wingspan can range from 31 – 38 cm ( 12 – 15 in ) and body mass is from 40 – 58 g ( 1 @.@ 4 – 2 @.@ 0 oz ) . Males tend to be slightly larger than females . Among standard measurements , the wing chord is 10 to 12 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 to 4 @.@ 7 in ) , the tail is 10 to 13 @.@ 4 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 to 5 @.@ 3 in ) , the culmen is 1 @.@ 6 to 1 @.@ 9 cm ( 0 @.@ 63 to 0 @.@ 75 in ) and the tarsus is 2 @.@ 9 to 3 @.@ 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 1 to 1 @.@ 3 in ) . 
 The northern mockingbird 's lifespan is observed to be up to 8 years , but captive birds can live up to 20 years . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The mockingbird 's breeding range is from Maritime provinces of Canada westwards to British Columbia , practically the entire Continental United States south of the northern Plains states and Pacific northwest , and the majority of Mexico to eastern Oaxaca and Veracruz . The mockingbird is generally a year @-@ round resident of its range , but the birds that live in the northern portion of its range have been noted further south during the winter season . Sightings of the mockingbird have also been recorded in Hawaii ( where it was introduced in the 1920s ) , southeastern Alaska , and twice as transatlantic vagrants in Britain . The mockingbird is thought to be at least partly migratory in the northern portions of its range , but the migratory behavior is not well understood . 
 In the nineteenth century , the range of the mockingbird expanded northward towards provinces such as Nova Scotia and Ontario and states such as Massachusetts , although the sightings were sporadic . Within the first five decades of the twentieth century , regions that received an influx of mockingbirds were Maine , Vermont , Ohio , Iowa , and New York . In western states such as California , the population was restricted to the lower Sonoran regions but by the 1970s the mockingbirds was residential in most counties . Islands that saw introductions of the mockingbird include Bermuda ( in which it failed ) , Barbados , St. Helena , Socorro Island , the Cayman Islands and Tahiti . 
 The mockingbird 's habitat varies by location , but it prefers open areas with sparse vegetation . In the eastern regions , suburban and urban areas such as parks , gardens are frequent residential areas . It has an affinity for mowed lawns with shrubs within proximity for shade and nesting . In western regions , desert scrub , chaparral are among its preferred habitats When foraging for food , it prefers short grass . It also has an affinity for mowed lawns . This bird does not nest in densely forested areas , and generally resides in the same habitats year round . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 The northern mockingbird is an omnivore . The birds ' diet consists of arthropods , earthworms , berries , fruits , seeds , and seldom , lizards . Mockingbirds can drink from puddles , river and lake edges , or dew and rain droplets that amass onto plants . Adult mockingbirds also have been seen drinking sap from the cuts on recently pruned trees . Its diet heavily consists of animal prey during the breeding season , but takes a drastic shift to fruits during the fall and winter . The drive for fruits amid winter has been noted for the geographic expansion of the mockingbird , and in particular , the fruit of Rosa multiflora , a favorite of the birds , is a possible link . Mockingbirds also eat garden fruits such as tomatoes , apples , and berries . 
 These birds forage on the ground or in vegetation ; they also fly down from a perch to capture food . While foraging , they frequently spread their wings in a peculiar two @-@ step motion to display the white patches . There is disagreement among ornithologists over the purpose of this behavior , with hypotheses ranging from deceleration to intimidation of predators or prey . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 Both the male and female of the species reach sexual maturity after 1 year of life . The breeding season occurs in the spring and early summer . The males arrive before the beginning of the season to establish their territories . The males use a series of courtship displays to attract the females to their sites . They run around the area either to showcase their territory to the females or to pursue the females . The males also engage in flight to showcase their wings . They sing and call as they perform all of these displays . The species can remain monogamous for many years , but incidents of polygyny and bigamy have been reported to occur during the bird 's lifetime . 
 The northern mockingbird pairs hatch about 2 to 4 broods a year . In one breeding season , the northern mockingbird lays an average of 4 eggs . They hatch after about 11 to 14 days of incubation . After about 10 to 15 days of life , the offspring become independent . 
 Both the male and female are involved in the nest building . The male does most of the work , while the female perches on the shrub or tree where the nest is being built to watch for predators . The nest is built approximately three to ten feet above the ground . The outer part of the nest is composed of twigs , while the inner part is lined with grasses , dead leaves , moss , or artificial fibers . The eggs are a light blue or greenish color and speckled with dots . The female lays three to five eggs , and she incubates them for nearly two weeks . Once the eggs are hatched , both the male and female will feed the chicks . 
 The birds aggressively defend their nests and surrounding areas against other birds and animals . When a predator is persistent , mockingbirds that are summoned by distinct calls from neighboring territories may join the attack . Other birds may gather to watch as the mockingbirds harass the intruder . In addition to harassing domestic cats and dogs they consider a threat , it is not unheard of for mockingbirds to target humans . The birds are absolutely unafraid and will attack much larger birds , even hawks . One famous incident in Tulsa , Oklahoma involving a postal carrier resulted in the distribution of a warning letter to residents . 
 = = = Sexual selection = = = 
 Northern mockingbirds are famous for their song repertoires . Studies have shown that males sing songs at the beginning of breeding season to attract females . Unmated males sing songs in more directions and sing more bouts than mated males . In addition , unmated males perform more flight displays than mated males . The mockingbirds usually nest several times during one breeding season . Depending on the stage of breeding and the mating status , a male mockingbird will vary his song production . The unmated male keeps close track of this change . He sings in one direction when he perceives a chance to lure a female from the nest of the mated male . Unmated males are also more likely to use elevated perches to extend his songs to a further range . Though the mockingbirds are socially monogamous , mated males have been known to sing to attract additional mates . 
 An observational study by Logan demonstrates that the female is continuously evaluating the quality of the male and his territory . The assessment is usually triggered by the arrival of a new male in a neighboring territory at the beginning of a new breeding season . In those cases , the mated female is constantly seen flying over both the original and the new male ’ s territory , evaluating the qualities of both territories and exchanging calls with both males . The social mate displays aggressive behaviors towards the female , while the new male shows less aggression and sings softer songs . At the same time , both the mated male and the new male will fly over other territories to attract other females as well . Divorce , mate switching and extra @-@ pair matings do occur in northern mockingbirds . 
 = = = Sex allocation = = = 
 Northern mockingbirds adjust the sex ratio of their offspring according to the food availability and population density . Male offspring usually require more parental investment . There is therefore a bias for bearing the costlier sex at the beginning of a breeding season when the food is abundant . Local resource competition predicts that the parents have to share the resources with offspring that remain at the natal site after maturation . In passerine birds , like the northern mockingbird , females are more likely to disperse than males . Hence , it is adaptive to produce more dispersive sex than philopatric sex when the population density is high and the competition for local resources is intense . Since northern mockingbirds are abundant in urban environments , it is possible that the pollution and contamination in cities might affect sexual hormones and therefore play a role in offspring sex ratio . 
 = = = Mating = = = 
 Northern mockingbirds are socially monogamous . The two sexes look alike except that males are a little larger in size than females . Mutual mate choice is exhibited in northern mockingbirds . Both males and females prefer mates that are more aggressive towards intruders , and so exhibit greater parental investment . However , males are more defensive of their nests than females . In a population where male breeding adults outnumber female breeding adults , females have more freedom in choosing their mates . In these cases , these female breeders have the option of changing mates within a breeding season if the first male does not provide a high level of parental care , which includes feeding and nest defense . High nesting success is associated with highly aggressive males attacking intruders in the territory , and so these males are preferred by females . 
 = = = Parental care = = = 
 Northern mockingbirds are altricial , meaning that , when hatched , they are born relatively immobile and defenseless and therefore require nourishment for a certain duration from their parents . The young have a survival bottleneck at the nestling stage because there are higher levels of nestling predation than egg predation . The levels of belligerence exhibited by parents therefore increase once eggs hatch but there is no increase during the egg stage . 
 A recent study shows that both food availability and temperature affect the parental incubation of the eggs in northern mockingbirds . Increasing food availability provides the females with more time to care for the nest and perform self @-@ maintenance . Increasing temperature , however , reduces the time the females spend at the nest and there is increased energy cost to cool the eggs . The incubation behavior is a trade @-@ off among various environmental factors . 
 Mockingbird nests are also often parasitized by cowbirds . The parents are found to reject parasitic eggs at an intermediate rate . A recent study has shown that foreign eggs are more likely to be rejected from a nest later in the breeding season than from earlier in a breeding season . Early nesting hosts may not have learned the pattern and coloration of their first clutch yet , so are less likely to reject foreign eggs . There is also a seasonal threshold in terms of the overlap between the breeding seasons of the northern mockingbirds and their parasites . If the breeding season of the parasites starts later , there is less likelihood of parasitism . Hence , it pays the hosts to have relatively lower sensitivity to parasitic eggs . 
 = = = Song and calls = = = 
 Although many species of bird imitate the vocalizations of other birds , the northern mockingbird is the best known in North America for doing so . Among the species and vocalizations imitated are Carolina wren , northern cardinal , tufted titmouse , eastern <unk> , house sparrow , wood thrush and eastern bluebird songs , calls of the northern flicker and great crested flycatcher , jeers and <unk> of the blue jay , and alarm , chups , and <unk> of the American robin . It imitates not only birds , but also other animals such as cats , dogs , frogs , crickets and sounds from artificial items such as <unk> wheels and even car alarms . As convincing as these imitations may be to humans , they often fail to fool other birds , such as the Florida scrub @-@ jay . 
 The northern mockingbird 's mimicry is likely to serve as a form of sexual selection through which competition between males and female choice influence a bird 's song repertoire size . A 2013 study attempted to determine model selection in vocal mimics , and the data suggested that mimicry in the mockingbird resulted from the bird being genetically predisposed to learning vocalizations with acoustic characteristics such as an enlarged auditory template . 
 Both male and female mockingbirds sing , with the latter being generally quieter and less vocal . Male commencement of singing is in late January to February and continue into the summer and the establishing of territory into the fall . Frequency in female singing is more sporadic , as it sings less often in the summer and fall , and only sings when the male is away from the territory . The mockingbird also possesses a large song repertoire that ranges from 43 to 203 song types and the size varies by region . Repertoire sizes ranged from 14 to 150 types in Texas , and two studies of mockingbirds in Florida rounded estimates to 134 and 200 , approximately . It continually expands its repertoire during its life , though it pales in comparison to mimids such as the brown thrasher . 
 There are four recognized calls for the mockingbird : the nest relief call , hew call , chat or <unk> , and the begging call . The hew call is mainly used by both sexes for potential nest predators , conspecific chasing , and various interactions between mates . The differences between chats and chatbursts are frequency of use , as chats are year @-@ round , and chatbursts occur in the fall . Another difference is that chatbursts appear to be used in territorial defense in the fall , and the chats are used by either sex when disturbed . The nest relief and begging calls are only used by the males .

 A laboratory observation of 38 mockingbird nestlings and fledglings ( thirty @-@ five and three , respectively ) recorded the behavioral development of young mockingbirds . Notable milestones included the eyes opening , soft vocalizations , begging , and preening began within the first six days of life . Variation in begging and more compact movements such as perching , fear crouching , and stretching appeared by the ninth day . Wing @-@ flashing , bathing , flight , and leaving the nest happened within seventeen days ( nest leaving occurred within 11 to 13 days ) . Improvements of flight , walking , self @-@ feeding and walking took place within forty days . Agonistic behavior increased during the juvenile stages , to the extent of one of two siblings living in the same area was likely killed by the other .

 Adult mockingbirds can fall victim to birds of prey such as the great horned owl , screech owl and sharp @-@ shinned hawk , though their tenacious behavior leads them to being less likely to being captured .

Blowfly larvae and Haemoproteus have been found in Florida and Arizona populations , respectively . 
 Winter storms limit the expansion of mockingbirds in its range . The storms have played a role in the declining of the Ohio populations ( where it has since recovered ) , Michigan , Minnesota and likely in Quebec . Dry seasons also affects the mockingbird populations in Arizona .

 In a paper published in 2009 , researchers found that mockingbirds were able to recall an individual human who , earlier in the study , had approached and threatened the mockingbirds ' nest . Researchers had one participant stand near a mockingbird nest and touch it , while others avoided the nest . Later , the mockingbirds recognized the intruder and exhibited defensive behavior , while ignoring the other individuals . 
 = = = Adaptation to urban habitats = = = 
 The northern mockingbird is a species that is found in both urban and rural habitats . There are now more northern mockingbirds living in urban habitats than non @-@ urban environments , so they are consequently known as an urban @-@ positive species . Biologists have long questioned how northern mockingbirds adapt to a novel environment in cities , and whether they fall into the typical ecological traps that are common for urban @-@ dwelling birds . A comparative study between an urban dwelling population and a rural dwelling one shows that the apparent survival is higher for individuals in the urban habitats . Lower food availability and travel costs may account for the higher mortality rate in rural habitats . Urban birds are more likely to return to the nest where they had successfully bred the previous year and avoid those where breeding success was low . One explanation for this phenomenon is that urban environments are more predictable than non @-@ urban ones , as the site fidelity among urban birds prevents them from ecological traps . Mockingbirds are also able to utilize artificial lighting in order to feed nestlings in urban areas such as residential neighborhoods into the night in contrast to those that do not nest near those areas . The adaptation of mockingbirds in urban habitats have led it to become more susceptible to lead poisoning in its population in the Baltimore and Washington , D.C. population .

 It also features in the title and central metaphor of the novel To Kill a Mockingbird , by Harper Lee . In that novel , mockingbirds are portrayed as innocent and generous , and two of the major characters , Atticus Finch and Miss Maudie , say it is a sin to kill a mockingbird because " they don 't do one thing for us but make music for us to enjoy . They don 't eat up people 's gardens , don 't nest in <unk> , they don 't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us " .

So the one great thing about being famous is that I get to meet people who I respect . Our relationship is akin to a dog and its master . I 'll always look up to him . " The band felt the track resembled R.E.M. ' s 1991 single , " Losing My Religion " .

In the Entertainment Weekly review of the album , music contributor David Browne wrote that the song " is imbued with the sense of regret and letting go that we 've heard from the band before , but with added musical muscle . " Michael Hubbard of MusicOMH wrote : " ' A Message ' and ' The Hardest Part ' sound like companion pieces , both big songs . " Critic Kelefa Sanneh of Rolling Stone noted that the song gets " less catchy as it goes along " . Adrien Begrand from PopMatters wrote that " The Hardest Part " is a " pleasant slice of R.E.M. style pop . " Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun reported that the song sounded " like the Smiths meets REM . " David <unk> of The Daily Telegraph noted , " ... ' The Hardest Part ' is lovely , straightforward , instantly accessible pop @-@ rock " .

 The music video for " The Hardest Part " was shot on 3 March 2006 in St. Petersburg , Florida . The video uses footage from the television series Attitudes , a series aired on the Lifetime television network , from 1985 – 1991 . The video is digitally enhanced to appear as though Coldplay is performing the music alongside the act appearing on stage . American actress Linda Dano , who played Felicia Gallant on the US soap opera Another World , is also featured . The dancers on the stage are 84 years old Barbara Moseley and 25 years old Gene Spencer whose performance was actually filmed in 1990 . The music video was directed by Mary Wigmore .

 = Thunderbirds ( TV series ) = 
 Thunderbirds is a British science @-@ fiction television series created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson , filmed by their production company AP Films ( APF ) and distributed by ITC Entertainment . It was produced between 1964 and 1966 using a form of electronic marionette puppetry ( dubbed " Supermarionation " ) combined with scale model special effects sequences . Two series were filmed , comprising a total of 32 episodes . Production ceased after Lew Grade , the Andersons ' financial backer , failed in his efforts to sell the programme to American network television . 
 Set in the mid @-@ 2060s , Thunderbirds is a follow @-@ up to the earlier Supermarionation productions Four Feather Falls , Supercar , Fireball XL5 and Stingray . It follows the exploits of International Rescue ( IR ) , a life @-@ saving organisation equipped with technologically @-@ advanced land , sea , air and space rescue craft ; these are headed by a fleet of five vehicles named the Thunderbirds and launched from IR 's secret base in the Pacific Ocean . The main characters are ex @-@ astronaut Jeff Tracy , the founder of IR , and his five adult sons , who pilot the Thunderbird machines . 
 Thunderbirds began its first run in the United Kingdom on the ITV network in 1965 and has since been broadcast in at least 66 other countries . Periodically repeated , it was adapted for radio in the early 1990s and has influenced many TV programmes and other media . As well as inspiring various merchandising campaigns , the series has been followed by two feature @-@ length film sequels , a live @-@ action film adaptation and a mimed stage show tribute . The second of two TV remakes , the computer @-@ animated Thunderbirds Are Go , premiered in 2015 . 
 Widely considered to be the Andersons ' most popular and commercially successful series , Thunderbirds has received particular praise for its effects ( directed by Derek Meddings ) and musical score ( composed by Barry Gray ) . It is also well remembered for its title sequence , which opens with an often @-@ quoted countdown by actor Peter Dyneley ( who voiced the character of Jeff ) : " 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 : Thunderbirds Are Go ! " A real @-@ life rescue service , the International Rescue Corps , is named after the organisation featured in the series . 
 = = Storyline = = 
 Set between 2065 and 2067 , Thunderbirds follows the exploits of the Tracy family , headed by American ex @-@ astronaut turned multi @-@ millionaire philanthropist Jeff Tracy . He is a widower with five adult sons : Scott , John , Virgil , Gordon and Alan . The Tracys form International Rescue ( IR ) , a secret organisation dedicated to saving human life . They are aided in this mission by technologically advanced land , sea , air and space vehicles , which are called into service when conventional rescue techniques prove ineffective . The most important of these are five machines named the " Thunderbirds " , each assigned to one of the five Tracy brothers : 
 Thunderbird 1 : a hypersonic rocket plane used for fast response and accident zone reconnaissance . Piloted by primary rescue co @-@ ordinator Scott Tracy . 
 Thunderbird 2 : a supersonic carrier aircraft that transports rescue vehicles and equipment to accident zones in detachable capsules known as " Pods " . Piloted by Virgil . 
 Thunderbird 3 : a single @-@ stage @-@ to @-@ orbit spacecraft . Piloted alternately by Alan and John , with Scott as co @-@ pilot . 
 Thunderbird 4 : a utility submersible . Piloted by Gordon and normally launched from Thunderbird 2 . 
 Thunderbird 5 : a space station that relays distress calls from around the world . Manned alternately by " Space Monitors " John and Alan . 
 With the engineer Brains and Jeff 's elderly mother , as well as the Malaysian manservant Kyrano and his daughter Tin @-@ Tin , the family reside in a luxurious villa on Tracy Island , their hidden base in the South Pacific Ocean . In this location , IR is safe from criminals and spies who envy the organisation 's technology and seek to acquire the secrets of its machines . 
 Despite its humanitarian principles , some of IR 's operations are necessitated not by misadventure but deliberate sabotage motivated by greed for power and wealth . For missions that require criminal investigation , the organisation incorporates a network of undercover agents headed by English aristocrat Lady Penelope Creighton @-@ Ward and her butler Aloysius Parker . Based at Creighton @-@ Ward Mansion in Kent , Penelope and Parker 's primary mode of transport is FAB 1 , a specially @-@ modified Rolls @-@ Royce . The most persistent of IR 's adversaries is the criminal known only as the " Hood " . Operating from a temple in the Malaysian jungle , and possessing abilities of hypnosis and dark magic , he exerts a powerful telepathic control over Kyrano , his estranged half @-@ brother , and manipulates the Tracys into missions that unfold according to his nefarious designs . This allows him to spy on the Thunderbird machines and , by selling their secrets , make himself rich . 
 = = Production = = 
 Thunderbirds was the fourth Supermarionation puppet TV series to be produced by APF , which was founded by the husband @-@ and @-@ wife duo of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson with their business partners Reg Hill and John Read . Pitched in late 1963 , the series was commissioned by Lew Grade of ITC , APF 's parent company , on the back of the positive audience response to Stingray . 
 Gerry Anderson drew inspiration for the series ' underlying concept from the West German mining disaster known as the Wunder von Lengede ( " Miracle of Lengede " ) . In October 1963 , the collapse of a nearby dam flooded an iron mine in the municipality of Lengede , killing 29 miners and trapping 21 others underground . Lacking the means to drill an escape shaft , the authorities were forced to requisition a heavy @-@ duty bore from Bremen ; the considerable time necessary to ship this device by rail had significantly reduced the chances of a successful rescue . Recognising the advantages of swifter crisis response , Anderson conceived the idea of an " international rescue " organisation that could use supersonic aircraft to transport specialised rescue equipment quickly over long distances . 
 Seeking to distinguish his 26 @-@ episode proposal from APF 's earlier productions , Anderson attempted to pitch stories at a level that would appeal to both adults and children . Whereas previous series had been shown during the late afternoon , Anderson wanted Thunderbirds to be broadcast in a family @-@ friendly primetime slot . Sylvia remembers that " our market had grown and a ' <unk> ' show ... was the next step . " The Andersons retired to their holiday villa in Portugal to expand the premise , script the pilot episode and compose a scriptwriters ' guide . According to Sylvia , the writing process depended on a " division of labour " , whereby Gerry created the action sequences while she managed characterisation . The decision to make a father and his sons the main characters was influenced by the premise of Bonanza , as well as Sylvia 's belief that the use of more than one heroic character would broaden the series ' appeal . The Tracy brothers were named after Mercury Seven astronauts : Scott Carpenter , John Glenn , Virgil " Gus " Grissom , Gordon Cooper and Alan Shepard . 
 The series ' title was derived from a letter written by Gerry 's brother , Lionel , while he had been serving overseas as an RAF flight sergeant during World War II . While stationed in Arizona , Lionel had made reference to Thunderbird Field , a nearby United States Army Air Forces base . Drawn to the " <unk> " of " Thunderbirds " , Anderson dropped his working title of " International Rescue " and renamed both the series and IR 's rescue vehicles , which had previously been designated Rescues 1 to 5 . His inspiration for the launch sequences of Thunderbirds 1 , 2 and 3 originated from contemporary United States Air Force launch procedure : Anderson had learnt how the Strategic Air Command would keep its pilots on permanent standby , seated in the cockpits of their aircraft and ready for take @-@ off at a moment 's notice . 
 In the DVD documentary The Thunderbirds Companion , Anderson explained how a rise in filming costs had made overseas distribution revenue even more important and essentially caused Thunderbirds to be made " as an American show " . During the character development and voice casting process , the Andersons ' main priority was to ensure that the series had transatlantic appeal , thus increasing the chances of winning an American network deal and the higher audience figures that this market had to offer . Scripts were typed in American English and printed on US @-@ style quarto @-@ size paper . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Thunderbirds was filmed at APF 's studios on the Slough Trading Estate between 1964 and 1966 . In preparation , the number of full @-@ time crew was expanded to 100 . Shooting began in September 1964 after five months of pre @-@ production . Due to the new series ' technical complexity , this was a period longer than for any of APF 's earlier productions . To speed up the filming , episodes were shot in pairs , at a rate of one per month , on separate soundstages and by separate crews ( designated " A " and " B " ) . By 1964 , APF was the UK 's largest commercial user of colour film , consuming more than three million feet ( 570 miles or 910 kilometres ) of stock per year . 
 Alan Pattillo , a veteran scriptwriter and director for APF , was appointed the company 's first official script editor in late 1964 . This move was aimed to reduce the burden on Gerry Anderson who , while reserving his producer 's right to overall creative control , had grown weary of revising scripts himself . Direction of episodes was assigned in pairs : Pattillo and David Elliott alternated with the less experienced Desmond Saunders and newcomer David Lane for each month 's filming . Due to the difficulties of setting up takes , progress was slow : even on a productive day , it was rare for the crew to complete more than two minutes of puppet footage In a contemporary interview , Hill noted that Thunderbirds contained several times as many shots as a typical live @-@ action series . He explained that rapid editing was necessary on account of the characters ' lack of facial expression , which made it difficult to sustain the viewer 's interest for more than a few seconds per shot . 
 After viewing the completed 25 @-@ minute pilot , " Trapped in the Sky " , Lew Grade was so impressed by APF 's work that he instructed Anderson to double the episode length and increased the series ' budget per episode from £ 25 @,@ 000 to £ 38 @,@ 000 . As a result , Thunderbirds became not only the company 's longest and highest @-@ budgeted production , but also among the most expensive TV series to have been made up to that point . The crew , who had been filming at a rate of two 25 @-@ minute episodes per fortnight , faced significant challenges during the transition to the new format : eight episodes had already been completed , scripts for up to ten more had been written , and substantial rewrites would be necessary to satisfy the longer running time . Anderson lamented : " Our time @-@ scale was far too drawn out . ITC 's New York office insisted that they should have one show a fortnight ... Everything had to move at twice the speed . " APF spent over seven months extending the existing episodes . 
 Tony Barwick , who had impressed Pattillo and the Andersons with an unsubmitted script that he had written for Danger Man , was recruited to assist in the writing of subplots and filler material . He found that the longer format created opportunities to strengthen the characterisation . Science @-@ fiction writer John Peel suggests that " small character touches " make the puppet cast of Thunderbirds " much more rounded " than those of earlier APF series . He compares the writing favourably to that of live @-@ action drama . The new footage proved useful during the development of the first series finale , " Security Hazard " : since the previous two episodes had overspent their budgets , Pattillo devised a flashback @-@ dominated clip show containing only 17 minutes of new material to reduce costs . 
 Filming of Series One was completed in December 1965 . A second series was also commissioned late that year and entered production in March 1966 . Barwick became a full @-@ time member of the writing staff and took over the role of script editor from the outgoing Pattillo . The main puppet cast and vehicles were rebuilt ; in addition , the art department expanded some of the standing sets , including the Tracy Villa lounge and the Thunderbird 5 control room . To accommodate the simultaneous filming of the TV series and Thunderbirds Are Go , APF purchased two more buildings on the Slough Trading Estate and converted them into new stages . As crew and studio space were divided between the two productions , filming of the TV series progressed at half the previous speed , as APF 's B crew produced one episode per month . Filming on Thunderbirds Are Go was completed by June , allowing A crew to resume work on the series to shoot what would prove to be its penultimate episode , " Ricochet " . 
 Production of Thunderbirds ended in August 1966 with the completion of the sixth episode of Series Two . In February that year , it had been reported that Grade had been unable to sell the series in the United States due to disagreements over timeslots . In July , he cancelled Thunderbirds after failing in his second attempt to secure an American buyer . The three major US networks of the time – NBC , CBS and ABC – had all bid for the series , with Grade repeatedly increasing the price . When NBC withdrew its offer , the other two immediately followed . 
 By the time of its cancellation , Thunderbirds had become widely popular in the UK and was being distributed extensively overseas . Grade , however , believed that without the financial boost of an American network sale , a full second series would fail to recover its production costs . He therefore asked Anderson to devise a new concept that he hoped would stand a greater chance of winning over the profitable US market . This became Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons . 
 = = = Casting and characters = = = 
 Voice @-@ recording sessions were supervised by Pattillo and the Andersons , with Sylvia Anderson in charge of casting . Dialogue was recorded once per month at a rate of two scripts per session . Supporting parts were not pre @-@ assigned , but negotiated by the cast among themselves . Two recordings would be made at each session : one to be converted into electronic pulses for the puppet filming , the other to be added to the soundtrack during post @-@ production . The tapes were edited at Gate Recording Theatre in Birmingham . 
 In the interest of transatlantic appeal , it was decided that the main characters would be mostly American and therefore actors capable of producing an appropriate accent were used . British , Canadian and Australian actors formed most of the voice cast ; the only American involved was stage actor David Holliday , who was noticed in London 's West End and given the part of Virgil Tracy . Following the completion of the first series , Holliday returned to the US . The character was voiced by English @-@ Canadian actor Jeremy Wilkin for Series Two . 
 British actor David Graham was among the first to be cast . He had previously voiced characters in Four Feather Falls , Supercar , Fireball XL5 and Stingray . Beyond the APF productions , he had supplied one of the original Dalek voices on Doctor Who . Cast alongside Graham was Australian actor Ray Barrett . Like Graham , he had worked for the Andersons before , having voiced Titan and Commander Shore in Stingray . A veteran of radio drama , Barrett was skilled at performing a range of voices and accents in quick succession . Villains of the week would typically be voiced by either Barrett or Graham . Aware of the sensitive political climate of the Cold War and not wishing to " perpetuate the idea that Russia was the enemy with a whole generation of children watching " , Gerry Anderson decided the Hood ( voiced by Barrett ) should be Oriental and placed his temple hideout in Malaysia to defy the viewer 's expectations . 
 Although Lady Penelope and Parker ( the latter voiced by Graham ) were among the first characters developed , neither was conceived as a major role . Parker 's Cockney manner was based on a waiter at a pub in Cookham that was sometimes visited by the crew . On Gerry Anderson 's recommendation , Graham dined there regularly to study the accent . Anderson 's first choice for the role of Penelope had been Fenella Fielding , but Sylvia insisted she take the part herself . Her Penelope voice was intended to emulate Fielding and Joan Greenwood . On Penelope and Parker 's secondary role as comic relief , Gerry explained , " We British can laugh at ourselves , so therefore we had Penelope and Parker as this comedy team . And in America they love the British aristocracy too . ' " 
 As well as Jeff Tracy , English @-@ Canadian actor Peter Dyneley voiced the recurring character of Commander Norman , chief of air traffic control at London International Airport . His supporting character voices were typically those of upper @-@ class Englishmen . Shane Rimmer , the voice of Scott , was cast on the strength of his performance on the BBC soap opera Compact . Meanwhile , fellow Canadian Matt Zimmerman was selected at a late stage in the process . The expatriate West End actor was given the role of Alan on the recommendation of his friend , Holliday : " They were having great difficulty casting the part of Alan as they wanted a certain sound for him , being the youngest brother . David , who [ was ] a bit older than I am , told them that he had this friend , me , who would be great . " 
 Christine Finn , known for her role in the TV serial Quatermass and the Pit , provided the voices of Tin @-@ Tin Kyrano and Grandma Tracy . With Sylvia Anderson , she was also responsible for voicing most of the female and child supporting characters . Other minor parts were voiced by Charles Tingwell , Paul Maxwell and John Tate ( the father of Nick Tate ) , who were not credited for their contributions . 
 = = = Design and effects = = = 
 The puppet stages used for the filming of Thunderbirds were only one @-@ fifth the size of those used for a standard live @-@ action production , typically measuring 12 by 14 by 3 metres ( 39 @.@ 4 by 45 @.@ 9 by 9 @.@ 8 ft ) in length , width and height . Bob Bell , assisted by Keith Wilson and Grenville Nott , headed the art department for Series One . During the simultaneous filming of Series Two and Thunderbirds Are Go in 1966 , Bell attended mainly to the film , entrusting set design for the TV series to Wilson . 
 Since it was necessary for the art department 's interior sets to conform to the effects department 's exterior plans , each team closely monitored the other 's work . According to Sylvia Anderson , Bell 's challenge was to produce complex interiors on a limited budget while resisting the effects department 's push for " more extravagant " design . This task was complicated by the unnatural proportions of the puppets : Bell struggled to decide whether the sets should be built to a scale proportionate to their bodies or their oversized heads and hands . He used the example of FAB 1 to illustrate the problem : " As soon as we positioned [ the puppets ] standing alongside [ the model ] , they looked ridiculous , as the car towered over them . " He ultimately adopted a " mix @-@ and @-@ match " approach , in which smaller items , such as tableware , were scaled to their hands and furniture to their bodies . 
 While designing the Creighton @-@ Ward Mansion sets , Bell and his staff strove for authenticity , ordering miniature Tudor paintings , 1 ⁄ 3 @-@ scale <unk> and Regency @-@ style furniture and carpeting in the shape of a polar bear skin . This realism was enhanced by adding scrap items acquired from household waste and electronics shops . For example , a vacuum cleaner pipe serves as Virgil Tracy 's launch chute . 
 = = = = Puppets = = = = 
 The head puppet sculptor was Christine Glanville , who also served as the lead puppeteer . Glanville 's four @-@ person team built the 13 members of the main cast in six months at a cost of between £ 250 and £ 300 per puppet ( approximately £ 4 @,@ 569 and £ 5 @,@ 483 today ) . Since pairs of episodes were being filmed simultaneously on separate stages , the characters needed to be sculpted in duplicate . Facial expressions were diversified by means of replaceable heads : as well as a head with a neutral expression , each main character was given a " smiler " , a " <unk> " and a " blinker " . The finished puppets were approximately 22 inches ( 56 cm ) tall , or 1 ⁄ 3 adult human height . 
 The puppets were made up of more than 30 individual components , the most important of which was the solenoid that synchronised lip movements with the characters ' pre @-@ recorded dialogue . This device was positioned inside the head unit ; consequently , torsos and limbs appeared relatively small . The puppets ' likenesses and mechanics are remembered favourably by puppeteer Wanda Brown , who preferred the Thunderbirds marionettes over the accurately @-@ proportioned ones that first appeared in Captain Scarlet : " The puppets were easier to operate and more enjoyable because they had more character to them ... Even some of the more normal @-@ looking faces , such as Scott and Jeff , for me had more character than the puppets in the series that came afterwards . " Rimmer speaks positively of the puppets ' still being " very much caricatures " , since it made them " more lovable and appealing ... There was a naive quality about them and nothing too complex . " 
 The appearances of the main characters were inspired by those of actors and other entertainers , who were typically selected from the show business directory Spotlight . According to Glanville , as part of a trend away from the strong caricature of previous series , APF was seeking " more natural faces " for the puppets . The face of Jeff Tracy was based on that of Lorne Greene , Scott on Sean Connery , Alan on Robert Reed , John on Adam Faith and Charlton Heston , Brains on Anthony Perkins and Parker on Ben <unk> . Sylvia Anderson brought the character of Penelope to life in likeness as well as voice : after her test moulds were rejected , sculptor Mary Turner decided to use Anderson herself as a template . Terry Curtis was also an original sculpture of Supermarionation puppets . 
 Main character heads were initially sculpted in either Plasticine or clay . Once the general aspect had been finalised , this served as the template for a silicone rubber mould . This was coated with Bondaglass ( fibreglass mixed with resin ) and enhanced with <unk> , a putty @-@ like substance , to accentuate contours . The Bondaglass shell was then fitted with a solenoid , leather mouth parts and plastic eyes , as well as incisor teeth – a first for a Supermarionation production . Puppets known as " revamps " , which had plastic heads , portrayed the supporting characters . These marionettes started their working lives with only a mouth and eyes ; their faces were <unk> from one episode to the next . Particularly striking revamp moulds were retained and , as their numbers increased , photographed to compile an internal casting directory . 
 Wigs were made of mohair or , in the case of the Penelope puppet , human hair . Puppet bodies were built in three sizes : " large male " ( specifically for the Tracys and the Hood ) , " small male " and " small female " . Sylvia Anderson , the head costume designer , devised the main characters ' attire . To give the puppets increased mobility , the costume department generally avoided stiff synthetic materials , instead working with cotton , silk and wool . Between 1964 and 1966 , the department 's stock numbered more than 700 costumes . 
 Each puppet 's head was fitted with about 10 thin tungsten steel wires . During the filming , dialogue was played into the studio using modified tape recorders that converted the feed into electronic pulses . Two of the wires relayed these pulses to the internal solenoid , completing the Supermarionation process . The wires , which were sprayed black to reduce their visibility , were made even less noticeable through the application of powder paint that matched the background colours of the set . Glanville explained the time @-@ consuming nature of this process : " [ The puppeteers ] used to spend over half an hour on each shot getting rid of these wires , looking through the camera , puffing a bit more [ paint ] here , anti @-@ flare there ; and , I mean , it 's very depressing when somebody will say to us , ' Of course the wires showed . ' " Positioned on an overhead gantry with a hand @-@ held cruciform , the puppeteers co @-@ ordinated movements with the help of a viewfinder @-@ powered CCTV feedback system . As filming progressed , the crew started to dispense with wires and instead manipulate the puppets from the studio floor using rods . 
 Due to their low weight and the fact that they had only one control wire per leg , the puppets were unable to walk convincingly . Therefore , scenes involving movement were filmed from the waist up , with a puppeteer holding the legs below the level of the camera and using a " bobbing " action to simulate motion . Alternatively , dynamic shots were eliminated altogether : in an interview with New Scientist , director of photography John Read spoke of the advantages of circumventing the lack of agility so that the puppets " appear , for example , to walk through doors ( although the control wires make this impossible ) or pick up a coffee cup ( although their fingers are not in fact jointed ) . " Live @-@ action shots of human hands were inserted whenever scripts called for more dexterous actions to be performed .

 The effects for all the APF series from Supercar to UFO were directed by Derek Meddings , who later worked on the James Bond and Superman films . Knowing that Thunderbirds would be the " biggest project [ APF ] had worked on " , Meddings found himself struggling to manage his workload with the single filming unit that had produced all the effects for Stingray . He therefore established a second unit under technician Brian Johncock , and a third exclusively for filming airborne sequences . This expansion increased the number of APF crews and stages to five each . A typical episode contained around 100 effects shots ; Meddings ' team completed up to 18 per day . 
 An addition to the effects department was Mike Trim , who served as Meddings ' assistant in designing vehicles and buildings . Meddings and Trim jointly pioneered an " organic " design technique in which the exteriors of models and sets were customised with parts from model kits and children 's toys . Models and sets were also " dirtied down " with powder paint or pencil lead to create a used look . Toy cars and vans were used in long shot , while scale vehicles were equipped with basic steering and suspension for added realism . Miniature fans and <unk> pellets , which are capable of issuing air jets or chemical exhaust , were attached to the undersides to simulate dust trails . Another of Meddings ' inventions was a closed , cyclical effects stage nicknamed the " rolling road " : consisting of two or more loops of canvas running at different speeds , this device allowed shots of moving vehicles to be filmed on a static set to make more efficient use of the limited studio space . Airborne aircraft sequences were mounted against a " rolling sky " , with smoke fanned across to simulate passing clouds . 
 One of Meddings ' first tasks was to shoot stock footage of the Thunderbird machines and the series ' main locations , Tracy Island and Creighton @-@ Ward Mansion . The finished island model was a composite of more than a dozen smaller sets that could be detached from the whole and filmed separately . The architecture of the mansion was based on that of Stourhead House , located on the Stourhead Estate in Wiltshire . In the absence of head designer Reg Hill , who was serving as associate producer , Meddings was further tasked with designing the Thunderbird fleet and FAB 1 . Scale models for the six main vehicles were built by a contractor , Master Models of Middlesex . Models and puppet sets combined , more than 200 versions of the Thunderbird machines were created for the series . 
 During the designing and filming process , Meddings ' first priorities were realism and credibility . With the exception of Thunderbird 5 , each vehicle was built in three or four scales . Meddings ' swing @-@ wing concept for Thunderbird 1 was inspired by his wish to create something " more dynamic " than a fixed @-@ wing aircraft . He remained unsatisfied with the prototype of Thunderbird 2 until he inverted the wings , later commenting , " ... at the time , all aircraft had swept @-@ back wings . I only did it to be different . " This decision was made out of personal preference and was not informed by any expert knowledge on Meddings ' part . He described the Thunderbird 2 launch as " probably the most memorable " sequence that his team devised for an APF production . 
 The largest model of Thunderbird 3 , whose design was based on the Soviet Soyuz rocket , was six feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) tall . Thunderbird 4 was particularly difficult to film : as the scale of the model did not correspond to the water inside the shooting tank , creative camera angles and rapid editing were used to produce a sense of realistic perspective . Thunderbird 5 , the most difficult vehicle for Meddings to visualise , was based on the Tracy Island Round House . Since most of the space station 's appearances were provided by stock footage , the model was rarely filmed . Pod Vehicles were designed on an episode @-@ by @-@ episode basis and built from balsa wood , <unk> wood or fibreglass . To save time and costs , other minor vehicles were built in @-@ house from radio @-@ controlled model kits . 
 As the puppets of Lady Penelope and Parker needed to fit inside , the largest of all the models was the seven @-@ foot FAB 1 , which cost £ 2 @,@ 500 ( approximately £ 46 @,@ 000 today ) to build . The Rolls @-@ Royce 's name and colour were both chosen by Sylvia Anderson . Rolls @-@ Royce Ltd. supervised the construction of the plywood model and supplied APF with an authentic radiator grille for close @-@ up shots of the front of the car . In exchange for its cooperation , the company requested that a Spirit of Ecstasy be fixed to the chassis and that the characters avoid referring to the brand with abbreviations such as " Rolls " . 
 Scale explosions were created using substances such as fuller 's earth , petrol gel , magnesium strips and Cordtex explosive . Originally filmed at up to 120 frames per second ( f.p.s. ) , they were slowed down to 24 f.p.s. during post @-@ production to increase their apparent magnitude and length . Gunpowder canisters were ignited to create rocket jets . The wires that electronically fired the rockets also allowed a member of the crew , holding a cruciform and positioned on an overhead gantry , to " fly " the model over the set . By far the most unwieldy model was Thunderbird 2 , which Meddings remembered as being " awful " to fly . A combination of unreliable rockets and weak wiring frequently caused problems : should the former be slow to ignite , the current quickly caused the latter to overheat and snap , potentially damaging the model and even setting fire to the set . Conditions above the studio floor were often dangerous due to the heat and smoke . Although many of the exhaust sound effects used in the series were drawn from an audio library , some were specially recorded during a Red Arrows display at RAF Little Rissington in Gloucestershire . 
 By 1966 , Meddings ' commitments were split between Series Two and Thunderbirds Are Go . While Meddings worked on the film , camera operator Jimmy Elliott assumed the responsibility of directing the TV effects . By this stage , the basic frame of Thunderbird 2 had been damaged so many times that the model had needed to be rebuilt from scratch . Meddings was displeased with the result , reflecting that the replacement was " not only the wrong colour , it was a completely different shape ... I never felt our model @-@ makers managed to recapture the look of the original . " 
 Critic David Garland suggests that the challenge facing the Thunderbirds effects department was to strike a balance between the " conventional science @-@ fiction imperative of the ' futuristic ' " and the " seeping hyper @-@ realist concerns mandated by the Andersons ' approach to the puppets " . Thunderbirds has been praised for the quality of its effects . Jim Sangster and Paul Condon , writers of Collins Telly Guide , consider the model work " uniformly impressive " . To Paul Cornell , Martin Day and Keith Topping , writers of The Guinness Book of Classic British TV , the effects are " way beyond anything seen on TV previously " . Impressed by their work on Thunderbirds , film director Stanley Kubrick hired several members of Meddings ' staff to supervise the effects shooting for 2001 : A Space Odyssey .

 The series ' title sequence , storyboarded by Gerry Anderson , is made up of two parts . It opens with a countdown of " 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 : Thunderbirds Are Go ! " , provided by Dyneley in character as Jeff Tracy . In a departure from the style of Stingray , the Thunderbirds title sequence varies with each episode : the first part consists of an action montage that serves as a preview of the plot . Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn , biographers of Gerry Anderson , compare this device favourably to a film trailer . 
 The second part , accompanied by composer Barry Gray 's " The Thunderbirds March " , features portraits of the main puppet cast superimposed on various vehicles and settings . Peel describes this as " ostensibly a return to the ' series stars ' concept long known in TV " , while Garland considers such imagery demonstrative of Anderson 's commitment to " incremental realism " through a convergence of human and puppet characteristics . Essayist Jonathan Bignell suggests that the use of portraits conveys Anderson 's partiality to " visual revelation of machines and physical action " . 
 According to Daniel O 'Brien , writer of SF : UK : How British Science Fiction Changed the World , the Thunderbirds title sequence encapsulates the reasons for the series ' enduring popularity . Dyneley 's countdown is particularly well remembered and has been widely quoted . Dean Newman of the Syfy channel website ranks Thunderbirds eighth in a list of " Top 10 TV title sequences " , while Den of Geek 's Martin Anderson considers the sequence the best of any TV series .

 The score was composed by Gray , who served as musical director for all of the Anderson productions up to the first series of Space : 1999 . In response to Gerry Anderson 's request that the main theme have a " military feel " , Gray produced a brass @-@ dominated piece titled " The Thunderbirds March " , which was recorded in December 1964 at Olympic Studios in London . The end titles were originally to have been accompanied by " Flying High " , a lyrical track sung by Gary Miller with backing by Ken Barrie . Ultimately , a variation of the march was used instead . Incidental music was recorded over nine months between March and December 1965 . As most of the music budget was spent on the series ' earlier episodes , later instalments drew heavily on APF 's ever @-@ expanding music library . 
 Peel considers " The Thunderbirds March " to be " one of the best TV themes ever written – perfect for the show and catchy when heard alone " . Morag Reavley of BBC Online argues that the piece is " up there ... in the quintessential soundtrack of the Sixties " with the James Bond films and the songs of Frank Sinatra , Elvis and The Beatles . More generally , he praises the series ' " catchy , pulse @-@ quickening tunes " , as well as Gray 's aptitude for " musical nuance " and the mixing of genres . Heather Phares of Allmusic considers " Thunderbirds Are Go ! " – the track accompanying the launch sequences of Thunderbirds 1 , 2 and 3 – to be a reflection of the mod aspect of 1960s British spy fiction . She also highlights Gray 's homage to – and divergence from – musical norms , commenting that his score " sends up the spy and action / adventure conventions of the ' 60s very stylishly and subtly " . 
 David Huckvale identifies Wagnerian homage in both the theme music and the series ' premise . Noting that the theme 's opening string ostinato is similar in effect to a recurring motif in Ride of the Valkyries , he also likens the Thunderbird machines to Valkyries themselves : " Their function is more benevolent than those warrior maidens , but they do hover over danger , death and destruction . " Kevin J. Donnelly of the University of Southampton acknowledges the series ' " big @-@ sounding orchestral score " , which he compares to that of a live @-@ action film . He also suggests that the music serves partly to draw attention away from the physical imperfections of the puppets . 
 To celebrate the shows anniversary , " Thunderbirds Are Go - 50 Years On " at Colston Hall , Bristol was celebrated as the theme music is brought to life , led by Charles Hazlewood and his All Star Collective .

 Thunderbirds premiered on British television on 30 September 1965 on the ITV franchises ATV Midlands , Westward and Channel . Other broadcasters , including ATV London and Granada , started transmissions the following month . The Christmas @-@ themed series finale , " Give or Take a Million " , was first broadcast on 25 December 1966 . Despite Grade 's decision to extend the running time , Midlands and Granada broadcast each episode in two parts . In these areas , both 25 @-@ minute instalments aired on the same day , separated by the ITN Evening News . The conclusion opened with a narration by Shane Rimmer summarising the first part 's action . 
 Granada transmitted Thunderbirds in its original , 50 @-@ minute format for the first time with the start of repeats in 1966 . In 1968 , the franchise briefly aired episodes in three parts due to timeslot restrictions . The availability of repeats during the 1960s and 1970s varied among regions . ATV Midlands screened the series regularly into the early 1970s ; by contrast , Thunderbirds was entirely absent from Yorkshire Television between 1968 and 1976 . The series was last transmitted on the ITV franchises in 1981 . 
 In 1990 , 8 of the 19 audio episodes released by APF Records were converted into radio dramas , which were transmitted on BBC Radio 5 . The success of the radio series encouraged the BBC to acquire the rights to the TV episodes , which it broadcast simultaneously in all regions from September 1991 on BBC 2 . 
 Since the end of the first network run , which achieved average viewing figures of more than six million , the BBC has repeated the series six times : between 1992 and 1993 ( Series One only ) , 1994 and 1995 ( nine episodes only ) , and 2000 and 2001 ( in remastered form ) , as well as in 2003 , 2005 and 2006 . Other channels that have shown repeats include UK Gold ( 1994 – 95 ) , Bravo ( 1996 – 97 ) , Cartoon Network ( 2001 – 02 ) , Boomerang ( 2001 – 03 ) and Syfy ( 2009 ) . In Scotland , the BBC screened a Gaelic dub , <unk> Tar As ( " Thunderbirds Are Go " ) in the early 1990s . 
 Before its UK debut , Thunderbirds was distributed to 30 other countries including the US , Canada , Australia and Japan . Pre @-@ sales revenue totalled £ 350 @,@ 000 ( approximately £ 6 million today ) . In the year following the series ' first appearance , the number of countries increased to 66 . In Japan , where it was first broadcast by NHK , Thunderbirds attracted a sizeable fan following and influenced series such as Ultraman , Mighty Jack , Himitsu Sentai <unk> and Super Rescue <unk> . In the US , the two @-@ part format entered first @-@ run syndication , to modest success , in 1968 . Other overseas broadcasters have included TechTV and Family Room HD ( US ) , BBC Kids and YTV ( Canada ) , Nine Network and Foxtel ( Australia ) , TV3 ( New Zealand ) , MediaCorp <unk> Kids Central ( Singapore ) and RTÉ Two ( Republic of Ireland ) .

 Thunderbirds is generally considered the Andersons ' most popular series and their greatest critical and commercial success . In 1966 , the show received a Royal Television Society Silver Medal for Outstanding Artistic Achievement and Gerry Anderson received an honorary fellowship of the British Kinematograph , Sound and Television Society . In 2007 , Thunderbirds achieved 19th place in a Radio Times magazine reader poll to determine the best science @-@ fiction TV programme of all time . It is ranked fourth by the 2013 Channel 5 list show 50 Greatest Kids ' TV Shows . 
 For Peel , Thunderbirds is " without a doubt the peak of the Supermarionation achievement " . Suggesting that the series is pitched at a " more adult " level than its predecessors , he adds that its sense of adventure , effective humour and " gripping and convincing " episodes ensured that " everyone in the audience found something to love about it . " Simon Heffer , a fan of Thunderbirds in childhood , commented positively on the series for The Daily Telegraph in 2011 : " All the elements we children discerned in whatever grown @-@ up television we had been allowed to watch were present in Thunderbirds : dramatic theme and incidental music ; well @-@ developed plots ; goodies and baddies ; swaggering Americans , at a time when the whole of Britain was in a cultural cringe to them ; and , of course , glamorous locations ... Then , of course , there was the nail @-@ biting tension of the rescues themselves ... " Film critic Kim Newman describes the series as a " television perennial " . 
 In his foreword to John Marriott 's book , Thunderbirds Are Go ! , Anderson put forward several explanations for the series ' enduring popularity : it " contains elements that appeal to most children – danger , jeopardy and destruction . But because International Rescue 's mission is to save life , there is no gratuitous violence . " According to Anderson , Thunderbirds incorporates a " strong family atmosphere , where Dad reigns supreme " . Both O 'Brien and script editor Alan Pattillo have praised the series ' positive " family values " . In addition , Heffer and others have written of its cross @-@ generational appeal . In 2000 , shortly before the series ' BBC revival , Brian Viner remarked in Radio Times that Thunderbirds was on the point of " captivating yet another generation of viewers " . Stuart Hood , writing for The Spectator in 1965 , praised Thunderbirds as a " modern fairy tale " ; adding that it " can sometimes be frightening " , he recommended that children watch it accompanied by their parents . Writing for Dreamwatch in 1994 , Andrew Thomas described Thunderbirds as only " nominally " a children 's programme : " Its themes are universal and speak as much to the adult in the child as the child in the adult . " 
 Jeff Evans , author of The Penguin TV Companion , argues that the series ' 50 @-@ minute format allows for stronger character development and " tension @-@ building " . O 'Brien is less positive in his appraisal of the writing , asserting that the plots are often " formulaic " and are sometimes " stretched to snapping point " by the extended running time . Cornell , Day and Topping are critical : they consider the writing at times " woefully poor " and argue that Thunderbirds as a whole is " often as clichéd as previous Anderson series " . Peel , despite praising the storylines and characterisation , suggests that the " tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek " humour of Stingray is less evident . Where Thunderbirds improves on its predecessor , Peel believes , is in its rejection of fantasy plot devices , child and animal characters , comical and stereotyped villains and what he terms the " standard Anderson sexism " : female characters , marginalised in earlier series , are more commonly seen to play active and sometimes heroic roles . 
 Noting the attention to detail of the series ' launch sequences , Jonathan Bignell argues that part of the motivation for dedicating large amounts of screen time to the Thunderbird craft is the need to compensate for the limited mobility of the puppet cast . The focus on futuristic machines has also been explored by cultural historian Nicholas J. Cull , who comments that of all the Andersons ' series , Thunderbirds is the most evocative of a recurring theme : the " necessity of the human component of the machine " , whereby the failures of new technology are overcome by " brave human beings and technology working together " . This makes the series ' vision of the 2060s " wonderfully humanistic and reassuring " . O 'Brien similarly praises this optimism , comparing the Tracy family to guardian Übermensch . Writing for Wired UK magazine , Warren Ellis asserts that the series ' scientific vision could inspire the next generation of " mad and frightening engineers " , adding that Thunderbirds " trades in vast , demented concepts ... immense and very beautiful ideas as solutions to problems . " 
 Thomas argues that the world of Thunderbirds is similar to the 1960s to the extent that contemporary capitalism and class structures appear to have survived mostly intact . He also observes , however , that wealth and high social status are often depicted as character flaws rather than strengths . According to Thomas , a contributing factor to the series ' lasting popularity is the realism of IR 's machines . Newman , for his part , suggests that " the point isn 't realism . The 21st century of Thunderbirds is detailed ... but also de @-@ populated , a high @-@ tech <unk> " . He is more negative in his comparisons of contemporary and future values , noting the " square , almost 50s " attitudes to race , gender and class . With regard to stereotyping , Hood comments that he " would be happier if [ villains ] didn 't seem to be recognisable by their pigmentation " . Cull , by contrast , considers the series largely progressive on the subject of race , arguing that it rejects negative stereotyping through the use of " positive non @-@ white characters " such as Kyrano and Tin @-@ Tin . However , he deems many of the one @-@ off villains derivative , commenting that these characters are typically presented as " corrupt businessmen , spivs and gangsters familiar from crime films " . 
 Various commentators – including Bignell , Cull and O 'Brien – have also discussed Thunderbirds as a product of the Cold War era . Bignell comments that the Hood 's Oriental appearance and mysterious powers draw parallels with James Bond villains and fears of China operating as " a ' third force ' antagonistic to the West " . Cull observes that , despite the series ' focus on the dangers of nuclear technology , the Thunderbird machines contradict this particular theme : in their case , " an image of technology associated with the threat of Cold War mass destruction – the rocket emerging from the hidden silo – was appropriated and deployed to save life rather than to take it . " He argues that the series adheres more closely to cultural norms by drawing on the " Cold War cult of the secret agent whose skills defend the home from enemies unknown " , noting Lady Penelope 's role as a spy in addition to two episodes ( " 30 Minutes After Noon " and " The Man from MI.5 " ) that are heavily influenced by the James Bond novels and film adaptations . 
 The presentation of smoking in Thunderbirds was the subject of a study published in the medical journal Tobacco Control in 2002 . Despite identifying examples in 26 episodes , Kate Hunt of the University of Glasgow concluded that Thunderbirds does not actively promote smoking – a view opposed by the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation ( RCLCF ) at the time of the series ' relaunch on BBC 2 . Rejecting the RCLCF 's proposal that the remastered episodes be edited to digitally erase all visible cigarettes and cigars , the BBC stated that the series " does not glorify or encourage smoking " and described the activity as " incidental to the plot " .

 More than 3 @,@ 000 Thunderbirds @-@ themed products have been marketed since the series ' debut . To accommodate the high demand for tie @-@ ins , APF established three dedicated subsidiaries : AP Films Merchandising , AP Films Music and AP Films Toys . Some British commentators dubbed the 1966 end @-@ of @-@ year shopping season " Thunderbirds Christmas " due to the series ' popularity . In the early 1990s , Matchbox launched a new toy range to coincide with the BBC 2 repeats . Sales figures for Christmas 1992 exceeded those achieved by the Star Wars merchandising campaigns of the 1970s and 1980s . Demand for Matchbox 's Tracy Island Playset overwhelmed supply , resulting in shop fights and a substantial black market for the toy . 
 A comic strip featuring the characters of Lady Penelope and Parker debuted in the early issues of APF Publishing 's children 's title TV Century 21 in 1965 . A full @-@ length Thunderbirds strip appeared a year later , at which point the Lady Penelope adventures were given their own comic . Thunderbirds , Lady Penelope and Captain Scarlet and Thunderbirds annuals were published in the late 1960s ; during the same period , eight original novels were written . In 2008 , FTL Publications of Minnesota launched a new series of tie @-@ in novels . 
 Between 1965 and 1967 , APF Records released 19 audio episodes in the form of vinyl EPs . Three are original stories ; the rest are adapted from TV episode soundtracks , with additional narration provided by a member of the voice cast . The series ' first video game tie @-@ in , developed for the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum computers , was released by Firebird Software in 1985 . Other titles have since been released for the Game Boy Color , Game Boy Advance and PlayStation 2 . During the late 1980s , the series was issued on home video for the first time by PolyGram and its subsidiary Channel 5 . Following its acquisition by Carlton International Media in 1999 , Thunderbirds was digitally remastered for the release of the first DVD versions in 2000 . Blu @-@ ray Disc editions followed in 2008 .

 Thunderbirds has been followed by two film sequels , a live @-@ action film adaptation , two animated TV remakes and several re @-@ edited presentations for TV broadcast and home video .

 The feature @-@ length film sequels Thunderbirds Are Go and Thunderbird 6 were released in 1966 and 1968 . The first was greenlit by Lew Grade before the TV series had started its broadcast run . Written and produced by the Andersons and directed by David Lane , both films were distributed by United Artists . Neither was a critical or commercial success , and Century 21 Cinema 's plans for further sequels were abandoned . 
 In the early 1980s , episodes of Thunderbirds and other Supermarionation series were re @-@ edited by ITC 's New York offices to create a series of compilation films . Branded " Super Space Theater " , this format was mostly intended for family viewing on American cable and syndicated TV . Three Thunderbirds features were produced : Thunderbirds to the Rescue , Thunderbirds In Outer Space and Countdown to Disaster . 
 Plans for a live @-@ action film adaptation were first announced in 1993 . These eventually culminated in the 2004 film Thunderbirds , directed by Jonathan Frakes and produced by StudioCanal and Working Title Films . It was a critical and commercial failure and was poorly received by fans of the TV series .

 The Andersons sold their intellectual and profit participation rights to Thunderbirds and their other productions in the 1970s . As a result , they had no developmental control over subsequent adaptations of their works . Thunderbirds was first remade for TV in the early 1980s as Thunderbirds 2086 . In this anime re @-@ imagining , set 20 years after the original , the vastly expanded IR is based within an <unk> and operates 17 Thunderbird machines . It was inspired by Thunderhawks , an updated story concept by Gerry Anderson and Reg Hill that later served as the basis for Anderson 's Supermacromation series Terrahawks . 
 Two re @-@ edited series , based on condensed versions of 13 of the original episodes , aired in the US in 1994 . The first , Thunderbirds USA , was broadcast as part of the Fox Kids programming block ; the second , Turbocharged Thunderbirds , was syndicated by UPN . Developed as a comedy , Turbocharged Thunderbirds moved the action to the planet " Thunder @-@ World " and combined the original puppet footage with new live @-@ action scenes featuring a pair of human teenagers . 
 As well as Thunderhawks , Anderson developed other ideas for a remake . A 1976 concept , Inter @-@ Galactic Rescue 4 , was to have featured a variable @-@ configuration craft capable of performing rescues on land and sea , in air and in space ; Anderson pitched the idea to NBC , who rejected it . This was followed in 1984 by another proposed updating , T @-@ Force , which at first could not be pursued owing to a lack of funding . Development resumed in 1993 , when it was decided to produce the series , now titled GFI , using cel animation . But Anderson was disappointed with the results and the production was abandoned . 
 In 2005 , Anderson re @-@ affirmed his wish to remake Thunderbirds but stated that he had been unable to secure the necessary rights from Granada Ventures . His negotiations with the company and its successor , ITV plc , continued for the next few years . In 2008 , he expressed his commitment to creating an " updated " version , ideally using CGI ; three years later , he announced that work on the series had commenced . Following Anderson 's death in December 2012 , it was confirmed that a deal had been struck between ITV Studios and <unk> Pictures to remake Thunderbirds using a combination of CGI and live @-@ action model sets . The new version , Thunderbirds Are Go , has been commissioned for two series of 26 episodes each . The first 13 episodes of Series One were broadcast on ITV HD and CITV between April and June 2015 . 
 In July 2015 , to celebrate the series ' 50th anniversary , Filmed in Supermarionation documentary director Stephen La Rivière launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise the funds necessary to produce three new puppet episodes based on the Thunderbirds mini @-@ albums of the 1960s . The project , titled " Thunderbirds 1965 " , is supported by ITV , Sylvia Anderson and the estate of Gerry Anderson . 
 = = Influence = = 
 Thunderbirds has influenced TV programmes , films and various other media . The puppet comedy of the film Team America : World Police was directly inspired by the idiosyncrasies of Thunderbirds @-@ era Supermarionation techniques . Allusion and homage are also evident in Wallace and Gromit : A Close Shave , Austin Powers : The Spy Who Shagged Me and Spaced , as well as the character design of Star Wars : The Clone Wars . The BBC sketch comedy Not Only ... But Also included a segment titled " <unk> " – a parody of Thunderbirds , Supercar and Stingray . 
 IR 's life @-@ saving mission inspired the founding of the volunteer International Rescue Corps , originally made up of a group of British firemen who contributed to the humanitarian effort following the 1980 <unk> earthquake . Virgin Group has used the series in branding its services : Virgin Atlantic operates a Boeing 747 @-@ 400 airliner named Lady Penelope , while Virgin Trains owns a fleet of locomotives that are all named after main characters and vehicles and used specifically to " rescue " broken @-@ down trains . 
 A mimed stage show , Thunderbirds : F.A.B. , has toured internationally and popularised a staccato style of movement known colloquially as the " Thunderbirds walk " . The production has periodically been revived as Thunderbirds : F.A.B. – The Next Generation . 
 Cover versions of " The Thunderbirds March " have been released by musicians and bands such as Billy Cotton , Joe Loss , Frank Sidebottom , The Rezillos and The Shadows . Groups who have written songs inspired by the series include Fuzzbox ( with " International Rescue " ) , TISM ( with " Thunderbirds Are Coming Out " ) , Busted ( with " Thunderbirds / 3AM " ) and V6 ( with " Thunderbirds – Your Voice " ) . In 1991 , Anderson filmed the music video for the Dire Straits single " Calling Elvis " with a collection of Thunderbirds @-@ style puppets . 
 During the 1960s , APF produced themed TV advertisements for Lyons Maid and Kellogg 's . Aspects of Thunderbirds have since been used in advertising for Swinton Insurance , Nestlé Kit Kat , Specsavers and the UK Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency . 
 = Angel ( Madonna song ) = 
 " Angel " is a song by American singer Madonna from her second studio album Like a Virgin ( 1984 ) . It was released on April 10 , 1985 by Sire Records as the third single from the album . Written by Madonna and Steve Bray , it was one of the first songs developed for the project and , according to Madonna , was inspired by a girl who is saved by an angel , and she falls in love with him . " Angel " was released as a 12 " single with " Into the Groove " in some countries and charted likewise . A music video was initially planned for the release , but was later cancelled . Instead a promotional video comprising clips from her previous videos was released in the United Kingdom . 
 Musically " Angel " consists of three chord ascending hook , which serves for the verse and chorus . It has vocal harmonies beneath the main chorus and the lyrics repeat the angel @-@ like image of Madonna 's saviour . Critical response to the song was mixed , with some music critics calling it a classic and others deeming it sub @-@ par compared to Madonna 's previous singles . " Angel " became the singer 's fifth consecutive top @-@ five single on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached the top of its dance charts . It was also able to reach number @-@ one in Australia and the top @-@ five of the charts in Canada , Ireland , Japan , New Zealand , Spain and the United Kingdom . Madonna has performed the song only once , on The Virgin Tour in 1985 .

 " Angel " was written by Madonna and Steve Bray and released worldwide on April 10 , 1985 . Madonna explained to Bray that she wanted a stronger , more pop @-@ oriented album , hence the songs should reflect that . One of the first songs that they developed was " Angel " . Madonna commented that the song was about a girl , who was " in depression over something . An angel appeared and healed her soul , making her fall madly in love with Him . [ ... ] It 's something that I felt when I was young . I thought it would make for an interesting story if I wrote that [ experience ] as a song on my record . " The song was recorded as early as April 1984 , but the whole project was held off , much to Madonna 's frustration , by the continuing sales of her self @-@ titled debut album , which had by then sold over a million copies in United States . She had decided to release " Angel " as the initial single from the album , but changed her mind , after the recording of the title track " Like a Virgin " was complete . " Angel " was ultimately released as the third single , and included the song " Into the Groove " , from Madonna 's 1985 film Desperately Seeking Susan , on the B @-@ side of the 12 @-@ inch maxi @-@ single . 
 Madonna had initially planned to release a music video for " Angel " , but later decided to go against it , as at that time , there were already five Madonna music videos on @-@ rotation in the music channels and were being broadcast continuously . Hence , Warner Bros. and Madonna felt that adding another video to the already saturated channels , might not be in her favour . A promotional video , containing scenes from the music videos of " Burning Up " , " Borderline " , " Lucky Star " , " Like a Virgin " and " Material Girl " was made by Warner Bros. Records and aired in the United Kingdom . The video was included on the promotional @-@ only video compilations It 's That Girl and She 's Breathless .

 " Angel " begins with a laugh and an echo , panning from left to the right . The song is built on an ascending hook consisting of three chord sequence , which serves for the verse and chorus . It consists of a constant 8th rhythm throughout the song , making it sound similar to the songs of the band Machine . Vocal harmonies are also added beneath the main chorus . It is a two @-@ bar phrase song , and laughter is again added as the song slowly fades out . Madonna sings in her lower register at the beginning , and shifts to the higher one in the line " I can see it in your e @-@ e @-@ e @-@ <unk> @-@ e @-@ s " . The line was taken from the song " Death Disco " ( 1979 ) , by the British musical group Public Image Ltd . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com , by Alfred Publishing , the song is set in the time signature of common time , with a medium tempo of 120 beats per minute . It is composed in the key of G major , with Madonna 's voice spanning from the high @-@ note of G3 to the low @-@ note of B4 . The song has a basic sequence of Dm7 – Em7 – F – Dm7 – Em7 – F as its chord progression . The lyrics continuously repeat the angel @-@ like image of Madonna 's saviour .

 Rikky Rooksby , author of Madonna : The Complete Guide to Her Music , commented that " Angel " is a song " that is less than even the sum of its parts .

 Adam Henry Carter is a fictional character from the BBC espionage television series Spooks , which follows the exploits of Section D , a counter @-@ terrorism division of MI5 . He is portrayed by British actor Rupert Penry @-@ Jones . The character is a former MI6 officer who takes charge as the chief of Section D , and hence the head protagonist following the departure of Tom Quinn in series three . 
 Adam Carter was created with the knowledge that Matthew Macfadyen , who played Tom Quinn , would leave the series . The intention was that Adam would be different from Tom ; the producers wanted a character who was a husband with an MI6 background . Rupert Penry @-@ Jones was cast after three auditions . Before the sixth series finale aired , it was announced that Penry @-@ Jones would leave the series . In the premiere episode of series seven , Carter is killed in a car bomb . His death was voted the fourth most shocking death in the series . Rupert Penry @-@ Jones was awarded " Best Actor " at the Crime Thriller Awards for his portrayal of Adam Carter . 
 = = Role in Spooks = = 
 Before joining Section D , Adam Carter was an MI6 officer who specialised in the Middle East . Oliver Mace ( Tim McInnerny ) , chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee , describes Carter as a " loose cannon " . He is a fluent Arabic speaker and has good countersurveillance skills . In one past operation , Adam worked a case in Damascus to recruit Syrian intelligence officer Farook <unk> as a double agent to work with the Israelis and stop a string of suicide attacks . He used Farook 's wife , Fiona ( Olga Sosnovska ) as a way in . Fiona and Adam subsequently fell in love and started an affair . When Farook discovered this , he had Adam brutally tortured . After he escaped , Adam framed Farook , persuading the Syrians that he was a traitor , and Farook was supposedly hanged for this . Adam subsequently married Fiona and together they had a son , Wes .

 The producers were aware that Matthew Macfadyen would leave the series after playing Tom Quinn for two years , and they did not know whether he would return for the first two episodes . An eight- to nine @-@ member team came up with the new character of Adam Carter . They wanted Adam to have a different dynamic than Tom ; the producers set up a girlfriend / boyfriend storyline in the first series – with Adam , they wanted him to have a wife ( Fiona Carter ) who works in the Security Service , since married couples working in that environment are common . They wanted Adam to be more animated and energetic than Tom . Writer Howard Brenton wanted him to have an MI6 background , and have something awful happen to him in the past . Brenton invented the backstory of Syria early on into the third series , which he wanted to revisit in the fourth series . 
 Early on in the development process , the producers wanted to cast a " brilliant actor " with a strong screen presence . They discussed casting Rupert Penry @-@ Jones for the role of Adam Carter early in the process , though it took months to finally decide to cast him . Though Penry @-@ Jones was aware of Spooks and its success , he had never seen any episodes . To be interested in the role , he spent a weekend catching up on the entire first and second series . He did not take long to decide , since his last leading role was four years previously , in 2000 in the Channel 4 drama North Square . Adam was originally meant to be older , and more " street . " When he found acting " street " was too difficult , Penry @-@ Jones acted more like himself . He had to audition three times before the producers included him , four months before filming commenced . 
 On his first day for filming series three , Penry @-@ Jones participated in a fight scene in the middle of the first episode . He felt a little wary replacing Matthew Macfadyen . After two months of filming , Penry @-@ Jones began to feel more at ease with the role . He felt especially so after he started working for the fourth series . He returned to the fourth series because he thought his character took off by the end of the last series , and wanted to see which direction he would go to next . The crew wanted Adam to go from a " happy @-@ go @-@ lucky " figure to wanting him to deal with things that would make it hard for Adam to be jokey towards the end of the fourth series ; this involved Fiona 's death . 
 Before the sixth series finale aired in December 2007 , it was announced that Rupert Penry @-@ Jones would leave the series sometime in series seven . Penry @-@ Jones wanted to leave the series as he felt the character had run its course , as well as wanting to explore other venues . He also stated that working in Spooks was " great , " but felt he was " getting to the point where I needed to move on . " Before the seventh series aired , Penry @-@ Jones revealed his character would leave in what he believed was " one of the best " Spooks exits . He found that his last days on Spooks was generally upsetting and " welled up " on his final day . Penry @-@ Jones did not envisage lasting as long as he did , because he believed the series would not last as long as it has . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Rupert Penry @-@ Jones noted that the initial fan reaction towards Adam Carter was negative , " because Matthew [ Macfadyen ] was so successful and loved . " It took a while for fans to accept him . Penry @-@ Jones also felt that his role in Spooks , " definitely took my profile up several notches . " In the " best of drama " viewer polls at BBC Online , Penry @-@ Jones was voted third in the " Best Actor " category , beating co @-@ stars Matthew Macfadyen , who was fifth , David Oyelowo , who was seventh , and Peter Firth , who was tenth . He was later voted fifth in 2005 , and ninth in 2006 . 
 In a DVD review of the third series of Spooks , Michael Mackenzie of Home Cinema had mixed views of Adam 's introduction , stating " despite ardent protests from both cast and crew , Tom and Adam are almost exactly the same character . " In the fifth series , Mackenzie felt more open towards Adam , stating Adam Carter " isn 't exactly James Bond [ ... ] he doesn 't jet around the world , bedding multiple women and engaging in fisticuffs atop precarious construction rigs , but he does rush around London with a gun in his hand and occasionally ends up on the receiving end of the odd beating . " David Blackwell of Enterline Media was receptive of Adam in the fourth series , as he felt Adam became " more fleshed out and interesting . " However , Blackwell was critical of Adam 's role in the following fifth series , stating it is " too much " about him . 
 Fans and critics alike displayed shock towards the character 's death in the first episode of the seventh series . Fans voted Adam 's death as the fourth most shocking death scene in the series . The Radio Times stated the shock factor of his death was " spectacular " and said that " driving a primed car bomb to a safe place is so run @-@ of @-@ the @-@ mill for the spooks they wouldn 't normally break a sweat . This time , however , it went off . Me @-@ Me @-@ <unk> has said that Adam 's death was " bound to happen " and stated " just when we 've formed a deep , meaningful and totally healthy relationship with the lead gentleman [ ... ] they go and blow him up " , adding " It 's just not fair . " The Times 's Hilary Rose noted that fans will remember Adam 's " dramatic exit , " and said that " the nation 's women duly went into mourning , " regarding that " pretty much every woman with a pulse seems to fancy Rupert . " She then noted that some would find " consolation in the shape of new Spooks totty Richard Armitage . " 
 In 2008 , Rupert Penry @-@ Jones won a Crime Thriller Award for " Best Actor " for his portrayal as Adam Carter . Penry @-@ Jones won the award against Ashes to Ashes ' Philip Glenister , Midnight Man and Murphy 's Law 's James Nesbitt , The Wire ' Dominic West , and Criminal Justice ' Ben Whishaw . In the same ceremony , co @-@ star Hermione Norris won " Best Actress " . 
 = Corinthian War = 
 The Corinthian War was an ancient Greek conflict lasting from 395 BC until 387 BC , pitting Sparta against a coalition of four allied states , Thebes , Athens , Corinth , and Argos , who were initially backed by Persia . The immediate cause of the war was a local conflict in northwest Greece in which both Thebes and Sparta intervened . The deeper cause was hostility towards Sparta provoked by that city 's " expansionism in Asia Minor , central and northern Greece and even the west " . 
 The war was fought on two fronts , on land near Corinth ( hence the name ) and Thebes and at sea in the Aegean . On land , the Spartans achieved several early successes in major battles , but were unable to capitalize on their advantage , and the fighting soon became stalemated . At sea , the Spartan fleet was decisively defeated by a Persian fleet early in the war , an event that effectively ended Sparta 's attempts to become a naval power . Taking advantage of this fact , Athens launched several naval campaigns in the later years of the war , recapturing a number of islands that had been part of the original Athenian Empire during the 5th century BC . 
 Alarmed by these Athenian successes , the Persians stopped backing the allies and began supporting Sparta . This defection forced the allies to seek peace . The Peace of Antalcidas , commonly known as the King 's Peace , was signed in 387 BC , ending the war . This treaty declared that Persia would control all of Ionia , and that all other Greek cities would be independent . Sparta was to be the guardian of the peace , with the power to enforce its clauses . The effects of the war , therefore , were to establish Persia 's ability to interfere successfully in Greek politics and to affirm Sparta 's hegemonic position in the Greek political system . 
 = = Events leading to the war = = 
 In the Peloponnesian War , which had ended in 404 BC , Sparta had enjoyed the support of nearly every mainland Greek state and the Persian Empire , and in the months and years following that war , a number of the island states of the Aegean had come under its control . This solid base of support , however , was fragmented in the years following the war . Despite the collaborative nature of the victory , Sparta alone received the plunder taken from the defeated states and the tribute payments from the former Athenian Empire . Sparta 's allies were further alienated when , in 402 BC , Sparta attacked and subdued Elis , a member of the Peloponnesian League that had angered the Spartans during the course of the Peloponnesian War . Corinth and Thebes refused to send troops to assist Sparta in its campaign against Elis . 
 Thebes , Corinth and Athens also refused to participate in a Spartan expedition to Ionia in 398 BC , with the Thebans going so far as to disrupt a sacrifice that the Spartan king Agesilaus attempted to perform in their territory before his departure . Despite the absence of these states , Agesilaus campaigned effectively against the Persians in Lydia , advancing as far inland as Sardis . The satrap Tissaphernes was executed for his failure to contain Agesilaus , and his replacement , <unk> , bribed the Spartans to move north , into the satrapy of Pharnabazus . Agesilaus did so , but simultaneously began preparing a sizable navy . 
 Unable to defeat Agesilaus ' army , Pharnabazus decided to force Agesilaus to withdraw by stirring up trouble on the Greek mainland . He dispatched Timocrates of Rhodes , an Asiatic Greek , to distribute ten thousand gold darics in the major cities of the mainland and incite them to act against Sparta . Timocrates visited Athens , Thebes , Corinth , and Argos , and succeeded in persuading powerful factions in each of those states to pursue an anti @-@ Spartan policy . The Thebans , who had previously demonstrated their antipathy towards Sparta , undertook to bring about a war . 
 = = Early events ( 395 BC ) = = 
 = = = Initial fighting = = = 
 Xenophon claims that , unwilling to challenge Sparta directly , the Thebans instead chose to precipitate a war by encouraging their allies , the Locrians , to collect taxes from territory claimed by both Locris and Phocis . In response , the Phocians invaded Locris , and ransacked Locrian territory . The Locrians appealed to Thebes for assistance , and the Thebans invaded Phocian territory ; the Phocians , in turn , appealed to their ally , Sparta , and the Spartans , pleased to have a pretext to discipline the Thebans , ordered general mobilization . A Theban embassy was dispatched to Athens to request support ; the Athenians voted to assist Thebes , and a perpetual alliance was concluded between Athens and the Boeotian confederacy . 
 The Spartan plan called for two armies , one under Lysander and the other under Pausanias , to rendezvous at and attack the Boeotian city of Haliartus . Lysander , arriving before Pausanias , successfully persuaded the city of Orchomenus to revolt from the Boeotian confederacy , and advanced to Haliartus with his troops and a force of <unk> . There , he was killed in the Battle of Haliartus after bringing his force too near the walls of the city ; the battle ended inconclusively , with the Spartans suffering early losses but then defeating a group of Thebans who pursued the Spartans onto rough terrain where they were at a disadvantage . Pausanias , arriving a day later , took back the bodies of the Spartan dead under a truce , and returned to Sparta . There , he was put on trial for his life for failing to arrive and support Lysander at the designated time . He fled to Tegea before he could be convicted . 
 = = = Alliance against Sparta expands = = = 
 In the wake of these events , both the Spartans and their opponents prepared for more serious fighting to come . In late 395 BC , Corinth and Argos entered the war as co @-@ belligerents with Athens and Thebes . A council was formed at Corinth to manage the affairs of this alliance . The allies then sent emissaries to a number of smaller states and received the support of many of them . 
 Alarmed by these developments , the Spartans prepared to send out an army against this new alliance , and sent a messenger to Agesilaus ordering him to return to Greece . The orders were a disappointment to Agesilaus , who had looked forward to further successful campaigning . It is said he wryly observed , but for ten thousand Persian " archers " , he would have vanquished all Asia . Thus , he turned back with his troops , crossing the Hellespont and marched west through Thrace . 
 = = War on land and sea ( 394 BC ) = = 
 = = = Nemea = = = 
 After a brief engagement between Thebes and Phocis , in which Thebes was victorious , the allies gathered a large army at Corinth . A sizable force was sent out from Sparta to challenge this force . The forces met at the dry bed of the Nemea River , in Corinthian territory , where the Spartans won a decisive victory . As often happened in hoplite battles , the right flank of each army was victorious , with the Spartans defeating the Athenians while the Thebans , Argives , and Corinthians defeated the various Peloponnesians opposite them ; the Spartans then attacked and killed a number of Argives , Corinthians , and Thebans as these troops returned from pursuing the defeated Peloponnesians . The coalition army lost 2 @,@ 800 men , while the Spartans and their allies lost only 1 @,@ 100 . 
 = = = Cnidus = = = 
 The next major action of the war took place at sea , where both the Persians and the Spartans had assembled large fleets during Agesilaus 's campaign in Asia . By levying ships from the Aegean states under his control , Agesilaus had raised a force of 120 triremes , which he placed under the command of his brother @-@ in @-@ law Peisander , who had never held a command of this nature before . The Persians , meanwhile , had already assembled a joint Phoenician , Cilician , and Cypriot fleet , under the command of the experienced Athenian admiral Conon , which had seized Rhodes in 396 BC . These two fleets met off the point of Cnidus in 394 BC . The Spartans fought determinedly , particularly in the vicinity of Peisander 's ship , but were eventually overwhelmed ; large numbers of ships were sunk or captured , and the Spartan fleet was essentially wiped from the sea . Following this victory , Conon and Pharnabazus sailed along the coast of Ionia , expelling Spartan governors and garrisons from the cities , although they failed to reduce the Spartan bases at Abydos and Sestos under the command of <unk> . 
 = = = Coronea = = = 
 By this time , Agesilaus 's army , after brushing off attacks from the Thessalians during its march through that country , had arrived in Boeotia , where it was met by an army gathered from the various states of the anti @-@ Spartan alliance . Agesilaus 's force from Asia , composed largely of emancipated helots and mercenary veterans of the Ten Thousand , was augmented by half a Spartan regiment from Orchomenus , and another half a regiment that had been transported across the Gulf of Corinth . These armies met each other at Coronea , in Theban territory ; as at Nemea , both right wings were victorious , with the Thebans breaking through while the rest of the allies were defeated . Seeing that the rest of their force had been defeated , the Thebans formed up to break back through to their camp . Agesilaus met their force head on , and in the struggle that followed a number of Thebans were killed before the remainder were able to force their way through and rejoin their allies . After this victory , Agesilaus sailed with his army across the Gulf of Corinth and returned to Sparta . 
 = = Later events ( 393 – 388 BC ) = = 
 The events of 394 BC left the Spartans with the upper hand on land , but weak at sea . The coalition states had been unable to defeat the Spartan phalanx in the field , but had kept their alliance strong and prevented the Spartans from moving at will through central Greece . The Spartans would continue to attempt , over the next several years , to knock either Corinth or Argos out of the war ; the anti @-@ Spartan allies , meanwhile , sought to preserve their united front against Sparta , while Athens and Thebes took advantage of Sparta 's preoccupation to enhance their own power in areas they had traditionally dominated . 
 = = = Persian assistance , rebuilding at Athens , civil strife at Corinth = = = 
 In 393 BC , Conon and Pharnabazus sailed to mainland Greece , where they raided the coast of Laconia and seized the island of Cythera , where they left a garrison and an Athenian governor . They then sailed to Corinth , where they distributed money and urged the members of the council to show the Persian king that they were trustworthy . Pharnabazus then dispatched Conon with substantial funds and a large part of the fleet to Attica , where he joined in the rebuilding of the long walls from Athens to Piraeus , a project that had been initiated by Thrasybulus in 394 BC . With the assistance of the rowers of the fleet , and the workers paid for by the Persian money , the construction was soon completed . Athens quickly took advantage of its possession of walls and a fleet to seize the islands of <unk> , Imbros , and Lemnos , on which it established <unk> ( citizen colonies ) . 
 At about this time , civil strife broke out in Corinth between the democratic party and the oligarchic party . The democrats , supported by the Argives , launched an attack on their opponents , and the oligarchs were driven from the city . These exiles went to the Spartans , based at this time at Sicyon , for support , while the Athenians and Boeotians came up to support the democrats . In a night attack , the Spartans and exiles succeeded in seizing Lechaeum , Corinth 's port on the Gulf of Corinth , and defeated the army that came out to challenge them the next day . The anti @-@ Spartan allies then attempted to invest Lechaeum , but the Spartans launched an attack and drove them off . 
 = = = Peace conferences break down = = = 
 In 392 BC , the Spartans dispatched an ambassador , Antalcidas , to the satrap Tiribazus , hoping to turn the Persians against the allies by informing them of Conon 's use of the Persian fleet to begin rebuilding the Athenian empire . The Athenians learned of this , and sent Conon and several others to present their case to the Persians ; they also notified their allies , and Argos , Corinth , and Thebes dispatched embassies to Tiribazus . At the conference that resulted , the Spartans proposed a peace based on the independence of all states ; this was rejected by the allies , as Athens wished to hold the gains it had made in the Aegean , Thebes wished to keep its control over the Boeotian league , and Argos already had designs on assimilating Corinth into its state . The conference thus failed , but Tiribazus , alarmed by Conon 's actions , arrested him , and secretly provided the Spartans with money to equip a fleet . Although Conon quickly escaped , he died soon afterward . A second peace conference was held at Sparta in the same year , but the proposals made there were again rejected by the allies , both because of the implications of the autonomy principle and because the Athenians were outraged that the terms proposed would have involved abandoning the Ionian Greeks to Persia . 
 In the wake of the unsuccessful conference in Persia , Tiribazus returned to Susa to report on events , and a new general , Struthas , was sent out to take command . Struthas pursued an anti @-@ Spartan policy , prompting the Spartans to order their commander in the region , Thibron , to attack him . Thibron successfully ravaged Persian territory for a time , but was killed along with a number of his men when Struthas ambushed one of his poorly organized raiding parties . Thibron was later replaced by <unk> , who raided more successfully , securing a number of small successes and even capturing Struthas 's son @-@ in @-@ law , but never achieved any dramatic results . 
 = = = Lechaeum and the seizure of Corinth = = = 
 At Corinth , the democratic party continued to hold the city proper , while the exiles and their Spartan supporters held Lechaeum , from where they raided the Corinthian countryside . In 391 BC , Agesilaus campaigned in the area , successfully seizing several fortified points , along with a large amount of prisoners and booty . While Agesilaus was in camp preparing to sell off his spoils , the Athenian general Iphicrates , with a force composed almost entirely of light troops and peltasts ( javelin throwers ) , won a decisive victory against the Spartan regiment that had been stationed at Lechaeum in the Battle of Lechaeum . During the battle , Iphicrates took advantage of the Spartans ' lack of peltasts to repeatedly harass the regiment with hit @-@ and @-@ run attacks , wearing the Spartans down until they broke and ran , at which point a number of them were slaughtered . Agesilaus returned home shortly after these events , but Iphicrates continued to campaign around Corinth , recapturing many of the strong points which the Spartans had previously taken , although he was unable to retake Lechaeum . He also campaigned against Phlius and Arcadia , decisively defeating the <unk> and plundering the territory of the Arcadians when they refused to engage his troops . 
 After this victory , an Argive army came to Corinth , and , seizing the acropolis , effected the merger of Argos and Corinth . The border stones between Argos and Corinth were torn down , and the citizen bodies of the two cities were merged . 
 = = = Later land campaigns = = = 
 After Iphicrates 's victories near Corinth , no more major land campaigns were conducted in that region . Campaigning continued in the Peloponnese and the northwest . Agesilaus had campaigned successfully in Argive territory in 391 BC , and he launched two more major expeditions before the end of the war . In the first of these , in 389 BC , a Spartan expeditionary force crossed the Gulf of Corinth to attack Acarnania , an ally of the anti @-@ Spartan coalition . After initial difficulties in coming to grips with the Acarnanians , who kept to the mountains and avoided engaging him directly , Agesilaus was eventually able to draw them into a pitched battle , in which the Acarnanians were routed and lost a number of men . He then sailed home across the Gulf . The next year , the Acarnanians made peace with the Spartans to avoid further invasions . 
 In 388 BC , Agesipolis led a Spartan army against Argos . Since no Argive army challenged him , he plundered the countryside for a time , and then , after receiving several unfavorable omens , returned home . 
 = = = Later campaigns in the Aegean = = = 
 After their defeat at Cnidus , the Spartans began to rebuild a fleet , and , in fighting with Corinth , had regained control of the Gulf of Corinth by 392 BC . Following the failure of the peace conferences of 392 BC , the Spartans sent a small fleet , under the commander <unk> , to the Aegean with orders to assist oligarchs exiled from Rhodes . <unk> arrived at Rhodes to find the democrats fully in control , and in possession of more ships than him , and thus waited at Cnidus . The Spartans then dispatched their fleet from the Gulf of Corinth , under Teleutias , to assist . After picking up more ships at Samos , Teleutias took command at Cnidus and commenced operations against Rhodes . 
 Alarmed by this Spartan naval resurgence , the Athenians sent out a fleet of 40 triremes under Thrasybulus . He , judging that he could accomplish more by campaigning where the Spartan fleet was not than by challenging it directly , sailed to the Hellespont . Once there , he won over several major states to the Athenian side and placed a duty on ships sailing past Byzantium , restoring a source of revenue that the Athenians had relied on in the late Peloponnesian War . He then sailed to Lesbos , where , with the support of the <unk> , he defeated the Spartan forces on the island and won over a number of cities . While still on Lesbos , however , Thrasybulus was killed by raiders from the city of Aspendus . 
 After this , the Spartans sent out a new commander , Anaxibius , to Abydos . For a time , he enjoyed a number of successes against Pharnabazus , and seized a number of Athenian merchant ships . Worried that Thrasybulus 's accomplishments were being undermined , the Athenians sent Iphicrates to the region to confront Anaxibius . For a time , the two forces merely raided each other 's territory , but eventually Iphicrates succeeded in guessing where Anaxibius would bring his troops on a return march from a campaign against <unk> , and ambushed the Spartan force . When Anaxibius and his men , who were strung out in the line of march , had entered the rough , mountainous terrain in which Iphicrates and his men were waiting , the Athenians emerged and ambushed them , killing Anaxibius and many others . 
 = = = Aegina and Piraeus = = = 
 In 389 BC , the Athenians attacked the island of Aegina , off the coast of Attica . The Spartans soon drove off the Athenian fleet , but the Athenians continued their land assault . Under Antalcidas ' command , the Spartan fleet sailed east to Rhodes but it was eventually blockaded at Abydos by the regional Athenian commanders . The Athenians on Aegina , meanwhile , soon found themselves under attack , and withdrew after several months . 
 Shortly thereafter , the Spartan fleet under Gorgopas ambushed the Athenian fleet near Athens , capturing several ships . The Athenians responded with an ambush of their own ; Chabrias , on his way to Cyprus , landed his troops on Aegina and laid an ambush for the Aeginetans and their Spartan allies , killing a number of them including Gorgopas . 
 The Spartans then sent Teleutias to Aegina to command the fleet there . Noticing that the Athenians had relaxed their guard after Chabrias 's victory , he launched a raid on Piraeus , seizing numerous merchant ships . 
 = = Peace of Antalcidas ( 387 BC ) = = 
 Antalcidas , meanwhile , had entered into negotiations with Tiribazus , and reached an agreement under which the Persians would enter into the war on the Spartan side if the allies refused to make peace . It appears that the Persians , unnerved by certain of Athens ' actions , including supporting king Evagoras of Cyprus and <unk> of Egypt , both of whom were at war with Persia , had decided that their policy of weakening Sparta by supporting its enemies was no longer useful . After escaping from the blockade at Abydos , Antalcidas attacked and defeated a small Athenian force , then united his fleet with a supporting fleet sent from Syracuse . With this force , which was soon further augmented with ships supplied by the satraps of the region , he sailed to the Hellespont , where he could cut off the trade routes that brought grain to Athens . The Athenians , mindful of their similar defeat in the Peloponnesian War less than two decades before , were ready to make peace . 
 In this climate , when Tiribazus called a peace conference in late 387 BC , the major parties of the war were ready to discuss terms . The basic outline of the treaty was laid out by a decree from the Persian king Artaxerxes : 
 King Artaxerxes thinks it just that the cities in Asia should belong to him , as well as Clazomenae and Cyprus among the islands , and that the other Greek cities , both small and great , should be left independent , except Lemnos , Imbros , and <unk> ; and these should belong , as of old , to the Athenians . But whichever of the two parties does not accept this peace , upon them I will make war , in company with those who desire this arrangement , both by land and by sea , with ships and with money . 
 In a general peace conference at Sparta , the Spartans , with their authority enhanced by the threat of Persian intervention , secured the acquiescence of all the major states of Greece to these terms . The agreement eventually produced was commonly known as the King 's Peace , reflecting the Persian influence the treaty showed . This treaty marked the first attempt at a Common Peace in Greek history ; under the treaty , all cities were to be independent , a clause that would be enforced by the Spartans as guardians of the peace . Under threat of Spartan intervention , Thebes disbanded its league , and Argos and Corinth ended their experiment in shared government ; Corinth , deprived of its strong ally , was incorporated back into Sparta 's Peloponnesian League . After 8 years of fighting , the Corinthian war was at an end . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 In the years following the signing of the peace , the two states responsible for its structure , Persia and Sparta , took full advantage of the gains they had made . Persia , freed of both Athenian and Spartan interference in its Asian provinces , consolidated its hold over the eastern Aegean and captured both Egypt and Cyprus by 380 BC . Sparta , meanwhile , in its newly formalized position atop the Greek political system , took advantage of the autonomy clause of the peace to break up any coalition that it perceived as a threat . Disloyal allies were sharply punished — Mantinea , for instance , was broken up into five component villages . With Agesilaus at the head of the state , advocating for an aggressive policy , the Spartans campaigned from the Peloponnese to the distant <unk> peninsula . Their dominance over mainland Greece would last another sixteen years before being shattered at Leuctra . 
 The war also marked the beginning of Athens ' resurgence as a power in the Greek world . With their walls and their fleet restored , the Athenians were in position to turn their eyes overseas . By the middle of the 4th century , they had assembled an organization of Aegean states commonly known as the Second Athenian Empire , regaining at least parts of what they had lost with their defeat in 404 BC . 
 The freedom of the Ionian Greeks had been a rallying cry since the beginning of the 5th century , but after the Corinthian War , the mainland states made no further attempts to interfere with Persia 's control of the region . After over a century of disruption and struggle , Persia at last ruled Ionia without disruption or intervention for over 50 years , until the time of Alexander the Great .

 = Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin , BWV 125 = 
 Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin ( With peace and joy I depart ) , BWV 125 , is a church cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach . He composed the chorale cantata in Leipzig in 1725 for the Feast of the purification of Mary and first performed it on 2 February 1725 . The text is based on the hymn " Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin " in four stanzas by Martin Luther , published in 1524 . The gospel for the feast day , the presentation of Jesus at the Temple , includes Simeon 's canticle Nunc dimittis , which Luther paraphrased in his hymn . 
 An unknown librettist retained the first and the last of Luther 's four stanzas . He paraphrased the second stanza in an aria , then juxtaposed it , quoting it completely , by recitative , and derived two more movements from the third stanza . Bach structured the cantata in six movements , framing four movements for soloists by a chorale fantasia and a closing chorale . He scored it for three vocal soloists , a four @-@ part choir , and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of a horn to support the chorale tune , flauto traverso , oboe , oboe d 'amore , strings and basso continuo . The opening chorus , a chorale fantasia on the hymn tune in Phrygian mode has been compared to the opening movement of Bach 's St Matthew Passion : " death , sleep , a journey of departure , peace and consolation are some of the intertwined themes and images . " 
 = = History and words = = 
 Bach wrote the chorale cantata in his second year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig for the Feast of Purification , as part of his second annual cantata cycle , planned to consist of chorale cantatas . The prescribed readings for the feast day , which is always celebrated on 2 February , were from the book of Malachi , " the Lord will come to his temple " ( Malachi 3 : 1 – 4 ) , and from the Gospel of Luke , the purification of Mary and the presentation of Jesus at the Temple , including Simeon 's canticle Nunc dimittis ( Luke 2 : 22 – 32 ) . 
 Luther 's hymn in four stanzas is a paraphrase of this canticle , " With peace and joy I depart in God 's will " . Luther phrased each verse of the canticle in one stanza . An unknown librettist kept the first and the last stanza and paraphrased the inner stanzas in four movements . Movement 2 takes Luther 's second stanza as a starting point and relates Simeon 's view as an example on how to look at death . Movement 3 comments the complete text of Luther 's second stanza in recitative . The allusion to " light for the heathen " from the Gospel and the hymn is seen related to " He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved " ( Mark 16 : 16 ) . Movements 4 and 5 are derived from the third stanza , 4 relates to Paul 's teaching about God 's grace , " Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood , to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past , through the forbearance of God " ( Romans 3 : 25 ) , thus declaring the Lutheran teaching of justification " by grace alone through faith alone because of Christ alone " even more clearly than Luther 's song . 
 Bach led the first performance of the cantata on 2 February 1725 . He performed it at least one more time after 1735 . 
 = = Structure and scoring = = 
 Bach structured the cantata in six movements , framing by a chorale fantasia and a closing chorale a sequence of alternating arias and recitatives , in movement 3 using a chorale stanza in contrast to the recitative . He scored it for three vocal soloists ( alto ( A ) , tenor ( T ) and bass ( B ) ) , a four @-@ part choir , and a Baroque instrumental ensemble horn to support the chorale tune sung by the soprano in the outer movements , flauto traverso ( Ft ) , oboe ( Ob ) , oboe d 'amore ( Oa ) , two violins ( Vl ) , viola ( Va ) , and basso continuo ( Bc ) . The title page of the original parts reads : " Festo <unk> : Mari [ ae ] / Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin etc . / â / 4 Voc : / Travers : / Hautbois d ' Amour / 2 Violini / Viola / con / Continuo / di / Sign : / JS .

 The opening chorus , " Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin in Gottes Willen " ( With peace and joy I depart in God 's will ) , begins with a concertante ritornello , in which the flute and the oboe play opposed to the strings . A motif in triplets rises a fifth , related to the first interval of the chorale tune . The soprano sings the cantus firmus in Phrygian mode in long notes . The lower voices participate in the instrumental motifs for lines 1 , 2 , 3 and 5 , but lines 4 and 6 are treated differently . In accordance to the text , " <unk> und <unk> " ( calm and quiet ) and " der Tod ist mein Schlaf <unk> " ( death has become my sleep ) , they are performed softly ( piano ) , in homophony , chromatic , and modulating to distant keys . The musicologist Julian Mincham relates the opening movement to that of Bach 's later St Matthew Passion . It is similar in its motifs in triplets , density of counterpoint , and is in the same key of E minor , shared by the Crucifixus of his Mass in B minor which he derived from the 1714 Weinen , Klagen , Sorgen , Zagen , BWV 12 ( Weeping , lamenting , worrying , fearing ) . Mincham concludes : " death , sleep , a journey of departure , peace and consolation are some of the intertwined themes and images . Bach is always at his most creative and imaginative when dealing with such complexities " .

 = Carménère = 
 The Carménère grape is a wine grape variety originally planted in the Médoc region of Bordeaux , France , where it was used to produce deep red wines and occasionally used for blending purposes in the same manner as Petit Verdot . 
 A member of the Cabernet family of grapes , the name " Carménère " originates from the French word for crimson ( <unk> ) which refers to the brilliant crimson colour of the autumn foliage prior to leaf @-@ fall . The grape is also known as Grande Vidure , a historic Bordeaux synonym , although current European Union regulations prohibit Chilean imports under this name into the European Union . Along with Cabernet Sauvignon , Cabernet Franc , Merlot , Malbec and Petit Verdot , Carménère is considered part of the original six red grapes of Bordeaux , France . 
 Now rarely found in France , the world 's largest area planted with this variety is in Chile in South America , with more than 8 @,@ 800 hectares ( 2009 ) cultivated in the Central Valley . As such , Chile produces the vast majority of Carménère wines available today and as the Chilean wine industry grows , more experimentation is being carried out on Carménère 's potential as a blending grape , especially with Cabernet Sauvignon . 
 Carménère is also grown in Italy 's Eastern Veneto and Friuli @-@ Venezia Giulia regions and in smaller quantities in California , USA and Walla Walla region of Washington United States . 
 = = History = = 
 One of the most ancient European varieties , Carménère is thought to be the antecedent of other better @-@ known varieties ; some consider the grape to be " a long @-@ established clone of Cabernet Sauvignon . " It is possible that the variety name is an alias for what is actually the Vidure , a local Bordeaux name for a Cabernet Sauvignon clone once thought to be the grape from which all red Bordeaux varieties originated . 
 There have also been suggestions that Carménère may be Biturica , a vine praised in ancient Rome and also the name by which the city of Bordeaux was known during that era . This ancient variety originated in Iberia ( modern @-@ day Spain and Portugal ) , according to Pliny the Elder ; indeed , it is currently a popular blending variety with Sangiovese in Tuscany called " <unk> di Biturica " 
 The Carménère grape has known origins in the Médoc region of Bordeaux , France and was also widely planted in the Graves until the vines were struck with <unk> . It is almost impossible to find Carménère wines in France today , as a Phylloxera plague in 1867 nearly destroyed all the vineyards of Europe , afflicting the Carménère grapevines in particular such that for many years the grape was presumed extinct . When the vineyards were replanted , growers could not replant Carménère as it was extremely hard to find and more difficult to grow than other grape varieties common to Bordeaux . The region 's damp , chilly spring weather gave rise to <unk> , " a condition endemic to certain vines in climates which have marginal , sometimes cool , wet springs " , which prevented the vine 's buds from flowering . Yields were lower than other varieties and the crops were rarely healthy ; consequently wine growers chose more versatile and less <unk> @-@ susceptible grapes when replanting the vines and Carménère planting was progressively abandoned . 
 = = = Rediscovery = = = 
 = = = = Chile = = = = 
 Far from being extinct , in recent years the Carménère grape has been discovered to be thriving in several areas outside France . In Chile , growers almost inadvertently preserved the grape variety during the last 150 years , due largely to its similarity to Merlot . 
 Cuttings of Carménère were imported by Chilean growers from Bordeaux during the 19th century , where they were frequently confused with Merlot vines . They modeled their wineries after those in France and in the 1850s cuttings from Bordeaux , which included Carménère grape , were planted in the valleys around Santiago . Thanks to central Chile 's minimal rainfall during the growing season and the protection of the country 's natural boundaries , growers produced healthier crops of Carménère and there was no spread of phylloxera . During most of the 20th century Carménère was inadvertently collected and processed together with Merlot grapes ( probably reaching up to 50 % of the total volume ) giving Chilean Merlot markedly different properties to those of Merlot produced elsewhere . Chilean growers believed that this grape was a clone of Merlot and was known as Merlot selection or Merlot <unk> ( after the Peumo Valley in Chile ) . In 1994 , a researcher at Montpellier 's school of <unk> found that " an earlier @-@ ripening vine was Bordeaux Carménère , not Merlot " . The Chilean Department of Agriculture officially recognized Carménère as a distinct variety in 1998 . Today , Carménère grows chiefly in the Colchagua Valley , <unk> Valley , and Maipo Province . 
 = = = = Italy = = = = 
 A similar situation occurred in Italy when , in 1990 , the Ca ' del Bosco Winery acquired what they thought was Cabernet Franc vines from a French nursery . The growers noticed that the grapes were different from the traditional Cabernet Franc both in color and taste . They also noticed that the vines ripened earlier than Cabernet Franc would have . Other Italian wine regions also started to doubt the origin of these vines and it was finally established to be Carménère . Although , in Italy , the variety is grown mainly in the northeast part of the country from Brescia to Friuli , it has only recently been entered into Italy 's national catalog of vine varieties and thus " no district has yet requested the authorization to use it " . Therefore , the wine " cannot be cultivated with its original name or specific vintage and the name cannot be used to identify the wine on the label with an IGT , DOC or a <unk> status assignment . " Ca ' del Bosco Winery names the wine it produces <unk> . In 2007 the grape was authorised to be used in Italian DOC wines from Veneto ( Arcole , Bagnoli di Sopra , Cori <unk> del <unk> , Garda , <unk> , Monti <unk> , Riviera del <unk> and Vicenza ) , Friuli @-@ Venezia Giulia ( Collio , or Collio <unk> ) and Sardinia ( <unk> ) . Since a ministerial decree of 2009 , producers of Piave DOC wines in 50 communes of the Province of Treviso , and 12 in the Province of Venice have been permitted where appropriate to specify the variety <unk> on the wine label . 
 = = = = Other regions = = = = 
 In modern @-@ day France only a few hundred acres of Carménère officially exist , although there are rumors of renewed interest among growers in Bordeaux . 
 Carménère has also been established in Eastern Washington 's Walla Walla Valley and in California , United States . In the 1980s , Karen <unk> @-@ Magoon , the co @-@ proprietor of <unk> and Langtry Estates Winery , in California 's Lake County , brought the grape to the vineyard . This was a joint effort with Louis Pierre <unk> , " a French research scientist and <unk> whose work involved preserving Carménère from extinction in France . " Once the vines were quarantined and checked for diseases they were legalized for admission into California in the 1990s , where they were cloned and planted . 
 In Australia , three cuttings of Carménère were imported from Chile by renowned viticultural expert Dr Richard Smart in the late 1990s . After two years in quarantine , only one cutting survived the heat treatment to eliminate viruses and was micro @-@ propagated ( segments of individual buds grown on nutrient gel ) and field grown by Narromine Vine Nursery . The first vines from the nursery were planted in 2002 by <unk> Vineyard and Winery in the <unk> Valley ( Geelong , Victoria ) who use Carménère in their Angels ' Share blend . 
 Carménère has also been established in small amounts in New Zealand . DNA testing confirmed in 2006 that plantings of Cabernet Franc in the <unk> region were in fact Carménère . 
 = = Viticulture = = 
 Carménère favors a long growing season in moderate to warm climates . During harvest time and the winter period the vine fares poorly if it is introduced to high levels of rain or irrigation water . This is particularly true in poor @-@ soil plantings where the vine would need more water . Over @-@ watering during this period accentuates the herbaceous and green pepper characteristics of the grape . The grape naturally develops high levels of sugar before the tannins achieve ripeness . If grown in too hot a climate the resulting wine will have a high alcohol level and low balance . Carménère buds and flowers three to seven days later than Merlot and the yield is lower than that of the latter grape . The Carménère leaves turn to crimson before dropping . 
 Carménère is produced in wineries either as a single @-@ variety wine ( sometimes called a varietal wine ) , or as a blend usually with Cabernet Sauvignon , Cabernet franc and / or Merlot . 
 = = Distinction from Merlot = = 
 Genetic research has shown that Carménère may be distantly related to Merlot and the similarities in appearance have linked the two vines for centuries . Despite the similarities , there are some noticeable differences that aid the <unk> in identifying the two vines . When young , Carménère leaves have a reddish hue underneath , while the leaves of Merlot are white . There are also slight differences in leaf shape with the central lobe of Merlot leaves being longer . Merlot ripens two to three weeks earlier than Carménère . In cases where the vineyards are interspersed with both varieties , the time of harvest is paramount in determining the character of the resulting blends . If Merlot grapes are picked when Carménère is fully ripe , they will be overripe and impart a " jammy " character . If the grapes are picked earlier when only the Merlot grapes have reached ripeness , the Carménère will have an aggressive green pepper flavor . 
 Thus , although different , Merlot and Carménère were often confused but never thought to be identical . Its distinctive differences meant the grape was called a " Merlot selection " or " Merlot <unk> , " which was " a geographic reference to a valley south of Santiago where lots of Carménère was grown " before its true identity was established . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Carménère wine has a deep red color and aromas found in red fruits , spices and berries . The tannins are gentler and softer than those in Cabernet Sauvignon and it is a medium body wine . Although mostly used as a blending grape , wineries do bottle a pure varietal Carménère which , when produced from grapes at optimal ripeness , imparts a cherry @-@ like , fruity flavor with smoky , spicy and earthy notes and a deep crimson color . Its taste might also be reminiscent of dark chocolate , tobacco , and leather . The wine is best to drink while it is young .
