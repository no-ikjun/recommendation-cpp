 = Interstate 80 in Utah = 
 Interstate 80 ( I @-@ 80 ) is a part of the Interstate Highway System that runs from San Francisco , California , to Teaneck , New Jersey . The portion of the highway in the U.S. state of Utah is 196 @.@ 35 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 315 @.@ 99 km ) , through the northern part of the state . From west to east , I @-@ 80 crosses the state line from Nevada in Tooele County and traverses the Bonneville Salt Flats — which are a part of the larger Great Salt Lake Desert . It continues alongside the Wendover Cut @-@ off — the corridor of the former Victory Highway — U.S. Route 40 ( US @-@ 40 ) and the Western Pacific Railroad Feather River Route . After passing the Oquirrh Mountains , I @-@ 80 enters the Salt Lake Valley and Salt Lake County . A short portion of the freeway is concurrent with I @-@ 15 through Downtown Salt Lake City . At the Spaghetti Bowl , I @-@ 80 turns east again into the mouth of Parley 's Canyon and Summit County , travels through the mountain range and intersects the eastern end of I @-@ 84 near Echo Reservoir before turning northwest towards the Wyoming border near Evanston . I @-@ 80 was built along the corridor of the Lincoln Highway and the Mormon Trail through the Wasatch Range . The easternmost section also follows the historical routes of the First Transcontinental Railroad and US @-@ 30S . 
 Construction of the controlled @-@ access highway began in the 1950s , and by the late 1970s most of the freeway across the state of Utah had been completed . The four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ mile @-@ long ( 7 @.@ 2 km ) section of I @-@ 80 between Utah State Route 68 ( SR @-@ 68 , Redwood Road ) and the Salt Lake City International Airport was the last piece of the nearly 2 @,@ 900 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 4 @,@ 700 km ) freeway to be completed . It was opened on August 22 , 1986 , and was about 50 miles ( 80 km ) from the site of another cross @-@ country milestone in Utah , the driving of the Golden Spike of the First Transcontinental Railroad at Promontory Summit . Average daily traffic volumes in 2012 ranged between 6 @,@ 765 vehicles using the freeway at SR @-@ 58 and 121 @,@ 205 vehicles using the freeway at the Spaghetti Bowl in Downtown Salt Lake City . Throughout the state , the highway is also known as the Purple Heart Trail . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Out of the eleven states which I @-@ 80 passes through , the 196 @.@ 34 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 315 @.@ 98 km ) segment in Utah is the fourth shortest . The longest stretch of I @-@ 80 in a single state is the 455 @.@ 32 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 732 @.@ 77 km ) segment in Nebraska . As part of the Interstate Highway System , the entire route is listed on the National Highway System , a system of roads that are important to the nation 's economy , defense , and mobility . 
 Every year , the Utah Department of Transportation ( UDOT ) conducts a series of surveys on its highways to measure traffic volumes . This measure is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year . In 2012 , UDOT calculated that as few as 6 @,@ 765 vehicles traveled I @-@ 80 at the interchange with SR @-@ 58 in Wendover , and as many as 121 @,@ 205 vehicles used the highway at the Spaghetti Bowl in downtown Salt Lake City . Between seven and 58 percent of the traffic recorded consisted of trucks . These counts are for the portion of the freeway in Utah .

 The freeway enters Utah from Nevada in the city of Wendover on the edge of the Bonneville Salt Flats . The cities of West Wendover , Nevada and Wendover are accessible by I @-@ 80 's only business loop in Utah , whose interchange is just south of Danger Cave . The highway closely follows the historical routes of the Wendover Cutoff , the Victory Highway , and of the ex @-@ Western Pacific Railroad 's Feather River Route ( now part of the Union Pacific Railroad Central Corridor ) across the salt flats and the larger Great Salt Lake Desert . Bonneville Speedway , home to many land speed records , is accessible from I @-@ 80 . In the middle of the salt flats is a concrete sculpture , Metaphor : The Tree of Utah , which stands just off the westbound carriageway of I @-@ 80 , 30 mi ( 48 km ) east of Wendover . 
 Bounded on each sides by military training grounds , the I @-@ 80 corridor is overflown by commercial airliners traveling west from Salt Lake City International Airport . The freeway veers north around the Cedar Mountains in a small gap between them and the Lakeside Mountains . Further east , the highway passes the Stansbury Mountains , which are located in the Wasatch @-@ Cache National Forest . After the mountain ranges , the freeway arrives at the southern shore of the Great Salt Lake and closely follows the shore towards the western suburbs of Salt Lake City . However , the historical routes from which the route of I @-@ 80 was derived were routed further from the lake , passing through the towns of Grantsville and Tooele before crossing a bottleneck between the Oquirrh Mountains and Stansbury Island in the Great Salt Lake . These communities are now served by SR @-@ 138 and SR @-@ 36 respectively . 
 = = = Salt Lake County = = = 
 While traversing the neck , views can be had from I @-@ 80 of the Lake and Antelope Island . After passing the neck , the road forks , with I @-@ 80 proceeding towards the north end of Salt Lake City and SR @-@ 201 proceeding towards the south end . Historically , this intersection was the separation of US @-@ 40 and US @-@ 50 . After the intersection , the freeway corridor is again bottlenecked with the Great Salt Lake to the north and the Kennecott Copper smelter and tailings pond to the south . The Kennecott 's Bingham Canyon Mine , which was once considered to be the largest open @-@ pit copper mine , can be seen in the distance . The 1 @,@ 215 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 370 m ) Kennecott Smokestack is one of the tallest freestanding structures in the United States . Along this portion , the freeway passes the historical site of the Saltair Resort . 
 The freeway enters the Salt Lake Valley on the former alignment of North Temple Street until it passes the Salt Lake City International Airport , where the freeway veers slightly south and leaves the North Temple Street corridor which leads to Temple Square in downtown Salt Lake City . The Green Line of the Utah Transit Authority ( UTA ) TRAX system briefly parallels I @-@ 80 before traveling down the center of North Temple Street . I @-@ 80 becomes concurrent with I @-@ 15 after interchanges with SR @-@ 58 and 600 South and continues south for about three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) , passing along the western and southern edges of downtown Salt Lake City . The southern interchange with I @-@ 15 , which also includes SR @-@ 201 ( 21st South Freeway ) and marks the end of the concurrency , is known as the Spaghetti Bowl , . In the southwestern corner of the Spaghetti Bowl is another portion of the UTA TRAX Green Line as it travels towards West Valley City . After separating from I @-@ 15 , the freeway continues easterly through South Salt Lake , loosely following an alignment just south of 2100 South and the UTA S Line streetcar through the Sugar House neighborhood and past Sugar House Park — once the home of the Sugar House Prison towards the clockwise terminus of the I @-@ 215 270 ° belt route around Salt Lake . It continues through Parley 's Canyon , where the freeway joins the historical route of the Lincoln Highway . Between the mouth of the canyon and the Summit county line , the route re @-@ enters the Wasatch National Forest . 
 = = = Summit County = = = 
 Parley 's Canyon carries I @-@ 80 up the western slope of the Wasatch Front as a six @-@ lane freeway , cresting the mountains at an elevation of 7 @,@ 028 feet ( 2 @,@ 142 m ) at Parley 's Summit . Both the canyon and summit were named for Parley P. Pratt , an early settler to the Salt Lake Valley and an early Mormon leader who was asked to survey a new route across the mountains to replace the route through Emigration Canyon . Between 1848 and 1851 , Pratt surveyed , completed , and operated the Golden Pass toll road through the canyon that today bears his name . Pratt had unsuccessfully solicited for $ 800 ( equivalent to $ 399 thousand in 2015 ) to build the road , and sold it for $ 1 @,@ 500 ( equivalent to $ 740 thousand in 2015 ) . On and off ramps for the Wyoming port @-@ of @-@ entry are located just within Utah . In January 2014 , UDOT introduced variable speed limits to I @-@ 80 in Parley 's Canyon , allowing a speed limit between 35 mph ( 56 km / h ) up to the normal 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) depending on weather or traffic conditions . 
 Beyond Parley 's summit lies Park City , a mining town today better known for its many ski resorts . The Historic Union Pacific Rail Trail State Park travels in the median between carriageways of I @-@ 80 before paralleling the highway until the southern end of Echo Reservoir . The freeway turns north upon reaching the Rockport Reservoir at <unk> following the tributaries of the Weber River toward Echo Reservoir and dam . Upon reaching Echo Canyon and the junction with the eastern terminus of the western section of I @-@ 84 , the freeway follows the canyon east until it reaches the Wyoming state line near Evanston . I @-@ 80 forms the northeastern border between Rich and Summit Counties . 
 The portion through Echo Canyon follows the historical routes of the Mormon Trail , US @-@ 30S , and the First Transcontinental Railroad . A rest area in the canyon just east of the junction with I @-@ 84 features signs pointing out features that were obstacles for both the Mormon pioneers and the railroad construction workers , including Pulpit Rock , which was partially demolished when the I @-@ 80 was built through the canyon .

 I @-@ 80 follows the routes of two major auto trails through the state . In western Utah , I @-@ 80 follows the historical route of the Victory Highway from Wendover at the Nevada state line to the junction of US @-@ 40 near Park City . Throughout Utah , I @-@ 80 is signed as the modern route of the Lincoln Highway — except through Salt Lake City , where the Lincoln Highway is routed along State Route 201 and Parley 's Way . The route of the Lincoln Highway across Utah was generally derived from the route of the Pony Express and the Central Overland Route . However , much of the original route of the Lincoln Highway west of Salt Lake City is inaccessible . The original route of the Lincoln Highway proceeded southwest from Tooele towards Ely , Nevada . This area is now used for military bases , such as the Dugway Proving Ground and Tooele Army Depot . The area was closed to the public when these bases were established . I @-@ 80 and US @-@ 93 are the modern signing of the Lincoln Highway between those two cities . East of Salt Lake City , I @-@ 80 closely parallels the original route of the Lincoln Highway . 
 In 1926 , much of the route covered by I @-@ 80 , including Pratt 's former toll road from the Nevada state line into Salt Lake City , was signed as US @-@ 40 then as US @-@ 30 to the Wyoming state line . It was also part of the Victory Highway west of Salt Lake and the Lincoln Highway east of Salt Lake at this time . Most of the route had been improved but some stretches of graded road remained . In 1937 , parts of the route near <unk> were numbered US @-@ 530 . In 1950 , the highway near Echo was designated US @-@ 30S and US @-@ 189 . By 1959 , US @-@ 50 Alternate was also routed along the western portion of I @-@ 80 .

 The first Utah State Route to have the number 80 is now known as SR @-@ 92 , which was originally numbered SR @-@ 80 until the 1977 renumbering of Utah State highways . Previously , the freeway 's legislative designation was SR @-@ 2 . 
 Passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 formed the Interstate Highway System , and the I @-@ 80 number was first designated to a then @-@ unconstructed controlled @-@ access highway across the state by 1957 . I @-@ 80 was constructed in segments , starting in the late 1950s . By the late 1970s , the Utah portion of I @-@ 80 — except for a gap on the western edge of Salt Lake City — was largely complete . A four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ mile @-@ long ( 7 @.@ 2 km ) section between Redwood Road and Salt Lake City International Airport holds the distinction of being the final link of the transcontinental freeway to be completed . As an Interstate Highway , design specifications require a controlled @-@ access highway with no at @-@ grade intersections . This section was dedicated on August 22 , 1986 , and was the last to be completed to Interstate Highway specifications along the almost 2 @,@ 900 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 4 @,@ 700 km ) route of I @-@ 80 between San Francisco , California and Teaneck , New Jersey . The section was completed close to the thirtieth anniversary of the Interstate Highway System , which was noted at the dedication and considered to be a milestone in the history of highway construction in the United States . It was also noted at the dedication that this was only 50 miles ( 80 km ) south of Promontory Summit , where the golden spike of the United States First Transcontinental Railroad was laid . 
 The original designation of I @-@ 84 , which begins at an interchange with I @-@ 80 in Echo , was I @-@ 80N . This designation was changed to I @-@ 84 in 1977 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials despite objections from the Washington State Department of Transportation and the Idaho Transportation Department , and with the support of UDOT and the Oregon Department of Transportation . The legislative designation for this highway was SR @-@ 3 until the 1977 renumbering . 
 Rebuilding of the first portions of I @-@ 80 began in October 1990 with a one @-@ point @-@ four @-@ mile @-@ long ( 2 @.@ 3 km ) stretch near Redwood Road in Salt Lake City . By 1991 , UDOT estimated that the reconstruction of all federally funded highways in the state would cost up to $ 4 @.@ 3 billion ( equivalent to $ 9 @.@ 85 billion in 2015 ) . The Spaghetti Bowl interchange was first proposed in 1996 to accommodate traffic for the 2002 Winter Olympics being held in the city . Most of the Spaghetti Bowl was open by November 2000 ; the remainder opened in early 2001 . In 2002 , the Utah State Legislature named the highway the Purple Heart trail , in honor of wounded war veterans . Additional reconstruction work — which involved replacing most of the bridges along the route , resurfacing and installation of sound barriers — was done on I @-@ 80 between the Spaghetti Bowl and Parley 's Canyon in 2007 and 2008 .

 Calais ( / <unk> / CAL @-@ ay , traditionally / <unk> / ; French pronunciation : ​ [ <unk> ] ; Picard : <unk> ; Dutch : <unk> ) is a town and major ferry port in northern France in the department of Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais , of which it is a sub @-@ prefecture . Although Calais is by far the largest city in Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais , the department 's prefecture is its third @-@ largest city of Arras . The population of the metropolitan area at the 2010 census was 126 @,@ 395 . Calais overlooks the Strait of Dover , the narrowest point in the English Channel , which is only 34 km ( 21 mi ) wide here , and is the closest French town to England . The White Cliffs of Dover can easily be seen on a clear day from Calais . Calais is a major port for ferries between France and England , and since 1994 , the Channel Tunnel has linked nearby Coquelles to Folkestone by rail . 
 Due to its position , Calais since the Middle Ages has been a major port and a very important centre for transport and trading with England . It was annexed by Edward III of England in 1347 and grew into a thriving centre for wool production . The town came to be called the " brightest jewel in the English crown " owing to its great importance as the gateway for the tin , lead , lace and wool trades ( or " staples " ) . Calais was a territorial possession of England until its capture by France in 1558 . In 1805 it was a staging area for Napoleon 's troops for several months during his planned invasion of the United Kingdom . The town was virtually razed to the ground during World War II , when in May 1940 , it was a strategic bombing target of the invading German forces who took the town during the Siege of Calais . During World War II , the Germans built massive bunkers along the coast in preparation for launching missiles on England . 
 The old part of the town , Calais proper ( known as Calais @-@ Nord ) , is situated on an artificial island surrounded by canals and harbours . The modern part of the town , St @-@ Pierre , lies to the south and south @-@ east . In the centre of the old town is the Place d 'Armes , in which stands the Tour du Guet , or watch @-@ tower , a structure built in the 13th century , which was used as a lighthouse until 1848 when a new lighthouse was built by the port . South east of the Place is the church of Notre @-@ Dame , built during the English occupancy of Calais . It is arguably the only church built in the English perpendicular style in all of France . In this church former French President Charles de Gaulle married his wife Yvonne <unk> . South of the Place and opposite the Parc St Pierre is the Hôtel @-@ de @-@ ville ( the town hall ) , and the belfry from the 16th and early 17th centuries . Today , Calais is visited by more than 10 million annually . Aside from being a key transport hub , Calais is also a notable fishing port and a centre for fish marketing , and some 3 @,@ 000 people are still employed in the lace industry for which the town is also famed .

 = = = Early history = = = 
 Although the early history of habitation in the area is limited , the Romans called the settlement <unk> . Julius Caesar mustered 800 to 1 @,@ 000 sailing boats , five legions and some 2 @,@ 000 horses at Calais due to its strategic position to attack Britannia . At some time prior to the 10th century , it would have been a fishing village on a sandy beach backed by pebbles and a creek , with a natural harbour located at the western edge of the early medieval estuary of the River Aa . As the pebble and sand ridge extended eastward from Calais , the haven behind it developed into fen , as the estuary progressively filled with silt and peat . Subsequently , canals were cut between Saint @-@ Omer , the trading centre formerly at the head of the estuary , and three places to the west , centre and east on the newly formed coast : respectively Calais , Gravelines and Dunkirk . Calais was improved by the Count of Flanders in 997 and fortified by the Count of Boulogne in 1224 . 
 The first document mentioning the existence of this community is the town charter granted by Mathieu d 'Alsace in 1181 to Gerard de Guelders , Count of Boulogne ; Calais thus became part of the county of Boulogne . In 1189 , Richard the Lionheart is documented to have landed at Calais on his journey to the Third Crusade . 
 = = = 14th @-@ 15th century – the Pale of Calais = = = 
 English wool trade interests and King Edward III 's claims to be heir to the Kingdom of France led to the Battle of Crécy between England and France in 1346 , followed by Edward 's siege and capture of Calais in 1347 . Angered , the English king demanded reprisals against the town 's citizens for holding out for so long and ordered that the town 's population be killed en masse . He agreed , however , to spare them , on condition that six of the principal citizens would come to him , bareheaded and barefooted and with ropes around their necks , and give themselves up to death . On their arrival he ordered their execution , but pardoned them when his queen , Philippa of Hainault , begged him to spare their lives . This event is commemorated in The Burghers of Calais ( Les Bourgeois de Calais ) , one of the most famous sculptures by Auguste Rodin , erected in the city in 1895 . Though sparing the lives of the delegation members , King Edward drove out most of the French inhabitants , and settled the town with English . The municipal charter of Calais , previously granted by the Countess of Artois , was reconfirmed by Edward that year ( 1347 ) . 
 In 1360 the Treaty of Brétigny assigned Guînes , Marck and Calais — collectively the " Pale of Calais " — to English rule in perpetuity , but this assignment was informally and only partially implemented . On 9 February 1363 the town was made a staple port . It had by 1372 become a parliamentary borough sending burgesses to the House of Commons of the Parliament of England . It remained part of the Diocese of Thérouanne from 1379 , keeping an ecclesiastical tie with France . 
 The town came to be called the " brightest jewel in the English crown " owing to its great importance as the gateway for the tin , lead , cloth and wool trades ( or " staples " ) . Its customs revenues amounted at times to a third of the English government 's revenue , with wool being the most important element by far . Of its population of about 12 @,@ 000 people , as many as 5 @,@ 400 were recorded as having been connected with the wool trade . The governorship or Captaincy of Calais was a lucrative and highly prized public office ; the famous Dick Whittington was simultaneously Lord Mayor of the City of London and Mayor of the Staple in 1407 . 
 Calais was regarded for many years as being an integral part of the Kingdom of England , with its representatives sitting in the English Parliament . The continued English hold on Calais however depended on expensively maintained fortifications , as the town lacked any natural defences . Maintaining Calais was a costly business that was frequently tested by the forces of France and the Duchy of Burgundy , with the Franco @-@ Burgundian border running nearby . The British historian Geoffrey Elton once remarked " Calais — expensive and useless — was better lost than kept " . The duration of the English hold over Calais was , to a large extent , the result of the feud between Burgundy and France , under which both sides coveted the town , but preferred to see it in the hands of the English rather than their domestic rivals . The stalemate was broken by the victory of the French crown over Burgundy following Joan of Arc 's final battle in the Siege of Compiègne in 1430 , and the later incorporation of the duchy into France . 
 = = = 16th century = = = 
 In 1532 , English king Henry VIII visited Calais and his men calculated that the town had about 2400 beds and stabling to keep some 2000 horses . In September 1552 , the English adventurer Thomas <unk> , who had been for some time in the French service , betrayed to the authorities in London some French plans for the capture of Calais , to be followed by a descent upon England . <unk> himself might have been the author of these plans . 
 On 7 January 1558 , king Henry II of France sent forces led by Francis , Duke of Guise , who laid siege to Calais . When the French attacked , they were able to surprise the English at the critical strongpoint of Fort Nieulay and the sluice gates , which could have flooded the attackers , remained unopened . The loss was regarded by Queen Mary I of England as a dreadful misfortune . When she heard the news , she reportedly said , " When I am dead and opened , you shall find ' Philip ' [ her husband ] and ' Calais ' lying in my heart . " The region around Calais , then @-@ known as the <unk> , was renamed the Pays <unk> ( " <unk> Country " ) in commemoration of its recovery by the French . Use of the term is reminiscent of the Spanish Reconquista , with which the French were certainly familiar — and , since it occurred in the context of a war with Spain ( Philip II of Spain was at the time Queen Mary 's consort ) , might have been intended as a deliberate snub . 
 The town was captured by the Spanish on 24 April 1596 in an invasion mounted from the nearby Spanish Netherlands by Archduke Albert of Austria , but it was returned to France under the Treaty of Vervins in May 1598 .

 Calais remained an important maritime city and smuggling center throughout the 17th century . However , during the next century the port of Calais began to stagnate gradually , as the nearby ports of Boulogne and Dunkirk began to rise and compete . 
 The French revolution at the end of the 18th century did not disturb Calais and no executions took place . 
 In 1805 , Calais hosted part of Napoleon 's army and invasion fleet for several months before his aborted invasion of Britain . From October to December 1818 , the British army used Calais as their departing port to return home after occupying post @-@ Waterloo France . General Murray appointed Sir Manley Power to oversee the evacuation of British troops from France . <unk> relations had been restored by that time and on 3 December the mayor of Calais wrote a letter to Power to express thanks for his " considerate treatment of the French and of the town of Calais during the embarkation . " 
 The British Expeditionary Force or BEF arrived in Calais on its way to the nearby frontline cutting through Nord @-@ Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais and Flanders . Calais was a key port for the supply of arms and reinforcements to the Western Front . In the 1930s , the town was known for being a politically socialist stronghold . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 Calais was virtually razed to the ground during World War II . In May 1940 , it was a key objective of the invading German forces and became the scene of a last @-@ ditch defence — the Siege of Calais — which diverted a sizable amount of German forces for several days immediately prior to the Battle of Dunkirk . 3 @,@ 000 British and 800 French troops , assisted by Royal Navy warships , held out from 22 to 27 May 1940 against the 10th Panzer Division . The town was flattened by artillery and precision dive bombing and only 30 of the 3800 @-@ strong defending force were evacuated before the town fell . This may have helped Operation Dynamo , the evacuation of Allied forces at Dunkirk , as 10th Panzer would have been involved on the Dunkirk perimeter had it not been busy at Calais . Between 26 May and 4 June 1940 , some 330 @,@ 000 Allied troops escaped from the Germans at Dunkirk . 
 During the ensuing German occupation , it became the command post for German forces in the Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais / Flanders region and was very heavily fortified , as it was generally believed by the Germans that the Allies would invade at that point . It was also used as a launch site for V1 flying bombs and for much of the war , the Germans used the region as the site for railway guns used to bombard the south @-@ eastern corner of England . In 1943 they built massive bunkers along the coast in preparation for launching missiles on the southeast of England . Despite heavy preparations for defence against an amphibious assault , the Allied invasion took place well to the west in Normandy on D @-@ Day . Calais was very heavily bombed and shelled in a successful effort to disrupt German communications and persuade them that the Allies would target the Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais for invasion ( rather than Normandy ) . The town , by then largely in ruins , was liberated by General Daniel Spry 's 3rd Canadian Infantry Division between 25 September and 1 October 1944 . On 27 February 1945 Calais suffered a last bombing raid — this time by British bombers who mistook the town for Dunkirk , which was at that time still occupied by German forces . After the war there was little rebuilding of the historic city and most buildings were modern ones . 
 = = = 21st century – migration issues = = = 
 Since 1999 or earlier , an increasingly large number of migrants and refugees have started to arrive in the vicinity of Calais , where they remain living in the Calais jungle , the nickname given to a series of makeshift camps . The people live there while they attempt to enter the United Kingdom by stowing away on lorries , ferries , cars , or trains travelling through the Port of Calais or the Eurotunnel Calais Terminal . The people are a mix of refugees , asylum seekers and economic migrants from Darfur , Afghanistan , Syria , Iraq , Eritrea and other troubled areas of the world . 
 The Calais migrant crisis led to escalating tension between the UK and France in the summer of 2015 . The UK blamed France for not doing enough to stop migrants from entering the tunnel or making attempts to scale fences built along the border . The British Prime Minister David Cameron released a statement saying that illegal immigrants would be removed from the UK even if they reach the island . To discourage migrants and refugees from jumping on train shuttles at Calais , the UK government supplied fencing to be installed in the Eurotunnel where the vehicles are loaded on to train shuttles in Calais .

 Calais is located on the Pas de Calais , which marks the boundary between the English Channel and North Sea and located at the opposite end of the Channel Tunnel , 34 kilometres ( 21 miles ) from Dover . On a clear day the White cliffs of Dover can be viewed across the channel . Aside from being an important port and boarding point between France and England , it is at the nucleus of many major railway and highway networks and connected by road to Arras , Lens , Béthune and St. Omer . Dunkirk is located about 47 km ( 29 mi ) by road to the east . Calais is located 288 km ( 179 mi ) north by road from the French capital of Paris , roughly a 3 @-@ hour 15 minute journey . The commune of Calais is bordered by the English channel to the north , <unk> and Coquelles to the west , <unk> to the south and Marck to the east . The core area of the city is divided into the Old Town area within the old city walls , and the younger suburbs of St. Pierre , which are connected by a boulevard . 
 Calais is part of the Côte d <unk> ( Opal Coast ) , a cliff @-@ lined section of northern French coast that parallels the white cliffs on the British coast and is part of the same geological formation . It is known for its scenic cliffs such as Cape Blanc Nez and Cape Gris Nez and for its wide area of dunes . Many artists have been inspired by its landscapes , among them the composer Henri <unk> , the writers Victor Hugo and Charles Dickens , and the painters J. M. W. Turner , Carolus @-@ Duran , Maurice <unk> and Eugène Boudin . It was the painter Édouard <unk> who coined the name for this area in 1911 to describe the distinctive quality of its light . 
 The climate is temperate oceanic in Calais . Temperature ranges are moderate and the winters are mild with unstable weather . It rains on average about 700 to 800 mm ( 28 to 31 in ) per year . 
 The commune of Calais is divided into 13 quartiers :

 The city 's proximity to England has made it a major port for centuries . It is the principal ferry crossing point between England and France , with the vast majority of Channel crossings being made between Dover and Calais . Companies operating from Calais include SeaFrance ( currently in liquidation ) , DFDS Seaways , and P & O Ferries . The French end of the Channel Tunnel is situated in the vicinity of Calais , in Coquelles some 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) to the west of the town . Calais possesses direct rail links to Paris , 148 miles ( 238 km ) to the south . More than 10 million people visit Calais annually . 
 From medieval times , English companies thrived in Calais . Calais was a particularly important centre in the production and trade of wool and cloth , which outweighed the costs of maintaining the town as part of England . In 1830 some 113 manufacturers were based in Calais and the St Pierre suburbs , the majority of which were English . There are still two major lace factories in Calais with around 700 looms and 3000 employees .

 As a fishing port , Calais has several notable fishing markets including Les Délices de la Mer and <unk> <unk> on the Boulevard La Fayette , the latter of which is noted for its oysters , lobster and crabs from Brittany . The Emile Fournier et Fils market on the Rue <unk> sells mainly smoked fish including salmon , trout , herring and halibut .

 Place d 'Armes is one of the largest squares in the city of Calais , adjoins the watchtower , and during medieval times was once the heart of the city . During the English occupation ( 1347 – 1558 ) , it became known as Market Square ( place du Marché ) . Only at the end of English occupation did it take the name of Place d 'Armes . After the reconquest of Calais in 1558 by Francis , Duke of Guise , Francis II gave Calais the right to hold a fair twice a year on the square , which still exists today , as well as a bustling Wednesday and Saturday market . 
 = = = Hôtel de Ville = = = 
 The town centre , which has seen significant regeneration over the past decade , is dominated by its distinctive town hall ( Hôtel de Ville ) at Place du Soldat <unk> . It was built in the Flemish Renaissance style between 1911 and 1925 to commemorate the unification of the cities of Calais and Saint Pierre in 1885 . A previous town hall had been erected in 1818 . One of the most elegant landmarks in the city , its ornate 74 metre ( 246 ft ) high clock tower and belfry can be seen from out to sea and chimes throughout the day and has been protected by UNESCO since 2005 as part of a series of belfries across the region . The building parts have also been listed as a series of historic monuments by government decree of 26 June 2003 , including its roofs and belfry , main hall , glass roof , the staircase , corridor serving the first floor , the rooms on the first floor ( including decoration ) : the wedding room , the VIP lounge , the lounge of the council and the cabinet room . The hall has stained glass windows and numerous paintings and exquisite decor . It houses police offices .

 Église Notre @-@ Dame is a cathedral which was originally built in the late 13th century and its tower was added in the late 14th or early 15th century . Like the town hall it is one of the city 's most prominent landmarks . It was arguably the only church in the English perpendicular style in France . Much of the current 1400 capacity church dates to 1631 – 1635 . It contains elements of Flemish , Gothic , Anglo @-@ Norman and Tudor architecture . In 1691 , an 1800 cubic metre cistern was added to the church under orders by Vauban . The church is dedicated to the Virgin , and built in the form of a cross , consisting of a nave and four aisles — The old grand altar dated to 1628 and was built from Carrara marble wrecked on the coast , during its transit from Genoa to Antwerp . It contained eighteen figures , the two standing on either side of the altar @-@ piece — representing St. Louis and Charlemagne . The organ — of a deep and mellow tone , and highly ornamented by figures in relief — was built at Canterbury sometime around 1700 . The pulpit and reading @-@ desk , richly sculptured in oak , is another well @-@ executed piece of ecclesiastical workmanship from St. Omers . The altar @-@ piece , the Assumption , was often attributed to Anthony van Dyck , though in reality it is by Van <unk> ; whilst the painting over the side altar , believed to be by Peter Paul Rubens . A high and strongly built wall , partaking more of the fortress than a cathedral in its aspect , flanks the building , and protects it from the street where formerly ran the old river , in its course through Calais to the sea . 
 The square , massive Norman tower has three @-@ arched belfry windows on each face , surmounted by corner turrets , and a <unk> @-@ shaped tower of octagonal proportions , topped again by a short steeple . The tower was a main viewing point for the Anglo @-@ French Survey ( 1784 – 1790 ) which linked the Paris Observatory with the Royal Greenwich Observatory using trigonometry . Cross @-@ channel sightings were made of signal lights at Dover Castle and Fairlight , East Sussex . 
 The church was assigned as a historic monument by decree of 10 September 1913 , only to have its stained glass smashed during a Zeppelin bombardment on 15 January 1915 , falling through the roof . General de Gaulle married Yvonne <unk> on 6 April 1921 at the cathedral . The building experienced extensive damage during World War II , and was partially rebuilt , although much of the old altar and furnishings were not replaced .

 The Tour du Guet ( Watch Tower ) , situated in Calais Nord on the Places d 'Armes , is one of the few surviving pre @-@ war buildings . Dating from 1229 , when Philip I , Count of Boulogne , built the fortifications of Calais , it is one of the oldest monuments of Calais , although the oldest remaining traces date to 1302 . It has a height of 35 – 39 metres ( sources differ ) . An earthquake in 1580 split the tower in two , and at one time it threatened to collapse completely . The tower was repaired in 1606 , and then had the purpose of serving as a hall to accommodate the merchants of Calais . It was damaged in 1658 when a young stable boy set fire to it , while it was temporarily being used as royal stables during a visit of King Louis XIV . It was not repaired for some 30 years . In 1770 , a bell identical to the original bell of 1348 was cast . Due to its height , from the late 17th century it became an important <unk> post for the city for centuries until 1905 ; the last keeper of the tower was forced to leave in 1926 . Abraham Chappe , ( a brother of Ignace Chappe ) installed a telegraph office in the tower in 1816 and operated for 32 years . It was this office which announced the death of Napoleon I to the French public in 1821 . It also had the dual function as lighthouse with a rotating beacon fuelled by oil from 1818 . The lantern was finally replaced by a new lighthouse on 15 October 1848 . During the First World War , it served as a military observation post and narrowly missed destruction during World War II . This tower has been classified as a historic monument since 6 November 1931 . 
 The Calais Lighthouse ( Le <unk> de Calais ) was built in 1848 , replacing the old watch tower as the lighthouse of the port . The 55 metre high tower was electrified in 1883 and automated in 1992 . The staircase has 271 steps leading up to the lantern . By day it is easily distinguishable from other coastal lighthouses by its white color and black lantern . The lighthouse was classified as a historical monument on 22 November 2010 .

 The Citadel , located on the Avenue Pierre Coubertin , was built between 1560 and 1571 on the site of a former medieval castle which was built in 1229 by Philippe de <unk> . Its purpose of its construction was to fend off would @-@ be invaders , but it wasn 't long until the city was successfully invaded by Archduke Albert of Austria on 24 April 1596 . Both Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu at one time considered expanding the citadel and Calais into a great walled city for military harbour purposes but the proposals came to nothing . 
 Fort <unk> , located on the coast on the Avenue Raymond Poincaré at the port entrance , was built by the English to prevent supplies reaching Calais by sea during the siege in November 1346 and continued to be occupied by them until 1558 when Calais was restored to France . In 1596 , the fort was captured by the Spanish Netherlands until May 1598 when it was returned to the French following the Treaty of Vervins . It was rebuilt in 1640 . Vauban , who visited the fort some time in the 1680s , described it as " a home for owls , and place to hold the Sabbath " rather than a fortification . During World War II it served as an air raid shelter . It contains the Lancaster Tower , a name often given to the fort itself . 
 Fort Nieulay , located along the Avenue Roger <unk> originally dated to the 12th or 13th century . During the English invasion in 1346 , sluices gates were added as water defences and a fort was built up around it in 1525 on the principle that the people of the fort could defend the town by flooding it . In April and May 1677 , Louis XIV and Vauban visited Calais and ordered a complete rebuilding of Fort Nieulay . It was completed in 1679 , with the purpose to protect the bridge of Nieulay crossing the Hames River . By 1815 the fort had fallen into a ruined state and it wasn 't until 1903 that it was sold and improved by its farmer tenants . The fort was briefly the site of a low @-@ key scuffle with Germans in May 1940 .

 The Quatermass Xperiment ( US title : The Creeping Unknown ) is a 1955 British science fiction horror film from Hammer Film Productions , based on the 1953 BBC Television serial The Quatermass Experiment written by Nigel Kneale . The film was produced by Anthony Hinds , directed by Val Guest , and stars Brian Donlevy as the eponymous Professor Bernard Quatermass . Jack Warner , Richard Wordsworth , and Margia Dean appear in supporting roles . 
 Three astronauts are launched into space aboard a rocket designed by Professor Quatermass , but the spacecraft returns to earth with only one occupant , Victor Carroon ( Richard Wordsworth ) . Something has infected him during the spaceflight , and he begins mutating into an alien organism which , if it spores , will engulf the Earth and destroy humanity . When the Carroon @-@ creature escapes from custody , Quatermass and Scotland Yard 's Inspector Lomax ( Jack Warner ) , have just hours to track it down and prevent a catastrophe . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The British Rocket Group , headed by the taciturn Professor Bernard Quatermass , launches its first manned rocket into space . Shortly thereafter , all contact is lost with the rocket and its three crew : Carroon , <unk> , and Green . The large rocket later returns to earth , crashing into an English country field . 
 Quatermass and his assistant Briscoe arrive at the scene , along with the emergency services . Opening the rocket 's access hatch , the space @-@ suited Carroon stumbles outside ; inside , there is no sign of the other two crew members . Carroon is in shock , only able to say the words " Help me " . He is taken to hospital while Quatermass and Briscoe investigate what happened to the rocket and its two missing crew . 
 It quickly becomes evident that Carroon has been altered by something he encountered in space ; he can absorb any living thing with which he comes in contact . When he smashes a potted cactus in his hospital room , absorbing it , his right hand and then his arm begins to mutate . Not knowing this , Carroon 's wife , Judith , hires a private investigator to break her husband out of the secured hospital . The escape is successful , but Carroon then kills and absorbs the private investigator . It does not take long for Judith to discover what her husband has become , and Carroon soon flees from his horrified wife . 
 Inspector Lomax of Scotland Yard initiates a manhunt to find the missing Carroon . Hiding out at the London docks , he encounters a little girl , leaving her unharmed through sheer willpower . Instead , Carroon heads for a nearby zoo where he absorbs many of the animals . By now he has become a completely mutated creature . Quatermass and Briscoe track the Carroon @-@ creature to Westminster Abbey , where it has crawled high up on the metal scaffolding inside . From his examination of tissue samples taken from Carroon , Quatermass concludes that some kind of alien has completely taken over and will eventually release reproduction spores , endangering the entire planet . With the assistance of a television crew working at the Abbey , Quatermass succeeds in killing the Carroon @-@ creature by electrocution . 
 The threat eliminated , Quatermass quickly walks through the Abbey , preoccupied by his thoughts . He ignores all who ask questions . Marsh , his other assistant , approaches and asks " What now " ? Never breaking stride , Quatermass offhandedly replies , " I 'll need your help . We start over again " . He quickly leaves Marsh behind , walking into the London night .

 The screenplay , written by Richard Landau and Val Guest , presents a heavily compressed version of the events of the original television serial . The most significant plot change occurs at the climax of the film . In the television version , Quatermass appeals to the last vestiges of the creature 's humanity and convinces it to commit suicide to save the world . In the film , Quatermass kills the creature by electrocution . Nigel Kneale was critical of the changes made for the film adaptation and of the casting of Brian Donlevy , whose brusque interpretation of Quatermass was not to his liking . To make the film 's plot convincing to audiences , Guest employed a high degree of realism , directing the film in a style akin to a newsreel . The film was shot on location in London , Windsor and Bray and at Hammer 's Bray Studios . Carroon 's transformation was effected by makeup artist Phil Leakey , who worked in conjunction with cinematographer Walter J. Harvey to accentuate Wordsworth 's naturally gaunt features to give him an alien appearance . Special effects , including a model of the fully mutated creature seen at the climax , were provided by Les Bowie . The music was composed by James Bernard , the first of many scores he wrote for Hammer . 
 Hammer marketed the film in the United Kingdom by dropping the " E " from " Experiment " in the title to emphasise the adults @-@ only ' X ' Certificate given to the film by the British Board of Film Censors . Upon general release in 1955 , the film formed one half of the highest grossing double bill in the UK . It was the first Hammer production to attract the attention of a major distributor in the US , in this case United Artists , who distributed the film under the title The Creeping Unknown . Its success led to Hammer producing an increasing number of horror films , including two sequels Quatermass 2 ( 1957 ) and Quatermass and the Pit ( 1967 ) , making them synonymous with the genre . The Quatermass Xperiment is regarded as the first of these " Hammer Horrors " .

 The Quatermass Experiment was a six @-@ part serial broadcast by BBC Television in 1953 . Written by Nigel Kneale , it was an enormous success with critics and audiences alike , later described by film historian Robert Simpson as " event television , emptying the streets and pubs " . Among its viewers was Hammer Films producer Anthony Hinds , who was immediately keen to buy the rights for a film version . Incorporated in 1934 , Hammer had developed a niche for itself making second features , many of which were adaptations of successful BBC Radio productions . Hammer contacted the BBC on 24 August 1953 , two days after the transmission of the final episode , to enquire about the film rights . Nigel Kneale also saw the potential for a film adaptation and , at his urging , the BBC touted the scripts around a number of producers , including the Boulting Brothers and Frank <unk> and Sidney Gilliat . Kneale met with Sidney Gilliat to discuss the scripts but Gilliat was reluctant to buy the rights as he felt any film adaptation would inevitably receive an ‘ X ’ Certificate from the British Board of Film Censors ( BBFC ) , restricting admission to persons over the age of sixteen . Hammer were not so reticent , deciding from the outset that they would deliberately pursue an ‘ X ’ Certificate . Hammer 's offer met some resistance within the BBC , with one executive expressing reservations that The Quatermass Experiment was not suitable material for the company , but the rights were nevertheless sold for an advance of £ 500 . 
 Nigel Kneale was a BBC employee at the time , which meant that his scripts were owned entirely by the BBC and he received no extra payment for the sale of the film rights . This became a matter of some resentment on Kneale 's part , and when his BBC contract came up for renewal he demanded and secured control over any future film rights for his work . Despite this Kneale remained bitter over the affair until the BBC made an ex @-@ gratia payment of £ 3 @,@ 000 to him in 1967 , in recognition of his creation of Quatermass . 
 The film was co @-@ produced by Robert L. Lippert , an American movie producer and distributor . Hammer had entered into an arrangement with Lippert in 1951 under which Lippert provided finance and supplied American stars for Hammer 's films and distributed them in the United States . In return , Hammer 's distribution arm , Exclusive Films , distributed Lippert 's films in the United Kingdom . Lippert 's company was , in fact , a front for 20th Century Fox , whose president , Spyros Skouras , was a close friend of Lippert 's . Quota laws in the UK meant that US films had to have a British supporting feature , so it was in the American studios ' interests to fund these features to recover a greater proportion of the box office receipts . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 The first draft of the screenplay was written by Richard Landau , an American who had worked on six previous Hammer productions , including Spaceways ( 1953 ) , one of the company 's first forays into science fiction . Landau made significant changes in condensing the action to less than half the length of the original teleplay . For instance , the opening thirty minutes of the television version are covered in just two minutes in the film . In the process , Landau played up the horror elements of Kneale 's original teleplay . Aware that the film would be co @-@ funded by American backers , Landau added a transatlantic dimension to the script : Quatermass 's " British Rocket Group " became the " British @-@ American Rocket Group " and the character of his assistant , Briscoe , was rewritten as a US Air Force flight surgeon . Quatermass himself was demoted to a doctor and written much more as an action hero than the thoughtful scientist created by Nigel Kneale . Some characters from the television version , such as the journalist James Fullalove , are omitted altogether . Judith Carroon 's role in the film version is reduced to little more than that of the stricken astronaut 's anxious wife whereas in the television version she is also a prominent member of Quatermass 's Rocket Group . A subplot involving an extramarital affair between her and Briscoe is also left out of the film version . Kneale was particularly aggravated by the dropping of the notion from his original teleplay that Carroon has absorbed not only the bodies but also the memories and the personalities of his two fellow astronauts . This change leads to the most significant difference between the two versions : in the television version , Quatermass makes an appeal to the last vestiges that remain of the three astronauts absorbed by the creature and convinces it to commit suicide before it can spore whereas in the film version Quatermass kills the creature by electrocution . Director Val Guest defended this change believing it was " filmically a better end to the story " . He also felt it unlikely that Brian Donlevy 's gruff interpretation of Quatermass would lend itself to talking the creature into submission . 
 Having fallen foul of the censors with some of their earlier films , Hammer had an informal agreement to submit scripts in advance of shooting to the BBFC for comment . When the draft script for The Quatermass Xperiment was submitted , Board Secretary Arthur Watkins replied , " I must warn you at this stage that , while we accept this story in principle for the ‘ X ’ category , we could not certificate , even in that category , a film treatment in which the horrific element was so exaggerated as to be nauseating and revolting to adult audiences ” . The BBFC were particularly concerned with the violence in the scenes where Carroon escapes from hospital and with how graphic the depiction of <unk> 's transformation into the alien creature would be . 
 The script was refined further by director Val Guest , who cut 30 pages from Landau 's script . One of Guest 's key contributions to the script was to tailor the dialogue to suit the brusque style of star Brian Donlevy . With an American actor cast as Quatermass , Guest reverted Briscoe to a British character and reinstated Quatermass 's title of professor . Guest also adapted some sections of the script in response to the concerns of the BBFC . Further stylistic changes were sought by the BBC who retained a script approval option after the sale of the rights and asked Nigel Kneale to work on their suggested changes , much to his indignation . Kneale was tasked with rewriting any scenes featuring BBC announcers to match the BBC 's news reporting style . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Irish American actor Brian Donlevy was brought in by Robert L. Lippert to play the title role of Quatermass to provide an interest for American audiences . Donlevy , in his own words , specialised in " he @-@ men roles – rough , tough and realistic " . Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for Beau Geste ( 1939 ) , he was also known for his appearances in The Great McGinty ( 1940 ) and The Glass Key ( 1942 ) . At the time he appeared as Quatermass his career was in decline , however . Donlevy 's no @-@ nonsense portrayal of Quatermass is very different from that of Reginald Tate in the television version and was not to Nigel Kneale 's liking , who said , " I may have picked Quatermass 's surname out of a phone book , but his first name was carefully chosen : Bernard , after Bernard Lovell , the creator of Jodrell Bank . Pioneer , ultimate questing man . Donlevy played him as a mechanic , a creature with a completely closed mind ” . Responding to Kneale 's criticisms , Val Guest said , " Nigel Kneale was expecting to find Quatermass like he was on television , a sensitive British scientist , not some American stomping around , but to me Donlevy gave it absolute reality " . By this stage in his career , Donlevy was suffering from alcoholism ; it was some weeks into the shoot before Guest became aware that the flask of coffee he always carried on set was laced with brandy . Guest found , however , that " Brian was all right , no problem at all once you kept him sober " . He reprised the role of Quatermass in Quatermass 2 ( 1957 ) but was replaced by Andrew Keir in the third film , Quatermass and the Pit ( 1967 ) . 
 Inspector Lomax was played by Jack Warner , who appeared by arrangement with the J. Arthur Rank Organisation , with whom he was contracted . At the time he was best known as the star of Here Come the <unk> ( 1948 ) and its sequels . Shortly after finishing The Quatermass Xperiment , he made his first appearance on television in the role he is most associated with , as the title character in Dixon of Dock Green ( 1955 – 76 ) . Warner plays Lomax in a lighthearted fashion and there is a running joke in the film involving Lomax 's futile attempts to find the time to have a shave with his electric razor . 
 Richard Wordsworth was cast by Val Guest as the hapless Victor Carroon because " he had the right sort of face for the part " . He was best known at the time for his work in the theatre . His performance in The Quatermass Xperiment is frequently compared with that of Boris Karloff in Frankenstein ( 1931 ) . Guest , aware of the risk of an actor going over the top with the part , directed Wordsworth to " hold back just a mite of what you 're feeling " . Summing up Wordsworth 's performance , film critic Bill Warren said , " All Carroon 's anguish and torment are conveyed in one of the best mime performances in horror and science fiction films ... A sequence in which he is riding in a car with his wife is uncanny : only the alien is visible for a long moment " . Wordsworth went on to appear in three more Hammer films : The Camp on Blood Island ( 1958 ) , The Revenge of Frankenstein ( 1958 ) and The Curse of the Werewolf ( 1961 ) . He remained known predominantly as a stage actor , among other things devising and starring in a one @-@ person show dedicated to his great @-@ great grandfather , the poet William Wordsworth . 
 Another American star provided by Robert L. Lippert was Margia Dean , who played Judith Carroon . A former beauty queen , Dean was allegedly cast on account of her association with the 20th Century Fox president , Spyros Skouras . According to executive producer Michael Carreras , " Skouras had a girlfriend who was an actress and he wanted her in pictures , but he didn 't want her in pictures in America , because of the tittle @-@ tattle or whatever , so he set it up though his friend Bob Lippert " . Val Guest recalled of her , " She was a sweet girl , but she couldn 't act " . Her American accent was considered out of place in the film and so her lines were dubbed in post production . 
 Among the other actors that appear in the film are Thora Hird , Gordon Jackson , David King @-@ Wood , Harold Lang , Lionel Jeffries and Sam Kydd , many of whom appeared regularly in films directed by Val Guest . The Quatermass Xperiment also saw an early role for Jane Asher , who plays the little girl whom Carroon encounters when he is on the run .

 Val Guest was hired to direct the film . He began his career co @-@ writing comedies such as Oh , Mr Porter ! ( 1937 ) and Ask a Policeman ( 1939 ) before moving into directing with Miss London Ltd . ( 1943 ) . His first directing job for Hammer was on Life with the Lyons ( 1954 ) and he went on to direct their first two colour features : The Men of Sherwood Forest ( 1954 ) and Break in the Circle ( 1954 ) . Guest had little interest in science fiction and was unenthusiastic about directing the film ; he reluctantly took copies of Nigel Kneale 's television scripts with him on holiday in Tangiers and only began reading them after being teased for his " ethereal " attitude by his wife , Yolande Donlan . Impressed by what he read and pleased to be offered the opportunity to break away from directing comedy films , he took the job . In his approach to directing the film , Guest sought to make " a slightly wild story more believable " by creating a " science fact " film , shot " as though shooting a special programme for the BBC or something " . Influenced by Elia Kazan 's Panic in the Streets ( 1950 ) , Guest employed a cinéma vérité style , making extensive use of hand @-@ held camera , even on set , an unusual technique for the time which horrified several of the technicians employed on the film . To inject pace and add further realism into the story , Guest directed his actors to deliver their lines rapid @-@ fire and to overlap the dialogue . A meticulous planner , he created storyboards for every shot and mounted them on a blackboard so as to brief the crew for each day 's scenes . As a consequence , some members of the crew found Guest 's approach to be too mechanical . 
 Principal photography began on 12 October 1954 with a night shoot at Chessington Zoo and continued from 18 October 1954 into December . The budget was £ 42 @,@ 000 , low even by the standards of Hammer at the time . Special effects technician Les Bowie recalled , " We did Quatermass on a budget so low it wasn 't a real budget . I did it for wages not as a proper effects man who gets allocated a certain budget for a movie " . The shots of the emergency services rushing to the rocket crash site at the beginning of the movie were filmed in the village of Bray , Berkshire , where Hammer 's studios were located . The scenes with the crashed rocket were shot in a corn field at Water Oakley , near Bray . It was originally intended to make the crash site look more spectacular by setting fire to the field but bad weather put paid to this idea . Guest used a wide @-@ angle lens for these shots to convey a feeling of vastness to the scene . Carroon 's encounter with the little girl was filmed at the East India Docks in London . A second unit , under cameraman Len Harris , conducted additional location shooting around London for the montage scenes of the police search for Carroon . For the shot of the lights of London going out when the electricity is diverted to Westminster Abbey , an agreement was made with one of the engineers at Battersea Power Station to turn off the lights illuminating the outside of the station ; however the engineer misunderstood and briefly cut all the power along the River Thames . Most of the remaining location shooting was done in the Windsor area . The rest of the film was shot at Hammer 's Bray Studios , with the New Stage there housing the sets for the hospital and the interior of Westminster Abbey . Michael Carreras had written to the Abbey seeking permission to film there but was refused . The rooms of Down Place , the former country house Bray Studios were built around , were used for other scenes such as Inspector Lomax 's office . Art director James Elder Wills , in his final film for Hammer , made great use of the existing architecture of Down Place to enhance the effectiveness of his sets . 
 = = = Makeup and special effects = = = 
 The work of makeup artist Phil Leakey in transforming Richard Wordsworth 's Carroon into the mutating creature was a key contribution to the effectiveness of the film . Val Guest , Anthony Hinds and Leakey all agreed that the makeup should make Carroon appear pitiful rather than ugly . Leakey placed a light above the actor in the makeup chair and then worked on accentuating the shadows cast by his eyebrows , nose , chin and cheekbones . The makeup was a liquid rubber solution mixed with glycerine to give the impression of sweat . Leakey 's job was made easier by Wordsworth 's natural high cheekbones and hollow temples and he also worked closely with cinematographer Walter J. Harvey to ensure the lighting in each shot emphasised Wordsworth 's features . Leakey also created Carroon 's mutating arm . The hand was created from a cast of the hand of an arthritis victim , enlarged and exaggerated by Leakey . The rest of the arm was built up using latex and rubber and , inside , had a series of plastic tubes through which fluid was pumped to give the effect of the arm swelling . A large sponge @-@ rubber prosthetic was used for a brief scene in the zoo showing Carroon 's mutation had advanced further . The shrivelled corpses of Carroon 's victims , glimpsed from time to time in the film , were also made by Leakey . 
 Les Bowie provided the special effects : he had made his name perfecting an improved technique for matte painting , called the delineating matte , and formed a company with Vic <unk> that specialised in matte effects . Bowie provided a number of matte paintings to enhance the scale of certain key shots in the film , including the crashed rocket , the Westminster Abbey set and the shot of Quatermass walking away from the Abbey at the climax of the movie . Partly because of the concerns raised by the BBFC and partly on account of the low budget , Val Guest kept the creature largely off @-@ screen for much of the film , feeling that audiences ' imaginations would fill in the blanks more effectively than he and the special effects team could deliver on @-@ screen . For the climactic scenes at Westminster Abbey , however , Bowie created a monster from tripe and rubber and photographed it against a model of the Abbey . Sparks and fireworks were used for the shots of the creature being electrocuted . Michael Carreras felt something was missing when he viewed the first cut of this scene : he said , " There was this great glob of something hanging about on the scaffolding . And they had put in the best music they could and put the best effects on it , but it meant nothing as far as I was concerned … absolutely nothing at all " . An eye was added to the model of the monster and a human scream added to the soundtrack to give the creature some semblance of humanity in its final moments . Models were also used for the rocket blasting off in the final shot of the film . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 John <unk> was originally hired to compose the music but , when he fell ill , Anthony Hinds asked conductor John Hollingsworth to recommend a replacement . Hollingsworth suggested James Bernard , with whom he had worked on a number of BBC radio productions . Bernard sent Hinds a tape of the score of one of these productions , an adaptation of The Duchess of Malfi , and was duly hired . Bernard watched the film a number of times , stopping after each reel to make notes and discuss where the music would be needed . Val Guest was not involved in any of the music sessions ; Anthony Hinds supervised Bernard and made the final decisions as to where the music should occur . Bernard composed the music at his piano and then worked out the orchestration , which was performed by the Royal Opera House Orchestra . Hollingsworth restricted the arrangement of the score to just the string and percussion sections : Bernard recalled , " I had not written for film before and had only used strings for the BBC scores , so I think that John thought it would be better to see how I got on with these two sections before letting me loose with a full orchestra " . The score runs to 20 minutes and uses a rising and falling three @-@ note semitone throughout . Bernard 's biographer , David Huckvale , argues that Bernard 's use of atonal strings to create a sense of menace predates Bernard Herrmann 's score for Psycho ( 1960 ) , which is usually cited as the first film to employ the technique . Remarking on the effectiveness of the score , the film critic John Brosnan said , " Of prime importance , is the contribution of the soundtrack , in this case supplied by James Bernard who never wrote a more unnerving , jangly score " . Bernard went on to become Hammer 's most prolific composer , scoring 23 Hammer films between 1955 and 1974 . Several cues from The Quatermass Xperiment were released on CD in 1999 by GDI Records on a compilation titled The Quatermass Film Music Collection .

 As expected , The Quatermass Xperiment received an ‘ X ’ Certificate from the BBFC , restricting admission to persons over the age of sixteen . It was only the twelfth film to receive the certificate since its introduction in 1951 . Whereas most other studios were nervous of this new certificate , Hammer , who had noticed the success of the similarly ‘ X ’ -rated Les Diaboliques ( 1954 ) , chose to exploit it by dropping the " E " from " Experiment " in the title of the film . " X is not an unknown quantity " was the tagline Exclusive Films used to sell the picture to cinema managers , urging them to " <unk> the <unk> " of the film . On subsequent re @-@ releases , the film reverted to the title The Quatermass Experiment . 
 The Quatermass Xperiment premièred on 26 August 1955 at the London Pavilion on Piccadilly Circus . The supporting feature was The Eric Winstone Band Show . It performed extremely well during its West End run , taking £ 3 @,@ 500 a week at the box office . Timed to coincide with the broadcast of the television sequel , Quatermass II , the film went on general release in the United Kingdom on 20 November 1955 in a double bill with the French film Rififi . This became the most successful double bill release of 1955 in the UK . In some parts of the UK , the Watch Committees of local councils demanded certain scenes , mainly close @-@ up shots of Carroon 's victims , be removed before allowing the film to be exhibited in their jurisdictions . 
 In the United States , Robert L. Lippert attempted to interest Columbia Pictures in distributing the film but they felt it would be competition for their own production , It Came From Beneath The Sea , which was on release at the time . Because Quatermass was unknown in the US , Lippert had renamed the film Shock ! . Unable to secure a sale , he retitled it again , this time to The Creeping Unknown . United Artists eventually acquired the distribution rights in March 1956 for a fee of $ 125 @,@ 000 . The Creeping Unknown was packaged in a double bill with a Gothic horror movie called The Black Sleep , starring Basil Rathbone , Lon Chaney , Jr. and Bela Lugosi . Four minutes , mainly of expository material , were cut from the runtime of the film . It opened in US theatres in June 1956 and was so successful that United Artists offered to part @-@ fund a sequel . According to a report in Variety , published on 6 November 1956 , a nine @-@ year @-@ old boy died of a ruptured artery at a cinema in Oak Park , Illinois during a showing of this double bill . The Guinness Book of Records subsequently recorded the incident as the only known case of an audience member dying of fright while watching a horror film . 
 = = = Critical response = = = 
 The Times newspaper gave the film a generally favourable assessment : its critic wrote , " Mr. Val Guest , the director , certainly knows his business when it comes to providing the more horrid brand of thrills ... The first part of this particular film is well up to standard . Mr. Brian Donlevy , as the American scientist responsible for the experiment , is a little brusque in his treatment of British institutions but he is clearly a man who knows what he is doing . Mr. Jack Warner , representing Scotland Yard , is indeed a comfort to have at hand when Things are on the rampage . " Positive reviews also came from Peter <unk> in the News of the World , who found that " with the added benefit of bluff , boisterous Brian Donlevy … all earnest addicts of science fiction will undoubtedly love every minute of it " while the reviewer in The Manchester Guardian praised " a narrative style that quite neatly combines the horrific and the factual " and Today 's Cinema called it " one of the best essays in science fiction to date " Film historian Bruce G. Hallenbeck notes a degree of national pride in some of the positive reviews . For instance , Paul Dehn in the News Chronicle said , " This is the best and nastiest horror film I have seen since the War . How jolly that it is also British ! " . Similarly , William <unk> in the New Statesman , who found the film to be " better than either War of the Worlds or Them ! " , also called for " a couple of cheers for the reassurance that British films can still , once in a while , come quick " . 
 On a less positive note , Frank Jackson of Reynolds News quipped " That TV pseudo @-@ science shocker The Quatermass Xperiment has been filmed and <unk> they 've made of it too " , before slating the film as " 82 minutes of sick @-@ making twaddle " . The horror content of the film was mentioned in several reviews : Patrick Gibbs of the Daily Telegraph said the film " gives the impression that it originated in the strip of some horror comic . It remains very horrid and not quite coherent " while the reviewer in the Daily Mirror found the film to be " a real chiller thriller but not for the kids " and Dilys Powell of The Sunday Times found the film " exciting but distinctly nauseating " . Another unimpressed critic was François Truffaut , who wrote in Cahiers du cinéma that " This one is very , very bad , far from the small pleasure we get , for example , from the innocent science fiction films signed by the American Jack Arnold ... The subject could have been turned into a good film , not lacking in spice ; with a bit of imagination ... None of this is in this sadly English film ” . 
 Upon its release in the United States Variety praised the film as an " extravagant piece of science fiction . Despite its obvious horror angles , production is crammed with incident and suspense " . According to Hallenbeck , many US critics found Brian Donlevy 's gruff Quatermass a breath of fresh air from the earnest hero scientists of American science fiction films , such as Gene Barry 's character in War of the Worlds . 
 Other US trade reviews were mixed . Harrison 's Reports felt , " the story is , of course , quite fantastic but it has enough horrific ingredients to go over with those who enjoy scary doings . " Film Bulletin was not impressed . " Its strong point is an eerie atmosphere . . . but fails to build the suspense essential in this kind of film . . . Val Guest 's direction is heavy with cliches . " 
 Among the critics and film historians who have reviewed The Quatermass Xperiment in the years since it release have been John Baxter who said , in Science Fiction in the Cinema ( 1970 ) , " In its time , The Quatermass Experiment was a pioneering sf film ... Brian Donlevy was stiff but convincing ... Much of the film is saved , however , by Richard Wordsworth ... one of the finest such performances since Karloff 's triumphs of the Thirties . ” This view was echoed by John Brosnan in The Primal Screen ( 1991 ) : " One of the best of all alien possession movies " , he wrote , " Not since Boris Karloff as Frankenstein 's monster has an actor managed to create such a memorable , and sympathetic , monster out of mime alone " . Bill Warren in Keep Watching The Skies ! ( 1982 ) found that " the buildup is slightly too long and too careful " but also said , " It 's an intelligent , taut and well @-@ directed thriller ; it showcases Nigel Kneale 's ideas well ; it 's scary and exciting . It was made by people who cared about what they were doing , who were making entertainment for adults . It is still one of the best alien invasion films " . Steve Chibnall , writing for the British Film Institute 's Screenonline , describes The Quatermass Xperiment as " one of the high points of British SF / horror cinema . " The horror fiction writer Stephen King praised the film as one of his favourite horror movies from between 1950 and 1980 in his non @-@ fiction book Danse Macabre ( 1991 ) . The film director John Carpenter , who later collaborated with Nigel Kneale on the film Halloween III : Season of the Witch ( 1982 ) , has claimed that The Quatermass Xperiment " had an enormous , enormous impact on me – and it continues to be one of my all @-@ time favourite science @-@ fiction movies . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The success of The Quatermass Xperiment came at an opportune time for Hammer . By 1955 the deal with Robert L. Lippert had expired and the company produced just one feature film that year , Women Without Men . Many of the independent cinemas that provided the market for Hammer 's films in the UK were struggling in the face of competition from television and faced closure . The Quatermass Xperiment gave Hammer a much needed box office hit and was also the first film to bring the company to the attention of a major film distributor , in this case United Artists . From this point onward , Hammer was increasingly able to deal directly with the major distributors and no longer needed intermediaries like Lippert . This ultimately spelt the end for Exclusive Films , Hammer 's own distribution company , which was wound down in the late 1950s . 
 Hammer quickly sought to capitalise on its good fortune with a sequel . Staff member Jimmy Sangster pitched a story about a monster emerging from the Earth 's core . However , when the company asked Nigel Kneale for permission to use the character of Quatermass , he refused , not wanting to lose control of his creation . Nevertheless , the film went ahead , as X the Unknown ( 1956 ) , again capitalising on the ' X ' Certificate in its title and featuring a newly created scientist character , very much in the Quatermass mould , played by Dean Jagger . Quatermass did eventually return to cinema screens in Quatermass 2 ( 1957 ) and Quatermass and the Pit ( 1967 ) , both of which had screenplays written by Nigel Kneale and based on serials originally written by him and presented by BBC Television . Rival British film companies also tried to cash in with science fiction films of their own , including Satellite in the Sky , The Gamma People and Fire Maidens from Outer Space ( all 1956 ) . 
 The Quatermass Xperiment was Hammer 's first film to be adapted from a television drama . Market research carried out by the company showed that it was the horror aspect of the film , rather than the science fiction , that most appealed to audiences . Three of the four films Hammer made in 1956 were horror films : X the Unknown , Quatermass 2 and The Curse of Frankenstein . The enormous success of the latter of these cemented Hammer 's reputation for horror and the company became synonymous with the genre . Michael Carreras later said , " The film that must take all the credit for the whole Hammer series of horror films was really The Quatermass Xperiment " .

 = Banksia canei = 
 The mountain banksia ( Banksia canei ) is a species of shrub in the plant genus Banksia . It occurs in subalpine areas of the Great Dividing Range between Melbourne and Canberra in southeastern Australia . Although no subspecies are recognised , four <unk> ( geographically isolated populations ) have been described , as there is significant variation in the shape of both adult and juvenile leaves between populations . Although superficially resembling B. marginata , it is more closely related to another subalpine species , B. saxicola . 
 Banksia canei is generally encountered as a many @-@ branched shrub that grows up to 3 m ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) high , with narrow leaves and the yellow inflorescences ( flower spikes ) appearing from late summer to early winter . The old flowers fall off the spikes , and up to 150 finely furred follicles develop , which remain closed until burnt in a bushfire . Each follicle bears two winged seeds . Response to fire is poorly known , although it is thought to regenerate by seed . Birds such as the yellow @-@ tufted honeyeater and various insects forage among the flower spikes . It is frost tolerant in cultivation , but copes less well with aridity or humidity , and is often short @-@ lived in gardens . One cultivar , Banksia " Celia Rosser " , was registered in 1978 , but has subsequently vanished . 
 = = Description = = 
 Banksia canei grows as a woody shrub to 3 m ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) in height , usually with many branches . Its bark is smooth with horizontal lenticels , initially reddish @-@ brown before fading to grey tones . The stiff leaves are arranged alternately along the stems and show significant variation in shape and size . Adult leaves are linear or narrowly obovate in shape , and generally measure 2 – 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 79 – 1 @.@ 97 in ) , though some populations have leaves as short as 1 cm ( 0 @.@ 39 in ) or as long as 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) . The juvenile leaves are generally larger and wider with dentate margins . New growth is seen mainly from February to April . The complex flower spikes , known as inflorescences , appear between December and May , peaking over February to April . They arise from nodes of 1 – 3 @-@ year @-@ old branchlets or can be terminal . Cylindrical in shape , they are composed of a central woody spike , from which a large number of compact floral units arise perpendicularly to it . They are generally 5 – 10 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 – 3 @.@ 9 in ) high and 3 – 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 2 @.@ 0 in ) wide , but some do reach 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) high . Mauve @-@ tinted in bud , they generally open to become pale yellow in colour . As with most banksias , anthesis is acropetal ; the opening of the individual buds proceeds up the flower spike from the base to the top . The flower limbs may be pale grey or blue @-@ tinged , while the styles are yellow . As the inflorescences age , the old flowers fall away leaving a naked spike . Up to 150 follicles develop , each covered in short fine fur which is initially pale brown but fades to green @-@ grey and partly wears away . More or less elliptic in shape , they measure 12 – 18 mm ( 0 @.@ 47 – 0 @.@ 71 in ) long , 3 – 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 12 – 0 @.@ 31 in ) high , and 4 – 9 mm ( 0 @.@ 16 – 0 @.@ 35 in ) wide , and mostly remain closed until burnt by fire , although a few may open after several years . They contain two fertile seeds each , between which lies a woody dark brown separator of similar shape to the seeds . Measuring 13 – 18 mm ( 0 @.@ 5 – 0 @.@ 7 in ) in length , the seed is obovate , and composed of a dark brown 8 – 11 mm ( 0 @.@ 3 – 0 @.@ 4 in ) -wide membranous ' wing ' and crescent @-@ shaped ( lunate ) seed proper which measures 6 – 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 3 in ) long by 2 @.@ 5 – 4 mm ( 0 @.@ 1 – 0 @.@ 2 in ) wide . The seed surface can be smooth or covered in tiny ridges , and often glistens . The resulting seedling first grows two obovate cotyledon leaves , which may remain for several months as several more leaves appear . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Banksia canei was first described in 1967 by James H. Willis , who had collected it on 27 November 1962 along the Mt . Seldom Seen track in the vicinity of Wulgulmerang , Victoria . Earlier collections include a specimen Ferdinand von Mueller had collected near <unk> in 1853 , and one found by Richard Hind Cambage in 1908 near <unk> Peak . However , neither botanist considered this to be a new species at the time , instead holding it to be an unusual mountain form of the locally widespread B. marginata . Willis named the species after Victorian plantsman Bill Cane who had alerted authorities to the existence of an unusual banksia that was distinct from B. marginata some years previously . At the time , a plant collected from Mount Fulton near Port Davey in South West Tasmania was thought to be B. canei , but it was later reassessed as B. marginata . B. canei can be distinguished by its larger follicles and sharp points to the leaves . In his 1981 monograph of the genus Banksia , Alex George noted that despite a superficial resemblance to B. marginata , its bare old cones and stouter foliage indicated a closer relationship to B. integrifolia and B. saxicola , although it lacks the latter species ' whorled leaf arrangement . A fossil species , B. kingii from the late Pleistocene of Melaleuca Inlet in southwestern Tasmania , has robust foliage and infructescence resembling those of B. canei and B. saxicola , and appears to be a recently extinct relative . The leaf of a much older fossil species <unk> <unk> from Oligocene deposits in the Latrobe Valley closely resembles B. canei in shape , anatomy and vein pattern . 
 The current taxonomic arrangement of the Banksia genus is based on botanist Alex George 's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series . In this arrangement , B. canei is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia , because its inflorescences take the form of Banksia 's characteristic flower spikes ; section Banksia because of its straight styles ; and series Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical . Kevin Thiele placed it in a subseries Integrifoliae , where he found strong support for it and B. saxicola to be each other 's closest relative . The two were a sister group ( i.e. next closest relative ) to the four then @-@ recognised subspecies of B. integrifolia . The subseries all bear whorled leaves apart from B. canei and B. aquilonia . However , this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George . He did place the two subalpine taxa ( B. canei and B. saxicola ) at the end of the sequence as he thought they were the most recently evolved species , since he considered the group to have a tropical origin and B. dentata to be the oldest lineage . 
 B. marginata 's placement within Banksia may be summarised as follows : 
 Genus Banksia 
 Subgenus Isostylis 
 Subgenus Banksia 
 Section Oncostylis 
 Section Coccinea 
 Section Banksia 
 Series Grandes 
 Series Banksia 
 Series Crocinae 
 Series Prostratae 
 Series Cyrtostylis 
 Series Tetragonae 
 Series Bauerinae 
 Series Quercinae 
 Series Salicinae 
 B. dentata – B. aquilonia – B. integrifolia – B. plagiocarpa – B. oblongifolia – B. robur – B. conferta – B. paludosa – B. marginata – B. canei – B. saxicola 
 Since 1998 , American botanist Austin Mast and co @-@ authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae , which then comprised genera Banksia and Dryandra . Their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from George 's taxonomic arrangement . Banksia canei resolves as an early offshoot within the series Salicinae . Early in 2007 , Mast and Thiele rearranged the genus Banksia by merging Dryandra into it , and published B. subg . Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon @-@ shaped cotyledons ; thus B. subg . Banksia was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon @-@ shaped cotyledons . They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete ; in the meantime , if Mast and Thiele 's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement , then B. canei is placed in B. subg . Spathulatae . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Several disjunct populations of Banksia canei have been recorded across alpine areas of southeastern Australia , generally at altitudes of 500 to 1 @,@ 000 m ( 1 @,@ 600 to 3 @,@ 300 ft ) in northeastern Victoria and southeastern New South Wales . One outlier at a lower altitude has been found on land partly cleared for agriculture at 250 m ( 820 ft ) elevation at <unk> . The species is listed as " Rare in Victoria " on the Department of Sustainability and Environment 's Advisory List of Rare Or Threatened Plants In Victoria . In a 1978 paper reviewing the species , Alf Salkin coined the term <unk> to indicate a geographically isolated population of plants , derived from the Ancient Greek words topos " place " and deme " people " or " county ( population ) " . Salkin described four populations ( <unk> ) , each found in granite @-@ based rocky soils in subalpine regions , and isolated from one another by wide river valleys . They would have occupied lower altitudes at cooler geological periods and higher altitudes in warmer times . Each of the main four populations varies from the others in their leaf morphology . Salkin observed that as the habitat and environment was similar across the range , the differences were secondary to genetic drift , as certain traits have begun to dominate over others by chance as the populations begin to diverge genetically . 
 Most populations are located south or east of the Great Dividing Range , the exception being the Snowy Mountains population . The Kybean Range population is contiguous , while the others are fragmented . From west to east the populations are : 
 The Wellington River form , in the Snowy Range from Mount Howitt southwards to an area between the Moroka and Barkly Rivers . The <unk> Mitchell system separates this form from the Wulgulmerang form to the east . The margins of the adult leaves are prominently dentate ( toothed ) , much more so than other forms which may have occasional ' teeth ' here and there . The flower has a distinctive blue @-@ grey limb . 
 The Snowy Mountains form , found to the north of the Snowy Mountains and west of the Australian Capital Territory , <unk> and Corryong in the Bogong Mountains . This is separated by the Murray River to the south . This form has the smallest infructescences , measuring 6 – 8 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 – 3 @.@ 1 in ) high and 3 @.@ 5 – 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 4 – 1 @.@ 6 in ) wide . The adult leaves are 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) long , while the flowers are small , with perianths only 1 @.@ 6 cm ( 0 @.@ 63 in ) long . Like those of the Wellington River form , the flower limbs are blue @-@ grey . 
 The Wulgulmerang form , located to the north and east of <unk> , to Wulgulmerang and the Little River . The flower limb is a more yellow @-@ brown and the infructescences resemble those of B. marginata . It is found among granite rocks in association with the <unk> ( Eucalyptus rubida ) . 
 The Kybean Range form , in southeastern New South Wales – located in the Kybean Range and <unk> River east of Cooma . The Snowy River separates this form from the Wulgulmerang form to the west . This form has the largest flower spikes and infructescences , measuring up to 14 cm ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) high and 6 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) wide . It has very short adult leaves , yet wide juvenile leaves that resemble Banksia integrifolia . 
 There is one report of naturalisation in Western Australia , near Jerramungup , on a road verge .

 Banksia flower spikes are important sources of nectar for mammals , insects and birds , particularly honeyeaters . Animals recorded foraging among the flower spikes of B. canei include the yellow @-@ tufted honeyeater ( Lichenostomus melanops ) , and bees , wasps and ants . 
 Banksia canei lacks a lignotuber and appears to regenerate from bushfire by seed , although its response to fire has been little studied . The follicles remain closed until burnt , although some do open spontaneously after five years or so . The fungus Banksiamyces toomansis , of the order Helotiales , infects older cones and seed , and hence seed older than about five years is often not viable . <unk> <unk> is a species of anamorphic fungus that was recovered from a dead branch of B. canei at Healesville Sanctuary and described in 1986 .

 Banksia canei is somewhat slow @-@ growing in cultivation , and takes around five to seven years to flower from seed . Its furry @-@ <unk> fruiting cones are attractive , although generally obscured by foliage . Although grown successfully in England and tolerant of temperatures to − 12 ° C ( 10 ° F ) , Banksia canei has a reputation of being difficult to keep alive in Australian gardens . Plants often grow well as seedlings in pots , but perish once planted in the ground . It is tolerant to frost , but not to aridity or possibly more humid conditions . The species prefers a sunny aspect and fair drainage . It has been grown in inland New South Wales on the Southern Tablelands and Rylstone . Banksia canei seed requires stratification — storing at 5 ° C ( 41 ° F ) for 60 days — before it germinates , which takes a further 6 to 25 days . Salkin proposed this was necessary so that seed released in a summer or autumn bushfire would lie dormant over the winter months before germinating in the spring . Banksia saxicola and some Banksia marginata seeds of subalpine provenance also share this trait . 
 In 1975 , as part of a study on the four populations of B. canei , Salkin carried out germination experiments , producing around a thousand seedlings . In January that year , two seedlings from the Wulgulmerang population displayed deeply lobed ( <unk> ) leaves and a prostrate habit . One died , but in April two seedlings from the Wellington River seed appeared which bore the same appearance . Both these younger seedlings died , but the one older plant survived . It was propagated and registered as a cultivar Banksia ' Celia Rosser ' on 28 May 1978 , named in honour of Celia Rosser , an artist who has illustrated many banksias . It produced flower spikes 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) high and 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) wide , which made up for their small size by their abundance . Salkin felt its importance lay not in its horticultural potential but in its appearance in two geographically distant populations . He felt it represented the reappearance of an earlier ( possibly ancestral ) form , representing " <unk> all but lost " . However , the cultivar has since vanished . 
 = Ralph Vaughan Williams = 
 Ralph Vaughan Williams OM ( / <unk> <unk> <unk> / 12 October 1872 – 26 August 1958 ) was an English composer . His works include operas , ballets , chamber music , secular and religious vocal pieces and orchestral compositions including nine symphonies , written over nearly fifty years . Strongly influenced by Tudor music and English folk @-@ song , his output marked a decisive break in British music from its German @-@ dominated style of the 19th century . 
 Vaughan Williams was born to a well @-@ to @-@ do family with strong moral views and a progressive social outlook . Throughout his life he sought to be of service to his fellow citizens , and believed in making music as available as possible to everybody . He wrote many works for amateur and student performance . He was musically a late developer , not finding his true voice until his late thirties ; his studies in 1907 – 08 with the French composer Maurice Ravel helped him clarify the textures of his music and free it from Teutonic influences . 
 Vaughan Williams is among the best @-@ known British symphonists , noted for his very wide range of moods , from stormy and impassioned to tranquil , from mysterious to exuberant . Among the most familiar of his other concert works are Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis ( 1910 ) and The Lark Ascending ( 1914 ) . His vocal works include hymns , folk @-@ song arrangements and large @-@ scale choral pieces . He wrote eight works for stage performance between 1919 and 1951 . Although none of his operas became popular repertoire pieces , his ballet Job : A Masque for Dancing ( 1930 ) was successful and has been frequently staged . 
 Two episodes made notably deep impressions in Vaughan Williams 's personal life . The First World War , in which he served in the army , had a lasting emotional effect . Twenty years later , though in his sixties and devotedly married , he was reinvigorated by a love affair with a much younger woman , who later became his second wife . He went on composing through his seventies and eighties , producing his last symphony months before his death at the age of eighty @-@ five . His works have continued to be a staple of the British concert repertoire , and all his major compositions and many of the minor ones have been recorded .

 = = = Early years = = = 
 Vaughan Williams was born at Down <unk> , Gloucestershire , the third child and younger son of the vicar , the Reverend Arthur Vaughan Williams ( 1834 – 1875 ) and his wife , Margaret , née Wedgwood ( 1842 – 1937 ) . His paternal forebears were of mixed English and Welsh descent ; many of them went into the law or the Church . The judges Sir Edward and Sir Roland Vaughan Williams were respectively Arthur 's father and brother . Margaret Vaughan Williams was a great @-@ granddaughter of Josiah Wedgwood and niece of Charles Darwin . 
 Arthur Vaughan Williams died suddenly in February 1875 , and his widow took the children to live in her family home , Leith Hill Place , Wotton , Surrey . The children were under the care of a nurse , Sara Wager , who instilled in them not only polite manners and good behaviour but also liberal social and philosophical opinions . Such views were consistent with the progressive @-@ minded tradition of both sides of the family . When the young Vaughan Williams asked his mother about Darwin 's controversial book On the Origin of Species , she answered , " The Bible says that God made the world in six days . Great Uncle Charles thinks it took longer : but we need not worry about it , for it is equally wonderful either way " . 
 In 1878 , at the age of five , Vaughan Williams began receiving piano lessons from his aunt , Sophy Wedgwood . He displayed signs of musical talent early on , composing his first piece of music , a four @-@ bar piano piece called " The Robin 's Nest " , in the same year . He did not greatly like the piano , and was pleased to begin violin lessons the following year . In 1880 , when he was eight , he took a correspondence course in music from Edinburgh University and passed the associated examinations . 
 In September 1883 he went as a boarder to Field House preparatory school in Rottingdean on the south coast of England , forty miles from Wotton . He was generally happy there , although he was shocked to encounter for the first time social snobbery and political conservatism which were rife among his fellow pupils . From there he moved on to the public school Charterhouse in January 1887 . His academic and sporting achievements there were satisfactory , and the school encouraged his musical development . In 1888 he organised a concert in the school hall , which included a performance of his G major Piano Trio ( now lost ) with the composer as violinist . 
 While at Charterhouse Vaughan Williams found that religion meant less and less to him , and for a while he was an atheist . This softened into " a cheerful agnosticism " , and he continued to attend church regularly to avoid upsetting the family . His views on religion did not affect his love of the Authorised Version of the Bible , the beauty of which , in the words of Ursula Vaughan Williams in her 1964 biography of the composer , remained " one of his essential companions through life . " In this , as in many other things in his life , he was , according to his biographer Michael Kennedy , " that extremely English product the natural nonconformist with a conservative regard for the best tradition " . 
 = = = Royal College of Music and Trinity , Cambridge = = = 
 In July 1890 Vaughan Williams left Charterhouse and in September he was enrolled as a student at the Royal College of Music ( RCM ) , London . After a compulsory course in harmony with Francis Edward Gladstone , professor of organ , counterpoint and harmony , he studied organ with Walter Parratt and composition with Hubert Parry . He idolised Parry , and recalled in his Musical Autobiography ( 1950 ) : 
 Parry once said to me : " Write choral music as befits an Englishman and a democrat " . We pupils of Parry have , if we have been wise , inherited from him the great English choral tradition , which Tallis passed on to Byrd , Byrd to Gibbons , Gibbons to Purcell , Purcell to <unk> and Greene , and they in their turn through the Wesleys , to Parry . He has passed on the torch to us and it is our duty to keep it alight . 
 Vaughan Williams 's family would have preferred him to have remained at Charterhouse for two more years and then go on to Cambridge University . They were not convinced that he was talented enough to pursue a musical career , but feeling it would be wrong to prevent him from trying , they had allowed him to go to the RCM . Nevertheless , a university education was expected of him , and in 1892 he temporarily left the RCM and entered Trinity College , Cambridge , where he spent three years , studying music and history . 
 Among those with whom Vaughan Williams became friendly at Cambridge were the philosophers G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell , the historian G. M. Trevelyan and the musician Hugh Allen . He felt intellectually overshadowed by some of his companions , but he learned much from them and formed lifelong friendships with several . Among the women with whom he mixed socially at Cambridge was Adeline Fisher , the daughter of Herbert Fisher , an old friend of the Vaughan Williams family . She and Vaughan Williams grew close , and in June 1897 , after he had left Cambridge , they became engaged to be married . 
 During his time at Cambridge Vaughan Williams continued his weekly lessons with Parry , and studied composition with Charles Wood and organ with Alan Gray . He graduated as Bachelor of Music in 1894 and Bachelor of Arts the following year . After leaving the university he returned to complete his training at the RCM . Parry had by then succeeded Sir George Grove as director of the college , and Vaughan Williams 's new professor of composition was Charles Villiers Stanford . Relations between teacher and student were stormy . Stanford , who had been adventurous in his younger days , had grown deeply conservative ; he clashed vigorously with his modern @-@ minded pupil . Vaughan Williams had no wish to follow in the traditions of Stanford 's idols , Brahms and Wagner , and he stood up to his teacher as few students dared to do . Beneath Stanford 's bluster lay a recognition of Vaughan Williams 's talent and a desire to help the young man correct his opaque orchestration and extreme predilection for modal music . 
 In his second spell at the RCM ( 1895 – 96 ) Vaughan Williams got to know a fellow student , Gustav Holst , who became a lifelong friend . Stanford emphasised the need for his students to be self @-@ critical , but Vaughan Williams and Holst became , and remained , one another 's most valued critic ; each would play his latest composition to the other while still working on it . Vaughan Williams later observed , " What one really learns from an Academy or College is not so much from one 's official teachers as from one 's fellow @-@ students ... [ we discussed ] every subject under the sun from the lowest note of the double bassoon to the philosophy of Jude the Obscure " . In 1949 he wrote of their relationship , " Holst declared that his music was influenced by that of his friend : the converse is certainly true . " 
 = = = Early career = = = 
 Vaughan Williams had a modest private income , which in his early career he supplemented with a variety of musical activities . Although the organ was not his preferred instrument , the only post he ever held for an annual salary was as a church organist and choirmaster . He held the position at St Barnabas , in the inner London district of South Lambeth , from 1895 to 1899 for a salary of £ 50 a year . He disliked the job , but working closely with a choir was valuable experience for his later undertakings . 
 In October 1897 Adeline and Vaughan Williams were married . They honeymooned for several months in Berlin , where he studied with Max Bruch . On their return they settled in London , originally in Westminster and , from 1905 , in Chelsea . There were no children of the marriage . 
 In 1899 Vaughan Williams passed the examination for the degree of Doctor of Music at Cambridge ; the title was formally conferred on him in 1901 . The song " Linden Lea " became the first of his works to appear in print , published in the magazine The Vocalist in April 1902 and then as separate sheet music . In addition to composition he occupied himself in several capacities during the first decade of the century . He wrote articles for musical journals and for the second edition of Grove 's Dictionary of Music and Musicians , edited the first volume of Purcell 's Welcome Songs for the Purcell Society , and was for a while involved in adult education in the University Extension Lectures . From 1904 to 1906 he was music editor of a new hymn @-@ book , The English Hymnal , of which he later said , " I now know that two years of close association with some of the best ( as well as some of the worst ) tunes in the world was a better musical education than any amount of sonatas and fugues " . Always committed to music @-@ making for the whole community , he helped found the amateur Leith Hill Music Festival in 1905 , and was appointed its principal conductor , a post he held until 1953 . 
 In 1903 – 04 Vaughan Williams started collecting folk @-@ songs . He had always been interested in them , and now followed the example of a recent generation of enthusiasts such as Cecil Sharp and Lucy Broadwood in going into the English countryside noting down and transcribing songs traditionally sung in various locations . Collections of the songs were published , preserving many that could otherwise have vanished as oral traditions died out . Vaughan Williams incorporated some into his own compositions , and more generally was influenced by their prevailing modal forms . This , together with his love of Tudor and Stuart music , helped shape his compositional style for the rest of his career . 
 Over this period Vaughan Williams composed steadily , producing songs , choral music , chamber works and orchestral pieces , gradually finding the beginnings of his mature style . His compositions included the tone poem In the Fen Country ( 1904 ) and the Norfolk Rhapsody No. 1 ( 1906 ) . He remained unsatisfied with his technique as a composer . After unsuccessfully seeking lessons from Sir Edward Elgar , he contemplated studying with Vincent d 'Indy in Paris . Instead , he was introduced by the critic and musicologist M. D. Calvocoressi to Maurice Ravel , a more modernist , less dogmatic musician than d 'Indy . 
 = = = Ravel ; rising fame ; First World War = = = 
 Ravel took few pupils , and was known as a demanding taskmaster for those he agreed to teach . Vaughan Williams spent three months in Paris in the winter of 1907 – 08 , working with him four or five times each week . There is little documentation of Vaughan Williams 's time with Ravel ; the musicologist Byron Adams advises caution in relying on Vaughan Williams 's recollections in the Musical Autobiography written forty @-@ three years after the event . The degree to which the French composer influenced the Englishman 's style is debated . Ravel declared Vaughan Williams to be " my only pupil who does not write my music " ; nevertheless , commentators including Kennedy , Adams , Hugh Ottaway and Alain Frogley find Vaughan Williams 's instrumental textures lighter and sharper in the music written after his return from Paris , such as the String Quartet in G minor , On Wenlock Edge , the Overture to The Wasps and A Sea Symphony . Vaughan Williams himself said that Ravel had helped him escape from " the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner " . 
 In the years between his return from Paris in 1908 and the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 , Vaughan Williams increasingly established himself as a figure in British music . For a rising composer it was important to receive performances at the big provincial music festivals , which generated publicity and royalties . In 1910 his music featured at two of the largest and most prestigious festivals , with the premieres of the Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis at the Three Choirs Festival in Gloucester Cathedral in September and A Sea Symphony at the Leeds Festival the following month . The leading British music critics of the time , J. A. Fuller Maitland of The Times and Samuel Langford of The Manchester Guardian , were strong in their praise . The former wrote of the fantasia , " The work is wonderful because it seems to lift one into some unknown region of musical thought and feeling . Throughout its course one is never sure whether one is listening to something very old or very new " . Langford declared that the symphony " definitely places a new figure in the first rank of our English composers " . Between these successes and the start of war Vaughan Williams 's largest @-@ scale work was the first version of A London Symphony ( 1914 ) . In the same year he wrote The Lark Ascending in its original form for violin and piano . 
 Despite his age — he was forty @-@ two in 1914 — Vaughan Williams volunteered for military service on the outbreak of the First World War . Joining the Royal Army Medical Corps as a private , he drove ambulance wagons in France and later in Greece . Frogley writes of this period that Vaughan Williams was considerably older than most of his comrades , and " the back @-@ breaking labour of dangerous night @-@ time journeys through mud and rain must have been more than usually punishing " . The war left its emotional mark on Vaughan Williams , who lost many comrades and friends , including the young composer George Butterworth . In 1917 Vaughan Williams was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal Artillery , seeing action in France from March 1918 . The continual noise of the guns damaged his hearing , and led to deafness in his later years . After the armistice in 1918 he served as director of music for the British First Army until demobilised in February 1919 . 
 = = = Inter @-@ war years = = = 
 During the war Vaughan Williams stopped writing music , and after returning to civilian life he took some time before feeling ready to compose new works . He revised some earlier pieces , and turned his attention to other musical activities . In 1919 he accepted an invitation from Hugh Allen , who had succeeded Parry as director , to teach composition at the RCM ; he remained on the faculty of the college for the next twenty years . In 1921 he succeeded Allen as conductor of the Bach Choir , London . It was not until 1922 that he produced a major new composition , A Pastoral Symphony ; the work was given its first performance in London in May conducted by Adrian Boult and its American premiere in New York in December conducted by the composer . 
 Throughout the 1920s Vaughan Williams continued to compose , conduct and teach . Kennedy lists forty works premiered during the decade , including the Mass in G minor ( 1922 ) , the ballet Old King Cole ( 1923 ) , the operas Hugh the Drover and Sir John in Love ( 1924 and 1928 ) , the suite Flos Campi ( 1925 ) and the oratorio Sancta Civitas ( 1925 ) . 
 During the decade Adeline became increasingly immobilised by arthritis , and the numerous stairs in their London house finally caused the Vaughan Williamses to move in 1929 to a more manageable home , " The White Gates " , Dorking , where they lived until Adeline 's death in 1951 . Vaughan Williams , who thought of himself as a complete Londoner , was sorry to leave the capital , but his wife was anxious to live in the country , and Dorking was within reasonably convenient reach of town . 
 In 1932 Vaughan Williams was elected president of the English Folk Dance and Song Society . From September to December of that year he was in the US as a visiting lecturer at Bryn Mawr College , Pennsylvania . The texts of his lectures were published under the title National Music in 1934 ; they sum up his artistic and social credo more fully than anything he had published previously , and remained in print for most of the remainder of the century . 
 During the 1930s Vaughan Williams came to be regarded as a leading figure in British music , particularly after the deaths of Elgar , Delius and Holst in 1934 . Holst 's death was a severe personal and professional blow to Vaughan Williams ; the two had been each other 's closest friends and musical advisers since their college days . After Holst 's death Vaughan Williams was glad of the advice and support of other friends including Boult and the composer Gerald Finzi , but his relationship with Holst was irreplaceable . 
 In some of Vaughan Williams 's music of the 1930s there is an explicitly dark , even violent tone . The ballet Job : A Masque for Dancing ( 1930 ) and the Fourth Symphony ( 1935 ) surprised the public and critics . The discordant and violent tone of the symphony , written at a time of growing international tension , led many critics to suppose the symphony to be programmatic . Hubert Foss dubbed it " The Romantic " and Frank Howes called it " The Fascist " . The composer dismissed such interpretations , and insisted that the work was absolute music , with no programme of any kind ; nonetheless , some of those close to him , including Foss and Boult , remained convinced that something of the troubled spirit of the age was captured in the work . 
 As the decade progressed , Vaughan Williams found musical inspiration lacking , and experienced his first fallow period since his wartime musical silence . After his anti @-@ war cantata Dona nobis pacem in 1936 he did not complete another work of substantial length until late in 1941 , when the first version of the Fifth Symphony was completed . 
 In 1938 Vaughan Williams met Ursula Wood ( 1911 – 2007 ) , the wife of an army officer , Captain ( later Lieutenant @-@ Colonel ) Michael Forrester Wood . She was a poet , and had approached the composer with a proposed scenario for a ballet . Despite their both being married , and a four @-@ decade age @-@ gap , they fell in love almost from their first meeting ; they maintained a secret love affair for more than a decade . Ursula became the composer 's muse , helper and London companion , and later helped him care for his ailing wife . Whether Adeline knew , or suspected , that Ursula and Vaughan Williams were lovers is uncertain , but the relations between the two women were of warm friendship throughout the years they knew each other . The composer 's concern for his first wife never faltered , according to Ursula , who admitted in the 1980s that she had been jealous of Adeline , whose place in Vaughan Williams 's life and affections was unchallengeable . 
 = = = 1939 – 52 = = = 
 During the Second World War Vaughan Williams was active in civilian war work , chairing the Home Office Committee for the Release of <unk> Alien Musicians , helping Myra Hess with the organisation of the daily National Gallery concerts , serving on a committee for refugees from Nazi oppression , and on the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts ( CEMA ) , the forerunner of the Arts Council . In 1940 he composed his first film score , for the propaganda film 49th Parallel . 
 In 1942 Michael Wood died suddenly of heart failure . At Adeline 's behest the widowed Ursula was invited to stay with the Vaughan Williamses in Dorking , and thereafter was a regular visitor there , sometimes staying for weeks at a time . The critic Michael White suggests that Adeline " appears , in the most amicable way , to have adopted Ursula as her successor " . Ursula recorded that during air raids all three slept in the same room in adjacent beds , holding hands for comfort . 
 In 1943 Vaughan Williams conducted the premiere of his Fifth Symphony at the Proms . Its serene tone contrasted with the stormy Fourth , and led some commentators to think it a symphonic valediction . William Glock wrote that it was " like the work of a distinguished poet who has nothing very new to say , but says it in exquisitely flowing language " . The music Vaughan Williams wrote for the BBC to celebrate the end of the war , Thanksgiving for Victory , was marked by what the critic Edward Lockspeiser called the composer 's characteristic avoidance of " any suggestion of rhetorical <unk> " . Any suspicion that the septuagenarian composer had settled into benign tranquillity was dispelled by his Sixth Symphony ( 1948 ) , described by the critic Gwyn Parry @-@ Jones as " one of the most disturbing musical statements of the 20th century " , opening with a " primal scream , plunging the listener immediately into a world of aggression and impending chaos . " Coming as it did near the start of the Cold War , many critics thought its pianissimo last movement a depiction of a nuclear @-@ scorched wasteland . The composer was dismissive of programmatic theories : " It never seems to occur to people that a man might just want to write a piece of music . " 
 In 1951 Adeline died , aged eighty . In the same year Vaughan Williams 's last opera , The Pilgrim 's Progress , was staged at Covent Garden as part of the Festival of Britain . He had been working intermittently on a musical treatment of John Bunyan 's allegory for forty @-@ five years , and the 1951 " morality " was the final result . The reviews were respectful , but the work did not catch the opera @-@ going public 's imagination , and the Royal Opera House 's production was " insultingly half @-@ hearted " according to Frogley . The piece was revived the following year , but was still not a great success . Vaughan Williams commented to Ursula , " They don 't like it , they won 't like it , they don 't want an opera with no heroine and no love duets — and I don 't care , it 's what I meant , and there it is . " 
 = = = Second marriage and last years = = = 
 In February 1953 Vaughan Williams and Ursula were married . He left the Dorking house and they took a lease of 10 Hanover Terrace , Regent 's Park , London . It was the year of Queen Elizabeth 's coronation ; Vaughan Williams 's contribution was an arrangement of the Old Hundredth psalm tune , and a new setting of " O taste and see " from Psalm 34 , performed at the service in Westminster Abbey . 
 Having returned to live in London , Vaughan Williams , with Ursula 's encouragement , became much more active socially and in pro bono <unk> activities . He was a leading figure in the Society for the Promotion of New Music , and in 1954 he set up and endowed the Vaughan Williams Trust to support young composers and promote new or neglected music . He and his wife travelled extensively in Europe , and in 1954 he visited the US once again , having been invited to lecture at Cornell and other universities and to conduct . He received an enthusiastic welcome from large audiences , and was overwhelmed at the warmth of his reception . Kennedy describes it as " like a musical state occasion " . 
 Of Vaughan Williams 's works from the 1950s , Grove makes particular mention of Three Shakespeare Songs ( 1951 ) for unaccompanied chorus , the Christmas cantata <unk> ( 1953 – 4 ) , the Violin Sonata , and , most particularly , the Ten Blake Songs ( 1957 ) for voice and oboe , " a masterpiece of economy and precision " . Unfinished works from the decade were a cello concerto and a new opera , Thomas the Rhymer . The predominant works of the 1950s were his three last symphonies . The seventh — officially unnumbered , and titled Sinfonia antartica — divided opinion ; the score is a reworking of music Vaughan Williams had written for the 1948 film Scott of the Antarctic , and some critics thought it not truly symphonic . The Eighth , though wistful in parts , is predominantly lighthearted in tone ; it was received enthusiastically at its premiere in 1956 , given by the Hallé Orchestra under the dedicatee , Sir John Barbirolli . The Ninth , premiered at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent in April 1958 , puzzled critics with its sombre , questing tone , and did not immediately achieve the recognition it later gained . 
 Having been in excellent health , Vaughan Williams died suddenly in the early hours of 26 August 1958 at Hanover Terrace . Two days later , after a private funeral at Golder 's Green , he was cremated . On 19 September , at a crowded memorial service , the ashes were interred near the burial plots of Purcell and Stanford in the north choir aisle of Westminster Abbey . 
 = = Music = = 
 Michael Kennedy characterises Vaughan Williams 's music as a strongly individual blending of the modal harmonies familiar from folk ‐ song with the French influence of Ravel and Debussy . The basis of his work is melody , his rhythms , in Kennedy 's view , being unsubtle at times . Vaughan Williams 's music is often described as visionary ; Kennedy cites the masque Job and the Fifth and Ninth Symphonies . Vaughan Williams 's output was prolific and wide ranging . For the voice he composed songs , operas , and choral works ranging from simpler pieces suitable for amateurs to demanding works for professional choruses . His comparatively few chamber works are not among his better known compositions . Some of his finest works elude conventional categorisation , such as the Serenade to Music ( 1938 ) for sixteen solo singers and orchestra ; Flos Campi ( 1925 ) for solo viola , small orchestra , and small chorus ; and his most important chamber work , in Howes 's view — not purely instrumental but a song cycle — On Wenlock Edge ( 1909 ) with accompaniment for string quartet and piano . 
 In 1955 the authors of The Record Guide , Edward Sackville @-@ West and Desmond Shawe @-@ Taylor , wrote that Vaughan Williams 's music showed an exceptionally strong individual voice : Vaughan Williams 's style is " not remarkable for grace or politeness or inventive colour " , but expresses " a consistent vision in which thought and feeling and their equivalent images in music never fall below a certain high level of natural distinction " . They commented that the composer 's vision is expressed in two main contrasting moods : " the one contemplative and trance @-@ like , the other pugnacious and sinister " . The first mood , generally predominant in the composer 's output , was more popular , as audiences , preferred " the stained @-@ glass beauty of the Tallis Fantasia , the direct melodic appeal of the Serenade to Music , the pastoral poetry of The Lark Ascending , and the grave serenity of the Fifth Symphony " . By contrast , as in the ferocity of the Fourth and Sixth Symphonies and the Concerto for Two Pianos : " in his grimmer moods Vaughan Williams can be as frightening as Sibelius and Bartók " . 
 = = = Symphonies = = = 
 It is as a symphonist that Vaughan Williams is best known . The composer and academic Elliott Schwartz wrote ( 1964 ) , " It may be said with truth that Vaughan Williams , Sibelius and <unk> are the symphonists of this century " . Although Vaughan Williams did not complete the first of them until he was thirty @-@ eight years old , the nine symphonies span nearly half a century of his creative life . In his 1964 analysis of the nine , Schwartz found it striking that no two of the symphonies are alike , either in structure or in mood . Commentators have found it useful to consider the nine in three groups of three — early , middle and late . 
 = = = = Sea , London and Pastoral Symphonies ( 1910 – 1922 ) = = = = 
 The first three symphonies , to which Vaughan Williams assigned titles rather than numbers , form a sub @-@ group within the nine , having programmatic elements , absent from the later six . A Sea Symphony ( 1910 ) , the only one of the series to include a part for full choir , differs from most earlier choral symphonies in that the choir sings in all the movements . The extent to which it is a true symphony has been debated ; in a 2013 study , Alain Frogley describes it as a hybrid work , with elements of symphony , oratorio and cantata . Its sheer length — about eighty minutes — was unprecedented for an English symphonic work , and within its thoroughly tonal construction it contains harmonic dissonances that pre @-@ echo the early works of Stravinsky which were soon to follow . 
 A London Symphony ( 1911 – 13 ) which the composer later observed might more accurately be called a " symphony by a Londoner " , is for the most part not overtly pictorial in its presentation of London . Vaughan Williams insisted that it is " self @-@ expressive , and must stand or fall as ' absolute ' music " . There are some references to the urban soundscape : brief impressions of street music , with the sound of the barrel organ mimicked by the orchestra ; the characteristic chant of the lavender @-@ seller ; the jingle of hansom cabs ; and the chimes of Big Ben played by harp and clarinet . But commentators have heard — and the composer never denied or confirmed — some social comment in sinister echoes at the end of the scherzo and an orchestral outburst of pain and despair at the opening of the finale . Schwartz comments that the symphony , in its " unified presentation of widely heterogeneous elements " , is " very much like the city itself " . Vaughan Williams said in his later years that this was his favourite of the symphonies . 
 The last of the first group is A Pastoral Symphony ( 1921 ) . The first three movements are for orchestra alone ; a wordless solo soprano voice is added in the finale . Despite the title the symphony draws little on the folk @-@ songs beloved of the composer , and the pastoral landscape evoked is not a tranquil English scene , but the French countryside ravaged by war . Some English musicians who had not fought in the First World War misunderstood the work and heard only the slow tempi and quiet tone , failing to notice the character of a requiem in the music and mistaking the piece for a rustic idyll . Kennedy comments that it was not until after the Second World War that " the spectral ' Last Post ' in the second movement and the girl 's lamenting voice in the finale " were widely noticed and understood . 
 = = = = Symphonies 4 – 6 ( 1935 – 48 ) = = = = 
 The middle three symphonies are purely orchestral , and generally conventional in form , with sonata form ( modified in places ) , specified home keys , and four @-@ movement structure . The orchestral forces required are not large by the standards of the first half of the 20th century , although the Fourth calls for an augmented woodwind section and the Sixth includes a part for tenor saxophone . The Fourth Symphony ( 1935 ) astonished listeners with its striking dissonance , far removed from the prevailing quiet tone of the previous symphony . The composer firmly contradicted any notions that the work was <unk> in any respect , and Kennedy calls attempts to give the work " a meretricious programme [ ... ] a poor compliment to its musical vitality and self @-@ sufficiency " . 
 The Fifth Symphony ( 1943 ) was in complete contrast to its predecessor . Vaughan Williams had been working on and off for many years on his operatic version of Bunyan 's The Pilgrim 's Progress . Fearing — wrongly as it turned out — that the opera would never be completed , Vaughan Williams reworked some of the music already written for it into a new symphony . Despite the internal tensions caused by the deliberate conflict of modality in places , the work is generally serene in character , and was particularly well received for the comfort it gave at a time of all @-@ out war . Neville Cardus later wrote , " The Fifth Symphony contains the most <unk> and consoling music of our time . " 
 With the Sixth Symphony ( 1948 ) Vaughan Williams once again confounded expectations . Many had seen the Fifth , composed when he was seventy , as a valedictory work , and the turbulent , troubled Sixth came as a shock . After violent orchestral clashes in the first movement , the obsessive ostinato of the second and the " diabolic " scherzo , the finale perplexed many listeners . Described as " one of the strangest journeys ever undertaken in music " , it is marked pianissimo throughout its 10 – 12 @-@ minute duration . 
 = = = = Sinfonia antartica , Symphonies 8 and 9 ( 1952 – 57 ) = = = = 
 The seventh symphony , the Sinfonia antartica ( 1952 ) , a by @-@ product of the composer 's score for Scott of the Antarctic , has consistently divided critical opinion on whether it can be properly classed as a symphony . Alain Frogley in Grove argues that though the work can make a deep impression on the listener , it is neither a true symphony in the understood sense of the term nor a tone poem and is consequently the least successful of the mature symphonies . The work is in five movements , with wordless vocal lines for female chorus and solo soprano in the first and last movements . In addition to large woodwind and percussion sections the score features a prominent part for wind machine . 
 The Eighth Symphony ( 1956 ) in D minor is noticeably different from its seven predecessors by virtue of its brevity and , despite its minor key , its general light @-@ heartedness . The orchestra is smaller than for most of the symphonies , with the exception of the percussion section , which is particularly large , with , as Vaughan Williams put it , " all the ' phones ' and ' <unk> ' known to the composer " . The work was enthusiastically received at its early performances , and has remained among Vaughan Williams 's most popular works . 
 The final symphony , the Ninth , was completed in late 1957 and premiered in April 1958 , four months before the composer 's death . It is scored for a large orchestra , including three saxophones , a flugelhorn , and an enlarged percussion section . The mood is more sombre than that of the Eighth ; Grove calls its mood " at once heroic and contemplative , defiant and wistfully absorbed " . The work received an ovation at its premiere , but at first the critics were not sure what to make of it , and it took some years for it to be generally ranked alongside its eight predecessors . 
 = = = Other orchestral music = = = 
 Grove lists more than thirty works by Vaughan Williams for orchestra or band over and above the symphonies . They include two of his most popular works — the Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis ( 1910 , revised 1919 ) , and The Lark Ascending , originally for violin and piano ( 1914 ) ; orchestrated 1920 . Other works that survive in the repertoire in Britain are the Norfolk Rhapsody No 1 ( 1905 – 06 ) , The Wasps , Aristophanic suite — particularly the overture ( 1909 ) , the English Folk Song Suite ( 1923 ) and the Fantasia on Greensleeves ( 1934 ) . 
 Vaughan Williams wrote four concertos : for violin ( 1925 ) , piano ( 1926 ) , oboe ( 1944 ) and tuba ( 1954 ) ; another concertante piece is his Romance for harmonica , strings and piano ( 1951 ) . None of these works have rivalled the popularity of the symphonies or the short orchestral works mentioned above . Bartók was among the admirers of the Piano Concerto , written for and championed by Harriet Cohen , but it has remained , in the words of the critic Andrew <unk> , a neglected masterpiece . 
 In addition to the music for Scott of the Antarctic , Vaughan Williams composed incidental music for eleven other films , from 49th Parallel ( 1941 ) to The Vision of William Blake ( 1957 ) . 
 = = = Chamber and instrumental = = = 
 By comparison with his output in other genres , Vaughan Williams 's music for chamber ensembles and solo instruments forms a small part of his oeuvre . Grove lists twenty @-@ four pieces under the heading " Chamber and instrumental " ; three are early , unpublished works . Vaughan Williams , like most leading British 20th @-@ century composers , was not drawn to the solo piano and wrote little for it . From his mature years , there survive for standard chamber groupings two string quartets ( 1908 – 09 , revised 1921 ; and 1943 – 44 ) , a " phantasy " string quintet ( 1912 ) , and a sonata for violin and piano ( 1954 ) . The first quartet was written soon after Vaughan Williams 's studies in Paris with Ravel , whose influence is strongly evident . In 2002 the magazine Gramophone described the second quartet as a masterpiece that should be , but is not , part of the international chamber repertory . It is from the same period as the Sixth Symphony , and has something of that work 's severity and anguish . The quintet ( 1912 ) was written two years after the success of the Tallis Fantasia , with which it has elements in common , both in terms of instrumental layout and the mood of rapt contemplation . The violin sonata has made little impact .

 Ursula Vaughan Williams wrote of her husband 's love of literature , and listed some of his favourite writers and writings : 
 From Skelton and Chaucer , Sidney , Spenser , the Authorised Version of the Bible , the madrigal poets , the anonymous poets , to Shakespeare — inevitably and devotedly — on to Herbert and his contemporaries , Milton , Bunyan , and Shelley , Tennyson , Swinburne , both <unk> , Whitman , Barnes , Hardy and Housman . 
 In addition to his love of poetry , Vaughan Williams 's vocal music is inspired by his lifelong belief that the voice " can be made the medium of the best and deepest human emotion . " 
 = = = = Songs = = = = 
 Between the mid @-@ 1890s and the late 1950s Vaughan Williams set more than eighty poems for voice and piano accompaniment . The earliest to survive is " A Cradle Song " , to Coleridge 's words , from about 1894 . The songs include many that have entered the repertory , such as " Linden Lea " ( 1902 ) , " Silent Noon " ( 1904 ) and the song cycles Songs of Travel ( 1905 and 1907 ) and On Wenlock Edge . To Vaughan Williams the human voice was " the oldest and greatest of musical instruments " . He described his early songs as " more or less simple and popular in character " , and the musicologist Sophie Fuller describes this simplicity and popularity as consistent throughout his career . Many composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries wrote sentimental works for female voice ; by contrast , songs by Vaughan Williams 's songs such as " The Vagabond " from Songs of Travel , to words by Robert Louis Stevenson , are " a particularly masculine breath of fresh air " ( Fuller ) , " virile open @-@ air verses " ( Kennedy ) . Some of Vaughan Williams 's later songs are less well known ; Fuller singles out the cycle Three Poems by Walt Whitman , a largely dark work , as too often overlooked by singers and critics . For some of his songs the composer expands the accompaniment to include two or more string instruments in addition to the piano ; they include On Wenlock Edge , and the Chaucer cycle Merciless Beauty ( 1921 ) , judged by an anonymous contemporary critic as " surely among the best of modern English songs " . 
 = = = = Choral music = = = = 
 Despite his agnosticism Vaughan Williams composed many works for church performance . His two best known hymn tunes , both from c . 1905 , are " Down <unk> " to the words " Come Down , O Love Divine " , and " Sine nomine " " For All the Saints " . Grove lists a dozen more , composed between 1905 and 1935 . The other church works include a Magnificat and Nunc <unk> ( 1925 ) , a Mass ( 1920 – 21 ) and a Te Deum ( 1928 ) . 
 Vaughan Williams 's choral works for concert performance include settings of both secular and religious words . The former include Toward the Unknown Region to words by Whitman ( composed 1904 – 06 ) , Five Tudor Portraits , words by John Skelton ( 1935 ) , and the Shakespearean Serenade to Music ( in its alternative version for chorus and orchestra , 1938 ) . Choral pieces with religious words include the oratorio Sancta Civitas ( 1923 – 25 ) and the Christmas cantata <unk> ( 1954 ) . In 1953 the composer said that of his choral works Sancta Civitas was his favourite . The Dona Nobis Pacem , an impassioned anti @-@ war cantata ( 1936 ) is a combination of both , with words from Whitman and others juxtaposed with extracts from the Latin mass , anticipating a similar mixture of sacred and secular text in Britten 's War Requiem twenty @-@ five years later . 
 = = = Stage works = = = 
 Vaughan Williams was wary of conventional labels ; his best known ballet is described on the title page as " a masque for dancing " and only one of his operatic works is categorised by the composer simply as an opera . For some of his theatre pieces that could be classed as operas or ballets , he preferred the terms " masque " , " romantic extravaganza " , " play set to music " , or " morality " . 
 In a 2013 survey of Vaughan Williams 's stage works , Eric Saylor writes , " With the possible exception of Tchaikovsky , no composer 's operatic career was less emblematic of his success elsewhere . " Although Vaughan Williams was a regular opera @-@ goer , enthusiastic and knowledgeable about works by operatic masters from Mozart to Wagner and Verdi , his success in the operatic field was at best patchy . There is widespread agreement among commentators that this was partly due to the composer 's poor choice of librettists for some , though not all , of his operas . Another problem was his keenness to encourage amateurs and student groups , which sometimes led to the staging of his operas with less than professional standards . A further factor was the composer 's expressed preference for " slow , long tableaux " , which tended to reduce dramatic impact , although he believed them essential , as " music takes a long time to speak — much longer than words by themselves . " 
 Hugh the Drover , or Love in the Stocks ( completed 1919 , premiere 1924 ) has a libretto , by the writer and theatre critic Harold Child , which was described by The Stage as " replete with folksy , Cotswold village archetypes " . In the view of the critic Richard <unk> the piece is a cross between traditional ballad opera and the works of Puccini and Ravel , " with rhapsodic results . " The score uses genuine and pastiche folk songs but ends with a passionate love duet that <unk> considers has few equals in English opera . Its first performance was by students at the Royal College of Music , and the work is rarely staged by major professional companies . 
 Old King Cole ( 1923 ) is a humorous ballet . The score , which makes liberal use of folk @-@ song melodies , was thought by critics to be strikingly modern when first heard . Kennedy comments that the music " is not a major work but it is fun . " The piece has not been seen frequently since its premiere , but was revived in a student production at the RCM in 1937 . 
 On Christmas Night ( 1926 ) , a masque by Adolph Bolm and Vaughan Williams , combines singing , dancing and mime . The story is loosely based on Dickens 's A Christmas Carol . The piece was first given in Chicago by Bolm 's company ; the London premiere was in 1935 . Saylor describes the work as a " dramatic hodgepodge " which has not attracted the interest of later performers . 
 The only work that the composer designated as an opera is the comedy Sir John in Love ( 1924 – 28 ) . It is based on Shakespeare 's The Merry Wives of Windsor . Folk song is used , though more discreetly than in Hugh the Drover and the score is described by Saylor as " <unk> tuneful " . Although versions of the play had already been set by Nicolai , Verdi , and Holst , Vaughan Williams 's is distinctive for its greater emphasis on the love music rather than on the robust comedy . In 1931 , with the Leith Hill Festival in mind , the composer recast some of the music as a five @-@ section cantata , In Windsor Forest , giving the public " the plums and no cake " , as he put it . 
 The Poisoned Kiss ( 1927 – 29 , premiered in 1936 ) is a light comedy . Vaughan Williams knew the Savoy operas well , and his music for this piece was and is widely regarded as in the Sullivan vein . The words , by an inexperienced librettist , were judged to fall far short of Gilbert 's standards . Saylor sums up the critical consensus that the work is something between " a frothy romantic comedy [ and ] a satirical fairy @-@ tale " , and not quite successful in either category . 
 Job : A Masque for Dancing ( 1930 ) was the first @-@ large scale ballet by a modern British composer . Vaughan Williams 's liking for long tableaux , however disadvantageous in his operas , worked to successful effect in this ballet . The work is inspired by William Blake 's Illustrations of the Book of Job ( 1826 ) . The score is divided into nine sections and an epilogue , presenting dance interpretations of some of Blake 's engravings . The work , choreographed by Ninette de Valois , made a powerful impression at its early stagings , and has been revived by the Royal Ballet several times . Kennedy ranks the score as " one of Vaughan Williams 's mightiest achievements " , and notes that it is familiar in concert programmes , having " the stature and cohesion of a symphony . " 
 In Kennedy 's view the one @-@ act Riders to the Sea ( 1925 – 31 , premiered 1937 ) is artistically Vaughan Williams 's most successful opera ; Saylor names Sir John in Love for that distinction , but rates Riders to the Sea as one of the composer 's finest works in any genre . It is an almost verbatim setting of J. M. Synge 's 1902 play of the same name , depicting family tragedy in an Irish fishing village . Kennedy describes the score as " organized almost symphonically " with much of the thematic material developed from the brief prelude . The orchestration is subtle , and foreshadows the ghostly finale of the Sixth Symphony ; there are also pre @-@ echoes of the Sinfonia antartica in the lamenting voices of the women and in the sound of the sea . 
 The Bridal Day ( 1938 – 39 ) is a masque , to a scenario by Ursula , combining voice , mime and dance , first performed in 1953 on BBC television . Vaughan Williams later recast it a cantata , <unk> ( 1957 ) . 
 The Pilgrim 's Progress ( 1951 ) , the composer 's last opera , was the culmination of more than forty years ' intermittent work on the theme of Bunyan 's religious allegory . Vaughan Williams had written incidental music for an amateur dramatisation in 1906 , and had returned to the theme in 1921 with the one @-@ act The Shepherds of the Delectable Mountains ( finally incorporated , with amendments , into the 1951 opera ) . The work has been criticised for a preponderance of slow music and stretches lacking in dramatic action , but some commentators believe the work to be one of Vaughan Williams 's supreme achievements . Summaries of the music vary from " beautiful , if something of a stylistic jumble " ( Saylor ) to " a synthesis of Vaughan Williams 's stylistic progress over the years , from the pastoral mediation of the 1920s to the angry music of the middle symphonies and eventually the more experimental phase of the Sinfonia antartica in his last decade " ( Kennedy ) . 
 = = Recordings = = 
 Vaughan Williams conducted a handful of recordings for gramophone and radio . His studio recordings are the overture to The Wasps , and the ballet Old King Cole ( both made in 1925 ) , Dona Nobis Pacem ( 1936 ) , and the Fourth Symphony ( 1937 ) . Live concert tapings include the Serenade to Music , and the Fifth Symphony , recorded in 1951 and 1952 , respectively . There is a recording of Vaughan Williams conducting the St Matthew Passion with his Leith Hill Festival forces . In the early days of LP in the 1950s Vaughan Williams was better represented in the record catalogues than most British composers . The Record Guide ( 1955 ) contained nine pages of listings of his music on disc , compared with five for Walton , and four apiece for Elgar and Britten . 
 All the composer 's major works and many of the minor ones have been recorded . There have been numerous complete LP and CD sets of the nine symphonies , beginning with Boult 's Decca cycle of the 1950s , most of which was recorded in the composer 's presence . Although rarely staged , the operas have fared well on disc . The earliest recording of a Vaughan Williams opera was Hugh the Drover , in an abridged version conducted by Sargent in 1924 . Since the 1960s there have been stereophonic recordings of Hugh the Drover , Sir John in Love , Riders to the Sea , The Poisoned Kiss , and The Pilgrim 's Progress . Most of the orchestral recordings have been by British orchestras and conductors , but notable non @-@ British conductors who have made recordings of Vaughan Williams 's works include Herbert von Karajan , Leonard Bernstein , Leopold Stokowski , and , most frequently , André Previn , who conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in the first complete stereo cycle of the symphonies , recorded between 1967 and 1972 . Among the British conductors most closely associated with Vaughan Williams 's music on disc and in concert in the generations after Boult , Sargent and Barbirolli are Vernon Handley , Richard Hickox , Sir Mark Elder and Sir Andrew Davis . Record companies with extensive lists of Vaughan Williams recordings include EMI , Decca , Chandos , Hyperion and Naxos . 
 = = Honours and legacy = = 
 Vaughan Williams refused a knighthood at least once , and declined the post of Master of the King 's Music after Elgar 's death . The one state honour he accepted was the Order of Merit in 1935 , which confers no <unk> title : he preferred to remain " Dr Vaughan Williams " . His academic and musical honours included an honorary doctorate of music from the University of Oxford ( 1919 ) ; the Cobbett medal for services to chamber music ( 1930 ) ; the gold medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society ( 1930 ) ; the Collard life fellowship of the Worshipful Company of Musicians ( 1934 , in succession to Elgar ) ; an honorary fellowship of Trinity College , Cambridge ( 1935 ) ; the Shakespeare prize of the University of Hamburg ( 1937 ) ; the Albert medal of the Royal Society of Arts ( 1955 ) ; and the Howland memorial prize of Yale University ( 1954 ) . 
 The Royal College of Music commissioned an official portrait of the composer from Sir Gerald Kelly ( 1952 ) which hangs in the college . The Manchester Art Gallery has a bronze sculpture of Vaughan Williams by Epstein ( 1952 ) and the National Portrait Gallery ( NPG ) has drawings by Joyce Finzi ( 1947 ) and Juliet Pannett ( 1957 and 1958 ) ; versions of a bronze head of the composer by David McFall ( 1956 ) are in the NPG and at the entrance to the Music reading room of the British Library . There is a statue of Vaughan Williams in Dorking , and a bust in Chelsea Embankment Gardens , near his old house in Cheyne Walk . 
 In 1994 a group of enthusiasts founded the Ralph Vaughan Williams Society , with the composer 's widow as its president and Roy Douglas and Michael Kennedy as vice presidents . The society has sponsored and encouraged performances of the composer 's works including complete symphony cycles and a Vaughan Williams opera festival . The society has promoted premieres of neglected works , and has its own record label , Albion Records . 
 Composers of the generation after Vaughan Williams reacted against his style , which became unfashionable in influential musical circles in the 1960s ; diatonic and melodic music such as his was neglected in favour of atonal and other modernist compositions . In the 21st century this neglect has been reversed . In the fiftieth anniversary year of his death two contrasting documentary films were released : Tony Palmer 's O Thou Transcendent : The Life of Vaughan Williams and John Bridcut 's The Passions of Vaughan Williams . British audiences were prompted to reappraise the composer . The popularity of his most accessible works , particularly the Tallis Fantasia and The Lark Ascending increased , but a wide public also became aware of what a reviewer of Bridcut 's film called " a genius driven by emotion " . Among the 21st @-@ century musicians who have acknowledged Vaughan Williams 's influence on their development are John Adams , PJ Harvey , Sir Peter Maxwell Davies , Anthony Payne , Wayne Shorter , Neil Tennant and Mark @-@ Anthony Turnage . 
 After Vaughan Williams 's death , The Times summed up his legacy in a leading article : 
 [ H ] <unk> his achievement was to cut the bonds that from the times of Handel and Mendelssohn had bound England hand and foot to the Continent . He found in the Elizabethans and folk @-@ song the elements of a native English language that need no longer be spoken with a German accent , and from it he forged his own idiom . The emancipation he achieved thereby was so complete that the composers of succeeding generations like Walton and Britten had no longer need of the conscious nationalism which was Vaughan Williams 's own artistic creed . There is now an English music which can make its distinctive contribution to the comity of nations .

 Marvel Trading Card Game is a video game for the Nintendo DS , PC , and PlayStation Portable . It was developed by Vicious Cycle Software and 1st Playable Productions and published by Konami . The game is based on Upper Deck Entertainment 's Marvel Comics @-@ based collectible card game , and was released across all three platforms in several regions in 2007 . 
 Marvel Trading Card Game is a virtual card game in which the player chooses to be either a superhero or supervillain in single @-@ player mode . Multiplayer modes are also available . The game follows the rules laid out in Upper Deck 's VS System , used in card games across several franchises including Marvel , DC Comics , and Hellboy . 
 The game received mixed reviews from critics . It was considered faithful to the physical version , but reviewers commented that it was not accessible to players who weren 't already fans of collectible card games . The handheld versions were criticized for presenting a visual format inappropriate for small screens . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Marvel Trading Card Game is a collectible card game with similarities to other card games , like Magic : The Gathering . The game was designed to portray the VS System rules exactly the same as the physical version , created by baseball card manufacturer Upper Deck Entertainment . Players start each match with a premade deck of cards , from which they draw a number of cards to form a hand . Cards in the hand can be subsequently put into play , and each card represents a character or ability that is played against similar cards possessed by the opponent . 
 Matches are formatted into segmented turns during which players can act . Each turn a player draws two cards to add to their hand , and cards in a hand can be put onto the playing field . The playing field is made of up individual rows where cards can be placed ; there are six rows for each player . Cards are played by spending " resource points " which act as a form of energy . The more powerful a card is , the more resource points are required to play it . Resource points are gained by specifically assigning any card in the hand to a resource row , and only one card can be made into a resource each turn . More powerful cards , such as Magneto , require a higher available pool of resources and so can only be played in later turns in a match . Once put into play from the player 's hand , a card can be used to provide a benefit to the player or to attack the opponent . Types of cards include characters , such as Onslaught and <unk> ; each character has an attack and defense rating that represents how much damage they can inflict and sustain . Other cards include locations and equipment , which can be used to boost the statistics and abilities of characters , and " plot twists " which encompass a wide range of effects , such as forcing an opponent to forfeit some of the cards in their hand . Each player has a life bar that is depleted with each successful attack by an opponent , and a player loses the match when their life bar is empty . 
 Whenever a card in play is activated or otherwise used , such as resources , it is referred to as " tapped " and is generally unavailable for further use until the next turn . Unlike Magic , however , characters can attack and defend in the same turn , unless they are " stunned " in combat . Damage is calculated by adding the difference between an attacking character 's attack and the defending character 's defense , plus the resource cost of the card . Any damage not absorbed by a defending character is applied to the player 's life total . The location of a card on the playing field can affect its statistics ; in order to attack , characters further away from the opponent must possess a projectile weapon or the ability to fly , for instance . Adjacent characters with a matching team affiliation within the Marvel universe can also reinforce one another 's attack and defense , such as the Spider Friends and X @-@ Men . Cards activating an ability can be countered by the opponent , and these abilities and counters combine to form a " chain " that dictates the order in which their effects are applied .

 Marvel Trading Card Game 's single @-@ player mode allows the player to choose one of two different campaigns ; one for heroes and one for villains . Both campaigns are based around the Sentinels . Each campaign contains six chapters , with each chapter represented by a series of card matches . The chapters are different for heroes and villains with the exception of the final chapter .

 In August 2005 , video game publisher Konami acquired an exclusive license to make games based on Upper Deck 's Marvel collectible card game . Konami had published previous titles based on card games , such as the Yu @-@ Gi @-@ Oh ! series . Marvel Trading Card Game was formally announced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) video game convention in May 2006 . Konami explained that the game would use Upper Deck 's " VS System " rules and would be available for the DS , PSP , and PC consoles . It was to have both single @-@ player and multiplayer modes for all three systems , and the PC and PSP versions would be cross @-@ compatible . Konami promised that it would host online tournaments , complete with prizes . The PSP and PC versions were developed by Vicious Cycle Software , and the DS version was outsourced to New York @-@ based designer 1st Playable Productions . 
 From the beginning of development , Vicious Cycle wanted players on all three consoles to be able to play against each other online . This option was ultimately not implemented for the DS . Lead designer Dave Ellis said " ... development time and platform limitations didn ’ t permit our DS developers to pursue that option , so the DS version was ultimately limited to Wi @-@ Fi and online play with other DS players . " The PSP and PC versions allow players to use the same matchmaking system , and the game 's code is linked so that if one platform is patched , the other must be as well . Players with a PC can download and use the online component of the game for free . 
 The plot in the single @-@ player mode of Marvel Trading Card Game was composed by Marvel writer John Layman , and the cutscenes were drawn by comic artists like <unk> Grant and Pat <unk> . Early in the development process , the design team had considered portraying the player 's avatar as a character within the game 's story , but this idea was eventually discarded , and the game does not explain the player 's role . The plot , which revolves around the group of robotic enemies of the X @-@ Men known as Sentinels , was created because in real life , competitive play in the Marvel card game community was focused on Sentinel decks around the time of Marvel Trading Card Game 's development . Around 300 separate decks were created by the design team for the single @-@ player mode , and AI opponents use a more challenging deck if they are played against more than once . 
 The game contains over 1 @,@ 100 cards , and includes cards from select expansion sets in the physical version , like the Avengers and the Fantastic Four . PC and PSP owners can download the X @-@ Men expansion set online for free . Over four hundred characters are represented , with over a hundred as specific entries in the story mode . Artwork for cards was provided by artists such as Alex Garner and Adam Kubert . Whenever a player completes a chapter in the story mode , they are awarded a five @-@ card booster pack . The game includes a deck editor that allows players to create and modify decks as they see fit . 
 Marvel Trading Card Game was released for the PSP on February 27 , 2007 in North America , June 8 in Europe , and July 6 in Australia . The DS version was released on May 22 in North America , July 25 in Europe , and on August 3 in Australia . The PC version was released on June 8 in Europe and July 3 in North America , and included a limited edition .

 Online matchmaking and the card store were opened in tandem with the PSP version 's North American release . PC players used the same services when their version was released . The matchmaking service , the website , store , and other online features were maintained by Agora Games , a gaming company that specializes in online communities . Konami offered players sanctioned tournaments and downloadable card packs . On March 12 , 2008 , Konami announced that it was closing down the website 's forums and the online store . Matchmaking and online play would continue to be available to the public , but all cards would be made available for free to all accounts . 
 " As we pass our one year anniversary , Konami has decided to transition the site to a free service . All cards in all accounts will be made available , and we will continue the service as long as there is a strong desire for it from the community . " 
 = = Reception = = 
 Reception of Marvel Trading Card Game across all three platforms was mixed . The game was compared to other collectible card games such as Pokémon , Magic , and Munchkin . Reviewers were pleased with the game 's representation of the VS System rules , but felt that it was less accessible to players who weren 't familiar with the physical version . Several reviews referred to the gameplay as addictive ; IGN 's Hilary Goldstein said " I have to admit , I am somewhat addicted to the Marvel Trading Card Game . It 's not a great game by any measure , but it does an excellent job of tapping into the collector 's mentality of comic @-@ book fans . " 
 The game 's difficulty , especially the complexity of the VS System ruleset , was described as a potential barrier for gamers . PALGN said " Even though there are a handful of in @-@ game tutorials , they aren ’ t entirely utilised efficiently as they ’ re basically just a big slab of text making the game less friendly towards a wider audience . " GamesRadar 's Eric <unk> said " If you aren 't familiar with the source , get ready for a very steep learning curve . " One X @-@ Play reviewer commented that the game 's tutorial " might go down in history as the worst in @-@ game tutorial ever created , " and another said that gamers who would be most interested in the video game would already be avid players of the physical version . 
 On the handheld versions , many reviewers complained that Marvel Trading Card Game 's layout made it difficult to play , as there wasn 't enough room on the small screens for the playing field of a match . IGN referred to the presentation and visuals as " abysmal " . GameSpot described the game 's portrayal of plot twist chains as " an alien tax return " . The text on individual cards on the PSP version was considered difficult to read , but the DS format of holding the console sideways to play was praised . 
 Reviewers praised the gameplay options available to players , although GameZone described the story mode as " bland " and IGN called it " too long for its own good " . Multiplayer gameplay was well received . GameSpot called the multiplayer " surprisingly solid " and Pocket Gamer described the choice of online modes as " a raft of pleasing multiplayer options . " IGN said of the PSP version " Though <unk> 's single @-@ player is fairly deep and enjoyable , the focus is on multiplayer ... It 's only through the infrastructure online mode that you can access the aspects of <unk> that make it worth the $ 30 purchase . "

The three constituent episodes were split into two broadcasts ; " Part 1 " first aired on May 15 , 2008 , and " Part 2 " , serving as the two @-@ hour season finale of the fourth season , first aired on May 29 , 2008 , on ABC in the United States and on CTV in Canada . The episodes were written by executive producers / show runners Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof ; " Part 1 " was directed by co @-@ executive producer Stephen Williams , while executive producer Jack Bender directed " Part 2 " . The episode 's title is a reference to The Wonderful Wizard of Oz . 
 The narrative takes place in late December 2004 , 100 days after the crash of Oceanic Flight 815 . The survivors of the crash team up with the Others , natives of the island where the plane crashed , to confront the mercenaries from the freighter Kahana , who have come to the island . Following this , some of the survivors escape the island , which is afterwards moved by Ben Linus ( Michael Emerson ) . Flashforwards show the first actions of the Oceanic Six , those who are rescued , after returning home in January 2005 , and their lives in late 2007 . The cliffhanger from the previous season finale , " Through the Looking Glass , " is resolved by revealing John Locke ( Terry O 'Quinn ) to be dead and in the coffin that Jack Shephard ( Matthew Fox ) visits in that episode . 
 Production and broadcast of the fourth season were interrupted by the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike and following its resolution , the writers were unable to compress the remainder of season four into the five allotted episodes and the season finale was extended by one hour . Subsequently , the production schedule was compressed and post @-@ production work was completed in three weeks , instead of the usual two months . 
 The second part was watched by 12 million Americans , making Lost the most watched show of the week , for the first time in the show 's history . Both parts were met with critical acclaim . Matthew Fox 's acting in his flashforward scenes was praised , as was Michael Giacchino 's musical score . The episode 's editing was nominated for both a Primetime Emmy Award and Eddie Award .

 In flashforwards to January 2005 , the Oceanic Six — Jack Shephard , Kate Austen ( Evangeline Lilly ) , Sayid Jarrah ( Naveen Andrews ) , Sun @-@ Hwa Kwon ( Yunjin Kim ) , Hugo " Hurley " Reyes ( Jorge Garcia ) and Claire Littleton 's ( Emilie de Ravin ) infant , Aaron — arrive in Honolulu , where Hurley and Sun are reunited with their parents ; Jack with his mother ; and Sayid with his girlfriend , Nadia <unk> ( Andrea Gabriel ) . In the ensuing media circus , a press conference is held , where they lie about everything that has happened on the island , going as far as saying that they are the only living survivors of the plane crash . Sometime later , Hurley 's dad ( Cheech Marin ) gives Hurley his newly rebuilt 1970s Camaro , at a surprise birthday party . Hurley , however , becomes panicked and runs away when he notices that the car 's odometer displays the numbers . In Seoul , South Korea , Sun visits her father and informs him that she used the money from her settlement with Oceanic Airlines to buy a controlling interest in his company because she blames him for her husband 's , Jin @-@ Soo Kwon ( Daniel Dae Kim ) , death . In the final flashforward , Jack eulogizes his deceased father , Christian Shephard ( John Terry ) . After the ceremony , Carole Littleton ( Susan Duerden ) , Claire 's mother , reveals to him that Claire is his half @-@ sister . 
 On December 30 , 2004 , following the events of " Cabin Fever " , Jack and Kate follow the tracking signal on the phone given to them by Frank Lapidus ( Jeff Fahey ) , who dropped it onto the survivors ' beach from a helicopter . They encounter James " Sawyer " Ford ( Josh Holloway ) , Aaron and Miles Straume ( Ken Leung ) ; Kate returns to the beach with Miles and Aaron . Jack and Sawyer meet up with Lapidus at the helicopter , but decide to rescue Hurley , who is with Ben , the mercenaries ' target , before leaving for the freighter . Meanwhile , Sayid arrives at the beach on the freighter 's Zodiac boat and informs the survivors that they must go to the freighter as soon as possible because the mercenaries ' secondary objective is to kill everyone on the island . He and Kate go after Jack and Sawyer , but are captured by Richard Alpert ( Nestor Carbonell ) and the rest of the Others . After unsuccessfully attempting to convince his crush , Charlotte Lewis ( Rebecca Mader ) , to leave the island , Daniel Faraday ( Jeremy Davies ) starts ferrying people to the freighter . Sun , Jin , and Aaron arrive at the boat , only to discover a bomb , consisting of a large amount of C4 explosives , on board . 
 Meanwhile , in their quest to move the island , Ben , Locke and Hurley arrive at the Dharma Initiative Orchid station , which is disguised as a greenhouse . Ben sends Locke to the real part of the station and surrenders himself to Martin Keamy ( Kevin Durand ) and the other mercenaries from the Kahana , who had previously arrived . A final montage shows the Oceanic Six and Ben in their respective predicaments .

 On the island , Jack and Sawyer meet up with Hurley and Locke at the Orchid station . Jack and Locke once more argue about the nature of the island ; Locke implores him to lie about the island once he and the other survivors leave . At the helicopter , Kate , Sayid , and the Others free Ben by ambushing and killing the mercenaries , except Keamy , who feigns death . In return , the Others allow Kate , Sayid and the other survivors to leave the island on the helicopter . Ben returns to the Orchid , where he gets in a hidden elevator with Locke . 
 Inside the underground part of the Orchid station , Ben puts every metal item he can find into a small compartment at the back of the room , while Locke watches the orientation video for the Orchid . On the tape , Pierre Chang ( François Chau ) begins to discuss time travel involving " negatively charged exotic matter " when the VCR malfunctions and the tape rewinds itself . Shortly , Keamy arrives and tells Locke that if he ( Keamy ) dies , the C4 on the freighter will detonate , due to a remote trigger linked to a heart rate monitor he is wearing . Regardless , Ben kills Keamy with no remorse or sympathy for those on the boat , in order to avenge his adopted daughter Alex ( Tania Raymonde ) , whom Keamy executed . Ben seals and then activates power to the compartment he had loaded with metal items , blowing a hole in the back of it . Ben , now wearing a parka , tells Locke that whoever moves the island is forced to leave it and never come back ; Ben must do it so that Locke can stay and lead the Others . Locke then goes to the Others , who welcome him home . Ben climbs through the hole and down a rocky tunnel beyond it into a frozen chamber , cutting his arm in the process . He then turns a very large metal wheel . As he completes the rotation , an eerie sound and white @-@ yellow light soon envelop the entire island . Ben disappears , only to reappear several months later in the Sahara Desert ( as seen in " The Shape of Things to Come " ) . 
 Jack , Kate , Sayid , Sawyer , Hurley , and Frank Lapidus leave the island on the helicopter , but discover a fuel leak on board . In order to lighten the helicopter , Sawyer jumps out after whispering something in Kate 's ear and kissing her . The helicopter makes it to the Kahana in the nick of time ; they refuel it , fix the leak , pick up Desmond Hume ( Henry Ian Cusick ) , Sun and Aaron and leave seconds before the C4 detonates . The resulting explosion kills Michael Dawson ( Harold Perrineau ) , who is told that " he can go now " by a vision of Christian Shephard . The status of Jin , who is still on the boat , is left uncertain as a cliffhanger . Sawyer swims back to the island and laments the destruction of the boat with Juliet Burke ( Elizabeth Mitchell ) . The people on the helicopter decide to return to the island , but as they approach , they see the island vanish in the white @-@ yellow light . With nowhere to land , the helicopter runs out of fuel and the survivors are forced to ditch into the ocean . They drift in a rescue raft for several hours , where Hurley suggests that Locke succeeded in moving the island , but Jack disagrees . At night , the survivors are rescued by Penny Widmore ( Sonya Walger ) , Desmond 's girlfriend , with whom he is finally reunited . Jack then convinces the other survivors that they must lie about their experiences on the island , to protect those left behind . In keeping with the faked wreckage of Flight 815 found in the Java Trench , the Oceanic Six are dropped off near the island of Sumba , where they are found by local villagers . 
 In flashforwards to late 2007 , following those in " Through the Looking Glass " , Jack , Kate and Walt Lloyd ( Malcolm David Kelley ) all recount stories of being approached by Jeremy Bentham , the dead man in the coffin . Kate has a dream in which Claire tells her not to bring Aaron back to the island . In London , England , Sun confronts Charles Widmore ( Alan Dale ) , Penny 's father , who sent the Kahana to the island , and tells him that they have common interests involving the island . After finding out that Bentham is dead , Sayid breaks into the mental hospital where Hurley is staying and convinces him to go " somewhere safe " . Jack returns to the funeral parlor , where he is confronted by Ben , who says that the island will not allow Jack to return without everyone else who left joining him . This includes Jeremy Bentham 's body , who is finally revealed to be John Locke .

 The episode features the last appearance of actor Harold Perrineau , whose character Michael dies in an explosion , as a main cast member . The character of Michael was absent for the entire third season of Lost and returned midway through the fourth season in " Ji Yeon . " Perrineau was disappointed that he was brought back to the show only to be killed and that Michael does not get a chance to reunite with his son , Walt , saying , " there are all these questions about how [ the writers ] respond to black people on the show ... Walt just winds up being another fatherless child . It plays into a really big , weird stereotype and , being a black person myself , that wasn 't so interesting . " The fate of Jin , who is also on the freighter when it explodes , is left uncertain . Actor Daniel Dae Kim was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol , which prompted speculation about his future on the series , due to co @-@ stars Michelle Rodriguez ( Ana @-@ Lucia Cortez ) and Cynthia Watros ( Libby ) leaving Lost after DUI arrests . This episode also marks Malcolm David Kelley 's first appearance on the show since the third season , excepting a computer effects shot of the actor in " Meet Kevin Johnson " . Kelley 's character , Walt , was " benched " for the majority of the second and third seasons because the actor 's growth was disproportionate to the amount of time that has passed on the island . The writers got the idea to show him in flashforwards in his older form while writing " Through the Looking Glass " .

 Throughout season four , Jack and Locke have argued about the true nature of the island , whether it had supernatural powers and on how Oceanic Flight 815 crashing could be part of the survivors ' destiny . Upon witnessing the island vanish at the end of this episode , Jack finally realizes that Locke was right . Jack then takes Locke 's advice and convinces the other survivors that they must lie about the island once they are rescued . This is further emphasized by the fact that the same music is played during Jack and Locke 's conversation and when the survivors encounter Penny 's boat . Lindelof has also stated that Sawyer 's message to Kate in the helicopter is a " critical plot point " in that it ultimately leads to the end of Jack and Kate 's relationship once they return home ( as seen in " Something Nice Back Home " ) . In terms of plot structure , the main action scene of the episode , where the Others and the survivors confront the mercenaries , was deliberately placed at the beginning of " Part 2 " so that the remainder of the episode could focus on character development . Furthermore , all of the present time plotlines are interconnected by the C4 bomb on the freighter , even though the writers themselves have called the use of the bomb as a plot device " ridiculous " . It was necessary , however , in order to keep both Michael and Jin from leaving the freighter with the other survivors . 
 The final scenes of the episode , particularly Ben turning the wheel , Penny and Desmond 's reunion and the last shot of Locke in the coffin were kept secret , in order to prevent spoilers from leaking . The phrase " Frozen Donkey Wheel " was coined to describe not only the wheel that Ben turns , but also the final scene in which Locke is shown to be in the coffin . Only six people knew that Locke was in the coffin — actors Matthew Fox , Michael Emerson and Terry O 'Quinn ; writers Lindelof and Cuse and Jack Bender , the director . 
 = = = = Writers ' Strike = = = = 
 The Writers Guild of America went on strike on November 4 , 2007 after the writers had only finished the first eight episodes of the season . Show runners Lindelof and Cuse wanted to hold the eight episodes until they were able to produce more of the season , but ABC decided that the eight episodes would be aired from January to March , regardless of whether any more episodes were produced in the 2007 – 2008 season . After the resolution of the strike , ABC decided to produce five more episodes for the fourth season . This conflicted with ABC 's earlier plan to broadcast seasons four , five and six in uninterrupted blocks of sixteen episodes each . Despite this , ABC prioritized scheduling Grey 's Anatomy , Ugly Betty and Lost 's returns all for April 24 . The decision left the three unproduced episodes of season four " in the bank " to be used later in seasons five and six . 
 After the resolution of the strike , Lindelof said that the effect of the strike on the fourth season would be minimal and the season 's story arc would be completed as originally intended . However , the first draft of the second part of " There 's No Place Like Home , " was 85 pages long , approximately 30 pages longer than a typical one hour Lost script . Lindelof and Cuse found that they could not compress the second half of the season finale into one episode and actually wanted to expand it . Subsequently , the show runners went into " advanced talks " with executives at ABC and convinced them to produce one of their episodes " in the bank " , thereby extending " There 's No Place Like Home : Part 2 " to two hours . However , this caused a scheduling problem with Grey 's Anatomy and Ugly Betty , which were both already scheduled to air their season finales on May 22 , 2008 . To allow Lost to have a two @-@ hour finale , ABC moved it one week later to May 29 , 2008 and aired both parts of " There 's No Place Like Home " back @-@ to @-@ back . Ultimately , this left thirty @-@ four episodes to be split over seasons five and six , which will each have seventeen episodes . Another effect of the strike was that the backstories of the so @-@ called " freighter folk " , i.e. Faraday , Miles and Charlotte , had to be pushed back to season five . As such , the writers dropped hints to Charlotte 's backstory in " There 's No Place Like Home " . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 " There 's No Place Like Home : Part 2 " was filmed in approximately three and a half weeks ; filming concluded three weeks before the episode aired . Scenes set on the exterior of the freighter were shot on an actual freighter named Kahana . Several actors and crew members stayed aboard the freighter while filming " There 's No Place Like Home " , as well as other episodes of the fourth season . Director Jack Bender and several others became seasick after only spending a short time on board . The helicopter featured in several scenes never actually took off from or landed on the Kahana because the rotors were too large and would hit the boat if used . Instead , the rotors were added using digital effects and the helicopter was raised and lowered by a crane onto the deck of the freighter while it was docked . Filming took place during this and the footage was intercut with scenes of Michael dealing with the bomb ; thus the helicopter is never seen landing on the freighter . Other scenes set on the helicopter were shot on a soundstage in front of a green screen , where actress Yunjin Kim lost her voice from screaming . Furthermore , the first prop bomb was deemed to be too small and the amount of C4 was doubled , even though the original amount of C4 depicted was sufficient to blow up the freighter . The set for the exterior of the Orchid station was constructed in the Manoa valley on the island of Oahu , near Paradise Park , a defunct tourist attraction , which served as the Dharma Initiative Hydra station in the first few episodes of the third season . The exterior elevator for the Orchid station did not actually move and a camera trick was used to simulate movement . The scene in which Sun confronts Widmore was filmed on location , in London , because actor Alan Dale ( Widmore ) was appearing as King Arthur in Spamalot there at the time . Dale was not made aware of the plot of the episode , saying that " the wording , the title and all the headings on the scripts were changed . Only [ he ] knew they were the Lost scripts , along with the director . " Sonya Walger declared that despite being a guest star on the show since the second season 's finale , the rescue scene was the first time she had met Matthew Fox and Evangeline Lilly , as most of her scenes were either only with Henry Ian Cusick or alone . Two alternate endings were shot for the episode in order to minimize the risk of the real ending being leaked . Both versions were shown on Good Morning America on May 30 , 2008 . In the first alternate ending , Sawyer is in the coffin and in the second , Desmond is in the coffin . Overall , it took four editors approximately three weeks to edit the second part of the finale , which under normal circumstances would take two months .

 Patrick Kevin Day of the Los Angeles Times praised Michael Giacchino 's musical score , writing that " I 'm reminded of the heights of emotion this series can evoke . " Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post thought that the finale 's split and two @-@ week break was " not cool " , but asked " how brilliant was Sun 's smackdown on her bad daddy ? " . Alan Sepinwall of The Star @-@ Ledger wrote that " when Lost is at its best … it manages to balance revelations … with great character moments . I don 't know that I 'd put this one in the pantheon ( again , a lot of it was set @-@ up for … [ Parts 2 & 3 ] ) , but it was definitely in the spirit of what I love about the show . " Kristin dos Santos of E ! praised the chemistry between Naveen Andrews and Andrea Gabriel , who play Sayid and Nadia , respectively . Chris Carabott of IGN gave Part 1 of the three @-@ hour finale a 7 @.@ 9 . He commended the music and called it " a good opening to what should be an exciting season finale " ; however , the lack of suspense in favor of set @-@ up was cited as the reason for the modest rating . However , Carabott gave Parts 2 & 3 a perfect 10 review , tying with other perfect @-@ 10 episodes such as " The Constant " and " Through the Looking Glass " . He stated that " Not a moment is wasted in this brilliantly paced and well @-@ executed conclusion to what has been a fantastic season . " Dan Compora of SyFy Portal called " Part 1 " " an excellent setup episode [ with ] fast pace , important revelations , and nearly a full utilization of the cast " . Compora decided that " certain characters work much better in very small doses … a little bit of [ Hurley ] goes a long way [ and ] it was nice to see Jack featured without completely dominating an episode . " Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV summed up Part 1 as " very good " , but said that the opening flashforward in which the Oceanic Six are reunited with their families was anticlimactic and " although each flashforward scene had minor and major revelations , it felt patched together and a little sloppy , like Lindelof and Cuse had all this ground to cover in their quest to link all the action up to the final scene of season 3 … That said , the flashforward scenes all played out exceedingly well . " Daniel of TMZ welcomed the return of Richard ( on the island ) and gave the episode an " A " , saying that it had " more than a few fantastic scenes . All the flashforward scenes tonight were right on the money as far as I was concerned . " Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post " really liked this episode " and concluded that it " definitely showcased the new breath of life the fourth season gave to the show . " 
 Matthew Fox received much praise for his performance in the scene in which his character Jack reacts to the revelation that Claire is his half @-@ sister . Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post called this " brilliant acting " , while Alan Sepinwall of The Star @-@ Ledger said that " Fox played Jack 's anguish beautifully " and called this scene a contender for " Fox 's single best moment in the history of the show " . Kristin dos Santos gave Fox " mad props " and Chris Carabott of IGN said that " Fox hasn 't been given much of an opportunity to stretch his acting muscles this season but he gives a great performance [ in this scene ] . " 
 Robert Bianco of USA Today said that " a great season of Lost ended with a suitably great finale , which … ended with the … whoa @-@ inducing discovery that Locke was the man in the casket . Didn 't see that coming — and I can 't wait to see what this terrific TV series has coming next . " Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe wrote that " the episode was dynamic and busy enough as it relied heavily on action @-@ adventure … but the finale wasn 't as mind @-@ bending as [ the third ] season 's farewell , during which we received the show 's first flash @-@ forward . " Alan Sepinwall of The Star @-@ Ledger enjoyed the triple @-@ length " There 's No Place Like Home " , but ranked it in the middle of his list of the season 's episodes from best to worst and decided that " ' There 's No Place Like Home " ( both parts ) played fair with the audience 100 percent , answered [ many ] questions … and yet … I feel ever so slightly disappointed by all of this . " He also found the special effects " looked much <unk> than usual " and praised the score . Frazier Moore of the Associated Press thought that " it might be the most rewarding , deliciously challenging episode in the history of this mystical ABC serial . " Dan Compora of SyFy Portal wrote that " Part 2 " " was perhaps the most action @-@ packed , meaningful episode of television I 've watched all year . The pace was excellent , and the revelations were plentiful . " Compora also wrote that " though the pace was considerably slower , the finale delivered in a big way … it was [ not a letdown , being ] well written and well directed in its own right . "

 A. ^ Prior to being broadcast , " There 's No Place Like Home : Part 2 " was known as " There 's No Place Like Home : Parts 2 & 3 " in ABC 's press material . The home release of season four , as well as ABC 's official Lost website , refers to it as " There 's No Place Like Home : Part 2 " . Furthermore , the home release states that there are fourteen episodes in season four and " There 's No Place Like Home " is counted as three episodes . 
 = Polikarpov TIS = 
 The <unk> TIS was a heavily armed Soviet heavy fighter designed during the early 1940s . Only two prototypes were built because its intended engines proved to be too unreliable to be placed into production and the engines ' manufacturer lacked the resources to fix the problems . The second prototype crashed in September 1944 and the program was canceled after the death of Nikolai Nikolaevich Polikarpov , the chief designer of his eponymous OKB , earlier that year . 
 = = Design and development = = 
 The original request for proposals for a heavy escort fighter ( <unk> Istrebitel ' <unk> ) was received at the Polikarpov OKB in November 1938 , but the press of work with the I @-@ 180 and SPB prototypes prevented any significant design work until the third quarter of 1940 . Mikhail <unk> was appointed head designer , but his job was complicated by multiple changes in the role of the aircraft from escort fighter to interceptor , dive bomber , and eventually reconnaissance . 
 The prototype , internally designated as aircraft or TIS " A " , was a low @-@ wing , all @-@ metal , cantilever monoplane with two Mikulin AM @-@ 37 engines and a twin tail . The monocoque fuselage had four 7 @.@ 62 mm ( 0 @.@ 300 in ) ShKAS machine guns in the nose , each with 1 @,@ 000 rounds . The pilot and the gunner / radio @-@ operator were seated back @-@ to @-@ back , separated by an armor plate , under sliding canopies . The gunner had a dorsal ShKAS on a TSS @-@ 1 mount with 750 rounds that could be used once his canopy was slid forward . He also had a ventral ShKAS mounted below the armored floor that he could access by raising a hatch in the floor and kneeling down to fire the machine guns . The ventral gun was provided with 500 rounds of ammunition . A 12 @.@ 7 mm ( 0 @.@ 50 in ) UBK machine gun with 400 rounds and a 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) ShVAK cannon with 350 rounds were mounted in each wing root . Underneath the wings were two racks each capable of carrying a single 500 kg ( 1 @,@ 100 lb ) FAB @-@ 500 bomb . The wing had automatic leading edge slats and four split flaps separated by the engine nacelles . The single wheel landing gear retracted into the rear part of the nacelles , as did the tailwheel into the fuselage . 
 The ' A ' prototype first flew in September 1941 and reached a speed of 555 km / h ( 345 mph ) at 5 @,@ 800 m ( 19 @,@ 000 ft ) altitude . It suffered from a lack of directional stability and the engines were unreliable and vibrated above 5 @,@ 000 m ( 16 @,@ 000 ft ) . Factory No. 51 attempted to fix the stability problem in late September by increasing the area of the rear fins , but was unsuccessful . Flight testing continued in October in Novosibirsk , to where the LII ( Russian : <unk> @-@ <unk> институт — Flight Research Institute ) had been evacuated . Eliminating the stability problem took until March 1942 , although the engines remained as unreliable as ever . 
 By the summer of 1942 it was clear that the Mikulin OKB lacked the resources to fix the problems with the AM @-@ 37 and that the TIS would need a new engine , but the OKB 's resources were fully utilized on the I @-@ 185 and ITP programs and the TIS program was put on hold . Work did not resume on the TIS until the second half of 1943 , after the I @-@ 185 had been canceled , and the Mikulin AM @-@ 39 engine was selected . A new prototype was built , internally called the " MA " , with a completely revised armament . Two ShVAK cannon replaced the nose ShKAS machine guns and a UBT machine gun in a <unk> @-@ 1 mount replaced the dorsal ShKAS , while the ventral machine gun was removed entirely . Two 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) <unk> Sh @-@ 37 or 45 mm ( 1 @.@ 8 in ) 111P cannon replaced the wing root guns . The intended AM @-@ 39s were unavailable and therefore two Mikulin AM @-@ <unk> were used as a temporary expedient . The engine radiators were moved from the nacelles into the wings . They were fed by inlets in the leading edge and outlets on the undersurface of the wing . 
 = = Operational history = = 
 The " MA " was flight tested from June to September 1944 and generally met its expected performance figures . The engines were optimized for low altitudes and the aircraft could only reach a maximum speed of 535 km / h ( 332 mph ) and a ceiling of 6 @,@ 600 metres ( 21 @,@ 700 ft ) . It did , however , have an initial climb rate of 13 @.@ 5 m / s ( 44 ft / s ) and , on the basis of the flight tests , it was concluded that it would be capable reaching 650 km / h ( 400 mph ) at 7 @,@ 150 m ( 23 @,@ 460 ft ) and would take 6 @.@ 4 minutes to reach 5 @,@ 000 metres ( 16 @,@ 404 ft ) once the AM @-@ 39s were fitted . A brake failure on 29 June damaged the " MA " , which required a month to repair , but a crash @-@ landing on 16 September caused by the failure of the undercarriage to extend proved to be the death knell for the TIS program . The OKB was being shut down after Polikarpov 's death at the end of June and there was no one willing to champion the TIS .

 = Enter the Grave = 
 Enter the Grave is the debut album by the English thrash metal band Evile . Released on 27 August 2007 in Europe and on 25 September in North America and Japan , the album received generally favorable reviews and entered the UK Rock Chart at number 33 . It was produced by Flemming Rasmussen and recorded at Sweet Silence Studios , Copenhagen , Denmark . Rasmussen had produced three Metallica albums , which raised the profile of the album 's release . The track " Thrasher " was included on the 2008 Earache Thrash Pack , a downloadable selection of songs for the music video console game Rock Band . 
 The album 's lyrics were inspired by films scripts , recounts of the life of Countess Bathory and witch burnings .

 On 18 October 2006 , Earache Records announced that it had signed a record contract with Evile . Looking for a producer for their debut album , the band decided they would send a request by email to producer Flemming Rasmussen " for a laugh " ; Rasmussen had previously produced three Metallica albums ; 1984 's Ride the Lightning , 1986 's Master of Puppets , and 1988 's ... And Justice for All . Lead vocalist / rhythm guitarist Matt Drake typed Rasmussen 's name into Google , and the first result returned was the producer 's official website . Drake emailed Rasmussen asking if he would be interested . The producer replied a few days later , asking him to send several tracks . Drake emailed a number of mp3 files , but Rasmussen did not reply , leading Drake to worry that the producer " hated them , and thought they were shit . " Earache Records subsequently emailed Rasmussen to formally ask if he would produce Evile 's debut album , to which Rasmussen replied , " Yes " . On 12 March 2007 , his involvement was made public . 
 Pre @-@ production with Rasmussen began on 28 – 29 April at Evile 's Huddersfield , West Yorkshire rehearsal space . Soon after the band performed a live set at Tottenham Court Road , London 's Fopp record store , which Rasmussen attended to observe Evile 's live sound , and further gain a feel for the group 's music . The album was recorded and mixed at Sweet Silence Studios , Copenhagen , Denmark . Enter the Grave was produced , engineered , mixed and mastered by Rasmussen , who also supplied additional backing vocals to title track " Enter the Grave " . Anders H. Mortensen , meanwhile , acted as assistant engineer . Photographs taken during the album 's recording sessions were posted at Evile 's official MySpace blog , where fans were also invited to ask the band 's members questions about the recording process for Enter the Grave . 
 In turn , Evile 's guitarists went into a room where another person sat with a microphone , ready to capture the sound . From the control room , Rasmussen would say " Right , play something " . The respective guitarist would play his instrument , to which Rasmussen would respond " Right , move it left " . Moving the guitar left , the respective guitarist would play again , Rasmussen replying with " Move it right . Alright , leave it there . Don 't touch it " . The respective guitarist would leave his instrument in that position , and the " record " button would be pressed . From there , the musician in question would play his parts . A Mesa Boogie Dual <unk> amplifier was tested alongside a Marshall amplifier , but according to Drake , " the Mesa ( sound ) was nowhere near as good " . Evile chose to record Enter the Grave 's guitar parts using a Marshall amplifier , and spent roughly ten minutes attempting to achieve a " decent " sound . Slightly more time was spent testing the drums so that a " nice " sound could be achieved , and so that the drums could be tuned . 
 By 5 June , recording for Enter the Grave had been completed , and Rasmussen had begun mixing the album . Video footage shot during recording sessions was uploaded to Earache Records ' official YouTube account on 4 July , providing an exclusive glimpse behind the scenes . In reviewing Enter the Grave , some journalists commented on Rasmussen 's role as producer . Chris Kee of Zero Tolerance Magazine said that " getting Flemming Rasmussen to produce [ Enter the Grave ] is a major coup and as you 'd expect he 's done a sterling job , these fine songs all being blessed with a clean , crisp , uncluttered sound " , whereas Ian Webster of Terrorizer felt that " booking a band into Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen to record their debut with legendary Metallica producer Flemming Rasmussen is one hell of a statement of intent from Earache . " Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic also commented on Rasmussen 's involvement , declaring that his production " is surely one large reason why the album is characterized by a distinctively crunchy , rhythmically airtight attack . "

 On 23 April 2007 Earache released a six @-@ CD collection entitled Metal : A Headbanger 's Companion which included a demo version of " Enter the Grave " on its third disc . Six days later , following a pre @-@ production session , Evile performed a live set at Tottenham Court Road , London 's Fopp store . " Enter the Grave " , " Schizophrenia " and " Armoured Assault " were made available for streaming on the group 's official website on 25 June . " Enter the Grave " was further included on an Earache summer sampler CD given out free with the August 2007 issue of Decibel . 
 Fans who pre @-@ ordered the album from Earache 's webstore received an exclusive red 7 " vinyl single , along with an Evile poster . This vinyl was limited to a thousand copies and featured two unreleased demo tracks — " Darkness Shall Bring Death " and " Sacrificial " . The 7 " single was also available to purchase from selected independent retailers . On the day of the album 's release outside of North America and Japan , Evile performed an in @-@ store show at Manchester 's Virgin Megastore . 
 Released in Europe and North America on 21 January 2008 and 5 February respectively , the song " Thrasher " surfaced on the compilation Thrashing Like A Maniac . " Thrasher " was also part of the Earache Thrash Pack , downloadable content made available on 18 March for the music video console game Rock Band . With producer Dan <unk> of Static Films , Evile filmed a music video for the track on 28 August in South London . 
 = = Lyrical themes = = 
 Enter the Grave 's liner notes credit Evile as a whole for having written the album 's lyrics . In discussing his lyrical contributions during an October 2007 interview , lead vocalist / rhythm guitarist Matt Drake said that he was " really inspired by films " ; " First Blood " ' s lyrics were inspired by the 1982 film of the same name , whereas " We Who Are About to Die " ' s lyrics were inspired by the 2000 epic Gladiator . Inspired by an urban legend about Countess Bathory , the lyrics for " Bathe In Blood " were written by Drake while Evile were recording at Sweet Silence Studios – after penning the track 's lyrics , he thought he " had gone too far " . " Burned Alive " , meanwhile , was about burning witches ; reading about witches and " how they were dealt with in olden times " , Drake " thought it might be interesting to add a devilish slant to it " . Inspired by what he read , Drake wrote about burned witches going to Hell , returning , and then killing everyone . Drake also wrote the lyrics to title track " Enter the Grave " , and " Schizophrenia " , the former being about a serial killer . 
 Written by bassist Mike Alexander , the lyrics to " Armoured Assault " describe a giant tank @-@ like war machine . Alexander wrote " Killer From the Deep " ' s lyrics as well , which Drake thinks might have been inspired by 1975 thriller Jaws . Drummer Ben Carter contributed lyrics for Enter the Grave , writing the lyrics to " Man Against Machine " . 
 Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic felt that the album 's lyrics were characterized by " splatter @-@ demonic lyrics , reminiscent of Bay Area staples like Exodus and Forbidden – even early Slayer for brief , exceptionally inspired moments . " Metal Maniacs ' Kevin Stewart @-@ Panko commented that Enter the Grave contained " songs about such need @-@ to @-@ know topics as John Rambo ( " First Blood " ) , sharks ( " Killer From the Deep " ) and , umm , thrash ( " Thrasher " ) , " deeming the album 's lyrical content " escapist ridiculousness . "

 Originally scheduled for issue in early 2007 , Enter the Grave was released in Europe on 27 August 2007 by Earache Records and debuted at number 33 on the UK Rock Chart . Released in North America and Japan almost one month later on 25 September by Earache Records and Howling Bull Records respectively , the album sold 200 copies in the United States during its first week of release . Its Japanese edition included the bonus demo tracks " Darkness Shall Bring Death " and " Sacrificial " , both of which were also available as an exclusive red 7 " single vinyl .

 Writing mostly favourable reviews of the album , many journalists referenced 1980s thrash groups , particularly Exodus , Slayer and Testament . Awarding the album eight out of ten stars , Dom Lawson of Classic Rock described Enter the Grave as " a monstrous , life @-@ affirming metal album that craftily welds misty @-@ eyed nostalgia for the glory days of Exodus , Testament and Arise @-@ era Sepultura to contemporary sonic values " . Rock Sound writer Ronnie <unk> observed that " title track " Enter the Grave " nods towards Slayer 's classic " Angel of Death " " , and summarized by calling the full @-@ length " old school as fuck " , while awarding Enter the Grave eight out of ten stars . Dave Ling of Metal Hammer gave the album eight out of ten stars as well , feeling that " with the galloping likes of " Bathe In Blood " , " Thrasher " and " First Blood " , Evile have fulfilled their side of the deal " . Chris Kee of Zero Tolerance Magazine noted that " the influences are easy to spot – Metallica , Exodus , Testament , Forbidden , <unk> Rockit , Slayer " , but still called Enter the Grave " a triumph , a resounding war cry from the spearhead of the new UK thrash assault " , awarding four and a half out of five stars . 
 Ian Webster of Terrorizer wrote that " First Blood " is ultra @-@ Exodus and goes head to head with the Slayer attack of " Schizophrenia " and " Armoured Assault " " , and hailed the album as " the best UK thrash debut since Sabbat 's History of a Time to Come " , awarding nine out of ten stars . Giving Enter the Grave four out of five stars , Kerrang ! ' s James Hoare commented that the album was " honed on a steady diet of early Slayer , Sacred Reich and Nuclear Assault " , summarizing the full @-@ length as " an absolute hair @-@ swirling , air @-@ punching beast " .

 = Youth Olympic Games = 
 The Youth Olympic Games ( YOG ) is an international multi @-@ sport event organized by the International Olympic Committee . The games are held every four years in staggered summer and winter events consistent with the current Olympic Games format . The first summer version was held in Singapore from 14 to 26 August 2010 while the first winter version was held in Innsbruck , Austria from 13 to 22 January 2012 . The age limitation of the athletes is 14 to 18 . The idea of such an event was introduced by Johann Rosenzopf from Austria in 1998 . On 6 July 2007 , International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) members at the 119th IOC session in Guatemala City approved the creation of a youth version of the Olympic Games , with the intention of sharing the costs of hosting the event between the IOC and the host city , whereas the traveling costs of athletes and coaches were to be paid by the IOC . These Games will also feature cultural exchange programs and opportunities for participants to meet Olympic athletes . 
 Several other Olympic events for youth , like the European Youth Olympic Festival held every other year with summer and winter versions , and the Australian Youth Olympic Festival , have proven successful . The Youth Games are modelled after these sporting events . The YOG are also a successor to the discontinued World Youth Games . 
 The Summer Youth Olympic Games of Singapore in 2010 and Nanjing in 2014 each played host to 3600 athletes and lasted 13 days , whereas the Winter YOG of Innsbruck in 2012 had 1059 athletes and lasted 10 days . Even though this exceeded initial estimates , the YOG are still both smaller in size as well as shorter than their senior equivalents . The next Summer YOG to take place will be the 2018 Summer Youth Olympic Games of Buenos Aires . The next Winter YOG to take place will be the 2020 Winter Youth Olympic Games of Lausanne . 
 = = History = = 
 The concept of the Youth Olympic Games came from Austrian industrial manager Johann Rosenzopf in 1998 . This was in response to growing global concerns about childhood obesity and the dropping participation of youth in sport activities , especially amongst youth in developed nations . It was further recognized that a youth version of the Olympic Games would help foster participations in the Olympic Games . Despite these reasons for having an Olympic event for young people , the IOC 's response of holding a purely sporting event was negative . IOC delegates wanted the event to be as much about cultural education and exchange as it was about sports , which is why the Culture and Education Program ( CEP ) was developed as a component of each celebration of the Games . Jacques Rogge , IOC President , formally announced plans for the Youth Olympic Games at the 119th IOC session in Guatemala City on 6 July 2007 . There are several goals for the YOG , and four of them include bringing together the world 's best young athletes , offering an introduction into Olympism , innovating in educating and debating Olympic values . The city of Singapore was announced as the host of the inaugural Summer Youth Olympics on 21 February 2008 . On 12 December 2008 the IOC announced that Innsbruck , host of the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics , would be the host of the inaugural Winter Youth Olympics in 2012 . 
 = = Requirements of host cities = = 
 The scale of the Youth Olympic Games is smaller than that of the Olympics , which is intentional and allows for smaller cities to host an Olympic event . Potential host cities are required to keep all events within the same city and no new sports venues should be built . Exceptions to this building moratorium include a media center , amphitheater facilities for classes and workshops , and a village for coaches and athletes . This village is to be the heart of the Games for the athletes , and the hub of activity . No new or unique transportation systems are required as all athletes and coaches will be transported by shuttles . According to bid procedures , the track and field stadium for the opening and closing ceremonies must hold 10 @,@ 000 people , and a city must have a 2 @,@ 500 @-@ seat aquatics facility ( for Summer editions ) . 
 = = Financing = = 
 The original estimated costs for running the Games were US $ 30 million for the Summer and $ 15 million to $ 20 million for Winter Games , these costs do not include infrastructure improvements for venue construction . The IOC has stipulated that costs for infrastructure and venues is to be paid by the host city . The IOC will pay travel costs to the host city and room and board for the athletes and judges , estimated at $ 11 million . The funding will come from IOC funds and not revenues . The budgets for the final two bids for the inaugural Summer Games came in at $ 90 million , much higher than the estimated costs . The cost of the first games in Singapore escalated to an estimated S $ 387 million ( $ 284 million ) . Sponsors have been slow to sign on for the YOG , due to the fact that it is a new initiative and corporations are not sure what level of exposure they will get . The budget for the inaugural Winter Games to be held in Innsbruck has been estimated at $ 22 @.@ 5 million , which does not include infrastructure improvements and venue construction . 
 = = Participation = = 
 Over 200 countries and 3 @,@ 600 athletes participated in the inaugural 2010 Youth Summer Olympics . Participants are placed in the following age groups : 14 – 15 years , 16 – 17 years , and 17 – 18 years . The athlete 's age is determined by how old he or she is by 31 December of the year they are participating in the YOG . Qualification to participate in the Youth Olympics is determined by the IOC in conjunction with the International Sport Federations ( ISF ) for the various sports on the program . To ensure that all nations are represented at the YOG the IOC instituted the concept of <unk> Places . A certain number of spots in each event are to be left open for athletes from under @-@ represented nations regardless of qualifying marks . This is to ensure that every nation will be able to send at least four athletes to each Youth Olympic Games . For team tournaments one team per continent will be allowed to compete along with a sixth team either representing the host nation or as proposed by the IF with IOC approval . There is a cap of two teams ( one boys ' and one girls ' ) per nation . Finally , no nation may enter more than 70 athletes in individual sports . 
 = = Sports = = 
 The sports contested at the Youth Games are the same as those scheduled for the traditional Games , but with some adaptations , and a limited number of disciplines and events . For example , in the aquatics sport the IOC decided to include diving and swimming events but excluded synchronized swimming and water polo . Some of the sports have been modified for the Games . The basketball competition uses the 3x3 format , which is a 3 @-@ on @-@ 3 half @-@ court game , where the periods are five minutes each , and the first team to 33 points wins . The hockey was introduced as outdoor format in 2010 games but was later changed to the <unk> a smaller version of indoor played in outdoor in <unk> cycling disciplines are mountain bike , BMX , and road , while track cycling has been left off the schedule . Other youth @-@ driven sports may eventually be contested if backed by international sports federations . In November 2007 , it was revealed that pentathlon will be included , as well as sailing , giving an edge to candidate cities near water . 
 The Winter Youth Games will feature seven sports . Hockey will have not only a men 's and women 's tournament but also an individual skills challenge . In luge , figure skating and short track speed skating there will be mixed NOC events that will allow athletes from various countries to compete together in teams . Alpine and cross @-@ country skiing will have events in which men and women will compete on mixed @-@ gendered teams . 
 = = Culture and education = = 
 Education and culture are also key components for the Youth edition . Not only does the education / culture aspect apply to athletes and participants , but also youth around the world and inhabitants of the host city and surrounding regions . To this end a Culture and Education Program ( CEP ) will be featured at each Games . The first CEP at the 2010 Singapore Games featured events that fostered cooperation amongst athletes of different nations . It had classes on topics ranging from health and fitness to the environment and career planning . Local students from Singapore made booths at the World Culture Village that represented each of the 205 participating National Olympic Committee . The Chat with Champions sessions were the most popular portion of the program . Participants were invited to hear inspirational talks given by former and current Olympic athletes . 
 Also part of the CEP are the Young Ambassadors Programme , Young Reporters Programme and Athlete Role Models . Under the Young Ambassadors Programme , a group of youths aged 18 to 25 years old are nominated by the NOCs to help promote the YOG in their regions and communities , and encourage the athletes to participate in the CEP programmes . 
 The Young Reporters Programme provides journalism students or those who have recently started their journalism careers a cross @-@ platform journalist @-@ training programme and on @-@ the @-@ job experience during the YOG . Young Reporters , between the ages of 18 and 24 , are selected by the Continental Associations of National Olympic Committees and will represent each of the five continents . 
 Acting as mentors to help support and advise young Olympians are the Athlete Role Models , who are typically active or recently retired Olympians nominated by the IFs , such as Japanese wrestler Kaori <unk> , Italian Simone Farina and Namibian Frank Fredericks . 
 Emphasis on exchange goes beyond the CEP . Another unique feature of the Youth Olympic Games are mixed @-@ gender and mixed @-@ national teams . Triathlon relays , fencing , table tennis , archery and mixed swimming relays are a few of the sports in which athletes from different nations and mixed genders can compete together . YOG organizers are also using social media such as Facebook , <unk> , and Twitter as key platforms for engaging young athletes before , during , and after each celebration of the Games . Multi @-@ lingual , multi @-@ cultural , and multi @-@ age requirements are the targets of the program , which stress the themes of " Learning to know , learning to be , learning to do , and learning to live together " .

 In early November 2007 , Athens , Bangkok , Singapore , Moscow , and Turin were selected by the IOC as the five candidate cities to host the inaugural Youth Olympic Games . In January 2008 , the candidates were further pared down to just Moscow and Singapore . Finally , on 21 February 2008 , Singapore was declared host of the inaugural Youth Olympic Games 2010 via live telecast from Lausanne , Switzerland , winning by a tally of 53 votes to 44 for Moscow . 
 On 2 September 2008 IOC announced that the executive board had shortlisted four cities among the candidates to host the first Winter Youth Olympic Games in 2012 . The four candidate cities were Harbin , Innsbruck , Kuopio , and Lillehammer . IOC president Jacques Rogge appointed Pernilla Wiberg to chair the commission which analysed the projects . As with the Summer Games , the list was then shortened to two finalists , Innsbruck and Kuopio , in November 2008 . On 12 December 2008 , it was announced that Innsbruck beat Kuopio to host the games . Nanjing , China was selected by the IOC over Poznan , Poland to be the host @-@ city of the 2014 Youth Olympics . The election was held on 10 February 2010 , two days before the start of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver . Lillehammer , Norway will host the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics . At this moment have speculated bidding for the 2023 Summer Youth Olympics .

Posey suffered a fractured fibula and torn ligaments in his ankle , requiring season @-@ ending surgery . Cousins , who was not disciplined , said he hit Posey intentionally in order to score . " If you hit them , you punish them and you punish yourself , but you have a chance of that ball coming out . " He expressed regret over injuring Posey , saying " I certainly didn ’ t want him to get hurt . " Cousins received threats from fans , but Posey denounced them : " I appreciate the continued support of Giants fans and others as I begin the process of working my way back ... But in no way do I condone threats of any kind against Scott Cousins or his family . As I said last week , I 'm not out to vilify Scott . " In 45 games , Posey batted .284 with 17 runs scored , 46 hits , five doubles , four home runs , and 21 RBI .

 Eligible for salary arbitration for the first time , Posey signed a one @-@ year , $ 8 million contract with the Giants prior to the 2013 spring training season . On March 29 , Posey agreed to an eight @-@ year contract extension worth $ 167 million , said by the Giants to be the most lucrative in franchise history . The contract wiped out three arbitration years and five years of free agency for Posey , locking in his services through the 2021 season with a club option for 2022 . The agreement was the second largest in major league history for a catcher , exceeded only by that of Joe Mauer in 2010 with the Minnesota Twins .

 Solar Jetman : Hunt for the Golden Warpship is a multi @-@ directional shooter video game developed by Zippo Games and Rare and published by Tradewest . It was released in North America on 14 October 1990 and in Europe on 26 September 1991 for the Nintendo Entertainment System . The game is the third instalment of the Jetman series and was later re @-@ released by Nintendo for their NES @-@ based PlayChoice @-@ 10 arcade system in the United States in 1990 . 
 In the game , series protagonist Jetman must manoeuvre his small craft through caverns of various planets whilst searching for pieces of the Golden Warpship . The game is presented in a horizontal side @-@ view environment and has ranging gravitational pulls for each planet , which subjects Jetman 's craft to various forms of inertia . Similar to its predecessors , Jetman must keep his craft topped up with fuel in order to progress through levels . 
 The game was developed mostly by Mancunian developer Zippo Games under the name of Iota before being ordered to change the game into a Jetman title by Rare . Ports of the game for the ZX Spectrum , Commodore 64 and Atari ST were completed but not released due to poor sales of the NES version . The game received mostly positive reviews upon release , with critics praising the game 's presentation and graphics , however criticism was directed at the game 's difficulty . It was later included in Rare 's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation , Rare Replay . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The game is a multi @-@ directional shooter that is presented in a horizontal side @-@ view , in similar vein to earlier instalments of the Jetman series . The game is set after the events of Lunar Jetman and involves series protagonist Jetman on his quest to gather all pieces of the Golden Warpship , a mythical starship that allows interstellar travel . The player controls Jetman 's pod in either a clockwise or anti @-@ clockwise direction . The pod is subject to inertia but not drag physics depending on the level of gravity of the set planet . The constant pull of gravity changes every level , which makes stable flight challenging and manoeuvring the pod more difficult as the levels progress . 
 Solar Jetman has twelve planets and one hidden planet , each with its own gravity and system of enemy @-@ infested caverns . The goal is to navigate these caverns with small <unk> launched from an immobile mothership , on each planet bringing back a piece of the Golden Warpship and enough fuel to journey to the next one . Items are collected with a tow cable that makes flight more difficult due to the drag of the item , and are released over the mothership or deposited in small wormholes deeper in the caverns . Points are earned by retrieving valuables and destroying enemies , and can be spent after every other stage to buy power @-@ ups for Jetman 's pod . If a pod is destroyed , Jetman will eject out of the pod and walk around in an agile but vulnerable spacesuit . The player may be able to return to the mothership in order to collect a new pod . If the player dies outside of their pod , a life will be lost . 
 = = Development and release = = 
 Solar Jetman was developed in @-@ joint by Mancunian developer Zippo Games and Leicestershire @-@ based Rare . Founded by brothers Ste and John Pickford , Zippo Games was known for developing Ironsword , a sequel to Rare 's 1987 game Wizards & Warriors . Impressed by the success of Ironsword , Rare purchased Zippo Games and commissioned them more development projects , a decision which was viewed unfavourably by Ste Pickford , as he wanted to focus on developing games independently . After the buy @-@ out , the Pickford brothers started development of Iota on 1 June 1989 , a game which was conceived by programmer Steve Hughes to be an arcade @-@ shooter inspired by the Atari ST game <unk> . Despite having initial creative control over Iota , Rare ordered Zippo Games to change the game into a Jetman title halfway through development . 
 During the late 1980s , the Stamper brothers sold the rights of Ultimate Play The Game to U.S. Gold and shifted their focus from the British home computing market to broader home console games . Solar Jetman was the first game to be released under the re @-@ branded Rare . The company became one of the first western developers to be granted a licence by Nintendo to produce games for the Nintendo Entertainment System , during which Rare began employing more staff and expanding their operations in order to develop more games for home consoles . 
 After development switched to Solar Jetman , the Pickford brothers received little input from Rare , with Ste Pickford later speculating that the Stamper brothers had confidence in their abilities , despite being entrusted with their most " revered " series . In a retrospective interview , Ste Pickford stated that he drew inspiration for the mechanics of Solar Jetman from a ZX Spectrum game , Scuba Diving , admitting that the gravitational pulls of Jetman 's pod were reminiscent of the way a scuba diver manoeuvred . Development of Solar Jetman lasted around a year and started from a standard two @-@ man team to a workforce of several people as the game eventually grew larger in scale . 
 Shortly after release , Sales Curve Interactive announced ports of Solar Jetman for the ZX Spectrum , Commodore 64 , Atari ST and Commodore Amiga , all developed by Software Creations and intended for release on the <unk> label . The Commodore 64 , Amiga and Atari ST versions were complete and the ZX Spectrum reached a playable demo state before the project was cancelled due to poor sales of the NES original and perceived unsuitability for the home computer markets . The Commodore 64 version has subsequently been discovered and made available for download . Despite the cancellations , Solar Jetman was later re @-@ released by Nintendo for their NES @-@ based PlayChoice @-@ 10 arcade system in 1990 . The game was later included in Rare 's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation , Rare Replay .

 The game was received positive reviews from critics upon release , despite the poor sales of the NES version . Reviewers of Mean Machines praised the game 's playability and gameplay , stating that it was " second @-@ to @-@ none " and the different gravity pulls of each planet provided " unique challenges " . Richard Leadbatter of Computer and Video Games similarly praised the gameplay , comparing it to that of Thrust . Leadbatter found the gameplay challenging and stated that the addition of power @-@ ups boosts the game 's playability . Steve Jarrett of Total ! asserted that the gameplay was simplistic but addictive as exploration of the game 's twelve planets would " set the player at it for weeks " . 
 The graphics and sound were also praised . Reviewers of Mean Machines stated that the graphics were " simply brilliant " and presented an " artistic accomplishment " , whereas the sound was similarity " excellent " . Leadbatter stated that the sound and graphics were " functional " rather than outstanding , despite stating that the graphics appeared " fast and smooth " . Jarrett regarded the graphics as simple but " dead smooth " in appearance , also praising the smooth animation of the enemies and the movement of the player 's ship . Jarrett also praised the sound , heralding the soundtrack as " eerie " yet " great " . The game 's playability and replay value were praised by a reviewer of Mean Machines , stating that the number of levels and items will last a " couple of months " . Jarrett similarly stated that the game 's twelve levels provides good replay value due to the game 's difficulty . 
 = Don Tallon = 
 Donald " Don " Tallon ( 17 February 1916 – 7 September 1984 ) was an Australian cricketer who played 21 Test matches as a wicket @-@ keeper between 1946 and 1953 . He was widely regarded by his contemporaries as Australia 's finest ever wicket @-@ keeper and one of the best in Test history , with an understated style , an ability to anticipate the flight , length and spin of the ball and an efficient stumping technique . Tallon toured England as part of Don Bradman 's Invincibles of 1948 and was recognised as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1949 for his performances during that season . During his Test career , Tallon made 58 dismissals comprising 50 catches and 8 stumpings . 
 His early cricket was played in Bundaberg where he was selected to represent Queensland Country against the England cricket team during the infamous Bodyline tour . Aged 17 , he made his first @-@ class cricket debut for Queensland against Victoria in December 1933 . By the 1935 – 36 season , Tallon was an established player and he topped the Queensland batting averages for the season , however he was a surprise non @-@ inclusion for the 1938 Australian team to tour England . Following the Second World War and the retirement or unavailability of other candidates , he was finally given an opportunity to play Test cricket , making his debut against New Zealand in 1946 aged 30 . 
 Following the Invincibles tour , poor health dogged Tallon , causing him to miss the 1949 – 50 tour of South Africa . He recovered his spot for the Ashes series in 1950 – 51 , catching well but failing with the bat . Tallon missed selection for the 1951 – 52 Test season but recovered his spot for the 1953 Australian team to tour England . He played in the first Test before being replaced by Gil Langley , this time permanently . He retired from first @-@ class cricket in 1953 and returned to Bundaberg , assisting his brother in running a corner store . He died in Bundaberg aged 68 . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Tallon was born and raised in the Queensland coastal sugar and rum town of Bundaberg , 400 kilometres ( 249 mi ) north of Brisbane . He learned to play cricket on a backyard wicket with his three brothers and father Les , an iron moulder at the Bundaberg foundry , who played as a slow bowler in the local cricket competition . Often the matches would stretch past the daylight hours , and the brothers would play inside the house after moving the furniture to create some open space . Tallon was formally trained as a wicket @-@ keeper at North Bundaberg State School where he and his brothers were coached by Tom O 'Shea , a teacher and former Sheffield Shield wicket @-@ keeper . He became the primary school 's wicket @-@ keeper at the age of seven , playing with and against boys aged 11 and 12 . He learned to keep to the leg spin of his brother Bill , who also went on to represent Queensland . Tallon later said of his decision to become a wicket @-@ keeper , " You are never out of the game , and that suits me fine " . He was captain of his school team at the age of 11 and rose to become captain of Queensland Schoolboys aged 13 . He played in Bundaberg 's A grade adult team at 14 , and came to the attention of state selectors when Bundaberg played a team captained by Test player Alan Kippax in 1931 . 
 The following season , he played in the Country trials in Brisbane . He was selected for the Queensland Colts in 1932 – 33 and represented Queensland Country against Douglas Jardine 's England cricket team during the Bodyline tour . In England 's innings of 376 , Tallon conceded only five byes and stumped Herbert Sutcliffe , regarded as one of the finest batsmen in Test history . He did not get a chance to display his batting prowess as the Bodyline spearhead Harold Larwood rattled him with a series of deliveries aimed at the throat , before bowling him for two . Tallon 's fast and efficient skills behind the stumps further caught the eye of cricket officials in early 1933 at the Country Week Carnivals . Tallon distinguished himself with his tidy keeping to the express pace bowling of Eddie Gilbert , whose suspect action and indigenous heritage were later the subject of controversy . 
 = = First @-@ class debut = = 
 He made his first @-@ class debut for Queensland at 17 against Victoria in December 1933 , having never previously attended a first @-@ class match as a spectator . He conceded only six byes and took a catch in an innings of 542 in a tidy performance , and made 17 and three in an innings defeat , but was dropped after the match . Queensland officials had ruled that it was not advisable to take such a young player on away trips to Victoria , South Australia and New South Wales . Tallon reclaimed his position when Queensland returned for their home games and from then on was the first @-@ choice wicket @-@ keeper for the state . He played in only one other first @-@ class match for the 1933 – 34 season , scoring 13 and taking a catch and a stumping in an eight @-@ wicket win over South Australia . 
 In his second first @-@ class match in the 1934 – 35 season , and his fourth overall , he confirmed his batting ability with 58 and 86 against the South Australian bowling attack led by Clarrie Grimmett , the world 's leading leg spinner at the time , but was unable to prevent an eight @-@ wicket defeat . Tallon played in five matches for the season , and Queensland lost four and won none . He took four catches , made two stumpings and scored 216 runs at 24 @.@ 00 in innings , although he did score four ducks . 
 Towards the end of 1934 , Tallon moved to Brisbane , where he worked as a storeman for a car company . In 1935 – 36 , Tallon was Queensland 's top batsman in terms of both runs and batting average , scoring 569 runs at an average of 51 @.@ 72 . He started well with 58 in a drawn match against New South Wales , and then scored 45 and made six dismissals in an innings as Queensland fell to an innings defeat against the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) , including five stumpings . He then made four dismissals in an innings in the next match against Victoria . 
 Tallon was prominent in the next match against South Australia in Adelaide . The hosts included Australia captain Don Bradman in their ranks , making a comeback from illness . The match was mainly noted for Bradman 's 233 but Tallon impressed him by taking two particularly difficult catches , one of which dismissed the Australian captain himself . Bradman also praised Tallon for conceding only seven byes in a total of 642 , particularly his ability to take balls passing down the leg side . Tallon then scored 88 in Queensland 's reply . Bradman opined that he had a " clean @-@ hitting crisp style ... attacking , positive , and with a technique to rival most first @-@ class batsmen " . Despite this , Queensland fell to defeat by an innings and 226 runs . He followed this with 51 in a defeat to New South Wales . The highlight of Tallon 's season was his highest first @-@ class score of 193 , against Victoria in Brisbane , in the last fixture of the season , a match in which he also took five catches in an innings . Tallon 's innings played a large part in the hosts ' saving of the match after conceding a lead of 252 on the first innings . As he continued his consistent form with both bat and gloves , he came into strong consideration for Test selection . While Tallon was performing strongly in Australia , the national team were in South Africa and defeated their hosts 4 – 0 . Nevertheless , it was another unsuccessful season for Queensland ; Tallon did not experience a win and suffered losses in three of his six matches . 
 = = Pre @-@ war non @-@ selection = = 
 During the 1930s , Queensland was a weak cricketing state , having only been admitted to the Sheffield Shield in 1926 – 27 , and the national selectors tended to choose Australia teams composed entirely of New South Welshmen , Victorians and South Australians . New South Wales ' Bert Oldfield was the incumbent wicket @-@ keeper and had no plans to retire , while Victoria 's Ben Barnett had been the reserve keeper on the 1934 tour of England . South Australia 's Charlie Walker was also talked of as a possible Test player . 
 Tallon was scrutinised as a Test candidate when England toured for the 1936 – 37 Ashes series . He was selected in Bradman 's XI for a one @-@ off match against Victor Richardson 's XI at the start of the season . It was a testimonial for Richardson and such matches were used as Test trials for the top players in Australia . Tallon took three catches but was unable to capitalise with the bat . He made three and was unbeaten without scoring in the second innings as Bradman 's men reached their target . In the next match against New South Wales , Tallon took four catches and scored 100 to bring his team back into contention after conceding a 190 @-@ run lead . However , New South Wales scraped home to win by one wicket . It continued a winless streak for Tallon in Queensland colours that had lasted for over two and a half years . Tallon had a final chance to push for selection in two matches for an Australian XI and Queensland respectively , against Gubby Allen 's Englishmen before the Tests . He made a total of seven dismissals but scored only 49 runs in three innings . 
 When the Test team was announced , Tallon was overlooked as the selectors persisted with Oldfield . Tallon remained consistent for Queensland , making 22 dismissals in total for the season . With the bat , he once again topped his state 's averages , scoring 434 runs at 36 @.@ 16 . He scored 101 against South Australia and 96 against Victoria , but both matches were lost . Queensland defeat New South Wales to record their first win in three years , but the remaining five Sheffield Shield matches were all lost . 
 The 1937 – 38 season was purely domestic , with no international matches , but it was an opportunity for all players to push for selection in the squad for the 1938 Ashes tour . It was another disappointing season for Queensland , who were again winless ; they lost three matches , hung on a for a draw , eight wickets down in another , and the other two fixtures were washed out before the second innings . Tallon scored 204 runs at 22 @.@ 66 without managing a half @-@ century and made 17 dismissals . 
 Tallon 's non @-@ selection for the 1938 Ashes touring party surprised commentators . In selection deliberations , Bradman had lobbied for Tallon and Walker , asserting that Oldfield was past his best . The other two selectors , Chappie Dwyer from New South Wales and Bill Johnson from Victoria , outvoted Bradman . They selected Barnett , because of his previous tour to England , and Walker . Tallon 's omission was overshadowed by that of Grimmett , regarded alongside Bill O 'Reilly as the world 's leading legspinner . No official reason was given for Tallon 's non @-@ selection . A leak revealed that the reason for his omission was that he was not familiar with the bowling of Australia 's three spinners : O 'Reilly , Chuck Fleetwood @-@ Smith and Frank Ward . Another was Tallon 's preference in standing back to medium pacers . In reality , Tallon stood back and stood up to the stumps depending on the situation . While the medium pacers were swinging the ball , he would stand back to avoid the risk of missing an edge . When the ball was old , he would stand up to the stumps when a medium pacer was operating and effect many stumpings with his fast reflexes . 
 During the series , Barnett made two notable errors . With Australia leading the series 1 – 0 going into the Fifth Test at The Oval , Barnett dropped Len Hutton and Maurice Leyland when both were on 40 . Leyland went on to post 187 while Hutton set a Test world record of 364 . In effect , England were gifted an extra 461 runs as they set a world record score of 7 / 903 . Bradman injured himself during the marathon innings in a rare stint at the bowling crease after the specialist bowlers had failed to break the Englishmen . With opener Jack Fingleton also injured , Australia were down to nine men and fell to the heaviest defeat in Test history ( an innings and 579 runs ) and the series was drawn . 
 Tallon responded during the 1938 – 39 season by equalling two world records . The season started poorly for Queensland , not winning any of their first three matches . Tallon made eight dismissals in the opening match of the Sheffield Shield campaign against New South Wales , but the visitors hung on for a draw with one wicket in hand . After two consecutive losses , Tallon set the first of his world records . Against New South Wales in Sydney , he dismissed 12 batsmen , six in each innings , a feat performed only once before , in 1868 by Surrey 's Ted Pooley . Tallon 's dozen included three stumpings and he was at the crease when Queensland hit the winning runs to complete their first victory in two years . After nine innings during the season without passing 36 , Tallon returned to form with the bat , scoring 115 against South Australia , but was unable to take the field in the second innings due to injury as the match ended in a ten @-@ wicket defeat . In the final match of the season , Tallon became the fourth keeper to make seven dismissals in an innings , in a match against Victoria . He did not concede a bye in the innings of 348 , and scored 44 as Queensland completed an innings win . Tallon finished the season with 34 dismissals in six matches , setting a new Australian season record . He took more than five dismissals in an innings in four of the ten innings in which he kept wicket . Observers noted Tallon to be more motivated than ever ; his catching and stumping style became more animated , and his appealing reached new levels of sound . He passed 100 first @-@ class dismissals during the season , achieved in just 32 matches — the fastest Australian to reach the mark . Tallon ended the season with 305 runs at 30 @.@ 50 . 
 = = World War II = = 
 Following his form in 1938 – 39 , Tallon eagerly awaited the arrival of England for the 1940 – 41 tour of Australia . He was only 23 and regarded as an almost certain selection following his record @-@ breaking performance with both bat and gloves . However , the outbreak of the Second World War called a halt to his rise and robbed him of the opportunity to represent his country while in his prime as a cricketer ; official international cricket did not resume until he was 29 . In the meantime , domestic cricket continued in 1939 – 40 . It was another poor season for Queensland , who won only once and lost their remaining five matches . Tallon scored two fifties before scoring 154 in his last Sheffield Shield innings of the season . This set Victoria a target of 230 , but they reached it for the loss of only one wicket . Tallon was selected for The Rest of Australia in a one @-@ off match against New South Wales at the end of the season , but managed only a duck and eight . He ended the summer with 401 runs at 28 @.@ 62 and 17 dismissals . 
 With the war intensifying , the 1940 – 41 season was truncated and the last before the hostilities ended . Tallon scored 55 and completed four dismissals as Queensland started with a 27 @-@ run loss to New South Wales . He then starred in a match for combined Queensland and Victoria team against New South Wales . Tallon scored 55 and 152 and completed four dismissals , but was unable to prevent a one @-@ wicket loss . He ended with 379 runs at 42 @.@ 11 and made 16 dismissals in five matches . 
 With first @-@ class cricket cancelled , Tallon joined the Australian Army in August 1940 at Bundaberg . Tallon was discharged in 1943 as a private and was not decorated . His discharge was due to stomach ulcers and he later had a major operation to remove part of his stomach . 
 Upon the resumption of competitive cricket , Tallon 's chances of selection had improved due to the fates of his pre @-@ war wicket @-@ keeping rivals . Oldfield had long retired . Barnett , a captain in the army , had been a prisoner of the Japanese at Changi in Singapore for four years . <unk> , he slowly recovered his fitness and forced his way back into the Victorian team , but was almost 40 and intended to retire in the near future . Walker had joined the Royal Australian Air Force as a gunner and was killed in a duel with Nazi fighter pilots over <unk> in Germany . This left Tallon as the front @-@ runner , but there was a possibility that the selectors would opt for generational change and install a more youthful keeper like Gil Langley or Ron Saggers with an eye to the future . With the pressure of selection on his head , Tallon made eight dismissals in the first match after the resumption of cricket , against New South Wales in Brisbane , including three stumpings and three catches from the leg spin of Colin McCool , a future Test team @-@ mate . The performance was to herald the start of a prolific bowler @-@ wicket @-@ keeper partnership . Tallon then scored 74 to guide Queensland to the target of 270 with four wickets in hand . Queensland won two of their seven matches and Tallon scored 305 runs at 30 @.@ 50 and completed 27 dismissals to finally gain national selection . 
 = = Test debut = = 
 Tallon made his Test debut in a one @-@ off Test against New Zealand at Wellington in March 1946 , although the match was only given Test accreditation two years later . On a wet wicket , New Zealand were dismissed for 42 and 54 against the slow bowling of Bill O 'Reilly and Ernie Toshack . Tallon made a stumping , a run out and took a catch . He scored only five runs as Australia won by an innings and 103 runs . Tallon had rarely kept to O 'Reilly 's leg spin and impressed the bowler , who compared him with Oldfield . During the tour of New Zealand , Australia won all of their five matches , four by an innings . Tallon scored 123 runs at 41 @.@ 00 and made 12 dismissals . 
 The following season saw Australia 's first Test series since the end of World War II , with five matches scheduled against Wally Hammond 's touring Englishmen in the 1946 @-@ 47 Ashes series . Tallon staked his claim for the Test wicket @-@ keeping position in Queensland 's second match of the season , which was against MCC . Tallon combined with McCool in four stumpings and two catches , and in the process took his first @-@ class tally to 170 dismissals his 50th first @-@ class match . He also scored 26 and 35 . Tallon 's proficiency keeping wicket to McCool 's bowling was now a major factor in his favour for national selection , because McCool had established himself as Australia 's first @-@ choice spinner since the retirement of O 'Reilly . Tallon was duly selected for the First Test of the series in Brisbane . 
 In First Test at Brisbane Tallon took two catches but scored only 14 in a victory . Tallon was worried that his poor batting might lead to him being replaced , but he was retained as Australia secured an innings victory in Sydney . He put in a polished performance with the gloves , with four catches and two stumpings , in addition to 30 runs . The only negative aspect of the match for Tallon was that he dislocated his finger . Beyond the raw statistics , two of the catches that Tallon made in the first innings were regarded as among his finest ever and turned the tide of the match . Len Hutton and Bill Edrich — two of England 's leading batsmen — had seen their team to lunch with only the loss of one wicket . Tallon declared to Bradman that he intended to dismiss Hutton down the leg side , so Bradman brought off spinner Ian Johnson into the attack immediately after lunch . Johnson was instructed to bowl at Hutton 's legs to give him an opportunity to glance the ball . Hutton obliged and struck the ball from the middle of his bat , expecting a boundary . He turned around and was shocked to see that Tallon had intercepted the ball from a blind position at a range of just one metre . The score was 2 / 88 as Hutton , who held the Test world record score was dismissed and replaced at the batting crease by Denis Compton . Bradman introduced McCool and Compton misjudged a cut shot which went wide of Tallon and struck Johnson , fielding at slip , in the chest . The ball rebounded past Tallon 's shoulder and was heading for the ground when he spun and dived backwards to catch it just before it landed . According to Roland Perry , it was " an acrobatic feat that would put any trapeze artist in the shade , taking one of the most brilliant catches in Test history " . Tallon took another difficult catch from McCool to dismiss Hammond as England fell to 4 / 99 , with three specialist batsmen to improbable catches . This restricted England and allowed Australia to set up a match @-@ winning lead . 
 Tallon now felt secure about his place in the team for the rest of the series . This led to increased confidence in his play in the Third Test at Melbourne ( MCG ) . After keeping tidily and scoring 35 in the first innings , Tallon combined with Ray Lindwall in the second innings for a 154 @-@ run partnership in just 92 minutes . Described by Wisden as a " hurricane " , the partnership was marked by Tallon 's powerful driving and cutting . Lindwall reached his century , but Tallon fell for 92 to Doug Wright . Tallon 's 92 remained the highest score by an Australian wicketkeeper until Rod Marsh equalled it with 92 not out in the 1970 @-@ 71 Ashes series and surpassed it with 132 against New Zealand in 1973 – 74 . 
 In the Fourth Test at Adelaide Tallon stumped Denis Compton , but the umpire gave him not out because " the glare of the sun suddenly became so intense that he was unable to see clearly the white line of the popping crease " and Compton made 147 . The England openers Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook had put on 100 in the second innings when Tallon caught Washbrook , scooping up a ball from Lindwall . Washbrook " stood there transfixed . Even some of the Australian leg @-@ side fielders expressed amazement " . Tallon was known for his impetuous appealing - " he was often roaring before he had studied facts and it was his over @-@ eagerness that brought about the shocking decision " - and this caused an umpiring controversy . But Tallon maintained the appeal and Bradman backed him . Washbrook told Wally Hammond that the ball had gone into the ground just before it went into Tallon 's gloves and the England captain tried unsuccessfully to find a press photograph of the ball touching the ground . Later in the match Tallon missed a vital stumping off the England wicketkeeper Godfrey Evans , who stayed put for 95 minutes without making a run . Tallon stumped Compton again , but he was given not out and went on to make an unbeaten 103 in a match @-@ saving stand of 85 with Evans . 
 Tallon 's keeping was further lauded in the second innings of the Fifth Test , when he stumped Edrich , Jack Ikin and Alec Bedser from McCool 's bowling . By series end , Tallon had set an Australian Test record of 20 dismissals in a series and averaged 29 with the bat . He also scored 54 and claimed seven dismissals in a Queensland win over South Australia . 
 Tallon started the next season by taking five catches and scoring 41 in the second innings and Queensland scraped home to beat New South Wales by two wickets . He played in all five Tests against India in the Australian summer of 1947 – 48 , and earned praise from Indian skipper Lala Amarnath who described him as the " greatest keeper he had seen " . Tallon made 13 dismissals but had an unproductive time with the bat , scoring only 49 runs at 12 @.@ 25 . Outside the Tests , Tallon scored 229 runs at 22 @.@ 90 and made 15 dismissals in six matches for Queensland . 
 = = Invincibles tour = = 
 Tallon 's form saw him selected for the 1948 Ashes tour as part of the side that would become known to cricket history as the Invincibles . Tallon was the first @-@ choice wicket @-@ keeper , with Saggers as his deputy . Having spent the majority of his life in sunny Queensland and growing up in tropical Bundaberg , the cold English climate initially caught Tallon off guard . He did not wet his inner gloves as was his custom due to the temperature . As England agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs , this meant that the ball would more frequently be in a favourable state for fast bowling , since it would swing more . As a result , Australia adopted a pace @-@ oriented strategy and Johnson was the only spinner regularly used in the Test matches . McCool was not to play a Test on the tour , depriving Tallon of an opportunity to show his stumping abilities standing up at the stumps to his Queensland team @-@ mate . 
 Early in the tour , Tallon struck an unbeaten 17 on a damp pitch in a low @-@ scoring match as Australia defeated Yorkshire by four wickets . It was the closest that the tourists came to defeat for the tour . 
 Tallon had difficulty with the English conditions early in the season as he sustained a bruised right finger when he lost sight of a Ray Lindwall bouncer on a misty morning during a tour match against Surrey at The Oval and was hit as he put hand over his face for protection , with the ball running away for four byes . As a result of the injury , Tallon was rested for the following three matches . 
 Despite sustaining an injury from a catching error , Tallon was selected for the First Test at Trent Bridge . He took four catches , including two difficult ones to dismiss key batsmen at the start of the second innings . He thus helped Australia to seize the initiative by denying England a good start , which was converted into an eight @-@ wicket victory . The teams moved on to Lord 's and Australia compiled 350 in its first innings . Tallon made 53 and helped the tail to " wag " and recover from a position of 7 / 258 . Tallon did not concede a bye in England 's first innings of 215 and his diving was estimated to have saved around 40 runs . One of the three catches he took stood out ; it came when Washbrook inside edged a Toshack full toss directly downwards at Tallon 's ankle . Bradman described the catch as " miraculous " because Tallon had to reach so low , so quickly , in order to take the catch . Another dive to stop a leg glance resulted in a severely bruised left little finger . However , Tallon also conceded 16 byes in England 's total of 186 . Australia won the Test , and Tallon was rested ahead of the next Test to allow his finger to recover . 
 The teams played out a draw in the third match at Manchester , where Tallon dismissed George Emmett from the bowling of Ray Lindwall with a diving one @-@ handed catch . He also dropped Compton three times , allowing the English batsman to go from 50 to 145 not out as he held the hosts ' first innings together . 
 Tallon 's little left finger swelled up after the Third Test and he exacerbated the injury during a tour match against Middlesex , ruling him out of the Fourth Test at Headingley , which Australia won to secure the series . He returned for the Fifth Test at The Oval , taking three catches , including an acrobatic catch of Len Hutton down the leg side that was considered the catch of the season . He scored 31 as Australia sealed the series 4 – 0 with an innings win . When the last match of the tour against Scotland in Aberdeen became safe , with Australia in an unassailable position , Bradman allowed Tallon to dispense with his wicket @-@ keeping pads and try his luck at bowling leg spin . Tallon never bowled in his Test career and only rarely in first @-@ class cricket , where he delivered 301 balls , the approximate workload of a specialist bowler in one match . 
 Tallon had had moderate success with his batting during the Test series , aggregating 114 runs at 28 @.@ 50 . In 14 first @-@ class matches , he scored 283 runs at 25 @.@ 72 . The Australian team strategy of primarily depending on pace bowling saw Tallon make 12 catches and no stumpings during the Tests ; however , Bradman rested his lead pace bowlers Miller and Lindwall during the tour games to save energy for the Tests and allowed the spinners do more work , so that overall Tallon took 29 catches and 14 stumpings for the tour . Bradman deemed Tallon more agile than Saggers and better at taking acrobatic catches . Tallon 's performances during the English summer saw him named by Wisden as one of its five Cricketers of the Year . 
 = = Later career = = 
 Upon Tallon 's return to Australia , he made an unbeaten 146 in Bradman 's Testimonial match at the MCG in December 1948 . He featured in a tenth @-@ wicket partnership of 100 with Geff Noblet , who scored only nine as Tallon farmed the strike effectively . This saw the match scores tied on the last ball of the match . Tallon also made seven dismissals for the match . Queensland lost more than they won during the season , but Tallon continued to be productive , scoring 453 runs at 34 @.@ 85 and making 26 dismissals in seven matches . 
 Tallon was selected for but withdrew from the 1949 – 50 tour to South Africa due to illness caused by stomach ulcers , and employment reasons . His place was taken by Saggers , who made 21 dismissals in the five Tests . In the meantime , Tallon recovered and played in the Australian domestic season . After scoring 52 in the opening match for the season , he scored 98 and two scores of 58 not out to help Queensland end the season with consecutive wins . He ended with 349 runs at 43 @.@ 63 and 11 dismissals in six matches . Tallon was selected for a brief tour of New Zealand at the end of the season with an Australian Second XI led by Bill Brown , and scored 116 in an unofficial Test in Dunedin . It was the top @-@ score in Australia 's 299 and the hosts led by only eight runs with one wicket in hand in their second innings when the match ended in a draw . Many of the matches during the tour were not first @-@ class but in one such game , Tallon scored 70 not out as Australia defeated Otago by an innings . 
 For the home Ashes series of 1950 – 51 Tallon was fit once more and available for national selection . Despite making only 37 runs in four innings in the lead @-@ up matches , Tallon was chosen for all five Tests . He had a poor time with the bat , making only 39 runs at an average of just 6 @.@ 50 . He took only eight catches , but kept tidily to retain his place in the team . His performances for Queensland were hardly more productive ; he scored 161 runs at 16 @.@ 10 and aside from a rain @-@ affected draw , his state lost their remaining six matches . 
 By this time , Tallon was losing his hearing , and gained the derisive nickname <unk> . In one Test , he had been told by captain Lindsay Hassett before going out to bat that there was to be an appeal for bad light . Hassett said " go for the light " but Tallon misheard it as " go for a lash " . Tallon walked out and was dismissed for a low score after attempting to attack the English bowlers , leaving his skipper displeased . 
 Tallon missed selection during the 1951 – 52 season due his increasingly error @-@ prone glovework and a combination of health reasons including stomach ulcers and deafness . He did not play a first @-@ class match because of lack of his fitness . In any case , Tallon had secretly been barred from selection by the Australian Board of Control for making unauthorised comments in the media ; this fact was not revealed for half a century . 
 He was unable to reclaim his Test place in 1952 – 53 despite making 133 against the touring South Africans and 84 against New South Wales for Queensland before the Tests . Tallon totalled 508 runs at 33 @.@ 87 for the season and made 33 dismissals in eight matches , including seven in one fixture against Western Australia , but failed to taste victory in a single Queensland match . His omission angered Queensland fans , who relentlessly heckled the Australians during the First Test against the tourists in Brisbane , making fun of the mistakes made by Tallon 's replacement Gil Langley in particular . 
 He was selected for the 1953 tour of England , and scored 76 against Tasmania before the tourists departed . Despite making only 35 runs at 7 @.@ 00 in the lead @-@ up matches , Tallon was selected for the First Test at Trent Bridge , his first match at the top level in more than two years . He took two catches and scored a duck and 15 . Hassett and his deputy Arthur Morris then made the decision to replace Tallon with Langley . Still troubled by stomach ulcers , Tallon played in another eight first @-@ class matches for the tour , scoring 119 runs at 19 @.@ 83 . His most notable effort was an unbeaten 83 in an innings win over Kent . He was unable to regain his Test position . 
 Tallon retired in dramatic circumstances after the first match of the 1953 – 54 Sheffield Shield season . During the match , he suddenly took off his gloves and handed the keeping duties to Peter Burge . He scored 21 and 54 not out in a drawn match against New South Wales . Two months later , he played for Arthur Morris 's XI against Hassett 's XI , a testimonial match for the latter . Tallon made 17 not out and nine in a 121 @-@ run win . Tallon continued to play local cricket in Bundaberg for another decade . 
 = = Style = = 
 Regarded as one of Australia 's finest ever wicket @-@ keepers , Tallon was lean and relatively tall for a wicket @-@ keeper , standing 180 cm . Tallon 's high acclaim among cricket pundits derived from his style , rather than raw statistics . In 21 Tests , Tallon kept wicket in 41 innings , making 58 dismissals at an average of 1 @.@ 41 per innings . Modern Australian glovemen such as Rod Marsh and Ian Healy , both of whom held the Test world record for dismissals , averaged closer to two . Tallon 's Test batting average of 17 @.@ 13 pales in comparison to that of contemporary wicket @-@ keepers such as Australia 's Adam Gilchrist and Sri Lanka 's Kumar Sangakkara , both of whom have made a double century and more than ten centuries . English wicket @-@ keepers from two decades after World War II such as Godfrey Evans and Jim Parks scored two Test centuries apiece and averaged substantially more than Tallon . 
 Tallon had an understated style , which was without flourish or flamboyancy . He was known for his anticipation of the flight , length and spin of the ball . He was particularly regarded for his stumping efficiency and his ability to catch balls down the leg side . Tallon often stood up to the stumps for medium pace bowlers and he had a textbook stumping technique in which he lifted the bails without disturbing the stumps . Tallon 's crouch was more pronounced than most other keepers and he rebounded upwards further and faster than others . He had a particularly smooth and graceful catching technique that left his hands undamaged from the ball 's impact , the injury in England in 1948 being a notable exception that proved the rule . In recognising him as one of their five Cricketers of the Year in the 1949 Wisden , the Almanack noted that his hands resembled those of a violinist , while Bradman noted that all his " fine , longer fingers were intact " as though he had not played much cricket . According to his English counterpart Godfrey Evans , Tallon was the " best and most nimble keeper ever " while Australian team @-@ mate Alan Davidson called him the " Bradman of keepers " . Due to financial reasons , Tallon could not afford new equipment and he used an outdated pair of iron @-@ coated gloves for most of his career . 
 Strong driving and quick scoring were hallmarks of his batting , made possible by his swift footwork . According to Bradman , Tallon 's batting was " attacking , positive and with a technique to rival most first @-@ class batsmen " . This led Bradman to select Tallon in his all @-@ time best XI . Tallon was a vociferous and frequent <unk> behind the stumps , something that led to complaints from opposition batsmen who felt that the pressure he exerted was unfair . 
 = = Outside cricket = = 
 Tallon married his first wife Marjorie Beattie in 1946 . The constant travel , interstate and overseas , took a toll on his marriage and the pair divorced in 1950 . In 1954 , he married Lynda Kirchner from his native Bundaberg , with whom he had two daughters . In retirement , Tallon helped his younger brother Mat in running a corner store in Bundaberg . His nephew Ross played one match for Queensland Colts in 1967 – 68 . The Tallon bridge , built in 1995 in Bundaberg was named after the famous <unk> which links west & north Bundaberg . He died of heart disease in 1984 .

" Zoromski was unhappy however with the " outright product placement " with Staples , writing that " the show 's quality felt a little compromised .

" AOL TV writer Michael Sciannamea also enjoyed Helms ' performance , believing that " the <unk> [ sic ] between Andy and Dwight will surely make for some classic moments . " Sciannamea concluded his review , " What makes this show so great is that the supporting players have a chance to shine at the right moments . I thought Stanley 's reactions to the whole situation were hysterical , and Creed is just great . He deserves some more airtime . "
