 Traditionally , the two clubs play each other in the league on Boxing Day every year , with the match usually attracting the biggest league attendance of the season . However , in 2009 the match was removed from the fixture list by the Irish Football Association due to crowd trouble at Windsor Park . The match returned in 2011 , and usually alternates venues between the Oval and Windsor Park each year . 
 = = = Trophy dominance = = = 
 Linfield and Glentoran have been the two most successful clubs in Northern Irish football to date , regularly being the two main contenders for honours . They have won more league titles , Irish Cups , and League Cups than any other clubs . Linfield hold the record for the most League titles ( 51 ) , Irish Cups ( 42 ) and League Cups ( nine ) . In comparison , Glentoran have won 23 league titles , 22 Irish Cups and seven League Cups . Almost half ( 47 @.@ 4 % ) of the 135 Irish Cup competitions to date have been won by one of the two clubs , with at least one of the clubs reaching the final on 88 occasions ( 65 @.@ 2 % of all finals ) , winning the cup a combined 64 times . Of those 88 finals , the two clubs have met in 15 of them – making it the most common final . Linfield have won eight of the head @-@ to @-@ head final meetings compared to Glentoran 's seven wins , with the most recent meeting between the two clubs in the final occurring in 2006 , when Linfield won 2 – 1 to lift the Cup for the 37th time . Approximately two @-@ thirds of all Irish League titles have been won by one of the Big Two . Of the 114 completed league seasons , the title has been won by either club on 74 occasions ( 64 @.@ 9 % of them ) . The duo also make up two of the three clubs that have appeared in every season of the Irish League since its inception in 1890 ; the other club being Cliftonville . 
 As of April 2016 , the two clubs have met a total of 262 times in the Irish League – excluding unofficial wartime results between 1915 – 1919 ( first World War ) and 1940 – 1947 ( second World War ) . Linfield have won 118 of the meetings , with 72 Glentoran victories and 72 drawn matches . Linfield 's record victory over their rivals is 8 – 0 . This occurred on 21 November 1891 , during the 1891 – 92 Irish League season . Linfield 's record post @-@ war win over Glentoran in all competitions is by a six @-@ goal margin – a 7 – 1 win over the Glens at Grosvenor Park in the 1961 – 62 North @-@ South Cup , and a 6 – 0 victory at Windsor Park in the 2006 Setanta Sports Cup group stage . 
 Since 2009 , the intensity of the rivalry has waned as the duo 's domination of the domestic game has decreased . This is partly due to the resurgence of North Belfast derby clubs , Cliftonville and Crusaders . In 2013 , Cliftonville became the first club other than Linfield or Glentoran to lift the league title since Portadown did so in 2002 . In 2014 , Cliftonville went on to retain the title for the first time in the club 's history , with Crusaders then winning the 2014 – 15 title in convincing fashion , finishing 10 points ahead of runners @-@ up Linfield . During this time , Glentoran lifted the Irish Cup in 2013 and again in 2015 , but their overall fortunes on the field have taken a relative downturn . The club has won only three league titles since the turn of the 21st century ; in 2002 – 03 , 2004 – 05 and 2008 – 09 . Since then , they have twice finished as low as sixth place ; in 2011 – 12 and 2014 – 15 . The last season in which the two clubs finished as champions and runners @-@ up in either order was 2008 – 09 , and they have not met in a major domestic cup final since 2006 , when they contested both the Irish Cup and the League Cup finals . 
 = = = Sectarianism and violence = = = 
 Linfield are generally regarded as a ' Protestant club ' and draw the vast majority of their support from one side of the community . However , the squad itself is one of the most diverse in the Irish League . The club has also been regarded as sectarian in the past , both in respect of its alleged employment policy and of the behaviour of its fans . This sectarian reputation is partly the result of the actions of fans who have a history of occasional anti @-@ Catholic behaviour ranging from sectarian chanting on the terraces to outright violence . Part of the problem has been attributed to Windsor Park 's location in a part of Belfast that is predominantly Protestant . A relatively small number of local Catholics played for the club during the Troubles , which led to an accusation that the club held a historical policy of not signing Catholic players . However , the existence of such a policy has been disputed : 
 Sectarian tensions have long been a cause of conflict at football matches in Northern Ireland , and crowd trouble occasionally marred games involving Linfield throughout the twentieth century . In 1948 , Belfast Celtic withdrew from the Irish League after years of sectarian crowd problems culminated in a Boxing Day match against Linfield at Windsor Park which ended in a pitch invasion and riot in which Belfast Celtic 's Protestant centre forward , Jimmy Jones , suffered a broken leg . 
 In the 1979 – 80 European Cup , Linfield were drawn to face Dundalk from the Republic of Ireland . In the first leg , which was played in Dundalk and ended in a 1 – 1 draw , crowd disturbance prompted UEFA to switch the second leg to the Haarlem Stadion , Netherlands . Linfield were held almost entirely accountable for the events , and were forced to pay Dundalk 's costs to travel to the Netherlands as well as an additional £ 5 @,@ 000 for damage sustained to Oriel Park . Dundalk were fined £ 870 for providing insufficient security at the match . Dundalk eventually won the match 2 – 0 to progress 3 – 1 on aggregate . In the 1987 – 88 campaign , Linfield 's home game against Lillestrøm was marred by missile throwing , resulting in UEFA sanctions which meant that the club had to play their next two home games in European competitions at Welsh club Wrexham in 1988 – 89 and 1989 – 90 . 
 A 1997 match against Coleraine was abandoned when Linfield fans hurled bottles onto the pitch after two Linfield players were sent off . In May 2005 there were disturbances in Dublin at the Setanta Cup final between Linfield and Shelbourne . In the same month , Linfield fans were banned from travelling to the Oval for a match against Glentoran , allegedly as a result of disturbances involving both sets of fans the previous month . However , Glentoran denied this was the reason behind the ban , citing health and safety regulations that forced them to close the away stand . In 2008 , three Linfield fans were charged in a Dublin court with public order offences at a Setanta Cup match against St Patrick 's Athletic , but were released . In November of the same year , Linfield player Conor Hagan was struck by a rocket that was fired from Cliftonville supporters in the crowd following Linfield 's 2 – 1 defeat , and the following month riot police were called into Glentoran supporters in the Boxing Day match after Linfield had taken a 2 – 0 lead . 
 The management of Linfield has attempted to reverse the stigma of negative press attached to the club . The club has moved forward in co @-@ operation with the Irish Football Association , which has launched a campaign called " Give sectarianism the boot . " It assisted a local <unk> team who needed space to train in 2005 , and also built links with the Gaelic Athletic Association which has traditionally had little support from the Protestant community in Northern Ireland . In 2006 FIFA President Sepp Blatter commended Linfield for their anti @-@ racism . A play dealing with the conflict between Linfield and Belfast Celtic , <unk> and Gerry at the Shrine , was staged by the IFA at Windsor Park in October 2010 , with the co @-@ operation of the Linfield management . 
 Since 2008 , the number of incidents has decreased . However , in February 2014 , Linfield were fined £ 3 @,@ 000 and Cliftonville were fined £ 3 @,@ 250 by the IFA following sectarian chanting from sections of both sets of supporters during a County Antrim Shield semi @-@ final at Windsor Park in October 2013 . Cliftonville 's fine of an extra £ 250 came as a result of their fans causing an explosion during the game . Both clubs criticised the decision , and expressed their intent to appeal against the fines . In April 2014 , the punishments were rescinded on appeal . There was also crowd trouble at a league fixture between the clubs at Windsor Park in March 2014 , with reports of missiles being thrown after the game . The Northern Ireland Football League condemned the actions of a " small minority " of supporters . 
 In May 2014 , Linfield were fined £ 1 @,@ 200 by the Irish Football Association over the singing of sectarian songs by supporters , ruling that Linfield fans had been guilty of breaching the code of conduct during a league game at Coleraine .

 Below is a list of all the managers Linfield have appointed during the club 's history . In the early years after the club was formed in 1886 , the team was selected by club committee , a standard practice by football clubs at the time . Since then , 25 different men have held the position of Linfield first team coach / manager . However , only six have been appointed in the 40 years since Billy Campbell 's departure in 1975 . David Jeffrey holds the record for the longest reign as manager , having been in charge for 17 years and 16 weeks between 4 January 1997 and 26 April 2014 . Jeffrey and Coyle jointly hold the record for the most trophies won as manager , each having led the club to 31 trophies – a combined 62 major honours between them . Former Northern Ireland international Warren Feeney is the club 's last manager , having been appointed in May 2014 . He resigned in October 2015 to become assistant manager of Newport County .

 = = Linfield in Europe = = 
 As Northern Ireland 's most dominant club side , Linfield have been regular campaigners in European football . The club first participated in European competition in 1959 against Göteborg in the 1959 – 60 European Cup . In the first round of the 1961 – 62 European Cup , Linfield were drawn to face an East German team , Vorwärts . The away leg was played , which Linfield lost 3 – 0 . However , Vorwärts were denied visas for entry into the UK to play the second leg , and ( similarly to Glenavon the previous season ) travelling to play the game in a neutral country was not financially viable for Linfield . They were therefore forced to withdraw from the competition . 
 Linfield 's most notable achievement in European competition is reaching the quarter @-@ finals of the 1966 – 67 European Cup . After beating Aris of Luxembourg and <unk> of Norway they faced CSKA Red Flag in the last eight . This resulted in a 2 – 2 draw at home and 1 – 0 defeat away . In the 1984 – 85 season , after overcoming Shamrock Rovers on away goals ( the first and so far only series of meetings between the two Irish superpowers outside all @-@ Ireland tournaments ) , Linfield faced eventual semi @-@ finalists Panathinaikos in the second round . After a 2 – 1 defeat away , Linfield drew 3 – 3 at Windsor Park in the return leg after racing into a 3 – 0 lead at half @-@ time . Panathinaikos staged a remarkable comeback in the second half to level the match and eliminate Linfield 5 – 4 on aggregate . 
 The 1993 – 94 UEFA Champions League saw Linfield drawn with Dynamo Tbilisi of Georgia . After losing 3 – 2 on aggregate , they were reinstated when their opponents were expelled from the competition for alleged match fixing and paying the officials . Linfield faced Copenhagen in the first round proper . They won the first leg 3 – 0 , but lost the second leg 4 – 0 after extra time . This proved costly , as victory would have meant a financially lucrative tie against eventual champions A.C. Milan in the next round . The club then had to wait seven years to participate in the competition again , due to the format of the two European competitions being altered . The league 's relatively low ranking in the UEFA coefficient system has meant that the club has entered in the early qualifying rounds of either the UEFA Champions League or the UEFA Cup / Europa League , with the second qualifying round being the furthest the club has progressed in either competition . In the 2012 – 13 UEFA Champions League , the Blues entered the competition in the first qualifying round , and defeated <unk> Tórshavn 4 – 3 on penalties to progress to the second qualifying round , after both legs ended as 0 – 0 draws . This was the first time since the 1984 – 85 season ( excluding their opponent 's expulsion in 1993 – 94 ) that the club had won a tie in the competition . However , they were defeated 3 – 0 on aggregate in the next round by AEL Limassol . 
 The 2013 – 14 UEFA Europa League campaign started in record @-@ breaking fashion . In July 2013 , the club won 2 – 0 away from home against <unk> <unk> of the Faroe Islands in the first qualifying round . This was the Blues ' first win in Europe since 2005 , and their first away win in Europe since 1966 , when they defeated <unk> 4 – 1 during their run to the quarter @-@ finals of the 1966 – 67 European Cup . In the second leg at Windsor Park , the Blues won 3 – 0 to go through to the next round 5 – 0 on aggregate . This was the club 's largest aggregate victory in a European tie since defeating Aris <unk> 9 – 4 on aggregate in the first round of the 1966 – 67 European Cup . It was also the first time that a Northern Irish club had won both legs of a European tie in any competition . They followed this up in the next round by winning away from home again . Despite being massive underdogs for the tie , a 1 – 0 victory away to Xanthi of Greece made it three consecutive victories in Europe , without conceding a goal in the process – another first for the club . However , in the second leg at home they went down 2 – 1 after extra time , which eliminated them on the away goals rule . The following season , Linfield 's first venture into Europe under new manager Warren Feeney was in the Faroe Islands against <unk> Tórshavn in the 2014 – 15 UEFA Europa League first qualifying round , which was also Feeney 's first competitive game in charge of the club . Linfield came out 2 – 1 victors with goals coming from Jamie Mulgrew and Michael <unk> . The return leg was played at Glenavon 's ground , Mourneview Park , due to the redevelopment of Windsor Park . Linfield had to settle for a 1 – 1 draw , but that was enough to secure passage into the second qualifying round for the second successive season , where they were drawn to face AIK from Sweden .

 The Northern Ireland comedy sketch show Dry Your Eyes featured a character called Derek , portrayed by Martin Reid , a fanatical fan of Linfield who is thrown into life @-@ threatening situations such as aircraft hijackings and bank robberies . The character remains placid until the situation causes him inconvenience at which point he confronts the terrorists , hijackers etc . , and while everyone else in the scene cowers in fear for their lives he responds to the demands of the villains with a catchphrase " Are ye by f * * * ! " and then verbally scares them into surrender , thus saving the situation . 
 = George Mouzalon = 
 George Mouzalon ( Greek : Γεώργιος <unk> , <unk> <unk> ; ca . 1220 – 25 August 1258 ) was a high official of the Empire of Nicaea under Theodore II Laskaris ( r . 1254 – 1258 ) . Of humble origin , he became Theodore 's companion in childhood and was raised to high state office upon the latter 's assumption of power . This caused great resentment from the aristocracy , which had monopolized high offices and opposed Theodore 's policies . Shortly before Theodore 's death in 1258 , he was appointed regent of Theodore 's under @-@ age son John IV Laskaris ( r . 1258 – 1261 ) . He was assassinated only a few days later by soldiers , as the result of a conspiracy led by the nobles under the soon @-@ to @-@ be emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos ( r . 1259 – 1282 ) .

 The Mouzalon family is first attested in the 11th century , but produced few notable members until the mid @-@ 13th century , with the exception of Nicholas IV Mouzalon , Patriarch of Constantinople in 1147 – 1151 . George Mouzalon was born at <unk> on the Anatolian coast in circa 1220 . His family was considered as low @-@ born , but he and his brothers became the childhood friends of Theodore II , being raised with him in the palace as his <unk> ( <unk> , " pages " ) . It is assumed that they were also educated along with Theodore , sharing his classes under the scholar Nikephoros <unk> . There were also at least two sisters , one of whom was later married to a member of the <unk> family . 
 When Theodore became emperor in November 1254 , he raised the Mouzalones to the highest state offices : George was made megas domestikos ( commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army ) while two of his brothers , Andronikos and Theodore ( the eldest brother ) , were made protovestiarios ( grand chamberlain ) and <unk> ( head huntsman ) respectively . According to the contemporary chroniclers , the emperor loved George " above all others " ; in some letters he calls him " son " and " brother " . During Theodore 's reign , George was the emperor 's senior minister and his most trusted advisor . Little is known , however , on his personal involvement in the governance of the state , except for his participation in the council convened to discuss the proper reaction to the invasion of Nicaea 's Macedonian holdings by the Bulgarians after Vatatzes 's death . George Mouzalon supported the majority opinion that Theodore himself should campaign against the invaders . During Theodore 's absence on campaign in 1255 , George was left behind as regent of the state . Upon his return , Theodore raised George further , naming him <unk> and protovestiarios and instituting the new title of megas stratopedarches for him . Andronikos Mouzalon succeeded George as megas domestikos . It was an extremely high honour : the combined title " <unk> and protovestiarios " was normally conferred only to close kinsmen of the emperor , while the offices of protovestiarios and megas domestikos had always until then been the preserve of aristocratic families . 
 The elevation of the Mouzalones was not only a mark of personal affection or favour , but also in line with Theodore 's policies , which aimed to curb the influence and independence of the powerful nobility . The appointment of low @-@ born " new men " to such high posts , and Theodore 's often harsh and arbitrary treatment of the nobles , aroused the ire of the traditional aristocracy , and especially the capable and ambitious Michael Palaiologos . The aristocrats ' hostility was further intensified when the emperor gave his low @-@ born favourites noble brides : George Mouzalon wedded Theodora Kantakouzene , a niece of Michael Palaiologos , and Andronikos married a daughter of the former protovestiarios Alexios Raoul . After Mouzalon 's murder , Theodora would marry the protovestiarios John Raoul Petraliphas ( in 1261 ) . A staunch opponent of her uncle 's unionist religious policies , she was exiled and became a nun . After Michael 's death , she restored the monastery of Saint Andrew in <unk> , to where she transferred the relics of Patriarch Arsenios Autoreianos , and was a prominent member of the capital 's literary circles . 
 = = = Appointment as regent and assassination = = = 
 Shortly before Theodore II died on 16 August 1258 , he left George Mouzalon as regent and guardian of his 8 @-@ year @-@ old son John IV . Patriarch Arsenios may have shared guardianship of John : although the later historians Nikephoros Gregoras and Makarios Melissenos say the Patriarch was so named , the contemporary historians Pachymeres and <unk> name only Mouzalon . This appointment further enraged the aristocracy , and Mouzalon 's position became extremely precarious . Mouzalon was also unpopular with the clergy because he was associated with Theodore 's high @-@ handed treatment of the Church , and with the people , who feared that he would try to usurp the throne . Most importantly , however , he faced the hostility of the army , in particular the Latin mercenaries , who had apparently been denied the usual stipends and donatives . In addition , they probably resented Theodore 's intention to raise a " national " army composed solely of Byzantine Greeks , and Mouzalon is recorded by Pachymeres to have taken measures . Palaiologos , who as megas konostaulos held command over the Latins , was in a good position to exploit these grievances . 
 To prevent any action against his testament 's provisions for his son 's succession and the regency , Theodore on his deathbed demanded an oath to be taken by Senate , army , people and clergy , both those present at court and those absent elsewhere in the state . Immediately after his death , George Mouzalon , aware of his vulnerability and his complete lack of support , called an assembly of the leading nobles , officials , and military commanders . He offered to resign from his post in favour of any person that the assembly chose , but the dignitaries , led by Michael Palaiologos , dissuaded him and encouraged him to stay on and even accepted to take an oath of loyalty to him as well as to the young emperor . It was a sham , as a conspiracy by the leading aristocratic families was well under way to depose him , in which Palaiologos apparently played a covert but leading role . 
 Only a few days after the death of Theodore II ( the sources disagree on the exact date , although 25 August is the widely accepted date ) , a memorial service was held at the Monastery of <unk> in Magnesia , founded by John III Vatatzes ( r . 1221 – 1254 ) and serving as his and Theodore 's burial place . The entire court attended , while the army was encamped on the plain below the monastery . As soon as George Mouzalon , his brothers and his retinue arrived , the service began . Outside the church , however , soldiers had assembled , many of them Latin mercenaries , and they began to clamour and demand to see the young emperor . John IV went outside and raised his hand to quiet them ; the soldiers , however , allegedly mistook this as a signal . Joined by a large mob , they stormed the church aiming to kill the Mouzalon brothers . They were warned of what was going on , but George only sent his secretary Theophylact to investigate . He was mistaken for Mouzalon and killed by the crowd . The mob , however , realized its error ( the secretary was wearing black shoes , while the protovestiarios wore green ones ) and entered the church , the soldiers with swords in hand . 
 As the people inside the church scattered , the Mouzalon brothers tried to hide : George hid under the altar , Andronikos behind a door , and Theodore in a corner by the emperor 's tomb . The mob , however , proceeded to search the church for them , and George was discovered by a Latin soldier named <unk> ( " Charles " ) . Mouzalon was dragged from under the altar and , despite pleading to ransom his life , was executed . So great was the frenzy of the crowd that his corpse was repeatedly stabbed and hacked to pieces , so that the parts had to be gathered in a sack for burial afterwards . Andronikos and an unnamed brother @-@ in @-@ law too were slain , while Theodore 's fate is uncertain : some scholars believe he survived and is to be identified with Theodore Mouzalon , a chief minister to both Michael VIII and Andronikos II Palaiologos ( r . 1282 – 1328 ) . The Mouzalon family 's houses were then ransacked by the mob ; and when George Mouzalon 's wife fled to her uncle Michael Palaiologos and pleaded for her husband 's life , she was brusquely told to be quiet or she would share his fate . Palaiologos 's responsibility in the whole affair is further supported by the fact that none of the Mouzalones ' murderers were ever persecuted . Indeed , the mercenary Charles appears later as Palaiologos 's confidant . 
 Mouzalon 's death was followed by a purge of Theodore II 's other prominent " new men " , the protostrator John Angelos and the <unk> <unk> : Angelos was recalled by Palaiologos but died ( or committed suicide ) on the way , while <unk> was imprisoned . Among Theodore II 's protégés , only George Akropolites survived , apparently because he at the time was a prisoner in Epirus ; eventually , he reached high office under Michael Palaiologos . Michael Palaiologos in the meantime consolidated his position , being named regent with the rank of megas doux . Soon he took the title of despotes , and in early 1259 , he was crowned emperor . Ostensibly still the guardian and co @-@ emperor of John VI , after the recapture of Constantinople in 1261 he sidelined and imprisoned John , being crowned sole emperor at the Hagia Sophia and founding the Palaiologan dynasty , the last ruling house of Byzantium . 
 = = Treatment by historians = = 
 Of the contemporary sources , the history of Akropolites is the most negative towards the Mouzalon brothers , whom he calls " loathsome little men , worthless specimens of humanity " and " false of tongue , nimble of foot , peerless at beating the floor in dance " . Although otherwise reliable , Akropolites 's account on this issue is suspect : on the one hand , he evidently tries to disassociate himself from Theodore II 's " new men " , to whom he too originally belonged , while on the other he is generally strongly biased in favour of Michael Palaiologos , whom he tries to exculpate from the assassination . Other historians of the time paint a more favourable picture . The account of the near @-@ contemporary Theodore Skoutariotes , which otherwise generally follows Akropolites closely , notably fails to repeat the latter 's negative comments , and even records that it was the assembled nobles who persuaded the Mouzalones to stay in the church during the riot on the day of their murder . George Pachymeres too , whose treatment of Theodore Laskaris 's reign and the <unk> emperors in general is far more favourable than Akropolites 's , considers the Mouzalones to have been promoted on merit , condemns their murder , and names Palaiologos as directly responsible . The later historian Nikephoros Gregoras likewise avoids negative comments , as do most modern historians . 
 = Forth Valley Royal Hospital = 
 Forth Valley Royal Hospital is a hospital located in Larbert , Scotland . With 860 inpatient beds , 25 wards , and 16 operating theatres , it was Scotland 's largest ever NHS construction project at the time but has been surpassed by the New Southern General hospital amongst others . Built at a cost of £ 300 million on the site of the old Royal Scottish National Hospital , it opened to its first patients in 2010 . It is operated by NHS Forth Valley . 
 The hospital is the first in Scotland to have a Forestry Commission ranger on site , whose job is to encourage the use of the 70 @-@ acre ( 28 ha ) grounds formerly belonging to the Larbert House estate . It has Scotland 's first fully robotic pharmacy , in which robots dispense and label medicines . The hospital also employs robots to carry out tasks such as removing waste , delivering food to wards , and cleaning operating theatres . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Forth Valley Royal Hospital was designed by <unk> , a subsidiary of Laing O 'Rourke , and <unk> Designs in cooperation with builders Laing O 'Rourke . After a consultation process in 2003 , involving 5 @,@ 600 local residents , it was decided that a new acute hospital should be built to replace the ageing facilities at Stirling Royal Infirmary and Falkirk Royal Infirmary , which were to become community hospitals . 
 At the time of construction the hospital was Scotland 's largest ever NHS construction project , cost £ 300 million to build , most of which was provided by a private finance initiative arrangement ; it was built on the site of the old Royal Scottish National Hospital . Originally to be called Forth Valley Hospital , it was granted royal status by Queen Elizabeth II , becoming Forth Valley Royal Hospital . It was hoped the new hospital would be ready by 2009 , but medical services did not start to be transferred until August 2010 , when the first patients were admitted . The process was completed in June 2011 , and the queen officially opened the hospital on 6 July 2011 . 
 = = Facilities = = 
 Set in 70 acres ( 28 ha ) of woodland , the hospital has 860 inpatient beds spread over four floors , 25 wards and 16 operating theatres . The wards contain a mixture of single rooms or a maximum of four beds per ward section , and each bed has access to a personal television screen free of charge . The hospital contains the region 's only Accident and Emergency Department following the closure of the unit at Stirling Royal . 
 The hospital provides services for the 300 @,@ 000 residents of the Forth Valley area , stretching from Killin in the north to Bo 'ness in the south . Those services include : 
 For the use of staff , patients , and visitors the hospital has several catering establishments including Starbucks , a Marks & Spencer Simply Food shop and cafe , and a full restaurant open seven days a week . 
 The hospital 's design was criticised for not providing space for the storage of medical files . It was expected that all files would be stored electronically within five years . In the meantime , the paper medical files were transferred to the site of the old Falkirk Royal Infirmary . An old X @-@ ray department at the hospital was decontaminated and converted into a storage department at a cost of £ 40 @,@ 000 , and a taxi company was contracted to move the records between sites . 
 = = Radio Royal = = 
 Radio Royal is the hospital 's in house radio station . It operates 24 hours a day seven days a week , staffed by a team of around 27 volunteers . Founded in 1976 , it originally broadcast from the old Royal Scottish National Hospital in Larbert . It was latterly based at Falkirk Royal Infirmary , before returning to Larbert on the opening of Forth Valley Royal . 
 = = Grounds = = 
 The hospital is set in the grounds of the Old Larbert House estate , which until 2002 housed the Royal Scottish National Hospital , a state mental hospital . The 70 acres of land contain a loch , walled garden and woodland areas . The grounds were transformed into a " green oasis " for the use of those using the hospital and the local community with the help of a £ 101 @,@ 000 grant from the Forestry Commission Scotland . Forth Valley Royal is the first hospital in Scotland to have a Forestry Commission ranger on site . The ranger 's job is to encourage use of the green space and promote healthy lifestyles . 
 The hospital was fitted with large windows to give patients access to views of the surrounding countryside . On clear days the Forth Bridges and the Lomond and <unk> Hills can be seen . 
 Tunnels were discovered during the hospital 's construction , thought to have been built to allow wealthy guests staying at Larbert House , built in 1822 , to walk to the nearby loch unobserved . 
 = = Transport = = 
 The hospital is accessible by public transport via bus services operating from the main local towns . A shuttle bus used to but no longer runs every 20 minutes from Larbert railway station , ( it was free for passengers with a train ticket ) ; the station is thus now a 25 @-@ minute walk away from Larbert train station . 
 A large car park with 1 @,@ 500 spaces is provided , free with a maximum stay of four hours . Bicycle racks are provided for those cycling to the hospital . 
 = = Robotics = = 
 Forth Valley Royal was the first hospital in the UK to use a system of robotic porters . A fleet of 13 robotic vehicles operates within the hospital , supplied and maintained by services company Serco , part of its 30 @-@ year contract to provide cleaning , catering , <unk> and maintenance services . The robots have their own corridor system and lifts underneath the hospital , and navigate using guidance lasers . They can be called up to wards by staff using a portable computer , and are used for tasks such as removing waste , delivering food to wards , and cleaning operating theatres . To avoid any risk of cross @-@ contamination the fleet is divided into those robots performing " clean " tasks and those carrying out " dirty " tasks , each with their own network of corridors . 
 The hospital also has Scotland 's first fully robotic pharmacy , where robots dispense and label medicines . It is estimated that in reducing the number of errors and requiring less staff time the system , which cost £ 400 @,@ 000 to install , has cut the hospital 's drug bill by £ 700 @,@ 000 . Instead of completing prescription forms , staff on the wards order drugs via computer terminals . 
 = George Herriman = 
 George Joseph Herriman ( August 22 , 1880 – April 25 , 1944 ) was an American cartoonist best known for the comic strip Krazy Kat ( 1913 – 1944 ) . More influential than popular , Krazy Kat had an appreciative audience among those in the arts . Gilbert Seldes ' article " The Krazy Kat Who Walks by Himself " was the earliest example of a critic from the high arts giving serious attention to a comic strip . The Comics Journal placed the strip first on its list of the greatest comics of the 20th century . Herriman 's work has been a primary influence on cartoonists such as Will Eisner , Charles M. Schulz , Robert Crumb , Art Spiegelman , Bill Watterson , and Chris Ware . 
 Herriman was born in New Orleans , Louisiana , to mulatto Creole parents , and grew up in Los Angeles . After he graduated from high school in 1897 , he worked in the newspaper industry as an illustrator and engraver . He moved on to cartooning and comic strips — a medium then in its infancy — and drew a variety of strips until he introduced his most famous character , Krazy Kat , in his strip The Dingbat Family in 1910 . A Krazy Kat daily strip began in 1913 , and from 1916 the strip also appeared on Sundays . It was noted for its poetic , dialect @-@ heavy dialogue ; its fantastic , shifting backgrounds ; and its bold , experimental page layouts . In the strip 's main motif , Ignatz Mouse pelted Krazy with bricks , which the naïve , androgynous Kat interpreted as symbols of love . As the strip progressed , a love triangle developed between Krazy , Ignatz , and Offisa Pupp . 
 Herriman lived most of his life in Los Angeles , but made frequent trips to the Navajo deserts in the southwestern U.S. He was drawn to the landscapes of Monument Valley and the Enchanted Mesa , and made Coconino County the location of his Krazy Kat strips . His artwork made much use of Navajo and Mexican themes and motifs against shifting desert backgrounds . He was a prolific cartoonist who produced a large number of strips and illustrated Don Marquis 's books of poetry about Archy and Mehitabel , an alley cat and a cockroach . Newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst was a proponent of Herriman and gave him a lifetime contract with King Features Syndicate , which guaranteed Herriman a comfortable living and an outlet for his work despite its lack of popularity .

 = = = Early life = = = 
 George Joseph Herriman was born at 348 <unk> Street in New Orleans on August 22 , 1880 . He came from a line of French @-@ speaking Louisiana Creole mulattoes who were considered free people of color , and were reportedly active in the early abolitionist movement . His paternal grandfather , George Herriman Sr. , owned a tailor shop on Royal Street in New Orleans . His maternal grandmother was born in Havana , Cuba . His parents were George Herriman , Jr . , born in New Orleans , and Clara Morel Herriman , born in Iberville . The family attended the St. Augustine Catholic Church in New Orleans ' <unk> neighborhood . 
 When he was ten , Herriman and his family moved to Los Angeles , where he grew up south of downtown near Main Street and Washington Boulevard . His father worked there as a tailor and , for a time , as a baker . Herriman attended the Catholic boys ' school St. Vincent 's Academy . He worked as a barber and later as a baker with his father while in school , though he pined for the opportunity to make art . Soon after graduating in 1897 , he sold a sketch of the Hotel Petrolia in Santa Paula to the Los Angeles Herald . This landed him a $ 2 @-@ per @-@ week job there as an assistant in the engraving department , where he occasionally did drawings for advertisements and political cartoons . 
 = = = Early career in New York ( 1900 – 1904 ) = = = 
 When he was 20 , Herriman sneaked aboard a freight train bound for New York City , hoping his chances as an artist would be better there . He was unsuccessful at first , and survived by working as a barker and billboard painter at Coney Island , until one of the leading humor magazines of the day , Judge , accepted some of his cartoons . Between June 15 and October 26 , 1901 , eleven of his cartoons appeared in that magazine 's pages , in the heavily crosshatched style of the day . He often used sequential images in his cartoons , as in the emerging comic strip medium . On September 29 that year , his first real comic strips were published , one in the Pulitzer chain of newspapers on a non @-@ contractual , one @-@ shot basis and another on a continuing basis in the Philadelphia North American Syndicate 's first comic strip supplement . His first color comic strips appeared in the T. C. McClure Syndicate beginning October 20 . 
 His success with these syndicated strips convinced Herriman to give up on magazine submissions . For the Pulitzer papers on February 16 , 1902 , he began his first strip that had a continuing character , Musical Mose . The strip featured an African @-@ American musician who impersonated other ethnicities , only to suffer the consequences when discovered by his audience . Professor Otto and his Auto , about a terrifyingly dangerous driver , followed in March , and Acrobatic Archie , a " kid strip " with a child protagonist , first appeared in April . With his future as a cartoonist seemingly assured , Herriman traveled back to Los Angeles to marry his childhood sweetheart and returned with her to New York . 
 In the November 1902 issue of the literary magazine The Bookman Herriman wrote of his profession self @-@ deprecatingly , while poet La Touche Hancock , in an article in that issue titled " The American Comic and Caricature Art " , wrote , " Art and poetry is the characteristic of George Herriman . Were his drawings not so well known one would think he had mistaken his vocation . " Herriman 's work was increasing in popularity , and he occasionally had front @-@ page , full @-@ color strips for the Pulitzer supplements , such as Two Jolly <unk> about two unemployed sailors , which began in January 1903 . He began drawing the cowboy strip Lariat Pete in September for the McClure syndicate after Two Jolly <unk> was ended . 
 In June , Herriman was employed by the New York World . There , he illustrated Roy McCardell 's commentaries on local events , beginning June 28 and running to the year 's end . Herriman still produced syndicate work , such as Major Ozone 's Fresh Air Crusade for the World Color Printing Company beginning January 2 , 1904 . Another of Herriman 's obsessive characters , the Major traveled the world in an unsuccessful search for the purest air and spouted poetic dialogue . Major Ozone was so popular that it soon was given the supplement 's front page . The same month , Herriman moved from the World to the New York Daily News , where he was given a larger quantity and variety of work , including cartoon reporting on sports and politics . In February and March , he had a short @-@ lived continuing character comic strip about domestic life called Home Sweet Home . That spring , he began illustrating a series of articles written by Walter Murphy called <unk> . 
 Rudolph Block hired Herriman for the Hearst papers with " a salary commensurate with his talents " , starting April 22 at the New York American , which ran no daily comic strips at the time . Herriman drew sports cartoons in an office alongside Frederick Burr <unk> , James Swinnerton , and Tad Dorgan , who was popularly known as " Tad " and was considered a star at another Hearst paper , the New York Evening Journal . Tad and Herriman were often assigned to cover the same sporting events and became close friends . In 1924 , Tad called Herriman " one of the best sporting artists in the world " and regretted that Herriman no longer did that kind of work . Herriman continued with Hearst until June 1905 when he left the paper , possibly because of the new sports editor 's unsympathetic attitude to cartoonists . He returned to Los Angeles in the latter half of 1905 . 
 = = = Return to California ( 1906 – 1910 ) = = = 
 In California , Herriman continued to mail in work to the World Color Printing Company . He revived Major Ozone and produced Grandma 's Girl — Likewise Bud Smith , which he combined from two earlier strips , and a two @-@ tiered children 's strip , Rosy Posy — Mama 's Girl . He began to work with the Los Angeles Times on January 8 , 1906 , before returning to Hearst that summer . Accompanying a front @-@ page illustration in Hearst 's Los Angeles Examiner , Herriman was announced as " the Examiner 's cartoonist " on August 21 . His artwork began to appear on nearly every page , resulting in greatly increased sales for the newspaper . In October , he stopped working for World Color . 
 Following the success of Bud Fisher 's daily strip A. Mutt , which debuted in late 1907 , Herriman began a similarly sports @-@ themed daily strip that December called Mr. <unk> the Plumber . The strip was not as successful as Fisher 's , and it ceased to appear after December 26 . His next comic strip , Baron Mooch , starring the titular freeloader , debuted in the Examiner on October 12 , 1909 . Herriman began two more strips in November 1909 with the World Color Printing Company — Alexander the Cat and Daniel and Pansy , which both appeared in color . Daniel and Pansy was Herriman 's first strip to feature an all @-@ animal cast . This was followed in the Examiner on December 20 by the short @-@ lived Mary 's Home from College , a precursor to the " girl strips " such as Cliff Sterrett 's Polly and Her Pals and John Held Jr . ' s Merely Margie , and on December 23 by Gooseberry <unk> , about an aristocratic , cigar @-@ smoking duck who had previously and popularly appeared in Herriman 's sports cartoons . The bird @-@ populated fantasy was a precursor to Krazy Kat , and many of its characters reappeared in the later strip . 
 = = = New York again , and Krazy Kat ( 1910 – 1922 ) = = = 
 In 1910 , the sports editor of the New York Evening Journal called Herriman back to New York to cover for Tad Dorgan who was in San Francisco covering the " Fight of the Century " between Jack Johnson and Jim Jeffries . Six days after arriving in New York , Herriman began The Dingbat Family , starring E. Pluribus Dingbat and his family . Herriman used typed lettering on the strip on July 26 , 1910 , but quickly went back to hand @-@ lettering . On August 10 , 1910 , Herriman retitled the strip The Family Upstairs , " making it perhaps the first comic strip in which the title characters never appeared . " The original title return after the strip of November 15 , 1911 , when the <unk> ' building was demolished to make room for a department store and they and their upstairs nemeses parted paths . 
 Critics do not regard the strip highly , but it provided the vehicle for a fruitful situation : in the July 26 episode , a mouse threw a brick at the family cat — called " Kat " — which hit the cat on the head . The antics of this mouse and " Kat " continued to appear in the bottom portion of The Dingbat Family . Herriman said he did this " to fill up the waste space " . About a month after its first appearance , the " Kat " crept up on the sleeping mouse and kissed it loudly . The mouse awoke saying , " I dreamed an angel kissed me " , while the " Kat " crept away and said , " Sweet thing " . 
 The gender of " Kat " was unclear from the start . Herriman experimented with a decision about the character 's gender , but it remained ambiguous and he would refer to " Kat " as " he " or " she " as he saw fit . Herriman incorporated unusual details into the mini @-@ strip 's backgrounds — cacti , pagodas , fanciful vegetation , or anything else that struck his fancy ; this became a signature of the later Krazy Kat strip . The cast grew and soon included the mainstay character Bull Pupp and characters from the Gooseberry Sprigg strip . The strip 's characters , relations and situations grew organically during its lifetime , encouraged by Herriman 's colleagues . 
 The cat @-@ and @-@ mouse <unk> was gaining in popularity ; instead of filling up space in the bottom of The Dingbat Family 's panels , it began to occupy a tier of panels of its own . In July 1912 , while Herriman had the <unk> on vacation , Krazy Kat and Ignatz Mouse took over the strip , which was retitled Krazy Kat and I. Mouse for the duration . On October 28 , 1913 , Krazy Kat debuted as an independent strip on the daily comics page . 
 During the first few years of publication , Krazy Kat 's humor changed from slapstick to a more vaudevillian kind . The shifting backgrounds became increasingly bizarre , presaging things to come . The strip expanded to a full @-@ page black @-@ and @-@ white Sunday strip on April 23 , 1916 . Herriman made full use of his imagination and used the whole page in the strip 's layout . The strips were unlike anything else on the comics page ; spontaneous , formally daring , yet impeccably composed . 
 Herriman visited Monument Valley in Arizona and similar places in New Mexico and southern Utah , and incorporated the distinct forms of the desert landscape into his strips . The Enchanted Mesa of New Mexico first appeared in Krazy Kat in the summer of 1916 . Herriman may have visited after reading an article by Theodore Roosevelt in 1913 , but he may have gone earlier — the desert Coconino County , Arizona , that became the backdrop to Krazy Kat was first mentioned in a 1911 Dingbat Family strip , though the real Coconino County was located further southwest than Herriman 's fanciful version . 
 The Dingbat Family finished in 1916 and was replaced by Baron Bean 's debut the next day . The strip 's title character , The Baron , was an impoverished English nobleman , a tramp inspired by Charles Dickens and Charlie Chaplin . He and his valet Grimes would plot ways to get by . Herriman later introduced the main characters ' wives , and after a run as a domestic strip , with occasional appearances of characters from Krazy Kat 's world , it ended in January 1919 . It was replaced the next day by Now Listen Mabel , which was about a young man courting a young woman ; he would be caught in a compromising situation , which he would try to explain away with " Now listen Mabel ... " The strip lasted until that December . 
 Krazy Kat gained an appreciative audience in the world of the arts . The character debuted in film in 1916 . The first animated films starring a cat were produced by Hearst 's International Film Service , though without Herriman 's direct involvement . In 1922 , Adolph Bolm choreographed a jazz @-@ pantomime Krazy Kat ballet written by John Alden Carpenter . It was first performed in New York in 1922 by Ballet <unk> , and Herriman illustrated the libretto and designed the costumes and scenario . While it was not a great success , the critics Deems Taylor , Stark Young and Henrietta Straus wrote favorably about it . The strip itself was the subject of an article by literary critic Gilbert Seldes called " Golla , Golla the Comic Strip 's Art " , which appeared in the May 1922 issue of Vanity Fair . Seldes expanded this article as part of his book on the popular arts , The Seven Lively Arts ( 1924 ) , in which Seldes argued against conservative tendencies that excluded artists in the popular arts , such as Herriman and Chaplin , from being considered alongside traditional artists . Krazy Kat was the subject of a chapter entitled " The Krazy Kat That Walks by Himself " , which is the most famous piece of writing about the strip and the earliest example of a critic from the world of high art giving legitimacy to the comic strip medium . Vanity Fair inducted Herriman into its Hall of Fame in the April 1923 issue .

 Hearst , an admirer of Krazy Kat , had given Herriman a lifetime contract with his company King Features Syndicate , which gave Herriman the security to live anywhere he wanted . In 1922 , he moved back to Hollywood , into a two @-@ story Spanish @-@ style home at 1617 North Sierra Bonita , from where he made frequent visits to the Arizona desert . Herriman developed ties with members of the film industry ; he knew Hal Roach Studio members Tom McNamara and " Beanie " Walker from their newspaper days . Walker , Herriman 's best friend , was the head writer on the Our Gang shorts . In the early 1920s , Herriman occasionally drew his strips at the Roach Studio . He met celebrities , including Will Rogers and Frank Capra , and presented them with hand @-@ colored drawings . He loved Charlie Chaplin 's films , and reviewed The Gold Rush in the magazine Motion Picture Classics in October 1925 . 
 Autumn 1922 saw the first daily installment of Stumble Inn , the first non @-@ Krazy Kat strip Herriman had drawn since 1919 . A verbose strip whose Sundays were often overrun with prose , its lead characters were Uriah and Ida Stumble , who rented rooms to an assortment of strange characters . The daily strip was short @-@ lived , but the Sundays edition lasted three years . 
 From August 1925 until September 1929 , King Features required that Herriman design the Krazy Kat Sundays so that they could be run either as a full Sunday page or as two four @-@ panel dailies . Herriman lamented intrusion on his page designs , and the artwork of the period took on a rushed look . He was made to focus on the strip 's characterization , and during this period , the Krazy — Ignatz — Offisa Pupp love triangle for which the strip is remembered became fully developed . Pupp pined for Krazy , Krazy loved Ignatz , and Ignatz hated Krazy and pelted the annoying " Kat " with a brick , and Pupp imprisoned Ignatz . 
 Throughout the late 1920s , Herriman made frequent trips to Kayenta , Arizona , in Navajo country about 25 miles ( 40 km ) from Monument Valley . He also made winter trips to Mexico . The desert , Navajo artwork , and Mexican pottery and architecture became more prominent in Herriman 's strips , and he sometimes used Spanish vocabulary in the dialogue . Herriman did little work on these excursions , and it is likely that he drew his strips in hurried bursts when in Hollywood . 
 Stumble Inn finished in late 1925 , and it was replaced with the domestic strip Us Husbands ( with Mistakes Will Happen as a " topper " strip ) , which ran until the end of that year . In 1928 , Herriman took over the strip Embarrassing Moments , which had begun in 1922 and had been drawn by several cartoonists . The strip eventually became Bernie Burns , in which embarrassing moments would happen to the title character . The strip appeared in few papers , and after it ended in 1932 , Herriman worked only on Krazy Kat , although he provided illustrations for Don Marquis ' popular Archy and Mehitabel , a series of books of poetry about a cat and a cockroach . 
 In 1930 , Herriman sold his first Hollywood home to a friend and moved his family to <unk> Maravilla Drive , a Spanish @-@ style mansion atop a hill . It was adorned with paintings of Southwest and Native themes , and had a Mexican @-@ style garden paved with flagstones and decorated with painted pots and tropical plants . Herriman later bought the lot across the street and turned it into a public park . 
 The 1930s were a period of tragedy for Herriman . On September 29 , 1931 , his wife Mabel died after an automobile accident , and in 1939 , his youngest daughter Bobbie died unexpectedly at 30 . After his wife 's death , Herriman never remarried and lived in Los Angeles with his cats and dogs . He developed a close relationship with cartoonist James Swinnerton 's first wife Louise , with whom he frequently exchanged letters . Herriman underwent a kidney operation in spring 1938 , and during his ten @-@ week convalescence King Features reran old Krazy Kat strips . 
 Krazy Kat 's popularity fell considerably over the years , and by the 1930s it was running in only thirty @-@ five newspapers , while its contemporaries such as Bringing Up Father were reportedly running in up to a thousand . Herriman realized his $ 750 @-@ per @-@ week salary from Hearst 's King Features Syndicate was far more than the revenue the strip could be generating , but Hearst refused Herriman 's offer to take a pay cut . Hearst let it be known that Herriman was to continue the strip as long as he liked . From 1935 , Krazy Kat appeared in color , of which Herriman made bold use . He reduced the amount of <unk> and used larger , more open panels . 
 Herriman died in his sleep in his home near Hollywood on April 25 , 1944 , after a long illness . An incompletely inked penciling of a week 's worth of daily strips was found on his drawing board . On his death certificate , the cause of death was listed as " non @-@ alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver " , and despite his mixed @-@ race heritage , he was listed as " caucasian " . The New York Journal @-@ American ran a front @-@ page obituary . His funeral at Little Church of Flowers at Forest Lawn Memorial Park was attended by few . Cartoonist Harry <unk> spoke at the funeral , saying , " If ever there was a saint on earth , it was George Herriman " . According to his request , his body was cremated and his remains were scattered over Monument Valley . 
 On June 25 , 1944 , two months after Herriman 's death , the last of his completed Krazy Kat strips , a full @-@ page Sunday , was printed . At the time , Hearst usually engaged new cartoonists when the artists of popular strips quit or died , but he made an exception for Herriman , as he felt that no one could take his place . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Herriman was described as self @-@ deprecatingly modest , and he disliked being photographed . The New York Journal @-@ American 's obituary described him as a devoted husband and father , of slight build , mild @-@ mannered and an anonymous contributor to charities . He was generous to his friends , and sold his first Hollywood house , which he had bought for $ 50 @,@ 000 , to a friend for $ 40 @,@ 000 . Though a private person , he was said to be an entertaining host to his friends . He would sometimes stay silent during social occasions and would often leave the room to wash dishes , which he said he enjoyed as it gave him the opportunity to think . His favorite game was poker , which he particularly enjoyed playing with his fellow cartoonists . 
 Herriman had a great love of animals , and had a large number of dogs and cats ; he had five dogs and thirteen cats in 1934 . He usually kept to a vegetarian diet , except when it made him feel too weak , and he refused to ride horses . He so admired Henry Ford 's pacifist stance that he would only buy Ford automobiles . He purchased a new model annually . 
 Herriman married his childhood sweetheart Mabel Lillian Bridge in Los Angeles on July 7 , 1902 . They had two daughters : Mabel ( May 10 , 1903 – November 13 , 1962 ) ; nicknamed " <unk> " , later " Toots " ) and Barbara ( 1909 – 1939 ; nicknamed " Bobbie " ) , who had epilepsy . His only grandchild Dinah ( nicknamed " Dee " ) was born to Bobbie and her husband , author @-@ scriptwriter Ernest Pascal . 
 = = Race and identity = = 
 Herriman was born to mixed @-@ race parents , and his birth certificate lists Herriman as " colored " . In the post- Plessy v. Ferguson U.S. , in which " separate but equal " racial segregation was enshrined , people of mixed race had to choose to identify themselves as either black or white . Herriman seems to have identified himself as white . According to comics academic Jeet Heer , his early work is " replete with black caricatures " , such as Musical Mose , in which the lead character , an African @-@ American musician , wishes his " color would fade " . Racial ambivalence crept into Krazy Kat , such as on two occasions where Krazy 's black fur was dyed white . Ignatz falls in love with the whitened Krazy , only to return to hatred and brick @-@ throwing when the truth is revealed . Similarly , in an oft @-@ repeated joke , Ignatz would accidentally become covered with coal dust and would be spurned by the normally love @-@ struck Krazy . In one such episode , a brick thrown by the blackened Ignatz hits Krazy , who declares , " A lil <unk> Mice , black like a month from midnights . <unk> ! " Once Ignatz reverts to his white self , Krazy loves him again . 
 Herriman 's ethnic heritage was unknown to his colleagues . Fellow cartoonist Tad Dorgan nicknamed him " the Greek " , a label which stuck and was taken up by his biographers and the press , who called him the son of a Greek baker . At other times , he was identified as French , Irish , and Turkish . He told a friend that he was Creole , and speculated that he may have " Negro blood " in him , as he had " kinky hair " . The friend said that Herriman wore a hat to hide his hair , which may have been an attempt to pass as white . Herriman said that he dreamed of being reborn a Navajo . On his death certificate , he was listed as " Caucasian " , and his daughter Mabel had his father 's birthplace listed as Paris and his mother 's as Alsace @-@ Lorraine . 
 Sociologist Arthur Asa Berger made Herriman 's mixed @-@ race heritage known in 1971 . While researching for Herriman 's entry for the Dictionary of American Biography , Berger discovered the cartoonist 's race was listed as " colored " on his birth certificate obtained from the New Orleans Board of Health . The 1880 census for New Orleans listed his parents as " mulatto " . On reading this , African @-@ American poet Ishmael Reed dedicated his 1972 novel Mumbo Jumbo to " George Herriman , Afro @-@ American , who created Krazy Kat " . Herriman came to be identified as Black or Creole in comics literature , including his first book @-@ length biography , Krazy Kat : The Comic Art of George Herriman ( 1986 ) , while the " Greek " label stuck with some biographers , and was used by Bill Blackbeard in his introductions to the Krazy and Ignatz volumes in the early 2000s . Later research at the New Orleans Public Library by writer Brian Nelson showed that Herriman 's maternal grandmother was born in Havana , Cuba , that all his relatives were listed as " mulatto " on the 1890 census , and that Herriman may also have had Spanish or Native American ancestry . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 Krazy Kat was popular with intellectuals , artists and critics , and in the 1920s Herriman 's modernist touches received praise . In 1921 , composer John Alden Carpenter , who had long been an admirer of Herriman 's work , approached him to collaborate on a Krazy Kat ballet . President Woodrow Wilson refused to miss any installment of Krazy Kat , and would take it into cabinet meetings . 
 Writer E. B. White praised Herriman 's illustrations for Archy and Mehitabel . Cartoonist Edward Sorel wrote that Krazy Kat 's lack of popularity later in its run was largely due to Hearst 's editorial policies , in that the " lowbrow " readership at whom he aimed his papers was unlikely to appreciate Herriman 's style of work , though Hearst personally championed the strip . Following Herriman 's death , the strip was discontinued , unlike most popular strips which were continued by other cartoonists after their creators ' deaths . His stature was such that decades after his death , his work was displayed in art galleries . 
 Critics found Herriman 's work difficult to classify and contextualize ; Seldes , E. E. Cummings , and writers Adam Gopnik and Robert <unk> were among critics who tempered their enthusiasm for the strip with qualifications about its perceived naïveté and its " lowbrow " origins on the comic strip page . 
 The strip has had a lasting influence on a large number of cartoonists . Mutts creator Patrick McDonnell calls Krazy Kat one of his foremost influences , and is co @-@ author of Krazy Kat : The Comic Art of George Herriman ( 1986 ) . Will Eisner discovered Herriman 's comics when he was selling newspapers in the 1930s and called Krazy Kat " the big strong influence " on his own work . Art Spiegelman called Herriman one of his " conscious influences " . Herriman 's widespread influence on American underground comix , particularly his shape @-@ shifting , psychedelic backgrounds , lack of respect for convention and his irreverence , is evident in the work of Robert Crumb , Denis Kitchen , and Bobby London . Journalist Paul Krassner called Crumb " the illegitimate offspring of Krazy Kat " . Cartoonist Chris Ware was so taken with Herriman 's work he made a pilgrimage to Monument Valley to see the desert landscapes that inspired much of Herriman 's art . 
 Krazy Kat was a primary influence on other cartoonists such as Charles M. Schulz of Peanuts , Bill Watterson of Calvin and Hobbes , and the Italian Massimo Mattioli . Walt Kelly paid homage to Herriman in some of his Pogo strips . Dr. Seuss expressed fondness for Krazy Kat , and children 's literature scholar Philip Nel has detected Herriman 's influence in Seuss 's works , especially in his zig @-@ zagging , Coconino County @-@ like backgrounds . Multimedia artist <unk> <unk> appropriated Krazy Kat in a series of works from 1963 to 1965 . Jay Cantor published a postmodern novel in 1987 called Krazy Kat : A Novel in Five Panels , in which the retired Krazy and Ignatz contemplate a comeback in a post @-@ atomic world . 
 Since 1997 , the Small Press Expo has held the annual Ignatz Awards in honor of Herriman 's mouse from Krazy Kat . It recognizes talent in independent comics publishing . Krazy Kat was ranked first on The Comics Journal 's list of the greatest comics of the twentieth century . The Society of Illustrators inducted Herriman into its Hall of Fame in 2013 .

 = = = Style = = = 
 Within the seeming strictures of the strip — the recurring characters , the Krazy – Ignatz – Offisa Pupp love triangle — Herriman improvised freely with the story , the shifting backgrounds , and the sex of the Krazy Kat 's title character . Among the multicultural influences Herriman mixed in his work were those of the Navajo and Mexican . He made creative use of language with a poetical sense , employing multilingual puns in a fanciful mix of dialects from different ethnic backgrounds . Herriman used metafictional techniques associated with postmodernism ; his characters were self @-@ aware , he frequently drew attention to himself and his drawings as drawings in his strips , and he emphasized the subjectivity of language and experience . 
 Herriman drew with what cartoonist Edward Sorel called a " liberated , spontaneous @-@ looking style ... a cartoon counterpart of expressionism " . It was organic , and his pen strokes had a dynamic , thick @-@ and @-@ thin range which Sorel describes as instantly recognizable and difficult to imitate . The Krazy Kat Sunday pages showed Herriman experimenting most freely — each had a unique panel layout and logo , and the jumbled panels could be circles , irregular shapes , or borderless . In his last few years , Herriman 's arthritis led to an ever @-@ <unk> style of art ; he used a knife to scratch out whites from inked surfaces , giving the artwork the look of a woodcut . 
 = = = Collections = = = 
 Krazy Kat has been collected in a variety of formats over the years , though Herriman 's other strips have been less frequently reprinted . George Herriman 's Krazy Kat ( 1946 ) was the first Krazy Kat collection ; it featured an introduction by poet E. E. Cummings . Comics historian Bill Blackbeard began compiling a complete collection of Krazy Kat Sundays beginning in 1988 , but the publisher Eclipse Comics went bankrupt in 1992 , before the series was complete . Blackbeard 's thirteen @-@ volume Krazy and Ignatz series was published by Fantagraphics Books beginning in 2002 , and was designed by Chris Ware . In 2010 , Sunday Press Books released Krazy Kat : A Celebration of Sundays , which reprinted a selection of Krazy Kat Sundays and some of Herriman 's pre @-@ Krazy Kat work in a 14 @-@ by @-@ 17 @-@ inch ( 36 cm × 43 cm ) format , which approximated the original printed size of the strips . In 2012 , IDW began issuing a three @-@ volume Baron Bean reprinting , and Fantagraphics will release George Herriman 's Stumble Inn . Fantagraphics has also announced plans to collect the complete Krazy Kat dailies at an unspecified time .

 = Running with Scissors ( " Weird Al " Yankovic album ) = 
 Running with Scissors is the tenth studio album by " Weird Al " Yankovic , released on June 29 , 1999 . It was the fourth studio album self @-@ produced by Yankovic . It was the first of four albums to be released by Volcano Records . The musical styles on the album are built around parodies and pastiches of pop and rock music of the late @-@ 1990s , largely targeting alternative rock and hip @-@ hop . The album 's lead single , " The Saga Begins " , however , was a parody of the 1971 single " American Pie " by Don McLean , and it recounts the plot of the film Star Wars : Episode I – The Phantom Menace , which was released around the same time . None of the album 's singles charted domestically , although " Pretty Fly for a Rabbi " charted at number 67 in Australia . 
 The album featured five parodies . Aside from the aforementioned " The Saga Begins " and " Pretty Fly for a Rabbi " , the album also contains lampoons of " One Week " by Barenaked Ladies , " It 's All About the Benjamins " by Puff Daddy , and " Zoot Suit Riot " by Cherry Poppin ' Daddies . The other half of the album is original material , featuring many " style parodies , " or musical imitations of existing artists . These style parodies include imitations of specific artists like Nine Inch Nails and The <unk> , as well as imitations of different musical genres like zydeco , third @-@ wave ska , and truck @-@ driving country . 
 Running with Scissors was met with mostly positive reviews , with many critics praising " The Saga Begins " ; some , however , felt that the album was rushed . The album peaked at number 16 on the Billboard 200 . " The Saga Begins " went on to become one of Yankovic 's best @-@ known singles , although it never charted on the Billboard Hot 100 . Running with Scissors was Yankovic 's seventh Gold record in the United States , and went on to be certified Platinum for sales of over one million copies in the US . The album also was certified Gold in both Australia and Canada .

 In June 1997 , Yankovic entered the studio to begin the first of the Running with Scissors sessions , which Yankovic produced himself . Recording with Yankovic were Jon " Bermuda " Schwartz on drums , Steve Jay on bass , and Jim West on guitar . The album was recorded in six sessions . The first session started on June 29 , 1997 , in which Yankovic recorded the theme song to his television show , The Weird Al Show . The second session , which occurred on October 7 , 1998 , produced the original song " Germs " , and eight days later , on October 15 , Yankovic started the third session and recorded three more originals , " Albuquerque " , " My Baby 's in Love with Eddie Vedder " , and " Truck Driving Song " . The next day , the fourth session resulted in the song " Your <unk> For Today " . On April 19 of the following year , Yankovic recorded four parodies during the fifth session , " Pretty Fly for a Rabbi " , " Jerry Springer " , " It 's All About the Pentiums " , and " Grapefruit Diet " . The album 's sixth and final session occurred on April 20 , and resulted in " The Saga Begins " , and the album 's polka medley , " Polka Power ! " 
 = = = Originals = = = 
 The album includes " The Weird Al Show Theme " , which is the theme song to Yankovic 's short @-@ lived television series . " Germs " , a style parody of industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails that tells of the narrator 's <unk> . " Your <unk> for Today " , is a style parody of third wave ska , features Reel Big Fish members Tavis Werts on trumpet and Dan Regan on trombone , and has lyrics about ridiculous horoscopes . Yankovic attributes the lyrics ' inspiration to the satirical newspaper The Onion . After Ophiuchus was touted by some papers as the " 13th zodiac sign " , Yankovic released new lyrics on his Twitter for the sign . 
 " Albuquerque " , an eleven @-@ minute " hard @-@ driving rock narrative " , is a style parody of The <unk> , and tells the fictional life of Yankovic and his various adventures in the town of Albuquerque , New Mexico . Yankovic originally wrote the song to " annoy people for 12 minutes " . He felt that it would be an " odyssey " for fans to successfully sit through it , and so it was placed at the end of the album . Instead , to Yankovic 's surprise , the song has become a fan favorite . " My Baby 's in Love with Eddie Vedder " is a style parody of zydeco about a man 's frustration that his girlfriend is obsessed with Eddie Vedder , the lead singer for the grunge band Pearl Jam . Musically , the song is in the style of zydeco . " Truck Driving Song " , a detailed account of a truck @-@ driver working , while at the same time worrying about their clothing and makeup , is a style parody of truck @-@ driving country . While writing the song , Yankovic listened to C.W. McCall for inspiration . 
 = = = Parodies and polka = = = 
 The first parody recorded for the album was " Pretty Fly for a Rabbi " , a parody of the Offspring 's 1998 single " Pretty Fly ( For a White Guy ) " , about a hip rabbi . " In order to accurately write the song , Yankovic consulted several of his Jewish friends as well as several English @-@ to @-@ Yiddish dictionaries . The song 's opening line – " <unk> <unk> fun dir a <unk> " – is a Yiddish curse that roughly means " May you turn into a <unk> . " Originally , Yankovic had wanted voice actress Mary Kay Bergman to sing the song as her South Park character Sheila Broflovski . However , due to legal restrictions , she was only able to say a few lines in the finished product . Yankovic then approached actress Fran Drescher to lend her voice to the song , but this was also unsuccessful . Finally , Yankovic was able to get actress Tress MacNeille – who had been featured in his 1983 parody " Ricky " – to appear in the song . 
 The second parody recorded for the album was " Jerry Springer " , a parody of Barenaked Ladies 1998 hit " One Week " . The song is about The Jerry Springer Show , hosted by the eponymous Jerry Springer . To write the song , Yankovic watched " a couple shows " until he understood the " basic formula " for how the episodes unfolded . Originally , there were plans to shoot a video for the song , and an inquiry was sent to Springer to see if he would have liked to be in the video . Before hearing the song , Springer was interested in the possibility of appearing in a video , but after hearing the lyrics , he " balked " and declined , saying that the song was too " negative " towards his show . The third parody recorded for the album was " It 's All About the Pentiums " , a parody of the rock remix of the track " It 's All About the Benjamins " by Sean " Puff Daddy " Combs . Yankovic spoke to Combs personally on the phone to make sure that the parody would not emulate the 1996 Coolio incident . Due to time constraints , Yankovic was forced to write the song a few days before the entire album had to be mastered , as Yankovic had still been waiting for Combs ' approval . By the time Combs responded to him , Yankovic was recording the last session for the album . To give him time to write the lyrics , Yankovic 's band recorded the music first . Yankovic noted that " we were mixing the last few songs on the album by the time I finished writing the lyrics to ' Pentiums , ' and I wound up recording the lead vocals just a couple days before the album had to be mastered . " The fourth parody recorded for the album was " Grapefruit Diet " , a pastiche of " Zoot Suit Riot " by the Cherry Poppin ' Daddies about an obese man going on such a diet . The song 's writer , Steve Perry , called the opportunity to be parodied " an honor " but noted that " Why Weird Al is such an icon is a mystery to me though " . 
 The final parody recorded for the album was " The Saga Begins " , which recounts the plot of Star Wars : Episode I – The Phantom Menace from the point of view of Obi @-@ Wan Kenobi to the tune of the 1971 single " American Pie " by Don McLean . Yankovic , who often bases his albums around significant moments in pop culture , felt that the album should have a song centered on the release of The Phantom Menace . Yankovic first considered writing his parody of " Pretty Fly ( For a White Guy ) " about the film and calling it " Pretty Fly for a Jedi " , but he quickly dismissed this idea ; he wanted to parody a classic song to commemorate how important the new movie was considered . Yankovic then chose to write a parody of " American Pie " about the film . Because Yankovic wanted the song to be topical , he began writing the lyrics in December 1998 , many months before the film was released , gleaning all of the information about the movie 's plot entirely from Internet spoilers . The song was completed two months before The Phantom Menace was released to theaters ; Yankovic had approached Lucasfilm about the prospect of an advanced screening to ensure that his lyrics were accurate , but the company declined . However , Yankovic later went to a charity screening , whose tickets cost US $ 500 each . As a result , Yankovic only had to change one line ; " He 's probably gonna marry her someday " was originally " I hear he 's gonna marry her someday " . A video which Yankovic later jokingly dubbed " Star Wars Unplugged " was filmed for the song , after The Phantom Menace premiered in theaters . 
 Much like Yankovic 's previous albums , Running with Scissors features a polka medley of then @-@ current hit songs called " Polka Power ! " . The song was later released as a promotional single in Germany , where Yankovic 's recording label felt a polka song might have more success . This was the second time that one of Yankovic 's polka medleys was released as a single ; in 1985 , Scotti Brothers Records released " Hooked on Polkas " , from the album Dare to Be Stupid , in Japan . 
 = = = Booklet and disc = = = 
 Since the early 1980s , Yankovic had been known for his hairdo , glasses , and moustache . However , in 1998 , Yankovic shaved his mustache and underwent LASIK eye surgery to correct his vision , and no longer needed glasses . As such , this is his first album with his new style . On the cover , he is shown running on the track at Santa Monica City College . The CD booklet contains the complete lyrics to all but one of the album 's songs ; due to the length of the closing song " Albuquerque " , not all of its lyrics fit on the final page of the booklet . Instead of continuing with the " Albuquerque " lyrics , the end of the booklet breaks off mid @-@ sentence and concludes with an apology from Yankovic , in which he states that there was no way he could have fit the rest of the song 's lyrics on the existing booklet and that he " should have used a smaller font or a bigger piece of paper or something " . Yankovic later released the complete lyrics on the " Ask Al " feature on his website , and had them printed in Weird Al : The Book . 
 Running with Scissors is also the first of " Weird Al " Yankovic 's albums to feature multimedia content . After placing the CD in a CD @-@ ROM drive , one can browse through the files and play a QuickTime movie file containing fourteen minutes of footage from the Disney Channel concert special " Weird Al " Yankovic : ( There 's No ) Going Home .

 Following the release of Running with Scissors , Yankovic undertook a two @-@ year @-@ long tour called " Touring With Scissors " . Starting on July 19 , 1999 , Yankovic played over 200 shows across the United States . A live video recording of one of the shows , called " Weird Al " Yankovic Live ! was released later in the year . To promote the album , two promotional websites were launched for the singles " It 's All About the Pentiums " and " The Saga Begins " : " <unk> " and " <unk> " respectively . Each site featured the respective song 's music video , as well as additional information such as behind @-@ the @-@ scenes notes and lyrics . 
 = = = Reviews = = = 
 The album was met with mostly positive reviews from critics . J.D. Considine of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a " B " rating and felt that , while many comedians are unable to translate jokes onto CD , " Yankovic 's jokes are eminently listenable . " He concluded that " compared with most comedy recordings these days , Running with Scissors is a cut above . " Melissa Ruggieri of the Richmond Times @-@ Dispatch graded the album a " B + " , writing , " Now on his 10th album , the weird and wacky Al tackles gems such as Don McLean 's ' American Pie , ' The Offspring 's ' Pretty Fly ( For a White Guy ) ' and Barenaked Ladies ' ' One Week . ' Most of the results are priceless . " Warren Rhodes of the Anchorage Daily News named the album the fifth best release of 1999 , writing that , " Leaving his long @-@ time label [ Scotti Brothers ] has inspired the parody king ; even his originals are pretty good this time . " He also wrote that " the intellect 's still there , and his wide @-@ ranging chameleon band has no equal . " In The Rolling Stone Album Guide , Running with Scissors was given 3 @.@ 5 stars out of 5 , which denoted that the album averaged between good and excellent . The book wrote that Yankovic 's " nasal whine has never been put to more appropriate use than [ on ] ' Pretty Fly for a Rabbi ' . " 
 Not all reviews were positive . Steve Huey of Allmusic gave the album two and a half stars out of five and called it " a mixed bag " . Huey felt that both " The Saga Begins " and " Jerry Springer " were clever parodies , whereas " Pretty Fly for a Rabbi " and " It 's All About the Pentiums " were not " quite up to his usual standards . " Robert Johnson of the San Antonio Express @-@ News was critical of the album , giving it one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars , noting that " in his haste to stay up to the minute , [ Yankovic ] forgot to make [ ' The Saga Begins ' ] funny . " He wrote that the album " features recycled ideas ( fat jokes , alt @-@ rock hits redone as polkas ) , tunes that sound better than they play ( ' Pretty Fly for a Rabbi ' ) and weirdness for its own sake ( the 11 @-@ minute ' Albuquerque ' ) .

 " Thinkin Bout You " is a song by American singer Frank Ocean , released as the lead single from his debut studio album Channel Orange ( 2012 ) . The song was written by Ocean and produced by Shea Taylor . Originally to be featured on Bridget Kelly 's debut album , Ocean released his original version of the track for free on his tumblr in 2011 . In May 2012 , the song was officially sent to radio and released on iTunes as a single by Ocean . Kelly would later release her own version of the track entitled " Thinking Bout Forever " . 
 Lyrically , the track is about a relationship just out of his reach and the turmoil that ensues . The track also explores feelings of regret and heartbreak . The song received highly positive reviews from music critics , who praised the atmospheric production , Ocean 's falsetto and writing ability . Some critics noted the possible bisexual undertones featured on the track . 
 In September 2012 , the song peaked at position 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 , 94 on the UK Singles Chart , and 13 on the Heatseekers Songs chart . In 2011 , the song received a music video directed by visual art group <unk> released on September 15 . Ocean appears in the violent clip revolving around an inter @-@ dimensional love story and zombies . Ocean performed the track during his seven @-@ show tour through North America and Europe in November 2011 , at the April 2012 Coachella Musical Festival , and his supporting tour for Channel Orange . " Thinkin Bout You " has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) and has sold more than one million units in the United States .

 In early 2011 , Roc Nation recording artist Bridget Kelly and her production team had approached Ocean to write a song for her debut studio album . The song in question eventually became " Thinking About You " , which Kelly commented ; “ it ’ s sort of a vulnerable track and I wanted everyone to feel me on it . ” On July 28 , 2011 , Ocean leaked his demo version of the song onto his tumblr account , with the title stylized as " Thinking Bout You " . The song was then promptly taken down by Ocean . Kelly , who had already performed an acoustic version of the song , retitled her version " Thinking About Forever " following the release of Ocean 's version . Kelly 's version found its way onto her debut EP Every Girl ( 2011 ) . Kelly was ultimately fine with Ocean 's decision , however she noted that she didn 't like how most people thought Ocean 's version was the original , and how people assumed her version was a cover version . About the confusion of the track , Kelly stated 
 Now that push has come to shove , we 're going to let the song have a life of its own . I think it 's an amazing , well @-@ written record . Frank Ocean is incredibly talented , I will never say anything against that . But at the same time , you know , he 's going to do what he wants to do , he 's an artist as well . 
 Ocean later stated why he chose to release his own version of the song , stating that it was still extremely personal to him . On March 8 , 2012 , a re @-@ mastered version of the song premiered on <unk> , intended to be the lead single from Ocean 's debut album . At a listening party in June 2012 , it was confirmed that the track would appear on Ocean 's Channel Orange , which was released on July 17 , 2012 . The version of the track eventually featured on the album was <unk> for a second time , this time to include additional strings and further remastered production . It was released as a digital download on April 17 , 2012 . The song was subsequently released to mainstream radio in the United States on January 29 , 2013 . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Thinkin Bout You " is an R & B song with an atmospheric beat . The track is a tender ballad that " retains Ocean 's signature mellow , minimalist vibe , " reinforced with shimmering synths and silky production . Ocean croons smoothly on the song , while employing a falsetto vocal range in certain sections . MTV columnist Jenna Hally Rubenstein likens Ocean 's singing on " Thinkin Bout You " to Robin Thicke , Justin Timberlake , and Maxwell . The version of the song featured on Channel Orange features an additional string section , opening the track with a swell of strings . 
 Lyrically , " it 's a melancholy record discussing the torturous pain that comes with thinking about someone all the time , even if they may not reciprocate the sentiment . " The track , being originally written for a woman , can be viewed as unisex composition . Following Ocean 's revelation that he has been attracted to people of the same sex , some critics noted that lines such as " my eyes don 't shed tears , but boy they pour when I 'm <unk> bout you " had another additional message , expressing his own thoughts on love . The song has been called a forbidden love track , expressing Ocean 's turmoil about his own hidden sexuality . The refrain " boy " was originally viewed synonym for “ wow ” , though " new urgency " was pumped into the track , adding extra pathos . Ocean reminisces about his " first time " , with an ex @-@ lover who is addressed as " boy " during the song . The track is an apology to an unnamed lover . Lines like " a tornado flew around my room before you came , " serves as a confession , and " excuse the mess it made , it usually doesn 't rain in Southern California " outlines Ocean 's own grief about the situation , admitting the situation got out of control . 
 About Ocean 's writing , Pitchfork Media 's Jordan Sargent stated that the " strength of his songwriting is his ability to make the unfamiliar feel intensely personal , as if you 're a friend that has long known all the particulars of his relationships . " He continued , " Thinking About You " is also more primal , though . The yearning in his falsetto is almost palpable as he flips gender roles and admits that he 's been " thinking about forever , " while simultaneously questioning if the " girl " even had that kinda thing on her mind . " Erika Ramirez of Billboard wrote that the track " gives prominence to his songwriting prowess and sonic versatility , as he intertwines the parallel styles of soul , R & B , jazz and even a bit of funk . " The song has been described as incredibly personal in nature , the " sort of thing that 's best sung by the person who wrote it . " The track telepathically serenades the person who took Ocean 's virginity , and in the " motel room of memories Frank talks eternal love , breaking into a sublime Maxwell @-@ esque falsetto that makes a good case for restoring the style to contemporary mainstream R & B. "

 " Thinkin Bout You " received highly positive reviews from music critics . Pitchfork Media called the song " bewitching " and complimented its crossover potential . Sputnikmusic 's Sobhi Youssef praised the track , commenting that Ocean 's ability to " emote within the confines of a ballad without making it saccharine or cheesy is nearly unparalleled by any of his contemporaries " , citing " Thinkin Bout You " as the framework of most of the album . Pitchfork Media critic Jordan Sargent praised the song , and wrote " this isn 't a tale of bedroom triumph ; instead it 's a beguiling sketch of a relationship just out of his reach . Like many of his songs , the magnetism of " Thinking About You " lies not in the details , but in the lack thereof . " Billboard stated that the " Odd Future member tries out different singing styles , showing off his beautiful falsetto vocal range in certain sections . " MTV journalist Jenna Hally commented that Ocean had a " surprisingly gorgeous falsetto " and " retains Frank 's classic laid @-@ back and relaxed R & B vibe . " Katherine Asaph of Popdust wrote that the track " might as well be Ocean ’ s final audition for R & B stardom " and that it was a " smooth ballad version of " Novacane " without the sleaze getting in the way of its purpose is just about the best thing possible for Ocean ’ s burgeoning fame . The track shatters no earth , and nobody will use it as a ( flawed ) example about how Ocean ’ s changing the R & B game , but in everyone ’ s career is a time for a solid ballad . " 
 John Calvert of The Quietus described " Thinkin Bout You " as a " slow @-@ release torch song the colour of caramel and bathed in low voltage lighting , a buzzing but soothing synth cycle and muffled beats evoke touching and kissing in a velveteen womb . Poised , considered , classy and moving , this is uniquely Frank Ocean . " Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune stated that the track " couldn ’ t be any less auspicious as an opening song , little more than a delicate , yearning falsetto vocal over vaporous keyboards and a muffled rhythm track . " Rolling Stone writer Jody Rosen described the song as " woozy " , featuring Ocean 's " falsetto rippling over murmuring electronic percussion " . She stated that " it 's a bisexual black bohemian New <unk> @-@ turned @-@ <unk> 's avant @-@ R & B torch ballad . And , of course , it 's just a love song – an anthem for anyone , anywhere , who 's found love , and lost it . " 
 Hayley Louise Brown of Clash viewed the song as an important part of the album , musing " opening with a reworked version of heartbreaking ballad ‘ Thinking About You ’ and an instant confrontation with the full force of Ocean ’ s vocal range , the whole record echoes with extra terrestrial Odd Future synths and clumsy piano chords . " Lane Billings of Paste noted the song as whispy in nature , and made a case for Ocean as an R & B revivalist . Consequence of Sound 's Harley Brown of stated that the song moves languidly , " like perfect thoughts about someone missed , until the muscle memory of Ocean ’ s falsetto bursts into the song ’ s upper register . " She continued , " while Ocean might feel this more acutely than either woman who sung those songs , there ’ s a reason Bey shed a tear the first time she heard it . Regardless of how much these lyrics were influenced by lines like , ' By the time I realized I was in love , it was malignant . It was hopeless , ' the ache in Ocean ’ s voice is universal . MSN Music 's Danielle Cheesman felt that Ocean did his followers a service by featuring the song as the album 's opener , describing the track as " the year @-@ old spacey serenade to a boy that became a fan favorite . " She continued , " despite now being enhanced with a strings intro , his falsetto - more importantly - remains in tact over the well @-@ known warped ebb and flow . "

 Rolling Stone named the song the 4th best song of 2012 , calling it " the year 's deepest love song [ that ] won us all . " Complex named the track the fourth best song of 2011 , writing that " Ocean 's voice explores those awkward spaces in a new relationship , making the eternal lover 's questions sound new and urgent . Whatever it is , Frank Ocean 's " Thinking About Forever " is one of those songs that will never get old . " Beyoncé reportedly cried while listening to the song , and wrote Ocean a poem of support . Knowles and Ocean had previously collaborated on the track " I Miss You " . The Village Voice 's Pazz & Jop annual critics ' poll ranked " Thinkin Bout You " at number four to find the best music of 2012 .

 On September 15 , 2011 , a music video directed by visual art group <unk> was released .

Pitchfork Media reported , " it sure looks official , since Frank seems to appear in the bloody , somewhat tragic clip ( in doctor 's garb ) , and Frank posted it on his Tumblr . " It featured Native American cultural imagery and interdimensional elements in its plot . The music video plays out " more like a short film than something you ’ d see on MTV Jams , this visionary piece sees the OFWGKTA crooner play merely a supporting cast role as a doctor . Ocean makes a cameo as a doctor , though " mostly with the back of his head , his footage refreshingly entwined with a girl @-@ saving Native American mystical ritual . " The video explores the dreams of a sick girl , a " few primitive zombie @-@ looking people " , and some " celestial activity . " 
 The Huffington Post wrote that " the video is a dream within a story involving a little girl , a teepee and a few deaths . Cool ! It 's a surprisingly filmic effort , with a sepia mid @-@ century creepiness that calls to mind " Mad Men " plus " Justified , " with a little " Walking Dead " thrown in for good measure . " The Smoking Section commented , " he premise might sound out there , until you watch for yourself and your assumptions become trumped by the visually and mentally stimulating succession of supernatural events . " Prefix Magazine gave the video a positive review , writing " the vid sets Ocean 's doe @-@ eyed crooning against something of an inter @-@ dimensional love story , that or a dreamcatcher @-@ inspired fever dream .

 " Eh , Eh ( Nothing Else I Can Say ) " is a song by American singer Lady Gaga , from her debut album , The Fame ( 2008 ) . It was released as the third single in Australia , New Zealand and selected European countries , and the fourth single in France . The song is a calypso @-@ styled , mid @-@ tempo ballad , and is about breaking up with one 's old partner and finding someone new . Although " Eh , Eh ( Nothing Else I Can Say ) " was never released as a single in her home country , it received mostly negative reviews from US based critics ; who denoted it as " dry and lifeless " , blaming it for halting the " bad @-@ girl party atmosphere " of The Fame . 
 Failing to match the popularity of her previous singles , the song peaked at number fifteen on the Australian ARIA Charts and at number nine on the RIANZ charts of New Zealand . It proved to be successful in Sweden , where it managed to go as far as number two on the Sverigetopplistan chart , as well as Czech Republic , France , and Hungary where it reached the top @-@ ten of the singles charts .

 " Eh , Eh " was written by Gaga with Martin Kierszenbaum , who also produced the track . It was recorded at Cherrytree Recording Studios , Santa Monica , California . In 2005 , Kierszenbaum founded Cherrytree Records along with Jimmy Iovine , then chairman of Interscope Records . After signing a number of artists , he worked with then @-@ unknown Gaga on her debut album , The Fame , producing and writing four songs with her , including the title track . One of these songs was " Eh , Eh ( Nothing Else I Can Say ) " . During recording the track , Gaga fashioned a nickname for Kierszenbaum , called " Cherry Cherry Boom Boom " . They kept the nickname in all the four songs they had worked on . Kierszenbaum later carried on the nickname in all his future projects . Other personnel working on the song included Tony <unk> , who did the audio engineering , Robert Orton for audio mixing and Gene Grimaldi , who mastered the song at Oasis Mastering Studios , Burbank , California . 
 Musically , " Eh , Eh ( Nothing Else I Can Say ) " is credited as a ballad compared to the rest of the dance fuelled tracks from The Fame . The song has a 1980s synthpop and bubblegum pop feeling in it while incorporating the " Eh , Eh " hook from Rihanna 's single " Umbrella " , according to Freedom du Lac from The Washington Post . Gaga stated that the lyrics of " Eh , Eh ( Nothing Else I Can Say ) " are about love and she explained that : " ' Eh , Eh ' is my simple pop song about finding someone new and breaking up with the old boyfriend . " Writer James E. Perone mentioned in his book , The Album : A Guide to Pop Music 's Most Provocative , Influential , and Important Creations , that with the lyrics , Gaga maintained a focus on transitory relationships . Although the lyrics explained her former lover that she had found someone new and did not mean to hurt him with the news , the continuous repetition of the phrase " nothing else I can say " solidifies the transient nature of the relationship portrayed . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony / ATV Music Publishing , the song is set in the time signature of common time with a moderate tempo of 94 beats per minute . Gaga 's vocal range spans from B3 to C ♯ 5 with the main key in which the song is set being E major . The song follows in the chord progression of E – B – F ♯ m – E – B – F ♯ m . Synthpop musician Frankmusik remixed the track for Gaga 's 2010 album , The Remix , where he manipulated Gaga 's vocals and created a dreamy quality with them , as noted by Nicki <unk> from Phoenix New Times . 
 The single was first released in New Zealand on January 10 , 2009 and later in Australia on January 30 , 2009 . " Eh , Eh " was the second most added song on Australian radio on the week beginning December 15 , 2008 . It first began to receive airplay on all Today Network stations . The song was confirmed as an Australian single on Lady Gaga 's official website on January 15 , 2009 . An official remix was also posted on her website that day followed by another one featuring the official cover art . On March 5 , 2009 , a Pet Shop Boys remix — named as " Random Soul Synthetic Mix " — became available for free download on Gaga 's Australian website .

 " Eh , Eh ( Nothing Else I Can Say ) " received mixed to negative reviews from music critics . Alexis Petridis from The Guardian noted that " Eh , Eh " bears the influence of early 1990s Europop and " is the first song in a long time that warrants comparison to the œuvre of Ace of Base . Matthew Chisling of AllMusic gave a negative review of the song saying " The Fame has it 's [ sic ] ' ballad , ' however the breezy ' Eh , Eh ' doesn 't hold water on this album ; rather , it feels dry and lifeless , something which holds this album back " . Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said that " the breezy island vibe and soft demeanor of ' Eh , Eh ( Nothing Else I Can Say ) ' is hard to buy when sandwiched between songs like ' Poker Face ' and ' Beautiful , Dirty , Rich . ' " In another article analysing about the music videos released by Gaga , Oscar Moralde from Slant Magazine noted that " Eh , Eh " as a track " is an intriguing case : rather than the tech @-@ assisted sexy @-@ androgynous dance pop that dominates a good chunk of The Fame , it and its sister tracks ' Brown Eyes ' and ' Again Again ' are evidence of a stripped @-@ down , simpler , sincere Gaga . 
 Evan Sawdey of PopMatters said that the song is the most embarrassing moment of the album and as a result makes the album come to an intermediate halt thus ruining the " bad @-@ girl party atmosphere " . Joey Guerra of Houston Chronicle said that " Eh , Eh " is a bouncy standout with some vocal personality . He also added that " [ It ] would have made a killer Spice Girls single . " Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club called the track scaled @-@ back and criticized Gaga 's vocal abilities in the song . Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called the song listless . Catherine P. Lewis from The Washington Post called the song a chirpy ballad . Christina Martin from The Meridian Star felt that the song , along with " Summerboy " from The Fame , is breezy and upbeat in nature .

 = = Music video = = 
 The Italian @-@ American 1950s @-@ inspired music video , directed by Joseph Kahn , was shot back to back with the video for the song " LoveGame " on the weekend of January 9 , 2009 in Los Angeles . About the video , Gaga explained that " I wanted to show a different side of myself — perhaps a more domestic girly side . And I wanted to create beautiful , stunning ' 50s futuristic fashion imagery that would burn holes in everyone 's brains . " She further clarified that for the fashion aspects in the video she wanted to go in an opposite direction to her usual image . She wanted a yellow based wardrobe believing the color to become a big hit in the fashion world in 2009 . 
 The video starts out showing Little Italy , an icon of the Madonna and Child , and then Gaga riding a Vespa . The first twenty seconds are mainly full of camera shots of different men , Gaga , and the city . The singer roams around with some friends , laughing and joking in a restaurant , while she stands on the seat . Gaga then comes from around the block walking with her friends in pace and singing in the camera . Next , she is shown sleeping in a bed , and waking up to reveal pink high @-@ heeled shoes . She sings and cooks for a man in a house while dancing . She irons clothes while the man is on phone screaming at someone . The two harlequin Great Danes who appear at the start of her " Poker Face " music video , also appear in this one . Finally she lies on a sofa with her legs up on the man . One of the last scene shows her in a yellow dress made of flowers and wearing a yellow watch while singing to the song with a unique hairstyle which shows her hair pulled up and folded over . Then the camera quickly goes back to her in bed . 
 David Balls from Digital Spy noted Gaga 's homage to her Italian @-@ American roots in the video , but wondered if Gaga would " <unk> herself " with the video . Like his review of the single , Moralde found the video to be complimenting the simplistic composition of the song . He believed that with the videos for previous singles , " Just Dance " and " Poker Face " , Gaga 's persona was established , but with the video for " Eh , Eh " she traversed her persona from the original Stefani Germanotta that she was born , to the character Lady Gaga . He explained : " What 's striking about it is how much it feels like Lady Gaga is playacting : the video has a nostalgic , dreamlike tone . Set in a stylized pastel 1950s Little Italy , the video plays heavily with stereotypical and historical shorthand as it displays moustached chefs , macho men in wife beaters , cute <unk> , and spaghetti and meatballs . " He noted that with all of these activities , Gaga created an essential fashion dollhouse , by playing feminine characters . But Gaga addressed the viewer directly in the video while singing the song , which led Morale to deduce that " She 's not in the moment , but is instead playing a feminized role in a dreamlike space ; this quality is accentuated by the bright and blown @-@ out color palette , and the numerous shots of Gaga in bed or sleeping . The cumulative effect is that it asserts the Lady Gaga of the previous videos to be the real one , and the Gaga in ' Eh , Eh ' is a character that she is playing . " His view was shared by Chris Kingston from The Harvard Crimson who noted during the release of the music video for Gaga 's 2010 single " Telephone " , that the video shows " the crazy party girl we know [ ... ] actually has a weirdly girlish , domestic side . " In The Oxford Handbook of Sound and Image in Digital Media , author Carol Vernallis divided Gaga 's persona into three categories . The personality portrayed in the " Eh , Eh " video was named as " Friendly Peer " archetype ; someone with a girl @-@ next @-@ door image and approachable behavior .

 " Eh , Eh " was first performed in a beatbox version at the Cherrytree Studios and was released on Gaga 's first EP , The Cherrytree Sessions . " Eh , Eh " was majorly performed at Gaga 's The Fame Ball Tour in the second segment .

It was accompanied by open toe shoe @-@ boots and fishnet stockings on her leg . 
 As the performance of previous song " Money Honey " ended Gaga appeared on the stage beside Space Cowboy on a Vespa whence the music for " Eh , Eh " starts . The backdrops change to reveal lightning shapes in contrast to the sunny nature of the song . Gaga sang the song in its actual form backed by vocals from DJ Space Cowboy who spun the music from a corner of the stage . As the song reached the chorus Gaga asked the crowd to join her while singing and wave their arms . The New York Times called the live performance as listless . However , The Hollywood Reporter said of the performance that , " In an age of too much information , one of the most refreshing things about Gaga is her mystery . She often hid behind shades , and her mostly incomprehensible , coy and semi @-@ robotic stage patter did little to tell us who 's that Lady . " 
 It was also performed on The Monster Ball Tour , where the song signified her rebirth as she descended from the top amidst white lights and mechanical fog . She wore a giant human sized gyroscope around her , which was developed by the Haus of Gaga and was named " The Orbit " .

 = Unitarian Universalist Church of Arlington = 
 Unitarian Universalist Church of Arlington ( UUCA ) , historically known as the Unitarian Church of Arlington , is a Unitarian Universalist church located at <unk> Arlington Boulevard ( U.S. 50 ) in Arlington County , Virginia . Founded in 1948 , UUCA was the first Unitarian church in Washington , D.C. ' s suburbs . Throughout its history , UUCA has taken part in progressive causes from the Civil Rights Movement to the legalization of same @-@ sex marriage in Virginia . During the Civil Rights Movement , UUCA was the only Virginia church to speak out in favor of racial integration . UUCA 's sanctuary building , designed by local architect Charles M. Goodman in 1964 , is a concrete Brutalist structure that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and Virginia Landmarks Register in 2014 . It is one of only three church buildings designed by Goodman and the only one in Virginia . 
 = = History = = 
 In the early 1940s , leaders from All Souls Church , established in 1821 as the first Unitarian church in Washington , D.C. , encouraged its suburban members to start new Unitarian communities in their respective areas . The first one established in the suburbs was the Unitarian Church of Arlington with support and funds from the " mother church " , All Souls . The first meeting was held in George A. Collier 's home , located at 832 South Courthouse Road , on September 16 , 1943 . The following services were held in various spaces on Sunday afternoons so members could still attend the morning services at All Souls . Meeting spaces included the Buckingham Community Room , Ashton Heights Women 's Club , and Kate Waller Barrett School . Gilbert A. Phillips , an associate pastor at All Souls , became the Arlington church 's minister in 1946 . Membership of the Arlington congregation reached 117 by 1948 while the church school had an enrollment of 103 . That same year members voted to establish their own independent church . Their approved resolution stated : " Be it therefore resolved that the Board of Trustees be petitioned to terminate the Fellowship as an instrumentality of All Souls Church as of March 31 , 1948 , and be it further resolved that this Fellowship then be organized as a Unitarian Church affiliated with the American Unitarian Association . " 
 As membership continued to grow , the congregation needed to find a permanent meeting place . The church purchased a 1 @.@ 07 acre ( 0 @.@ 43 ha ) lot at the intersection of present @-@ day Arlington Boulevard and South George Mason Drive . In November 1948 , ground was broken on the church 's first building , located at 4451 1st Place South , with assistance from the American Unitarian Association which gave the congregation a $ 15 @,@ 000 loan . The original building was designed by architect and church member Earl B. Bailey . It was a brick Colonial Revival building containing an auditorium , a kitchen , an office for the minister , and a few meeting rooms . The first service in the new building was held in June 1949 and it was dedicated on October 2 . By 1950 , church membership had reached almost 250 . The success of the Arlington church convinced All Souls minister Arthur Powell Davies to establish the Greater Washington Association for Unitarian Advance ( later renamed the Greater Washington Association for Unitarian Universalist Churches ) in 1950 . The organization was founded to assist with establishing additional Unitarian congregations in the Washington , D.C. metropolitan area , and All Souls and the Arlington church were its first members . 
 In 1953 a religious education wing , also designed by Bailey , was added to the church building , increasing the size of the auditorium and adding classrooms and offices . By the following year the church building had already reached its capacity and the congregation began holding two services on Sundays . The church school , with an enrollment of over 500 , also began holding two services on Sundays . The church purchased adjoining property and in 1958 constructed the parsonage , a one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half story brick Colonial Revival building . By 1959 , there were eight Unitarian congregations in Washington , D.C. ' s suburbs , with the Arlington church being the largest . The congregation began planning for a new facility and chose Charles M. Goodman , a prominent local architect known for his modernist work , to design the church building . A church committee wrote that it was " confident that Mr. Goodman ’ s concept of design , his wide experience , and his original and creative genius promise for us a distinctive building which will portray in structural form the spirit and aspiration of this congregation . " Church leaders invited the congregation to give suggestions for Goodman 's design which included " an architectural style which would express the inspiring tradition of Unitarianism in Virginia " and a " free form and no stained glass , [ resulting in ] a building to represent our cleavage with the past . " The congregation wanted the building to " reflect their liberal , progressive beliefs and that would signify the UUCA 's leadership position within the denomination . " According to one UUCA minister , " Charles Goodman spent a lot of time with the congregation and incorporating the values and theology of the congregation into the design of the building . " Goodman finished his design in late 1961 and the church began seeking financing shortly thereafter . His design included plans for a main sanctuary and adjoining wing , the latter which was not built at the time due to budget concerns . Construction of the sanctuary was carried out by the Martin Brothers contracting firm . The total cost was approximately $ 300 @,@ 000 , and the dedication was held on March 22 , 1964 , with a sermon by Dana McLean Greeley entitled " Building a Faith for the Future . " UUCA 's sanctuary is one of only three churches designed by Goodman and his only church building in Virginia . His other two church designs are Bethesda United Church of Christ in Bethesda , Maryland , and Christ Church of Washington ( now called Embassy Church ) in Washington , D.C. 
 In the mid @-@ to @-@ late 1960s , attendance at church services and enrollment at the church school experienced dramatic decreases . The congregation replaced their minister and began a campaign to attract new members . Attendance gradually increased over the next several years and by 1974 , membership had reached 724 . The church continued to thrive throughout the next decade and by the late 1980s , church members decided more space was needed . The congregation held meetings regarding the church expansion throughout the next several years . Finally , in 1993 , members approved the construction of an addition to the sanctuary . The new wing , designed by Kerns Group Architects of Washington , D.C. and built by Dustin Construction , Inc. of Gaithersburg , Maryland , was dedicated on October 2 , 1994 . The addition included classrooms and office space , a chapel , and meetings rooms . The design of the new wing was praised by architectural critics and Kerns Group Architects received an Excellence in Architecture award from the American Institute of Architects 's Virginia chapter . An additional expansion , designed by <unk> Group of Fairfax , Virginia , and built by Sully Construction of Sterling , Virginia , was added in 2013 and includes a hall space and multipurpose activity room . UUCA 's 1964 sanctuary was listed on the Virginia Landmarks Register in September 2014 and the National Register of Historic Places on November 19 , 2014 , following a two @-@ year effort for the building to be named a historic landmark . One of the church 's leaders said " We 're hoping by it being put on the national registry , people will realize that the physical presence of a group in a community matters . It says something to the world . " The 900 @-@ member congregation is currently led by Aaron <unk> , a former union representative , and Linda Olson Peebles , an artist and musician who served on the Unitarian Universalist Board of Trustees for eight years and officiated the first same @-@ sex marriage in Virginia in 2014 . Prominent members , past and present , at UUCA include Representative William R. <unk> of Connecticut and Arlington County Board Member Jay <unk> , Virginia 's first openly gay elected official . 
 = = = Activism = = = 
 Like other Unitarian congregations , UUCA is a liberal church that has been active in social justice causes and interfaith dialogue throughout its history . When UUCA was founded , church leaders wrote " Our Church like all Unitarian Churches , is dedicated to the progressive transformation and ennoblement of individual and social life through religion , in accordance with the advancing knowledge and the growing vision of mankind . " In 1949 , a time when most local organizations were segregated , the church operated a children 's summer camp open to all races . During the 1950s , the church was one of the few places in Northern Virginia where black and white individuals met to discuss race relations and ways to improve society . In 1951 , UUCA minister Ross Allen Weston founded the Community Council for Social Progress , an interracial , interfaith group that promoted " full development of democratic principles in human relationship " . UUCA 's members were active during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s , protesting against segregation and other unfair treatments of minorities . UUCA minister Weston , who was also president of the Unitarian Fellowship for Social Justice , even received a letter of gratitude from Martin Luther King , Jr . Following the landmark 1954 Supreme Court decision , Bolling v. Sharpe , which made segregation in Washington , D.C. ' s public schools illegal , Virginia Governor Thomas B. Stanley sought input from the state 's citizens . UUCA was the only Virginia church who spoke out in favor of integration . 
 In October 1958 , the church received a bomb threat the morning of a sermon by Rabbi Emmet A. Frank of Temple Beth @-@ El . This was part of a larger effort by the American Nazi Party , headquartered in Arlington , to intimidate synagogues and other institutions affiliated with or friendly towards Judaism . The bomb threat was widely condemned by area churches and the Arlington congregation released a statement saying it would not be intimidated , harassed , or coerced to change the way it practiced religion . The church continued to support civil rights causes in the 1960s , registering black voters from Arlington County , and renaming its 1949 building ( now demolished ) Reeb Hall in honor of James Reeb , an All Souls minister who was killed by segregationists while protesting in Selma , Alabama . Since the 1970s , church members have continued to advocate social justice causes including , but not limited to , environmentalism , women 's rights , LGBT rights , and affordable housing . One of UUCA 's most prominent projects was the Culpepper Garden Senior Center , a nonprofit retirement housing community for low @-@ income senior citizens , which opened in 1975 and has expanded since then . From the 1990s until it was demolished in 2011 , Reeb Hall was rented out to nonprofit groups including the Northern Virginia chapter of Habitat for Humanity and Arlington Street People 's Assistance Network . Since the 1990s , Kol Ami , a Reconstructionist Jewish community , has met at UUCA in the library and fellowship rooms . 
 = = Design and location = = 
 The church is located on a 3 @.@ 97 acre ( 1 @.@ 61 ha ) lot on the southwest corner of Arlington Boulevard ( U.S. 50 ) and South George Mason Drive near the Arlington Forest neighborhood . The property extends south to First Place South , a residential street where the church parsonage is located . A large parking lot , where Reeb Hall once stood , is on the south and west sides of the property . Church attendees access the building 's 1994 wing from the parking lot via concrete walkways and a concrete pedestrian bridge beneath a steel canopy . South of the church is the Memorial Wall and Garden , dedicated in 1996 . The landscaped garden includes concrete walls , paths , and benches . Concrete blocks inscribed with the names of church members are also found throughout the garden . South of the garden is a playground , built in 2007 , that is enclosed by a wooden fence . The 1964 sanctuary , which faces the road intersection , is on the northeast corner of the property on a wooded knoll . 
 UUCA is composed of three sections : the 1964 sanctuary is a rectangular @-@ shaped , two @-@ story reinforced concrete building ; the 1994 addition is a two @-@ story rectangular @-@ shaped concrete structure on the south side of the sanctuary ; the 2013 addition is a two @-@ story square @-@ shaped concrete structure on the east side of the 1994 addition and southeast corner of the sanctuary . The two additions " complement the original building in their scale , style , material , and fenestration pattern , and fulfill Goodman ’ s original plans to expand the church with additional space for educational , administrative , and social functions . " They are set back and at a lower height in deference to the sanctuary . 
 The sanctuary is a precast concrete building designed in the brutalist style . It features an overhanging concrete flat roof , concrete block foundation , and corrugated concrete wall panels . Square clerestory windows are on the north , east , and west sides of the building 's top level and narrow fixed @-@ light windows are on the first floor . The east and west sides of the sanctuary are five bays wide while the north and south sides feature three bays , a large central bay with a smaller bay on each side . The bays are defined by tall concrete columns , spaced 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) apart , that stand from the ground to the underside of the roof . Pale blue wooden doors flanked by black wooden frames provide access to the sanctuary while there are two narrow doors on the north side . The main entrance to the sanctuary is on the south side where the 1994 addition is sited . The 1994 addition runs along the entire south side of the sanctuary and extends west past the building . It is a 26 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 2 @,@ 400 m2 ) building that includes a social hall , classrooms , and office space . Like the sanctuary , the 1994 addition features a flat roof and concrete foundation . The concrete walls are a lighter color than the sanctuary and are also smoother . A one @-@ story terrace was originally on the southeast corner of the 1994 addition , but this was replaced by the 2013 addition , named the Celebration Center . The Celebration Center is also faced with light @-@ colored concrete and has a random @-@ coursed stone facing on its east side . Similar to the sanctuary , it features an overhanging roof and wrapping clerestory windows . 
 The sanctuary 's meeting space measures 62 feet ( 19 m ) by 62 feet and features a polished reinforced concrete floor set in a large grid pattern . The north , east , and west walls are faced with beige brick while the ceiling is exposed concrete . The sanctuary 's design allows for the meeting space to have natural lighting which is complimented by patterned rows of light fixtures along the ceiling . The fixtures are the original black @-@ painted , metal cylinders designed by Goodman . A 2 @.@ 5 foot ( 0 @.@ 76 m ) high concrete platform stage , now covered with wood , is on the north wall . It features a wheelchair ramp obscured by a decorative wood screen . Seating in the meeting space is composed of padded , moveable pews and chairs . There are two staircase lobbies on the south side of the meeting space that lead to the first floor . The east staircase provides access to the choir balcony via concrete dogleg stairs and an elevator installed in 1974 . Goodman chose to place the choir on the south side of the space because he considered it " the most desirable location for a choir . " The balcony features stepped stairs for choir members and a large pipe organ . The ground floor is a north @-@ south corridor plan with an east @-@ west corridor on the south side giving access to the staircases . The lower floor , which includes meeting and storage spaces , features concrete floors in most areas , concrete block dividing walls , and concrete ceilings . 
 = New World Order ( conspiracy theory ) = 
 As a conspiracy theory , the term New World Order or NWO refers to the emergence of a totalitarian world government . 
 The common theme in conspiracy theories about a New World Order is that a secretive power elite with a globalist agenda is conspiring to eventually rule the world through an authoritarian world government — which will replace sovereign nation @-@ states — and an all @-@ encompassing propaganda whose ideology hails the establishment of the New World Order as the culmination of history 's progress . Many influential historical and present figures have been purported to be part of a cabal that operates through many front organizations to orchestrate significant political and financial occurrences as well as significant world events as steps in an ongoing plot to achieve world domination through secret political gatherings and decision @-@ making processes . 
 Before the early 1990s , New World Order conspiracism was limited to two American <unk> , primarily the militantly anti @-@ government right and secondarily that part of fundamentalist Christianity concerned with the end @-@ time emergence of the Antichrist . Skeptics such as Michael Barkun and Chip Berlet observed that right @-@ wing populist conspiracy theories about a New World Order had not only been embraced by many seekers of stigmatized knowledge but had seeped into popular culture , thereby inaugurating a period during the late 20th and early 21st centuries in the United States where people were actively preparing for apocalyptic millenarian scenarios . Those political scientists were concerned that mass hysteria could have what they judged to be devastating effects on American political life , ranging from the hegemony of right @-@ wing populism in politics to escalating lone @-@ wolf terrorism . 
 = = History of the term = = 
 During the 20th century , many politicians , such as Woodrow Wilson and Winston Churchill , used the term " new world order " to refer to a new period of history characterised by a dramatic change in world political thought and the balance of power after World War I and World War II . They all saw the period as an opportunity to implement idealistic proposals for global governance in the sense of new collective efforts to address worldwide problems that go beyond the capacity of individual nation @-@ states to solve , while always respecting the right of nations to self @-@ determination . These proposals led to the creation of international organizations ( such as the UN and NATO ) , and international regimes ( such as the Bretton Woods system and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) ) , which were calculated both to maintain a balance of power in favor of the United States and to regularize cooperation between nations , in order to achieve a peaceful phase of capitalism . These creations in particular and liberal internationalism in general , however , were regularly criticized and opposed by American paleoconservative business nationalists from the 1930s on . 
 Progressives welcomed these new international organizations and regimes in the aftermath of the two World Wars , but argued that they suffered from a democratic deficit and were therefore inadequate not only to prevent another global war but to foster global justice . The United Nations was designed in 1945 by US bankers and State Department planners , and was always intended to remain a free association of sovereign nation @-@ states , not a transition to democratic world government . Thus , activists around the globe formed a world federalist movement , hoping in vain to create a " real " new world order . 
 British writer and futurist H. G. Wells went further than progressives in the 1940s , by appropriating and redefining the term " new world order " as a synonym for the establishment of a technocratic world state and planned economy . Despite the popularity of his ideas in some state socialist circles , Wells failed to exert a deeper and more lasting influence because he was unable to concentrate his energies on a direct appeal to the <unk> who would ultimately have to coordinate a <unk> new world order . 
 During the Red Scare of 1947 – 1957 , agitators of the American secular and Christian right , influenced by the work of Canadian conspiracy theorist William Guy Carr , increasingly embraced and spread unfounded fears of Freemasons , Illuminati and Jews being the driving force behind an " international communist conspiracy " . The threat of " Godless communism " , in the form of a state atheistic and bureaucratic collectivist world government , demonized as the " Red Menace " , therefore became the focus of apocalyptic millenarian conspiracism . The Red Scare came to shape one of the core ideas of the political right in the United States , which is that liberals and progressives , with their welfare @-@ state policies and international cooperation programs such as foreign aid , supposedly contribute to a gradual process of collectivism that will inevitably lead to nations being replaced with a communist one @-@ world government . 
 Right @-@ wing populist advocacy groups with a paleoconservative world @-@ view , such as the John Birch Society , disseminated a multitude of conspiracy theories in the 1960s claiming that the governments of both the United States and the Soviet Union were controlled by a cabal of corporate internationalists , greedy bankers and corrupt politicians who were intent on using the U.N. as the vehicle to create a " One World Government " . This right @-@ wing anti @-@ globalist conspiracism fuelled the Bircher campaign for US withdrawal from the UN . American writer Mary M. Davison , in her 1966 booklet The Profound Revolution , traced the alleged New World Order conspiracy to the creation of the US Federal Reserve in 1913 by international bankers , who she claimed later formed the Council on Foreign Relations in 1921 as a shadow government . At the time the booklet was published , " international bankers " would have been interpreted by many readers as a reference to a postulated " international Jewish banking conspiracy " masterminded by the Rothschilds . 
 Claiming that the term " New World Order " is used by a secretive elite dedicated to the destruction of all national sovereignties , American writer Gary Allen — in his books None Dare Call It Conspiracy ( 1971 ) , Rockefeller : Campaigning for the New World Order ( 1974 ) , and Say " No ! " to the New World Order ( 1987 ) — articulated the anti @-@ globalist theme of much current right @-@ wing populist conspiracism in the US . Thus , after the fall of communism in the early 1990s , the main demonized scapegoat of the American far right shifted seamlessly from crypto @-@ communists , who plotted on behalf of the Red Menace , to globalists , who plot on behalf of the New World Order . The relatively painless nature of the shift was due to growing right @-@ wing populist opposition to corporate internationalism , but also in part to the basic underlying apocalyptic millenarian paradigm , which fed the Cold War and the witch @-@ hunts of the McCarthy period . 
 In his speech , Toward a New World Order , delivered on September 11 , 1990 during a joint session of the US Congress , President George H. W. Bush described his objectives for post @-@ Cold War global governance in cooperation with post @-@ Soviet states . He stated : 
 Until now , the world we 've known has been a world divided — a world of barbed wire and concrete block , conflict and cold war . Now , we can see a new world coming into view . A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order . In the words of Winston Churchill , a " world order " in which " the principles of justice and fair play ... protect the weak against the strong ... " A world where the United Nations , freed from cold war stalemate , is poised to fulfill the historic vision of its founders . A world in which freedom and respect for human rights find a home among all nations . 
 The New York Times observed that progressives were denouncing this new world order as a rationalization of American imperial ambitions in the Middle East , while conservatives rejected any new security arrangements altogether and fulminated about any possibility of a UN revival . However , Chip Berlet , an American investigative reporter specializing in the study of right @-@ wing movements in the US , writes : 
 When President Bush announced his new foreign policy would help build a New World Order , his phrasing surged through the Christian and secular hard right like an electric shock , since the phrase had been used to represent the dreaded collectivist One World Government for decades . Some Christians saw Bush as signaling the End Times betrayal by a world leader . Secular <unk> saw a bold attempt to smash US sovereignty and impose a tyrannical collectivist system run by the United Nations . 
 American televangelist Pat Robertson , with his 1991 best @-@ selling book The New World Order , became the most prominent Christian popularizer of conspiracy theories about recent American history . He describes a scenario where Wall Street , the Federal Reserve System , the Council on Foreign Relations , the Bilderberg Group and the Trilateral Commission control the flow of events from behind the scenes , nudging people constantly and covertly in the direction of world government for the Antichrist . 
 Observers note that the galvanizing of right @-@ wing populist conspiracy theorists such as Linda Thompson , Mark <unk> and Robert K. Spear into militancy led to the rise of the militia movement , which spread its anti @-@ government ideology through speeches at rallies and meetings , books and videotapes sold at gun shows , shortwave and satellite radio , fax networks and computer bulletin boards . However , it is overnight AM radio shows and viral propaganda on the Internet that have most effectively contributed to their extremist political ideas about the New World Order finding their way into the previously apolitical literature of numerous Kennedy <unk> , <unk> , lost land theorists and , most recently , occultists . From the mid – 1990s on , the worldwide appeal of those subcultures transmitted New World Order conspiracism like a " mind virus " to a large new audience of seekers of stigmatized knowledge . 
 Hollywood conspiracy @-@ thriller television shows and films also played a role in introducing a vast popular audience to various fringe theories related to New World Order conspiracism — black helicopters , FEMA " concentration camps " , etc . — which for decades were previously confined to radical right @-@ wing subcultures . The 1993 – 2002 television series The X @-@ Files , the 1997 film Conspiracy Theory and the 1998 film The X @-@ Files : Fight the Future are often cited as notable examples . 
 Following the start of the 21st century , and specifically during the late @-@ 2000s financial crisis , many politicians and pundits , such as Gordon Brown and Henry Kissinger , used the term " new world order " in their advocacy for a comprehensive reform of the global financial system and their calls for a " New Bretton Woods " that takes into account emerging markets such as China and India . These declarations had the unintended consequence of providing fresh fodder for New World Order conspiracism , which culminated in talk show host Sean Hannity stating on his Fox News Channel program Hannity that the " conspiracy theorists were right " . Fox News in general , and its opinion show Glenn Beck in particular , has been repeatedly criticized by progressive media watchdog groups , for not only mainstreaming the New World Order conspiracy theories of the radical right , but possibly agitating its lone wolves into action . 
 In 2009 , American film directors Luke Meyer and Andrew Neel released New World Order , a critically acclaimed documentary film which explores the world of conspiracy theorists , such as American radio host Alex Jones , who are committed to exposing and vigorously opposing what they perceive to be an emerging New World Order . The growing dissemination and popularity of conspiracy theories has also created an alliance between right @-@ wing populist agitators , such as Alex Jones , and hip hop music 's left @-@ wing populist rappers , such as KRS @-@ One , Professor Griff of Public Enemy and Immortal Technique , thus illustrating how anti @-@ elitist conspiracism can create unlikely political allies in efforts to oppose the political system . 
 = = Conspiracy theories = = 
 There are numerous systemic conspiracy theories through which the concept of a New World Order is viewed . The following is a list of the major ones in roughly chronological order : 
 = = = End Time = = = 
 Since the 19th century , many apocalyptic millennial Christian eschatologists , starting with John Nelson Darby , have predicted a globalist conspiracy to impose a tyrannical New World Order governing structure as the fulfillment of prophecies about the " end time " in the Bible , specifically in the Book of Ezekiel , the Book of Daniel , the Olivet discourse found in the Synoptic Gospels and the Book of Revelation . They claim that people who have made a deal with the Devil to gain wealth and power have become pawns in a supernatural chess game to move humanity into accepting a utopian world government that rests on the spiritual foundations of a syncretic @-@ messianic world religion , which will later reveal itself to be a dystopian world empire that imposes the imperial cult of an “ Unholy Trinity ” of Satan , the Antichrist and the False Prophet . In many contemporary Christian conspiracy theories , the False Prophet will be either the last pope of the Catholic Church ( groomed and installed by an Alta <unk> or Jesuit conspiracy ) , a guru from the New Age movement , or even the leader of an elite fundamentalist Christian organization like the Fellowship , while the Antichrist will be either the President of the European Union , the Secretary @-@ General of the United Nations , or even the Caliph of a pan @-@ Islamic state . 
 Some of the most vocal critics of end @-@ time conspiracy theories come from within Christianity . In 1993 , historian Bruce Barron wrote a stern rebuke of apocalyptic Christian conspiracism in the Christian Research Journal , when reviewing Robertson 's 1991 book The New World Order . Another critique can be found in historian Gregory S. Camp 's 1997 book Selling Fear : Conspiracy Theories and End @-@ Times Paranoia . Religious studies scholar Richard T. Hughes argues that " New World Order " rhetoric libels the Christian faith , since the " New World Order " as defined by Christian conspiracy theorists has no basis in the Bible whatsoever . Furthermore , he argues that not only is this idea unbiblical , it is positively anti @-@ biblical and fundamentally anti @-@ Christian , because by misinterpreting key passages in the Book of Revelation , it turns a comforting message about the coming kingdom of God into one of fear , panic and despair in the face of an allegedly approaching one @-@ world government . Progressive Christians , such as preacher @-@ theologian Peter J. Gomes , caution Christian fundamentalists that a " spirit of fear " can distort scripture and history through dangerously combining biblical literalism , apocalyptic timetables , demonization and oppressive prejudices , while Camp warns of the " very real danger that Christians could pick up some extra spiritual baggage " by <unk> embracing conspiracy theories . They therefore call on Christians who indulge in conspiracism to repent . 
 = = = Freemasonry = = = 
 Freemasonry is one of the world 's oldest secular fraternal organizations and arose during late 16th – early 17th century Britain . Over the years a number of allegations and conspiracy theories have been directed towards Freemasonry , including the allegation that Freemasons have a hidden political agenda and are conspiring to bring about a New World Order , a world government organized according to Masonic principles and / or governed only by Freemasons . 
 The esoteric nature of Masonic symbolism and rites led to Freemasons first being accused of secretly practising Satanism in the late 18th century . The original allegation of a conspiracy within Freemasonry to subvert religions and governments in order to take over the world traces back to Scottish author John Robison , whose reactionary conspiracy theories crossed the Atlantic and influenced outbreaks of Protestant anti @-@ Masonry in the United States during the 19th century . In the 1890s , French writer Léo <unk> wrote a series of pamphlets and books denouncing Freemasonry and charging their lodges with worshiping Lucifer as the Supreme Being and Great Architect of the Universe . Despite the fact that <unk> admitted that his claims were all a hoax , they were and still are believed and repeated by numerous conspiracy theorists and had a huge influence on subsequent anti @-@ Masonic claims about Freemasonry . 
 Some conspiracy theorists eventually speculated that some Founding Fathers of the United States , such as George Washington and Benjamin Franklin , were having Masonic sacred geometric designs interwoven into American society , particularly in the Great Seal of the United States , the United States one @-@ dollar bill , the architecture of National Mall landmarks and the streets and highways of Washington , D.C. , as part of a master plan to create the first " Masonic government " as a model for the coming New World Order . 
 Freemasons rebut these claims of a Masonic conspiracy . Freemasonry , which promotes rationalism , places no power in occult symbols themselves , and it is not a part of its principles to view the drawing of symbols , no matter how large , as an act of consolidating or controlling power . Furthermore , there is no published information establishing the Masonic membership of the men responsible for the design of the Great Seal . While conspiracy theorists assert that there are elements of Masonic influence on the Great Seal of the United States , and that these elements were intentionally or unintentionally used because the creators were familiar with the symbols , in fact , the all @-@ seeing Eye of Providence and the unfinished pyramid were symbols used as much outside Masonic lodges as within them in the late 18th century , therefore the designers were drawing from common esoteric symbols . The Latin phrase " <unk> ordo <unk> " , appearing on the reverse side of the Great Seal since 1782 and on the back of the one @-@ dollar bill since 1935 , translates to " New Order of the Ages " , and alludes to the beginning of an era where the United States of America is an independent nation @-@ state ; it is often mistranslated by conspiracy theorists as " New World Order " . 
 Although the European continental branch of Freemasonry has organizations that allow political discussion within their Masonic Lodges and a few operate as active political lobbies for secularist causes , as exemplified by the Grand Orient of France , Masonic researcher Trevor W. McKeown argues : 
 The accusation that Freemasonry has a hidden agenda to establish a Masonic government ignores several facts . While agreeing on certain Masonic Landmarks , the many independent and sovereign Grand Lodges act as such , and do not agree on many other points of belief and practice . Also , as can be seen from a survey of famous Freemasons , individual Freemasons hold beliefs that span the spectrum of politics . The term " Masonic government " has no meaning since individual Freemasons hold many different opinions on what constitutes a good government . 
 = = = Illuminati = = = 
 The Order of the Illuminati was an Enlightenment @-@ age secret society founded by university professor Adam <unk> on 1 May 1776 , in Upper Bavaria , Germany . The movement consisted of advocates of freethought , secularism , liberalism , republicanism , and gender equality , recruited from the German Masonic Lodges , who sought to teach rationalism through mystery schools . In 1785 , the order was infiltrated , broken up and suppressed by the government agents of Charles Theodore , Elector of Bavaria , in his preemptive campaign to neutralize the threat of secret societies ever becoming hotbeds of conspiracies to overthrow the Bavarian monarchy and its state religion , Roman Catholicism . 
 In the late 18th century , reactionary conspiracy theorists , such as Scottish physicist John Robison and French Jesuit priest Augustin Barruel , began speculating that the Illuminati had survived their suppression and become the masterminds behind the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror . The Illuminati were accused of being subversives who were attempting to secretly orchestrate a revolutionary wave in Europe and the rest of the world in order to spread the most radical ideas and movements of the Enlightenment — anti @-@ clericalism , anti @-@ monarchism , and anti @-@ <unk> — and to create a world <unk> and cult of reason . During the 19th century , fear of an Illuminati conspiracy was a real concern of the European ruling classes , and their oppressive reactions to this unfounded fear provoked in 1848 the very revolutions they sought to prevent . 
 During the interwar period of the 20th century , fascist propagandists , such as British revisionist historian Nesta Helen Webster and American socialite Edith Starr Miller , not only popularized the myth of an Illuminati conspiracy but claimed that it was a subversive secret society which served the Jewish elites that supposedly propped up both finance capitalism and Soviet communism in order to divide and rule the world . American evangelist Gerald Burton <unk> and other conspiracy theorists within the fundamentalist Christian movement in the United States — which emerged in the 1910s as a backlash against the principles of Enlightenment secular humanism , modernism , and liberalism — became the main channel of dissemination of Illuminati conspiracy theories in the U.S .. Right @-@ wing populists , such as members of the John Birch Society , subsequently began speculating that some collegiate fraternities ( Skull and Bones ) , gentlemen 's clubs ( Bohemian Club ) , and think tanks ( Council on Foreign Relations , Trilateral Commission ) of the American upper class are front organizations of the Illuminati , which they accuse of plotting to create a New World Order through a one @-@ world government . 
 There is no evidence that the Bavarian Illuminati survived its suppression in 1785 . 
 = = = The Protocols of the Elders of Zion = = = 
 The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is an antisemitic canard , originally published in Russian in 1903 , alleging a Judeo @-@ Masonic conspiracy to achieve world domination . The text purports to be the minutes of the secret meetings of a cabal of Jewish masterminds , which has co @-@ opted Freemasonry and is plotting to rule the world on behalf of all Jews because they believe themselves to be the chosen people of God . The Protocols incorporate many of the core conspiracist themes outlined in the Robison and Barruel attacks on the Freemasons , and overlay them with antisemitic allegations about anti @-@ Tsarist movements in Russia . The Protocols reflect themes similar to more general critiques of Enlightenment liberalism by conservative aristocrats who support monarchies and state religions . The interpretation intended by the publication of The Protocols is that if one peels away the layers of the Masonic conspiracy , past the Illuminati , one finds the rotten Jewish core . 
 Numerous polemicists , such as Irish journalist Philip Graves in a 1921 article in The Times , and British academic Norman Cohn in his 1967 book Warrant for Genocide , have proven The Protocols to be both a hoax and a clear case of plagiarism . There is general agreement that Russian @-@ French writer and political activist <unk> <unk> fabricated the text for Okhrana , the secret police of the Russian Empire , as a work of counter @-@ revolutionary propaganda prior to the 1905 Russian Revolution , by plagiarizing , almost word for word in some passages , from The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu , a 19th @-@ century satire against Napoleon III of France written by French political satirist and Legitimist militant Maurice Joly . 
 Responsible for feeding many antisemitic and anti @-@ Masonic mass <unk> of the 20th century , The Protocols has been influential in the development of some conspiracy theories , including some New World Order theories , and appears repeatedly in certain contemporary conspiracy literature . For example , the authors of the 1982 controversial book The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail concluded that The Protocols was the most persuasive piece of evidence for the existence and activities of the Priory of Sion . They speculated that this secret society was working behind the scenes to establish a theocratic " United States of Europe " . Politically and religiously unified through the imperial cult of a Merovingian Great Monarch — supposedly descended from a Jesus bloodline — who occupies both the throne of Europe and the Holy See , this " Holy European Empire " would become the <unk> of the 21st century . Although the Priory of Sion itself has been exhaustively debunked by journalists and scholars as a hoax , some apocalyptic millenarian Christian eschatologists who believe The Protocols is authentic became convinced that the Priory of Sion was a fulfillment of prophecies found in the Book of Revelation and further proof of an anti @-@ Christian conspiracy of epic proportions signaling the imminence of a New World Order . 
 Skeptics argue that the current gambit of contemporary conspiracy theorists who use The Protocols is to claim that they " really " come from some group other than the Jews , such as fallen angels or alien invaders . Although it is hard to determine whether the conspiracy @-@ minded actually believe this or are simply trying to sanitize a discredited text , skeptics argue that it does not make much difference , since they leave the actual , antisemitic text unchanged . The result is to give The Protocols credibility and circulation .

 During the second half of Britain 's " imperial century " between 1815 and 1914 , English @-@ born South African businessman , mining magnate and politician Cecil Rhodes advocated the British Empire <unk> the United States of America and reforming itself into an " Imperial Federation " to bring about a <unk> and lasting world peace . In his first will , written in 1877 at the age of 23 , he expressed his wish to fund a secret society ( known as the Society of the Elect ) that would advance this goal : 
 To and for the establishment , promotion and development of a Secret Society , the true aim and object whereof shall be for the extension of British rule throughout the world , the perfecting of a system of emigration from the United Kingdom , and of colonisation by British subjects of all lands where the means of livelihood are attainable by energy , labour and enterprise , and especially the occupation by British settlers of the entire Continent of Africa , the Holy Land , the Valley of the Euphrates , the Islands of Cyprus and Candia , the whole of South America , the Islands of the Pacific not heretofore possessed by Great Britain , the whole of the Malay Archipelago , the seaboard of China and Japan , the ultimate recovery of the United States of America as an integral part of the British Empire , the inauguration of a system of Colonial representation in the Imperial Parliament which may tend to weld together the disjointed members of the Empire and , finally , the foundation of so great a Power as to render wars impossible , and promote the best interests of humanity . 
 In 1890 , thirteen years after " his now famous will , " Rhodes elaborated on the same idea : establishment of " England everywhere , " which would " ultimately lead to the cessation of all wars , and one language throughout the world . " " The only thing feasible to carry out this idea is a secret society gradually absorbing the wealth of the world [ " and human minds of the higher order " ] to be devoted to such an object . " 
 Rhodes also concentrated on the Rhodes Scholarship , which had British statesman Alfred Milner as one of its trustees . Established in 1902 , the original goal of the trust fund was to foster peace among the great powers by creating a sense of fraternity and a shared world view among future British , American , and German leaders by having enabled them to study for free at the University of Oxford . 
 Milner and British official Lionel George Curtis were the architects of the Round Table movement , a network of organizations promoting closer union between Britain and its self @-@ governing colonies . To this end , Curtis founded the Royal Institute of International Affairs in June 1919 and , with his 1938 book The Commonwealth of God , began advocating for the creation of an imperial federation that eventually <unk> the U.S. , which would be presented to Protestant churches as being the work of the Christian God to elicit their support . The Commonwealth of Nations was created in 1949 but it would only be a free association of independent states rather than the powerful imperial federation imagined by Rhodes , Milner and Curtis . 
 The Council on Foreign Relations began in 1917 with a group of New York academics who were asked by President Woodrow Wilson to offer options for the foreign policy of the United States in the interwar period . Originally envisioned as a group of American and British scholars and diplomats , some of whom belonging to the Round Table movement , it was a subsequent group of 108 New York financiers , manufacturers and international lawyers organized in June 1918 by Nobel Peace Prize recipient and U.S. secretary of state Elihu Root , that became the Council on Foreign Relations on 29 July 1921 . The first of the council ’ s projects was a quarterly journal launched in September 1922 , called Foreign Affairs . The Trilateral Commission was founded in July 1973 , at the initiative of American banker David Rockefeller , who was chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations at that time . It is a private organization established to foster closer cooperation among the United States , Europe and Japan . The Trilateral Commission is widely seen as a counterpart to the Council on Foreign Relations . 
 In the 1960s , right @-@ wing populist individuals and groups with a paleoconservative worldview , such as members of the John Birch Society , were the first to combine and spread a business nationalist critique of corporate internationalists networked through think tanks such as the Council on Foreign Relations with a grand conspiracy theory casting them as front organizations for the Round Table of the " Anglo @-@ American Establishment " , which are financed by an " international banking cabal " that has supposedly been plotting from the late 19th century on to impose an oligarchic new world order through a global financial system . Anti @-@ globalist conspiracy theorists therefore fear that international bankers are planning to eventually subvert the independence of the U.S. by subordinating national sovereignty to a strengthened Bank for International Settlements . 
 The research findings of historian Carroll Quigley , author of the 1966 book Tragedy and Hope , are taken by both conspiracy theorists of the American Old Right ( W. Cleon Skousen ) and New Left ( Carl Oglesby ) to substantiate this view , even though Quigley argued that the Establishment is not involved in a plot to implement a one @-@ world government but rather British and American benevolent imperialism driven by the mutual interests of economic elites in the United Kingdom and the United States . Quigley also argued that , although the Round Table still exists today , its position in influencing the policies of world leaders has been much reduced from its heyday during World War I and slowly waned after the end of World War II and the Suez Crisis . Today the Round Table is largely a ginger group , designed to consider and gradually influence the policies of the Commonwealth of Nations , but faces strong opposition . Furthermore , in American society after 1965 , the problem , according to Quigley , was that no elite was in charge and acting responsibly . 
 Larry McDonald , the second president of the John Birch Society and a conservative Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives who represented the 7th congressional district of Georgia , wrote a foreword for Allen 's 1976 book The Rockefeller File , wherein he stated : 
 The drive of the Rockefellers and their allies is to create a one @-@ world government , combining super @-@ capitalism and Communism under the same tent , all under their control ... Do I mean conspiracy ? Yes I do . I am convinced there is such a plot , international in scope , generations old in planning , and incredibly evil in intent . 
 In his 2002 autobiography Memoirs , David Rockefeller wrote : 
 For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well @-@ publicized incidents ... to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions . Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States , characterizing my family and me as ' internationalists ' and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure — one world , if you will . If that 's the charge , I stand guilty , and I am proud of it . 
 Barkun argues that this statement is partly facetious ( the claim of " conspiracy " and " treason " ) and partly serious — the desire to encourage trilateral cooperation among the U.S. , Europe , and Japan , for example — an ideal that used to be a hallmark of the internationalist wing of the Republican Party ( known as " Rockefeller Republicans " in honor of Nelson Rockefeller ) when there was an internationalist wing . The statement , however , is taken at face value and widely cited by conspiracy theorists as proof that the Council on Foreign Relations uses its role as the brain trust of American presidents , senators and representatives to manipulate them into supporting a New World Order in the form of a one @-@ world government . 
 In a 13 November 2007 interview with Canadian journalist Benjamin Fulford , Rockefeller countered : 
 I don 't think that I really feel that we need a world government . We need governments of the world that work together and collaborate . But , I can 't imagine that there would be any likelihood or even that it would be desirable to have a single government elected by the people of the world ... There have been people , ever since I 've had any kind of position in the world , who have accused me of being ruler of the world . I have to say that I think for the large part , I would have to decide to describe them as crackpots . It makes no sense whatsoever , and isn 't true , and won 't be true , and to raise it as a serious issue seems to me to be irresponsible . 
 Some American social critics , such as Laurence H. Shoup , argue that the Council on Foreign Relations is an " imperial brain trust " which has , for decades , played a central behind @-@ the @-@ scenes role in shaping U.S. foreign policy choices for the post @-@ World War II international order and the Cold War by determining what options show up on the agenda and what options do not even make it to the table ; others , such as G. William Domhoff , argue that it is in fact a mere policy discussion forum which provides the business input to U.S. foreign policy planning . Domhoff argues that " [ i ] t has nearly 3 @,@ 000 members , far too many for secret plans to be kept within the group . All the council does is sponsor discussion groups , debates and speakers . As far as being secretive , it issues annual reports and allows access to its historical archives . " However , all these critics agree that " [ h ] <unk> studies of the CFR show that it has a very different role in the overall power structure than what is claimed by conspiracy theorists . " 
 = = = The Open Conspiracy = = = 
 In his 1928 book The Open Conspiracy British writer and futurist H. G. Wells promoted cosmopolitanism and offered blueprints for a world revolution and world brain to establish a technocratic world state and planned economy . Wells warned , however , in his 1940 book The New World Order that : 
 ... when the struggle seems to be drifting definitely towards a world social democracy , there may still be very great delays and disappointments before it becomes an efficient and beneficent world system . Countless people ... will hate the new world order , be rendered unhappy by the frustration of their passions and ambitions through its advent and will die protesting against it . When we attempt to evaluate its promise , we have to bear in mind the distress of a generation or so of malcontents , many of them quite gallant and graceful @-@ looking people . 
 Wells 's books were influential in giving a second meaning to the term " new world order " , which would only be used by state socialist supporters and anti @-@ communist opponents for generations to come . However , despite the popularity and notoriety of his ideas , Wells failed to exert a deeper and more lasting influence because he was unable to concentrate his energies on a direct appeal to <unk> who would , ultimately , have to coordinate the <unk> new world order . 
 = = = New Age = = = 
 British neo @-@ Theosophical occultist Alice Bailey , one of the founders of the so @-@ called New Age movement , prophesied in 1940 the eventual victory of the Allies of World War II over the Axis powers ( which occurred in 1945 ) and the establishment by the Allies of a political and religious New World Order . She saw a federal world government as the culmination of Wells ' Open Conspiracy but favorably argued that it would be <unk> because it was guided by the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom , intent on preparing humanity for the mystical second coming of Christ , and the dawning of the Age of Aquarius . According to Bailey , a group of ascended masters called the Great White Brotherhood works on the " inner planes " to oversee the transition to the New World Order but , for now , the members of this Spiritual Hierarchy are only known to a few occult scientists , with whom they communicate telepathically , but as the need for their personal involvement in the plan increases , there will be an " <unk> of the Hierarchy " and everyone will know of their presence on Earth . 
 Bailey 's writings , along with American writer Marilyn Ferguson 's 1980 book The Aquarian Conspiracy , contributed to conspiracy theorists of the Christian right viewing the New Age movement as the " false religion " that would supersede Christianity in a New World Order . Skeptics argue that the term " New Age movement " is a misnomer , generally used by conspiracy theorists as a catch @-@ all rubric for any new religious movement that is not fundamentalist Christian . By this logic , anything that is not Christian is by definition actively and willfully anti @-@ Christian . 
 Paradoxically , since the first decade of the 21st century , New World Order conspiracism is increasingly being embraced and propagandized by New Age occultists , who are people bored by rationalism and drawn to stigmatized knowledge — such as alternative medicine , astrology , quantum mysticism , spiritualism , and theosophy . Thus , New Age conspiracy theorists , such as the makers of documentary films like Esoteric Agenda , claim that globalists who plot on behalf of the New World Order are simply misusing occultism for Machiavellian ends , such as adopting 21 December 2012 as the exact date for the establishment of the New World Order for the purpose of taking advantage of the growing 2012 phenomenon , which has its origins in the fringe Mayanist theories of New Age writers José Argüelles , Terence McKenna , and Daniel Pinchbeck . 
 Skeptics argue that the connection of conspiracy theorists and occultists follows from their common fallacious premises . First , any widely accepted belief must necessarily be false . Second , stigmatized knowledge — what the Establishment spurns — must be true . The result is a large , self @-@ referential network in which , for example , some UFO religionists promote anti @-@ Jewish phobias while some antisemites practice Peruvian shamanism . 
 = = = Fourth Reich = = = 
 Conspiracy theorists often use the term " Fourth Reich " simply as a pejorative synonym for the " New World Order " to imply that its state ideology and government will be similar to Germany 's Third Reich . However , some conspiracy theorists use the research findings of American journalist Edwin Black , author of the 2009 book Nazi Nexus , to claim that some American corporations and philanthropic foundations — whose complicity was pivotal to the Third Reich 's war effort , Nazi eugenics and the Holocaust — are now conspiring to build a Fourth Reich . 
 Conspiracy theorists , such as American writer Jim Marrs , claim that some ex @-@ Nazis , who survived the fall of the Greater German Reich , along with sympathizers in the United States and elsewhere , given haven by organizations like ODESSA and Die <unk> , have been working behind the scenes since the end of World War II to enact at least some principles of Nazism ( e.g. , militarism , imperialism , widespread spying on citizens , corporatism , the use of propaganda to manufacture a national consensus ) into culture , government , and business worldwide , but primarily in the U.S. They cite the influence of ex @-@ Nazi scientists brought in under Operation Paperclip to help advance aerospace manufacturing in the U.S. with technological principles from Nazi UFOs , and the acquisition and creation of conglomerates by ex @-@ Nazis and their sympathizers after the war , in both Europe and the U.S. 
 This neo @-@ Nazi conspiracy is said to be animated by an " Iron Dream " in which the American Empire , having thwarted the Judeo @-@ Masonic conspiracy and overthrown its Zionist Occupation Government , gradually establishes a Fourth Reich formerly known as the " Western Imperium " — a pan @-@ Aryan world empire modeled after Adolf Hitler 's New Order — which reverses the " decline of the West " and ushers a golden age of white supremacy . 
 Skeptics argue that conspiracy theorists grossly overestimate the influence of ex @-@ Nazis and neo @-@ Nazis on American society , and point out that political repression at home and imperialism abroad have a long history in the United States that predates the 20th century . Some political scientists , such as Sheldon Wolin , have expressed concern that the twin forces of democratic deficit and superpower status have paved the way in the U.S. for the emergence of an inverted totalitarianism which contradicts many principles of Nazism . 
 = = = Alien invasion = = = 
 Since the late 1970s , extraterrestrials from other habitable planets or parallel dimensions ( such as " Greys " ) and <unk> from Hollow Earth ( such as " Reptilians " ) have been included in the New World Order conspiracy , in more or less dominant roles , as in the theories put forward by American writers Stan Deyo and Milton William Cooper , and British writer David Icke . 
 The common theme in these conspiracy theories is that aliens have been among us for decades , centuries or millennia , but a government cover @-@ up enforced by " Men in Black " has shielded the public from knowledge of a secret alien invasion . Motivated by speciesism and imperialism , these aliens have been and are secretly manipulating developments and changes in human society in order to more efficiently control and exploit human beings . In some theories , alien infiltrators have shapeshifted into human form and move freely throughout human society , even to the point of taking control of command positions in governmental , corporate , and religious institutions , and are now in the final stages of their plan to take over the world . A mythical covert government agency of the United States code @-@ named Majestic 12 is often imagined being the shadow government which collaborates with the alien occupation and permits alien abductions , in exchange for assistance in the development and testing of military " flying saucers " at Area 51 , in order for United States armed forces to achieve full @-@ spectrum dominance . 
 Skeptics , who adhere to the psychosocial hypothesis for unidentified flying objects , argue that the convergence of New World Order conspiracy theory and UFO conspiracy theory is a product of not only the era 's widespread mistrust of governments and the popularity of the extraterrestrial hypothesis for UFOs but of the far right and <unk> actually joining forces . Barkun notes that the only positive side to this development is that , if conspirators plotting to rule the world are believed to be aliens , traditional human scapegoats ( Freemasons , Illuminati , Jews , etc . ) are downgraded or exonerated . 
 = = = Brave New World = = = 
 <unk> and neo @-@ Luddite conspiracy theorists emphasize technology forecasting in their New World Order conspiracy theories . They speculate that the global power elite are reactionary modernists pursuing a transhumanist agenda to develop and use human enhancement technologies in order to become a " posthuman ruling caste " , while change accelerates toward a technological singularity — a theorized future point of discontinuity when events will accelerate at such a pace that normal <unk> humans will be unable to predict or even understand the rapid changes occurring in the world around them . Conspiracy theorists fear the outcome will either be the emergence of a Brave New World @-@ like dystopia — a " Brave New World Order " — or the extinction of the human species . 
 Democratic <unk> , such as American sociologist James Hughes , counter that many influential members of the United States Establishment are <unk> strongly opposed to human enhancement , as demonstrated by President Bush 's Council on Bioethics 's proposed international treaty prohibiting human cloning and germline engineering . Furthermore , he argues that conspiracy theorists underestimate how fringe the transhumanist movement really is . 
 = = <unk> implementations = = 
 Just as there are several overlapping or conflicting theories among conspiracists about the nature of the New World Order , so are there several beliefs about how its architects and planners will implement it : 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Conspiracy theorists generally speculate that the New World Order is being implemented gradually , citing the formation of the U.S. Federal Reserve System in 1913 ; the League of Nations in 1919 ; the International Monetary Fund in 1944 ; the United Nations in 1945 ; the World Bank in 1945 ; the World Health Organization in 1948 ; the European Union and the euro currency in 1993 ; the World Trade Organization in 1998 ; the African Union in 2002 ; and the Union of South American Nations in 2008 as major milestones . 
 An increasingly popular conspiracy theory among American right @-@ wing populists is that the hypothetical North American Union and the <unk> currency , proposed by the Council on Foreign Relations and its counterparts in Mexico and Canada , will be the next milestone in the implementation of the New World Order . The theory holds that a group of shadowy and mostly nameless international elites are planning to replace the federal government of the United States with a transnational government . Therefore , conspiracy theorists believe the borders between Mexico , Canada and the United States are in the process of being erased , covertly , by a group of globalists whose ultimate goal is to replace national governments in Washington , D.C. , Ottawa and Mexico City with a European @-@ style political union and a bloated <unk> bureaucracy . 
 Skeptics argue that the North American Union exists only as a proposal contained in one of a thousand academic and / or policy papers published each year that advocate all manner of idealistic but ultimately unrealistic approaches to social , economic and political problems . Most of these are passed around in their own circles and eventually filed away and forgotten by junior staffers in congressional offices . Some of these papers , however , become touchstones for the conspiracy @-@ minded and form the basis of all kinds of unfounded xenophobic fears especially during times of economic anxiety . 
 For example , in March 2009 , as a result of the late @-@ 2000s financial crisis , the People 's Republic of China and the Russian Federation pressed for urgent consideration of a new international reserve currency and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development proposed greatly expanding the <unk> ' s special drawing rights . Conspiracy theorists fear these proposals are a call for the U.S. to adopt a single global currency for a New World Order . 
 Judging that both national governments and global institutions have proven ineffective in addressing worldwide problems that go beyond the capacity of individual nation @-@ states to solve , some political scientists critical of New World Order conspiracism , such as Mark C. Partridge , argue that regionalism will be the major force in the coming decades , pockets of power around regional centers : Western Europe around Brussels , the Western Hemisphere around Washington , D.C. , East Asia around Beijing , and Eastern Europe around Moscow . As such , the E.U. , the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation , and the G @-@ 20 will likely become more influential as time progresses . The question then is not whether global governance is gradually emerging , but rather how will these regional powers interact with one another . 
 = = = Coup d 'état = = = 
 American right @-@ wing populist conspiracy theorists , especially those who joined the militia movement in the United States , speculate that the New World Order will be implemented through a dramatic coup d 'état by a " secret team " , using black helicopters , in the U.S. and other nation @-@ states to bring about a totalitarian world government controlled by the United Nations and enforced by troops of foreign U.N. peacekeepers . Following the Rex 84 and Operation Garden Plot plans , this military coup would involve the suspension of the Constitution , the imposition of martial law , and the appointment of military commanders to head state and local governments and to detain dissidents . 
 These conspiracy theorists , who are all strong believers in a right to keep and bear arms , are extremely fearful that the passing of any gun control legislation will be later followed by the abolishment of personal gun ownership and a campaign of gun confiscation , and that the refugee camps of emergency management agencies such as FEMA will be used for the internment of suspected subversives , making little effort to distinguish true threats to the New World Order from pacifist dissidents . 
 Before year 2000 some survivalists wrongly believed this process would be set in motion by the predicted Y2K problem causing societal collapse . Since many left @-@ wing and right @-@ wing conspiracy theorists believe that the September 11 attacks were a false flag operation carried out by the United States intelligence community , as part of a strategy of tension to justify political repression at home and preemptive war abroad , they have become convinced that a more catastrophic terrorist incident will be responsible for triggering Executive Directive 51 in order to complete the transition to a police state . 
 Skeptics argue that unfounded fears about an imminent or eventual gun ban , military coup , internment , or U.N. invasion and occupation are rooted in the siege mentality of the American militia movement but also an apocalyptic millenarianism which provides a basic narrative within the political right in the U.S. , claiming that the idealized society ( i.e. , constitutional republic , Jeffersonian democracy , " Christian nation " , " white nation " ) is thwarted by subversive conspiracies of liberal secular humanists who want " Big Government " and globalists who plot on behalf of the New World Order . 
 = = = Mass surveillance = = = 
 Conspiracy theorists concerned with surveillance abuse believe that the New World Order is being implemented by the cult of intelligence at the core of the surveillance @-@ industrial complex through mass surveillance and the use of Social Security numbers , the bar @-@ coding of retail goods with Universal Product Code markings , and , most recently , RFID tagging by microchip implants . 
 Claiming that corporations and government are planning to track every move of consumers and citizens with RFID as the latest step toward a 1984 @-@ like surveillance state , consumer privacy advocates , such as Katherine Albrecht and Liz McIntyre , have become Christian conspiracy theorists who believe <unk> must be resisted because they argue that modern database and communications technologies , coupled with point of sale data @-@ capture equipment and sophisticated ID and authentication systems , now make it possible to require a <unk> associated number or mark to make purchases . They fear that the ability to implement such a system closely resembles the Number of the Beast prophesied in the Book of Revelation . 
 In January 2002 , the Information Awareness Office ( IAO ) was established by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) to bring together several DARPA projects focused on applying information technology to counter asymmetric threats to national security . Following public criticism that the development and deployment of these technologies could potentially lead to a mass surveillance system , the IAO was defunded by the United States Congress in 2003 . The second source of controversy involved IAO ’ s original logo , which depicted the " all @-@ seeing " Eye of Providence atop of a pyramid looking down over the globe , accompanied by the Latin phrase <unk> est <unk> ( knowledge is power ) . Although DARPA eventually removed the logo from its website , it left a lasting impression on privacy advocates . It also inflamed conspiracy theorists , who misinterpret the " eye and pyramid " as the Masonic symbol of the Illuminati , an 18th @-@ century secret society they speculate continues to exist and is plotting on behalf of a New World Order . 
 American historian Richard Landes , who specializes in the history of apocalypticism and was co @-@ founder and director of the Center for Millennial Studies at Boston University , argues that new and emerging technologies often trigger alarmism among millenarians and even the introduction of Gutenberg 's printing press in 1436 caused waves of apocalyptic thinking . The Year 2000 problem , bar codes and Social Security numbers all triggered end @-@ time warnings which either proved to be false or simply were no longer taken seriously once the public became accustomed to these technological changes . Civil libertarians argue that the privatization of surveillance and the rise of the surveillance @-@ industrial complex in the United States does raise legitimate concerns about the erosion of privacy . However , skeptics of mass surveillance conspiracism caution that such concerns should be disentangled from secular paranoia about Big Brother or religious hysteria about the Antichrist . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Conspiracy theorists of the Christian right , starting with British revisionist historian Nesta Helen Webster , believe there is an ancient occult conspiracy — started by the first <unk> of Gnosticism and perpetuated by their alleged esoteric successors , such as the Kabbalists , Cathars , Knights Templar , <unk> , Rosicrucians , Freemasons , and , ultimately , the Illuminati — which seeks to subvert the Judeo @-@ Christian foundations of the Western world and implement the New World Order through a one @-@ world religion that prepares the masses to embrace the imperial cult of the Antichrist . More broadly , they speculate that globalists who plot on behalf of a New World Order are directed by occult agencies of some sort : unknown superiors , spiritual hierarchies , demons , fallen angels and / or Lucifer . They believe that these conspirators use the power of occult sciences ( numerology ) , symbols ( Eye of Providence ) , rituals ( Masonic degrees ) , monuments ( National Mall landmarks ) , buildings ( Manitoba Legislative Building ) and facilities ( Denver International Airport ) to advance their plot to rule the world . 
 For example , in June 1979 , an unknown benefactor under the pseudonym " R. C. Christian " had a huge granite megalith built in the U.S. state of Georgia , which acts like a compass , calendar , and clock . A message comprising ten guides is inscribed on the occult structure in many languages to serve as instructions for survivors of a doomsday event to establish a more enlightened and sustainable civilization than the one which was destroyed . The " Georgia <unk> " have subsequently become a spiritual and political Rorschach test onto which any number of ideas can be imposed . Some New Agers and neo @-@ pagans revere it as a ley @-@ line power nexus while a few conspiracy theorists are convinced that they are engraved with the New World Order 's anti @-@ Christian " Ten Commandments . " Should the <unk> survive for centuries as their creators intended , many more meanings could arise , equally unrelated to the designer ’ s original intention . 
 Skeptics argue that the demonization of Western esotericism by conspiracy theorists is rooted in religious intolerance but also in the same moral panics that have fueled witch trials in the Early Modern period , and satanic ritual abuse allegations in the United States . 
 = = = Population control = = = 
 Conspiracy theorists believe that the New World Order will also be implemented through the use of human population control in order to more easily monitor and control the movement of individuals . The means range from stopping the growth of human societies through reproductive health and family planning programs , which promote abstinence , contraception and abortion , or intentionally reducing the bulk of the world population through genocides by mongering unnecessary wars , through plagues by engineering emergent viruses and tainting vaccines , and through environmental disasters by controlling the weather ( HAARP , chemtrails ) , etc . Conspiracy theorists argue that globalists plotting on behalf of a New World Order are neo @-@ <unk> who engage in overpopulation and climate change alarmism in order to create public support for coercive population control and ultimately world government . Agenda 21 is condemned as " <unk> " people into urban areas and depopulating rural ones , even generating a dystopian novel by Glenn Beck where single @-@ family homes are a distant memory . 
 Skeptics argue that fears of population control can be traced back to the traumatic legacy of the eugenics movement 's " war against the weak " in the United States during the first decades of the 20th century but also the Second Red Scare in the U.S. during the late 1940s and 1950s , and to a lesser extent in the 1960s , when activists on the far right of American politics routinely opposed public health programs , notably water fluoridation , mass vaccination and mental health services , by asserting they were all part of a far @-@ reaching plot to impose a socialist or communist regime . Their views were influenced by opposition to a number of major social and political changes that had happened in recent years : the growth of internationalism , particularly the United Nations and its programs ; the introduction of social welfare provisions , particularly the various programs established by the New Deal ; and government efforts to reduce inequalities in the social structure of the U.S .. 
 = = = Mind control = = = 
 Social critics accuse governments , corporations , and the mass media of being involved in the manufacturing of a national consensus and , paradoxically , a culture of fear due to the potential for increased social control that a mistrustful and mutually fearing population might offer to those in power . The worst fear of some conspiracy theorists , however , is that the New World Order will be implemented through the use of mind control — a broad range of tactics able to subvert an individual 's control of his or her own thinking , behavior , emotions , or decisions . These tactics are said to include everything from Manchurian candidate @-@ style brainwashing of sleeper agents ( Project <unk> , " Project Monarch " ) to engineering psychological operations ( water fluoridation , subliminal advertising , " Silent Sound Spread Spectrum " , <unk> ) and parapsychological operations ( Stargate Project ) to influence the masses . The concept of wearing a tin foil hat for protection from such threats has become a popular stereotype and term of derision ; the phrase serves as a byword for paranoia and is associated with conspiracy theorists . 
 Skeptics argue that the paranoia behind a conspiracy theorist 's obsession with mind control , population control , occultism , surveillance abuse , Big Business , Big Government , and globalization arises from a combination of two factors , when he or she : 1 ) holds strong individualist values and 2 ) lacks power . The first attribute refers to people who care deeply about an individual 's right to make their own choices and direct their own lives without interference or obligations to a larger system ( like the government ) , but combine this with a sense of powerlessness in one 's own life , and one gets what some psychologists call " agency panic , " intense anxiety about an apparent loss of autonomy to outside forces or regulators . When fervent individualists feel that they cannot exercise their independence , they experience a crisis and assume that larger forces are to blame for usurping this freedom . 
 = = Alleged conspirators = = 
 According to Domhoff , many people seem to believe that the United States is ruled from behind the scenes by a conspiratorial elite with secret desires , i.e. , by a small secretive group that wants to change the government system or put the country under the control of a world government . In the past the conspirators were usually said to be crypto @-@ communists who were intent upon bringing the United States under a common world government with the Soviet Union , but the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 undercut that theory . Domhoff notes that most conspiracy theorists changed their focus to the United Nations as the likely controlling force in a New World Order , an idea which is undermined by the powerlessness of the U.N. and the unwillingness of even moderates within the American Establishment to give it anything but a limited role . 
 Although skeptical of New World Order conspiracism , political scientist David Rothkopf argues , in the 2008 book <unk> : The Global Power Elite and the World They Are Making , that the world population of 6 billion people is governed by an elite of 6 @,@ 000 individuals . Until the late 20th century , governments of the great powers provided most of the superclass , accompanied by a few heads of international movements ( i.e. , the Pope of the Catholic Church ) and entrepreneurs ( Rothschilds , Rockefellers ) . According to Rothkopf , in the early 21st century , economic clout — fueled by the explosive expansion of international trade , travel and communication — rules ; the nation @-@ state 's power has diminished shrinking politicians to minority power broker status ; leaders in international business , finance and the defense industry not only dominate the superclass , they move freely into high positions in their nations ' governments and back to private life largely beyond the notice of elected legislatures ( including the U.S. Congress ) , which remain abysmally ignorant of affairs beyond their borders . He asserts that the superclass ' disproportionate influence over national policy is constructive but always self @-@ interested , and that across the world , few object to corruption and oppressive governments provided they can do business in these countries . 
 Viewing the history of the world as the history of warfare between secret societies , conspiracy theorists go further than Rothkopf , and other scholars who have studied the global power elite , by claiming that established upper @-@ class families with " old money " who founded and finance the Bilderberg Group , Bohemian Club , Club of Rome , Council on Foreign Relations , Rhodes Trust , Skull and Bones , Trilateral Commission , and similar think tanks and private clubs , are illuminated conspirators plotting to impose a totalitarian New World Order — the implementation of an authoritarian world government controlled by the United Nations and a global central bank , which maintains political power through the <unk> of the economy , regulation and restriction of speech through the concentration of media ownership , mass surveillance , widespread use of state terrorism , and an all @-@ encompassing propaganda that creates a cult of personality around a puppet world leader and <unk> world government as the culmination of history 's progress . 
 Marxists , who are skeptical of right @-@ wing populist conspiracy theories , also accuse the global power elite of not having the best interests of all at heart , and many intergovernmental organizations of suffering from a democratic deficit , but they argue that the superclass are plutocrats only interested in brazenly imposing a neoliberal or neoconservative new world order — the implementation of global capitalism through economic and military coercion to protect the interests of transnational corporations — which systematically undermines the possibility of a socialist one @-@ world government . Arguing that the world is in the middle of a transition from the American Empire to the rule of a global ruling class that has emerged from within the American Empire , they point out that right @-@ wing populist conspiracy theorists , blinded by their anti @-@ communism , fail to see is that what they demonize as the " New World Order " is , ironically , the highest stage of the very capitalist economic system they defend . 
 = = Criticisms = = 
 Skeptics of New World Order conspiracy theories accuse its proponents of indulging in the furtive fallacy , a belief that significant facts of history are necessarily sinister ; conspiracism , a world view that centrally places conspiracy theories in the unfolding of history , rather than social and economic forces ; and fusion paranoia , a promiscuous absorption of fears from any source whatsoever . 
 Domhoff , a research professor in psychology and sociology who studies theories of power , writes in a March 2005 essay entitled There Are No Conspiracies : 
 There are several problems with a conspiratorial view that don 't fit with what we know about power structures . First , it assumes that a small handful of wealthy and highly educated people somehow develop an extreme psychological desire for power that leads them to do things that don 't fit with the roles they seem to have . For example , that rich capitalists are no longer out to make a profit , but to create a one @-@ world government . Or that elected officials are trying to get the constitution suspended so they can assume dictatorial powers . These kinds of claims go back many decades now , and it is always said that it is really going to happen this time , but it never does . Since these claims have proved wrong dozens of times by now , it makes more sense to assume that leaders act for their usual reasons , such as profit @-@ seeking motives and institutionalized roles as elected officials . Of course they want to make as much money as they can , and be elected by huge margins every time , and that can lead them to do many unsavory things , but nothing in the ballpark of creating a one @-@ world government or suspending the constitution . 
 Partridge , a contributing editor to the global affairs magazine Diplomatic Courier , writes in a December 2008 article entitled One World Government : Conspiracy Theory or Inevitable Future ? : 
 I am skeptical that " global governance " could " come much sooner than that [ 200 years ] , " as [ journalist Gideon Rachman ] posits . For one thing , nationalism — the natural counterpoint to global government — is rising . Some leaders and peoples around the world have resented Washington 's chiding and hubris over the past two decade of American <unk> . Russia has been re @-@ establishing itself as a " great power " ; few could miss the national pride on display when China hosted the Beijing Olympics this summer ; while Hugo Chavez and his ilk have stoked the national flames with their anti @-@ American rhetoric . The departing of the Bush Administration could cause this nationalism to abate , but economic uncertainty usually has the opposite effect . [ ... ] Another point is that attempts at global government and global agreements have been categorical failures . The WTO ’ s Doha Round is dead in the water , Kyoto excluded many of the leading polluters and a conference to establish a deal was a failure , and there is a race to the bottom in terms of corporate taxes — rather than an existing global framework . And , where supranational governance structures exist , they are noted for their bureaucracy and inefficiency : The UN has been unable to stop an American @-@ led invasion of Iraq , genocide in Darfur , the slow collapse of Zimbabwe , or Iran 's continued uranium enrichment . That is not to belittle the structure , as I deem it essential , but the system ’ s flaws are there for all to see . 
 Although some cultural critics see <unk> theories about a New World Order as " postmodern <unk> " that may be politically empowering , a way of giving ordinary people a narrative structure with which to question what they see around them , skeptics argue that conspiracism leads people into cynicism , convoluted thinking , and a tendency to feel it is hopeless even as they denounce the alleged conspirators . 
 Alexander <unk> from the Southern Poverty Law Center wrote a report titled " ' Patriot ' Paranoia : A Look at the Top Ten Conspiracy Theories " , in which he personally condemns such conspiracies are an effort of the radical right to undermine society . 
 Scholars continue to debate the psychological and sociological origins of conspiracy theories , but there is no arguing that these theories have seen a revival on the extreme right in recent years . Over the last two decades , a far @-@ right conspiracy culture of self @-@ proclaimed " Patriots " has emerged in which the United States government itself is viewed as a mortal threat to everything from constitutional democracy to the survival of the human race . This conspiracy revival — which has been accompanied by the explosive growth of Patriot groups over the last year and a half — kicked into overdrive with the 2008 election of President Barack Obama , who is seen by Patriots as a foreign @-@ born Manchurian candidate sent by forces of the so @-@ called " New World Order " to destroy American sovereignty and institute one @-@ world socialist government . [ 1 ] 
 Concerned that the improvisational millennialism of most conspiracy theories about a New World Order might motivate lone wolves to engage in leaderless resistance leading to domestic terrorist incidents like the Oklahoma City bombing , Barkun writes : 
 The danger lies less in such beliefs themselves ... than in the behavior they might stimulate or justify . As long as the New World Order appeared to be almost but not quite a reality , devotees of conspiracy theories could be expected to confine their activities to propagandizing . On the other hand , should they believe that the prophesied evil day had in fact arrived , their behavior would become far more difficult to predict . 
 Warning of the threat to American democracy posed by right @-@ wing populist movements led by demagogues who mobilize support for mob rule or even a fascist revolution by exploiting the fear of conspiracies , Berlet writes : 
 Right @-@ wing populist movements can cause serious damage to a society because they often popularize xenophobia , authoritarianism , scapegoating , and conspiracism . This can lure mainstream politicians to adopt these themes to attract voters , legitimize acts of discrimination ( or even violence ) , and open the door for revolutionary right @-@ wing populist movements , such as fascism , to recruit from the reformist populist movements . 
 Hughes , a professor of religion , warns that no religious idea has greater potential for shaping global politics in profoundly negative ways than " the new world order " . He writes in a February 2011 article entitled Revelation , Revolutions , and the <unk> New World Order : 
 The crucial piece of this puzzle is the identity of the Antichrist , the tyrannical figure who both leads and inspires the new world order . [ ... ] for many years , rapture theologians identified the Soviet Union as the Antichrist . But after Sept . 11 , they became quite certain that the Antichrist was closely connected with the Arab world and the Muslim religion . This means , quite simply , that for rapture theologians , Islam stands at the heart of the tyrannical " new world order . " Precisely here we discover why the idea of a " new world order " has such potential to move global politics in profoundly negative directions , for rapture theologians typically welcome war with the Islamic world . As Bill Moyers wrote of the rapture theologians , " A war with Islam in the Middle East is not something to be feared but welcomed — an essential conflagration on the road to redemption . " Further , rapture theologians co @-@ opt the United States as a tool in their cosmic vision — a tool God will use to smite the Antichrist and the enemies of righteousness . This is why Tim LaHaye , co @-@ author of the best @-@ selling series of end @-@ times books , could lend such strong support to the American invasion and occupation of Iraq . By virtue of that war , LaHaye believed , Iraq would become " a focal point of end @-@ times events . " Even more disturbing is the fact that rapture theologians blissfully open the door to nuclear holocaust . Rapture theologians have always held that God will destroy his enemies at the end of time in the Great Battle of Armageddon . But since World War II , they have increasingly identified Armageddon with nuclear weaponry , thereby lending biblical inevitability to the prospects of nuclear annihilation . As one prophecy writer put it , " The holocaust of atomic war would fulfill the prophecies . " 
 Criticisms of New World Order conspiracy theorists also come from within their own community . Despite believing themselves to be " freedom fighters " , many right @-@ wing populist conspiracy theorists hold views that are incompatible with their professed libertarianism , such as <unk> , white <unk> , and even <unk> . This paradox has led Icke , who argues that Christian Patriots are the only Americans who understand the truth about the New World Order ( which he believes is controlled by a race of reptilians known as the " Babylonian Brotherhood " ) , to reportedly tell a Christian Patriot group : 
 I don 't know which I dislike more , the world controlled by the Brotherhood , or the one you want to replace it with . 
 = Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water ' fore I Diiie = 
 Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water ' fore I Diiie ( 1971 ) is the first collection of poems by African @-@ American writer and poet , Maya Angelou . Many of the poems in Diiie were originally song lyrics , written during Angelou 's career as a night club performer , and recorded on two albums before the publication of Angelou 's first autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings ( 1969 ) . Angelou considers herself a poet and a playwright , but is best known for her seven autobiographies . She began , early in her writing career , of alternating the publication of an autobiography and a volume of poetry . Although her poetry collections have been best @-@ sellers , they have not received serious critical attention and are more interesting when read aloud . 
 Diiie is made up of two sections of 38 poems . The 20 poems in the first section , " Where Love is a Scream of Anguish " , center on love . Many of the poems in this section and the next are structured like blues and jazz music , and have universal themes of love and loss . The eighteen poems in the second section , " Just Before the World Ends " , focus on the experience of the survival of African Americans despite living in a society dominated by whites . 
 Angelou uses the vernacular of African Americans , irony , understatement , and humor to make her statements about race and racism in America . She acts as a spokesperson for her race in these poems , in which her use of irony and humor allows her to speak for the collective and to assume a distance in order to make comments about her themes , topics , and subjects . Critic Kathy M. Essick have called the poems in Diiie " protest poems " . The metaphors in her poetry serve as " coding " , or litotes , for meanings understood by other Blacks , although her themes and topics are universal for most readers to understand . 
 Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water ' fore I Diiie has received mixed reviews from critics , but was a best @-@ seller and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize . Many critics expected that the volume would be popular despite their negative reviews , but others considered it well @-@ written , lyrical , and a moving expression of social observation . 
 = = Background = = 
 Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water ' fore I Diiie is Maya Angelou 's first volume of poetry . She studied and began writing poetry at a young age . After her rape at the age of eight , as recounted in her first autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings , she dealt with her trauma by memorizing and reciting great works of literature , including poetry , which helped bring her out her self @-@ imposed muteness . 
 Angelou recorded two albums of poetry and songs she wrote during her career as a night club performer ; the first in 1957 for Liberty Records and the second " The Poetry of Maya Angelou " , for GWP Records the year before the publication of her first autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings ( 1969 ) . They were later incorporated into her volumes of poetry , including Diiie , which was published the year after Caged Bird became a best @-@ seller . Diiie also became a best @-@ seller , and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize . Despite thinking of herself a playwright and poet when her editor Robert Loomis challenged her to write Caged Bird , she has been best known for her autobiographies . Many of Angelou 's readers identify her as a poet first and an autobiographer second , yet like Lynn Z. Bloom , many critics consider her autobiographies more important than her poetry . Critic William Sylvester agrees , and states that although her books have been best @-@ sellers , her poetry has not been perceived as seriously her prose . Bloom also believes that Angelou 's poetry is more interesting when she recites them . Bloom considers her performances dynamic , and says that Angelou " moves exuberantly , vigorously to reinforce the rhythms of the lines , the tone of the words . Her singing and dancing and electrifying stage presence transcend the predictable words and phrases " . 
 Angelou 's began , early in her writing career , of alternating the publication of an autobiography and a volume of poetry . Her publisher , Random House , placed the poems in Diiie , along with her next four volumes , in her first collection of poetry , The Complete Collected Poems of Maya Angelou ( 1994 ) , perhaps to capitalize on her popularity following her reading of her poem " On the Pulse of Morning " at President Bill Clinton 's inauguration in 1993 . A year later , in 1995 , Angelou 's publisher placed four more poems in a smaller volume , entitled Phenomenal Woman . 
 = = = Title = = = 
 Angelou chose " Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water ' fore I Diiie " as the volume 's title because of her interest in unconscious innocence , which she says is " even lovelier than trying to remain innocent . " The title is a reference to her belief that " we as individuals ... are still so innocent that we think if we asked our murderer just before he puts the final wrench upon the throat , ' Would you please give me a cool drink of water ? ' and he would do so ' " . Angelou has said that if she " didn 't believe that , [ she ] wouldn 't get up in the morning " . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Angelou uses rhyme and repetition throughout all her works , yet rhyme is only found in seven of the poems in Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water ' fore I Diiie ; critic Lyman B. Hagen calls her use of rhythm " rather ordinary and unimaginative " . Death is an important theme throughout many of Angelou 's works , especially in Caged Bird , which opens with it and , according to scholar Liliane K. Arensberg , is resolved at the book 's end , when her son is born . Death is directly mentioned in 19 of the 38 poems in Diiie . According to scholar Yasmin Y. DeGout , many of the poems in Diiie , along with those in Angelou 's second volume Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit Me Well , " lack the overt empowerment themes of her later , better known works " , especially And Still I Rise ( 1978 ) and I Shall Not Be Moved ( 1990 ) . 
 = = = Part One : Where Love is a Scream of Anguish = = = 
 The themes in the first section of Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water ' fore I Diiie focus on love . In Southern Women Writers , Carol Neubauer states that the first twenty poems in the volume " describe the whole gamut of love , from the first moment of passionate discovery to the first suspicion of painful loss " . Kirkus Review finds more truth in the poems in this section , which describe love from the perspective of a Black woman , compared to those in the second section . Hagen feels that Angelou 's best love poem in Diiie is " The Mothering Blackness " , which uses repetition and biblical allusions to state that the Black mother loves and forgives her children unconditionally . 
 In " To a Husband " , Angelou praises the Black slaves who helped in the development and growth of America . She idealizes Black men , especially in " A Zorro Man " and " To a Man " ; she dedicates Diiie to the subjects of both poems . DeGout views " A Zorro Man " as an example of Angelou 's ability to translate her personal experience into political discourse and the " textured liberation " she places in all her poetry . The use of concrete imagery and abstract symbolism to describe emotional and sexual experience , but also has another meaning , that of liberation from painful and poignant memories . According to DeGout , " A Zorro Man " lacks the clear themes of liberation that Angelou 's later poems such as " Phenomenal Woman " have , but its subtle use of themes and techniques infer the liberation theme and compliment her poems that are more overtly liberating . The poem and others in Diiie , with its focus on women 's sexual and romantic experiences , challenges the gender codes of poetry written in previous eras . She also challenges the male @-@ centered and militaristic themes and messages found in the poetry of the Black Arts movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s . Angelou 's use of sexual imagery , from a woman 's point of view , provides new interpretations " and excavates it from derogatory assessments " . Although the poem 's speaker feels trapped , women 's sexuality is depicted as powerful and controls her partner , which moves away from " the patriarchal assumption of male control over the sexual act " . Angelou 's depiction allows her readers , mostly women , to identify , celebrate , and <unk> their sexuality to all races . DeGout states that " A Zorro Man " " enact [ s ] empowerment by liberating the reader from stigmas placed on women 's sexuality from gender assumptions of male ( sexual ) power , and from racialized notions of women 's experience " . 
 Librarian John Alfred Avant states that many of Angelou 's poems could be set to music like that of jazz singer and musician Nina Simone , especially the first poem in this section , " They Went Home , " which he says " fits into the torchy unrequited love bag " . Hagen considers Angelou 's best poems to be the ones meant to be song lyrics , such as " They Went Home " . In his analysis of " They Went Home " , Hagen calls Angelou a realist because she recognizes that the married man who dates other women usually returns to his wife . He states , " While the sentiment is psychologically sound , the lines are prosaic , reflecting the pitiful state of the abandoned " . Essick , when analyzing " When I Think About Myself " , states that the poem central theme is " one 's self @-@ exultation and self @-@ pride that prevent one from losing her will in spite of experiences involving pain and degradation " . 
 According to Hagen , in his analysis of " No Loser , No <unk> " , the speaker expresses the common experience of loss , beginning with childish and minor ones such as losing a dime , a doll , and a watch , and ending with the loss of the speaker 's boyfriend . Kirkus Review considers this poem , along with " They Went Home " , both slight and carrying " the weight of experience " . 
 = = = Part Two : Just Before the World Ends = = = 
 The poems in the second section of Diiie are more militant in tone ; according to critic Lyman B. Hagen , the poems in this section have " more bite " and express the experience of being Black in a white @-@ dominated world . He states that Angelou acts as a spokesperson , especially in " To a Freedom Fighter " , when she acknowledges a debt owed to those involved in the civil rights movement . According to Bloom , the themes in Angelou 's poetry , which tend to be made up of short lyrics with strong , jazz @-@ like rhythms , are common in the lives of many American Blacks . Angelou 's poems commend the survivors who have prevailed despite racism and a great deal of difficulty and challenges . Neubauer states that Angelou focuses on the lives of American Black people from the time of slavery to the 1960s , and that her themes " deal broadly with the painful anguish suffered by blacks forced into submission , with guilt over accepting too much , and with protest and basic survival " . 
 Critic William Sylvester states that the metaphors in Angelou 's poetry serve as " coding " , or litotes , for meanings understood by other Blacks . In her poem " Sepia Fashion Show " , for example , the last lines ( " I 'd remind them please , look at those knees / you got a Miss Ann 's scrubbing " ) is a reference to slavery , when Black women had to show their knees to prove how hard they had cleaned . Sylvester states that this is true in much of Angelou 's poetry , and that it elicits a change in the reader 's emotions ; in this poem , from humor to anger . Sylvester says that Angelou uses the same technique in " Letter to an Aspiring Junkie " , in which understatement contained in the repeated phrase " nothing happens " is a litotes for the prevalence of violence in society . Hagen connects this poem with the final scene in her second autobiography , Gather Together in My Name , which describes her encounter with her friend , a drug addict who shows her the effects of his drug habit . According to Hagen , the poem is full of disturbing images , such as drugs being a slave master and the junkie being tied to his habit like a monkey attached to the street vendor 's strap . 
 Hagen calls Angelou 's coding " signifying " and states , " A knowledge of black linguistic regionalisms and folklore enhances the appreciation of Angelou 's poems " . Line six in " Harlem Hopscotch , " for example ( " If you 're white , all right / If you 're brown , hang around / If you 're black stand back " ) , is a popular jingle used by African Americans that people of other cultures might not recognize . Hagen believes that despite the signifying that occurs in many of Angelou 's poems , the themes and topics are universal enough that all readers would understand and appreciate them . 
 In " When I Think About Myself " , Angelou presents the perspective of an aging maid to make an ironic statement about Blacks surviving in a world dominated by whites , and in " Times @-@ Square @-@ Shoeshine @-@ Competition " , a Black shoeshine boy defends his prices to a white customer , his words punctuated by the " pow pow " of his shoeshine rag . Her poems , such as " Letter to an Aspiring Junkie " , in this and other volumes deal with universal social problems from a Black perspective . African @-@ American literature professor Priscilla R. Ramsey , when analyzing the poem " When I Think About Myself , " states that the first @-@ person singular pronoun " I " , which Angelou uses often , is a symbol that refers to all her people . Ramsey calls this " a self @-@ defining function " , in which Angelou ironically views the world as an outsider , resulting in the loss of her direct and literal relationship to the world and providing her with the ability to " laugh at its characteristics no matter how politically and socially devastating " . Scholar Kathy M. Essick discusses the same poem , calling it and most of the poems in Diiie , Angelou 's " protest poems " . 
 According to critic Harold Bloom , in his analysis of " Times @-@ Square " , the first line of the fourth stanza ( " I ain 't playing dozens mister " ) is an allusion to the Dozens , a game in which the participants insult each other . The game is mentioned in later poems , " The Thirteens ( Black ) " and " The Thirteens ( White ) . " According to critic Geneva <unk> , Angelou uses the Thirteens , a twist on the Dozens , to compare the insults of blacks and whites , which allows her to compare the actions of the two races . Bloom compares " Times @-@ Square " to Langston Hughes ' blues / protest poetry . He suggests that the best way to analyze the subjects , style , themes , and use of vernacular in this and most of Angelou 's poems is to use " a blues @-@ based model " , since like the blues singer , Angelou uses laughter or ridicule instead of tears to cope with minor irritations , sadness , and great suffering . Hagen compares the themes in " The Thirteens ( Black and White ) " with Angelou 's poems " Communication I " and " Communication II " , which appear in Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit Me Well , her second volume of poetry . 
 Neubauer analyzes two poems in Diiie , " Times @-@ Squares " and " Harlem Hopscotch " , that support her assertion that for Angelou , " conditions must improve for the black race " She states , " Both [ poems ] ring with a lively , invincible beat that carries defeated figures into at least momentary triumph " . In " Times @-@ Squares " , the shoeshiner claims to be the best at his trade and retains his pride despite his humiliating circumstances . " Harlem Hopscotch " celebrates survival and the strength , resilience , and energy necessary to accomplish it . Its rhythm echoes the beat of the player , and compares life to a brutal match . By the end of the poem , however , the speaker wins , both the game and in life . Neubauer states , " These poems are the poet 's own defense against the incredible odds in the game of life " . 
 Essick also analyzes " Times @-@ Square " , stating that the language and rhythm used by the poem 's subject , especially the repetitive onomatopoeia ( " pow pow " ) that punctuates the end of each line , parallels the sound of his work . The shoeshiner relies on the rhythm and repetition of his song to maintain his pace and to relieve his boredom . It also provides a way to help him brag about his abilities and talents . The shoeshiner takes on the role of the trickster , a common character in Black folklore , and demonstrates his control of vernacular language , especially when he refers to the Dozens . 
 = = Critical response = = 
 Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water ' fore I Diiie was a best @-@ seller and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize . The poems in the volume have received mixed reviews . Critic John Alfred Avant recognized that the volume would be popular due to the success of Caged Bird , but he characterized it as " rather well done schlock poetry , not to be confused with poetry for people who read poetry " and stated , " This collection isn 't accomplished , not by any means ; but some readers are going to love it . " Martha Liddy , who reviewed the collection in the same issue of the Library Journal in 1971 , classified it , like Caged Bird , in the young adult category and called Diiie a " volume of marvelously lyrical , rhythmical poems " . Kirkus Review also found the poems in the volume unsophisticated yet sensitive to the spoken aspects of poetry , such as rhythm and diction , and considered her prose more poetic and unrestrained than her poetry . 
 A reviewer from Choice called the poems in Diiie " <unk> and powerful though not great poetry " , and recommended it for libraries with a collection of African @-@ American literature . Critic William Sylvester , who says that Angelou " has an uncanny ability to capture the sound of a voice on a page " , places her poems , especially the ones in this volume , in the " background of black rhythms " . Chad Walsh , reviewing Diiie in Book World , calls Angelou 's poems " a moving blend of lyricism and harsh social observation " .

 Of the 38 poems in Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water ' fore I Diiie , twenty are in the first part , " Where Love is a Scream of Anguish , " and the remaining eighteen are in the second part , " Just Before the World Ends . " The volume is dedicated " to Amber Sam and the Zorro Man , " a reference to the poems " A Zorro Man " and " To a Man , " both of which are in the first part of the book . According to Liddy , " Part One contains poetry of love , and therefore of anguish , sharing , fear , affection and loneliness . Part Two features poetry of racial confrontation — of protest , anger , and irony " . Most of the poems are short in length and are freeform .

 Dolphin <unk> Overton III ( 2 April 1926 – 25 March 2013 ) was a United States Air Force aviator who became a flying ace during the Korean War . Overton 's controversial tour in Korea led to his being removed from combat and denied his medals and victory credits , but he was subsequently reinstated with these . 
 Born in Andrews , South Carolina , Overton took an early interest in flying , and attended The Citadel for a year before enlisting in the United States Navy briefly during World War II . Afterward , Overton graduated from West Point and began a career flying the F @-@ 84 Thunderjet . In 1952 , Overton volunteered to fly in the Korean War and flew 102 missions in an F @-@ 84 before transferring to the 16th Fighter @-@ Interceptor Squadron and flying the F @-@ 86 Sabre . During a four @-@ day time period in early 1953 , Overton claimed five MiG @-@ 15 victories in MiG alley , certifying him as a flying ace . However , he was subsequently returned to the United States in shame after commanders charged him with insubordination for crossing the Yalu River into Manchuria for his victories . 
 Subsequent research and debate has pointed to Overton as a scapegoat for an informal policy of US pilots regularly violating the Yalu River border into China , and that the US military discredited Overton as a way to prevent an international incident . Overton was finally given the medals he had earned in the war — including a Distinguished Service Cross and four Silver Star Medals — in 2009 .

 Dolphin D. Overton was born on 2 April 1926 in Andrews , South Carolina . He was interested in flying from an early age , and as a boy he flew with his father . He became an avid reader of stories from World War I flying aces . At age 16 , Overton was flying solo in a Piper J @-@ 3 Cub . 
 Overton graduated from high school and began college at The Citadel in Charleston , South Carolina in 1943 , at the age of 16 , but one year later he dropped out in an attempt to enlist in the United States Navy . Overton attempted to become a naval aviator in 1945 but there was little demand for additional aviators at the time , as the war was nearing its end . 
 After being discharged from the Navy , Overton earned an appointment to the United States Military Academy , graduating in 1949 and being commissioned as a second lieutenant . Overton became one of 92 graduates to join the newly formed United States Air Force . In 1950 , Overton earned his aviator wings after a year of training at Williams Air Force Base in Phoenix , Arizona , alongside Ivan Kincheloe , who would later also become a flying ace in Korea .

On his third flight in the F @-@ 84 , as he tried to set a record for completing an obstacle course in the shortest time , he was involved in a major crash . The crash threatened to end his career , but Schilling , determined to prevent Overton from being discharged , gave him extra assignments to keep him in the military .

 In February 1952 , Overton joined the 8th Fighter @-@ Bomber Squadron , 49th Fighter @-@ Bomber Wing . As many of the other pilots deploying with Overton were from the Air National Guard , Overton was the most experienced jet aircraft pilot among them . Because of this , he was made a flight leader and the assistant Operations Officer of the squadron . The unit flew out of Taegu ( K @-@ 2 ) and its missions consisted primarily of close air support and interdiction missions in support of United Nations ground forces . In this time , Overton also took assignments as a forward air controller and directed air support missions to troops on the front lines . Overton spent some of this time on the USS Valley Forge ( CV @-@ 45 ) to assist US Navy pilots with their own close air support doctrine . 
 On 15 June 1952 , Overton led a bombing raid over Pyongyang to destroy a series of targets near the Pyongyang Air Base . The targets had been unsuccessfully bombed earlier by a similar strike force , but Overton 's group was successful in destroying almost all of the targets while none of his aircraft took major damage from the 48 antiaircraft and 100 automatic weapons , and without harming the many nearby UN prisoner of war concentrations . 
 On 28 June 1952 , the squadron was ordered to attack a convoy of Chinese vehicles . Overton , leading a group of 24 F @-@ 84s , directed attacks on the convoy despite taking intense anti @-@ aircraft fire himself , and the aircraft destroyed 150 vehicles . Though the circumstances in the event were lost in subsequent actions , Overton would later be decorated for this achievement . 
 On 4 July , Overton was on a mission near <unk> , leading a group of 37 F @-@ 84s on an attack mission against the North Korean Military Academy when they were attacked by almost 200 MiG @-@ 15s in the largest engagement of the war . In spite of the intense fire , Overton 's group took no losses , and the results of the engagement , as well as Overton 's heroism were cause for subsequent decoration . With this unit , Overton flew 102 combat missions over the course of a 6 @-@ month tour . It concluded in August 1952 .

He flew an F @-@ 86 Sabre , tail number 50 @-@ 631 , nicknamed Dolph 's Devil and Angel in Disguise . 
 During this time , Overton was known to sit in his bases ' chapel in silence for extended periods of time , not praying , to calm his nerves . He also began to grow a mustache , though he professes not to be superstitious . Overton would continue to grow this mustache until immediately before his final flight , when he shaved it off . He also believed any number with a three in it , including the number 13 , was lucky . 
 Overton was described by fellow pilots as being a " smart and serious professional . " He visited a radar site in his spare time to memorize the flight patterns of the Soviet and Chinese fliers . By the end of January 1953 , Overton had learned the MiG patrol and landing patterns . He had made contact with MiGs several times but had not been successful at shooting any down . This changed on 21 January when Overton began successfully downing aircraft north of the Yalu River . Over the course of four days and four missions , he downed five Soviet aircraft ; two on 21 January and one each on 22 and 23 January . Overton himself expressed surprise at how successful his strategy was , noting he was never discovered until it was too late , and he considered the victories relatively easy . He downed his fifth and final Soviet pilot on 24 January 1953 , his 49th mission of the tour . This meant he attained ace status in the shortest time of any pilot in the war . He became an ace on the same day as Harold E. Fischer , and the two were the 24th and 25th US aces in the war . Overton 's streak was briefly billed as the " hottest streak in jet fighting history , " and for a few days he was characterized as a hero by Stars and Stripes . 
 During a mission which occurred on a disputed date , either 23 January or 25 January , Overton and his squadron commander , ace Edwin L. Heller flew north of the Yalu River in search of MiG formations . Heller and Overton both shot down aircraft , some sources say this was one of Overton 's first five victories , while others say they were his sixth and seventh , for which he never received credit , but Heller was struck by a MiG and crashed . He was either 60 or 150 miles north of the Yalu River line , so a rescue attempt was not made . This was later seen as one of the reasons Overton was singled out for reprimand for crossing the Yalu River . Most sources attribute Overton with only five victories . 
 = = = <unk> and resignation = = = 
 The next morning , 25 January , Overton was summoned to the office of his wing commander , Colonel John W. Mitchell . There , Colonel David C. Jones of the Fifth Air Force command staff determined he had crossed the Yalu river into China for each of his five victories . Violating Chinese airspace was officially prohibited . The next day Mitchell told him he was being grounded and sent home , and " made clear that he was not going home a hero . " The 16th Fighter @-@ Interceptor Squadron was grounded for 10 days . 
 Overton was told he would not be given the decorations he had earned in Korea , including the awards from his previous tour which had not yet been written up . Overton had twice been pinned with a Distinguished Flying Cross personally by Fifth Air Force commander Lieutenant General Glenn O. Barcus , and he had been considered for several Silver Star Medals . Overton was also given a bad efficiency report which characterized him as insubordinate . Overton lost his temporary rank of captain . The military delayed official recognition of his credits and ace status until December 1953 . He became one of 40 US aces during the war . Overton resigned his commission before the war ended . 
 Subsequent analysis has indicated Overton may have been treated unfairly for these actions , becoming a scapegoat for the actions of many other pilots in the war . No new policies had been released warning about crossing the Chinese border , and no pilots before Overton had been punished for doing so . Overton himself expressed frustration at the move , as he had been the rearmost pilot in the formation that crossed the Yalu River on 24 January , and Mitchell himself had been known to cross the border and condoned the action . Fellow ace and unit member Francis Gabreski challenged the move , claiming that US pilots were outnumbered and it was the only way to maintain air superiority . It was later revealed that Swiss observers to the peace talks at <unk> were traveling through Manchuria on foot when they spotted a UN @-@ Soviet dogfight and lodged a complaint , prompting an investigation which eventually indicted Overton . 
 The move was seen as an effort by the US military to prevent an international incident by not acknowledging that US pilots had violated Chinese airspace . Debate remains as to whether or not these airspace violations were a necessity , as US pilots were able to maintain air superiority despite being outnumbered in the war , and Chinese and Soviet pilots , who could have launched similar strikes on UN ships at sea and on targets in Japan did not do so . Still , many missions into Chinese airspace were authorized during the war . Informally , it was known that US pilots regularly violated the rule in a rush to down MiGs . 
 = = = Subsequent life = = = 
 Following his resignation , Overton had no contact with the military . This continued for several decades until Overton reconnected with fellow West Point graduate Lieutenant General Charles G. Cleveland , and he discovered the Air Force had established Air Force Review Boards Agency to review incidents and determine if individuals had been unfairly denied medals . In the meantime , Overton became a successful businessman , owning and operating several companies . 
 Overton continued flying as a hobby after the military . He built a personal aviation library with 10 @,@ 000 books , and began collecting and restoring aircraft . By 1999 , Overton had acquired and restored over 90 aircraft , donating most to museums and institutions around the United States and abroad . Among this collection are several more Piper Cubs and Ford Trimotor aircraft , which he flew regularly for leisure . He was also active in the development of a state aviation museum for North Carolina . The Carolinas Aviation Museum , established in 1992 , named its library for Overton . 
 Overton was exonerated 25 years later when he was deemed eligible to receive two Distinguished Flying Crosses and four Silver Star Medals . However , records relating to Overton 's actions were destroyed in the 1973 National Archives Fire and the awarding of his decorations was delayed . Some sources later whitewashed the controversy by claiming Overton was on his final four missions in Korea when he became an ace , and that he was scheduled to be returned to the United States after the missions anyway . The US Air Force maintained that Overton had been denied his medals due to " clerical omissions . " The Air Force , in its citations for Overton 's medals , claimed the actions took place at <unk> and <unk> , instead of acknowledging Overton had claimed the victories in Chinese airspace . 
 Overton was honored by the Gathering of Eagles program of the Air Force Air Command and Staff College twice , once in 1999 and again in 2008 . On 18 September 2009 , Overton was further presented with the Distinguished Service Cross by Air Force Chief of Staff General Norton Schwartz , who in a speech noted that Overton had been " not properly recognized " for the 28 June 1952 bombing run . Overton would also finally be presented with his Distinguished Flying Cross and Silver Star Medals , 57 years after the actions . It followed a six @-@ month appeal process initiated by Overton . 
 Overton resided in North Carolina with his wife , Sue . The couple had five children and 10 grandchildren . He died on 25 March 2013 . 
 = = Aerial victory credits = = 
 From numerous visits to radar stations before his flights , Overton memorized where and how the Soviet pilots landed as well as how long they stayed airborne . He then told radar men at Cho @-@ do Airport to inform him when Soviet pilots took off , allowing him to ambush them . Using this information , Overton would fly in a racetrack pattern between the MiGs landing zones and the sun , preventing them from spotting him as they made their landing approaches . Overton would then fall in behind the formations of Soviet fighters as they began their landings , shooting them down with minimal resistance . All of his subsequent victories were described as " parallel intercepts , non @-@ deflection shots from close range without using the radar ranging feature on the Sabre 's gunsight . " 
 Most sources agree Overton had five victories . However , there is a dispute as to whether this number is higher , thanks to the disputed account of one mission . A few sources claim Overton flew one final mission on 25 January 1953 and shot down two more MiG @-@ 15s which he never received credit for . Other sources attest that this mission — the same in which Edwin Heller was shot down — took place 23 January and Overton shot down only one aircraft during the flight .

 Overton was decorated numerous times during his Korean War tour , however many of these awards and medals were rescinded following his controversial removal from the country . Additionally , his records were among the 16 to 18 million which were destroyed in the 1973 National Archives fire . Most of Overton 's decorations were restored following his 2009 appeal . What follows is an incomplete list of awards confirmed to have been awarded to Overton during his service .

 The President of the United States of America , authorized by Act of Congress July 9 , 1918 , takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to ( then ) First Lieutenant Dolphin D. Overton , III , United States Air Force , for extraordinary heroism in action against an armed enemy of the United States as Group Leader of twenty @-@ two F @-@ 84 type Aircraft , 49th Bomber Wing , FIFTH Air Force , on 28 June 1952 . On that date , Lieutenant Overton 's group was diverted against a target of truck convoys discovered by a previous recce flight . Working in and through an overcast , Lieutenant Overton planned and executed a very difficult attack , sequencing his aircraft in such a manner as to provide maximum coverage of the target with minimum risk from heavy ground fire . With disregard for his own safety , Lieutenant Overton remained in enemy fire under the overcast so that he could visually direct the attacks and withdrawals . So successful was Lieutenant Overton 's direction of the attack , that one hundred fifty trucks were destroyed and confirmed by photograph , making it one of the largest such strikes of the war . Lieutenant Overton 's command of this strike in such adverse conditions and with such devastating results highlights his superb flying skill and extraordinary heroism in the face of fierce enemy opposition . Lieutenant Overton 's actions reflect great credit upon himself , the FAR EAST Air Force , the United States Air Force , and the United Nations Command . 
 = DuSable Museum of African American History = 
 The DuSable Museum of African American History is dedicated to the study and conservation of African American history , culture , and art . It was founded in 1961 by Dr. Margaret Taylor @-@ Burroughs ( sometimes Margaret Burroughs or Margaret Goss Burroughs ) , her husband Charles Burroughs , Gerard Lew , Eugene Feldman , and others . Dr. Taylor @-@ Burroughs and other founders established the museum to celebrate black culture , then overlooked by most museums and academic establishments . It is located at 740 E. 56th Place at the corner of Cottage Grove Avenue on the South Side of Chicago in Washington Park . The museum is in an affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Founding = = = 
 The DuSable Museum was originally chartered on February 16 , 1961 . Its origins as the Ebony Museum of Negro History and Art began following the work of Margaret and Charles Burroughs to correct the perceived omission of black history and culture in the education establishment . The museum was originally located on the ground floor of the Burroughs ' home at 3806 S. Michigan Avenue . In 1968 , the museum was renamed for Jean Baptiste Point du Sable , a Haitian fur trader and the first non @-@ Native @-@ American permanent settler in Chicago . During the 1960s , the museum and the South Side Community Art Center , which was located across the street , founded in 1941 by Taylor @-@ Burroughs and dedicated by Eleanor Roosevelt , formed an African American cultural corridor . This original museum site had previously been a social club and boarding house for African American railroad workers and is now listed as a Chicago Landmark and on the National Register of Historic Places . 
 The DuSable Museum quickly filled a void caused by limited cultural resources then available to African Americans in Chicago . It became an educational resource for African American history and culture and a focal point in Chicago for black social activism . The museum has hosted political fundraisers , community festivals , and various events serving the black community . The museum 's model has been emulated in numerous other cities around the country , including Boston , Los Angeles , and Philadelphia . 
 = = = Expansion = = = 
 In 1973 , the Chicago Park District donated the usage of a park administration building in Washington Park as the site for the museum . The current location once served as a lockup facility for the Chicago Police Department . In 1993 , the museum expanded with the addition of a new wing named in honor of the late Mayor Harold Washington , the first African @-@ American mayor of Chicago . In 2004 , the original building became a contributing building to the Washington Park United States Registered Historic District which is a National Register of Historic Places listing . 
 The DuSable Museum is the oldest and largest caretaker of African American culture in the United States . Over its long history , it has expanded as necessary to reflect the increased interest in black culture . This willingness to adapt has allowed it to survive while other museums faltered due to a weakening economy and decreased public support . The museum was the eighth one located on Park District land . Although it focuses on exhibiting African American culture , it is one of several Chicago museums that celebrates Chicago 's ethnic and cultural heritage . 
 Antoinette Wright , director of the DuSable Museum , has said that African American art has grown out of a need for the culture to preserve its history orally and in art due to historical obstacles to other forms of documentation . She also believes that the museum serves as a motivational tool for members of a culture that has experienced extensive negativity . In the 1980s , African American museums such as the DuSable endured the controversy of whether negative aspects of the cultural history should be memorialized . In the 1990s , the African American genre of museum began to flourish despite financial difficulties . In 2016 , the museum formed an affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution . 
 = = Collection = = 
 The new wing contains a permanent exhibit on Washington with memorabilia , personal effects and surveys highlights of his political career . The museum also serves as the city 's primary memorial to du Sable . Highlights of its collection include the desk of activist Ida B. Wells and the violin of poet Paul Laurence Dunbar . 
 The museum has a collection of 13 @,@ 000 artifacts , books , photographs , art objects , and memorabilia . The DuSable collection has come largely from private gifts . It has United States slavery @-@ era relics , nineteenth- and twentieth @-@ century artifacts , and archival materials , including the diaries of sea explorer Captain Harry Dean . The DuSable collection includes works from scholar W. E. B. Du Bois , sociologist St. Clair Drake , and poet Langston Hughes . The African American art collection contains selections from the South Side Community Art Center students Charles White , Archibald Motley , Jr . , Gus Nall , Charles Sebree , and Marion Perkins , as well as numerous New Deal Works Progress Administration period and 1960s Black Arts Movement works . The museum also owns prints and drawings by Henry O. Tanner , Richmond <unk> , and <unk> Bearden , and has an extensive collection of books and records pertaining to African and African American history and culture .

 The original north entrance contains the main lobby of the museum and features the Thomas Miller mosaics , which honor the institution 's founders . The building was designed <unk> by D.H.

The museum has a 466 @-@ seat auditorium , which is part of the new wing , that hosts community @-@ related events , such as a jazz and blues music series , poetry readings , film screenings , and other cultural events . The museum also has a gift shop and a research library . As of 2001 , the museum operated with a US $ 2 @.@ 7 million budget , compared to a $ <unk> budget for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum . The museum 's funding is partially dependent upon a Chicago Park District tax levy . 
 After the 1993 expansion of the new wing , the museum contained 50 @,@ 000 square feet ( 4 @,@ 600 m2 ) of exhibition space . The $ 4 million expansion was funded by a $ 2 million matching funds grant from city and state officials . 
 = Uyarndha Manithan = 
 Uyarndha Manithan ( English : The Noble Man ) is a 1968 Indian Tamil @-@ language drama film written by Javar Seetharaman and directed by Krishnan @-@ Panju . The film was produced by A. V. Meiyappan under AVM Productions and stars Sivaji Ganesan and Sowcar Janaki in the lead roles , while S. A. Ashokan , Major Sundarrajan , <unk> and Sivakumar play pivotal roles . The film 's soundtrack and background score were composed by M. S. Viswanathan , while the lyrics for the songs were written by Vaali . 
 In addition to being Sivaji Ganesan 's 125th film , Uyarndha Manithan was conceived as an adaption of <unk> 's 1966 Bengali film Uttar Purush . The plot revolves around a wealthy industrialist 's son who secretly marries the daughter of his family estate 's accountant , only for his father to discover it and burn down the estate along with his son 's pregnant wife , who is inside . The remainder of the film reveals the truth behind how she and her progeny survives . 
 Released on 29 November 1968 , Uyarndha Manithan earned positive critical feedback and went on to become a commercial success . The songs " Andha Naal Gnaabagam " and " Paal Polave " remain popular today in Tamil Nadu . The film won the National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer at the 16th National Film Awards , for P. Susheela , making it the first Tamil film to win a National Award under that category . It also won four Tamil Nadu State Film Awards , including Best Film ( First prize ) and Best Director for Krishnan @-@ Panju . 
 = = Plot = = 
 <unk> ( alias Raju ) ( Sivaji Ganesan ) is the son of a wealthy Madurai @-@ based industrialist , Sankaralingam ( S. V. Ramadoss ) . Living with Raju is his driver and friend , Sundaram ( Major Sundarrajan ) . While vacationing in his family estate at Kodaikanal with Sundaram and his family doctor , Gopal ( S. A. <unk> ) , Raju meets Parvathi ( <unk> ) and falls in love with her . Gopal too becomes smitten with Parvathi when he meets her whilst conducting her father 's medical treatment . Parvathi , who knows Raju through her father , as he is also an accountant of Raju 's family estate , reciprocates Raju 's feelings . Gopal decides not to reveal his love for Parvathi to Raju for Raju 's sake . Raju and Parvathi marry in secret with the help of Gopal and the consent of Parvathi 's father . The couple live together in Kodaikanal without disclosing the knowledge of their marriage to Raju 's father , Sankaralingam . 
 Three months later , Parvathi becomes pregnant . Sankaralingam , fearing for his son 's safety , arrives at Kodaikanal and becomes furious upon finding out Raju 's marriage to Parvathi . He orders his henchmen to set the estate on fire with Parvathi and her father inside . Raju and Gopal rush to save Parvathi , but they are stopped by Sankaralingam 's henchmen and are forcefully taken back to Madurai , leaving Parvathi and her father for dead . A few months after returning to Madurai , Raju is forced to marry his cousin Vimala ( Sowcar Janaki ) . After the marriage , Sankaralingam hands over his business affairs to Raju and dies . Nineteen years pass . Despite having mutual affection for each other , Raju and Vimala remain childless and Raju is unable to forget Parvathi . 
 Sathyamurthy ( Sivakumar ) , a nineteen @-@ year @-@ old who lives with his uncle Murugan ( V. S. Raghavan ) , is unable to retain any job due to his honest nature . He becomes acquainted with Gopal , with whose recommendation he becomes Raju 's personal house servant . When Sathyamurthy displays his mother 's photograph at his house to pray to her , it is revealed that Sathyamurthy is the son of Raju and Parvathi . Parvathi had survived the accident , was cared for by Murugan , and died a few years after giving birth to Sathyamurthy without divulging the identity of Raju to Sathyamurthy and Murugan . Sathyamurthy improves his reading and writing skills with the help of Sundaram 's daughter , Gowri ( Bharathi Vishnuvardhan ) and the two fall in love . When Raju learns of their love , he approves of their marriage . Gopal comes to know that Sathyamurthy is Raju 's son , but dies of a sudden heart attack before revealing it .

 Sivaji Ganesan wanted A. V. Meiyappan to produce his 125th film , which eventually became Uyarndha Manithan . Meiyappan then asked the director duo Krishnan @-@ Panju to search for a good script . One of Meiyappan 's friends , V. A. P. Iyer , suggested Meiyappan to remake the Bengali film Uttar Purush ( 1966 ) . After watching the film , Meiyappan was impressed with it and made a decision with Krishnan @-@ Panju and Javar Seetharaman to remake the film with a few alterations . 
 When the script was ready , Meiyappan 's sons and the film 's co @-@ producers M. Saravanan , M. Kumaran and M. Murugan narrated it to Ganesan at his residence , Annai <unk> . Ganesan initially rejected it as he felt the character of Dr. Gopal had more impact than the main character , Raju , and sought to film the portions involving Dr. Gopal in four days . However , on Meiyappan 's insistence , Ganesan played the role of Raju . The role of Dr. Gopal went to S. A. Ashokan and Ganesan assisted him for acting in the scene where Dr. Gopal dies of a heart attack . S. V. Ramadoss was cast as Raju 's father Sankaralingam , Major Sundarrajan as Raju 's classmate , <unk> as Raju 's wife Parvathi , Sowcar Janaki as Raju 's cousin Vimala , Sivakumar as Raju 's son Sathyamurthy and V. S. Raghavan portrayed Sathyamurthy 's uncle Murugan . 
 When M. Saravanan asked about Ganesan 's salary to Ganesan 's younger brother V. C. Shanmugham , who spoke on Ganesan 's behalf , Shanmugham said that Ganesan was willing to accept any amount that AVM Productions could afford to offer . Taking this to be a vague statement as <unk> did not state Ganesan 's salary properly , Saravanan discovered that Ganesan accepted ₹ 200 @,@ 000 ( US $ 26 @,@ 667 in 1968 ) for one of A. P. Nagarajan 's latest films . Since Thiruvilaiyadal ( 1965 ) , Nagarajan 's films were made in Eastmancolor , and because Uyarndha Manidhan was made in black @-@ and @-@ white and costume designing for the film was less as compared to those of Nagarajan 's films , M. Saravanan decided to pay ₹ 150 @,@ 000 ( US $ 20 @.@ 000 in 1968 ) to Ganesan . P. N. Sundaram served as the cinematographer , while Panju edited the film under the pseudonym " Panjabi " . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Ganesan 's mannerisms and acting style in the film were inspired by one of his friends who was a Coimbatore @-@ based industrialist . During the scene near the end of the film in which Ganesan enters a burning house , which he did without any hesitation , he accidentally singed his body hair . The song " En <unk> <unk> " was re @-@ shot as Meiyappan was not pleased with the earlier sequence that was shown to him by the production unit . The song " Paal Polave " was initially meant to be shot at Kodaikanal , but due to unfavourable weather conditions the production crew decided not to include the song in the final version . The film 's art director , A. K. Sekhar , wanted to include the song in the film after hearing its rendition by P. Susheela and constructed a specially erected set at AVM studios in Chennai that resembled Kodaikanal . The song was filmed there in three days . 
 It was speculated that a film producer bought the remake rights of The Parent Trap ( 1961 ) in Hindi and titled it as <unk> . AVM Productions had already acquired the rights to the film , which they were making under the title Do Kaliyaan ( 1968 ) . To avoid a clash with that film , AVM Production stalled the production of Uyarndha Manithan for eight months and managed to release Do Kaliyaan first . Ganesan , who thought that the project had been shelved , went to inform AVM Productions that he would commence filming with another technical crew . However , AVM Productions convinced him that the shooting was only delayed , and paid him ₹ 50 @,@ 000 ( US $ 6 @,@ 667 in 1968 ) in advance . After the release of Do Kaliyaan , filming was resumed and completed . The final length of the film 's prints were 4 @,@ 591 metres ( 15 @,@ 062 ft ) long .

 In his 2015 book Madras Studios : Narrative , Genre , and Ideology in Tamil Cinema , Swarnavel Eswaran Pillai notes that the title Uyarndha Manithan , meaning " A Honourable Man " , epitomises the contradiction within the character of Raju , and in the trajectory of the rebel in Parasakthi ( 1952 ) , as he finally ends up a " meek / reactionary family man " who had forsaken his own offspring / lineage at a critical juncture . 
 = = Music = = 
 The soundtrack and musical score for Uyarndha Manithan were composed by M. S. Viswanathan , while the lyrics were written by Vaali . The soundtrack was released under the label of Saregama . In the composition and picturisation for the song " Andha Naal Gnaabagam " , Viswanathan was inspired by one of the songs in My Fair Lady ( 1964 ) , in which Rex Harrison sings with a walking stick in hand on a golf course . Due to T. M. Soundararajan 's laughter being inadequate during the recording of this song , Viswanathan himself recorded his own laughter . M. Saravanan , in his book AVM 60 Cinema , described the use of dialogues in " Andha Naal Gnaabagam " as " something new to Tamil cinema " . The song was parodied by Vikram and Vivek in Dhool ( 2003 ) , and " Paal Polave " was parodied by Santhanam in Yuvan <unk> ( 2011 ) . 
 The soundtrack was received positively by critics , with " Andha Naal Gnaabagam " and " Paal Polave " remaining popular today in Tamil Nadu . In his book Pride of Tamil Cinema : 1931 to 2013 , G. Dhananjayan wrote that <unk> Manithan " had memorable songs from the combination of MS Vishwanathan [ sic ] and <unk> [ sic ] . The songs [ ... ] are popular even today " . Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu praised the bossa nova portions in the song " Velli <unk> " . News Today described " Andha Naal Gnaabagam " as " testament to the capabilities of two legends - TM . <unk> and Sivaji Ganesan " , adding that the " transition from Sivaji panting and TMS taking over is seamless " .

 Uyarndha Manithan was released on 29 November 1968 . It earned positive critical feedback and went on to become a commercial success , completing a theatrical run of 125 days . The 125th day commemorative celebrations were held in the presence of C. N. Annadurai , the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu . This was also the last function which Annadurai attended before his death . 
 G. Dhananjayan appreciated the performances of the cast and the quality of Javar Seetharaman 's dialogues , calling them " crispy " . On Ganesan 's performance , Ananda Vikatan , wrote in its 1968 review of the film : " Can anyone show both hate and love at the same time ? Sivaji proves that he can ! No more than words of ' natural acting ' is enough for Sivaji " . The magazine praised the film by stating that it " attracts our hearts " . 
 Baradwaj Rangan of The Hindu , when asked by an anonymous person how someone like Sivaji Ganesan can be called a great actor , replied , " Watch Uyarndha Manidhan [ sic ] and Motor Sundaram Pillai , and let ’ s continue this conversation . " Historian and columnist Randor Guy labelled Major Sundarrajan 's performance in the film , along with his role in Gnana Oli ( 1972 ) , as " memorable " .

 The National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer was introduced in 1968 . Since Susheela won the first award for her rendition of " Paal Polave " , Uyarndha Manithan became the first Tamil film to win a National Film Award under the Best Female Playback Singer category . It was also Ganesan 's first film to win a Tamil Nadu State Film Award .

 After the success of Uyarndha Manithan , AVM Productions was keen to remake it in Hindi and approached Dilip Kumar . After watching the film , Kumar was hesitant to play the lead role as he felt he would not match Ganesan 's performance in the original version . K. Balachander was signed up to be the director of the remake , which led to Kumar being initially convinced that he could be successful . 
 After a fortnight , Kumar met Balachander in Chennai and watched Uyarndha Manithan again for a second time to study his character . This time , however , Kumar hesitated to portray Ganesan 's role and requested Balachander to direct the remake of Babu ( 1971 ) . Balachander showed concern with Kumar 's change of heart and refused the offer , leading to both the remakes of Uyarndha Manithan and Babu being shelved .

 The song " Andha Naal Gnaabagam " was considered one of the most memorable songs written by Vaali that featured in a Sivaji Ganesan film . Rediff ranked it alongside " Madhavi Pon <unk> " from Iru <unk> ( 1967 ) and " <unk> <unk> <unk> " from Thevar Magan ( 1992 ) . 
 Susheela chose " Paal Polave " along with " Unnai Ondru Ketpen " and " Paartha Gnaabagam Illaiyo " as her favourite songs that she had recorded . Singer Swarnalatha , who made her debut with the song " <unk> <unk> " from <unk> <unk> ( 1987 ) , was chosen to sing the song by M. S. Viswanathan after he was impressed with her rendition of " Paal Polave " , which he had asked her to sing during the song 's audition . The song was rendered twice by the contestants of the fourth season of the Star Vijay reality show Airtel Super Singer , and once each by the contestants of the second and third season of its junior version , Airtel Super Singer Junior . 
 Ganesan 's biographer T. S. <unk> included Uyarndha Manithan in his list of Ganesan 's " all @-@ time greats " . In March 2009 , <unk> Narayanan of The New Indian Express rated Sundarrajan 's performance in the film among his other noted films in which he featured like <unk> <unk> ( 1965 ) , Major Chandrakanth ( 1966 ) and Gnana Oli . In her review of the 2011 film <unk> , Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu said that the premise of the film was " on the lines of Sivaji Ganesan 's poignant Uyarndha Manidhan [ sic ] " . Uyarndha Manithan was included with other Sivaji Ganesan @-@ starrers in the compilation DVD 8th Ulaga Adhisayam Sivaji , featuring Ganesan 's " iconic performances in the form of scenes , songs and stunts " .

It remains one of the 88 modern constellations 
 Four of Norma 's brighter stars — Gamma , Delta , Epsilon and Eta — make up a square in the field of faint stars . Gamma2 Normae is the brightest star with an apparent magnitude of 4 @.@ 0 . Mu Normae is one of the most luminous stars known , with a luminosity half- to one million times that of the Sun . Four star systems are known to harbour planets . The Milky Way passes through Norma , and the constellation contains eight open clusters visible to observers with binoculars . The constellation also hosts Abell 3627 , also called the Norma Cluster , one of the most massive galaxy clusters known .

 Norma was introduced in 1751 – 52 by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille with the French name l ’ <unk> et la <unk> , " the Square and Rule " , after he had observed and catalogued 10 @,@ 000 southern stars during a two @-@ year stay at the Cape of Good Hope . He devised 14 new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe . All but one honored instruments that symbolised the Age of Enlightenment . Lacaille portrayed the constellations of Norma , Circinus and Triangulum Australe , respectively , as a set square and ruler , a compass , and a surveyor 's level in a set of draughtsman instruments , in his 1756 map of the southern stars . The level was dangling from the apex of a triangle , leading some astronomers to conclude he was renaming l ’ <unk> et la <unk> to " le <unk> " " the level " . In any case , the constellation 's name had been shortened and Latinised by Lacaille to Norma by 1763 .

 Norma is bordered by Scorpius to the north , Lupus to the northwest , Circinus to the west , Triangulum Australe to the south and Ara to the east . Covering 165 @.@ 3 square degrees and 0 @.@ 401 % of the night sky , it ranks 74th of the 88 constellations in size . The three @-@ letter abbreviation for the constellation , as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922 , is ' Nor ' . The official constellation boundaries , as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930 , are defined by a polygon of ten segments ( illustrated in infobox ) . In the equatorial coordinate system , the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between 15h 12m <unk> and 16h 36m <unk> , while the declination coordinates are between − 42 @.@ 27 ° and − 60 @.@ 44 ° . The whole constellation is visible to observers south of latitude 29 ° N.

 Lacaille charted and designated ten stars with the Bayer designations Alpha through to Mu in 1756 , however his Alpha Normae was transferred into Scorpius and left unnamed by Francis Baily , before being named N Scorpii by Benjamin Apthorp Gould , who felt its brightness warranted recognition . Though Beta Normae was depicted on his star chart , it was inadvertently left out of Lacaille 's 1763 catalogue , was likewise transferred to Scorpio by Baily and named H Scorpii by Gould . Norma 's brightest star , Gamma2 Normae , is only of magnitude 4 @.@ 0 . Overall , there are 44 stars within the constellation 's borders brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude 6 @.@ 5 . 
 The four main stars — Gamma , Delta , Epsilon and Eta — make up a square in this region of faint stars . Gamma1 and Gamma2 Normae are an optical double , and not a true binary star system . Located 129 ± 1 light @-@ years away from Earth , Gamma2 Normae is a yellow giant of spectral type G8III around 2 to 2 @.@ 5 times as massive as the Sun . It has swollen to a diameter 10 times that of the Sun and shines with 45 times the Sun 's luminosity . It also is half of a close optical double , with a magnitude 10 companion star related by line of sight only . Gamma1 Normae is a yellow @-@ white supergiant , located much further away at around 1500 light @-@ years from Earth . Epsilon Normae is a spectroscopic binary , with two blue @-@ white main sequence stars of almost equal mass and spectral type ( B3V ) orbiting each other every 3 @.@ 26 days . There is a third star separated by 22 arcseconds , which has a magnitude of 7 @.@ 5 and is likely a smaller B @-@ type main sequence star of spectral type B9V . The system is 530 ± 20 light @-@ years distant from Earth , Eta Normae is a yellow giant of spectral type G8III with an apparent magnitude of 4 @.@ 65 . It shines with a luminosity approximately 66 times that of the Sun . 
 <unk> Normae is a multiple star system . The AB ( mag 5 @.@ 2 and 5 @.@ 76 ) pair orbit each other with a period of 26 @.@ 9 years ; they are 2 @.@ 77 and 2 @.@ 71 times as massive as the Sun respectively . The pair are 128 ± 6 light @-@ years distant from Earth . A third component is a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G8V with an apparent magnitude of 8 @.@ 02 . 
 Mu Normae is a remote blue supergiant of spectral type <unk> , one of the most luminous stars known . Uncertainties regarding its distance leave open the possibility that Mu Normae could be up to a million times as luminous and 60 times as massive as the Sun , though it is more likely to have around 500 @,@ 000 times the Sun 's luminosity and 40 times its mass . It is suspected of being an Alpha Cygni variable , with a magnitude range of 4 @.@ 87 – 4 @.@ 98 . <unk> Normae is another hot blue @-@ white star that is a variable , ranging from magnitude 5 @.@ 27 to 5 @.@ 41 over 4 @.@ 8 days . Lying near Eta Normae is R Normae , a Mira variable . Its visual magnitude range is 6 @.@ 5 – 13 @.@ 9 and its average period is 507 @.@ 5 days . Located halfway between Eta Normae and Gamma Circini is T Normae , another Mira variable . It ranges from magnitude 6 @.@ 2 to 13 @.@ 6 , with a period of 244 days . S Normae is a well @-@ known Cepheid variable with a magnitude range of 6 @.@ 12 – 6 @.@ 77 and a period of 9 @.@ <unk> days . It is located at the centre of the open cluster NGC 6087 . It is a yellow @-@ white supergiant of spectral type F8 @-@ <unk> that is 6 @.@ 3 times as massive as the Sun . A binary , it has a 2 @.@ 4 solar mass ( M ☉ ) companion that is a blue @-@ white main sequence star of spectral type <unk> 
 IM Normae is one of only ten recurrent novae known in the Milky Way . It has erupted in 1920 and 2002 , reaching magnitude 8 @.@ 5 from a baseline of 18 @.@ 3 . It was poorly monitored after the first eruption , so it is possible that it erupted in between . Norma hosts two faint R Coronae Borealis variable stars of magnitude 10 — RT Normae and RZ Normae — rare degenerate stars thought to have formed from the merger of two white dwarfs that fade by several magnitudes periodically as they eject large amounts of carbon dust . A faint object of magnitude 16 , QV Normae is a high mass X @-@ ray binary star system 15 @,@ 000 – 20 @,@ 000 light @-@ years distant from Earth . It is composed of a neutron star orbiting a blue @-@ white supergiant approximately 20 times as massive as the Sun . The stellar wind from the more massive star is drawn to the magnetic poles of the neutron star , forming an accretion column and producing X @-@ rays . Located 19 @,@ 000 light @-@ years away , <unk> Normae is an active low mass X ray binary composed of a neutron star and its companion star that is smaller and cooler than the Sun . The neutron star is 1 @.@ 74 ± 0 @.@ 14 times as massive as the Sun , yet its radius is a mere 9 @.@ 3 ± 1 @.@ 0 km . <unk> @-@ 5055 is a neutron star found in the centre of <unk> supernova remnant . A periodic X @-@ Ray source with a period of 6 @.@ 67 hours , it is approximately 2000 years old and 10 @,@ 000 light @-@ years away from Earth . It is unusual in that it is spinning much too slowly for its young age , behaving instead like a multi @-@ million @-@ year @-@ old star . SGR <unk> @-@ <unk> is a soft gamma repeater ( SGR ) — a magnetar that is emitting gamma ray flares , located some 30 @,@ 000 light @-@ years distant from Earth . The rotation period , of approximately 2 @.@ 07 seconds , is the fastest yet observed for a magnetar . <unk> <unk> @-@ 564 is another X @-@ ray binary , this time composed of a large black hole around 10 times as massive as the Sun and a cool orange donor star . The black hole is a microquasar , firing off jets of material most likely from its accretion disk . 
 Four star systems are known to harbour planets . HD <unk> is a sunlike star around 164 light @-@ years distant that is orbited by a hot Jupiter every 3 @.@ 4 days . Announced in 2004 , it was the first planet discovered by the HARPS spectrograph . HD <unk> is a star 168 ± 7 light @-@ years distant . Slightly larger and hotter than the Sun , it was found to have a roughly Jupiter @-@ size planet with an orbital period of 2 @.@ 8 years . HD <unk> is a binary star system composed of a sunlike star and a faint red dwarf separated by 30 @.@ 9 AU . A planet roughly triple the mass of Jupiter orbits the brighter star every 1057 ± 20 days . HD <unk> is approximately 113 light @-@ years distant and has a Jupiter @-@ sized planet with an orbital period of around 386 days . 
 = = = Deep @-@ sky objects = = = 
 Due to its location on the Milky Way , this constellation contains many deep @-@ sky objects such as star clusters , including eight open clusters visible through binoculars . NGC 6087 is the brightest of the open clusters in Norma with a magnitude of 5 @.@ 4 . It lies in the southeastern corner of the constellation between Alpha Centauri and Zeta Arae . Thought to be around 100 million years old , it is about 3300 light @-@ years away and is around 14 light @-@ years in diameter . Its brightest member is the Cepheid variable S Normae . A rich background star field makes it less distinct , though around 36 member stars are visible though a 10 cm telescope at <unk> magnification . Located 0 @.@ 4 ° north of Kappa Normae is NGC <unk> , which has an integrated magnitude of 5 @.@ 6 though it is indistinct as it lies in a rich star field . It is thought to be around 102 million years old , and contain 891 solar masses . Two Cepheid variables — QZ Normae and <unk> Normae — have been identified as members of the cluster . Fainter open clusters include NGC <unk> with a combined magnitude of 7 @.@ 2 and located 4000 light @-@ years away from Earth , the spread @-@ out NGC <unk> of magnitude 6 @.@ 7 , NGC <unk> near Gamma Normae , NGC <unk> and NGC <unk> . 
 Located around 4900 light @-@ years distant is Shapley 1 ( or PK 329 + 02 @.@ 1 ) , a planetary nebula better known as the Fine @-@ Ring Nebula . Appearing ring @-@ shaped , it is thought that it actually is cylindrical and oriented directly at Earth . Around 8700 years old , it lies about five degrees west @-@ northwest of Gamma1 Normae . Its integrated magnitude is 13 @.@ 6 and its mean surface brightness is 13 @.@ 9 . The central star is a white dwarf of magnitude 14 @.@ 03 . <unk> 1 is a bipolar planetary nebula , thought to be an hourglass shape tilted at an angle to observers on Earth , some 3500 light @-@ years distant . <unk> 3 — known as the Ant Nebula as it resembles an ant — has a complex appearance , with at least four outflow jets and two large lobes visible . 
 Approximately 200 million light @-@ years from Earth with a redshift of 0 @.@ 016 is Abell 3627 ; also called the Norma Cluster , it is one of the most massive galaxy clusters known to exist , at ten times the average cluster mass . Abell 3627 is thus theorized to be the Great <unk> , a massive object that is pulling the Local Group , the Virgo Supercluster , and the Hydra @-@ Centaurus Supercluster towards its location at 600 – 1000 kilometres per second . 
 = Jason Jones ( programmer ) = 
 Jason Jones ( born June 1 , 1971 ) is a video game developer and programmer who co @-@ founded the video game studio Bungie with Alex Seropian in 1991 . Jones began programming on Apple computers in high school , assembling a multiplayer game called Minotaur : The Labyrinths of Crete . While attending the University of Chicago , Jones met Seropian and the two formed a partnership to publish Minotaur . 
 Following the modest success of Minotaur , Jones programmed Bungie 's next game , Pathways Into Darkness , and worked on code , level design and story development for Bungie 's Marathon and Myth series . For Bungie 's next projects , Halo : Combat Evolved and Halo 2 , Jones took on a more managerial role as project lead . He worked as design lead on the 2014 video game Destiny . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Jones became interested in programming in high school , and learned <unk> BASIC and 6502 Assembly on an Apple II series computer . When Apple released its Macintosh line , Jones 's family purchased a Macintosh 128K , but Jones never programmed much for it . After high school Jones got a job programming for a computer @-@ aided design company on PCs , before going to college the next year . In his off time Jones said that all he ever did on the Apple II was write games , " and it seemed logical to continue that on the Mac , " he said . " The first thing I did on the Mac was to port a modem game I 'd written called Minotaur from 6502 Assembly on the Apple II into MPW C on the Mac . I was still finishing that when I came to college . By that time , I knew I wanted to write games . " 
 = = Bungie = = 
 Jones met Alex Seropian in his second year at the University of Chicago . In 1991 Seropian had founded Bungie and published his own game , Operation Desert Storm . Seropian was looking for another game to publish , and they decided to work together to finish Minotaur . While Seropian did design and marketing , Jones finished the programming . Minotaur : The Labyrinths of Crete shipped in April 1992 ; while the game sold only around 2 @,@ 500 copies ( it required a then @-@ rare modem for network play ) , it developed a devoted following . After publishing Minotaur , Jones and Seropian formed a partnership ; " What I liked about him was that he never wasted any money " , Jones said of his partner . 
 Bungie focused on the Mac platform due to familiarity with the platform and ease of use . " The PC market was really cutthroat , but the Mac market was all friendly and lame . So it was easier to compete , " Jones said . After Minotaur , Bungie began work on a 3D graphics version of the game , but realized that the game 's format was not suited to a 3D environment . Instead , Jones and Seropian wrote a brand @-@ new story for what became Pathways Into Darkness . Since Bungie had no money and Jones was the only one with the available time , he single @-@ handedly coded the game on a Mac <unk> , passing art chores to his friend Colin Brent . Pathways was successful enough that Bungie moved from a one @-@ bedroom apartment to an actual office . 
 Bungie 's next project started as an update of Pathways but evolved into a science fiction shooter game , Marathon . The game included state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art graphics , network multiplayer , and voice support , and won a number of awards on release in 1994 . Jones recalled that he was surprised anyone ever completed the game and sought to atone for some of its shortcomings with its sequel , Marathon 2 : Durandal , which was also released for Windows PCs . The Marathon series was followed by a series of real @-@ time strategy games , starting with Myth : The Fallen Lords in 1996 . 
 Bungie continued to expand , and in 1997 work began on a new project , codenamed Blam ! ( Jones had changed the name from Monkey Nuts because he could not bring himself to tell his mother about the new game under that title . ) Blam ! evolved from a real @-@ time strategy game to a third @-@ person shooter to a first @-@ person shooter called Halo : Combat Evolved . Jones role in development was unlike Marathon and Myth , where Jones was involved in developing more than half the levels and much to most of the story . Instead , he was the project lead and a manager , barely providing any code to the game . He would read war journals by authors such as John Kinkaid and Winston Churchill . 
 In 2000 , Microsoft acquired Bungie , moving the team from Chicago to Washington State . Jones recalled that the buyout was a " blur [ ... ] We 'd been talking to people for years and years — before we even published Marathon , Activision made a serious offer [ to buy us ] . But the chance to work on [ the Microsoft Xbox console ] — the chance to work with a company that took the games seriously . Before that we worried that we 'd get bought by someone who just wanted Mac ports or didn 't have a clue . " Around the same time , a glitch in versions of Myth II was found to entirely erase a player 's hard drive ; this led to a massive recall of the games right before they shipped , costing Bungie nearly one million dollars . Composer Martin O 'Donnell said that this recall created financial uncertainty in the studio , though accepting the offer was not something " Bungie had to do . " Jones and Seropian refused to accept Microsoft 's offer until the entire studio agreed to the buyout . 
 Combat Evolved was highly successful , selling more than a million units in its first six months and driving Xbox sales . Jones led the development team that created its sequel , Halo 2 , and he worked as design lead on a new video game series , Destiny . He was listed in Next Generation Magazine 's top 100 Developers in 2006 and 2007 . 
 = Cyclone Hyacinthe = 
 Tropical Cyclone Hyacinthe was the wettest tropical cyclone on record in the world . The eighth named storm of the season , Hyacinthe formed on January 15 , 1980 , to the northeast of Mauritius in the southern Indian Ocean . Initially it moved to the west @-@ southwest , and while slowly intensifying it passed north of the French overseas department of Réunion . On January 19 , Météo @-@ France estimated that the storm had intensified to a tropical cyclone . Hyacinthe looped to the south of eastern Madagascar and weakened , although it restrengthened after turning to the east . The storm executed another loop to the southwest of Réunion , passing near the island for a second and later third time . Hyacinthe became extratropical on January 29 after turning southward , dissipating two days later . 
 For twelve days , Hyacinthe dropped torrential rainfall on Réunion ; nearly all of the island received more than 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) of precipitation . Over a 15 day period from January 14 to January 28 , 6 @,@ 083 mm ( 239 @.@ 5 in ) of rainfall were recorded at Commerson 's Crater , a volcano . The heaviest rainfall occurred through a process called orographic lift in the mountainous interior , leading to hundreds of landslides . Widespread floods damaged half the roads on Réunion and isolated three villages . Hyacinthe caused heavy damage to crops and damaged or destroyed 2 @,@ 000 houses . Losses from the storm totaled $ 167 million ( 1980 USD , 676 million francs ) , and 25 people were killed . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 In the middle of January 1980 , the Intertropical Convergence Zone persisted along 10 ° S , spawning a small low @-@ level circulation near St. Brandon . According to Météo @-@ France ( MFR ) , a tropical depression formed about 355 km ( 220 mi ) northeast of Mauritius on January 15 . It tracked to the west @-@ southwest , passing north of the island on January 17 . That day , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) also reported that a tropical depression had developed , labeling it " 08S " . Shortly thereafter , the JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm , and the MFR followed suit on January 18 , naming the storm Hyacinthe . The storm gradually intensified as it passed north of Réunion , with 1 @-@ minute winds of 110 km / h ( 70 mph ) by January 19 , according to the JTWC . That day , an eye developed , and MFR estimated that Hyacinthe intensified to tropical cyclone status , with 10 @-@ minute winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . A strengthening anticyclone to the south turned the storm northwestward , and on January 20 Hyacinthe executed a small loop to the south just offshore eastern Madagascar . 
 While moving to the south , Hyacinthe 's winds steadily decreased . On January 21 , the storm weakened below tropical cyclone intensity , and on January 22 the JTWC estimated winds decreased to 75 km / h ( 45 mph ) . The next day , it turned to the east while slowly re @-@ intensifying . On January 24 , the JTWC upgraded Hyacinthe to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane , with winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . After approaching within 175 km ( 120 mi ) west @-@ southwest of Réunion , the cyclone turned to the northwest and executed another loop . The JTWC estimated that Hyacinthe reached peak winds of 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) on January 25 , which the storm maintained for about 24 hours . During that time , Hyacinthe turned to the southeast and later weakened . On January 26 , it moved near Réunion for the third time , passing about 105 km ( 65 mi ) to the south . The storm turned southward , becoming extratropical on January 29 . Over the next two days , the remnants of Hyacinthe accelerated , turned to the east , and dissipated over the southern Indian Ocean . 
 = = Impact = = 
 For twelve days , the circulation of the storm produced cloudiness and thunderstorms over Réunion . Hyacinthe broke several rainfall records for tropical cyclones , becoming the wettest tropical cyclone on record . From January 14 to January 28 , the storm dropped 6 @,@ 083 mm ( 239 @.@ 5 in ) at Commerson , just north of the Piton de la Fournaise volcano . Over ten days , Hyacinthe produced 5 @,@ 678 mm ( 223 @.@ 5 in ) , also at Commerson . In twelve hours , Hyacinthe dropped 1 @,@ 095 mm ( 43 @.@ 1 in ) of rainfall at Grand <unk> , just 49 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) shy of the record set by Cyclone Denise in 1966 . The highest daily total was on January 25 , when 1 @,@ 140 mm ( 45 in ) fell at Commerson . Over a three @-@ day period , the storm dropped 3 @,@ 240 mm ( 127 @.@ 6 in ) at Commerson , as well as 4 @,@ 300 mm ( 169 in ) over a five @-@ day period ending on January 28 . Only a small portion of the island near Saint @-@ Pierre received less than 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) of rainfall , and totals increased further inland , with over 2 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) recorded at four locations . Such heavy rainfall typically occurs on the island when tropical cyclones approach , owing to orographic enhancement in the mountainous interior . 
 In addition to the rainfall , Hyacinthe produced a minimum barometric pressure of 977 @.@ 8 mbar ( 28 @.@ 87 inHg ) at Saint @-@ Pierre on January 27 . Wind gusts reached 150 km / h ( 93 mph ) in Saint @-@ Denis , although the mountainous portion of the island reported winds as strong as 180 km / h ( 110 mph ) . Wave action was not severe due to the quick changes in track and lack of significant intensity . There was some beach erosion along western @-@ facing beaches , and Pointe des Galets sustained damage to coastal properties . However , any major damage caused by the storm was largely due to the heavy rainfall . The Rivière Langevin reported increased flow , reaching a discharge of about 300 m ³ / s ( 10 @,@ 500 ft ³ / s ) . Along Rivière @-@ du @-@ Mat les Bas , river flooding entered five houses . Floods washed out a 30 m ( 98 ft ) and a 60 m ( 200 ft ) portion of a highway along a ravine near <unk> . Along Route nationale 1 , traffic was disrupted after rocks blocked the roadway . In Petite @-@ Île , floods washed out a bridge and 200 m ( 660 ft ) of roads . About half of the roads on Réunion were damaged , and road damage was estimated at $ 40 million ( 1980 USD , 161 @.@ 3 million francs ) . The rain caused widespread mudslides , including hundreds near Salazie and Cilaos . Three towns were temporarily isolated , including Hell @-@ Bourg which was cut off for about eight days , Helicopters delivered food and clothing to the villages . 
 Throughout Réunion , Hyacinthe killed 25 people and left 7 @,@ 000 homeless . Four of the deaths occurred after a house was washed away at Petite @-@ Île . A school was destroyed in Saint @-@ Louis . The storm caused power and water outages , and about 30 % of the island temporarily lost phone service . Hyacinthe damaged 1 @,@ 712 houses and destroyed another 288 ; housing damage totaled about $ 42 million ( 1980 USD , 170 million francs ) . Flooding caused $ 48 million ( 1980 USD , 194 million francs ) in agricultural damage , including about 1 @,@ 000 killed cattle and near @-@ total losses to bananas , mangoes , and avocados . Overall damage was estimated at $ 167 million ( 676 million francs ) . Many records set by the storm were broken by Cyclone Gamede in 2007 , including the rainfall accumulations from three to eight days . However , Hyacinthe retained its status as the wettest overall tropical cyclone . 
 Elsewhere , Hyacinthe affected Madagascar as a weaker storm . Wind gusts reached 126 km / h ( 78 mph ) at Mananjary and 111 km / h ( 69 mph ) on Île Sainte @-@ Marie . At the same two locations , rainfall reached 207 mm ( 8 @.@ 1 in ) and 134 mm ( 5 @.@ 3 in ) , respectively . On Mauritius , the storm 's passage forced the main port to close . 
 = Robert C. Stebbins = 
 Robert Cyril Stebbins ( March 31 , 1915 – September 23 , 2013 ) was an American herpetologist and illustrator known for his field guides and popular books as well as his studies of reptiles and amphibians . His Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians , first published in 1966 , is still considered the definitive reference of its kind , owing to both the quality of the illustrations and the comprehensiveness of the text . A professor of zoology at the University of California , Berkeley , for over 30 years , he was the first curator of herpetology at the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology , a 1949 Guggenheim fellow , and author of over 70 scientific articles . His discovery of the ring species phenomenon in Ensatina salamanders is now a textbook example of speciation , and he performed extensive research on the parietal eye of reptiles . He produced nature films , supported science education in primary grades , and organized conservation efforts that aided in the passing of the 1994 California Desert Protection Act . After retirement he continued to paint , collect field notes , and write books . Stebbins is commemorated in the scientific names of three species : Batrachoseps stebbinsi , the Tehachapi slender salamander ; <unk> stebbinsi , a legless lizard ; and Ambystoma tigrinum stebbinsi , the endangered Sonora tiger salamander . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Robert Stebbins was born on March 31 , 1915 , in Chico , California , to parents Cyril and Louise Stebbins ( née Beck ) . His father , born in Wisconsin of English descent , was an instructor at Chico State Normal School who had also published on birds and agriculture , stressing the importance of gardening in education . The oldest of seven children , young Robert grew up learning about local birds and exploring the wildlife of Northern California . His mother , born in Switzerland and educated at the Normal School , instilled a sense of artistry in Robert , painting pictures for Robert and his siblings in her spare time . When Stebbins was seven , his family moved to the San Francisco Bay Area , where his father worked on agricultural curriculum for children and taught at the University of California , Berkeley . Around the age of nine , his family moved to Southern California , living first in Pomona , then in Sherman Oaks , Los Angeles . Stebbins spent time hiking in the nearby Santa Monica Mountains , exploring the wildlife and amassing a collection of bird and mammal specimens which he prepared and mounted himself . Stebbins attended North Hollywood High School , where his father taught hygiene and agriculture . Robert graduated in 1933 . He discovered his artistic talents around sixteen years old . His early work consisted of cartoons : he drew illustrations on classmates ' clothing and contributed cartoons to youth magazines , winning several awards . 
 = = University and early career ( 1933 – 1945 ) = = 
 Shortly after graduating high school , Stebbins enrolled in the University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) . He initially majored in civil engineering , thinking it a better career option than biology , but became unhappy with the program . Struggling with poor performance and health issues related to congenital heart problems , he took a leave for year and a half . During his time in recuperation , he turned his attention back to natural history , and was persuaded to return to UCLA by Raymond Cowles , a biology professor there . Stebbins returned with enthusiasm despite the perceived lack of job security , remarking in 1985 : " I was cautious because of the Great Depression , but I was determined to pursue biology even if it meant standing on a corner with a tin cup . " He switched his major to zoology and graduated in 1940 with highest honors . 
 After graduating , Stebbins split his time between a summer job as a naturalist at Lassen Volcanic National Park and pursuing graduate school at UCLA . Over the next few years he also obtained teaching credentials in junior college , high school , and elementary education . Stebbins initially planned to study birds , with an eye towards <unk> , but felt the field of ornithology was too crowded , while herpetology , the study of reptiles and amphibians , offered more opportunities for new research . Cowles became his graduate advisor . The main focus of Stebbins ' graduate research was the biology of fringe @-@ toed lizards , a group of sand @-@ dwelling lizards of the American Southwest . For his master 's degree ( completed in 1942 ) he studied the anatomical structure of the nasal passages of the lizards , documenting in detail the looped , horseshoe @-@ shaped structure of the nasal passages that functions as a u @-@ trap , preventing sand grains from being inhaled while the lizards lay buried at the sand 's surface . His Ph.D dissertation ( completed in 1943 ) further explored the anatomical , behavioral , and physiological adaptations of the lizards . During this time he also published on the behavior of the sidewinder rattlesnake , and , with his father , produced two field guides to birds , providing illustrations to his father 's text . Their first book , What Bird is That ? , was pressed in the family garage . Stebbins considered his father " a pioneer of sorts in the extensive use of drawings in teaching natural history , " a tradition he later strove to continue in his own works . 
 On June 8 , 1941 , Stebbins married Anna @-@ rose Cooper , who would eventually type the text of all of Stebbins ' field guides . Part of their honeymoon was spent camping in the Owens Valley of southeastern California . 
 = = Career ( 1945 – 1978 ) = = 
 In 1945 Stebbins was hired an assistant professor of zoology at the University of California , Berkeley , and became the first curator of herpetology at the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology , where he would remain throughout his career . The first faculty member to teach herpetology at Berkeley , he wrote new lab manuals , created the herpetology teaching collection , and co @-@ taught a popular course on vertebrate natural history .

 Stebbins soon became interested in Ensatina salamanders , which occur from British Columbia to Baja California and are present in both the Sierra Nevada and Coast Ranges of California but absent in the Central Valley . Finding the salamanders in Berkeley much different than the ones he was used to seeing in the mountains of Southern California , he embarked upon a research program examining color differences throughout California . In his resulting monograph , published in 1949 , he proposed that the color varieties — many previously regarded as distinct species — were actually various races or subspecies of a single species that in most locations interbreed where two forms co @-@ occur , creating hybrids that partially resemble both forms . However , at the southern edge of the Central Valley , where the Sierra foothill populations come into contact with those of the Coast Range , the populations do not interbreed , instead acting as distinct species . This phenomenon is known as a ring speciation , with different populations representing different stages of speciation , the process by which one species becomes two . Zoologist Arnold Grobman called Stebbins ' research " without doubt , the most outstanding study of a genus of American salamanders that has yet appeared . " The Ensatina complex has been the focus of research ever since , and is a widely used textbook example of evolutionary processes .

 Stebbins ' early work with lizards in the southern California desert led to a series of papers from the 1950s through the 1970s exploring the parietal eye of reptiles ( also called the " third eye " , a tiny light @-@ sensitive organ on the forehead ) and the associated pineal gland , both of which are now known to influence circadian rhythms . Aided by a Senior Postdoctoral Fellowship from the National Science Foundation , Stebbins and colleagues found that lizards with the parietal eye surgically removed changed their behavior : they became active much earlier in the day , spent more time in the sun , and remained active much later than control lizards . Further studies over the next few decades focused on the parietal eye of the tuatara , the pineal gland 's effects on lizard reproductive behavior , and parietal skull openings in fossil " mammal @-@ like reptiles " such as Lystrosaurus . His work had implications beyond reptile biology : Nobel laureate Julius Axelrod , after reading the work of Stebbins and others , began investigating the pineal gland in mammals , with emphasis on the effect of melatonin on activity cycles . Melatonin has since been found to influence human health . Stebbins was proud of his parietal and pineal work , calling it " possibly the single piece of research which gives me the most satisfaction . "

 In 1949 Stebbins received a Guggenheim Fellowship that allowed him to extend his studies throughout the western United States and to collect enough material to begin preparing his first amphibian field manuals . The first of these to appear was Amphibians of Western North America ( 1951 , University of California Press ) , covering the U.S. and Canada roughly west of the 102nd meridian . Praised for its thoroughness as well as its illustrations , the book " unquestionably provides more information concerning the 51 species … covered than any preceding it , " wrote Charles M. <unk> : " The maps provided for each species and subspecies are on the whole the most detailed and accurate of any thus far published . " Stebbins ' second herpetological field guide , Amphibians and Reptiles of Western North America ( 1954 , McGraw @-@ Hill ) , was similarly praised . 
 In 1964 Stebbins visited the Galápagos Islands on a research expedition and studied the ecology and behavior of marine iguanas and lava lizards . Also on the expedition was Roger Tory Peterson , who recalled " While the rest of were enjoying high adventure on the more remote islands and sea @-@ girt rocks , he patiently snared 200 frisky lizards with a noose of thread suspended from a rod . He took their cloacal temperatures , marked them with dye , and then dosed them with radioactive iodine , which enabled him to locate the elusive reptiles later with a Geiger counter . " In 1966 , Stebbins produced what became his best @-@ known book , A Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians ( Peterson Field Guides ) , which Peterson called " a classic ... one of the most beautiful as well as scholarly works in the series " . 
 Stebbins was also committed to education and conservation . He made appearances on the TV series Science in Action , traveled to Asia to promote science education , and chaired a U.C. elementary school science project which recommended that science be taught to children as early as six . In conjunction with the Sierra Club he produced two educational films : Nature Next Door ( 1962 ) and No Room for Wilderness ? ( 1967 ) . Stebbins co @-@ authored revisions of the widely used textbooks General Zoology ( 5th ed . , 1972 ; 6th ed . , 1979 ) and Elements of Zoology ( 4th ed . , 1974 ) , books originally written by Tracy Storer and Robert Usinger . 
 In the late 1960s Stebbins became concerned about the impacts that increasingly popular off @-@ road vehicle ( ORV ) driving was having on desert ecosystems of southern California — witnessing environmental degradation in some of the same places he had studied during graduate school — and became actively involved in over a decade of conservation efforts . Stebbins and colleagues studied the diversity of organisms in and around ORV areas , communicated research to Bureau of Land Management officials , and petitioned President Jimmy Carter to limit all @-@ terrain vehicle use in deserts . Stebbins faced opposition from ORV riders and their lobbyists : American Motorcyclist magazine called him a " staunch abolitionist in the war against motorized vehicles in the desert . " Stebbins ' efforts eventually helped secure the passing of the California Desert Protection Act of 1994 which established the Mojave National Preserve and elevated Joshua Tree and Death Valley from national monuments to more protected national parks . In 1998 Stebbins was recognized in the U.S. Congress by Representative George Miller and the Contra Costa Times as one of 10 environmental leaders deemed " national treasures " for their activism . 
 Other research included field work in Colombia , South Africa , and Australia , and the description of the Jemez Mountains salamander , southern torrent salamander and yellow @-@ eyed <unk> , and the <unk> alligator lizard . Two salamanders were named in his honor during his time at Berkeley : the Tehachapi slender salamander ( Batrachoseps stebbinsi ) and the Sonora tiger salamander ( Ambystoma tigrinum stebbinsi ) . Over his 32 years at Berkeley , Stebbins was the advisor to 29 graduate students , including Wade Fox , Richard G. Zweifel , and R. Bruce Bury . Upon his retirement from UC Berkeley in 1978 , Stebbins was awarded the highest faculty honor , the Berkeley Citation .
