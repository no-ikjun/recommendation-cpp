 Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam ( The Emperor of the Mughals ) is a 1960 Indian epic historical drama film directed by K. Asif and produced by Shapoorji Pallonji . Starring Prithviraj Kapoor , Dilip Kumar , Madhubala , and Durga Khote , it follows the love affair between Mughal Prince Salim ( who went on to become Emperor Jahangir ) and Anarkali , a court dancer . Salim 's father , Emperor Akbar , disapproves of the relationship , which leads to a war between father and son . 
 The development of Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam began in 1944 , when Asif read a play set in the reign of Emperor Akbar ( 1556 – 1605 ) . Production was plagued by delays and financial uncertainty . Before its principal photography began in the early 1950s the project had lost a financier and undergone a complete change of cast . Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam cost more to produce than any previous Indian motion picture ; the budget for a single song sequence exceeded that typical for an entire film of the period . The soundtrack , inspired by Indian classical and folk music , comprises 12 songs voiced by playback singers including Lata Mangeshkar and classical singer Bade Ghulam Ali Khan . It is often cited as one of the finest soundtracks in Bollywood cinematic history . 
 Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam had the widest release of any Indian film up to that time and patrons often queued all day for tickets . Released on 5 August 1960 it broke box office records in India , and became the highest @-@ grossing Bollywood film of all time , a distinction it held for 15 years . The accolades awarded to the film include one National Film Award and three Filmfare Awards . Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam was the first black @-@ and @-@ white Hindi film to be digitally coloured , and the first in any language to be given a theatrical re @-@ release . The colour version , released in November 2004 , was a commercial success . 
 The film is widely considered a milestone of its genre , earning praise from critics for its grandeur and attention to detail . Film scholars have welcomed its portrayal of enduring themes , but question its historical accuracy . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Emperor Akbar ( Prithviraj Kapoor ) , who does not have a male heir , undertakes a pilgrimage to a shrine to pray that his wife Jodhabai ( Durga Khote ) give birth to a son . Later , a maid brings the emperor news of his son 's birth . Overjoyed at his prayers being answered Akbar gives the maid his ring , and promises to grant her anything she desires . 
 The son , Prince Salim , grows up to be spoiled , flippant , and self @-@ indulgent . His father sends him off to war , to teach him courage and discipline . Fourteen years later Salim returns as a distinguished soldier ( Dilip Kumar ) and falls in love with court @-@ dancer Nadira , whom the emperor has renamed Anarkali ( Madhubala ) , meaning pomegranate blossom . The relationship is discovered by the jealous Bahar ( <unk> Sultana ) , a dancer of a higher rank , who wants the prince to love her so that she may one day become queen . Unsuccessful in winning Salim 's love , she exposes his forbidden relationship with Anarkali . Salim pleads to marry Anarkali , but his father refuses , and imprisons her . Despite her treatment , Anarkali refuses to reject Salim , as Akbar demands . 
 Salim rebels and amasses an army to confront Akbar and rescue Anarkali . Defeated in battle , Salim is sentenced to death by his father , but is told that the sentence will be revoked if Anarkali , now in hiding , is handed over to die in his place . Anarkali gives herself up to save the prince 's life , and is condemned to death by being entombed alive . Before her sentence is carried out , she begs to have a few hours with Salim as his make @-@ believe wife . Her request is granted , as she has agreed to drug Salim so that he cannot interfere with her entombment . As Anarkali is being walled up , Akbar is reminded that he still owes her mother a favour , as it was she who brought him news of Salim 's birth . Anarkali 's mother pleads for her daughter 's life . The emperor has a change of opinion , but although he wants to release Anarkali he cannot , because of his duty to his country . He therefore arranges for her secret escape into exile with her mother , but demands that the pair are to live in obscurity , and that Salim is never to know that Anarkali is still alive .

 The Urdu dramatist Imtiaz Ali Taj wrote a play about the love story of Salim and Anarkali in 1922 , based more on a 16th @-@ century legend than on fact . A stage version was soon produced , and screen versions followed . Ardeshir Irani made a silent film , Anarkali , in 1928 , and remade it with sound in 1935 . In the early 1940s , the tale of Anarkali inspired producer Shiraz Ali Hakeem and young director K. Asif ( <unk> Asif ) to make another film adaptation which they would title Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam . They recruited four Urdu writers to develop the screenplay and dialogue : Aman ( Zeenat Aman 's father , also known as Amanullah Khan ) , Wajahat Mirza , Kamaal Amrohi , and Ehsan Rizvi . It is not known how the writers collaborated or shared out their work , but in 2010 The Times of India said that their " mastery over Urdu 's poetic idiom and expression is present in every line , giving the film , with its rich plots and intricate characters , the overtones of a Shakespearean drama . " As the script neared completion , Asif cast Chandra Mohan , D.K. Sapru , and Nargis for the roles of Akbar , Salim , and Anarkali , respectively . Shooting started in 1946 in Bombay Talkies studio . 
 The project faced multiple hurdles , which forced its temporary abandonment . The political tensions and communal rioting surrounding India 's 1947 partition and independence stalled production . Shortly after partition , Shiraz Ali migrated to Pakistan , leaving Asif without a financier . The actor Chandra Mohan suffered a heart attack and died in 1949 . Shiraz Ali had previously suggested that business tycoon Shapoorji Pallonji could finance the film . Although Pallonji knew nothing about film production , in 1950 he agreed to produce the film because of his interest in the history of Akbar . Production was then restarted with a new cast . 
 Believing that the film had been cancelled , Kamal Amrohi , one of the scriptwriters who was also a director , planned to make a film on the same subject himself . When confronted by Asif , he agreed to shelve the project . Another unrelated film production based on the same stage play was <unk> <unk> 's Anarkali , starring Bina Rai and Pradeep Kumar , which became the highest grossing Bollywood film of 1953 . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Asif had initially rejected Dilip Kumar for the part of Prince Salim . Kumar was reluctant to act in a period film , but accepted the role upon the insistence of the film 's producer . According to Kumar , " Asif trusted me enough to leave the delineation of Salim completely to me . " Kumar faced difficulty while filming in Rajasthan owing to the heat and the body armour he wore . The part of Anarkali had first been offered to Suraiya but later went to Madhubala , who had been longing for a significant role . Madhubala suffered from congenital heart disease , which was one of the reasons why at times she fainted on set ; she also endured skin abrasions while filming the prison sequences , but was determined to finish the film . 
 To become the character of Emperor Akbar , Prithviraj Kapoor was reported to have " relied completely on the script and director " . Prior to make @-@ up , Kapoor would declare , " Prithviraj Kapoor ab <unk> <unk> hai " ( " Prithviraj Kapoor is now going " ) ; after make @-@ up , he would announce , " Akbar ab aa <unk> hai " ( " Akbar is now coming " ) . Kapoor faced difficulty with his heavy costumes and suffered blisters on his feet after walking barefoot in the desert for a sequence . Lance Dane , a photographer who was on set during the filming , recalled that Kapoor struggled to remember his lines in some scenes ; he mentioned one scene in particular that Kapoor required 19 takes to get right . At the time of filming , Kapoor who was on a diet , was told by Asif to regain the lost weight for his portrayal of Akbar . Zakir Hussain , who later became a tabla maestro , had initially been considered for the part of the young Prince Salim , but it became the debut role of Jalal Agha , who later performed in the song " Mehbooba Mehbooba " from Sholay ( 1975 ) .

 The production design of the film , led by art director M. K. Syed , was extravagant , and some sets took six weeks to erect . The film , mostly shot in studio sets designed to represent the interior of a Mughal palace , featured opulent furnishings and water features such as fountains and pools , generating the feel of a Hollywood historical epic of the period . The song " Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya " was filmed in Mohan Studios on a set built as a replica of the Sheesh Mahal in the Lahore Fort . The set was noted for its size , measuring 150 feet ( 46 m ) in length , 80 feet ( 24 m ) in breadth and 35 feet ( 11 m ) in height . A much @-@ discussed aspect was the presence of numerous small mirrors made of Belgian glass , which were crafted and designed by workers from <unk> . The set took two years to build and cost more than ₹ 1 @.@ 5 million ( valued at about US $ 314 @,@ 000 in 1960 ) , more than the budget of an entire Bollywood film at the time . The film 's financiers feared bankruptcy as a result of the high cost of production . 
 Artisans from across India were recruited to craft the props . The costumes were designed by <unk> and Company , and Delhi @-@ based tailors skilled in <unk> embroidery stitched the Mughal costume . The footwear was ordered from Agra , the jewellery was made by goldsmiths in Hyderabad , the crowns were designed in Kolhapur , and blacksmiths from Rajasthan manufactured the armoury ( which included shields , swords , spears , daggers , and armour ) . The <unk> on costumes were also stitched by designers from Surat . A statue of Lord Krishna , to which Jodhabai prayed , was made of gold . In the scenes involving an imprisoned Anarkali , real chains were placed on Madhubala . The battle sequence between Akbar and Salim reportedly featured 2 @,@ 000 camels , 400 horses , and 8 @,@ 000 troops , mainly from the Indian Army 's Jaipur cavalry , 56th Regiment . Dilip Kumar has spoken of the intense heat during filming of the sequence in the desert of Rajasthan , wearing full armour . 
 = = = Principal photography = = = 
 Principal photography for Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam began in the early 1950s . Each sequence was reportedly filmed three times , as the film was being produced in Hindi / Urdu , Tamil , and English . The film was eventually dubbed in Tamil and released as Akbar , but that version 's commercial failure resulted in the abandonment of the planned English dubbing , for which British actors were considered . Asif was accompanied by an extensive crew , which included his assistant directors S. T. Zaidi , Khalid Akhtar , Surinder Kapoor ( assisting primarily for the English version ) , and five others . Additional crew members included cinematographer R. D. Mathur , choreographer <unk> Maharaj , production manager Aslam <unk> , editor <unk> , makeup artists P. G. Joshi and Abdul Hamid , and sound director Akram Shaikh . 
 Some film sequences were shot with up to 14 cameras , significantly more than the norm at that time . There were many difficulties with the film 's lighting . Cinematographer Mathur reportedly took eight hours to light a single shot . In total , 500 days of shooting were needed , compared to a normal schedule of 60 to 125 shooting days at the time . Owing to the very large size of the Sheesh Mahal set , the lighting was provided by the headlights of 500 trucks and about 100 reflectors . The presence of the mirrors on the set caused problems , as they sparkled under the lights . Consultants from Hollywood , including David Lean , told Asif to forget the idea since they felt that it was impossible to film the scene under the intense glare . Asif confined himself to the set with the lighting crew , and subsequently overcame the problem by covering all the mirrors with a thin layer of wax , thereby subduing their reflectivity . Mathur also used strategically placed strips of cloth to implement " bounce lighting " , which reduced the glare . 
 A number of problems and production delays were encountered during filming , to the extent that at one point Asif considered abandoning the project . Kumar defended the long duration of filming , invoking the massive logistics of the film and explaining that the entire cast and crew were " acutely conscious of the hard work [ they ] would have to put in , as well as the responsibility [ they ] would have to shoulder . " 
 The production also suffered from financial problems , and Asif exceeded the budget on a number of occasions . The final budget of the film is a subject of debate . Some sources state that Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam cost ₹ 10 @.@ 5 million to produce , about US $ 2 million at the time , while others claim it cost ₹ 15 million , about $ 3 million . This made Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam the most expensive Indian film of the period . A number of estimates put the film 's inflation @-@ adjusted budget at ₹ 500 million to ₹ 2 billion . The budget situation strained the relationship between Asif and Pallonji , while the production also faced troubled relationships among other crew members ; differences crept up between Asif and Kumar when the former married the latter 's sister . Another source of trouble was the romantic relationship and ultimate break @-@ up of Kumar and Madhubala , who had been dating for nine years . 
 = = = Post @-@ production = = = 
 Sohrab Modi 's Jhansi Ki Rani ( 1953 ) was the first Indian film to be shot in colour , and by 1957 , colour production had become increasingly common . Asif filmed one reel of Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam that included the song " Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya " in Technicolor . Impressed by the result , he filmed three more reels in Technicolor , near the story 's climax . After seeing them , he sought a complete re @-@ shoot in Technicolor , angering impatient distributors who were unwilling to accept further delays . Asif subsequently released Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam partially coloured , although he still hoped to see the full film in colour . 
 By the end of filming , more than a million feet of negative had been used , necessitating significant editing . A number of songs were edited out owing to the running time , which in the end was 197 minutes . Almost half of the songs recorded for the film were left out of the final version . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam is a family history highlighting the differences between father and son , duty to the public over family , and the trials and tribulations of women , particularly of courtesans . According to Rachel Dwyer , author of the book Filming the Gods : Religion and Indian Cinema , the film highlights religious tolerance between Hindus and Muslims . Examples include the scenes of Hindu Queen <unk> 's presence in the court of the Muslim Akbar , the singing of a Hindu devotional song by Anarkali , and Akbar 's participation in the Janmashtami celebrations , during which Akbar is shown pulling a string to rock a swing with an idol of Krishna on it . Film critic Mukul Kesavan has remarked that he was unable to recall a single other film about Hindu @-@ Muslim love in which the woman ( Jodhabai ) is Hindu . Scholars Bhaskar and Allen described the film as a tableau vivant of " <unk> culture " , evidenced in its ornate sets , musical sequences such as the qawwali scene , and chaste Urdu dialogues . Throughout the film there is a distinct depiction of Muslims as the ruling class who not only dressed differently but also spoke in complex Persianised dialogue . They are made to appear " distinct and separate from the mainstream . " 
 Film scholar Stephen Teo posits that Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam is a " national allegory " , a stylistic way of appropriating history and heritage to emphasise the national identity . He believes the arrogance of Bahar represents the power of the state and that Anarkali 's emotion , which is highly personal , represents the private individual . Teo states that the theme of romantic love defeating social class difference and power hierarchy , as well as the grandeur of the filming , contribute to the film 's attractiveness . Author Ashis Nandy has commented on the poetic quality of the dialogue , saying that " the characters of Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam do not just speak – they refine communication , they distil it , they crystallize it into many faceted glittering gems , they make poetry of ordinary language . " Gowri <unk> of The Hindu has also emphasised the power of the dialogues in the film in that they " create not only the ambiance of this period drama , but also etch character and situation . Every syllable breathes power and emotion . " 
 Philip Lutgendorf , a scholar at the University of Iowa , has stated that while the theme of the conflict between passionate individual love and family duty may be very common in Hindi film making , with endless cinematic permutations , K. Asif 's " excessive elaboration of the theme remains in a class by itself . " Further , Emperor Akbar struggles between his personal desires and his duties to the nation . Ashis Nandy noted that apart from the conflict between Akbar and his son , there is also an " unwritten alliance " between Akbar and Bahar that compounds the problems of Anarkali . He also thought it highlighted the " idea of justice and the notion of unconditional love " to uphold tradition . The song " Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya " sung by Anarkali was an indication of her defiance of societal norms . A major difference from the original story is that while the earlier <unk> films based on Imtiaz Ali Taj 's story ended as tragedies , K. Asif created a relatively happy ending in that Akbar gives amnesty to Anarkali by allowing her to escape through a secret route of tunnels below a false bottom of her prison wall , although his son is made to suffer in believing her to have perished . 
 = = Historical inaccuracies = = 
 The film is based on a legend , but it is given credence by at least two texts that assert Anarkali 's existence during the historical period of the greatest monarch of the Mughal Empire , Emperor Akbar ( 1556 – 1605 ) . One of the books states that in 1615 a marble tomb was built on Anarkali 's grave in Lahore by Salim , when he had become Emperor Jehangir . On the tomb is a Persian inscription that reads : " Ta <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ra , Aah <unk> bez <unk> roo @-@ e <unk> <unk> ra " , meaning in English : " Ah ! could I behold the face of my love once more , I would give thanks to my God until the day of resurrection . " The author of the stage play on which the film is based , Imtiaz Ali Taj , believed that the legend had no historical base , but historians have suggested that Anarkali may have been a painter , a dancer , or a courtesan , or one of Akbar 's wives and the mother of Salim 's half @-@ brother Prince <unk> . While an earlier film version of the story , Anarkali ( 1952 ) contained a disclaimer stating that the story had no foundation in history , Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam made no such claim . 
 Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam takes numerous liberties with historical fact . Historian Alex von Tunzelmann says that although the real Salim was a heavy consumer of alcohol and opium from the age of 18 , he was not necessarily a mischievous boy , as depicted in the film . When the film 's Salim returns from his time in the military he is depicted as a gentle and romantic hero , in contrast to the real Salim , who was documented as a brutal drunk who would often beat people to death . The real Salim did lead a rebellion against his father , tried to replace him as emperor , and had Akbar 's friend Abu al @-@ <unk> murdered in 1602 , but the film ascribes these actions to his desire to marry Anarkali , which is historically inaccurate . Further , there were also discrepancies in sets , costumes , and music of the film . The Sheesh Mahal , actually the royal bath of the queen , was depicted in the film as a dancing hall , and much larger . Music and dancing styles from the 19th century were shown , although the story takes place in the 16th century . For example , thumri , a semi @-@ classical music form developed in the 19th century , is adopted in a dance sequence in Kathak style , which is a 16th @-@ century dance form . 
 = = Music = = 
 The soundtrack was composed by music director Naushad , and the lyrics were written by Shakeel Badayuni . After conceiving the idea of the film , Asif visited Naushad and handed him a briefcase containing money , telling him to make " memorable music " for Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam . Offended by the explicit notion of money as a means of gaining quality , Naushad threw the notes out of the window , to the surprise of his wife . She subsequently made peace between the two men , and Asif apologised . With this , Naushad accepted the offer to direct the film 's soundtrack . 
 As with most of Naushad 's soundtracks , the songs of Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam were heavily inspired by Indian classical music and folk music , particularly ragas such as Darbari , Durga , used in the composition of " Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya " , and Kedar , used in " <unk> Pe Karam <unk> " . He also made extensive use of symphony orchestras and choruses to add grandeur to the music . The soundtrack contained a total of 12 songs , which were rendered by playback singers and classical music artists . These songs account for nearly one third of the film 's running time . The album 's cover image depicts a scene from the film in which Salim strokes Anarkali with an ostrich feather . 
 = = = Background = = = 
 A total of 20 songs were composed for the film , at an average cost of ₹ 3 @,@ 000 ( valued at about US $ 629 in 1960 ) per song , though many were left out of the final cut owing to the film 's length . Both Asif and Naushad approached Hindustani classical vocalist Bade Ghulam Ali Khan inviting him to participate in the film 's soundtrack , but he refused , explaining that he disliked working in films . Asif , adamant about the presence of Khan , asked him to name his fee . Khan quoted a fee of ₹ 25 @,@ 000 per song , at a time when Lata Mangeshkar and Mohammed Rafi ( the best paid playback singers of the time ) charged ₹ 300 – 400 per song , thinking that Asif would send him away . Instead , Asif agreed , and even gave Khan a 50 per cent advance . Surprised and left with no excuse to turn down the offer , he finally accepted . Khan sang two songs , " Prem <unk> Ban Ke " and " Shubh Din <unk> " ; both were included in the final version of the film and demonstrated the artist 's vocal virtuosity . 
 The composition of " Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya " was especially time @-@ consuming – on the day of the song 's scheduled recording , Naushad rejected two sets of lyrics by Badayuni . Subsequently , a " brainstorming session " was held on Naushad 's terrace , beginning in early evening and lasting until next day . Late in the night , Naushad remembered a folk song from eastern Uttar Pradesh with the lyrics " Prem <unk> , kya <unk> kari hai ... " ( " I have loved , does it mean that I have stolen ? " ) . The song was converted into a ghazal and subsequently recorded . At that time , since there was no technology to provide for the reverberation of sound heard in the song , Naushad had Mangeshkar sing the song in a studio bathroom . Some sources state that a chorus of a hundred singers supported singer Mohammed Rafi for the song " Ae <unk> <unk> " , though other sources place the number at a thousand . 
 The song " <unk> <unk> Pe " was objected to by veteran director Vijay Bhatt . Although he was not directly involved with the project , he thought that it would " ruin the film " , since it showed the Mughal emperor celebrating the Hindu festival Janmashtami . Though Naushad argued that the presence of Jodhabai made the situation logical , he met with the film 's screenwriters and subsequently added dialogue that explained the sequence . 
 When the film was colourised for re @-@ release , the soundtrack was also reworked , with original composer Naushad receiving help from Uttam Singh . The score remained the same , but the sound was touched up and converted to Dolby Digital . The orchestral part was re @-@ recorded with live musicians , but the original solo vocals were retained . The cost was reported to be between ₹ 2 @.@ 6 million ( US $ 39 @,@ 000 ) and ₹ 6 @.@ 5 million ( US $ 97 @,@ 000 ) .

The premiere was held amidst great fanfare , with large crowds and an extensive media presence , in addition to hosting much of the film industry , although Dilip Kumar did not attend the event owing to his dispute with Asif .

Bookings experienced major chaos , to the extent that police intervention was required . It was reported that people would wait in queues for four to five days , and would be supplied food from home through their family members . Subsequently , the Maratha Mandir closed bookings for three weeks . 
 Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam was released on 5 August 1960 in 150 cinemas across the country , establishing a record for the widest release for a Bollywood film . It became a major commercial success , earning ₹ 4 million ( US $ 839 @,@ 000 ) in the first week , eventually earning a net revenue of ₹ 55 million ( US $ 11 @,@ 530 @,@ 000 ) , and generating a profit of ₹ 30 million for the producers . Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam also experienced a long theatrical run , screening to full capacity at the Maratha Mandir for three years . The film thus became the highest @-@ grossing Bollywood film of all time by surpassing Mother India ( 1957 ) , and retained this record until Sholay ( 1975 ) surpassed its net revenue . 
 The Hindu stated in 2009 that Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam was the highest @-@ grossing Bollywood film of all time if adjusted for inflation . According to the online box office website Box Office India , the film 's adjusted net revenue would amount to ₹ 1327 million , ranking it as an " All @-@ Time Blockbuster " .

 Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam received almost universal acclaim from Indian critics ; every aspect of the film was praised . A review from the 1960s in Filmfare called it a " history @-@ making film ... the work of a team of creative artists drawn from different spheres of the art world " . It was also described as " a tribute to imagination , hard work and lavishness of its maker , Mr. Asif . For its grandeur , its beauty , and then performances of the artists it should be a landmark in Indian films . " 
 Since 2000 , reviewers have described the film as a " classic " , " benchmark " , or " milestone " in the history of Indian cinema . In 2011 , Anupama Chopra called the film " the best Hindi film ever made " and " the apotheosis of the Hindi film form " , noting specifically the performances , father @-@ son drama and song sequences . Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama praised many aspects of the film : the musical score , the battle scenes , the acting , emotions , and romance , the father @-@ son confrontation scenes , and the overall look of the film . Dinesh Raheja of Rediff called the film a must @-@ see classic , saying " a work of art is the only phrase to describe this historical whose grand palaces @-@ and @-@ fountains look has an epic sweep and whose heart @-@ wrenching core of romance has the tenderness of a feather 's touch . " Sujata Gupta of Planet Bollywood gave the film nine out of ten stars , calling it a " must see " that " has captured interest of people over generations " . 
 K. K. Rai , in his review for Stardust stated , " it can be said that the grandeur and vintage character of Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam cannot be repeated , and it will remembered as one of the most significant films made in this country . " Ziya Us Salam of The Hindu described Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam as a film people will want to watch over and over again . Raja Sen of Rediff compared the film to Spartacus ( 1960 ) and said , " Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam is awesomely , stunningly overwhelming , a magnificent spectacle entirely free of CGI and nonlinear gimmickry , a gargantuan feat of ... of ... well , of Mughal proportions ! " Laura Bushell of the BBC rated the film four out of five stars , considering it to be a " benchmark film for both Indian cinema and cinema grandeur in general " , and remarking that Mughal @-@ E @-@ Azam was an epic film in every way . Naman Ramachandran , reviewing the film for the British Film Institute , noted the depiction of religious tolerance and said the film had a tender heart . 
 Nasreen Munni Kabir , author of The Immortal Dialogue of K. Asif 's Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam , compared the film to the Koh @-@ i @-@ Noor diamond for its enduring worth to Indian cinema . Outlook , in 2008 , and Hindustan Times , in 2011 , both declared that the scene in which Salim brushes Anarkali with an ostrich feather was the most erotic and sensuous scene in the history of Indian cinema .

 Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam was the first black @-@ and @-@ white Hindi film to be digitally coloured and the first to be given a theatrical re @-@ release . The Sterling Investment Corporation , the negative rights owner and an arm of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group , undertook restoration and <unk> of Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam and assigned <unk> <unk> as Project Designer and Director . They initially approached Hollywood executives for help , but found the sales quotations , ranging from $ 12 – 15 million , too high . In 2002 , Umar Siddiqui , managing director of the Indian Academy of Arts and Animation ( <unk> ) proposed to enhance it digitally at a fraction of the cost . To convince the Shapoorji Pallonji Group , one of India 's wealthiest companies , of the commercial viability of the project , the <unk> colourised a four @-@ minute clip and showed it to them . They approved and gave the project the go @-@ ahead . Shapoorji Mistry , grandson of producer Shapoorji Pallonji Mistry , thought it a fitting tribute to complete his grandfather 's unfinished dream of <unk> the entire film . 
 The first step towards colourisation was the restoration of the original negatives , which were in poor condition owing to extensive printing of the negative during the original theatrical release . Costly and labour @-@ intensive restoration was essential before colourisation could be carried out . The negative was cleaned of fungal growth , damaged portions were restored , and missing parts of frames were re @-@ instated . After cleaning , each of the 300 @,@ 000 frames of the negative was scanned into a 10 megabytes @-@ sized file and then was digitally restored . The entire restoration work was undertaken by Acris Lab , Chennai . The dialogues in the original soundtrack were also in a bad state of preservation , which necessitated having the sound cleaned in Chace Studio , United States . The background score and the entire musical track was recreated by Naushad and Uttam Singh . For the songs , the original voices of the singers like Bade Ghulam Ali Khan , Mohammed Rafi and Lata Mangeshkar were extracted from the original mixed track and the same were recreated with re @-@ recorded score in 6 @.@ 1 surround sound . 
 The process of colourisation was preceded by extensive research . The art departments visited museums and studied the literature for background on the typical colours of clothing worn at that time . Siddiqui studied the technology used for the colourisation of black @-@ and @-@ white Hollywood classics . The team also approached a number of experts for guidance and suggestions , including Dilip Kumar , production designer Nitin Chandrakant Desai , and a historian from the Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi . To undertake the colourisation , Siddiqui brought together a team of around 100 individuals , including computer engineers and software professionals , and organised a number of art departments . The entire project was co @-@ ordinated by <unk> <unk> , who partnered with companies including Iris Interactive and <unk> Studios to execute the colourisation . The task was controlled and supervised by the producers , who received daily updates and progress reports . 
 The colourisation team spent 18 months developing software for colouring the frames , called " Effects Plus " , which was designed to accept only those colours whose hue would match the shade of grey present in the original film . This ensured that the colours added were as close to the real colour as possible ; the authenticity of the colouring was later verified when a costume used in the film was retrieved from a warehouse , and its colours were found to closely match those in the film . Every shot was finally hand @-@ corrected to perfect the look . The actual colourisation process took a further 10 months to complete . Siddiqui said that it had " been a painstaking process with men working round the clock to complete the project . " The exact cost of the colourisation is disputed , with a wide variety of estimates ranging from ₹ 20 million ( US $ 300 @,@ 000 ) to ₹ 50 million , or ₹ 100 million .

 The film 's colour version was released theatrically on 12 November 2004 , in 150 prints across India , 65 of which were in Maharashtra . The new release premiered at the Eros Cinema in Mumbai . Dilip Kumar , who had not attended the original premiere , was in attendance . The colour version was edited to a running time of 177 minutes , as compared to the original version 's 197 minutes . The new release also included a digital reworked soundtrack , produced with the assistance of Naushad , the original composer . The release on the festive Diwali weekend came with three other major releases : Veer @-@ Zaara , Aitraaz , and <unk> . It became the 19th highest grossing Bollywood film of the year , behind Aitraaz and Veer @-@ Zaara ( the top grosser ) , but ahead of <unk> . 
 Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam became the first full @-@ length feature film colourised for a theatrical re @-@ release ; although some Hollywood films had been colourised earlier they were only available for home media . It was subsequently selected for seven international film festivals . Upon release , the film drew crowds to the cinemas , with an overall occupancy of 90 per cent . Subsequently , it completed a 25 @-@ week run . While some critics complained that the colours were " psychedelic " or " unnatural " , others hailed the effort as a technological achievement . Film critic Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times remarked that while <unk> was not a good idea for most black @-@ and @-@ white classics , it was perfect in this particular instance . He compared it to films by Cecil B. DeMille and to Gone With the Wind ( 1939 ) for its larger @-@ than @-@ life storytelling . The Guardian said that although the new version was an improvement , " the fake colours tend to look flat and brash , detracting from cinematographer RD Mathur 's elegantly composed shots . " The BBC 's Jaspreet Pandohar , observing that the film was " restored in appealing candy @-@ colours and high quality sound " , considered it a " cross between Gone With the Wind and Ben @-@ Hur " . Other critics have said that they prefer the black and white version . 
 In 2006 , Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam became only the fourth Indian film certified for showing in Pakistan since the 1965 ban on Indian cinema , and was released with a premiere in Lahore . It was distributed by Nadeem <unk> Entertainment , at the request of Asif 's son , Akbar Asif . A 3D version of the film was reported to have been planned in 2009 , but was never released . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam is one of only two films directed by Asif ; one of his unfinished projects was released posthumously as a tribute . Over time the title has become part of Bollywood vernacular , used to describe a project that is taking too long to complete . Art director Omung Kumar , who has designed sets for major Indian films such as Black ( 2005 ) and Saawariya ( 2007 ) , said that he and others in his field look to Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam as a source of inspiration for art direction . It has also been used as a model for the perfect love story , requiring directors to ensure lovers overcome obstacles . Following her success in the film , Madhubala could have gone on to land further major roles , but she was advised not to overwork owing to her fragile heart condition , and had to withdraw from some productions that were already underway . 
 The Guardian in 2013 cited Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam as a " landmark of cinema " despite its historical inaccuracies , and the BBC stated in 2005 that it is " widely considered one of Bollywood 's most iconic films " . Imtiaz Ali of The Times of India in 2010 called it the " most proto @-@ typical , high involvement , expensive , passionate piece of work that Hindi cinema has ever produced " , one that " set the standard for everything that will ever come after it " . It continues to be regarded by critics as the Indian equivalent of Gone with the Wind . Filmmaker Subhash Ghai was quoted in 2010 as saying that a film like this could never be repeated : " Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam is an all @-@ time classic and has been the ultimate love story in Hindi cinema at all levels . So it will always remain alive for generations to come . " To commemorate the film 's anniversary , Asif 's friend the actor and producer Shah Rukh Khan had his company Red Chillies Entertainment produce a documentary video titled Mughal @-@ E @-@ Azam – A Tribute by a son to his father . Hosted by Khan , it includes interviews with Asif 's family and Bollywood stars . Artist M. F. Husain created a series of paintings for the video , in which he re @-@ imagined some memorable scenes . Interested in preserving the film for future generations , Khan noted that his father was originally cast in the film but did not complete it . When asked if Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam should be remade , he retorted : " It is the mother of all films ; mothers cannot be remade " . No sequels have been made , but Maan Gaye Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam ( 2008 ) paid tribute with its title and by including in its plot part of the original stage play ; it received very poor ratings from critics . 
 Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam ranks on the lists of top Indian films , including the 2002 British Film Institute poll of Top 10 Indian Films , and Anupama Chopra 's 2009 list , The Best Bollywood Films . It is also included in CNN @-@ IBN 's 2013 list of the " 100 greatest Indian films of all time " . Rotten Tomatoes has sampled six reviewers and judged them all to be positive , with an average rating of 8 @.@ 5 out of 10 . It is second on Box Office India 's list of Biggest Blockbusters Ever in Hindi Cinema , and was named the greatest Bollywood film of all time by a poll celebrating 100 years of Indian cinema by British Asian weekly newspaper Eastern Eye in July 2013 . It belongs to a small collection of films including Kismet ( 1943 ) , Mother India ( 1957 ) , Sholay ( 1975 ) , and Hum Aapke Hain Koun .. ! ( 1994 ) , that are watched repeatedly throughout India and are viewed as definitive Hindi films of cultural significance . Books and documentaries made about the film include <unk> Warsi 's Mughal @-@ E @-@ Azam – An Epic of Eternal Love , published by Rupa in 2009 . The name Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam has been adopted by businesses , including a restaurant in Goregaon . 
 = Great tit = 
 The great tit ( Parus major ) is a passerine bird in the tit family Paridae . It is a widespread and common species throughout Europe , the Middle East , Central and Northern Asia , and parts of North Africa where it is generally resident in any sort of woodland ; most great tits do not migrate except in extremely harsh winters . Until 2005 this species was lumped with numerous other subspecies . DNA studies have shown these other subspecies to be distinctive from the great tit and these have now been separated as two distinct species , the cinereous tit of southern Asia , and the Japanese tit of East Asia . The great tit remains the most widespread species in the genus Parus . 
 The great tit is a distinctive bird with a black head and neck , prominent white cheeks , olive upperparts and yellow underparts , with some variation amongst the numerous subspecies . It is predominantly insectivorous in the summer , but will consume a wider range of food items in the winter months , including small hibernating bats . Like all tits it is a cavity nester , usually nesting in a hole in a tree . The female lays around 12 eggs and incubates them alone , although both parents raise the chicks . In most years the pair will raise two broods . The nests may be raided by woodpeckers , squirrels and weasels and infested with fleas , and adults may be hunted by sparrowhawks . The great tit has adapted well to human changes in the environment and is a common and familiar bird in urban parks and gardens . The great tit is also an important study species in ornithology . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The great tit was originally described under its current binomial name by Linnaeus in his 18th century work , Systema Naturae . Its scientific name is derived from the Latin <unk> " tit " and maior " larger " . 
 The great tit was formerly treated as ranging from Britain to Japan and south to the islands of Indonesia , with 36 described subspecies ascribed to four main species groups . The major group had 13 subspecies across Europe , temperate Asia and north Africa , the minor group 's nine subspecies occurred from southeast Russia and Japan into northern southeast Asia and the 11 subspecies in the cinereus group were found from Iran across south Asia to Indonesia . The three bokharensis subspecies were often treated as a separate species , Parus bokharensis , the Turkestan tit . This form was once thought to form a ring species around the Tibetan Plateau , with gene flow throughout the subspecies , but this theory was abandoned when sequences of mitochondrial DNA were examined , finding that the four groups were distinct ( monophyletic ) and that the hybridisation zones between the groups were the result of secondary contact after a temporary period of isolation . 
 A study published in 2005 confirmed that the major group was distinct from the cinereus and minor groups and that along with <unk> bokharensis it diverged from these two groups around 1 @.@ 5 million years ago . The divergence between the bokharensis and major groups was estimated to have been about half a million years ago . The study also examined hybrids between representatives of the major and minor groups in the Amur Valley where the two meet . Hybrids were rare , suggesting that there were some reproductive barriers between the two groups . The study recommended that the two eastern groups be split out as new species , the cinereous tit ( Parus cinereus ) , and the Japanese tit ( Parus minor ) , but that the Turkestan tit be lumped in with the great tit . This taxonomy has been followed by some authorities , for example the IOC World Bird List . The Handbook of the Birds of the World volume treating the Parus species went for the more traditional classification , treating the Turkestan tit as a separate species but retaining the Japanese and cinereous tits with the great tit , a move that has not been without criticism . 
 The nominate subspecies of the great tit is the most widespread , its range stretching from the Iberian Peninsula to the Amur Valley and from Scandinavia to the Middle East . The other subspecies have much more restricted distributions , four being restricted to islands and the remainder of the P. m. major subspecies representing former glacial refuge populations . The dominance of a single , morphologically uniform subspecies over such a large area suggests that the nominate race rapidly recolonised a large area after the last glacial epoch . This hypothesis is supported by genetic studies which suggest a geologically recent genetic bottleneck followed by a rapid population expansion . 
 The genus Parus once held most of the species of tit in the family Paridae , but morphological and genetic studies led to the splitting of that large genus in 1998 . The great tit was retained in Parus , which , along with <unk> comprise a lineage of tits known as the " non @-@ hoarders " , with reference to the hoarding behaviour of members of the other clade . The genus Parus is still the largest in the family , but may be split again . Other than those species formerly considered to be subspecies , the great tit 's closest relatives are the white @-@ naped and green @-@ backed tits of southern Asia . Hybrids with tits outside the Parus genus are very rare , but have been recorded with blue tit , coal tit , and probably marsh tit . 
 = = = Subspecies = = = 
 There are currently 15 recognised subspecies of great tit : 
 P. m. newtoni , described by <unk> in 1894 , is found across the British Isles . 
 P. m. major , described by Linnaeus in 1758 , is found throughout much of Europe , Asia Minor , northern and eastern Kazakhstan , southern Siberia and northern Mongolia , as far as the mid @-@ Amur Valley . 
 P. m. excelsus , described by <unk> in 1857 , is found in northwestern Africa . 
 P. m. <unk> , described by Kleinschmidt in 1903 , is found in Portugal , southern Spain , and Corsica .

 P. m. <unk> , was described by Zarudny & Loudon in 1905 , and ranges from east Kazakhstan to extreme north west China and west Mongolia . 
 P. m. <unk> , was described by Buturlin in 1912 , and is found in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan . 
 P. m. <unk> , was described by <unk> in 1954 , and is found in north west China ( north west Xinjiang ) to Mongolia and e Siberia .

 The great tit is large for a tit at 12 @.@ 5 to 14 @.@ 0 cm ( 4 @.@ 9 – 5 @.@ 5 in ) in length , and has a distinctive appearance that makes it easy to recognise . The nominate race P. major major has a bluish @-@ black crown , black neck , throat , bib and head , and white cheeks and ear coverts . The breast is bright lemon @-@ yellow and there is a broad black mid @-@ line stripe running from the bib to vent . There is a dull white spot on the neck turning to greenish yellow on the upper nape . The rest of the nape and back are green tinged with olive . The wing @-@ coverts are green , the rest of the wing is bluish @-@ grey with a white @-@ wing @-@ bar . The tail is bluish grey with white outer tips . The plumage of the female is similar to that of the male except that the colours are overall duller ; the bib is less intensely black , as is the line running down the belly , which is also narrower and sometimes broken . Young birds are like the female , except that they have dull olive @-@ brown napes and necks , greyish rumps , and greyer tails , with less defined white tips . 
 There is some variation in the subspecies . P. m. newtoni is like the nominate race but has a slightly longer bill , the mantle is slightly deeper green , there is less white on the tail tips , and the ventral mid @-@ line stripe is broader on the belly . P. m. <unk> also resembles the nominate form but has duller upperparts , less white in the tail and less yellow in the nape . P. m. mallorcae is like the nominate subspecies , but has a larger bill , greyer @-@ blue upperparts and slightly paler underparts . P. m. <unk> is like P. m. mallorcae except with bluer upperparts and paler underparts . P. m. excelsus is similar to the nominate race but has much brighter green upperparts , bright yellow underparts and no ( or very little ) white on the tail . P. m. aphrodite has darker , more olive @-@ grey upperparts , and the underparts are more yellow to pale cream . P. m. <unk> is similar to P. m. aphrodite but the upperparts are duller and less green , and the underparts are pale yellow . P. m. <unk> resembles the previous two subspecies but has slightly paler upperparts . P. m. blandfordi is like the nominate but with a greyer mantle and scapulars and pale yellow underparts , and P. m. <unk> is intermediate between the nominate and P. m. blandfordi , and lacks white on the tail . The plumage of P. m. bokharensis is much greyer , pale creamy white to washed out grey underparts , a larger white cheep patch , a grey tail , wings , back and nape . It is also slightly smaller , with a smaller bill but longer tail . The situation is similar for the two related subspecies in the Turkestan tit group . P. m. <unk> is like P. m. bokharensis but with a larger bill and darker upperparts . P. m. <unk> is like P. m. bokharensis but with a smaller bill , darker grey on the flanks and a more yellow wash on the juvenile birds . 
 The colour of the male bird 's breast has been shown to correlate with stronger sperm , and is one way that the male demonstrates his reproductive superiority to females . Higher levels of carotenoid increase the intensity of the yellow of the breast its colour , and also enable the sperm to better withstand the onslaught of free radicals . Carotenoids cannot be synthesized by the bird and have to be obtained from food , so a bright colour in a male demonstrates his ability to obtain good nutrition . The width of the male 's ventral stripe , which varies with individual , is selected for by females , with higher quality females apparently selecting males with wider stripes . 
 = = = Voice = = = 
 The great tit is , like other tits , a vocal bird , and has up to 40 types of calls and songs . The calls are generally the same between the sexes , but the male is much more vocal and the female rarely calls . Soft single notes such as " pit " , " <unk> " , or " chit " are used as contact calls . A loud " <unk> " is used by adult males as an alarm or in territorial disputes . One of the most familiar is a " teacher , teacher " , often likened to a squeaky wheelbarrow wheel , which is used in proclaiming ownership of a territory . In former times , English folk considered the " saw @-@ sharpening " call to be a foretelling of rain . There is little geographic variation in calls , but tits from the two south Asian groups recently split from the great tit do not recognise or react to the calls of the temperate great tits . 
 One explanation for the great tit 's wide repertoire is the Beau Geste theory . The eponymous hero of the novel propped dead soldiers against the battlements to give the impression that his fort was better defended than was really the case . Similarly , the multiplicity of calls gives the impression that the tit 's territory is more densely occupied than it actually is . Whether the theory is correct or not , those birds with large vocabularies are socially dominant and breed more successfully . 
 = = Distribution , movements and habitat = = 
 The great tit has a wide distribution across much of Eurasia . It is found across all of Europe except for Iceland and northern Scandinavia , including numerous Mediterranean islands . In North Africa it is found in Morocco , Algeria and Tunisia . It also occurs across the Middle East , and parts of central Asia from northern Iran and Afghanistan to Mongolia , as well as across northern Asia from the Urals as far east as northern China and the Amur Valley . 
 The great tit occupies a range of habitats . It is most commonly found in open deciduous woodland , mixed forests and forest edges . In dense forests , including conifer forests it is usually found in forest clearings . In northern Siberia it is found in boreal taiga . In North Africa it prefers oak forests as well as stands of Atlas cedar and even palm groves . In the east of its range in Siberia , Mongolia and China it favours riverine willow and birch forest . Riverine woodlands of willows , poplars are among the habitats of the Turkestan group in central Asia , as well as low scrubland , oases ; at higher altitudes it occupies habitats ranging from dense deciduous and coniferous forests to open areas with scattered trees . 
 The great tit is generally not migratory . Pairs will usually remain near or in their territory year round , even in northern parts of their range . Young birds will disperse from their parents ' territory , but usually not far . Populations may become irruptive in poor or harsh winters , meaning that groups of up to a thousand birds may unpredictably move from northern Europe to the Baltic , the Netherlands , Britain and even as far as the southern Balkans . 
 The great tit was unsuccessfully introduced into the United States ; birds were set free near Cincinnati , Ohio between 1872 and 1874 but failed to become established . Suggestions that they were an excellent control measure for codling moths nearly led to their introduction to some new areas particularly in the United States of America , however this plan was not implemented . Birds were later introduced to the Almaty Province in what is now Kazakhstan in 1960 – 61 and became established , although their present status is unclear . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 = = = Diet and feeding = = = 
 Great tits are primarily insectivorous in the summer , feeding on insects and spiders which they capture by foliage gleaning . Invertebrate prey that are taken include cockroaches , grasshoppers and crickets , lacewings , earwigs , bugs ( Hemiptera ) , ants , flies ( Diptera ) , caddis flies , beetles , scorpion flies , harvestmen , bees and wasps , snails and woodlice . During the breeding season , the tits prefer to feed protein @-@ rich caterpillars to their young . A study published in 2007 found that great tits helped to reduce caterpillar damage in apple orchards by as much as 50 % . Nestlings also undergo a period in their early development where they are fed a number of spiders , possibly for nutritional reasons . In autumn and winter , when insect prey becomes scarcer , great tits add berries and seeds to their diet . Seeds and fruit usually come from deciduous trees and shrubs , and include the seeds of beech and hazel . Where it is available they will readily take table scraps , peanuts and sunflower seeds from bird tables . In particularly severe winters they may consume 44 % of their body weight in sunflower seeds . They often forage on the ground , particularly in years with high beech mast production . Great tits , along with other tits , will join winter mixed @-@ species foraging flocks . 
 Large food items , such as large seeds or prey , are dealt with by " hold @-@ hammering " , where the item is held with one or both feet and then struck with the bill until it is ready to eat . Using this method , a great tit can get into a hazelnut in about twenty minutes . When feeding young , adults will hammer off the heads off large insects to make them easier to consume , and remove the gut from caterpillars so that the tannins in the gut will not retard the chick 's growth . 
 Great tits combine dietary versatility with a considerable amount of intelligence and the ability to solve problems with insight learning , that is to solve a problem through insight rather than trial and error . In England , great tits learned to break the foil caps of milk bottles delivered at the doorstep of homes to obtain the cream at the top . This behaviour , first noted in 1921 , spread rapidly in the next two decades . In 2009 , great tits were reported killing and eating pipistrelle bats . This is the first time a songbird has been seen to hunt bats . The tits only do this during winter when the bats are hibernating and other food is scarce . They have also been recorded using tools , using a conifer needle in the bill to extract larvae from a hole in a tree . In 2013 , some individual great tits were noted to attack , kill and to some extent eat other small birds at wintertime feeding spots in Finland . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 Great tits are monogamous breeders and establish breeding territories . These territories are established in late January and defence begins in late winter or early spring . Territories are usually reoccupied in successive years , even if one of the pair dies , so long as the brood is raised successfully . Females are likely to disperse to new territories if their nest is predated the previous year . If the pair divorces for some reason then the birds will disperse , with females travelling further than males to establish new territories . Although the great tit is socially monogamous , extra @-@ pair copulations are frequent . One study in Germany found that 40 % of nests contained some offspring fathered by parents other than the breeding male and that 8 @.@ 5 % of all chicks were the result of cuckoldry . 
 Great tits are seasonal breeders . The exact timing of breeding varies by a number of factors , most importantly location . Most breeding occurs between January and September ; in Europe the breeding season usually begins after March . In Israel there are exceptional records of breeding during the months of October to December . The amount of sunlight and daytime temperatures will also affect breeding timing . One study found a strong correlation between the timing of laying and the peak abundance of caterpillar prey , which is in turn correlated to temperature . On an individual level , younger females tend to start laying later than older females . 
 Great tits are cavity nesters , breeding in a hole that is usually inside a tree , although occasionally in a wall or rock face , and they will readily take to nest boxes . The nest inside the cavity is built by the female , and is made of plant fibres , grasses , moss , hair , wool and feathers . The number in the clutch is often very large , as many as 18 , but five to twelve is more common . Clutch size is smaller when birds start laying later , and is also lower when the density of competitors is higher . Second broods tend to have smaller clutches . <unk> also affects clutch size , with great tits on offshore islands laying smaller clutches with larger eggs than mainland birds . The eggs are white with red spots . The female undertakes all incubation duties , and is fed by the male during incubation . The bird is a close sitter , hissing when disturbed . The timing of hatching , which is best synchronised with peak availability of prey , can be manipulated when environmental conditions change after the laying of the first egg by delaying the beginning of incubation , laying more eggs or pausing during incubation . The incubation period is between 12 and 15 days . 
 The chicks , like those of all tits , are hatched unfeathered and blind . Once feathers begin to erupt , the nestlings are unusual for altricial birds in having plumage coloured with carotenoids similar to their parents ( in most species it is dun @-@ coloured to avoid predation ) . The nape is yellow and attracts the attention of the parents by its ultraviolet reflectance . This may be to make them easier to find in low light , or be a signal of fitness to win the parents ' attention . This patch turns white after the first moult at age two months , and diminishes in size as the bird grows . 
 Chicks are fed by both parents , usually receiving 6 to 7 g ( 0 @.@ 21 – 0 @.@ 25 oz ) of food a day . Both parents provision the chicks with food and aid in nest sanitation by removing faecal packets , with no difference in the feeding effort between the sexes . The nestling period is between 16 and 22 days , with chicks being independent of the parents eight days after fledging . Feeding of the <unk> may continue after independence , lasting up to 25 days in chicks from the first brood , but as long as 50 days in the second brood . Nestlings from second broods have weaker immune systems and body condition than those from first broods , and hence have a lower juvenile survival rate . 
 Inbreeding depression occurs when the offspring produced as a result of a mating between close relatives show reduced fitness . The reduced fitness is generally considered to be a consequence of the increased expression of deleterious recessive alleles in these offspring . In natural populations of P. major , inbreeding is avoided by dispersal of individuals from their birthplace , which reduces the chance of mating with a close relative .

 The Eurasian sparrowhawk is a predator of great tits , with the young from second broods being at higher risk partly because of the hawk 's greater need for food for its own developing young . The nests of great tits are raided by great spotted woodpeckers , particularly when nesting in certain types of nest boxes . Other nest predators include introduced grey squirrels ( in Britain ) and least weasels , which are able to take nesting adults as well . A species of biting louse ( Mallophaga ) described as <unk> <unk> was isolated and described in 1981 from great tits in central Europe . The hen flea Ceratophyllus gallinae is exceedingly common in the nests of blue and great tits . It was originally a specialist tit flea , but the dry , crowded conditions of chicken runs enabled it to flourish with its new host . This flea is preferentially predated by the clown beetle <unk> <unk> , The rove beetle <unk> <unk> also feeds on fleas and their larvae . Although these beetles often remain in deserted nests , they can only breed in the elevated temperatures produced by brooding birds , tits being the preferred hosts .

 The great tit is a popular garden bird due to its acrobatic performances when feeding on nuts or seed . Its willingness to move into nest boxes has made it a valuable study subject in ornithology ; it has been particularly useful as a model for the study of the evolution of various life @-@ history traits , particularly clutch size . A study of a literature database search found 1 @,@ 349 articles relating to Parus major for the period between 1969 and 2002 . 
 The great tit has generally adjusted to human modifications of the environment . It is more common and has better breeding success in areas with undisturbed forest cover , but it has adapted to human modified habitats . It can be very common in urban areas . For example , the breeding population in the city of Sheffield ( a city of half a million people ) has been estimated at 17 @,@ 164 individuals . In adapting to human environments its song has been observed to change in noise @-@ polluted urban environments . In areas with low frequency background noise pollution , the song has a higher frequency than in quieter areas . This tit has expanded its range , moving northwards into Scandinavia and Scotland , and south into Israel and Egypt . The total population is estimated at between 300 – 1 @,@ 100 million birds in a range of 32 @.@ 4 million km2 ( 12 @.@ 5 million sq mi ) . While there have been some localised declines in population in areas with poorer quality habitats , its large range and high numbers mean that the great tit is not considered to be threatened , and it is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List . 
 = Washington State Route 530 = 
 State Route 530 ( SR 530 ) is a Washington state highway in Snohomish and Skagit counties . The 50 @.@ 52 @-@ mile ( 81 @.@ 30 km ) long route runs northeast from an interchange with Interstate 5 ( I @-@ 5 ) southwest of Arlington past SR 9 in Arlington and Darrington to end at SR 20 in Rockport . Serving the communities of Arlington , Arlington Heights , Oso , Darrington and Rockport , the roadway travels parallel to a fork of the Stillaguamish River from Arlington to Darrington , the Sauk River from Darrington to Rockport and a BNSF Railway route that extends from Arlington to Cicero , located west of Oso . 
 The first segment of SR 530 to appear on a map was a road extending from Arlington to Oso in 1899 . The first segment to be state @-@ maintained was Secondary State Highway 1E ( SSH 1E ) , which ran from Conway to Arlington . SSH 1E was extended to Darrington in 1957 and later renumbered to SR 530 in 1964 ; the road was extended to Rockport in 1983 and later the route from Conway to I @-@ 5 was removed from the system in 1991 . Since 1991 , minor construction projects arranged by the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) have improved the roadway and WSDOT plans to realign the highway near the Sauk River .

 State Route 530 ( SR 530 ) begins at a diamond interchange with Interstate 5 ( I @-@ 5 ) southwest of Arlington , 0 @.@ 78 miles ( 1 @.@ 26 km ) south of where I @-@ 5 crosses the Stillaguamish River . After the interchange , the highway had a daily average of 22 @,@ 000 motorists in 2007 , which is significantly higher than in 1970 when 5 @,@ 400 motorists used the stretch of road . From the interchange , the highway is named Jackson Road and travels east to intersect Smokey Point Boulevard , which travels south to Smokey Point and was once U.S. Route 99 , a major north – south road . After passing the intersection , the roadway continues east through a primarily rural area until it curves north and later east to enter Arlington city limits . Within Arlington , SR 530 intersects SR 9 , another north – south highway that the road has a brief concurrency with . After the concurrency , the highway is named Burke Avenue and intersects West Avenue , which was SR 9 before it was realigned to the current western alignment . The roadway becomes the Arlington – Darrington Road after bridging the Stillaguamish River and passing the Twin Rivers County Park , the road turns northeast into Arlington Heights . 
 In Trafton , which is located in Arlington Heights , SR 530 passes a residential area and a road that leads to the Jim Creek Naval Radio Station , a United States Navy facility . After leaving Trafton , the road crosses a railroad track used by the BNSF Railway before crossing the North Fork of the Stillaguamish River in Cicero . The highway crosses the tracks and the Stillaguamish River fork near Oso to continue east past several communities . The roadway turns southeast and passes the Darrington Municipal Airport to enter Darrington town limits . Once in Darrington , SR 530 becomes Seeman Street and goes east to an intersection with Seeman Street and <unk> Street . <unk> Street is also named the Mountain Loop Highway , which travels southwest to connect National Forest Route 20 and SR 92 in Granite Falls . At the intersection , the road turns north and leaves Darrington to follow the Sauk River . Outside of Darrington , the roadway travels north , briefly entering the boundaries of the Mount Baker National Forest and leaves Snohomish County . After entering Skagit County , SR 530 crosses the Sauk River and heads north to cross the Skagit River and end at an intersection with SR 20 in Rockport .

 From 1964 until 1991 , SR 530 began at an interchange with I @-@ 5 in Conway and traveled southeast to I @-@ 5 again at the current western terminus and then followed the current route . The former routing , now called the Pioneer Highway , followed the Seattle – Vancouver , BC route of the Great Northern Railway served by the International from Conway to Silvana . The former route began at a diamond interchange with I @-@ 5 in Conway , which was also the western terminus of SR 534 . From the interchange , the roadway traveled west to Fir Island Road , which travels west across the South Fork of the Skagit River to Fir Island . The road then turned south to parallel railroad tracks owned by the Great Northern Railway and also parallel the South Fork of the Skagit River . At Milltown , SR 530 intersected Milltown Road , which would later interchange with I @-@ 5 to the east . South of Milltown and west of Lake Ketchum , the route crossed into Snohomish County . After crossing into Snohomish County and passing Lake Ketchum , SR 530 traveled south to a junction with the Old Pacific Highway and turned southeast into North Stanwood . The highway exited North Stanwood to enter Stanwood , where it intersected SR 532 . The roadway curved southeast and passed Sunday Lake , some residential areas and Norman before entering Silvana . After Silvana , the road continued southeast and later eastward to interchange with I @-@ 5 . 
 = = History = = 
 The current route of SR 530 first appeared on a map around 1899 , when a road following the North Fork of the Stillaguamish River ended east of Oso . A map published in 1911 showed a road traveling from Conway southeast past Stanwood and Arlington towards Oso and Darrington . The first state @-@ maintained highway that used a section of the current roadway was Secondary State Highway 1E ( SSH 1E ) , which was established in 1937 during the creation of the Primary and secondary highways ; SSH 1E ran from an intersection with Primary State Highway 1 ( PSH 1 ) in Conway south to what would become SSH 1Y in 1945 in Stanwood ( then called East Stanwood ) and east past PSH 1 again to SSH 1A in Arlington . SSH 1E was later extended in 1957 past SSH 1A in Arlington to the Mountain Loop Highway in Darrington , which had been finished by late 1941 . 
 During the 1964 highway renumbering , SSH 1E became SR 530 , SSH 1A became SR 9 and SSH 1Y became SR 532 ; from 1964 until 1983 , SR 530 was 49 @.@ 07 miles ( 78 @.@ 97 km ) long . On December 26 , 1980 , SR 530 was closed between Stanwood and Silvana due to a flood that caused the Stillaguamish River to overflow from its banks , which the highway parallels . The roadway was extended 18 @.@ 64 miles ( 30 @.@ 00 km ) north from Darrington to SR 20 in Rockport , making the highway a total of 68 @.@ 34 miles ( 109 @.@ 98 km ) and both termini being in Skagit County . SR 530 was later shortened 16 @.@ 98 miles ( 27 @.@ 33 km ) , moving the western terminus to an interchange with I @-@ 5 southwest of Arlington . 
 Since being shortened , five minor construction projects , arranged by the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) , have occurred . The confluence of the Sauk and Suiattle rivers have eroded the riverbank that supports the road north of Darrington . Wilder Construction Inc. of Bellingham was hired by WSDOT to stabilize the riverbank to prevent the highway collapsing into the river . The project was completed in December 2007 and took place between Darrington and Rockport . A temporary rock wall was also constructed to protect SR 530 and will be removed once WSDOT <unk> the highway north of Darrington , which is expected to be completed after 2011 . 
 On March 22 , 2014 , a three @-@ mile section of SR 530 in northern Snohomish County , roughly midway between Darrington and Arlington , was completely blocked by the Oso landslide . The highway was cleared enough by May 31 to open one lane of escorted traffic . Because the highway was badly damaged , and because the topography of the area had been altered by the landslide , WSDOT decided to elevate that section of the highway when it was rebuilt . As of July 27 , 2014 , the first of four stages in rebuilding the highway had been completed . The new roadway was opened September 22 , and the project is expected to be finished in early October 2014 .

 = Philippines = 
 The Philippines ( / <unk> / ; Filipino : Pilipinas [ <unk> ] ) , officially the Republic of the Philippines ( Filipino : Republika ng Pilipinas ) , is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean . It consists of about 7 @,@ 641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south : Luzon , Visayas , and Mindanao . The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City , both part of Metro Manila . 
 The Philippines ' location on the Pacific Ring of Fire and close to the equator makes the Philippines prone to earthquakes and typhoons , but also endows it with abundant natural resources and some of the world 's greatest biodiversity . The Philippines has an area of approximately 300 @,@ 000 square kilometers ( 115 @,@ 831 sq mi ) , and a population of more than 100 million with faster growth than any other east Asian country . It is the seventh @-@ most populated country in Asia and the 12th most populated country in the world . An additional 12 million Filipinos live overseas , comprising one of the world 's largest diasporas . Multiple ethnicities and cultures are found throughout the islands . In prehistoric times , Negritos were some of the archipelago 's earliest inhabitants . They were followed by successive waves of Austronesian peoples . Exchanges with Chinese , Malay , Indian , and Islamic states occurred . Then , various nations were established under the rule of Datus , Rajahs , Sultans or <unk> . 
 The arrival of Ferdinand Magellan in <unk> , Eastern Samar in 1521 marked the beginning of Hispanic colonization . In 1543 , Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos named the archipelago Las Islas Filipinas in honor of Philip II of Spain . With the arrival of Miguel López de Legazpi from Mexico City , in 1565 , the first Hispanic settlement in the archipelago was established . The Philippines became part of the Spanish Empire for more than 300 years . This resulted in Roman Catholicism becoming the dominant religion . During this time , Manila became the western hub of the trans @-@ Pacific trade connecting Asia with Acapulco in the Americas using Manila galleons . 
 As the 19th century gave way to the 20th , there followed in quick succession the Philippine Revolution , which spawned the short @-@ lived First Philippine Republic , followed by the bloody Philippine – American War of conquest by US military force . Aside from the period of Japanese occupation , the United States retained sovereignty over the islands until after World War II , when the Philippines was recognized as an independent nation . Since then , the Philippines has often had a tumultuous experience with democracy , which included the overthrow of a dictatorship by a non @-@ violent revolution . 
 The nation 's large population and economic potential have led it to be classified as a middle power . It is a founding member of the United Nations , World Trade Organization , Association of Southeast Asian Nations , the Asia @-@ Pacific Economic Cooperation forum , and the East Asia Summit . It also hosts the headquarters of the Asian Development Bank . The Philippines is considered to be an emerging market and a newly industrialized country , which has an economy transitioning from being one based on agriculture to one based more on services and manufacturing . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The Philippines was named in honor of King Philip II of Spain . Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos during his expedition in 1542 named the islands of Leyte and Samar <unk> after the then Prince of Asturias . Eventually the name Las Islas Filipinas would be used to cover all the islands of the archipelago . Before that became commonplace , other names such as Islas del <unk> ( Islands of the West ) and Magellan 's name for the islands San Lázaro were also used by the Spanish to refer to the islands . 
 The official name of the Philippines has changed several times in the course of its history . During the Philippine Revolution , the Malolos Congress proclaimed the establishment of the República Filipina or the Philippine Republic . From the period of the Spanish – American War ( 1898 ) and the Philippine – American War ( 1899 – 1902 ) until the Commonwealth period ( 1935 – 46 ) , American colonial authorities referred to the country as the Philippine Islands , a translation of the Spanish name . From the 1898 Treaty of Paris , the name Philippines began to appear and it has since become the country 's common name . Since the end of World War II , the official name of the country has been the Republic of the Philippines .

 The metatarsal of the Callao Man , reliably dated by uranium @-@ series dating to 67 @,@ 000 years ago is the oldest human remnant found in the archipelago to date . This distinction previously belonged to the <unk> Man of Palawan , carbon @-@ dated to around 26 @,@ 500 years ago . Negritos were also among the archipelago 's earliest inhabitants , but their first settlement in the Philippines has not been reliably dated . 
 There are several opposing theories regarding the origins of ancient Filipinos . F. Landa <unk> theorizes that the ancestors of the Filipinos evolved locally . Wilhelm Solheim 's Island Origin Theory postulates that the <unk> of the archipelago transpired via trade networks originating in the Sundaland area around 48 @,@ 000 to 5000 BC rather than by wide @-@ scale migration . The Austronesian Expansion Theory postulates that Malayo @-@ Polynesians coming from Taiwan began migrating to the Philippines around 4000 BC , displacing earlier arrivals . 
 The most widely accepted theory , based on linguistic and archeological evidence , is the " Out @-@ of @-@ Taiwan " model , which hypothesizes that Austronesians from Taiwan , who were themselves descended from the neolithic civilizations of the Yangtze river such as the <unk> culture , began migrating to the Philippines around 4000 BC , displacing earlier arrivals . During the neolithic period , a " jade culture " is said to have existed as evidenced by tens of thousands of exquisitely crafted jade artifacts found in the Philippines dated to 2000 BC . 
 The jade is said to have originated nearby in Taiwan and is also found in many other areas in insular and mainland Southeast Asia . These artifacts are said to be evidence of long range communication between prehistoric Southeast Asian societies . By 1000 BC the inhabitants of the archipelago had developed into four kinds of social groups : hunter @-@ gatherer tribes , warrior societies , highland <unk> , and port principalities . 
 = = = Precolonial epoch = = = 
 Some of the societies scattered in the islands of what would later become the Philippines remained isolated but many evolved into states that developed substantial trade and contacts with the peoples of eastern , southern and southeastern Asia ; including those from Brunei , China , India , Indonesia , Malaysia and Japan as well as other Austronesian islands . 
 The first millennium saw the rise of the port principalities and their growth into maritime states composed of autonomous barangays independent of or allied with larger nations which were either Malay thalassocracies led by Datus , tributary states to China ruled by Huangs or Indianized kingdoms governed by Rajahs . 
 The <unk> of Madja @-@ as was founded following a civil war in collapsing Srivijaya , wherein loyalists of the Malay datus of Srivijaya defied the invading Chola Dynasty and its puppet @-@ Rajah , called <unk> , and set up a guerrilla @-@ state in the islands of the Visayas . Its founding <unk> , <unk> , had purchased land for his new realms from the aboriginal Ati hero , <unk> . 
 Madja @-@ as was founded on Panay island ( named after the destroyed state of <unk> allied under Srivijaya which was located in Sumatra ) . Afterwards , the people of Madja @-@ as often raided the port cities of southern China and warred with the Chinese navy . 
 The Rajahnate of Cebu was a neighbor of Madja @-@ as in the Visayas led by <unk> Sri <unk> , a monarch with partial Tamil descent . This state grew wealthy by making use of the inter @-@ island shipping routes within the archipelago . 
 Meanwhile , the Rajahnate of Butuan in northeastern Mindanao attained prominence under the rule of Rajah Sri Bata <unk> , who was from a Buddhist ruling @-@ class governing a Hindu nation . This state became powerful due to the local goldsmith industry and also maintained commercial ties and a diplomatic rivalry with the Champa civilization . Both the <unk> of Butuan and Cebu maintained contact and traded with Kutai , a Hindu country in south Borneo established by Indian traders . 
 The <unk> of Ma @-@ i centered in Mindoro , ruled by Huang Gat @-@ sa @-@ <unk> , was noted for its trust @-@ worthiness in trade . 
 In northern Luzon , the <unk> of Pangasinan under Huang <unk> , exported horses and silver to China , the Kingdom of Ryukyu and Japan . 
 In central Luzon , the Kingdom of Tondo was ruled over by the <unk> dynasty and the kingdom grew wealthy via the exclusive trading @-@ rights of Chinese goods which they marketed in southeast Asia . This was granted to them by the Ming Dynasty . 
 The 1300s saw the arrival and eventual spread of Islam in the Philippine archipelago . In 1380 , Karim ul ' <unk> and Shari <unk> Hashem Syed Abu Bakr , an Arab trader born in Johore , arrived in Sulu from Malacca and established the Sultanate of Sulu by converting Sulu 's rajah , Rajah <unk> Ali and marrying his daughter . At the end of the 15th century , Shariff Mohammed <unk> of Johor introduced Islam in the island of Mindanao and established the Sultanate of Maguindanao . The sultanate form of government extended further into Lanao . 
 Around this time , the people of Luzon were collectively called <unk> and they rose to prominence by participating in trading ventures and military campaigns in Myanmar , Malacca and East Timor where they were employed as traders and mercenaries . 
 Islam then started to spread out of Mindanao in the south and went into Luzon in the north . Manila in Luzon was <unk> during the reign of Sultan Bolkiah in 1485 to 1521 . This was accomplished because the Bruneian Empire subjugated the Kingdom of Tondo by defeating Datu <unk> and installing the Muslim Rajah , Rajah Sulaiman I to the throne and by establishing the Bruneian puppet @-@ state of the Kingdom of <unk> . Sultan Bolkiah also married Laila <unk> , the daughter of Sulu Sultan Amir Ul @-@ Ombra to expand Brunei 's influence in both Luzon and Mindanao . 
 Nevertheless , states like the animist <unk> , Malay Madja @-@ as , <unk> Ma @-@ i , and Indianized Butuan still maintained their cultures . The rivalries between the datus , <unk> , <unk> , sultans , and <unk> eventually eased Spanish colonization . Furthermore , the islands were sparsely populated due to consistent natural disasters and inter @-@ kingdom conflicts . Therefore , colonization was made easy and the small states of the archipelago quickly became incorporated into the Spanish Empire and were Hispanicized and Christianized . 
 = = = Colonial era = = = 
 In 1521 , Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan 's expedition arrived in the Philippines , claimed the islands for Spain and was then killed at the Battle of <unk> . Colonization began when Spanish explorer Miguel López de Legazpi arrived from Mexico in 1565 and formed the first Hispanic settlements in Cebu . After relocating to Panay island and consolidating a coalition of native Visayan allies and Hispanic soldiers , the Spaniards then captured Islamic Manila , therein they put down the Tondo Conspiracy and exiled the conspirators to Guam and Guerrero . Under Spanish rule , they established Manila as the capital of the Spanish East Indies ( 1571 ) . 
 They also defeated the Chinese @-@ warlord <unk> . In response to the Islamic invasion of the Philippines , the Castilian War was waged against the Sultanate of Brunei and war was also waged against the Sultanate of Ternate and Tidore ( in response to <unk> slaving and piracy against the Butuan Rajahnate and Bohol ) . Fortifications were also set up in Taiwan and the Maluku islands . These were abandoned and the soldiers withdrew back to the Philippines in order to re @-@ concentrate their military forces because of a threatened invasion by the Japan @-@ born Ming @-@ dynasty loyalist , Koxinga , ruler of the stronghold of Tungning . However , the invasion was aborted . Meanwhile , settlers were sent to the Pacific islands of Palau and the Marianas . 
 Spanish rule eventually contributed significantly to bringing political unity to the fragmented states of the archipelago . From 1565 to 1821 , the Philippines was governed as a territory of the Viceroyalty of New Spain and then was administered directly from Madrid after the Mexican War of Independence . The Manila galleons , the largest wooden ships ever built , were constructed in Bicol and Cavite . The Manila galleons were accompanied with a large naval escort as it traveled to and fro Manila and Acapulco . The galleons sailed once or twice a year , between the 16th and 19th centuries . 
 Trade introduced foodstuff such as maize , tomatoes , potatoes , chili peppers , chocolate and pineapples from Mexico and Peru . Within the Philippines , the <unk> of <unk> was established and rule of it was awarded to Sebastian Elcano and his crew , the survivors of the first circumnavigation of the world , as well as his descendants . New towns were also created and Roman Catholic missionaries converted most of the lowland inhabitants to Christianity . They also founded schools , a university , hospitals and churches which were built along the Earthquake Baroque architectural style . The Spanish also decreed the introduction of free public schooling in 1863 . As a result of these policies the Philippine population increased exponentially . 
 During its rule , the Spanish quelled various indigenous revolts . There were several external military challenges from Chinese and Japanese pirates , the Dutch , the English and the Portuguese . Those challengers were fought @-@ off despite the hostile forces having encircled the Philippine archipelago in a crescent formed from Japan to Indonesia . British forces occupied Manila from 1762 to 1764 in an extension of the fighting of the Seven Years ' War . Spanish rule was restored following the 1763 Treaty of Paris . The Spanish – Moro conflict lasted for several hundred years . In the last quarter of the 19th century Spain conquered portions of Mindanao and Moro Muslims in the Sulu Sultanate on Sulu formally recognised Spanish sovereignty . 
 In the 19th century , Philippine ports opened to world trade and shifts started occurring within Philippine society . Many Spaniards born in the Philippines ( criollos ) and those of mixed ancestry ( mestizos ) became wealthy and an influx of Latin American settlers opened up government positions traditionally held by Spaniards born in the Iberian Peninsula ( peninsulares ) . The ideals of revolution also began to spread through the islands . Criollo dissatisfaction resulted in the 1872 Cavite Mutiny that was a precursor to the Philippine Revolution . 
 Revolutionary sentiments were stoked in 1872 after three priests — Mariano Gómez , José Burgos , and Jacinto Zamora ( collectively known as <unk> ) — were accused of sedition by colonial authorities and executed . This would inspire a propaganda movement in Spain , organized by Marcelo H. del Pilar , José Rizal , and Mariano Ponce , lobbying for political reforms in the Philippines . Rizal was eventually executed on December 30 , 1896 , on charges of rebellion . As attempts at reform met with resistance , Andrés Bonifacio in 1892 established the secret society called the Katipunan , who sought independence from Spain through armed revolt . 
 Bonifacio and the Katipunan started the Philippine Revolution in 1896 . A faction of the Katipunan , the <unk> of Cavite province , eventually came to challenge Bonifacio 's position as the leader of the revolution and Emilio Aguinaldo took over . In 1898 , the Spanish – American War began in Cuba and reached the Philippines . Aguinaldo declared Philippine independence from Spain in Kawit , Cavite on June 12 , 1898 , and the First Philippine Republic was established in the <unk> Church in the following year . 
 The islands were ceded by Spain to the United States as a result of the latter 's victory in the Spanish – American War . A compensation of 20 million US dollars was paid to Spain according to the terms of the 1898 Treaty of Paris . As it became increasingly clear the United States would not recognize the nascent First Philippine Republic , the Philippine – American War broke out , the First Republic was defeated , and the archipelago was administered under an Insular Government . The war resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of combatants as well as a couple of hundred thousand civilians , mostly from a cholera epidemic . 
 The Americans then suppressed other rebellious sub @-@ states : mainly , the waning Sultanate of Sulu , as well as the insurgent Tagalog Republic , the Cantonal Republic of Negros in the Visayas , and the Republic of Zamboanga in Mindanao . During this era , a renaissance in Philippine culture occurred , with the expansion of Philippine cinema and literature . In 1935 , the Philippines was granted Commonwealth status with Manuel Quezon as president . He designated a national language and introduced women 's suffrage and land reform . Plans for independence over the next decade were interrupted by World War II when the Japanese Empire invaded and the Second Philippine Republic of José P. Laurel was established as a collaborator state . 
 Many atrocities and war crimes were committed during the war such as the Bataan Death March and the Manila massacre that culminated during the Battle of Manila . In 1944 , Quezon died in exile in the United States and Sergio <unk> succeeded him . The Allied Forces then employed a strategy of island hopping towards the Philippine Archipelago , in the process , retaking territory conquered by Imperial Japan . 
 From mid @-@ 1942 through mid @-@ 1944 , the Filipino guerrilla resistance had been supplied and encouraged by U.S. Navy submarines and a few parachute drops , so that the guerrillas could harass the Japanese Army and take control of the rural jungle and mountainous areas – amounting to about half of the Philippine archipelago . While remaining loyal to the United States , many Filipinos hoped and believed that liberation from the Japanese would bring them freedom and their already @-@ promised independence . 
 Eventually , the largest naval battle in history , according to gross tonnage , the Battle of Leyte Gulf , occurred when the Allied Forces started the liberation of the Philippines from the Japanese Empire . Allied troops defeated the Japanese in 1945 . By the end of the war it is estimated that over a million Filipinos had died .

 On October 24 , 1945 , the Philippines became one of the founding members of the United Nations and the following year , on July 4 , 1946 , it became recognized by the United States as independent , during the presidency of Manuel Roxas . Disgruntled remnants of the communist Hukbalahap continued to roam the countryside but were put down by President Elpidio Quirino 's successor Ramon Magsaysay . Magsaysay 's successor , Carlos P. Garcia initiated the Filipino First Policy , which was continued by Diosdado Macapagal , with celebration of Independence Day moved from July 4 to June 12 , the date of Emilio Aguinaldo 's declaration , while furthering the claim on the eastern part of North Borneo . 
 In 1965 , Macapagal lost the presidential election to Ferdinand Marcos . Early in his presidency he initiated numerous infrastructure projects but was accused of massive corruption and embezzling billions of dollars in public funds . Nearing the end of his term , Marcos declared Martial Law on September 21 , 1972 . This period of his rule was characterized by political repression , censorship , and human rights violations but the US were steadfast in their support . His wife Imelda continued to live a lavish lifestyle as the majority of Filipinos remained in poverty . 
 On August 21 , 1983 , Marcos ' chief rival , opposition leader Benigno Aquino , Jr . , was assassinated on the tarmac at Manila International Airport . Marcos eventually called snap presidential elections in 1986 . Marcos was proclaimed the winner , but the results were widely regarded as fraudulent , leading to the People Power Revolution . Marcos and his allies fled to Hawaii and Aquino 's widow , Corazon Aquino was recognized as president . 
 = = = Contemporary history = = = 
 The return of democracy and government reforms beginning in 1986 were hampered by national debt , government corruption , coup attempts , disasters , a persistent communist insurgency , and a military conflict with Moro separatists . During Corazon Aquino 's administration , U.S. forces withdrew from the Philippines , due the rejection of the U.S. Bases Extension Treaty , and leading to the official transfer of Clark Air Base in November 1991 and Subic Bay to the government in December 1992 . The administration also faced a series of natural disasters , including the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991 . After introducing a constitution that limited presidents to a single term , Aquino did not stand for re @-@ election . 
 Aquino was succeeded by Fidel V. Ramos , who won the Philippine presidential election held in May 1992 . During this period , the economy was known as the " Tiger Economy in Asia " , with an average of 6 % GDP growth rate . However , the political stability and economic improvements , such as the peace agreement with the Moro National Liberation Front in 1996 , were overshadowed by the onset of the 1997 Asian financial crisis . On his Presidency the death penalty was revived in the light of the Rape @-@ slay case of Eileen <unk> and Allan Gomez in 1993 and the first person to be executed is Leo <unk> in 1999 . 
 Ramos ' successor , Joseph Estrada assumed office in June 1998 and managed to regain the economy from − 0 @.@ 6 % growth to 3 @.@ 4 % by 1999 amidst the 1997 Asian financial crisis . The government had announced a war against the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in March 2000 and neutralized the camps including the headquarters of the insurgents . In the middle of ongoing conflict with the Abu Sayyaf , accusations of alleged corruption , and a stalled impeachment process , Estrada 's administration was overthrown by the 2001 EDSA Revolution and succeeded by his Vice President , Gloria Macapagal @-@ Arroyo on January 20 , 2001 . 
 In Arroyo 's 9 @-@ year administration , The economy experienced GDP growth from 4 % in 2002 to 7 % growth in 2007 with the completion of infrastructure projects like the LRT Line 2 in 2004 and managed to avoid the Great Recession . Nevertheless , it was tied with graft and political scandals like the Hello Garci scandal pertaining to the alleged manipulation of votes in the 2004 presidential elections . On November 23 , 2009 , the Maguindanao massacre led to the murder of 34 journalists . 
 Benigno Aquino III won the 2010 national elections and served as the 15th President of the Philippines . He was the third youngest person to be elected president and the first to be a bachelor . , beginning with the 2010 Manila hostage crisis that caused deeply strained relations between Manila and Hong Kong for a time . During the previous years , The Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro was signed on October 15 , 2012 , as the first step of the creation of an autonomous political entity named Bangsamoro . However , territorial disputes in eastern Sabah and the South China Sea have escalated . The economy performed well at 7 @.@ 2 % GDP growth , the second fastest in Asia . Aquino signed the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 , commonly known as K – 12 program in May 15 , 2013 aiming to enhance the educational system in the country . On November 8 , 2013 , Typhoon Yolanda ( Haiyan ) struck and heavily devastated the country , especially in the Visayas . On April 28 , 2014 , when United States President Barack Obama visited the Philippines , the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement , was signed . From January 15 to 19 , 2015 , January 15 to 19 , 2015 , Pope Francis stayed in the Philippines for a series of publicity tours and paid visits to the victims of Typhoon Haiyan ( Yolanda ) . On January 25 , 2015 , 44 members of the Philippine National Police @-@ Special Action Force were killed after a clash took place in <unk> , Maguindanao putting efforts to pass the Bangsamoro Basic Law into law in an impasse . On December 20 , 2015 , Pia <unk> won the Miss Universe 2015 , making her the third Filipino to win the Miss Universe title following Gloria Diaz in 1969 and Margarita Moran in 1973 .

 The Philippines has a democratic government in the form of a constitutional republic with a presidential system . It is governed as a unitary state with the exception of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao ( <unk> ) which is largely free from the national government . There have been attempts to change the government to a federal , unicameral , or parliamentary government since the Ramos administration . 
 The President functions as both head of state and head of government and is the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the armed forces . The president is elected by popular vote for a single six @-@ year term , during which he or she appoints and presides over the cabinet . The bicameral Congress is composed of the Senate , serving as the upper house , with members elected to a six @-@ year term , and the House of Representatives , serving as the lower house , with members elected to a three @-@ year term . 
 Senators are elected at large while the representatives are elected from both legislative districts and through sectoral representation . The judicial power is vested in the Supreme Court , composed of a Chief Justice as its presiding officer and fourteen associate justices , all of whom are appointed by the President from nominations submitted by the Judicial and Bar Council . 
 = = = Foreign relations = = = 
 The Philippines ' international relations are based on trade with other nations and the well @-@ being of the 11 million overseas Filipinos living outside the country . As a founding and active member of the United Nations , the Philippines has been elected several times into the Security Council . Carlos P. Romulo was a former President of the United Nations General Assembly . The country is an active participant in the Human Rights Council as well as in peacekeeping missions , particularly in East Timor . 
 In addition to membership in the United Nations , the Philippines is also a founding and active member of ASEAN ( Association of Southeast Asian Nations ) , an organization designed to strengthen relations and promote economic and cultural growth among states in the Southeast Asian region . It has hosted several summits and is an active contributor to the direction and policies of the bloc . 
 The Philippines values its relations with the United States . It supported the United States during the Cold War and the War on Terror and is a major non @-@ NATO ally . Despite this history of goodwill , controversies related to the presence of the now former U.S. military bases in Subic Bay and Clark and the current Visiting Forces Agreement have flared up from time to time . Japan , the biggest contributor of official development assistance to the country , is thought of as a friend . Although historical tensions still exist on issues such as the plight of comfort women , much of the animosity inspired by memories of World War II has faded . 
 Relations with other nations are generally positive . Shared democratic values ease relations with Western and European countries while similar economic concerns help in relations with other developing countries . Historical ties and cultural similarities also serve as a bridge in relations with Spain . Despite issues such as domestic abuse and war affecting overseas Filipino workers , relations with Middle Eastern countries are friendly as seen in the continuous employment of more than two million overseas Filipinos living there . 
 With communism no longer the threat it once was , once hostile relations in the 1950s between the Philippines and China have improved greatly . Issues involving Taiwan , the Spratly Islands , and concerns of expanding Chinese influence , however , still encourage a degree of caution . Recent foreign policy has been mostly about economic relations with its Southeast Asian and Asia @-@ Pacific neighbors . 
 The Philippines is an active member of the East Asia Summit ( EAS ) , the Asia @-@ Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) , the Latin Union , the Group of 24 , and the Non @-@ Aligned Movement . It is also seeking to strengthen relations with Islamic countries by campaigning for observer status in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation . 
 = = = Military = = = 
 The Armed Forces of the Philippines ( AFP ) are responsible for national security and consist of three branches : the Philippine Air Force , the Philippine Army , and the Philippine Navy ( includes the Marine Corps ) . The Armed Forces of the Philippines are a volunteer force . Civilian security is handled by the Philippine National Police under the Department of the Interior and Local Government ( DILG ) . 
 In the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao , the largest separatist organization , the Moro National Liberation Front , is now engaging the government politically . Other more militant groups like the Moro Islamic Liberation Front , the communist New People 's Army , and the Abu Sayyaf have previously kidnapped foreigners for ransom , particularly on the southern island of Mindanao . Their presence has decreased in recent years due to successful security provided by the Philippine government . At 1 @.@ 1 percent of GDP , the Philippines spent less on its military forces than the regional average . As of 2014 Malaysia and Thailand were estimated to spend 1 @.@ 5 % , China 2 @.@ 1 % , Vietnam 2 @.@ 2 % and South Korea 2 @.@ 6 % . 
 The Philippines has been an ally of the United States since World War II . A mutual defense treaty between the two countries was signed in 1951 . The Philippines supported American policies during the Cold War and participated in the Korean and Vietnam wars . It was a member of the now dissolved SEATO , a group that was intended to serve a role similar to NATO and that included Australia , France , New Zealand , Pakistan , Thailand , the United Kingdom , and the United States . After the start of the War on Terror , the Philippines was part of the coalition that gave support to the United States in Iraq .

 The Philippines is an archipelago composed of about 7 @,@ 500 islands with a total land area , including inland bodies of water , of approximately 300 @,@ 000 square kilometers ( 115 @,@ 831 sq mi ) . Its 36 @,@ 289 kilometers ( 22 @,@ 549 mi ) of coastline makes it the country with the 5th longest coastline in the world . It is located between 116 ° 40 ' , and 126 ° 34 ' E longitude and 4 ° 40 ' and 21 ° 10 ' N latitude and is bordered by the Philippine Sea to the east , the South China Sea to the west , and the Celebes Sea to the south . The island of Borneo is located a few hundred kilometers southwest and Taiwan is located directly to the north . The Moluccas and Sulawesi are located to the south @-@ southwest and Palau is located to the east of the islands . 
 Most of the mountainous islands are covered in tropical rainforest and volcanic in origin . The highest mountain is Mount Apo . It measures up to 2 @,@ 954 meters ( 9 @,@ 692 ft ) above sea level and is located on the island of Mindanao . The Galathea Depth in the Philippine Trench is the deepest point in the country and the third deepest in the world . The trench is located in the Philippine Sea . 
 The longest river is the Cagayan River in northern Luzon . Manila Bay , upon the shore of which the capital city of Manila lies , is connected to Laguna de Bay , the largest lake in the Philippines , by the Pasig River . Subic Bay , the Davao Gulf , and the Moro Gulf are other important bays . The San Juanico Strait separates the islands of Samar and Leyte but it is traversed by the San Juanico Bridge . 
 Situated on the western fringes of the Pacific Ring of Fire , the Philippines experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity . The Benham Plateau to the east in the Philippine Sea is an undersea region active in tectonic subduction . Around 20 earthquakes are registered daily , though most are too weak to be felt . The last major earthquake was the 1990 Luzon earthquake . 
 There are many active volcanoes such as the Mayon Volcano , Mount Pinatubo , and Taal Volcano . The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991 produced the second largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century . Not all notable geographic features are so violent or destructive . A more serene legacy of the geological disturbances is the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River , the area represents a habitat for biodiversity conservation , the site also contains a full mountain @-@ to @-@ the @-@ sea ecosystem and has some of the most important forests in Asia . 
 Due to the volcanic nature of the islands , mineral deposits are abundant . The country is estimated to have the second @-@ largest gold deposits after South Africa and one of the largest copper deposits in the world . It is also rich in nickel , chromite , and zinc . Despite this , poor management , high population density , and environmental consciousness have resulted in these mineral resources remaining largely untapped . Geothermal energy is a product of volcanic activity that the Philippines has harnessed more successfully . The Philippines is the world 's second @-@ biggest geothermal producer behind the United States , with 18 % of the country 's electricity needs being met by geothermal power . 
 = = = Wildlife = = = 
 The Philippines ' rainforests and its extensive coastlines make it home to a diverse range of birds , plants , animals , and sea creatures . It is one of the ten most biologically megadiverse countries . Around 1 @,@ 100 land vertebrate species can be found in the Philippines including over 100 mammal species and 170 bird species not thought to exist elsewhere . The Philippines has among the highest rates of discovery in the world with sixteen new species of mammals discovered in the last ten years . Because of this , the rate of endemism for the Philippines has risen and likely will continue to rise . 
 The Philippines lacks large predators , with the exception of snakes , such as pythons and cobras , saltwater crocodiles and birds of prey , such as the national bird , known as the Philippine eagle , which scientists suggest as the largest eagle in the world . The largest crocodile in captivity , known locally as <unk> , was captured in the southern island of Mindanao . 
 Other native animals include the palm civet cat , the dugong , the cloud rat and the Philippine tarsier associated with Bohol . With an estimated 13 @,@ 500 plant species in the country , 3 @,@ 200 of which are unique to the islands , Philippine rainforests boast an array of flora , including many rare types of orchids and <unk> . 
 Philippine maritime waters encompass as much as 2 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 square kilometers ( 849 @,@ 425 sq mi ) producing unique and diverse marine life , an important part of the Coral Triangle . The total number of corals and marine fish species was estimated at 500 and 2 @,@ 400 respectively . New records and species discoveries continuously increase these numbers underlining the uniqueness of the marine resources in the Philippines . The <unk> Reef in the Sulu Sea was declared a World Heritage Site in 1993 . Philippine waters also sustain the cultivation of pearls , crabs , and seaweeds . 
 Deforestation , often the result of illegal logging , is an acute problem in the Philippines . Forest cover declined from 70 % of the Philippines 's total land area in 1900 to about 18 @.@ 3 % in 1999 . Many species are endangered and scientists say that Southeast Asia , which the Philippines is part of , faces a catastrophic extinction rate of 20 % by the end of the 21st century . According to Conservation International , " the country is one of the few nations that is , in its entirety , both a hotspot and a <unk> country , placing it among the top priority hotspots for global conservation .

 The Philippines has a tropical maritime climate that is usually hot and humid . There are three seasons : tag @-@ init or tag @-@ <unk> , the hot dry season or summer from March to May ; tag @-@ <unk> , the rainy season from June to November ; and tag @-@ <unk> , the cool dry season from December to February . The southwest monsoon ( from May to October ) is known as the <unk> , and the dry winds of the northeast monsoon ( from November to April ) , the <unk> . Temperatures usually range from 21 ° C ( 70 ° F ) to 32 ° C ( 90 ° F ) although it can get cooler or hotter depending on the season . The coolest month is January ; the warmest is May . 
 The average yearly temperature is around 26 @.@ 6 ° C ( 79 @.@ 9 ° F ) . In considering temperature , location in terms of latitude and longitude is not a significant factor . Whether in the extreme north , south , east , or west of the country , temperatures at sea level tend to be in the same range . Altitude usually has more of an impact . The average annual temperature of Baguio at an elevation of 1 @,@ 500 meters ( 4 @,@ 900 ft ) above sea level is 18 @.@ 3 ° C ( 64 @.@ 9 ° F ) , making it a popular destination during hot summers . 
 Sitting astride the typhoon belt , most of the islands experience annual torrential rains and thunderstorms from July to October , with around nineteen typhoons entering the Philippine area of responsibility in a typical year and eight or nine making landfall . Annual rainfall measures as much as 5 @,@ 000 millimeters ( 200 in ) in the mountainous east coast section but less than 1 @,@ 000 millimeters ( 39 in ) in some of the sheltered valleys . The wettest known tropical cyclone to impact the archipelago was the July 1911 cyclone , which dropped over 1 @,@ 168 millimeters ( 46 @.@ 0 in ) of rainfall within a 24 @-@ hour period in Baguio . <unk> is the local term for a tropical cyclone in the Philippines .

 The Philippine economy is the 39th largest in the world , with an estimated 2016 gross domestic product ( nominal ) of $ 369 @.@ 188 billion . Primary exports include semiconductors and electronic products , transport equipment , garments , copper products , petroleum products , coconut oil , and fruits . Major trading partners include the United States , Japan , China , Singapore , South Korea , the Netherlands , Hong Kong , Germany , Taiwan , and Thailand . Its unit of currency is the Philippine peso ( ₱ or PHP ) . 
 A newly industrialized country , the Philippine economy has been transitioning from one based upon agriculture to an economy with more emphasis upon services and manufacturing . Of the country 's total labor force of around 40 @.@ 813 Million , the agricultural sector employs 30 % of the labor force , and accounts for 14 % of GDP . The industrial sector employs around 14 % of the workforce and accounts for 30 % of GDP . Meanwhile , the 47 % of workers involved in the services sector are responsible for 56 % of GDP . 
 The unemployment rate as of 14 December 2014 , stands at 6 @.@ 0 % . Meanwhile , due to lower charges in basic necessities , the inflation rate eases to 3 @.@ 7 % in November . Gross international reserves as of October 2013 are $ 83 @.@ 201 billion . The Debt @-@ to @-@ GDP ratio continues to decline to 38 @.@ 1 % as of March 2014 from a record high of 78 % in 2004 . The country is a net importer but it is also a creditor nation . 
 After World War II , the Philippines was for a time regarded as the second wealthiest in East Asia , next only to Japan . In the 1960s its economic performance started being overtaken . The economy stagnated under the dictatorship of President Ferdinand Marcos as the regime spawned economic mismanagement and political volatility . The country suffered from slow economic growth and bouts of economic recession . Only in the 1990s with a program of economic liberalization did the economy begin to recover . 
 The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis affected the economy , resulting in a lingering decline of the value of the peso and falls in the stock market . The extent it was affected initially was not as severe as that of some of its Asian neighbors . This was largely due to the fiscal conservatism of the government , partly as a result of decades of monitoring and fiscal supervision from the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , in comparison to the massive spending of its neighbors on the rapid acceleration of economic growth . There have been signs of progress since . In 2004 , the economy experienced 6 @.@ 4 % GDP growth and 7 @.@ 1 % in 2007 , its fastest pace of growth in three decades . Average annual GDP growth per capita for the period 1966 – 2007 still stands at 1 @.@ 45 % in comparison to an average of 5 @.@ 96 % for the East Asia and the Pacific region as a whole . The daily income for 45 % of the population of the Philippines remains less than $ 2 . 
 The economy is heavily reliant upon remittances from overseas <unk> , which surpass foreign direct investment as a source of foreign currency . <unk> peaked in 2010 at 10 @.@ 4 % of the national GDP , and were 8 @.@ 6 % in 2012 and in 2014 , Philippines total worth of foreign exchange remittances was US $ 28 billion . Regional development is uneven , with Luzon – Metro Manila in particular – gaining most of the new economic growth at the expense of the other regions , although the government has taken steps to distribute economic growth by promoting investment in other areas of the country . Despite constraints , service industries such as tourism and business process outsourcing have been identified as areas with some of the best opportunities for growth for the country . 
 Goldman Sachs includes the country in its list of the " Next Eleven " economies but China and India have emerged as major economic competitors . Goldman Sachs estimates that by the year 2050 , it will be the 20th largest economy in the world . HSBC also projects the Philippine economy to become the 16th largest economy in the world , 5th largest economy in Asia and the largest economy in the South East Asian region by 2050 . The Philippines is a member of the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund , the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , the Asian Development Bank which is headquartered in Mandaluyong , the Colombo Plan , the G @-@ 77 and the G @-@ 24 among other groups and institutions . 
 = = = Transportation = = = 
 The transportation infrastructure in the Philippines is relatively underdeveloped . This is partly due to the mountainous terrain and the scattered geography of the islands , but also the result of consistently low investment in infrastructure by successive governments . In 2013 , about 3 % of national GDP went towards infrastructure development - much lower than many of its neighbors . There are 213 @,@ 151 kilometers ( 132 @,@ 446 mi ) of roads in the Philippines , with only 25 @.@ 56 % of roads paved . 
 Under President Benigno Aquino III 's administration , various projects were initiated in an attempt to improve the country 's infrastructure and transportation systems . Buses , jeepneys , taxis , and motorized tricycles are commonly available in major cities and towns . In 2007 , there were about 5 @.@ 53 million registered motor vehicles with registrations increasing at an average annual rate of 4 @.@ 55 % . 
 The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines manages airports and implementation of policies regarding safe air travel with 85 public airports currently operational . Ninoy Aquino International Airport ( NAIA ) serves the Greater Manila Area together with Clark International Airport . Philippine Airlines , Asia 's oldest commercial airline still operating under its original name , and Cebu Pacific , the leading low @-@ cost airline , are the major airlines serving most domestic and international destinations . 
 Expressways and highways are mostly located on the island of Luzon including the Pan @-@ Philippine Highway , connecting the islands of Luzon , Samar , Leyte , and Mindanao , the North Luzon Expressway , South Luzon Expressway , and the Subic – Clark – Tarlac Expressway . 
 Rail transport in the Philippines only plays a role in transporting passengers within Metro Manila . This area is served by three rapid transit lines : LRT @-@ 1 , and LRT @-@ 2 and MRT @-@ 3 . In the past , railways served major parts of Luzon , and railroad services were available on the islands of Cebu and Negros . Railways were also used for agricultural purposes , especially in tobacco and sugar cane production . Rail freight transportation is currently almost non @-@ existent . A few transportation systems are currently under development : DOST @-@ <unk> and UP are implementing pre @-@ feasibility studies on Automated <unk> Transit . A so @-@ called Hybrid Electric Road Train which is a long bi @-@ articulated bus , was also being tested as of 2015 . 
 As an archipelago , inter @-@ island travel using watercraft is often necessary . The busiest seaports are Manila , Batangas , Subic , Cebu , Iloilo , Davao , Cagayan de Oro , and Zamboanga . <unk> Travel and <unk> Lines serve Manila , with links to various cities and towns through passenger vessels . The 919 @-@ kilometer ( 571 mi ) Strong Republic Nautical Highway ( <unk> ) , an integrated set of highway segments and ferry routes covering 17 cities was established in 2003 . The Pasig River Ferry Service serves the major rivers in Metro Manila , including the Pasig River and Marikina River having numerous stops in Manila , Makati , Mandaluyong , Pasig and Marikina .

The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company commonly known as PLDT is the leading telecommunications provider . It is also the largest company in the country . 
 The National Telecommunications Commission is the agency responsible for the supervision , adjudication and control over all telecommunications services throughout the country . There are approximately 383 AM and 659 FM radio stations and 297 television and 873 cable television stations . On March 29 , 1994 , the country went live on the Internet via a 64 kbit / s connection from a router serviced by PLDT to a Sprint router in California .

 Among the achievements of the government in the Philippines are a high access to an improved water source of 92 % in 2010 ; the creation of financially sustainable water service providers ( " Water Districts " ) in small and medium towns with the continuous long @-@ term support of a national agency ( the " Local Water Utilities Administration " <unk> ) ; and the improvement of access , service quality and efficiency in Manila through two high @-@ <unk> water concessions awarded in 1997 . 
 The challenges include limited access to sanitation services , high pollution of water resources , often poor drinking water quality and poor service quality , a fragmentation of executive functions at the national level among numerous agencies , and a fragmentation of service provision at the local level into many small service providers . 
 In 2015 it was reported by the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation by WHO and UNICEF that 74 % of the population had access to improved sanitation and that " good progress " had been made . The access to improved sanitation was reported to be similar for the urban and rural population .

There are also indigenous peoples like the <unk> , the <unk> , the Mangyan , the Bajau , and the tribes of Palawan . 
 Filipinos generally belong to several Asian ethnic groups classified linguistically as part of the Austronesian or Malayo @-@ Polynesian speaking people . It is believed that thousands of years ago Austronesian @-@ speaking Taiwanese aborigines migrated to the Philippines from Taiwan , bringing with them knowledge of agriculture and ocean @-@ sailing , eventually displacing the earlier Negrito groups of the islands . Negritos , such as the <unk> and the Ati , are considered among the earliest inhabitants of the islands . 
 Being at the crossroads of the West and East , the Philippines is also home to migrants from places as diverse as China , Spain , Mexico , United States , India , South Korea , and Japan . Two important non @-@ indigenous minorities are the Chinese and the Spaniards . 
 The Chinese , mostly descendants of immigrants from Fujian , China after 1898 , number 2 million , although there are an estimated 18 to 27 million Filipinos who have partial Chinese ancestry , stemming from precolonial and colonial Chinese migrants . Intermarriage between the groups is evident in the major cities and urban areas . 
 At least one @-@ third of the population of Luzon as well as a few old settlements in the Visayas and Zamboanga City at Mindanao , have partial Hispanic ancestry ( from varying points of origin and ranging from Latin America to Spain ) . Recent genetic studies confirm this partial European and Latin @-@ American ancestry . 
 Other important non @-@ indigenous minorities include Indians , Anglo @-@ Americans , Britons , and Japanese people . Descendants of mixed couples are known as mestizos .

 Ethnologue lists 186 individual languages in the Philippines , 182 of which are living languages , while 4 no longer have any known speakers . Most native languages are part of the Philippine branch of the Malayo @-@ Polynesian languages , which is itself a branch of the Austronesian language family . The only language not classified as an Austronesian language is Chavacano which is a creole language of Mexican Spanish and is classified as a Romance language . 
 Filipino and English are the official languages of the country . Filipino is a standardized version of Tagalog , spoken mainly in Metro Manila and other urban regions . Both Filipino and English are used in government , education , print , broadcast media , and business . However , most people outside cities do not speak much English . In most towns , the local indigenous language is spoken . The Philippine constitution provides for the promotion of Spanish and Arabic on a voluntary and optional basis , although neither are used on as wide a scale as in the past . Spanish , which was widely used as a lingua franca in the late nineteenth century , has since declined greatly in use , but is experiencing revival due to government promotions , while Arabic is mainly used in Islamic schools in Mindanao . However , Spanish loanwords are still present today in many of the indigenous Philippine languages . 
 Nineteen regional languages act as auxiliary official languages used as mediums of instruction : Aklanon , Bikol , Cebuano , Chavacano , Hiligaynon , <unk> , Ilocano , Ivatan , Kapampangan , <unk> @-@ a , Maguindanao , Maranao , Pangasinan , Sambal , <unk> , Tagalog , Tausug , Waray , and Yakan . Other indigenous languages such as , <unk> , Ifugao , <unk> , Kalinga , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Romblomanon , Malay , and several Visayan languages are prevalent in their respective provinces . 
 Languages not indigenous to the islands are also taught in select schools . Mandarin is used in Chinese schools catering to the Chinese Filipino community . Islamic schools in Mindanao teach Modern Standard Arabic in their curriculum . French , German , Japanese , Korean , Spanish are taught with the help of foreign linguistic institutions . The Department of Education began teaching the Malay languages of Indonesian and Malaysian in 2013 .

 The Philippines is an officially secular state , although Christianity is the dominant faith . Catholic Church data from 2015 found that about 82 @.@ 9 % of the population professed Catholicism . Around 37 % regularly attend Mass and 29 % identify as very religious . Protestants are 1 @.@ 8 % of the total population . The Philippine Independent Church is a notable independent Catholic denomination . Iglesia ni Cristo is a notable Restorationist denomination in the country . 
 Islam is the second largest religion . The Muslim population of the Philippines was reported as about 5 % of the total population according to census returns in 2000 and as of 2011 , and as 11 % in a 2012 report by the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos . The majority of Muslims live in the Bangsamoro region . Most practice Sunni Islam under the Shafi 'i school . 
 An unknown number of Filipinos are irreligious but may form as much as 10 % of the population . Catholicism 's historic dominance is steadily declining , with about 9 % of adherents considering leaving their church . 
 An estimated 2 % of the total population practice Philippine traditional religions , whose practices and folk beliefs are often syncretized with Christianity and Islam . Buddhism is practiced by around 2 % of the population , and is concentrated among Filipinos of Chinese descent . The remaining population is divided between a number of religious groups , including Hindus , Jews , and Baha 'is .

The Commission on Higher Education ( CHED ) supervises the college and graduate academic programs and degrees as well as regulate standards in higher education . 
 In 2004 , <unk> were mainstreamed in 16 regions nationwide , mainly in Muslim areas in Mindanao under the auspices and program of the Department of Education . Public universities are all non @-@ sectarian entities , and are further classified as State Universities and Colleges ( <unk> ) or Local Colleges and Universities ( <unk> ) . The University of the Philippines is the national university of the Philippines . 
 = = Culture = = 
 Philippine culture is a combination of Eastern and Western cultures . The Philippines exhibits aspects found in other Asian countries with a Malay heritage , yet its culture also displays a significant number of Spanish and American influences . 
 Traditional festivities known as barrio fiestas ( district festivals ) to commemorate the feast days of patron saints are common . These community celebrations are times for feasting , music , and dancing and the <unk> and Sinulog festivals are a couple of the most well @-@ known . 
 Some traditions , however , are changing or gradually being forgotten due to modernization . The <unk> Philippine National Folk Dance Company has been lauded for preserving many of the various traditional folk dances found throughout the Philippines . They are famed for their iconic performances of Philippine dances such as the <unk> and <unk> that both feature clashing bamboo poles . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Vigan in Ilocos Sur is also known for the many Hispanic @-@ style houses and buildings preserved there . 
 One of the most visible Hispanic legacies is the prevalence of Spanish names and surnames among Filipinos ; a Spanish name and surname , however , does not necessarily denote Spanish ancestry . This peculiarity , unique among the people of Asia , came as a result of a colonial edict by Governor @-@ General Narciso <unk> y <unk> , which ordered the systematic distribution of family names and implementation of Hispanic nomenclature on the population . The names of many streets , towns , and provinces are also in Spanish . Spanish architecture has left an imprint in the Philippines in the way many towns were designed around a central square or plaza mayor , but many of the buildings bearing its influence were demolished during World War II . Some examples remain , mainly among the country 's churches , government buildings , and universities . Four Philippine baroque churches are included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites : the San Agustín Church in Manila , the <unk> Church in Ilocos Norte , the Nuestra Señora de la Asunción ( Santa María ) Church in Ilocos Sur , and the Santo Tomás de Villanueva Church in Iloilo . 
 In Iloilo , a lot of the colonial edifices constructed during the American occupation in the country can still be seen . Commercial buildings , houses and churches in that era are abundant in the city and especially in Calle Real . 
 However , certain areas of the country like Batanes have slight differences as both Spanish and Filipino ways of life assimilated differently due to the climate there and limestone and coral were used as building materials . <unk> or Ivatan castles were the primary shelter of the people prior to the Spanish conquest of the whole Philippines . 
 The common use of the English language is an example of the American impact on Philippine society . It has contributed to the ready acceptance and influence of American pop cultural trends . This affinity is seen in Filipinos ' love of fast food and American film and music . Fast food outlets are found on many street corners . American global fast food chain stalwarts have entered the market , but local fast food chains like Goldilocks and most notably <unk> , the leading fast food chain in the country , have emerged and compete successfully against their foreign rivals . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Philippine music has evolved rapidly due to the different influences stemming from colonialism under other countries . Before the Spanish conquest of the islands , most music was reminiscent of , or heavily influenced by , nature . Some examples of this tribal music is Koyu No <unk> of the T <unk> and Ambo Hato of the Ifugao . This genre is often accompanied by gong music and one well known instrument is the Kulintang . 
 During the Spanish era Rondalya music , where traditional string orchestra mandolin type instruments were used , was widespread . In the Philippines , Rondalya refers to any group of stringed instruments that are played using a plectrum or pick . Filipino instruments are made from indigenous Philippine wood ; <unk> , or picks , are made from tortoise @-@ shell . Other stringed instruments composing the standard Filipino <unk> are the 14 @-@ string <unk> found only in the Philippines , the laúd , the <unk> , the Twelve @-@ string guitar , the Ukulele , the bajo de <unk> or double bass , the <unk> mexicano , and other Filipino @-@ made instruments modeled and developed after the guitar . <unk> and <unk> are prevalent during this time wherein these songs are often used in courtship rituals . 
 Marcelo <unk> ( organist ) , Simplicio Solis ( organist ) , Diego C. Perez ( pianist ) , Jose Conseco ( pianist ) and Doña Dolores Paterno ( composer ) were some of the recognized musicians in this era . Nowadays , American pop culture has a heavy hold on the Filipinos that evolved from the Spanish times when the American occupation happened . Along with Korean pop , these two are dominating the recent music scene in media . However , the revival of Spanish @-@ influence folk music has been done due to the different choir groups in and out of the country like the Philippine Madrigal Singers . 
 = = = Visual art = = = 
 Pottery and weaving are among the very first art forms showcasing Filipino artistic design and are evident from cave dwellings all over the country . Among these are mostly anthropomorphic earthenware jars dating from c . 5 BC to 225 AD . Weaving was mostly done by women , using fibers from abaca , pineapple , cotton , and bark to make clothes , rugs and hats . Baskets were mostly utilized to carry grain and other foods . 
 Early Philippine sculpture is characterized by frontal nudity . One of the earliest forms are the <unk> by the Ifugao peoples which serve as an assurance for bountiful harvests . The original function of these sculptures are related to the ceremonies and beliefs of the tribes who created them . Arab and Russian missionaries also brought beveled type of carvings in the form of <unk> . The beginnings of this sculpture type started with the Islamization of Sulu . The Spanish colonization of the country did not hinder Filipinos creating sculptures for objects of adoration . During this time , sculptures of deities and saints were used to teach Filipinos Christian doctrines . During the American colonialism , worshippers of faith were not discouraged to sculpt in order to adorn churches . 
 Filipinos ' first exposure to painting happened when Spain conquered the Philippines and these were used as religious propaganda often displayed in churches . However , as education progressed and wealth increased , more and more artists started to shift from the traditional religious motifs to a more secular pattern of imagery . 
 Paintings of early modernist painters such as Damián Domingo often still had a religious association but the art of Juan Luna and Félix Hidalgo showed a trend towards political statement . The first Philippine national artist Fernando <unk> used post @-@ modernism to produce paintings that illustrated aspects of Philippine culture , while other artists such as Fernando <unk> used both realistic and abstract techniques . 
 In the modern period , the integration of architecture in the Art Deco style happened . Many of these examples can be seen in statues all over the country especially in public parks and spaces . 
 = = = Values = = = 
 As a general description , the distinct value system of Filipinos is rooted primarily in personal alliance systems , especially those based in kinship , obligation , friendship , religion ( particularly Christianity ) , and commercial relationships . 
 Filipino values are , for the most part , centered around maintaining social harmony , motivated primarily by the desire to be accepted within a group . The main sanction against diverging from these values are the concepts of " Hiya " , roughly translated as ' a sense of shame ' , and " Amor <unk> " or ' self @-@ esteem ' . Social approval , acceptance by a group , and belonging to a group are major concerns . Caring about what others will think , say or do , are strong influences on social behavior among Filipinos . 
 Other elements of the Filipino value system are optimism about the future , pessimism about present situations and events , concern and care for other people , the existence of friendship and friendliness , the habit of being hospitable , religious nature , <unk> to self and others , respect for the female members of society , the fear of God , and abhorrence of acts of cheating and thievery . 
 While in most of the world the popularity of formal female beauty contests has diminished , they remain both popular and widespread in the Philippines . Binibining Pilipinas is a closely followed event throughout the country along with other major national pageants such as Miss Philippines Earth and Miss World Philippines . Filipinas have garnered one Miss World , three Miss Universe , five Miss International , three Miss Earth , and one Miss Supranational titles . 
 = = = Dance = = = 
 Just like the evolution of Philippine music , dance as well has been in constant change . Prior to colonial rule , the Philippines has a wide array of ethnic dances from different tribal groups . This is due mainly to the fact that Philippines is an island thus the different varieties of dance developed . Both Luzon and Visayas , at first , were more akin to tribal movements until the Spanish came . Mindanao represents more of an array of Muslim inspired dances and Spanish influence was minimal in the region of Zamboanga . 
 Universal dances in the Philippines are found at societal functions such as rituals , mimicry , life cycle and parties . During the Spanish era , most dances are accompanied by Rondalya music usually with 14 @-@ string <unk> that the Filipinos invented or by other type of stringed instruments that locally evolved in to the culture as well . 
 One famous dance that is well known is called the <unk> , where a band of Rondalya musicians play along with the percussive beat of the two bamboo poles . It usually starts with men and women acting a scene about " How rural townsfolk mingle " . The dancers then graze thru the clashing of the bamboo poles held on opposite sides . The end displays the paired bamboo poles crossing each other . The Muslim version of this where bamboo poles are also used is called the <unk> . Nowadays , in the Modern and Post @-@ Modern time periods , dances vary from the delicate ballet up to the more street @-@ oriented styles of breakdancing to name a few . 
 = = = Cuisine = = = 
 Philippine cuisine has evolved over several centuries from its Malayo @-@ Polynesian origins to become a mixed cuisine with many Hispanic , Chinese , American , and other Asian influences that have been adapted to local ingredients and the Filipino palate to create distinctively Filipino dishes . Dishes range from the very simple , like a meal of fried salted fish and rice , to the elaborate , such as the <unk> and <unk> created for fiestas . 
 Popular dishes include <unk> , adobo , <unk> , <unk> @-@ <unk> , tapa , crispy <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and halo @-@ halo . Some common local ingredients used in cooking are <unk> , coconuts , saba ( a kind of short wide plantain ) , mangoes , milkfish , and fish sauce . Filipino taste buds tend to favor robust flavors , but the cuisine is not as spicy as those of its neighbors . 
 Unlike many of their Asian counterparts , Filipinos do not eat with chopsticks ; they use Western cutlery . However , possibly due to rice being the primary staple food and the popularity of a large number of stews and main dishes with broth in Philippine cuisine , the main pairing of utensils seen at the Filipino dining table is that of spoon and fork , not knife and fork . 
 The traditional way of eating with the hands known as kamayan ( using the washed right hand for bringing food to the mouth ) was previously more often seen in the less urbanized areas . However , due to the various Filipino restaurants that introduced Filipino food to people of other nationalities as well as to Filipino urbanites , kamayan fast became popular . This recent trend also sometimes incorporates the " Boodle Fight " concept ( as popularized and coined by the Philippine Army ) , wherein banana leaves are used as giant plates on top of which rice portions and Filipino <unk> are placed all together for a filial , friendly and / or communal kamayan feasting . 
 = = = Literature = = = 
 Philippine mythology has been handed down primarily through the traditional oral folk literature of the Filipino people . While each unique ethnic group has its own stories and myths to tell , Hindu and Spanish influences can nonetheless be detected in many cases . Philippine mythology mostly consists of creation stories or stories about supernatural creatures , such as the aswang , the manananggal , the <unk> / <unk> , and nature . Some popular figures from Philippine mythologies are Maria Makiling , Lam @-@ Ang , and the <unk> . 
 Philippine literature comprises works usually written in Filipino , Spanish , or English . Some of the most known were created from the 17th to 19th century . <unk> , for example , is a famous epic about an eponymous magical bird allegedly written by José de la Cruz or " <unk> <unk> " . Francisco <unk> the poet and playwright who wrote <unk> at Laura is recognized as a preeminent writer in the Filipino language . José Rizal wrote the novels Noli Me <unk> ( Touch Me Not ) and El <unk> ( The <unk> , also known as The Reign of Greed ) . He is considered a national hero . His depiction of the injustices of Spanish rule , and his death by firing squad , inspired other Philippine revolutionaries to seek independence . Several Filipino writers were awarded National Artist of the Philippines such as N. V. M. Gonzalez , Amado V. Hernandez , Francisco <unk> , Nick Joaquín , F. <unk> José and many more . 
 = = = Media = = = 
 Philippine media uses mainly Filipino and English . Other Philippine languages , including various Visayan languages are also used , especially in radio due to its ability to reach remote rural locations that might otherwise not be serviced by other kinds of media . The dominant television networks ABS @-@ CBN , GMA and TV5 also have extensive radio presence . 
 The entertainment industry is vibrant and feeds broadsheets and tabloids with an unending supply of details about celebrities and sensationalist daily scandals . Drama and fantasy shows are anticipated as are Latin telenovelas , <unk> , and anime . Daytime television is dominated by game shows , variety shows , and talk shows such as Eat Bulaga and It 's Showtime . Philippine cinema has a long history and is popular domestically , but has faced increasing competition from American , Asian and European films . Critically acclaimed directors and actors include Lino <unk> and Nora <unk> for films like <unk> : Sa mga <unk> ng <unk> ( Manila : In the Claws of Light ) and <unk> ( Miracle ) . In recent years it has become common to see celebrities flitting between television and movies and then moving into politics provoking concerns .

In 2010 , Manny Pacquiao was named " Fighter of the Decade " for the 2000s ( decade ) by the Boxing Writers Association of America ( <unk> ) , World Boxing Council ( WBC ) , and World Boxing Organization ( WBO ) . The national martial art and sport of the country is <unk> , Eskrima or Kali in some regions 
 The Philippines has participated in the Summer Olympic Games since 1924 and was the first country in Southeast Asia to compete and win a medal . The country had competed in every Summer Olympic Games since then , except when they participated in the American @-@ led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics . The Philippines is also the first tropical nation to compete at the Winter Olympic Games debuting in the 1972 edition . 
 Internationally , Philippines has been well documented for its successes in beauty pageants .

 = Vera Katz ( sculpture ) = 
 Vera Katz , also known as Mayor , Vera Katz , is an outdoor bronze sculpture depicting Vera Katz created by American artist Bill Bane . Unveiled in 2006 , it is located along the Eastbank Esplanade in Portland , Oregon . Katz , a former mayor of the city between 1993 and 2005 , supported arts and culture during her tenure and established Oregon 's Percent for Art program . She was also instrumental in developing the Eastbank Esplanade , which is named after her . The sculpture has received a mostly positive reception and has inspired people to adorn it with clothing , flowers and makeup . 
 = = Description and history = = 
 The statue was financed by a " group of generous Portlanders " and its commission was managed by the Regional Arts & Culture Council ( RACC ) with assistance from members of Katz 's former staff . It was unveiled on June 2 , 2006 , on the plaza at the south end of the Esplanade , just north of the Hawthorne Bridge and Main Street marker . It measures 53 inches ( 130 cm ) x 18 inches ( 46 cm ) x 18 inches ( 46 cm ) and rests on an orange triangular base . Portland State University 's Daily Vanguard described Katz as : " leaning close to a small body with legs crossed and hands in , squeezed together in her lap as if she 's cold , too . The teeth are also bared and unusually straight , creating the impression that Katz might snap at passers @-@ by . But overall , the face is open and the hair is particularly lifelike . " She is depicted wearing a Portland rose on her lapel . According to The Oregonian , the sculpture provides a lap on which children can pose and sometimes frightens passersby at night . It is part of the collection of the Regional Arts & Culture Council . The organization has said : " it seems fitting that [ Katz 's ] political leadership and love for the arts should come together in a public tribute to her " . 
 Katz attended the statue 's surprise unveiling during an event organized by the Regional Arts & Culture Council and funded by friends . Also in attendance were Mayor Tom Potter , three city commissioners , Bill Bane , friends , and former staff members . Wearing a lei brought by her son , Katz said the statue looked " far more beautiful than [ her ] " and encouraged city officials to continue expanding the Eastbank Esplanade south . 
 The statue went missing temporarily in October 2013 , prompting an investigation by then Mayor Sam Adams . In 2013 , RACC 's public art collections manager said the work has received mostly " positive attention " and has been outfitted with hats , flowers and " yarn @-@ bombed " sweaters . It has also attracted books , hats , lipstick , paint and even a " mohawk of cake frosting " . 
 Bane 's study for the sculpture , called Vera , is a bronze bust measuring 18 inches ( 46 cm ) x 11 inches ( 28 cm ) . The bust is part of a private collection . 
 = = Reception = = 
 In 2006 , Willamette Week included the sculpture in its annual " Best of Portland " list , under the category " Best Mayoral Monument " . According to the paper : 
 ... Bane managed to capture much of the ex @-@ mayor 's character : Her eyes are friendly and her hair as wild as ever . But Katz 's signature grin is a little stiff , a little too aggressive . Leaning forward , she looks as if she might take a bite out of the next passerby . Which by the way , seems appropriate when you look back on her days behind the mayoral desk . Maybe monochromatic bronze just isn 't the right medium for a woman as colorful as ol ' Vera . Where 's the red blazer ? Our suggestion : Get this lady some accessories ! The right hat or scarf could make that brown pantsuit really work . 
 Daily Vanguard 's Celina Monte called the sculpture " fabulously strange " and said it illustrated the " straightforward , tactile and symmetrical properties " of some of Bane 's other work . The work has been included in at least one published walking tour of Portland , which noted its function as a meeting location for bicyclists and pedestrians . 
 = <unk> shark = 
 The kitefin shark or seal shark ( Dalatias licha ) is a species of dogfish shark in the family <unk> , and the only species in its genus . It is found sporadically around the world , usually close to the sea floor at depths of 200 – 600 m ( 660 – 1 @,@ 970 ft ) . With a sizable oil @-@ filled liver to maintain neutral buoyancy , this shark is able to cruise slowly through the water while expending little energy . The kitefin shark has a slender body with a very short , blunt snout , large eyes , and thick lips . Its teeth are highly differentiated between the upper and lower jaws , with the upper teeth small and narrow and the lower teeth large , triangular , and serrated . Its typical length is 1 @.@ 0 – 1 @.@ 4 m ( 3 @.@ 3 – 4 @.@ 6 ft ) . 
 Armed with large teeth and a strong bite , the kitefin shark is a powerful , solitary predator that takes many different types of prey , ranging from bony fishes , sharks and rays , to cephalopods , crustaceans , polychaete worms , siphonophores , and possibly carrion . It also takes bites out of animals larger than itself , similar to its smaller relative , the cookiecutter shark ( Isistius brasiliensis ) . This shark is aplacental viviparous and gives birth to 10 – 14 young . The kitefin shark is fished commercially for its meat , skin , and liver oil , primarily by Portugal and Japan . A fishery targeting this species existed off the Azores from the 1970s to the 1990s , but collapsed due to overfishing and falling liver oil prices ; the rapid depletion of the Azores stock is often cited as an example of the susceptibility of deep @-@ sea sharks to human exploitation . The low reproductive rate of this species renders it susceptible to overfishing and , coupled with known population declines , has led it to be assessed as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The kitefin shark was originally described as Squalus licha by French naturalist Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre , in his 1788 Tableau encyclopédique et méthodique des trois <unk> de la nature ; the type specimen from " Le cap Breton " has since been lost . This species was later placed in its own genus , Dalatias , which came from the synonymy of Constantine Rafinesque 's 1810 Dalatias <unk> with S. licha . However , some authorities dispute this on the grounds that D. <unk> is a nomen dubium , and prefer to use the next available genus name <unk> . The genus name Dalatias is derived from the Greek <unk> or <unk> , meaning " torch " . The specific epithet licha comes from la <unk> , the French name for this shark . Additional common names used for the kitefin shark include black shark and <unk> Charlie . 
 = = Phylogeny and evolution = = 
 Cladistic studies have consistently found that the closest relatives of the kitefin shark are the cookiecutter sharks ( Isistius ) , with which they share several <unk> , skeletal , and muscular similarities . Dalatias and Isistius are believed to have evolutionarily diverged shortly after the transition between the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods ( 65 @.@ 5 Ma ) , as part of a larger adaptive radiation of dogfish sharks from the deep sea into relatively shallower habitats . 
 The oldest fossil teeth that definitively belong to the kitefin shark date to the Middle Eocene epoch , such as those recovered from <unk> @-@ stage deposits ( 43 @.@ 0 – 37 @.@ 0 Ma ) in New Zealand . Dalatias fossil teeth dating to various ages have also been discovered in Europe , the former USSR , Japan , and western India . The fossil material now recognized as belonging to this species were historically described under a multitude of different names . 
 = = Description = = 
 The kitefin shark has a moderately elongated body with a very short , rounded snout . The eyes and spiracles are large . The lips are thick with pleats or fringes , though are not modified to be suctorial . There are 16 – 21 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 17 – 20 tooth rows in the lower jaw . The upper teeth are small and spike @-@ shaped , curving slightly towards the corners of the mouth . The lower teeth are very large , knife @-@ shaped , and serrated , with their bases interlocking to form a continuous cutting surface . 
 The first dorsal fin is slightly smaller and shorter @-@ based than the second , and neither has spines . The first dorsal fin originates behind the free rear tip of the pectoral fins , while the second originates above the middle of the pelvic fin bases . The pectoral fins are short and rounded . The caudal fin has a prominent upper lobe with a well @-@ developed notch near the tip , and a barely present lower lobe . The form and arrangement of the fins is similar to the Portuguese dogfish ( Centroscymnus coelolepis ) , from which this species can be distinguished by the lack of fin spines . The dermal denticles are small and flat , with a single horizontal ridge ending in a point . 
 The coloration is a uniform dark brown or gray , sometimes with faint black spots on the back . The fins have white or translucent trailing edges , and the tip of the caudal fin is black . An 90 cm ( 3 @.@ 0 ft ) long kitefin shark with partial albinism , lacking pigment on 59 % of its body , was caught in the Gulf of Genoa in 2003 . Unlike in a previous case of an albino Portuguese dogfish , the abnormal coloration of this individual had not diminished its ability to capture prey . Most kitefin sharks are 1 @.@ 0 – 1 @.@ 4 m ( 3 @.@ 3 – 4 @.@ 6 ft ) long and weigh 8 kg ( 18 lb ) ; the maximum reported length is 1 @.@ 6 m ( 5 @.@ 2 ft ) , possibly 1 @.@ 8 m ( 5 @.@ 9 ft ) . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The kitefin shark has an almost circumglobal range in tropical and warm @-@ temperature waters , consisting of a number of widely separated populations with likely little interchange between them . This shark has not been reported from the eastern Pacific and northern Indian Oceans . In the northern Atlantic , it occurs in the Georges Bank and the northern Gulf of Mexico , and from the North Sea to Cameroon , including around the British Isles , in the western and central Mediterranean Sea , and off Madeira and the Azores . In the Indian Ocean , it is found off South Africa and Mozambique . In the Pacific , it occurs off Japan , Java , Australia and New Zealand , and the Hawaiian Islands . There is a single record of this species in the southern Atlantic , from off southern Brazil . 
 An offshore , deepwater species , the kitefin shark is most common at a depth of 200 – 600 m ( 660 – 1 @,@ 970 ft ) , but has been captured from the surface to as deep as 1 @,@ 800 m ( 5 @,@ 900 ft ) . Off the Azores this shark segregates by sex , with females most common around a depth of 230 m ( 750 ft ) and males most common around 412 – 448 m ( 1 @,@ 352 – 1 @,@ 470 ft ) . The kitefin shark inhabits the outer continental shelves and upper continental slopes , and is also found around oceanic islands and seamounts . It is the only member of its family that tends to be found close to the sea floor as opposed to in the middle of the water column , though on occasion it has been captured well above the bottom . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 Relatively common where it occurs , kitefin sharks are usually solitary in nature but may form small groups . It is a slow swimmer with a large liver filled with squalene , a lipid less dense than water , allowing it to maintain neutral buoyancy and hover above the bottom with little effort . Studies off the coast of North Africa and in the Gulf of Genoa have found males outnumbering females by 2 : 1 and 5 : 1 respectively ; this imbalanced sex ratio has not been observed off South Africa and may reflect sampling bias . The kitefin shark is preyed upon by larger fishes and sharks , as well as by sperm whales ( Physeter macrocephalus ) . Parasite data on this species is limited ; an examination of two sharks caught off Ireland found three nematodes in the stomach lumen . One could be identified as Anisakis simplex L3 , while another may have been a larval <unk> . 
 A powerful and versatile deepwater predator , the short , robust jaws of the kitefin shark give it an enormously strong bite . It feeds mainly on bony fishes ( including deepwater smelts , <unk> , scaly dragonfishes , barracudinas , <unk> , lanternfishes , bristlemouths , cod and other <unk> , grenadiers , deepwater <unk> , <unk> , snake mackerels , deepwater cardinalfishes , and sea toads ) , but also takes a wide variety of other animals , including skates , smaller sharks ( Galeus , Squalus , Etmopterus and Centrophorus ) , squid and octopus , crustaceans ( amphipods , isopods , shrimp and lobsters ) , polychaete worms , and siphonophores . Like the related cookiecutter shark , the kitefin shark is also capable of excising chunks of flesh from animals larger than itself , including other sharks and whales . The presence of fast @-@ swimming fishes in its diet suggests the kitefin shark may scavenge , or have some other means of capturing faster prey . In the Mediterranean , bony fishes are the most important food year @-@ round , with the second @-@ most important prey being sharks in the winter and spring , crustaceans in the summer , and cephalopods in the fall . Captured males are more likely to have full stomachs than females for unknown reasons . 
 Reproduction in the kitefin shark is aplacental viviparous , with the embryos hatching inside the uterus and being sustained to term by yolk . Adult females have two functional ovaries and two functional uteruses ; the uterus is not divided into compartments . In the Mediterranean , breeding occurs throughout the year with peaks in spring and fall ; females may have a year of rest in between pregnancies . The litter size is 10 – 16 , increasing with female size . The young are born at a length of 30 – 45 cm ( 12 – 18 in ) , varying by geographic location , after a possible gestation period of two years . The males mature sexually at a length of 77 – 121 cm ( 2 @.@ 53 – 3 @.@ 97 ft ) , and the females at a length of 117 – 159 cm ( 3 @.@ 84 – 5 @.@ 22 ft ) . There is no relationship between an individual 's size at birth , size at maturity , and maximum size .

 The kitefin shark inhabits depths too great for it to be a danger to humans . Its upper teeth have been found lodged in underwater fiberoptic cables . This species has a long history of human exploitation : the meat is consumed in the eastern Atlantic and Japan , and the offal processed into fishmeal . The liver oil is utilized in Portugal , Japan , and South Africa . The skin is made into a type of shagreen useful in the making of furniture and jewelry , and is also favored for the manufacture of " <unk> " , a Spanish polished leather . This shark has no commercial value in the western Atlantic . 
 The continuing expansion of commercial fisheries into the deep sea has raised concerns about the vulnerability of this and other deepwater shark species to overfishing , as these sharks have slow growth and reproductive rates . This is exemplified by the rapid stock depletion and collapse of the Azores kitefin shark fishery . This targeted fishery began in the early 1970s for the production of liver oil . In the early 1980s , the fishing fleet was enlarged with the addition of industrial vessels equipped with demersal gillnets , resulting in a fishery peak in 1984 of 937 tons landed . After 1991 , kitefin shark catches declined precipitously to under 15 tons annually which , along with a drop in the global price of liver oil , led to the fishery becoming unprofitable by the end of the decade . A population assessment has suggested that the northeastern Atlantic stock had fallen to 50 % of the pre @-@ exploitation biomass . 
 Fisheries operating off Portugal and Japan are responsible for most commercial landings of the kitefin shark , generally as bycatch in bottom trawls and on hook @-@ and @-@ line . Portugal reported a kitefin shark bycatch of 282 tons in 2000 and 119 tons in 2003 . In other areas of the northeastern Atlantic this shark is rare and reported catches are likely confounded by misidentifications of other species ; some are caught by mixed @-@ species gillnet fisheries operating in deep water west of the British Isles , where surveys suggest that kitefin shark numbers may have declined by 94 % since the 1970s . In the Mediterranean , this shark is caught incidentally by bottom trawl and gillnet fisheries . Although it is generally discarded alive , many are unable to return to deep water and do not survive . In the Southern Hemisphere , catches by the Australian South East Trawl Fishery are increasing following the relaxation of regulations regarding seafood mercury content ; this species is not included under Australian fishery quotas . New Zealand kitefin shark catches peaked from 1986 to 1997 . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has assessed the kitefin shark as Near Threatened worldwide , and as Vulnerable in the northeastern Atlantic in light of documented population declines . 
 = Tiananmen Square self @-@ immolation incident = 
 The Tiananmen Square self @-@ immolation incident took place in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing , on the eve of Chinese New Year on 23 January 2001 . The incident is disputed : Chinese government sources say that five members of Falun Gong , a spiritual practice that is persecuted in mainland China , set themselves on fire in the square . Falun Gong sources disputed the accuracy of these portrayals , noting that their teachings explicitly forbid violence or suicide . Several Western journalists and scholars also noted inconsistencies in the government 's account of event , suggesting the self @-@ immolations were staged by the government to discredit Falun Gong . 
 According to Chinese state media , a group of seven people had travelled to Beijing from Henan province , and five set themselves on fire on Tiananmen Square . One of them , Liu Chunling , died at Tiananmen under disputed circumstances , and another , 12 @-@ year @-@ old Liu Siying , reportedly died in hospital several weeks later ; three survived . The incident received international news coverage , and video footage was broadcast a week later in the People 's Republic of China by China Central Television ( CCTV ) . In the Chinese press , the event was used as proof of the " dangers " of Falun Gong , and was used to legitimise the government 's campaign against the group . 
 The official account of events soon came under scrutiny , however . Two weeks after the self @-@ immolation event , The Washington Post published an investigation into the identity of the two self @-@ immolation victims who were killed , and found that " no one ever saw [ them ] practice Falun Gong " . Other evidence surfaced by journalists and international observers suggests that Chinese authorities had advanced knowledge of the self @-@ immolation . 
 Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) wrote that " the incident was among one [ sic ] of the most difficult stories for reporters in Beijing at the time to report on " because of a lack of independent information available . The self @-@ immolation victims were accessible only to reporters from China 's state @-@ run press ; international media , and even the victims ' family members , were barred from contacting them . A wide variety of opinions and interpretations of what may have happened then emerged : the event may have been set up by the government to frame Falun Gong ; it may have been an authentic protest ; the self @-@ immolators could have been " new or unschooled " Falun Gong practitioners ; and other views . 
 The campaign of state propaganda that followed the event eroded public sympathy for Falun Gong . Time magazine noted that many Chinese had previously felt that Falun Gong posed no real threat , and that the state 's crackdown against it had gone too far . After the self @-@ immolation , however , the media campaign against the group gained significant traction . Posters , leaflets and videos were produced detailing the supposed detrimental effects of Falun Gong practice , and regular anti @-@ Falun Gong classes were scheduled in schools . CNN compared the government 's propaganda initiative to past political movements such as the Korean War and the Cultural Revolution . Later , as public opinion turned against the group , the Chinese authorities began sanctioning the " systematic use of violence " to eliminate Falun Gong . In the year following the incident , the imprisonment , torture , and deaths of Falun Gong practitioners in custody increased significantly . 
 = = Background = = 
 Falun Gong , also known as Falun Dafa , is a form of spiritual qigong practice that involves meditative exercises , and a philosophy drawing on Buddhist and Taoist tradition introduced by Li Hongzhi in Northeast China in the spring of 1992 . By the late 1990s , it had attracted tens of millions of followers . Falun Gong initially enjoyed official recognition support during the early years of its development . By the mid @-@ 1990s , however , Chinese authorities sought to rein in the growth of qigong practices , enacting more stringent requirements on the country 's various qigong denominations . In 1996 , Falun Gong came under increasing criticism and surveillance from the country 's security apparatus . 
 On 25 April 1999 , more than ten thousand practitioners congregated outside Communist Party of China headquarters in Zhongnanhai to request legal recognition . That evening , then @-@ Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin issued a decision to eradicate Falun Gong . At Jiang 's direction , on 7 June 1999 a special leading group was established within the party 's Central Committee to manage the persecution . The resulting organisation , called the 6 @-@ 10 Office , assumed the role of coordinating the anti @-@ Falun Gong media coverage in the state @-@ run press , as well influencing other party and state entities such as the courts and security agencies . On 19 July , the Central Committee of the Communist Party issued a document effectively banning the practice of Falun Gong . The following day , hundreds of practitioners were detained by security forces . 
 The persecution that followed was characterised by a " massive propaganda campaign " intended to justify the persecution by portraying Falun Gong as superstitious , dangerous , and incompatible with the official ideology . Tens of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners were imprisoned , and by the end of 1999 , reports began to emerge of torture in custody . According to Ian Johnson , authorities were given broad mandates to eliminate Falun Gong and pursue the coercive conversion of practitioners , but were not scrutinised for the methods they used . This resulted in the widespread use of torture , sometimes resulting in death . 
 Tiananmen Square was one of the main venues where Falun Gong practitioners gathered to protest the persecution , usually by raising banners in defence of the group , or stage peaceful meditation sit @-@ ins . Ian Johnson of the Wall Street Journal estimated that by 25 April 2000 , more than 30 @,@ 000 practitioners had been arrested for attempting to demonstrate in Beijing , most of them in or on the way to Tiananmen Square . Seven hundred Falun Gong followers were arrested during a demonstration in the Square on 1 January 2001 . 
 Chinese authorities struggled throughout the early years of the persecution to turn public opinion against Falun Gong . Instead , the campaign garnered criticisms from across a wide spectrum of Chinese society , with some commentators drawing comparisons to the Cultural Revolution and Nazi Germany 's treatment of the Jews . According to Human Rights Watch , " the leadership 's frustration with the failure of its efforts to quickly and thoroughly dismantle Falungong was also evident in its media campaign . " The state @-@ run press admitted in late 2000 that Falun Gong was continuing to stage protests in defiance of the ban , and proclaimed that " the ' broad masses ' had to be made to understand the ' duration , complexity and ferocity of our battle with Falun Gong . ' " In January 2001 , Chinese authorities launched a new wave of propaganda to discredit Falun Gong in which they urged state @-@ run media organizations to vilify the group .

 On 23 January 2001 , the eve of Chinese New Year , five people on Tiananmen Square poured gasoline over their clothes and set themselves on fire . 
 A CNN film crew , who were there on a routine check for a possible Falun Gong protest , observed a man sitting down on the pavement northeast of the Monument to the People 's Heroes at the centre of the square . He proceeded to pour gasoline over himself and set himself ablaze . Police officers quickly congregated on the scene and extinguished the flames . Shortly afterwards , another four people on the square set themselves alight . One of the four , a man , was detained and driven away in a police van . 
 CNN reported that at least two men and altogether five persons set themselves on fire after pouring gasoline over themselves . They did not see a child among the self @-@ immolators . The CNN crew began filming the events from a distance , but were quickly intercepted by military police , who detained the journalists and confiscated their equipment . The authorities then put out the flames consuming the other four people 's clothing . A police van came to collect the badly burnt man , and two ambulances arrived almost 25 minutes later to collect the other four . The square was completely closed , and security was tight the next day , the most important of the traditional Chinese holidays . Police monitored public access to the square for the New Year celebrations , had fire extinguishers ready , and prevented Falun Gong practitioners from opening banners . 
 Xinhua named seven individuals as having been involved : Wang Jindong ( <unk> ) , Liu Chunling ( <unk> ) , Liu Siying ( <unk> ) , Chen Guo ( <unk> ) , Hao <unk> ( <unk> ) ; Liu <unk> ( <unk> ) , Liu Yunfang ( <unk> ) had not set themselves on fire . Liu Chunling reportedly died on the scene . A few months later , state media announced the death of her daughter Liu Siying , who , according to state @-@ news , had been hospitalised with severe burns following the incident . The other three were reported to have been " severely disfigured " . Beijing denied requests from western journalists to interview the survivors , and only China Central Television and the official New China News Agency were permitted to speak to their relatives or their colleagues . 
 = = Chinese media reports = = 
 Xinhua released details of the incident to foreign media 2 hours after the self @-@ immolation occurred . Xinhua then distributed a fuller press release seven days later on Tuesday , 30 January , in response to other media reports on the incident . On 31 January , a 30 @-@ minute special edition of the current affairs programme Forum told the state 's version of the events to the Chinese public . China Central Television aired footage , said to be taken by nearby surveillance cameras , of five people in flames . 
 The Chinese authorities stated that the seven people who had come to Tiananmen Square with the intention of self @-@ immolating were all from the city of Kaifeng in Henan province . The state @-@ run Xinhua News Agency asserted that the self @-@ immolators were " avid practitioners " of Falun Gong who had taken up the practice between 1994 and 1997 , and that they fantasised during the preceding week about " how wonderful it would be to enter heaven " . Six of them reportedly took the train on 16 January , meeting Chen Guo , the daughter of one of them , upon their arrival in Beijing . The seven agreed to light themselves in different parts of the Square at 2 : 30 pm on the designated day with gasoline smuggled there in plastic soda bottles ; each had been armed with two lighters in case one would fail . According to the government @-@ run China Association For Cultic Studies website , Wang Jindong stated afterwards that the group arrived in Tiananmen Square by two taxis , and were dropped off at the south of the Great Hall of the People , from where they walked to the spot where they would ignite themselves . Wang said he was approached by police as he was splitting open the soda bottles , and ignited himself hurriedly without assuming the lotus position . A press release from the Chinese government says that Liu Yunfang felt that the police were able to stop him burning himself because he had not attained the " required spiritual level . " 
 Articles in the <unk> Evening News and the Southern Daily reported that police had evidence that a few foreign reporters had advance knowledge of the incident , and suggested that such reporters could be charged with " instigating and abetting a suicide . " State media claimed surveillance video showed six or seven reporters from CNN , the Associated Press and Agence France @-@ Presse arriving just 10 minutes before the self @-@ immolations took place ; however , all three agencies denied advance knowledge of the incident — AP and AFP said they had no reporters in the square at the time , while CNN 's chief news executive , Eason Jordan , said the CNN crew were there on a routine check for a possible Falun Gong protest . 
 = = Falun Gong response = = 
 Immediately following the self @-@ immolation , the Falun Dafa Information Center denied that the self @-@ immolators could have been Falun Gong practitioners , emphatically pointing out that Falun Gong 's teachings do not sanction any form of violence , and that suicide is considered a sin . 
 Falun Gong sources overseas questioned the official Chinese government account of the event , and apparent inconsistencies in government 's official narrative led to a hypothesis that the self @-@ immolation was staged by the government to justify the persecution against Falun Gong by portraying its practitioners as irrational and suicidal . According to this hypothesis , the self @-@ immolation participants were paid actors , and were presumably assured that the flames would be extinguished before doing real harm . 
 Falun Gong @-@ affiliated New Tang Dynasty Television produced a programme called False Fire , which analyses the inconsistencies in the accounts of the event in the official Chinese media . 
 Based on a review of CCTV footage , the programme purports to demonstrate that the self @-@ immolators donned fire @-@ proof clothing and masks , and raises the question of why the participants ' hair and the apparently gasoline @-@ filled bottles they carried did not catch fire . Falun Gong sources also noted that the self @-@ immolators ' behaviour , the slogans they shouted , and their meditation postures were not consistent with the teachings or practices of Falun Gong . Furthermore , the program 's frame @-@ by @-@ frame analysis of the CCTV footage purportedly shows that Liu was actually killed by a deadly blow to the head from a man in a military overcoat . The False Fire documentary described the death of 12 @-@ year @-@ old Liu Siying as being under " unusual circumstances " , saying that she was apparently recovering well before dying suddenly on 17 March . Some Falun Gong sources argue that she may have been killed by the government as a way of guaranteeing her silence . 
 The program suggests that the reaction time of state @-@ run television crews and police on Tiananmen Square demonstrates they had advance knowledge of the event . They observed that officers arrived almost immediately on the scene equipped with numerous fire extinguishers . Fire extinguishers are not standard equipment for police on Tiananmen Square ; the nearest building that would house them was several minutes away from the scene . 
 The World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong further called attention to portrayals of Wang Jindong on state @-@ run television , claiming that the man who self @-@ immolated on the square was not the same person who appeared in subsequent interviews with CCTV . It pointed to a voice analysis conducted by the Speech Processing Laboratory at National Taiwan University , which concluded that the voices did not match , and also noted that the hairline and facial proportions appeared to be different . These observations were used to advance the theory that the self @-@ immolators were actors . 
 = = Third @-@ party findings = = 
 The identities of some of the self @-@ immolators , and their relationship to Falun Gong , was called into question by Philip Pan of the Washington Post . While state @-@ run Xinhua News Agency had reported that Liu Chunling 's adoptive mother speaking of Liu 's " obsession with Falun Gong " , her " worshipping of Li Hongzhi " , and that Liu would teach her daughter Falun Gong , Pan found most residents in Kaifeng felt disgraced by what Liu had done ( i.e. the self @-@ immolation ) , but none of Liu 's neighbours had ever observed her practising Falun Gong . They remarked there were problems between Liu and her mother , and the reporter learned that Liu " worked in a nightclub , took money to keep men company " . According to David Ownby , a University of Montreal historian and expert on Falun Gong , Pan 's portrayal of Liu Chunlin is highly inconsistent with the typical profile of a Falun Gong practitioner . 
 The identities of participants on Tiananmen Square was also called into question by a CNN producer on the scene . While the Chinese government claimed that a 12 @-@ year @-@ old Liu Siying had set herself on fire at the urging of her mother , the CNN producer said that she did not see any children among the self @-@ immolators . 
 Several observers have noted that foreign journalists were not allowed to interview the self @-@ immolation victims recovering in hospitals . Even the victims ' relatives were not permitted to speak with them , according to David Ownby . Pan wrote that " Beijing denied requests to interview Liu Siying and the three other survivors , who are all hospitalized ... A Kaifeng official said only China Central Television and the official New China News Agency were permitted to speak to their relatives or their colleagues . A man who answered the door at the Liu home referred questions to the government . " The survivors were interviewed by the state @-@ run press , however . In one such interview , CCTV interviewed the 12 @-@ year @-@ old Liu Siying . Government sources reported Liu Siying had undergone a tracheotomy shortly before the interview . Speaking through approved media outlets , she said that her own mother told her to set herself on fire to reach the " heavenly golden kingdom " ; journalist Danny Schechter doubted that the child would have been able to speak to the Chinese media so soon after a tracheotomy , yet Liu Siying appeared to be speaking clearly and singing in the interview . 
 According to Schechter , Xinhua had unusually released a statement on the self @-@ immolation to foreign media only hours after the event occurred , saying that this was unusual because sensitive subjects in the Chinese press are almost never reported on a timely basis . The usual protocol is approval by several party officials before publication . Ian Johnson similarly observed the state media " reported [ the victim 's ] death with unusual alacrity , implying that either the death took place earlier than reported or the usually cautious media had top @-@ level approval to rush out electronic reports and a televised dispatch . " 
 Questions were also raised over where the footage of the event came from , and the speed with which camera crews appeared on scene . Chinese government media reported that the close @-@ up shots in its video footage came from confiscated CNN tapes . CNN representatives argued that this was impossible , however , as their reporters were detained shortly after the event began . Pan was also suspicious of the positioning of the cameras , and the fact that the close @-@ up shots shown on Chinese television were taken without police interference . " In some , the camera is clearly behind police barricades " , the Washington Post article says . In addition , overhead surveillance camera footage seemed to show a man filming the scene using a small hand @-@ held camera , rather than a large camera of the type used for TV news reporting . 
 The Age commented that the " ready availability of fire @-@ extinguishers and official TV teams and the lack of verification about the victims " raised questions about whether authorities had advanced knowledge of the self @-@ immolation . Police were on the scene of the self @-@ immolation within 90 seconds carrying numerous pieces of firefighting equipment . A European journalist was quoted as saying " I have never seen policemen patrolling on Tiananmen Square carrying fire extinguishers . How come they all showed up today ? The location of the incident is at least 20 minutes roundtrip from the nearest building – the People 's Great Hall . " John Gittings of The Guardian stated , however , that it was common practice in many countries for police camera operators to be on hand when a public disturbance is anticipated ; the police used small @-@ scale fire @-@ extinguishers of the type carried in public vehicles , many of which are routinely on the square . 
 = = Dispute = = 
 Following the incident , the details of why the individuals were involved has been and remains the subject of dispute between representatives of Falun Gong , the Chinese government , and other observers . 
 A significant challenge to arriving at a definitive assessment of the event is that independent corroboration of the government 's claims has not been possible . According to Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) , the lack of independent information made the incident one of the most difficult stories for reporters in Beijing to report . The New York Times stated that conflicting claims were difficult to assess " [ w ] ith propaganda streaming in from seemingly opposite ends of the universe ... especially since the remaining Falun Gong practitioners have been driven underground . " 
 Philip Pan 's investigation , and other inconsistencies highlighted by Falun Gong organisations , led some journalists and other observers to entertain the possibility that the self @-@ immolation was not as straightforward as the Chinese official media accounts suggested . In the National Review , Ann Noonan of the Laogai Research Foundation suggested that it was " hardly a far @-@ fetched hypothesis " that the government staged the incident or allowed it to proceed to discredit Falun Gong , as the government vowed to crush the practice before the eightieth anniversary celebrations of the Communist Party in July . Clive Ansley , a Vancouver @-@ based rights lawyer who lived in China during the self @-@ immolation , suggested that a dramatic response by Falun Gong would have been understandable , but ultimately concluded that the event was staged : " You 've got Falun Gong people in this country , they 've been oppressed over and over again , they are not allowed to speak , they are not allowed to assert any of their rights as citizens , the level of frustration must be terribly , terribly high .. I can understand people doing that .. but ironically , we ultimately found out that it was staged anyway , it was not <unk> it was completely staged by the government . " 
 In his 2001 book on Falun Gong , journalist Danny Schechter drew on evidence from Falun Gong sources , from Philip Pan , and interviews with other journalists to conclude that the self @-@ immolation was orchestrated by the Chinese government . Citing Schechter 's research , anthropologist Noah Porter wrote that " convincing evidence has been provided that the events described by the Chinese media are at least deceptive , if not a complete hoax , " also stating " even if there were people who lit themselves on fire and considered themselves Falun Gong practitioners , they would not be representative of Falun Gong practitioners . " Beatrice Turpin , a China correspondent with Associated Press Television , said of the self @-@ immolation that " There was a big brouhaha with Falun Gong protests and footage of police beating practitioners last Chinese New Year and it would certainly fit in with typical China strategy to stage an event this year [ 2001 ] and make the show their own . " 
 Reviewing the divergent narratives on the identity of the self @-@ immolation victims , historian David Ownby concluded that " although the arguments of Falun Gong practitioners seem cogent , it is very difficult to arrive at a final judgment about the self @-@ immolation . ... there are desperate people in China ( and elsewhere ) who will do anything for money ( which would go to their families in this case , one supposes , unless the authorities had promised to rescue them before the flames could do harm ) . Or the entire event could have been staged . But it seems just as possible that those who set themselves on fire might have been new or unschooled Falun Gong practitioners , had discovered and practised Falun Gong on their own ( and badly ) in the post @-@ suppression period , and , for whatever reason , decided to make the ultimate sacrifice . " 
 Other human rights activists speculated that the five who set themselves on fire did so to protest the government 's crackdown on Falun Gong . Barend ter Haar was open to the idea that the self @-@ immolators were Falun Gong practitioners , and postulated that former Buddhists may have brought with them the " respectable Buddhist tradition of self @-@ immolation as a sacrifice to the Buddha " . He sought to account for the inconsistencies by suggesting that the government may have fabricated a video of their own when they realised the <unk> potential of the suicides . 
 Francesco <unk> , Asia editor of La Stampa , supported the possibility that the self @-@ immolators were Falun Gong practitioners , writing in the Asia Times that " no one believed that the government could have paid a mother to torch herself and her daughter , or that she was so loyal to the Communist Party that she pretended to be a Falungong member and kill herself and her only daughter , even if Falungong master Li Hongzhi forbade suicide ... " In <unk> 's view , Chinese officials made a mistake by arresting foreign journalists on Tiananmen — " independently filmed news footage of the proceedings could have been the best proof of Falungong madness . Instead , when the government reported the episode , it looked like propaganda . " 
 Time noted some of the confusion surrounding the conflicting views on the self @-@ immolation ; one Beijing Falun Gong practitioner interviewed appeared to accept that the self @-@ immolators were practitioners engaged in protest , while Falun Gong organisations overseas denied any involvement . Time also speculated that the " lack of solidarity " in Falun Gong was contributing to the sense of desperation of Mainland Chinese practitioners who may feel out of touch with the exiled leadership . Guardian reporter John Gittings reported that some observers believed it was possible that the self @-@ immolators acted in desperation and confusion . 
 Some observers have speculated that if the participants were Falun Gong practitioners , they may have resorted to self @-@ immolation in response to the publication of a new scripture by Li Hongzhi released on 1 January 2001 , " Beyond the Limits of <unk> . " An article authored by a collection of Mainland Chinese Falun Gong practitioners and published on the main Chinese @-@ language Falun Gong website noted that the scripture had caused confusion both among Falun Gong practitioners and " in society , " and that some people wondered whether Falun Gong would resort to violence to resist persecution . The authors wrote that this would not occur , as violence would be both counterproductive and contrary to the teachings of the practice . A Falun Gong spokesperson clarified that the new scripture simply meant it was time to " bring truth to light " about human rights abuses committed by the Chinese government . Nonetheless , Gittings posited that the scripture may have confused Falun Gong followers , particularly in Mainland China . Matthew Forney wrote in Time magazine that Li 's message had spread into China via the internet and informal networks of followers , and speculated that it may have galvanised more radical practitioners there . David Ownby wrote that he found the brief message to be " difficult to interpret " : on its surface , the scripture resembled a " call to arms " against what Li described as " evil beings who no longer have any human nature or righteous thoughts . " Yet Ownby said no practitioners he talked to had seen the scripture as a " green light " for violent action . Instead , practitioners had interpreted it to mean that they could resist suppression without guilt ; they could stop " simply surrendering to the police at the first moment of a confrontation . They could run away , they could organize , they were , in a word , free of whatever constraints the necessity to " forbear " had previously placed upon them . " In an interview with the Washington Post , Ownby noted that Li does not endorse suicide in any of his recent statements , " But a practitioner at the end of his or her rope in China could certainly see [ the statements ] as an endorsement for martyrdom , and perhaps choose his or her own means to achieve that . "

 The state media coverage of the event resulted in increased support for the Party 's persecution efforts against Falun Gong , and eroded public sympathy for the group . Time reported that prior to the self @-@ immolation incident , many Chinese had felt that Falun Gong posed no real threat , and that the state 's persecution had gone too far . After the event , however , China 's media campaign against Falun Gong gained significant traction . The World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong reported that hostility toward Falun Gong from the general public escalated , the government had stepped up its campaign , and charged that " hate crimes " targeting Falun Gong increased . One western diplomat commented that the public changed from sympathising with Falun Gong to siding with the Government , popular consensus seemingly shifted by human @-@ interest stories and accounts of rehabilitation efforts of former practitioners . Østergaard believes that , in retrospect , the New Year scripture was Li 's greatest gift to the state , as the self @-@ immolations marked a turning point which ended domestic support for the movement . 
 The self @-@ immolation incident was given prominent coverage in the official Chinese media , which analysts say took a propagandistic line . According to Philip Pan , the Communist Party " launched an all @-@ out campaign to use the incident to prove its claim that Falun Gong is a dangerous cult , and to turn public opinion in China and abroad against the group ... Every morning and night , the state @-@ controlled media carry fresh attacks against Falun Gong and its U.S.-based leader , Li Hongzhi . " Posters , leaflets and videos were produced , detailing the supposed detrimental effects of Falun Gong practice . The New York Times reported that the public was " bombarded with graphic images of the act on television and in newspapers . " In China 's schools , regular anti @-@ Falun Gong classes were scheduled . Eight million students joined the " Anti @-@ Cult Action by the Youth Civilized Communities Across the Nation " . Twelve million children were made to submit writings disapproving of the practice . 
 Within a month of the Tiananmen Square incident , authorities issued a document entitled The whole story of the self @-@ immolation incident created by Falun Gong addicts in Tiananmen Square , containing colour photographs of charred bodies . The State Council 's " Office for the Prevention and Handling of Evil Cults " declared after the event that it was now ready to form a united front with the global anti @-@ cult struggle . Meetings took place in factories , offices , universities and schools , and approved religious leaders across the country had delivered denunciations of Falun Gong . In Kaifeng , the post office issued an anti @-@ Falun Gong postmark , and 10 @,@ 000 people signed a petition denouncing the group . 
 = = = Violence and re @-@ education = = = 
 The Washington Post reported that Chinese authorities benefited from the turn in public opinion against Falun Gong that followed the self @-@ immolation , seizing on the opportunity to sanction " the systematic use of violence against the group . " According to the Post , authorities " established a network of brainwashing classes and embarked on a painstaking effort to weed out followers neighbourhood by neighbourhood and workplace by workplace . " The " reeducation " tactics employed included beatings , shocks with electric truncheons , and intensive anti @-@ Falun Gong study classes . 
 According to a report published in the Wall Street Journal , in February 2001 the 6 @-@ 10 Office " stepped up pressure on local governments " to implement the anti @-@ Falun Gong campaign . In particular , it issued new , detailed instructions requiring that all who continued to actively practice Falun Gong were to be sent to prison or labour camps , and individuals who refused to renounce the practice were to be socially isolated and monitored by their families and workplaces . This was a shift from the past , when local officials sometimes tolerated Falun Gong on the condition that it was practised privately . According to Freedom House , In the year following the incident , the scale of imprisonment , torture , and deaths of Falun Gong practitioners in custody increased significantly . According to Freedom House , " months of relentless propaganda succeeded in turning public opinion against the group .

 The self @-@ immolation necessitated a change in tactics for Falun Gong . Tiananmen Square had been " permanently contaminated " as a venue for protest , according to journalist Ethan Gutmann , and Falun Gong 's daily demonstrations in Beijing nearly ceased altogether . According to Human Rights Watch , practitioners may have concluded " the protests had outlived their usefulness for demonstrating Chinese abuses or for informing an overseas audience of Falungong 's harmlessness . " Diaspora practitioners living overseas focused their attentions on getting the word out about the treatment of practitioners by the Chinese government , issuing reports to the United Nations and human rights organisations , staging public marches and hunger strikes outside of China , and documenting human rights abuses on websites . Within China , practitioners used mass mailings and handed out literature to " spread the truth " and counter the government 's allegations against them . In an August 2001 press release , the US @-@ based Falun Dafa Information Center noted this shift in strategy , and said that Chinese practitioners " sometimes also manage to post large posters and banners in major thoroughfares . They even set up loudspeakers on rooftops or trees around labour camps and in densely populated areas to broadcast news about the human rights abuses . " 
 In 2002 , Falun Gong practitioners in Changchun successfully broadcast the False Fire video on Chinese television , interrupting the station 's scheduled programming for 50 minutes . Liu <unk> , a Falun Gong practitioner who hacked into the satellite feed , was arrested and sentenced to prison , where he died 21 months later , allegedly tortured to death . The remaining five individuals behind the television hijacking were also imprisoned , and all have reportedly died or been tortured to death in custody .

The Guardian reported that on the last day of the one @-@ month trial , Xinhua had , by mid @-@ morning , issued a full report of the verdicts ; the People 's Daily had produced its own editorial by the afternoon . 
 Liu Yunfang , named as the mastermind , was given a life sentence ; Wang Jindong was given 15 years . Two other accomplices – a 49 @-@ year @-@ old man named Xue <unk> , and a 34 @-@ year @-@ old Beijing woman named Liu <unk> who apparently provided the group with lodging and helped in the preparation of the incident – were sentenced to 10 and 7 years in prison respectively . Liu <unk> , who had " acknowledged her crime " , escaped punishment because her role in planning the event was minor . 
 After having long denied foreign media access to the self @-@ immolation victims , in April 2002 the Government arranged for foreign press to interview the purported survivors of the self @-@ immolation in the presence of state officials . The interviewees refuted claims that the self @-@ immolation was staged , showing their burn injuries as evidence , and denounced Falun Gong while expressing support for the authorities ' handling of the group . When asked why they set themselves on fire , Hao <unk> replied that she had realised the futility of writing letters and demonstrating by waving banners , " so finally , we decided ... to make a big event to show our will to the world . ... We wanted to show the government that Falun Gong was good . " At the time of the interview , Chen Guo and her mother were said to still be in the hospital , both having lost their hands , ears and noses . Both her mother 's eyes were covered with skin grafts . Wang Jindong , showing burns to his face , said he felt " humiliated because of my stupidity and fanatical ideas . "

 " East to West " is a contemporary Christian song lasting four minutes and twenty @-@ six seconds . It was written in common time in the key of F ♯ minor at a tempo of 73 beats per minute . The vocal range in the song ranges from the low note of D4 to the high note of F ♯ 5 . Lyrically , " East to West " deals with the concept of forgiveness , and the doubt that God forgives and forgets all sin . Casting Crowns ' lead vocalist Mark Hall explained that : " We have a hard time with the concept of forgiveness . We cut ourselves and it heals , but the scar remains . Sometimes we think God treats sin like we would if we were God , and that he handles forgiveness like we would . We know he forgives , but we can 't accept that God chooses to forget and relinquishes his right to avenge . That 's what we 're singing about in ' East To West ' " . In a separate interview , Hall elaborated on that theme , commenting that : " I see forgiveness as God giving away His right to revenge in my life . He loved me so much that He ’ s choosing to remember that against me no more , all because of Jesus " .

 = St Anne 's Pier = 
 St Anne 's Pier is a Victorian era pleasure pier in the English seaside resort of St Anne 's @-@ on @-@ the @-@ Sea , Lancashire . It lies on the estuary of the River Ribble . The pier , designed by A. Dowson , was completed in 1885 and was one of the earliest public buildings in St Anne 's , a 19th @-@ century planned town . The pier was originally intended to be a sedate <unk> venue for the resort 's visitors , but attractions were later added . Changes made to the estuary channels to improve access to Preston Dock left the pier on dry land and ended its steamer services to Blackpool and Liverpool . 
 A Tudor @-@ style entrance was built in 1899 . Early 20th @-@ century additions included a Moorish @-@ style pavilion in 1904 and the Floral Hall in 1910 . The Moorish Pavilion was destroyed by fire in 1974 , shortly after the town 's centenary ; the Floral Hall burned down in 1982 . Originally 914 feet ( 279 m ) long , the pier was reduced to 600 feet ( 180 m ) by the demolition of the seaward end . English Heritage has designated the pier a Grade II listed building . 
 = = Background = = 
 St Anne 's @-@ on @-@ the @-@ Sea is a planned seaside resort on the Fylde coast , at the mouth of the River Ribble , in Lancashire . It was developed in the 19th century , largely by the St Anne 's Land & Building Company . The company was formed in 1874 and leased land for the new town from the estate of the local Clifton family . Towards the end of the 19th century , pleasure piers became a common feature of English seaside resorts , and by the 1870s there were already two piers in nearby Blackpool , one in Southport and one 3 @.@ 5 miles ( 5 @.@ 6 km ) away in Lytham . The wording of the land company 's original lease indicates that a pier was probably planned for St Anne 's from its beginning . A subsidiary , the St Anne 's @-@ on @-@ the @-@ Sea Pier and Improvements Company was formed in 1877 . The company directors believed that a pier at St Anne 's would offer visitors better conditions for fishing and boating than those at neighbouring resorts . 
 = = Construction = = 
 There was some delay in building the new pier because of an economic downturn . Engineers inspected the site in 1879 , and construction began in 1880 . The architect was A. Dowson . The pier is constructed of cast iron columns and lattice girders with wooden decking and intricate decorative iron @-@ work on the deck . The columns were sunk to a depth of 50 feet ( 15 m ) . The original structure was 914 feet ( 279 m ) long and 19 feet ( 5 @.@ 8 m ) wide . It included a band kiosk built of glass and iron . Construction cost £ 18 @,@ 000 and took more than five years . The pier was opened by Frederick Stanley on 15 June 1885 , in a ceremony attended by local dignitaries , school children , the Preston Militia band , and the Order of Mechanics . The opening featured the launch of a lifeboat named the Laura Janet , whose crew was lost the following year in the Southport and St Anne 's lifeboats disaster . 
 In 1891 a wooden landing jetty at the end of the pier was extended , in an L shape , by engineering and architecture firm Garlick and Sykes . The new iron extension was three storeys high and measured 120 feet ( 37 m ) long by 90 feet ( 27 m ) wide . After its addition , the pier was 945 feet ( 288 m ) in length . The jetty was used for steamer services from Blackpool and Liverpool . The passing of the Ribble Navigation and Preston Dock Act of 1883 led to dredging of the river channels to improve access to Preston Dock . These changes to the estuary meant that the pier was eventually left on dry land , ruining the resort 's steamer trade . 
 A new entrance building was constructed in 1899 to a design by J. D. Harker . This was built in the Mock Tudor style of red brick with imitation timber framing . In 1901 work began to enlarge the pier and add a Moorish @-@ style pavilion . It had a seating capacity of 920 and measured 84 feet ( 26 m ) by 56 feet ( 17 m ) . The width of the pier was increased to 34 feet ( 10 m ) . These additions were also undertaken by Garlick and Sykes and opened on 2 April 1904 . 
 In 1910 , further additions included the Floral Hall , adjacent to the Moorish Pavilion at the seaward end . The hall — a winter garden and concert hall — had a seating capacity of 850 ; it was built of steel and plate glass to a design by Arnold England . 
 = = Attractions = = 
 In the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the developers of St Anne 's were keen to attract a more refined market than Blackpool 's working @-@ class <unk> . The pier was originally intended to provide little more than a sedate <unk> facility for the resort 's visitors ; initially the only other attractions were a band kiosk and a sweet shop . 
 The pier 's Floral Hall hosted concerts and music hall acts . Its first resident orchestra was Miss Kate Erl and Her Ladies Orchestra . Subsequent conductors of the pier 's orchestra were Clarice Dunnington , William Rees , Lionel Johns and Norman George . Artists who have performed on the pier include Gracie Fields , Leslie Henson , Russ Conway and George Formby . 
 In 1954 , an amusement arcade was added to the pier ; this now occupies three quarters of the length of the structure . Alterations later that decade included the addition of a restaurant and replacement of the decking . By the 1970s the pier 's amusements included crazy golf , a miniature zoo and live theatre performances . 
 = = Damage and recent history = = 
 In 1962 the holdings of the St Anne 's Land & Building Company ( including the pier ) were bought by the Amalgamated Investment Company , based in London . Some alterations to the pier were made by the new owners , including the addition of an aviary and a reptile house . The Floral Hall was refurbished and turned into a Tyrolean @-@ style beer garden . 
 A centenary concert for the town by violinist Yehudi Menuhin was held on 7 June 1974 and attended by Anne , Princess Royal . On the night of 20 July , the Moorish Pavilion ( known from 1970 as the Sultan 's Palace ) was destroyed in a fire . 
 On 6 December 1976 , following the liquidation of the Amalgamated Investment Company , the pier was bought by the Webb family for £ 30 @,@ 000 . They initially planned to repair the fire damage . The Floral Hall , which had been adjacent to the Moorish Pavilion , was destroyed by fire on 23 July 1982 ; the pavilions were deemed irreparable and the seaward end of the pier was demolished . Following protests against the demolition by campaigners , the local council decided that the final 150 feet ( 46 m ) should be retained to protect the character of the pier , so the remains of the ruined landing jetty still exist . The pier , most of which is enclosed , now ends with an uncovered stretch of deck that opens out into two hexagonal platforms with small pavilions and shelters . The length of the remaining intact structure is 600 feet ( 180 m ) . The pier 's 21st @-@ century attractions include the amusement arcade , cafés and shops ; the seaward end is usually closed to visitors . 
 English Heritage designated St Anne 's Pier a Grade II listed building on 21 September 1973 . It is listed as part of a group of promenade structures that includes a bandstand , a lifeboat monument , a pavilion and two shelters . Lynn F. Pearson ( 1991 ) writes that the pier 's Moorish Pavilion and Floral Hall were " two of the best [ pier pavilions ] in design terms " . According to Chris Mawson and Richard Riding ( 2008 ) , the pier is " well regarded " for its wrought iron work . 
 = Battle of San Marino = 
 The Battle of San Marino was an engagement on 17 – 20 September 1944 during the Italian Campaign of the Second World War , in which German Army forces occupied the neutral Republic of San Marino , and were then attacked by Allied forces . It is also sometimes known as the Battle of Monte <unk> . 
 San Marino had declared its neutrality earlier in the war , and had remained broadly unaffected by events in Europe until 1944 , when Allied forces had advanced a sizable distance up the Italian Peninsula . A major German defensive position , the Gothic Line , ran across the peninsula a short distance south of the Sammarinese border , and in late June , the country was bombed by the Royal Air Force , killing 35 people , in the belief that the German army had taken up positions on its territory . In Operation Olive , launched in late August , a strong Allied force attacked at the very eastern end of the line , aiming to pass through Rimini — just east of San Marino — and break out onto the plains north of the city . Whilst San Marino was southwest of Rimini , the plan was for it to be bypassed entirely . In response to the Allied movements , the Germans sent a small force into San Marino to guard their lines of communication and act as artillery observers . 
 After a few days , the main thrust of the offensive was halted south of Rimini by strong resistance and severe weather , and the British and Indian flanking forces began to push westwards , taking the frontline towards San Marino . On 17 September the 4th Indian Infantry Division attacked forces of the 278 . Infanterie @-@ Division holding two hills just across the Sammarinese border ; after heavy fighting to gain control of the hills , the situation stabilised on the 19th , and Allied forces began to push into the city of San Marino itself . The city was captured by the afternoon of 20 September , and the 4th Indian Division left the country on the 21st , leaving it under the control of the local defence forces . 
 = = Background = = 
 The microstate of San Marino , in the northern Italian peninsula and fully surrounded by Italy , had played little role throughout the Second World War . It had a fascist government , closely aligned with Benito Mussolini 's regime , but remained neutral . It was reported to have declared war against the United Kingdom in September 1940 , though the Sammarinese government later transmitted a message to the British government stating that it had not . In early 1942 , the Sammarinese government reiterated it was not at war with the United States , a position that was confirmed by the US State Department . The British Foreign Office noted more equivocally in 1944 that Britain had never declared war , but also had never formally recognised San Marino 's neutrality , and that it felt that military action on Sammarinese territory would be justified if it were being used by Axis forces . 
 The country was bombed by the Allies on 27 June 1944 , killing at least 35 . The Sammarinese government declared the same day that no military installations or equipment were located on its territory , and that no belligerent forces had been allowed to enter . In early July , it announced that prominent signs had been put up at the border crossings by the German command , to instruct German units not to enter the territory , and again reiterated its complete neutrality . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 = = = Assault on the Gothic Line = = = 
 By the late summer of 1944 , German forces in Italy had withdrawn toward the Gothic Line , a chain of defended positions stretching across the Italian peninsula . The Allies formulated a plan to break through the defences , pushing north toward Rimini and the plains of Northern Italy . This would involve a strong thrust up the eastern seaboard by the British Eighth Army , codenamed Operation Olive ; 11 divisions would attack along a narrow front , converging on the " Rimini Gap " , an 8 mi ( 13 km ) stretch of plain along the coast around the city , and then moving northward . Once through the Gap , the force would deploy outward onto the Romagna Plain , and move westward toward Bologna . Meanwhile , the American Fifth Army would push north along the centre of the peninsula , hopefully converging on Bologna and trapping a large German force in a pincer movement . 
 The main Allied assault began on 25 August , reaching the Foglia valley — the Gothic Line proper — on 29 August . It was quickly breached , and the German command attempted to assemble a second defensive line on the Coriano ridge , a hilly spur to the north of the <unk> river , and the last major geographic obstacle south of Rimini . The Allied offensive reached the river on 3 September , but ground to a halt due to mechanical difficulties with its tanks , strengthening German resistance , and heavy rain . The Allied forces halted , and brought up reinforcements whilst waiting for a chance to resume the offensive along the coast . On the left flank of the assault , the attack had been halted in the Battle of Gemmano , to the south of the <unk> river . 
 At this point , the forces on the Allied left wing were strung out in a line running due south from the Coriano ridge , facing westward toward San Marino , a few miles distant . The 56th ( London ) Infantry Division was opposite Croce , with the 46th Infantry Division opposite the heavily defended position at Gemmano . The 4th Indian Infantry Division was to the south of the 46th , forming the very left wing of the offensive . When the assault on Coriano was resumed on the 12th , led by two armoured divisions with heavy artillery support , these forces pushed westwards ; their goal was to pass through towards the town of Montescudo , about two miles from the Sammarinese border . The main assault successfully pushed onto the ridge , and the 56th Division advanced about 1 mi ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) past Croce , before digging in on the evening of the 13th ; that night , the 4th Indian Division gained a foothold south of Gemmano . It was finally captured by the 46th and 4th Indian Divisions on the morning of the 15th , and the British forces prepared to move toward Montescudo and exploit the German confusion . 
 = = Battle = = 
 = = = Entry into San Marino = = = 
 The 46th Division took Montescudo on the 15th , and on the next day the 56th Division entered the town of <unk> , directly north of Montescudo and equally close to the border . The fighting pressed westward from here , with the 56th Division on the northern flank and the 46th on the south ; both were held back by strong German resistance . 
 In early September , the German Army had sent a strong force into San Marino to defend it against the Allies ; this would also give them control of one of the major roads in the area , and allow artillery observers to occupy the mountain peaks . The defending force was drawn from the 278 . Infanterie @-@ Division , whilst the 4th Indian Division was assigned to attack it on the 17th . 
 The leading elements of the division — the 3rd / 10th Baluch Regiment — crossed the <unk> River on the eastern border on the night of the 17th , with the 1st / 9th Gurkha Rifles moving through them to attack Points 343 and 366 near <unk> . These small hills — just behind the river — were held by two battalions of the <unk> Grenadier Regiment . The first — Point 343 — was taken at 05 : 00 , but the force occupying Point 366 had to fall back after running low on ammunition . Rifleman Sher Bahadur Thapa was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for holding the crest of the hill single @-@ handed for two hours , allowing two companies to withdraw in safety , before being killed whilst trying to rescue another wounded Gurkha . 
 Point 343 was held through the 18th , however , though with the loss of 63 men ; by the evening , a force of tanks had managed to come up and stabilise the position with the aid of artillery support . The 4th / 11th Sikh Regiment moved around the Gurkhas to the north , covering the northern flank of the San Marino heights , and the division 's 11th Brigade passed through them to help encircle the city . On the evening of the 19th , the 2nd Battalion , Queen 's Own Cameron Highlanders of 11th Indian Infantry Brigade began to push into the outskirts of the city from the north , but early on the morning of the 20th were held back by defensive positions in the north @-@ west of the city , where the road to the upper part of the city , situated higher on the mountain , began . Tanks moved into the suburbs , whilst a company of the Camerons moved uphill toward the summit in heavy rain . The city was secured by the early afternoon , with only 24 casualties among the attackers , and 54 prisoners taken . 
 On the 21st , the local defence forces were enlisted to help mop up straggling German troops , and the 4th Indian Division pressed onward through a heavy gale and passed out of the country . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Allied forces remained in occupation of San Marino for a short period following the German surrender . In October 1945 , after the end of the war , the Sammarinese government submitted a claim for 732 million lira to the British government for wartime compensation , of which 500 million lira were given as the related costs of the fighting in September and 20 million lira as the costs of the occupation . The British government rejected this claim , arguing that as Germany had breached the Sammarinese neutrality before Allied troops had entered the country , it was not liable ; it did , however , offer an ex gratia payment of £ 26 @,@ 000 in regard to the June bombing , later increased to £ 80 @,@ 000 . 
 The battle honour " San Marino " was awarded to three British Army units — the Royal Lincolnshire Regiment , the York and Lancaster Regiment , and the Queen 's Own Cameron Highlanders — and two Indian Army units , the 1st / 9th Gurkha Rifles and the 4th / 11th Sikh Regiment . The latter three of these had fought as part of 4th Indian Division in the main attack , whilst the first two had had battalions in the 138th Infantry Brigade of 46th Division . 
 = John Troglita = 
 John Troglita ( Latin : Ioannes Troglita , Greek : Ἰωάννης <unk> ) was a 6th @-@ century Byzantine general . He participated in the Vandalic War and served in North Africa as a regional military governor during the years 533 – 538 , before being sent east to the wars with the Sassanid Persians . As dux Mesopotamiae , Troglita distinguished himself in several battles , and was noticed by agents of the Byzantine emperor , Justinian I ( r . 527 – 565 ) . In summer 546 , Justinian chose John Troglita to assume overall command of Byzantine forces in Africa , where a succession of revolts by the indigenous Moorish tribes and within the imperial army itself had seriously reduced the Byzantine position . Troglita quickly secured an initial victory in the winter of 546 / 547 against the Moors of Byzacena , but was defeated in summer 547 by the tribes of Tripolitania , and Africa was once again laid open to destructive raids . Troglita reorganized his army and secured the assistance of some tribal leaders , and confronted and decisively defeated the tribal coalition at the Fields of Cato in summer 548 . This victory spelled the end of the Moorish revolt , and heralded an era of peace for Africa . Troglita was also involved in the Gothic War , twice sending some of his troops to Italy to assist against the Ostrogoths . 
 John Troglita 's exploits , especially against the Moors in Africa , are the subject of the last Latin epic poem of Antiquity , the Iohannis , seu de Bellis <unk> ( " Tale of John , or On the Libyan War " ) of Flavius Cresconius Corippus , which is the main source on his life . 
 = = Origins and early career in Africa and the East = = 
 The exact origins of John Troglita are unclear . He may have been born in Thrace , but his peculiar surname might indicate provenance from <unk> ( Greek : <unk> ) in Macedonia . According to information provided by the 6th @-@ century historian Procopius of Caesarea and Troglita 's panegyrist Flavius Cresconius Corippus , he was the son of a certain <unk> , and had at least one brother named Pappus . Troglita himself married a " daughter of a king " , probably a barbarian chieftain , and had a son , Peter . 
 John Troglita is first mentioned as having participated in the Vandalic War ( 533 – 534 ) under Belisarius , and may be identifiable with another John , who commanded a unit of foederati in the battles of Ad Decimum and Tricamarum . Troglita remained in the province of Africa after Belisarius 's departure in 534 , and participated in the expeditions of Solomon against the Moors in 534 – 535 . At the time , he was probably the local military governor ( dux ) in either Byzacena or , more probably , Tripolitania , for he is mentioned as leading successful expeditions against the Leuathae tribe . Troglita also fought against the mutinous army under the renegade Stotzas , participating in the first victory under Belisarius at <unk> in 536 , and then , under Solomon 's successor Germanus , in the decisive battle at Scalas Veteres in spring 537 . In this battle , he was one of the commanders of the cavalry on the Byzantine army 's right wing , which according to the historian Procopius was defeated and driven off by Stotzas 's men , losing its standards in the process . Nevertheless , the battle resulted in an imperial victory . In 538 , Troglita distinguished himself in the Battle of <unk> , probably in the Byzacena . 
 At some point after 538 , Troglita was sent to the Eastern frontier , where by 541 he was appointed dux Mesopotamiae , one of the most important military commands of the region . From this position , he arrested a member of the embassy sent by the Ostrogothic king <unk> to the Persians to incite them to attack Byzantium . When war broke out , according to Corippus John scored a number of successes against the Persian army : he defeated the general <unk> near Nisibis , led his army in a successful night attack against the Persian force besieging Theodosiopolis , and then defeated another Persian army besieging Dara , capturing its general , Mihr @-@ Mihroe . Procopius , however , gives a different account of the first battle , indicating that Troglita had to be saved from a sudden Persian attack by Belisarius , and does not mention the other two incidents at all . Nevertheless , Corippus maintains that John was congratulated for his performance by Urbicius , one of Emperor Justinian 's advisors who had been sent to supervise the war . 
 = = High command in Africa = = 
 During Troglita 's absence from Africa , the situation had been turbulent . Germanus had remained in the province until 539 , and succeeded in restoring discipline in the army and pacifying the core territories of Africa <unk> and Byzacena . He was succeeded by Solomon , who began his second tenure with great success , defeating the Moors of the Aurès Mountains and establishing control over Numidia and Mauretania Sitifensis . However , the Moorish revolt flared up again in 543 and Solomon was killed in the Battle of Cillium in 544 . His successor , his nephew Sergius , was incompetent . He was defeated by the Moors , recalled and replaced with the senator Areobindus , who was murdered in spring 546 in another military revolt led by the general Guntharic . The latter intended to declare himself independent of Constantinople , but was soon murdered by the Armenian Artabanes . The need for a new and capable leader in Africa was apparent to Constantinople . After a truce was signed with Persia in 546 , Emperor Justinian , perhaps , as Corippus implies , acting on Urbicius 's advice , recalled Troglita from the East . After having him report on the situation there in Constantinople , the Emperor placed him at the head of a new army and sent him to Africa as the new magister militum per <unk> in late summer 546 . 
 = = = Suppression of the Moorish revolt = = = 
 In late 546 , when John Troglita reached Carthage , the situation was dire : the imperial troops , under Marcentius the dux of Byzacena and Gregory the Armenian in Carthage , were few in number and demoralized . They held out in the coastal cities , blockaded by the Moors of Byzacena under their chieftain Antalas , while the Leuathae and <unk> tribes from Tripolitania were raiding Byzacena with impunity . Diplomatic efforts , however , secured the allegiance of the Moorish leaders Cutzinas and Ifisdaias , who joined the imperial army with several thousands of their men . In addition , the tribesmen of the Aurès Mountains under Iaudas withdrew to Numidia on learning of Troglita 's arrival and pursued a course of armed neutrality . 
 Upon his arrival in Carthage , Troglita reorganized his troops , bolstering the local forces with the veterans he had brought with him – mostly horse archers and cataphracts – and marched out to meet the rebels . At Antonia Castra , emissaries from Antalas presented themselves , but Troglita rejected their terms and imprisoned them . The Byzantine army marched into Byzacena , relieved the beleaguered cities and joined up with Marcentius . The Moors , taken by surprise by the imperial army 's swift advance , withdrew again to the mountainous and wooded interior , where they gathered their forces under the leadership of <unk> of the Leuathae and Antalas . Corippus suggests that they hoped that Troglita would not maintain his pursuit in the midst of winter , and that they would have the advantage over the imperial army in this terrain . Troglita encamped near the Moorish positions and dispatched an envoy , <unk> , to bring Antalas his terms : the general offered amnesty in exchange for submitting to imperial authority again . 
 Corippus narrates the subsequent battle at length , but his imitation of Virgilian verse provides little concrete detail : it is clear that it was a long , indecisive , and bloody conflict , which probably took place to the south or east of <unk> in late 546 or early 547 . Eventually , the Byzantines prevailed and drove back the Moors , breaking through their defences and storming their camp . According to Corippus , <unk> , who was the chief priest of the god <unk> , was killed while trying to protect an image of the god . Many other tribal leaders fell , and the remainder scattered . The remains of the Tripolitanian tribes abandoned Byzacena , and Antalas was forced to lay down arms . In addition , many prisoners were released from the Moorish camp , and among the treasures captured there were the military standards lost by Solomon at Cillium in 544 . These were dispatched to Constantinople , while Troglita held a triumphal entry into Carthage .

 With this victory , the war seemed won , and peace re @-@ established in Africa . A few months later , however , the tribes of Tripolitania reassembled and formed a coalition under the king of the <unk> , Carcasan . After raiding Tripolitania , they turned west to raid Byzacena again . Notified of this by Rufinus , the dux of Tripolitania , Troglita marched out to meet them . The Byzantine army had been weakened in the meantime by the need to reinforce Belisarius against the Goths in Italy : of the nine regiments Troglita had brought with him from Constantinople , three were dispatched to Italy . The Moors under Antalas remained hostile but did not immediately join the conflict for the moment , but the Byzantines were deprived of the services of Ifisdaias , who refused to commit his men . Despite the hot summer , Troglita marched his men quickly to the southern limit of Byzacena , along the edge of the desert , hoping to meet the Moors there and prevent the long @-@ suffering province from being ravaged again . The Moors initially withdrew into the arid interior , hoping to shake him off , but Troglita 's army , accompanied by a caravan with water and provisions , followed them into the desert . Both armies suffered from thirst and hunger , and discontent spread among the Byzantine soldiers . Finally , a near mutiny erupted when an epidemic killed off a large part of the army 's horses , forcing Troglita to turn again north towards the coast . 
 There , Troglita positioned himself between the Matmata plateau and the coast , and awaited the Moors . He also sent for ships to bring supplies , but adverse winds made this impossible . When the Moorish army appeared nearby it was likewise exhausted from hunger and made for some sources of water , which Troglita set out to reach first . The Byzantines camped at Marta in the district of Gallica , where battle was joined . It was a disastrous defeat for the Byzantines , whose army broke and fled . Corippus , possibly in an attempt to exculpate his hero Troglita , attributes the defeat to the indiscipline of some soldiers , who attacked the enemy before the army was ready , leading to a disorganized piecemeal engagement . According to Corippus 's account , the Moorish allies of the Byzantines panicked first and retreated , causing the entire army to disintegrate , despite the personal intervention of Troglita and the other Byzantine leaders . 
 Following this defeat , Troglita fled to Iunci ( modern Bordj <unk> , 9 km south of <unk> ) , where he began regrouping the survivors . The losses were so high and the army 's morale so low , however , that he was soon forced to withdraw further north to the fortress of <unk> ( the modern village of <unk> , near Le <unk> ) , where he started mustering his army . Learning of the battle , Antalas immediately rose up again and joined the Tripolitanian tribes , while the Byzantines ' allies , Cutzinas and Isfidaias , were quarreling among themselves . Throughout the remainder of 547 , the Moors were free to raid across Africa , even reaching the vicinity of Carthage itself . 
 = = = = Battle of the Fields of Cato = = = = 
 Troglita did not remain inactive : from Carthage , the praetorian prefect Athanasius and Troglita 's young son organized reinforcements and supplies for the camp at <unk> , while Troglita himself succeeded not only in reconciling Cutzinas and Isfidaias , but also in gaining the allegiance of King Iaudas and his tribe . In the spring of 548 , Troglita , having regrouped his forces , met with his Moorish allies at the plain of <unk> on the northern limits of Byzacena . Corippus gives extraordinary numbers for the native contingents provided by each chief : 30 @,@ 000 for Cutzinas , 100 @,@ 000 for Isfidaias , and 12 @,@ 000 under Iaudas 's brother . Whatever the real numbers , it seems clear that Troglita 's regular troops formed the lesser portion of the imperial army . 
 The tribes , under the leadership of Carcasan and Antalas , had encamped in central Byzacena , in the plain of Mamma or Mammes . Carcasan , confident after his victory the previous year , wanted to confront the imperial army immediately , but as it happened he gave way to Antalas , who advocated the more cautious and well @-@ tried Moorish tactic of withdrawing and drawing the Byzantines into the interior , forcing them to march far from their supply bases and through a devastated country , thus exhausting and demoralizing them . The rebels thus retreated south and east , reaching Iunci after ten days . Troglita 's army pursued them at some distance , only exchanging a few blows with the tribes ' rearguard . Once the Byzantine army reached the plain before Iunci and laid camp , however , the Moors again withdrew into the mountainous interior . Having been informed by a spy of his enemy 's strategy , Troglita refused to follow , and remained encamped near the port of <unk> , from where he could be easily resupplied . Nevertheless , discontent grew among the soldiers , who did not understand their leader 's reluctance to fight : the army mutinied and attacked the tent of Troglita , who was barely able to escape . Thanks to the allied Moorish contingents , who remained steadfast , Troglita was able to reimpose control over his men . 
 Troglita now moved his army to confront the enemy , who were encamped at a plain called the Fields of Cato . The Moorish camp had been heavily fortified , and Troglita was reluctant to launch a direct assault . He therefore blockaded it , hoping that hunger would force the Moors to fight him in open battle . To further encourage them , he restrained his men , feigning a reluctance to fight . Troglita 's plan worked : encouraged by sacrifices to their gods and hoping to catch the imperial army unprepared , the Moors attacked the Byzantine camp on a Sunday . The battle hung long in the balance , with many dead on both sides , but eventually the Byzantines gained the upper hand . At this point , Carcasan rallied his forces and launched a fierce counterattack , but was killed by Troglita himself . Seeing their leader fall , the Moors broke and fled . The battle was a resounding success for the Byzantines : seventeen of the Moors ' principal leaders were dead , the Tripolitanian tribes were decimated and withdrew to the desert , and Antalas and his followers submitted to Troglita . Byzacena , Numidia , and Tripolitania were finally secured , and a period of peace was inaugurated that lasted for the next fourteen years , until 562 . 
 = = = Later activities = = = 
 At about this time , Troglita seems to have been promoted to the honorific court rank of patricius , as attested by the 6th @-@ century historian Jordanes ( Romana 385 ) . He remained in command in Africa for at least another four years , beginning the difficult work of reconstruction . Troglita re @-@ established the civil administrative apparatus as originally envisaged by Emperor Justinian in 533 , sharing his authority with the prefect Athanasius . The provincial fortifications built by Solomon were restored , and the subdued Moorish tribes carefully returned to a status of vassalage as imperial foederati . According to the scholar John B. Bury , Troglita 's record in re @-@ establishing order and tranquility in the troubled province make him , along with Belisarius and Solomon , " the third hero of the Imperial reoccupation of Africa " . 
 Troglita 's success in restoring peace to Africa can be seen from the fact that in late 551 , when Totila , king of the Ostrogoths , captured Sardinia and Corsica , Troglita was able to spare enough forces and send a fleet to reclaim them , albeit without success . The exact date of Troglita 's death is unknown , but it is most likely that he died in 552 or soon after .

 Mount Baker ( Lummi : <unk> ’ mə <unk> ; Nooksack : Kw ’ eq <unk> or <unk> ) , also known as Koma Kulshan or simply Kulshan , is an active glaciated andesitic stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc and the North Cascades of Washington in the United States . Mount Baker has the second @-@ most thermally active crater in the Cascade Range after Mount Saint Helens . About 31 miles ( 50 km ) due east of the city of Bellingham , Whatcom County , Mount Baker is the youngest volcano in the Mount Baker volcanic field . While volcanism has persisted here for some 1 @.@ 5 million years , the current glaciated cone is likely no more than 140 @,@ 000 years old , and possibly no older than 80 @-@ 90 @,@ 000 years . Older volcanic edifices have mostly eroded away due to glaciation . 
 After Mount Rainier , Mount Baker is the most heavily glaciated of the Cascade Range volcanoes ; the volume of snow and ice on Mount Baker , 0 @.@ 43 cu mi ( 1 @.@ 79 km3 ) is greater than that of all the other Cascades volcanoes ( except Rainier ) combined . It is also one of the snowiest places in the world ; in 1999 , Mount Baker Ski Area , located 14 km ( 8 @.@ 7 mi ) to the northeast , set the world record for recorded snowfall in a single season — 1 @,@ 140 in ( 2 @,@ 900 cm ) . 
 At 10 @,@ 781 ft ( 3 @,@ 286 m ) , it is the third @-@ highest mountain in Washington State and the fifth @-@ highest in the Cascade Range , if Little Tahoma Peak , a <unk> of Mount Rainier , and <unk> , a <unk> of Mount Shasta , are not counted . Located in the Mount Baker Wilderness , it is visible from much of Greater Victoria , Nanaimo , British Columbia , Greater Vancouver , and , to the south , from Seattle ( and on clear days Tacoma ) in Washington . 
 Indigenous natives have known the mountain for thousands of years , but the first written record of the mountain is from the Spanish . Spanish explorer Gonzalo Lopez de Haro mapped it in 1790 as the Gran Montaña del Carmelo , " Great Mount Carmel " . The explorer George Vancouver renamed the mountain for 3rd Lieutenant Joseph Baker of HMS Discovery , who saw it on April 30 , 1792 .

 Mount Baker was well @-@ known to indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest . Indigenous names for the mountain include Koma Kulshan or Kulshan ( Lummi , <unk> ’ mə , " white sentinel " , i.e. " mountain " , and <unk> : n , " puncture wound " , i.e. " crater " ) ; <unk> Sam @-@ ik ( Nooksack : kw ’ eq <unk> , " white mountain " ) ; <unk> ( Skagit : <unk> ’ , " white sentinel " , i.e. " mountain " ) ; and <unk> or <unk> ( in the language of the unidentified " Koma tribe " ) . 
 In 1790 , Manuel Quimper of the Spanish Navy set sail from Nootka , a temporary settlement on Vancouver Island , with orders to explore the newly discovered Strait of Juan de Fuca . Accompanying Quimper was first @-@ pilot Gonzalo Lopez de Haro , who drew detailed charts during the six @-@ week expedition . Although Quimper 's journal of the voyage does not refer to the mountain , one of Haro 's manuscript charts includes a sketch of Mount Baker . The Spanish named the snowy volcano " La Gran Montana del Carmelo " , as it reminded them of the white @-@ clad monks of the Carmelite Monastery . 
 The British explorer George Vancouver left England a year later . His mission was to survey the northwest coast of America . Vancouver and his crew reached the Pacific Northwest coast in 1792 . While anchored in Dungeness Bay on the south shore of the Strait of Juan de Fuca , third lieutenant Joseph Baker made an observation of Mount Baker , which Vancouver recorded in his journal : 
 About this time a very high conspicuous craggy mountain ... presented itself , towering above the clouds : as low down as they allowed it to be visible it was covered with snow ; and south of it , was a long ridge of very rugged snowy mountains , much less elevated , which seemed to stretch to a considerable distance ... the high distant land formed , as already observed , like detached islands , amongst which the lofty mountain , discovered in the afternoon by the third lieutenant , and in compliment to him called by me Mount Baker , rose a very conspicuous object ... apparently at a very remote distance . 
 Six years later , the official narrative of this voyage was published , including the first printed reference to the mountain . By the mid @-@ 1850s , Mount Baker was a well @-@ known feature on the horizon to the explorers and fur traders who traveled in the Puget Sound region . Isaac I. Stevens , the first governor of Washington Territory , wrote about Mount Baker in 1853 : 
 Mount Baker ... is one of the loftiest and most conspicuous peaks of the northern Cascade range ; it is nearly as high as Mount Rainier , and like that mountain , its snow @-@ covered pyramid has the form of a sugar @-@ loaf . It is visible from all the water and islands ... [ in Puget Sound ] and from the whole southeastern part of the Gulf of Georgia , and likewise from the eastern division of the Strait of Juan de Fuca . It is for this region a natural and important landmark .

 Edmund Thomas Coleman , an Englishman who resided in Victoria , British Columbia , Canada and a veteran of the Alps , made the first attempt to ascend the mountain in 1866 . He chose a route via the Skagit River , but was forced to turn back when local Native Americans refused him passage . 
 Later that same year , Coleman recruited Whatcom County settlers Edward Eldridge , John Bennett and John Tennant to aid him in his second attempt to scale the mountain . After approaching via the North Fork of the Nooksack River , the party navigated through what is now known as Coleman Glacier and ascended to within several hundred feet of the summit before turning back in the face of an " overhanging cornice of ice " and threatening weather . Coleman later returned to the mountain after two years . At 4 : 00 p.m. on August 17 , 1868 , Coleman , Eldridge , Tennant and two new companions ( David Ogilvy and Thomas Stratton ) scaled the summit via the Middle Fork Nooksack River , Marmot Ridge , Coleman Glacier , and the north margin of the Roman Wall .

 The present @-@ day cone of Mount Baker is relatively young ; it is perhaps less than 100 @,@ 000 years old . The volcano sits atop a similar older volcanic cone called Black Buttes , which was active between 500 @,@ 000 and 300 @,@ 000 years ago . Much of Mount Baker 's earlier geological record eroded away during the last ice age ( which culminated 15 @,@ 000 – 20 @,@ 000 years ago ) , by thick ice sheets that filled the valleys and surrounded the volcano . In the last 14 @,@ 000 years , the area around the mountain has been largely ice @-@ free , but the mountain itself remains heavily covered with snow and ice . 
 Isolated ridges of lava and hydrothermally altered rock , especially in the area of Sherman Crater , are exposed between glaciers on the upper flanks of the volcano ; the lower flanks are steep and heavily vegetated . Volcanic rocks of Mount Baker and Black Buttes rest on a foundation of non @-@ volcanic rocks . 
 Deposits recording the last 14 @,@ 000 years at Mount Baker indicate that Mount Baker has not had highly explosive eruptions like those of other volcanoes in the Cascade Volcanic Arc , such as Mount St. Helens , Mount Meager or Glacier Peak , nor has it erupted frequently . During this period , four episodes of magmatic eruptive activity have been recently recognized . 
 Magmatic eruptions have produced tephra , pyroclastic flows , and lava flows from summit vents and the <unk> Meadow cinder cone . The most destructive and most frequent events at Mount Baker have been lahars or debris flows and debris avalanches ; many , if not most , of these were not related to magmatic eruptions but may have been induced by magma intrusion , steam eruptions , earthquakes , gravitational instability , or possibly even heavy rainfall .

 Research beginning in the late 1990s shows that Mount Baker is the youngest of several volcanic centers in the area and one of the youngest volcanoes in the Cascade Range . The Pliocene Hannegan caldera is preserved 16 miles ( 25 km ) northeast of Mount Baker Volcanic activity in the Mount Baker volcanic field began more than one million years ago , but many of the earliest lava and tephra deposits have been removed by glacial erosion . The pale @-@ colored rocks northeast of the modern volcano mark the site of the ancient ( 1 @.@ 15 million years old ) Kulshan caldera that collapsed after an enormous ash eruption one million years ago . Subsequently , eruptions in the Mount Baker area have produced cones and lava flows of andesite , the rock that constitutes much of other Cascade Range volcanoes such as Rainier , Adams , and Hood . From about 900 @,@ 000 years ago to the present , numerous andesitic volcanic centers in the area have come and disappeared through glacial erosion . The largest of these cones is the Black Buttes edifice , active between 500 @,@ 000 and 300 @,@ 000 years ago and formerly bigger than today 's Mount Baker . 
 = = = = Modern craters and cone = = = = 
 Mount Baker was built from stacks of lava and volcanic breccia prior to the end of the last glacial period , which ended about 15 @,@ 000 years ago . There are two craters on the mountain . Ice @-@ filled Carmelo Crater is under the summit ice dome . This crater is the source for the last cone @-@ building eruptions The highest point of Mount Baker , Grant Peak , is on the exposed southeast rim of Carmelo Crater , which is a small pile of andesitic scoria lying on top of a stack of lava flows just below . Carmelo Crater is deeply dissected on its south side by the younger Sherman Crater . This crater is south of the summit , and its ice @-@ covered floor is 1 @,@ 000 ft ( 300 m ) below the summit ice dome . This crater is the site of all Holocene eruptive activity . Hundreds of fumaroles vent gases , primarily H 
 2O , CO

 2S . 
 Lava flows from the summit vent erupted between 30 @,@ 000 and 10 @,@ 000 years ago and , during the final stages of edifice construction , blocky pyroclastic flows entered the volcano 's southeastern drainages . An eruption from Sherman Crater 6 @,@ 600 years ago erupted a blanket of ash that extended more than 40 mi ( 64 km ) to the east . Today , sulfurous gases reach the surface via two fumarole pathways : Dorr <unk> , northeast of the summit ; and Sherman Crater , south of the summit . Both are sites of hydrothermal alteration , converting lavas to weak , white @-@ to @-@ yellow clays ; sulfur is a common mineral around these fumaroles . At Sherman Crater , collapses of this weakened rock generated lahars in the 1840s .

 Approximately 6 @,@ 600 years ago , a series of discrete events culminated in the largest tephra @-@ producing eruption in post @-@ glacial time at Mount Baker . This is the last episode of undoubted magmatic activity preserved in the geologic record . First , the largest collapse in the history of the volcano occurred from the Roman Wall and transformed into a lahar that was over 300 feet ( 91 m ) deep in the upper reaches of the Middle Fork of the Nooksack River . It was at least 25 ft ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) deep 30 mi ( 48 km ) downstream from the volcano . At that time the Nooksack River is believed to have drained north into the Fraser River ; it is therefore unlikely that this lahar reached Bellingham Bay . Next , a small hydrovolcanic eruption occurred at Sherman Crater , triggering a second collapse of the flank just east of the Roman Wall . That collapse also became a lahar that mainly followed the course of the first lahar for at least 20 mi ( 32 km ) , and also spilled into tributaries of the Baker River . Finally , an eruption cloud deposited ash as far as 40 mi ( 64 km ) downwind to the northeast and east . 
 = = = = Historical activity = = = = 
 Several eruptions occurred from Sherman Crater during the 19th century ; they were witnessed from the Bellingham area . A possible eruption was seen in June 1792 during the Spanish expedition of Dionisio Alcalá Galiano and Cayetano Valdés . Their report read , in part : 
 During the night [ while anchored in Bellingham Bay ] we constantly saw light to the south and east of the mountain of Carmelo [ Baker ] and even at times some bursts of flame , signs which left no doubt that there are volcanoes with strong eruptions in those mountains . 
 In 1843 , explorers reported a widespread layer of newly fallen rock fragments " like a snowfall " and that the forest was " on fire for miles around " . It is highly unlikely that these fires were caused by ashfall , however , as charred material is not found with deposits of this fine @-@ grained volcanic ash , which was almost certainly cooled in the atmosphere before falling . Rivers south of the volcano were reportedly clogged with ash , and Native Americans reported that many salmon perished . Reports of flooding on the Skagit River from the eruption are , however , probably greatly exaggerated . A short time later , two collapses of the east side of Sherman Crater produced two lahars , the first and larger of which flowed into the natural Baker Lake , increasing its level by at least 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) . The location of the 19th @-@ century lake is now covered by waters of the modern dam @-@ impounded Baker Lake . Similar but lower level hydrovolcanic activity at Sherman Crater continued intermittently for several decades afterward . On 26 November 1860 , passengers who were traveling by steamer from New Westminster to Victoria reported that Mount Baker was " puffing out large volumes of smoke , which upon breaking , rolled down the snow @-@ covered sides of the mountain , forming a pleasing effect of light and shade . " In 1891 , about 15 km3 ( 3 @.@ 6 cu mi ) of rock fell producing a lahar that traveled more than 6 mi ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) and covered 1 sq mi ( 2 @.@ 6 km2 ) . 
 Activity in the 20th century decreased from the 19th century . Numerous small debris avalanches fell from Sherman Peak and descended the Boulder Glacier ; a large one occurred on July 27 , 2007 . 
 In early March 1975 , a dramatic increase in fumarolic activity and snow melt in the Sherman Crater area raised concern that an eruption might be imminent . Heat flow increased more than tenfold . Additional monitoring equipment was installed and several geophysical surveys were conducted to try to detect the movement of magma . The increased thermal activity prompted public officials and Puget Power to temporarily close public access to the popular Baker Lake recreation area and to lower the reservoir 's water level by 33 feet ( 10 m ) . If those actions had not been taken , significant avalanches of debris from the Sherman Crater area could have swept directly into the reservoir , triggering a disastrous wave that could have caused human fatalities and damage to the reservoir . Other than the increased heat flow , few anomalies were recorded during the geophysical surveys , nor were any other precursory activities observed that would indicate that magma was moving up into the volcano . Several small lahars formed from material ejected onto the surrounding glaciers and acidic water was discharged into Baker Lake for many months . 
 Activity gradually declined over the next two years but stabilized at a higher level than before 1975 . The increased level of fumarolic activity has continued at Mount Baker since 1975 , but no other changes suggest that magma movement is involved .

 = Pilophorus acicularis = 
 Pilophorus acicularis , commonly known as the nail lichen or the devil 's matchstick , is a species of lichen in the <unk> family . 
 P. aciculare has both <unk> ( crust @-@ like ) and <unk> thallus ( shrub @-@ like ) body parts . The lichen starts out as a granular crust on the rock surface , and develops <unk> stalks , or pseudopodetia , up to 3 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) tall and about 1 mm thick that have rounded black apothecia at the tips . The stalks are erect and curved so as to appear combed . It grows directly on silicate rocks in dense clusters . It is found on the west coast of North America up to Alaska , and in eastern Eurasia . In addition to green algae , the lichen contains cyanobacteria that help contribute to soil fertility by supplying fixed nitrogen . 
 It was originally described in 1803 , and transferred to the genus Pilophorus in 1857 . 
 = = History , taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The species was first described in 1803 as <unk> acicularis by the Swedish botanist and " father of <unk> " Erik <unk> . The taxon was transferred to several different genera in the next few decades resulting in several synonyms , including <unk> acicularis ( by <unk> in 1810 ) , Cladonia acicularis ( Elias Magnus Fries in 1831 ) , and <unk> aciculare ( Edward Tuckerman in 1845 ) . Elias Fries 's son Thore Magnus transferred the species to his then newly created genus Pilophorus in 1857 . William Nylander also published the combination Pilophorus acicularis in 1857 , but later analysis suggested that Fries 's combination was published first , and under the Principle of Priority , the correct citation of the species is Pilophorus acicularis ( Ach . ) <unk> ( 1857 ) . 
 The genus Pilophorus was until recently considered to be a member of the <unk> family by some authors . Analysis of small subunit ribosomal DNA sequences showed P. acicularis to be more closely related to the <unk> , rather than the <unk> . 
 The specific epithet aciculare is derived from the Latin acicularis , meaning " needle @-@ like " . The lichen is commonly known as the " devil 's matchstick " ; the common name for the genus — " nail lichen " — is also used . 
 = = Description = = 
 The thallus is the vegetative body of a lichen that contains the lichen mycobiont ( fungus ) and the photobiont ( algae and / or cyanobacteria ) . In P. acicularis , the primary thallus ( thallus <unk> ) is spread out like a granular crust on the surface of its substrate . It is light green when young , but becomes gray in age or when dry . The pseudopodetia ( upright stalk @-@ like extensions of the thallus made of vegetative tissue ) range from 0 @.@ 5 to 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 2 to 1 @.@ 2 in ) high , and are about 1 mm thick ; they grow in dense clusters . Most pseudopodetia are either unbranched or forked into two branches , with the stalks curved so as to appear as if combed ; less frequently , they are erect like pins , and up to 1 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 in ) tall . Some specimens are highly branched in the upper part of the pseudopodetia , causing them to bear some resemblance to P. robustus , although this morphology is uncommon . Internally , the pseudopodetia are solid when young , becoming hollow with age , and are composed of long , thin , highly gelatinized hyphae with narrow cavities about 0 @.@ 5 μm wide . The lower part of older pseudopodetia becomes blackened internally . The algal layer is not continuous — contrasting with lichen species that have thalli that <unk> into discrete tissue types , including a photobiont layer — and occurs with the mycobiont in the form of granules . These granules may be absent from some parts of the thallus surface . <unk> ( flask @-@ like structures , resembling perithecia , in which conidia are produced ) occur in the tips of small sterile pseudopodetia or in the tips of small lateral branches of older pseudopodetia . 
 The conidiophores of P. acicularis are 30 μm long , and unbranched . They have terminal sickle @-@ shaped conidia that measure 6 by 1 μm . The apothecia ( reproductive structures covered with the spore @-@ producing asci ) are abundant , usually with one or several on the tips of the pseudopodetia . They are black , hemispherical or roughly triangular , and measure up to 1 @.@ 5 mm in diameter . The hymenium ( the fertile spore @-@ bearing layer of cells containing the asci ) is up to 240 μm thick , and about two @-@ thirds of it is pigmented ; the lower part of the hymenium is sterile , consisting of only paraphyses . The asci are eight @-@ spored . The ascospores are rounded when young , becoming spindle @-@ shaped when mature , with dimensions of 21 @.@ 0 – 29 @.@ 5 by 4 @.@ 5 – 5 @.@ 5 μm . The generative tissue ( hyphae that eventually forms the thallus ) is closely interwoven with short , broad cells that have large cavities . The generative tissue is pigmented black @-@ brown , with the color being most intense below the paraphyses , becoming less so towards the stalk region . 
 Pilophorus acicularis is a tripartite lichen — containing a fungus , a green alga , and a cyanobacterium . <unk> ( lichenized aggregations of nitrogen @-@ fixing cyanobacteria ) are present on the primary thallus ; smaller cephalodia are also on the pseudopodetia . <unk> to irregularly shaped , and light to dark brown in color , they contain species from the genus Nostoc . The green algal photosynthetic symbiont ( photobiont ) associated with P. acicularis is <unk> magna ( formerly <unk> magna ) . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Pilophorus acicularis can be separated from similar species by its tall pseudopodetia . It may be confused with P. robustus , especially in material from Alaska where both species occur together . Usually , the different branching ( <unk> in P. robustus versus dichotomous in P. acicularis ) and the lack of a columella ( an internal , column @-@ shaped structure ) in longitudinal sections of the pseudopodetia of P. acicularis make it relatively easy to distinguish between the two . 
 <unk> clavatus , a species found in Western North America , Japan , Taiwan and South Korea , resembles P. acicularis , but it has much shorter pseudopodetia — up to 1 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 6 in ) long . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 The lichen typically grows on silicate stone , rarely on decaying wood . It is usually in partial shade in openings in low to mid @-@ elevation moist forests , and is also frequently found in rocky roadcuts . Lichens with cephalodia are capable of fixing nitrogen , and contribute nitrogen to the ecosystem . 
 P. acicularis is probably the most abundant species of the genus . Most specimens have been found on the west coast of North America as far North as Alaska , but it has been reported most frequently from British Columbia and Washington . The species is found in China , Japan , Korea , and Taiwan , and has also been reported from the Russian arctic . In general , P. acicularis seems to prefer an oceanic climate without extremely low temperatures , at least in comparison with other species of the genus . This assumption is supported by the fact that P. acicularis is found more southerly ( 34 findings in California ) than all other species and is less frequently found in northern Alaska where , for example , P. robustus and P. <unk> are more common . P. acicularis is rare east of the Rocky Mountains . 
 = Japanese battleship Fusō = 
 Fusō ( <unk> , a classical name for Japan ) was the lead ship of the two Fusō @-@ class dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Japanese Navy . Launched in 1914 and commissioned in 1915 , she initially patrolled off the coast of China , playing no part in World War I. In 1923 , she assisted survivors of the Great Kantō earthquake . 
 Fusō was modernized in 1930 – 35 and again in 1937 – 41 , with improvements to her armor and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the pagoda mast style . With only 14 @-@ inch guns , she was outclassed by other Japanese battleships at the beginning of World War II , and played auxiliary roles for most of the war . 
 Fusō was part of Vice @-@ Admiral Shōji Nishimura 's Southern Force at the Battle of Leyte Gulf . She was sunk in the early hours of 25 October 1944 by torpedoes and naval gunfire during the Battle of Surigao Strait . Some reports claimed that Fusō broke in half , and that both halves remained afloat and burning for an hour , but according to survivors ' accounts , the ship sank after 40 minutes of flooding . Of the few dozen crewmen who escaped , only 10 survived to return to Japan . 
 = = Description = = 
 The ship had a length of 192 @.@ 024 meters ( 630 ft ) between perpendiculars and 202 @.@ 7 meters ( 665 ft ) overall . She had a beam of 28 @.@ 7 meters ( 94 ft 2 in ) and a draft of 8 @.@ 7 meters ( 29 ft ) . Fusō displaced 29 @,@ 326 long tons ( 29 @,@ 797 t ) at standard load and 35 @,@ 900 long tons ( 36 @,@ 500 t ) at full load . Her crew consisted of 1 @,@ 198 officers and enlisted men in 1915 and 1 @,@ 396 in 1935 . During World War II , the crew probably totalled around 1 @,@ 800 – 1 @,@ 900 men . 
 During the ship 's first modernization during 1930 – 33 , her forward superstructure was enlarged with multiple platforms added to her tripod foremast . Her rear superstructure was rebuilt to accommodate mounts for 127 @-@ millimeter ( 5 @.@ 0 in ) anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns and additional fire @-@ control directors . Fusō was also given torpedo bulges to improve her underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the additional armor and equipment . During the second phase of her first reconstruction in 1934 – 35 , Fusō 's torpedo bulge was enlarged and her stern was lengthened by 7 @.@ 62 meters ( 25 @.@ 0 ft ) . These changes increased her overall length to 212 @.@ 75 m ( 698 @.@ 0 ft ) , her beam to 33 @.@ 1 m ( 108 ft 7 in ) and her draft to 9 @.@ 69 meters ( 31 ft 9 in ) . Her displacement increased by nearly 4 @,@ 000 long tons ( 4 @,@ 100 t ) to 39 @,@ 154 long tons ( 39 @,@ 782 t ) at deep load . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The ship had two sets of Brown @-@ Curtis direct @-@ drive steam turbines , each of which drove two propeller shafts . The turbines were designed to produce a total of 40 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 30 @,@ 000 kW ) , using steam provided by 24 Miyahara @-@ type water @-@ tube boilers , each of which consumed a mixture of coal and oil . Fusō had a stowage capacity of 4 @,@ 000 long tons ( 4 @,@ 100 t ) of coal and 1 @,@ 000 long tons ( 1 @,@ 000 t ) of fuel oil , giving her a range of 8 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 15 @,@ 000 km ; 9 @,@ 200 mi ) at a speed of 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) . The ship exceeded her design speed of 22 @.@ 5 knots ( 41 @.@ 7 km / h ; 25 @.@ 9 mph ) during her sea trials , reaching 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) at 46 @,@ 500 shp ( 34 @,@ 700 kW ) . 
 During her first modernization , the Miyahara boilers were replaced by six new Kanpon oil @-@ fired boilers fitted in the former aft boiler room , and the forward funnel was removed . The Brown @-@ Curtis turbines were replaced by four geared Kanpon turbines with a designed output of 75 @,@ 000 shp ( 56 @,@ 000 kW ) . During her 1933 trials , Fusō reached a top speed of 24 @.@ 7 knots ( 45 @.@ 7 km / h ; 28 @.@ 4 mph ) from 76 @,@ 889 shp ( 57 @,@ 336 kW ) . The fuel storage of the ship was increased to a total of 5 @,@ 100 long tons ( 5 @,@ 200 t ) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 11 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 21 @,@ 900 km ; 13 @,@ 600 mi ) at a speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The twelve 45 @-@ caliber 14 @-@ inch guns of Fusō were mounted in six twin @-@ gun turrets , numbered one through six from front to rear , each with an elevation range of − 5 to + 30 degrees . The turrets were arranged in an uncommon 2 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 2 style with superfiring pairs of turrets fore and aft ; the middle turrets were not superfiring , and had a funnel between them . The main guns and their turrets were modernized during the ship 's 1930 reconstruction ; the elevation of the main guns was increased to + 43 degrees , increasing their maximum range from 27 @,@ 800 to 35 @,@ 450 yards ( 25 @,@ 420 to 32 @,@ 420 m ) . Initially , the guns could fire at a rate of 1 @.@ 5 rounds per minute , and this was also improved during her first modernization . The orientation of Turret No. 3 was reversed during the modernization ; it now faced forward . 
 Originally , Fusō was fitted with a secondary armament of sixteen 50 @-@ caliber six @-@ inch guns mounted in casemates on the upper sides of the hull . The gun had a maximum range of 22 @,@ 970 yards ( 21 @,@ 000 m ) and fired at a rate of up to six shots per minute . She was fitted with five 40 @-@ caliber three @-@ inch AA guns in 1918 . The high @-@ angle guns were in single mounts on both sides of the forward superstructure and both sides of the second funnel , as well as on the port side of the aft superstructure . These guns had a maximum elevation of + 75 degrees , and could fire a 5 @.@ 99 @-@ kilogram ( 13 @.@ 2 lb ) shell at a rate of 13 to 20 rounds per minute to a maximum height of 7 @,@ 200 meters ( 23 @,@ 600 ft ) . The ship was also fitted with six submerged 533 @-@ millimeter ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes , three on each broadside . 
 During the first phase of Fusō 's modernization of the early 1930s , all five three @-@ inch guns were removed and replaced with eight 40 @-@ caliber 127 @-@ millimeter dual @-@ purpose guns , fitted on both sides of the fore and aft superstructures in four twin @-@ gun mounts . When firing at surface targets , the guns had a range of 14 @,@ 700 meters ( 16 @,@ 100 yd ) ; they had a maximum ceiling of 9 @,@ 440 meters ( 30 @,@ 970 ft ) at their maximum elevation of + 90 degrees . Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute , but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute . At this time , the ship was also provided with four quadruple mounts for the license @-@ built Type 93 13 @.@ 2 mm machine guns , two on the pagoda mast and one on each side of the funnel . The maximum range of these guns was 6 @,@ 500 meters ( 7 @,@ 100 yd ) , but the effective range against aircraft was only 1 @,@ 000 meters ( 1 @,@ 100 yd ) . The cyclic rate was adjustable between 425 and 475 rounds per minute , but the need to change 30 @-@ round magazines reduced the effective rate to 250 rounds per minute . 
 The improvements made during the first reconstruction increased Fusō 's draft by 1 meter ( 3 ft 3 in ) , soaking the two foremost six @-@ inch guns , so they were removed during the first phase of the ship 's second modernization in 1937 and 1938 . During this same phase , the Type 93 13 @.@ 2 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 52 in ) machine guns were replaced by eight 25 mm Type 96 light AA guns in twin @-@ gun mounts . Four of these mounts were fitted on the forward superstructure , one on each side of the funnel and two on the rear superstructure . This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II , but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon . According to historian Mark Stille , the twin and triple mounts " lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation ; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets ; the gun exhibited excessive vibration ; the magazine was too small , and , finally , the gun produced excessive muzzle blast " . The configuration of the AA guns varied significantly ; in July 1943 , 17 single and two twin @-@ mounts were added for a total of 37 . In July 1944 , the ship was fitted with additional AA guns : 23 single , six twin and eight triple @-@ mounts , for a total of 95 in her final configuration . These 25 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) guns had an effective range of 1 @,@ 500 – 3 @,@ 000 meters ( 1 @,@ 600 – 3 @,@ 300 yd ) , and an effective ceiling of 5 @,@ 500 meters ( 18 @,@ 000 ft ) at an elevation of + 85 degrees . The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteen @-@ round magazines . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 The ship 's waterline armor belt was 305 to 229 millimeters ( 12 to 9 in ) thick ; below it was a strake of 102 mm ( 4 in ) armor . The deck armor ranged in thickness from 32 to 51 mm ( 1 @.@ 3 to 2 @.@ 0 in ) . The turrets were protected with an armor thickness of 279 @.@ 4 mm ( 11 @.@ 0 in ) on the face , 228 @.@ 6 mm ( 9 @.@ 0 in ) on the sides , and 114 @.@ 5 mm ( 4 @.@ 51 in ) on the roof . The barbettes of the turrets were protected by armor 305 mm thick , while the casemates of the 152 mm guns were protected by 152 mm armor plates . The sides of the conning tower were 351 millimeters ( 13 @.@ 8 in ) thick . The vessel contained 737 watertight compartments ( 574 underneath the armor deck , 163 above ) to preserve buoyancy in the event of battle damage . 
 During her first reconstruction Fusō 's armor was substantially upgraded . The deck armor was increased to a maximum thickness of 114 mm ( 4 @.@ 5 in ) . A longitudinal bulkhead of 76 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) of high @-@ tensile steel was added to improve underwater protection . 
 = = = Aircraft = = = 
 Fusō was briefly fitted with an aircraft flying @-@ off platform on Turret No. 2 in 1924 . During the first phase of her first modernization , a catapult was fitted on the roof of Turret No. 3 and the ship was equipped to operate three floatplanes , although no hangar was provided . The initial Nakajima E4N2 biplanes were replaced by Nakajima E8N2 biplanes in 1938 . Fusō 's ability to operate her aircraft was greatly improved during the second phase of her second modernization in 1940 – 41 when the aircraft handling equipment was moved to the stern and a new catapult was installed . Mitsubishi F1M biplanes replaced the E8Ns from 1942 on . 
 = = = Fire control and sensors = = = 
 When completed in 1915 , Fusō had two 3 @.@ 5 @-@ meter ( 11 ft 6 in ) and two 1 @.@ 5 @-@ meter ( 4 ft 11 in ) rangefinders in her forward superstructure , a 4 @.@ 5 @-@ meter ( 14 ft 9 in ) rangefinder on the roof of Turret No. 2 , and 4 @.@ 5 @-@ meter rangefinders in Turrets 3 , 4 , and 5 . In late 1917 a fire @-@ control director was installed on a platform on the foremast . The 4 @.@ 5 @-@ meter rangefinders were replaced by 8 @-@ meter ( 26 ft 3 in ) instruments in 1923 . During the ship 's first modernization , four directors for the 12 @.@ 7 mm AA guns were added , one each on each side of the fore and aft superstructures , and an eight @-@ meter rangefinder was installed at the top of the pagoda mast . This was replaced by a 10 @-@ meter ( 32 ft 10 in ) rangefinder during 1938 . At this same time , the two 3 @.@ 5 @-@ meter rangefinders on the forward superstructure were replaced by directors for the 25 mm AA guns . Additional 25 mm directors were installed on platforms on each side of the funnel . 
 While in drydock in July 1943 , Type 21 air search radar was installed on the roof of the 10 @-@ meter rangefinder at the top of the pagoda mast . In August 1944 , two Type 22 surface search radar units were installed on the pagoda mast and two Type 13 early warning radar units were fitted on the funnel . Fusō was the only Japanese battleship to mount radar on her funnel .

 Given a classical name for Japan , Fusō was laid down at the Kure Naval Arsenal on 11 March 1912 and launched on 28 March 1914 . She was commissioned on 8 November 1915 and assigned to the 1st Division , of the 1st Fleet on 13 <unk> under the command of Captain Kōzō Satō . The ship did not take part in any combat during World War I , as there were no longer any forces of the Central Powers in Asia by the time she was completed ; she patrolled off the coast of China during that time . The ship served as the flagship of the 1st Division during 1917 and 1918 . During the ship 's period in reserve in 1918 , five 76 @.@ 2 mm anti @-@ aircraft guns were installed . She aided survivors of the Great Kantō earthquake between 9 and 22 September 1923 . Captain Mitsumasa Yonai assumed command on 1 July 1924 and was relieved on 1 November by Captain <unk> Takahashi In the 1920s , Fusō conducted training off the coast of China and was often placed in reserve . 
 The first phase of the ship 's first modernization began on 12 April 1930 at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal ; machinery was replaced , armor was reinforced , and torpedo bulges were fitted . Fusō arrived on 26 September 1932 at Kure Naval Arsenal , where her armament was upgraded and her torpedo tubes were removed . Her sea trials began on 12 May 1933 , and the second phase of her modernization began less than a year later . The ship 's stern was lengthened and work was completed in March 1935 . Captain Jinichi Kusaka was assigned command from November 1935 to December 1936 . After sporadic use for training for the next two years , Fusō was assigned as a training ship in 1936 and 1937 . 
 Fusō began the first phase of her second modernization on 26 February 1937 , and Captain Hiroaki Abe assumed command on 1 December . He was relieved by Captain <unk> Fujita on 1 April 1938 , the day after this phase of her modernization was completed . The ship was again assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Fleet on 15 November . She briefly operated in Chinese waters in early 1939 before the second phase of her second modernization began on 12 December 1940 . This was completed on 10 April 1941 , and Fusō was assigned to the 2nd Division of the 1st Fleet . Captain Mitsuo Kinoshita assumed command on 15 September , when the division consisted of the two Fusō @-@ class and the two Ise @-@ class battleships . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 On 10 April 1941 , Fusō was attached to the 2nd Division of the 1st Fleet . When the war started for Japan on 8 December , the division , reinforced by the battleships Nagato and Mutsu and the light carrier Hōshō , sortied from Hashirajima to the Bonin Islands as distant support for the 1st Air Fleet attacking Pearl Harbor , and returned six days later . On 21 February 1942 , the ship returned to the shipyard at Kure to replace her gun barrels , departing on 25 February . Together with the rest of the 2nd Battleship Division , she pursued but did not catch the American carrier force that had launched the Doolittle Raid on 18 April 1942 . 
 Fusō and the rest of the 2nd Battleship Division set sail on 28 May 1942 with the Aleutian Support Group at the same time that most of the Imperial Fleet began an attack on Midway Island ( Operation MI ) . Commanded by Vice @-@ Admiral Shirō Takasu , the division was composed of Japan 's four oldest battleships , including Fusō , accompanied by two light cruisers , 12 destroyers , and two oilers . Official records do not show the division as part of the larger Midway operation , known as Operation AL ; they were to accompany the fleet under Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto , but were only to provide support to the Aleutian task force if needed . 
 On 14 June , Fusō returned to Yokosuka and arrived back at Hashirajima on 24 June . In an effort to replace the aircraft carriers lost at the Battle of Midway , the navy made plans to convert the two Fusō @-@ class ships to hybrid battleship @-@ carriers , but the two Ise @-@ class battleships were chosen instead . The ship was assigned to the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy at Etajima , Hiroshima , for use as a training ship between 15 November 1942 and 15 January 1943 . Captain Keizō Komura assumed command on 5 December , and was relieved by Captain <unk> Tsuruoka on 1 June the next year . Seven days later , Fusō rescued 353 survivors from Mutsu when that ship exploded at Hashirajima . 
 Between 18 and 24 July 1943 , the ship was at the Kure drydock for fitting of radar and additional 25 mm AA guns . Fusō sailed from the Inland Sea on 18 August for Truk Naval Base , carrying supplies , and arrived five days later . The Japanese had intercepted American radio traffic that suggested an attack on Wake Island , and on 17 October , Fusō and the bulk of the 1st Fleet sailed for Eniwetok to be in a position to intercept any such attack . The fleet arrived on the 19th , departed four days later , and arrived back at Truk on 26 October . 
 On 1 February 1944 , Fusō departed Truk with Nagato to avoid an American air raid , and arrived at Palau on 4 February . They left on 16 February to escape another air raid . The ships arrived on 21 February at Lingga Island , and Fusō was employed there as a training ship . A week later , Captain Masami Ban relieved Tsuruoka . The ship was refitted at Singapore between 13 and 27 April , and returned to Lingga . She was transferred to Tawi @-@ Tawi on 11 May and provided cover for the convoy that failed to reinforce Biak Island at the end of the month . Fusō transferred to Tarakan Island off Borneo to refuel in early July before returning to Japan and escaping an attack by the submarine Pomfret . In early August at Kure , she was refitted with additional radars and light AA guns . Fusō and her sister ship were transferred to Battleship Division 2 of the 2nd Fleet on 10 September , and Fusō became the flagship of the division under the command of Vice @-@ Admiral Shōji Nishimura on 23 September . They departed Kure on 23 September for Lingga , escaping an attack by the submarine Plaice the next day , and arrived on 4 October , where Nishimura transferred his flag to Yamashiro . The ships then transferred to Brunei to refuel in preparation for Operation Shō @-@ Gō , the attempt to destroy the American fleet conducting the invasion of Luzon . 
 = = = = Battle of Surigao Strait = = = = 
 Commanded by Rear Admiral Masami Ban , Fusō left Brunei at 15 : 30 on 22 October 1944 as part of Nishimura 's Southern Force , heading east into the Sulu Sea and then northeast into the Mindanao Sea . Intending to join Vice @-@ Admiral Takeo Kurita 's force in Leyte Gulf , the force passed west of Mindanao Island into Surigao Strait , where it met a large force of battleships and cruisers lying in wait . The Battle of Surigao Strait became the southernmost action in the Battle of Leyte Gulf . 
 At 09 : 08 on 24 October , Fusō , Yamashiro , and the heavy cruiser Mogami spotted a group of 27 planes , including Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers and Curtiss SB2C Helldiver dive bombers escorted by Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters from the carrier Enterprise . A bomb from one of them destroyed the catapult and both floatplanes . Another bomb hit the ship near Turret No. 2 and penetrated the decks , killing everyone in No. 1 secondary battery ; the ship began to list 2 degrees to starboard . Early the next morning , Fusō opened fire around 01 : 05 after a shape was spotted off the port bow ; it turned out to be Mogami ; Fusō 's fire killed three sailors in that ship 's sick bay . 
 One or two torpedoes , possibly fired by the destroyer Melvin , hit Fusō amidships on the starboard side at 03 : 09 on the 25th ; she listed to starboard , slowed down , and fell out of formation . Some Japanese and American eyewitnesses later claimed that Fusō broke in half , and that both halves remained afloat and burning for an hour , but they specifically mentioned only the size of the fire on the water , and not any details of the ship . Historian John Toland agreed in 1970 that Fusō had broken in two , but according to historian Anthony Tully in 2009 : 
 [ Survivors ' accounts ] and the USS Hutchins report are describing a sinking and event at odds with the conventional record — one that seems far removed from the spectacle of the invariably alleged huge magazine explosion and blossom of light at 0338 that supposedly blew the battleship in half ! ... Fuso was torpedoed , and as a result of progressive flooding , upended and capsized within forty minutes . 
 Fusō sank between 03 : 38 and 03 : 50 ; only a few dozen men survived the rapid foundering and oil fire . There is evidence that some of these were rescued by the destroyer Asagumo , which was itself sunk a short time later ; it is also possible that some who escaped the sinking reached Leyte only to be killed by Filipinos , as is known to have happened to survivors from other Japanese warships sunk in the Battle of Surigao Strait . Ten crew members are known to have survived , all of whom returned to Japan . Fusō was removed from the navy list on 31 August 1945 . 
 = Typhoon Francisco ( 2013 ) = 
 Typhoon Francisco , known in the Philippines as Typhoon <unk> , was a powerful typhoon that strengthened to the equivalent of a Category 5 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale , according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center . The 25th named storm and the 10th typhoon of the 2013 Pacific typhoon season , Francisco formed on October 16 east of Guam from a pre @-@ existing area of convection . With favorable conditions , it quickly intensified into a tropical storm before passing south of Guam . After stalling to the southwest of the island , Francisco turned to the northwest into an environment of warm waters and low wind shear , becoming a typhoon . The JTWC upgraded it to super typhoon status on October 18 , while the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) estimated peak 10 ‑ minute sustained winds of 195 km / h ( 120 mph ) . Gradual weakening ensued , and after the typhoon turned to the northeast , Francisco deteriorated into a tropical storm on October 24 . Passing southeast of Okinawa and mainland Japan , the storm accelerated and became extratropical on October 26 , dissipating later that day . 
 On Guam and in the Northern Marianas Islands , Francisco produced tropical storm force wind gusts , strong enough to knock over some trees and cause $ 150 @,@ 000 ( 2013 USD ) in damage . The typhoon also dropped heavy rainfall on Guam , peaking at 201 mm ( 7 @.@ 90 in ) at Inarajan . Later , Francisco brought gusty winds and some rainfall to Okinawa . In Kagoshima Prefecture , 3 @,@ 800 homes lost power , while an island @-@ wide evacuation advisory was issued for Izu Ōshima after Typhoon Wipha spawned a deadly mudslide a week prior . Rains in Japan peaked at 600 mm ( 24 in ) in <unk> , Kōchi on Shikoku . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Early on October 15 , an area of convection persisted about 750 km ( 465 mi ) east @-@ northeast of Guam . Initially the system was located within an area of moderate wind shear , although conditions gradually became more favorable for tropical cyclogenesis . At 12 : 00 UTC on October 15 , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) estimated that a tropical depression developed about 450 km ( 280 mi ) east of Guam . A few hours later , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert before initiating advisories on Tropical Depression 26W early on October 16 . At that time , the depression was passing about 100 km ( 65 mi ) southeast of Guam . After formation , the system moved west @-@ southwestward under a ridge to the north . Its circulation consolidated as the thunderstorm activity organized , aided by warm sea surface temperatures and decreasing wind shear . At 06 : 00 UTC on October 16 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Francisco ( 1327 ) . 
 As a quickly organizing tropical cyclone , Francisco developed an eye feature late on October 16 in the center of the convection , as outflow improved and an anticyclone formed aloft . Based on the improved structure , the JMA upgraded Francisco to a severe tropical storm at 18 : 00 UTC on October 16 , followed by upgrading it to typhoon status at 06 : 00 UTC the next day . Francisco slowed its forward motion as steering currents weakened , with a north @-@ northwest drift beginning on October 17 due to an extension of the subtropical ridge . By later that day , the typhoon had a well @-@ defined eye 28 km ( 17 mi ) across and surrounded by deep convection , while passing west of Guam and the Northern Marianas Islands . The track accelerated more to the northwest , steered by the strengthening ridge . With the eyewall convection become more distinct , Francisco continued to intensify , and the JTWC upgraded it to a super typhoon on October 18 . At 18 : 00 UTC , the JMA estimated the typhoon attained peak 10 ‑ minute sustained winds of 195 km / h ( 120 mph ) . On October 19 , the JTWC upgraded Francisco to peak 1 ‑ minute winds of 260 km / h ( 160 mph ) , the equivalent of a Category 5 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale ; by that time , the eyewall contracted to just 19 km ( 12 mi ) in diameter . 
 After maintaining its peak intensity for about 36 hours , Francisco began weakening , after the eye lost definition due to building wind shear . By October 21 , the eye became ragged and cloud @-@ filled while the overall satellite presentation of the storm became elongated . That day , the typhoon entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) , which gave Francisco the local name <unk> ; the agency would cease issuing advisories on October 23 . Conditions generally remained favorable , allowing the eye to remain distinct despite a great reduction in the sustained winds . Dry air began affecting the tropical cyclone late on October 22 , cutting off the flow of moist air , and water temperatures cooled along the storm 's track . As a result , the eye dissipated and the convection weakened . An approaching trough from the Korean peninsula weakened the ridge to the north , slowing the typhoon and allowing it to turn north and northeast on October 24 . Francisco weakened below typhoon status after passing 210 km ( 130 mi ) southeast of Okinawa . The storm began interacting with the approaching cold front while it passed south of Japan , moving around the subtropical ridge . With increasing wind shear , the circulation became exposed from the convection , and the JTWC discontinued advisories on October 25 , declaring that Francisco was becoming extratropical . On the next day , Francisco completed its extratropical transition , but dissipated later on October 26 , to the southeast of Japan .

 While Francisco was developing near Guam , the local National Weather Service office issued a tropical storm watch for Guam , Rota , Tinian , and Saipan . On Guam , 1 @,@ 223 people evacuated to nine schools serving as emergency shelters . A cross country invitational was delayed by one day due to the storm .

 = = History = = 
 Boston 's early European settlers had first called the area <unk> ( after its " three mountains " — only traces of which remain today ) but later renamed it Boston after Boston , Lincolnshire , England , the origin of several prominent colonists . The renaming , on September 7 , 1630 ( Old Style ) , was by Puritan colonists from England , who had moved over from Charlestown earlier that year in quest of fresh water . Their settlement was initially limited to the Shawmut Peninsula , at that time surrounded by the Massachusetts Bay and Charles River and connected to the mainland by a narrow isthmus . The peninsula is known to have been inhabited as early as 5000 BC . 
 In 1629 , the Massachusetts Bay Colony 's first governor , John Winthrop , led the signing of the Cambridge Agreement , a key founding document of the city . Puritan ethics and their focus on education influenced its early history ; America 's first public school was founded in Boston in 1635 . Over the next 130 years , the city participated in four French and Indian Wars , until the British defeated the French and their native allies in North America . Boston was the largest town in British North America until Philadelphia grew larger in the mid 18th century .
