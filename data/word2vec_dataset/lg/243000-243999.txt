 = Ann Bishop ( biologist ) = 
 Ann Bishop ( 19 December 1899 – 7 May 1990 ) was a biologist from Girton College at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of the Royal Society , one of the few female Fellows of the Royal Society . She was born in Manchester but stayed at Cambridge for the vast majority of her professional life . Her specialties were protozoology and <unk> ; early work with ciliate parasites , including the one responsible for blackhead disease in the domesticated turkey , lay the groundwork for her later research . While working towards her doctorate , Bishop studied parasitic amoebae and examined potential chemotherapies for the treatment of amoebic diseases including amoebic dysentery . 
 Her best known work was a comprehensive study of Plasmodium , the malaria parasite , and investigation of various chemotherapies for the disease . Later she studied drug resistance in this parasite , research that proved valuable to the British military in World War II . She discovered the potential for cross @-@ resistance in these parasites during that same period . Bishop also discovered the protozoan <unk> <unk> and worked with Aedes aegypti , a malaria vector , as part of her research on the disease . Elected to the Royal Society in 1959 , Bishop was the founder of the British Society for Parasitology and served on the World Health Organization 's Malaria Committee . 
 = = Life = = 
 Bishop was born in Manchester , England on 19 December 1899 . Her father , James Kimberly Bishop , was a furniture @-@ maker who owned a cotton factory inherited from his father . Her mother , Ellen Bishop ( née Ginger ) , was from nearby Bedfordshire . Bishop had one brother , born when she was 13 . At an early age , Bishop wished to continue the family business , though her interests quickly turned to the sciences after her father encouraged her to go to university . <unk> of music from a young age , Bishop regularly attended performances of the Halle Orchestra in Manchester . As a researcher , she was introverted and meticulous , preferring to work alone or with other scientists whom she considered to have high standards . She was a fixture at Girton College for most of her life ; The Guardian dubbed her " <unk> of <unk> " in her obituary . A keen cook , she was also known for her annoyance at the lack of scientific measures in recipes she found . 
 Bishop was recognized at the College for her distinctive hats , which she would wear to breakfast every day before walking to the Molteno Institute , a distance of 3 @.@ 5 miles ( 5 @.@ 6 km ) . She was skilled in needlework and appreciated the arts , though she did not like modern art . Her pastimes included walking and travelling , especially in the Lake District : however , she rarely left Britain . She also spent time in London at the beginning of each year , attending the opera and ballet and visiting galleries . Towards the end of her life , when her mobility was limited by arthritis , Bishop developed a fascination with the history of biology and medicine , although she never published in that field . Ann Bishop died of pneumonia at the age of 90 after a short illness . Her memorial service was conducted in the College 's chapel and was filled with her wide circle of friends . 
 = = Education = = 
 Educated at home until she was seven , Bishop then went to a private elementary school until the age of nine . In 1909 , then ten years old , she entered the progressive Fielden School in her hometown of Manchester , where she studied for three years . She completed her high school education at the Manchester High School for Girls . Though Bishop intended to study chemistry , her lack of education in physics meant that she could not pursue her preferred course in the Honours School of Chemistry . Instead , she matriculated at Manchester University in October 1918 to study botany , chemistry , and zoology . That first @-@ year course in zoology sparked her lifelong interest in and commitment to the field . She graduated with honours from the School of Zoology , receiving her Bachelor of Science degree in 1921 ; she received her master 's degree in 1922 . During her undergraduate years , under the tutelage of the <unk> R.A. Wardle and the protozoologist Geoffrey <unk> , Bishop studied ciliates acquired from local ponds . 
 Two years into her undergraduate career , after winning the John Dalton Natural History Prize awarded by the University , she began work for another protozoologist , a Fellow of the Royal Society , Sydney J. Hickson . In 1932 , she received her D.Sc. from Manchester University , for her work with the blackhead parasite . She received her <unk> from the University of Cambridge in 1941 , though it was in title only : women were not granted full degrees from Cambridge at this time .

 = = = Early work = = = 
 Bishop 's undergraduate work with Hickson was her first major research effort , concerning the reproduction of Spirostomum ambiguum , a large ciliate that has been described as " wormlike " . In 1923 , while working at Manchester University , Bishop was appointed an honorary research fellow . In 1924 , she became a part @-@ time instructor for the Department of Zoology at Cambridge , one of only two women , both of whom were sometimes marginalised . For example , she was not allowed to sit at the table with the men of the department at tea : instead , she sat on a first @-@ aid kit . There , Bishop continued her work with Spirostomum as the only protozoologist on the faculty . 
 She left that position in 1926 , to work for Clifford Dobell at the National Institute for Medical Research where she stayed there for three years . Under Dobell , Bishop studied parasitic amoebae found in the human gastrointestinal tract , focusing on the species responsible for amoebic dysentery , Entamoeba histolytica . Dobell , Bishop , and Patrick Laidlaw studied the effects of <unk> like emetine for the purpose of treating <unk> diseases . Later in her career , she named the amoeba genus <unk> after her mentor . 
 = = = Molteno Institute = = = 
 The majority of her career was spent at Cambridge 's Molteno Institute for Parasite Biology , where she returned in 1929 . Her work there was an extension of her research with Dobell , as she studied nuclear division in parasitic flagellates and amoebae of diverse species , including both vertebrates and invertebrates . She isolated one type of protozoan , <unk> anaerobes , from the digestive tract of <unk> <unk> during this period . Bishop also discovered a new species , <unk> <unk> , which she named to acknowledge her colleague David <unk> , as well as the parasite 's resemblance to the genus Trichomonas . Her research at Manchester with H.P. Baynon concerned the identification , isolation , and study of the turkey blackhead parasite ( Histomonas <unk> ) ; this study pioneered a technique for isolating and growing parasites from lesions on the liver . Bishop and Baynon were the first scientists to isolate Histomonas and then prove its role in blackhead . Bishop 's expertise with parasitic protozoa translated into her best @-@ known work , a comprehensive study of the malaria parasite ( Plasmodium ) and potential chemotherapies for the disease . 
 Between 1937 and 1938 , Bishop studied the effects of various factors , including different substances in blood and different temperatures , on the feeding behaviour of the chicken malaria ( Plasmodium gallinaceum ) vector , Aedes aegypti . She also examined factors that contributed to Plasmodium reproduction . This work became the basis for subsequent ongoing research into a malaria vaccine . Her subsequent work was spurred by the outbreak of the Second World War . During the war , she investigated alternative chemotherapies for malaria . Her research aided the British war effort because the most prevalent antimalarial , quinine , was difficult to obtain due to the Japanese occupation of the Dutch West Indies . From 1947 to 1964 , she was in charge of the Institute 's Chemotherapy Research Institute , associated with the Medical Research Council . 
 Bishop 's work evolved to include studies of drug resistance in both the parasites and the host organisms , the studies that would earn her a place in the Royal Society . Significant work from this period of Bishop 's life included a study showing that the parasite itself did not develop resistance to quinine , but that host organisms could develop resistance to the drug proguanil . Her in vitro research was proven accurate when the drugs she studied were used to treat patients suffering from tertian malaria , a form of the illness in which the paroxysm of fever occurs every third day . She also investigated the drugs <unk> and atebrin , along with proguanil , though proguanil was the only one shown to cause the development of drug resistance . Other studies showed that malaria parasites could develop cross @-@ resistance to other antimalarial drugs . Bishop worked at Molteno until 1967 . Her research and experimental protocols were later used in rodent and human studies , albeit with modifications . 
 = = = Honours and legacy = = = 
 Bishop received several honorary titles and fellowships during her career . In 1932 , she was appointed a <unk> Fellow of Girton College , an honour she held until her death in 1990 . Bishop was also a Beit Fellow from 1929 – 1932 . The Medical Research Council awarded her a grant in 1937 that sparked her study of Plasmodium . In 1945 and 1947 , she was involved in organising Girton College 's Working Women 's Summer School , an institution designed to provide intellectual fulfilment for women whose formal education ended at the age of 14 . She was elected to the Royal Society in 1959 , and at one point was a member of the Malaria Committee of the World Health Organization . 
 The British Society for Parasitology was founded in the 1950s , largely due to Bishop 's efforts . She was initially given only five pounds and a secretary to start the Society ; in order to raise funds Bishop passed around a pudding basin at the Society 's meetings . The society was originally a subgroup of the Institute of Biology at Cambridge , but it became an independent group in 1960 and was headed by Bishop . She was the president of the group , called the Institute of Biology Parasitology Group , from 1960 @-@ 1962 , the third overall leader of the group . Later that decade , the Department of Biology asked her to be the department head , but she declined because of the public nature of the role . For 20 years , the scientific journal Parasitology had Bishop on staff as an editor . Her lifelong association with Girton College prompted the placement of a plaque commemorating her life , whose inscription , quoted from Virgil , reads " Felix , qui <unk> rerum <unk> <unk> " , Latin for " Happy is the one who has been able to get to know the causes of things " . In 1992 , the British Society for Parasitology created a grant in Bishop 's name , the Ann Bishop Travelling Award , to aid young <unk> in travelling for field work where their parasites of interest are endemic .

 = Slash 's Snakepit = 
 Slash 's Snakepit was an American rock supergroup from Los Angeles , California , formed by then @-@ Guns N ' Roses guitarist Slash in 1993 . Though often described as a solo or side project , Slash stated that Snakepit was a band with equal contributions by all members . The first lineup of the band consisted of Slash , two of his Guns N ' Roses band mates — drummer Matt Sorum and guitarist Gilby Clarke — as well as Alice in Chains bassist Mike Inez and former Jellyfish live guitarist Eric Dover on lead vocals . 
 Their debut album , It 's Five O 'Clock Somewhere , was released in 1995 . For the supporting tour , Slash enlisted James LoMenzo and Brian Tichy , of Pride and Glory , in place of Inez and Sorum who had other commitments . They played shows in the US , Europe , Japan and Australia before Geffen Records pulled their financial support for the tour , with Slash returning to Guns N ' Roses and Slash 's Snakepit disbanding . 
 Following his departure from Guns N ' Roses in 1996 , Slash formed the cover band Slash 's Blues Ball . After a tour in 1997 , Slash approached Blues Ball bassist Johnny Griparic about forming a new lineup of Slash 's Snakepit . The new lineup consisted of Slash , Griparic , singer Rod Jackson , guitarist Ryan Roxie and drummer Matt Laug ( Roxie and Laug were both former members of Alice Cooper 's solo band ) . They recorded and released their second album entitled Ain 't Life Grand in 2000 , which was preceded by a tour supporting AC / DC and followed by their own headlining tour . For the tour , Keri Kelli joined the group in place of Ryan Roxie , who departed following the completion of the album . However , after the final show , Slash disbanded Slash 's Snakepit due to a lack of commitment from his band members .

 Following the two and a half year world tour in support of the albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II , Guns N ' Roses guitarist Slash returned to Los Angeles . He soon sold his home , the Walnut House , and moved to Mulholland Drive . He built a small home studio , nicknamed The Snakepit , over his garage and began working on demos for songs he had written during the tour . Slash worked on the demos with Guns N ' Roses band mate and drummer Matt Sorum . They were later joined by guitarist Gilby Clarke and Alice in Chains bassist Mike Inez , jamming and recording most nights . Slash played the demos for Guns N ' Roses singer Axl Rose who rejected the material , though he would later want to use them for the next Guns N ' Roses album . They had recorded twelve songs by 1994 , the same year that Guns N ' Roses went on hiatus . 
 Slash decided to record the Snakepit demos with Sorum , Clarke and Inez , later adding former Jellyfish live guitarist Eric Dover as lead vocalist . The decision to record with Dover led to a disagreement between Slash and Sorum , due to Slash not seeking Sorum 's approval before hiring Dover . 
 = = = It 's Five O 'Clock Somewhere and breakup ( 1994 – 1996 ) = = = 
 Slash and Dover wrote the lyrics to all twelve songs with Slash using the songwriting to vent his frustrations at Guns N ' Roses singer Rose . Clarke contributed the song " Monkey Chow " to the album while " <unk> da Pit " is an instrumental by Slash and Inez . They recorded the album at Conway Recording Studios and The Record Plant with Mike Clink and Slash co @-@ producing and Steven Thompson and Michael Barbiero mixing , all of whom had worked with Guns N ' Roses on their debut album Appetite for Destruction . The album featured contributions by Duff McKagan ( who co @-@ wrote " Beggars & Hangers @-@ On " ) , Dizzy Reed on keyboards , Teddy Andreadis on harmonica , and Paulinho da Costa on percussion . Slash 's brother , Ash Hudson , designed the album 's cover . 
 The resulting album , titled It 's Five O 'Clock Somewhere , was released in February 1995 through Geffen Records . The album 's title was taken from a phrase Slash overheard at an airport . At the insistence of the record label , the album was released under the name Slash 's Snakepit , instead of The Snakepit , despite Slash not wanting his name used . Upon release , the album charted at number 70 on the Billboard 200 and number 15 on the UK Albums Chart . It 's Five O 'Clock Somewhere went on to sell over a million copies and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America . " Beggars & Hangers @-@ On " was released as the first , and only , single from the album ; while a music video was also shot for " Good to Be Alive " , directed by August Jakobsson . 
 Critically , the album received mainly positive reviews . Metal Hammer stated that " the sleazy , downtrodden blues hard rock [ ... ] breaks new ground . " AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine called Slash 's contributions " quite amazing " , though criticised the song @-@ writing , stating " it 's too bad that nobody in the band bothered to write any songs . " Devon Jackson of Entertainment Weekly described the album as " relaxed headbanging and Southern @-@ tinged blues @-@ rock " while Classic Rock reviewer Malcolm Dome stated " musically , it 's a loose @-@ limbed record that has a lot of heavy guitar @-@ led punk @-@ style pop @-@ rock . " Slash 's Snakepit toured in support of the album , with bassist James LoMenzo and drummer Brian Tichy , of Pride and Glory , replacing Inez and Sorum , who had opted out of touring , with Sorum returning to Guns N ' Roses . They toured the US , Europe , Japan and Australia with Slash stating that " for the first time in years , touring was easy , [ his ] band mates were loads of fun and low on drama , and every gig was about playing rock and roll . " While booking another leg of the tour , Slash was informed by Geffen that Rose was ready to begin work on the new Guns N ' Roses album and that he was to return to Los Angeles . Geffen pulled financial support for the band 's tour with Slash 's Snakepit disbanding soon after . 
 = = = Slash 's Blues Ball and reformation ( 1996 – 1999 ) = = = 
 Slash departed Guns N ' Roses in 1996 , due to musical differences between himself and singer Axl Rose . Following his departure , Slash toured Japan for two weeks with Chic , and worked on the soundtrack to the film Curdled . He later began touring in a cover band that eventually became Slash 's Blues Ball . Aside from Slash , the band consisted of Teddy Andreadis , guitarist Bobby Schneck , bassist Johnny Griparic , saxophonist Dave <unk> and drummer Alvino Bennett . The band toured on and off until 1998 , which included a headline slot at a jazz festival in Budapest . They covered various artists and bands such as B.B. King , Steppenwolf , Otis Redding , as well as Guns N ' Roses and Slash 's Snakepit material . 
 Following a tour in 1997 , Slash approached Griparic about forming a new lineup of Slash 's Snakepit They began looking for a singer , receiving over 300 audition tapes from mostly unknown singers . Jon Stevens of <unk> , who had been recording with Slash , was seen as a potential singer in early 1998 . However , he returned to Australia to continue his solo career . They eventually added singer Rod Jackson to the group after Griparic played a tape of him for Slash . Completing the lineup were guitarist Ryan Roxie , formerly of Alice Cooper , and drummer Matt Laug , also from Alice Cooper and the band Venice . They began rehearsing at Mates Studio before rehearsing and recording in Slash 's new home studio in Beverly Hills . 
 = = = Ain 't Life Grand and second breakup ( 1999 – 2002 ) = = = 
 The band began recording material with producer Jack Douglas at Slash 's home studio as well as Ocean Way Studios . The recording featured contributions by Teddy Andreadis , Jimmy Zavala and Lee Thornburg , amongst others . Initially , the label was positive about the album , setting a release date for February 22 , 2000 . However , when Slash was informed by Geffen , who had folded into Interscope Records , that the album was not the type of music the label produced , he bought the album back and signed a deal with Koch Records . Following the completion of the album , Roxie departed the band with former Big Bang Babies , Warrant and Ratt guitarist Keri Kelli joining in his place . 
 Ain 't Life Grand was released on October 20 , 2000 through Koch with " Mean Bone " released as the first single . The album did not sell as well as its predecessor , and critical reception to it was mixed . Entertainment Weekly reviewer Tony Scherman stated that " Slash 's playing is as flashily incendiary as ever , but the songs and arrangements recycle hard @-@ rock cliches worthier of Ratt than of a bona fide guitar god " . Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone noted that " great guitarists need great bands , and the Snakepit dudes are barely functional backup peons " . Steve Huey of Allmusic noted that " the new Snakepit does kick up a lot of noise as the album rushes by , and the strong chemistry between the members is immediately obvious " . However , he stated that songwriting was the main problem , and that " it never rises above the level of solid , and too many tracks are by @-@ the @-@ numbers hard rock at best ( and pedestrian at worst ) " . The band were dropped by Koch two months following the album 's release . 
 Prior to the album 's release , Slash 's Snakepit supported AC / DC on their Stiff Upper Lip tour from August to September , followed by their own headlining tour of theatres . They played only the first two shows on the winter leg of AC / DC 's tour . After falling ill and checking into a hospital in Pittsburgh , Slash was ordered by his doctor to stay at home to recuperate , reportedly from pneumonia . Due to this , Slash 's Snakepit pulled out of supporting AC / DC in early 2001 . Slash later revealed in his self @-@ titled biography that he had actually suffered cardiac myopathy caused by years of alcohol and drug abuse , with his heart swelling to the point of rupture . After being fitted with a defibrillator and undergoing physical therapy , Slash returned to the group to continue touring . They later rescheduled their US tour , performing shows from June 16 – July 6 , co @-@ headlining three shows with Billy Idol . Following the tour , feeling that his band was unprofessional and his band mates were not fully committed , Slash disbanded Slash 's Snakepit in an announcement made in early 2002 . 
 = = = Post – breakup activities = = = 
 Following the breakup of Slash 's Snakepit , Slash announced he was to begin working on a solo album . Instead he later worked with The Black Crowes drummer Steve Gorman and an unnamed bassist on a new project . Together with his former Guns N ' Roses band mates Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum , they formed The Project , that eventually became the hard rock supergroup Velvet Revolver following the addition of former Wasted Youth guitarist Dave Kushner , and then @-@ former Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland . They released their debut album Contraband , in 2004 , followed by Libertad in 2007 , before they parted ways with Weiland and went on hiatus in 2008 . With Velvet Revolver on hiatus , Slash began work on his debut solo album . Slash was released on March 31 , 2010 , and featured a number of guests such as Andrew Stockdale of Wolfmother , M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold , Kid Rock , Ozzy Osbourne , Myles Kennedy of Alter Bridge , and Fergie . His band for the tour in support of the album consisted of Kennedy , bassist Todd Kerns , and drummer Brent Fitz . It also included guitarist Bobby Schneck , formerly of Slash 's Blues Ball . 
 = = Musical style = = 
 Slash 's Snakepit 's music was often described as hard rock and blues rock with elements of southern rock . The band were also often described as Slash 's solo or side project though Slash maintained that they were a band , stating " everybody wrote , everybody had equal input even though I had my name on it . " Rolling Stone reviewer J.D. Considine noted the differences between Guns N ' Roses and Slash 's Snakepit on their first album , stating that " Guns [ N ] ' Roses typically treat the melody as the most important part of the song , most of what slithers out of the Snakepit emphasizes the playing . " He noted that singer Eric Dover " conveys the raw @-@ throated intensity of a hard @-@ rock frontman " and " he avoids the genre 's most obvious excesses . " The riff to " Good to Be Alive " drew a comparison to Chuck Berry while the musicianship on the album was praised . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic stated that " there 's little argument that Slash is a great guitarist " who is " capable of making rock and blues clichés sound fresh " . Reviewing Ain 't Life Grand for Allmusic , Steve Huey described second singer Rod Jackson as " a combination of ' 80s pop @-@ metal bluster and Faces @-@ era Rod Stewart " with a " touch of Aerosmith " , a description that he felt also fitted the band as a whole . He noted , though , that Slash 's guitar playing was " tame " and stated that the main problem of the album was the songwriting , though it was " still a passable , workmanlike record that will definitely appeal to fans of grimy , old @-@ school hard rock . " Malcolm Dome of Classic Rock stated that " from the moment that " Been There Lately " opens , there 's a vibe here that was missing before " and that Ain 't Life Grand showed " purpose , direction and individuality .

 John Harmen Marburger III ( February 8 , 1941 – July 28 , 2011 ) was an American physicist who directed the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the administration of President George W. Bush , serving as the Science Advisor to the President . His tenure was marked by controversy regarding his defense of the administration against allegations from over two dozen Nobel Laureates , amongst others , that scientific evidence was being suppressed or ignored in policy decisions , including those relating to stem cell research and global warming . However , he has also been credited with keeping the political effects of the September 11 attacks from harming science research — by ensuring that tighter visa controls did not hinder the movement of those engaged in scientific research — and with increasing awareness of the relationship between science and government . He also served as the President of Stony Brook University from 1980 until 1994 , and director of Brookhaven National Laboratory from 1998 until 2001 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Marburger was born on Staten Island , New York , to Virginia Smith and John H. Marburger Jr . , and grew up in Severna Park , Maryland . He attended Princeton University , graduating in 1962 with a B.A. in Physics , followed by a Ph.D. in Applied Physics from Stanford University in 1967 . 
 After completing his education , he served as a professor of Physics and Electrical Engineering at the University of Southern California in 1966 , specializing in the theoretical physics of nonlinear optics and quantum optics , and co @-@ founded the Center for Laser Studies at that institution . He rose to become chairman of the physics department in 1972 , and then Dean of the College of Letters , Arts and Sciences in 1976 . He was engaged as a public speaker on science , including hosting a series of educational television programs on CBS . He was also outspoken on campus issues , and was designated the university 's spokesperson during a scandal over preferential treatment of athletes . 
 = = Stony Brook University = = 
 In 1980 , Marburger left USC to become the third president of the State University of New York at Stony Brook on Long Island , New York . At the time , state budget cuts were afflicting the university : he returned it to growth with increases in the university 's science research funding from the federal government . He also presided over the founding of Stony Brook University Medical Center . 
 From 1988 to 1994 , Marburger chaired Universities Research Association , the organization that operated Fermilab and oversaw construction of the ill @-@ fated Superconducting Super Collider , an experience that is credited with convincing him of the influence government had in how science is carried out . During this time he also served as a trustee of Princeton University . He stepped down as President of Stony Brook University in 1994 , and began doing research again as a member of the faculty . 
 = = = Chair of Shoreham commission = = = 
 In 1983 , he was picked by New York Governor Mario Cuomo to chair a scientific fact @-@ finding commission on the Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant , a job that required him to find common ground between the many viewpoints represented on the commission . The commission eventually recommended the closure of the plant , a course he personally disagreed with . Cuomo had formed the commission in mid @-@ May 1983 to provide him with recommendations regarding the plant 's safety , the adequacy of emergency plans , and the economics of operating the plant . The commission 's consensus recommendations included unanimous findings that no emergency evacuation of the plant could be conducted without the cooperation of Suffolk County , which was refusing to approve an evacuation plan ; that the construction of the plant would have been prevented if it had been started after new Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations were put into effect after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 ; and that operating the plant would not reduce utility costs . Marburger himself at the time emphasized that the governor had not been seeking a consensus but rather encouraged multiple viewpoints to be reflected , and characterized the consensus conclusions as not the only important section of the report . 
 Marburger characterized his participation as a learning experience , and the experience was credited with profoundly changing his view on the relationship between the scientific community and the public . He had never been to a public hearing prior to his participation in the Shoreham commission , and he said that he had initially expected that the issues could be resolved by examining scientific data and establishing failure probabilities . However , he quickly became aware of the importance of the public participation process itself , stating that it was " one of the rare opportunities for the public to feel they were being heard and taken seriously " . Marburger 's conduct on the committee was praised by activists on both sides of the debate , with his focus on listening to all viewpoints and ability to not take disagreements personally being especially noted . 
 = = Brookhaven National Laboratory = = 
 In January 1998 , Marburger became president of Brookhaven Science Associates , which subsequently won a bid to operate Brookhaven National Laboratory for the federal government , and he became the director of the lab . He took office after a highly publicized scandal in which tritium leaked from the lab 's High Flux Beam Reactor , leading to calls by activists to shut down the lab . Rather than directly oppose the activists , Marburger created policies that improved the environmental management of the lab as well as community involvement and transparency . Marburger also presided over the commissioning of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider , expanded the lab 's program in medical imaging and neuroscience , and placed more emphasis on its technology transfer program . 
 The tritium leak , combined with other disclosures about improper handling and disposal of hazardous waste , had caused Secretary of Energy Federico Peña to fire the lab 's previous manager , Associated Universities , Inc . Upon starting as the laboratory 's director , Marburger noted the increased importance of health and environmental concerns since the beginning of the Cold War , stating that " getting the people at Brookhaven to understand that won 't be simple , and there may be some disagreement on how we should do it , but that 's my job . " Marburger set up a permanent community advisory council and met with local environmental groups to increase communication between them and the laboratory 's management . By 2001 , when Marburger left to join the Bush administration , local environmental groups credited him with having largely dissipated the distrust that had existed between the groups when he started . 
 = = Bush administration = = 
 In September 2001 , Marburger became Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy under George W. Bush . Marburger was a noted Democrat , a fact that Nature magazine stated was relevant to the decision by the administration to take the unusual step of withholding from Marburger the title of " special assistant " to the President that previous science advisors had been granted . 
 His tenure was marked by controversy as he defended the Bush Administration from accusations that political influence on science was distorting scientific research in federal agencies and that scientific evidence was being suppressed or ignored in policy decisions , especially on the topics of abstinence @-@ only birth control education , climate change policy , and stem cell research . Marburger defended the Bush Administration from these accusations , saying they were inaccurate or motivated by partisanship , especially on the issue of science funding levels . Marburger continued to be personally respected by many of his academic colleagues . 
 Marburger 's tenure as Director was the longest in the history of that post . After the September 11 attacks , he helped to establish the DHS Directorate for Science and Technology within the new Department of Homeland Security . He has been called a central player opposing new restrictions of international scientific exchanges of people and ideas after the attacks . He later was responsible for reorienting the nation 's space policy after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster , and played an important part in the nation 's re @-@ entry into the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor program . Marburger was also known for his support of the emerging field of science of science policy , which seeks to analyze how science policy decisions affects a nation 's ability to produce and benefit from innovation . 
 In February 2004 , the Union of Concerned Scientists published a report accusing the Bush administration of manipulating science for political purposes , listing more than 20 alleged incidents of censoring scientific results or applying a litmus test in the appointment of supposedly scientific advisory panel members . In April 2004 , Marburger published a statement rebutting the report and exposing errors and incomplete explanations in it , and stating that " even when the science is clear — and often it is not — it is but one input into the policy process , " but " in this Administration , science strongly informs policy . " The Union of Concerned Scientists issued a revised version of their report after Marburger 's statement was published . Marburger also called the report 's conclusions illusory and the result of focusing on unrelated incidents within a vast government apparatus , and attributed the controversy as being related to the upcoming elections . It was noted that Marburger enjoyed a close personal relationship with President Bush , with White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card and Office of Management and Budget Director Joshua Bolten attesting to his active involvement within the administration . 
 Marburger responded to criticism of his support for Bush Administration policies in 2004 , stating " No one will know my personal positions on issues as long as I am in this job . I am here to make sure that the science input to policy making is sound and that the executive branch functions properly with respect to its science and technology missions " . On the topic of stem cell research , he in 2004 said that stem cells " offer great promise for addressing incurable diseases and afflictions . But I can ’ t tell you when a fertilized egg becomes sacred . That ’ s not my job . That ’ s not a science issue . And so whatever I think about reproductive technology or choice , or whatever , is irrelevant to my job as a science adviser " . However , in February 2005 , in a speech at the annual conference of the National Association of Science Writers , he stated , " Intelligent design is not a scientific theory .... I don 't regard intelligent design as a scientific topic " . Also In 2005 , he told The New York Times that " global warming exists , and we have to do something about it . " 
 Sherwood Boehlert , the Republican chair of the House Committee on Science during most of Marburger 's tenure , said that " the challenge he faced was serving a president who didn 't really want much scientific advice , and who let politics dictate the direction of his science policy ... and he was in the unenviable position of being someone who had earned the respect of his scientific colleagues while having to be identified with policies that were not science @-@ based " . On the other hand , Robert P. Crease , a colleague of Marburger at Stony Brook University , characterized him as someone who " [ went ] to the White House as a scientist , not an advocate . He refused to weigh in on high @-@ profile , politically controversial issues , but instead set about fixing broken connections in the unwieldy machinery by which the government approves and funds scientific projects .... Some bitterly criticized him for collaborating with the Bush administration . But he left the office running better than when he entered . "

 Marburger returned to Stony Brook University as a faculty member in 2009 , and co @-@ edited the book The Science of Science Policy : A Handbook , which was published in 2011 . He also served as Vice President for Research but stepped down on July 1 , 2011 . Marburger died Thursday , July 28 , 2011 , at his home in Port Jefferson , New York , after four years of treatment for non @-@ Hodgkins lymphoma . He was survived by his wife , two sons , and a grandson . His final publication , a book on quantum physics for laypeople called Constructing Reality : Quantum Theory and Particle Physics , was published shortly after his death . 
 = Whitton Bridge Pasture = 
 Whitton Bridge Pasture is a Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) in the unitary authority of Stockton @-@ on @-@ Tees , England . At 3 @.@ 18 hectares ( 7 @.@ 9 acres ) it lies to the south of Whitton village and north west of Stockton @-@ on @-@ Tees . SSSIs are chosen by Natural England , and Whitton Bridge Pasture was designated in 2004 because of its biological interest . It is one of 18 SSSIs in the Cleveland area of search . 
 The biological interest is focused on the species @-@ rich mesotrophic grassland found across the site , which is actively maintained by grazing . The species present are predominantly grasses , although herbs and orchids are also found . The area has been classified as MG5 under the British National Vegetation Classification because of the species composition . The site is small and isolated , and therefore requires careful management to avoid damage caused by activity on neighbouring land . 
 = = Reason for notification = = 
 SSSIs are designated by Natural England , previously English Nature , which uses the 1974 – 1996 county system . This means there is no grouping of SSSIs by Stockton @-@ on @-@ Tees unitary authority , or County Durham which is the relevant ceremonial county . As such Whitton Bridge Pasture is one of 18 SSSIs in the Cleveland area of search . 
 Whitton Bridge Pasture is nationally important for its species @-@ rich grassland which is unimproved by fertilisers . This type of grassland — once common in the Tees lowland — is becoming increasingly rare with its associated species also becoming scarce . Whitton Bridge Pasture is one of only two remaining examples of this habitat in the Tees lowland area . The other example is <unk> Pasture , an SSSI about 3 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) to the south , which was designated at the same time but is significantly smaller . 
 Under the British National Vegetation Classification ( NVC ) Whitton Bridge Pasture is considered as mesotrophic grassland because it represents well @-@ drained and permanent pasture . In particular it is considered to be an MG5 community because of the species present . MG5 is widespread in many lowland areas in England , Wales , and Scotland , particularly in the Midlands . Whitton Bridge Pasture is predominantly subcommunity MG5c ( Danthonia decumbens ) , however subcommunity <unk> ( Lathyrus pratensis ) is present with a substantially different species composition . 
 = = Site description = = 
 = = = Abiotic = = = 
 Located north @-@ west of Stockton @-@ on @-@ Tees and 500 metres ( 550 yd ) south of the village of Whitton , it is a small site of 3 @.@ 18 hectares ( 7 @.@ 9 acres ) between a sewage works and Whitton Beck . Topographically the site slopes north towards the stream from a height of 40 metres ( 130 ft ) to less than 30 metres ( 98 ft ) . The underlying geology of Whitton Bridge Pasture is responsible for shaping the species @-@ rich community found on the surface . Glacial tills and sands are the prominent geological features resulting in a relatively base @-@ poor soil , characteristic of glacial drift geology . The soils of MG5c ( Danthonia decumbens ) subcommunity are typically acidic . 
 Because Whitton Bridge Pasture is located in North East England it experiences a climate that is different from the UK average . The North East receives on average 370 millimetres ( 15 in ) less rainfall than the UK over a year . Similarly the North East has roughly 129 days each year with more than 1 millimetre ( 0 @.@ 039 in ) of rainfall , more than 25 days fewer than UK average . Despite these differences the temperature is similar for both the North East and the UK , although the North East does have fewer days with air frost and more hours of sunshine per year . 
 = = = Biotic = = = 
 The majority of the site is made up of species @-@ rich grassland ( subcommunity MG5c ) , which comprises three dominant species of grass and several other grass species at lower abundances . The dominant species are Red <unk> ( Festuca rubra ) , Common Bent ( Agrostis capillaris ) and Yorkshire Fog ( Holcus lanatus ) . The less abundant species of grass include , Crested Dog 's @-@ tail ( <unk> cristatus ) , Heath @-@ grass ( Danthonia decumbens ) and <unk> ( Dactylis glomerata ) . The subcommunity also has many broad @-@ leaved herbs including Common <unk> ( Centaurea nigra ) , <unk> ( Potentilla erecta ) , Devils @-@ bit scabious ( Succisa pratensis ) and <unk> ( <unk> officinalis ) . 
 A second subcommunity ( <unk> ) is present and is characterised by the legume Meadow <unk> ( Lathyrus pratensis ) . Other species present in this subcommunity include Salad burnet ( Sanguisorba minor ) , Quaking grass ( Briza media ) , <unk> ( <unk> majus ) and the Orchid species : Common <unk> ( Neottia ovata ) and Early Purple Orchid ( Orchis mascula ) . The subcommunity also contains Meadow barley ( Hordeum <unk> ) , a perennial grass , which is a characteristic species of the Tees Lowland . 
 The two <unk> of MG5 , characterised by species rich grassland form a belt across the site , but they do not cover the whole site . Towards the north there is a community dominated by False oat @-@ grass ( <unk> <unk> ) , a constant species in the <unk> and <unk> communities of the British NVC and therefore not typical of an MG5 community . At Whitton Bridge Pasture it is growing on alluvial soils located at the northern edge of the site , which have most likely been formed by Whitton Beck just to the north . A number of springs at the site are associated with flushes of the Pale sedge ( Carex pallescens ) , which form small populations . 
 = = Management = = 
 Natural England 's role is to advise and help the owners manage Whitton Bridge Pasture effectively . To achieve this Natural England provides guidelines for each SSSI . Species @-@ rich grassland , such as that found at Whitton Bridge , requires careful management for it to retain its high species diversity . This means many activities are not allowed at the site including : ploughing , drainage and the use of fertilisers , pesticides or herbicides . 
 Management of the site requires moderate grazing during the summer and autumn to help maintain the species diversity . This is because grazing removes each year 's new growth which helps stop the site becoming dominated by vigorously growing grasses . Such grasses would allow a buildup of dead organic matter , which together with the increased growth , would reduce the growth of less vigorous species . The overall effect would be a reduction in species diversity , which was one of the reasons for the SSSI designation . Trampling can be of benefit because it breaks up accumulated dead organic matter . 
 The small and isolated nature of the site makes it susceptible to damage from the surrounding area . For example , herbicides , thought to be generally damaging for the species richness , could get onto the site from the drift of spray from surrounding fields . To help combat this the maintenance of mature hedgerows around the perimeter is encouraged . As of 2006 the condition of Whitton Bridge Pasture is described as favourable , which means that the land is being adequately conserved and any conservation objectives are being met , but that there is scope for enhancement of the site . The condition of the site was also described as favourable in 2004 and 2005 assessments . In the future it is hoped that the grazing regime will become more regularised and will be of high priority . 
 = No worries = 
 No worries is an expression seen in Australian , British and New Zealand English meaning " do not worry about that " , " that 's all right " , or " sure thing " . It is similar to the American English no problem . The phrase is widely used in Australian speech and represents a feeling of friendliness , good humour , optimism and " mateship " in Australian culture . The phrase has been referred to as the national motto of Australia . 
 The phrase has influenced a similar phrase used in the Tok Pisin language in Papua New Guinea . No worries utilization migrated to New Zealand after origination in Australia . Its usage became more common in British English after increased usage in Australian soap operas that aired on television in the United Kingdom . Linguistics experts are uncertain how the phrase became utilized in American English ; theories include use by Steve Irwin on the television program The Crocodile Hunter and usage by the United States media during the 2000 Sydney Olympics . It has also gained usage in Canadian English . 
 = = Definition = = 
 " No worries " is an Australian English expression , meaning " do not worry about that " , or " that 's all right " . It can also mean " sure thing " and " you 're welcome " . Other colloquial Australian terms which mean the same thing include " she 'll be right " . The expression has been compared to the American English equivalent " no problem " . In their book Australian Language & Culture : No Worries ! , authors Vanessa Battersby , Paul <unk> and Barry Blake note : " No worries is a popular Australian response akin to ' no problems ' , ' that 's OK ' or ' sure thing ' . " 
 = = Cultural origins = = 
 Early documentation dates the phrase back to 1966 . According to author of When Cultures Collide : Leading Across Cultures , Richard D. Lewis , the phrase is a form of expression of the relaxed attitude in Australian culture . Anna Wierzbicka comments that the expression illustrates important parts of Australian culture , including : " amiability , friendliness , an expectation of shared attitudes ( a proneness to easy ' mateship ' ) , jocular toughness , good humour , and , above all , casual optimism " . She concludes that along with " good on you " , the expressions reflect the " national character " and " prevailing ethos " of Australia . Though initially utilized in Australia , the phrase migrated to New Zealand as well . 
 = = Usage = = 
 Wierzbicka writes in her book Cross @-@ cultural <unk> that the expression " permeates Australian speech " , " serves a wide range of <unk> forces " and displays a " casual optimism " . In her 1992 book Semantics , Culture , and Cognition , Wierzbicka classifies the phrase as " among the most characteristic Australian expressions " , along with " good on you " . 
 The term can also be used in the context of an apology . The phrase has been used widely in British English since the late 1980s , a development partly attributed to the success of Australian soap operas such as Neighbours in the United Kingdom . 
 The phrase " no <unk> <unk> " has the same meaning in Australia ; as a spoonerism of " no fucking worries " , and is contracted to the phrases " no <unk> " and " no <unk> " . 
 = = Influence = = 
 " No worries " was referred to as " the national motto " of Australia in 1978 , and in their 2006 work , Diving the World , Beth and Shaun Tierney call " no worries , mate " the national motto of the country . Writing in The New York Times Book Review , Annette <unk> calls the expression a " ritual incantation " which has " particular charm " . The phrase " no <unk> " in the Papua New Guinea language Tok Pisin is derived from the Australian English term . 
 According to The Sunday Mail a 2004 newspaper report notes that " no worries " has begun to be used in American English . Writing in a 2004 article for The Advertiser , <unk> Harris comments : " The Americans have no idea of the etymology of ' no worries ' . So , while they may cheerily adopt our ' no worries ' mantra , ' no worries ' will never catch on as an attitude . " According to Tom <unk> , author of two books on slang usage in the United States , linguistics experts are not certain how the expression became popular in that country . Usage of the term by Steve Irwin on The Crocodile Hunter , as well as attempts by members of the American press to imitate the expression during the 2000 Sydney Olympics , have been put forth as theories explaining the pervasiveness of the expression in the United States . Linguistics professor Kate Burridge writes in her 2004 book Weeds In the Garden Of Words that expressions including " no worries " , " absolutely " , and " bottom line " have become less prevalent in favor of newer sayings . The phrase has had some usage in Canadian English .

 " Mrs. Donaghy " is the eleventh episode of the fifth season of the American television comedy series 30 Rock , and the 91st overall episode of the series . It was written by co @-@ executive producer Jack Burditt and directed by Tricia Brock . The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company ( NBC ) network in the United States on January 20 , 2011 . Guest stars in this episode include Meng Ai , Jean Brassard , Todd Buonopane , <unk> Burgess , Cheyenne Jackson , Chris Parnell and Sherri Shepherd . 
 In the episode , the fictitious show The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan ( TGS ) staff are affected by budget cuts at NBC . Meanwhile , Jack Donaghy ( Alec Baldwin ) married his girlfriend Avery Jessup ( Elizabeth Banks ) but following the wedding he learns that the minister ( Brassard ) did not marry the two of them . At the same time , TGS star Jenna Maroney ( Jane Krakowski ) shares a dressing room with her co @-@ star Danny Baker ( Jackson ) , and Tracy Jordan ( Tracy Morgan ) has a health scare . 
 Before the airing , NBC moved the program to a new timeslot at 10 : 00 p.m. , moving it from its 8 : 30 p.m. slot that began in the beginning of the fifth season . This episode of 30 Rock was generally , though not universally , well received among television critics . According to Nielsen Media Research , " Mrs. Donaghy " was watched by 5 @.@ 338 million households during its original broadcast , and received a 2 @.@ 7 rating / 7 share among viewers in the 18 – 49 demographic . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Jack Donaghy ( Alec Baldwin ) married his girlfriend Avery Jessup ( Elizabeth Banks ) over New Year 's . However , when he returns to New York following the nuptials he discovers that he is instead married to his employee and friend Liz Lemon ( Tina Fey ) . At the wedding , Liz was Jack 's best man and wore a white shirt with a head net while Avery wore a black dress . As a result of what Liz was wearing , the minister ( Jean Brassard ) instead married Jack and Liz . He informs Liz that the minister married the two of them instead of him and Avery . The two set out for a divorce , however , TGS with Tracy Jordan producer Pete Hornberger ( Scott Adsit ) tells Liz not to sign the divorce papers as she can use their marriage to her advantage as TGS — a show she is the head writer for — is affected by budget cuts at NBC as part of the merger with the fictional network company Kabletown . She demands that Jack , an executive at NBC , give the show its lost budget but he denies the request , as a result Liz will not sign the divorce papers unless her conditions are met . 
 Meanwhile , TGS star Jenna Maroney 's ( Jane Krakowski ) dressing room is now a temporary room for a technician ( Meng Ai ) as Jack is renting space on the TGS floor in the 30 Rock building to keep the budget down , as a result Jenna is forced to share a dressing room with her TGS co @-@ star Danny Baker ( Cheyenne Jackson ) . Immediately , the two start behaving like an old married couple . NBC page Kenneth Parcell ( Jack McBrayer ) gets upset about Jenna and Danny fighting and decides to stop their bickering . Kenneth interrupts one of their arguments by showing them a childish picture he drew of the two . This works to no avail as Jenna and Danny continue arguing . To put a stop to this , Danny moves out from his dressing room and into the Y. 
 At the same time , TGS star Tracy Jordan ( Tracy Morgan ) is informed by Dr. Leo Spaceman ( Chris Parnell ) that he has health problems as Tracy has a weakened system only found on dead people . Tracy and his wife Angie Jordan ( Sherri Shepherd ) meet with Jack and Tracy reveals what Dr. Spaceman told him . Angie becomes concerned on whether or not their family will be taken care of after Tracy dies . Jack offers Angie a job in the entertainment business , and takes the opportunity to get even with Liz by assigning Angie as Liz 's intern . Liz realizes that Angie 's new job is Jack 's way of messing with her , and explains to Angie that as her intern she is not getting paid and fires her . Angie gets upset with Jack and Liz but Jack offers her a reality show during TGS 's time slot unless Liz signs the divorce papers . Liz , however , still refuses — even admitting she likes the concept of a reality show starring Angie and would watch it . To get back at Jack , Liz holds a press conference and announces that she and Jack have decided to donate $ 5 million to The Jack and Elizabeth Donaghy High School for Teen Drama , The Arts , and Feelings . The next day , Jack and Liz have a sit down meeting with NBC Human resource mediator Jeffrey Weinerslav ( Todd Buonopane ) to discuss their marriage as NBC has strict anti @-@ nepotism guidelines . During the meeting , the two realize that they have had the longest and most meaningful relationship either of them has ever had , and apologize to each other with Liz agreeing to sign the divorce papers and Jack promising to restore TGS 's budget .

The episode was directed by Tricia Brock , making it her second for the series after directing the March 19 , 2009 , episode " The Bubble " from the show 's third season . " Mrs. Donaghy " originally aired in the United States on January 20 , 2011 , on NBC as the eleventh episode of the show 's fifth season and the 91st overall episode of the series . 
 The episode featured several appearances by several frequent guest stars , including Todd Buonopane as NBC Human resource mediator Jeffrey Weinerslav , Cheyenne Jackson as TGS cast member Danny Baker , Chris Parnell as Dr. Leo Spaceman , and Sherri Shepherd as Angie Jordan the wife of Tracy Jordan . Buonopane , Jackson , Parnell , and Shepherd made their fifth , eighth , sixteenth , and sixth appearances on the show , respectively . In an interview with TV Guide in November 2010 , co @-@ showrunner and executive producer Robert Carlock revealed that Shepherd 's character " will be getting her own Real Housewives @-@ type reality show . Having the cameras around forces Tracy to act on better behavior . " This is evident in the following episode " Operation Righteous Cowboy Lightning " . Tina Fey , the series creator , executive producer and lead actress on 30 Rock , told Entertainment Weekly , in regards to Angie 's reality show , " We 're hoping to , maybe , if we can get away with it , do an entire episode that 's just an episode of Queen of Jordan . Now I 'm just superimposing my own TV viewing habits onto 30 Rock . " In the episode , Dr. Spaceman informs Tracy Jordan — played by Tracy Morgan — that he is dying , television columnist Meredith Blake from the Los Angeles Times wondered if this subplot was written as a way to deal with Tracy Morgan 's recent kidney transplant as he is expected to miss several episodes to recover from the procedure . 
 In the episode , it is revealed that Jack Donaghy accidentally married Liz Lemon instead of his girlfriend Avery Jessup ( Elizabeth Banks ) . At the wedding , Liz was Jack 's best man and wore a white shirt with a head net , while Avery wore a black cocktail dress . As a result of what Liz was wearing , the minister ( Jean Brassard ) instead married Jack and Liz . The two decide to get a divorce , however , they use their marriage to get the upper hand over one another . Ultimately , Jack and Liz decide to stop their feud and get a divorce . Since beginning , the series has occasionally hinted at a romantic relationship between the two characters . In one episode , Jack passes Liz off as his live @-@ in girlfriend to his ex @-@ wife Bianca ( Isabella Rossellini ) to make her jealous . In another episode , Jack 's mother Colleen Donaghy ( Elaine Stritch ) tells him that Liz is a perfect match for him , and in the same episode he has Liz listed as his emergency contact . In an April 2010 Esquire interview , Fey said that one of the plots that 30 Rock will never do is have Liz and Jack get together . " Let me put the Internet at ease : Liz and Jack will never be together . " Alec Baldwin was asked if the two characters will ever hook @-@ up , he responded " I sincerely doubt it , and I think the show is better off that way . Once they cross that line , all the tension goes out of those relationships . And I think the lesson we learned about both those characters is that they are married to their jobs and they are married to their work . "

 Dr. Spaceman tells Tracy that he is dating Squeaky Fromme and says that she is a handful . Fromme is a member of the Manson Family , and was sentenced to life imprisonment for attempting to assassinate United States President Gerald Ford in 1975 . Jenna and Danny begin arguing after the two are forced to share a dressing room . She takes down Danny 's poster of the Montreal Alouettes , a Canadian Football League team based in Montreal , Quebec , which was signed by Marc Trestman , the head coach of the Alouettes . Jenna says that she took down the poster because it was tacky , as are his mother 's chain e @-@ mails ( a message that attempts to induce the recipient to make a number of copies of the letter and then pass them on to as many recipients as possible ) . 
 Later , Jack gives Angie a reality show that will feature her friends and family . The show is a parody of the reality show The Real Housewives of ... which airs on the cable network Bravo and follows the lives of relatively affluent , bourgeois housewives and professional women in the suburban or urban areas of several American cities . During the press conference , in which Liz announces that she and Jack have decided to donate $ 5 million to " a high school for drama , the arts , and feelings " , Liz spoke as socialite Edith Bouvier Beale . Later , Jack asks Liz what that voice was with Liz responding that that was " Drew Barrymore 's impression of that crazy lady " , a reference to actress Drew Barrymore who portrayed Beale in the 2009 HBO film Grey Gardens .

 Before the airing of this episode , NBC unveiled its 2010 – 11 primetime schedule in May 2010 with the network moving 30 Rock from the 9 : 30 p.m. time to the 8 : 30 p.m. timeslot for the show 's fifth season . In November 2010 , it was announced that the program would move from 8 : 30 to the 10 : 00 timeslot . The network moved 30 Rock to the 10 : 00 time in order to " make room " for the return of the comedy show Parks and Recreation and the debut of the new comedy Perfect Couples . Many questioned whether or not it was a good decision to move the show to 10 : 00 as it is a low rated show . According to Nielsen Media Research , " Mrs. Donaghy " was watched by 5 @.@ 338 million households in its original American broadcast . According to New York magazine the staff were most worried about how 30 Rock and Community — another program that airs on NBC 's Thursday lineup — would do in the new time change but said that both shows " did great .

 The A.V. Club 's Zack Handlen noted that the Jack and Liz being married plot " was strong enough to carry the episode overall , as watching Liz drive Jack crazy is almost always entertaining . " Handlen did not enjoy the other two stories from the episode , citing that Jenna and Danny 's " had some good lines " and that it was good to see these two characters play off each other but " this really needed to get a lot crazier , or else have some sort of character development " , and that the third plot was only worth towards the opening credits to Angie 's reality show . " This was hilarious ... but everything else was like watching echoes of old gags . [ ... ] There wasn 't a lot of connective tissue to hold any of this together , so it came across as haphazard . " Juli Weiner of Vanity Fair wrote that this was a " fine episode about marriage and mistranslation . " Weiner , however , opined that the portrayal of Angie Jordan here , played by Sherri Shepherd , " was less than ideal . " Alan Sepinwall from HitFix wrote that the show is having a strong season with its fifth season but wrote that this episode was not a particularly strong one nonetheless " the writers can almost always rely on the Jack / Liz relationship for both heart ... and comedy . It was the first part of the episode that made me consistently laugh , and it also worked because I like Jack and Liz – and like that the show remains committed to a complete lack of romantic tension between them " . TV Guide 's Matt Roush was glad that Chris Parnell returned as his 30 Rock character in this episode . Ian McDonald of Zap2it wrote that the Jeffrey character " made one of the best in @-@ jokes of the episode , recapping ( and misinterpreting ) Liz and Jack 's ' will they / won 't they chemistry . ' The kicker , though , was we 're meant to realize that Liz and Jack are perfect for each other in a completely platonic way . " McDonald was positive about Jane Krakowski and Cheyenne Jackson 's subplot , saying it was nice to see them share a story , and that their characters " have great , toxic chemistry . " Bob Sassone of TV Squad said that the ending in which the Jeffrey character summarized Jack and Liz 's friendship " was a perfect summation of the heart of 30 Rock itself . " 
 IGN contributor Matt Fowler commented that the Jenna and Danny story " felt weak " but that Angie getting her own show " more than made up for it . " Fowler gave the episode an 8 out of 10 rating . Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student commented that " Mrs. Donaghy " had a " solid comeback " , while Entertainment Weekly 's Breia Brissey was glad that the show returned . " The strength of [ ' Mrs. Donaghy ' ] was that , however silly , all of the illogical circumstances of the show can be explained with a bit of reason " , reported Caitlin Smith of The Atlantic . Smith said her favorite scene was when Jack and Liz have a sit down meeting with Jeffrey , and " [ h ] e 's counseling the newly married couple to avoid bringing their personal relationship into work and reads off a lengthy checklist of things to avoid . " Meredith Blake from the Los Angeles Times explained that the reason the series is having a strong season is due to it returning to the basics with the Jack and Liz friendship ; " Somehow , Liz and Jack are such a perfect , if unexpected , pair that this theme manages not to wear thin . Their accidental marriage ... was almost inevitable , the logical end to which the writers could stretch the relationship . It does make you wonder what the writers can possibly do next , but I have faith . " New York magazine 's Willa Paskin enjoyed Tina Fey 's impression of Edith Bouvier Beale during her press conference . Elliott Hammer of The Collegian wrote that Angie 's tagline for her reality show " I 'm Angie and I think elegance and attitude are the same thing " was brilliant . 
 Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic commented that " [ t ] here were moments when I laughed " but that " Mrs. Donaghy " did not come together to make a great episode . He noted that Jack and Liz discovering that they were married " didn 't bring much new to the table . Jack and Liz arguing like this is standard for 30 Rock , and I got bored of their story rather quickly . " Further in his recap , Forcella said that the ending scene , with Jeffrey explaining all of the things Jack and Liz have done together as close friends , " was almost as if they expected us to predict one of them was going to think it was something more than a friendship , and then flip it on the audience . " Kelsea <unk> of the New York Post noted that when it was revealed that Jack accidentally married Liz that it " fell a little flat " , reasoning " I mean , Jack accidentally married [ Liz ] , this scene could have reached so many levels of insanity , but instead they settled for Jonathan 's ( Maulik Pancholy ) piercing squeal before moving onto the rest of the show . " Johnny Firecloud of CraveOnline did not enjoy the Jenna , Danny , and Kenneth plot explaining that it unfolded " very strangely , and eventually saps a good deal of energy out of the show . It 's a dead @-@ end sub @-@ plot that 's simply useless . " Firecloud gave this episode a 7 out of 10 rating .

 When Karthi returned to India , he met director Mani Ratnam , who offered him the role of Arjun ( later played by Siddharth ) in the film <unk> Ezhuthu . He declined the offer and worked as an assistant director on the same film and its Hindi version Yuva because he wanted to become a film director and preferred directing to acting , though he did appear as an extra in Aaytha Ezhuthu . He continued to receive acting offers and his father convinced him to take up acting , telling him " ... one can always direct films but one will not get a chance to act once you grow older " . He accepted his first acting assignment in April 2005 . When director Ameer approached him to play the titular character in the film Paruthiveeran , he accepted the offer because the film was " ... so compelling " . The film was released in July 2005 and experienced financial difficulties , and was almost abandoned by mid – 2006 . It was released in January 2007 , to critical acclaim and became commercially successful . 
 Critics unanimously praised Karthi 's portrayal of a careless village ruffian . Behindwoods said : " He has done away with every trace of sophistication in his body language and even handles the sickle with consummate ease . He looks every inch a hot blooded youngster from some rural part of Tamil Nadu [ and ] appears seasoned in the romantic scenes ... <unk> people might not believe that this is the young man ’ s big screen debut . Look out for this guy ... " . Sify said : " It ’ s hard to believe that it is Karthi ’ s debut film as he is just spectacular . His expressions , anger , laughter and anguish are all so realistic that you can feel the fire in him . " Rediff called his performance " excellent " , and " ... one of the top performances of 2007 " . Karthi received several accolades for his performance , including the Filmfare Award for Best Actor in Tamil .

 In October 2006 , Karthi signed his second project under Selvaraghavan 's direction , Idhu Maalai Nerathu Mayakkam , which was supposed to be a romance film , featuring Sandhya as the female lead . Karthi 's character was a " ... sophisticated upmarket stylish guy ... " . Selvaraghavan abandoned that project and in July 2007 , he announced the production of an adventure film titled Aayirathil Oruvan with Karthi in the lead role . Filming began later that year and was expected to be completed by February 2008 . The producers planned to release it in mid @-@ 2008 , but production was delayed and filming continued until early 2009 . He had agreed to play the lead character in Linguswamy 's next film , Paiyaa , in September 2007 . Because of the slow progress of Aayirathil Oruvan , Paiyaa was postponed several times . He later said that he became anxious because he received several film offers but could not work on them because he needed to maintain the continuity of his looks . During the filming of Aayirathil Oruvan , producer Ravindran complained that Karthi was trying to change his look and move on to Paiyaa before finishing his commitments . 
 Aayirathil Oruvan was released in early 2010 . Karthi 's portrayal of a chief coolie was often compared to that in his debut film . Sify called Karthi 's performance " ... a scream . " , and said , " Right from his introduction scene till the end , he is lovable and provides humour . " , and that he had " ... made a sensational comeback ... " . 
 In April 2010 , Linguswamy 's Paiyaa released . A romantic road @-@ trip film , featuring a blockbuster album by Yuvan Shankar Raja , it was very successful . For the first time , he enacted a character that lives in an urban area . He said that he accepted the film because he desperately wanted to play a cool dude on screen . Karthi 's performances in Aayirathil Oruvan and Paiyaa earned him further nominations at the 58th Filmfare Awards South in the Best Actor category . Both films were dubbed into Telugu as <unk> Okkadu and <unk> , respectively , and were successful . 
 Karthi 's third film in 2010 was <unk> 's thriller Naan Mahaan Alla , in which he played a middle class youth from Chennai whose life is disrupted when his father is killed . It received good reviews , was very popular , and Karthi 's performances was praised by critics . Sreedhar Pillai wrote for Sify : " [ Karthi ] nails the character to perfection " ... He is one good reason to see the film . " Bhama Devi Ravi of Times of India wrote : " ... what a pleasure to see Karthi deliver his best performance to date ... " . Rediff wrote that " Karthi has simply had a ball ... " and " It 's been a long time since you saw an actor who can be as convincing in sadness and rage , as in happiness . " Naan Mahaan Alla was dubbed into Telugu and released as Naa Peru Shiva in 2011 ; it was very successful and earned Karthi some Telugu film offers . 
 Karthi 's next film was the action – masala Siruthai ( 2011 ) , a remake of the 2006 Telugu film Vikramarkudu . He played two roles ; a thief and a police officer . Karthi 's performances received favourable reviews . Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu wrote : " Karthi looks and performs better with every film . Siruthai exemplifies the observation " . Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff wrote : " But the film belongs to Rocket Raja ( Karthi ) , the sort of adorable ruffian Tamil cinema has been missing for a while . He picks pockets , slices off handbags , charms women and even bashes ( ! ) them up without a single jolt to his conscience . " Despite gaining mixed critical response , the film achieved financial success , becoming one of the highest @-@ grossing Tamil films of 2011 . In 2011 , Siruthai became Karthi 's biggest commercial success , cementing his position in the Tamil film industry . Sify said that Karthi had become " ... one of the hottest stars in Kollywood " . He made a special appearance in a song in K. V. Anand 's Ko ( 2011 ) , alongside other prominent actors from Tamil cinema .

 Karthi 's next release was Rajesh M 's All in All Azhagu Raja , which featured him opposite Kajal Aggarwal and Santhanam . The film was released on Diwali 2013 , and received mostly negative reviews from critics , with Behindwoods saying " Though the laughs are spread across a few moments , when [ All in All Azhagu Raja ] is pitted against Rajesh 's other wholesome ' <unk> ' such as <unk> and Boss [ Engira Bhaskaran ] , it falls way short " and Sify saying " The trouble with [ All in All Azhagu Raja ] is that it lacks basic storyline and took the audiences for granted . The film has no real script to speak of , at best a skeletal plot . " His next film was Venkat Prabhu 's <unk> , which was released in December 2013 , opening to positive reviews and became a box office success .

 = French destroyer Panthère = 
 The French destroyer Panthère was a Chacal @-@ class destroyer built for the French Navy during the 1920s . Aside from cruises to the English Channel and the French West Indies , she spent her entire career in the Mediterranean Sea . The ship was assigned to the Torpedo School at Toulon in 1932 and remained there until World War II began in September 1939 . She was then assigned convoy escort duties in the Atlantic and was being refitted when the Battle of France began in May 1940 . After the surrender of France a month later , Panthère was reduced to reserve . When the Germans attempted to seize the French fleet there in November 1942 , she was one of the few ships that was not scuttled and was captured virtually intact . 
 The Germans later turned her over to the Royal Italian Navy ( Regia Marina ) who renamed her FR 22 when they recommissioned her in early 1943 . The ship was scuttled when Italy surrendered in September and scrapped after the war . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The Chacal @-@ class ships were designed to counter the large Italian Leone @-@ class destroyers . They had an overall length of 126 @.@ 8 meters ( 416 ft 0 in ) , a beam of 11 @.@ 1 meters ( 36 ft 5 in ) , and a draft of 4 @.@ 1 meters ( 13 ft 5 in ) . The ships displaced 2 @,@ 126 metric tons ( 2 @,@ 092 long tons ) at standard and 2 @,@ 980 – 3 @,@ 075 metric tons ( 2 @,@ 933 – 3 @,@ 026 long tons ) at deep load . They were powered by two geared steam turbines , each driving one propeller shaft , using steam provided by five du Temple boilers . The turbines were designed to produce 50 @,@ 000 metric horsepower ( 37 @,@ 000 kW ; 49 @,@ 000 shp ) , which would propel the ship at 35 @.@ 5 knots ( 65 @.@ 7 km / h ; 40 @.@ 9 mph ) . During her sea trials on 20 April 1927 , Panthère 's turbines provided 56 @,@ 900 metric horsepower ( 41 @,@ 800 kW ; 56 @,@ 100 shp ) and she reached 35 @.@ 7 knots ( 66 @.@ 1 km / h ; 41 @.@ 1 mph ) for a single hour . The ships carried 530 metric tons ( 522 long tons ) of fuel oil which gave them a range of 3 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 600 km ; 3 @,@ 500 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . Their crew consisted of 10 officers and 187 crewmen in peacetime and 12 officers and 209 enlisted men in wartime . 
 The main armament of the Chacal @-@ class ships consisted of five Canon de 130 mm modèle 1919 guns in single mounts , one superfiring pair fore and aft of the superstructure and the fifth gun abaft the aft funnel . The guns were numbered ' 1' to ' 5' from front to rear . Their anti @-@ aircraft armament consisted of two Canon de 75 mm modèle 1924 guns in single mounts positioned amidships . The ships carried two above @-@ water triple sets of 550 @-@ millimeter ( 21 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes . A pair of depth charge chutes were built into their stern ; these housed a total of twenty 200 @-@ kilogram ( 440 lb ) depth charges . They were also fitted with four depth @-@ charge throwers for which they carried a dozen 100 @-@ kilogram ( 220 lb ) depth charges .

 Panthère , named after the eponymous feline , was ordered on 26 February 1923 from Arsenal de Lorient . She was laid down on 23 December 1923 , once the slipway was vacated by her sister ship Jaguar . Launched on 27 October 1924 , commissioned on 1 November 1926 , completed on 4 January 1927 and entered service a month later . Completion was delayed by problems with her propulsion machinery and late deliveries by sub @-@ contractors . The ship was assigned to the 1st Large Destroyer Division ( 1ère division de contre @-@ torpeilleurs ) ( DCT ) of the Mediterranean Squadron ( renamed 5th Light Division ( Division légère ) ( DL ) of the First Squadron ( 1ère Escadre ) on 1 February 1927 ) based at Toulon upon completion , together with her sisters Jaguar and Chacal . On 27 April 1927 , Panthère participated in a naval review by Gaston Doumergue , President of France , off Marseilles . The ship was also present when he next reviewed the fleet on 3 July 1928 off Le Havre . 
 Together with <unk> , Panthère escorted the light cruisers Lamotte @-@ <unk> and Primauguet to the French West Indies between 17 January and 30 April 1930 . Two months later , the ship participated in the naval review at Algiers on 10 May 1930 commemorating the centenary of the first French landing in Algeria on 13 June 1830 . The four depth charge throwers were removed in 1932 and the ship was assigned to the 9th DL of the Torpedo Training School ( Ecole d 'application du lancement à la mer ) at Toulon on 1 October 1932 . About two years later , the 75 @-@ millimeter guns were replaced by four twin mounts for 13 @.@ 2 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 5 in ) anti @-@ aircraft machineguns . 
 When the war started in September 1939 , Panthère was still assigned to the 4th DCT with her sisters Tigre and Lynx . She was assigned to the Western Command ( Forces maritimes de l 'Ouest ) for convoy escort duties from October to May 1940 where she guarded convoys traveling between Gibraltar and Brest as well as Casablanca , French Morocco , and Le Verdon @-@ sur @-@ Mer . In October – December , two depth @-@ charge throwers were reinstalled , No. 3 gun removed , and her depth charge stowage reduced to a dozen 200 kg and eight 100 kg depth charges to improve her stability . 
 In May 1940 , Panthère began a refit at Toulon that included the addition of piping between the forecastle and forward fuel tank to allow the ship to refuel at sea and the removal of the mainmast in favor of a platform with a twin @-@ gun mount for the 3 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Mle 1933 light AA gun . When France surrendered on 22 June , she was still being worked on and only one propeller shaft was available . Shortly afterwards , the ship was reduced to reserve with only a skeleton crew aboard and her anti @-@ aircraft guns were transferred to more modern ships . 
 On 27 November 1942 , the ship was captured almost intact by the Germans when they occupied Toulon and was turned over to the Italians on 14 December . The Regia Marina redesignated her as FR 22 and she recommissioned on 19 January 1943 after Pierre Laval , head of Vichy France , agreed to transfer her on 11 January ; she sailed to Taranto on 23 March where the Italians used her as a transport in Italian waters . The ship 's most notable mission was when she transported former Italian Premier Benito Mussolini from <unk> Island to La Maddalena , Sardinia on 6 August . The ship was scuttled at La Spezia on 9 September 1943 following the Italian armistice and broken up after the war . 
 = Typhoon Abe ( 1990 ) = 
 Typhoon Abe , known as Typhoon Heling in the Philippines , was the fourteenth named storm of 1990 Pacific typhoon season . Forming on August 23 from a tropical disturbance , the depression which would eventually develop into Typhoon Abe initially tracked in a steady west @-@ northwestward direction . As a result of an intense monsoon surge , Abe 's trajectory briefly changed to an eastward then northward path before returning to its original track . Abe only intensified by a small amount between 00 : 00 UTC August 24 and 06 : 00 UTC August 27 due to the disruptive effects of the surge , and on August 30 , Abe peaked in intensity as a Category 2 @-@ equivalent typhoon on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . After peaking in intensity , Abe crossed the Ryukyu Islands and the East China Sea , making landfall in China where it affected the provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu before entering the Yellow Sea , crossing South Korea , and finally transitioning into an extratropical cyclone . 
 Typhoon Abe killed 108 – 195 people after it caused flooding and landslides in the Philippines and Taiwan , ravaged coastal areas of China , and brought high waves to Japan . Abe , which is responsible for killing 108 in China , affected half of Zhejiang 's land area and a fourth of its population , leaving thousands homeless and causing ¥ 3 @.@ 5 billion yuan ( RMB , $ 741 @.@ 5 – 743 million USD ) to be lost in damages . Additional damage and one fatality occurred in Okinawa Prefecture in Japan , where at least ¥ 890 million yen ( JPY , $ 6 million USD ) in damage was caused . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The tropical disturbance which would eventually intensify to become Typhoon Abe was first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) in a Significant Tropical Weather Advisory as an area of persistent atmospheric convection on August 23 at 01 : 00 UTC . Located near the end of what the JTWC considered to be " an active monsoon trough " , the initial minimum sea @-@ level pressure was estimated to be approximately 1 @,@ 007 millibars ( 1 @,@ 007 hPa ; 29 @.@ 74 inHg ) . Following this mention , the disturbance tracked in a mostly west @-@ northwestward direction , traveling beneath a subtropical ridge , with a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert being issued at 06 : 00 UTC based on the improving state of the low . 
 Following an increase in the storm 's central convection , the JTWC determined at 00 : 00 UTC August 24 that it had intensified into a tropical storm which it assigned the designation 15W , and the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) began to monitor the system six hours later . The JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm on its scale at 00 : 00 UTC August 25 , and by the time twelve hours had passed , a strong surge in the monsoon westerlies had started to develop to the south of the storm 's convective area , slowing its westward movement . After enhanced convection associated with the surge on the east side of Abe 's main convective cloud mass wrapped around the north , the storm 's center of circulation reorganized to the north between the competing convective masses . At 06 : 00 UTC August 27 , the JMA upgraded Abe to a severe tropical storm with winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) , and as a ragged eye developed in the storm , the JTWC upgraded Abe to typhoon status six hours later . Late on August 28 , the JMA upgraded Abe to a typhoon on its scale , with ten @-@ minute sustained winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . 
 Following the monsoon surge , Abe returned to its original west @-@ northwestward track , further intensifying to become a Category 2 @-@ equivalent typhoon at 12 : 00 UTC on August 29 . A weakness appeared in the subtropical ridge in association with a short @-@ wave trough , and Typhoon Abe recurved through this weakness , taking it along the coast of China . Prior to making landfall , Abe attained a minimum atmospheric pressure of 955 millibars ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 20 inHg ) on August 29 at 18 : 00 UTC as determined by the JMA . It was found by the JTWC that Abe 's one @-@ minute sustained winds peaked at 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) at 00 : 00 UTC August 30 , and the JMA determined that its ten @-@ minute sustained winds peaked at 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) at 18 : 00 UTC on August 29 . As a direct result of this interaction with land , Abe weakened to a tropical storm at 12 : 00 UTC on August 31 , entering the Yellow Sea and crossing South Korea in the 30 hours that followed . It was determined at 18 : 00 UTC on September 1 that the storm had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone . The JTWC ceased tracking the system at 06 : 00 UTC September 2 , and the JMA followed suit 36 hours later .

 In the Philippines where Abe was known by the PAGASA name " Heling " , as a result of flooding and landslides caused by Abe , about 150 homes were washed away along Dalton Pass , leaving 1 @,@ 500 people without homes and an additional 85 people dead . Rainfall @-@ induced landslides ravaged areas previously damaged by an earthquake a month earlier , with landslide @-@ caused fatalities totaling 32 in the Philippine provinces of Benguet , Nueva Ecija , and Nueva Vizcaya , Significant flooding in Luzon resulted in the deaths of 12 people in Manila , and Philippine Airlines responded by suspending domestic air services . In response to flooding caused by Typhoon Abe and Typhoon Becky in the Philippines , President of the Philippines Corazon Aquino issued a proclamation declaring the existence of a state of public calamity for affected areas of the country . 
 Parts of Okinawa Prefecture in Japan experienced high winds and heavy rainfall as Typhoon Abe passed nearby . Precipitation totals as high as 306 mm ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) and winds of 115 km / h ( 72 mph ) were recorded in Ohara , and total forestry losses for Ishigaki totaled ¥ 500 @,@ 000 yen ( JPY , $ 3 @,@ 000 USD ) .

 Kamiya Kaoru ( <unk> <unk> ) , known as Kaoru Kamiya in the Media Blasters English @-@ language dub and Kori Kamiya in the English Sony Samurai X dub , is a fictional character in the Rurouni Kenshin manga created by Nobuhiro Watsuki . In the story Kaoru is the instructor of a kendo school in Tokyo , Kamiya Kasshin @-@ ryū ( 神谷活心流 ) . The students leave when many people are killed by someone claiming to be the Hitokiri Battōsai ( <unk> ) from the Kamiya Kasshin @-@ ryū " , damaging the school 's reputation . Kaoru is saved from the murderous impostor by the real Battōsai , Himura Kenshin , now a wanderer who has sworn to stop killing . During the series , Kaoru grows fond of Kenshin due to his good actions to society and becomes his ally . 
 Kaoru also appears in the film version of the series and other media of the franchise , including electronic games and a series of original video animations ( OVAs ) . Although Watsuki wanted to design Kaoru " more cutely " and to be " more fashionable " , he toned down those qualities and made her poor and " down @-@ to @-@ earth " . There was concern that Watsuki might kill her off , and critical reception of the character has been mixed .

 Kaoru is the instructor of the Kamiya Kasshin martial @-@ arts school . She inherited her fighting style and a small dojo from her father , who was drafted by a police swordsmen unit and died defending a comrade during the <unk> War . At the beginning of the story , Kaoru has no students and runs the dojo alone ; she seems likely to lose it when Kenshin helps her . Despite occasional mood swings and a reputation for bad cooking , she is independent , compassionate , courageous and a good fighter . In her first appearance Kaoru searches for the assassin Hitokiri <unk> , who claims to be from Kamiya Kasshin @-@ ryu . Kaoru is saved by the real <unk> , Himura Kenshin , and invites him to her dojo . One of her greatest fears is that Kenshin might return to wandering , leaving her alone again , and she is jealous if another girl ( such as <unk> Megumi ) is interested in him . In the series ' first story arc , Kaoru gains a student ( Myojin Yahiko ) and loses one ( Tsukayama <unk> ) . 
 When the Meiji government requests Kenshin 's aid to kill the former Hitokiri Shishio Makoto , he bids Kaoru an emotional farewell and leaves for Kyoto . Kaoru falls into a depression before she follows him to Kyoto after a pep talk from Megumi . With the <unk> 's <unk> Misao , she defeats one of Shishio 's <unk> : <unk> <unk> . 
 In Tokyo , after Kaoru learns about Yukishiro Enishi 's plans to kill everyone connected to Kenshin she teaches Yahiko the <unk> of the Kamiya Kasshin . Enishi says that his goal is not to kill Kenshin , but to make him suffer by killing the person most important to him : Kaoru . He kidnaps her , leaving a replica of her dead body . Convinced that he again failed to save the one who was most important to him , Kenshin flees to the Fallen Village and falls into a catatonic depression . When he learns that Kaoru is alive , he and the group rescue her from Enishi . They marry and have a son , Himura Kenji .

 In Samurai X : Reflection , although Kenshin and Kaoru are married he begins wandering again because he needs to help others ; he returns every couple of years . Kaoru lets him go , promising to welcome him home with a smile and their child . Kenshin develops a mysterious disease , and Kaoru convinces him to transmit it to her . He leaves to help people in the First Sino @-@ Japanese War , as he had promised the Meiji government . When he returns to Japan , Kenshin collapses in Kaoru 's arms and dies . 
 In the pilot issue of Rurouni : Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story , first published in 1992 , Kaoru is the sister of Megumi and Yahiko . Many of the character 's details changed in her transition to mainstream manga . 
 Kaoru appears in all Rurouni Kenshin video games ( including Jump Super Stars and Jump Ultimate Stars ) , primarily as a supporting character . In the manga reboot Rurouni Kenshin : Restoration , Kaoru works for Takeda <unk> to regain her dojo . After Kenshin defeats Takeda , she continues living in the dojo with Kenshin and his friends . Kaoru was played by Emi Takei in 2012 's Rurouni Kenshin and its two sequels .

 Watsuki said that he used " no specific model " and " no specific motif " in designing Kaoru , saying that if he had to name one model it would be Chiba <unk> of Ryōma no Koibito . He wanted to include the " commanding " qualities of Sasaki Mifuyu ( <unk> <unk> ) from Shōtarō <unk> 's <unk> <unk> . According to Watsuki , Kaoru is a " plain , regular girl " despite her commanding qualities . By the first Japanese compilation , he thought that the character worked and many female Rurouni Kenshin readers identified with Kaoru . At the time , Watsuki had not decided if Kaoru would be Kenshin 's love interest . Although he wanted to design Kaoru " more cutely " and to be " more fashionable " , he toned down those qualities and made her poor and " down @-@ to @-@ earth " . The artist described her ponytail as " de rigueur " for a girl practicing kendo . According to Watsuki , he enjoys drawing Kaoru but filling in her hair is " sometimes a pain . " At the end of Rurouni Kenshin , Kaoru received a new hairstyle . Watsuki felt that Kaoru would look odd without her ponytail , but her original hairstyle did not look maternal and he changed it for the ending . When female readers asked Watsuki if Kaoru was a strong fighter , he called the character " quite independent for her age " who could " hold her own " against the local dojo masters and compete at the national level ( although she is weaker than Kenshin and Sagara Sanosuke ) . 
 Watsuki said that in volume seven the series took on a more adult tone , influenced by the shōjo manga he was reading at the time . During the series he considered killing Kaoru off , deciding against it in favor of a happy ending for a manga aimed at young readers and influenced by the previous story arc 's upbeat ending . However , he thought the storyline then lost its main theme ( revenge ) ; readers praised and criticized the twist . Watsuki apologized to his young audience for the dark chapters suggesting that Kaoru was dead .

 Kaoru has been popular with Rurouni Kenshin readers , placing fourth or fifth in every popularity poll . Watsuki described Tomo Sakurai 's CD @-@ drama voice as " not too airhead @-@ y , " " not too high " and " not too low . " Kaoru merchandise includes plushes , keychains and <unk> . Miki <unk> ( who voices the character ) said in an interview that in the OVA series Kaoru is brave and very different from her original version whose characterization has been felt closer to the calm Yukishiro Tomoe . 
 Manga , anime and video @-@ game publications have responded positively to Kaoru ; in T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews , Carlos Ross called her a " spirited girl " . According to Megan Lavey of Mania Entertainment , the manga Kaoru is " a lot wiser " than her anime version . Kaoru and Kenshin 's relationship ranked eighth in About.com 's " Top 8 Anime Love Stories " , with Katherine Luther calling it a " classic romance . " 
 Kaoru 's Reflection OVA series version was criticized ; Efrain Diaz , Jr. of IGN wrote that although some of Kenshin and Kaoru 's private moments are touching , others are depressing . According to Anime News Network 's Mike Crandol , Kaoru is the least visually successful character redesign in the Reflection OVA . Citing the manga version 's " distinctive girlish charm " , Crandol said that the staff members tried too hard to make her look like Yukishiro Tomoe . Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network was disappointed by Kaoru 's lack of development in the series Rurouni Kenshin Restoration . 
 = Attack on German Flatts ( 1778 ) = 
 The Attack on German Flatts ( September 17 , 1778 ) was a raid on the frontier settlement of German Flatts , New York ( which then also encompassed what is now Herkimer ) during the American Revolutionary War . The attack was made by a mixed force of Loyalists and Iroquois under the overall command of Mohawk leader Joseph Brant , and resulted in the destruction of houses , barns , and crops , and the taking of livestock for the raiders ' use . The settlers , warned by the heroic run of Adam Helmer , took refuge in local forts but were too militarily weak to stop the raiders . 
 Brant 's attack was one of a series executed under his command or that of Loyalist and Seneca leaders against communities on what was then the frontier of western New York and northern Pennsylvania . New York authorities responded by ordering an expedition that destroyed Brant 's forward operating bases in Iroquois territory . 
 = = Background = = 
 With the failure of British General John Burgoyne 's campaign to the Hudson after the Battles of Saratoga in October 1777 , the American Revolutionary War in upstate New York became a frontier war . British leaders in the Province of Quebec supported Loyalist and Native American partisan fighters with supplies and armaments . During the winter of 1777 – 78 Brant and other British @-@ allied Indians developed plans to attack frontier settlements in New York and Pennsylvania . In February 1778 Brant established a base of operations at Onaquaga ( present @-@ day Windsor , New York ) . He recruited a mix of Iroquois and Loyalists estimated to number between two and three hundred by the time he began his campaign in late May . One of his objectives was to acquire provisions for his forces and those of John Butler , who was planning operations in the Susquehanna River valley . His first expedition was a raid on Cobleskill , and he raided other frontier communities throughout the summer . 
 When he raided settlements at Springfield and <unk> ( present @-@ day Jordanville ) in July , Brant left the survivors with warnings that German Flatts would soon also be attacked . The settlement of German Flatts ( now known as Herkimer due to a survey error in 1788 that reversed the names of Herkimer and what is now German Flatts on the south bank of the Mohawk River ) was founded in 1723 by Palatine German immigrants . The district was defended by a local militia regiment under the command of Colonel Peter Bellinger . There were two main forts , Fort Dayton and Fort Herkimer , on either side of the Mohawk . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 Although Brant had planned on raiding German Flatts sooner than September , the absence of John Butler delayed his plans . Butler had returned to Fort Niagara after his attack on the Wyoming Valley communities in July , sending Captain William Caldwell to <unk> to recruit men for the unit known as Butler 's Rangers . By early September it was clear that Butler was not returning to the area , so Brant and Caldwell launched the expedition with the men they had . The exact composition of the force that left Unadilla is unclear . Sources generally agree that 152 Iroquois , principally Mohawk , were in the force , but that the Loyalists ( in either Caldwell 's Ranger company or in Brant 's company of volunteers ) numbered between 200 and 300 . 
 Because of warnings received earlier that Brant was planning an attack , Colonel Bellinger had been sending out scouts in the direction of Unadilla to gather intelligence . On September 16 Brant 's company overwhelmed a scouting party of nine , killing a few and scattering the rest . One of the survivors was Adam Helmer , who ran 26 miles ( 42 km ) ahead of the advancing force to warn German Flatts . Colonel Bellinger sounded the call to arms of his regiment and sent an urgent request to Colonel Jacob Klock for the assistance of his regiment , while the settlers took refuge in the forts . 
 = = Raid = = 
 Caldwell , Brant , and their men arrived at German Flatts not long after Helmer 's warning , on the evening of September 16 , and began their attack the next morning . Because the settlers had taken refuge in the forts , there was no significant opportunity for the raiders to take prisoners or scalps . They demonstrated before the forts , but lacked heavy weapons with which to properly assault them . They instead rampaged through the communities on both sides of the Mohawk , destroying 63 homes , a similar number of barns , three grist mills , and one saw mill . They drove off a large number of horses , cattle , and sheep , killing those they could not take with them . The only buildings left standing were the forts , a barn , the church , and the homes of the minister and a few Loyalists . More than 700 people were made homeless by their destruction . Because of Helmer 's warning only three Americans were killed . Captain Caldwell wrote that his men " would have in all probability killed most of the inhabitants of German Flatts had they not been apprised of our coming by one of the scouts getting in and warning of our approach , and perhaps got to their forts " . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Klock 's regiment did not arrive until after the raiders had left . The militia pursued the raiders , but were unable to catch up with them . Some friendly Oneidas and Tuscaroras , however , capitalized on Brant 's absence from Unadilla to raid that town , freeing prisoners that Brant had taken while en route to German Flatts . 
 The Americans launched retaliatory raids in early October that destroyed Unadilla and Onaquaga . Brant and John Butler 's son Walter organized a retaliatory expedition against Cherry Valley , which was the scene of a massacre in November . This action and others by Brant and Butler contributed to the decision by the Continental Congress to authorize a major Continental Army expedition into Iroquois territory . Commanded by Generals John Sullivan and James Clinton , the 1779 expedition systematically destroyed the villages of Iroquois tribes fighting for the British , but did little to stop the frontier war . The German Flatts area in particular was the subject of repeated raids . 
 Walter D. Edmonds ' 1936 novel Drums Along the Mohawk recounts the story of Adam Helmer 's run and gives an overview of the German settlements along the river . It was adapted as a film by the same name , directed by John Ford and released in 1939 . 
 = Headstrong ( Ashley Tisdale album ) = 
 Headstrong is the debut studio album by American singer @-@ songwriter Ashley Tisdale , released on February 6 , 2007 , by Warner Bros. Records . Tisdale began working on the project after the first installment of High School Musical ( 2006 ) , and after she had achieved the feat of being the first female artist to debut with two songs on the Billboard Hot 100 . The singer worked with a variety of established writers and producers on the album , including Diane Warren , J.R. Rotem , Ryan Tedder , Evan " Kidd " Bogart , and Kara DioGuardi , among others . Commenting that the album garnered its title from her personality , Tisdale said she wanted to use her first album to formally introduce herself personally , and as not one of the characters she portrays . 
 Headstrong 's music derives mainly from the genres of dance @-@ pop and R & B , provided by electronica . Meanwhile , it incorporates hip hop beats and some tracks infuse dancehall and other world music . The album also lyrically explores themes in teen pop . Many critics compared her first effort to the first works of fellow Disney @-@ alums Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera . Carrying primarily an urban tone , the " hip pop " of Gwen Stefani is also said to be an influence on the album . Headstrong itself was given mixed reviews by critics , who while complimenting it overall , called it ordinary and panned the ballads . Critics were also ambivalent towards Tisdale 's vocal performance . Whereas , the album debuted at number five on the Billboard 200 , selling over 64 @,@ 000 copies in its opening week , it also charted in numerous international markets . It was later certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America and Irish Recorded Music Association . 
 The album 's lead single , " Be Good to Me , " charted moderately in the United States and select European markets . Tisdale 's breakthrough hit , " He Said She Said " peaked at 58 in the US , and appeared on several international charts , peaking in the top 20 in Germany and Austria . The last two singles were released in certain countries in Europe exclusively . The third single , " Not Like That " charted in the top half of several European charts , while the fourth and final single " Suddenly " charted in Germany . Tisdale supported the album with promotional appearances , High School Musical : The Concert , and her tour , Headstrong Tour Across America . The album was voted as the sixth best album of 2007 by the readers of Billboard . 
 = = Background and development = = 
 Tisdale got her first start on Billboard when she became the first female artist in history to debut with two songs on the Billboard Hot 100 , from the soundtrack of High School Musical . Tisdale called the feat " crazy , " stating , " When I think about artists like Madonna and Beyoncé ... it ’ s surreal . I seriously can ’ t comprehend it . " Soon after the completion of High School Musical , Tisdale began work on her debut album . In December 2006 , producer J.R. Rotem confirmed he was producing and writing with Tisdale for the album . 
 Tisdale said that the album was an opportunity for her fans to get to know her better , commenting , " People know my characters , but they don ’ t know me . " Noting that she never spills much information about her life in interviews , she also said that the album talks about life and things personal to her . Regarding the previous statement , the singer said she wanted people to understand that she was normal , and how they could relate to her . Tisdale titled the album Headstrong , because she calls her self a " headstrong " type of person , commenting that she was the term in the sense of knowing how she wants to look , sing , and come across . In addition to wanting to record songs that " touched " her and those that she could personally identify with , she co @-@ wrote three songs on the album , " Over It , " " Not Like That , " and " Suddenly . " 
 " Don 't Touch ( The Zoom Song ) " is a cover song , performed originally performed by Tata Young . Tisdale collaborated with Rotem , Ryan Tedder , and Evan " Kidd " Bogart on " He Said She Said . " Tisdale also worked heavily with production teams The Matrix and Twin . Additionally , Diane Warren , David Jassy , Guy Roche , Shelly Peiken , Sarah Hudson , Samantha Jade , and Bryan Todd were the other remaining music veterans that worked on the project , with the rest being relatively unknown writers . While the album does not contain credited featured artists , Jassy , Jack D. Elliot , Keely Pressly , Lauren Christy , Scott Spock , Graham Edwards , Kara DioGuardi , Victoria Sandstorm , Windy Wagner , Bryan Todd , Tata Young , and Marissa Pontecorvo provide background vocals on tracks . Jassy performed rap interludes on " Be Good to Me , " which he co @-@ wrote . The album was released in the United States on February 6 , 2007 . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Headstrong derives mainly from the genres of dance @-@ pop , electropop , and R & B while incorporating teen pop themes and hip hop and dancehall elements . It carries many elements of hip pop itself , and has been compared to the music of Gwen Stefani . The title track " Headstrong " mixes " slinky " verses with cheerleader chants like Stefani 's " Hollaback Girl . " The album begins with a " futuristic " introduction which contains excerpts of other songs on the set . " So Much For You " is a dance song about a confident girl who wants true love . " He Said She Said " has been described as " steamy dancefloor seduction . " " Be Good to Me " contains an urban beat . " Not Like That , " which contains influences of Middle Eastern music , covers the topic of the " familiar misunderstood @-@ celebrity , " but was referred to as more " worked up " than " whiny . " Containing rap interludes by Tisdale and clap along beats , according to Gary Graff of Billboard , the song is also liking to Stefani . " <unk> " makes use of syncopated beats and " old @-@ school " synths . " Over It " has " <unk> " effects . " Goin ' Crazy " has similarities to Britney Spears ' " ( You Drive Me ) Crazy , " while " Suddenly " seems to cover Tisdale discovering her stardom . Jon Dolan of Blender coined the song " The Little Mermaid @-@ worthy . " Spears is also said to be an influence of Tisdale 's " husky , alto " voice in " Over It , " and " So Much For You . " The dance song " Don 't Touch ( The Zoom Song ) " has an ' 80 's style beat . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Heather Phares of Allmusic rated the album 3 out of 5 stars and commented , " her voice is pleasant enough , but it 's not especially distinctive , and she 's not helped by a batch of songs that aren 't nearly as charming as High School Musical 's tunes . " Phares also said that although the album wasn 't winning considering the high @-@ profile songwriters and producers involved , " it 's fine for anyone who just wants to hear more of Ashley Tisdale 's -- and not Sharpay Evans ' -- singing . " Jon Dolan of Blender said Tisdale did not import her " spunky " High School Musical character in the album , and that even with the quality of producers , " no stylistic slipper fits right . " Gary Graff of Billboard said Tisdale went , " the contemporary CHR school of fellow Mouse products Britney Spears and first @-@ album Christina Aguilera — lots of synthesizer @-@ laden , beat @-@ heavy , layered @-@ vocal dance tracks " that varied between " come @-@ <unk> " and " self @-@ affirming anthems . " Graff commented , " she 'll have to develop a more defined identity before she can truly win our affections . " James Ross of The Arizona Daily Wildcat commended the album 's uptempo songs but critiqued the ballads , commenting she hits the right notes on uptempo numbers , while on ballads , " Any ' Musical ' fan knows that Tisdale can belt one out , but this is not apparent on the album . " Overall , Ross said , " Although the album fails in places , it is ll [ sic ] a worthy attempt by an up @-@ and @-@ coming pop artist to please her audience . "

 = Pittsburgh mayoral election , 2013 = 
 The 2013 Pittsburgh mayoral election took place on November 5 , 2013 . Democrat Bill Peduto was elected the 60th Mayor of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . The primary election was held on May 21 , 2013 . Incumbent Democratic Mayor Luke Ravenstahl , although eligible for a second full term , did not seek reelection as Mayor of Pittsburgh . 
 Initially , Luke Ravenstahl had indicated an intention to seek reelection in the 2013 election and had led early Democratic primary polling . Following Ravenstahl 's withdrawal in early March 2013 , several candidates not previously considering a campaign joined the race and others became speculated candidates . As of the primary election petition filing deadline on March 12 , 2013 , seven Democratic candidates and one Republican candidate , Joshua Wander , had filed to run . One Democratic candidate , Bill Robinson , stated he would run despite missing the petition deadline . After the field settled , there were four candidates seeking the Democratic nomination who were listed on the ballot and one seeking the Republican nomination . In addition , the sole Republican candidate also expressed an intention to run for the Democratic nomination as a write @-@ in candidate . 
 On May 21 , 2013 , Bill Peduto won the Democratic primary and Josh Wander , who had run unopposed in the Republican primary , won his party 's nomination . Peduto defeated Wander and independent Lester Ludwig in the November general election . He was inaugurated as Pittsburgh 's 60th mayor upon the expiration of incumbent Mayor Luke Ravenstahl 's term in January 2014 . The next regular quadrennial mayoral election following the 2013 election is scheduled for November 2017 . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the 2005 election , Democrat Bob O 'Connor was elected Mayor of Pittsburgh and assumed office in January 2006 . In July 2006 , O 'Connor was diagnosed with a rare form of lymphoma , which was initially believed to be manageable . His health deteriorated , however , and he died on September 1 , 2006 . Luke Ravenstahl , as President of the Pittsburgh City Council , was subsequently sworn @-@ in and assumed office as Mayor . At the time , at age 26 , Ravenstahl was the youngest mayor of a major U.S. city . 
 A special election was scheduled for November 2007 , which pitted Ravenstahl and Republican businessman Mark DeSantis . DeSantis mounted a serious campaign despite a heavy Democratic voter registration advantage in Pittsburgh . Nonetheless , Ravenstahl won the election by a wide margin to serve out the remainder of O 'Connor 's term , ending in 2010 . Ravenstahl was again a candidate for re @-@ election , this time for a full term , in the regularly scheduled November 2009 election . In the primary , he defeated City Councilman Patrick Dowd and attorney Carmen Robinson . Both candidates were able to tap into Democratic support ; however , neither were able to overcome Ravenstahl 's name recognition throughout the city . In the general election , the cross @-@ filed Ravenstahl faced and ultimately defeated independent candidates Franco " Dok " Harris , son of former Pittsburgh Steelers player Franco Harris , and Kevin <unk> , who would eventually become Bill Peduto 's Mayoral Chief of Staff after the 2013 election . 
 Ravenstahl had an unstable relationship with the Pittsburgh City Council throughout his term as Mayor , which included disagreements over the city budget . City Councilman Bill Peduto emerged as a political opponent of Ravenstahl 's , with Peduto mounting a primary election challenge against Ravenstahl in 2007 before dropping out a short time later . Prior to the 2013 election , Ravenstahl had not held a fundraiser since 2009 and it was uncertain whether or not he would seek another term ; however , an undisclosed source indicated to local news outlet KDKA in September 2011 that Ravenstahl would run for re @-@ election in 2013 .

 Several candidates expressed interest in running in the May 21 , 2013 , Democratic primary election . Incumbent Luke Ravenstahl officially announced in November 2012 that he would seek re @-@ election to a second full term . In addition , Bill Peduto , who had run for Mayor of Pittsburgh in 2005 ( losing in the primary to fellow Democratic City Councilman and eventual winner Bob O 'Connor ) and again for a short time in the 2007 special election before dropping out prior to the primary , announced his candidacy in December 2012 and was immediately endorsed by Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald . City Controller Michael Lamb , who stated that he had " every intention " of running for Mayor , declared his candidacy in mid @-@ January 2013 . Jack Wagner , former Auditor General of Pennsylvania , also publicly expressed interest in the race and filed a petition to run in March . Wagner also reportedly considered an independent general election campaign . 
 Polling conducted between late December 2012 to mid @-@ January 2013 by Civic Science found that a race between Luke Ravenstahl and Bill Peduto would be within single digit percentage points . The polling firm , however , emphasized that the poll was not intended to provide two @-@ way race numbers and that the polling ( which was completed on January 16 ) did not include Michael Lamb , who had entered the race the next day . According to the poll , blue @-@ collar primary voters were more apt to support Ravenstahl while white @-@ collar primary voters were more apt to support Peduto . 
 On March 1 , 2013 , Ravenstahl announced that he would not seek reelection , reversing a prior decision to run for another term . The announcement came amid an investigation of fund use at the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police , although Ravenstahl did not make any indication that this had contributed to his decision to withdraw . In addition , Ravenstahl alluded in his announcement to the medical condition of his mother , who had been suffering " medical issues , " but did not indicate that this had contributed to the decision either . Ravenstahl stated that he would serve out the remainder of his term , ending in January 2014 . Shortly thereafter , City Council President Darlene Harris confirmed her intention to run . In addition , Jake Wheatley , Jim Ferlo , and Ricky Burgess became speculated candidates . 
 = = = After Ravenstahl 's withdrawal = = = 
 In early March 2013 , following the withdrawal of incumbent mayor Luke Ravenstahl , a poll conducted by Keystone Analytics found that Bill Peduto was leading the race , garnering the support of 30 percent of respondents . Jack Wagner was second with 20 percent of respondents voicing support . Nearly a quarter of respondents , 22 percent , remained undecided . 
 The filing deadline to appear on the Democratic primary ballot was March 12 , 2013 , at 5 : 00 PM EDT . At this point , seven candidates had formally filed petitions to run for Mayor of Pittsburgh : Jim Ferlo , Darlene Harris , Michael Lamb , Bill Peduto , A. J. Richardson , Jake Wheatley and Jack Wagner . Allegheny County Councilman Bill Robinson stated that he would run for Mayor despite not meeting the deadline for petitions to appear on the ballot . Jim Ferlo , despite filing to run , dropped out of the race three days later , on March 15 . On March 27 , Darlene Harris dropped out of the race . On the same day , Jack Wagner received endorsements from Pittsburgh police and firefighter unions , as well as former candidate and State Senator Jim Ferlo . Also on March 27 , Bill Peduto was endorsed by State Representative Ed Gainey . 
 Michael Lamb ended his campaign on April 1 , 2013 and endorsed Jack Wagner . Shortly thereafter , on April 3 , a judge ruled that Wagner could use the approximately US $ 300 @,@ 000 in his statewide campaign account , leftover from his campaigns for State Auditor and Governor of Pennsylvania , after the usage of these funds was challenged by fellow candidate Bill Peduto . Also on April 3 , local media reported that candidate A. J. Richardson was arrested for allegedly driving under the influence after having been found by police passed out in his vehicle . Following his release from jail , Richardson dismissed the allegation as an attempt to sabotage his candidacy for Mayor and expressed an intention to continue his campaign . However , Richardson stated at a Mayoral candidates debate that evening that he would plead guilty to the charges . 
 Another poll released by Keystone Analytics in early April found that the Democratic primary had become largely a two @-@ way race between Bill Peduto and Jack Wagner , with Wagner taking the lead following Michael Lamb 's withdrawal and endorsement . Wagner garnered 38 percent in the poll , with Peduto receiving the support of 31 percent of respondents . Candidates Jake Wheatley and A. J. Richardson garnered 4 and 1 percent , respectively . 
 Two additional polls , released in late April and mid @-@ May by Keystone Analytics , showed Peduto regaining the lead in the primary race . In the April poll , Peduto 's lead was within the plus or minus 4 @.@ 38 percent margin of error ; he led Jack Wagner 38 to 36 percent . Jake Wheatley received 5 percent support and A. J. Richardson received less than 1 percent . A poll released in mid @-@ May , with a plus or minus 4 @.@ 9 percent margin of error , suggested that Peduto had expanded his lead over Wagner . Peduto was supported by 39 percent of respondents , while Wagner had 36 percent . Wheatley and Richardson garnered 8 and 1 percent , respectively . An additional poll , commissioned by the Pittsburgh Tribune @-@ Review and conducted by Susquehanna Polling & Research and released in the final week before the primary , also showed Peduto leading Wagner , 42 to 33 percent . The same poll showed Wheatley with 6 percent and Richardson with 1 percent .

 Bill Peduto and Josh Wander won the Democratic and Republican primaries , respectively , on May 21 , 2013 . In addition , City Council President Darlene Harris switched her party registration to " independent " on April 22 , 2013 , less than an hour prior to the deadline to be eligible as a third party candidate in the general election . August 1 was the deadline for third @-@ party candidates to file to appear on the ballot . Harris did not file to run prior to the deadline , however , and thus was not an official candidate . Independent activist Lester Ludwig was the only officially declared independent running . 
 As such , three candidates appeared on the general election ballot : Peduto , Wander and Ludwig . From the outset , Peduto was heavily favored by local media and political observers to win the election owing to the Democratic Party 's voter registration advantage in Pittsburgh , although Wander stated that it was not his sole intention to win the race , but rather to " convey a message that there is a choice . " Two debates had been scheduled in October 2013 , but Wander — who had been running his campaign from Israel , where he was working as a security consultant — and Ludwig did not attend . As a result , Peduto was the only candidate to attend the events , reformatting them as town hall events , and local television station WTAE @-@ TV cancelled an October 29 debate as Wander did not confirm that he would be able to attend . Ultimately , Bill Peduto defeated both Wander and Ludwig to be elected as the 60th Mayor of Pittsburgh and was inaugurated to succeed Luke Ravenstahl in January 2014 .

 = Hurricane Carrie = 
 Hurricane Carrie was the strongest tropical cyclone of the 1957 Atlantic hurricane season . The third named storm and second hurricane of the year , Carrie formed from an easterly tropical wave off the western coast of Africa on September 2 , a type of tropical cyclogenesis typical of Cape Verde @-@ type hurricanes . Moving to the west , the storm gradually intensified , reaching hurricane strength on September 5 . Carrie intensified further , before reaching peak intensity on September 8 as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph ( 249 km / h ) in the open Atlantic Ocean . The hurricane curved northwards and fluctuated intensity before recurving to the west and restrengthening , attaining Category 4 intensity for a second time as it neared Bermuda on September 14 . However , Carrie passed well north of the island and turned to the northeast towards Europe . Weakening as it reached higher latitudes , the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 23 , prior to affecting areas of the British Isles . 
 Due to its distance away from any major land masses , Carrie caused relatively minor damage along its path . On September 16 , the hurricane passed well north of Bermuda , causing minimal damage despite its intensity at the time , though hurricane reconnaissance flights in the area were postponed due to damage sustained by one of the aircraft . As it was transitioning to an extratropical cyclone southwest of the Azores , the German ship Pamir encountered the storm and capsized on September 21 , resulting in the deaths of 80 crew members on board . As an extratropical storm , Carrie brought strong storm surge and heavy rain to the British Isles , which claimed three lives . The hurricane 's long duration and path in open water also helped it attain a number of Atlantic hurricane records . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 In early September , a trough was identified along the western coast of Africa . Moving towards the west as a result of a strong Azores High , the disturbance passed over Cape Verde on September 2 . Observations from weather stations evidenced cyclonic rotation in the region . An airplane belonging to Panair do Brasil passed within the vicinity of the vorticity and as a result reported the formation of a tropical storm . In HURDAT — the official database listing all known Atlantic tropical cyclones since 1851 — the system was listed to have reached tropical depression intensity at 0600 UTC that day . 
 The depression continued to steadily intensify as it moved westwards , later reaching the equivalent of a modern @-@ day Category 1 hurricane by 0600 UTC on September 5 . On September 6 , the ship African Star encountered the hurricane 700 mi ( 1 @,@ 100 km ) west of Cape Verde . Reported winds of 92 mph ( 148 km / h ) and a minimum pressure of 1001 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 56 inHg ) confirmed the existence of the tropical cyclone . A Weather Bureau forecaster remarked that the hurricane was in a " blind spot " at the time due to its location outside of shipping lanes and Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance missions . Throughout the day , the hurricane intensified , reaching major hurricane intensity by 0000 UTC on September 7 . Shortly after , a United States Air Force reconnaissance flight headed for Bermuda was diverted to observe the hurricane . The flight reported a well @-@ defined eye measuring 20 mi ( 32 km ) across and a minimum pressure of 945 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 91 inHg ) , the lowest measured in relation to the hurricane . At the time , Carrie had maximum sustained winds of 135 mph ( 217 km / h ) , equivalent to a modern @-@ day Category 4 hurricane . Further strengthening ensued , and the hurricane peaked in intensity on September 8 with winds of 155 mph ( 249 km / h ) . 
 After reaching peak intensity on September 8 , Carrie began to gradually weaken due to a decreasing pressure gradient caused by a trough that had cut through the Azores High . By September 11 , the hurricane had degenerated into a Category 1 hurricane . A reconnaissance flight reported a minimum pressure of 984 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 06 inHg ) . At the same time , Carrie began to slowly curve towards the north in response to the trough . The storm later began to slowly reintensify , <unk> major hurricane strength by 1200 UTC on September 13 . The restrengthening of the subtropical ridge on September 14 caused the hurricane to quickly curve towards the northwest . This was accompanied by additional strengthening , and Carrie reached Category 4 hurricane intensity for a second time by 1800 UTC that day , later reaching a secondary peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) . National Hurricane Research Project ( NHRP ) observers described the hurricane as " one of the most perfectly formed hurricanes they had seen . " Carrie began to steadily weaken again beginning on September 15 . As it passed north of Bermuda the following day , weather radar imagery from the island indicated that the hurricane had an ill @-@ defined structure , with its eye having expanded to 40 – 70 mi ( 64 – 113 km ) in diameter . However , as it curved and accelerated eastward in response to a second trough of low pressure , Carrie maintained hurricane intensity up until September 23 , when it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone . The remnant system continued eastwards until it dissipated over Ireland by 1800 UTC on September 28 .

 After reports confirmed the existence of a hurricane in the eastern Atlantic , the Weather Bureau warned shipping lanes in the storm 's path . Small craft warnings were issued for offshore areas from Block Island , Rhode Island south to Savannah , Georgia on September 7 due to the threat of rough seas . After Carrie stalled on September 11 , the Weather Bureau gave Florida a slight chance of being affected by the storm , but the possibilities of the storm affecting the peninsula decreased after the hurricane curved northwards . After the storm was forecast to potentially impact Bermuda , schools were closed in preparation for Carrie , while vessels were warned of the oncoming hurricane . Most planes in Kindley Air Force Base on the island were evacuated , with the remaining planes weighted down by sandbags . After passing Bermuda , the storm was forecast to strike Nova Scotia , but instead Carrie curved towards the northeast . 
 As the U.S. Air Force was maintaining continuous reconnaissance of the hurricane using converted Boeing B @-@ 50 Superfortresses , one of the planes lost an engine and was forced to fly back to West Palm Beach , Florida for repairs . Four other undamaged aircraft were called back to West Palm Beach , including a crippled ship , while two other B @-@ 50s were held at Bermuda . Passing well north of the island on September 16 , effects of Carrie on Bermuda were minimal , with peak gusts reaching only 35 mph ( 56 km / h ) . 
 The German barque Pamir , en route from Buenos Aires to Hamburg , Germany , encountered the hurricane southwest of the Azores on September 21 while carrying barley cargo . The ship sunk due to the effects of Carrie , and 80 people out of the 86 crew members on board the ship perished . The final message received from the Pamir was a distress call and indicated that the ship had lost all of its sails and had been listing at a 45 ° angle . A search and rescue operation ensued after the loss of the ship was reported , involving the U.S. Air Force and Navy , as well as the British Air Force and Navy . Other ships from Canada and Portugal were also involved in the search . All associated groups were inconclusive in their findings , with no sign of debris left from the ship . However , two lifeboats and a raft were found , but they were empty . As an extratropical storm , Carrie impacted the Azores , though damages , if any , remain unknown . The extratropical remnants of Carrie later struck the British Isles on September 24 and 25 , causing strong winds , waves , and severe flooding . Winds from the system were estimated at 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) . The strong waves caused extensive property damage and killed three .

 Lasting as a hurricane for 20 @.@ 75 days , Carrie was at the time tied for second in terms of longest @-@ existing Atlantic tropical cyclones , alongside the ninth hurricane of the 1893 Atlantic hurricane season and behind the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane . Due to the hurricane 's long duration , the Weather Bureau office in San Juan , Puerto Rico issued 62 advisories on the storm , which was at the time the most ever issued in association with an Atlantic hurricane . Carrie 's long duration and distance from any land masses also contributed to its record travel distance of 6 @,@ 000 mi ( 9 @,@ 700 km ) . Hurricane Faith of 1966 surpassed this record after it traveled 6 @,@ 850 mi ( 11 @,@ 020 km ) . Hurricane reconnaissance flights throughout Carrie 's existence traveled further east than any previous flight due to the storm 's location far from any land masses . The initial flight on September 7 covered 3 @,@ 700 mi ( 6 @,@ 000 km ) and lasted for nearly 17 hours . 
 = Malkin Tower = 
 Malkin Tower ( or the Malking Tower or Mocking Tower ) was the home of Elizabeth Southerns , also known as Demdike , and her granddaughter Alizon Device , two of the chief protagonists in the Lancashire witch trials of 1612 . 
 Perhaps the best @-@ known alleged witches ' coven in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612 . Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft , seven of whom were found guilty and executed . The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials . The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court , Thomas Potts , who places it somewhere in the Forest of Pendle . Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building . 
 Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word Malkin . Despite its name , Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage . 
 = = Toponymy = = 
 The name Malkin has several possible derivations : it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud , and a term for a poor or shabby woman ; the similar <unk> was a word used to describe a lower @-@ class woman or slut . Malkin was also used as a term for a cat , particularly an old cat , as in <unk> or grey <unk> , and was an old northern English name for a hare , into which witches were said to be able to transfigure . It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of mal and kin as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower , which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time . Another possibility is a corruption of malt kiln , which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle , also known as Chattox , had broken into their fire house . 
 Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the Tower appellation . Malkin Tower may have incorporated a Norman peel tower , built as a defence against Scottish raiders or might have been a disused poacher 's lookout , but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage . Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building , perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock , which was converted into poor @-@ quality living accommodation . Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle , hence the building may have been no more than a hovel , and tower may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents . It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants . 
 Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower , or Mocking Tower . 
 = = Association with witches = = 
 On Good Friday , 10 April 1612 , Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the best @-@ known alleged witches ' coven in English legal history . The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns , also known as Demdike , and her granddaughter Alizon Device , two of the alleged Pendle witches . 
 On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law , a pedlar from Halifax , who refused to sell her some pins . Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible . She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate , Roger Nowell , on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft . Both were arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol , along with two other women . Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612 , allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle . Nowell learned of the meeting and , after interrogating Alizon Device 's " mentally sub @-@ normal " brother , James , concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches ' coven , and that all who had attended were witches . Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial , seven at Lancaster Assizes and one at York . 
 = = Location = = 
 The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain . It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials , as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials . The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the " melancholy associations " of the place . The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts , clerk to the court , in his The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster mentions Malking Tower many times , but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle , a former royal forest that covered a considerable area south and east of Pendle Hill , extending almost to the towns of Burnley , Colne and Padiham . 
 One contender is in the civil parish of Blacko , on the site of present @-@ day Malkin Tower Farm ; since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building . In The Lancashire Witch @-@ Craze , Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill , near to an old road between Colne and Gisburn . Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn public house ; the tower used to be featured on the inn 's sign . The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as <unk> Hole . It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th @-@ century <unk> court records for the manor of Colne as <unk> Yarde , described as being " in the north of Colne " , but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle , and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area , created in the 1840s , identifies the farm as Blacko Tower . The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial . 
 In 1891 local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill . Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower , and is often confused with Malkin Tower . Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys , historian John Clayton suggests that , aware of the story , he may have wished to provide the area with his own version . 
 Another possible location is somewhere near the village of Newchurch in Pendle . Douglas claims there is " persuasive " evidence that an area near Sadler 's Farm ( now known as <unk> Christian Centre ) was the site of Malkin Tower ; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area , and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as <unk> , Barley and <unk> . Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area ; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch , and John Nutter , whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched , lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm . Southerns ' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby . But neither the deeds of Sadler 's Farm , which date back to the 17th century , nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood . 
 Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area , including Newchurch , but nothing has been found . A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011 , after water engineers unearthed a 17th @-@ century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls , close to Lower Black Moss reservoir near Barley . 
 = 1988 Giro d 'Italia = 
 The 1988 Giro d 'Italia was the 71st running of the Giro d 'Italia , one of cycling 's Grand Tour races . The Giro started in Urbino , on 23 May , with a 9 km ( 5 @.@ 6 mi ) individual time trial and concluded in Vittorio Veneto , on 12 June , with a 43 km ( 26 @.@ 7 mi ) individual time trial . A total of 180 riders from 20 teams entered the 21 @-@ stage race , which was won by American Andrew Hampsten of the 7 @-@ Eleven – <unk> team . The second and third places were taken by Dutchman Erik Breukink and Swiss Urs Zimmermann , respectively . It was the third time – and second successive year – in the history of the Giro that the podium was occupied solely by non @-@ Italian riders . 
 In the first half of the race , the overall classification had been headed for several days by Massimo Podenzana . He had participated in a breakaway during stage 4a , which won him sufficient time to hold the race leader 's maglia rosa ( English : pink jersey ) for more than a week . Franco Chioccioli then wore the pink jersey for two stages before Hampsten took the general classification lead after the fourteenth stage . The fourteenth stage of the 1988 Giro , conducted in adverse weather including a snowstorm , has been recognized as an iconic event in the history of the Giro . After this stage , Hampsten began to build up a solid two @-@ minute barrier against the second @-@ placed rider , Breukink . This gap was sufficient to win Hampsten the race , despite losing around twenty seconds in the final two stages . 
 Hampsten became the first American , and non @-@ European , to win the Giro . He also won the secondary mountains and combination classifications , as well as the special sprints classification . In the other classifications , Fanini @-@ Seven Up rider Stefano Tomasini of Italy placed ninth overall to finish as the best neo @-@ professional in the general classification ; Johan van der Velde of the <unk> @-@ <unk> team was the winner of the points classification , and Carrera Jeans – Vagabond finished as the winners of the team classification . 
 = = Teams = = 
 Twenty teams were invited by the race organizers to participate in the 1988 edition of the Giro d 'Italia , twelve of which were based outside of Italy . Each team sent a squad of nine riders , which meant that the race started with a peloton of 180 cyclists . The presentation of the teams – where each team 's roster and manager were introduced in front the media and local dignitaries – took place on 22 May , in the courtyard of the Ducal Palace in Urbino . From the riders that began the race , 125 made it to the finish in Vittorio Veneto . 
 The teams entering the race were : 
 = = Pre @-@ race favorites = = 
 The starting peloton did not include the 1987 winner , Stephen Roche , who was sidelined for the majority of the 1988 season with a knee <unk> l 'Unità writer Gino Sala , author Bill McGann and an El Mundo Deportivo writer named several riders as contenders for the overall classification , including Andrew Hampsten , Urs Zimmermann , Erik Breukink , Franco Chioccioli , and Pedro Delgado . Sala believed Jean @-@ François Bernard came into the Giro in great shape and that the French rider could win the race if he could do well in the time trials and the mountains . In addition , Bernard Hinault told Sala that if Jean Francois could do well in this edition of the Giro , he could one day lead a team in the Tour de France . Former Giro champion Gianni Motta thought Hampsten would win because of the effort he was expected to make on the Gavia Pass stage . Motta believed that Hampsten would excel there , while the Italian riders – the majority of the peloton – would not because they did not realize its difficulty and thought the Gavia was " just another climb . " 
 The 1986 Tour de France winner Greg LeMond entered the race with his PDM – Ultima – Concorde squad , after a break from cycling due to injuries sustained in a hunting accident . Due to this , Sala did not see him as a front @-@ runner for the overall victory . Swiss rider Tony Rominger also partook in the race and was considered by McGann and Sala as a dark @-@ horse candidate for the victory after experiencing success at the beginning of his season . Guido Bontempi was seen by Sala as a favorite to win a couple of stages . Before he injured his right knee earlier in the season during the Tour de Romandie , many newspapers also believed Moreno Argentin to be a favorite to take several stages . Stampa Sera writer Curzio Maltese believed that Flavio <unk> could take one of the stages containing many categorized climbs which award mountains classification points , if properly supported by his team Del Tongo @-@ Colnago . 
 During the presentation of the teams , the riders were asked to choose their top picks for the overall victory . Roberto Visentini garnered the most votes from his fellow riders , but Delgado , Hampsten and LeMond also received many votes . Many media outlets felt that the overall victory would likely go to a non @-@ Italian rider due to the lack of Italian general classification competitors , but that Visentini had the best chance of winning out of competing Italians . 
 = = Route and stages = = 
 The route for the 1988 edition of the Giro d 'Italia was revealed to the public on television by head organizer Vincenzo Torriani , on 5 March 1988 . It contained four time trial events , three of which were individual and one a team event . The race organizers hoped that the number of time trials , including one on the last day , would keep the race hotly contested to the end . There were fifteen stages containing thirty categorized climbs , of which four had summit finishes : stage 6 , to Campitello Matese ; stage 12 , to <unk> ; stage 13 , to Chiesa in <unk> ; and stage 15 , to the Merano 2000 mountain . Another stage with a mountain @-@ top finish was stage 18 , which consisted of a climbing time trial to Valico del Vetriolo . The organizers chose to not include any rest days . When compared to the previous year 's race , the race was 336 km ( 209 mi ) shorter , contained one fewer rest day and individual time trial , and lacked a prologue . In addition , this race contained one fewer stage , but one more set of half stages . The race was televised in parts of Europe by the Italy 's national public broadcasting service , RAI . 
 The eleventh stage between Parma and Colle Don Bosco was cancelled due to protests near the finish line . The fifteenth stage was originally intended to be 132 km ( 82 @.@ 0 mi ) and to start in <unk> . However , due to very poor weather conditions , the start was moved to <unk> and the stage was shortened to 83 km ( 51 @.@ 6 mi ) . The route originally had the riders crossing the Stelvio Pass , but it was skipped due to snowdrifts that had developed on the roads . Excluding the finish on the Merano 2000 , the stage was relatively flat after the adjustments . 
 In previous years , the organizers had made the race easier for the Italian favorites by including fewer hard climbs . With the absence of Italian Francesco Moser from this edition , the race organizers included many famous and difficult climbs , such as the Gavia Pass . Moser himself stated that the route contained many difficult climbs and was not helping Italian cycling to prosper at a time when he believed it to be ailing . When asked about the route for the 1988 edition , 7 @-@ Eleven – <unk> rider Bob Roll said " Those sons of bitches put every mountain they could find in the race that year . " Three @-@ time winner Gino Bartali also believed the route to be very difficult and in favor of non @-@ Italian competitors . Gino Sala also felt the route was harsher than in years past and that the team time trial could influence the overall classification greatly . La Stampa writer Gian Paolo Ormezzano praised the route saying it was beautiful and well crafted but contained one flaw , in that the race did not finish in any major Italian city . He also expressed his delight with the uphill time trial to Valico del Vetriolo as well as the inclusion of the Stelvio , <unk> and Gavia mountain passes .

 The Giro began with a 9 km ( 5 @.@ 6 mi ) time trial in the city of Urbino , which was won by Jean @-@ François Bernard with a three @-@ second margin over Tony Rominger . Guido Bontempi won the second stage and moved to third overall , while Bernard gained a five @-@ second buffer over the second @-@ placed rider , Rominger . In stage 4a , Massimo Podenzana soloed to victory in Rodi <unk> , five minutes ahead of the second @-@ place finisher . This victory and the respective time bonus allowed Podenzana to gain the maglia rosa , which he held until stage 12 . Stage 4b was a 40 km ( 24 @.@ 9 mi ) team time trial won by Del Tongo @-@ Colnago , eleven seconds ahead of Carrera Jeans – Vagabond . Podenzana 's lead shrunk to a little over two minutes after his team , Atala @-@ Ofmega , finished two minutes and thirty @-@ six seconds behind Del Tongo @-@ Colnago . 
 The eleventh stage was run without problems until the final mile , when environmentalist protestors occupied the finish line and forced the annulment of the stage . The protestors were upset with a nearby factory , owned by chemical manufacturer <unk> , which the protestors claimed had been polluting the Bormida river . The next stage was marked by the appearance of the major mountains and by <unk> conceding the maglia rosa to Franco Chioccioli . The ensuing stages saw the general classification shift more frequently due to the intensity of the mountains and fatigue . 
 The fourteenth stage was memorable for its extreme weather , most notably on the final climb of the Gavia Pass . Overnight , a large amount of snow had accumulated on the Gavia , but the roads were cleared in time for the riders . Despite the cold and adverse weather forecast , the patron , Vincenzo Torriani , decided to go ahead with the stage . As snow fell on the riders climbing the muddy roads of the Gavia , Hampsten attacked at the base of the mountain but was chased by Erik Breukink , who eventually caught up and passed the American with seven kilometers to go . Although Breukink won the stage , Hampsten made the bigger story by becoming the first American to don the maglia rosa in the history of the Giro d 'Italia . 
 The start of the fifteenth stage was moved ahead from <unk> to <unk> , because of snow covering the <unk> Pass , but the summit finish in Merano was maintained . As soon as the climb started , Bernard , Urs Zimmermann and Chioccioli attacked . Bernard eventually shook off the two riders and won the stage , but with minimal time gain . The sixteenth stage was marked by rain – which turned into snow as the peloton rose higher – and by two protests while climbing the <unk> Pass . Near the summit of the last climb , Hampsten and a few others formed an escape group that was eventually caught in the final kilometers . The group raced into Innsbruck , where Franco Vona made a last minute attack that won him the stage . Bernard – who was in sixth place overall at the start of the seventeenth stage – crashed in a tunnel but managed to finish the stage ; however , the following day he did not start the leg and withdrew from the race . 
 The eighteenth stage , an 18 km ( 11 @.@ 2 mi ) individual time trial , would prove critical in deciding the overall winner of the Giro . The route started off with 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) of flat roads , before the climb to the finish at the Vetriolo Terme ski station in Valico del Vetriolo . Going into the stage , Hampsten led the race by 42 seconds over Breukink , a margin that was increased by a further 32 seconds after the time trial . The nineteenth stage featured three categorized climbs . Zimmermann attacked on the first , the Duran Pass , but was caught later by Stefano Giuliani who bridged the gap on the descent of the Duran . The two riders rode to the finish together in Arta Terme . Although Giuliani won the stage , Zimmermann moved into second place overall , after gaining over three minutes on the general classification contenders . 
 The twentieth stage came down to a sprint finish , won by Paolo Rosola , who was later disqualified as his teammate , Roberto Pagnin , was found to have pushed him during the sprint . As a result , the second @-@ place finisher , Alessio Di Basco , was awarded the stage victory . The penultimate stage was completely flat and culminated in a bunch sprint , won by Urs Freuler . Hours later , the final stage – a hilly 43 km ( 26 @.@ 7 mi ) individual time trial – took place . The weather conditions were fine for the majority of the riders , but as the general classification contenders were on the course , it began to lightning and rain heavily . There was a tricky descent about 18 km ( 11 @.@ 2 mi ) into the stage , which became more dangerous with the rain and ultimately resulted in the crashes of <unk> and Zimmerman . The time lost by Zimmermann cost him his second place overall . Lech Piasecki , who rode the course when dry , won the stage by a wide margin . Hampsten lost twenty seconds to Breukink , but it did not prevent him from becoming the first American to win the Giro d 'Italia . The other podium positions were filled by non @-@ Italian riders for the second year in a row and the third time in the history of the race . Breukink had been part of the non @-@ Italian podium in 1987 , behind Ireland 's Stephen Roche and Great Britain 's Robert Millar . 
 Stage success was limited to eleven of the competing teams , seven of which achieved multiple victories . Four individual riders won multiple stages : Bernard ( stages 1 , 8 and 15 ) , Bontempi ( stages 2 and 5 ) , Hampsten ( stages 12 and 18 ) , and Di Basco ( stages 9 and 20 ) . Toshiba – Look won three stages with Bernard and stage 7 with Andreas Kappes . Panasonic – Isostar – Colnago – Agu won two stages , with Breukink in stage 14 , and Freuler in stage 21a . Chateau d 'Ax won three stages , with a solo breakaway by Rominger in stage 13 ; Vona in stage 16 , and Giuliani in stage 19 . Del Tongo @-@ Colnago also won multiple stages , with Chioccioli in stage 6 , Piasecki in stage 21b , and the team time trial in stage 4b . Selca @-@ <unk> , Ceramiche Ariostea , Gewiss @-@ Bianchi and Atala @-@ Ofmega won one stage apiece . Ceramiche Ariostea rider Stephan <unk> took stage 3 in a sprint finish , as did Gewiss @-@ Bianchi rider Rosola in stage 10 , and Selca @-@ <unk> ' s Patrizio <unk> in stage 17 . Atala @-@ Ofmega 's Podenzana won stage 4a after a solo breakaway . 
 = = = Doping = = = 
 The race organizers performed anti @-@ doping controls throughout the race . Riders would be selected after a stage and have thirty minutes to get tested . The results generally would be returned between thirty and sixty minutes later . No rider tested positive in this edition of the Giro , but had this happened , the following penalties would have been applied : the rider would be demoted to last place of the stage , given a ten @-@ minute penalty in the general classification , a lengthy suspension , and a fine of one thousand francs . Although no riders tested positive , Roberto Visentini , Flavio <unk> and Urs Zimmermann – who placed second , third and fourth , respectively , in the eighteenth stage – showed up too late for their control tests and were given the penalties corresponding to riders testing positive ; after complaints and threats to leave the race from their team leaders , the jury later reverted their decision , and no penalty was given .

 Five different jerseys were worn during the 1988 Giro d 'Italia . The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider , and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass @-@ start stages – wore a pink jersey . The time bonuses for the 1988 Giro were fifteen seconds for first , ten seconds for second , and five seconds for third place on the stage . This classification is the most important of the race , and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro . 
 For the points classification , which awarded a purple ( or cyclamen ) jersey to its leader , cyclists were given points for finishing a stage in the top 15 ; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints . The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader . In this ranking , points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists . Each climb was ranked as either first , second or third category , with more points available for higher category climbs . The Cima Coppi , the race 's highest point of elevation , carried more points than the other first category climbs . The Cima Coppi for this edition of the Giro was supposed to be the Stelvio Pass , however the day the peloton was supposed to climb it , heavy snow cover forced the organization to omit it from the stage . The white jersey was worn by the leader of young rider classification , a ranking decided the same way as the general classification , but considering only neo @-@ professional cyclists ( in their first three years of professional racing ) . 
 The combination classification , represented by a blue jersey , was calculated by summing up the points obtained by each rider in the other classifications ; the leader was the rider with the lowest total of points . Although no jersey was awarded , there was also one classification for the teams , in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added ; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time .

 After the race , Andrew Hampsten told El Mundo Deportivo that he believed this was the biggest win of his career so far and thought he could win the upcoming Tour de France . Hampsten stated that Jean @-@ François Bernard and Pedro Delgado both lacked awareness when attacking in the mountains and did not make the most of the time trials , but believed they would be more active in the Tour de France . In addition , Hampsten thought Bernard and Roberto Visentini did not perform to their expectations . He did not go on to win the Tour de France , but placed fifteenth overall . Runner @-@ up Erik Breukink stated he was satisfied with his second @-@ place finish and that he came to the race in order to prepare for the Tour de France in July . At the Tour , he finished in twelfth overall and won the young rider classification for being the highest ranked rider in the general classification under the age of 25 . Third place finisher Urs Zimmermann reflected on the race and stated that his chance of winning the overall race were gone after the Gavia <unk> l <unk> writer Gino Sala looked back on the race and believed Delgado did not perform well and was not a serious threat to win the race . Luis Gómez , a writer for El País , thought Delgado did not prepare properly for the Giro . 
 In 2012 , the organizer of the Giro d 'Italia , RCS Sport , did a survey on the greatest moments in the history of the Giro by interviewing over 100 journalists . The 1988 race was mentioned several times as one of the most memorable , with the journalists citing the fourteenth stage that traversed the Gavia Pass as the highlight . Several writers have referred to the fourteenth stage as being " epic " or " iconic " due to the weather conditions the riders battled over difficult climbs and unpaved roads to finish the stage . According to <unk> writer Jason Sumner , a photo from the fourteenth stage depicting the future winner Andrew Hampsten climbing the Gavia while a snowstorm blows in the foreground has become a widely known image even non @-@ cycling fans would recognize . After the stage , La Gazzetta dello Sport called the stage " The Day the Big Men Cried , " with the stage still being commonly referred to as such . 
 = M @-@ 57 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 57 is an east – west state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan . The 105 @.@ 377 @-@ mile ( 169 @.@ 588 km ) highway connects US Highway 131 ( US 131 ) near Rockford on the west end to M @-@ 15 near Otisville in the Lower Peninsula . In between , the mostly rural highway passes through farmland and connects several highways and smaller towns together . Three of these highways are freeways : US 131 , US 127 and Interstate 75 ( I @-@ 75 ) . Along the way , between 3 @,@ 700 and 22 @,@ 300 vehicles use the highway daily . 
 The current highway that bears the M @-@ 57 moniker is the second to do so . The first is now M @-@ 75 in the Northern Lower Peninsula . This second highway was designated in the 1930s along a different , but parallel , routing . The first major changes shifted that routing southward to the current corridor in stages . Through additional extensions and truncations , the modern routing was formed by the 1970s . 
 = = Route description = = 
 M @-@ 57 is a rural , two @-@ lane highway crossing the south central Lower Peninsula . The western terminus is at US 131 , 14 miles ( 23 km ) north of Grand Rapids near Rockford in northern Kent County . East of the terminus is Rosie 's Diner , which is the original shooting location for the Bounty Paper Towel commercials of the 1970s featuring Rosie the Waitress . The diner was moved from Little Ferry , New Jersey to its current location in 1990 . From Rockford , M @-@ 57 runs east through rural farmland on 14 Mile Road into southern Montcalm County . East of the county line , the highway follows Carson City Road into the outskirts of Greenville . M @-@ 57 runs through a retail corridor before becoming Washington Street in town where it meets M @-@ 91 . Washington Street crosses the Flat River and exits Greenville . Continuing eastward , the trunkline passes through more farmland on Carson City Road . It meets M @-@ 66 at a rural four @-@ way intersection before passing into Carson City near the Gratiot county line . M @-@ 57 follows Cleveland Road , passing to the south of the communities of Middleton and <unk> . Near Pompeii , M @-@ 57 meets US 127 at a folded diamond interchange along the expressway portion of the latter highway . 
 Cleveland Road continues east running near Ashley and into Saginaw County . In between Ashley and the county line , the highway crosses a branch of the Great Lakes Central Railroad . M @-@ 57 follows Brady Road and crosses M @-@ 52 just west of Chesaning . Further east , the trunkline crosses another line of the Great Lakes Central . The highway follows Broad Street into town and over the Shiawassee River . On the east banks , M @-@ 57 runs along Main Street south along the river to a junction with Peet Road where it then turns east along the latter road out of town . The highway passes through more farm fields and through Layton Corners on the way to a junction with M @-@ 13 on the Saginaw – Genesee county line . At Montrose , M @-@ 57 crosses the Flint River , and a line of the Huron and Eastern Railway . Now running along Vienna Road , the trunkline meets I @-@ 75 / US 23 west of Clio . As it enters town , it crosses a line of the Saginaw Bay Southern Railway . This segment of the highway passes through the northernmost suburbs of Flint , and this section is where the heaviest traffic levels along the whole highway are found . As part of its maintenance duties , the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) tracks these traffic levels using a metric known as average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) . This figure is a calculation of the average traffic volume for a segment of roadway on any average day of the year . In 2009 , MDOT determined that an average of 22 @,@ 280 vehicles used the section of M @-@ 57 through Clio daily . East of this area , the highway once again passes through rural agricultural lands on the way to its eastern terminus at M @-@ 15 , one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) north of Otisville . This terminal section of the trunkline had the lowest traffic levels in 2009 at 3 @,@ 737 vehicles AADT . No section of M @-@ 57 has been listed on the National Highway System , a system of roadways important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility .

 In 1919 , the Michigan State Highway Department signposted the highway system in the state for the first time . At that time , M @-@ 57 designation was originally used in Charlevoix County from Boyne Falls at M @-@ 13 ( now US 131 ) through Boyne City and back to then M @-@ 13 . That highway 's number was changed to M @-@ 75 in 1926 . By the next year , the number was then assigned to a state trunkline that connected between Quinnesec and the Wisconsin state line in the Upper Peninsula . This second iteration was short @-@ lived as it was replaced by an extension of US 141 into Michigan .

 In 1930 , M @-@ 57 was designated from M @-@ 66 ( now M @-@ 91 ) near Langston to M @-@ 47 ( now M @-@ 52 ) in St. Charles . By the mid 1936 , the section between Ithaca and St. Charles was removed from the state highway system when the designation was shifted south to run between Ashley and Chesaning . In the process , M @-@ 57 was run concurrently along US 27 between Ithaca and Ashley . The western section was similarly shifting by May 1938 . The new routing started at a junction with US 131 between Rockford and Cedar Springs and continued through Greenville and Carson City to Ashley . The eastern end was also extended from Chesaning to the Clio area . It was extended a second time by early 1941 to a junction with <unk> Road . By the middle of 1946 , the eastern end was extended a third time to end in Otisville . M @-@ 57 was lengthened after a western extension in late 1948 or early 1949 . The highway was routed concurrently with US 131 to Cedar Springs and then west to M @-@ 37 at Kent City . 
 A new routing on the eastern end was designated in late 1956 or early 1957 ; this routing shifted the eastern terminus out of Otisville to its current location . The last gravel section of highway was paved near <unk> by the Gratiot – Saginaw county line in the late 1950s . The last change to M @-@ 57 's routing came in 1973 . Then @-@ Congressman Gerald R. Ford opened a section of US 131 freeway on September 21 . The freeway ran between the two M @-@ 57 junctions along US 131 near Rockford and Cedar Springs . Afterwards , M @-@ 57 was truncated to the Rockford area , and the segment previously part of M @-@ 57 between Kent City and Cedar Springs was made part of M @-@ 46 afterwards .

 = Six moments musicaux ( Rachmaninoff ) = 
 Six moments musicaux ( French for " Six Musical Moments " ; Russian : <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ’ <unk> ’ <unk> <unk> ) , Op. 16 , is a set of solo piano pieces composed by the Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff between October and December , 1896 . Each Moment musical reproduces a musical form characteristic of a previous musical era . The forms that appear in Rachmaninoff 's incarnation are the nocturne , song without words , barcarolle , virtuoso étude , and theme and variations . 
 The individual pieces have been described as " true concert works , being best served on a stage and with a concert grand . " Although composed as part of a set , each piece stands on its own as a concert solo with individual themes and moods . The pieces span a variety of themes ranging from the somber funeral march of number three to the majestic canon of number six , the Moments musicaux are both Rachmaninoff 's return to and revolution of solo piano composition . A typical performance lasts 30 minutes . 
 In an interview in 1941 , Rachmaninoff said , " What I try to do , when writing down my music , is to make it say simply and directly that which is in my heart when I am composing . " Even though Moments musicaux were written because he was short of money , the pieces summarize his knowledge of piano composition up to that point . Andantino opens the set with a long , reflective melody that develops into a rapid climax . The second piece , Allegretto , is the first of the few in the set that reveal his mastery of piano technique . Andante cantabile is a contrast to its two surrounding pieces , explicitly named " funeral march " and " lament . " Presto draws inspiration from several sources , including the Preludes of Frédéric Chopin , to synthesize an explosion of melodic intensity . The fifth , Adagio sostenuto is a respite in barcarolle form , before the finale Maestoso , which closes the set in a thick three @-@ part texture . In six musical moments , Rachmaninoff illustrates completely , " that which is in my heart . " 
 = = Background = = 
 By the fall of 1896 , 23 @-@ year old Rachmaninoff 's financial status was precarious , not helped by his being robbed of money on an earlier train trip . Pressed for time , both financially and by those expecting a symphony , he " rushed into production . " On December 7 , he wrote to Aleksandr <unk> , a Russian composer he had met before he had composed the work , saying , " I hurry in order to get money I need by a certain date ... This perpetual financial pressure is , on the one hand , quite beneficial ... by the 20th of this month I have to write six piano pieces . " Rachmaninoff completed all six during October and December 1896 , and dedicated all to <unk> . Despite the hasty circumstances , the work evidences his early virtuosity , and sets an example for the quality of his future works . 
 Six moments musicaux is a sophisticated work that is of longer duration , thicker textures , and greater virtuosic demands on the performer than any of Rachmaninoff 's previous solo piano works . It is similar to Alexander Scriabin 's momentous Étude in D @-@ sharp minor ( Op. 8 , No. 12 ) — in both compositions , detail is more functional than <unk> in their musical argument . It is here , rather than in Morceaux de fantaisie ( Op. 3 , 1892 ) or Morceaux de salon ( Op. 10 , 1894 ) , that Rachmaninoff places specific qualities of his own playing into his music . There is passionate lyricism in numbers three and five , but the others require a pianist with virtuoso technique and musical perception . These were composed during the middle of Rachmaninoff 's career , and created a foundation of inner voices that he would elaborate on in his Preludes ( Op. 23 ) and Études @-@ Tableaux ( Op. 33 ) . Although he usually gave the première of his own piano works , he was not the first to perform these , and the date of the first public performance has not yet been determined . 
 The set 's name is inspired by Franz Schubert 's piano cycle , also called Six moments musicaux ( Op. 94 , 1828 ) , which are written on a much more intimate scale . 
 = = Composition = = 
 = = = 1 . Andantino , B @-@ flat minor = = = 
 The first piece has an andantino ( moderate ) tempo , is 113 measures long , and is marked at 72 quarter notes per minute . It is divided into three distinct sections . The first presents a theme in common time ( 4 / 4 ) with a typical nocturne figure for the left hand . A mid @-@ piece pause at roughly the same area in Schubert 's first Moments musicaux further emphasizes the influence of Schubert . The second part is marked con moto ( with motion ) , at 76 quarter notes per minute , and is a variation of the first theme in the unusual configuration of seven quarter notes per measure ( 7 / 4 ) . This part ends in a cadenza . The third section presents the last variation of the theme , again in common time , but in the fastest tempo yet , Andantino con moto , at 84 quarter notes per minute . The piece ends in a coda that returns to the first tempo , and repeats portions of the previous three parts . It ends with a perfect authentic cadence into B @-@ flat minor . 
 Andantino is the longest in the set by playing time ( about 8 : 30 ) . It is described as a " generic @-@ hybrid , " combining elements of the nocturne and theme and variation genres . The melody is chromatic , syncopated , and long , all idiosyncratic elements Rachmaninoff often includes in his works . Because of this , the Andantino is sometimes called an extension of his Nocturne in A minor of the Morceaux de Salon set ( Op. 10 , No. 1 , 1894 ) . However , Andantino stands on its own with difficulties , such as the sections with multiple phrases in a single hand . 
 = = = 2 . Allegretto , E @-@ flat minor = = = 
 The second piece , referred to as a " glittering showpiece " , is positioned in contrast to the lyrical and " atmospheric " melody of the first piece . The piece is in the quick tempo allegretto ( quickly ) , at 92 quarter notes per minute . It is 131 measures long , the most of all six pieces , but the second shortest in terms of playing time , usually no longer than three and a half minutes ( the shortest is number four ) . This piece represents a typical nineteenth @-@ century étude , similar in style to Frédéric Chopin 's Études ( Opp . 10 , 25 ) , with a melody interspersed between rapid <unk> figures . It is in strict ternary form with a coda : identical beginning and ending sections beginning on measures 1 and 85 , and a contrasting middle section starting on measure 45 . The second section radically changes dynamics , constantly changing from piano to fortissimo and even <unk> . It is , throughout , a relentless torrent of descending half steps and a cascading left hand figure reminiscent of Chopin 's Revolutionary Étude ( Op. 10 , No. 12 , 1831 ) . Ending the piece is a slow coda in Adagio ( at ease ) which closes with a perfect authentic cadence in E @-@ flat Minor . 
 Rachmaninoff revised this piece in March 1940 , changing the melody but leaving the constant sextuplets , proving that the rushing figures are not simple bravura or flair . 
 = = = 3 . Andante cantabile , B minor = = = 
 The continual gauntlets of number two are relieved by the third piece in the set , an " introspective <unk> [ daydream ] . " Drawing on the previous illustration of a " generic hybrid , " this piece is described as a mixture between the song without words and funeral march genres , to create what is called the " most Russian " piece of the set , containing both sonorous bass and a solid melody , characteristics of Russian music . 
 Comprising only 55 measures , this piece is one of the shortest but has one of the longer playing times of about seven minutes . The piece is structured as a three @-@ part form . The theme of the first section is played entirely in minor thirds , accompanied by a left hand figure of open fifths and octaves . The middle section has the melody in minor sixths , alongside a staccato octave bass . The lament of the opening theme transforms into an explicit funeral march as the left @-@ hand octaves become regular . 
 = = = 4 . Presto , E minor = = = 
 The fourth piece is similar to the second in the quality of its performance . The fourth piece reveals resemblance to Chopin 's Revolutionary étude in the taxing left hand figure place throughout . The piece is 67 measures long , with a duration of about three minutes , and has the fastest tempo of the set , Presto ( quick ) at 104 quarter notes per minute , and is the shortest work in terms of playing time . 
 Presto is in ternary form with a coda . The piece begins with a fortissimo introduction with a thick texture in the left hand consisting of chromatic sextuplets . The melody is a " rising quasi @-@ military " idea , interspersed between replications of the left hand figure , the mostly two @-@ note melody being a strong unifying element . The middle section is a brief period of <unk> falling figures in the right hand and rising scales in the left . The third section is marked <unk> vivo ( more life ) and is played even faster than the intro , 112 quarter notes per minute . At this point the piece develops a very thick texture , with the original left hand figure played in both hands in varying registers . The technique of rapidly changing the octave in which a melody is played , sometimes called " <unk> displacement " , is used to present the figure in a more dramatic form that increases the intensity of the ending . The ending , a coda in <unk> ( very quick ) , 116 quarter notes per minute , is a final , sweeping reiteration of the theme that closes in a heavy E minor chord , which revisits Rachmaninoff 's preoccupation with bell sounds , prominent in his Piano Concerto No. 2 and Prelude in C @-@ sharp minor ( Op. 3 , No. 2 ) . 
 The piece is a major exercise in endurance and accuracy : the introduction opens in a left hand figure requiring span of a tenth interval . Additionally , octave intervals invariably appear before fast <unk> runs , making quick wrists and arm action necessary . The double melodies Rachmaninoff uses in this work exists purposely to " keep both hands occupied , " obscuring the melody and making it difficult for the right hand to project . This is the only piece in the set with indicated pedal markings . 
 = = = 5 . Adagio sostenuto , D @-@ flat major = = = 
 The piece is similar to the form of a barcarolle , a folk song with a rhythmic <unk> accompaniment . Playing it takes approximately five minutes , and it is 53 measures long , the shortest in terms of measures . It is an adagio sostenuto ( sustained at ease ) at 54 quarter notes per minute , with a simple melody presented in ternary form . 
 Lacking any prodigious figures or difficult runs , the piece displays Rachmaninoff 's capability for musical lyricism . Although the piece seems simple , the mood must be sustained by playing simultaneously restrained but dynamic triplet figures in the left hand . The melody , a chordal texture with frequent suspended tones , creates a difficult task in voicing , and placing the correct emphasis on the correct notes . Its relatively short melody lines are a direct contrast to Rachmaninoff 's characteristically long lines , giving a shorter time to bring out the phrases . 
 = = = 6 . Maestoso , C major = = = 
 The last piece in the set is a quintessential nineteenth @-@ century work , and has been described as an " apotheosis or completion of struggle . " The piece was once summarized as : 
 The final piece or movement of a cycle that is virtuosic and brilliant , employing the entire range of dynamics and sonorities available to the piano , bringing a set of pieces to a glorious conclusion . 
 This " stormy , agitated " work contains a " vehemently triple @-@ dotted main theme and only some brief midsection hazy sunshine [ that lightens ] the storm before <unk> thunders return and finally dominate . " Despite the dark imagery presented to describe the piece , the work is in C major , and the end result is more light @-@ hearted than dark , but not as triumphal as the Maestoso would make it sound . 
 Like the second and fourth pieces , number six is written in the form of an étude , with a repetitive but technically challenging chordal melody that is doubled in both hands . In all , the work has three distinct elements played simultaneously : the main melody , the continuous thirty @-@ second note broken chord figures , and a descending eighth note motif . Dynamics play a large part in this piece : the fortissimo marked at the beginning is maintained all throughout the first section , with only brief respites to mezzo forte . The middle section is wholly softer , and contains two areas with significant mounting tension , creating the aforementioned " apotheosis effect " with dramatic " false starts . " Here , Rachmaninoff manipulates the theme contrapuntally to develop a canonic effect . This " triple counterpoint . . . is titanic both in size and impact , and in potential for disaster , " referring to the tension , waiting for the final climax , in this " continuing explosion . " Immediately before the coda , the thick texture and canon suddenly disappear and the piece becomes piano . Upon entering the coda , the work resumes the forte theme and amalgamates to a majestic ending played <unk> . 
 Maestoso is one of the most difficult pieces in the set . Stamina and strength are required to sustain a full resonant sound , while the continuous thirty @-@ second figure can be tiring for the pianist . Consistent tempo is a problem for this piece , due to the melody being interspersed with two other elements . Additionally , the dynamics , mostly " loud " and " very loud , " indicate that an accurate vision of relative volume is necessary . Maintaining this accuracy while managing every other element of the piece and successfully presenting a musically solid performance continues to be the ultimate challenge of all . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The Six moments musicaux were well received by critics . During the writing of his Symphony No. 1 , Rachmaninoff was distracted from solo piano work , and the Moments were regarded as his return to mature composition . Although revolutionary and grand in style , they retain the charm of his early works , as mentioned by pianist Elizabeth Wolff : " They are typical of his early works , dense , rich in counterpoint , highly chromatic , poignantly nationalistic , deeply felt , and of course , exceptionally challenging to the pianist . " Later performances of this work would reveal that Rachmaninoff had hidden a subtle rhythm and vitality that emerged under the long , melodic phrases , furthering his acclaim as an incredibly complex musician . The Moments go as far as to " confirm the inexplicable inherent in genius " , with " exquisite melody , wondrous harmonic changes , ' heavenly brevity ' , " while maintaining " a sense of contrast and variety that allows each miniature to stand alone while complementing the work on either side of it . " Although it is unknown whether the financial reaction of this composition recouped his stolen money , the emotional reaction to it would be overshadowed for the following years by the catastrophic premiere in 1897 of his two @-@ years ' labor : the Symphony No. 1 , Op. 13 , 1895 . 
 = Abraham Lincoln = 
 Abraham Lincoln ( / <unk> <unk> / ; February 12 , 1809 – April 15 , 1865 ) was the 16th President of the United States , serving from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865 . Lincoln led the United States through its Civil War — its bloodiest war and its greatest moral , constitutional , and political crisis . In doing so , he preserved the Union , abolished slavery , strengthened the federal government , and modernized the economy . 
 Born in Hodgenville , Kentucky , Lincoln grew up on the western frontier in Kentucky and Indiana . Largely self @-@ educated , he became a lawyer in Illinois , a Whig Party leader , and a member of the Illinois House of Representatives , in which he served for twelve years . Elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1846 , Lincoln promoted rapid modernization of the economy through banks , tariffs , and railroads . Because he had originally agreed not to run for a second term in Congress , and because his opposition to the Mexican – American War was unpopular among Illinois voters , Lincoln returned to Springfield and resumed his successful law practice . <unk> politics in 1854 , he became a leader in building the new Republican Party , which had a statewide majority in Illinois . In 1858 , while taking part in a series of highly publicized debates with his opponent and rival , Democrat Stephen A. Douglas , Lincoln spoke out against the expansion of slavery , but lost the U.S. Senate race to Douglas . 
 In 1860 , Lincoln secured the Republican Party presidential nomination as a moderate from a swing state . Though he gained very little support in the slaveholding states of the South , he swept the North and was elected president in 1860 . Lincoln 's victory prompted seven southern slave states to form the Confederate States of America before he moved into the White House - no compromise or reconciliation was found regarding slavery and secession . Subsequently , on April 12 , 1861 , a Confederate attack on Fort Sumter inspired the North to enthusiastically rally behind the Union in a declaration of war . As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party , Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans , who demanded harsher treatment of the South , War Democrats , who called for more compromise , anti @-@ war Democrats ( called Copperheads ) , who despised him , and irreconcilable secessionists , who plotted his assassination . Politically , Lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents against each other , by carefully planned political patronage , and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory . His Gettysburg Address became an iconic endorsement of the principles of nationalism , republicanism , equal rights , liberty , and democracy . 
 Lincoln initially concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war . His primary goal was to reunite the nation . He suspended habeas corpus , leading to the controversial ex parte Merryman decision , and he averted potential British intervention in the war by defusing the Trent Affair in late 1861 . Lincoln closely supervised the war effort , especially the selection of top generals , including his most successful general , Ulysses S. Grant . He also made major decisions on Union war strategy , including a naval blockade that shut down the South 's normal trade , moves to take control of Kentucky and Tennessee , and using gunboats to gain control of the southern river system . Lincoln tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond ; each time a general failed , Lincoln substituted another , until finally Grant succeeded . As the war progressed , his complex moves toward ending slavery included the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 ; Lincoln used the U.S. Army to protect escaped slaves , encouraged the border states to outlaw slavery , and pushed through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , which permanently outlawed slavery . 
 An exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state , Lincoln reached out to the War Democrats and managed his own re @-@ election campaign in the 1864 presidential election . Anticipating the war 's conclusion , Lincoln pushed a moderate view of Reconstruction , seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness . On April 14 , 1865 , five days after the April 9th surrender of Confederate commanding general Robert E. Lee , Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth , a Confederate sympathizer . 
 Lincoln has been consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as one of the three greatest U.S. presidents .

 = = = Early life and family ancestry = = = 
 Abraham Lincoln was born February 12 , 1809 , the second child of Thomas and Nancy Hanks Lincoln , in a one @-@ room log cabin on the Sinking Spring Farm in Hardin County , Kentucky ( now LaRue County ) . He was a descendant of Samuel Lincoln , who migrated from Norfolk , England to Hingham , Massachusetts , in 1638 . Samuel 's grandson and great @-@ grandson began the family 's western migration , which passed through New Jersey , Pennsylvania , and Virginia . Lincoln 's paternal grandfather and namesake , Captain Abraham Lincoln , moved the family from Virginia to Jefferson County , Kentucky in the 1780s . Captain Lincoln was killed in an Indian raid in 1786 . His children , including six @-@ year @-@ old Thomas , the future president 's father , witnessed the attack . After his father 's murder , Thomas was left to make his own way on the frontier , working at odd jobs in Kentucky and in Tennessee , before settling with members of his family in Hardin County , Kentucky , in the early 1800s . 
 Lincoln 's mother , Nancy , is widely assumed to have been the daughter of Lucy Hanks , although no record of Nancy Hanks ' birth has ever been found . According to William Ensign Lincoln 's book The Ancestry of Abraham Lincoln , Nancy was the daughter of Joseph Hanks ; however , the debate continues over whether she was born out of wedlock . Still another researcher , Adin Baber , claims that Nancy Hanks was the daughter of Abraham Hanks and Sarah Harper of Virginia . 
 Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks were married on June 12 , 1806 , in Washington County , and moved to Elizabethtown , Kentucky , following their marriage . They became the parents of three children : Sarah , born on February 10 , 1807 ; Abraham , on February 12 , 1809 ; and another son , Thomas , who died in infancy . Thomas Lincoln bought or leased several farms in Kentucky , including the Sinking Spring farm , where Abraham was born ; however , a land title dispute soon forced the Lincolns to move . In 1811 the family moved eight miles north , to Knob Creek Farm , where Thomas acquired title to 230 acres ( 93 ha ) of land . In 1815 a claimant in another land dispute sought to eject the family from the farm . Of the 816 @.@ 5 acres that Thomas held in Kentucky , he lost all but 200 acres ( 81 ha ) of his land in court disputes over property titles . Frustrated over the lack of security provided by Kentucky courts , Thomas sold the remaining land he held in Kentucky in 1814 , and began planning a move to Indiana , where the land survey process was more reliable and the ability for an individual to retain land titles was more secure . 
 In 1816 the family moved north across the Ohio River to Indiana , a free , non @-@ slaveholding territory , where they settled in an " unbroken forest " in Hurricane Township , Perry County . ( Their land in southern Indiana became part of Spencer County , Indiana , when the county was established in 1818 . ) The farm is preserved as part of the Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial . In 1860 Lincoln noted that the family 's move to Indiana was " partly on account of slavery " ; but mainly due to land title difficulties in Kentucky . During the family 's years in Kentucky and Indiana , Thomas Lincoln worked as a farmer , cabinetmaker , and carpenter . He owned farms , several town lots and livestock , paid taxes , sat on juries , appraised estates , served on country slave patrols , and guarded prisoners . Thomas and Nancy Lincoln were also members of a Separate Baptists church , which had restrictive moral standards and opposed alcohol , dancing , and slavery . Within a year of the family 's arrival in Indiana , Thomas claimed title to 160 acres ( 65 ha ) of Indiana land . Despite some financial challenges he eventually obtained clear title to 80 acres ( 32 ha ) of land in what became known as the Little Pigeon Creek Community in Spencer County . Prior to the family 's move to Illinois in 1830 , Thomas had acquired an additional twenty acres of land adjacent to his property . 
 Several significant family events took place during Lincoln 's youth in Indiana . On October 5 , 1818 , Nancy Lincoln died of milk sickness , leaving eleven @-@ year @-@ old Sarah in charge of a household that included her father , nine @-@ year @-@ old Abraham , and Dennis Hanks , Nancy 's nineteen @-@ year @-@ old orphaned cousin . On December 2 , 1819 , Lincoln 's father married Sarah " Sally " Bush Johnston , a widow from Elizabethtown , Kentucky , with three children of her own . Abraham became very close to his stepmother , whom he referred to as " Mother " . Those who knew Lincoln as a teenager later recalled him being very distraught over his sister Sarah 's death on January 20 , 1828 , while giving birth to a stillborn son . 
 As a youth , Lincoln disliked the hard labor associated with frontier life . Some of his neighbors and family members thought for a time that he was lazy for all his " reading , scribbling , writing , <unk> , writing Poetry , etc . " , and must have done it to avoid manual labor . His stepmother also acknowledged he did not enjoy " physical labor " , but loved to read . Lincoln was largely self @-@ educated . His formal schooling from several itinerant teachers was intermittent , the aggregate of which may have amounted to less than a year ; however , he was an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning . Family , neighbors , and schoolmates of Lincoln 's youth recalled that he read and reread the King James Bible , Aesop 's Fables , Bunyan 's The Pilgrim 's Progress , Defoe 's Robinson Crusoe , Weems 's The Life of Washington , and Franklin 's Autobiography , among others . 
 As he grew into his teens , Lincoln took responsibility for the chores expected of him as one of the boys in the household . He also complied with the customary obligation of a son giving his father all earnings from work done outside the home until the age of twenty @-@ one . Abraham became adept at using an axe . Tall for his age , Lincoln was also strong and athletic . He attained a reputation for brawn and audacity after a very competitive wrestling match with the renowned leader of a group of ruffians known as " the Clary 's Grove boys " . 
 In early March 1830 , fearing a milk sickness outbreak along the Ohio River , the Lincoln family moved west to Illinois , a non @-@ slaveholding state . They settled on a site in Macon County , Illinois , 10 miles ( 16 km ) west of Decatur . Historians disagree on who initiated the move . After the family relocated to Illinois , Abraham became increasingly distant from his father , in part because of his father 's lack of education , and occasionally lent him money . In 1831 , as Thomas and other members of the family prepared to move to a new homestead in Coles County , Illinois , Abraham was old enough to make his own decisions and struck out on his own . Traveling down the Sangamon River , he ended up in the village of New Salem in Sangamon County . Later that spring , Denton Offutt , a New Salem merchant , hired Lincoln and some friends to take goods by flatboat from New Salem to New Orleans via the Sangamon , Illinois , and Mississippi rivers . After arriving in New Orleans — and witnessing slavery firsthand — Lincoln returned to New Salem , where he remained for the next six years . 
 = = = Marriage and children = = = 
 Lincoln 's first romantic interest was Ann Rutledge , whom he met when he first moved to New Salem ; by 1835 , they were in a relationship but not formally engaged . She died at the age of 22 on August 25 , 1835 , most likely of typhoid fever . In the early 1830s , he met Mary Owens from Kentucky when she was visiting her sister . 
 Late in 1836 , Lincoln agreed to a match with Mary if she returned to New Salem . Mary did return in November 1836 , and Lincoln courted her for a time ; however , they both had second thoughts about their relationship . On August 16 , 1837 , Lincoln wrote Mary a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship . She never replied and the courtship ended . 
 In 1840 , Lincoln became engaged to Mary Todd , who was from a wealthy slave @-@ holding family in Lexington , Kentucky . They met in Springfield , Illinois , in December 1839 and were engaged the following December . A wedding set for January 1 , 1841 , was canceled when the two broke off their engagement at Lincoln 's initiative . They later met again at a party and married on November 4 , 1842 , in the Springfield mansion of Mary 's married sister . While preparing for the nuptials and feeling anxiety again , Lincoln , when asked where he was going , replied , " To hell , I suppose . " In 1844 , the couple bought a house in Springfield near Lincoln 's law office . Mary Todd Lincoln kept house , often with the help of a relative or hired servant girl . 
 He was an affectionate , though often absent , husband and father of four children . Robert Todd Lincoln was born in 1843 and Edward Baker Lincoln ( Eddie ) in 1846 . Edward died on February 1 , 1850 , in Springfield , probably of tuberculosis . " Willie " Lincoln was born on December 21 , 1850 , and died of a fever on February 20 , 1862 . The Lincolns ' fourth son , Thomas " Tad " Lincoln , was born on April 4 , 1853 , and died of heart failure at the age of 18 on July 16 , 1871 . Robert was the only child to live to adulthood and have children . His last descendant , great @-@ grandson Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith , died in 1985 . Lincoln " was remarkably fond of children " , and the Lincolns were not considered to be strict with their own . 
 The deaths of their sons had profound effects on both parents . Later in life , Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons , and Robert Lincoln committed her temporarily to a mental health asylum in 1875 . Abraham Lincoln suffered from " melancholy " , a condition which now is referred to as clinical depression . 
 Lincoln 's father @-@ in @-@ law and others of the Todd family were either slave owners or slave traders . Lincoln was close to the <unk> , and he and his family occasionally visited the Todd estate in Lexington . 
 During his term as President of the United States of America , Mary was known to cook for Lincoln often . Since she was raised by a wealthy family , her cooking abilities were simple , but satisfied Lincoln 's tastes , which included , particularly , imported oysters . 
 = = Early career and militia service = = 
 In 1832 , at age 23 , Lincoln and a partner bought a small general store on credit in New Salem , Illinois . Although the economy was booming in the region , the business struggled and Lincoln eventually sold his share . That March he began his political career with his first campaign for the Illinois General Assembly . He had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as a natural raconteur in New Salem , though he lacked an education , powerful friends , and money , which may be why he lost . He advocated navigational improvements on the Sangamon River . 
 Before the election , Lincoln served as a captain in the Illinois Militia during the Black Hawk War . Following his return , Lincoln continued his campaign for the August 6 election for the Illinois General Assembly . At 6 feet 4 inches ( 193 cm ) , he was tall and " strong enough to intimidate any rival " . At his first speech , when he saw a supporter in the crowd being attacked , Lincoln grabbed the assailant by his " neck and the seat of his trousers " and threw him . Lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates ( the top four were elected ) , though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct . 
 Lincoln served as New Salem 's postmaster and later as county surveyor , all the while reading voraciously . He then decided to become a lawyer and began teaching himself law by reading Blackstone 's Commentaries on the Laws of England and other law books . Of his learning method , Lincoln stated : " I studied with nobody " . His second campaign in 1834 was successful . He won election to the state legislature ; though he ran as a Whig , many Democrats favored him over a more powerful Whig opponent . 
 Admitted to the bar in 1836 , he moved to Springfield , Illinois , and began to practice law under John T. Stuart , Mary Todd 's cousin . Lincoln became an able and successful lawyer with a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross @-@ examinations and closing arguments . He partnered with Stephen T. Logan from 1841 until 1844 . Then Lincoln began his practice with William Herndon , whom Lincoln thought " a studious young man " . 
 Successful on his second run for office , Lincoln served four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives as a Whig representative from Sangamon County . He supported the construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal , which he remained involved with later as a Canal Commissioner . In the 1835 – 36 legislative session , he voted to expand suffrage to white males , whether landowners or not . He was known for his " free soil " stance of opposing both slavery and abolitionism . He first articulated this in 1837 , saying , " [ The ] Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy , but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils . " His stance closely followed Henry Clay in supporting the American Colonization Society program of making the abolition of slavery practical by its advocation and helping the freed slaves to settle in Liberia in Africa . 
 = = U.S. House of Representatives , 1847 – 49 = = 
 From the early 1830s , Lincoln was a steadfast Whig and professed to friends in 1861 to be " an old line Whig , a disciple of Henry Clay " . The party , including Lincoln , favored economic modernization in banking , protective tariffs to fund internal improvements including railroads , and espoused urbanization as well . 
 In 1846 , Lincoln was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives , where he served one two @-@ year term . He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation , but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line . Lincoln , in collaboration with abolitionist Congressman Joshua R. Giddings , wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia with compensation for the owners , enforcement to capture fugitive slaves , and a popular vote on the matter . He abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient Whig supporters . 
 On foreign and military policy , Lincoln spoke out against the Mexican – American War , which he attributed to President Polk 's desire for " military glory — that attractive rainbow , that rises in showers of blood " . Lincoln also supported the Wilmot Proviso , which , if it had been adopted , would have banned slavery in any U.S. territory won from Mexico . 
 Lincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his Spot Resolutions . The war had begun with a Mexican slaughter of American soldiers in territory disputed by Mexico and the U.S. Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had " invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow @-@ citizens on our own soil " . Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil . 
 Congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it , the national papers ignored it , and it resulted in a loss of political support for Lincoln in his district . One Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him " spotty Lincoln " . Lincoln later regretted some of his statements , especially his attack on the presidential war @-@ making powers . 
 Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency , Lincoln , who had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the House , supported General Zachary Taylor for the Whig nomination in the 1848 presidential election . Taylor won and Lincoln hoped to be appointed Commissioner of the General Land Office , but that lucrative patronage job went to an Illinois rival , Justin Butterfield , considered by the administration to be a highly skilled lawyer , but in Lincoln 's view , an " old fossil " . The administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the Oregon Territory . This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold , and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in Illinois , so he declined and resumed his law practice . 
 = = Prairie lawyer = = 
 Lincoln returned to practicing law in Springfield , handling " every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer " . Twice a year for 16 years , 10 weeks at a time , he appeared in county seats in the <unk> region when the county courts were in session . Lincoln handled many transportation cases in the midst of the nation 's western expansion , particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad bridges . As a riverboat man , Lincoln initially favored those interests , but ultimately represented whoever hired him . In fact , he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge . In 1849 , he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water . The idea was never commercialized , but Lincoln is the only president to hold a patent . 
 In 1851 , he represented the Alton & Sangamon Railroad in a dispute with one of its shareholders , James A. Barret , who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares in the railroad on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route . Lincoln successfully argued that the railroad company was not bound by its original charter extant at the time of Barret 's pledge ; the charter was amended in the public interest to provide a newer , superior , and less expensive route , and the corporation retained the right to demand Barret 's payment . The decision by the Illinois Supreme Court has been cited by numerous other courts in the nation . Lincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases , in 51 as sole counsel , of which 31 were decided in his favor . From 1853 to 1860 , another of Lincoln 's largest clients was the Illinois Central Railroad . Lincoln 's reputation with clients gave rise to his nickname " Honest Abe . " 
 Lincoln 's most notable criminal trial occurred in 1858 when he defended William " Duff " Armstrong , who was on trial for the murder of James Preston <unk> . The case is famous for Lincoln 's use of a fact established by judicial notice in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness . After an opposing witness testified seeing the crime in the moonlight , Lincoln produced a Farmers ' Almanac showing the moon was at a low angle , drastically reducing visibility . Based on this evidence , Armstrong was acquitted . 
 Lincoln rarely raised objections in the courtroom ; but in an 1859 case , where he defended a cousin , Peachy Harrison , who was accused of stabbing another to death , Lincoln angrily protested the judge 's decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client . Instead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as was expected , the judge , a Democrat , reversed his ruling , allowing the evidence and acquitting Harrison .

 = = = Slavery and a " House Divided " = = = 
 By the 1850s , slavery was still legal in the southern United States , but had been generally outlawed in the northern states , including Illinois , whose original 1818 Constitution forbade slavery , as required by the Northwest Ordinance . Lincoln disapproved of slavery , and the spread of slavery to new U.S. territory in the west . He returned to politics to oppose the pro @-@ slavery Kansas – Nebraska Act ( 1854 ) ; this law repealed the slavery @-@ restricting Missouri Compromise ( 1820 ) . Senior Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois had incorporated popular sovereignty into the Act . Douglas ' provision , which Lincoln opposed , specified settlers had the right to determine locally whether to allow slavery in new U.S. territory , rather than have such a decision restricted by the national Congress . 
 Eric Foner ( 2010 ) contrasts the abolitionists and anti @-@ slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin , with the conservative Republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress . Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle , opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the Founding Fathers , especially the equality of all men and democratic self @-@ government as expressed in the Declaration of Independence . 
 On October 16 , 1854 , in his " Peoria Speech " , Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery , which he repeated en route to the presidency . Speaking in his Kentucky accent , with a very powerful voice , he said the Kansas Act had a " declared indifference , but as I must think , a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery . I cannot but hate it . I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself . I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world ... " 
 In late 1854 , Lincoln ran as a Whig for the U.S. Senate . At that time , senators were elected by the state legislature . After leading in the first six rounds of voting , but unable to obtain a majority , Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for Lyman Trumbull . Trumbull was an antislavery Democrat , and had received few votes in the earlier ballots ; his supporters , also antislavery Democrats , had vowed not to support any Whig . Lincoln 's decision to withdraw enabled his Whig supporters and Trumbull 's antislavery Democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream Democratic candidate , Joel Aldrich Matteson . 
 Nationally , the Whigs had been irreparably split by the Kansas – Nebraska Act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue . Lincoln wrote , " I think I am a Whig , but others say there are no Whigs , and that I am an abolitionist [ ... ] I do no more than oppose the extension of slavery . " Drawing on the antislavery portion of the Whig Party , and combining Free Soil , Liberty , and antislavery Democratic Party members , the new Republican Party formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery . Lincoln was one of those instrumental in forging the shape of the new party ; at the 1856 Republican National Convention , he placed second in the contest to become its candidate for vice president . 
 In 1857 – 1858 , Douglas broke with President James Buchanan , leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party . Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas for the Senate in 1858 , since he had led the opposition to the Lecompton Constitution , which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state . In March 1857 , the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford ; Chief Justice Roger B. Taney opined that blacks were not citizens , and derived no rights from the Constitution . Lincoln denounced the decision , alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the Slave Power . Lincoln argued , " The authors of the Declaration of Independence never intended ' to say all were equal in color , size , intellect , moral developments , or social capacity ' , but they ' did consider all men created equal — equal in certain inalienable rights , among which are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness ' . " 
 After the state Republican party convention nominated him for the U.S. Senate in 1858 , Lincoln delivered his House Divided Speech , drawing on Mark 3 : 25 , " A house divided against itself cannot stand . I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free . I do not expect the Union to be dissolved — I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided . It will become all one thing , or all the other . " The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate , and rallied Republicans across the North . The stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the Illinois legislature which would , in turn , select Lincoln or Douglas as its U.S. senator . 
 = = = Lincoln – Douglas debates and Cooper Union speech = = = 
 The Senate campaign featured the seven Lincoln – Douglas debates of 1858 , the most famous political debates in American history . The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically . Lincoln warned that " The Slave Power " was threatening the values of republicanism , and accused Douglas of distorting the values of the Founding Fathers that all men are created equal , while Douglas emphasized his Freeport Doctrine , that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not , and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists . The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands . Lincoln stated Douglas ' popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nation 's morality and that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states . Douglas said that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court and the Dred Scott decision . 
 Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes , the Democrats won more seats , and the legislature re @-@ elected Douglas to the Senate . Despite the bitterness of the defeat for Lincoln , his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation . In May 1859 , Lincoln purchased the Illinois Staats @-@ Anzeiger , a German @-@ language newspaper which was consistently supportive ; most of the state 's 130 @,@ 000 German Americans voted Democratic but there was Republican support that a German @-@ language paper could mobilize . 
 On February 27 , 1860 , New York party leaders invited Lincoln to give a speech at Cooper Union to a group of powerful Republicans . Lincoln argued that the Founding Fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery . Lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the Republicans required opposition to slavery , and rejected any " groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong " . Despite his inelegant appearance — many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly — Lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the Republican presidential nomination . Journalist Noah Brooks reported , " No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience . " 
 Historian Donald described the speech as a " superb political move for an unannounced candidate , to appear in one rival 's ( William H. Seward ) own state at an event sponsored by the second rival 's ( Salmon P. Chase ) loyalists , while not mentioning either by name during its delivery " . In response to an inquiry about his presidential intentions , Lincoln said , " The taste is in my mouth a little . " 
 = = = 1860 Presidential nomination and campaign = = = 
 On May 9 – 10 , 1860 , the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur . Lincoln 's followers organized a campaign team led by David Davis , Norman Judd , Leonard Swett , and Jesse DuBois , and Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency . Exploiting the embellished legend of his frontier days with his father ( clearing the land and splitting fence rails with an ax ) , Lincoln 's supporters adopted the label of " The Rail Candidate " . In 1860 Lincoln described himself : " I am in height , six feet , four inches , nearly ; lean in flesh , weighing , on an average , one hundred and eighty pounds ; dark complexion , with coarse black hair , and gray eyes . " His biographers added that he had a : 
 Large head , with high crown of skull ; thick , bushy hair ; large and deep eye @-@ caverns ; heavy eyebrows ; a large nose ; large ears ; large mouth ; thin upper and somewhat thick under lip ; very high and prominent cheek @-@ bones ; cheeks thin and sunken ; strongly developed jawbone ; chin slightly upturned ; a thin but sinewy neck , rather long ; long arms ; large hands ; chest thin and narrow as compared with his great height ; legs of more than proportionate length , and large feet . 
 On May 18 , at the Republican National Convention in Chicago , Lincoln 's friends promised and manipulated and won the nomination on the third ballot , beating candidates such as William H. Seward and Salmon P. Chase . A former Democrat , Hannibal Hamlin of Maine , was nominated for Vice President to balance the ticket . Lincoln 's success depended on his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue , and his strong support for Whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff . 
 On the third ballot Pennsylvania put him over the top . Pennsylvania iron interests were reassured by his support for protective tariffs . Lincoln 's managers had been adroitly focused on this delegation as well as the others , while following Lincoln 's strong dictate to " Make no contracts that bind me " . 
 Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party , as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government with the Dred Scott decision and the presidency of James Buchanan . Throughout the 1850s , Lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war , and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession . Meanwhile , Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats . Delegates from 11 slave states walked out of the Democratic convention , disagreeing with Douglas ' position on popular sovereignty , and ultimately selected John C. Breckinridge as their candidate . 
 The Wide Awake Parade was formed in 1860 by Republicans in the Northern states to help nominate Abraham Lincoln as the President of the United States . As Lincoln 's ideas of abolishing slavery grew , so did his supporters . People of the Northern states knew the Southern states would vote against Lincoln because of his ideas of anti @-@ slavery and took action to rally supporters for Lincoln . 
 As Douglas and the other candidates went through with their campaigns , Lincoln was the only one of them who gave no speeches . Instead , he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party . The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North , and produced an abundance of campaign posters , leaflets , and newspaper editorials . There were thousands of Republican speakers who focused first on the party platform , and second on Lincoln 's life story , emphasizing his childhood poverty . The goal was to demonstrate the superior power of " free labor " , whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts . The Republican Party 's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition ; a Chicago Tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln 's life , and sold 100 @,@ 000 to 200 @,@ 000 copies .

 On November 6 , 1860 , Lincoln was elected the 16th president of the United States , beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas , John C. Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats , and John Bell of the new Constitutional Union Party . He was the first president from the Republican Party . His victory was entirely due to the strength of his support in the North and West ; no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states , and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states . 
 Lincoln received 1 @,@ 866 @,@ 452 votes , Douglas 1 @,@ 376 @,@ 957 votes , Breckinridge 849 @,@ 781 votes , and Bell 588 @,@ 789 votes . Turnout was 82 @.@ 2 percent , with Lincoln winning the free Northern states , as well as California and Oregon . Douglas won Missouri , and split New Jersey with Lincoln . Bell won Virginia , Tennessee , and Kentucky , and Breckinridge won the rest of the South . 
 Although Lincoln won only a plurality of the popular vote , his victory in the electoral college was decisive : Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123 . There were fusion tickets in which all of Lincoln 's opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York , New Jersey , and Rhode Island , but even if the anti @-@ Lincoln vote had been combined in every state , Lincoln still would have won a majority in the Electoral College . 
 As Lincoln 's election became evident , secessionists made clear their intent to leave the Union before he took office the next March . On December 20 , 1860 , South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession ; by February 1 , 1861 , Florida , Mississippi , Alabama , Georgia , Louisiana , and Texas followed . Six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation , the Confederate States of America . The upper South and border states ( Delaware , Maryland , Virginia , North Carolina , Tennessee , Kentucky , Missouri , and Arkansas ) listened to , but initially rejected , the secessionist appeal . President Buchanan and President @-@ elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy , declaring secession illegal . The Confederacy selected Jefferson Davis as its provisional President on February 9 , 1861 . 
 There were attempts at compromise . The Crittenden Compromise would have extended the Missouri Compromise line of 1820 , dividing the territories into slave and free , contrary to the Republican Party 's free @-@ soil platform . Lincoln rejected the idea , saying , " I will suffer death before I consent ... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right . " 
 Lincoln , however , did tacitly support the proposed Corwin Amendment to the Constitution , which passed Congress before Lincoln came into office and was then awaiting ratification by the states . That proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed and would have guaranteed that Congress would not interfere with slavery without Southern consent . A few weeks before the war , Lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution . Lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the Constitution . 
 En route to his inauguration by train , Lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the North . The president @-@ elect then evaded possible assassins in Baltimore , who were uncovered by Lincoln 's head of security , Allan Pinkerton . On February 23 , 1861 , he arrived in disguise in Washington , D.C. , which was placed under substantial military guard . Lincoln directed his inaugural address to the South , proclaiming once again that he had no intention , or inclination , to abolish slavery in the Southern states : 
 <unk> seems to exist among the people of the Southern States that by the accession of a Republican Administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered . There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension . Indeed , the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection . It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you . I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that " I have no purpose , directly or indirectly , to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists . I believe I have no lawful right to do so , and I have no inclination to do so . " 
 The President ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South : " We are not enemies , but friends . We must not be enemies ... The mystic chords of memory , stretching from every battlefield , and patriot grave , to every living heart and <unk> , all over this broad land , will yet swell the chorus of the Union , when again touched , as surely they will be , by the better angels of our nature . " The failure of the Peace Conference of 1861 signaled that legislative compromise was impossible . By March 1861 , no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms . Meanwhile , Lincoln and the Republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated . Lincoln said as the war was ending : 
 Both parties deprecated war , but one of them would make war rather than let the Nation survive , and the other would accept war rather than let it perish , and the war came .

 The commander of Fort Sumter , South Carolina , Major Robert Anderson , sent a request for provisions to Washington , and the execution of Lincoln 's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war . On April 12 , 1861 , Confederate forces fired on Union troops at Fort Sumter , forcing them to surrender , and began the war . Historian Allan Nevins argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations : underestimating the gravity of the crisis , exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South , and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting there be no invasion . 
 William Tecumseh Sherman talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was " sadly disappointed " at his failure to realize that " the country was sleeping on a volcano " and that the South was preparing for war . Historian Donald concludes that , " His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft . Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood . But he also vowed not to surrender the forts . The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot ; they did just that . " 
 On April 15 , Lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 75 @,@ 000 troops to recapture forts , protect Washington , and " preserve the Union " , which , in his view , still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states . This call forced the states to choose sides . Virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the Confederate capital , despite the exposed position of Richmond so close to Union lines . North Carolina , Tennessee , and Arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months . Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland , but did not prevail ; Kentucky tried to be neutral . The Confederate attack on Fort Sumter rallied Americans north of the Mason @-@ Dixon line to the defense of the American nation . Historian Allan Nevins says : 
 The thunderclap of Sumter produced a startling crystallization of Northern sentiment ... Anger swept the land . From every side came news of mass meetings , speeches , resolutions , tenders of business support , the muster of companies and regiments , the determined action of governors and legislatures . " 
 States sent Union regiments south in response to Lincoln 's call to save the capital and confront the rebellion . On April 19 , mobs in Baltimore , which controlled the rail links , attacked Union troops who were changing trains , and local leaders ' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital . The Army responded by arresting local Maryland officials . Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus in areas the army felt it needed to secure for troops to reach Washington . John Merryman , a Maryland official involved in hindering the U.S. troop movements , petitioned Supreme Court Chief Justice and Marylander , Roger B. Taney , author of the controversial pro @-@ slavery Dred Scott opinion , to issue a writ of habeas corpus , and in June Taney , acting as a circuit judge and not speaking for the Supreme Court , issued the writ , because in his opinion only Congress could suspend the writ . Lincoln continued the army policy that the writ was suspended in limited areas despite the Ex parte Merryman ruling . 
 = = = Assuming command for the Union in the war = = = 
 After the Battle of Fort Sumter , Lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and making an overall strategy to put down the rebellion . Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis , and he responded as commander @-@ in @-@ chief , using unprecedented powers . He expanded his war powers , and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports , disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress , and after suspending habeas corpus , arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers . Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions . In addition , Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict . 
 The war effort was the source of continued disparagement of Lincoln , and dominated his time and attention . From the start , it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort , and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle , such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army . Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue . Conversely , the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery . On August 6 , 1861 , Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort . In practice , the law had little effect , but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy . 
 In late August 1861 , General John C. Frémont , the 1856 Republican presidential nominee , issued , without consulting his superiors in Washington , a proclamation of martial law in Missouri . He declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be court @-@ martialed and shot , and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed . Frémont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the Department of the West compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption . Lincoln overruled Frémont 's proclamation . Lincoln believed that Fremont 's emancipation was political ; neither militarily necessary nor legal . After Lincoln acted , Union enlistments from Maryland , Kentucky , and Missouri increased by over 40 @,@ 000 troops . 
 Lincoln left most diplomatic matters to his Secretary of State , William Seward . At times Seward was too bellicose , so for balance Lincoln stuck a close working relationship with Senator Charles Sumner , the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . The Trent Affair of late 1861 threatened war with Great Britain . The U.S. Navy had illegally intercepted a British mail ship , the Trent , on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys ; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered . Lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats . Biographer James G. Randall has dissected Lincoln 's successful techniques : 
 his restraint , his avoidance of any outward expression of truculence , his early softening of State Department 's attitude toward Britain , his deference toward Seward and Sumner , his withholding of his own paper prepared for the occasion , his readiness to arbitrate , his golden silence in addressing Congress , his shrewdness in recognizing that war must be averted , and his clear perception that a point could be clinched for America 's true position at the same time that full satisfaction was given to a friendly country . 
 Lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraphic reports coming into the War Department headquarters . He kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort , consulted with governors , and selected generals based on their past success ( as well as their state and party ) . In January 1862 , after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department , Lincoln replaced Simon Cameron with Edwin Stanton as War Secretary . Stanton was a staunchly Unionist pro @-@ business conservative Democrat who moved toward the Radical Republican faction . Nevertheless , he worked more often and more closely with Lincoln than any other senior official . " Stanton and Lincoln virtually conducted the war together , " say Thomas and Hyman . 
 In terms of war strategy , Lincoln articulated two priorities : to ensure that Washington was well @-@ defended , and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt , decisive victory ; major Northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days . Twice a week , Lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon , and occasionally Mary Lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard . Lincoln learned from reading the theoretical book of his chief of staff General Henry Halleck , a disciple of the European strategist Jomini ; he began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points , such as the Mississippi River ; . Lincoln saw the importance of Vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy 's army , rather than simply capturing territory . 
 = = = General McClellan = = = 
 After the Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run and the retirement of the aged Winfield Scott in late 1861 , Lincoln appointed Major General George B. McClellan general @-@ in @-@ chief of all the Union armies . McClellan , a young West Point graduate , railroad executive , and Pennsylvania Democrat , took several months to plan and attempt his Peninsula Campaign , longer than Lincoln wanted . The campaign 's objective was to capture Richmond by moving the Army of the Potomac by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the Confederate capital . McClellan 's repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress , as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington . Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan 's troops in defense of the capital ; McClellan , who consistently overestimated the strength of Confederate troops , blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign . 
 Lincoln removed McClellan as general @-@ in @-@ chief in March 1862 , after McClellan 's " Harrison 's Landing Letter " , in which he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort . The office remained empty until July , when Henry Halleck was selected for it . McClellan 's letter incensed Radical Republicans , who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint John Pope , a Republican , as head of the new Army of Virginia . Pope complied with Lincoln 's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north , thus protecting the capital from attack . 
 However , lacking requested reinforcements from McClellan , now commanding the Army of the Potomac , Pope was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the summer of 1862 , forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time . The war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the CSS Virginia , formerly the USS Merrimack , damaged or destroyed three Union vessels in Norfolk , Virginia , before being engaged and damaged by the USS Monitor . Lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the Battle of Hampton Roads . 
 Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan 's failure to reinforce Pope , Lincoln was desperate , and restored him to command of all forces around Washington , to the dismay of all in his cabinet but Seward . Two days after McClellan 's return to command , General Robert E. Lee 's forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland , leading to the Battle of Antietam in September 1862 . The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history , but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January . Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier , Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation . 
 McClellan then resisted the President 's demand that he pursue Lee 's retreating and exposed army , while his counterpart General Don Carlos Buell likewise refused orders to move the Army of the Ohio against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee . As a result , Lincoln replaced Buell with William Rosecrans ; and , after the 1862 midterm elections , he replaced McClellan with Republican Ambrose Burnside . Both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief . 
 Burnside , against the advice of the president , prematurely launched an offensive across the Rappahannock River and was stunningly defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg in December . Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield , but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined . Desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg . Lincoln brought in Joseph Hooker , despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship . 
 The mid @-@ term elections in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war , as well as rising inflation , new high taxes , rumors of corruption , the suspension of habeas corpus , the military draft law , and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market . The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for the Republicans in the rural areas of New England and the upper Midwest , but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest . 
 While Republicans were discouraged , Democrats were energized and did especially well in Pennsylvania , Ohio , Indiana , and New York . The Republicans did maintain their majorities in Congress and in the major states , except New York . The Cincinnati Gazette contended that the voters were " depressed by the interminable nature of this war , as so far conducted , and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress " . 
 In the spring of 1863 , Lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together ; these plans included Hooker 's attack on Lee north of Richmond , Rosecrans ' on Chattanooga , Grant 's on Vicksburg , and a naval assault on Charleston . 
 Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May , but continued to command his troops for some weeks . He ignored Lincoln 's order to divide his troops , and possibly force Lee to do the same in Harper 's Ferry , and tendered his resignation , which Lincoln accepted . He was replaced by George Meade , who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the Gettysburg Campaign , which was a victory for the Union , though Lee 's army avoided capture . At the same time , after initial setbacks , Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor . After the Battle of Gettysburg , Lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his War Secretary or his general @-@ in @-@ chief on to his generals , who resented his civilian interference with their own plans . Even so , he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief . 
 = = = Emancipation Proclamation = = = 
 Lincoln understood that the Federal government 's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution , which before 1865 , committed the issue to individual states . He argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new U.S. territory . At the beginning of the war , he also sought to persuade the states to accept compensated emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery . Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it , as envisioned by the Founding Fathers , under the constitution . President Lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by Major General John C. Frémont in August 1861 and by Major General David Hunter in May 1862 , on the grounds that it was not within their power , and it would upset the border states loyal to the Union . 
 On June 19 , 1862 , endorsed by Lincoln , Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory . In July , the Confiscation Act of 1862 was passed , which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion . Although Lincoln believed it was not within Congress 's power to free the slaves within the states , he approved the bill in deference to the legislature . He felt such action could only be taken by the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief using war powers granted to the president by the Constitution , and Lincoln was planning to take that action . In that month , Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet . In it , he stated that " as a fit and necessary military measure , on January 1 , 1863 , all persons held as slaves in the Confederate states will thenceforward , and forever , be free " . 
 Privately , Lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the Confederacy had to be eliminated . However Copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification . Republican editor Horace Greeley of the highly influential New York Tribune fell for the ploy , and Lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of August 22 , 1862 . Although he said he personally wished all men could be free , Lincoln stated that the primary goal of his actions as the U.S. president ( he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his " official duty " ) was that of preserving the Union : 
 My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union , and is not either to save or to destroy slavery . If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it , and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it ; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that . What I do about slavery , and the colored race , I do because I believe it helps to save the Union ; and what I forbear , I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union ... [ ¶ ] I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty ; and I intend no modification of my oft @-@ expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free . 
 The Emancipation Proclamation , issued on September 22 , 1862 , and put into effect on January 1 , 1863 , declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control , with exemptions specified for areas already under Union control in two states . Lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation , while Democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 off @-@ year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites . 
 Once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective , as Union armies advanced south , more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed . Lincoln 's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was : " I never , in my life , felt more certain that I was doing right , than I do in signing this paper . " For some time , Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves . He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation , but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed . A few days after Emancipation was announced , 13 Republican governors met at the War Governors ' Conference ; they supported the president 's Proclamation , but suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union Army . 
 Enlisting former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation . By the spring of 1863 , Lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers . In a letter to Andrew Johnson , the military governor of Tennessee , encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops , Lincoln wrote , " The bare sight of 50 @,@ 000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once " . By the end of 1863 , at Lincoln 's direction , General Lorenzo Thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley . Frederick Douglass once observed of Lincoln : " In his company , I was never reminded of my humble origin , or of my unpopular color " . 
 = = = Gettysburg Address ( 1863 ) = = = 
 With the great Union victory at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863 , and the defeat of the Copperheads in the Ohio election in the fall , Lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort , despite the New York City draft riots . The stage was set for his address at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19 , 1863 . Defying Lincoln 's prediction that " the world will little note , nor long remember what we say here " , the Address became the most quoted speech in American history . 
 In 272 words , and three minutes , Lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789 , but in 1776 , " conceived in Liberty , and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal " . He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all . The emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort . He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain , that slavery would end as a result of the losses , and the future of democracy in the world would be assured , that " government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the earth " . Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective : a new birth of freedom in the nation . 
 = = = General Grant = = = 
 Meade 's failure to capture Lee 's army as it retreated from Gettysburg , and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac , persuaded Lincoln that a change in command was needed . General Ulysses S. Grant 's victories at the Battle of Shiloh and in the Vicksburg campaign impressed Lincoln and made Grant a strong candidate to head the Union Army . Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh , Lincoln had said , " I can 't spare this man . He fights . " With Grant in command , Lincoln felt the Union Army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters , and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops . 
 Nevertheless , Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a candidacy for President in 1864 , as McClellan was . Lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into Grant 's political intentions , and being assured that he had none , submitted to the Senate Grant 's promotion to commander of the Union Army . He obtained Congress 's consent to reinstate for Grant the rank of Lieutenant General , which no officer had held since George Washington . 
 Grant waged his bloody Overland Campaign in 1864 . This is often characterized as a war of attrition , given high Union losses at battles such as the Battle of the Wilderness and Cold Harbor . Even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive , the Confederate forces had " almost as high a percentage of casualties as the Union forces " . The high casualty figures of the Union alarmed the North ; Grant had lost a third of his army , and Lincoln asked what Grant 's plans were , to which the general replied , " I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer . " 
 The Confederacy lacked reinforcements , so Lee 's army shrank with every costly battle . Grant 's army moved south , crossed the James River , forcing a siege and trench warfare outside Petersburg , Virginia . Lincoln then made an extended visit to Grant 's headquarters at City Point , Virginia . This allowed the president to confer in person with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman about the hostilities , as Sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to Grant from his position in North Carolina . Lincoln and the Republican Party mobilized support for the draft throughout the North , and replaced the Union losses . 
 Lincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructure — such as plantations , railroads , and bridges — hoping to destroy the South 's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting . Grant 's move to Petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between Richmond and the South . This strategy allowed Generals Sherman and Philip Sheridan to destroy plantations and towns in Virginia 's Shenandoah Valley . The damage caused by Sherman 's March to the Sea through Georgia in 1864 was limited to a 60 @-@ mile ( 97 km ) swath , but neither Lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal , but rather defeat of the Confederate armies . Mark E. Neely Jr. has argued that there was no effort to engage in " total war " against civilians which he believed did take place during World War II . 
 Confederate general Jubal Anderson Early began a series of assaults in the North that threatened the Capital . During Early 's raid on Washington , D.C. in 1864 , Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position ; Captain Oliver Wendell Holmes shouted at him , " Get down , you damn fool , before you get shot ! " After repeated calls on Grant to defend Washington , Sheridan was appointed and the threat from Early was dispatched . 
 As Grant continued to wear down Lee 's forces , efforts to discuss peace began . Confederate Vice President Stephens led a group to meet with Lincoln , Seward , and others at Hampton Roads . Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal ; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results . On April 1 , 1865 , Grant successfully outflanked Lee 's forces in the Battle of Five Forks and nearly encircled Petersburg , and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond . Days later , when that city fell , Lincoln visited the vanquished Confederate capital ; as he walked through the city , white Southerners were stone @-@ faced , but freedmen greeted him as a hero . On April 9 , Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox and the war was effectively over . 
 = = = 1864 re @-@ election = = = 
 While the war was still being waged , Lincoln faced reelection in 1864 . Lincoln was a master politician , bringing together — and holding together — all the main factions of the Republican Party , and bringing in War Democrats such as Edwin M. Stanton and Andrew Johnson as well . Lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers — greatly expanded over peacetime — to hold the factions of his party together , build support for his own policies , and fend off efforts by Radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket . At its 1864 convention , the Republican Party selected Johnson , a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee , as his running mate . To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans , Lincoln ran under the label of the new Union Party . 
 When Grant 's 1864 spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and Union casualties mounted , the lack of military success wore heavily on the President 's re @-@ election prospects , and many Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated . Sharing this fear , Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that , if he should lose the election , he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House : 
 This morning , as for some days past , it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be re @-@ elected . Then it will be my duty to so co @-@ operate with the President elect , as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration ; as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward . 
 Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet , but asked them to sign the sealed envelope . 
 While the Democratic platform followed the " Peace wing " of the party and called the war a " failure " , their candidate , General George B. McClellan , supported the war and repudiated the platform . Lincoln provided Grant with more troops and mobilized his party to renew its support of Grant in the war effort . Sherman 's capture of Atlanta in September and David Farragut 's capture of Mobile ended defeatist jitters ; the Democratic Party was deeply split , with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln . By contrast , the National Union Party was united and energized as Lincoln made emancipation the central issue , and state Republican parties stressed the perfidy of the Copperheads . On November 8 , Lincoln was re @-@ elected in a landslide , carrying all but three states , and receiving 78 percent of the Union soldiers ' vote . 
 On March 4 , 1865 , Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address . In it , he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be God 's will . Historian Mark Noll concludes it ranks " among the small handful of semi @-@ sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world " . Lincoln said : 
 Fondly do we hope — fervently do we pray — that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away . Yet , if God wills that it continue , until all the wealth piled by the bond @-@ man 's 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk , and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash , shall be paid by another drawn with the sword , as was said 3 @,@ 000 years ago , so still it must be said , " the judgments of the Lord , are true and righteous altogether " . With malice toward none ; with charity for all ; with firmness in the right , as God gives us to see the right , let us strive on to finish the work we are in ; to bind up the nation 's wounds ; to care for him who shall have borne the battle , and for his widow , and his orphan — to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace , among ourselves , and with all nations . 
 = = = Reconstruction = = = 
 Reconstruction began during the war , as Lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states , and how to determine the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves . Shortly after Lee 's surrender , a general had asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated , and Lincoln replied , " Let ' em up easy . " In keeping with that sentiment , Lincoln led the moderates regarding Reconstruction policy , and was opposed by the Radical Republicans , under Rep. Thaddeus Stevens , Sen. Charles Sumner and Sen. Benjamin Wade , political allies of the president on other issues . Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South , Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war . His Amnesty Proclamation of December 8 , 1863 , offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office , had not mistreated Union prisoners , and would sign an oath of allegiance . 
 As Southern states were subdued , critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re @-@ formed . Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas , where Lincoln appointed Generals Andrew Johnson and Frederick Steele as military governors , respectively . In Louisiana , Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P. Banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it . Lincoln 's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans ' political aspirations . On the other hand , the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient , and passed their own plan , the Wade @-@ Davis Bill , in 1864 . When Lincoln vetoed the bill , the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana , Arkansas , and Tennessee . 
 Lincoln 's appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and Radical factions in harness . To fill Chief Justice Taney 's seat on the Supreme Court , he named the choice of the Radicals , Salmon P. Chase , who Lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies . 
 After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation , which did not apply to every state , Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment . Lincoln declared that such an amendment would " clinch the whole matter " . By December 1863 , a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery was brought to Congress for passage . This first attempt at an amendment failed to pass , falling short of the required two @-@ thirds majority on June 15 , 1864 , in the House of Representatives . Passage of the proposed amendment became part of the Republican / Unionist platform in the election of 1864 . After a long debate in the House , a second attempt passed Congress on January 31 , 1865 , and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification . Upon ratification , it became the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution on December 6 , 1865 . 
 As the war drew to a close , Lincoln 's presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux ; having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen . He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner 's Freedmen 's Bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves . The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen . Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction . Shortly before his assassination , Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction . Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short @-@ term military control over southern states , until readmission under the control of southern Unionists . 
 Historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly what Lincoln would have done about Reconstruction if he had lived , but they make projections based on his known policy positions and political acumen . Lincoln biographers James G. Randall and Richard Current , according to David <unk> , argue that : 
 It is likely that had he lived , Lincoln would have followed a policy similar to Johnson 's , that he would have clashed with congressional Radicals , that he would have produced a better result for the freedmen than occurred , and that his political skills would have helped him avoid Johnson 's mistakes . 
 Eric Foner argues that : 
 Unlike Sumner and other Radicals , Lincoln did not see Reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation . He had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land . He believed , as most Republicans did in April 1865 , that the voting requirements should be determined by the states . He assumed that political control in the South would pass to white Unionists , reluctant secessionists , and forward @-@ looking former Confederates . But time and again during the war , Lincoln , after initial opposition , had come to embrace positions first advanced by abolitionists and Radical Republicans . ... Lincoln undoubtedly would have listened carefully to the outcry for further protection for the former slaves ... It is entirely plausible to imagine Lincoln and Congress agreeing on a Reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage , along the lines Lincoln proposed just before his death . " 
 = = = Redefining the republic and republicanism = = = 
 The successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country . The term " the United States " has historically been used , sometimes in the plural ( " these United States " ) , and other times in the singular , without any particular grammatical consistency . The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century . 
 In recent years , historians such as Harry Jaffa , Herman Belz , John Diggins , Vernon Burton and Eric Foner have stressed Lincoln 's redefinition of republican values . As early as the 1850s , a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution , Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values — what he called the " sheet anchor " of republicanism . The Declaration 's emphasis on freedom and equality for all , in contrast to the Constitution 's tolerance of slavery , shifted the debate . As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860 , " Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself . " His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism , rather than its legalisms . Nevertheless , in 1861 , Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms ( the Constitution was a contract , and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree ) , and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state . Burton ( 2008 ) argues that Lincoln 's republicanism was taken up by the Freedmen as they were emancipated . 
 In March 1861 , in Lincoln 's first inaugural address , he explored the nature of democracy . He denounced secession as anarchy , and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the American system . He said " A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations , and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments , is the only true sovereign of a free people . "

 Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of the presidency , which gave Congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them . Lincoln vetoed only four bills passed by Congress ; the only important one was the Wade @-@ Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction . He signed the Homestead Act in 1862 , making millions of acres of government @-@ held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost . The Morrill Land @-@ Grant Colleges Act , also signed in 1862 , provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state . The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States ' First Transcontinental Railroad , which was completed in 1869 . The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s . 
 Other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the Federal government : tariffs ( a policy with long precedent ) , and a new Federal income tax . In 1861 , Lincoln signed the second and third Morrill Tariff , the first having become law under James Buchanan . Also in 1861 , Lincoln signed the Revenue Act of 1861 , creating the first U.S. income tax . This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $ 800 ( $ 21 @,@ 100 in current dollar terms ) , which was later changed by the Revenue Act of 1862 to a progressive rate structure . 
 Lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal government 's economic influence in several other areas . The creation of the system of national banks by the National Banking Act provided a strong financial network in the country . It also established a national currency . In 1862 , Congress created , with Lincoln 's approval , the Department of Agriculture . In 1862 , Lincoln sent a senior general , John Pope , to put down the " Sioux Uprising " in Minnesota . Presented with 303 execution warrants for convicted Santee Dakota who were accused of killing innocent farmers , Lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants , eventually approving 39 for execution ( one was later reprieved ) . President Lincoln had planned to reform federal Indian policy . 
 In the wake of Grant 's casualties in his campaign against Lee , Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft , but it was never issued . In response to rumors of one , however , the editors of the New York World and the Journal of Commerce published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market . Lincoln 's reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior ; he ordered the military to seize the two papers . The seizure lasted for two days . 
 Lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States . Before Lincoln 's presidency , Thanksgiving , while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century , had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates . The last such proclamation had been during James Madison 's presidency 50 years before . In 1863 , Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving . In June 1864 , Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress , which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as Yosemite National Park .

 Lincoln 's declared philosophy on court nominations was that " we cannot ask a man what he will do , and if we should , and he should answer us , we should despise him for it . Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known . " Lincoln made five appointments to the United States Supreme Court . Noah Haynes Swayne , nominated January 21 , 1862 and appointed January 24 , 1862 , was chosen as an anti @-@ slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union . Samuel Freeman Miller , nominated and appointed on July 16 , 1862 , supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist . David Davis , Lincoln 's campaign manager in 1860 , nominated December 1 , 1862 and appointed December 8 , 1862 , had also served as a judge in Lincoln 's Illinois court circuit . Stephen Johnson Field , a previous California Supreme Court justice , was nominated March 6 , 1863 and appointed March 10 , 1863 , and provided geographic balance , as well as political balance to the court as a Democrat . Finally , Lincoln 's Treasury Secretary , Salmon P. Chase , was nominated as Chief Justice , and appointed the same day , on December 6 , 1864 . Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist , would support Reconstruction legislation , and that his appointment united the Republican Party .

 = = Assassination and funeral = = 
 Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth on Good Friday , April 14 , 1865 , while attending a play at Ford 's Theatre as the American Civil War was drawing to a close . The assassination occurred five days after the surrender of Robert E. Lee and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia . Booth was a well @-@ known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland ; though he never joined the Confederate army , he had contacts with the Confederate secret service . In 1864 , Booth formulated a plan ( very similar to one of Thomas N. Conrad previously authorized by the Confederacy ) to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners . After attending an April 11 , 1865 , speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks , an incensed Booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president . Learning that the President and Grant would be attending Ford 's Theatre , Booth formulated a plan with co @-@ conspirators to assassinate Lincoln and Grant at the theater , as well as Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward at their homes . Without his main bodyguard , Ward Hill Lamon , Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14 . At the last minute , Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play . 
 Lincoln 's bodyguard , John Parker , left Ford 's Theater during intermission to drink at the saloon next door . The now unguarded President sat in his state box in the balcony . Seizing the opportunity , Booth crept up from behind and at about 10 : 13 pm , aimed at the back of Lincoln 's head and fired at point @-@ blank range , mortally wounding the President . Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth , but Booth stabbed him and escaped . 
 After being on the run for 12 days , Booth was tracked down and found on a farm in Virginia , some 70 miles ( 110 km ) south of Washington . After refusing to surrender to Union troops , Booth was killed by Sergeant Boston Corbett on April 26 . 
 Doctor Charles <unk> , an Army surgeon , found the President unresponsive , barely breathing and with no detectable pulse . Having determined that the President had been shot in the head , and not stabbed in the shoulder as originally thought , he made an attempt to clear the blood clot , after which the President began to breathe more naturally . The dying President was taken across the street to Petersen House . After remaining in a coma for nine hours , Lincoln died at 7 : 22 am on April 15 . Secretary of War Stanton saluted and said , " Now he belongs to the ages . " 
 Lincoln 's flag @-@ enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers , while the city 's church bells rang . President Johnson was sworn in at 10 : 00 am , less than 3 hours after Lincoln 's death . The late President lay in state in the East Room , and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21 . For his final journey with his son Willie , both caskets were transported in the executive coach " United States " and for three weeks the Lincoln Special funeral train decorated in black bunting bore Lincoln 's remains on a slow circuitous waypoint journey from Washington D.C. to Springfield , Illinois , stopping at many cities across the North for large @-@ scale memorials attended by hundreds of thousands , as well as many people who gathered in informal trackside tributes with bands , bonfires , and hymn singing or silent reverence with hat in hand as the railway procession slowly passed by . Poet Walt Whitman composed When Lilacs Last in the <unk> Bloom 'd to eulogize Lincoln , one of four poems he wrote about the assassinated president . Historians have emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow , but also noted that some Lincoln haters cheered when they heard the news . African @-@ Americans were especially moved ; they had lost ' their Moses ' . In a larger sense , the outpouring of grief and anguish was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war that had just ended . 
 = = Religious and philosophical beliefs = = 
 As a young man , Lincoln was a religious skeptic , or , in the words of a biographer , an iconoclast . Later in life , Lincoln 's frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences , who were mostly evangelical Protestants . He never joined a church , although he frequently attended with his wife . However , he was deeply familiar with the Bible , and he both quoted and praised it . He was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others . Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs . However he did believe in an all @-@ powerful God that shaped events and , by 1865 , was expressing those beliefs in major speeches . 
 In the 1840s , Lincoln subscribed to the Doctrine of Necessity , a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power . In the 1850s , Lincoln believed in " providence " in a general way , and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals ; he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence . When he suffered the death of his son Edward , Lincoln more frequently expressed a need to depend on God . The death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look toward religion for answers and solace . After Willie 's death , Lincoln considered why , from a divine standpoint , the severity of the war was necessary . He wrote at this time that God " could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest . Yet the contest began . And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day . Yet the contest proceeds . " On the day Lincoln was assassinated , he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the Holy Land . 
 = = Health = = 
 Several claims abound that Lincoln 's health was declining before the assassination . These are often based on photographs appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting . One such claim is that he suffered from a rare genetic disorder , <unk> , which manifests with a medullary thyroid carcinoma , mucosal <unk> and a Marfanoid appearance . Others simply claim he had Marfan syndrome , based on his tall appearance with spindly fingers , and the association of possible aortic regurgitation , which can cause bobbing of the head ( <unk> 's sign ) — based on blurring of Lincoln 's head in photographs , which back then had a long exposure time . As of 2009 , DNA analysis was being refused by the Grand Army of the Republic museum in Philadelphia . 
 = = Historical reputation = = 
 In surveys of U.S. scholars ranking presidents conducted since the 1940s , Lincoln is consistently ranked in the top three , often as number one . A 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked Lincoln number one , while legal scholars placed him second after Washington . In presidential ranking polls conducted in the United States since 1948 , Lincoln has been rated at the very top in the majority of polls : Schlesinger 1948 , Schlesinger 1962 , 1982 Murray Blessing Survey , Chicago Tribune 1982 poll , Schlesinger 1996 , CSPAN 1996 , Ridings @-@ McIver 1996 , Time 2008 , and CSPAN 2009 . Generally , the top three presidents are rated as 1 . Lincoln ; 2 . George Washington ; and 3 . Franklin D. Roosevelt , although Lincoln and Washington , and Washington and Roosevelt , are occasionally reversed . 
 President Lincoln 's assassination increased his status to the point of making him a national martyr . Lincoln was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty . Republicans linked Lincoln 's name to their party . Many , though not all , in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability . 
 Schwartz argues that Lincoln 's reputation grew slowly in the late 19th century until the Progressive Era ( 1900 – 1920s ) when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in American history , with even white Southerners in agreement . The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall in Washington , D.C. In the New Deal era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self @-@ made man or the great war president , but as the advocate of the common man who they believe would have supported the welfare state . In the Cold War years , Lincoln 's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes . 
 By the 1970s Lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives for his intense nationalism , support for business , his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage , his acting in terms of Lockean and Burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition , and his devotion to the principles of the Founding Fathers . As a Whig activist , Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests , favoring high tariffs , banks , internal improvements , and railroads in opposition to the agrarian Democrats . William C. Harris found that Lincoln 's " reverence for the Founding Fathers , the Constitution , the laws under it , and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism " . James G. Randall emphasizes his tolerance and especially his moderation " in his preference for orderly progress , his distrust of dangerous agitation , and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform " . Randall concludes that , " he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so @-@ called ' radicalism ' which involved abuse of the South , hatred for the slaveholder , thirst for vengeance , partisan plotting , and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders . " 
 By the late 1960s , liberals , such as historian <unk> Bennett , were having second thoughts , especially regarding Lincoln 's views on racial issues . Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a white supremacist in 1968 . He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs , told jokes that ridiculed blacks , insisted he opposed social equality , and proposed sending freed slaves to another country . Defenders , such as authors Dirck and Cashin , retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day ; and that he was a " moral visionary " who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause , as fast as politically possible . The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln @-@ the @-@ <unk> to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery , or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation . Historian Barry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincoln 's image suffered " erosion , fading prestige , benign ridicule " in the late 20th century . On the other hand , Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability , defined by the poet John Keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were " content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts , and not compelled toward fact or reason " . 
 Today 's U.S. President , however , seems to be promoting a sympathetic resurgence for his predecessor , Lincoln . Indeed , President Obama , has insisted on using Lincoln 's Bible for his swearing in of office at both his inaugurations . 
 Lincoln has often been portrayed by Hollywood , almost always in a flattering light . 
 = = Memory and memorials = = 
 Lincoln 's portrait appears on two denominations of United States currency , the penny and the $ 5 bill . His likeness also appears on many postage stamps and he has been memorialized in many town , city , and county names , including the capital of Nebraska . 
 The most famous and most visited memorials are Lincoln 's sculpture on Mount Rushmore ; Lincoln Memorial , Ford 's Theatre , and Petersen House ( where he died ) in Washington , D.C. ; and the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield , Illinois , not far from Lincoln 's home , as well as his tomb . 
 There was also the Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln exhibit in Disneyland , and the Hall of Presidents at Walt Disney World , which had to do with Walt Disney admiring Lincoln ever since he was a little boy . 
 Barry Schwartz , a sociologist who has examined America 's cultural memory , argues that in the 1930s and 1940s , the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with " a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life " . During the Great Depression , he argues , Lincoln served " as a means for seeing the world 's disappointments , for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful " . Franklin D. Roosevelt , preparing America for war , used the words of the Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan . Americans asked , " What would Lincoln do ? " However , Schwartz also finds that since World War II , Lincoln 's symbolic power has lost relevance , and this " fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness " . He suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept .
