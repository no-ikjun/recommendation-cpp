 On 18 November 2006 , during the APEC summit in Hanoi , South Korean President Roh Moo @-@ hyun informally proposed to the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe that the sea be called instead the " Sea of Peace " or " Sea of Friendship " , which Abe rejected . In January 2007 Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuhisa Shiozaki opposed the idea , saying that there was no need to change the name of the Sea of Japan .

 A number of maps , encyclopedias , and other publications have switched to using both names . For example , the Manual of Style of the National Geographic Society states that disputed place @-@ names in international waters or jointly controlled by two or more countries should use the conventional name first with other names following in parentheses . As such , their policy on this sea states that " The internationally accepted name is Sea of Japan , although Korea prefers East Sea . When scale permits , Geographic maps show the alternative name East Sea in parentheses after Sea of Japan . " 
 In 2006 , Google put both names on Google Earth , using East Sea near the Korean coast and Sea of Japan near the Japanese coast . In the 2007 edition of Encyclopædia Britannica , the primary article is called " Sea of Japan " . A secondary article called " East Sea " notes " see Japan , Sea of " . On the encyclopedia 's map of Japan and other Asia maps , Sea of Japan appears as the primary label and East Sea appears as a secondary label in parentheses . However , on the map of Korea the name East Sea appears as the primary label and Sea of Japan appears as a secondary label in parentheses . Other examples of publishers who use similar systems include Microsoft <unk> , the Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia , and About.com. 
 In 2012 , French encyclopedia publisher Larousse replaced " Mer du Japon " ( " Sea of Japan " ) with " Mer de L 'est ( Mer du Japon ) " ( " East Sea ( Sea of Japan ) " ) in maps of South Korea and North Korea in two of its books . However other maps such as those of Asia , China , Japan , and Russia continue to use " Mer du Japon " . Furthermore , the article " Mer du Japon " does not mention " East Sea " at all . 
 = A Short History of Progress = 
 A Short History of Progress is a non @-@ fiction book and lecture series by Ronald Wright about societal collapse . The lectures were delivered as a series of five speeches , each taking place in different cities across Canada as part of the 2004 Massey Lectures which were broadcast on the CBC Radio program , Ideas . The book version was published by House of Anansi Press and released at the same time as the lectures . The book spent more than a year on Canadian best @-@ seller lists , won the Canadian Book Association 's Libris Award for Non @-@ Fiction Book of the Year , and was nominated for the British Columbia 's National Award for Canadian Non @-@ Fiction . It has since been reprinted in a hardcover format with illustrations . 
 Wright , an author of fiction and non @-@ fiction works , uses the fallen civilisations of Easter Island , Sumer , Rome , and Maya , as well as examples from the Stone Age , to see what conditions led to the downfall of those societies . He examines the meaning of progress and its implications for civilizations — past and present — arguing that the twentieth century was a time of runaway growth in human population , consumption , and technology that has now placed an unsustainable burden on all natural systems . 
 In his analysis of the four cases of fallen civilizations , he notes that two ( Easter Island and Sumer ) failed due to depletion of natural resources — " their ecologies were unable to regenerate . " The other two failed in their heartlands , " where ecological demand was highest , " but left remnant populations that survived . He asks the question : " Why , if civilizations so often destroy themselves , has the overall experiment of civilization done so well . " For the answer , he says , we must look to natural regeneration and human migration ( Wright , 102 ) . While some ancient civilizations were depleting their ecologies and failing , others were rising . Large expanses of the planet were unsettled . The other factor , evident in both Egypt and China , was that due to abundant resources ( e.g. , topsoil ) , farming methods ( ones that worked with , rather than against , natural cycles ) , and settlement patterns , these civilizations had greater longevity ( 103 @-@ 104 ) . 
 Changes brought on by the exponential growth of human population ( at the time of the book 's publication , over 6 billion and adding more than 200 million people every three years ) and the worldwide scale of resource consumption , have altered the picture , however . Ecological markers indicate that human civilization has now surpassed ( since the 1980s ) nature 's capacity for regeneration . We are now using more than 125 % of nature 's yearly output . " If civilization is to survive , it must live on the interest , not the capital of nature " ( 129 ) . He concludes that " now is our chance to get the future right " — the collapse of human civilization is imminent if we do not act now to prevent it ( 132 ) .

 Prior to being selected to deliver the Massey Lectures , Wright had written award @-@ winning fiction and non @-@ fiction books that deal with anthropology and civilizations . His 1992 non @-@ fiction book Stolen Continents : The " New World " Through Indian Eyes was awarded the 1993 Gordon <unk> Award from the Writers ' Trust of Canada and his 1998 novel A Scientific Romance , about a museum curator who travels into the future and investigates the fate of the human race , won the David Higham Prize for Fiction for first @-@ time novelists . Wright traces the origins of the ideas behind A Short History of Progress to the material he studied while writing A Scientific Romance and his 2000 essay for The Globe and Mail titled " Civilization is a Pyramid Scheme " about the fall of the ninth @-@ century Mayan civilisation . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 The first chapter , " Gauguin 's Questions " , poses the questions that provide a framework for the book . Referring to Paul Gauguin 's painting of the same name the questions are : Where do we come from ? What are we ? Where are we going ? Wright defines progress using the Victorian terms " the assumption that a pattern of change exists in the history of mankind ... that it consists of irreversible changes in one direction only , and that this direction is towards improvement " . Despite the extended time span of the Stone Age , Wright places the first sign of progress as being the ability to create fire . The competition between Cro @-@ Magnon and Neanderthals is examined with respect to the conditions that allowed one to out @-@ compete the other . 
 The second chapter , " The Great Experiment " , continues the examination of Stone Age progress by looking at the advancements in hunting . Wright uses the term " progress trap " to refer to innovations that create new problems for which the society is unable or unwilling to solve , or inadvertently create conditions that are worse than what existed before the innovation . For example , innovations in hunting during the Stone Age allowed for more successful hunts and consequently more free time during which culture and art were created ( e.g. cave paintings , bone carvings , etc . ) , but also led to extinctions , most notably of megafauna . As smaller and smaller game were hunted to replace larger extinct animals , the hunts became less successful and culture declined . Agriculture , and subsequently civilisations , independently arising in multiple regions at about the same time , ~ 10 @,@ 000 years ago , indicates to Wright that " given certain broad conditions , human societies everywhere will move towards greater size , complexity and environmental demand " . The chapter title refers to the human experience which Wright sees as a large experiment testing what conditions are required for a human civilisation to succeed . 
 In the third chapter , " Fools ' Paradise " , the rise and fall of two civilisations are examined : Easter Island and Sumer . Both flourished , but collapsed as a result of resource depletion ; both were able to visually see their land being eroded but were unwilling to reform . On Easter Island logging , in order to erect statues and build boats , destroyed their ecosystem and led to wars over the last planks of wood on the island . In Sumer , a large irrigation system , as well as over @-@ grazing , land clearing , and lime @-@ burning led to desertification and soil salination . 
 In the fourth chapter , " Pyramid Schemes " , the fates of the Roman and Mayan civilisations are compared ; both peaked with centralised empires but ended with power being diffused to their periphery as the center collapsed and ultra @-@ conservative leadership refused reformations . Anthropologist Joseph <unk> 's explanation for the fall of the Roman Empire is invoked , that " complex systems inevitably succumb to diminishing returns " so that the costs of operating an empire are so high that alternatives are implemented . Two examples of civilisations that have been sustainable are described : China and Egypt . Both had an abundance of resources , particularly topsoil , and used farming methods that worked with , rather than against , natural cycles , and settlement patterns that did not exceed , or permanently damage , the carrying capacity of the local environment . 
 The final chapter , " The Rebellion of the Tools " , seeks to answer the final Gauguin question , ' where are we going ? ' , by applying these past examples to modern society . Technological advancements in bio @-@ engineering , nanotechnology , cybernetics , amongst others , have the potential to be progress traps , and the global scale of modern society means that a societal collapse could impact all of mankind . Wright sees needed reforms being blocked by vested interests who reject multi @-@ lateral organisations , and support laissez @-@ faire economics and transfers of power to corporations as leading to the social and environmental degradations that led to the collapse of previous civilisations . Necessary reforms are , in Wright 's view , being blocked by vested interests who are hostile to change , including American market extremists . Wright concludes that " our present behaviour is typical of failed societies at the zenith of their greed and arrogance " and calls for a shift towards long @-@ term thinking :

 The contents of the book were originally written and delivered as a set of five speeches for the 2004 Massey Lectures ; each speech is presented in the book as one chapter . The writing reflects Wright oration style with the use of high rhetoric . Patrick Parrinder notes that Wright sometimes uses " the rhetorical armoury of a rationalistic lay preacher . " Wright takes a broad , philosophical approach , not focusing on individual people or specific politics or religions , but rather focusing on civilisations including ' the elites and the masses ' . Wright 's tone was described as " rarely depressing ... [ and that ] he remains surprisingly upbeat and even entertaining . " The use of the word progress is intended to be ironic : what is viewed as technological or social advancement have , in the historical narratives he provides , led to the fall of civilizations . Wright coins the term " progress trap " to describe the phenomenon of turning " cleverness into recklessness . " 
 Comparisons have been made between this book and Jared Diamond 's Collapse : How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed which both cover similar subject matter with " a cautious problem @-@ solving approach " and come to similar conclusions . Writing in Alternatives Journal , philosophy professor Kent Peacock notes that " both are well @-@ written " but that Diamond includes examples of societies which had achieved sustainability for centuries , whereas Wright has " a stronger grasp of the dark side of human nature " , like impatience , aggressiveness , and obstinacy . Author and journalist Brian Brett described Collapse as " a slow , rich feast " while " the compact A Short History of Progress is an arrow loosed from a powerful bow , a lyric dart into the heart of human behaviour . "

 The book , published by House of Anansi Press , was released at the same time the Massey Lectures were being delivered . In early November 2004 , one lecture was given by Wright in each of the following cities : Ottawa , Edmonton , Saskatoon , Halifax and Toronto . Their recording was broadcast on CBC Radio 's Ideas during the week of November 22 . The book was named the Canadian Booksellers Association 's 2005 Non @-@ Fiction Book of the Year at their annual Libris Awards and short @-@ listed for the first annual British Columbia Award for Canadian Non @-@ Fiction . A hardcover edition title An Illustrated Short History of Progress was released with a print run of 15 @,@ 000 copies in 2006 . 
 In The Globe and Mail , Canadian author Paul William Roberts praised the book , calling it " ... the most important use of printed word and post @-@ consumer recycled fibres I have seen since Jérôme <unk> 's <unk> Prométhée , 25 years ago . " Roberts explains , " [ Wright ] has such a firm grasp of his goal that scarcely a word is extraneous ... You feel you 've read volumes , though , not just because of the density of Wright 's thoughts , but due to the crushing weight of the burden they carry . In prose that is <unk> evocative and irreducibly precise ... " On the other hand , in the National Post review , Peter Foster gave a negative review , chiding Wright for " not having the slightest clue about how economies work , or how , by their fundamental nature , markets are both moral and sustainable . " Foster ended his review by insulting Wright 's intellect , " What really needs some psychological excavation is Ronald Wright 's mind , which carries a set of inflated , emotionally based moralistic assumptions derived from the structure of his primitive ignorance about markets and economics . " 
 Other reviews were encouraging . In Maclean 's magazine Brian Bethune wrote it was " an elegant and learned discussion " on the topic . The review in The Times said it was " an eminently readable account ... written with an incredible lightness of touch that belies the very serious issues . " In the Montreal Gazette , Bryan <unk> called Wright eloquent and the book " a brief , trenchant essay . " Diane <unk> in Skeptic magazine , said Wright is a " remarkably gifted wordsmith whose talent makes turgid facts not only digestible , but also generates a hunger for more " and commented " A Short History of Progress is an important , well @-@ crafted book , however , I can 't promise that it will change your life .

 The film rights were sold to <unk> in 2008 . It was filmed as a documentary , Surviving Progress directed by Mathieu Roy and co @-@ directed by Harold Crooks with Daniel Louis and Denise Robert as producers for <unk> and Gerry <unk> as producer for NFB . Martin Scorsese was attached to the project as executive producer as were Mark <unk> and Betsy Carson ( Big Picture Media Corporation ) and Silva <unk> ( NFB ) . The film premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival . It was also shown as part of Festival Atmospheres on 31 March 2012 in Paris France . 
 While the book focused on ancient civilizations , the majority of the film addresses environmental impacts of our current ' global civilization ' , including the impact of concentrating wealth in the hands of the ' financial class ' . It is filmed as a mixture of interviews with individuals , from Wright himself to Jane Goodall and Margaret Atwood , interspersed with striking footage from all over the world . Mathieu Roy and Harold Crooks gave an interview in early 2012 on the challenges of adapting Ronald Wright 's book into a succinct film . 
 = The Fight ( Parks and Recreation ) = 
 " The Fight " is the thirteenth episode of the third season of the American comedy television series Parks and Recreation , and the 43rd overall episode of the series . It originally aired on NBC in the United States on May 12 , 2011 . In the episode , the parks department employees become very drunk during a bar outing , where Leslie and Ann have their first major fight . Meanwhile , Chris tells Tom he must sell his share in the bar due to a conflict with his government job . According to Nielsen Media Research , " The Fight " was seen by an estimated 4 @.@ 55 million household viewers , a drop from the previous original episode , " Eagleton " . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Chris ( Rob Lowe ) has fired Denis Cooper , the former health department public relations director , who hung posters around city hall to publicly condemn his adulterous wife . Leslie ( Amy Poehler ) suggests Ann ( Rashida Jones ) replace him , mainly because they can spend more time together , since Ann has been so busy dating numerous men . Although reluctant to leave her job as a nurse , Ann agrees to attend the job interview , and Leslie provides her with an overwhelming amount of reading material to prepare for it . Meanwhile , Tom ( Aziz Ansari ) encourages the parks department to attend the Snakehole Lounge , a nightclub he partially owns with his friend Jean @-@ Ralphio Saperstein ( Ben Schwartz ) , for the unveiling of his new alcoholic beverage , Snake Juice . Tom also encourages them to spread the word about the drink through word of mouth guerilla marketing . April ( Aubrey Plaza ) shows little interest in attending , until Andy ( Chris Pratt ) suggests they make a game of it by role @-@ playing as different people at the bar . April pretends to be Janet Snakehole , an aristocratic widow with a dark secret , while Andy poses as his frequent alter @-@ ego , FBI agent Burt Macklin . 
 That night , at the Snakehole Lounge , Leslie is surprised and annoyed to find Ann partying on the dance floor instead of preparing for the job interview . Ann introduces Leslie to her latest boyfriend , local radio host " The Douche " ( Nick Kroll ) . As Leslie and Ann become increasingly drunk from Snake Juice , Leslie insults Ann 's current dating lifestyle . This prompts Ann to insult Leslie for moving too slow with Ben ( Adam Scott ) , whom Leslie is attracted to . The fight escalates throughout the night , and Leslie ultimately claims she always has to keep Ann motivated or she would not go anywhere . Both declare it best that Ann not work with Leslie after all and they storm off . Meanwhile , the Snake Juice proves delicious and popular with the rest of the parks department employees , all of whom become extremely drunk , with the exception of Donna ( Retta ) who is the only one not drinking , claiming it 's " basically rat poison " . Chris arrives to warn Tom that using government employees to promote his own personal ventures is a breach of ethics . He tells a disappointed Tom that he must sell his shares of the Snakehole Lounge if he wants to keep his job . 
 The next morning , everyone who drank Snake Juice is extremely hungover ( except Ron ( Nick Offerman ) ) , and Leslie deeply regrets how she treated Ann . Ben visits Ann at her home and asks her to forgive Leslie . Ann , who also regrets the fight , is touched by Ben 's gesture and reveals that Leslie likes him . Ann decides to attend the job interview , during which she and Leslie apologize to each other . After a second interview with Chris , Ann is given the job in a part @-@ time basis , which also would allow her to continue her work as a nurse . Tom reluctantly decides to sell his Snakehole Lounge shares . Tom sells his shares the next morning to Jean @-@ Ralphio , while Donna tries to comfort Tom , causing him to ask why Chris did not make her sell her shares , to which she replies that Chris does not know that she owns shares . She then tells Jean @-@ Ralphio that " [ s ] <unk> get <unk> . " Ron attempts to convince Chris to let him keep the shares , and defends Tom 's efforts to branch out by claiming the move was not unethical , but Chris is not persuaded . Instead , Ron comforts Tom by building him a special case to hold a bottle of Snake Juice . At the same time , April tries to reprise her role of Janet Snakehole and have Andy reprise Burt Macklin , but a hungover Andy says that " ... Burt Macklin died last night after the 10th shot of Snake Juice . " However , after seeing a sad April walk away , Andy creates himself a new role : Kip Hackman , Burt Macklin 's brother and chases after Janet , although he vomits as this happens .

 " The Fight " was directed by Randall Einhorn and written by Parks and Recreation star Amy Poehler , the second script she penned for the series after " Telethon " in the second season . Filmed in December 2010 , " The Fight " was originally broadcast on May 12 , 2011 , and ran back @-@ to @-@ back with the episode " Road Trip " , which aired immediately afterward . The two are stand @-@ alone episodes that were not originally designed to be shown together . However , because the third season premiered late as a mid @-@ season replacement in January , the two episodes aired together so the series ' season would conclude at the end of the television season . The filming of " The Fight " involved a particularly large amount of improvisation among the actors , a common technique among Parks and Recreation episodes . Each actor spent about two days on their own filming their Snakehole Lounge scenes , which included the shots used in a montage sequence that showed how drunk each character had become by the end of the night . Poehler described the filming as " the most fun I 've ever had " . 
 Although Ann Perkins was initially conceived as a character outside of city hall who became involved with Leslie and her political world , series co @-@ creator Michael Schur said he believed it made sense that she would take a city hall job because " we just decided that Leslie ’ s pull would be strong enough to get her to make a move , career @-@ wise " . Schur also said it would make it easier for the character to become involved in stories with the others . " The Fight " featured several appearances by actors who had appeared in previous Parks and Recreation episodes , including Ben Schwartz as Tom 's friend Jean @-@ Ralphio , who helps him promote Snake Juice throughout the night . Andy Forrest appeared as Andy 's shoeshine customer Kyle , who is often insulted and mocked by Andy and the other characters during his <unk> . Nick Kroll also appeared as " The Douche " , the host of the Pawnee morning zoo @-@ style radio show " Crazy Ira and The Douche " , which was previously featured in the episode " Media Blitz " . 
 During one scene , Ron says , " I won 't publicly endorse a product unless I use it exclusively and I really believe in it . My only official recommendations are US Army issued mustache trimmers , Morton 's Salt , and the C.R. Lawrence fine two inch style oscillating knife blade . " That line was written by Schur , and the scene used in the episode was Nick Offerman 's first take , with no mistakes made with the complicated dialogue . Immediately after " The Fight " first aired , a " Producer 's Cut " version was made available on the official NBC.com website . It included an additional four minutes of material , that include a previously @-@ unaired cold open in which Ron sternly demands to know which employee has broken the parks department 's coffee machine ; this prompts a fight as the staff make accusations against each other . Ron secretly reveals to the camera that he broke the machine himself , but questioned the other employees anyway to deliberately start the arguments .

 Before the credits , Ron mockingly refers to a pig 's head on a stick , a reference to the novel Lord of the Flies . 
 While providing Ann with reading material to prepare for her job interview , Leslie also gives her a copy of the 2010 Jonathan Franzen novel Freedom , claiming she wants to discuss the protagonist Patty <unk> with her . While drunk at the Snakehole Lounge , Ben says the words " baba <unk> " and starts laughing . The phrase is a nickname for Gary Dell <unk> , a radio producer with The Howard Stern Show , and became a common catchphrase among Howard Stern fans .

 " The Fight " received generally positive reviews , and several commentators noted that Ann 's new part @-@ time job at city hall provides a good explanation for why she is always spending time around the parks department despite working at the hospital . The scenes at the Snakehole Lounge were also praised as particularly funny , especially a shot where Ron Swanson dances drunkenly while wearing April 's small woman 's hat . Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said the episode was a good character study of the relationship between Leslie and Ann , and that the bar scenes " gave the whole episode a chaotic yet welcoming feel , like it was the show 's drunken greatest hits " . Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said she loved the episode and called the Snakehole Lounge scenes a " tour @-@ de @-@ force " that highlighted the comedic skills of the entire cast . Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com enjoyed the silliness of the episode , and claimed that the characters are so well @-@ developed and likable that watching the Snakehole Lounge scenes felt like hanging out with real @-@ life friends at a bar . Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club called it a " stellar " episode that was " loose , silly , rich with details and heart " . He praised the fast pace and comedic timing of the jokes , and wrote , " it felt like the director was having as much fun as possible in ' The Fight . ' " Scott Meslow of The Atlantic called " The Fight " a very funny episode which offers a " great solution " to why Ann Perkins spends so much time in city hall , which he called one of the show 's " last nagging questions " . 
 Joel Keller of TV Squad said the cast did a good job of playing drunk without being overly exaggerated . He also believed Ann 's part @-@ time job was a good way to integrate her into the case , as she had " seemed adrift this season " . Zap2it writer Rick Porter felt the episode was " a little light on plot " but included many funny scenes , particularly Andy and April 's role @-@ playing , and Ron 's chipper attitude the morning after the bar visit , while everyone else remained hungover . Porter also praised Rashida Jones 's performance during her hangover scenes . Matt Fowler of IGN said he enjoyed Tom 's efforts to " become a high @-@ roller this season " , and said Andy and April were fantastic during their role @-@ playing scenes . Fowler also described Ron 's defense of Tom 's actions as " heart @-@ warming " . He gave the episode a 9 out of 10 . Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic said he believed Ann 's new part @-@ time job would help better integrate her into the cast . McHatton said the sweet scenes between Leslie and Ben are " quickly becoming my favorite scenes in the series " , and said a shot of Ron dancing while drunk at the Snakehole Lounge was " easily one of the funniest things he ’ s done yet " . 
 = Japanese battleship Aki = 
 Aki ( <unk> ) was a Satsuma @-@ class semi @-@ dreadnought battleship built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) during the first decade of the 20th century . She was the second battleship built domestically in Japan and the first to use steam turbines for <unk> . The ship was named for Aki Province , now a part of Hiroshima Prefecture . The ship saw no combat during World War I. Aki was disarmed in 1922 and sunk as a target in 1924 in accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Satsuma class was ordered in late 1904 under the 1904 War Naval Supplementary Program during the Russo @-@ Japanese War . Unlike the previous Katori @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleships , they were the first battleships ordered from Japanese shipyards . They were originally designed with a dozen 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) guns , but had to be redesigned because of a shortage of guns in Japan and to reduce costs . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The ship had an overall length of 492 feet ( 150 @.@ 0 m ) , a beam of 83 feet 7 inches ( 25 @.@ 5 m ) , and a normal draft of 27 feet 6 inches ( 8 @.@ 4 m ) . She displaced 20 @,@ 100 long tons ( 20 @,@ 400 t ) at normal load . The crew consisted of 931 officers and enlisted men . 
 Aki was fitted with a pair of Curtiss steam turbine sets using steam from 15 Miyabara water @-@ tube boilers . The turbines were rated at a total of 24 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 18 @,@ 000 kW ) for a design speed of 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) . The ship reached a top speed of 20 @.@ 25 knots ( 37 @.@ 50 km / h ; 23 @.@ 30 mph ) during her sea trials from 27 @,@ 740 shp ( 20 @,@ 690 kW ) . She carried enough coal and oil to give her a range of 9 @,@ 100 nautical miles ( 16 @,@ 900 km ; 10 @,@ 500 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Unlike her half @-@ sister , she had three funnels . 
 The ship was completed with four 45 @-@ caliber 12 @-@ inch 41st Year Type guns in two gun turrets , one each fore and aft of the superstructure . They fired 850 @-@ pound ( 386 kg ) armor @-@ piercing ( AP ) shells to a maximum range of 24 @,@ 000 yd ( 22 @,@ 000 m ) . The intermediate armament consisted of six twin @-@ gun turrets equipped with 45 @-@ caliber Type 41 10 @-@ inch guns , three turrets on each side of the superstructure . Her heavy intermediate armament of guns larger than 9 inches ( 229 mm ) is why the ship is considered to be a semi @-@ dreadnought . 
 Aki 's secondary armament consisted of eight 40 @-@ caliber 6 @-@ inch 41st Year Type guns , mounted in casemates in the sides of the hull . The ship was also equipped with eight quick @-@ firing ( QF ) 40 @-@ caliber 12 @-@ pounder 12 @-@ cwt guns and four 28 @-@ caliber 12 @-@ pounder QF guns . In addition , the battleship was fitted with five submerged 18 @-@ inch ( 457 mm ) torpedo tubes , two on each broadside and one in the stern . 
 The waterline main belt of the Satsuma @-@ class vessels consisted of Krupp cemented armor that had a maximum thickness of 9 inches ( 229 mm ) amidships . It tapered to a thickness of 4 inches ( 102 mm ) at the ends of the ship . A 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) strake of armor protected the casemates . The barbettes for the main guns were 7 – 9 @.@ 5 inches ( 180 – 240 mm ) thick . The armor of Aki 's main gun turrets had a maximum thickness of 8 inches ( 203 mm ) . The deck armor was 2 – 3 inches ( 51 – 76 mm ) thick and the conning tower was protected by six inches of armor .

 Aki was laid down at Kure Naval Arsenal on 15 March 1906 . She was launched on 15 April 1907 , but construction was suspended for about five months after the decision was made on 26 November to install steam turbines on Aki and the armored cruiser Ibuki . Aki 's turbines were already behind schedule and the suspension allowed the less valuable ship to be completed first , and changes made to its turbines after testing were also incorporated into Aki 's turbines . Aki was finally completed on 11 March 1911 and her first captain was Tatsuo Matsumura .

 When World War I began in August 1914 , Aki was refitting at Kure Naval Arsenal . She was assigned to the 1st Battleship Squadron upon the completion of her refit and remained with it until she was transferred to the 2nd Battleship Squadron in 1918 , seeing no combat during the war . From December 1915 to December 1916 , she was commanded by Captain Kiyokazu Abo . The ship was disarmed at Yokosuka in 1922 to comply with the provisions of the Washington Naval Treaty , stricken from the navy list during 1923 and converted into a target ship . Aki was sunk by the battlecruiser Kongō and the battleship Hyūga on 2 September 1924 in Tokyo Bay . Two of her 10 @-@ inch gun turrets were installed as coastal artillery batteries on <unk> island to protect Tokyo Bay .

 Flavius Mar ( <unk> ? ) Petrus Theodorus Valentinus Rusticius Boraides Germanus <unk> , simply and commonly known as Justin ( Latin : <unk> , Greek : <unk> ; circa 525 – 566 ) , was an East Roman ( Byzantine ) aristocrat and general . A member of the Justinian Dynasty and nephew of Emperor Justinian I ( r . 527 – 565 ) , he was appointed as one of the last Roman consuls in 540 , before going on to assume senior military commands in the Balkans and in Lazica . He fought against the Slavs , the Sassanid Persians and supervised the Byzantine Empire 's first contacts with the Avars . At the time of Justinian 's death , he was seen as a probable successor , but was beaten to the throne by his cousin , Justin II ( r . 565 – 578 ) , who exiled him to Egypt , where he was murdered .

In 540 , he was named ordinary consul at a very young age ; he is illustrated as beardless in his consular diptych , and is still mentioned as a " young man " by Procopius nine years later . At this point , he already held the title of vir illustris and the honorary office of comes <unk> . In the same year , he accompanied his father to the East against the Sassanid Persians , but saw no action . In 549 , he was instrumental in the revelation of the plot to overthrow Emperor Justinian by the Armenian general Artabanes and his associates . The conspirators intended to assassinate Emperor Justinian and his favourite general Belisarius , and raise Germanus to the Byzantine throne . Notified of their intentions , Justin informed his father , who then told Marcellus , the Count of the Excubitors , leading to the plotters ' arrest . 
 In 550 , together with his younger brother Justinian , he joined their father in his expedition against Ostrogoth Italy , but Germanus died suddenly in the autumn of 550 , before the army had left the Balkans , where it was assembling . After this , Justinian and Germanus 's son @-@ in @-@ law , John , led the army towards Salona ( modern Split , Croatia ) , where the eunuch Narses assumed command in late 551 . In early 551 , Justin was attached to a force under the eunuch Scholasticus that campaigned against a Slavic raid in the eastern Balkans . The Byzantines were initially defeated near Adrianople but went on to score a victory , after which the Slavs left Byzantine lands . In early 552 , Justin and Justinian were placed at the head of another expedition against a Slavic raid against Illyricum , but their forces were too small to confront the raiders directly . Instead , the brothers had to content themselves with harassing them . Shortly after , they were ordered north to assist the Lombards against the Gepids along with <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , but the Byzantines were detained from advancing too far north by the need to suppress religious strife in the city of <unk> . 
 = = = High command in Lazica and the Danube = = = 
 In 554 , now experienced in military affairs , Justin was sent east to Lazica to join the Byzantine forces under Bessas , <unk> , and Martin . His first encounter with the Persians was unsuccessful . Along with Bessas , Justin and his troops were encamped at the plain of <unk> , near the strategically important fortress of <unk> , which was held by Martin . The Persian general Mihr @-@ Mihroe , however , succeeded in dislodging Martin from <unk> . Martin withdrew to join the other two generals at <unk> , but there again the Byzantine army , too slow to take up position , was forced to flee in disarray before the advancing Persians , retreating along the Phasis river to the fortified island of Nesos ( <unk> , Greek for " island " ) . Bessas was dismissed from high command as magister militum per Armeniam after this debacle , and succeeded by Martin with Justin as his second in command . Justin was ignorant of Martin 's intention to assassinate their ally , the Lazic king Gubazes II ; when he learned of the deed , he was shocked , but did not reprimand Martin because he believed – wrongly – that the murder had been carried out at the orders of Emperor Justinian . 
 The Byzantines then launched an attack on the Persian fort of <unk> , but they were forced to abandon it at the unexpectedly quick arrival of Persian relief forces under <unk> . In spring 556 , Justin was with the rest of the Byzantine forces at Nesos , when <unk> invaded western Lazica , making for the town of Phasis . The Byzantines hastily departed for the town , managing to reach it before the Persian army and then proceeded to successfully defend it during a prolonged siege . Following this success , in early 556 Justin returned to Nesos to guard it together with <unk> , while the rest of the army marched against the <unk> , a tribe that had recently allied itself with the Persians and killed the Byzantine general <unk> . Justin 's only activity during this time was to dispatch one of his officers , <unk> , to capture <unk> ( modern <unk> ) with 2 @,@ 000 cavalry . In the next year , a general truce was agreed , which was finalized into a peace treaty in 562 . 
 Soon after , an imperial investigation into Gubazes 's murder brought to light Martin 's culpability . His military successes spared his life , but cost him his command ; he was replaced as magister militum per Armeniam by Justin in spring 557 . It was in this capacity that in late 557 Justin received the first Avar embassy to the Byzantine Empire . The Avars , who had fled their ancestral lands in Central Asia before the rise of the Göktürks , asked for imperial protection and for land to settle on . Justin forwarded them to Constantinople , where they arrived in December . Turned away from the Empire and towards the plains of the Ukraine by Justinian , the Avars defeated enemy after enemy and eventually reached the northeastern bank of the Danube in 561 / 562 . There they again encountered Justin , who had just been transferred to the command of the <unk> exercitus covering the lower Danubian limes ( the Limes <unk> ) . At this time , the Avars demanded to settle in Byzantine imperial territory in Scythia Minor , whose defences had been devastated by a recent <unk> invasion led by <unk> . Here , Justin played a crucial role and gained great fame , by learning of the Avars ' intentions and warning Justinian . Consequently , the Avar embassy to Constantinople was detained while the Byzantine defences were put in order . With Justin continuing to maintain a careful watch over the Danube river , the Avars contented themselves with the annual subsidy paid by Byzantium , and left the Empire in peace for some years to come . 
 = = = Exile and death = = = 
 At the time of Emperor Justinian 's death in 565 , due to his titles and reputation as a commander , as well his army 's proximity to the imperial capital , he was the leading contender for the vacant throne , along with his cousin Justin , the curopalates . The latter , however , was already present at Constantinople , and could count on the support of the Byzantine Senate , and especially of Patriarch John Scholasticus and the Count of the Excubitors Tiberius , whom he had helped secure his post . Thus Justin was hastily elevated to the throne on the same day that Justinian died . According to the contemporary historian Evagrius Scholasticus , the two <unk> had reached an agreement whereby whoever would be crowned emperor would make the other the " second man " in the empire . When Justin II recalled his cousin to Constantinople , it seemed that this was the reason . The general was warmly received at first , but soon the new emperor began to make accusations against him , dismissed his bodyguard and placed him under house arrest , before sending him to exile in Alexandria , ostensibly as the new <unk> prefect of Egypt . There , he was murdered in his sleep , ostensibly because he was plotting to seize the throne , and his head was cut off and brought to Constantinople . In reality , he was too great a threat to the new emperor to be left alive ; the Visigoth chronicler John of <unk> explicitly attributes the murder to Justin II 's wife , the Empress Sophia . 
 = 1933 Outer Banks hurricane = 
 The 1933 Outer Banks hurricane lashed portions of the North Carolina and Virginia coasts less than a month after another hurricane hit the general area . The twelfth tropical storm and sixth hurricane of the 1933 Atlantic hurricane season , it formed by September 8 to the east of the Lesser Antilles . It moved generally to the north @-@ northwest and strengthened quickly to peak winds of 140 mph ( 220 km / h ) on September 12 . This made it a major hurricane and a Category 4 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale . The hurricane remained at or near that intensity for several days while tracking to the northwest . It weakened approaching the southeastern United States , and on September 16 passed just east of Cape Hatteras , North Carolina with winds of about 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) . Turning to the northeast , the hurricane became extratropical on September 18 before moving across Atlantic Canada , eventually dissipating four days later . 
 The threat of the hurricane prompted widespread tropical cyclone warnings and watches along the eastern United States and prompted some people to evacuate . Damage was heaviest in southeastern North Carolina near New Bern , where the combination of high tides and swollen rivers flooded much of the town . Across North Carolina , the hurricane caused power outages , washed out roads , and damaged crops . Several houses were damaged , leaving about 1 @,@ 000 people homeless . Damage was estimated at $ 4 @.@ 5 million , and there were 21 deaths in the state , mostly from drowning . Hurricane force winds extended into southeastern Virginia , where there were two deaths . High tides isolated a lighthouse near Norfolk and covered several roads . Farther north , two people on a small boat were left missing in Maine , and another person was presumed killed when his boat sank in Nova Scotia . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Beginning on September 7 , there was an area of disturbed weather near and east of the Lesser Antilles , by which time there was a nearly closed circulation . At 0800 UTC the next day , a ship reported winds of about 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) ; on that basis , it is estimated a tropical depression developed eight hours earlier and into a tropical storm by the time of the report . The storm tracked generally to the north @-@ northwest , passing about 300 mi ( 480 km ) northeast of Saint Martin . Based on continuity and subsequent reports , it is estimated the storm intensified into a hurricane on September 10 . Early on September 12 , a ship reported a barometric pressure of 947 mbar ( 28 @.@ 0 inHg ) in the periphery of the storm while reporting winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) . This suggested winds of 140 mph ( 220 km / h ) , making it the equivalent of a modern Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale . 
 For over two days , the hurricane remained near peak intensity while tracking to the northwest , and during that time several ships reported low pressure and strong winds . The hurricane weakened as it turned to the north @-@ northwest toward the eastern United States . At around 1100 UTC on September 16 , the eye of the hurricane passed over Cape Hatteras , North Carolina , around which time a pressure of 957 mbar ( 28 @.@ 3 inHg ) was recorded . The eye also passed over Diamond Shoals , where a pressure of 952 mbar ( 28 @.@ 1 inHg ) was recorded . Based on the reading , it was estimated the hurricane remained about 15 mi ( 25 km ) east of the Outer Banks , with winds of about 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) occurring along the coast . By that time , the size of the storm had greatly increased , and hurricane force winds also extended into southeastern Virginia . The hurricane turned to the northeast , ahead of an approaching cold front , producing tropical storm force winds along the eastern United States through New England . After passing southeast of Cape Cod , the storm increasingly lost its tropical characteristics , and was an extratropical cyclone by 1100 UTC on September 18 when it made landfall on eastern Nova Scotia . Continuing to the northeast , the former hurricane crossed the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and subsequently near Newfoundland and Labrador , eventually dissipating on September 22 between southern Greenland and Iceland . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 While the hurricane was approaching the Carolinas , the Weather Bureau issued storm warnings from Jacksonville , Florida to Beaufort , North Carolina at 2100 UTC on September 14 . Six hours later , these were extended northward to Virginia Capes . By 1530 UTC on September 15 , forecasters predicted that the hurricane would hit North Carolina in 12 hours and ordered hurricane warnings from Wilmington , North Carolina to Cape Hatteras . At the same time , the storm warning was expanded northward to Boston , Massachusetts , and later to Eastport , Maine . The early warnings gave ample time for preparation for the storm in Norfolk , reducing damages considerably . Residents in Virginia evacuated farther inland to escape the storm . 
 The outer rainbands of the hurricane dropped moderate to heavy rainfall , peaking at 12 @.@ 6 in ( 320 mm ) in Cape Hatteras . Due to the storm remaining offshore , damage was much less than another hurricane less than a month prior . Damage from this hurricane was heaviest near New Bern , North Carolina , where the storm surge reached 3 to 4 ft ( 0 @.@ 91 to 1 @.@ 22 m ) , which was 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) higher than the record set in 1913 . Much of the town was flooded due to the high tide and swollen nearby rivers . Strong winds in the city uprooted several trees and damaged roofs . Morehead City suffered similar but slightly lesser damage , including hundreds of downed trees , and Beaufort experienced one of its worst storms in the memory of its residents . Across the region , the storm downed telephone and telegraph lines . Several roads were washed out , and there was moderate agriculture damage , including hundreds of drowned livestock and flooded cotton crop . There were 21 deaths , mostly related to drownings , and damage was estimated at $ 4 @.@ 5 million . About 1 @,@ 000 people were left homeless . After the storm , relief agencies provided food and medical crews for the storm victims . 
 In southeastern Virginia , winds reached 79 mph ( 128 km / h ) . At Sewell 's Point in Norfolk , the storm produced 8 @.@ 3 ft ( 2 @.@ 5 m ) high tides , which turned the peninsula containing New Point Comfort Light into an island . Several roads were flooded , which disrupted traffic and forced residents to travel by rowboat . About 2 @,@ 000 people lost power , and due to well @-@ executed preparations , there were two deaths in the state . Damage was estimated at $ 250 @,@ 000 . Outside of Virginia , damage was minimal north of Cape Henry . Wind peaks included 48 mph ( 77 km / h ) in Atlantic City , New Jersey and 52 mph ( 84 km / h ) on Block Island . A boat required rescue in the Delaware Bay . Precipitation fell on the western periphery of the hurricane , associated with an approaching cold front . In Provincetown , Massachusetts , the storm dropped 12 @.@ 3 in ( 310 mm ) of rainfall it passed the region . In New England , high waves damaged waterfront properties . On Block Island , two boats were damaged , and another sank . In Maine , the rainfall flooded cellars and damaged roads . Two people were reported missing in <unk> Harbor after venturing into the storm in a small boat . 
 Still maintaining strong winds by the time it struck Canada , the former hurricane washed one boat ashore , left three missing , and capsized one . One person was presumed killed when his boat sunk in Lockeport , Nova Scotia . The storm dropped heavy rainfall across the region , including 1 @.@ 1 in ( 27 mm ) in Yarmouth , Nova Scotia , and about 3 in ( 75 mm ) in 15 hours in Gagetown , New Brunswick ; there , the rains flooded roads and damaged crops . At Harvey Station in the same province , high rainfall washed out a 75 ft ( 22 m ) portion of a rail line . 
 = Metagenomics = 
 Metagenomics is the study of genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples . The broad field may also be referred to as environmental genomics , <unk> or community genomics . While traditional microbiology and microbial genome sequencing and genomics rely upon cultivated clonal cultures , early environmental gene sequencing cloned specific genes ( often the 16S rRNA gene ) to produce a profile of diversity in a natural sample . Such work revealed that the vast majority of microbial biodiversity had been missed by cultivation @-@ based methods . Recent studies use either " shotgun " or PCR directed sequencing to get largely unbiased samples of all genes from all the members of the sampled communities . Because of its ability to reveal the previously hidden diversity of microscopic life , metagenomics offers a powerful lens for viewing the microbial world that has the potential to revolutionize understanding of the entire living world . As the price of DNA sequencing continues to fall , metagenomics now allows microbial ecology to be investigated at a much greater scale and detail than before . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The term " metagenomics " was first used by Jo Handelsman , Jon Clardy , Robert M. Goodman , Sean F. Brady , and others , and first appeared in publication in 1998 . The term metagenome referenced the idea that a collection of genes sequenced from the environment could be analyzed in a way analogous to the study of a single genome . Recently , Kevin Chen and Lior Pachter ( researchers at the University of California , Berkeley ) defined metagenomics as " the application of modern genomics technique without the need for isolation and lab cultivation of individual species " . 
 = = History = = 
 Conventional sequencing begins with a culture of identical cells as a source of DNA . However , early metagenomic studies revealed that there are probably large groups of microorganisms in many environments that cannot be cultured and thus cannot be sequenced . These early studies focused on 16S ribosomal RNA sequences which are relatively short , often conserved within a species , and generally different between species . Many 16S rRNA sequences have been found which do not belong to any known cultured species , indicating that there are numerous non @-@ isolated organisms . These surveys of ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) genes taken directly from the environment revealed that cultivation based methods find less than 1 % of the bacterial and archaeal species in a sample . Much of the interest in metagenomics comes from these discoveries that showed that the vast majority of microorganisms had previously gone unnoticed . 
 Early molecular work in the field was conducted by Norman R. Pace and colleagues , who used PCR to explore the diversity of ribosomal RNA sequences . The insights gained from these breakthrough studies led Pace to propose the idea of cloning DNA directly from environmental samples as early as 1985 . This led to the first report of isolating and cloning bulk DNA from an environmental sample , published by Pace and colleagues in 1991 while Pace was in the Department of Biology at Indiana University . Considerable efforts ensured that these were not PCR false positives and supported the existence of a complex community of unexplored species . Although this methodology was limited to exploring highly conserved , non @-@ protein coding genes , it did support early microbial morphology @-@ based observations that diversity was far more complex than was known by culturing methods . Soon after that , Healy reported the metagenomic isolation of functional genes from " <unk> " constructed from a complex culture of environmental organisms grown in the laboratory on dried grasses in 1995 . After leaving the Pace laboratory , Edward DeLong continued in the field and has published work that has largely laid the groundwork for environmental phylogenies based on signature 16S sequences , beginning with his group 's construction of libraries from marine samples . 
 In 2002 , Mya Breitbart , Forest Rohwer , and colleagues used environmental shotgun sequencing ( see below ) to show that 200 liters of seawater contains over 5000 different viruses . Subsequent studies showed that there are more than a thousand viral species in human stool and possibly a million different viruses per kilogram of marine sediment , including many bacteriophages . Essentially all of the viruses in these studies were new species . In 2004 , Gene Tyson , Jill Banfield , and colleagues at the University of California , Berkeley and the Joint Genome Institute sequenced DNA extracted from an acid mine drainage system . This effort resulted in the complete , or nearly complete , genomes for a handful of bacteria and archaea that had previously resisted attempts to culture them . 
 Beginning in 2003 , Craig Venter , leader of the privately funded parallel of the Human Genome Project , has led the Global Ocean Sampling Expedition ( <unk> ) , circumnavigating the globe and collecting metagenomic samples throughout the journey . All of these samples are sequenced using shotgun sequencing , in hopes that new genomes ( and therefore new organisms ) would be identified . The pilot project , conducted in the Sargasso Sea , found DNA from nearly 2000 different species , including 148 types of bacteria never before seen . Venter has circumnavigated the globe and thoroughly explored the West Coast of the United States , and completed a two @-@ year expedition to explore the Baltic , Mediterranean and Black Seas . Analysis of the metagenomic data collected during this journey revealed two groups of organisms , one composed of taxa adapted to environmental conditions of ' feast or famine ' , and a second composed of relatively fewer but more abundantly and widely distributed taxa primarily composed of plankton . 
 In 2005 Stephan C. Schuster at Penn State University and colleagues published the first sequences of an environmental sample generated with high @-@ throughput sequencing , in this case massively parallel pyrosequencing developed by 454 Life Sciences . Another early paper in this area appeared in 2006 by Robert Edwards , Forest Rohwer , and colleagues at San Diego State University . 
 = = Sequencing = = 
 Recovery of DNA sequences longer than a few thousand base pairs from environmental samples was very difficult until recent advances in molecular biological techniques allowed the construction of libraries in bacterial artificial chromosomes ( <unk> ) , which provided better vectors for molecular cloning . 
 = = = Shotgun metagenomics = = = 
 Advances in bioinformatics , refinements of DNA amplification , and the proliferation of computational power have greatly aided the analysis of DNA sequences recovered from environmental samples , allowing the adaptation of shotgun sequencing to metagenomic samples . The approach , used to sequence many cultured microorganisms and the human genome , randomly shears DNA , sequences many short sequences , and reconstructs them into a consensus sequence . Shotgun sequencing reveals genes present in environmental samples . Historically , clone libraries were used to facilitate this sequencing . However , with advances in high throughput sequencing technologies , the cloning step is no longer necessary and greater yields of sequencing data can be obtained without this labour @-@ intensive bottleneck step . Shotgun metagenomics provides information both about which organisms are present and what metabolic processes are possible in the community . Because the collection of DNA from an environment is largely uncontrolled , the most abundant organisms in an environmental sample are most highly represented in the resulting sequence data . To achieve the high coverage needed to fully resolve the genomes of under @-@ represented community members , large samples , often prohibitively so , are needed . On the other hand , the random nature of shotgun sequencing ensures that many of these organisms , which would otherwise go unnoticed using traditional culturing techniques , will be represented by at least some small sequence segments . 
 = = = High @-@ throughput sequencing = = = 
 The first metagenomic studies conducted using high @-@ throughput sequencing used massively parallel 454 pyrosequencing . Three other technologies commonly applied to environmental sampling are the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine , the Illumina <unk> or <unk> and the Applied <unk> SOLiD system . These techniques for sequencing DNA generate shorter fragments than Sanger sequencing ; Ion Torrent PGM System and 454 pyrosequencing typically produces ~ 400 bp reads , Illumina <unk> produces 400 @-@ <unk> reads ( depending on whether paired end options are used ) , and SOLiD produce 25 @-@ 75 bp reads . Historically , these read lengths were significantly shorter than the typical Sanger sequencing read length of ~ 750 bp , however the Illumina technology is quickly coming close to this benchmark . However , this limitation is compensated for by the much larger number of sequence reads . In 2009 , <unk> metagenomes generate 200 – 500 megabases , and Illumina platforms generate around 20 – 50 gigabases , but these outputs have increased by orders of magnitude in recent years . An additional advantage to high throughput sequencing is that this technique does not require cloning the DNA before sequencing , removing one of the main biases and bottlenecks in environmental sampling . 
 = = Bioinformatics = = 
 The data generated by metagenomics experiments are both enormous and inherently noisy , containing fragmented data representing as many as 10 @,@ 000 species . The sequencing of the cow rumen metagenome generated 279 gigabases , or 279 billion base pairs of nucleotide sequence data , while the human gut microbiome gene catalog identified 3 @.@ 3 million genes assembled from 567 @.@ 7 gigabases of sequence data . Collecting , curating , and extracting useful biological information from datasets of this size represent significant computational challenges for researchers . 
 = = = Sequence pre @-@ filtering = = = 
 The first step of metagenomic data analysis requires the execution of certain pre @-@ filtering steps , including the removal of redundant , low @-@ quality sequences and sequences of probable eukaryotic origin ( especially in metagenomes of human origin ) . The methods available for the removal of contaminating eukaryotic genomic DNA sequences include Eu @-@ <unk> and <unk> . 
 = = = Assembly = = = 
 DNA sequence data from genomic and metagenomic projects are essentially the same , but genomic sequence data offers higher coverage while metagenomic data is usually highly non @-@ redundant . Furthermore , the increased use of second @-@ generation sequencing technologies with short read lengths means that much of future metagenomic data will be error @-@ prone . Taken in combination , these factors make the assembly of metagenomic sequence reads into genomes difficult and unreliable . <unk> are caused by the presence of repetitive DNA sequences that make assembly especially difficult because of the difference in the relative abundance of species present in the sample . <unk> can also involve the combination of sequences from more than one species into chimeric contigs . 
 There are several assembly programs , most of which can use information from paired @-@ end tags in order to improve the accuracy of assemblies . Some programs , such as <unk> or Celera <unk> , were designed to be used to assemble single genomes but nevertheless produce good results when assembling metagenomic data sets . Other programs , such as Velvet assembler , have been optimized for the shorter reads produced by second @-@ generation sequencing through the use of de Bruijn graphs . The use of reference genomes allows researchers to improve the assembly of the most abundant microbial species , but this approach is limited by the small subset of microbial phyla for which sequenced genomes are available . After an assembly is created , an additional challenge is " metagenomic deconvolution " , or determining which sequences come from which species in the sample . 
 = = = Gene prediction = = = 
 Metagenomic analysis pipelines use two approaches in the annotation of coding regions in the assembled contigs . The first approach is to identify genes based upon homology with genes that are already publicly available in sequence databases , usually by simple BLAST searches . This type of approach is implemented in the program <unk> . The second , ab initio , uses intrinsic features of the sequence to predict coding regions based upon gene training sets from related organisms . This is the approach taken by programs such as <unk> and <unk> . The main advantage of ab initio prediction is that it enables the detection of coding regions that lack homologs in the sequence databases ; however , it is most accurate when there are large regions of contiguous genomic DNA available for comparison . 
 = = = Species diversity = = = 
 Gene annotations provide the " what " , while measurements of species diversity provide the " who " . In order to connect community composition and function in metagenomes , sequences must be binned . <unk> is the process of associating a particular sequence with an organism . In similarity @-@ based binning , methods such as BLAST are used to rapidly search for phylogenetic markers or otherwise similar sequences in existing public databases . This approach is implemented in <unk> . Another tool , <unk> , uses interpolated Markov models to assign reads . <unk> and <unk> are methods based on unique clade @-@ specific markers for estimating organismal relative abundances with improved computational performances . In composition based binning , methods use intrinsic features of the sequence , such as oligonucleotide frequencies or codon usage bias . Once sequences are binned , it is possible to carry out comparative analysis of diversity and richness utilising tools such as <unk> . 
 = = = Data integration = = = 
 The massive amount of exponentially growing sequence data is a daunting challenge that is complicated by the complexity of the metadata associated with metagenomic projects . Metadata includes detailed information about the three @-@ dimensional ( including depth , or height ) geography and environmental features of the sample , physical data about the sample site , and the methodology of the sampling . This information is necessary both to ensure replicability and to enable downstream analysis . Because of its importance , metadata and collaborative data review and curation require standardized data formats located in specialized databases , such as the Genomes <unk> Database ( GOLD ) . 
 Several tools have been developed to integrate metadata and sequence data , allowing downstream comparative analyses of different datasets using a number of ecological indices . In 2007 , <unk> Meyer and Robert Edwards and a team at Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Chicago released the Metagenomics Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology server ( MG @-@ RAST ) a community resource for metagenome data set analysis . As of June 2012 over 14 @.@ 8 <unk> ( <unk> bases ) of DNA have been analyzed , with more than 10 @,@ 000 public data sets freely available for comparison within MG @-@ RAST . Over 8 @,@ 000 users now have submitted a total of 50 @,@ 000 metagenomes to MG @-@ RAST . The Integrated Microbial Genomes / <unk> ( IMG / M ) system also provides a collection of tools for functional analysis of microbial communities based on their metagenome sequence , based upon reference isolate genomes included from the Integrated Microbial Genomes ( IMG ) system and the Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea ( <unk> ) project . 
 One of the first standalone tools for analysing high @-@ throughput metagenome shotgun data was <unk> ( <unk> Genome <unk> ) . A first version of the program was used in 2005 to analyse the metagenomic context of DNA sequences obtained from a mammoth bone . Based on a BLAST comparison against a reference database , this tool performs both taxonomic and functional binning , by placing the reads onto the nodes of the NCBI taxonomy using a simple lowest common ancestor ( LCA ) algorithm or onto the nodes of the SEED or <unk> classifications , respectively . 
 = = = Comparative metagenomics = = = 
 Comparative analyses between metagenomes can provide additional insight into the function of complex microbial communities and their role in host health . <unk> or multiple comparisons between metagenomes can be made at the level of sequence composition ( comparing GC @-@ content or genome size ) , taxonomic diversity , or functional complement . Comparisons of population structure and phylogenetic diversity can be made on the basis of 16S and other phylogenetic marker genes , or — in the case of low @-@ diversity communities — by genome reconstruction from the metagenomic dataset . Functional comparisons between metagenomes may be made by comparing sequences against reference databases such as COG or <unk> , and tabulating the abundance by category and evaluating any differences for statistical significance . This gene @-@ centric approach emphasizes the functional complement of the community as a whole rather than taxonomic groups , and shows that the functional complements are analogous under similar environmental conditions . Consequently , metadata on the environmental context of the metagenomic sample is especially important in comparative analyses , as it provides researchers with the ability to study the effect of habitat upon community structure and function . 
 Additionally , several studies have also utilized oligonucleotide usage patterns to identify the differences across diverse microbial communities . Examples of such methodologies include the dinucleotide relative abundance approach by Willner et al. and the <unk> approach of Ghosh et al . Ghosh et al . ( 2011 ) also indicated that differences in tetranucleotide usage patterns can be used to identify genes ( or metagenomic reads ) originating from specific habitats . Additionally some methods as <unk> or <unk> detect similar reads between two read sets . The similarity measure they apply on reads is based on a number of identical words of length k shared by pairs of reads . 
 A key goal in comparative metagenomics is to identify microbial group ( s ) which are responsible for conferring specific characteristics to a given environment . However , due to issues in the sequencing technologies artifacts need to be accounted for like in <unk> . Others have characterized inter @-@ microbial interactions between the resident microbial groups . A GUI @-@ based comparative metagenomic analysis application called Community @-@ Analyzer has been developed by <unk> et al. which implements a correlation @-@ based graph layout algorithm that not only facilitates a quick visualization of the differences in the analyzed microbial communities ( in terms of their taxonomic composition ) , but also provides insights into the inherent inter @-@ microbial interactions occurring therein . Notably , this layout algorithm also enables grouping of the metagenomes based on the probable inter @-@ microbial interaction patterns rather than simply comparing abundance values of various taxonomic groups . In addition , the tool implements several interactive GUI @-@ based functionalities that enable users to perform standard comparative analyses across <unk> .

 = = = Community metabolism = = = 
 In many bacterial communities , natural or engineered ( such as bioreactors ) , there is significant division of labor in metabolism ( <unk> ) , during which the waste products of some organisms are metabolites for others . In one such system , the methanogenic bioreactor , functional stability requires the presence of several <unk> species ( <unk> and <unk> ) working together in order to turn raw resources into fully metabolized waste ( methane ) . Using comparative gene studies and expression experiments with microarrays or proteomics researchers can piece together a metabolic network that goes beyond species boundaries . Such studies require detailed knowledge about which versions of which proteins are coded by which species and even by which strains of which species . Therefore , community genomic information is another fundamental tool ( with <unk> and proteomics ) in the quest to determine how metabolites are transferred and transformed by a community . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Metagenomics allows researchers to access the functional and metabolic diversity of microbial communities , but it cannot show which of these processes are active . The extraction and analysis of metagenomic mRNA ( the <unk> ) provides information on the regulation and expression profiles of complex communities . Because of the technical difficulties ( the short half @-@ life of mRNA , for example ) in the collection of environmental RNA there have been relatively few in situ <unk> studies of microbial communities to date . While originally limited to microarray technology , <unk> studies have made use of direct high @-@ throughput cDNA sequencing to provide whole @-@ genome expression and quantification of a microbial community , as first employed by <unk> et al . ( 2006 ) in their analysis of ammonia oxidation in soils . 
 = = = Viruses = = = 
 Metagenomic sequencing is particularly useful in the study of viral communities . As viruses lack a shared universal phylogenetic marker ( as 16S RNA for bacteria and archaea , and 18S RNA for eukarya ) , the only way to access the genetic diversity of the viral community from an environmental sample is through metagenomics . Viral metagenomes ( also called <unk> ) should thus provide more and more information about viral diversity and evolution . For example a metagenomic pipeline called Giant Virus Finder showed the first evidence of existence of giant viruses in a saline desert .

 Microbial communities play a key role in preserving human health , but their composition and the mechanism by which they do so remains mysterious . Metagenomic sequencing is being used to characterize the microbial communities from 15 @-@ 18 body sites from at least 250 individuals . This is part of the Human <unk> initiative with primary goals to determine if there is a core human microbiome , to understand the changes in the human microbiome that can be correlated with human health , and to develop new technological and bioinformatics tools to support these goals . 
 Another medical study as part of the <unk> ( Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract ) project consisted of 124 individuals from Denmark and Spain consisting of healthy , overweight , and irritable bowel disease patients . The study attempted to categorize the depth and phylogenetic diversity of gastrointestinal bacteria . Using Illumina GA sequence data and <unk> , a de Bruijn graph @-@ based tool specifically designed for assembly short reads , they were able to generate 6 @.@ 58 million contigs greater than 500 bp for a total <unk> length of 10 @.@ 3 Gb and a <unk> length of 2 @.@ 2 kb . 
 The study demonstrated that two bacterial divisions , <unk> and Firmicutes , constitute over 90 % of the known phylogenetic categories that dominate distal gut bacteria . Using the relative gene frequencies found within the gut these researchers identified 1 @,@ 244 metagenomic clusters that are critically important for the health of the intestinal tract . There are two types of functions in these range clusters : housekeeping and those specific to the intestine . The housekeeping gene clusters are required in all bacteria and are often major players in the main metabolic pathways including central carbon metabolism and amino acid synthesis . The gut @-@ specific functions include adhesion to host proteins and the harvesting of sugars from <unk> glycolipids . Patients with irritable bowel syndrome were shown to exhibit 25 % fewer genes and lower bacterial diversity than individuals not suffering from irritable bowel syndrome indicating that changes in patients ’ gut biome diversity may be associated with this condition . 
 While these studies highlight some potentially valuable medical applications , only 31 @-@ 48 @.@ 8 % of the reads could be aligned to 194 public human gut bacterial genomes and 7 @.@ 6 @-@ 21 @.@ 2 % to bacterial genomes available in GenBank which indicates that there is still far more research necessary to capture novel bacterial genomes . 
 = = = Biofuel = = = 
 Biofuels are fuels derived from biomass conversion , as in the conversion of cellulose contained in corn stalks , switchgrass , and other biomass into cellulosic ethanol . This process is dependent upon microbial consortia that transform the cellulose into sugars , followed by the fermentation of the sugars into ethanol . Microbes also produce a variety of sources of bioenergy including methane and hydrogen . 
 The efficient industrial @-@ scale deconstruction of biomass requires novel enzymes with higher productivity and lower cost . Metagenomic approaches to the analysis of complex microbial communities allow the targeted screening of enzymes with industrial applications in biofuel production , such as glycoside hydrolases . Furthermore , knowledge of how these microbial communities function is required to control them , and metagenomics is a key tool in their understanding . Metagenomic approaches allow comparative analyses between convergent microbial systems like biogas fermenters or insect herbivores such as the fungus garden of the leafcutter ants . 
 = = = Environmental remediation = = = 
 Metagenomics can improve strategies for monitoring the impact of pollutants on ecosystems and for cleaning up contaminated environments . Increased understanding of how microbial communities cope with pollutants improves assessments of the potential of contaminated sites to recover from pollution and increases the chances of <unk> or <unk> trials to succeed . 
 = = = Biotechnology = = = 
 Microbial communities produce a vast array of biologically active chemicals that are used in competition and communication . Many of the drugs in use today were originally uncovered in microbes ; recent progress in mining the rich genetic resource of non @-@ <unk> microbes has led to the discovery of new genes , enzymes , and natural products . The application of metagenomics has allowed the development of commodity and fine chemicals , agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals where the benefit of enzyme @-@ catalyzed chiral synthesis is increasingly recognized . 
 Two types of analysis are used in the <unk> of metagenomic data : function @-@ driven screening for an expressed trait , and sequence @-@ driven screening for DNA sequences of interest . Function @-@ driven analysis seeks to identify clones expressing a desired trait or useful activity , followed by biochemical characterization and sequence analysis . This approach is limited by availability of a suitable screen and the requirement that the desired trait be expressed in the host cell . Moreover , the low rate of discovery ( less than one per 1 @,@ 000 clones screened ) and its labor @-@ intensive nature further limit this approach . In contrast , sequence @-@ driven analysis uses conserved DNA sequences to design PCR primers to screen clones for the sequence of interest . In comparison to cloning @-@ based approaches , using a sequence @-@ only approach further reduces the amount of bench work required . The application of massively parallel sequencing also greatly increases the amount of sequence data generated , which require high @-@ throughput <unk> analysis pipelines . The sequence @-@ driven approach to screening is limited by the breadth and accuracy of gene functions present in public sequence databases . In practice , experiments make use of a combination of both functional and sequence @-@ based approaches based upon the function of interest , the complexity of the sample to be screened , and other factors . 
 = = = Agriculture = = = 
 The soils in which plants grow are inhabited by microbial communities , with one gram of soil containing around 109 @-@ 1010 microbial cells which comprise about one <unk> of sequence information . The microbial communities which inhabit soils are some of the most complex known to science , and remain poorly understood despite their economic importance . Microbial consortia perform a wide variety of ecosystem services necessary for plant growth , including fixing atmospheric nitrogen , nutrient cycling , disease suppression , and sequester iron and other metals . Functional metagenomics strategies are being used to explore the interactions between plants and microbes through cultivation @-@ independent study of these microbial communities . By allowing insights into the role of previously uncultivated or rare community members in nutrient cycling and the promotion of plant growth , metagenomic approaches can contribute to improved disease detection in crops and livestock and the adaptation of enhanced farming practices which improve crop health by harnessing the relationship between microbes and plants . 
 = = = Ecology = = = 
 Metagenomics can provide valuable insights into the functional ecology of environmental communities . Metagenomic analysis of the bacterial consortia found in the <unk> of Australian sea lions suggests that nutrient @-@ rich sea lion faeces may be an important nutrient source for coastal ecosystems . This is because the bacteria that are expelled simultaneously with the <unk> are adept at breaking down the nutrients in the faeces into a bioavailable form that can be taken up into the food chain . 
 DNA sequencing can also be used more broadly to identify species present in a body of water , debris filtered from the air , or sample of dirt . This can establish the range of invasive species and endangered species , and track seasonal populations . 
 = New York State Route 420 = 
 New York State Route 420 ( NY 420 ) is a north – south state highway in St. Lawrence County , New York , in the United States . The southern terminus of the route is at an intersection with U.S. Route 11 ( US 11 ) in the town of Stockholm . Its northern terminus is at a junction with NY 37 in the village of Massena . NY 420 passes through undeveloped regions of St. Lawrence County for most of its routing and briefly overlaps with NY 11C in the hamlet of Winthrop . 
 NY 420 was originally part of Route 32 , an unsigned legislative route created by the New York State Legislature in 1908 . The Winthrop – Massena portion of Route 32 became part of the signed NY 56 in the mid @-@ 1920s ; however , NY 56 was realigned in 1927 to follow a new alignment well to the south of Winthrop . The former routing of NY 56 between Winthrop and Massena was redesignated as NY 420 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . NY 420 was extended southward to its current terminus south of Winthrop in 1980 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 420 begins at an intersection with US 11 in the town of Stockholm . The route heads north as a two @-@ lane highway through forested areas and across both branches of the St. Regis River to the hamlet of Winthrop , the first area of significant development along the highway . Here , the two branches of the St. Regis River converge and NY 420 meets NY 11C . NY 420 turns northeastward , overlapping NY 11C for two blocks before splitting from it in the center of Winthrop . 
 The route heads northwest from Winthrop , passing through heavily forested areas of St. Lawrence County . As NY 420 passes out of Stockholm and into Norfolk , the forests surrounding the highway begin to taper off and give way to small pockets of residences and cultivated fields . The amount of homes along the route begin to increase upon intersecting Plum Hill Road , at which point NY 420 becomes lined with residences for much of its run through north Norfolk . However , the string of homes ends near the northern town line , and the highway becomes flanked by forests once more as it curves northward and enters the town of Massena . 
 In Massena , the forests along NY 420 subside slightly as it passes by industrial warehouses and residences . The route curves back to the northwest as it enters the village of Massena . Just past the village line , NY 420 crosses the St. Lawrence Subdivision , a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation . The highway continues on , curving northward to cross the Raquette River . It curves back to the northwest on the northern riverbank and passes by a mixture of homes and commercial establishments before intersecting NY 37 south of the village center . NY 420 ends here ; however , the road continues north into the heart of the village as Main Street . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1908 , the New York State Legislature created Route 32 , an unsigned legislative route extending from North Lawrence to Ogdensburg via Winthrop and Massena . When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924 , all of Route 32 west of Massena became part of NY 3 while the section east of Winthrop was incorporated into NY 2 . The Winthrop – Massena segment of Route 32 did not initially receive a designation ; however , by 1926 , it had become the northwestern @-@ most portion of NY 56 , a highway linking Brighton to Massena via Nicholville and Winthrop . In 1927 , NY 56 was realigned to proceed west from Nicholville on modern NY 11B to a new terminus in the village of Potsdam . The former routing of NY 56 between Winthrop and Massena was left unnumbered until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York when it was designated as NY 420 . 
 The initial northern terminus of NY 420 was in the center of Massena at the junction of Orvis and Main Streets , where it ended at NY 37 . In the mid @-@ 1950s , construction began on a new alignment for NY 37 around the southern edge of the village . The highway opened to traffic by 1958 ; however , NY 420 continued to extend past the bypass into Massena until the early 1960s , when it was cut back to its junction with NY 37 's new routing . The former routing of NY 420 in Massena is still state @-@ maintained as part of NY <unk> , an unsigned reference route designation for all of Main Street between NY 37 and NY 37B . 
 On September 1 , 1982 , ownership and maintenance of County Route 51 ( CR 51 ) from CR 110 north to US 11 in Winthrop was transferred from St. Lawrence County to the state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government . Also transferred to the state as part of the swap was CR 110 itself , an east – west highway extending from Stockholm Center to <unk> Corner . The segment of CR 51 given to New York became a southward extension of NY 420 , which now began at NY 11C ( former CR 110 ) and briefly overlapped US 11 in Winthrop . The alignments of US 11 and NY 11C between Stockholm Center and <unk> Corner were flipped on June 13 , 1992 .

 = Danie Mellor = 
 Danie Mellor ( born 13 April 1971 ) is an Australian artist who was the winner of the 2009 National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award . Born in Mackay , Queensland , Mellor grew up in Scotland , Australia and South Africa before undertaking tertiary studies at North Adelaide School of Art , the Australian National University ( ANU ) and Birmingham Institute of Art and Design . He then took up a post lecturing at Sydney College of the Arts . He works in different media including printmaking , drawing , painting , and sculpture . Considered a key figure in contemporary Indigenous Australian art , the dominant theme in Mellor 's art is the relationship between Indigenous and non @-@ Indigenous Australian cultures . 
 Since 2000 , Mellor 's works have been included regularly in National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award exhibitions ; in 2003 he was awarded a " highly commended " , for his print Cyathea cooperi , and in 2009 he won the principal prize , for a mixed media work From Rite to Ritual . His other major exhibitions have included the Primavera 2005 show at the Museum of Contemporary Art , Sydney , and the National Indigenous Art Triennial at the National Gallery of Australia in 2007 . In 2012 , his work was included in the National Museum of Australia 's exhibition Menagerie : Contemporary Indigenous Sculpture as well as in the second National Indigenous Art Triennial , while international recognition came in 2013 with representation in the National Gallery of Canada 's exhibition of international indigenous art . 
 = = Life = = 
 Mellor was born in Mackay , Queensland , in 1971 . His father was of American and Australian descent ; his mother had Irish , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> heritage . Mellor 's maternal great @-@ great @-@ grandmother , Eleanor Kelly , and great @-@ grandmother , May Kelly , were Indigenous Australian people from the rainforest country around Cairns . The family was peripatetic : in his first twenty years , Mellor lived in Mackay , Queensland ; Scotland ; Brisbane , Queensland ; Sutton Grange , Victoria ; Adelaide , South Australia ; and Cape Town , South Africa , as well as in the Northern Territory . Mellor went to school at Steiner Schools in South Australia and South Africa ; in high school he was taught art by his mother . Looking back at the influence of his schooling upon his art , he remarked how , despite the Eurocentric origins of Rudolf Steiner 's approach to education , " there are comparable elements and themes inherent in [ Steiner 's ] philosophical narrative that parallel an Indigenous outlook , which is holistic in the way it approaches deeper and more intuitive readings of the environment and landscape . " 
 After completing a Certificate in Art at the North Adelaide School of Art in 1991 , Mellor undertook a Bachelor of Arts with Honours at the ANU in 1992 – 1994 , and a Masters in Fine Art at Birmingham Institute of Art and Design , part of the Birmingham City University , in 1995 – 1996 . In the early 2000s , he entered a doctorate at the ANU , where he also taught print @-@ media and drawing . He completed his PhD in 2004 . As of 2013 , Mellor is a lecturer at Sydney College of the Arts , within the University of Sydney . Mellor is married to artist Joanne Kennedy . 
 = = Career = = 
 In the early 1990s , Mellor won drawing prizes at the ANU 's Canberra School of Art and the Grafton Regional Gallery in New South Wales . Through the mid @-@ 1990s , while studying in Canberra and Birmingham , he was represented in numerous student and other exhibitions , in Australia , Belgium , Japan , Korea and the United Kingdom . These included exhibitions titled Passage , at Kyoto Seika University in Japan in 1994 , and Fragile Objects at the National Library of Australia in 1996 . 
 Mellor 's works have been included in the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award on several occasions , in 2000 , 2001 , and every year from 2003 to 2010 . In 2003 , his mezzotint print Cyathea cooperi , portraying tree ferns native to the Queensland rainforest , was highly commended . Subsequent entries have included Of fragile dreams the heart which nevermore in 2005 , Untitled ( Ernie Grant in Blackman Street ) in 2006 , Exotic lies and sacred ties ( the heart that conceals , the tongue that never reveals ) in 2008 , and A Transcendent Vision ( of life , death and resurrection ) in 2010 . Reviewing the 2008 exhibition , academic Sarah Scott expressed surprise that Mellor 's 2008 piece had neither attracted an award nor been purchased for the Northern Territory 's public collection . 
 Primavera 2005 , an annual exhibition of young artists ' work held at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney , included Mellor 's work Fig 1 @-@ 100 ( This particular collection made sense ) , a mixed media composition that included specimens of Ulysses butterflies . He has had numerous other exhibitions , both individually and as part of group shows , at galleries including the Queensland Art Gallery in 2003 , the Canberra Museum and Art Gallery in 2006 , and the Indigenous Ceramic Art Awards , at Shepparton Gallery in Victoria in 2007 . 
 Mellor 's work was represented in the first National Indigenous Art Triennial in 2007 , with the elaborate ( and elaborately named ) sculpture The contrivance of a vintage Wonderland ( A magnificent flight of curious fancy for science buffs , a china ark of seductive whimsy , a divinely ordered special attraction , upheld in <unk> ) featuring a diorama that included sculpted kangaroos made with blue and white crockery fragments ( evoking Spode bone china ) , real kangaroo skin ( used for the ears and paws ) , and synthetic eyeballs ; stuffed birds sat in a life @-@ sized mixed @-@ media tree overhead . The work featured in media reports of the exhibition , including by The Adelaide Advertiser , The Canberra Times , The West Australian and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation . 
 Since graduating , Mellor has won several awards , including the Canberra Critic 's Choice Award in 2006 , and the $ 15 @,@ 000 John Tallis National Works on Paper <unk> Award in 2008 . The following year , he won the Victorian Indigenous Ceramic Art Award , held at Shepparton Art Gallery in Shepparton , Victoria . In August 2009 , Mellor won the AU $ 40 @,@ 000 National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award , for his mixed media work From Rite to Ritual . It was only the third time in the award 's 26 years that an urban Aboriginal artist had been the winner . Earlier that year his solo show at Brisbane 's Jan Murphy Gallery had sold out . Also in that year , Mellor 's work was featured alongside that of Patricia <unk> and Cherry Hood in the Newcastle Region Art Gallery 's show Animal Attraction . Though Mellor has not had a painting hung in the Archibald Prize , he was the subject of Paul Ryan 's portrait that was a 2010 finalist in that competition . In 2012 , his work was included in the National Museum of Australia 's exhibition Menagerie : Contemporary Indigenous Sculpture , and in the second National Indigenous Art Triennial . He was also selected for inclusion in that year 's Blake Prize , with his work <unk> <unk> . Mellor received international recognition in 2013 , when he was included in <unk> , the National Gallery of Canada 's " most ambitious contemporary art exhibition in its history " . 
 Among the national collections containing Mellor 's work are the National Gallery of Australia , which owns his prize @-@ winning From Rite to Ritual , and the Parliament House Art Collection . Most other major Australian art collections have holdings , including the state gallery of his birth state , Queensland , and the main public gallery of the city where he completed much of his tertiary study , the Canberra Museum and Gallery . Other state and territory galleries in which he is represented include the Art Gallery of South Australia , the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory and the National Gallery of Victoria . Public regional galleries that have collected Mellor 's creations include Newcastle Regional Art Gallery in New South Wales , and Warrnambool Art Gallery in Victoria . He is also represented in the Australian government 's collection , Artbank , as well as in large , private collections such as the Kerry Stokes . 
 In the 2010s , Mellor became involved in administrative and leadership roles in the arts community . In 2010 , Mellor became a member of the Visual Arts Board of the Australia Council for the Arts . In 2011 , Mellor was not an entrant in the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award , as he instead became one of its judges . Appointed to the Visual Arts Board for a further term , Mellor in 2013 became its Chair . At the same time , Mellor continued to exhibit works . In 2014 , a survey of his works opened at the University of Queensland Art Museum , and was scheduled to travel to the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory later in the year . The exhibition was favourably reviewed in theguardian.com , with art critic <unk> Wolff drawing attention to Mellor 's newest sculpture , Anima , which she said " marks a dramatic change " for the artist , bearing " no resemblance to Mellor ’ s more glamorous output " . His work featured as part of the Edinburgh International Festival , with a show titled Primordial : <unk> displayed at the National Museum of Scotland . 
 = = Technique and themes = = 
 Mellor 's extensive scholarly art education has led to his art having a strong theoretical base . In interviews he has acknowledged the influence of diverse artists , including Indigenous painter Rover Thomas , Australian Sulman Prize winner Tim <unk> , Romantic painters including Germany 's Caspar David Friedrich , and contemporary German artists Joseph Beuys , and Beuys ' student Anselm Kiefer . He has harnessed a wide range of media during his career , including printmaking , drawing , painting and sculpture utilising wood , glass , steel and ceramics , as well as a range of more unorthodox materials , as his 2007 Indigenous Art Triennial entry demonstrated . Reflecting on that sculpture , <unk> Magazine 's reviewer , Daniel Thomas , remarked on how the work signified " how colonisers always get things wrong ; how Europeans looking for China , and its fine porcelain manufactures , stumbled instead upon the land of the kangaroo , and traded and planted ideas of racial and cultural superiority " . 
 When Sarah Scott considered the 2008 work Exotic Lies and Sacred Ties , which , like From Rite to Ritual , drew on evocations of Spode china , she highlighted its exploration of the history of cross @-@ cultural relations . Noting the landscape that forms the central element of the painting , she observed : 
 The stuffed parrot and upside @-@ down cockatoo that hang above the landscape recall the bizarre renditions of these birds produced by European artists following the eighteenth century European voyages of discovery to Australia . In front of the ' landscape ' are two mosaic kangaroo ' messengers . ' One kangaroo points to the painting . Another covers his ears in a ' hear no evil ' gesture , graphically signifying how under the black armband view of history ... , the oral history accounts of Indigenous people have been largely ignored . This work recalls the museum dioramas in which Aboriginal people , who until 1967 were classified under the Flora and Fauna act , appeared amongst exotic taxidermy objects . 
 From Rite to Ritual examined relationships between Indigenous and settler cultures , including differences in spiritual practices . Mellor , in an artist 's statement for the awards , described the work as showing " what is a moment of contact , a conversation and interaction between two cultures ; it speaks of the challenges of settlement , and the differences in spiritual enactment and belief " . Commenting on the work , the judges of the prize remarked that the " surprising scale and layering of imagery , with its understated political and historical references " made the work " outstanding " and of " great complexity and grace " . Art writer Nicolas Rothwell described the work as drawing a parallel " between Aboriginal initiation rituals and the ceremonies inside a Masonic lodge . " 
 Mellor 's earlier works examined the relationships between cultures , including in his mezzotint prints in which he juxtaposed " images of native and introduced flora and fauna — for example , a kangaroo with a bull — to symbolise two different peoples and cultures " . These issues were also addressed in his painting for the exhibition Native Titled Now , shown in South Australia in 1996 . Mellor 's interest in cultural interactions extends beyond the making of his art . In a panel discussion on Indigenous art education , Mellor emphasised that , in teaching Indigenous art within visual arts , it was important to be aware of both Aboriginal and settler history , " so you can talk about their interaction and the whole set of issues that arise from those two things being parallel " . Mellor 's emphasis on past interactions between cultures led gallerist and critic Michael Reid to consider that Mellor 's works had earned him " an important place in the visual narrative of Australian history " . 
 For Mellor , Indigenous identity is a theme highlighted both in his work and ( not necessarily by his own choice ) in public life . As a fair @-@ skinned man with blue eyes and caucasian features , his appearance has occasionally raised questions of " authenticity " . Mellor found himself the target of columnist Andrew Bolt , who took issue with Mellor entering and winning the 2009 National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award . Bolt wrote " This white university lecturer , with his nice Canberra studio , has by winning pushed aside real draw @-@ in @-@ the @-@ dirt Aboriginal artists such as Dorothy Napangardi , <unk> Napanangka Gibson and <unk> Napanangka , who had also entered and could really have used that cash and recognition . " Commentator Ellie Savage , criticising Bolt , wondered why someone who " neither draws in the dirt nor lives in it " should therefore have " no right to enter competitions for Indigenous artists " . Bolt two years later lost a case brought by nine Indigenous Australians — not including Mellor — for racial discrimination over articles that criticised fair @-@ skinned Indigenous people , including the post that had lambasted Mellor . Art writer Maurice O <unk> , reviewing the 2009 Award , noted the Bolt controversy , but pointed out that Mellor , while in early works acknowledging his own Indigenous heritage , is not concerned with the definition of <unk> , but with historical interaction between cultures and the re @-@ imagining of history . 
 = Louvre = 
 The Louvre or the Louvre Museum ( French : Musée du Louvre , pronounced : [ <unk> dy <unk> ] ) ( French ) is the world 's largest museum and a historic monument in Paris , France . A central landmark of the city , it is located on the Right Bank of the Seine in the 1st arrondissement ( ward ) . Nearly 35 @,@ 000 objects from prehistory to the 21st century are exhibited over an area of 60 @,@ 600 square metres ( 652 @,@ 300 square feet ) . The Louvre is the world 's second most visited museum after the Palace Museum in China , receiving more than 9 @.@ 26 million visitors in 2014 . 
 The museum is housed in the Louvre Palace , originally built as a fortress in the late 12th century under Philip II . Remnants of the fortress are visible in the basement of the museum . The building was extended many times to form the present Louvre Palace . In 1682 , Louis XIV chose the Palace of Versailles for his household , leaving the Louvre primarily as a place to display the royal collection , including , from 1692 , a collection of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture . In 1692 , the building was occupied by the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres and the Académie Royale de <unk> et de Sculpture , which in 1699 held the first of a series of salons . The Académie remained at the Louvre for 100 years . During the French Revolution , the National Assembly decreed that the Louvre should be used as a museum to display the nation 's masterpieces . 
 The museum opened on 10 August 1793 with an exhibition of 537 paintings , the majority of the works being royal and confiscated church property . Because of structural problems with the building , the museum was closed in 1796 until 1801 . The collection was increased under Napoleon and the museum renamed the Musée Napoléon , but after Napoleon 's abdication many works seized by his armies were returned to their original owners . The collection was further increased during the reigns of Louis XVIII and Charles X , and during the Second French Empire the museum gained 20 @,@ 000 pieces . Holdings have grown steadily through donations and bequests since the Third Republic . The collection is divided among eight curatorial departments : Egyptian Antiquities ; Near Eastern Antiquities ; Greek , Etruscan and Roman Antiquities ; Islamic Art ; Sculpture ; Decorative Arts ; Paintings ; Prints and Drawings .

 The Louvre Palace , which houses the museum , was begun as a fortress by Philip II in the 12th century , with remnants of this building still visible in the crypt . Whether this was the first building on that spot is not known ; it is possible that Philip modified an existing tower . According to the authoritative Grand Larousse encyclopédique , it derives from an association with wolf hunting den ( via Latin : lupus , lower Empire : lupara ) . In the 7th century , St. Fare , an abbess in Meaux , left part of her " Villa called <unk> situated in the region of Paris " to a monastery . ; this territory probably did not correspond exactly to the modern site , however . 
 The Louvre Palace was altered frequently throughout the Middle Ages . In the 14th century , Charles V converted the building into a residence and in 1546 , Francis I renovated the site in French Renaissance style . Francis acquired what would become the nucleus of the Louvre 's holdings , his acquisitions including Leonardo da Vinci 's Mona Lisa . After Louis XIV chose Versailles as his residence in 1682 , constructions slowed ; however , the move permitted the Louvre to be used as a residence for artists . 
 By the mid @-@ 18th century there was an increasing number of proposals to create a public gallery , with the art critic La Font de Saint @-@ <unk> publishing , in 1747 , a call for a display of the royal collection . On 14 October 1750 , Louis XV agreed and sanctioned a display of 96 pieces from the royal collection , mounted in the Galerie royale de peinture of the Luxembourg Palace . A hall was opened by Le <unk> de <unk> and the Marquis de Marigny for public viewing of the Tableaux du Roy on Wednesdays and Saturdays , and contained Andrea del Sarto 's Charity and works by Raphael ; Titian ; Veronese ; Rembrandt ; Poussin or Van Dyck , until its closing in 1780 as a result of the gift of the palace to the Count of Provence ( the future king , Louis XVIII ) by the king in 1778 . Under Louis XVI , the royal museum idea became policy . The comte d <unk> broadened the collection and in 1776 proposed conversion of the Grande Galerie of the Louvre – which contained maps – into the " French Museum " . Many proposals were offered for the Louvre 's renovation into a museum ; however , none was agreed on . Hence the museum remained incomplete until the French Revolution . 
 = = = = French Revolution = = = = 
 During the French Revolution the Louvre was transformed into a public museum . In May 1791 , the Assembly declared that the Louvre would be " a place for bringing together monuments of all the sciences and arts " . On 10 August 1792 , Louis XVI was imprisoned and the royal collection in the Louvre became national property . Because of fear of vandalism or theft , on 19 August , the National Assembly pronounced the museum 's preparation as urgent . In October , a committee to " preserve the national memory " began assembling the collection for display . 
 = = = = = Opening = = = = = 
 The museum opened on 10 August 1793 , the first anniversary of the monarchy 's demise . The public was given free access on three days per week , which was " perceived as a major accomplishment and was generally appreciated " . The collection showcased 537 paintings and 184 objects of art . Three quarters were derived from the royal collections , the remainder from confiscated émigrés and Church property ( biens nationaux ) . To expand and organize the collection , the Republic dedicated 100 @,@ 000 livres per year . In 1794 , France 's revolutionary armies began bringing pieces from Northern Europe , augmented after the Treaty of Tolentino ( 1797 ) by works from the Vatican , such as Laocoön and His Sons and the Apollo Belvedere , to establish the Louvre as a museum and as a " sign of popular sovereignty " . 
 The early days were hectic ; privileged artists continued to live in residence , and the unlabelled paintings hung " frame to frame from floor to ceiling " . The structure itself closed in May 1796 due to structural deficiencies . It reopened on 14 July 1801 , arranged chronologically and with new lighting and columns . 
 = = = = Napoleon = = = = 
 Under Napoleon I , a northern wing paralleling the Grande Galerie was begun , and the collection grew through successful military campaigns . Following the Egyptian campaign of 1798 – 1801 , Napoléon appointed the museum 's first director , Dominique Vivant Denon . In tribute , the museum was renamed the " Musée Napoléon " in 1803 , and acquisitions were made of Spanish , Austrian , Dutch , and Italian works , either as spoils or through treaties such as the Treaty of Tolentino . At the end of Napoleon 's First Italian Campaign in 1797 , the Treaty of Campo Formio was signed with Count Philipp von <unk> of the Austrian Monarchy . This treaty not only marked the completion of Napoleon 's conquest of Italy , but also the end of the first phases of the French Revolutionary Wars . Under this treaty , Italian cities were required to contribute pieces of art and patrimony to take part in Napoleon 's " parades of booty " through Paris before being put into the Louvre Museum . One of the most famous pieces taken under this program was the Horses of Saint Mark . The four antique bronze horses , which had adorned the basilica of San Marco in Venice after the sack of Constantinople in 1204 , were brought to Paris to reside atop Napoleon 's Arc du Carrousel in Paris in 1797 . 
 Several churches and palaces , including Saint Mark 's Basilica , were looted by the French , which outraged the Italians and their artistic and cultural sensibilities . In 1797 , the Treaty of Tolentino was signed by Napoleon , and two statues , the Nile and Tiber , were taken to Paris . These statues had previously been in the Vatican , and both were housed in the Louvre until 1815 . After the defeat of Napoleon , the Nile was returned to Italy . However , the Tiber remained in the Louvre Museum and can be seen in the collections today . 
 The Italian Peninsula was not the only region from which Napoleon took art . Under the Directory government of the 1790s , Napoleon ( then a General ) led an expedition to Egypt . The campaign was an expansionist effort on the part of the government , but the Directory had another goal to make Paris the center of art , science , and culture . The Directory wanted France to assume responsibility for liberating the works of art they deemed in danger in order to protect and nationalize the heritage and culture of their subjects . As a result , there were teams of artists and scientists who accompanied the armies into battle equipped with lists of paintings , sculptures , and other pieces of patrimony that would be collected , crated , and shipped back to France . 
 Dominique Vivant Denon was Napoleon 's art advisor , and accompanied him on the expedition to Egypt . Through his initiative , the Valley of the Kings in Egypt was discovered and studied extensively . As a result , he was later installed by Napoleon as the director of Musée Napoléon , formerly the Louvre , cementing the status of the museum as a center for global patrimony and storehouse for cultural heritage . 
 One of the most important discoveries made during Napoleon 's campaign in Egypt was the Rosetta Stone . It was discovered in 1799 , and eventually led to the ability to decipher ancient hieroglyphs . Although the Rosetta Stone was discovered by the French , it actually never made it to the Louvre Museum . It was seized by British Forces following the defeat of Napoleon in Egypt and the subsequent signing of the Treaty of Alexandria in 1801 . It is now on display at the British Museum . 
 After the French defeat at Waterloo , the works ' former owners sought their return . The Louvre 's administrators were loath to comply and hid many works in their private collections . In response , foreign states sent emissaries to London to seek help , and many pieces were returned , even some that had been restored by the Louvre . In 1815 Louis XVIII finally concluded agreements with the Austrian government for the keeping of pieces such as Veronese 's Wedding at Cana which was exchanged for a large Le Brun or the repurchase of the Albani collection . 
 = = = = Restoration and Second Empire = = = = 
 During the Restoration ( 1814 – 30 ) , Louis XVIII and Charles X between them added 135 pieces at a cost of 720 @,@ 000 francs and created the department of Egyptian antiquities curated by Champollion , increased by more than 7 @,@ 000 works with the acquisition of antiquities in the Edme @-@ Antoine Durand , the Egyptian collection of Henry Salt or the second collection former by Bernardino Drovetti . This was less than the amount given for rehabilitation of Versailles , and the Louvre suffered relative to the rest of Paris . After the creation of the French Second Republic in 1848 , the new government allocated two million francs for repair work and ordered the completion of the Galerie d 'Apollon , the Salon Carré , and the Grande <unk> . In 1861 , Louis @-@ Napoléon Bonaparte bought 11 @,@ 835 artworks including 641 paintings , Greek gold and other antiquities of the Campana collection . During the Second French Empire , between 1852 and 1870 , the French economy grew ; by 1870 the museum had added 20 @,@ 000 new pieces to its collections , and the Pavillon de Flore and the Grande <unk> were remodelled under architects Louis Visconti and Hector Lefuel . 
 = = = = Third Republic and World Wars = = = = 
 During the Third Republic ( 1870 – 1940 ) the Louvre acquired new pieces mainly via donations and gifts . The Société des Amis du Louvre donated the Pietà of Villeneuve @-@ lès @-@ Avignon , and in 1863 an expedition uncovered the sculpture Winged Victory of Samothrace in the Aegean Sea . This piece , though heavily damaged , has been prominently displayed since 1884 . The 583 @-@ item Collection La Caze donated in 1869 , included works by Chardin ; <unk> ; Rembrandt – such as Bathsheba at Her Bath – and Gilles by Watteau . 
 Museum expansion slowed after World War I , and the collection did not acquire many significant new works ; exceptions were Georges de La Tour 's Saint Thomas and Baron Edmond de Rothschild 's ( 1845 – 1934 ) 1935 donation of 4 @,@ 000 engravings , 3 @,@ 000 drawings , and 500 illustrated books . During World War II the museum removed most of the art and hid valuable pieces . When Germany occupied the Sudetenland , many important artworks such as the Mona Lisa were temporarily moved to the Château de Chambord . When war was formally declared a year later , most of the museum 's paintings were sent there as well . Select sculptures such as Winged Victory of Samothrace and the Venus de Milo were sent to the Château de <unk> . On 27 August 1939 , after two days of packing , truck convoys began to leave Paris . By 28 December , the museum was cleared of most works , except those that were too heavy and " unimportant paintings [ that ] were left in the basement " . In early 1945 , after the liberation of France , art began returning to the Louvre . 
 = = = = Grand Louvre Pyramids = = = = 
 By 1874 , the Louvre Palace had achieved its present form of an almost rectangular structure with the Sully Wing to the east containing the square Cour Carrée and the oldest parts of the Louvre ; and two wings which wrap the Cour Napoléon , the Richelieu Wing to the north and the Denon Wing , which borders the Seine to the south . In 1983 , French President François Mitterrand proposed , as one of his Grands <unk> , the Grand Louvre plan to renovate the building and relocate the Finance Ministry , allowing displays throughout the building . Architect I. M. Pei was awarded the project and proposed a glass pyramid to stand over a new entrance in the main court , the Cour Napoléon . The pyramid and its underground lobby were inaugurated on 15 October 1988 ; the pyramid was completed in 1989 . The second phase of the Grand Louvre plan , La Pyramide <unk> ( The Inverted Pyramid ) , was completed in 1993 . As of 2002 , attendance had doubled since completion . 
 = = = 21st century = = = 
 The Musée du Louvre contains more than 380 @,@ 000 objects and displays 35 @,@ 000 works of art in eight curatorial departments with more than 60 @,@ 600 square metres ( 652 @,@ 000 sq ft ) dedicated to the permanent collection . The Louvre exhibits sculptures , objets d 'art , paintings , drawings , and archaeological finds . It is the world 's second most visited museum , averaging 15 @,@ 000 visitors per day , 65 percent of whom are foreign tourists . 
 After architects Mario Bellini and Rudy <unk> had won an international competition to create its new galleries for Islamic art , the new 3 @,@ 000 sq m pavilion eventually opened in 2012 , consisting of ground- and lower @-@ ground @-@ level interior spaces topped by a golden , undulating roof ( fashioned from almost 9 @,@ 000 steel tubes that form an interior web ) that seems to float within the neo @-@ Classical Visconti Courtyard in the middle of the Louvre 's south wing . The galleries , which the museum had initially hoped to open by 2009 , represent the first major architectural intervention at the Louvre since the addition of I.M. Pei 's glass pyramid in 1989 . 
 On 5 February 2015 about one hundred archaeologists , protesting against commercial private involvement to protect France 's heritage , blocked Louvre 's ticket desks to facilitate free access to the museum . At least one announcement reading " Free entrance offered by the archeologists " has been attached to the ticket desk and a number of people visited the museum free of charge . 
 The Louvre is owned by the French government ; however , since the 1990s it has become more independent . Since 2003 , the museum has been required to generate funds for projects . By 2006 , government funds had dipped from 75 percent of the total budget to 62 percent . Every year , the Louvre now raises as much as it gets from the state , about € 122 million . The government pays for operating costs ( salaries , safety and maintenance ) , while the rest – new wings , refurbishments , acquisitions – is up to the museum to finance . A further € 3 million to € 5 million a year is raised by the Louvre from exhibitions that it curates for other museums , while the host museum keeps the ticket money . As the Louvre became a point of interest in the book The Da Vinci Code and the 2006 film based on the book , the museum earned $ 2 @.@ 5 million by allowing filming in its galleries . In 2008 , the French government provided $ 180 million of the Louvre 's yearly $ 350 million budget ; the remainder came from private contributions and ticket sales . 
 The Louvre employs a staff of 2 @,@ 000 led by Director Jean @-@ Luc Martinez , who reports to the French Ministry of Culture and Communications . Martinez replaced Henri Loyrette in April 2013 . Under Loyrette , who replaced Pierre Rosenberg in 2001 , the Louvre has undergone policy changes that allow it to lend and borrow more works than before . In 2006 , it loaned 1 @,@ 300 works , which enabled it to borrow more foreign works . From 2006 to 2009 , the Louvre lent artwork to the High Museum of Art in Atlanta , Georgia , and received a $ 6 @.@ 9 million payment to be used for renovations . 
 In 2012 , the Louvre and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco announced a five @-@ year collaboration on exhibitions , publications , art conservation and educational programming . The € 98 @.@ 5 million expansion of the Islamic Art galleries in 2012 received state funding of € 31 million , as well as € 17 million from the Alwaleed Bin Talal Foundation founded by the eponymous Saudi prince . The republic of Azerbaijan , the Emir of Kuwait , the Sultan of Oman and King Mohammed VI of Morocco donated in total € 26 million . In addition , the opening of the Louvre Abu Dhabi is supposed to provide € 400 million over the course of 30 years for its use of the museum 's prestigious brand . Loyrette has tried to improve weak parts of the collection through income generated from loans of art and by guaranteeing that " 20 % of admissions receipts will be taken annually for acquisitions " . He has more administrative independence for the museum and achieved 90 percent of galleries to be open daily , as opposed to 80 percent previously . He oversaw the creation of extended hours and free admission on Friday nights and an increase in the acquisition budget to $ 36 million from $ 4 @.@ 5 million .

 In 2004 , French officials decided to build a satellite museum on the site of an abandoned coal pit in the former mining town of Lens to relieve the crowded Paris Louvre , increase total museum visits , and improve the industrial north 's economy . Six cities were considered for the project : Amiens , Arras , Boulogne @-@ sur @-@ Mer , Calais , Lens , and Valenciennes . In 2004 , French Prime Minister Jean @-@ Pierre Raffarin chose Lens to be the site of the new building , called Le Louvre @-@ Lens . Japanese architects <unk> were selected to design the Lens project in 2005 . Museum officials predicted that the new building , capable of receiving about 600 works of art , would attract up to 500 @,@ 000 visitors a year when it opened in 2012 .

 In March 2007 , the Louvre announced that a Louvre museum would be completed by 2016 in Abu Dhabi . A 30 @-@ year agreement , signed by French Culture Minister Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres and Sheik Sultan bin Tahnoon Al Nahyan , will establish the museum on Saadiyat Island in Abu Dhabi in exchange for € 832 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ( US $ 1 @.@ 3 billion ) . The Louvre Abu Dhabi , designed by the French architect Jean Nouvel and the engineering firm of Buro Happold , will occupy 24 @,@ 000 square metres ( 260 @,@ 000 sq ft ) and will be covered by a roof shaped like a flying saucer . France agreed to rotate between 200 and 300 artworks during a 10 @-@ year period ; to provide management expertise ; and to provide four temporary exhibitions a year for 15 years . The art will come from multiple museums , including the Louvre , the Georges Pompidou Centre , the Musée d 'Orsay , Versailles , the Musée <unk> , the Musée Rodin , and the Musée du quai Branly . 
 = = = = Conservation = = = = 
 In 2009 , Minister of Culture Frédéric Mitterrand approved a plan that would have created a storage facility 30 km northwest of Paris to hold objects from the Louvre and two other national museums in Paris 's flood zone , the Musée du Quai Branly and the Musée d 'Orsay ; the plan was later scrapped . In 2013 , his successor Aurélie <unk> announced that the Louvre would move more than 250 @,@ 000 works of art held in a 20 @,@ 000 square metres ( 220 @,@ 000 sq ft ) basement storage area in Liévin ; the cost of the project , estimated at € 60 million , will be split between the region ( 49 % ) and the Louvre ( 51 % ) . The Louvre will be the sole owner and manager of the store . In July 2015 , a team led by British firm Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners was selected to design the complex , which will have light @-@ filled work spaces under one vast , green roof . 
 = = = Controversial acquisitions = = = 
 The Louvre is involved in controversies that surround cultural property seized under Napoleon I , as well as during World War II by the Nazis . During Nazi occupation , thousands of artworks were stolen . But after the war , 61 @,@ 233 articles of more than 150 @,@ 000 seized artworks returned to France and were assigned to the Louvre 's Office des Biens <unk> . In 1949 , it entrusted 2 @,@ 130 unclaimed pieces ( including 1 @,@ 001 paintings ) to the Direction des Musées de France in order to keep them under appropriate conditions of conservation until their restitution and meanwhile classified them as <unk> ( <unk> Nationaux <unk> or , in English , the National Museums of Recovered Artwork ) . Some 10 % to 35 % of the pieces are believed to come from Jewish <unk> and until the identification of their rightful owners , which declined at the end of the 1960s , they are registered indefinitely on separate inventories from the museum 's collections . 
 They were exhibited in 1946 and shown all together to the public during four years ( 1950 – 1954 ) in order to allow rightful claimants to identify their properties , then stored or displayed , according to their interest , in several French museums including the Louvre . From 1951 to 1965 , about 37 pieces were <unk> . Since November 1996 , the partly illustrated catalogue of 1947 – 1949 has been accessible online and completed . In 1997 , Prime Minister Alain <unk> initiated the <unk> Commission , headed by Jean <unk> , to investigate the matter and according to the government , the Louvre is in charge of 678 pieces of artwork still unclaimed by their rightful owners . During the late 1990s , the comparison of the American war archives , which had not been done before , with the French and German ones as well as two court cases which finally settled some of the heirs ' rights ( Gentili di Giuseppe and Rosenberg families ) allowed more accurate investigations . Since 1996 , the <unk> , according sometimes to less formal criteria , concerned 47 more pieces ( 26 paintings , with 6 from the Louvre including a then displayed Tiepolo ) , until the last claims of French owners and their heirs ended again in 2006 . 
 According to Serge <unk> , since the now complete and constant publicity which the artworks got in 1996 , the majority of the French Jewish community is nevertheless in favour of the return to the normal French civil rule of prescription acquisitive of any unclaimed good after another long period of time and consequently to their ultimate integration into the common French heritage instead of their transfer to foreign institutions like during World War II . 
 In June 2015 , the Louvre had been accused of discriminating against Israeli students . 
 Napoleon 's campaigns acquired Italian pieces by treaties , as war reparations , and Northern European pieces as spoils as well as some antiquities excavated in Egypt , though the vast majority of the latter were seized as war reparations by the British army and are now part of collections of the British Museum . On the other hand , the Dendera zodiac is , like the Rosetta stone , claimed by Egypt even though it was acquired in 1821 , before the Egyptian Anti @-@ export legislation of 1835 . The Louvre administration has thus argued in favor of retaining this item despite requests by Egypt for its return . The museum participates too in arbitration sessions held via UNESCO 's Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to Its Countries of Origin . The museum consequently returned in 2009 five Egyptian fragments of frescoes ( 30 cm x 15 cm each ) whose existence of the tomb of origin had only been brought to the authorities attention in 2008 , eight to five years after their good @-@ faith acquisition by the museum from two private collections and after the necessary respect of the procedure of <unk> from French public collections before the Commission scientifique nationale des collections des <unk> de France . 
 = = Collections = = 
 The Musée du Louvre contains more than 380 @,@ 000 objects and displays 35 @,@ 000 works of art in eight curatorial departments . 
 = = = Egyptian antiquities = = = 
 The department , comprising over 50 @,@ 000 pieces , includes artifacts from the Nile civilizations which date from 4 @,@ 000 BC to the 4th century AD . The collection , among the world 's largest , overviews Egyptian life spanning Ancient Egypt , the Middle Kingdom , the New Kingdom , Coptic art , and the Roman , Ptolemaic , and Byzantine periods . The department 's origins lie in the royal collection , but it was augmented by Napoleon 's 1798 expeditionary trip with Dominique Vivant , the future director of the Louvre . After Jean @-@ François Champollion translated the Rosetta Stone , Charles X decreed that an Egyptian Antiquities department be created . Champollion advised the purchase of three collections , formed by Edmé @-@ Antoine Durand , Henry Salt and Bernardino <unk> ; these additions added 7 @,@ 000 works . Growth continued via acquisitions by Auguste Mariette , founder of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo . Mariette , after excavations at Memphis , sent back crates of archaeological finds including The Seated Scribe . 
 Guarded by the Large Sphinx ( c . 2000 BC ) , the collection is housed in more than 20 rooms . Holdings include art , papyrus scrolls , mummies , tools , clothing , jewelry , games , musical instruments , and weapons . Pieces from the ancient period include the Gebel el @-@ Arak Knife from 3400 BC , The Seated Scribe , and the Head of King Djedefre . Middle Kingdom art , " known for its gold work and statues " , moved from realism to idealization ; this is exemplified by the schist statue of <unk> and the wooden Offering Bearer . The New Kingdom and Coptic Egyptian sections are deep , but the statue of the goddess Nephthys and the limestone depiction of the goddess Hathor demonstrate New Kingdom sentiment and wealth . 
 = = = Near Eastern antiquities = = = 
 Near Eastern antiquities , the second newest department , dates from 1881 and presents an overview of early Near Eastern civilization and " first settlements " , before the arrival of Islam . The department is divided into three geographic areas : the Levant , Mesopotamia ( Iraq ) , and Persia ( Iran ) . The collection 's development corresponds to archaeological work such as Paul @-@ Émile Botta 's 1843 expedition to <unk> and the discovery of Sargon II 's palace . These finds formed the basis of the Assyrian museum , the precursor to today 's department . 
 The museum contains exhibits from Sumer and the city of Akkad , with monuments such as the Prince of Lagash 's Stele of the Vultures from 2450 BC and the stele erected by Naram @-@ Sin , King of Akkad , to celebrate a victory over barbarians in the Zagros Mountains . The 2 @.@ 25 @-@ metre ( 7 @.@ 38 ft ) Code of Hammurabi , discovered in 1901 , displays Babylonian Laws prominently , so that no man could plead their ignorance . The 18th @-@ century BC mural of the Investiture of <unk> and the 25th @-@ century BC Statue of <unk> @-@ Il found in the ancient city @-@ state of Mari are also on display at the museum . 
 The Persian portion of Louvre contains work from the archaic period , like the Funerary Head and the Persian Archers of Darius I. This section also contains rare objects from Persepolis which were also lent to the British Museum for its Ancient Persia exhibition in 2005 . 
 = = = Greek , Etruscan , and Roman = = = 
 The Greek , Etruscan , and Roman department displays pieces from the Mediterranean Basin dating from the Neolithic to the 6th century . The collection spans from the Cycladic period to the decline of the Roman Empire . This department is one of the museum 's oldest ; it began with appropriated royal art , some of which was acquired under Francis I. Initially , the collection focused on marble sculptures , such as the Venus de Milo . Works such as the Apollo Belvedere arrived during the Napoleonic Wars , but these pieces were returned after Napoleon I 's fall in 1815 . In the 19th century , the Louvre acquired works including vases from the Durand collection , bronzes such as the Borghese Vase from the Bibliothèque nationale . 
 The archaic is demonstrated by jewellery and pieces such as the limestone Lady of Auxerre , from 640 BC ; and the cylindrical Hera of Samos , circa 570 – 560 BC . After the 4th century BC , focus on the human form increased , exemplified by the Borghese Gladiator . The Louvre holds masterpieces from the Hellenistic era , including The Winged Victory of Samothrace ( 190 BC ) and the Venus de Milo , symbolic of classical art . The long Galerie Campana displays an outstanding collection of more than one thousand Greek potteries . In the galleries paralleling the Seine , much of the museum 's Roman sculpture is displayed . The Roman portraiture is representative of that genre ; examples include the portraits of Agrippa and Annius Verus ; among the bronzes is the Greek Apollo of Piombino . 
 = = = Islamic art = = = 
 The Islamic art collection , the museum 's newest , spans " thirteen centuries and three continents " . These exhibits , comprising ceramics , glass , metalware , wood , ivory , carpet , textiles , and miniatures , include more than 5 @,@ 000 works and 1 @,@ 000 shards . Originally part of the decorative arts department , the holdings became separate in 2003 . Among the works are the <unk> d 'al @-@ <unk> , a 10th century ivory box from Andalusia ; the Baptistery of Saint @-@ Louis , an engraved brass basin from the 13th or 14th century Mamluk period ; and the 10th century Shroud of Saint @-@ Josse from Iran . The collection contains three pages of the Shahnameh , an epic book of poems by Ferdowsi in Persian , and a Syrian metalwork named the Barberini Vase . 
 = = = Sculpture = = = 
 The sculpture department comprises work created before 1850 that does not belong in the Etruscan , Greek , and Roman department . The Louvre has been a repository of sculpted material since its time as a palace ; however , only ancient architecture was displayed until 1824 , except for Michelangelo 's Dying Slave and Rebellious Slave . Initially the collection included only 100 pieces , the rest of the royal sculpture collection being at Versailles . It remained small until 1847 , when Léon Laborde was given control of the department . Laborde developed the medieval section and purchased the first such statues and sculptures in the collection , King <unk> and <unk> door , respectively . The collection was part of the Department of Antiquities but was given autonomy in 1871 under Louis <unk> , a director who organized a wider representation of French works . In 1986 , all post @-@ 1850 works were relocated to the new Musée d 'Orsay . The Grand Louvre project separated the department into two exhibition spaces ; the French collection is displayed in the Richelieu wing , and foreign works in the Denon wing . 
 The collection 's overview of French sculpture contains Romanesque works such as the 11th @-@ century Daniel in the Lions ' Den and the 12th @-@ century Virgin of Auvergne . In the 16th century , Renaissance influence caused French sculpture to become more restrained , as seen in Jean Goujon 's bas @-@ reliefs , and Germain Pilon 's Descent from the Cross and Resurrection of Christ . The 17th and 18th centuries are represented by Gian Lorenzo Bernini 's 1640 – 1 Bust of Cardinal Richelieu , Étienne Maurice Falconet 's Woman Bathing and Amour <unk> , and François <unk> 's obelisks . Neoclassical works includes Antonio Canova 's Psyche Revived by Cupid 's Kiss ( 1787 ) . The 18th and 19th centuries are represented by the French sculptor Alfred Barye . 
 = = = Decorative arts = = = 
 The <unk> d 'art collection spans the time from the Middle Ages to the mid @-@ 19th century . The department began as a subset of the sculpture department , based on royal property and the transfer of work from the <unk> Saint @-@ Denis , the burial ground of French monarchs that held the Coronation Sword of the Kings of France . Among the budding collection 's most prized works were <unk> dure vases and bronzes . The Durand collection 's 1825 acquisition added " ceramics , enamels , and stained glass " , and 800 pieces were given by Pierre <unk> . The onset of Romanticism rekindled interest in Renaissance and Medieval artwork , and the <unk> donation expanded the department with 1 @,@ 500 middle @-@ age and <unk> works . In 1862 , the Campana collection added gold jewelry and <unk> , mainly from the 15th and 16th centuries . 
 The works are displayed on the Richelieu Wing 's first floor and in the Apollo Gallery , named by the painter Charles Le Brun , who was commissioned by Louis XIV ( the Sun King ) to decorate the space in a solar theme . The medieval collection contains the coronation crown of Louis XIV , Charles V 's sceptre , and the 12th century porphyry vase . The Renaissance art holdings include Giambologna 's bronze Nessus and <unk> and the tapestry Maximillian 's Hunt . From later periods , highlights include Madame de Pompadour 's Sèvres vase collection and Napoleon III 's apartments . 
 In September 2000 , the Louvre Museum dedicated the Gilbert <unk> and Rose @-@ Marie <unk> Gallery to display tapestries donated by the <unk> , including a 16th @-@ century six @-@ part tapestry suite , sewn with gold and silver threads representing sea divinities , which was commissioned in Paris for Colbert de <unk> , Secretary of State for the Navy . 
 = = = Painting = = = 
 The painting collection has more than 7 @,@ 500 works from the 13th century to 1848 and is managed by 12 curators who oversee the collection 's display . Nearly two @-@ thirds are by French artists , and more than 1 @,@ 200 are Northern European . The Italian paintings compose most of the remnants of Francis I and Louis XIV 's collections , others are unreturned artwork from the Napoleon era , and some were bought . The collection began with Francis , who acquired works from Italian masters such as Raphael and Michelangelo and brought Leonardo da Vinci to his court . After the French Revolution , the Royal Collection formed the nucleus of the Louvre . When the d 'Orsay train station was converted into the Musée d 'Orsay in 1986 , the collection was split , and pieces completed after the 1848 Revolution were moved to the new museum . French and Northern European works are in the Richelieu wing and Cour Carrée ; Spanish and Italian paintings are on the first floor of the Denon wing . 
 Exemplifying the French School are the early Avignon Pietà of Enguerrand <unk> ; the anonymous painting of King Jean le Bon ( <unk> ) , possibly the oldest independent portrait in Western painting to survive from the <unk> era ; Hyacinthe Rigaud 's Louis XIV ; Jacques @-@ Louis David 's The Coronation of Napoleon ; and Eugène Delacroix 's Liberty Leading the People . Northern European works include Johannes Vermeer 's The <unk> and The Astronomer ; Caspar David Friedrich 's The Tree of Crows ; Rembrandt 's The Supper at Emmaus , Bathsheba at Her Bath , and The <unk> Ox . 
 The Italian holdings are notable , particularly the Renaissance collection . The works include Andrea Mantegna and Giovanni Bellini 's <unk> , which reflect realism and detail " meant to depict the significant events of a greater spiritual world " . The High Renaissance collection includes Leonardo da Vinci 's Mona Lisa , Virgin and Child with St. Anne , St. John the Baptist , and Madonna of the Rocks . Caravaggio is represented by The Fortune Teller and Death of the Virgin . From 16th century Venice , the Louvre displays Titian 's Le Concert <unk> , The Entombment and The Crowning with Thorns . 
 The La Caze Collection , a bequest to the Musée du Louvre in 1869 by Louis La Caze , was the largest contribution of a person in the history of the Louvre . La Caze gave 584 paintings of his personal collection to the museum . The bequest included Antoine Watteau 's Commedia dell 'arte player of Pierrot ( " Gilles " ) . In 2007 , this bequest was the topic of the exhibition " 1869 : Watteau , Chardin ... <unk> au Louvre . La collection La Caze " . 
 Some of the best known paintings of the museum have been digitized by the French Center for Research and Restoration of the Museums of France . 
 = = = Prints and drawings = = = 
 The prints and drawings department encompasses works on paper . The origins of the collection were the 8 @,@ 600 works in the Royal Collection ( Cabinet du Roi ) , which were increased via state appropriation , purchases such as the 1 @,@ 200 works from <unk> <unk> 's collection in 1806 , and donations . The department opened on 5 August 1797 , with 415 pieces displayed in the Galerie d 'Apollon . The collection is organized into three sections : the core Cabinet du Roi , 14 @,@ 000 royal copper printing @-@ plates , and the donations of Edmond de Rothschild , which include 40 @,@ 000 prints , 3 @,@ 000 drawings , and 5 @,@ 000 illustrated books .

 = = Location , access , and facilities = = 
 The museum lies in the center of Paris on the Right Bank . The neighborhood , known as the 1st arrondissement , was home to the former Tuileries Palace , which closed off the western end of the Louvre entrance courtyard , but was heavily damaged by fire during the Paris Commune of 1871 and later demolished . The adjacent Tuileries Gardens , created in 1564 by Catherine de ' Medici , was designed in 1664 by André Le Nôtre . The gardens house the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume , a contemporary art exhibition space which was used to store confiscated Jewish cultural property during the 1940 to 1944 German occupation of France . Parallel to the Jeu de Paume is the <unk> , home to the famous Water Lilies paintings by Claude Monet . 
 The Louvre is slightly askew of the Historic Axis ( Axe historique ) , a roughly eight @-@ kilometre ( five @-@ mile ) architectural line bisecting the city . It begins on the east in the Louvre courtyard and runs west along the Champs @-@ Élysées . In 1871 , the burning of the Tuileries Palace by the Paris Commune revealed that the Louvre was slightly askew of the Axe despite past appearances to the contrary . The Louvre can be reached by the Palais Royal – Musée du Louvre Métro or the Louvre @-@ Rivoli stations . 
 The Louvre has three entrances : the main entrance at the pyramid , an entrance from the Carrousel du Louvre underground shopping mall , and an entrance at the Porte des Lions ( near the western end of the Denon wing ) . 
 Under the main entrance to the museum is the Carrousel du Louvre , a shopping mall operated by <unk> @-@ <unk> . Among other stores , it has the first Apple Store in France , and a McDonald 's restaurant , the presence of which has created controversy . 
 The use of cameras and video recorders is permitted inside , but flash photography is forbidden .

 The episode starts with Michael Britten ( Jason Isaacs ) trying to convince therapists Dr. Jonathan Lee ( BD Wong ) and Dr. Judith Evans ( Cherry Jones ) that Ed Hawkins ( Kevin Weisman ) tried to kill him . The therapists claim that he is imagining the plot to cope . 
 Later , Michael tells Rex he must stay with his Aunt Carol , as Michael is working on a case with a dangerous suspect . His partner , Bird , goes to his house , after trying to call him to make sure he is alright , but then looks in the garage and finds Michael 's work on his accident and Detective Hawkins . Bird goes to Dr. Judith Evans , who reluctantly advises Bird to check on Michael . Michael goes to Ed Hawkins ' house , shoots Hawkins in the leg , and asks him for evidence . Hawkins says heroin was taken from various evidence lockers and sent out for sale through Westfield Distribution , and further evidence is on his laptop . Hawkins tries to overpower Michael , forcing him to kill Hawkins , right before Bird enters the house . Michael takes Bird 's gun and handcuffs him . Bird suggests that to get into Hawkins ' laptop , they use a hacker they both worked with previously , right before he knocks out Michael , who wakes up in the red reality . 
 Michael tells his wife to stay somewhere safe , and then tells the red reality Bird to meet him in the park . He tells Bird what he found out in the green reality ( where his son is alive and his wife is dead ) regarding Hawkins , his accident and the encrypted file and convinces Bird to copy it from Hawkins ' computer , though neither of them know Hawkins has been watching them . Hawkins meets immediately with Tricia Harper and Carl Kessel ( revealed to be Bird and Hawkins ' precinct chief in this reality ) and Kessel says they will kill both Michael and Bird and make it look like Michael did it , given his recently unstable behavior . Captain Harper shows doubts and remorse at this idea , but agrees . 
 Still in the red reality ( where his son is dead and his wife is alive ) , Michael visits the hacker suggested in the green <unk> he gains Hawkins ' password and unlocks the file . The files tell Michael that Hawkins and Kessel had a shipping container where they had been storing the heroin . Bird tells Michael that they will meet at his house , but when Michael gets there , Hawkins has killed Bird and tries to kill Michael . Hawkins , however , only manages to injure him . Hawkins calls in that Michael killed Bird and Captain Harper tells her precinct to use deadly force to bring Michael in , much to Detective Vega 's surprise . Vega tries to tell Harper that , even deranged , Michael would never kill Bird , but Harper emotionally rebuts him , saying he is showing sympathy for a killer . This leaves Vega confused and suspicious . Michael manages to escape Hawkins , but passes out from his wound and wakes up back in the green reality . 
 He finds himself back in his car , handcuffed , but relieved to see that the green reality Bird is still alive . He gives Bird Hawkins ' password ( " tulip " ) , and the information regarding Kessel and the shipping container convinces Bird that something is wrong . He takes Michael to Harper still in cuffs but they both tell her what they have learned . Harper approves Bird 's plan to send a team to the storage container but sends Michael to a cell , saying that if they do not find any evidence of his accusations , he 'll go to jail for killing Hawkins .

 = Typhoon Nabi = 
 Typhoon Nabi , known in the Philippines as Typhoon Jolina , was a powerful typhoon that struck southwestern Japan in September 2005 . The 14th named storm of the 2005 Pacific typhoon season , Nabi formed on August 29 to the east of the Northern Mariana Islands . It moved westward and passed about 55 km ( 35 mi ) north of Saipan on August 31 as an intensifying typhoon . On the next day , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded the storm to super typhoon status , with winds equivalent to that of a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . The Japan Meteorological Agency estimated peak ten @-@ minute winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) on September 2 . Nabi weakened while curving to the north , striking the Japanese island of Kyushu on September 6 . After brushing South Korea , the storm turned to the northeast , passing over Hokkaido before becoming extratropical on September 8 . 
 The typhoon first affected the Northern Marianas Islands , where it left US $ 2 @.@ 5 million in damage , while damaging or destroying 114 homes . The damage was enough to warrant a disaster declaration from the United States government . While passing near Okinawa , Nabi produced gusty winds and caused minor damage . Later , the western fringe of the storm caused several traffic accidents in Busan , South Korea , and throughout the country Nabi killed six people and caused US $ 115 @.@ 4 million in damage . About 250 @,@ 000 people evacuated along the Japanese island of Kyushu ahead of the storm , and there were disruptions to train , ferry , and airline services . In Kyushu , the storm left ¥ 4 @.@ 08 billion ( US $ 36 @.@ 9 million ) in crop damage after dropping 1 @,@ 322 mm ( 52 @.@ 0 in ) of rain over three days . During the storm 's passage , there were 61 daily rainfall records broken by Nabi 's precipitation . The rains caused flooding and landslides , forcing people to evacuate their homes and for businesses to close . Across Japan , Nabi killed 29 people and caused ¥ 94 @.@ 9 billion ( US $ 854 million ) in damage . Soldiers , local governments , and insurance companies helped residents recover from the storm damage . After affecting Japan , the typhoon affected the Kuril Islands of Russia , where it dropped the equivalent of the monthly precipitation , while also causing road damage due to high waves . Overall , Nabi killed 35 people , and its effects were significant enough for the name to be retired . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On August 28 , a large area of convection persisted about 1 @,@ 035 km ( 645 mi ) east of Guam . Located within an area of moderate wind shear , the system quickly organized while moving westward , its track influenced by a ridge to the north . At 00 : 00 UTC on August 29 , a tropical depression formed from the system , classified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) as Tropical Depression 14W . In initial forecasts , the agency anticipated steady strengthening , due to warm sea surface temperatures in the area . At 12 : 00 UTC on August 29 , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) upgraded it to a tropical storm . As such , the JMA named the storm Nabi . About 12 hours later , the JMA upgraded Nabi further to a severe tropical storm , after the convection organized into spiral rainbands . At 18 : 00 UTC , Nabi intensified to typhoon status , reaching ten @-@ minute sustained winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . 
 On August 31 , Nabi passed about 55 km ( 35 mi ) north @-@ northeast of Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands during its closest approach . The typhoon continued to intensify quickly as it moved to the west @-@ northwest . On September 1 , the JTWC upgraded the storm to a super typhoon and later estimated peak one @-@ minute winds of 260 km / h ( 160 mph ) ; this is the equivalent of a Category 5 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale . By contrast , the JMA estimated peak ten @-@ minute winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) on September 2 , with a barometric pressure of 925 mbar ( 27 @.@ 3 inHg ) . While at peak intensity , the typhoon developed a large 95 km ( 60 mi ) wide eye . For about 36 hours , Nabi maintained its peak winds , during which it crossed into the area of responsibility of PAGASA ; the Philippine @-@ based agency gave it the local name " Jolina " , although the storm remained away from the country . 
 On September 3 , Nabi began weakening as it turned more to the north , the result of an approaching trough weakening the ridge . Later that day , the winds leveled off at 160 km / h ( 100 mph ) , according to the JMA . On September 5 , Nabi passed near <unk> and Yakushima , part of the Daitō and Ōsumi island groups offshore southern Japan . Around that time , the JTWC estimated that the typhoon reintensified slightly to a secondary peak of 215 km / h ( 130 mph ) . After turning due north , Nabi made landfall near Isahaya , Nagasaki around 05 : 00 UTC on September 6 , after passing through the Izumi District of Kagoshima . Shortly thereafter , the storm entered the Sea of Japan . The typhoon turned to the northeast into the mid @-@ latitude flow , influenced by a low over the Kamchatka Peninsula . At 18 : 00 UTC on September 6 , the JTWC discontinued advisories on Nabi , declaring it extratropical , although the JMA continued tracking the storm . On the next day , Nabi moved across northern Hokkaido into the Sea of Okhotsk . The JMA declared the storm as extratropical on September 8 , which continued eastward until dissipating on September 10 south of the Aleutian Islands . The remnants of Nabi weakened and later moved into southwestern Alaska on September 12 .

 After Nabi formed as a tropical depression on August 29 , the local National Weather Service office on Guam issued a tropical storm watch for the islands Tinian , Rota , Sapian , and Agrihan . On August 30 , the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning for Rota and Agrihan , while a typhoon warning was issued for Tinian and Saipan . On all four islands , a Condition of Readiness 1 was declared . The government of the Northern Mariana Islands advised Tinian and Saipan residents along the coast and in poorly @-@ built buildings to evacuate , and several schools operated as shelters . About 700 people evacuated on Saipan , and the airport was closed , stranding about 1 @,@ 000 travelers . As a precaution , schools were closed on Guam on August 31 , after a tropical storm warning was issued for the island the night prior . The island 's governor , Felix Perez Camacho , also declared a condition of readiness 2 , as well as a state of emergency . Due to the typhoon , several flights were canceled or delayed at Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport on Guam . 
 Ahead of the storm , United States Forces Japan evacuated planes from Okinawa to either Guam or mainland Japan to prevent damage . Officials at the military bases on Okinawa advised residents to remain inside during the storm 's passage . While Nabi was turning to the north , the island was placed under a Condition of Readiness 2 . At the military base in Sasebo , ships also evacuated , and several buildings were closed after a Condition of Readiness 1 was declared . 
 In Kyushu , officials evacuated over a quarter of a million people in fear of Typhoon Nabi affecting Japan . These continued after the storm made landfall to protect residents from flood waters and landslides . The first order during the storm took place in the <unk> district . In Miyazaki City , 21 @,@ 483 households were evacuated following reports of significant overflow on the nearby river . Another 10 @,@ 000 residences were vacated in Nobeoka following similar reports . The entirety of the West Japan Railway Company was shut down . Canceled train services affected 77 @,@ 800 people on Shikoku . Ferry service was also shut down , cutting off transportation for tens of thousands of people . In addition , at least 723 flights were cancelled because of the storm . Japan 's second @-@ largest refinery , <unk> <unk> , stopped shipments to other refineries across the area , and Japan 's largest refinery , Nippon Oil , stopped all sea shipments . The Cosmo Oil Company , Japan 's fourth largest refinery , stopped all shipments to Yokkaichi and Sakaide refineries . About 700 schools in the country were closed . Approximately 1 @,@ 500 soldiers were dispatched to Tokyo to help coastal areas prepare for Typhoon Nabi 's arrival , and to clean up after the storm . Officials in the Miyazaki Prefecture issued a flood warning for expected heavy rains in the area . 
 In South Korea , the government issued a typhoon warning for the southern portion of the country along the coast , prompting the airport at Pohang to close , and forcing 162 flights to be canceled . Ferry service was also disrupted , and thousands of boats returned to port . The storm also prompted 138 schools to close in the region . Earlier , the storm spurred fears of a possible repeat of either typhoon Rusa in 2002 or Maemi in 2003 , both of which were devastating storms in South Korea . Officials in the Russian Far East issued a storm warning for Vladivostok , advising boats to remain at port .

 While passing between Saipan and the volcanic island of Anatahan , Nabi brought tropical storm force winds to several islands in the Northern Mariana Islands . Saipan International Airport reported sustained winds of 95 km / h ( 59 mph ) , with gusts to 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . Also on the island , Nabi produced 173 mm ( 6 @.@ 82 in ) of rainfall . The storm destroyed two houses and left 26 others uninhabitable , while 77 homes sustained minor damage , largely from flooding or roof damage . Nabi damaged 70 – 80 % of the crops on Saipan and also knocked down many trees , leaving behind 544 tonnes ( 600 tons ) of debris . The entire island was left without power , some without water , after the storm . On Tinian to the south , Nabi damaged or destroyed nine homes , with heavy crop damage . On Rota , there was minor flooding and scattered power outages . Farther south , the outer reaches of the storm produced sustained winds of 69 km / h ( 43 mph ) at Apra Harbor on Guam , while gusts peaked at 101 km / h ( 63 mph ) at <unk> . Gusts reached 72 km / h ( 45 mph ) at the international airport on Guam , the highest during 2005 . The storm dropped 115 mm ( 4 @.@ 53 in ) of rainfall in 24 hours on the island . Flooding covered roads for several hours and entered classrooms at <unk> Middle School , forcing hundreds of students to evacuate . Damage in the region was estimated US $ 2 @.@ 5 million . After Nabi exited the region , it produced high surf for several days on Guam and Saipan . 
 Later in its duration , Nabi brushed southeastern South Korea with rainbands . Ulsan recorded a 24 ‑ hour rainfall total of 319 mm ( 12 @.@ 6 in ) , while Pohang recorded a record 24 ‑ hour total of 540 @.@ 5 mm ( 21 @.@ 28 in ) . The highest total was 622 @.@ 5 mm ( 24 @.@ 5 in ) of rainfall . The periphery of the storm produced gusts of 121 km / h ( 75 mph ) in the port city of Busan , strong enough to damage eight billboards and knock trees over . Heavy rains caused several traffic accidents and injuries in Busan , while strong waves washed a cargo ship ashore in Pohang . Throughout South Korea , the storm led to six fatalities and caused US $ 115 @.@ 4 million in damages . 
 In the Kuril Islands of Russia , Nabi dropped about 75 mm ( 3 in ) of rain , equivalent to the monthly average . Gusts reached 83 km / h ( 51 mph ) , weak enough not to cause major damage . During the storm 's passage , high waves washed away unpaved roads in Severo @-@ <unk> .

 The outer rainbands of Nabi began affecting Okinawa on September 3 . The storm 's strongest winds ended up bypassing the island , and wind gusts peaked at 85 km / h ( 53 mph ) . Two elderly women were injured from the wind gusts . There were minor power outages and some houses were damaged . In the Amami Islands between Okinawa and mainland Japan , Nabi produced gusts of 122 km / h ( 76 mph ) in Kikaijima . Waves of 9 m ( 30 ft ) in height affected Amami Ōshima . 
 While moving through western Japan , Nabi dropped heavy rainfall that totaled 1 @,@ 322 mm ( 52 @.@ 0 in ) over a three @-@ day period in Miyazaki Prefecture , the equivalent to nearly three times the average annual precipitation . The same station in Miyazaki reported a 24 ‑ hour rainfall total of 932 mm ( 36 @.@ 7 in ) , as well as an hourly total of 66 mm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) . Within the main islands of Japan , Nabi dropped 228 @.@ 6 mm ( 9 in ) of rainfall per hour in the capital Tokyo . 
 During the storm 's passage , there were 61 daily rainfall records broken by Nabi 's precipitation across Japan . The rains from Nabi caused significant slope failures and large accumulations of driftwood . The amount of sediment displaced by the rains was estimated at 4 @,@ 456 m3 / km2 , over four times the yearly average . A total of 630 m3 ( 2 @,@ 066 ft3 ) of driftwood was recorded . However , the rainfall also helped to end water restrictions in Kagawa and Tokushima prefectures . In addition to the heavy rainfall , Nabi produced gusty winds on the Japan mainland , peaking at 115 km / h ( 72 mph ) in Muroto . A station on <unk> in the Sea of Japan recorded a gust of 119 km / h ( 74 mph ) . The typhoon spawned a F1 tornado in Miyazaki , which damaged several buildings . In <unk> , Ishikawa , Nabi produced a Foehn wind , causing temperatures to rise quickly . 
 Throughout Japan , Nabi caused damage in 31 of the 47 prefectures , leaving over 270 @,@ 000 residences without power . Torrential rains caused flooding and landslides throughout the country . The storm destroyed 7 @,@ 452 houses and flooded 21 @,@ 160 others . Several car assembly plants were damaged in southwestern Japan , while others were closed due to power outages , such as Toyota , Mazda , and Mitsubishi . In addition , the storm wrecked about 81 ships along the coast . On the island of Kyushu , damage in Ōita Prefecture on Kyushu reached ¥ 11 @.@ 7 billion ( US $ 106 million ) , the fifth highest of any typhoon in the preceding 10 years ; about 20 % of the total there was related to road damages . In nearby Saga Prefecture , crop damage totaled about ¥ 1 @.@ 06 billion ( US $ 9 @.@ 6 million ) , mostly to rice but also to soybeans and various other vegetables . Crop damage as a whole on Kyushu totaled ¥ 4 @.@ 08 billion ( US $ 36 @.@ 9 million ) . 
 In the capital city of Tokyo , heavy rainfall increased levels along several rivers , which inundated several houses . Strong winds damaged ¥ 28 @.@ 8 million ( US $ 259 @,@ 000 ) in crop damage in Gifu Prefecture , and ¥ 27 @.@ 1 million ( US $ 244 @,@ 000 ) in crop damage in Osaka . In Yamaguchi Prefecture on western Honshu , Nabi damaged a portion of the historical <unk> Bridge , originally built in 1674 . In Yamagata Prefecture , the winds damaged a window in a school , injuring several boys from the debris . One person was seriously injured in Kitakata , Fukushima after strong winds blew a worker from scaffolding of a building under construction . Effects from Nabi spread as far north as Hokkaido , where heavy rainfall damaged roads and caused hundreds of schools to close . In <unk> , an overflown river flooded a hotel , and a minor power outage occurred in <unk> . 
 Ahead of the storm , high waves and gusty winds led to one drowning when a woman was knocked off a ferry in Takamatsu , Kagawa . A landslide in Miyazaki destroyed five homes , killing three people . A man who was listed as missing was found dead in a flooded rice field . In Tarumi , a landslide buried a home in mud , killing two people .

 After the storm , members of Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni provided $ 2 @,@ 500 to the town of Iwakuni toward cleanup and disaster relief . Soldiers also helped nearby residents and farmers to complete the rice harvest , after floods from the typhoon damaged harvesting machines . The local government of <unk> distributed disinfectant chemicals to flooded houses . Closed markets and decreased supplies caused the price of beef to reach record levels in the country . Following the storm , the General Insurance Association of Japan reported that insurance claims from the typhoon totaled ¥ 58 @.@ 8 billion ( US $ 53 million ) , the tenth @-@ highest for any natural disaster in the country .

The Japanese government provided food , water , and rescue workers to the affected areas in the days after the storm , along with Japan Post , the local post system ; trucks were mobilized to affected towns , accompanied by a mobile bank and insurance agent . 
 On November 8 , nearly two months after the dissipation of Typhoon Nabi , President George W. Bush declared a major disaster declaration for the Northern Mariana islands . The declaration allocated aid from the United States to help restore damaged buildings , pay for debris removal , and other emergency services . Federal funding was also made available on a cost @-@ sharing basis for the islands to mitigate against future disasters . The government ultimately provided $ 1 @,@ 046 @,@ 074 @.@ 03 to the commonwealth . 
 Due to the damage of the storm in Japan , the Typhoon Committee of the World Meteorological Organization agreed to retire the name Nabi . The agency replaced it with the name <unk> , effective January 1 , 2007 . 
 = The Plays of William Shakespeare = 
 The Plays of William Shakespeare was an 18th @-@ century edition of the dramatic works of William Shakespeare , edited by Samuel Johnson and George Steevens . Johnson announced his intention to edit Shakespeare 's plays in his Miscellaneous Observations on Macbeth ( 1745 ) , and a full Proposal for the edition was published in 1756 . The edition was finally published in 1765 . 
 In the " Preface " to his edition , Johnson justifies trying to determine the original language of the Shakespearean plays . To benefit the reading audience , he added explanatory notes to various passages . Later editors followed Johnson 's lead and sought to determine an authoritative text of Shakespeare . 
 = = Background = = 
 Johnson began reading Shakespeare 's plays and poetry when he was a young boy . He would involve himself so closely with the plays that he was once terrified by the Ghost in Hamlet and had to " have people about him " . Johnson 's fascination with Shakespeare continued throughout his life , and Johnson focused his time on Shakespeare 's plays while preparing A Dictionary of the English Language , so it is no wonder that Shakespeare is the most quoted author in it . 
 Johnson came to believe that there was a problem with the collections of Shakespearean plays that were available during his lifetime . He believed that they lacked <unk> , because they : 
 were transcribed for the players by those who may be supposed to have seldom understood them ; they were transmitted by copiers equally unskillful , who still multiplied errors ; they were perhaps sometimes mutilated by the actors , for the sake of shortening the speeches ; and were at last printed without correction of the press . 
 Although Johnson was friends with actors such as David Garrick who had performed Shakespeare onstage , he did not believe that performance was vital to the plays , nor did he ever acknowledge the presence of an audience as a factor in the reception of the work . Instead , Johnson believed that the reader of Shakespeare was the true audience of the play . 
 Furthermore , Johnson believed that later editors both misunderstood the historical context of Shakespeare and his plays , and underestimated the degree of textual corruption that the plays exhibit . He believed that this was because " The style of Shakespeare was in itself perplexed , ungrammatical , and obscure " . To correct these problems , Johnson believed that the original works would need to be examined , and this became an issue in his Proposal . Johnson also believed that an edition of Shakespeare could provide him with the income and recognition that he needed . However , a full edition of Shakespeare would require a publisher to make a large commitment of time and money , so Johnson decided to begin by focusing on a single play , Macbeth . 
 = = = Miscellaneous Observations = = = 
 Johnson began work on Macbeth to provide a sample of what he thought could be achieved in a new edition of Shakespeare . He got much of his information while working on the Harleian Catalogue , a catalogue of the collection of works and pamphlets owned by Robert Harley , 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer . He published this work , along with a commentary on Sir Thomas Hanmer , 4th Baronet 's edition of Shakespeare 's plays , as Miscellaneous Observations or Miscellaneous Observations on the Tragedy of Macbeth on 6 April 1745 by Edward Cave . 
 Hanmer produced an edition of Shakespeare 's plays for the Clarendon Press in October 1744 , and Johnson felt that he could attract more attention to his own work by challenging some of Hanmer 's points . Johnson criticised Hanmer for editing Shakespeare 's words based on subjective opinion instead of objective fact . In particular , Johnson writes : 
 He appears to find no difficulty in most of those passages which I have represented as unintelligible , and has therefore passed smoothly over them , without any attempt to alter or explain them ... Such harmless industry may surely be forgiven if it cannot be praised ; may he therefore never want a monosyllable who can use it with such wonderful dexterity . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ! ( " If anyone is going to burst with envy , let him do so ! " – Martial ) 
 He then continues : 
 The rest of this edition I have not read , but , from the little that I have seen , I think it not dangerous to declare that , in my opinion , its pomp recommends it more than its accuracy . There is no distinction made between the ancient reading , and the innovations of the editor ; there is no reason given for any of the alterations which are made ; the emendations of former editions are adopted without any acknowledgement , and few of the difficulties are removed which have hitherto embarrassed the readers of Shakespeare . 
 The Miscellaneous Observations contains many of Johnson 's early thoughts and theories on Shakespeare . For instance , Johnson thought that there was an uncanny power in Shakespeare 's supernatural scenes and wrote , " He that <unk> Shakespeare looks round alarmed and starts to find himself alone " . 
 At the end of the work , Johnson announced that he would produce a new edition of Shakespeare : 
 Proposals for printing a new edition of the plays of William Shakespeare , with notes , critical and explanatory , in which the text will be corrected : the various readings remarked : the <unk> of former editors examined , and their omissions supplied . By the author of the Miscellaneous Observations on the Tragedy of Macbeth . 
 In response , Jacob Tonson and his associates , who controlled the copyright of the current edition of Shakespeare , threatened to sue Johnson and Cave in a letter written on 11 April 1745 . They did so to protect their new edition , edited by the Shakespeare scholar William Warburton . 
 = = = Proposal = = = 
 On 1 June 1756 , Johnson reprinted his Miscellaneous Observations but attached his Proposal or Proposals for Printing , by Subscription , the Dramatick Works of William Shakespeare , Corrected and Illustrated . On 2 June 1756 , he signed a contract to edit an eight @-@ volume set of Shakespeare 's writings including a preface , and on 8 June 1756 Johnson printed his Proposal , now called Proposals for an Edition of Shakespeare . The Proposal sold subscriptions for Johnson 's future edition at the cost of two guineas , the first paid before and the second upon printing . When Johnson achieved scholarly renown for his A Dictionary of the English Language , Warburton 's publishers , Tonson et al . , granted him permission to work on Shakespeare . 
 In the Proposal , Johnson describes the various problems with previous editions of Shakespeare and argues how a new edition , written by himself , would correct these problems . In particular , Johnson promised to " correct what is corrupt , and to explain what is obscure " . He would accomplish this by relying on " a careful collation of all the oldest copies " and to read " the same story in the very book which Shakespeare consulted " . Unlike other editors who " slight their predecessors " , Johnson claimed that " all that is valuable will be adopted from every commentator , that posterity may consider it as including all the rest , and exhibiting whatever is hitherto known of the great father of the English drama " . Later in the work , he promised that it would be ready by December 1757 . 
 Johnson was contracted to finish the edition in 18 months but as the months passed , his pace slowed . He told Charles Burney in December 1757 that it would take him until the following March to complete it . Before that could happen , in February 1758 he was arrested again for an unpaid debt of £ 40 . The debt was soon repaid by Tonson , who had contracted Johnson to publish the work ; this motivated Johnson to finish the edition to repay the favour . Although it took him another seven years to finish , Johnson completed a few volumes of his Shakespeare to prove his commitment to the project . 
 = = Johnson 's Shakespeare = = 
 Johnson admitted to John Hawkins , " my inducement to it is not love or desire of fame , but the want of money , which is the only motive to writing that I know of . " However , the money was not a strong enough motivator and in 1758 , partly as a way to avoid having to finish his Shakespeare , Johnson began to write a weekly series , The Idler , which ran from 15 April 1758 to 5 April 1760 . 
 By 1762 , Johnson had gained a reputation for being a slow worker . Contemporary poet Charles Churchill teased Johnson for the delay in producing his long @-@ promised edition of Shakespeare : " He for subscribers baits his hook / and takes your cash , but where 's the book ? " The comments soon stung Johnson into renewed work . It was only in 20 July 1762 , when he received the first payment on a government pension of 300 pounds a year , that he no longer had to worry about money and was finally able to dedicate most of his time to finishing the work . 
 On 10 January 1765 , the day after Johnson was introduced to Henry and Hester Thrale , Johnson noted in his diary that he " Corrected a sheet . " Afterwards , he began visiting his friend Richard Farmer who was writing his Essay on the Learning of Shakespeare to aid in his completely revising the work . During this time , Johnson added more than 550 notes as he began to revise the work for publication . In June , Johnson advertised that his edition would be published on 1 August 1765 . However , he was unable to work on the Preface until August and it was not printed until 29 September . George Steevens volunteered to help Johnson work on the Preface during this time . 
 Johnson 's edition of Shakespeare 's plays was finally published on 10 October 1765 as The Plays of William Shakespeare , in Eight Volumes ... To which are added Notes by Sam . Johnson in a printing of 1 @,@ 000 copies . The edition sold quickly and a second edition was soon printed , with an expanded edition to follow in 1773 and a further revised edition in 1778 . 
 = = = Preface = = = 
 There are four components to Johnson 's Preface to Shakespeare : a discussion of Shakespeare 's " greatness " especially in his " portrayal of human nature " ; the " faults or weakness " of Shakespeare ; Shakespeare 's plays in relationship to contemporary poetry and drama ; and a history of " Shakespearean criticism and editing down to the mid @-@ 1700 's " and what his work intends to do . 
 Johnson begins : 
 That praises are without reason lavished on the dead , and that the honours due only to excellence are paid to antiquity , is a complaint likely to be always continued by those , who , being able to add nothing to truth , hope for eminence from the heresies of paradox ; or those , who , being forced by disappointment upon consolatory expedients , are willing to hope from posterity what the present age refuses , and flatter themselves that the regard which is yet denied by envy , will be at last bestowed by time . Antiquity , like every other quality that attracts the notice of mankind , has undoubtedly votaries that reverence it , not from reason , but from prejudice . Some seem to admire indiscriminately whatever has been long preserved , without considering that time has sometimes co @-@ operated with chance ; all perhaps are more willing to honour past than present excellence ; and the mind contemplates genius through the shades of age , as the eye surveys the sun through artificial opacity . The great contention of criticism is to find the faults of the moderns , and the beauties of the ancients . While an authour is yet living we estimate his powers by his worst performance , and when he is dead we rate them by his best . 
 To works , however , of which the excellence is not absolute and definite , but gradual and comparative ; to works not raised upon principles demonstrative and <unk> , but appealing wholly to observation and experience , no other test can be applied than length of duration and continuance of esteem . What mankind have long possessed they have often examined and compared , and if they persist to value the possession , it is because frequent comparisons have confirmed opinion in its favour . As among the works of nature no man can properly call a river deep or a mountain high , without the knowledge of many mountains and many rivers ; so in the productions of genius , nothing can be <unk> excellent till it has been compared with other works of the same kind . Demonstration immediately displays its power , and has nothing to hope or fear from the flux of years ; but works tentative and experimental must be estimated by their proportion to the general and collective ability of man , as it is discovered in a long succession of endeavours . Of the first building that was raised , it might be with certainty determined that it was round or square , but whether it was spacious or lofty must have been referred to time . The Pythagorean scale of numbers was at once discovered to be perfect ; but the poems of Homer we yet know not to transcend the common limits of human intelligence , but by remarking , that nation after nation , and century after century , has been able to do little more than transpose his incidents , new name his characters , and paraphrase his sentiments . 
 The reverence due to writings that have long subsisted arises therefore not from any credulous confidence in the superior wisdom of past ages , or gloomy persuasion of the degeneracy of mankind , but is the consequence of acknowledged and indubitable positions , that what has been longest known has been most considered , and what is most considered is best understood . 
 Johnson then introduces Shakespeare : 
 The poet , of whose works I have undertaken the revision , may now begin to assume the dignity of an ancient , and claim the privilege of established fame and prescriptive veneration . He has long outlived his century , the term commonly fixed as the test of literature merit . Whatever advantages he might once derive from personal allusions , local customs , or temporary opinions , have for many years been lost ; and every topic of merriment , or motive of sorrow , which the modes of artificial life afforded him , now only obscure the scenes which they once illuminated . The effects of favour and competition are at an end ; the tradition of his friendships and his enmities has perished ; his works support no opinion with arguments , nor supply any faction with invectives ; they can neither indulge vanity nor gratify <unk> ; but are read without any other reason than the desire of pleasure , and are therefore praised only as pleasure is obtained ; yet , thus unassisted by interest or passion , they have past through variation of taste and changes of manners , and , as they devolved from one generation to another , have received new honours at every transmission .

 Johnson , in his Proposal , said that " the corruptions of the text will be corrected by a careful collation of the oldest copies " . Accordingly , Johnson attempted to obtain early texts of the plays but many people were unwilling to lend him their editions out of a fear that they might be destroyed . David Garrick offered Johnson access to his collection of Shakespeare texts but Johnson declined the offer , believing that Garrick would expect preferential treatment in return . 
 Johnson 's strength was to create a set of corresponding notes that allow readers to identify the meaning behind many of Shakespeare 's more complicated passages or ones that may have been transcribed incorrectly over time . Included within the notes are occasional attacks upon the rival editors of Shakespeare 's works and their editions . 
 In 1766 , Steevens published his own edition of Shakespeare 's plays that was " designed to transcend Johnson 's in proceeding further towards a sound text " , but it lacked the benefit of Johnson 's critical notes . The two worked together to create a revised edition of Shakespeare 's plays in ten volumes , published in 1773 with additional corrections in 1778 . Steevens provided most of the textual work , with Johnson contributing an additional eighty notes . 
 = = Critical response = = 
 After Johnson was forced to back down from producing his edition of Shakespeare in 1746 , his rival editor William Warburton praised Johnson 's Miscellaneous Observations as " some critical notes on Macbeth , given as a specimen of a projected edition , and written , as appears , by a man of parts and genius " . Years later , Edmond Malone , an important Shakespearean scholar and friend of Johnson 's , said that Johnson 's " vigorous and comprehensive understanding threw more light on his authour than all his predecessors had done " , and that the Preface was " the finest composition in our language " . Adam Smith said that the Preface was " the most manly piece of criticism that was ever published in any country . " 
 In 1908 , Walter Raleigh claimed that Johnson helped the reader to " go straight to Shakespeare 's meaning , while the philological and antiquarian commentators kill one another in the dark . " Raleigh then admitted that he " soon falls into the habit , when he meets with an obscure passage , of consulting Johnson 's note before the others . " T. S. Eliot wrote that " no poet can ask more of posterity than to be greatly honoured by the great ; and Johnson 's words about Shakespeare are great honour " . 
 Walter Jackson Bate , in his 1977 biography on Johnson , wrote : 
 the edition of Shakespeare – viewed with historical understanding of what it involved in 1765 – could seem a remarkable feat ; and we are not speaking of just the great Preface To see it in perspective , we have only to remind ourselves what Johnson brought to it – an assemblage of almost every qualification we should ideally like to have brought to this kind of work with the single exception of patience ... Operating in and through these qualities was his own extensive knowledge of human nature and life . No Shakespearean critic or editor has ever approached him in this respect . 
 John Wain , another of Johnson 's biographers , claimed , " There is no better statement of the reason why Shakespeare needs to be edited , and what aims an editor can reasonably set himself " than Johnson 's Proposal . 
 = Loughor Castle = 
 Loughor Castle is a ruined , medieval fortification located in the town of Loughor , Wales . The castle was built around 1106 by the Anglo @-@ Norman lord Henry de Beaumont , during the Norman invasion of Wales . The site overlooked the River Loughor and controlled a strategic road and ford running across the Gower Peninsula . The castle was designed as an oval ringwork , probably topped by wicker fence defences , and reused the remains of the former Roman fort of <unk> . 
 Over the next two centuries , the castle was involved in many conflicts . It was attacked and burnt , probably in the Welsh uprising of 1151 , and was captured by the forces of Llywelyn the Great in 1215 . John de Braose acquired the castle in 1220 and repaired it , constructing a stone curtain wall to replace the older defences . Attacked again in 1251 , the castle was reinforced with a stone tower in the second half of the 13th century . It declined in importance during the late @-@ medieval period , and by the 19th century , the castle was ruinous and overgrown with ivy . 
 In the 21st century , Loughor Castle is controlled by the Welsh heritage agency Cadw and operated as a tourist attraction . The ruined tower and fragments of the curtain wall still survive on top of the ringwork 's earthwork defences , which now resemble a motte , or mound , and are part of the Loughor Castle Park . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = 1st – 4th centuries = = = 
 Loughor Castle is located 11 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 8 mi ) west of Swansea in South @-@ West Wales , overlooking the River Loughor . The site was first used by the Romans for a military fort , one of a sequence running across South @-@ West Wales . The fort , <unk> , took its name from the Celtic name for the River Loughor . Its location provided good visibility across the region and enabled it to support naval units operating in the Bristol Channel . It also controlled a ford across the River Loughor ; this ford had probably emerged by the time of the Roman period , and was passable at high tide . The fort was built around 75 AD and was used until the middle of the 2nd century ; it was then reoccupied by the Romans during the late 3rd and early 4th century , before being abandoned by the military . 
 = = = 11th – 12th centuries = = = 
 The Normans began to make incursions into South Wales from the late @-@ 1060s onwards , pushing westwards from their bases in recently occupied England . Their advance was marked by the construction of castles , frequently on old Roman sites , for example those at Cardiff , Pevensey and Portchester , and the creation of regional lordships . Reusing former Roman sites in this way produced considerable savings in the manpower required to construct the large earth fortifications of the early castles . 
 Loughor Castle was constructed on the western edge of the Welsh commote , or land unit , of <unk> . The castle was built shortly after 1106 , when Henry de Beaumont , the Earl of Warwick , was given the Gower Peninsula by Henry I. The Anglo @-@ Norman colonisation of the region followed , with Gower becoming a Marcher territory , enjoying extensive local independence . Loughor Castle was strategically important because it controlled the main road running through <unk> from Beaumont 's main base at Swansea Castle , and was a valuable coastal port . The castle took its name from a corruption of the title of the Roman fort . 
 In the 12th century , the castle would have been defended on its south side by a steep slope and the marshy ground running along the river . It was designed as an oval ringwork , which today is around 21 metres ( 69 ft ) by 18 metres ( 59 ft ) across and 12 metres ( 39 ft ) high , protected by a ditch 5 metres ( 16 ft ) wide and 2 metres ( 6 ft 7 in ) deep . The Roman fort in this corner was only visible as earthworks in the 12th century , and the builders used part of these in the construction of the ringwork . The ringwork was made up of a core of river gravel and coarse sand , with finer sand and clay forming the surface layer . The ringwork had a protective wicker fence around the top of the earthworks and possibly some form of early stone or wooden tower , with a gateway just to the north side of it . It is unclear what kind of buildings were constructed inside the ringwork , although a kitchen was certainly built on the east side of the enclosure . 
 The first half of the 12th century was a violent period in Gower , with extensive fighting occurring between the Anglo @-@ Normans and the local Welsh . Loughor Castle was attacked and burnt down around the middle of the century , probably as a part of a Welsh rebellion that devastated the area in 1151 . Henry II and the Welsh prince Rhys ap Gruffydd later agreed peace terms , and the castle was rebuilt . The inside of the ringwork was partially filled by debris during the 1151 attack , and at some point in the next few decades the bank of the ringwork was also deliberately widened inwards in places , allowing buildings to be constructed on it . These changes started the process of filling in the middle of the ringwork which led to the castle today having a mound , or motte @-@ like , appearance . 
 At around the end of the 12th century , two stone buildings were constructed in the centre of the ringwork , one of them being around 8 metres ( 26 ft ) by 4 @.@ 5 metres ( 15 ft ) . The castle probably passed into the control of the King of England at around this time , in lieu of debts owed by the Earl of Warwick . War broke out again across South @-@ West Wales in 1189 on the death of Henry II , as Rhys and his sons attempted to reclaim the region . 
 = = = 13th – 14th centuries = = = 
 Gower continued to see extensive fighting in the 13th century . Loughor Castle was given by King John to his ally William de Braose in 1203 ; William was a powerful Marcher Lord , and related to Rhys ap Gruffudd and his extended family . In 1208 , however , John and William argued ; their relationship broke down and the king attempted to confiscate Loughor and William 's other lands in the region . William allied himself with the Welsh prince Llywelyn the Great and war broke out . William died in 1211 , but his son , Reginald , continued fighting and married <unk> , Llywelyn 's daughter . In 1215 , the castle was captured by Llywelyn 's forces and control of Gower was granted to Reginald . Two years later , however , Reginald made peace with the English Crown and Llywelyn removed him from power , replacing him with the Welsh prince Rhys Gryg . Contemporary chroniclers recorded that Rhys Gryg deliberately destroyed all the castles in Gower as part of his campaign to dominate the area . 
 <unk> married another of his daughters , Margaret , to Reginald 's nephew , John de Braose , and in 1220 <unk> gave him Gower and Loughor Castle , which John appears to have set about repairing . As part of this work , a stone curtain wall was built around the castle . This included a sally port on the north side of the castle . 
 In 1232 the castle was inherited by John 's son , William de Braose , and in turn his son , also called William . In the second half of the century , Wales saw a renewal of fighting , and the castle was attacked again in 1251 . The decision was taken to improve the castle 's defences and , as part of this , a square , stone tower was added to the castle to provide living accommodation , with three chambers , the first floor containing a garderobe and a fireplace . A gateway was constructed through the curtain wall just to the south of the tower . Two further stone buildings were constructed within the castle walls . 
 In 1302 , William de Braose granted the Loughor estate to his seneschal , John Yweyn , for life , in exchange for an annual fee of a greyhound collar . On John Yweyn 's death in 1322 the lands were seized by John de Mowbray , William 's son @-@ in @-@ law . John was involved in the rebellion against Edward II , however , and was executed later in 1322 ; John Yweyn 's next of kin , Alice <unk> , successfully appealed to the king and was granted the lands instead . Edward fell from power in 1327 , and the Loughor lands were granted to John de Mowbray 's son , John . 
 = = = 15th – 21st centuries = = = 
 The importance of Loughor Castle and the surrounding town declined in the late @-@ medieval period , and by the 19th century the castle had been ruined for many years and was covered in ivy . The castle was painted by the artist William Butler in the 1850s , who depicted the ruins alongside the local industries and the new railway line that had been cut through the remains of the former Roman fort . 
 In the 1940s , the south @-@ east corner of the castle tower collapsed ; the corner fell to the ground intact and because of its archaeological value it was decided to leave the fallen stonework in place on the ground , rather than risk further damaging it by removing it . In 1946 the castle was given to the Ministry of Works , and is now in the control of the Welsh heritage agency Cadw and operated as a tourist attraction . The castle sits within the grounds of the small Loughor Castle Park . 
 Archaeological investigations were carried out between 1969 – 71 and in 1973 . The castle is protected as a scheduled monument under UK law . Much of the curtain wall has been stolen and destroyed since the medieval period , although fragments remain up to 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 4 ft 11 in ) high , and the ruins of the tower remain a prominent feature of the local area .

 In a DVD review for the individual episode DVD release <unk> , Roy Hrab of DVD Verdict said that " In my previous SpongeBob reviews I have commented that series has lost its edge .

 = Stephen Harper = 
 Stephen Joseph Harper PC MP ( born April 30 , 1959 ) is a Canadian politician and member of Parliament who served as the 22nd Prime Minister of Canada , from February 6 , 2006 to November 4 , 2015 . He was the first prime minister to come from the modern Conservative Party of Canada , which was formed by a merger of the Progressive Conservative Party and the Canadian Alliance . 
 Harper has been the member of parliament for the riding of Calgary Heritage in Alberta , since 2002 ( previously known as Calgary Southwest from 2002 to 2015 ) . Earlier , from 1993 to 1997 , he was the MP for Calgary West , representing the Reform Party of Canada . He was one of the founding members of the Reform Party , but did not seek re @-@ election in the 1997 federal election . Harper instead joined and later led the National Citizens Coalition , a conservative lobbyist group . In 2002 , he succeeded Stockwell Day as leader of the Canadian Alliance , the successor to the Reform Party and returned to parliament as Leader of the Opposition . In 2003 , he reached an agreement with Progressive Conservative leader Peter MacKay for the merger of their two parties to form the Conservative Party of Canada . He was elected as the party 's first leader , in March 2004 . 
 The 2006 federal election resulted in a minority government led by the Conservative Party with Harper becoming the 22nd Prime Minister of Canada . By proportion of seats , this was Canada 's smallest minority government since Confederation . Despite this , it was the longest @-@ serving minority government overall . In the 2008 federal election , the Conservative Party won a stronger minority , showing a small increase in the percentage of the popular vote and increased representation in the Canadian House of Commons , with 143 of 308 seats . The 40th Canadian Parliament was dissolved in March , 2011 , after a no @-@ confidence vote that deemed the Cabinet to be in contempt of parliament . In the federal election that followed , the Conservatives won a majority government , the first since the 2000 federal election ; the party won 166 seats , an increase of 23 seats from the October 2008 election . 
 Though Harper won his seat of Calgary @-@ Heritage in the October 19 , 2015 , federal election , the Conservative Party was defeated by the Liberal Party of Canada , led by Justin Trudeau , who was sworn @-@ in as Harper 's successor on November 4 , 2015 . Harper resigned as party leader on October 19 , 2015 , and the Conservative Party caucus chose an interim leader , Rona Ambrose , on November 5 , 2015 , to serve until a leadership election . Harper moved back to Calgary , Alberta , and commuted to Ottawa as an opposition backbench member of parliament . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Harper was born and raised in Leaside , Toronto , the first of three sons of Margaret ( née Johnston ) and Joseph Harris Harper , an accountant at Imperial Oil . The Harper family traces its ancestry back to Yorkshire , England , with Christopher Harper emigrating from Yorkshire to Nova Scotia in 1784 , where he later served as justice of the peace in the area that is now New Brunswick . 
 Harper attended <unk> Public School and , later , John G. <unk> Middle School and Richview Collegiate Institute , both in Central Etobicoke . He graduated in 1978 , and was a member of Richview Collegiate 's team on Reach for the Top , a television quiz show for Canadian high school students . Harper enrolled at the University of Toronto but dropped out after two months . He then moved to Edmonton , Alberta , where he found work in the mail room at Imperial Oil . Later , he advanced to work on the company 's computer systems . He took up post @-@ secondary studies again at the University of Calgary , where he completed a bachelor 's degree in economics in 1985 . He later returned there to earn a master 's degree in economics , completed in 1991 . Harper has kept strong links to the University of Calgary . Harper is the first prime minister since Joe Clark without a law degree . 
 = = Political beginnings = = 
 Harper became involved in politics as a member of his high school 's Young Liberals Club . He later changed his political allegiance because he disagreed with the National Energy Program ( NEP ) of Pierre Trudeau 's Liberal government . He became chief aide to Progressive Conservative MP Jim Hawkes in 1985 , but later became disillusioned with the party and the government of Brian Mulroney , especially the administration 's fiscal policy and its inability to fully revoke the NEP until 1986 . He left the PC Party that same year . 
 He was then recommended by the University of Calgary 's economist Bob Mansell to Preston Manning , the founder and leader of the Reform Party of Canada . At that time Harper " didn 't see himself as a politician " , Mansell told CBC News in 2002 , adding , " Politics was not his first love . " 
 Manning invited him to participate in the party , and Harper gave a speech at Reform 's 1987 founding convention in Winnipeg . He became the Reform Party 's Chief Policy Officer , and he played a major role in drafting the 1988 election platform . He is credited with creating Reform 's campaign slogan , " The West wants in ! " 
 Harper ran for the Canadian House of Commons in the 1988 federal election , appearing on the ballot as Steve Harper in Calgary West and losing by a wide margin to Hawkes , his former employer . After Reform candidate Deborah Grey was elected as the party 's first MP in a 1989 by @-@ election , Harper became Grey 's executive assistant , and was her chief adviser and speechwriter until 1993 . He remained prominent in the Reform Party 's national organization in his role as policy chief , encouraging the party to expand beyond its Western base , and arguing that strictly regional parties were at risk of being taken over by radical elements . He delivered a speech at the Reform Party 's 1991 national convention , in which he condemned extremist views . 
 Harper 's relationship with Manning became strained in 1992 , because of conflicting strategies over the Charlottetown Accord . Harper opposed the Accord on principle for ideological reasons , while Manning was initially more open to compromise . Harper also criticized Manning 's decision to hire Rick Anderson as an adviser , believing that Anderson was not sufficiently committed to the Reform Party 's principles . He resigned as policy chief in October , 1992 . 
 Harper stood for office again in the 1993 federal election , and defeated Jim Hawkes amid a significant Reform breakthrough in Western Canada . His campaign likely benefited from a $ 50 @,@ 000 print and television campaign organized by the National Citizens Coalition against Hawkes , although the NCC did not endorse Harper directly . 
 = = Reform MP ( 1993 – 97 ) = = 
 Harper emerged a prominent member of the Reform Party caucus . He was active on constitutional issues during his first parliament , and played a prominent role in drafting the Reform Party 's strategy for the 1995 Quebec referendum . A long @-@ standing opponent of centralized federalism , he stood with Preston Manning in Montreal to introduce a twenty @-@ point plan to " decentralize and modernize " Canada in the event of a " no " victory . Harper later argued that the " no " side 's narrow plurality was a worst @-@ case scenario , in that no @-@ one had won a mandate for change . 
 Harper has expressed socially conservative views on some issues . In 1994 , he opposed plans by federal Justice Minister Allan Rock to introduce spousal benefits for same @-@ sex couples . Citing the recent failure of a similar initiative in Ontario , he was quoted as saying , " What I hope they learn is not to get into it . There are more important social and economic issues , not to mention the unity question . " Harper also spoke against the possibility of the Canadian Human Rights Commission or the Supreme Court changing federal policy in these and other matters . 
 At the Reform Party 's 1994 policy convention , Harper was part of a small minority of delegates who voted against restricting the definition of marriage to " the union of one man and one woman " . He actually opposed both same @-@ sex marriage and mandated benefits for same @-@ sex couples , but argued that political parties should refrain from taking official positions on these and other " issues of conscience " . 
 Harper was the only Reform MP to support the creation of the Canadian Firearms Registry at second reading in 1995 , although he later voted against it at third reading stage . He said at the time that he initially voted for the registry because of a poll showing that most of his constituents supported it , and added that he changed his vote when a second poll showed the opposite result . It was reported in April , 1995 , that some Progressive Conservatives opposed to Jean Charest 's leadership wanted to remove both Charest and Manning , and unite the Reform and Progressive Conservative parties under Harper 's leadership . 
 Despite his prominent position in the party , Harper 's relationship with the Reform Party leadership was frequently strained . In early 1994 , he criticized a party decision to establish a personal expense account for Manning at a time when other Reform MPs had been asked to forego parliamentary perquisites . He was formally rebuked by the Reform executive council despite winning support from some MPs . His relationship with Manning grew increasingly fractious in the mid @-@ 1990s , and he pointedly declined to express any opinion on Manning 's leadership during a 1996 interview . This friction was indicative of a fundamental divide between the two men : Harper was strongly committed to conservative principles and opposed Manning 's inclinations toward populism , which Harper saw as leading to compromise on core ideological matters . 
 These tensions culminated in late 1996 when Harper announced that he would not be a candidate in the next federal election . He resigned his parliamentary seat on January 14 , 1997 , the same day that he was appointed as a vice @-@ president of the National Citizens Coalition ( NCC ) , a conservative think @-@ tank and advocacy group . He was promoted to NCC president later in the year . 
 In April , 1997 , Harper suggested that the Reform Party was drifting toward social conservatism and ignoring the principles of economic conservatism . The Liberal Party lost seats but managed to retain a narrow majority government in the 1997 federal election , while Reform made only modest gains . 
 = = Out of parliament = = 
 = = = 1997 – 2000 = = = 
 Soon after leaving parliament , Harper and Tom Flanagan co @-@ authored an opinion piece entitled " Our Benign Dictatorship " , which argued that the Liberal Party only retained power through a dysfunctional political system and a divided opposition . Harper and Flanagan argued that national conservative governments between 1917 and 1993 were founded on temporary alliances between Western populists and Quebec nationalists , and were unable to govern because of their fundamental contradictions . The authors called for an alliance of Canada 's conservative parties , and suggested that meaningful political change might require electoral reforms such as proportional representation . " Our Benign Dictatorship " also commended Conrad Black 's purchase of the Southam newspaper chain , arguing that his stewardship would provide for a " pluralistic " editorial view to counter the " monolithically liberal and feminist " approach of the previous management . 
 Harper remained active in constitutional issues . He was a prominent opponent of the Calgary Declaration on national unity in late 1997 , describing it as an " appeasement strategy " against Quebec nationalism . He called for federalist politicians to reject this strategy , and approach future constitutional talks from the position that " Quebec separatists are the problem and they need to be fixed " . In late 1999 , Harper called for the federal government to establish clear rules for any future Quebec referendum on sovereignty . Some have identified Harper 's views as an influence on the Chrétien government 's Clarity Act . 
 As president of the NCC from 1998 to 2002 , Harper launched an ultimately unsuccessful legal battle against federal election laws restricting third @-@ party advertising . He led the NCC in several campaigns against the Canadian Wheat Board , and supported Finance Minister Paul Martin 's 2000 tax cuts as a positive first step toward tax reform . 
 In 1997 , Harper delivered a controversial speech on Canadian identity to the Council for National Policy , a conservative American think tank . He made comments such as " Canada is a Northern European welfare state in the worst sense of the term , and very proud of it " , " if you 're like all Americans , you know almost nothing except for your own country . Which makes you probably knowledgeable about one more country than most Canadians " , and " the NDP [ New Democratic Party ] is kind of proof that the Devil lives and interferes in the affairs of men . " These statements were made public and criticized during the 2006 election . Harper argued that the speech was intended as humour , and not as serious analysis . 
 Harper considered campaigning for the Progressive Conservative Party leadership in 1998 , after Jean Charest left federal politics . Among those encouraging his candidacy were senior aides to Ontario Premier Mike Harris , including Tony Clement and Tom Long . He eventually decided against running , arguing that it would " burn bridges to those Reformers with whom I worked for many years " and prevent an alliance of right @-@ wing parties from taking shape . Harper was sceptical about the Reform Party 's United Alternative initiative in 1999 , arguing that it would serve to consolidate Manning 's hold on the party leadership . He also expressed concern that the UA would dilute Reform 's ideological focus . 
 = = = 2000 – 01 = = = 
 When the United Alternative created the Canadian Alliance in 2000 as a successor party to Reform , Harper predicted that Stockwell Day would defeat Preston Manning for the new party 's leadership . He expressed reservations about Day 's abilities , however , and accused Day of " [ making ] adherence to his social views a litmus test to determine whether you 're in the party or not " . Harper endorsed Tom Long for the leadership , arguing that Long was best suited to take support from the Progressive Conservative Party . When Day placed first on the first ballot , Harper said that the Canadian Alliance was shifting " more towards being a party of the religious right " . 
 After the death of Pierre Trudeau in 2000 , Harper wrote an editorial criticizing Trudeau 's policies as they affected Western Canada . He wrote that Trudeau " embraced the fashionable causes of his time , with variable enthusiasm and differing results " , but " took a pass " on the issues that " truly defined his century " . Harper subsequently accused Trudeau of promoting " unabashed socialism " , and argued that Canadian governments between 1972 and 2002 had restricted economic growth through " state corporatism " . 
 After the Canadian Alliance 's poor showing in the 2000 election , Harper joined with other Western conservatives in co @-@ authoring a document called the " Alberta Agenda " . The letter called on Alberta to reform publicly funded health care , replace the Canada Pension Plan with a provincial plan and replace the Royal Canadian Mounted Police with a provincial police force . It became known as the " firewall letter " , because it called on the provincial government to " build firewalls around Alberta " to stop the federal government from redistributing its wealth to less affluent regions . Alberta Premier Ralph Klein agreed with some of the letter 's recommendations , but distanced himself from the " firewall " comments . 
 Harper also wrote an editorial in late 2000 arguing that Alberta and the rest of Canada were " embark [ ing ] on divergent and potentially hostile paths to defining their country " . He said that Alberta had chosen the " best of Canada 's heritage — a combination of American enterprise and individualism with the British traditions of order and co @-@ operation " while Canada " appears content to become a second @-@ tier socialistic country [ ... ] led by a second @-@ world strongman appropriately suited for the task " . He also called for a " stronger and much more autonomous Alberta " , while rejecting calls for separatism . In the 2001 Alberta provincial election , Harper led the NCC in a " Vote Anything but Liberal " campaign . Some articles from this period described him as a possible successor to Klein . 
 Harper and the NCC endorsed a private school tax credit proposed by Ontario 's Progressive Conservative government in 2001 , arguing that it would " save about $ 7 @,@ 000 for each student who does not attend a union @-@ run public school " . Education Minister Janet <unk> criticized this , saying that her government 's intent was not to save money at the expense of public education . 
 Day 's leadership of the Canadian Alliance became increasingly troubled throughout the summer of 2001 , as several party MPs called for his resignation . In June , the National Post newspaper reported that former Reform MP Ian McClelland was organizing a possible leadership challenge on Harper 's behalf . Harper announced his resignation from the NCC presidency in August , 2001 , to prepare a campaign . 
 = = Canadian Alliance leadership , 2002 – 03 = = 
 Stockwell Day called a new Canadian Alliance leadership race for 2002 , and soon declared himself a candidate . Harper emerged as Day 's main rival , and declared his own candidacy on December 3 , 2001 . He eventually won the support of at least 28 Alliance MPs , including Scott Reid , James <unk> and Keith Martin . During the campaign , Harper reprised his earlier warnings against an alliance with Quebec nationalists , and called for his party to become the federalist option in Quebec . He argued that " the French language is not imperilled in Quebec " , and opposed " special status " for the province in the Canadian Constitution accordingly . He also endorsed greater provincial autonomy on Medicare , and said that he would not co @-@ operate with the Progressive Conservatives as long as they were led by Joe Clark . On social issues , Harper argued for " parental rights " to use corporal punishment against their children and supported raising the age of sexual consent . He described his potential support base as " similar to what George Bush tapped " . 
 The tone of the leadership contest turned hostile in February , 2002 . Harper described Day 's governance of the party as " amateurish " , while his campaign team argued that Day was attempting to win re @-@ election by building a narrow support base among different groups in the religious right . The Day campaign accused Harper of " attacking ethnic and religious minorities " . In early March , the two candidates had an especially fractious debate on CBC Newsworld . The leadership vote was held on March 20 , 2002 . Harper was elected on the first ballot with 55 % support , against 37 % for Day . Two other candidates split the remainder . 
 After winning the party leadership , Harper announced his intention to run for parliament in a by @-@ election in Calgary Southwest , recently vacated by Preston Manning . Ezra Levant had been chosen as the riding 's Alliance candidate and declared that he would not stand aside for Harper ; he later reconsidered . The Liberals did not field a candidate , following a parliamentary tradition of allowing opposition leaders to enter the House of Commons unopposed . The Progressive Conservative candidate , Jim Prentice , also chose to withdraw . Harper was elected without difficulty over New Democrat Bill Phipps , a former United Church of Canada moderator . Harper told a reporter during the campaign that he " despise [ d ] " Phipps , and declined to debate him . 
 Harper officially became Leader of the Opposition in May , 2002 . Later in the same month , he said that the Atlantic Provinces were trapped in " a culture of defeat " which had to be overcome , the result of policies designed by Liberal and Progressive Conservative governments . Many Atlantic politicians condemned the remark as patronizing and insensitive . The Legislature of Nova Scotia unanimously approved a motion condemning Harper 's comments , which were also criticized by Premier of New Brunswick Bernard Lord , federal Progressive Conservative leader Joe Clark and others . Harper refused to apologize , and said that much of Canada was trapped by the same " can 't @-@ do " attitude . 
 In March , 2003 , their speeches in favour gaining no traction in parliament , Harper and Stockwell Day co @-@ wrote a letter to The Wall Street Journal in which they condemned the Canadian government 's unwillingness to participate in the 2003 invasion of Iraq .

 On January 12 , 2004 , Harper announced his resignation as Leader of the Opposition , to run for the leadership of the Conservative Party of Canada . Harper was elected the first leader of the Conservative Party , with a first ballot majority against Belinda Stronach and Tony Clement on March 20 , 2004 . Harper 's victory included strong showings in Ontario , Quebec , and Atlantic Canada . 
 = = = 2004 federal election = = = 
 Harper led the Conservatives into the 2004 federal election . Initially , new Prime Minister Paul Martin held a large lead in polls , but this eroded because of infighting , <unk> ( a scandal that came as a result of a Government of Canada " sponsorship program " in the province of Quebec and involving the Liberal Party of Canada ) and other scandals surrounding his government . The Liberals attempted to counter this with an early election call , as this would give the Conservatives less time to consolidate their merger . 
 Martin 's weak performance in the leader 's debate , along with an unpopular provincial budget by Liberal Premier Dalton McGuinty in Ontario , moved the Conservatives into a lead for a time . However , comments by Conservative MPs , leaked press releases slandering the then prime minister , as well as controversial TV attack ads suggesting that the Conservatives would make Canada more like the United States , caused Harper 's party to lose some momentum . 
 Harper made an effort to appeal to voters in Quebec , a province where the Reform / Alliance side of the merged party had not done well . He was featured in several of the Tories ' French @-@ language campaign ads . 
 The Liberals were re @-@ elected to power with a minority government , with the Conservatives coming in second place . The Conservatives managed to make inroads into the Liberals ' Ontario stronghold , primarily in the province 's socially conservative central region . However , they were shut out of Quebec , marking the first time that a centre @-@ right party did not win any seats in that province . Harper , after some personal deliberation , decided to stay on as the party leader . Many credited him with bringing the Progressive Conservative Party and Canadian Alliance together in a short time to fight a close election . 
 = = = = Agreement with the BQ and the NDP = = = = 
 Two months after the federal election , Stephen Harper privately met Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe and New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton in a Montreal hotel . On September 9 , 2004 , the three signed a letter addressed to then @-@ Governor General Adrienne Clarkson , stating , 
 We respectfully point out that the opposition parties , who together constitute a majority in the House , have been in close consultation . We believe that , should a request for dissolution arise this should give you cause , as constitutional practice has determined , to consult the opposition leaders and consider all of your options before exercising your constitutional authority . 
 On the same day the letter was written , the three party leaders held a joint press conference at which they expressed their intent to co @-@ operate on changing parliamentary rules , and to request that the Governor General consult with them before deciding to call an election . At the news conference , Harper said " It is the Parliament that 's supposed to run the country , not just the largest party and the single leader of that party . That 's a criticism I 've had and that we 've had and that most Canadians have had for a long , long time now so this is an opportunity to start to change that . " However , at the time , Harper and the two other opposition leaders denied trying to form a coalition government . Harper said , " This is not a coalition , but this is a co @-@ operative effort . " 
 One month later , on October 4 , Mike Duffy , who was later appointed as a Conservative senator by Harper , said " It is possible that you could change prime minister without having an election " , and that some Conservatives wanted Harper to temporarily become prime minister without holding an election . The next day Layton walked out on talks with Harper and Duceppe , accusing them of trying to replace Paul Martin with Harper as prime minister . Both Bloc and Conservative officials denied Layton 's accusations . 
 On March 26 , 2011 , Duceppe stated that Harper had tried to form a coalition government with the Bloc and NDP in response to Harper 's allegations that the Liberals may form a coalition with the Bloc and the NDP . 
 = = = Leader of the Opposition = = = 
 The Conservative Party 's first policy convention was held from March 17 – 19 , 2005 , in Montreal . Harper had been rumoured to be shifting his ideology closer to that of a Blue Tory , and many thought he 'd wanted to move the party 's policies closer to the centre . Any opposition to abortion or bilingualism was dropped from the Conservative platform . Harper received an 84 % endorsement from delegates in the leadership review . 
 Despite the party 's move to the centre , the party began a concerted drive against same @-@ sex marriage . Harper was criticized by a group of law professors for arguing that the government could override the provincial court rulings on same @-@ sex marriage without using the " notwithstanding clause " , a provision of Canada 's Charter of Rights and Freedoms . He also argued , in general , for lower taxes , an elected Senate , a tougher stance on crime , and closer relations with the United States . 
 Following the April 2005 release of Jean Brault 's damaging testimony at the Gomery Commission , implicating the Liberals in the scandal , opinion polls placed the Conservatives ahead of Liberals . The Conservatives had earlier abstained from the vote on the 2005 budget to avoid forcing an election . With the collapse in Liberal support and a controversial NDP amendment to the budget , the party exerted significant pressure on Harper to bring down the government . In May , Harper announced that the government had lost the " moral authority to govern " . Shortly thereafter , the Conservatives and Bloc Québécois united to defeat the government on a vote that some considered to be either a confidence motion or else a motion requiring an immediate test of the confidence of the House . The Martin government did not accept this interpretation and argued that vote had been on a procedural motion , although they also indicated that they would bring forward their revised budget for a confidence vote the following week . Ultimately , the effort to bring down the Government failed following the decision of Conservative MP Belinda Stronach to cross the floor to the Liberal Party . The vote on the NDP amendment to the budget tied , and with the Speaker of the House voting to continue debate , the Liberals stayed in power . At the time , some considered the matter to be a constitutional crisis . 
 Harper was also criticized for supporting his caucus colleague MP <unk> Grewal . Grewal had produced tapes of conversations with Tim Murphy , Paul Martin 's chief of staff , in which Grewal claimed he had been offered a cabinet position in exchange for his defection . 
 The Liberals ' support dropped after the first report from the Gomery Commission was issued . On November 24 , 2005 , Harper introduced a motion of non @-@ confidence on the Liberal government , telling the House of Commons " that this government has lost the confidence of the House of Commons and needs to be removed . " As the Liberals had lost NDP support in the house by refusing to accept an NDP plan to prevent health care privatization , the no @-@ confidence motion was passed by a vote of 171 – 133 . It was the first time that a Canadian government had been toppled by a straight motion of non @-@ confidence proposed by the opposition . As a result , parliament was dissolved and a general election was scheduled for January 23 , 2006 . 
 On February 27 , 2008 , allegations surfaced that two Conservative Party officials offered terminally ill , Independent MP Chuck Cadman a million @-@ dollar life insurance policy in exchange for his vote to bring down the Liberal government in a May , 2005 , budget vote . If the story had been proved true , the actions may have been grounds for charges as a criminal offence since , under the Criminal Code of Canada , it is illegal to bribe an MP . 
 When asked by Vancouver journalist Tom <unk> about the alleged life insurance offer then @-@ opposition leader Stephen Harper states on an audio tape " I don 't know the details . I know there were discussions " and goes on to say " The offer to Chuck was that it was only to replace financial considerations he might lose due to an election " . Harper also stated that he had told the Conservative party representatives that they were unlikely to succeed . " I told them they were wasting their time . I said Chuck had made up his mind . " In February , 2008 , the Royal Canadian Mounted Police ( RCMP ) investigated the allegations that Section 119 's provisions on bribery and corruption in the Criminal Code had been violated . The RCMP concluded their investigation stating that there was no evidence for pressing charges . 
 Harper denied any wrongdoing and subsequently filed a civil libel suit against the Liberal Party . Because libel laws do not apply to statements made in the House of Commons , the basis of the lawsuit was that statements made by Liberal party members outside the House and in articles which appeared on the Liberal party web site made accusations that Harper had committed a criminal act . 
 The audio expert hired by Harper to prove that the tape containing the evidence was doctored reported that the latter part of the tape was recorded over , but the tape was unaltered where Harper 's voice said " I don 't know the details , I know that , um , there were discussions , um , but this is not for publication ? " and goes on to say he " didn 't know the details " when asked if he knew anything about the alleged offer to Cadman . 
 = = = 2006 federal election = = = 
 The Conservatives began the campaign period with a policy @-@ per @-@ day strategy , contrary to the Liberal plan of holding off major announcements until after the Christmas holidays , so Harper dominated media coverage for the first weeks of the election . Though his party showed only modest movement in the polls , Harper 's personal numbers , which had always significantly trailed those of his party , began to rise . In response , the Liberals launched negative ads targeting Harper , similar to their attacks in the 2004 election . However , their tactics were not sufficient to erode the Conservative 's advantage , although they did manage to close what had been a ten @-@ point advantage in public opinion . As Harper 's personal numbers rose , polls found he was now considered not only more trustworthy , but a better choice for prime minister than Martin . 
 Immediately prior to the Christmas break , in a faxed letter to NDP candidate Judy <unk> @-@ Leis , the Commissioner of the RCMP , Giuliano <unk> announced the RCMP had opened a criminal investigation into her complaint that it appeared Liberal Finance Minister Ralph Goodale 's office had leaked information leading to insider trading before making an important announcement on the taxation of income trusts . On December 27 , 2005 , the RCMP confirmed that information in a press release . At the conclusion of the investigation , Serge Nadeau , a top Finance Department civil servant , was charged with criminal breach of trust . No charges were laid against then Finance Minister Ralph Goodale . 
 The election gave Harper 's Conservatives the largest number of seats in the House , although not enough for a majority government , and shortly after midnight on January 24 , Martin conceded defeat . Later that day , Martin informed Governor General Michaëlle Jean that he would resign as prime minister , and at 6 : 45 p.m. Jean asked Harper to form a government . Harper was sworn in as Canada 's 22nd prime minister on February 6 , 2006 . 
 In his first address to parliament as head of government , Harper opened by paying tribute to the Queen of Canada , Elizabeth II , and her " lifelong dedication to duty and self @-@ sacrifice . " He also said before the Canada @-@ UK Chamber of Commerce that Canada and the United Kingdom were joined by " the golden circle of the Crown , which links us all together with the majestic past that takes us back to the Tudors , the Plantagenets , the Magna Carta , habeas corpus , petition of rights , and English common law . " Journalist Graham Fraser said in the Toronto Star that Harper 's speech was " one of the most monarchist speeches a Canadian prime minister has given since John Diefenbaker . " An analysis by Michael D. <unk> suggests a political realignment may be underway based on the continuance of Harper 's government . 
 After the election , the Conservative party were charged with improper election spending , in a case that became known as the In and Out scandal . It dragged on for years , but in 2012 they took a plea deal , admitting both improper spending and falsifying records to hide it .

 On October 14 , 2008 , after a 5 @-@ week @-@ long campaign , the Conservative Party won a federal election and increased its number of seats in parliament to 143 , up from 127 at the dissolution of the previous parliament ; however , the actual popular vote among Canadians dropped slightly by 167 @,@ 494 votes . As a result of the lowest voter turnout in Canadian electoral history , this represented only 22 % of eligible Canadian voters , the lowest level of support of any winning party in Canadian history . Meanwhile , the number of opposition Liberal MPs fell from 95 to 77 seats . 155 MPs are required to form a majority government in Canada 's 308 @-@ seat parliament .

 On December 4 , 2008 , Harper asked Governor General Michaëlle Jean to prorogue parliament to avoid a vote of confidence scheduled for the following Monday , becoming the first Canadian prime minister to do so . The request was granted by Jean , and the prorogation lasted until January 26 , 2009 . The opposition coalition dissolved shortly after , with the Conservatives winning a Liberal supported confidence vote on January 29 , 2009 .

 On December 30 , 2009 , Harper announced that he would request the governor general to prorogue parliament again , effective immediately on December 30 , 2009 , during the 2010 Winter Olympics and lasting until March 3 , 2010 . Harper stated that this was necessary for Canada 's economic plan . Jean granted the request . In an interview with CBC News , Prince Edward Island Liberal Member of Parliament Wayne Easter accused the Prime Minister of " shutting democracy down " . Tom Flanagan , Harper 's University of Calgary mentor and former chief of staff , also questioned Harper 's reasoning for prorogation , stating that " I think the government 's talking points haven 't been entirely credible " and that the government 's explanation of proroguing was " skirting the real issue — which is the harm the opposition parties are trying to do to the Canadian Forces " regarding the Canadian Afghan detainee issue . Small demonstrations took place on January 23 in 64 Canadian cities and towns and five cities in other countries . A Facebook protest group attracted over 20 @,@ 000 members . 
 A poll released by Angus Reid on January 7 , found that 53 % of respondents were opposed to the prorogation , while 19 % supported it . 38 % believed Harper used the prorogation to curtail the Afghan detainee inquiry , while 23 % agreed with Harper 's explanation that the prorogation was necessary economically .

 Harper , on January 29 , 2010 , advised the Governor General to appoint new Conservative senators to fill five vacancies in the Senate , one each for Quebec , Newfoundland and Labrador , and New Brunswick , and two for Ontario .

 On May 2 , 2011 , after a five @-@ week campaign , Harper led the Conservatives to their third consecutive election victory — the first time a centre @-@ right party has accomplished this in half a century .

This resulted in the first centre @-@ right majority government since the Progressive Conservatives won what would be their last majority in 1988 . The Conservatives also received a greater number of total votes than in 2008 . 
 The election ended five years of minority governments , made the New Democratic Party the Official Opposition for the first time , relegated the Liberals to third place for the first time , brought Canada 's first Green Party Member of Parliament , and reduced the Bloc Québécois from 47 to 4 seats . 
 After the election , the Conservatives were accused of cheating in the <unk> scandal , mainly suppressing votes by directing voters to bogus polling stations . There were complaints in 247 of Canada 's 308 ridings , but only one person was charged ; Conservative staffer Michael Sona was convicted and jailed .

 Under the Canada Elections Act , a general election had to take place no later than October 19 , 2015 . On August 2 , at Harper 's request , Governor General David Johnson dropped the writs of election for October 19 . In that election , Harper 's Conservative Party was defeated by Justin Trudeau 's Liberals , and became the Official Opposition , having won only 99 out of 338 seats where after the previous election they had 166 of 308 . This was mainly because of a collapse of Conservative support in southern Ontario , a region that swung heavily to them in 2011 . They lost all of their seats in Toronto , and won only three seats in the Greater Toronto Area . They were also shut out of Atlantic Canada — the first time in decades that there will be no centre @-@ right MPs from that region . Harper was reelected in Calgary Heritage , essentially a reconfigured version of his former riding . 
 Hours after conceding defeat on election night , Harper resigned as leader of the Conservative Party , though for the time being he will remain in the new parliament as a backbencher . Harper resigned as Prime Minister during a meeting with Governor General David Johnston , who accepted the resignation , after which Johnston invited Trudeau to form a government on November 4 , 2015 . 
 = = Conservative backbencher and departure from politics = = 
 Harper returned to Ottawa as a Conservative backbencher and addressed a meeting of the Conservative caucus that included defeated MPs in November . Interim leader Rona Ambrose stated that Harper would be in the House for key votes as the member for Calgary Heritage , but had earned the right to keep a low profile after his service as Prime Minister . 
 Harper announced in May 2016 that he plans to resign his seat in the House of Commons during the summer before the fall session of parliament . In the same month , Harper delivered a speech to the 2016 Conservative party convention where his accomplishments as party leader and prime minister were honoured by the party . 
 In December 2015 , Harper had set up Harper & Associates Consulting Inc . , a corporation that lists him a director alongside close associates Ray Novak and Jeremy Hunt .

 After sidestepping the political landmine for most of the first year of his time as prime minister , much as all the post @-@ Charlottetown Accord prime ministers had done , Harper 's hand was forced to reopen the Quebec sovereignty debate after the opposition Bloc Québécois were to introduce a motion in the House that called for recognition of Quebec as a " nation " . On November 22 , 2006 , Harper introduced his own motion to recognize that " the Québécois form a nation within a united Canada . " Five days later , Harper 's motion passed , with a margin of 266 – 16 ; all federalist parties , and the Bloc Québécois , supported it . 
 In 2004 , Harper said " the Upper House remains a dumping ground for the favoured cronies of the prime minister " . Between 2006 and 2008 , by which time Harper was prime minister , he did not put any names to the Governor General for appointment to the Senate , resulting in 16 Senate vacancies by the October 2008 election . The one exception was Michael Fortier . When Harper took office , he directed the Governor General to appoint Michael Fortier to both the Senate and the Cabinet , arguing the government needed representation from the city of Montreal . Although there is a precedent for this action in Canadian history , the appointment led to criticism from opponents who claimed Harper was reneging on his push for an elected Senate . In 2008 , Fortier gave up his Senate seat and sought election as a Member of Parliament ( MP ) , but was defeated by a large margin by the incumbent Bloc Québécois MP . 
 After the October , 2008 , election , Harper again named Senate reform as a priority . By December , he recommended the appointment of 18 senators and , in 2009 , provided an additional nine people for appointment as senators . Many of those appointed had close ties with the Conservative Party , including the campaign manager of the Conservative Party , Doug Finley . Critics accused Harper of hypocrisy ( the Liberals coined the term " <unk> " ) . Conservative Senator Bert Brown defended Harper 's appointments and said " the only way [ the Senate ] ' s ever been filled is by having people that are loyal to the prime minister who 's appointing them . " 
 = = = Economic management = = = 
 By January , 2010 , the federal deficit had risen to $ 36 billion . It is claimed by certain pundits that the Conservatives raised Canada 's deficit to the largest in the country 's history . At the same time , Canada had the lowest debt @-@ to @-@ GDP ratio in the G7 economies . The Economist magazine stated that Canada had come out the recession stronger than any other rich country in the G7 . In 2013 , Canada came out with Global Markets Action Plan to generate employment opportunities for Canadians . 
 = = = 2011 Census = = = 
 Ahead of the Canada 2011 Census , the government announced that the long @-@ form questionnaire ( which collects detailed demographic information ) will no longer be mandatory . According to Minister of Industry Tony Clement , the change was made because of privacy @-@ related complaints and after consulting with Statistics Canada . However , Canada 's privacy commissioner reported only receiving three complaints between 1995 and 2010 , according to a report in the Toronto Sun . 
 Munir Sheikh , Canada 's Chief Statistician appointed on Harper 's advice , resigned on July 21 , 2010 , in protest of the government 's change in policy . Ivan <unk> , the former Chief Statistician of Canada , criticized the government 's decision , saying that those who are most vulnerable ( such as the poor , new immigrants , and aboriginals ) are least likely to respond to a voluntary form , which weakens information about their demographic . 
 The move was opposed by some governmental and non @-@ governmental organizations . Federation of Canadian Municipalities ; City of Toronto ; Canadian Jewish Congress ; Evangelical Fellowship of Canada ; Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops ; Canadian Medical Association ; Statistical Society of Canada ; the American Statistical Association ; and Registered Nurses Association of Ontario all opposed the change . However , the Fraser Institute supported the change . The provincial governments of Ontario , Quebec , New Brunswick , Prince Edward Island , and Manitoba , also opposed the change .

 Under Stephen Harper , the annual budget of Veterans Affairs Canada increased from $ 2 @.@ 85 billion in 2005 – 2006 to $ 3 @.@ 55 billion in 2014 – 2015 , while the quantity of veterans served has declined from 219 @,@ 152 in 2008 – 2009 to 199 @,@ 154 in 2015 . Since 2006 , Veterans Affairs Canada returned $ 1 @.@ 13 billion in unspent funding back to the federal treasury . Nine Veterans Affairs offices were closed between 2012 and 2015 , and 900 positions were phased out from the department since 2009 . Former Minister of Veterans Affairs Erin O 'Toole stated that the closures were made to modernize Veterans Affairs , by moving services online and to Service Canada locations . 
 In 2006 , Harper implemented the New Veterans Charter passed with all party support by the previous Liberal government . This charter turned the previous lifetime veteran pension system into one of lump sum payments . Under Harper , the Canadian government spent $ 700 , 000 fighting a class @-@ action lawsuit brought by a group of wounded Afghan veterans who argued that the new Charter was discriminatory . In the statement of defence filed by the federal lawyers , they argued that the government has no obligation and no " social contract " with veterans . 
 = = Foreign policy = = 
 During his term , Harper has dealt with many foreign policy issues relating to the United States , War on Terror , Arab @-@ Israeli conflict , free trade , China and Africa . 
 He has reduced defence spending to 1 % of Canadian GDP . 
 In 2009 , Harper visited China . During the visit Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao publicly scolded Harper for not visiting earlier , pointing out that " this is the first meeting between the Chinese premier and a Canadian prime minister in almost five years " ; Harper in response said that , " it 's almost been five years since we had yourself or President Hu in our country . " In 2008 , former prime minister Jean Chrétien had criticized Harper for missing opening ceremonies for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing ; in response , Dimitri <unk> , a spokesperson for Harper , called the remarks hypocritical , pointing out that Chrétien " attended one of six Olympic opening ceremonies during his 13 years as prime minister . 
 On September 11 , 2007 , Harper visited Australia and addressed its parliament . 
 On January 20 , 2014 , Harper addressed the Israeli Knesset in Givat Ram , Jerusalem . 
 During mid @-@ 2015 , Harper repeatedly voiced his opinion that Russia should be excluded from association with the G7 group of nations because of Russia 's support for Russian @-@ speaking Ukrainian dissidents . On June 8 , Harper said , " Mr. Putin . . . has no place at the [ G7 ] table , and I don 't believe there 's any leader who would defend <unk> having a place . " . 
 Michael Ignatieff criticized Harper for cutting foreign aid to Africa by $ 700 million , falling short of the UN Millennium Development Goals , and cutting eight African countries from the list of priority aid recipients .

 On March 11 and 12 , 2006 , Harper made a surprise trip to Afghanistan , where Canadian Forces personnel had been deployed as part of the NATO @-@ led International Security Assistance Force since late 2001 , to visit troops in theatre as a show of support for their efforts , and as a demonstration of the government 's commitment to reconstruction and stability in the region . Harper 's choice of a first foreign visit was closely guarded from the press until his arrival in Afghanistan ( citing security concerns ) , and is seen as marking a significant change in relationship between the government and the military . Harper returned to Afghanistan on May 22 , 2007 , in a surprise two @-@ day visit which included visiting Canadian troops at the forward operating base at Ma <unk> Ghar , located 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) south of Kandahar , making Harper the first prime minister to have visited the front lines of a combat operation . 
 = = = Israeli and Jewish affairs = = = 
 Harper has shown admiration for the State of Israel since the early 1990s . Friends and colleagues describe his views as being the product of thinking and reading deeply about the Middle East . " Toronto Rabbi Philip <unk> , who accompanied Harper to Israel " in 2014 said , " I sense that [ Harper ] sees Israel as a manifestation of justice and a righting of historical wrongs , especially in light of the Holocaust . " 
 At the outset of the 2006 Israel – Lebanon conflict , Harper defended Israel 's " right to defend itself " and described its military campaign in Lebanon as a " measured " response , arguing that Hezbollah 's release of kidnapped Israel Defense Force ( IDF ) soldiers would be the key to ending the conflict . Speaking of the situation in both Lebanon and Gaza on July 18 , Harper said he wanted " not just a ceasefire , but a resolution " but such a thing would not happen until Hezbollah and Hamas recognize Israel 's right to exist . Harper blamed Hezbollah for all the civilian deaths . He asserted that Hezbollah 's objective is to destroy Israel through violence . 
 The media noted that Harper did not allow reporters opportunities to ask him questions on his position . Some Canadians , including many Arab and Lebanese Canadians , criticized Harper 's description of Israel 's response . 
 In December , 2008 , the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations recognized Harper 's support for Israel with its inaugural International Leadership Award , pointing out Harper 's decision to boycott the Durban II anti @-@ racism conference , and his government 's " support for Israel and [ its ] efforts at the U.N. against incitement and ... the <unk> [ of Israel ] " . 
 In March , 2009 , Harper spoke at a Parliament Hill ceremony organized by Chabad @-@ Lubavitch to honour the Jewish victims of the 2008 Mumbai attacks , which included an attack on the Nariman House . He expressed condolences over the murder at Chabad 's Mumbai centre of Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and his wife Rivka . Harper described the killings as " affronts to the values that unite all civilized people " . Harper added that the quick instalment of a new rabbi at the Chabad centre in Mumbai as a signal that the Jewish people will " never bow to violence and hatred " . 
 In 2010 , Canada lost a bid for a seat on the UN Security Council . While initially blaming the loss on his rival Ignatieff , Harper later said that it was due to his pro @-@ Israeli stance . Harper then said that he would take a pro @-@ Israeli stance , no matter what the political cost to Canada . Ignatieff criticized Harper 's stance as a " mistake " , saying Canada would be better able to defend Israel through the Security Council than from the sidelines and pointed out that it is the Security Council that will determine if sanctions are imposed on Iran . Ignatieff also accused Harper of steering the discussion away from implementing the two @-@ state solution , and instead rendering all discussion into a competition " about who is Israel 's best friend " .

 Shortly after being congratulated by George W.

Harper 's first meeting as prime minister with the US president occurred at the end of March , 2006 . 
 The government received American news coverage during the Democratic Party 's 2008 presidential primaries after the details of a conversation between Barack Obama 's economic advisor <unk> Goolsbee , and Canadian diplomat Georges Rioux were revealed . Reportedly Goolsbee was reassuring the Canadians that Obama 's comments on potentially renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) were more political rhetoric than actual policy . The accuracy of these reports has been debated by both the Obama campaign and the Canadian Government . The news came at a key time nearing the Ohio and Texas primaries , where perceptions among Democratic voters was ( and is ) that the benefits of the NAFTA agreement are dubious . Thus the appearance that Obama was not being completely forthright was attacked by his opponent Hillary Clinton . 
 ABC News reported that Harper 's chief of staff , Ian Brodie was responsible for the details reaching the hands of the media . Harper has denied that Brodie was responsible for the leak , and launched an investigation to find the source . The Opposition , as well as Democratic strategist Bob <unk> , criticized the Government on the issue , stating they were trying to help the Republicans by helping Hillary Clinton win the Democratic nomination instead of Obama . They also alleged the leak would hurt relations with the United States if Obama ever were to become President . Obama was elected President in November . In February , Obama made his first foreign visit , as president , to Ottawa , in which he affirmed support for free trade with Canada , as well as complimenting Canada on its involvement in Afghanistan . 
 = = Environmental policy = = 
 Since Harper 's government took office in 2006 , Canadian greenhouse gas emissions fell from 749 to 726 Mt of carbon dioxide equivalent ( CO2 eq ) . From 1993 until 2006 , during the previous Liberal government greenhouse gas emissions increased from 600 to 749 Mt of CO2 eq . The reduction corresponded Canada 's decreased economic output during the Great Recession and emissions began increasing slightly in 2010 , when the economy began recovering . Other significant factors in Canada 's decreased emissions during Prime Minister Harper 's time in office are initiatives such as the carbon tax in British Columbia , the cap and trade system in Quebec , Ontario 's coal @-@ fired power plants , and the Clean Air Regulatory Agenda which regulates emissions for automobiles and light trucks . In 2006 , Canada 's Clean Air and Climate Change Act was introduced to address air pollution as well as greenhouse gas emissions ; it never became law . In 2006 , the Clean Air Regulatory Agenda ( <unk> ) was established to " support Government of Canada efforts to reduce greenhouse gas ( GHG ) and air pollutant emissions in order to improve the environment and health of Canadians " . In December , 2011 , the Harper administration announced that Canada would formally withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol . Then Environment Minister Peter Kent stated , " It 's now clear that Kyoto is not the path forward for a global solution to climate change . In December , 2012 , Canada became the first signatory to formally withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol . /

First , Harper bypassed parliament 's supreme court selection panel , which was supposed to produce a list of three candidates for him to choose from .

In response , Harper referred the criteria issue to the supreme court , as well as the question of whether the government 's amendments to the criteria were constitutional . The supreme court subsequently ruled in Reference re Supreme Court Act , ss . 5 and 6 that the Nadon appointment was invalid , and that the federal government could not unilaterally amend the Supreme Court Act . Harper subsequently nominated Clement Gascon to the position instead .

 = New York @-@ class battleship = 
 The New York class of battleship was a class of ships designed and constructed by the United States Navy between 1908 and 1914 . The two ships of the class , New York and Texas , each saw extensive service beginning in the occupation of Veracruz , World War I , and World War II . 
 Designed as a more heavily armed improvement over the previous Wyoming class , the New York class was the first battleship to feature the 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) / 45 caliber gun , but was one of the last battleship classes designed with several features , including a five @-@ turret layout and coal for fuel . The class also suffered several deficiencies such as a lack of anti @-@ aircraft weaponry and armor layout , which were addressed with the subsequent Nevada class . Because of these deficiencies , both ships saw several extensive overhauls over the course of their careers which greatly changed their profiles . 
 Both New York and Texas entered service in 1914 and immediately served in the occupation of Veracruz , and service reinforcing the Royal Navy 's Grand Fleet in the North Sea during World War I , during which time New York is believed to have sunk a U @-@ boat in an accidental collision . Both ships undertook numerous training exercises and overhauls during the interwar era , and joined the Neutrality Patrol at the beginning of World War II . <unk> by more advanced battleships in service , both ships served primarily as convoy escorts and naval artillery during the war . New York supported Operation Torch in North Africa , undertook convoy patrols and training in the Atlantic , and supported the Battle of Iwo Jima and the Battle of Okinawa . Texas supported Operation Torch , Operation Overlord , the bombardment of Cherbourg , Operation Dragoon and the battles at Iwo Jima and Okinawa . Following the war , New York was used as a target ship in Operation Crossroads and sunk as a target in 1948 , while Texas was converted into a museum ship , and remains permanently moored in San Jacinto State Park today . 
 = = Background = = 
 The New York class was the fifth of 11 separate classes planned by the United States Navy between 1906 and 1919 , a total of 29 battleships and 6 battlecruisers . Virtually the entire American battle line was being designed from pre @-@ dreadnought experience and observation of foreign designs . The design of the New York @-@ class battleship originated in the 1908 Newport Conference , which resulted in a new method for battleship design , with the General Board taking a more active role in the design process of ships , and the navy 's Board on Construction would implement the design instead of creating it . While the New York class was mostly designed by the Board on Construction , lessons learned on the class allowed the General Board to take the lead on the following Nevada @-@ class battleships . 
 The Newport Conference established a general consensus among leaders that US Navy ships should carry larger batteries in response to the increasing caliber of battleships in other countries , notably the BL 13 @.@ 5 inch Mk V naval gun which had been introduced by the Royal Navy 's Orion class , as well as the German Navy 's shift from 28 @-@ centimetre ( 11 in ) to 30 @.@ 5 @-@ centimetre ( 12 in ) guns . There was debate at the time as to whether the Florida @-@ class battleships , laid down in 1909 , should carry heavier armament than the 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) / 45 caliber Mark 5 gun . Ultimately , on 30 March 1909 , US Congress approved the construction of two " Design 601 " battleships , also known as Battleship 1910 with six 12 @-@ inch turrets , which the General Board had selected over two 14 @-@ inch designs in 1909 . These would become the Wyoming class . At the same time , the General Board began planning for the next class of ships , and on 21 April 1909 decided on two battleships with similar sizes , and after some debate about main guns approval of two battleships was granted on 24 June in 1910 . In 1911 the US Senate 's Naval Affairs Committee suggested reducing the size of the ships as part of a $ 24 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 budget reduction , but Secretary of the Navy George von Lengerke Meyer fought to keep the original design and the ships were not altered . 
 The class is generally referred to as the New York class , but it is also occasionally called the Texas class because New York was completed several months after her sister , Texas . 
 = = Design = = 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 As designed , the ships had a standard displacement of 27 @,@ 000 long tons ( 27 @,@ 433 t ) and a full @-@ load displacement of 28 @,@ 367 long tons ( 28 @,@ 822 t ) . They were 573 ft ( 175 m ) in length overall , 565 ft ( 172 m ) at the waterline , and had a beam of 95 ft 6 in ( 29 @.@ 11 m ) and a draft of 28 feet 6 inches ( 8 @.@ 69 m ) . The ships underwent significant changes and increases in armor and armament over their operational lives . Following her fourth and final refit in 1943 , New York increased her displacement to 29 @,@ 340 long tons ( 29 @,@ 810 t ) standard and 34 @,@ 000 long tons ( 35 @,@ 000 t ) full @-@ load . The final refit for Texas came in 1945 , after which she displaced 29 @,@ 500 long tons ( 30 @,@ 000 t ) standard and 32 @,@ 000 long tons ( 33 @,@ 000 t ) at full load . As designed , the ships had a crew complement consisted of 1 @,@ 042 officers and enlisted men . By 1945 , Texas was carrying 1 @,@ 723 officers and enlisted men with the addition of crews for additional weapons as well as a new complement of Marines . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The main battery of the class consisted of ten 14 @-@ inch / 45 caliber guns , arrayed in five twin turrets designated 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 . As constructed , these turrets had an elevation of 15 degrees , but this was increased to 30 degrees during an overhaul in 1940 – 1941 . The class was the last to feature a turret mounted amidships . In 1910 the US Navy 's Bureau of Ordnance had successfully designed and tested its 14 @-@ inch naval gun . The gun proved to have remarkable accuracy and uniformity of pattern . The New York class was the fifth class of US dreadnought battleship design created , and work had already started on the sixth design , the Nevada class . By 1910 no US dreadnought class battleship had yet hit the water , as all were either at some stage of building or in design . Virtually the entire US Navy battle line was being designed by drawing on experience from pre @-@ dreadnought designs or from observation of foreign battleship designs . 
 As built , both ships also carried 21 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) / 51 caliber guns arrayed ten to a side with one in the stern , primarily for defense against destroyers and torpedo boats . Many of the 5 @-@ inch guns were poor in accuracy in rough seas due to being mounted near the ends of the ship and below the main deck . The ships were not designed with anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) defense in mind , and with the development of naval aviation , this was seen as a serious drawback to the class . The New York class was the first US battleship to mount anti @-@ aircraft guns , with two 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) / 50 caliber guns mounted on platforms on top of the boat cranes of Texas in 1916 . In 1918 , the secondary armament was reduced to 16 5 @-@ inch / 51 caliber guns , eight to a side , as the guns near the ends of the ship were difficult to work in any kind of sea . When both ships were refitted 1925 @-@ 26 , AA defense was increased with eight 3 @-@ inch / 50 caliber guns arrayed four to a side . Six of the 16 remaining 5 @-@ inch guns were relocated higher in the ship to new casemates on the main deck . The New York class also initially featured four torpedo tubes , 1 each on the port side bow and stern and starboard bow and stern , for the Bliss @-@ Leavitt Mark 3 torpedo , instead of the previous two , because of advances in torpedo performance increasing the prominence of the weapon . The torpedo rooms held 12 torpedoes total , plus 12 naval defense mines . However , the torpedo tubes were removed in the 1925 @-@ 26 refit . 
 Magazine and machinery spaces were enclosed in the protected hull . Magazine volume was reduced for increased machinery , with each magazine accommodating 75 to 80 shells and charges , while more shells were carried in their turrets and handling rooms . 
 In 1937 eight 1 @.@ 1 @-@ inch ( 28 mm ) / 75 caliber AA guns in two quadruple mounts were added to improve the light AA armament . The ships were more extensively refitted with large amounts of light AA guns at the expense of the 5 @-@ inch / 51 caliber guns in 1942 , as the attack on Pearl Harbor had shown pre @-@ war light AA armament to be inadequate . The 1 @.@ 1 inch quad mounts were removed and 24 Bofors 40 mm guns were added in six quadruple mounts ( later increased to 40 guns ) , while 42 Oerlikon 20 mm guns in single mounts were also added . The 3 @-@ inch AA gun armament was increased to 10 guns , while the 5 @-@ inch gun armament was reduced to 6 guns .

 The ships continued the armor suite of the Wyoming class with minor improvements . The deck armor scheme would continue to remain distinctly inferior to the succeeding Nevada class with their all or nothing armor scheme . However the leap forward in range provided by improved fire control was not yet envisioned and had it been there would not have been time to include it within the current design . The ship provided a 12 in ( 305 mm ) belt tapering to 10 in ( 254 mm ) and 6 @.@ 5 in ( 165 mm ) casemate armor with internal partitioning . The New York class was the first to incorporate an armored central plotting room below decks , but atop the protective deck , and enclosed in a thin box of splinter armor . 
 Armor on the New York class consisted of belt armor from 10 to 12 inches thick . Their lower casemates had between 9 in ( 229 mm ) and 11 in ( 279 mm ) of armor , and their upper casemate had 6 in ( 152 mm ) of armor . Deck armor was 2 in ( 51 mm ) thick , and turret armor was 14 inches on the face , 4 in ( 102 mm ) on the top , 2 inches on the sides , and 8 in ( 203 mm ) on the rear . Armor on her barbettes was between 10 and 12 inches . Conning towers were protected by 12 inches of armor , with 4 inches of armor on the tops . In all , the armor totaled 261 @.@ 67 t ( 257 @.@ 54 long tons ; 288 @.@ 44 short tons ) on the upper casemate , 1 @,@ 680 @.@ 33 t ( 1 @,@ 653 @.@ 79 long tons ; 1 @,@ 852 @.@ 25 short tons ) on the lower casemate , 1 @,@ 549 @.@ 16 t ( 1 @,@ 524 @.@ 69 long tons ; 1 @,@ 707 @.@ 66 short tons ) along the belt , 127 @.@ 42 t ( 125 @.@ 41 long tons ; 140 @.@ 46 short tons ) on the bulkheads , 1 @,@ 322 @.@ 11 t ( 1 @,@ 301 @.@ 23 long tons ; 1 @,@ 457 @.@ 38 short tons ) on the splinter deck , 2 @,@ 085 @.@ 39 t ( 2 @,@ 052 @.@ 45 long tons ; 2 @,@ 298 @.@ 75 short tons ) on the barbettes , and 856 @.@ 11 t ( 842 @.@ 59 long tons ; 943 @.@ 70 short tons ) on the conning tower for a total protection of 8 @,@ 120 @.@ 62 t ( 7 @,@ 992 @.@ 37 long tons ; 8 @,@ 951 @.@ 45 short tons ) .

 The ships were powered by 14 Babcock & Wilcox coal @-@ fired boilers driving two dual @-@ acting triple expansion reciprocating steam engines , with 28 @,@ 100 shp ( 20 @,@ 954 kW ) producing a maximum speed of 21 kn ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) . They had a range of 7 @,@ 060 nmi ( 8 @,@ 120 mi ; 13 @,@ 080 km ) at 10 kn ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Initially , designs called for a 14 percent increase in power to 32 @,@ 000 shp ( 24 @,@ 000 kW ) over the 28 @,@ 000 shp ( 21 @,@ 000 kW ) of the preceding class . However , it was discovered that greater propulsive efficiency of the reciprocating engine allowed a reduction in installed power , needing only 28 @,@ 100 shp to make 21 knots . 
 The New York class was the final class of US battleship to be powered by coal . The class was designed to carry 2 @,@ 850 long tons ( 2 @,@ 900 t ) of coal , the most of any battleship class . In 1910 , the succeeding battleships of the Nevada class were designed with fuel oil in mind . Both ships were converted to carry fuel oil in 1926 , and had a capacity of 5 @,@ 200 long tons ( 5 @,@ 300 t ) of oil . Six new Bureau Express oil @-@ fired boilers replaced the 14 older design coal @-@ fired boilers at that time with no loss of power . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Funding for the battleships was authorized by a 24 June 1910 act , which called for the ships to cost no more than $ 6 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 . The act also specified new labor policies for their construction which put strict limits on labor hours and working conditions for shipyard employees . Bids were solicited only for Battleship No. 35 , Texas , on 27 September 1910 , while Battleship No. 34 , New York , was to be built by New York Navy Yard . Bids opened for No. 35 on 1 December . Ultimately Newport News Shipbuilding Company won the contract with a bid of $ 5 @,@ 830 @,@ 000 . Battleship No. 35 began construction first , on 17 April 1911 , launched 18 May 1912 , and completed on 12 March 1914 . Battleship No. 34 was laid down on 11 September 1911 , launched on 30 October 1912 , and completed on 15 April 1914 . 
 By 1926 , the New York class was considered obsolete compared with other battleships in service , so both ships received a complete refit . While several other battleships in service , including Utah and Florida were converted to training ships or scrapped , New York and Texas were chosen to be overhauled to increase their speed , armor , armament , and propulsion systems , in accordance with the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 . An additional 3 @,@ 000 long tons ( 3 @,@ 000 t ) were added for defense against aerial targets and submarines . Her 14 coal @-@ fired boilers were replaced by six Bureau Express oil @-@ fired boilers and the twin funnels were trunked into one , aft of the forward superstructure . Tripods were fitted in place of the lattice masts , and atop the forward tripod a control tower was installed . A tower was built amidships that contained additional fire control to backup the system on the foremast . A new aircraft catapult was installed atop turret Number 3 , and cranes were installed on either side of the funnel for boat and aircraft handling . Additional deck protection was added , and each ship 's beam was widened . The ships were fitted with anti @-@ torpedo bulges , though these made maneuvering harder at low speeds and both rolled badly , and gunfire accuracy was reduced in rough seas .

 Shortly after commissioning , New York became flagship for the United States occupation of Veracruz in 1914 . During World War I , she became flagship of Battleship Division 9 , commanded by Rear Admiral Hugh Rodman . Sent to reinforce the British Grand Fleet in the North Sea , she conducted blockade and escort duties . She twice came into contact with German U @-@ boats , and is believed to have accidentally sunk one . She returned to the United States at the end of the war , and began taking on patrol and training duties . New York was fitted with <unk> RADAR in February 1938 , including the first United States duplexer so a single antenna could both send and receive . 
 She was a part of the Neutrality Patrol following the outbreak of World War II , and In September 1939 , and spent the beginning of the war escorting convoys between New York and Iceland . She saw action supporting Operation Torch , the Allied invasion of North Africa , where she targeted shore batteries threatening the landings in November 1942 . She remained in convoy patrol and training for several years , until she was moved to the Pacific Fleet late in the war and supported landings on Iwo Jima in February 1945 , and later the invasion of Okinawa in April 1945 . She was lightly damaged by a kamikaze attack in this battle . Following the war , she was used as a target ship during Operation Crossroads and subsequently studied for its effects , before being sunk as a target in 1948 .

 Texas also participated in the occupation of Veracruz for several months in 1914 , before conducting training and upgrades to become the first ship of the US Navy to mount anti @-@ aircraft weapons . She conducted convoy patrols early in World War I and was the first US ship to fire on a German one during a convoy mission in 1917 . She joined other US battleships in reinforcing the British fleet near the end of the war and was present for the German surrender . In the inter @-@ war period she became one of the first battleships to launch and operate aircraft , and frequently alternated her time between the Atlantic and Pacific waters on training exercises . 
 She was part of the Neutrality Patrol at the beginning of World War II and supported Allied landings at North Africa , and then conducted convoy patrol duty to North African and European ports throughout 1943 . On 6 June 1944 , she supported Operation Overlord , covering Allied landings on the beaches of Normandy , France , in particular the battle at Pointe du Hoc . Later that month on 25 June , she supported the bombardment of Cherbourg and there was damaged when she was hit with a German artillery shell . In July she moved to support Operation Dragoon , the Allied invasion of southern France . Following extensive repairs and training , she moved to the Pacific and supported the invasion of Iwo Jima in February 1945 . She then moved to support landings on Okinawa in April . Following the end of the war , Texas was decommissioned and in 1948 she was moved to San Jacinto State Park and converted into a museum ship , where she remains today . 
 = J.D.B. v. North Carolina = 
 J.D.B. v. North Carolina , 564 U.S. 261 ( 2011 ) , was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that age is relevant when determining police custody for Miranda purposes . J.D.B. was a 13 @-@ year @-@ old student enrolled in special education classes whom police had suspected of committing two robberies . A police investigator visited J.D.B. at school , where he was interrogated by the investigator , a uniformed police officer , and school officials . J.D.B. subsequently confessed to his crimes and was convicted . J.D.B. was not given a Miranda warning during the interrogation , nor an opportunity to contact his legal guardian . During the trial , attempts to suppress the statements given by J.D.B. because he was not given a Miranda warning were denied on the grounds that J.D.B. was not in police custody . The case was appealed and the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case . " J.D.B. v. NORTH <unk> . " J.D.B. v. North Carolina . N.p. , n.d. Web . 23 Apr. 2015 . After examining the lower court 's reasoning , the Supreme Court found that J.D.B. ' s age should have been considered when determining whether he was in police custody . The Court remanded the case and instructed the lower court to make a new finding on custody while taking age into account .

 = = = Miranda warnings = = = 
 A Miranda warning is an explanation of a suspect 's rights that must be given by law enforcement before interrogation . It stems from the 1966 Miranda v. Arizona case , and is based primarily on the Fifth Amendment right against self @-@ incrimination . If a defendant in custody is not notified of their rights via a Miranda warning , any confession they give may not be admissible in court . If a defendant is not in police custody , however , police are free to question suspects without informing them of their rights , and their statements may still be admissible .

 J.D.B. was a 13 @-@ year @-@ old student attending Smith Middle School in Chapel Hill , North Carolina when he was taken out of class by a uniformed police officer and questioned . J.D.B. had been questioned previously by the police when they saw him in the neighborhood where two home break @-@ ins had occurred . After questioning J.D.B. the first time , police learned that a digital camera matching the description of a stolen item had been seen in the possession of J.D.B. This prompted the juvenile investigator assigned to the case to go to the school to question J.D.B. Upon arriving at the school , the investigator informed the uniformed police officer on detail to the school and members of the school 's administration . The uniformed officer interrupted the class J.D.B. was in and escorted him to a school conference room , where J.D.B. was subsequently questioned by the investigator , police officer , and members of the schools administration for 30 to 45 minutes . Prior to the questioning , J.D.B. was neither given Miranda warnings nor an opportunity to speak to his legal guardian , nor was he informed that he was free to leave the room . 
 Initially J.D.B. denied any wrongdoing . After being confronted with the stolen camera and after the urging of a school administrator , J.D.B. confessed to the break @-@ ins . It was at this point after the confession that the investigator informed J.D.B. that he could refuse to answer questions and that he was free to leave . J.D.B. indicated that he understood and then proceeded to provide further details about the crime , including the location of the stolen property . J.D.B. wrote a statement at the investigators request and then he was allowed to leave to catch the bus home . 
 = = = Trial and appeal = = = 
 Two juvenile petitions were filed against J.D.B. Each alleged one count of larceny and one count of breaking and entering . J.D.B. ' s public defender moved to suppress J.D.B. ' s statements and the evidenced derived therefrom , arguing that J.D.B. had been interrogated in police custody without the required Miranda warnings . The trial court decided that J.D.B. was not in custody , and the motion was denied . The North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed with a divided panel , " <unk> [ ing ] to extend the test for custody to include consideration of the age ... of an individual subjected to questioning by police " . 
 The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine whether the Miranda custody analysis includes consideration of a juvenile suspect ’ s age . The American Civil Liberties Union , American Bar Association , and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers were among the organizations that filed amicus briefs in support of J.D.B. The attorneys general of 30 states and 2 unincorporated territories filed an amicus brief in support of North Carolina .

 Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote the opinion for the Court , which commanded a majority only in part . The Court held that a child 's age properly informs the Miranda custody analysis . 
 = = = <unk> of age = = = 
 The Court underscored the dangers of not applying age to the custody analysis , writing : " to hold ... that a child 's age is never relevant to whether a suspect has been taken into custody — and thus to ignore the very real differences between children and adults — would be to deny children the full scope of the procedural safeguards that Miranda guarantees to adults " . The opinion cited Stansbury v. California where the Court held that a child 's age " would have affected how a reasonable person " in the suspect 's position " would perceive his or her freedom to leave " . Yarborough v. Alvarado was also cited , where the Court wrote that a child 's age " generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception " . Finally , the Court pointed out that the law reflects the idea that a child 's judgment is not the same as an adult 's , in the form of legal disqualifications on children as a class ( e.g. limitations on a child 's ability to marry without parental consent ) . 
 = = = Miranda as an objective test = = = 
 The Court placed emphasis on the fact that age is an objective circumstance and including it in a custody analysis does not place an undue burden on the police . The Court has repeatedly emphasized that the custody analysis is an objective test . In Thompson v. Keohane the Court wrote that : 
 Two discrete inquiries are essential to the determination : first , what were the circumstances surrounding the interrogation ; and second , given those circumstances , would a reasonable person have felt he or she was at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave . Once the scene is set and the players ’ lines and actions are reconstructed , the court must apply an objective test to resolve the ultimate inquiry : was there a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with formal arrest . 
 The Court wrote that consideration of age involved no consideration of the specific mindset of the individual . Rather , the Court held that age is an objective factor that affects how a reasonable person would perceive his or her freedom to leave .
