 Melbourne began 1974 by transporting 120 Australian soldiers to a temporary assignment with an American infantry battalion based in Hawaii . She then sailed to San Francisco to collect 12 new Chinook and five UH @-@ 1 Iroquois helicopters for the Royal Australian Air Force , arriving in Australia with her cargo in April . In June , the carrier took part in Exercise Kangaroo in the Coral Sea , before returning to Sydney in July . On 11 July , the passenger liner SS Australis hit and damaged Melbourne in Sydney Harbour . In November , the carrier took part in disaster relief exercises . These were prophetic , as on the night of 24 – 25 December 1974 , Cyclone Tracy destroyed the city of Darwin . Melbourne 's ship 's company was recalled immediately from leave , the ship was loaded with supplies , and the carrier departed Sydney on 26 December in the company of HMAS Brisbane . Melbourne , Brisbane , and eleven other ships were deployed as part of the largest peace @-@ time rescue effort ever organised by the RAN : Operation Navy Help Darwin . Melbourne remained off Darwin until 18 January 1975 , acting as operational headquarters and a helicopter base . During this operation , the seven Wessex helicopters embarked on Melbourne performed 2 @,@ 493 flights , carrying 7 @,@ 824 passengers and 107 tons of cargo . 
 Following Navy Help Darwin , Melbourne participated in RIMPAC 75 , then returned to Sydney for a fourteen @-@ month refit , which was delayed by industrial action at the dockyard . While moored in Sydney Harbour , on 24 July , Melbourne was struck by Japanese cargo ship Blue Andromeda . While working up following the refit , Melbourne and HMAS Torrens provided assistance to MV Miss Chief off the coast of Bundaberg , Queensland on 16 August 1976 . In October , Melbourne participated in Exercise Kangaroo II , before sailing to her namesake city for the carrier 's 21st birthday celebrations , then returning to Sydney on 5 November .

 On 5 December 1976 , a fire deliberately lit at HMAS Albatross by a member of the Fleet Air Arm damaged or destroyed all but one of Australia 's S @-@ 2 Trackers . Following participation in RIMPAC 77 , Melbourne was sent to San Diego to collect replacement aircraft . Arriving back in Sydney on 5 April , the carrier was sent on a five @-@ month deployment to the United Kingdom on 28 April , accompanied by HMAS Brisbane and HMNZS Canterbury . En route , Melbourne lost a Sea King in the Indian Ocean on 9 May , with the aircrew recovered by Brisbane . A Tracker from Melbourne located the disabled Dutch vessel Impala Princess in the Gulf of Aden on 25 May and directed a French destroyer to assist . Two Bofors naval guns were deposited by Melbourne at Souda Bay , Crete on 2 June , marking the first visit of an Australian warship to Crete since June 1941 . These weapons were donated to the Australian War Memorial at <unk> , in Crete 's Rethymno regional unit . The highlight of the deployment saw the three ships represent Australia and New Zealand at the Silver Jubilee Naval Review on 28 June 1977 . A two @-@ seat Harrier jump jet demonstrator undertook a series of trial takeoffs and landings aboard Melbourne on 30 June : a trial organised as part of the project overseeing the ship 's potential replacement . Following the Jubilee Review and participation in Exercise Highwood in July , Melbourne and her escorts returned to Australia , arriving in Fremantle on 19 September and Sydney on 4 October . Melbourne was docked in Garden Island 's drydock on arrival , where she remained until January 1978 . 
 At the end of March 1978 , Melbourne left Sydney for RIMPAC 78 . During this exercise , Melbourne acquired the nickname ' Little M ' after working with ' Big E ' USS Enterprise — the smallest and largest aircraft carriers ( respectively ) in operation at the time . On return in July , the carrier entered a major refit , which continued until 3 August 1979 . During this refit , on 3 March , a boiler explosion caused minor damage to the carrier . The remainder of the year involved participation in three exercises , <unk> off Wellington , New Zealand , Sea Eagle I in the Tasman Sea , and Kangaroo III in the Coral Sea . During <unk> , Melbourne lost her LW @-@ 02 radar aerial and a Skyhawk , both of which fell overboard during heavy seas . 
 During February and March 1980 , Melbourne participated in RIMPAC 80 , as the flagship of Battle Group Two . This was immediately followed by a visit to the Solomon Islands in early April . The carrier was in Sydney from mid @-@ April until mid @-@ August , during which the 25th anniversary of Melbourne 's service in the RAN was celebrated on 15 August with a cocktail party aboard the carrier , popularly referred to as ' The Night of the Admirals ' . On 18 August , Melbourne sailed for Fremantle to participate in Exercise <unk> 80 . On 8 September , Melbourne , accompanied by Perth , Derwent , Stalwart , Supply , and <unk> deployed to the Indian Ocean as the Australian Squadron for a flag @-@ showing cruise . During this cruise two Skyhawks were lost : on 2 and 21 October . On 24 October , a Tracker from Melbourne observed Soviet warships <unk> and Ivan <unk> shadowing the Squadron . The Squadron 's return in November 1980 concluded the largest and longest RAN deployment since World War II . 
 Following her return , the carrier spent six months in Australian waters , before a two @-@ month deployment to Southeast Asia . During this deployment , on 21 June 1981 , Melbourne rescued 99 Vietnamese refugees from a disabled fishing vessel in the South China Sea . The carrier 's deployments for the second half of the year consisted of two exercises , Sea Hawk and Kangaroo 81 . A major refit scheduled to begin in late 1981 was postponed pending the decision on a replacement carrier . After docking at Garden Island in December , the carrier was accidentally flooded by an officer who was impatient to commence leave . In his haste to shut down the carrier , he failed to deactivate the water pumps , and over 180 tons of fresh water were pumped in before a maintenance party discovered the flooding the next day . Melbourne remained in dock at the start of 1982 , and did not leave before the decision regarding her replacement was made . 
 = = Replacement = = 
 A replacement for Melbourne was under consideration as early as 1956 , and the question was revisited on several occasions until the 1980s . In every situation , a new aircraft carrier was turned down due to the increases in manpower and operating costs required to operate the ship when compared to Melbourne . 
 Between 1956 and 1959 , the RAN considered acquiring a larger carrier to replace Melbourne , as the Fleet Air Arm was becoming obsolete and the RAN did not believe the ship could be modified to operate newer , heavier aircraft . Under consideration were British carrier HMS Albion and a ship of the United States ' Essex class . Both options were turned down , and it was instead proposed to operate Melbourne as a helicopter carrier . 
 In 1960 , the United States Navy offered an Essex @-@ class carrier to the Australian government , in the interest of improving relations between the two nations and their navies . The only cost to the RAN would have been the modifications required to make the carrier operationally compatible with the RAN 's primarily British @-@ designed fleet . In the late 1960s , the British made a similar offer , following a 1966 review indicating that HMS Hermes was a superfluous naval unit . In 1968 , Hermes took part in a combined exercise with the RAN , during which the carrier was visited by RAN and Australian government officials , while RAN Skyhawks and Trackers practised landings on the larger carrier . Both offers were turned down due to operating and manpower costs . 
 The need to secure a replacement for Melbourne grew as the carrier 's age caused the operating costs to increase to over A $ 25 million per year . In June 1977 , the Defence Force Development Committee approved an investigation into acquiring a STOVL / helicopter carrier . By August 1979 , the decision was limited to three ships : a modified American Iwo Jima @-@ class amphibious assault ship , an Italian Giuseppe Garibaldi @-@ class carrier , and a Sea Control Ship design that later became the Spanish Navy 's Principe de Asturias . By February 1981 , the Iwo Jima class was the preferred option . 
 = = = HMS Invincible = = = 
 Plans to replace Melbourne changed in July 1981 ; the British 1981 Defence White Paper had marked the recently commissioned HMS Invincible as surplus to requirements , and she was offered to the RAN for the ' bargain ' price of GB £ 175 million ( A $ 285 million ) . The Invincible class had been considered and discarded during the investigation , but the decreased price and the fact the already @-@ constructed carrier would be ready for RAN service in 1983 prompted the Australian government to announce its intention to purchase Invincible on 25 February 1982 and close the carrier acquisition program . The government also announced that the ship would be renamed HMAS Australia and operated as a helicopter carrier , and that a decision on the purchase of fixed wing aircraft would be made after acquisition . 
 The deal was put on hold in April 1982 , following the outbreak of the Falklands War . The performance of Invincible and other Royal Navy aircraft carriers during the conflict showed that the report which suggested reductions in the size of Britain 's carrier fleet — with the follow @-@ on effect of making Invincible available for sale — was flawed , and both sides withdrew from the deal in July . The RAN was again offered HMS Hermes , and again declined due to the carrier 's age and manpower requirements . The Australian government began to reconsider the previous contenders for replacement , as well as considering requesting the United Kingdom or United States to build a simple carrier capable of operating F / A @-@ 18 Hornet strike fighters , but the issue was suspended at the commencement of the 1983 Australian Federal Election . On 14 March , following the election of Bob Hawke 's Labor Government , the announcement was made that Melbourne would not be replaced . 
 = = Decommissioning and fate = = 
 Following the decision to replace Melbourne with HMS Invincible , the postponed refit was cancelled outright . The Australian carrier was prepared for disposal , and was decommissioned and placed in reserve on 30 June 1982 . She was towed to the mooring dolphins near Bradley 's Head , where she remained until 1985 . Melbourne was capable of being reactivated as a helicopter @-@ equipped anti @-@ submarine warfare carrier within 26 weeks , but was never required to do so . A Sydney @-@ based group proposed in 1984 to purchase Melbourne and operate her as a floating casino moored in international waters off Eden , New South Wales , but nothing came of this . Melbourne 's air wing was disbanded at HMAS Albatross on 2 July 1982 , with the transfer of 805 Squadron 's Skyhawks to 724 Squadron and 816 Squadron being absorbed into 851 Squadron . The Skyhawks remained in service as fleet support aircraft until 30 June 1984 , while the Trackers were withdrawn from service on 31 August 1984 after being used as land @-@ based maritime patrol aircraft . 
 The carrier was initially sold for breaking up as scrap metal for A $ 1 @.@ 7 million , although the sale fell through in June 1984 . She was sold again in February 1985 to the China United Shipbuilding Company for A $ 1 @.@ 4 million , with the intention that she be towed to China and broken up for scrap . Prior to the ship 's departure for China , the RAN stripped Melbourne of all electronic equipment and weapons , and welded her rudders into a fixed position so that she could not be reactivated . However , her steam catapult , arresting equipment and mirror landing system were not removed . At this time , few western experts expected that the Chinese Government would attempt to develop aircraft carriers in the future . The carrier departed Sydney on 27 April 1985 , heading for Guangzhou , China , under the tow of tug De Ping . The journey was delayed when the towing line began to part , requiring the carrier and tug to shelter in Moreton Bay , Queensland , on 30 April . The towing gear broke a day later , requiring a second tug to secure the carrier while repairs were made to De Ping . Three days later , Melbourne ran aground while still in Moreton Bay . Melbourne finally arrived in China on 13 June . The Australian government received a Telex on this day , reading : 
 Please be advised that HMAS Melbourne arrived at Port Huangpu , intact and safely afloat , proud and majestic . She has been innocent , never once bowed to the natural or human force , in spite of the heavy storm and the talked about jinx . 
 The ship was not scrapped immediately ; instead she was studied by Chinese naval architects and engineers as part of the nation 's top @-@ secret carrier development program . However , it is unclear whether the People 's Liberation Army Navy ( PLAN ) orchestrated the acquisition of Melbourne or simply took advantage of the situation ; Rear Admiral Zhang Zhaozhong , who is both the son of PLAN founder Zhang <unk> and a staff member at the National Defence College , has stated that the Navy was unaware of the purchase until Melbourne first arrived at Guangzhou . Melbourne was the largest warship any of the Chinese experts had seen , and they were surprised by the amount of equipment which was still in place . The PLAN subsequently arranged for the ship 's flight deck and all the equipment associated with flying operations to be removed so that they could be studied in depth . Reports have circulated that either a replica of the flight deck , or the deck itself , was used for clandestine training of People 's Liberation Army Navy pilots in carrier flight operations . It has also been claimed that the Royal Australian Navy received and " politely rejected " a request from the PLAN for blueprints of the ship 's steam catapult . The carrier was not dismantled for many years ; according to some rumours she was not completely broken up until 2002 . A 2012 article in Jane 's Navy International stated that the large quantity of equipment recovered from Melbourne " undoubtedly helped " Admiral Liu Hua @-@ qing secure the Chinese Government 's support for his proposal to initiate a program to develop aircraft carriers for the Navy . 
 Melbourne 's service is commemorated with a stained @-@ glass window at the Garden Island Naval Chapel . One of the ship 's anchors is incorporated into a memorial to naval aviation at Nowra , New South Wales . Another anchor and the starboard side ship 's bell are on display at the RAN Heritage Centre at Garden Island . Memorabilia from Melbourne 's voyages with the Fleet Air Arm embarked , and examples of all the types of aircraft deployed on Melbourne , are on permanent static display in the Fleet Air Arm Museum at HMAS Albatross . 
 Following an overhaul of the RAN battle honours system completed in 2010 , Melbourne was retroactively awarded the honour " Malaysia 1965 – 66 " for her service during the Indonesia @-@ Malaysia Confrontation . 
 = Widerøe Flight 744 = 
 Widerøe Flight 744 , also known as the Namsos Accident ( Norwegian : Namsos @-@ ulykken ) , was a controlled flight into terrain of a de Havilland Canada DHC @-@ 6 @-@ 300 Twin Otter during approach to Namsos Airport , Høknesøra in Norway . The incident occurred on 27 October 1993 at 19 : 16 : 48 and killed six of the nineteen people on board , including the crew of two . The scheduled flight was on route between Trondheim Airport , Værnes via Namsos to Rørvik Airport , Ryum and the aircraft crashed at Berg in <unk> because it held too low an altitude . 
 Parallel investigations were carried out by Namdal Police District and the Accident Investigation Board for Civil Aviation ( HSL ) . A conflict arose between the two as the latter in cooperation with the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association did not want a police investigation until after their report was finished . This caused the police to use two years to gain court permission to access the evidence . The report found no technical problems with the aircraft . However , it found several pilot errors and laid a large responsibility on the airline for lack of proper organization and routines . No @-@ one was charged after the accident , but lead to a major restructure of operations and procedures in Widerøe . 
 = = Accident = = 
 Widerøe Flight 744 was a scheduled flight from Trondheim Airport , Værnes to Namsos Airport , Høknesøra operated with a de Havilland Canada DHC @-@ 6 @-@ 300 Twin Otter . The aircraft had registration LN @-@ <unk> and serial number 408 , and was delivered to Widerøe in 1974 . The aircraft had flown 40 @,@ 453 hours and had met all service requirements . The pilot in command , Jan <unk> , was 43 years old , had held a pilot 's license since 1974 and had been employed in Widerøe since 1985 . He had held a C certificate since 4 January 1993 , and had been a pilot in command since 20 January . He had flown 4 @,@ 835 hours in total and had landed 13 times at Namsos Airport in the 12 months prior to the accident . The first officer , Trond Hamre , was 34 years old , had training from the United States which had been converted to a C certificate in 1988 . He had 6 @,@ 354 hours of flight , of which 1 @,@ 356 was in a Twin Otter . He had been a pilot in command for 3 @,@ 441 hours prior to working for Widerøe , where he had been employed since 1990 . He had landed 27 times at Namsos Airport in the 12 months preceding the accident . 
 The first officer was using a medication against back pains which was not permitted while flying . However , these had been prescribed by a physician who had training in aviation medicine . No traces of the substance were found in the pilot 's body after the accident . The crew had started duty at Bodø Airport at 13 : 30 ( Central European Time , UTC + 1 ) and were to make a round trip to Trondheim Airport , with intermediate stops at Sandnessjøen Airport , Mosjøen Airport , Brønnøysund Airport and Rørvik Airport as Flight 711 . On the way down , the flight canceled its stop at Mosjøen because of bad weather . The aircraft landed at Trondheim Airport at 17 : 52 . The return flight was to operate as Flight 744 from Trondheim via Namsos to Rørvik , where the plane and crew were to overnight . 
 At Trondheim , 17 passengers boarded along with 136 kilograms ( 300 lb ) of cargo . Estimated flight time to Namsos was 35 minutes . The aircraft had a maximum take @-@ off weight of 5 @,@ 675 kilograms ( 12 @,@ 511 lb ) , while the aircraft took off with 5 @,@ 460 kilograms ( 12 @,@ 040 lb ) . Prior to departure , the ground handling agent SAS Ground Handling had calculated the passenger load and mean aerodynamic chord of the passengers . When correcting after observing the seating of the passengers , the pilot in command had made a calculation mistake in which he thought the passengers did not need to move around . In reality they would have to be rearranged to meet the limits of the distribution of weight . The aircraft left Trondheim Airport at 18 : 37 after which it ascended to cruising height at 1 @,@ 500 meters ( 5 @,@ 000 ft ) . At 18 : 53 , the QNH was confirmed by Namsos to be 1017 hPa . This gave a height reading of 1 @,@ 510 meters ( 4 @,@ 950 ft ) and 1 @,@ 500 meters ( 4 @,@ 900 ft ) , respectively , for the pilot in command and first officer . There was 25 knots ( 46 km / h ; 29 mph ) wind from 250 ° , with gusts up to 36 knots ( 67 km / h ; 41 mph ) . 
 The pilot in command then decided on the descent plan , involving an initial descent to 1 @,@ 200 meters ( 4 @,@ 000 ft ) , then down to 900 meters ( 3 @,@ 000 ft ) , before making a swing towards localizer 255 . Then the aircraft should descend to 640 meters ( 2 @,@ 100 ft ) and head towards Namsos Beacon inbound . After that , minimum height was set to 640 meters ( 2 @,@ 100 ft ) . At 19 : 01 , the aerodrome flight information service ( AFIS ) announced new weather data : the wind had changed to 260 ° at 25 knots ( 46 km / h ; 29 mph ) , with gusts up to 40 knots ( 74 km / h ; 46 mph ) . As the crew planned to use runway 26 , this would give wind directly against the craft , so the crew decided to add some height to the descent . At 19 : 05 , the first officer stated that the descent checklist was completed , and the pilot in command started the approach checklist . At this time , both height indicators showed 1 @,@ 500 metres ( 5 @,@ 000 ft ) . At 19 : 07 , the aircraft was turned to 050 ° . 
 At 19 : 10 , the aircraft reached the center line and the aircraft was confirmed by Namsos AFIS at 255 ° . By 19 : 14 , the aircraft had descended to 640 meters ( 2 @,@ 100 ft ) and at 19 : 15 : 13 , it passed Namsos Beacon . At 19 : 15 : 30 , the first officer confirmed visual contact with the field . At 19 : 16 : 35 , the pilot in command stated a height of 150 meters ( 500 ft ) , confirmed by the first officer . Four seconds later , the pilot in command stated : " we should not descend any further " . The aircraft first hit some trees , located 119 meters ( 390 ft ) above mean sea level . At 19 : 16 : 48 , the aircraft hit a hill 6 @.@ 15 kilometers ( 3 @.@ 82 mi ) from the airport , at Berg in <unk> . A distress <unk> signal was received by Namsos and a search and rescue operation was started immediately . Both pilots and four passengers were killed , while the remaining thirteen passengers were injured . 
 = = Cause = = 
 The weather in the area had wind up towards 30 knots ( 56 km / h ; 35 mph ) , with clouds and heavy rain , and some reports of turbulence . The aircraft was not equipped with ground proximity warning system , nor was this required . There was no requirement for the aircraft to have a flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder ( CVR ) , but the airline had chosen to install the latter . Interviews with the surviving passengers showed that none of them perceived that there was any problems with the flight until the sudden impact . One of the passengers was a navigation professional and could see parts of the cockpit from his seat ; he was thus able to confirm some of the navigational display readings . Interviews with locals indicated that the aircraft followed a normal path . 
 The report from the Accident Investigation Board for Civil Aviation characterized the accident as a controlled flight into terrain . The report pointed to several errors , both from the pilots , but also systematic failures from Widerøe and the Norwegian Aviation Authority . In particular , the report commented on the lack of callouts during descent . The base turn procedure was also criticized , because the crew failed to time it correctly , ending up 14 nautical miles ( 26 km ; 16 mi ) from the airport . When the flying pilot canceled the instrument landing and changed to visual landing during darkness , he did not have sufficient visual references to the terrain . During this part of the approach , the aircraft 's position was not controlled with any available navigational aids . This was in part due to both pilots focusing on extra @-@ cockpit activity after the non @-@ flying pilot had identified the necessary sight to the airport . The crew were not aware of their distance from the terrain ; the small margins from 150 meters ( 500 ft ) to 119 meters ( 392 ft ) were in part caused by pilots ' unawareness . The cooperation between the crew did not follow the regulations of crew resource management and seemed to have stopped after visual identification of the airfield . The airline was criticized for not having standardized an operative concept that the crew fully respected and followed . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 One man in his twenties was nearly unhurt in the accident and ran to the nearby farm of Berg . After saying " The aircraft has fallen down . You must call for help ! " , he ran back to the aircraft . The farm 's three residents were the first to arrive at the site of the crash . The site was subject to sleet , rain and a southwestern wind , causing the victims to quickly freeze . Several of the wounded could not move because of fractures . The farmhouse became the base of operations for the emergency crews . The wounded were carried to the farm , where they received initial treatment before being transported to Namsos Hospital — the last arriving at 22 : 30 . About seventy people participated in the emergency work . 
 The accident was the fifth fatal accident with a Twin Otter in Norway and the fourth fatal accident by Widerøe in eleven years . The company 's executive management met in Bodø the evening of the accident before chief executive officer Bård Mikkelsen and others traveled to Namsos to investigate the crash site of the third fatal accident since Mikkelsen started in his position in 1988 . Widerøe stopped all advertisements in the period after the accident . Widerøe announced in November that they would accelerate the replacement of their Twin Otter and de Havilland Canada Dash 7 aircraft with new de Havilland Canada Dash 8 aircraft , but denied that the accident influenced the decision and instead cited financial reasons . Widerøe 's chief operating officer , Per @-@ Helge <unk> , announced in July 1994 that he would step down because of the strain of the three accidents . 
 By 1996 Widerøe had undertaken a series of operational amendments after recommendation from the commission , including a reorganization of the aircraft operation division , the quality insurance division and the company 's reporting systems . Another concern was that pilots did not follow the company 's routines , resulting in the company grounding about ten pilots which did not follow policy or did too many errors during observations . Some would be receive additional training while others would be retired . The company would further invest 40 million Norwegian krone ( NOK ) to improve safety . 
 The aircraft was written off after the accident . Immediately after the accident , Widerøe paid a compensation of NOK 10 @,@ 000 to each of the survivors . The survivors and the deceased 's next @-@ of @-@ kin claimed damages for several million NOK , including three people who each demanded over one million after becoming disabled . The demands were raised against the insurance company Norsk <unk> . After mediation , the airline agreed to compensate the passengers with an additional NOK 15 @,@ 000 in cash and NOK 30 @,@ 000 worth of free travel with Widerøe . 
 = = Investigation = = 
 Four inspectors from the HSL , two police investigators from the National Criminal Investigation Service and a technician from Widerøe arrived at the site at 13 : 30 on 28 August . By then flights had resumed at Namsos Airport . They secured an area of 200 by 80 meters ( 660 by 260 ft ) for the investigation , in which all the debris of the aircraft had landed and trees had been felled by the crashing aircraft . The instrument landing system at Namsos Airport was tested by the Norwegian Aviation Authority on 28 October and 4 November , without any faults being found . 
 Two parallel investigations were undertaken , one by HSL and one by Namdal Police District . The latter criticized the former because there were not given access to the cockpit voice recorder ( CVR ) . Since 1989 both the police and the prosecuting authority had not been represented in the accident investigations . HSL emphasized that they had no legal obligation to submit the tapes to the police , that the police had not asked for the tapes after Widerøe Flight 839 in 1990 and that the Ministry of Transport and Communications supported this line . The reason for the rules was that the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association did not want the records from the CVR to be used in criminal cases against pilots . The investigation board stated that they would forward any information which supported criminal violations , while Namdal Police District stated that it was necessary for an independent police investigation to identify any criminal violations . The Norwegian Data Inspectorate 's director Georg <unk> supported the police in their request for the tapes . 
 The Norwegian Airline Pilots Association recommended that its members not cooperate with the police in any way , stating that " the police should sit passively and wait for the report from the commission " . On 17 November the issue was brought to Parliament by the Liberal Party 's Lars Sponheim , but Minister of Transport and Communications Kjell Opseth stated that he did not want to interfere . In January 1994 , the police announced that they would bring six Widerøe pilots to court to force them to undergo police questioning . The six pilots were the two that piloted the previous shift on the aircraft , two that landed at Namsos Airport half an hour before the accident , and the two that had test @-@ flown after the previous maintenance spell some days before the accident . In February , HSL started extensive investigations of the culture among pilots in Widerøe , and initiated interviews with dozens of pilots and managers in the company to investigate systematic failures in the company . Salten District Court ruled in April in favor of court questioning of the pilots . In May , the police brought the demands to receive the CVR in to Namdal District Court . A ruling was not made until December , which supported the police 's demands . However , the issue was appealed by the accident board and the ministry . The issue was not resolved until August 1995 , when <unk> Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and required the tape to be handed over to the police . After the tape was handed over , both the pilots in Widerøe and the accident board would not cooperate deciphering the contents , nor would they hand over transcripts or notes , and asked the police take the matter to the courts if they needed any further assistance . 
 In February 1995 , SINTEF handed over a report ordered by the commission which revealed several absent safety procedures in Widerøe . The report was based on a recommendation by the International Civil Aviation Organization to take into consideration the organizational structure the aircraft operate within when investigating aviation accidents . In June , parliamentarian Magnus <unk> criticized the commission for working too slow , stating that the victims and next of kin needed answers to why the accident happened . The lack of cooperation between the police and the commission was the main source of the delays . Similar delays had occurred after Partnair Flight 394 in 1989 , which had resulted in the statute of limitations having come into effect by the time the report was published . A temporary report was presented to the survivors and next of kin on 20 March 1996 ; the report laid the responsibility for the accident on the airline . The final report was published on 10 July 1996 and laid the responsibility for the accident on the company and its operating routines . The report contained 26 recommendations for improvements for the company . The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority decided in September 1997 not to charge Widerøe for the accident . 
 = Jaffna kingdom = 
 The Jaffna kingdom ( Tamil : <unk> ் <unk> ் <unk> <unk> ) ( 1215 @-@ 1624 CE ) , also known as Kingdom of Aryacakravarti , of modern northern Sri Lanka was a historic monarchy that came into existence around the town of Jaffna on the Jaffna peninsula after the invasion of Magha , who is identified as the founder of the Jaffna kingdom and is said to have been from Kalinga , in India . Established as a powerful force in the north , north east and west of the island , it eventually became a tribute paying feudatory of the Pandyan Empire in modern South India in 1258 , gaining independence in 1323 with the fragmentation of the Pandyan control when the last Pandyan ruler of Madurai was defeated and expelled in 1323 by Malik Kafur , the army general of the Muslim empire Delhi Sultanate . For a brief period , in the early to mid @-@ 14th century , it was an ascendant power in the island of Sri Lanka when all regional kingdoms accepted subordination . However , the kingdom was eventually overpowered by the rival Kotte Kingdom , around 1450 when it was invaded by Prince Sapumal under the Kotte Kingdoms directive . 
 It was freed of Kotte control in 1467 ; its subsequent rulers directed their energies towards consolidating its economic potential by maximising revenue from pearls and elephant exports and land revenue . It was less feudal than most of the other regional kingdoms on the island of Sri Lanka of the same period . During this period , important local Tamil literature was produced and Hindu temples were built including an academy for language advancement . 
 The arrival of the Portuguese colonial power to the island of Sri Lanka in 1505 , and its strategic location in the Palk Strait connecting all interior Sinhalese kingdoms to South India , created political problems . Many of its kings confronted and ultimately made peace with the Portuguese colonials . In 1617 , Cankili II , an usurper to the throne , confronted the Portuguese but was defeated , thus bringing the kingdom ’ s independent existence to an end in 1619 . Although rebels like <unk> <unk> with help of Thanjavur Nayak kingdom tried to recover the kingdom , they were eventually defeated . Nallur , a suburb of Jaffna town , served as its capital . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Founding = = = 
 The origin of the Jaffna kingdom is obscure and still the subject of controversy among historians . Among mainstream historians , such as K. M. de Silva , S. Pathmanathan and Karthigesu <unk> , the widely accepted view is that the Kingdom of the Aryacakravarti dynasty in Jaffna began in 1215 with the invasion of a previously unknown chieftain called Magha , who claimed to be from Kalinga in modern India . He deposed the ruling Parakrama Pandyan II , a foreigner from the Pandyan Dynasty who was ruling the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa at the time with the help of his soldiers and mercenaries from the Kalinga , modern Kerala and Damila ( Tamil Nadu ) regions in India . 
 After the conquest of Rajarata , he moved the capital to the Jaffna peninsula which was more secured by heavy Vanni forest and ruled as a tribute @-@ paying subordinate of the Chola empire of Tanjavur , in modern Tamil Nadu , India . During this period ( 1247 ) , a Malay chieftain from <unk> in modern Thailand named Chandrabhanu invaded the politically fragmented island . Although King Parakramabahu II ( 1236 – 70 ) from <unk> was able to repulse the attack , Chandrabhanu moved north and secured the throne for himself around 1255 from Magha . Sadayavarman Sundara Pandyan I invaded Sri Lanka in the 13th century and defeated Chandrabhanu the usurper of the Jaffna Kingdom in northern Sri Lanka . Sadayavarman Sundara Pandyan I forced Chandrabhanu to submit to the Pandyan rule and to pay tributes to the Pandyan Dynasty . But later on when <unk> became powerful enough he again invaded the <unk> kingdom but he was defeated by the brother of Sadayavarman Sundara Pandyan I called Veera Pandyan I and Chandrabhanu lost his life . Sri Lanka was invaded for the 3rd time by the Pandyan Dynasty under the leadership of Arya Cakravarti who established the Jaffna kingdom . 
 = = = Aryacakravarti dynasty = = = 
 When Chandrabhanu embarked on a second invasion of the south , the Pandyas came to the support of the Sinhalese king and killed Chandrabhanu in 1262 and installed Aryacakravarti , a minister in charge of the invasion , as the king . When the Pandyan Empire became weak due to Muslim invasions , successive Aryacakravarti rulers made the Jaffna kingdom independent and a regional power to reckon with in Sri Lanka . All subsequent kings of the Jaffna Kingdom claimed descent from one <unk> Cakravarti who is identified with Kalinga Magha by Swami <unk> and Mudaliar Rasanayagam while maintaining their Pandyan progenitor ’ s family name . 
 Politically , the dynasty was an expanding power in the 13th and 14th century with all regional kingdoms paying tribute to it . However , it met with simultaneous confrontations with the Vijayanagar empire that ruled from Vijayanagara , southern India , and a rebounding Kingdom of Kotte from the south of Sri Lanka . This led to the kingdom becoming a vassal of the <unk> Empire as well as briefly losing its independence under the Kotte kingdom from 1450 to 1467 . The kingdom was re @-@ established with the disintegration of Kotte kingdom and the fragmentation of <unk> Empire . It maintained very close commercial and political relationships with the Thanjavur Nayakar kingdom in southern India as well as the Kandyan and segments of the Kotte kingdom . This period saw the building of Hindu temples and a flourishing of literature , both in Tamil and Sanskrit . 
 = = = Kotte conquest and restoration = = = 
 The Kotte conquest of the Jaffna Kingdom was led by king Parakramabahu VI 's adopted son , Prince Sapumal . This battle took place in many stages . Firstly , the tributaries to the Jaffna Kingdom in the Vanni area , namely the <unk> chieftains of the Vannimai were neutralised . This was followed by two successive conquests . The first war of conquest did not succeed in capturing the kingdom . It was the second conquest dated to 1450 that eventually was successful . Apparently connected with this war of conquest was an expedition to <unk> in modern South India , occasioned according to <unk> by the seizure of a Lankan ship laden with cinnamon . The Tenkasi inscription of Arikesari Parakrama Pandya of Tinnevelly ' who saw the backs of kings at Singai , Anurai , ' and else where , may refer to these wars ; it is dated between A.D. 1449 @-@ 50 and 1453 @-@ 4 . <unk> Cinkaiariyan the Aryacakravarti king fled to South India with his family . After the departure of Sapumal Kumara to Kotte , <unk> <unk> re @-@ took the kingdom in 1467 . 
 = = = Decline & dissolution = = = 
 Portuguese traders reached Sri Lanka by 1505 where their initial forays were against the south @-@ western coastal Kotte kingdom due to the lucrative monopoly on trade in spices that the Kotte kingdom enjoyed that was also of interest to the Portuguese . The Jaffna kingdom came to the attention of Portuguese officials in Colombo for multiple reasons which included their interference in Roman Catholic missionary activities , ( which was assumed to be patronizing Portuguese interests ) and their support to anti @-@ Portuguese factions of the Kotte kingdom , such as the chieftains from <unk> . The Jaffna Kingdom also functioned as a logistical base for the Kandyan kingdom , located in the central highlands without access to any seaports , as an <unk> for military aid arriving from South India . Further , due to its strategic location , it was feared that the Jaffna kingdom may become a beachhead for the Dutch landings . It was king Cankili I who resisted contacts with the Portuguese and even massacred 600 @-@ 700 <unk> Catholics in the island of Mannar . These Catholics were brought from India to Mannar to take over the lucrative pearl fisheries from the Jaffna kings . 
 Client state 
 The first expedition led by Viceroy Dom Constantino de Bragança in 1560 failed to subdue the kingdom but wrested the Mannar Island from it . Although the circumstances are unclear , by 1582 The Jaffna king was paying a tribute of ten ( 10 ) elephants or an equivalent in cash . In 1591 , during the second expedition led by André Furtado de Mendonça , king <unk> <unk> was killed and his son Ethirimanna Cinkam was installed as the monarch . This arrangement gave the Catholic missionaries freedom and monopoly in elephant export to the Portuguese , which the incumbent king however resisted . He helped the Kandyan kingdom under kings <unk> I and Senarat during the period 1593 @-@ 1635 with the intent of securing help from South India to resist the Portuguese . He however maintained autonomy of the kingdom without overly provoking the Portuguese . 
 Cankili II the <unk> 
 With the death of <unk> Cinkam in 1617 , Cankili II , a usurper , took control of the throne after killing the regent nominated by the late king . Unable to secure Portuguese acceptance of his kingship , Cankili II invited military aid from the Thanjavur Nayaks and allowed corsairs from Malabar to use a base in <unk> , hence posting a threat to Portuguese shipping routes through Palk Straight . Cankili II was supported by the Kandy rulers . After the fall of the Jaffna kingdom , the two unnamed princesses of Jaffna had been married to Senarat 's stepsons , <unk> and <unk> . Cankili II <unk> received military aid from the Thanjavur Nayak Kingdom . On his part , Raghunatha Nayak of Thanjavur made attempts to recover the Jaffna Kingdom for his <unk> , the Prince of Rameshwaram . However , all attempts to recover the Jaffna Kingdom from the Portuguese met with failure . 
 By June 1619 , there were two Portuguese expeditions : a naval expedition that was repulsed by the <unk> corsairs and another expedition by Phillippe de Oliveira and his 5 @,@ 000 strong land army which was able to inflict defeat on Cankili II . Cankili , along with every surviving member of the royal family were captured and taken to Goa , where he was hanged to death . The remaining captives were encouraged to become monks or nuns in the holy orders , and as most obliged , it avoided further claimants to the Jaffna throne . 
 = = Administration = = 
 According to Ibn Batuta , a traveling Moroccan historian of note , by 1344 , the kingdom had two capitals : one in Nallur in the north and the other in Puttalam in the west during the pearling season . The kingdom proper , that is the Jaffna peninsula , was divided into various provinces with subdivisions of <unk> meaning property or larger territorial units and ur or villages , the smallest unit , was administered on a hierarchical and regional basis . At the summit was the king whose kingship was hereditary ; he was usually succeeded by his eldest son . Next in the hierarchy stood the <unk> who were the provincial administrators . Then came the <unk> who functioned as judges and interpreters of the laws and customs of the land . It was also their duty to gather information of whatever was happening in the provinces and report to higher authorities . Administrators of revenues called <unk> or superintendents and <unk> or accountants came next in line . These were also known as <unk> . They had to keep records and maintain accounts . 
 <unk> was the chief of the <unk> . He was assisted by <unk> who were in turn assisted by <unk> , persons of authority over a village or a group of villages . They were the custodians of law and order and gave assistance to survey land and collect revenues in the area under their control . The village headman was called <unk> , <unk> or <unk> and he assisted in the collection of taxes and was responsible for the maintenance of order in his territorial unit . In addition , each caste had a chief who supervised the performance of caste obligations and duties . 
 Relationship with feudatories 
 <unk> were regions south of the Jaffna peninsula in the present @-@ day North Central and Eastern provinces and were sparsely settled by people . They were ruled by petty chiefs calling themselves <unk> . <unk> just south of the Jaffna peninsula and in the eastern Trincomalee district usually paid an annual tribute to the Jaffna kingdom instead of taxes . The tribute was in cash , grains , honey , elephants , and ivory . The annual tribute system was enforced due to the greater distance from Jaffna . During the early and middle part of the 14th century , the Sinhalese kingdoms in western , southern and central part of the island also became feudatories until the kingdom itself was briefly occupied by the forces of Parakramabahu VI around 1450 for about 17 years . Around the early 17th century , the kingdom also administered an exclave in Southern India called <unk> . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The economy of the Kingdom was almost exclusively based on subsistence agriculture until the 15th century . After the 15th century , however , the economy became diversified and commercialized as it became incorporated into the expanding Indian ocean . Ibn Batuta , during his visit in 1344 , observed that the kingdom of Jaffna was a major trading kingdom with extensive overseas contacts . The Kingdom 's trades were oriented towards maritime South India , with which it developed a commercial interdependence . The non @-@ agriculture tradition of the kingdom became strong as a result of large coastal fishing and boating population and growing opportunities for seaborne commerce . Influential commercial groups , drawn mainly from south Indian mercantile groups as well as other , resided in the royal capital , port , and market centers . Artisan settlements were also established and groups of skilled tradesmen — carpenters , stonemasons , wavers , dryers , gold and silver smiths — resided in urban centers . Thus , a pluralistic socio @-@ economic tradition of agriculture marine activities , commerce and handicraft production was well established . 
 Jaffna kingdom was less <unk> than other kingdoms in Sri Lanka , such as Kotte and Kandy . Its economy was based on more money transactions than transactions on land or its produce . The Jaffna defense forces were not feudal levies ; soldiers in the kings service were paid in cash . The king ’ s officials , namely <unk> , were also paid in cash and the numerous Hindu temples seem not to have owned extensive properties , unlike the Buddhist establishments in the South . Temples and the administrators depended on the king and the worshippers for their upkeep . Royal and Army officials were thus a salaried class and these three institutions consumed over 60 % of the revenues of the kingdom and 85 % of the government expenditures . Much of the kingdom 's revenues also came from cash except the Elephants from the Vanni feudatories . At the time of the conquest by the Portuguese in 1620 , the kingdom which was truncated in size and restricted to the Jaffna peninsula had revenues of 11 @,@ 700 pardaos of which 97 % came from land or sources connected to the land . One was called land rent and another called paddy tax called <unk> . 
 Apart from the land related taxes , there were other taxes , such as Garden tax from compounds where , among others , plantain , coconut and <unk> palms were grown and irrigated by water from the well . Tree tax on trees such as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and Poll tax equivalent to a personal tax from each . Professional tax was collected from members of each caste or guild and commercial taxes consisting of , among others , stamp duty on clothes ( clothes could not be sold privately and had to have official stamp ) , <unk> or levy on items of food , and Port and customs duties . <unk> , which connected the Peninsula with the mainland at <unk> with its boat services , was one of the chief port , and there were customs check posts at the sand passes of <unk> . Elephants from the southern Sinhalese kingdoms and the Vanni region were brought to Jaffna to be sold to foreign buyers . They were shipped abroad from a bay called <unk> , which is now called <unk> — a shortened form of Portuguese <unk> dos <unk> ( Bay of Elephants ) . Perhaps a peculiarity of Jaffna was the levy of license fee for the cremation of the dead . 
 Not all payments in kind were converted to cash , offerings of rice , bananas , milk , dried fish , game meat and curd persisted . Some inhabitants also had to render unpaid personal services called <unk> . 
 The kings also issued many types of coins for circulation . Several types of coins categorized as Sethu Bull coins issued from 1284 to 1410 are found in large quantities in the northern part of Sri Lanka . The obverse of these coins have a human figure flanked by lamps and the reverse has the Nandi ( bull ) symbol , the legend Setu in Tamil with a crescent moon above . 
 = = Culture = = 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 Saivism ( a sect of Hinduism ) in Sri Lanka has had continuous history from the early period of settlers from India . Hindu worship was widely accepted even as part of the Buddhist religious practices . During the Chola period in Sri Lanka , around the 9th and 10th century , Hinduism gained status as an official religion in the island kingdom . Kalinga Magha , whose rule followed that of the Cholas is remembered as a Hindu revivalist by the native literature of that period . 
 As the state religion , Saivism enjoyed all the prerogatives of the establishment during the period of the Jaffna kingdom . The Aryacakravarti dynasty was very conscious of its duties as a patron towards Saivism because of the patronage given by its ancestors to the Rameswaram temple , a well @-@ known pilgrimage center of Indian Hinduism . As noted , one of the titles assumed by the kings was <unk> or protector of Setu another name for Rameswaram . Setu was used in their coins as well as in inscriptions as marker of the dynasty . 
 Sapumal Kumaraya ( also known as <unk> Perumal in Tamil ) , who ruled the Jaffna kingdom on behalf of the Kotte kingdom is credited with either building or renovating the Nallur Kandaswamy temple . Singai <unk> is credited with building the <unk> temple , the Vaikuntha Pillaiyar temple and the <unk> temple . He built a pond called <unk> and filled it with water from the Yamuna river of North India , which is considered holy by Hindus . He was a frequent the visitor of the Koneswaram temple , as was his son and successor King Cankili I. King <unk> Cinkaiariyan had the traditional history of the temple compiled as a chronicle in verse , entitled Dakshina Kailasa Puranam , known today as the Sthala Puranam of <unk> Temple . Major temples were normally maintained by the kings and a salary was paid from the royal treasury to those who worked in the temple , unlike in India and rest of Sri Lanka , where religious establishments were autonomous entities with large endowments of land and related revenue . 
 Most accepted Lord Shiva as the primary deity and the lingam , the universal symbol of Shiva , was consecrated in shrines dedicated to him . The other Hindu gods of the pantheon such as Murugan , Pillaiyar , Kali were also worshipped . At the village level , village deities were popular along with the worship of <unk> whose veneration was common amongst the Sinhalese in the south as well . Belief in charm and evil spirits existed , just as in the rest of South Asia . 
 There were many Hindu temples within the Kingdom . Some were of great historic importance , such as the Koneswaram temple in Trincomalee , <unk> temple in Mannar , <unk> temple in <unk> along with hundreds of other temples that were scattered over the region . The ceremonies and festivals were similar to those in modern South India , with some slight changes in emphasis . The Tamil devotional literature of Saiva saints was used in worship . The Hindu New Year falling on the middle of April was more <unk> celebrated and festivals , such as <unk> , Deepavali , <unk> , and <unk> , along with marriages , deaths and coming of age ceremonies were part of the daily life . 
 Until ca . 1550 A.D. , when Cankili I expelled the Buddhists of Jaffna , who were all Sinhalese , and destroyed their many places of worship , Buddhism prevailed in the Jaffna kingdom , among the Sinhalese who had remained in the territory . Some important places of Buddhist worship in the Jaffna kingdom , which are mentioned in the <unk> are : Naga @-@ <unk> ( <unk> , modern <unk> ) , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> @-@ <unk> and <unk> ( modern <unk> ) , of these only the Buddhist temple at <unk> survive today . 
 = = = Society = = = 
 Caste structure 
 The social organization of the people of the Jaffna kingdom was based on a caste system dominated by the agricultural and landed elite , similar to the caste structure of South India . In this way , it resembled the social organization of the Sinhalese kingdoms to the south as well , where the <unk> caste was dominant and considered lower in status only to the ruling family . The Aryacakravarti kings and their immediate family claimed Brahma @-@ Kshatriya status , meaning Brahmins who took to martial life . Below them were the agriculturists ; the Vellalar and the <unk> castes who provided most of the <unk> to village headman who owned most of the arable land . Below the Vellalar were the <unk> who were also involved in agriculture . The people of the fishing castes , collectively known as the Karaiyar , were independent of this social structure to which the landed communities were bound . The <unk> were well known as traders and owners of Hindu temples and the Pallar and the <unk> castes composed of the landless labourers who tilled the land . Other castes composed of traditional barbers , washers , potters and general service providers . People of the <unk> caste lived in segregated settlements and were the untouchables , just as in the modern Tamil Nadu and Kerala regions of south India . 
 Mercenaries & traders 
 Mercenaries of various ethnic and caste backgrounds from India , such as the Telugus ( known locally as <unk> ) and Malayalees from the Kerala region were employed by the king as soldiers . Muslim traders and sea pirates of <unk> and Moor ethnicities as well as Sinhalese were in the Kingdom . The kingdom also functioned as a refuge for rebels from the south seeking shelter after failed political coups . According to the earliest historiographical literature of the Kingdom of Jaffna , <unk> , datable to 14th @-@ 15th century CE . , in verse 77 lists the community of <unk> ( Berbers specifically and Africans in general ) along with <unk> ( Gujaratis ) and <unk> ( Arabs ) and places them under the caste category of Pa ’ l ’ <unk> who are believed to be cavalrymen of Muslim faith . The caste of Pa ’ l ’ <unk> or Pa ’ l ’ <unk> is peculiar to Jaffna . A Dutch census taken in 1790 CE in Jaffna records 196 male adults belonging to Pa ’ l ’ <unk> caste as taxpayers . That means the identity and profession existed until Dutch times . But , <unk> , with 492 male adults and probably by this time generally meaning the Muslims , is found mentioned as a separate community in this census . 
 Laws 
 During the rule of the Aryacakravarti rulers , the laws governing the society was based on a compromise between a matriarchal system of society that seemed to have had deeper roots overlaid with a patriarchal system of governance . These laws seemed to have existed side by side as customary laws to be interpreted by the local <unk> . In some aspects such as in inheritance the similarity to <unk> law of present @-@ day Kerala and <unk> of modern <unk> was noted by later scholars . Further Islamic jurisprudence and Hindu laws of neighboring India also seemed to have had an impact on the customary laws . These customary laws were later codified and put to print during the Dutch colonial rule as <unk> in 1707 . The rule under earlier customs seemed to have been females succeeded females . But when the structure of the society came to be based on patriarchal system , a corresponding rule was recognized , that males succeeded males . Thus , we see the devolution of <unk> ( paternal inheritance ) was on the sons , and the devolution of the <unk> ( dowry or maternal inheritance ) was on the females . Just as one <unk> sister succeeded another , we had the corresponding rule that if one ’ s brother died instate , his properties devolved upon his brothers to the exclusion of his sisters . The reason being that in a patriarchal family each brother formed a family unit , but all the brothers being <unk> , when one of them died his property devolved upon his <unk> . 
 = = = Literature = = = 
 The kings of the dynasty provided patronage to literature and education . Temple schools and traditional <unk> classes in verandahs ( known as <unk> <unk> in Tamil language ) spread basic education in languages such as Tamil language and Sanskrit and religion to the upper classes . During the reign of <unk> <unk> rule , a work on medical science ( <unk> ) , on astrology ( <unk> ) and on mathematics ( <unk> ) were authored by <unk> . During the rule of <unk> <unk> , a work on medical sciences , known as <unk> , was completed . During Singai Pararasasekaran 's rule , an academy for Tamil language propagation on the model of ancient Tamil Sangam 's was established in Nallur . This academy performed a useful service in collecting and preserving ancient Tamil works in manuscripts form in a library called Saraswathy Mahal . Singai Pararasasekaran 's cousin <unk> was credited with translating the Sanskrit classic Raghuvamsa into Tamil . Among other literary works of historic importance compiled before the arrival of European colonizers , <unk> , written by Vaiyapuri Aiyar , is well known . 
 = = = Architecture = = = 
 There were periodic waves of South Indian influence over Sri Lankan art and architecture , though the prolific age of monumental art and architecture seemed to have declined by the 13th century . Temples built by the Tamils of Indian origin from the 10th century belonged to the Madurai variant of Vijayanagar period . A prominent feature of the Madurai style was the ornate and heavily sculptured tower or gopuram over the entrance of temple . None of the important religious constructions of this style within the territory that formed the Jaffna kingdom survived the destructive hostility of the Portuguese . 
 Nallur , the capital was built with four entrances with gates . There were two main roadways and four temples at the four gateways . The rebuilt temples that exist now do not match their original locations which instead are occupied by churches erected by the Portuguese . The center of the city was <unk> <unk> ( market place ) and was surrounded by a square fortification around it . There were courtly buildings for the Kings , Brahmin priests , soldiers and other service providers . The old Nallur Kandaswamy temple functioned as a defensive fort with high walls . In general , the city was laid out like the traditional temple town according to Hindu traditions .

 In 1927 , Reynolds and Reynolds won a contract to provide all of the business forms for Chevrolet dealerships . The company opened new offices throughout the U.S. in the 1930s , and had 19 sales offices by the end of the decade . A controlling interest in the company was acquired in 1939 by Senior Richard Hallam Grant , ending the Reynolds family ownership . He became the company 's president in 1941 . A new printing facility was built in 1948 in Celina , Ohio , and another in 1953 in Dallas , Texas , in addition to the one built in Los Angeles in 1928 . Reynolds became a public company in 1961 . In the 1960s , Reynolds opened new printing facilities in North Hollywood , Los Angeles , New Jersey and Canada .

At the time , data could not be shared between departments and only one user was allowed on the system at a time . Each computer came at a cost of more than $ 100 @,@ 000 . Even as the computer division grew , the company 's overall business revenue declined due to paper business forms becoming obsolete . In 1986 , the company acquired Arnold Corporation , which increased Reynolds ' revenues 50 percent and expanded its market presence to other industries besides car dealerships . The head of the computers division , David Holmes , was appointed CEO in 1989 . He led the company 's first large @-@ scale lay @-@ off in the printing division , cutting headcount and manufacturing space in half . The employees resisted the changes he incorporated .

 Reynolds and Reynolds started as a printer of standardized business forms on carbon paper . By the 1940s , Reynolds ' business was divided into four main areas : automotive , medical , custom forms and Post @-@ Rite Peg Boards . Reynolds ' first electronic accounting service was introduced in 1963 . Its parts inventory software product , called Electronic Parts Inventory Control ( EPIC ) , was released in beta in 1966 . It was renamed upon full release the following year as <unk> . This was followed by the accounting and management software called <unk> and an accounts receivable product . 
 At first clients sent hole @-@ punched accounting records to a Reynolds processing center , which would print a complete accounting that is sent back to the client by mail . The development of modems and internet technology in the 1970s led to several advancements . Reynolds provided 3 @,@ 600 specialized modems to dealerships between 1974 and 1978 . The modems communicated with Reynolds ' VIM @-@ brand minicomputers at 80 Reynolds locations , which provided computing power and printed forms . This eliminated the need for clients to ship data to Reynolds in tapes and allowed daily access to online services . By the end of the 1970s , batch processing and computer processing centers were being phased out in response to personal computers kept at the dealership . In the years 1978 and 1982 , Reynolds introduced VIM @-@ brand computer systems that were kept at dealerships . 
 By 1986 , the VIM @-@ based dealer management computer systems had helped Reynolds acquire a 45 percent market @-@ share and was on its fifth generation with 9 @,@ 000 installations . In 1987 Reynolds moved to a software model with its first release of the ERA dealer management software , which was a complete rewrite of its prior programming . ERA allows users to manage logistics for sales , finance , service and parts across departments . That same year Reynolds developed a digital , graphical parts catalog program for selecting and ordering automotive parts . This was followed by the Vehicle <unk> and Marketing Network sales <unk> . 
 By 1997 , Reynolds and Reynolds had more than 30 applications for various functions of a car dealership .

" According to Automotive News , the Unix @-@ based system could support more users , but the Microsoft software was compatible with more of the newer applications being used by dealerships . Reynolds also developed the Reynolds Generations Series Suite in collaboration with Microsoft , but the product was not successful in the marketplace . It was discontinued in 2005 . 
 In 2011 Reynolds and Reynolds introduced the current version of its dealer management software , called ERA @-@ <unk> , which reduced the number of screens needed to perform tasks by two @-@ thirds . 
 = Vijayanagara Empire = 
 The Vijayanagara Empire ( also called Karnata Empire , and the Kingdom of <unk> by the Portuguese ) was based in the Deccan Plateau region in South India . It was established in 1336 by Harihara I and his brother Bukka Raya I of Sangama Dynasty . The empire rose to prominence as a culmination of attempts by the southern powers to ward off Islamic invasions by the end of the 13th century . It lasted until 1646 , although its power declined after a major military defeat in 1565 by the Deccan sultanates . The empire is named after its capital city of Vijayanagara , whose ruins surround present day Hampi , now a World Heritage Site in Karnataka , India . The writings of medieval European travelers such as Domingo Paes , Fernão Nunes , and Niccolò Da Conti , and the literature in local languages provide crucial information about its history . Archaeological excavations at Vijayanagara have revealed the empire 's power and wealth . 
 The empire 's legacy includes many monuments spread over South India , the best known of which is the group at Hampi . The previous temple building traditions in South India came together in the Vijayanagara Architecture style . The mingling of all faiths and vernaculars inspired architectural innovation of Hindu temple construction , first in the Deccan and later in the Dravidian idioms using the local granite . Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation . The empire 's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in Kannada , Telugu , Tamil , and Sanskrit , while Carnatic music evolved into its current form . The Vijayanagara Empire created an epoch in South Indian history that transcended regionalism by promoting Hinduism as a unifying factor . 
 = = Alternative name = = 
 Karnata Empire ( Karnata Rajya ) was another name for the Vijayanagara Empire , used in some inscriptions and literary works of the Vijayanagara times including the Sanskrit work Jambavati Kalyanam by King Krishnadevaraya and Telugu work Vasu <unk> . 
 = = History = = 
 Differing theories have been proposed regarding the origins of the Vijayanagara empire . Many historians propose that Harihara I and Bukka , the founders of the empire , were Kannadigas and commanders in the army of the Hoysala Empire stationed in the Tungabhadra region to ward off Muslim invasions from the Northern India . Others claim that they were Telugu people , first associated with the Kakatiya Kingdom , who took control of the northern parts of the Hoysala Empire during its decline . Irrespective of their origin , historians agree the founders were supported and inspired by Vidyaranya , a saint at the Sringeri monastery to fight the Muslim invasion of South India . Writings by foreign travelers during the late medieval era combined with recent excavations in the Vijayanagara principality have uncovered much @-@ needed information about the empire 's history , fortifications , scientific developments and architectural innovations . 
 Before the early 14th @-@ century rise of the Vijayanagara Empire , the Hindu states of the Deccan — the Yadava Empire of Devagiri , the Kakatiya dynasty of Warangal , the Pandyan Empire of Madurai , and the tiny kingdom of Kampili — had been repeatedly invaded by Muslims from the north , and by 1336 they had all been defeated by Alla @-@ ud @-@ din Khilji and Muhammad bin Tughluq , the Sultans of Delhi . The Hoysala Empire was the sole remaining Hindu state in the path of the Muslim invasion . After the death of Hoysala king Veera Ballala III during a battle against the Sultan of Madurai in 1343 , the Hoysala Empire merged with the growing Vijayanagara empire . 
 In the first two decades after the founding of the empire , Harihara I gained control over most of the area south of the Tungabhadra river and earned the title of <unk> <unk> ( " master of the eastern and western seas " ) . By 1374 Bukka Raya I , successor to Harihara I , had defeated the chiefdom of Arcot , the <unk> of <unk> , and the Sultan of Madurai and had gained control over Goa in the west and the Tungabhadra @-@ Krishna River doab in the north . The original capital was in the principality of <unk> on the northern banks of the Tungabhadra River in today 's Karnataka . It was later moved to nearby Vijayanagara on the river 's southern banks during the reign of Bukka Raya I. 
 With the Vijayanagara Kingdom now imperial in stature , Harihara II , the second son of Bukka Raya I , further consolidated the kingdom beyond the Krishna River and brought the whole of South India under the Vijayanagara umbrella . The next ruler , Deva Raya I , emerged successful against the <unk> of Odisha and undertook important works of fortification and irrigation . Italian traveler Niccolo de Conti wrote of him as the most powerful ruler of India . Deva Raya II ( called <unk> ) succeeded to the throne in 1424 and was possibly the most capable of the Sangama dynasty rulers . He quelled rebelling feudal lords as well as the Zamorin of Calicut and Quilon in the south . He invaded the island of Lanka and became overlord of the kings of Burma at Pegu and <unk> . The empire declined in the late 15th century until the serious attempts by commander Saluva Narasimha Deva Raya in 1485 and by general Tuluva Narasa Nayaka in 1491 to <unk> the empire . 
 In 1509 , after nearly two decades of conflict with rebellious chieftains , the empire came under the rule of Krishna Deva Raya , the son of Tuluva Narasa Nayaka . In the following decades the Vijayanagara empire dominated all of Southern India and fought off invasions from the five established Deccan Sultanates . The empire reached its peak during the rule of Krishna Deva Raya when Vijayanagara armies were consistently victorious . The empire annexed areas formerly under the Sultanates in the northern Deccan and the territories in the eastern Deccan , including Kalinga , while simultaneously maintaining control over all its subordinates in the south . Many important monuments were either completed or commissioned during the time of Krishna Deva Raya . 
 Krishna Deva Raya was followed by his younger half @-@ brother Achyuta Deva Raya in 1529 . When Achyuta Deva Raya died in 1542 , Sadashiva Raya , the teenage nephew of Achyuta Raya was appointed king though real power was wielded by Rama Raya , Krishna Deva Raya 's son @-@ in @-@ law . When Sadashiva was old enough to claim absolute power , Aliya Rama Raya had him imprisoned and became the de facto ruler . Eager to take advantage of the disunity among the Sultanates of Bijapur , <unk> , Berar , Golkonda , and Bidar , Rama Raya involved himself in the political affairs of the powers across the Krishna river to the north . His ploy of supporting militarily one Sultanate against another , often changing alliances , brought rich rewards for a while . However , by 1563 , exhausted with his intrigues , the bitter rivals from the north formed an alliance . They marched against Rama Raya and clashed with the Vijayanagara 's forces in January 1565 . 
 The capture and killing of Aliya Rama Raya in the famous Battle of Talikota , after a seemingly easy victory for the Vijayanagara armies , created havoc and confusion in the Vijayanagara ranks , which were then completely routed . The Sultanates ' army later plundered Hampi and reduced it to the ruinous state in which it remains ; it was never re @-@ occupied . Tirumala Deva Raya , Rama Raya 's younger brother who was the sole surviving commander , left Vijayanagara for Penukonda with vast amounts of treasure on the back of 1500 elephants . 
 The empire went into a slow decline regionally , although trade with the Portuguese continued , and the British were given a land grant for the establishment of Madras . Tirumala Deva Raya was succeeded by his son Sriranga I later followed by Venkata II who was the last king of Vijayanagara empire , made his capital Chandragiri and Vellore , repulsed the invasion of the Deccan Sultanates and saved Penukonda from being captured . 
 His successor Rama Deva Raya took power and ruled until 1632 , after whose death Venkata III became king and ruled for about ten years . The empire was finally conquered by the Sultanates of Bijapur and Golkonda . The largest feudatories of the Vijayanagar empire – the Mysore Kingdom , Keladi Nayaka , Nayaks of Madurai , Nayaks of Tanjore , Nayakas of <unk> and Nayak Kingdom of Gingee declared independence and went on to have a significant impact on the history of South India in the coming centuries . These Nayaka kingdoms lasted into the 18th century while the Mysore Kingdom remained a princely state until Indian Independence in 1947 although they came under the British Raj in 1799 after the death of Tipu Sultan . 
 = = Governance = = 
 The rulers of the Vijayanagara empire maintained the well @-@ functioning administrative methods developed by their predecessors , the Hoysala , Kakatiya and Pandya kingdoms , to govern their territories and made changes only where necessary . The King was the ultimate authority , assisted by a cabinet of ministers ( <unk> ) headed by the prime minister ( Mahapradhana ) . Other important titles recorded were the chief secretary ( <unk> or <unk> ) and the imperial officers ( Adhikari ) . All high @-@ ranking ministers and officers were required to have military training . A secretariat near the king 's palace employed scribes and officers to maintain records made official by using a wax seal imprinted with the ring of the king . At the lower administrative levels , wealthy feudal landlords ( <unk> ) supervised accountants ( <unk> or <unk> ) and guards ( <unk> ) . The palace administration was divided into 72 departments ( <unk> ) , each having several female attendants chosen for their youth and beauty ( some imported or captured in victorious battles ) who were trained to handle minor administrative matters and to serve men of nobility as courtesans or concubines . 
 The empire was divided into five main provinces ( Rajya ) , each under a commander ( Dandanayaka or Dandanatha ) and headed by a governor , often from the royal family , who used the native language for administrative purposes . A Rajya was divided into regions ( Vishaya <unk> or Kottam ) and further divided into counties ( Sime or Nadu ) , themselves subdivided into municipalities ( Kampana or Sthala ) . Hereditary families ruled their respective territories and paid tribute to the empire , while some areas , such as Keladi and Madurai , came under the direct supervision of a commander . 
 On the battlefield , the king 's commanders led the troops . The empire 's war strategy rarely involved massive invasions ; more often it employed small scale methods such as attacking and destroying individual forts . The empire was among the first in India to use long range artillery commonly manned by foreign gunners ( those from present day Turkmenistan were considered the best ) . Army troops were of two types : The king 's personal army directly recruited by the empire and the feudal army under each feudatory . King Krishnadevaraya 's personal army consisted of 100 @,@ 000 infantry , 20 @,@ 000 cavalrymen and over 900 elephants . This number was only a part of the army numbering over 1 @.@ 1 million soldiers , a figure that varied as an army of two million has also been recorded along with the existence of a navy as evidenced by the use of the term <unk> ( commander of the navy ) . The army recruited from all classes of society ( supported by the collection of additional feudal tributes from feudatory rulers ) , and consisted of archers and musketeers wearing quilted tunics , <unk> with swords and <unk> in their girdles , and soldiers carrying shields so large that no armour was necessary . The horses and elephants were fully armoured and the elephants had knives fastened to their tusks to do maximum damage in battle . 
 The capital city was completely dependent on the water supply systems constructed to channel and store water , ensuring a consistent supply throughout the year . The remains of these hydraulic systems have given historians a picture of the prevailing surface water distribution methods in use at that time in the semiarid regions of South India . Contemporary records and notes of foreign travelers describe how huge tanks were constructed by labourers . Excavations have uncovered the remains of a well @-@ connected water distribution system existing solely within the royal enclosure and the large temple complexes ( suggesting it was for the exclusive use of royalty , and for special ceremonies ) with sophisticated channels using gravity and siphons to transport water through pipelines . The only structures resembling public waterworks are the remains of large water tanks that collected the seasonal monsoon water and then dried up in summer except for the few fed by springs . In the fertile agricultural areas near the Tungabhadra River , canals were dug to guide the river water into irrigation tanks . These canals had sluices that were opened and closed to control the water flow . In other areas the administration encouraged the digging of wells monitored by administrative authorities . Large tanks in the capital city were constructed with royal patronage while smaller tanks were funded by wealthy individuals to gain social and religious merit . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The economy of the empire was largely dependent on agriculture . Sorghum ( <unk> ) , cotton , and pulse legumes grew in semi @-@ arid regions , while sugarcane , rice , and wheat thrived in rainy areas . Betel leaves , areca ( for chewing ) , and coconut were the principal cash crops , and large scale cotton production supplied the weaving centers of the empire 's vibrant textile industry . Spices such as turmeric , pepper , cardamom , and ginger grew in the remote Malnad hill region and were transported to the city for trade . The empire 's capital city was a thriving business centre that included a burgeoning market in large quantities of precious gems and gold . Prolific temple @-@ building provided employment to thousands of masons , sculptors , and other skilled artisans . 
 Land ownership was important . Most of the growers were tenant farmers and were given the right of part ownership of the land over time . Tax policies encouraging needed produce made distinctions between land use to determine tax levies . For example , the daily market availability of rose petals was important for perfumers , so cultivation of roses received a lower tax assessment . Salt production and the manufacture of salt pans were controlled by similar means . The making of ghee ( clarified butter ) , which was sold as an oil for human consumption and as a fuel for lighting lamps , was profitable . Exports to China intensified and included cotton , spices , jewels , semi @-@ precious stones , ivory , rhino horn , ebony , amber , coral , and aromatic products such as perfumes . Large vessels from China made frequent visits , some captained by the Chinese Admiral Zheng He , and brought Chinese products to the empire 's 300 ports , large and small , on the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal . The ports of Mangalore , <unk> , Bhatkal , Barkur , Cochin , Cannanore , Machilipatnam , and <unk> were the most important . 
 When merchant ships docked , the merchandise was taken into official custody and taxes levied on all items sold . The security of the merchandise was guaranteed by the administration officials . Traders of many nationalities ( Arabs , Persians , <unk> , <unk> ) settled in Calicut , drawn by the thriving trade business . Ship building prospered and keeled ships of 1000 – 1200 <unk> ( burden ) were built without decks by sewing the entire hull with ropes rather than fastening them with nails . Ships sailed to the Red Sea ports of Aden and Mecca with Vijayanagara goods sold as far away as Venice . The empire 's principal exports were pepper , ginger , cinnamon , cardamom , <unk> , tamarind timber , <unk> , precious and semi @-@ precious stones , pearls , musk , ambergris , rhubarb , aloe , cotton cloth and porcelain . Cotton yarn was shipped to Burma and indigo to Persia . Chief imports from Palestine were copper , quicksilver ( mercury ) , vermilion , coral , saffron , coloured velvets , rose water , knives , coloured <unk> , gold and silver . Persian horses were imported to Cannanore before a two @-@ week land trip to the capital . Silk arrived from China and sugar from Bengal . 
 East coast trade hummed , with goods arriving from Golkonda where rice , millet , pulses and tobacco were grown on a large scale . Dye crops of indigo and <unk> root were produced for the weaving industry . A mineral rich region , Machilipatnam was the gateway for high quality iron and steel exports . Diamond mining was active in the <unk> region . The cotton weaving industry produced two types of cottons , plain calico and muslin ( brown , bleached or dyed ) . Cloth printed with coloured patterns crafted by native techniques were exported to Java and the Far East . Golkonda specialised in plain cotton and Pulicat in printed . The main imports on the east coast were non @-@ ferrous metals , camphor , porcelain , silk and luxury goods . 
 = = Culture = = 
 = = = Social life = = = 
 Most information on the social life in Vijayanagara empire comes from the writings of foreign visitors and evidence that research teams in the Vijayanagara area have uncovered . The Hindu caste system was prevalent and rigidly followed , with each caste represented by a local body of elders who represented the community . These elders set the rules and regulations that were implemented with the help of royal decrees . Untouchability was part of the caste system and these communities were represented by leaders ( <unk> ) . The Muslim communities were represented by their own group in coastal Karnataka . The caste system did not , however , prevent distinguished persons from all castes from being promoted to high @-@ ranking cadre in the army and administration . In civil life , by virtue of the caste system , Brahmins enjoyed a high level of respect . With the exception of a few who took to military careers , most Brahmins concentrated on religious and literary matters . Their separation from material wealth and power made them ideal arbiters in local judicial matters , and their presence in every town and village was a calculated investment made by the nobility and aristocracy to maintain order . However , the popularity of low @-@ caste scholars ( such as Molla and Kanakadasa ) and their works ( including those of <unk> and Sarvajna ) is an indication of the degree of social fluidity in the society . 
 The practice of Sati was common , though voluntary , and mostly practiced among the upper classes . Over fifty inscriptions attesting to this have been discovered in the Vijayanagara principality alone . These inscriptions are called <unk> ( Sati stone ) or Sati @-@ <unk> ( Sati hero stone ) . <unk> commemorated the death of a woman by entering into fire after the death of her husband while Sati @-@ <unk> were made for a woman who performed Sati after her husband 's heroic death . Either way , the woman was raised to the level of a demi @-@ goddess and proclaimed by the sculpture of a Sun and crescent moon on the stone . 
 The socio @-@ religious movements of the previous centuries , such as Lingayatism , provided momentum for flexible social norms to which women were expected to abide . By this time South Indian women had crossed most barriers and were actively involved in matters hitherto considered the monopoly of men , such as administration , business and trade , and involvement in the fine arts . <unk> Devi who wrote <unk> Parinayam and <unk> who wrote <unk> were among the notable women poets of the era . Early Telugu women poets like <unk> <unk> and <unk> Molla became popular during this period . The court of the Nayaks of Tanjore is known to have patronised several women poets . The Devadasi system existed , as well as legalised prostitution relegated to a few streets in each city . The popularity of harems amongst men of the royalty is well known from records . 
 Well @-@ to @-@ do men wore the <unk> <unk> , a tall turban made of silk and decorated with gold . As in most Indian societies , jewellery was used by men and women and records describe the use of anklets , bracelets , finger @-@ rings , necklaces and ear rings of various types . During celebrations , men and women adorned themselves with flower garlands and used perfumes made of rose water , civet musk , musk or sandalwood . In stark contrast to the commoners whose lives were modest , the lives of the empire 's kings and queens were full of ceremonial pomp in the court . Queens and princesses had numerous attendants who were lavishly dressed and adorned with fine jewellery , their daily duties being light . 
 Physical exercises were popular with men and wrestling was an important male preoccupation for sport and entertainment . Even women wrestlers are mentioned in records . <unk> have been discovered inside royal quarters and records speak of regular physical training for commanders and their armies during peace time . Royal palaces and market places had special arenas where royalty and common people alike amused themselves by watching matches such as cock fights , ram fights and wrestling between women . Excavations within the Vijayanagara city limits have revealed the existence of various types of community @-@ based activities in the form of engravings on boulders , rock platforms and temple floors , implying these were places of casual social interaction . Some of these games are in use today and others are yet to be identified . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 The Vijayanagara kings were tolerant of all religions and sects , as writings by foreign visitors show . The kings used titles such as <unk> <unk> ( literally , " protector of cows and Brahmins " ) and <unk> ( lit , " upholder of Hindu faith " ) that testified to their intention of protecting Hinduism and yet were at the same time staunchly <unk> in their court ceremonials and dress , as Philip Wagoner points out in his 1996 article " Sultan Among Hindu Kings " published in the Journal of Asian Studies . The empire 's founders , Harihara I and Bukka Raya I , were devout Shaivas ( worshippers of Shiva ) , but made grants to the Vaishnava order of Sringeri with Vidyaranya as their patron saint , and designated Varaha ( the boar , an Avatar of Vishnu ) as their emblem . Over one @-@ fourth of the archaeological dig found an " Islamic Quarter " not far from the " Royal Quarter " . Nobles from Central Asia 's Timurid kingdoms also came to Vijayanagara . The later Saluva and Tuluva kings were Vaishnava by faith , but worshipped at the feet of Lord Virupaksha ( Shiva ) at Hampi as well as Lord Venkateshwara ( Vishnu ) at Tirupati . A Sanskrit work , Jambavati Kalyanam by King Krishnadevaraya , called Lord Virupaksha Karnata Rajya Raksha Mani ( " protective jewel of Karnata Empire " ) . The kings patronised the saints of the <unk> order ( philosophy of dualism ) of Madhvacharya at Udupi . 
 The Bhakti ( devotional ) movement was active during this time , and involved well known Haridasas ( devotee saints ) of that time . Like the Virashaiva movement of the 12th century , this movement presented another strong current of devotion , pervading the lives of millions . The haridasas represented two groups , the <unk> and <unk> , the former being required to be proficient in the Vedas , Upanishads and other <unk> , while the <unk> merely conveyed the message of Madhvacharya through the Kannada language to the people in the form of devotional songs ( <unk> and <unk> ) . The philosophy of Madhvacharya was spread by eminent disciples such as Naraharitirtha , Jayatirtha , Sripadaraya , Vyasatirtha , Vadirajatirtha and others . Vyasatirtha , the guru ( teacher ) of Vadirajatirtha , Purandaradasa ( Father of Carnatic music ) and Kanakadasa earned the devotion of King Krishnadevaraya . The king considered the saint his <unk> ( family deity ) and honoured him in his writings . During this time , another great composer of early carnatic music , <unk> composed hundreds of <unk> in Telugu at Tirupati in present @-@ day Andhra Pradesh . 
 The defeat of the Jain Western Ganga Dynasty by the Cholas in the early 11th century and the rising numbers of followers of Vaishnava Hinduism and Virashaivism in the 12th century was mirrored by a decreased interest in Jainism . Two notable locations of Jain worship in the Vijayanagara territory were Shravanabelagola and Kambadahalli . 
 Islamic contact with South India began as early as the 7th century , a result of trade between the Southern kingdoms and Arab lands . <unk> <unk> existed in the Rashtrakuta empire by the 10th century and many mosques flourished on the Malabar coast by the early 14th century . Muslim settlers married local women ; their children were known as <unk> ( Moplahs ) and were actively involved in horse trading and manning shipping fleets . The interactions between the Vijayanagara empire and the Bahamani Sultanates to the north increased the presence of Muslims in the south . The introduction of Christianity began as early as the 8th century as shown by the finding of copper plates inscribed with land grants to Malabar Christians . Christian travelers wrote of the scarcity of Christians in South India in the Middle Ages , promoting its attractiveness to missionaries . The arrival of the Portuguese in the 15th century and their connections through trade with the empire , the propagation of the faith by Saint Xavier ( 1545 ) and later the presence of Dutch settlements fostered the growth of Christianity in the south . 
 = = = Language = = = 
 Kannada , Telugu and Tamil were used in their respective regions of the empire . Over 7000 inscriptions ( Shilashasana ) including 300 copper plate inscriptions ( Tamarashasana ) have been recovered , almost half of which are in Kannada , the remaining in Telugu , Tamil and Sanskrit . Bilingual inscriptions had lost favour by the 14th century . The empire minted coins at Hampi , <unk> and Tirupati with Nagari , Kannada and Telugu legends usually carrying the name of the ruler . Gold , silver and copper were used to issue coins called <unk> , Varaha , Pon , Pagoda , <unk> , Pana , Kasu and <unk> . The coins contained the images of various gods including Balakrishna ( infant Krishna ) , Venkateshwara ( the presiding deity of the temple at Tirupati ) , goddesses such as Bhudevi and Sridevi , divine couples , animals such as bulls and elephants and birds . The earliest coins feature Hanuman and Garuda ( divine eagle ) , the vehicle of Lord Vishnu . Kannada and Telugu inscriptions have been deciphered and recorded by historians of the Archaeological Survey of India . 
 = = = Literature = = = 
 During the rule of the Vijayanagara Empire , poets , scholars and philosophers wrote primarily in Kannada , Telugu and Sanskrit , and also in other regional languages such as Tamil and covered such subjects as religion , biography , Prabandha ( fiction ) , music , grammar , poetry , medicine and mathematics . The administrative and court languages of the Empire were Kannada and Telugu — the latter was the court language and gained even more cultural prominence during the reign of the last Vijayanagara kings . Telugu was a popular literary medium , reaching its peak under the patronage of Krishnadevaraya . 
 Most Sanskrit works were commentaries either on the Vedas or on the Ramayana and Mahabharata epics , written by well known figures such as Sayana and Vidyaranya that extolled the superiority of the Advaita philosophy over other rival Hindu philosophies . Other writers were famous Dvaita saints of the Udupi order such as Jayatirtha ( earning the title <unk> for his <unk> writings ) , Vyasatirtha who wrote rebuttals to the Advaita philosophy and of the conclusions of earlier logicians , and Vadirajatirtha and Sripadaraya both of whom criticised the beliefs of Adi Sankara . Apart from these saints , noted Sanskrit scholars adorned the courts of the Vijayanagara kings and their feudatory chiefdoms . Many kings of the dynasty were themselves <unk> and authored classics such as King Krishnadevaraya 's Jambavati Kalyana , a poetic and dramatically skillful work . Princess <unk> , wife of Kumara Kampana the son of Bukka I , wrote the Sanskrit work Madura <unk> ( or <unk> Charita ) , detailing the invasion and conquest of the Madurai Sultanate by the <unk> Kingdom . 
 The Kannada poets and scholars of the empire produced important writings supporting the Vaishnava Bhakti movement heralded by the Haridasas ( devotees of Vishnu ) , Brahminical and Virashaiva ( Lingayatism ) literature . The Haridasa poets celebrated their devotion through songs called <unk> ( lyrical poems ) in the native meters of Sangatya ( quatrain ) , <unk> ( beat based ) , <unk> ( melody based ) and <unk> ( cryptic ) . Their inspirations were the teachings of Madhvacharya and Vyasatirtha . Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa are considered the foremost among many <unk> ( devotees ) by virtue of their immense contribution . Kumara Vyasa , the most notable of Brahmin scholars wrote <unk> Bharata , a translation of the epic Mahabharata . This work marks a transition of Kannada literature from old Kannada to modern Kannada . Chamarasa was a famous Virashaiva scholar and poet who had many debates with Vaishnava scholars in the court of Devaraya II . His Prabhulinga Lile , later translated into Telugu and Tamil , was a eulogy of Saint Allama Prabhu ( the saint was considered an incarnation of Lord Ganapathi while Parvati took the form of a princess of Banavasi ) . 
 At this peak of Telugu literature , the most famous writing in the Prabandha style was <unk> . King Krishnadevaraya was an accomplished Telugu scholar and wrote the celebrated Amuktamalyada . In his court were the eight famous scholars regarded as the pillars ( <unk> ) of the literary assembly . The most famous among them were Allasani Peddana honoured with the title <unk> ( father of Telugu poetry ) and <unk> Ramakrishna , Krishnadevaraya 's court jester who authored several acclaimed works . The other six poets were Nandi <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> <unk> , <unk> Mallana , <unk> Murthi ( <unk> <unk> ) , Pingali <unk> , and <unk> . This was the age of <unk> , the greatest of all Telugu poets in legend , who wrote books like <unk> and <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ sati . He was patronised by King Devaraya II and his stature was equal to the most important ministers in the court . 
 King Krishnadevaraya himself composed the epic poem Amuktamalyada in Telugu , which is considered as a masterpiece . Amuktamalyada translates to one who wears and gives away garlands , and describes the story of the wedding of Lord Vishnu to Andal , the Tamil Alvar saint poetess and the daughter of <unk> , at Srirangam . 
 Though much of the Tamil literature from this period came from Tamil speaking regions ruled by the feudatory Pandya who gave particular attention on the cultivation of Tamil literature , some poets were patronised by the Vijayanagara kings . <unk> Desikar wrote an anthology of <unk> verses , <unk> @-@ <unk> , on the Advaita philosophy . His pupil the ascetic , <unk> , wrote a shorter anthology , <unk> , that contained about half the number of verses . Krishnadevaraya patronised the Tamil Vaishnava poet Haridasa whose <unk> <unk> was an exposition of the two Hindu systems , Vaishnava and Shaiva , with a preference for the former . 
 Notable among secular writings on music and medicine were Vidyaranya 's <unk> , <unk> Raya 's <unk> , Sayana 's Ayurveda <unk> and Lakshmana Pandita 's <unk> . The Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics flourished during this period under such well known scholars as Madhava ( c . 1340 – 1425 ) who made important contributions to <unk> and Calculus , and Nilakantha Somayaji ( c . 1444 – 1545 ) who postulated on the orbitals of planets . 
 = = = Architecture = = = 
 Vijayanagara architecture is a vibrant combination of the Chalukya , Hoysala , Pandya and Chola styles , idioms that prospered in previous centuries . Its legacy of sculpture , architecture and painting influenced the development of the arts long after the empire came to an end . Its stylistic hallmark is the ornate pillared <unk> ( marriage hall ) , <unk> ( open pillared halls ) and the <unk> ( tower ) . Artisans used the locally available hard granite because of its durability since the kingdom was under constant threat of invasion . While the empire 's monuments are spread over the whole of Southern India , nothing surpasses the vast open @-@ air theatre of monuments at its capital at Vijayanagara , a UNESCO World Heritage Site . 
 In the 14th century the kings continued to build <unk> or Deccan @-@ style monuments but later incorporated Dravida @-@ style gopurams to meet their ritualistic needs . The Prasanna Virupaksha temple ( underground temple ) of Bukka and the Hazare Rama temple of Deva Raya are examples of Deccan architecture . The varied and intricate ornamentation of the pillars is a mark of their work . At Hampi , though the Vitthala temple is the best example of their pillared <unk> style , the Hazara Ramaswamy temple is a modest but perfectly finished example . A visible aspect of their style is their return to the simplistic and serene art developed by the Chalukya dynasty . A grand specimen of Vijayanagara art , the Vitthala temple , took several decades to complete during the reign of the Tuluva kings . 
 Another element of the Vijayanagara style is the carving and consecration of large monoliths such as the <unk> ( mustard ) Ganesha and <unk> ( ground nut ) Ganesha at Hampi , the <unk> ( Bahubali ) monoliths in Karkala and <unk> , and the Nandi bull in Lepakshi . The Vijayanagara temples of Kolar , <unk> , <unk> and other towns of Karnataka ; the temples of <unk> , Lepakshi , Ahobilam , Tirumala Venkateswara Temple and <unk> in Andhra Pradesh ; and the temples of Vellore , Kumbakonam , Kanchi and Srirangam in Tamil Nadu are examples of this style . Vijayanagara art includes wall @-@ paintings such as the Dashavatara and Girijakalyana ( marriage of Parvati , Shiva 's consort ) in the Virupaksha Temple at Hampi , the <unk> murals ( tales of Shiva ) at the Virabhadra temple at Lepakshi , and those at the <unk> and Varadaraja temples at Kanchi . This mingling of the South Indian styles resulted in a richness not seen in earlier centuries , a focus on reliefs in addition to sculpture that surpasses that previously in India . 
 An aspect of Vijayanagara architecture that shows the cosmopolitanism of the great city is the presence of many secular structures bearing Islamic features . While political history concentrates on the ongoing conflict between the Vijayanagara empire and the Deccan Sultanates , the architectural record reflects a more creative interaction . There are many arches , domes and vaults that show these influences . The concentration of structures like pavilions , stables and towers suggests they were for use by royalty . The decorative details of these structures may have been absorbed into Vijayanagara architecture during the early 15th century , coinciding with the rule of Deva Raya I and Deva Raya II . These kings are known to have employed many Muslims in their army and court , some of whom may have been Muslim architects . This harmonious exchange of architectural ideas must have happened during rare periods of peace between the Hindu and Muslim kingdoms . The " Great Platform " ( Mahanavami <unk> ) has relief carvings in which the figures seem to have the facial features of central Asian Turks who were known to have been employed as royal attendants . 
 = Van Morrison : No Surrender = 
 Van Morrison : No Surrender is a biography of musician Van Morrison , written by Johnny Rogan . It was first published in 2005 by Secker & Warburg , and another edition was published by Vintage Books in 2006 . Rogan interviewed musicians and friends of Morrison , and spent 20 years researching the book and four years writing it . The book is comprehensive , and goes into detail about multiple facets of Morrison 's life . Rogan recounts Morrison 's youth in Belfast , Northern Ireland , and how early experiences there informed his music . He discusses how Morrison joined various bands before experiencing success with Them . Morrison later signed a contract with Bert Berns and moved to New York , where he became quite popular after recording " Brown Eyed Girl " and albums Astral Weeks and Moondance . Rogan comments on Morrison 's exploration of spirituality , and describes how these experiences influenced his musical work . The biography discusses Morrison 's move to Britain and then Dublin , and his relationship with model Michelle Rocca . 
 The book received mostly positive reviews in the media . Kirkus Reviews called it " a narrative of propulsive drive that is also a reflective , associative piece of social history , " and The Sunday Independent described it as " an exhaustive study " . The Sunday Times noted : " What makes this book worthwhile is its fiercely illuminating angle . ... Morrison , as usual , declined to take part but the author 's scholarly methods lend this weighty volume a real authority . " The Irish Times referred to the biography as a " superb book " , and a review in The Observer stated " This characteristically accomplished biography shows the singer from every angle . " Diarmaid Ferriter selected the book as his pick in The Sunday Business Post feature " Authors ' choices " . The book received negative reviews in The Toronto Star and The Herald .

 Prior to completing the book , Rogan had written music biographies on The Byrds , The Smiths , and Neil Young . According to Kirkus Reviews , " there is nary a word directly from the reclusive Morrison 's lips " in the book . The Irish Independent reported that the author relied on interviews with " friends , acquaintances and musicians " . Rogan spent over 20 years researching the book , and it took him four years to write it . 
 Rogan recounted to The Irish Times the value he obtained from interviews with Morrison 's first wife , as well as his partner in a later relationship , Michelle Rocca . " Here was a man who had explored all these mystic religions , had undergone Gestalt therapy , who had been told by a <unk> master that he had something called an ' Angelic Knot ' , suddenly hanging around fashionable nightclubs and being written about in gossip columns . The relationship with Michelle Rocca certainly helped , in that I got more out of one single interview done by Michelle Rocca than I did , in entirety , from his first wife , Janet Planet , " said Rogan . 
 When it became public in early 2005 that the book would be published , representatives of Morrison contacted the publishers of the book . Said Rogan to The Irish Times : " There has been contact with the publishers , I know that much . When the news broke earlier this year that the book was being published , his lawyers asked to see an advance copy of the manuscript . The publishers refused the request . But then this is a man who when he learnt that there was going to be a plaque erected outside his former Belfast home , got his solicitors to write to the Belfast Telegraph dissociating himself from the tribute . " The book was first published in 2005 by Secker & Warburg , and a 2006 edition was published by Vintage Books . Johnny Rogan appeared on a panel of experts in the 2008 documentary Van Morrison : Under Review 1964 – 1974 , along with Steve Turner , author of the 1993 biography Van Morrison : Too Late to Stop Now .

 Rogan writes in the book 's introduction : " an important caveat to any serious , well @-@ researched biography or study of Morrison 's life is that the reader should be aware that a number of allegations against the subject cannot be featured in print for legal reasons . The author may feel that the final portrayal is far too flattering in certain places , while the reader who neglects to read between the lines may think the biographer could have been a little more sympathetic at times . Death alone will open this Pandora 's box . " Morrison himself is quoted on the first page of the book , saying : " Rogan 's got something to hide . What 's he hiding ? I 'd like to do a book on him . " 
 The biography is comprehensive , covering many different aspects of its subject 's life . The author discusses Morrison 's early life in Belfast , Northern Ireland , and how this influenced his perspective of " no surrender " , a reference to Ulster Unionism . Rogan writes how , a young boy , Morrison exhibited " poor communication skills , aggressive impatience , and absence of empathy " , and yearned for positive relations between his Protestant and Catholic friends . The author notes that a theme of Morrison 's youth was his appreciation of music and his pleasure of creating music influenced by gospel and love . He cites Morrison 's cousin Jackie Stitt who said : " He could have been a good sportsman but he had no interest in it at all . He 'd play along with you for a while until he got bored – he seemed to tire of it quickly . He 'd go indoors . " 
 Morrison did not excel at academics , and focused instead on music . He practised his music in solitude , and was not skilled at socialising . " One time he said to me it wasn 't that he didn 't want to talk , but tunes were running through his head all the time . He said he didn 't know whether he 'd been blessed or cursed because the words and music wouldn 't go out of his head , " said his mother Violet . 
 The book focuses on Morrison 's musical profession . Morrison joined a band called The <unk> , which became The Javelins . He joined up with a showband called the Monarchs , then another called Manhattan , and another called the Gamblers . The Gamblers became the group Them , and Morrison developed his stage presence . " He was a wee runt . Offstage you wouldn 't have looked sideways at him . But on stage it was different . There was an animalistic sexuality that he didn 't have in his person , " said a female fan of Morrison 's who witnessed him perform with the band . 
 The band Them was signed by Phil Solomon , who contracted producer Bert Berns to work with the group , and Phil Coulter came on as a musical arranger and lyricist . The group became popular with songs including " Baby Please Don 't Go " , " Gloria " , and " Here Comes the Night " . Morrison commented of Them : " Them were never meant to be on Top of the Pops . I mean , miming ? lip syncing ? We used to laugh at that programme , think it was a joke . Then we were on it ourselves . It was ridiculous . We were totally anti that sort of thing . We were really into the blues ... and we had to get into suits and have make @-@ up put on and all that shit . " 
 The group were not sociable with reporters , and according to the book Morrison 's drinking habits made him reclusive . " I regret that we couldn 't have controlled Morrison better ... I think he would have been big if he 'd been straightened out at the beginning of his career , " comments Phil Solomon about Morrison . " He was on a downer and he was drinking . He wasn 't the most bankable of artists . He had been the frontman for another of those R & B bands that had gone up the Swanee and there were three or four versions of Them touring . It was a joke . He was no gift . There weren 't record companies falling over themselves to sign him up . " says Phil Coulter in the book . 
 Morrison signed a contract with Bert Berns , and just before he left for New York made a speech to his friends and ended with : " One day you 'll see my picture up on the wall and you 'll all say ' I knew him ' . " An acquaintance who witnessed the speech told the author : " He knew he was different and that his music was good but I thought he was such a nasty character ; always rude and quite vulgar . " Morrison recorded the song " Brown Eyed Girl " in New York with Berns , as well as the album Astral Weeks . He became much more popular with the album Moondance , and Rolling Stone commented he had " the striking imagination of a consciousness that is visionary in the strongest sense of the word " . Morrison 's image graced the cover of Rolling Stone a year after releasing Moondance . 
 Rogan discusses Morrison 's exploration of religion and spirituality . He cites Tom Paulin , a poet based in Belfast , who notes : " Morrison comes out of not traditional Protestantism , but evangelical Protestantism . That 's the foundation of his imagination . He 's testifying . " Rogan recounts how Morrison became exposed to alternative practices including Gestalt therapy and Rosicrucianism . According to Rogan , Morrison 's exploration of mysticism , Christianity , Jehovah 's Witnesses , and Scientology were influential in his works including Astral Weeks , " Kingdom Hall " , Enlightenment and " Whenever God Shines His Light " . Morrison became wealthy through his music , but he became less successful over the next 20 years of his career . He moved back to Europe , and lived in Britain and then settled in Dublin in the 1990s . He met model Michelle Rocca at a fundraiser held at <unk> Castle , and they began a relationship .

 A review of the book in Kirkus Reviews described it as a " nearly breath @-@ by @-@ breath biography " , and comments : " Rogan 's analyses of Morrison 's musical palette , critical standing and public image are exhaustive yet never exhausting . ... Sprightly despite its amplitude , a narrative of propulsive drive that is also a reflective , associative piece of social history . " The title of a review in the Irish Independent referred to the book as " an enthralling new biography of the Belfast cowboy " , and The Sunday Independent called it " an exhaustive study of Belfast 's most famous musical son " . A review in The Observer commented of the book : " This characteristically accomplished biography shows the singer from every angle . " 
 Robert Sandall gave the book a positive review in The Sunday Times , and wrote : " What makes this book worthwhile is its fiercely illuminating angle . ... Morrison , as usual , declined to take part but the author 's scholarly methods lend this weighty volume a real authority . " The Journal Gazette called the book : " A definitive , provocative and revelatory portrait of an endlessly complicated man and his music . " A review in The Irish Times characterised the book as a " magical " journey into Van Morrison 's life , noting : " Johnny Rogan spent 23 years researching his biography of Van Morrison . It shows . In a book that really should have been titled Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Van Morrison But Were Too Petrified To Ask , this is a magical ' into the mystic ' journey which <unk> takes you from Edward Carson to Leadbelly , from the Mafia to the <unk> , from drinking stories to Gestalt therapy , and from Bernadette Devlin to Terry Keane . " Brian Boyd of The Irish Times described Rogan 's work as a " superb book " . 
 Diarmaid Ferriter selected the book as his pick in The Sunday Business Post feature " Authors ' choices " . Ferriter commented : " Rogan has to be admired for his perseverance and determination when it comes to chronicling the life and times of contrary musical giants – having previously tackled Morrissey . Well @-@ researched biography is always to be encouraged , particularly when dealing with a difficult and elusive character " . David Sinclair , author of Wannabe : How The Spice Girls Reinvented Pop Fam , reviewed the book for The Guardian , and commented : " Rogan 's scrutiny of Morrison 's work is undertaken with no less care than that devoted to the details of the singer 's life story , and the analysis and appreciation of Morrison 's very real accomplishments as a musician provide some welcome ballast to a personal portrayal that is otherwise almost comically unflattering . Rogan 's book certainly sheds new light on the life and times of this puzzling and reclusive performer . " Sinclair also noted the book takes a negative tone towards some of Morrison 's mannerisms , and concluded his review with : " But it may be as well to get hold of a copy before Morrison 's legal representatives have had a chance to get out their fine @-@ tooth combs . " 
 Jonathan O 'Brien recommended the book in a review in The Sunday Business Post , but noted it focuses more on his life than an analysis of his music : " If you want a meticulously researched , mind @-@ bogglingly detailed account of his early years growing up in Belfast , his schooldays in Orangefield , his time as an unpopular member of the Olympics showband and so on , then , once again , No Surrender is heartily recommended . If , however , you 're expecting a rigorous and comprehensive analysis of Morrison 's music , of its textures , its surfaces – how and why it sounds the way it does – then you 've probably come to the wrong place . " O 'Brien concluded his review by writing : " For all its flaws , No Surrender is a strong , absorbing biography , and never less than well written . It 's just that it could potentially have been far , far better . " John Beck of The Press Democrat observed that the biography " paints him [ Morrison ] as a mercurial genius at best and a cantankerous lout on a bad day " . In their 2008 book Northern Ireland After the Troubles , Colin Coulter and Michael Murray referenced the biography and stated it puts forth " the view that Morrison 's persona has been shaped by a specifically Ulster Protestant sensibility " . Bernard Perusse of The Gazette described the earlier biography Van Morrison : Too Late to Stop Now as " more superficial but more positive " than Rogan 's book . 
 Kevin Courtney reviewed the book for The Irish Times , and observed : " For fans of Van Morrison 's music , No Surrender might seem somewhat blasphemous , focusing not so much on Van the artist , but on Van the not @-@ very @-@ nice man . But Rogan also pays tribute to Morrison 's pure , untainted artistry , and details the development – and subsequent decline – of Morrison 's muse over the past 40 years or so . For the serious Van @-@ <unk> , Rogan 's painstaking research yields an abundance of detail about Morrison 's early years " . Graeme Green of the Daily Express noted that Rogan " concentrates far more on Van the man than it does on his music , with the singer largely portrayed as difficult , selfish and aloof " . He noted that Morrison would turn 60 the year the book was published , and commented " When the singer celebrates his landmark birthday this year , it 's a safe bet Rogan 's name won 't be on the invite list . " 
 Nick Krewen gave the book a negative review in The Toronto Star . Krewen critiqued what he saw as the thesis to Rogan 's book , commenting : " Here is the premise of Van Morrison : No Surrender : Because the Belfast @-@ born Morrison was raised in Ulster ... and subjected to violent religious prejudice , the musician embodies a symbolic metaphor of Northern Ireland 's defiant nature . That 's it . " Krewen noted that " the book does capture Van the Man 's evolution into an electrifying showman during his Monarchs and Them years . " The book also received a negative review from Martin Tierney in The Herald , who wrote : " The title here is more than a little contrived as Rogan attempts to draw parallels with the sectarian troubles in Morrison 's home turf and the maestro himself . It doesn 't work , given that Morrison has never been political , thankfully sticking to music . It is , however , detailed and comprehensive in its sources , and as such carries on that great tradition of bashing the odious one . " 
 = McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink = 
 McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink or McCormick Tribune Plaza is a multi @-@ purpose venue within Millennium Park in the Loop community area of Chicago , Illinois , in the United States . On December 20 , 2001 , it became the first attraction in Millennium Park to open . The $ 3 @.@ 2 million plaza was funded by a donation from the McCormick Tribune Foundation . It has served as an ice skating rink , a dining facility and briefly as an open @-@ air exhibition space . 
 The plaza operates as McCormick Tribune Ice Rink , a free public outdoor ice skating rink that is generally open four months a year , from mid @-@ November until mid @-@ March , when it hosts over 100 @,@ 000 skaters annually . It is known as one of Chicago 's better outdoor people @-@ watching locations during the winter months . It is operated by the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs rather than the Chicago Park District , which operates most major public ice skating rinks in Chicago . 
 For the rest of the year , it serves as Plaza at Park Grill or Park Grill Plaza , Chicago 's largest outdoor dining facility . The 150 @-@ seat park grill hosts various culinary events as well as music during its months of outdoor operation , and it is affiliated with the 300 @-@ seat indoor Park Grill restaurant located beneath AT & T Plaza and Cloud Gate . The outdoor restaurant offers scenic views of the park .

 Lying between Lake Michigan to the east and the Loop to the west , Grant Park has been Chicago 's front yard since the mid @-@ 19th century . Its northwest corner , north of Monroe Street and the Art Institute , east of Michigan Avenue , south of Randolph Street , and west of Columbus Drive , had been Illinois Central rail yards and parking lots until 1997 , when it was made available for development by the city as Millennium Park . As of 2007 , Millennium Park , which is located in the northwest corner of Grant Park , trails only Navy Pier as a Chicago tourist attraction . 
 The earliest plans for Millennium Park were unveiled by Chicago 's mayor , Richard M. Daley , in March 1998 and included " a reflecting pool that would double as a skating rink in winter " . The architectural firm of Skidmore , Owings & Merrill came up with the master plan for the park ; their original design for the ice rink placed it along upper Randolph Street , on the park 's northern edge . However , McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink was built on the western edge of Millennium Park . The Chicago Tribune 's Pulitzer Prize @-@ winning architecture critic Blair Kamin called this move " a masterstroke " and praised the new location " where the skaters symbolize the year @-@ round vitality of the city " . Kamin noted the location on the east side of Michigan Avenue allowed those at the plaza and ice rink to enjoy the skyline of the Historic Michigan Boulevard District . Another addition to the plaza and rink 's design was the 300 @-@ seat restaurant ; the final architectural design was completed by OWP & P Architects , who were also the architects for the adjoining Wrigley Square . 
 Although the rink was budgeted for $ 5 million , it was constructed for only $ 3 @.@ 2 million ( $ 4 @.@ 3 million today ) , making it one of the few Millennium Park attractions to cost less than was initially budgeted . The rink was funded by and named for the McCormick Tribune Foundation , which was established by former Chicago Tribune owner and publisher Robert R. McCormick . The McCormick Tribune Foundation is a supporter of the McCormick Tribune Freedom Museum and the McCormick Tribune Campus Center at the Illinois Institute of Technology , both of which are also located in Chicago . 
 McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink was the first feature in Millennium Park to open . Its grand opening was celebrated on December 20 , 2001 , a few weeks ahead of the Millennium Park underground parking garage . Mayor Daley , McCormick Tribune Foundation Chairman of the Board John W. Madigan , Millennium Park private donor group chief John Bryan , actress Bonnie Hunt and other local celebrities attended the event . The new ice rink was seen as a replacement for " Skate on State " , a public skating rink on State Street in the Loop which closed in 2001 . 
 From June 21 to September 15 , 2002 , McCormick Tribune Plaza hosted the inaugural exhibit in Millennium Park , Exelon Presents Earth From Above by Yann Arthus @-@ Bertrand , a French aerial photographer . Arthus @-@ Bertrand used planes and helicopters to photograph sites in over 60 countries on every continent , and displayed more than 120 of these photographs in dozens of cities , starting in Paris and including Tokyo and Geneva . In the summer of 2002 , the book associated with the exhibit had sold over 1 @.@ 5 million copies , and the photographs were displayed in Brazil , Lebanon , Poland , Sweden , Germany , Britain , Norway , Hungary and along the banks of the Volga River in Russia . 
 Chicago was the first American city to host the Earth From Above exhibition . The exhibit featured 4 @-@ by @-@ 6 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 2 m × 1 @.@ 8 m ) photographic prints that were laminated onto thin 5 @-@ by @-@ 7 @.@ 5 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 5 m × 2 @.@ 3 m ) aluminum panels that protected them from ultraviolet rays . The photographs included scenes of natural beauty such as a Filipino Bajau village built on coral reefs , a formation of rocks in Madagascar , an inlet in the Ionian Islands that is home to endangered sea turtles , and architectural highlights such as the Palace of Versailles and the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul . It also showed scenes of tragedy such as the 1999 earthquake in Turkey and the destruction of the Amazonian rain forest . The exhibit used photovoltaic solar panels to store electrical energy during the day that then lit the exhibit at night . 
 Part of the 2006 film The Weather Man , starring Nicolas Cage , was shot at the rink . In 2008 , Millennium Park hosted a winter celebration called the Museum of Modern Ice . The installation included a 95 @-@ by @-@ 12 @-@ foot ( 29 @.@ 0 m × 3 @.@ 7 m ) ice wall in the park and a large abstract painting by Gordon Halloran , which was embedded in the McCormick Tribune Ice Rink . The works were titled Paintings Below Zero . In 2008 – 2009 the logo for the unsuccessful Chicago bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics was displayed in the rink 's ice . 
 The ice rink served as the " headquarters " for the 2011 edition of Hockey Weekend Across America ; the NHL on NBC broadcast its studio coverage from the rink on February 20 of that year . Eddie Olczyk opened the show by skating with the Stanley Cup in the Millennium Park rink . 
 = = Details = = 
 The ice skating rink at McCormick Tribune Plaza is 200 by 80 feet ( 61 by 24 m ) . Due to the rink 's rounded corners , the total skating surface is 15 @,@ 910 square feet ( 1 @,@ 478 m2 ) , which critic Blair Kamin called " amply sized " . For comparison , this is a considerably larger skating surface than the Rockefeller Center rink in New York City , which is 120 by 60 feet ( 37 by 18 m ) . 
 The Millennium Park rink has a lobby which provides skaters a respite from the natural environs , as well as toilets and public lockers . During the 2003 – 04 season the rink rented 77 @,@ 667 pairs of ice skates . By 2009 – 2010 , its ninth season , it was attracting more than 100 @,@ 000 skaters a year . While availability of the rink depends on the weather , it also has a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art chiller system that can maintain the ice in the event of unseasonably warm weather . Thus , temperature is not the only factor involved in decisions to close the rink . In his review of the plaza and rink , Kamin gave it two stars ( out of a possible four ) , called the structure " solid , though unremarkable " , and praised its uses throughout the year . 
 When the rink is closed , its surface becomes a 150 @-@ seat cafe that complements the 300 @-@ seat indoor Park Grill dining facility . Street level features such as McCormick Tribune Plaza are linked to elevated features such as Cloud Gate and AT & T Plaza , which are atop the Park Grill Restaurant and can be reached via balustraded stairs .

 Through 2006 and 2007 , the McCormick Tribune Ice Rink was one of several operated by the Chicago Park District .

 McCormick Tribune Ice Rink is generally open for skating afternoons and evenings seven days a week , with longer hours on weekends . However , it is occasionally closed for private events . Skating is free and skate rental is available . Except for its first year , the rink has been scheduled to be open from mid @-@ November until mid @-@ March , weather permitting . For the 2009 – 10 winter season , the rink is scheduled to be open from November 20 , 2009 to March 14 , 2010 , with abbreviated holiday schedules on Thanksgiving , Christmas Eve , Christmas Day and New Year 's Eve . Skating is accompanied by loudspeaker music , which is mostly seasonal music during the holidays . 
 Rink attendance is heavier on the weekends and other times when school is not in session . Romantic holidays such as Christmas Eve and Valentine 's Day are also quite crowded . The ice rink is a popular people watching location during the winter months ; many view events at the McCormick Tribune Plaza from AT & T Plaza , above and to the east . The ice skating rink has become so popular that when the weather was too warm for the rink 's opening in November 2005 , the story became international news . The book 1 @,@ 000 Places to See in the U.S.A. & Canada Before You Die suggests a visit to McCormick Tribune Plaza during the skating season , and describes Millennium Park as a renowned attraction . 
 There are days when themed skating is encouraged . Santa attire was encouraged on Saturday , December 13 , 2008 , and zombie attire was encouraged the next day , as part of an attempt to set a Guinness World Record for number of zombies on ice . The rink also serves as a host to the annual Chicago Winter Dance Festival ; during the festival there is a month of free skating instruction and demonstration at the rink , and there is free dance instructions behind the glass doors of the Jay Pritzker Pavilion stage .

 During much of the offseason alfresco dining is available in a 150 @-@ seat cafe set up on the ice rink , in what is then referred to as the Park Grill Plaza . This outdoor dining experience is associated with the Park Grill Restaurant and the Park Grill Cafe , which are both located under the Cloud Gate on AT & T Plaza . Architecture critic Blair Kamin compares the in @-@ park eating options availed at the Park Grill with New York 's former Tavern on the Green and Chicago 's Cafe Brauer . The Park Grill Plaza is the largest outdoor dining venue in Chicago , and hosts a variety of events , including a benefit called " Chefs on the Grill " in which guests interact with invited chefs who are competing to produce the best dish . Wine tastings are also hosted there , and during the summer , the Park Grill Plaza hosts musical performances on Thursdays . During the skating season , there are <unk> tables and the Park Grill Cafe offers take out and to @-@ go service . Outdoor dining service begins in May . 
 McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink is one of two features in the park to include accessible restrooms ; the other is Jay Pritzker Pavilion . The restrooms are located adjacent to the Park Grill . Although McCormick Plaza is a winter focal point , the park 's restroom facilities at this feature are not heated for winter use . 
 According to Fodor 's , the restaurant is known for a view that makes up for unimpressive service . However , Citysearch speaks positively about the service . Metromix , Fodor 's and Frommer 's all laud the location of the restaurant , which serves New American cuisine . Frommer 's gives the restaurant 2 out of 3 stars and notes that the restaurant has a kids menu to accommodate the numerous families that visit the park . Metromix notes that the restaurant is well known for its signature Park Grill Burger . The northern area of the Plaza has been named the North Lounge and has furniture for lounging ; it has a distinct menu including options from the Plaza 's menu , as well as its own offerings . The indoor restaurant has seating for 300 , a VIP room , and serves dinner , lunch , and weekend brunch .

 Paranoid Park is a 2007 American @-@ French drama film written and directed by Gus Van Sant . The film is based on the novel of the same name by Blake Nelson and takes place in Portland , Oregon . It stars Gabe Nevins as a teenage skateboarder who accidentally kills a security guard . 
 Van Sant wrote the draft script in two days after reading and deciding to adapt Nelson 's novel . To cast the film 's youths , Van Sant posted an open casting call on social networking website MySpace inviting teenagers to audition for speaking roles , as well as experienced skateboarders to act as extras . Filming began in October 2006 and took place at various locations in and around Portland . Scenes at the fictional Eastside Skatepark were filmed at Burnside Skatepark which was , like Eastside , built illegally by skateboarders . 
 Paranoid Park premiered on May 21 , at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival and was given a limited release on March 7 , 2008 . It grossed over US $ 4 @,@ 481 @,@ 000 from its $ 3 million budget . The film received mostly positive reviews ; some critics praised the direction and cinematography in particular , though others believed the film to be overly stylized and slow paced . It won one Independent Spirit Award , two Boston Society of Film Critics awards and the Cannes Film Festival 's special 60th anniversary prize .

 Alex ( Gabe Nevins ) , a 16 @-@ year @-@ old skateboarder , rides a freight train clandestinely with a man named Scratch ( Scott Patrick Green ) whom he has just met at the Eastside Skatepark , known as " Paranoid Park " . While the train is moving a security guard ( John Burrowes ) notices the pair , chases after them , and tries to get them off by hitting Scratch with his flashlight . During the melee , Alex hits him with his skateboard and the guard , losing balance , falls onto another track into the path of an oncoming freight train which cuts him in half . Alex tries to destroy some of the evidence . For example , he throws his skateboard into the Willamette River from the Steel Bridge , and when he arrives at his friend Jared 's ( Jake Miller ) house , he showers and disposes of the clothes he had been wearing . 
 Alex is later questioned at school by Detective Richard Lu ( Daniel Liu ) , as are several other students who had been skateboarding on the night in question . It is revealed that the police have recovered Alex 's skateboard , though they have not traced it back to him , and have identified DNA evidence which places the skateboard at the scene of the security guard 's death . 
 Throughout the film Alex keeps the incident to himself , and does not confide in anyone else . After having impassive sex with his girlfriend , Jennifer ( Taylor Momsen ) , he breaks up with her . Another of his friends , Macy ( Lauren McKinney ) , notices that he is worried about something . She advises him to write down whatever is bothering him as a cathartic release if nothing else . He initially rejects the idea , but eventually writes an account , which becomes the basis for the story . After completing the written account , Alex burns it .

 Gus Van Sant chose to adapt American author Blake Nelson 's novel Paranoid Park into a film of the same name because it was set in his hometown of Portland , Oregon , because he was an amateur skateboarder himself and because he found the story particularly interesting . At the time that he first read the novel , he was accumulating the finances for another film , but abandoned the project and decided instead to write a screenplay based on Nelson 's story . His first draft of the script was written in two days , and the final draft was just 33 pages long . 
 Similar to his 2003 film Elephant , Van Sant sought non @-@ professional young actors to play the main roles , and so created a page for the film on social networking site MySpace . On the page , he posted an open casting call for males and females aged 14 – 18 who were " skaters , honor roll [ students ] , cheerleaders , punks , drama kids , musicians , artists , student council [ members ] , athletes , award winners , class skippers , photographers , band members , leaders , followers , shy kids , class clowns " . Two audition sessions were held on August 3 and August 5 , 2006 , as well as an additional casting call for experienced skateboarders to act as extras in the film ; a total of 2 @,@ 971 people auditioned . Gabe Nevins , having never acted before , heard about the casting call from a skateboard store and originally auditioned as an extra . Nevins was cast in the lead role , which he says was based on his innocence that Van Sant believed trained actors to be lacking . Jake Miller , originally from Boise , Idaho , was on a road trip in Portland when he heard about the casting call and decided to audition with his friends . Taylor Momsen was a professional actor beforehand and received the Paranoid Park script through her agent . She won the role after sending her taped audition to Van Sant . The film features two cameo appearances : Alex 's father is played by professional skateboarder Jay " <unk> " Williamson , and his uncle is played by the film 's cinematographer Christopher Doyle . Most of the actors wore their own clothes and wrote some of their characters ' dialogue to maintain a sense of authenticity . 
 Principal photography began in Oregon in October 2006 . Filming locations included Portland State University , the Steel Bridge , St. Johns Bridge , Lloyd Center , Madison High School and Van Sant 's own beach house . Scenes at the fictional Eastside Skatepark were filmed at Portland 's Burnside Skatepark , which was , like Eastside , built illegally by skateboarders and subsequently approved by the city as a public skatepark . Van Sant said that his request to film at Burnside was treated with some suspicion by the park 's users , as " What none of them wanted was for us to portray a corny image of the park . " Cinematographer Christopher Doyle shot parts of the film with a wide @-@ angle lens that is used to shoot skate videos . The film 's skateboarding sequences were shot on Super 8 mm film , a medium commonly used in skate videos , and the remainder of the film was shot on 35 mm film , Van Sant 's medium of choice .

 Manohla Dargis of The New York Times described Paranoid Park as " a haunting , <unk> beautiful portrait of a teenage boy " and as " a modestly scaled triumph without a false or wasted moment " . She praised Van Sant 's direction , the cinematography and the overall realism of the film . The Los Angeles Times ' Carina Chocano summarized the film as " a gorgeously stark , mesmerizingly elliptical story " . She commended in particular the " dreamy camera work " and the " charged , simple direction " . J. Hoberman wrote for The Village Voice that " Few directors have revisited their earliest concerns with such vigor [ as Van Sant ] . " He concluded his review saying , " Paranoid Park is wonderfully lucid : It makes confusion something tangible and heartbreak the most natural thing in life . " Todd McCarthy of Variety magazine wrote that " Through immaculate use of picture , sound and time , the director adds another panel to his series of pictures about disaffected , disconnected youth . " He praised the " lovely " cinematography and the credibility of the female characters , though he felt that the soundtrack was sometimes distracting . Writing for New York magazine , David Edelstein opined that the film was " a supernaturally perfect fusion of Van Sant 's current conceptual @-@ art @-@ project head @-@ trip aesthetic and Blake Nelson 's finely tuned first @-@ person ' young adult ' novel " . He felt that Paranoid Park was different from Van Sant 's previous " experimental " films in that " it works " , though he criticized Nevins 's " clinically inexpressive " acting . Rolling Stone 's Peter Travers awarded the film 3 @.@ 5 out of 4 stars and commented that the combination of the soundtrack with the " visual miracles " of the cinematography , " a defiant slap at slick Hollywood formula , is mesmerizing " .

 Alternatively , William Arnold of the Seattle Post @-@ Intelligencer graded the film as a C + and described it as " a movie about its teen hero 's inability to express his feelings : to himself , to his parents , to his friends and , unfortunately , to the audience " . He criticized the " amateurish " cinematography , the " half @-@ hearted attempts at mystery " and the " wooden " cast . Salon.com 's Andrew O 'Hehir wrote that Paranoid Park 's " highly <unk> and stylized depictions of teenage life sometimes seem as if they were shot through the wrong end of a telescope " . He felt that the dialogue was " repetitious " and that teenage existence as portrayed in the film was less realistic than most Hollywood clichés . New York Press critic Armond White wrote that , in the film , " Van Sant reaches out to teen subculture , only to embalm its dissatisfaction in <unk> " and found it to be " full of art @-@ movie clichés " . David Edwards , writing for The Daily Mirror , called the film " Dreary with a capital D " and " slow , melancholic , but mostly just plain weird " .

 = In Cold Blood ( video game ) = 
 In Cold Blood is an adventure game developed by Revolution Software for the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows in 2000 in Europe and in 2001 in North America . The player assumes the role of John Cord — an MI6 agent who is captured while on assignment and tries to figure out who betrayed him through a series of flashbacks . 
 After the success of the first two Broken Sword games on the PlayStation , Sony contacted Revolution Software to develop a game to be released initially on the console . Revolution wanted to move away from the style of its previous projects , making a game with a secret agent theme and set in an action environment . Director Charles Cecil stated that the game was inspired by crime films such as Pulp Fiction and The Usual Suspects . The game engine was written specifically for the title . It was released to average reviews from critics , who praised the game 's story , puzzles and graphics , but criticized its controls , action scenes and animation . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 In Cold Blood is a 3D adventure game played from a third @-@ person perspective . Via a direct control interface , the player guides John Cord 's movements with a keyboard or gamepad . Cord must collect objects that can be used with other collectible objects , parts of the scenery , or other people in the game world to solve puzzles and progress in the game . Cord can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of what needs to be done to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot . Action scenes are also included . 
 = = Plot = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 In Cold Blood is situated in Volgia , a fictional state on the east coast of the former USSR . After the Soviet Union collapsed , Dmitri Nagarov , chief of intelligence and security , took the opportunity to overthrow existing powers and declared independence . After his coup , Volgia started to invade its neighbors . The <unk> Freedom Fighters ( VFF ) is a resistance movement that is run by Gregor Kostov . The VFF has learned that the <unk> have acquired some special technology and has informed the Americans . They sent a spy named Kiefer to investigate , but communications were lost while he was investigating a uranium mine . The British were asked for help , and Alpha , the boss of MI6 , sends agent John Cord , a long @-@ time friend of Kiefer , to investigate . 
 After the introduction which shows parts of Cord 's missions , the game starts with a scene in which Cord is interrogated by now premier Dmitri Nagarov , while he is being tortured by his assistant Lukyan . After the torture , Cord is fighting for his sanity , and all he knows for sure is that he was betrayed . He tries to piece together the fragments of his memory , and the player must reconstruct the events that led to his capture . 
 The game includes nine missions that Cord has to complete . Almost every mission ends with a transitional cut scene , showing how Cord is interrogated and tortured . These scenes include other characters like Alpha or Kostov , who will give information about the next missions . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 Cord goes to the uranium mine to locate Kiefer , but finds him dead . While there , he overhears a conversation between Chi @-@ Ling Cheung ( a secret agent of the People 's Republic of China ) and <unk> Tolstov ( a professor in applied physics and chemistry ) . Tolstov reveals that they are not mining for uranium , but that they are experimenting with a special compound called tri @-@ <unk> . Tolstov 's daughter Alexandria is being held hostage at Security Headquarters ( HQ ) , and Cord rescues her with the help of Chi , who is suspected of being a spy . Afterwards , Cord plants a bug on a secure server and removes a hard drive containing information relating to the VFF . Cord goes to the Containment Facility to apprehend Nagarov . 
 On the Kappa level , Cord destroys a gigantic robot called Spectre , and on the Omega level , he finds " specimens " held in pods in a laboratory . Cord raises the pod with <unk> <unk> <unk> , a former University Lecturer , who informs Cord about a place " where ships go to die . " Nagarov arrives with Alexandria in front of him . Nagarov claims that he has hacked the computers of the Americans and Chinese , to simulate that each of them is preparing for war , so he can go on with his plans for Volgia . Cord later enters a room where Professor Tolstov is working , who tells him that the place " where ships go to die " is <unk> , an abandoned naval base , where Nagarov will launch his missile . A mini @-@ robot kills Tolstov , but Cord uses his ID card to gain access to the refinery 's particle bombardment machine called Baby Blue , which he destroys with a bomb . Having met up with Kostov again , they leave to discover a truck with the dead bodies of Kostov 's men . Kostov suspects Chi is a traitor . 
 Cord and Chi infiltrate Nagarov 's base to destroy the Super Computer . On the roof of a large tower , Cord destroys a building with a surface @-@ to @-@ air missile launcher to create a diversion . When he meets with Chi again , she is being threatened by Kostov , who thinks she has betrayed his men . Chi kills Kostov before he can pull the trigger . With Chi 's help , Cord uses an elevator to go to the top of the tower and he activates a cable car leading to an island . Cord explores the docking area , and he finds Alexandria in a cell on the security level . Cord uses the main elevator in the complex to access the other levels . Cord creates a diversion and enters level 1 , where he inserts the explosive charge into the Super Computer . A cut scene is shown that reveals that Alpha has betrayed him . In a transmission , she tells that premier Nagarov had to be certain that Cord was not acting on her orders when he attacked the refinery . She assured Nagarov that Cord had not entered the facility , but Nagarov had a recording of Cord in the refinery . It resulted in a simple policy shift and the British are now working with the <unk> . As the reactor becomes critical , Nagarov and Lukyan leave the room . Until this moment , the game has taken place in Cord 's memory , as he was interrogated by Nagarov after being captured , but from this point on it takes place in real time . 
 When Cord wakes up , he finds Chi who was instructed to kill him , but she decides to free him after a conversation . Cord and Chi head for the quayside at level 1 and manage to lower a bridge leading to a helicopter . After they free Alexandria , they fly away as the base is destroyed . After they spot Nagarov 's nuclear submarine , they land on it . Cord and Chi explore the submarine to prevent the missile from being launched . They take care of the guards , and hear messages about problems with the reactor . After they split up , Lukyan knocks Chi down and takes her to a lower level . Lukyan later ambushes Cord , but he manages to kill him by pushing him into a turbine . In the bridge room , Nagarov enters armed with a gun , and after their conversation , Cord hits Nagarov with a ladder . Cord uses two keys he found to abort the missile launch . After releasing Chi , a message is heard that there is only one minute left to a critical reactor failure . They return to the deck and are picked up by Alexandria in the helicopter just before the submarine explodes . In the end sequence , Cord phones Alpha and tells her that he has dumped his information about her deal with Nagarov on the Chinese and American intelligence nets . The game ends showing Cord , Chi , and Alexandria approaching a beach where the sun sets .

 = Voodoo ( D 'Angelo album ) = 
 Voodoo is the second studio album by American recording artist D 'Angelo , released on January 25 , 2000 , by Virgin Records . Recording sessions for the album took place during 1998 to 1999 at Electric Lady Studios in New York City , featuring an extensive line @-@ up of musicians associated with the Soulquarians musical collective . Produced primarily by D 'Angelo , Voodoo features a loose , groove @-@ based funk sound and serves as a departure from the more conventional song structure of his debut album , Brown Sugar ( 1995 ) . The album features lyrical themes regarding spirituality , love , sexuality , growth , and fatherhood . 
 Amid heavy promotion and an anticipated release , the album was released to commercial and critical success . It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 , selling 320 @,@ 000 copies in its first week , and spent 33 weeks on the chart . It was promoted with five singles , including the hit single " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " , whose music video garnered D 'Angelo mainstream attention and controversy . Upon its release , Voodoo received general acclaim from music critics and earned D 'Angelo several accolades . It was named one of the year 's best albums by numerous publications . 
 D 'Angelo promoted Voodoo with an international supporting tour in late 2000 . While successful early on , the tour became plagued by concert cancellations and D 'Angelo 's personal frustrations . Voodoo has since been regarded by music writers as a creative milestone of the neo soul genre during its apex . It has sold over 1 @.@ 7 million copies in the United States and has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) .

 = = = Debut and writer 's block = = = 
 Following the success of his debut album Brown Sugar ( 1995 ) , D 'Angelo went into a four and a half year absence from the music scene and releasing solo work . His debut album presented a musical fusion of traditional soul and R & B influences with hip hop vocal and production elements , serving as fundamental elements for the neo soul sound . With its single @-@ oriented success , Brown Sugar earned considerable sales success and defied the contemporary , producer @-@ driven sound of the time , while earning popularity among mature R & B audiences and the growing hip hop generation . Prior to its release , neo soul itself was undefined by a major artist or musical work , and was developing during the early 1990s through the work of artists such as Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! , Me 'Shell NdegéOcello , and Omar . The album also earned D 'Angelo recognition for producing a commercial breakthrough for the genre and giving notice to other neo soul artists , including Erykah Badu , Lauryn Hill , and Maxwell . 
 After spending two years on tour promoting Brown Sugar , D 'Angelo found himself stuck with writer 's block . On the setback , D 'Angelo later stated " The thing about writer 's block is that you want to write so <unk> bad , [ but ] the songs don 't come out that way . They come from life . So you 've got to live to write . " During this time , he generally released cover versions and remakes , including a cover @-@ collaboration with Erykah Badu of the Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell duet song " Your Precious Love " for the soundtrack to High School High ( 1996 ) . D 'Angelo also covered Prince 's " She 's Always in My Hair " for the Scream 2 soundtrack ( 1997 ) , as well as the Ohio Players ' " Heaven Must Be Like This " for the Down in the Delta soundtrack ( 1998 ) . He also appeared on a duet , " Nothing Even Matters " , with Lauryn Hill for her debut solo album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill ( 1998 ) . He also spent the time lifting weights , smoking weed , and making music . 
 = = = Inspiration = = = 
 In 1998 , he was inspired to write music again after the birth of his first child , Michael , with fellow R & B singer and then @-@ girlfriend Angie Stone . He also traveled back to the South , spending time in South Carolina and in his hometown of Richmond , Virginia , while reconnecting himself with the African @-@ American musical history that had originally inspired him . Shortly after his son 's birth and the release of his first live album Live at the Jazz Cafe ( 1998 ) through EMI Records , he began preparation for the recording of songs for Voodoo . In several interviews after its release , he cited his son 's birth as an inspirational source and creative muse for him . A dedication to his son Michael and daughter Imani was included in the album 's liner notes , which were co @-@ written by D 'Angelo and writer / musician Saul Williams . In a press video accompanying the release of Voodoo , D 'Angelo suggested that he was attempting to create a new sound for him that was in transition . 
 In a February 1999 interview with music journalist Touré , D 'Angelo discussed the album and elaborated on the events that had preceded its release , explaining how he had no initial plan for a follow @-@ up . He also discussed his attempt to focus on his original inspiration to produce music , stating " The sound and feel of my music are going to be affected by what motivates me to do it " . On his visit to South Carolina , D 'Angelo stated that he " went through this <unk> , through gospel , blues , and a lot of old soul , old James Brown , early , early Sly and the Family Stone , and a lot of Jimi Hendrix " , and " I learned a lot about music , myself , and where I want to go musically " . In the same interview , he cited the deaths of rappers Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. as having a great effect on him during the period . In another interview with Touré , D 'Angelo said that he had lost his enthusiasm after Brown Sugar 's reception and " was gettin ' jaded , lookin ' at what go on in the business " . On his purpose for returning , D 'Angelo stated " I had to reiterate why I was doin ' that in the first place , and the reason was the love for the music " . 
 = = Conception = = 
 D 'Angelo was dissatisfied with the direction of R & B and soul music when conceiving the album . In an interview for Jet , he said that " the term R & B doesn 't mean what it used to mean . R & B is pop , that 's the new word for R & B. " He also found contemporary R & B to be " a joke " , adding that " the funny thing about it is that the people making this shit are dead serious about the stuff they 're making . It 's sad — they 've turned black music into a club thing . " In the liner notes for Voodoo , Saul Williams examined the album 's concept and echoes D 'Angelo 's dissatisfaction with the mainstream direction of contemporary R & B / soul and hip hop , noting a lack of artistic integrity in the two music genres . In an interview for Ebony , D 'Angelo said of his role and influences for Voodoo , " I consider myself very respectful of the masters who came before . In some ways , I feel a responsibility to continue and take the cue from what they were doing musically and vibe on it . That 's what I want to do . But I want to do it for this time and this generation " . In the album 's EPK , D 'Angelo said that Voodoo is " like a funk album . The natural progression of soul , the next step to soul is funk " . 
 Producer and drummer Ahmir " Questlove " Thompson issued an essay in 1999 that discussed the album 's creation and analyzed its songs . He described the project as a " vicarious fantasy " , a " new direction of soul for 2000 " , and " the litmus test that will reveal the most for your personality " . He addressed the inspiration behind Voodoo , saying " It was a love for the dead state of black music , a love to show our idols how much they taught us [ ... ] I hope you enjoy it . Just have an open mind to new shit . Just give us that . " Questlove discussed his expectations of a reaction from music listeners to the concept , saying in an interview for Entertainment Weekly upon the album 's release , " We knew this album would be a hard pill to swallow . People may want D to play into their R & B love @-@ god fantasies — wearing Armani suits , singing something sweet in your ear — but he made a conscious effort to shake people up , to take a chance . It 's not a middle @-@ ground record — you 're either going to love it or hate it . " 
 In an interview for USA Today , D 'Angelo said of the album 's title and its meaning , " the myriad influences found on it can be traced through the blues and back deeper in history through songs sung – in religious [ voodoo ] ceremonies . " In an interview for Jet magazine , he stated that his intentions for recording the album were to express the power of music and artistic respect for it . The theme is illustrated in Voodoo 's liner photography by Thierry <unk> , which depicts D 'Angelo participating in a voodoo ceremony . Voodoo 's press release discussed D 'Angelo 's concept , stating " Lyrically , D 'Angelo offers that much of Voodoo is personal reflection : touching on subjects like spirituality , sexuality , growth , and in particular , becoming a father . Musically , as he puts it , Voodoo is ' definitely groove @-@ based ' " . D 'Angelo also said that " My inspiration was just to go farther . To get to that next level . To push it even further . To work against the floss and the grain and to get even deeper into the sound that I 'm hearing ... and the thing is , I 'm just looking at Voodoo as just the beginning . I 'm still developing and growing and still listening to that sound I hear inside my head ... So this is the first step " .

 = = = Electric Lady sessions = = = 
 Beginning in 1996 , Voodoo evolved from nearly four years of sessions and featured an extensive roster of R & B , hip hop , and jazz musicians and recording technicians . Drummer and producer Ahmir " Questlove " Thompson of The Roots was D 'Angelo 's " co @-@ pilot " during the session . He and his crew studied bootleg videotapes of classic R & B artists such as Marvin Gaye , James Brown , and Jimi Hendrix , along with reruns of Soul Train , at Electric Lady Studios , the Manhattan @-@ based recording studio built by Jimi Hendrix . After watching a tape , they played a certain artist 's album or catalog , jam , and recorded for inspiration . Touré of Rolling Stone observed , " One night they played Prince 's Parade until they flowed into a new groove that became ' Africa ' " . On several occasions , D 'Angelo listened to Sly & the Family Stone 's There 's a Riot Goin ' On ( 1971 ) , which had an influential production . The crew recorded numerous hours of unreleased , original material , as well as covers of their influencers ' material . Collectively referred to by D 'Angelo as " <unk> " , these influencers included soul artist Al Green , funk artist George Clinton , and Afrobeat artist Fela Kuti . 
 During the initial recording sessions , D 'Angelo also worked with personal trainer Mark Jenkins , who was hired to help him get into shape . As Questlove recounted , " Money was definitely overweight by ' 96 , so they got him a drill sergeant physical trainer Mark Jenkins . This guy didn 't take no shit . I cannot see D running in Central Park , but he did [ ... ] Push @-@ ups , weight room , sparring every day for three hours . He wouldn 't take no shit . " 
 Following the birth of his son , D 'Angelo composed the album 's first song " Send It On " in 1998 at a recording studio in Virginia . Shortly afterwards , he felt ready to begin the recording for Voodoo . D 'Angelo wrote most of Voodoo 's material at Electric Lady Studios , as opposed to his method of composing outside the studio as he did for Brown Sugar . Recording sessions for what ended up on the album began in 1998 and continued through to 1999 . On the sessions ' environment , Touré wrote " What started as the follow @-@ up to D 'Angelo 's 1995 platinum debut , Brown Sugar , became five years of study at Soul University , complete with classes , pranks , gossip and equal amounts of discipline and laziness . " D 'Angelo and Questlove have compared the environment to school . Music writer Trevor Schoonmaker examined D 'Angelo 's and Questlove 's initial recording approach , stating " In the endless sessions for the record , the two spent hours trying to conjure the elusive ' vibe ' necessary to provoke the album 's creation , which included listening to hours of black music that escaped strict classification . Some of that found itself played out in ghostly ways on Voodoo . " 
 = = = Soulquarians and guests = = = 
 Production for the album was conducted in a generally informal manner and took place at Electric Lady Studios simultaneously with recording for Erykah Badu 's Mama 's Gun ( 2000 ) and Common 's Like Water for Chocolate ( 2000 ) . This led to impromptu collaborations and a distinctive sound that is featured on the three albums . Frequent visits to the studio were made by fellow neo soul and hip hop recording artists associated with the Soulquarians collective such as Erykah Badu , Q @-@ Tip , Talib Kweli , James Poyser , and Mos Def . Voodoo 's sessions also had visitors not associated with the project , including record producer Rick Rubin , comedian Chris Rock , and rock musician Eric Clapton . D 'Angelo previewed songs for them , which they found impressive . 
 D 'Angelo produced songs on Common 's Like Water for Chocolate . Q @-@ Tip was originally intended to contribute a verse to the song " Left & Right " , but was replaced by rappers Method Man & Redman during recording due to creative differences . Questlove has stated that " general opinion was that the song was cool but nobody was feeling Tip 's verse " . According to former A & R @-@ man Gary Harris , D 'Angelo 's manager Dominique Trenier " thought that Tip ’ s verse was wack " . Members of The Roots , including Black Thought , Kamal Gray , and <unk> , also visited the recording sessions in 1997 to 1999 ; the band was recording their album Things Fall Apart ( 1999 ) at Electric Lady Studios . That album featured contributions by D 'Angelo , Badu , Mos Def , and Common . 
 Questlove was the " musical powerhouse " behind several of the Soulquarians ' projects during the late 1990s and early 2000s , including Voodoo and Things Fall Apart . In a 2002 interview , he told critic Jim DeRogatis about his role in recording Voodoo and being a part of the Soulquarians , stating " I tried to do all in my power that I could to bring people together – to bring Common to Electric Lady , have him record here whenever so that he could record with some of these other artists . You 'd just come into [ the studio 's ] A Room , you don 't even know who has a session , but you call me : ' Who 's down there ? ' ' Common 's in there today ' . So you come down , you order some food , sit down and bulls — , watch a movie , and then it 's , ' Let 's play something ' . And I say , ' Who wants this [ track ] ? ' And it would be , ' I want it ! ' ' No , I want it ! ' " . Questlove has referred to the recording experience at the studio as a " left @-@ of @-@ center black music renaissance " . 
 = = = <unk> tracks = = = 
 According to Questlove , a duet track by D 'Angelo and Lauryn Hill , " Feel Like Makin ' Love " , was planned . Although tapes were sent via FedEx between the two , the collaboration was aborted and the song was instead recorded by D 'Angelo . Questlove later said that the duet failed to materialize due to " too many middle men [ ... ] I don 't think Lauryn and D ever talked face @-@ to @-@ face . " Mistakenly , some critics who reviewed the final track assumed that Hill 's vocals are present in the recording . 
 During the final days of recording Voodoo , Questlove spent time recording a version of Fela Kuti 's " Water No Get Enemy " , a melodic protest song from Kuti 's 1975 album Expensive Shit . He and D 'Angelo had intended to revamp the composition into a minimalist soul ballad for Lauryn Hill to contribute vocals for . However , Hill declined and the track ended up as a place @-@ holder for the rough mix of the album . A reconceptualized version of the song was recorded by D 'Angelo and guest artists on the charity album Red Hot + Riot ( 2002 ) . 
 = = Production = = 
 = = = Engineering = = = 
 Audio engineer Russell Elevado , who recorded and mixed Voodoo , along with Erykah Badu 's Mama 's Gun and Common 's Like Water for Chocolate , used old school recording techniques and vintage mixing gear for the albums in order to achieve the distinct sounds found in classic recorded works . While mainstream recording techniques at the time often involved the use of hi @-@ tech digital equipment , Elevado employed the use of analog equipment , enhancement plug @-@ ins , and a blend of live instrumentation . Notable from the production was that most of it , with the exception of " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " , was recorded live with no overdubbing of its instrumentation , in contrast to contemporary R & B production at the time . 
 For Voodoo 's sessions , D 'Angelo appropriated most of the instruments on the album 's songs , contributing with drums , electric guitar , keyboards , and percussion . During its recording , he employed amplifiers , microphones , a Fender Rhodes keyboards and organ originally used by musician Stevie Wonder for Talking Book ( 1972 ) , and a recording board originally used by Jimi Hendrix . On Voodoo 's recording atmosphere , D 'Angelo stated " I believe Jimi was there . Jimi , Marvin Gaye , all the folks we were gravitating to . I believe they blessed the project " . 
 D 'Angelo composed all of the bass lines for Voodoo and sequenced them for Welsh bassist Pino Palladino , who he had met after being asked to do a duet with B.B. King at the time of Voodoo 's earlier sessions . Palladino was asked by D 'Angelo to learn and improvise the bass arrangements on his 1961 model P bass . For " The Root " , " <unk> ' " , and " Spanish Joint " , guitarist Charlie Hunter simultaneously played guitar and bass sections with a custom eight @-@ string guitar / bass combo , which had three lower bass and five upper guitar strings . It also had separate pickups for each set of strings , as well separate outputs for each pickup . In order to adjust production @-@ wise to Hunter 's intricate playing , Elevado had separate outputs from Hunter 's guitar connected to a separate bass and guitar amplifier . He has said that there was enough separation to manage an adequate sound on both amplifiers , in spite of slight " bleeding into each other " from the pickups in close proximity to each other . 
 = = = Grooves and beats = = = 
 D 'Angelo and his supporting personnel constructed several of the songs ' grooves for the album to sit far behind time , directly on top of time , or pressing on the time , making them cluttered and loose in style . Questlove helped design the sparse funk , soul and hip hop beats on the generally groove @-@ based record . In later interviews , Questlove discussed that he and D 'Angelo incorporated much of the distinctive percussive rhythms of Detroit hip hop producer , Slum Village @-@ member and The Ummah @-@ affiliate J Dilla , also known as Jay Dee . A part of the musical collective Soulquarians , Dilla served as a frequent collaborator of theirs . Although album tracks such as " Left & Right " and " Devil 's Pie " help to bring this claim to light , J Dilla himself was not officially credited for production . However , he contributed significantly to Voodoo 's overall sound , specifically the rhythm and percussion . 
 One of the characteristics of the drumming style implemented in recording the album is its adherence to human timing , as the tracks were mostly programmed mechanically during recording , therefore resulting in the album 's intentional sloppiness . In a later interview , Questlove discussed the intention and purpose of including imperfection in the album 's sound , stating " we wanted to play as perfectly as we could , but then deliberately insert the little glitch that makes it sound messed up . The idea was to sound disciplined , but with a total human feel . " 
 Questlove also acknowledged J Dilla 's influence over the recording sessions for Voodoo . He said of Dilla 's unique programming method during the sessions , " He makes programmed stuff so real , you really can ’ t tell it ’ s programmed . He might program 128 bars , with absolutely no looping or quantizing ... When Q @-@ Tip from A Tribe Called Quest first played me some of his stuff , I said , ' The drums are messed up ! The time is wrong ! ' And when we did a song for D 'Angelo 's record that Lenny Kravitz was supposed to play on , Lenny said , ' I can ’ t play with this — there ’ s a discrepancy in the drum pattern . ' And we ’ re like , ' It 's supposed to be this way ! '

 Voodoo incorporates musical elements of jazz , funk , hip hop , blues , and soul , as well as ambient music with a musical layer shaped by guitar @-@ based funk . It features vintage influences and a looser , more improvisational structure , which contrasts the more conventional song structure of Brown Sugar . Music writer Greg Kot has considered the album a production of the Soulquarians , calling it " the most radical of the many fine records " conceived by the collective 's members . In an interview with the New Orleans Times @-@ Picayune 's Shawn Rhea , D 'Angelo attributed the album 's experimental and jam @-@ like atmosphere to the fact that most of Voodoo was recorded " live and its first take " . On its eclectic and conceptual style , Rhea commented " [ D 'Angelo ] seems to have channeled the brilliance of his musical forefathers , living and dead , during the crafting of this album . It is a complex , intricate collection of songs that , like voodoo , is simultaneously secular and spiritual , sensual and sacred , earthbound and ethereal " . Recording engineer Russell Elevado 's analog mixing and old school production techniques contributed to the album 's jazz element and vintage sound . On its jazz influence , D 'Angelo stated " because a lot of the album was cut live and has free playing on it , it was hard not to go in a jazz direction " . 
 While most musical compositions rely on tension and release , which can be produced by factors such as soft verses and loud choruses , gradual buildup , subtle tension within verses or over the course of the bridge , or harmonic tension in chords that provides space for improvisation , D 'Angelo 's arrangements for Voodoo subdivide the tension into each of the songs ' moments . According to music critic Steve McPherson , the concept results in " no linear way to measure how far off things slide before they pull themselves back ... can 't be measured in beats or fractions of beats in a meaningful way . For lack of a less cliched word , it 's entirely ' feel ' " . This type of syncopation serves as the center for Voodoo , rather than the more conventional method of using it as flavoring or departure from the center . According to New York Daily News music journalist Jim Farber , " In order to counter the slickness of modern R & B , D 'Angelo 's album reconfigured – and updated – the adventurous song structures and <unk> grooves of early- ' 70s works like Curtis Mayfield 's ' Move On Up ' , Isaac Hayes ' ' Hot <unk> Soul ' and Marvin Gaye 's ' Let 's Get It On ' . " 
 The album features aggressive multi @-@ tracking of D 'Angelo 's voice , a technique similar to the production of Sly & the Family Stone 's There 's a Riot Goin ' On ( 1971 ) and Marvin Gaye 's Let 's Get It On ( 1973 ) . The multi @-@ tracking on Voodoo significantly affected the clarity of D 'Angelo 's vocals . In Voodoo 's liner notes , Saul Williams wrote of its heavy use of multi @-@ tracking , stating " You might respond , ' Lyrics ? Yo , I can 't even understand half the shit that D 'Angelo be saying . That nigga sounds like Bobby McFerrin on opium ' . And I 'd say , ' You 're right . Neither can I. But I am drawn to figure out what it is that he 's saying . His vocal collaging intrigues me ' " . Music writers have also noted the production style and sound of Voodoo as reminiscent of the sound of the P @-@ Funk opus Mothership Connection ( 1975 ) , Gaye 's downtempo disco @-@ soul record I Want You ( 1976 ) , and Miles Davis 's jazz fusion works In a Silent Way ( 1969 ) and Bitches Brew ( 1970 ) . 
 D 'Angelo and his crew also utilized a hip hop production style , which often subordinates song structure to a stable foundation for a rapper 's delivery and flow . This was familiar to D 'Angelo , as his first original recordings were rap demos . Subsequently , most of the songs were performed without a definitive structure , settling into a mid @-@ tempo groove with minimal verse @-@ chorus @-@ bridge progression . This also resulted in an emphasis on texture over both structure and hooks . New York writer Ethan Smith noted this occurrence , stating " most of the songs aren 't really songs at all -- at least , not in the traditional sense " . While not predominant on the album , some tracks incorporate sampling . Most of its production was influenced by hip hop producer J Dilla 's input . On J Dilla 's influence , Questlove stated " He 's the zenith of hip @-@ hop to us . Jay Dee helped to bring out the album 's dirty sound and encouraged the false starts and the <unk> sound of the record " .

 The opening track " Playa Playa " features basketball metaphors and gospel overtones , which accompany the track 's slow funk and jazz vibe . On his bass playing in the song , Pino Palladino recalled " I was thinking about Stevie Wonder in the choruses and P @-@ Funk in the verses " . Rob Evanoff of All About Jazz called the song " an uplifting soul ride " , and stated that it evokes an image of " a musical train seen far off in the distance , slowly getting bigger as it gets closer " . Evanoff also compared the track 's style to the jam @-@ sound of Pink Floyd , and wrote " it surrounds you with a deep thick infectious groove that , at first , shadows and then envelopes your senses in such a way that is equal bits liberating , intoxicating and hypnotic … you close your eyes and are transported into another dimension " . On the song 's lyrics , one critic wrote that " D 'Angelo disses all neo @-@ soul wannabes by calmly singing ' Bring the drama playa / Give me all U got ' " . " Devil 's Pie " is a funk and hip hop diatribe with a lyrical theme concerning hip hop excess , and it is accompanied by P @-@ Funk style harmonies and low @-@ key singing by D 'Angelo . It is a bass @-@ driven track produced by DJ Premier , who contributes to its hip hop texture . The song 's theme also incorporates religious imagery into its message of social strife . Questlove has stated that " Devil 's Pie " was written to address the issues of " the money hungry <unk> state of the world we 're in " . 
 " Left & Right " is a funky party jam featuring rappers Method Man and Redman , who exchange verses as D 'Angelo sings the song 's verses and chorus . Entertainment Weekly 's Matt Diehl calls Method Man 's and Redman 's lyrics " misogynistic " , adding that it upsets Voodoo 's " organically sensual vibe " . The introspective track " The Line " has a downtempo , spiritual sound with lyrics about dealing with some unnamed adversity . According to one critic , it " could be about his MIA status ( ' Will I hang or get left hangin ? / Will I fall off or is it bangin ? / I say it 's up to God ' ) , or about anyone facing doubters with a revolver loaded with talent and self @-@ confidence ( ' I 'm gonna put my finger on the trigger / I 'm gonna pull it , and then we gon ' see / What the deal / I 'm for real ' ) " . Music critic Robert Christgau interpreted the lyrics to be " <unk> , unsentimental ... in which a young black man lays out the reasons he 's ready to die @-@ leaving the listener to wonder why the fuck he should have to think about it " . Andy Peterson of The GW Hatchet viewed that the adversity is " the price of fame " or " lamenting a lost lover " . 
 The sparse funk song " Chicken Grease " has lyrics advising against acting " uptight " , and it features D 'Angelo referencing the line " I know you got soul " from Eric B. & Rakim 's song of the same name ( 1987 ) . It contains an ambiguous harmony and bass by Pino Palladino , who evokes the playing style of James Jamerson , with spontaneously improvised variations @-@ on @-@ a @-@ theme parts that sit back " in the pocket " . The track was originally intended for Common 's Like Water for Chocolate , but D 'Angelo offered Common the song " Geto Heaven Part Two " as a trade . " Chicken Grease " is named after a technical term that musician Prince used for his guitarist to play a 9th minor chord while playing 16th notes . The song contains background voices , which one writer described as " omnipresent party people channeled in from ' What 's Going On ' and ' Voodoo Chile ' , <unk> and <unk> on all over " . Co @-@ written by D 'Angelo 's former girlfriend , singer Angie Stone , " Send It On " contains lyrics concerning themes of honesty and faith in love , and features jazz trumpeter Roy Hargrove on <unk> horn . Titled after a southern colloquial conflation of the terms " One More Time " and " Again " , the mid @-@ tempo ballad " One Mo <unk> " has its narrator reminiscing about a former lover . Its introductory sound consisting of soft organ work and dim percussion evokes the sound of D 'Angelo 's " Sh ★ t , Damn , <unk> ★ cker " ( 1995 ) . " One Mo <unk> " contains strong jazz overtones and a prominent rocksteady drum rhythm played by Questlove . It incorporates Delta blues @-@ style bass and keyboard @-@ driven verses with a melodic hook . The song is introduced with lead @-@ in bass licks by Pino Palladino , who adds musical texture to its sparse composition by using 10th notes and other arpeggio shapes . According to Seattle Weekly 's Tricia Romano , the song 's music <unk> " new skool sensibility with old school soul " .

 According to Questlove , " The Root " , " Spanish Joint " , and " <unk> ' " serve as the " virtuoso part of the record " , featuring intricate technical arrangements , no overdubbing , and Charlie Hunter playing both electric and bass guitar . " The Root " is a mid @-@ tempo heartbreak song with the bass line and guitar solo played simultaneously by Hunter on an eight @-@ string guitar . It is about a vengeful woman 's effect on the narrator : " In the name of love and hope she took my shield and sword ... From the pit of the bottom that knows no floor / Like the rain to the dirt , from the vine to the wine / From the alpha of creation , to the end of all time " . Miles Marshall Lewis writes of the song 's subject matter , " [ it ] can actually be digested and emotionally felt , sadly rare for Hot 97 R & B. " Co @-@ written by Roy Hargrove , " Spanish Joint " is a salsa @-@ infused , high tempo track about karma . It incorporates rhythmic Brazilian guitar licks by Hunter , funky horn arrangements by Hargrove , and Latin grooves and fusion instrumentation similar to Stevie Wonder 's " Don 't You Worry ' bout a Thing " ( 1973 ) . " Feel Like Makin ' Love " is a cover of Roberta Flack 's 1974 hit of the same name with a low @-@ key , quiet storm sound . " <unk> ' " features double rimshots placed behind the beat by Questlove . 
 Co @-@ written by Raphael Saadiq , " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " is a tribute to one of D 'Angelo 's primary influences , Prince , and evokes his early Controversy period . The similarity of D 'Angelo 's music on Voodoo to Prince was addressed in Saul Williams 's liner notes , as he stated " I 'd pay to see Prince 's face as he listens to this album . " Questlove described the song as " finding the line between parody and honesty [ ... ] In an era of ' the cover song ' , redoing a Prince song was taboo . This is the second best thing " . It follows a six eight signature and features electric guitar interplay throughout , which is reminiscent of the Jimi Hendrix guitar style and " Maggot Brain " sound . The song contains a drum pattern with a uniform dynamic . D 'Angelo 's vocals were overdubbed several times to produce the sound of a choir singing harmonies during choruses , all of which were sung by D 'Angelo . The song 's sexually explicit lyrics describe the narrator 's plea to his lover for sex , as exemplified in the second verse : " Love to make you wet / In between your thighs , cause / I love when it comes inside of you / I get so excited when I 'm around you , baby " It has been cited by critics as the album 's best song . 
 The philosophical album closer " Africa " celebrates D 'Angelo 's heritage , while reaffirming his contemporary mission in life . It has been cited by Questlove as his favorite song on the album . The theme of " Africa " concerns the finding of a spiritual home amid geographical displacement , and of passing that sense of belonging on to one 's children . " Africa " was originally written in honor of D 'Angelo 's son , Michael Archer , Jr . , and ended up as a dedication to history , Africa , and God . Opening with a shimmery rustle of chimes , the song contains a drum interpretation of Prince 's " I Wonder U " from his Parade ( 1986 ) , which was also utilized for the Ursula Rucker and The Roots track " The Return to Innocence Lost " from Things Fall Apart . Questlove discussed producing the opening chime sounds for " Africa " , stating " we took the cover off the rhodes and mic 'd ' em " . One critic described C. Edward Alford 's guitar work for " Africa " as " backward guitar solos ( at least they sound backward ) " . Another critic described the song as a " lullaby " and " a gorgeous , opalescent closer ... a prayer of sorts " . Voodoo 's coda , which consists of chopped @-@ up track snippets run backwards , plays at the song 's conclusion . 
 = = Release and promotion = = 
 The album 's release was preceded by several delays , which were primarily caused by the folding of D 'Angelo 's former label EMI Records and legal troubles with his management . Originally scheduled for release on November 23 , 1999 , Voodoo was released the following year on January 25 by the Virgin @-@ imprint label <unk> Sound in the United States , January 18 in Canada and February 14 in the United Kingdom on EMI , awaiting eager anticipation from fans and critics . Voodoo was issued with a parental advisory label , due to profanities and sexually explicit lyrics present on the tracks " Devil 's Pie " and " Left & Right " , and also as a " clean " edited version with an alternate cover . A double LP release was made available in the UK through EMI . When Voodoo was originally presented to Virgin Records executives prior to its release , mixed opinions formulated on whether or not it would be favored commercially , as the project had been heavily financed by the label . In return for the production budget , Virgin executives expected a record with potential for radio @-@ oriented success . However , Voodoo 's unconventional sound proved difficult to translate into singles suited for contemporary radio success , in contrast to the more accessible Brown Sugar . 
 By the album 's release date , three singles had been released , " Devil 's Pie " , " Left & Right " , and " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " , with only the latter making a significant commercial impact . The limited success with singles and lukewarm opinions from label executives led to more promotional efforts and a public response made by D 'Angelo 's management through issuing a statement , which cited Voodoo as the R & B musical equivalent of art rock band Radiohead 's acclaimed studio album OK Computer ( 1997 ) . While both records feature an experimental edge , in terms of sound and lyrical themes , the English indie rock scene to which the latter had belonged was album @-@ oriented , as opposed to the contemporary R & B scene in the United States , which was more single @-@ oriented at the time . Prior to its release , Virgin launched an extensive , multi @-@ layered campaign for the album , which setup several promotional performances by D 'Angelo in 1999 , including a guest performance on the season premiere of The Chris Rock Show on September 17 , New York 's Key Club , the National Black Programmers Coalition meeting in New Orleans on November 20 , <unk> San Francisco 's House of Soul show on December 10 , and <unk> L.A. ' s Holiday <unk> on December 11 . Following commitments made by the label for the album 's distribution in the UK , continental Europe , Australia , and New Zealand , D 'Angelo appeared at London 's Music of Black Origin Awards on October 6 . Other promotional events included signings and in @-@ store appearances by D 'Angelo at shopping venues such as Macy 's , Virgin Megastore , and Fulton Mall in New York City , which attracted a considerable number of D 'Angelo 's female fans . A remix album , Voodoo DJ Soul Essentials ( 2000 ) , was also issued by Virgin . 
 A press release for Voodoo was issued in January , discussing the album 's experimental edge and the anticipation for its release . It called Voodoo " the CD that D 'Angelo was put on this earth to create " and " quite literally the record that much of the universal soul nation has been <unk> for . " A video for " Send It On " included footage from Voodoo 's supporting tour . A music video for " Left & Right " , created by director Malik Hassan Sayeed and producer Rich Ford , Jr . , was anticipated by fans and MTV network executives that had planned special promotions and a world premiere for the clip . However , Sayeed 's concept of a concert video that paid tribute to funk shows of the past expended Virgin 's budget and resulted in a missed deadline for the MTV premiere . As punishment , the network refused to put the final edit of music video in rotation . It was eventually world @-@ premiered by BET on Thanksgiving Day . 
 The release of the controversial " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " music video prior to the album 's release has often been cited as having the greatest promotional impact . Directed by Paul Hunter , the video features D 'Angelo , filmed from the waist @-@ up , lip @-@ synching in the nude . According to writer Keith M. Harris , it portrayed D 'Angelo 's " discursive play with masculinity and blackness " . The video gained a significant amount of airplay on the BET and MTV networks , and increased mainstream notice of D 'Angelo upon Voodoo 's release , while exposing him as a sex icon to a newer generation of fans . It also proved to contribute significantly to the album 's commercial success . The music video for " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " was also viewed at a promotional party thrown in celebration of the album 's release , which took place in January 2000 at the Centro @-@ Fly nightclub in Chelsea , Manhattan . Douglas Century of The New York Times wrote of the club 's appearance as " packed and sweaty , with decor and soul music out of a 1970 's time warp : multiple video screens playing images of Curtis Mayfield and vintage Soul Train episodes , replete with dancers in Day @-@ Glo bell @-@ bottoms " .

 The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart , selling 320 @,@ 000 copies in its first week . It entered the Billboard 200 on February 12 , 2000 and remained on the chart for 33 consecutive weeks . Its debut replaced Carlos Santana 's Supernatural ( 1999 ) at the number @-@ one spot on the chart . It had sold over 500 @,@ 000 copies within its first two months of release . The album charted for 33 weeks on the Billboard 200 . Voodoo charted on several international album charts , including the United Kingdom , Switzerland , France , the Netherlands , Sweden , Norway , and New Zealand . On February 24 , 2000 , it was certified gold in sales by the Canadian Recording Industry Association , following sales in excess of 50 @,@ 000 copies in Canada . Two months after its US release , Voodoo was certified platinum on March 1 , 2000 by the Recording Industry Association of America . The album 's platinum certification had coincided with the commencement of Voodoo 's supporting tour . By mid @-@ 2000 , the album had reached sales of 1 @.@ 3 million copies in the United States . As of 2005 , the album has sold over 1 @.@ 7 million copies in the US , according to Nielsen SoundScan . 
 Despite its success , Voodoo did not achieve his debut album 's sales performance nor generate the single @-@ oriented success D 'Angelo 's label had envisioned . Its first two singles , " Devil 's Pie " and " Left & Right " , peaked at number 69 and number 70 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart . The latter was commercially aimed at R & B and hip hop @-@ oriented radio stations due to the prominence of rappers Redman and Method Man on the track . According to Rich Ford , Jr . , producer of the " Left & Right " music video , both the single and the video went commercially unnoticed due to MTV 's refusal to place the song 's video in rotation , serving as punishment for missing the deadline for its initial premiere . The fifth single " Feel Like Makin ' Love " was less successful , reaching number 109 on the Hot R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Singles & Tracks . " Send It On " , the album 's fourth single , achieved moderate chart success , peaking at number 33 on Billboard 's Pop Singles chart . 
 The album 's third single , " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " , became its greatest chart success , peaking at number 25 on the Hot 100 Singles and at number two on the R & B Singles chart . The infamous music video for " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " helped in boosting the song 's appeal , as well as D 'Angelo 's . Billboard wrote of the video , " it 's pure sexuality . D 'Angelo , muscularly cut and glistening , is shot from the hips up , naked , with just enough shown to prompt a slow burning desire in most any woman who sees it . The video alone could make the song one of the biggest of the coming year " . It earned three nominations for the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards , including Video of the Year , Best R & B Video , and Best Male Video . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Voodoo received rave reviews from contemporary music critics. who dubbed it a " masterpiece " and D 'Angelo 's greatest work . In The Village Voice , Christgau called it a " deeply brave and pretentious record ... signifies like a cross between lesser Tricky and Sly 's Riot Goin ' On " , and wrote of D 'Angelo , " he leads from strength " rather than " tune @-@ and @-@ hook " , " a feel for bass more disquieting than <unk> . " NME praised its diverse sound and commented that the album " represents nothing less than African American music at a crossroads ... To simply call D 'Angelo 's work neo @-@ classic soul , as per corporate <unk> , would be reductive , for that would be to ignore the elements of vaudeville jazz , Memphis horns , ragtime blues , funk and bass grooves , not to mention hip @-@ hop , that slip out of every pore of these 13 haunted songs . " Christopher John Farley of Time called it a " richly imagined CD " . Mark Anthony Neal of PopMatters called it " the working blueprint for ' post @-@ Soul ' black pop " . Joshua Klein of The A.V. Club commented that the album " often recalls the muddier bits of Sly Stone 's later works [ ... ] and the much @-@ missed balladry of prime Prince " and stated , " D 'Angelo 's mellow strategy frequently pays off [ ... ] a brave antidote to current pop and hip @-@ hop trends . " 
 Despite perceiving a " heavy @-@ handed emphasis on groove over melody " and " self @-@ indulgent " song durations , Miles Marshall Lewis of The Village Voice viewed the album as a progression for D 'Angelo and compared it to Prince 's acclaimed Sign o ' the Times ( 1987 ) , noting that the latter album was initially perceived by most critics as " uneven " . Greg Tate of Vibe dubbed it " the most daring song @-@ oriented album by a mainstream R & B artist of his generation . " Steve Jones of USA Today wrote that " no other R & B artist today seems to have as acute an understanding of where he comes from as D 'Angelo , and none seems as willing to take risks in exploring where he should be heading " . The Austin Chronicle 's Christopher Gray commented that " Voodoo unlocks the brain 's inner freak like an especially nimble Harry Whodini " . Rob Evanoff of All About Jazz gave it five out of five stars and called it " a record you put on and let it seep in , soaking your essence and one that evolves over subsequent listens ... an aural aphrodisiac " . He found it to be in the tradition of classic jazz albums and wrote of its musical significance , stating : 
 However , some critics found it inconsistent . Music journalist Peter Shapiro criticized its " loose playing and bohemian self @-@ indulgence " , stating " Voodoo drifted all over the map in a blunted haze " . Rolling Stone 's James Hunter disapproved of the experimental and loose @-@ sounding structure , and viewed that it does not attain its potential , stating " long stretches of it are unfocused and <unk> [ ... ] Voodoo flatters the real at the expense of the thing . The result is superb smoke , but smoke nonetheless " . Jon Caramanica wrote in The Rolling Stone Album Guide ( 2004 ) , " D 'Angelo achieves through nuance what some singers with decades of experience and training never achieve : a throbbing , vital presence , that demands attention , even as it shuns it " .

 In 2001 , Voodoo won a Grammy Award for Best R & B Album at the 43rd Grammy Awards , which was awarded to D 'Angelo and recording engineer Russell Elevado . The song " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " won for Best Male R & B Vocal Performance and was also nominated for Best R & B Song . The song was also ranked number 12 on The Village Voice 's Pazz & Jop critics ' poll of 2000 , as well as number 4 on Rolling Stone magazine 's " End of Year Critics & Readers Poll " of the top singles of the year . Voodoo proved to be one of the most critically praised and awarded albums of the year , topping several critics ' and publications ' " end of year " lists , including the number 6 spot on The Village Voice 's 2000 Pazz & Jop critics ' poll . Rolling Stone and Spin magazine both ranked it number 4 on their " albums of the year " lists , while Time magazine named Voodoo as the number 1 album of 2000 . Voodoo was named one of the top ten albums of 2000 by several New York Times staff writers , including Ben Ratliff ( number 2 ) , Neil Strauss ( number 3 ) , Ann Powers ( number 2 ) , and Jon Pareles ( number 1 ) . 
 In 2003 , Rolling Stone ranked the album number 488 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time ; it was ranked number 481 in a revised list in 2012 . In 2009 , Pitchfork Media ranked Voodoo number 44 on its list of the Top 200 Albums of the 2000s decade , calling it " a triumph of hands @-@ on , real @-@ time , old @-@ school soul minimalism " and citing D 'Angelo 's vocals as " maybe the most erotically tactile singing put to disc this decade " . Rolling Stone placed the album at number 23 on its list of the 100 Best Albums of the Decade , stating " The decade 's most magnificent R & B record was also its most inventive — so far ahead of its time that it still sounds radical " . AllMusic editor Andy Kellman has cited Brown Sugar and Voodoo as " two of the most excellent and singular R & B albums of the past 15 years " .

 Following Voodoo 's release , D 'Angelo embarked on his second international tour in support of the album , The Voodoo Tour . The tour was sponsored by the clothing company Levi Strauss & Co . , and it featured D 'Angelo promoting an end to gun violence . After signing an initiative on June 7 , 2000 at Hamilton High School in West Los Angeles to collect a million signatures by November 7 in support of " common @-@ sense solutions " to end gun violence , the anti @-@ gun violence organization PAX agreed to sponsor the tour . The tour was also set to feature a wall composed of denim by Levi 's , made available for fans to sign in support of anti @-@ gun violence . D 'Angelo was backed by a group of session personnel and other musicians , assembled and directed by Questlove , called the Soultronics . J Dilla 's group Slum Village opened on several dates , while R & B singer Anthony Hamilton sang backup within the Soultronics on occasion . 
 D 'Angelo 's wardrobe during the tour included tank tops , black leather pants , and boots . Rolling Stone 's Touré commented on one of the outings , " The Soultronics begin each show in all black , but beyond that one requirement , each looks completely distinct . One man is in a deacon 's robe , another in a long cape with a knit ski cap that says FBI . There ’ s a feather boa , a few badass leather coats , and Questlove 's mighty Afro . There 's a P @-@ <unk> freaky flair to the Soultronics ' look . " In contrast to D 'Angelo 's performing behind his keyboard when promoting Brown Sugar , his performances were more lively for Voodoo . Tour manager Alan Leeds , who headed James Brown 's late 1960s and early 1970s outings , as well as Prince 's Purple Rain tour in the mid @-@ 1980s , cited The Voodoo Tour as his most memorable gig . 
 With ticket prices ranging from $ 49 to $ 79 , the tour became one of the most attended shows of 2000 . The tour began on March 1 , 2000 at the House of Blues in Los Angeles , while other venues included Paris Olympia , Trump Taj Mahal , Brixton Academy , the Montreux Jazz Festival , and the Essence Jazz Festival in New Orleans . By July , the tour 's first half had sold out in each city . The tour lasted nearly eight months , while performances went for up to three hours a night . The Voodoo Tour was taken internationally , with one of the most notable performances being the Free Jazz Festival in Brazil . 
 The music video for " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " portrayed D 'Angelo as a sex symbol to mainstream music audiences , which had repercussions on The Voodoo Tour 's second half . During the tour , female fans yelled out for him to take his clothes off , while others tossed clothes onto the stage . As trumpeter Roy Hargrove recounted , " We couldn 't get through one song before women would start to scream for him to take off something [ ... ] It wasn 't about the music . All they wanted him to do was take off his clothes . " This led to frustration and both onstage and offstage outbursts by D 'Angelo , with him breaking stage equipment . Questlove later said , " He 'd get angry and start breaking shit . The audience thinking , ' Fuck your art , I wanna see your ass ! ' , made him angry . " Although some were cancelled due to D 'Angelo 's throat infection during the tour 's mid @-@ March dates , many shows were cancelled due to his personal and emotional problems . D 'Angelo chose on several occasions to not perform on scheduled dates , and delayed others to do physical workouts like stomach crunches . According to Questlove , three weeks worth of concert dates were cancelled , including two weeks worth of shows in Japan . He elaborated on the experience in a 2003 interview for The Believer , saying that : 
 In the same interview , Questlove also said that he had not been fully compensated for his work on Voodoo , stating " I didn ’ t get the rest of my check . " Several of D 'Angelo 's peers and affiliates have noted the commercial impact of the " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " music video and The Voodoo Tour as contributing factors to D 'Angelo 's extended period of absence from the music scene after Voodoo .

 = Jean @-@ Claude Mézières = 
 Jean @-@ Claude Mézières ( French : [ <unk> ] ; born 23 September 1938 ) is a French comic strip artist and illustrator . Born and raised in Paris , he was introduced to drawing by his older brother and influenced by comics artists such as Hergé , Andre Franquin and Morris and later by Jijé and Jack Davis . Educated at the Institut des Arts Appliqués , upon graduation he worked as an illustrator for books and magazines as well as in advertising . A lifelong interest in the Wild West led him to travel to the United States in 1965 in search of adventure as a cowboy , an experience that would prove influential on his later work . 
 Returning to France , Mézières teamed up with his childhood friend , Pierre Christin , to create Valérian and Laureline , the popular , long @-@ running science fiction comics series for which he is best known and which has proved to be influential to many science fiction and fantasy films , including Star Wars . Mézières has also worked as a conceptual designer on several motion picture projects – most notably the 1997 Luc Besson film , The Fifth Element – as well as continuing to work as an illustrator for newspapers , magazines and in advertising . He has also taught courses on the production of comics at the University of Paris VIII : Vincennes — Saint @-@ Denis . 
 Mézières has received international recognition through a number of prestigious awards , most notably the 1984 Grand Prix de la ville d 'Angoulême award .

 = = = Early life and career = = = 
 Raised in the Saint @-@ Mandé area in the suburbs of Paris , Jean @-@ Claude Mézières met his friend and frequent collaborator Pierre Christin at the age of two in an air @-@ raid shelter during World War II . He was first inspired to draw by the influence of his older brother who , aged fourteen , had a drawing published in the magazine OK . Mézières ' initial inspiration came from such OK strips as Arys Buck by Uderzo , <unk> the Martian by Kline and <unk> by Erik . Later he was exposed to Hergé 's The Adventures of Tintin , Franquin 's period on Spirou et Fantasio and , his favourite of all , Morris ' Lucky Luke . He had his first drawings published in 1951 , at the age of thirteen , in the magazine Le journal des <unk> , published by Le Figaro . A year later , " completely fascinated by Tintin " , he created an eleven @-@ page strip , Tintin in California , which features an unusually muscle @-@ bound Arys Buck @-@ influenced Tintin . This was followed , at the age of sixteen , by La Grande <unk> , a Western influenced by Tintin , Lucky Luke and Roy Rogers which he sent to Hergé in the hope of getting published . Hergé sent a reply encouraging him to keep up his efforts . 
 In 1953 , aged fifteen , Mézières enrolled at the Institut des Arts Appliqués in Paris for four years . Also in his class were two other aspiring artists who would go on to find success in the field of comics – Patrick ( Pat ) Mallet and Jean " Moebius " Giraud . It was also at this time that he restarted his friendship with Pierre Christin who was attending the high school next door to the Arts Appliqués , the pair bonding over a mutual interest in jazz and cinema . While at college , Mézières published illustrations and strips for publications such as <unk> <unk> , <unk> et <unk> and Spirou magazine . 
 Following art college , Mézières entered military service , which lasted twenty @-@ eight months , including a tour of duty based in <unk> , Algeria during the Algerian War , returning to France just fifteen days before the Algiers putsch . 
 Answering an advertisement in Le Figaro after his discharge from the army , Mézières was employed by the publishing house Hachette as an illustrator on a series of books titled Histoire des Civilizations ( History of Civilization ) . Intended to run to twenty volumes , Histoire des Civilizations folded after just five . 
 Introduced to Benoit Gillain ( son of the famous comics artist Jijé ) by Jean Giraud , Mézières and Gillain entered into a partnership and opened a studio in 1963 . Working mainly in advertising , Mézières acted as a photographer , model maker and graphic designer . He also assisted Gillain with the setting up of <unk> Journal , a publication he would later work for again upon his return from America . 
 = = = Work in the United States = = = 
 Mézières had been fascinated by the American Old West since he was a little boy through exposure to Western genre films starring the likes of Gary Cooper , Burt Lancaster and James Stewart and comics such as Lucky Luke and Jerry Spring . At the age of sixteen , he had attempted to travel to Mexico with Jean Giraud , whose mother lived there , but was prevented by his parents . 
 In 1965 , Mézières arranged a working visa through a friend of Jijé 's who had a factory in Houston , Texas . In the end , however , he never took up the job in Houston . After staying in New York for a few months , the call of the West proved too strong and eventually he ended up hitchhiking across the country , first to Seattle and then to Montana ( where he worked on a ranch driving tractors , laying posts and cleaning stables ) before ending up in San Francisco . His initial plan was to find work in an advertising agency in San Francisco but he ran foul of the Immigration Service who told him that his visa was good for working in the factory in Houston and nowhere else . He quickly left San Francisco in search of an authentic " Wild West " cowboy experience . Arriving in Salt Lake City , Utah with no money , he sought out Pierre Christin , who was living there while teaching at the University of Utah , and turned up on his doorstep asking him if he could sleep on his <unk> . To make ends meet , Mézières produced some illustrations for a small advertising agency in Salt Lake City and for a Mormon children 's magazine called Children 's Friend as well as selling some photographs he had taken while working on the ranch in Montana . After a few months , he found work on a ranch in Utah : this time succeeding in his aspiration of living the life of a cowboy , an experience he described as " better than in my dreams " . 
 When winter came and there was no work available on the ranches , he collaborated with Christin on a six @-@ page strip called Le Rhum du Punch , a copy of which he sent to Jean Giraud who was by now writing and illustrating Blueberry for the Franco @-@ Belgian comics magazine Pilote . Giraud showed the strip to Pilote 's editor , Rene Goscinny , who agreed to publish it ( issue 335 , 24 March 1966 ) . This was followed by another collaboration titled Comment <unk> en <unk> en se <unk> un mal <unk> ( How to succeed in business by almost killing oneself through hard work ) which was also published in Pilote ( issue 351 , 14 July 1966 ) . By this stage Mézières visa was almost expired and so he used the money from these strips to pay for his ticket home . In leaving America , Mézières also left behind a young woman , Linda , one of Christin 's students : she followed him to France some months later and is now his wife . 
 Mézières experiences in the United States have provided the inspiration for several magazine articles published in Pilote , Tintin , and GEO magazines as well as two books – Olivier chez les cow @-@ boys ( Olivier with the Cowboys ) , a children 's book written by Pierre Christin with photographs and illustrations by Mézières about a visit Christin 's son Olivier paid to the ranch Mézières worked on in Utah and Adieu , rêve américain ... ( Farewell , American dreams ... ) , again written by Christin with photographs and illustrations by Mézières , a nostalgic look back at their time in the United States . 
 = = = Valérian = = = 
 On his return from the United States , Mézières visited the offices of Pilote magazine to see René Goscinny and Jean @-@ Michel Charlier . Goscinny put him to work on L 'extraordinaire et <unk> Aventure de Mr. August Faust ( The Extraordinary and <unk> Adventure of Mr August Faust ) , written by Fred . This would be the first serialised strip that Mézières would work on . Due to the lack of artistic freedom he was given ( because Fred 's script came with all the strip panels already blocked out ) , Mézières found this a difficult assignment . 
 By this time Pierre Christin was dividing his time between Paris and Bordeaux , where he was working on founding the school of journalism at the Institut Universitaire de Technologie ( <unk> ) . Meeting up with Mézières one day , Christin suggested that they work on creating a comic strip together . Both had their experiences in the American West to draw upon but felt , thanks to Lucky Luke , Jerry Spring and Blueberry , that the market for Westerns was already crowded . Instead , Christin suggested that they turn their hands to science fiction , a genre that , at that time , was not prevalent in French comics . Although Goscinny was not a science fiction fan , he wanted to promote innovation and originality in Pilote and so commissioned them to produce a strip . 
 Drawing on influences from literary science fiction , Mézières and Christin devised the character of Valérian , a spatio @-@ temporal agent from the 28th century employed by Galaxity , the capital of the future Earth , to protect space and time from interference . Neither Mézières nor Christin had any interest in making Valérian into a clean @-@ cut hero of the type that appeared in French comics of the time . Instead they sought to create an anti @-@ hero , " a banal character [ without ] any extraordinary means of action " . 
 The first Valérian adventure , Les <unk> Rêves ( Bad Dreams ) appeared in Pilote in 1967 , with the first installment of the story published on 9 November in issue 420 , and ran for fifteen issues , concluding in issue 434 on 15 February 1968 . Bad Dreams shares an artistic style similar to that of Mézières and Christin 's earlier collaborations for Pilote , with influences from Franquin , Morris and Mad magazine artist Jack Davis . Also introduced in this story was Laureline , a peasant girl from the Middle Ages . Originally intended to appear in only one story , the popular reaction to the character meant that she was retained for subsequent stories and she has since become elevated to the main star of the series . 
 Bad Dreams was followed by La Cité des Eaux <unk> ( The City of Moving Waters ) and its sequel Terre en <unk> ( Earth in Flames ) in 1968 and 1969 respectively . These two stories show some evolution in Mézières ' art but also retain the cartoonish influences of Bad Dreams . Jean @-@ Pierre Andrevon best sums up Mézières ' style at this time in his 1970 review of the story where he describes Valérian as a " kind of Lucky Luke of space @-@ time " . The City of Shifting Waters and Earth in Flames were collected together in one volume in 1970 under the title The City of Shifting Waters . This became the first Valérian album – Bad Dreams was skipped because of its short length – thirty pages – relative to the usual album length of around 46 pages . Every Valérian story up to and including The Rage of Hypsis in 1985 would debut in serial form in Pilote before being published as an album . 
 L <unk> des Mille <unk> ( Empire of a Thousand Planets ) premiered in Pilote in 1969 and marked a further development for the Valérian series and for Mézières art . This story was the series ' first full @-@ blown attempt at space opera and it set out for the first time the two main signature elements of Valérian : the use of science fiction as a political allegory and Mézières ' meticulously detailed depictions of alien worlds . The follow @-@ up story World Without Stars saw the final evolution of Mézières ' art into the style that would become prevalent in the Valerian stories of the 1970s and 1980s with the first realistic renderings of Valérian and Laureline as opposed to the caricatures of the earlier stories . 
 Mézières ' style on Valérian remained fairly consistent until 1980s Métro Châtelet , Direction Cassiopeia which mixed the space @-@ opera with scenes set on contemporary Earth . This style continued for five albums until 1990s The Living Weapons which saw a change in Mézières ' style back towards the cartoonish style of the earlier stories . 
 Valérian is Mézières ' best known work , translated into at least thirteen languages : the last album , L <unk> Temps , was published in January 2010 . It is one of publisher Dargaud 's top five best selling comics series . Various attempts were made from the late 1970s onwards to adapt Valérian for film or television and an animated series , titled Time Jam : Valerian & Laureline , made its debut in 2007 . 
 = = = Work in film and television = = = 
 Mézières was always as interested in the cinema as he was in drawing . In 1957 , he began work with Jean Giraud on creating an animated Western . Dissatisfied with the results , the project was abandoned after 45 seconds of animation had been completed . The same year he shot a short , ten @-@ minute , 8mm film , La vie d 'un Rêve ( Life is a Dream ) , with Pierre Christin . 
 The success of Valérian , however , has led to Mézières becoming involved in a number of , mainly science fiction , film and television projects . The first of these was Billet Doux ( Love Letter ) , a 1984 television series starring Pierre <unk> as a comic strip editor for which Mézières mocked up comic book covers and characters . 
 Also in 1984 he produced designs for director Jeremy Kagan who was attempting to adapt René <unk> 's novel La Nuit des temps ( The Ice People ) . Due to difficulties experienced by the film 's Iranian producer as a result of the Islamic revolution in Iran , the film was never made . Some of Mézières ' production art was published in Les Extras de Mézières . 
 In October 1985 , Mézières was contacted by the German director Peter Fleischmann who proposed to adapt Russians Arkady and Boris Strugatsky 's 1964 novel Hard to Be a God into a film . This was to be the first major German @-@ Soviet co @-@ production . Mézières travelled to Moscow to join the production team and also to Uzbekistan where it was proposed to shoot the film . Travelling from there to Munich , he produced several concept drawings and paintings over a three @-@ month period before the project was suspended due to funding difficulties . At this point Mézières left the production and returned to France . Filming was eventually scheduled to begin in April 1986 in Kiev and Mézières re @-@ joined the production , creating storyboards for some scenes . However , at this time the Chernobyl disaster occurred only 100 km from Kiev and production was again halted . The film was eventually finished in 1989 , but Mézières ' concepts were barely used . Again , many of Mézières ' designs were later published in Les Extras de Mézières . 
 In December 1991 , Mézières was approached by director Luc Besson , a lifelong fan of Valérian , who wanted Mézières to work on designs for a science fiction film called Zaltman Bléros . Along with his old friend Jean Giraud , who had also been approached by Besson , he began work producing concepts of buildings and vehicles for the futuristic New York depicted in the script . Interested by the flying taxi cabs that appeared in some of the drawings , Besson asked Mézières to draw more taxis and also a flying police car . By the start of 1993 , production had stalled and Besson moved to the United States to work on the film Léon . Mézières returned to Valérian for the album The Circles of Power , published in 1994 . This album made use of some of the concepts Mézières had worked on for Zaltman Bléros and featured a character , S 'Traks , who drove a flying taxi around a great metropolis on the planet Rubanis . Mézières sent a copy of the album to Besson when it was finished . The commercial success of Léon led to Zaltman Bléros , now re @-@ titled The Fifth Element , being green @-@ lit for production . Mézières returned to the production and was amused to discover that the occupation of Korben Dallas , the film 's main protagonist , had been changed from a worker in a rocket @-@ ship factory to that of a taxi driver – obviously inspired by Mézières ' drawings for the film and by The Circles of Power . Mézières produced further designs for the film including more taxis as well as spaceships and sets including the Fhloston Paradise liner seen in the latter part of the film . The Fifth Element was finally completed and released in 1997 . Mézières published many of his concept drawings for the film in Les Extras de Mézières No. 2 : Mon <unk> Element . 
 = = = Other works = = = 
 At the same time as he has been working on Valérian and various film and television projects , Mézières has worked extensively producing illustrations and comic strips for magazines and newspapers such as Pilote , Métal Hurlant and Le Monde , covers for books , art for advertising campaigns , etc . For Le Monde , in 1993 , he was a regular illustrator for the Heures Locales column . 
 Mézières was also involved at one point in giving hands @-@ on courses on the production of comic strips at the University of Paris , Vincennes . Graduates of his course include André <unk> and Régis Loisel . 
 He has also collaborated with Pierre Christin on a number of non @-@ Valérian projects . The first of these was Lady Polaris in 1987 , an illustrated novel about the mysterious disappearance of a cargo vessel , the Lady Polaris . The narrative comprises various documents related to the lost ship : comic strips , log books , even an investigative journalism account by a fictionalised Mézières and Christin . The action takes place against the backdrop of many of the great seaports of Europe . Mézières undertook considerable research in putting together this book , visiting the ports of Liverpool , Copenhagen , Antwerp , Rotterdam , Hamburg , Lübeck , Bordeaux , Bilbao and Genoa . 
 Another collaboration with Christin was Canal Choc , a series of four albums about a television news team investigating strange phenomena . Mézières did not draw these albums but supervised a team of artists including Philippe <unk> and Hugues <unk> . 
 In 2001 , Mézières was approached by the city of Lille , which had been designated European Capital of Culture in 2004 , to produce something for the celebrations . He created a series of futuristic arches , called Chemin des Etoiles ( The Way of the Stars ) along the Rue Faidherbe in the city , similar to those seen at the Port Abyss spaceport depicted in the Valérian album At the Edge of the Great Void which was first published the same year . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Mézières ' arrival on the French comics scene with Valérian was contemporaneous with the debuts of other notable French science fiction strips including Luc Orient by Greg and Eddy <unk> and Lone Sloane by Philippe <unk> . The success of these strips would eventually lead to the creation of Métal Hurlant , the highly influential French comics magazine dedicated to science fiction . Mézières ' influence has been noticed in such strips as Dani Futuro ( by Víctor Mora and Carlos Giménez ) and <unk> ( by Mora and José Maria Cardona ) . His visual style has also had an impact on some American comics artists notably Walt Simonson and Gil Kane . Sometimes this has gone beyond mere influence – following a complaint by Mézières , the artist Angus McKie admitted that several panels of his strip So Beautiful and So Dangerous were copied from the Valérian album Ambassador of the Shadows . 
 Outside of comics , Mézières ' art has been particularly influential on science fiction and fantasy film . In particular , several commentators , such as Kim Thompson , Jean @-@ Philippe Guerand and the newspaper Libération , have noted certain similarities between the Valérian albums and the Star Wars film series . Both series are noted for the " lived @-@ in " look given to their various settings and for the diverse alien creatures they feature . Mézières ' response upon seeing Star Wars was that he was " dazzled , jealous ... and furious ! " . As a riposte , he produced an illustration for Pilote magazine in 1983 depicting the Star Wars characters Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa meeting Valérian and Laureline in a bar surrounded by a bestiary of alien creatures typical of that seen in both series . " Fancy meeting you here ! " says Leia . " Oh , we 've been hanging around here for a long time ! " retorts Laureline . Mézières has since been informed that Doug Chiang , design director on The Phantom Menace , kept a set of Valérian albums and Les Extras de Mézières in his library . 
 Mézières has also noticed similarities between some of the sets in the 1982 film Conan the Barbarian and the planet seen in Birds of the Master and between some of the production sketches for the alien fighters in the 1996 film Independence Day and Valérian and Laureline 's astroship .

 = Pan Celtic Festival = 
 The Pan Celtic Festival ( Irish : <unk> Pan <unk> ) is a Celtic @-@ language music festival held annually in the week following Easter , since its inauguration in 1971 . The first Pan Celtic Festival took place in Killarney , County Kerry , Ireland . Its aim is to promote the modern Celtic languages and cultures and artists from all six Celtic nations : Brittany , Cornwall , Ireland , Isle of Man , Scotland and Wales . 
 Each participating Celtic Nation undergoes their own national selection event in order to determine their representatives for the annual Pan Celtic Festival . The most successful Celtic nation is Wales , with fourteen wins , with Cornwall following closely behind having won ten times . <unk> , who represented Cornwall in 2012 and 2013 , became the first artist in the festival 's history to have won twice . Isle of Man is the least successful nation , having only won once in 2014 . The current winners , as of April 2016 , are Wales , represented by Cordia with the song " Dim <unk> Un " .

 Formed in Killarney , County Kerry , Ireland , the Pan Celtic Festival was organised as a music festival to be held every Spring , to promote the modern cultures and Celtic languages through the medium of music . It was originally entitled " <unk> <unk> Bach " ( English : " Small Music Festival " ) , by Con O 'Connaill , but later changed to the name it is currently known by today . In May 1971 , the first festival took place in Killarney ; and featured performers from Wales ( Phyllis and <unk> Evans ) , Ireland ( Scoil na <unk> ) , and Brittany ( Les <unk> Group and Alan Stivell ) . 
 <unk> Evans engaged in discussions with the event organiser , O 'Connaill , following the 1971 Festival , and invited him to the National Eisteddfod of Wales . At the Eisteddfod , O 'Connaill met with members from other Celtic nations , forming a committee for the Pan Celtic Festival . Participants from the six Celtic nations of Brittany ( <unk> ) , Cornwall ( Kernow ) , Wales ( Cymru ) , Scotland ( Alba ) , Ireland ( Éire ) and the Isle of Man ( Mannin ) took part in the second Pan Celtic Festival held again in Killarney in 1972 . It was during this festival that the core structure of the event was finalised following a meeting with committee members . These principles of the event are to promote the languages , musical talents and cultures within the six territories recognised as Celtic nations .

 = Operation Passage to Freedom = 
 Operation Passage to Freedom was a term used by the United States Navy to describe its assistance in transporting in 1954 – 55 310 @,@ 000 Vietnamese civilians , soldiers and non @-@ Vietnamese members of the French Army from communist North Vietnam ( the Democratic Republic of Vietnam ) to South Vietnam ( the State of Vietnam , later to become the Republic of Vietnam ) . The French and other countries may have transported a further 500 @,@ 000 . In the wake of the French defeat at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu , the Geneva Accords of 1954 decided the fate of French Indochina after eight years of war between French Union forces and the Viet Minh , which sought Vietnamese independence . The accords resulted in the partition of Vietnam at the 17th parallel north , with Ho Chi Minh 's communist Viet Minh in control of the north and the French @-@ backed State of Vietnam in the south . The agreements allowed a 300 @-@ day period of grace , ending on May 18 , 1955 , in which people could move freely between the two Vietnams before the border was sealed . The partition was intended to be temporary , pending elections in 1956 to reunify the country under a national government . Between 600 @,@ 000 and one million northerners moved south , including more than 200 @,@ 000 French citizens and soldiers in the French army while between 14 @,@ 000 - 45 @,@ 000 civilians and approximately 100 @,@ 000 Viet Minh fighters moved in the opposite direction . 
 The mass emigration of northerners was facilitated primarily by the French Air Force and Navy . American naval vessels supplemented the French in evacuating northerners to Saigon , the southern capital . The operation was accompanied by a large humanitarian relief effort , bankrolled in the main by the United States government in an attempt to absorb a large tent city of refugees that had sprung up outside Saigon . For the US , the migration was a public relations coup , generating wide coverage of the flight of Vietnamese from the perceived oppression of communism to the " free world " in the southern dictatorship under American auspices . The period was marked by a Central Intelligence Agency @-@ backed propaganda campaign on behalf of South Vietnam 's Roman Catholic Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem . The campaign exhorted Catholics to flee impending religious persecution under communism , and around 60 % of the north 's 1 million Catholics obliged . 
 = = Background = = 
 At the end of World War II , the Viet Minh had proclaimed independence under the Democratic Republic of Vietnam ( DRV ) in September 1945 . This occurred after the withdrawal of Imperial Japan , which had seized control of the French colony during World War II . The military struggle started in November 1946 when France attempted to reassert control over Indochina with an attack on the northern port city of Haiphong . The DRV was recognised by the Soviet Union and the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) . On the other hand , the western powers recognised the French @-@ backed State of Vietnam , nominally led by Emperor Bảo Đại , but with a French @-@ trained Vietnamese National Army ( VNA ) which was loyal to the French Union forces . In May 1954 , after eight years of fighting , the French were surrounded and defeated in a mountainous northern fortress at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu . France 's withdrawal from Indochina was finalised in the Geneva Accords of July 1954 , after two months of negotiations between Ho 's DRV , France , the PRC and the Soviet Union . Under the terms of the agreement , Vietnam was temporarily divided at the 17th parallel north pending elections in 1956 to choose a national government that would administer a reunified country . The communist Viet Minh were left in control of North Vietnam , while the State of Vietnam controlled the south . French Union forces would gradually withdraw from Vietnam as the situation stabilised . Both Vietnamese sides were unsatisfied with the outcome at Geneva ; Ngo Dinh Diem , Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam , denounced France 's agreement and ordered his delegation not to sign . He stated " We cannot recognise the seizure by Soviet China . . . of over half of our national territory " and that " We can neither concur in the brutal enslavement of millions of compatriots " . North Vietnamese Prime Minister Phạm Văn Đồng expressed bitterness after his Soviet and Chinese backers threatened to cut support if he did not agree to the peace terms ; Dong had wanted to press home the Viet Minh 's military advantage so they could lay claim to more territory at the negotiating table . 
 Under the accords , there was to be a 300 @-@ day period in which free civilian movement was allowed between the two zones , whereas military forces were compelled to relocate to their respective sides . All French Far East Expeditionary Corps and VNA forces in the north were to be evacuated south of the 17th parallel , while all Viet Minh fighters had to relocate to the north . The accords stipulated that civilians were to be given the opportunity to move to their preferred half of Vietnam . Article 14 ( d ) of the accords stated that : 
 Any civilians residing in a district controlled by one party who wish to go and live in the zone assigned to the other party shall be permitted and helped to do so . 
 Article 14 ( d ) allowed for a 300 @-@ day period of free movement between the two Vietnams , ending on May 18 , 1955 . The parties had given little thought to the logistics of the population resettlement during the negotiations at Geneva , and assumed the matter would be minor . Despite claiming that his northern compatriots had been " enslaved " , Diem expected no more than 10 @,@ 000 refugees . General Paul Ely , the French Commissioner @-@ General of Indochina , expected that around 30 @,@ 000 landlords and business executives would move south and proclaimed that he would take responsibility for transporting any Vietnamese who wanted to move to territory controlled by the French Union , such as South Vietnam . French Prime Minister Pierre Mendès France and his government had planned to provide aid for around 50 @,@ 000 displaced persons . Mendes @-@ France was sure that the <unk> would be able to handle the work all by itself . The Americans saw the period as an opportunity to weaken the communist north . 
 = = Evacuation = = 
 The predictions made by Diem and Ely were extremely inaccurate . There had been heavy fighting in northern Vietnam , where the Vietminh were at their strongest , and many people had been forced to abandon their homes . Although French charities had been operating in the north , the refugee camps were disorganised and were unable to provide little more than shelter . As a result , there was a great number of northerners who wanted to leave and start a new life in the south . 
 The French started their evacuation with their pre @-@ conceived notion that few would want to head south . As knowledge of the migration program spread through the communist @-@ controlled north , thousands of predominantly northern Catholic asylum @-@ seekers descended on the capital Hanoi and the port of Haiphong , both of which were still in French control . This led to anarchy and confusion as the emigrants fought over limited shelter , food , medicine and places on the ships and planes that were bound for the south . By early August , there were over 200 @,@ 000 evacuees waiting in Hanoi and Haiphong . Initially the ad hoc camps had insufficient sanitation and water quality control , leading to the possibility of outbreaks of disease . Some American representatives said that they were the worst conditions they had seen . The conditions continued to be poor and chaotic after the evacuation got into full swing , and did not improve significantly for a month . There was no organization infrastructure as far as registration or medical records and immunisation of the waiting evacuees . The communists thus sent their propaganda activists through the camps and said that the lack of organisation proved that life for prospective refugees would be even worse in the south , where they would be completely under the control of South Vietnam . 
 The French Navy and Air Force had been depleted during World War II . They were unable to deal with the unexpectedly large number of refugees . This was exacerbated by their unwillingness to allow civilian evacuees to travel on trains from outlying districts to Hanoi and Haiphong , as their priority was evacuating their military personnel and equipment . France asked Washington for assistance , so the US Department of Defense ordered the US Navy to mobilise an evacuation task force . 
 The American government saw the evacuation as an opportunity to weaken the communists by providing for and thereby winning the loyalty of the refugees to the anti @-@ communist cause . The United States Operation Mission proposed that aside from helping to evacuate refugees to the south and thereby draining the communist population base , the Americans should provide healthcare , shelter , food and clothing in order to help the anti @-@ communists win the fidelity of their compatriots . Another benefit of participating in the evacuation was that American personnel would be on the ground in North Vietnam , allowing them to gather intelligence on communist activities . 
 Accordingly , Task Force 90 ( CTF @-@ 90 ) was inaugurated under the command of Rear Admiral Lorenzo Sabin . US servicemen renovated and transformed cargo vessels and tank carriers to house the thousands of Vietnamese who would be evacuated in them . The repairs were frequently done en route to Haiphong from their bases at Subic Bay in the Philippines . Sabin had no prior involvement in humanitarian matters , and he and his staff prepared Operation Order 2 – 54 — the 114 @-@ page policy framework for the operation — in the space of a week during their sea voyage from Japan to Vietnam . 
 The first US vessel to participate in the mass evacuation was the Menard , which left Haiphong on August 17 . It carried 1 @,@ 924 refugees for a 1 @,@ 600 kilometre , three @-@ day journey to the southern capital . By this time , there were already 132 @,@ 000 people registered at the waiting areas , although very few had any identification . As a result , there would be more work to be done in identifying their needs once they arrived in the south . The Montrose followed on the next day , with 2 @,@ 100 passengers . Both were originally built as attack transport vessels . In August , the US policy was liberalised so that Vietnamese and French military personnel could also be evacuated at the discretion of CTF @-@ 90 and the Chief Military Assistance Advisory Group ( <unk> ) . To cope with the rising volume of southbound sea transport , <unk> established a refugee debarkation site at Vũng Tàu , a coastal port at the entrance of the Saigon River . This site relieved congestion in the Saigon refugee camps and decreased the traffic bottlenecks along the river . A setback occurred when a typhoon struck the Haiphong area , destroying almost half of the refugee staging area . Despite the problems , by September 3 , the US Navy had evacuated 47 @,@ 000 northerners after only two weeks of operations . The high rate of evacuation caused the South Vietnamese government to order that only one shipment of at most 2 @,@ 500 passengers was to arrive in Saigon or Vũng Tàu per day , until September 25 . The population pressure in the south was eased as incoming numbers fell due to Viet Minh propaganda campaigns and forcible detention , combined with the rice harvesting season , which had prompted some to delay their departure . Some were even waiting to finish all their business deals before moving in the Lunar New Year . On October 10 , the Viet Minh were given full control of Hanoi , closing off one point of evacuation for those who wanted out . Some also decided to stay behind and see how the Viet Minh would treat the inhabitants of Hanoi before making a decision on whether to leave their ancestral lands . On October 20 , the French authorities that were still in control of the ports decided to waive docking fees on US vessels engaged in the evacuation . Because of the high demand , the naval vessels had to travel quickly ; one ship completed one round trip in a record of only six days . The record for the most passengers taken in one journey was set by the USS General Black , which sailed on October 29 with 5 @,@ 224 Vietnamese aboard . In November , the evacuation was further hampered by another typhoon , while the entire crew of one American vessel were struck down by a scabies outbreak . In December , because of Viet Minh obstruction , which prevented people from rural and regional areas from travelling to Hanoi and Haiphong to emigrate , the French Navy sent ships to hover just off the coast near the regional town of Vinh to evacuate refugees . 
 According to COMIGAL , the South Vietnamese government agency responsible for the migration , French aircraft made 4 @,@ 280 trips , carrying a total of 213 @,@ 635 refugees . A total of 555 @,@ 037 passengers were recorded on 505 sea trips . The French Navy accounted for the vast majority of the naval evacuees , with 388 voyages , while the US Navy made 109 . British , Taiwanese and Polish ships made two , two and four journeys respectively . The official figures reported that a total of 768 @,@ 672 people had migrated under military supervision . Of this number around 190 @,@ 000 were French and Saigon soldiers and returned prisoners ; some 43 @,@ 000 were military dependents , " 15 @,@ 000 – 25 @,@ 000 Nung tribesmen who were military auxiliaries , between 25 @,@ 000 and 40 @,@ 000 French citizens , and about 45 @,@ 000 Chinese residents . " It also included several thousand people who had worked for the French and Vietnamese administrations in the North . The official figures recorded that more than 109 @,@ 000 people journeyed into the south by their own means , some arriving outside the 300 @-@ day period . These people typically crossed the river that divided the zones on makeshift rafts , sailed on improvised watercraft into a southern port , or trekked through Laos . As of 1957 , the South Vietnamese government claimed a total of 928 @,@ 152 refugees , of whom 98 @.@ 3 % were ethnic Vietnamese . The 1957 report said that 85 % were engaged in farming or fishing for their livelihood and 85 % were Catholics , while the remainder were Buddhists or Protestants . However , an October 1955 government report claimed that 76 @.@ 3 % were Catholics , 23 @.@ 5 % were Buddhists and 0 @.@ 2 % Protestants . In 1959 , however , the head of COMIGAL , Bui Van Luong , admitted that the actual number of refugees could have been as low as 600 @,@ 000 . The official data excluded approximately 120 @,@ 000 anti @-@ communist military personnel and claimed that only 4 @,@ 358 people moved north , though no historians consider this number credible . The northward migration was attributed to itinerant workers from rubber plantations who returned north for family reasons . 
 An independent study by the French historian Bernard B. Fall determined that the US Navy transported around 310 @,@ 000 refugees . The French were credited with around 214 @,@ 000 airlifted refugees , 270 @,@ 000 seaborne refugees and 120 @,@ 000 and 80 @,@ 000 Vietnamese and French military evacuees respectively . During the US Navy voyages , 54 people died on board , and 111 babies were born . Fall believed that of the 109 @,@ 000 refugees who went south by their own means , a large number hitchhiked on southbound French transport vessels that were not related to the migration operation . Fall felt that the figures were likely to have been overestimated , due to immigration fraud . Some refugees would travel south and register themselves , before smuggling themselves onto vessels returning north for another shipment of humans . They would then return south and re @-@ register to claim another aid package . Likewise , with instances of entire villages moving south , the authorities frequently did not explicitly count the number of villagers , but simply took the word of the village leaders . The chiefs would often inflate the population figures to claim more aid rations . The mass exodus did not disrupt the north largely because whole villages often emigrated , instead of half a village moving and leaving the remainder of the community in disarray . Fall estimated that around 120 @,@ 000 Viet Minh troops and their dependents went north . Most of these evacuations were attributed to Viet Minh military strategy , with some being ordered to stay behind in readiness for future guerrilla activities . The northward movement was facilitated by vessels leaving from assembly areas at Qui Nhơn and Cà Mau at the southernmost extremity of Vietnam . The voyages to North Vietnam were provided by empty French ships heading back north to fetch more southbound anti @-@ communists , as well vessels from communist nations such as Poland . The Viet Minh also actively cultivated the Montagnard indigenous people of Vietnam , whose land in the Central Highlands was encroached upon by incoming northern settlers . The communists spread propaganda through broadcasts in tribal languages and infiltrated the highland areas . According to a study by the Michigan State University Group , some 6 @,@ 000 tribespeople went north with the communists , accompanied by some Viet Minh who had adopted the indigenous culture . 
 The largest numbers of Catholic refugees came from the two northern dioceses with the highest percentage of Catholics in Vietnam . These were Phát <unk> and Bùi Chu , mainly located in modern @-@ day Ninh Bình and Nam Định Provinces respectively . The bishops of the dioceses , had been strident opponents of the communists , and both had organised Catholic paramilitary groups that fought against the Viet Minh , which had long identified Catholics with colonial collaborationism . When the communists had gained the upper hand in the north , many Catholics had already begun making preparations to move to the south , where the communists were less influential , and large movements began immediately when news of the partition came through . After the defeat of French Union forces at Dien Bien Phu , French officers had evacuated their troops from Bui Chu and Phat Diem to reinforce the area between Hanoi and Haiphong which they still controlled , making it very easy for the communists to progress through the Catholic strongholds . The French withdrawal was not announced and was supposed to be secret , but the local church leadership found out quickly and the local Catholic community had already begun to move to the ports before end of talks in Geneva . By the time the accords were signed , 45 @,@ 000 Catholic refugees were already waiting in Hanoi , Haiphong or Hải Dương . According to the records of the Catholic Church , over 70 % of Catholics in Bui Chu and Phat Diem left , compared to around 50 % in most other areas . The Catholic records claim that only a third of Hanoi Catholics left , and that around 80 % of all clergy left . In all areas , a higher proportion of priests left than laypeople , which has been attributed to the communists inflicting heavier punishments on more prominent opposition figures , such as clerics . The departure rate was also lower in areas further removed from the coastal areas and departure ports ; in Hưng Hóa , only 11 @.@ 8 % of Catholics were recorded by their diocese as have migrated . It has been speculated that the low rate of Hanoi residents choosing to depart may have been because the city was relatively untouched by the decade of fighting , and that the varying and high rate of departures among rural Catholics was due to the influence of the local clergy ; priests in northern Vietnam were noted to be more theocratic and involved in civic decision @-@ making . They used a variety of ways to persuade their disciples to migrate ; some explained their belief that circumstances would be difficult for people who did not immigrate , some simply gave dogmatic reasons such as " God is not here any more " , while others gave no reason at all and made declarations such as " We are leaving tomorrow " in the expectation that their followers would obey without question . Surveys on the immigrants suggested they were largely content to follow the recommendation of the local priest . In some areas , the bishop in charge of the diocese told Catholics to stay , but laypeople were more likely to leave or stay depending on the stance of the local priest with whom they had regular contact ; in many cases , such as in Hanoi , a majority of priests ignored their bishop and left anyway . 
 In many cases , families left some members behind in the hope that they would retain land for the family , while there were reports that a minority of Catholics with links to the communists decided to stay willingly . 
 The US provided emergency food , medical care , clothing and shelter at reception centres in Saigon and elsewhere in the south . American sources donating through the United States Operations Mission ( USOM ) were responsible for 97 % of the aid . The USOM sent public health professionals to help with sanitation in an attempt to prevent the spread of disease . Doctors and nurses were sent to help train local workers in healthcare procedures , so that they would eventually be able to take care of the medical needs refugees . In order of contributions to the aid efforts , the US were followed by France , United Kingdom , Australia , West Germany , New Zealand and the Netherlands . Australian sent farming equipment and accompanying technical instructors under the Colombo Plan . 
 With most of the refugees being Catholic , the voluntary agencies most prominent in helping the US and French governments with humanitarian relief efforts were Catholic . The National Catholic Welfare Conference and Catholic Relief Services contributed over US $ 35 million ( $ 308 million as of 2016 ) and sent hundreds of aid workers to South Vietnam . US clerics such as Joseph Harnett spent more than a year supervising the establishment of humanitarian and religious projects in Saigon . These included the establishment and maintenance of orphanages , hospitals , schools and churches . Harnett 's volunteers fed rice and warm milk to 100 @,@ 000 refugees on a daily basis . Tens of thousands of blankets donated by the American Catholic organisations served as beds , makeshift roofs against monsoonal downpours and as temporary walls in mass housing facilities . The United Nations Children 's Fund contributed technical assistance and helped to distribute merchandise , foodstuffs and various other gifts . 
 = = Propaganda campaign = = 
 The US ran a propaganda campaign through the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) to enhance the size of the southward exodus . The program was directed by Colonel Edward Lansdale , who masqueraded as the assistant US air attaché in Saigon while leading a covert group that specialised in psychological warfare . Lansdale had advised Diem that it was imperative to maximise the population in the south in preparation for the national reunification elections . When Diem noted the limited ability of the south to absorb refugees , Lansdale assured him that the US would bear the burden . Diem thus authorised Lansdale to launch the propaganda campaign . According to the historian Seth Jacobs , the campaign " ranked with the most audacious enterprises in the history of covert action " . Lansdale recollected that " U.S. officials wanted to make sure that as many persons as possible , particularly the strongly anti @-@ communist Catholics , relocated in the South " . While many Diem supporters claimed that the mass exodus was proof of the popularity of Diem and the people 's hatred of communism , the CIA operative Chester Cooper said " the vast movement of Catholics to South Vietnam was not spontaneous " . However , while Lansdale is often credited by historians — usually those critical of his influence — with the large exodus of refugees due to superstition , he rejected the notion that his campaign had much effect on popular sentiment , saying in later years : " People don ’ t just pull up their roots and transplant themselves because of slogans . They honestly feared what might happen to them , and their emotion was strong enough to overcome their attachment to their land , their homes , and their ancestral graves . So the initiative was very much theirs — and we mainly made the transportation possible . " Some northerners who stayed behind and were interviewed half a century later said that they had not come across any pro @-@ migration propaganda and said that their decisions were based on discussions with fellow locals . They said that concerns over the possible effects of communist rule were discussed among themselves independent of outside information . 
 Lansdale employed a variety of stunts to encourage more northerners to move south . South Vietnamese soldiers in civilian clothing infiltrated the north , spreading rumours of impending doom . One story was that the communists had a deal with Vietnam 's traditional enemy China , allowing two communist Chinese divisions to invade the north . The story reported that the Chinese were raping and pillaging with the tacit approval of the communists . Lansdale hired counterfeiters to produce bogus Viet Minh leaflets on how to behave under communist rule , advising them to create a list of their material possessions so that the communists would be able to confiscate them more easily , thereby fomenting peasant discontent . 
 Lansdale 's men forged documents allegedly issued by the Vietminh that promised to seize all private property . He claimed that " The day following distribution of these <unk> , refugee registration tripled " . The Central Evacuation Committee in Haiphong , an American @-@ funded group , issued pamphlets claiming that in South Vietnam , " the cost of living is three times less " , and that there would be welfare payments and free <unk> , the latter two of which were false . It said that " By remaining in the North you will experience famine and will damn your souls . Set out now , brothers and sisters ! " 
 Lansdale 's campaign focused on northern Catholics , who were known for their strongly anti @-@ communist tendencies . His staff printed tens of thousands of pamphlets with slogans such as " Christ has gone south " and " the Virgin Mary has departed from the North " , alleging anti @-@ Catholic persecution under Ho Chi Minh . Posters depicting communists closing a cathedral and forcing the congregation to pray in front of Ho , adorned with a caption " make your choice " , were pasted around Hanoi and Haiphong . Diem himself went to Hanoi several times in 1954 while the French were still garrisoned there to encourage Catholics to move , portraying himself as a savior of Catholics . The campaign resonated with northern Catholic priests , who told their disciples that Ho would end freedom of worship , that sacraments would no longer be given and that anyone who stayed behind would endanger their souls . A survey of refugees some five decades later confirmed that they felt their interests would be best served under a Catholic leader and that Diem had substantial personal appeal due to his religion . Some have argued that the Catholics would have left regardless of Lansdale 's activities , as they had first @-@ hand experiences of their priests and co @-@ religionists being captured and executed for resisting the communist revolution . 
 Regardless of the impact of the propaganda campaigns , the Catholic immigrants helped to strengthen Diem 's support base . Before the partition , most of Vietnam 's Catholic population lived in the north . After the borders were sealed , the majority were now under Diem 's rule . The Catholics implicitly trusted Diem due to their common faith and were a source of loyal political support . One of Diem 's main objections to the Geneva Accords — which the State of Vietnam refused to sign — was that it deprived him of the Catholic regions of North Vietnam , and he had unsuccessfully called for Bui Chu and Phat Diem to be omitted from the communist zone . With entire Catholic provinces moving south en masse , in 1956 the Diocese of Saigon had more Catholics than Paris and Rome . Of Vietnam 's 1 @.@ 45 million Catholics , over a million lived in the south , 55 % of whom were northern refugees . Prior to this , only 520 @,@ 000 Catholics lived in the Dioceses of Saigon and Huế combined . 
 Apart from anti @-@ communist campaigning , economics was another factor in moving south . The US gave handouts of US $ 89 ( $ 784 as of 2016 ) for each refugee who moved ; the per capita income in Vietnam at the time was only $ 85 per year ( $ 749 per year as of 2016 ) . Others have pointed to natural geographic factors unrelated to and uncontrollable by political regimes . They point to the fact that the land in the south was seen as being more productive , and memories of the Great Vietnamese Famine of 1945 , which killed millions in the north , as reasons independent of politics that motivated migrants . In the mid @-@ 1950s , northern Vietnam again suffered food shortages , and some migrants have cited food security as motive for relocation . Adding to this was a general perception that Saigon was a more modern city with more economic vibrancy . Earlier in the 20th century , there had also been instances of campaigns by Catholics to encourage southerly migration to exploit underdeveloped land in the south , so it was not a new concept for them . 
 The Viet Minh engaged in counter @-@ propaganda campaigns in an attempt to deter the exodus from the north . They moved through the neighbourhoods of Hanoi and Haiphong on a daily basis , passing out their pamphlets . Evacuees reported being ridiculed by the Viet Minh , who claimed that they would be sadistically tortured before being killed by the French and American authorities in Haiphong . The communists depicted the personnel of Task Force 90 as cannibals who would eat their babies , predicting disaster in the jungles , beaches and mountains of South Vietnam . They further said that the Americans would throw them overboard to drown in the ocean . The Viet Minh boasted to the emigrants that it was a high and futile risk , asserting that the 1956 reunification elections would result in a decisive communist victory . The communist efforts were helped by the fact that many French or State of Vietnam offices in the north evacuated their personnel and sold or otherwise left behind their printing facilities , many of which fell into Viet Minh hands . 
 = = Communist prevention of emigration = = 
 Along with counter @-@ propaganda , the Viet Minh also sought to detain or otherwise prevent would @-@ be refugees from leaving . As the American and French military personnel were only present in the major cities and at air bases and on the waterfront , the communists tried to stop people from trying to leave through a military presence in the <unk> to interdict the flow of would @-@ be refugees . The communists were most effective in Nghệ An and Thanh Hóa Provinces , which they had long controlled ; only 20 % of Catholics in Thanh Hóa migrated . In parts of the Red River Delta , ferry services and other water traffic were shut down so that refugees would not be able to travel to Haiphong . In some cases there were reports of thousands @-@ strong groups of refugees being forced back by similar numbers of armed communist cadres . The most notorious took place at Tra Ly and Ba Lang . At Tra Ly , Viet Minh troops forcibly dispersed most of a group of about 10 @,@ 000 refugees . Some villagers who fled to sandbars offshore hoping for sanctuary were trapped by rising tides . The French asked the International Control Commission to dispatch mobile teams to Tra Ly , but the Viet Minh hindered ICC movement and had finished their job before the team arrived . French naval officers on the scene reported that the Viet Minh fired upon villagers in the dunes . At Ba Lang in December , the Viet Minh arrested refugee leaders who had contacted a French ship . This prompted villagers to clash with soldiers , killing one and capturing three , before barricading themselves inside a church . Troops forced their way into the church and dispersed the Vietnamese peasants , arresting several hundred . The village leader and a priest were tried by a kangaroo " People ’ s Court " and sentenced to prison . As a result , many refugees headed directly for the nearest coastal point to wait for passing vessels . In one sweep of the coast near the Catholic stronghold of Phát <unk> , the French Navy picked up 42 @,@ 000 stranded refugees in two days . The VNA also swept the area in late 1954 for two days , picking up several thousand refugees , but increasing communist attacks forced them to stop . In some rural coastal areas where it was common for refugees to converge before boarding vessels to connect to the long @-@ distance naval vessels taking them south , the Viet Minh installed mortars on the beaches to deter prospective immigrants . 
 They prohibited mass gatherings in an attempt to stop entire villages or other large groups of people from emigrating together , and also isolated people who sold their water buffalo and other belongings , as this was a clear sign that they intended to end their farming . Both the Americans and the South Vietnamese lodged complaints to the International Control Commission about the violations of the Geneva Accords , but little action was taken . According to B. S. M. Murti , the Indian representative on the ICC , the communists did not try to stop the refugees at first , but increased their efforts over time as it became clearer that large proportions of the population wanted to emigrate . 
 = = Media and public relations = = 
 The United States reaped substantial public relations benefits from the mass exodus , which was used to depict the allure of the " free world " . This was enhanced by the comparatively negligible number of people who voluntarily moved into the communist north . The event generated unprecedented press coverage of Vietnam . Initially however , the press coverage was scant , and Admiral Sabin bemoaned the lack of promotional work done by the US Navy to publicise the evacuation among the American media . At one point , a journalist from the Associated Press travelled from Manila to Haiphong , but was ordered back by superiors on the grounds that Americans were not interested in the subject . 
 However , over time , the media interest grew . Many prominent news agencies sent highly decorated reporters to cover the event . The New York Times dispatched Tillman and Peggy Durdin , while the New York Herald Tribune sent the Pulitzer Prize @-@ winning war reporters Marguerite Higgins and Homer <unk> . Future US embassy official John Mecklin covered the event for Time Life . The press reports presented highly laudatory and emotional accounts of the mass exodus of Vietnamese away from the communist north . Time Life called the mass migration " a tragedy of almost nightmarish proportions ... Many [ refugees ] went without food or water or medicine for days , sustained only by the faith in their heart . " 
 In the American Catholic press , the migration was given front page coverage in diocesan newspapers . The accounts were often sensationalist , demonizing the communist Viet Minh as religious persecutors who committed barbaric atrocities against Catholics . Our Sunday Visitor called the " persecution " in Vietnam " the worst in history " , alleging that the Viet Minh engaged in " child murder and cannibalism " . San Francisco 's Monitor told of a priest whom the Viet Minh " beat with guns until insensible and then buried alive in a ditch " . Newark , Ohio 's The Advocate posted an editorial cartoon titled " Let Our People Go ! " , depicting mobs of Vietnamese refugees attempting to break through a blood @-@ laced fence of barbed wire . Milwaukee 's Catholic Herald Citizen described two priests who had been chained together and " suffered atrocious and endless agony " . Other papers depicted the Viet Minh blowing up churches , torturing children and gunning down elderly Catholics . One paper proclaimed that " the people of Vietnam became a crucified people and their homeland a national Golgotha " . The Catholic media also ran stories about Buddhist refugees who converted , hailing it as proof of their religion 's superiority . 
 = = Social integration = = 
 The mass influx of refugees presented various social issues for South Vietnam . The new arrivals needed to be integrated into society with jobs and housing , as long periods in tents and temporary housing would sap morale and possibly foster pro @-@ communist sympathies . Diem had to devise programs to ease his new citizens into the economic system . 
 Diem appointed Bui Van Luong — a family friend and devout Catholic — as the head of COMIGAL , the government resettlement agency . COMIGAL worked in cooperation with the United States Operations Mission , the non @-@ military wing of the American presence and the Military Assistance Advisory Group . Although COMIGAL was purely dedicated to refugee issues , there was a constant turnover of public servants through their staff , and the benefits of continuity did not materialize . After only a few months in the job , Luong was replaced by Pham Van <unk> on December 7 , 1954 . COMIGAL were supplemented by American Catholic aid agencies and an advisory group from Michigan State University , where Diem had stayed while in self @-@ imposed exile in the early 1950s . There were three phases in the resettlement program . With more than 4 @,@ 000 new arrivals per day , the northerners were housed in Saigon and Vũng Tàu in 42 makeshift reception centers . These consisted of existing schools , vacated French barracks , churches and tent cities on the grounds of Tan Son Nhut Air Base and Phú Thọ Racecourse . These could not be used indefinitely as the grounds needed to be used for their preexisting purpose , and furthermore , such ad hoc areas were vulnerable to outbreaks of fire and disease . 
 The refugees needed buildings such as schools , hospitals , warehouses , places of worship were built for them . As part of the second phase , temporary villages were built and by mid @-@ 1955 , most of the one million refugees were living in rows of temporary housing settlements , mostly near highways leading out of Saigon , in provinces adjacent to the capital . The largest concentration of housing in this second stage was located to the north of the capital . Only a minority could be sent to the fertile Mekong Delta , as the area was already overcrowded . It was also restive due to the presence of militant religious sects , so the most of the military evacuees were sent there . 
 Overcrowding was a serious problem in many of the ad hoc secondary camps set up in the Saigon region , and led to public health issues . The Biên Hòa region on the northeastern outskirts of Saigon was scheduled to have a capacity of 100 @,@ 000 refugees , but this was soon exceeded . In the Ho Nai camp near Bien Hoa , which was supposed to hold only 10 @,@ 000 refugees , more than 41 @,@ 000 were present by the end of 1954 . The area surrounding Thủ <unk> <unk> north of the southern capital had initially been allocated a quota of 20 @,@ 000 even though there was no rice paddies in the area . The area near Tây Ninh was to accommodate 30 @,@ 000 people , although the locals thought that 100 @,@ 000 could fit in . Some large Catholic settlements such as Thủ Đức , Bình <unk> and Gò <unk> on the outskirts of Saigon have now been subsumed by urban sprawl and are now districts of the city . Because of the excessive number of inhabitants , the infrastructure at many camps could not cope and the promises made to the refugees were not kept . American military doctors travelled around the south in groups of three , and because of the paucity of health professionals , saw around 150 – 450 patients per day . They were also hampered by customs law , which only allowed charities to bring medicine into the country without taxation . This forced them to turn to charitable organisations as a conduit , creating another layer of bureaucracy . This was exacerbated by the fact that some corrupt Vietnamese officials pocketed the medical aid . 
 The organisational ability of the government agencies charged with overseeing the integration of the refugees into society was frequently criticised by American officials . In many cases , the individual officials simply made their own decisions and the goal of resettling the northerners without disruption to the existing local economy or social structure was not achieved . In other cases , the northern Catholics formed their own committees and settled and built on areas as they saw fit . By the end of September , the shortage of funds and equipment had eased , but their distribution was not organised or coordinated effectively . At the same time , some Viet Minh cadres who stayed in the south after the partition pretended to be refugees and stirred up trouble inside the camps . Aside from disruption by communists , other non @-@ communist movements such as the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng were strong in areas of central Vietnam , were opponents of Diem and some of them were military personnel . This sometimes caused hindrance in civilian @-@ military cooperation in the resettlement program , as some of Diem 's public servants were suspicious of the military 's reliability as a working partner . 
 At the time , much of the rural <unk> had been abandoned due to war and lay fallow . The Americans pressured Diem to assume control of such lands and distribute it to the new settlers and to allow them to start their new lives and ease the overcrowding in the camps , but no action was taken in 1954 . At the time , there was a severe wastage of personnel due to the placement of refugees in land that was inappropriate to them . Vietnamese officials had resolved to place the settlers in land similar to their northern origins so that they could be productive , but bureaucratic difficulties hampered COMIGAL and no plan was produced . Throughout 1954 , 60 % of the new arrivals identified themselves as having an agrarian background , but only 20 % of the total refugees were placed in arable farming areas , meaning that at least 40 % of the northerners were in areas not appropriate for their skill set . There were also severe problems in finding and then distributing farming equipment to the northerners so that they could get to work and resuscitate the agricultural sector that was hindered by the war . 
 The next objective was to integrate the refugees into South Vietnamese society . At the time , there was a lack of arable land in secure areas . In early 1955 , the Viet Minh still controlled much of the Mekong Delta , while other parts were controlled by the private armies of the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo religious sects . The Bình Xuyên organised crime gang controlled the streets of Saigon , having purchased the operating license for the national police from Emperor Bảo Đại . The new arrivals could not be safely sent to the countryside until the Viet Minh had moved north and Diem had dispersed the sects and gangs . The urban areas were secured when the VNA defeated the Bình Xuyên in the Battle for Saigon in late April and early May . Lansdale managed to bribe many of the Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài military commanders to integrate into Diem 's VNA , but some commanders fought on . It was not until early 1956 that the last Hoa Hao commander , Ba Cụt , was captured in an Army of the Republic of Vietnam campaign by General Dương Văn Minh . This allowed COMIGAL to send expeditions to survey the rural land for settlement . 
 The third phase of the resettlement involved the dispersal of the new arrivals from the temporary villages in regions surrounding the capital and other large cities . The areas where the refugees had initially were over settled , notably Biên Hòa , where the population had doubled during the migration period . In contrast , two thirds of South Vietnamese provinces had taken less than 10 @,@ 000 refugees , and some of these less than 1 @,@ 000 . In the crowded provinces there were fears of social unrest due to a shortage of work . 
 COMIGAL dispatched inspection teams throughout South Vietnam to identify areas that were suitable for accommodating the new arrivals according to their professional skills . This required a search for arable land for farmers , favourable coastal areas for fishing and areas near large population centres for industrially oriented arrivals . Having identified the relevant areas , COMIGAL would set up plans for settlement <unk> , sending proposals to the USOM or the French Technical and Economic Cooperation Bureau to gain approval and funding . The bureaucracy was relatively low , with most applications taking less than a fortnight for finalising paperwork and receiving approval . Each subproject was given a nine @-@ month deadline for completion . 
 When suitable areas were found , groups of refugees usually numbering between one and three thousand were trucked to the site and began creating the new settlement . This involved digging wells , building roads and bridges , clearing forests , bushes and swamps and constructing fishing vessels . Village elections were held to select members for committees that would liaise with COMIGAL on behalf of the new settlement . 
 COMIGAL provided the settlers with agrarian implements , fertilisers and farm animals . By mid @-@ 1957 , 319 villages had been built . Of these , 288 were for farmers and 26 for fishermen . The refugees settled predominantly in the Mekong Delta , where 207 villages were built . The most notable scheme in the area was the Cai San Agricultural Resettlement Project , based along a system of canals near Long Xuyên . Another 50 villages were created further north near the border with North Vietnam , while 62 were built in the central highlands . A 1955 government report claimed that only 2 % of the land in the central highlands , mostly inhabited by indigenous tribes were being used for economic purposes , and it was seen as a key area for exploitation and building settlements to block the advance of communism . The area was seen as an important means of alleviating overcrowding , fuelling rapid economic development , and the government hoped that the presence of ethnic Vietnamese development would prompt the indigenous tribespeople to abandon their hunter @-@ gatherer lifestyle , thus " guiding them on the path to civilization and progress , so that they might join the ranks of the State 's founders and liberators " . In the Central Highlands town of <unk> Ma Thuột , the local sawmill was inundated with lumber to build houses and much of the surrounding forest was cleared for settlements . In total , 92 @,@ 443 housing units were constructed , serviced by 317 and 18 elementary and secondary schools respectively . 38 @,@ 192 hectares of land were cleared and some 2 @.@ 4 million tons of potassium sulfate fertiliser were distributed . At the end of 1957 , Diem dissolved COMIGAL , declaring that its mission had been accomplished . 
 = = Difficulties and criticism = = 
 The program had some loose ends that manifested themselves later . Many refugees were not economically integrated and lived from government handouts . Critics noted that the refugees had become a special interest group that fostered resentment . The COMIGAL officials often decided not to split up refugees belonging to the same village , hoping to maintain social continuity . In some cases , Catholic priests refused to obey government directives to settle in certain areas . Many of the refugees also refused to relocate from the camps on the outskirts of the capital , wanting to live an urban lifestyle , and objecting to Diem 's desire that they help developed inhospitable frontier territory where disease was more common and the economy less developed . On occasions , the reluctance to disperse away from Saigon resulted in protests outside Diem 's residence . Many Catholic villages were effectively transplanted into southern territory . This was efficient in the short run but meant that they would never assimilate into southern society . They had little contact with the Buddhist majority and often held them in contempt , sometimes flying the Vatican flag instead of the national flag . Peter Hansen , an Australian Catholic priest and academic scholar of religion , has added that tensions between northern and southern Catholics were also present , due to issues of regionalism and local traditions . Hansen also said that northern Catholics took a more defensive attitude towards other religions than their southern co @-@ religionists , and were more likely to see non @-@ Catholics as a threat . He further noted that northern Catholics had a more theocratic outlook in that they were more willing to listen to the advice of priests on a wide range of issues , not only spiritual and ecclesiastical matters . These differences and the sense of segregation persist to the current day . 
 Diem , who had a reputation for heavily favouring Catholics , granted his new constituents a disproportionately high number of government and military posts on religious grounds rather than merit . The disproportionate number of northerners who occupied leadership posts also raised tensions among some regional @-@ minded southerners who regarded them as intruders . He continued the French practice of defining Catholicism as a " religion " and Buddhism as an " association " , which restricted their activities . This fostered a social divide between the new arrivals and their compatriots . While on a visit to Saigon in 1955 , the British journalist and novelist Graham Greene reported that Diem 's religious favouritism " may well leave his tolerant country a legacy of anti @-@ Catholicism " . In 1963 , simmering discontent over Diem 's religious bias exploded into mass civil unrest during the Buddhist crisis . After the Buddhist flag was prohibited from public display for the Vesak celebrations commemorating the birth of Gautama Buddha , Diem 's forces opened fire and killed nine protesters . As demonstrations continued through the summer , the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces ransacked pagodas across the country , killing hundreds and jailing thousands of Buddhists . The tension culminated in Diem being overthrown and assassinated in a November coup . 
 The indigenous population in the central highlands complained bitterly about the settlement of ethnic Vietnamese Catholics in their regions . As a result of their discontent with the southern government , communist propagandists in the highlands found it easier to win them over . 
 = Tropical cyclone observation = 
 Tropical cyclone observation has been carried out over the past couple of centuries in various ways . The passage of typhoons , hurricanes , as well as other tropical cyclones have been detected by word of mouth from sailors recently coming to port or by radio transmissions from ships at sea , from sediment deposits in near shore estuaries , to the wiping out of cities near the coastline . Since World War II , advances in technology have included using planes to survey the ocean basins , satellites to monitor the world 's oceans from outer space using a variety of methods , radars to monitor their progress near the coastline , and recently the introduction of unmanned aerial vehicles to penetrate storms . Recent studies have concentrated on studying hurricane impacts lying within rocks or near shore lake sediments , which are branches of a new field known as <unk> . This article details the various methods employed in the creation of the hurricane database , as well as reconstructions necessary for reanalysis of past storms used in projects such as the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis .

 Recent studies of the 18O and 13C isotopes found in stalagmites in Belize show that tropical cyclone events can leave markers that can be separated out on a week @-@ by @-@ week basis . The error rate of this type of <unk> was 1 error in 1 @,@ 200 sampling points . 
 = = = Markers in coral = = = 
 Rocks contain certain isotopes of elements , known as natural tracers , which describe the conditions under which they formed . By studying the calcium carbonate in coral rock , past sea surface temperature and hurricane information can be revealed . Lighter oxygen isotopes ( 18O ) are left behind in coral during periods of very heavy rainfall . Since hurricanes are the main source of extreme rainfall in the tropical oceans , past hurricane events can be dated to the days of their impact on the coral by looking at the increased 18O concentration within the coral .

 Kam Biu @-@ Liu , a professor at Louisiana State University , has been studying sediment lying at the bottom of coastal lakes and marshes in order to study the frequency and intensity of hurricanes over the past 5 @,@ 000 years . Since storm surges sweep coastal sands with them as they progress inland , a layer of sand is left behind in coastal lakes and marshes . Radiocarbon dating is then used to date the layers .

 Before the invention of the telegraph in the early to mid @-@ 19th century , news was as fast as the quickest horse , stage , or ship . Normally , there was no advance warning of a tropical cyclone impact . However , the situation changed in the 19th century as seafaring people and land @-@ based researchers , such as Father Viñes in Cuba , came up with systematic methods of reading the sky 's appearance or the sea state , which could foretell a tropical cyclone 's approach up to a couple days in advance . 
 In China , the abundance of historical documentary records in the form of Fang Zhi ( <unk> local gazettes ) offers an extraordinary opportunity for providing a high @-@ resolution historical dataset for the frequency of typhoon strikes . Kam @-@ <unk> Liu et al . ( 2001 ) reconstructed a 1 @,@ 000 @-@ year time series of typhoon landfalls in the Guangdong Province of southern China since AD 975 and found that on a decadal timescale , the twenty @-@ year interval from AD 1660 to 1680 is the most active period on record , with twenty @-@ eight to thirty @-@ seven typhoon landfalls per decade . The variability in typhoon landfalls in Guangdong mimics that observed in other paleoclimatic proxies ( e.g. , tree rings , ice cores ) from China and the northern hemisphere . Remarkably , the two periods of most frequent typhoon strikes in Guangdong ( AD 1660 @-@ 1680 , 1850 – 1880 ) coincide with two of the coldest and driest periods in northern and central China during the Little Ice Age . 
 = = Surface observations = = 
 = = = Ship reports = = = 
 For centuries , people have sailed the world 's oceans and seas , and for just as long , they have encountered storms . The worst of the cyclones over the open seas likely took those that observed them into the depths of the oceans . However , some did survive to report harrowing tales . Before the invention of the wireless telegraph in 1905 , reports about storms at sea either coincided with their arrival at the coast as ships scrambled into port , or came weeks and months afterwards from remote ports of call . Ship and buoy reports , available since the 1970s , are used in real @-@ time not only for their temperature , pressure , and wind measurements , but also for their sea surface temperature and wave height measurements . 
 Wind reports from ships at sea have become increasingly based on anemometers , and less so on the Beaufort Scale . This is important to note as the Beaufort Scale underestimates winds at higher wind speeds , indicating ship wind observations taken for older storms are likely to <unk> their true value . 
 As Christopher Landsea et al. point out , many tropical cyclones that formed on the open sea and did not affect any coast usually went undetected prior to satellite observation since the 1970s . They estimated an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910 . These <unk> roughly take into account the typical size of tropical cyclones , the density of shipping tracks over the Atlantic basin , and the amount of populated coastline . 
 = = = Land @-@ based observations = = = 
 In the early 20th century , forecasting the track of cyclones was still confined to areas of the greatest surface pressure falls , based upon surface weather observations , and climatology . These methods proved to be the cutting edge of tropical cyclone forecasting through the mid 20th century . Land @-@ based surface observations remain invaluable as a source of real @-@ time information at locations near the coastline and inland . Combined with ship observations and newspapers , they formed the total information network for hurricane detection until radiosondes were introduced in 1941 and reconnaissance aircraft began in 1944 . Land @-@ based observations of pressure and wind can show how quickly a tropical cyclone is decaying as it moves inland . Their rainfall reports show where significant rainfall is occurring , and can be an alert for possible flooding . With the establishment of the ASOS network in the United States during the 1990s , more locations are reporting around the clock than ever before . 
 = = = = Mobile platforms = = = = 
 Since the 1990s , academic researchers have begun to deploy mobile weather stations fortified to withstand hurricane @-@ force winds . The two largest programs are the Florida Coastal Monitoring Program and the Wind Engineering Mobile Instrumented Tower Experiment . During landfall , the NOAA Hurricane Research Division compares and verifies data from reconnaissance aircraft , including wind speed data taken at flight level and from GPS dropwindsondes and stepped @-@ frequency microwave radiometers , to wind speed data transmitted in real time from weather stations erected near or at the coast . The National Hurricane Center uses the data to evaluate conditions at landfall and to verify forecasts .

 = = = Reconnaissance aircraft = = = 
 The idea of aircraft reconnaissance of tropical cyclones first was put forth by Captain W. L. Farnsworth of the Galveston Commercial Association in the early 1930s . Supported by the United States Weather Bureau , it passed both the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives in 1936 . Since 1944 , aircraft have been flying out to sea to find tropical cyclones . Before regular satellite coverage , this was a hit @-@ or @-@ miss affair . Thereafter , aircraft flights into tropical systems became more targeted and precise . Nowadays , a C @-@ 130 is used as a hurricane hunter by the Air Force , while the P @-@ 3 Orion is used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for research projects used to better understand tropical cyclones and improve hurricane forecasts . The implementation of synoptic observation missions by a Gulfstream jet , where dropwindsondes are used to investigate a tropical cyclone 's environment , has led to a 15 @-@ 20 percent reduction in track forecast errors where such missions were present .

 The era of the aerosonde began in 1998 , when the Australian Bureau of Meteorology flew an aerosonde into Tropical Cyclone Tiffany . In 2005 , Hurricane Ophelia became the first Atlantic tropical cyclone where an unmanned aerial vehicle , known as an aerosonde , mission was used for a tropical cyclone . The first typhoon was penetrated by an aerosonde in 2005 as well . Unlike normal reconnaissance flights , the aerosonde stayed near the surface after a 10 @-@ hour flight within the tropical cyclone .

 During World War II , radar technology was developed to detect aircraft . It soon became apparent that large areas became obscured when significant weather was in the area . In 1957 , the National Weather Service established the United States ' first radar network to cover the coastline and act as first warning of an impending tropical cyclone . Upgraded in the 1990s to use doppler technology , radar can provide rainfall estimates , wind estimates , possible locations of tornadoes within a system 's spiral bands , as well as the center location of a tropical cyclone . The United States operates with a network of 158 Doppler Radars across the country .

 Beginning with the launching of TIROS @-@ I in April 1960 , satellites have been used to look for tropical cyclones . The Dvorak technique was developed from early satellite images of tropical cyclones to determine real @-@ time a tropical cyclone 's strength from characteristics seen on satellite imagery . In most tropical cyclone basins , use of the satellite @-@ based Dvorak technique is the primary method used to determine a tropical cyclone 's maximum sustained winds . The extent of banding and difference in temperature between the eye and eyewall is used within the technique to assign a maximum sustained wind and pressure . Since the mid @-@ 1990s , microwave imagery has been able to determine the center of rotation when that center is obscured by mid to high level cloudiness .

 = Eric Lock = 
 Eric Stanley Lock DSO , DFC & Bar ( 19 April 1919 – 3 August 1941 ) was a British Royal Air Force ( RAF ) fighter pilot and flying ace of the Second World War . 
 Born in Shrewsbury in 1919 Lock had his first experience of flying as a teenager . In the late 1930s with war a possibility and the likely event of him being called to arms , Lock decided that he would prefer to fight as an airman . He joined the RAF in 1939 . He completed his training in 1940 and was posted to No. 41 Squadron RAF in time for the Battle of Britain . Lock became the RAF 's most successful Allied pilot during the battle , shooting down 21 German aircraft and sharing in the destruction of one . 
 After the Battle of Britain Lock served on the Channel Front , flying offensive sweeps over France . Lock went on to bring his overall total to 26 aerial victories , one shared destroyed and eight probable in 25 weeks of operational sorties over a one @-@ year period — during which time he was hospitalised for six months . Included in his victory total were 20 German fighter aircraft , 18 of them Messerschmitt Bf 109s . In mid @-@ 1941 Lock was promoted to the rank of Flight Lieutenant . 
 Lock earned the nickname " <unk> Off Lockie " , because of his extremely short stature . Within less than six months of becoming one of the most famous RAF pilots in the country , he crash – landed in the English Channel after his Supermarine Spitfire was damaged by ground – fire . Lock was posted missing in action . He was never seen again . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Eric Stanley Lock was born in 1919 to a farming and quarrying family , whose home was in the rural Shropshire village of Bayston Hill . He was privately educated at Prestfelde Public School , London Road . On his 14th birthday his father treated him to a five @-@ shilling , 15 @-@ minute flight with Sir Alan Cobham 's Air Circus . Unlike most teenagers , Lock was unimpressed by flying and had soon lost interest . At 16 he left school and joined his father 's business . 
 In 1939 he made the decision that if there was going to be a war , he wanted to be a fighter pilot , and so immediately joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve . Within three months Lock had been called up and began flight training . On the outbreak of War in September 1939 , as a trained pilot Lock joined the RAF as a Sergeant Pilot . After further training at No.6 Flying School RAF Little Rissington , he was commissioned as a Pilot Officer ( Service Number <unk> ) and posted to No. 41 Squadron at RAF Catterick , North Yorkshire , flying Spitfires . 
 Lock completed his training in late May 1940 . Officially qualified as a fighter pilot , he was posted to No. 41 Squadron at RAF Catterick as Acting Pilot Officer . Lock spent several weeks with his Squadron before taking two weeks leave pass in July 1940 to marry his girlfriend Peggy Meyers , a former " Miss Shrewsbury " . Lock returned to his unit and soon began combat patrols over the North of England , defending British airspace against Luftflotte 5 ( Air Fleet 5 ) based in Norway . Lock was bored by the patrols as it involved chasing lone enemy raiders without success . 
 = = Second World War = = 
 = = = Battle of Britain = = = 
 The Battle of Britain began in July 1940 with the Luftwaffe making attacks on British shipping in the English Channel and Britain 's East Coast . In August RAF Fighter Command 's bases came under attack as the Germans attempted to establish air superiority over southern England . The battles grew larger in scale , but 41 Squadron , based in the north , were well clear of the main combat zone and saw little action for the first four weeks of the German air offensive . 
 Lock 's frustration ended on 15 August 1940 . On this date the Luftwaffe attempted to stretch Fighter Command by launching a wave of aircraft against targets in northern England where German intelligence believed there to be little opposition . It was in this battle Lock gained his first victory . Climbing at 20 @,@ 000 feet ( 6 @,@ 100 m ) north of Catterick Lock spotted a massed formation of Messerschmitt Bf 110s and Junkers Ju 88s . The Squadron was ordered into line @-@ astern formation and made an attack . In the first attack Lock followed his Section Leader . In the second he had an opportunity to fire at a Bf 110 heavy fighter . After two short bursts the starboard engine caught fire . Following the enemy fighter down to 10 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) , Lock fired into the fuselage and set the port engine on fire . The machine @-@ gunner ceased firing and Lock left it at 5 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) . Lock was going to claim only a probable , but another No. 41 pilot saw it crash into Seaham Harbour and confirmed his victory . Lock soon attacked the Ju 88s , downing one of their number . 
 In light of Fighter Command 's need units in the south of the country , No. 41 Squadron was redeployed to RAF Hornchurch in Essex on 3 September 1940 . On 5 September , Lock flew as Red 2 , positioned behind and protecting the Squadron 's Leader . He shot down two Heinkel He 111s over the Thames Estuary . One of his victims crashed into a river , the other caught fire and its undercarriage fell down . Lock followed it down . He quickly realised his mistake — reducing height to pursue a damaged enemy put a pilot at risk from enemy fighters — but it was too late . A Messerschmitt Bf 109 attacked him and he sustained damage to his Spitfire and a wound to his leg . Lock immediately zoom @-@ climbed . The Bf 109 attempted to follow but the pilot stalled and fell away . Lock reversed direction and dived . Waiting for the German fighter to come out of its dive he fired several short bursts and it exploded . Looking around he saw the second He 111 land in the English Channel , about ten miles from the first . Lock circled above the He 111 and noticing a boat he alerted the boat to its presence by flying over it and led the vessel to the crash site . As he left the scene he saw the crew surrendering to the occupants of the boat . On the way home he saw his first victim in the river , with a dingy nearby . A further Bf 109 was claimed destroyed on that date . 
 The following day , despite pain from his leg and against medical advice , Lock claimed his seventh victory , a Ju 88 off Dover at 09 : 00 . On 9 September he claimed two Bf 109s destroyed over Kent and he followed the success with two victories — over a Ju 88 and Bf 110 — on 11 September 1940 . The victory brought his tally to nine enemy aircraft destroyed , eight of them in less than seven days . He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross ( DFC ) . The award was gazetted on 1 October 1940 with a citation reading : 
 Lock continued to shoot enemy aircraft down regularly . On 14 September he recorded two victories over Bf 109s and the following day shared in the destruction of a Dornier Do 17 before destroying a Bf 109 on 15 September 1940 — the Battle of Britain Day — over Clacton @-@ on @-@ Sea . Two rest days followed . On 18 September he claimed a Bf 109 probably destroyed on his first patrol then another destroyed plus one probably destroyed in the afternoon over Gravesend . 
 On 20 September he filed a curious report that saw him attack three " Heinkel He 113s " , shooting down one and forcing the others to flee back to France . During that sortie he sighted a Henschel Hs 126 which he pursued across the English Channel before finally downing it over the German gun batteries at Boulogne @-@ sur @-@ Mer . Upon landing he was told by his commanding officer that he had been awarded a Medal bar to his DFC for 15 victories in 16 days . Published on 22 October 1940 , the citation read : 
 No. 41 Squadron 's pilots were placed on four weeks ' rotation rest following the intense period of operational sorties , returning to RAF Hornchurch in early October 1940 . Lock immediately commenced where he had left off . On 5 October he was credited with another Bf 109 with two probables over Kent ; on 9 October another Bf 109 was claimed 10 miles from Dover and a probable followed seconds later . Off Dungeness he dispatched yet another Bf 109 on 11 October then on 20 October 1940 shot down a Bf 109 directly above RAF Biggin Hill . This victory brought his total to 20 , making Lock a ' Quadruple Ace ' . On 25 October Lock destroyed a Bf 109 to bring his tally to 21 aerial victories . The Battle of Britain ended on 31 October 1940 and Lock , with 21 enemy aircraft destroyed , was the most successful Allied ace of the campaign .

 On 8 November 1940 his Spitfire was badly damaged during a skirmish with several Bf 109s over Beachy Head in East Sussex . The Spitfire was so badly damaged that Lock crash @-@ landed in a ploughed field , but was able to walk away . On 17 November 1940 No. 41 Squadron attacked a formation of 70 Bf 109s that were top cover for a bomber raid on London . After shooting down one Bf 109 , and setting another on fire , Lock 's Spitfire was hit by a volley of cannon shells , which severely injured Lock 's right arm and both legs . The rounds also knocked the throttle permanently open by severing the control lever . The open throttle enabled the Spitfire to accelerate swiftly to 400 mph ( 640 km / h ) , leaving the Bf 109s in his wake , without Lock having to attempt to operate it with his injured right arm . At 20 @,@ 000 feet ( 6 @,@ 100 m ) he began to descend and with little control and no means of slowing the fighter down , he could not execute a safe landing . Too badly injured to parachute to safety Lock was in a perilous situation . After losing height to 2 @,@ 000 feet ( 610 m ) , Lock switched the engine off and found a suitable crash site near RAF Martlesham Heath , Suffolk , into which he glided the stricken fighter for a " wheels down " landing . 
 Lying in the aircraft for some two hours , he was found by two patrolling British Army soldiers and carried two miles ( 3 km ) on an improvised stretcher made of their Enfield rifles and Army issue winter coats — made after instruction from Lock . By this point , Lock had lost so much blood that he was unconscious , and so unable to feel the additional pain of being dropped three times , once into a dyke of water . After being transferred to the Princess Mary ’ s Hospital at RAF Halton , he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order ( DSO ) on 17 December 1940 , the citation read : 
 Lock underwent fifteen separate operations over the following three months to remove shrapnel and other metal fragments from his wounds . For the following three months he remained at Halton recuperating from his injuries , leaving on only one occasion to travel on crutches and in full uniform to Buckingham Palace , where King George VI presented him with his DSO , DFC and Bar . He was also Mentioned in Despatches in March 1941 . 
 = = = Last battles and death = = = 
 Lock spent several months in hospital . He stayed at the Royal Masonic Hospital with Richard Hillary , another Battle of Britain ace . They were operated on by Archibald <unk> a famous Surgeon . While there , Hillary wrote his memoirs The Last Enemy , before his death in a flying accident on 8 January 1943 . He remembered Lock having <unk> treatment and being " vociferous " . The nurses wore anti @-@ infection masks and gloves , and Eric , " with an <unk> grin " would curse them for it " from dawn till dusk " . 
 In June 1941 he received notification that he had been promoted to Flying Officer and was requested to report back for immediate flying duty with 41 Squadron . Four weeks later he was promoted again to Flight Lieutenant and posted to No. 611 Squadron in command of B Flight . In July 1941 he gained three victories against Bf 109s flying offensive sweeps over France — on 6 July at 15 : 00 , on 8 July at 06 : 30 and 11 : 00 on 14 July near Le Touquet . 
 On 3 August 1941 , Lock was returning from a fighter " Rhubarb " when he spotted a column of German troops and vehicles on a road near the Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais . Signalling the attack to his wingman , Lock was seen to peel off from the formation and prepare for the ground strafing attack — the last time he was seen . He is believed to have been shot down by ground – fire . Neither his body or his Spitfire Mk V , <unk> , have ever been found , despite a thorough search of the area in the years following the war by both the RAF and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission . 
 Lock was the first of three successful RAF aces who were shot down during this period : Douglas Bader was shot down in error and taken prisoner on 9 August 1941 ; Robert Stanford Tuck 's Spitfire was hit by enemy ground @-@ based flak near Boulogne @-@ sur @-@ Mer on 28 January 1942 and he was forced to crash land and taken prisoner . In July 1942 , Paddy Finucane would be lost in similar circumstances to Lock . 
 It has been suggested by writer Dilip <unk> that Lock was shot down by the German ace Oberleutnant Johann Schmid from Jagdgeschwader 26 near Calais since he was the only German pilot to make a claim .

 = Courageous @-@ class battlecruiser = 
 The Courageous class consisted of three battlecruisers known as " large light cruisers " built for the Royal Navy during World War I. The class was nominally designed to support the Baltic Project , a plan by Admiral of the Fleet Lord Fisher that was intended to land troops on the German Baltic Coast . Ships of this class were fast but very lightly armoured , with only a few heavy guns . They were given a shallow draught , in part to allow them to operate in the shallow waters of the Baltic but also reflecting experience gained earlier in the war . To maximize their speed , the Courageous @-@ class battlecruisers were the first capital ships of the Royal Navy to use geared steam turbines and small @-@ tube boilers . 
 The first two ships , Courageous and Glorious , were commissioned in 1917 and spent the war patrolling the North Sea . They participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in November 1917 and were present when the High Seas Fleet surrendered a year later . Their half @-@ sister Furious was designed with a pair of 18 @-@ inch ( 457 mm ) guns , the largest guns ever fitted on a ship of the Royal Navy , but was modified during construction to take a flying @-@ off deck and hangar in lieu of her forward turret and barbette . After some patrols in the North Sea , her rear turret was removed and another flight deck added . Her aircraft attacked the Zeppelin sheds during the Tondern raid in July 1918 . 
 All three ships were laid up after the war , but were rebuilt as aircraft carriers during the 1920s . Glorious and Courageous were sunk early in World War II and Furious was sold for scrap in 1948 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The first two Courageous @-@ class battlecruisers were designed in 1915 to meet a set of requirements laid down by the First Sea Lord , Admiral Fisher , with his Baltic Project in mind . They were to be large enough to ensure that they could maintain their speed in heavy weather , have a powerful armament and a speed of at least 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) to allow them to outrun enemy light cruisers . Their protection was to be light for a cruiser , with 3 inches ( 76 mm ) of armour between the waterline and the forecastle deck , anti @-@ torpedo bulges amidships and the machinery as far inboard as possible , protected by triple torpedo bulkheads . Shallow draught was of the utmost importance and all other factors were to be subordinated to this . The Director of Naval Construction ( DNC ) , Sir Eustace Tennyson @-@ d 'Eyncourt , responded on 23 February 1915 with a smaller version of the Renown @-@ class battlecruisers with one less gun turret and reduced armour protection . The Chancellor of the Exchequer had forbidden any further construction of ships larger than light cruisers in 1915 , so Fisher designated the ships as large light cruisers to evade this prohibition . If this restriction had not been in place , the ships would have been built as improved versions of the preceding Renown class . The two ships were laid down a few months later under a veil of secrecy , so they became known in the Royal Navy as " Lord Fisher 's hush @-@ hush cruisers " and their odd design also earned them the nickname of the Outrageous class . 
 Their half @-@ sister Furious was designed a few months later to meet a revised requirement specifying an armament of two BL 18 @-@ inch Mk I guns , the largest guns ever fitted on a Royal Navy ship , in single turrets with the ability to use twin 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) gun turrets if the 18 @-@ inch guns were unsatisfactory . Gunnery experts criticized this decision because the long time between salvoes would make spotting corrections useless and reduce the rate of fire and thus the probability of a direct hit . Her secondary armament was upgraded to BL 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch Mk I guns , rather than the 4 @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) guns used by the first two ships , to compensate for the weakness of the two main guns against fast @-@ moving targets like destroyers . Her displacement and beam were increased over that of her half @-@ sisters with slightly less draught . 
 The Baltic Project was only one justification for the ships . Admiral Fisher wrote in a letter to the DNC on 16 March 1915 : " I 've told the First Lord that the more that I consider the qualities of your design of the Big Light Battle Cruisers , the more that I am impressed by its exceeding excellence and simplicity — all the three vital requisites of <unk> , speed and draught so well balanced ! " In fact they could be considered the epitome of Fisher 's belief in the paramount importance of speed over everything else . Fisher 's adherence to this principle is highlighted in a letter he wrote to Churchill concerning the battleships of the 1912 – 13 Naval Estimates . In the letter , dated April 1912 , Fisher stated : " There must be sacrifice of armour ... There must be further VERY GREAT <unk> IN <unk> ... your speed must vastly exceed [ that of ] your possible enemy ! " 
 Fisher 's desire for a shallow draught was not merely based on the need to allow for inshore operations ; ships tended to operate closer to deep load than anticipated and were often found lacking in freeboard , reserve buoyancy and safety against underwater attack . This experience led the DNC to reconsider the proportions of the hull to rectify the problems identified thus far . The Courageous @-@ class ships were the first products of that re @-@ evaluation . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 The Courageous @-@ class ships had an overall length of 786 feet 9 inches ( 239 @.@ 8 m ) , a beam of 81 feet ( 24 @.@ 7 m ) , and a draught of 25 feet 10 inches ( 7 @.@ 9 m ) at deep load . They displaced 19 @,@ 180 long tons ( 19 @,@ 490 t ) normally and 22 @,@ 560 long tons ( 22 @,@ 922 t ) at deep load . They had a metacentric height of 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) at deep load and a complete double bottom . 
 Their half @-@ sister Furious was the same length , but had a beam of 88 feet ( 26 @.@ 8 m ) and a draught of 24 feet 11 inches ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) at deep load . She displaced 19 @,@ 513 long tons ( 19 @,@ 826 t ) at load and 22 @,@ 890 long tons ( 23 @,@ 257 t ) at deep load . She had a metacentric height of 5 @.@ 33 feet ( 1 @.@ 6 m ) at deep load . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 To save weight and space the Courageous @-@ class ships were the first large warships in the Royal Navy to have geared steam turbines and small @-@ tube boilers despite the latter 's significantly heavier maintenance requirements . Furthermore , to save design time , the turbine installation used in the light cruiser Champion , the navy 's first cruiser with geared turbines , was simply doubled . The Parsons turbines were arranged in two engine rooms and each of the turbines drove one of the four propeller shafts . Furious 's propellers were 11 feet 6 inches ( 3 @.@ 5 m ) in diameter . The turbines were powered by eighteen Yarrow boilers equally divided among three boiler rooms . They were designed to produce a total of 90 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 67 @,@ 113 kW ) at a working pressure of 235 psi ( 1 @,@ 620 kPa ; 17 kgf / cm2 ) , but achieved slightly more than that during Glorious 's trials , although she did not reach her designed speed of 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) . 
 They were designed to normally carry 750 long tons ( 762 t ) of fuel oil , but could carry a maximum of 3 @,@ 160 long tons ( 3 @,@ 211 t ) . At full capacity , they could steam for an estimated 6 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 110 km ; 6 @,@ 900 mi ) at a speed of 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The Courageous @-@ class ships mounted four BL 15 @-@ inch Mark I guns in two twin hydraulically powered Mark I * turrets , one each fore ( designated the ' A ' turrets ) and aft ( the ' Y ' turrets ) . These turrets were originally intended for a Revenge @-@ class battleship that was canceled shortly after the war began . The guns could be depressed to − 3 ° and elevated to 20 ° ; they could be loaded at any angle up to 20 ° , although loading at high angles tended to slow the gun 's return to battery ( firing position ) . The ships carried 120 shells per gun . They fired 1 @,@ 910 @-@ pound ( 866 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 575 ft / s ( 785 m / s ) ; this provided a maximum range of 23 @,@ 734 yd ( 21 @,@ 702 m ) with armour @-@ piercing shells . 
 The Courageous @-@ class ships were designed with 18 BL 4 @-@ inch Mark IX guns , fitted in six triple mounts . These were manually powered and quite cumbersome in use as they required a crew of thirty @-@ two men to load and train the guns . The gun 's rate of fire was only 10 to 12 rounds per minute as the loaders kept getting in each other 's way . They had a maximum depression of − 10 ° and a maximum elevation of 30 ° . They fired a 22 @-@ pound ( 10 @.@ 0 kg ) high explosive shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 625 ft / s ( 800 m / s ) . At maximum elevation the guns had a maximum range of 13 @,@ 500 yards ( 12 @,@ 344 m ) . The ships carried 120 rounds for each gun . 
 Each ship mounted a pair of QF 3 inch 20 cwt anti @-@ aircraft guns on single high @-@ angle Mark II mountings . These were mounted abreast the mainmast in the Courageous @-@ class ships and before the funnel on Furious . The gun had a maximum depression of 10 ° and a maximum elevation of 90 ° . It fired a 12 @.@ 5 @-@ pound ( 5 @.@ 7 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 500 ft / s ( 760 m / s ) at a rate of fire of 12 – 14 rounds per minute . They had a maximum effective ceiling of 23 @,@ 500 ft ( 7 @,@ 200 m ) . All three ships carried ten torpedoes and mounted two 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) submerged side @-@ loading torpedo tubes fitted near ' A ' turret . They were loaded and traversed by hydraulic power , but fired by compressed air . 
 The 18 @-@ inch BL Mark I gun carried by Furious was derived from the 15 @-@ inch Mark I gun used in her half @-@ sisters . It was intended to be mounted in two single @-@ gun turrets derived from the twin @-@ gun 15 @-@ inch Mark I / N turret , and her barbettes were designed to accommodate either turret in case problems arose with the 18 @-@ inch gun 's development , but only one turret was actually fitted . The gun could depress to − 3 ° and elevate to a maximum of 30 ° . It fired a 3 @,@ 320 @-@ pound ( 1 @,@ 510 kg ) , 4 crh armour @-@ piercing , capped shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 270 ft / s ( 690 m / s ) to a distance of 28 @,@ 900 yards ( 26 @,@ 400 m ) . It could fire one round per minute and the ship carried sixty rounds of ammunition . The turret 's revolving mass was 826 long tons ( 839 t ) , only slightly more than the 810 long tons ( 823 t ) of its predecessor . 
 Furious 's secondary armament consisted of 11 BL 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch Mk I guns . The guns had a maximum elevation of 25 ° on their pivot mounts . They fired 82 @-@ pound ( 37 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 790 ft / s ( 850 m / s ) at a rate of 12 rounds per minute . Their maximum range was 16 @,@ 000 yd ( 15 @,@ 000 m ) at 25 ° elevation . 
 = = = Fire control = = = 
 The main guns of the Courageous @-@ class ships could be controlled from either of the two fire @-@ control directors . The primary director was mounted above the conning tower in an armoured hood and the other was in the fore @-@ top on the foremast . The secondary armament was also director @-@ controlled . Each turret was provided with a 15 @-@ foot rangefinder in an armoured housing on the turret roof . The fore @-@ top was equipped with a 9 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) rangefinder as was the torpedo control tower above the rear superstructure . The anti @-@ aircraft guns were controlled by a simple 2 @-@ metre ( 6 ft 7 in ) rangefinder mounted on the aft superstructure . 
 = = = Protection = = = 
 Unlike on other British battlecruisers , the bulk of the armour of the Courageous @-@ class ships was made from high @-@ tensile steel , a type of steel used structurally in other ships . Their waterline belt consisted of 2 inches ( 51 mm ) covered by a 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) skin . It ran from barbette to barbette with a one @-@ inch extension forward to the two @-@ inch forward bulkhead well short of the bow . The belt had a height of 23 feet ( 7 @.@ 0 m ) , of which 18 inches ( 0 @.@ 5 m ) was below the designed waterline . From the forward barbette a three @-@ inch bulkhead extended out to the ship 's side between the upper and lower decks and a comparable bulkhead was in place at the rear barbette as well . Four decks were armoured with thicknesses varying from .75 to 3 inches ( 19 to 76 mm ) , with the greatest thicknesses over the magazines and the steering gear . After the loss of three battlecruisers to magazine explosions during the Battle of Jutland , 110 long tons ( 112 t ) of extra protection was added to the deck around the magazines . 
 The turrets , barbettes and conning tower were made from Krupp cemented armour . The turret faces were 9 inches ( 229 mm ) thick while their sides ranged from 7 to 9 inches ( 178 to 229 mm ) in thickness and the roof was 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 114 mm ) thick . The barbettes had a maximum thickness of 6 to 7 inches ( 152 to 178 mm ) above the main deck , but reduced in thickness to 3 to 4 inches ( 76 to 102 mm ) between the lower and main decks . The conning tower armour was 10 inches ( 254 mm ) thick and it had a three @-@ inch roof . The primary fire @-@ control director atop the conning tower was protected by an armoured hood . The face of the hood was six inches thick , its sides were two inches thick and its roof was protected by three inches of armour . A communications tube with three @-@ inch sides ran from the conning tower down to the lower conning position on the main deck . The torpedo bulkheads were increased during building from .75 inches ( 19 mm ) to 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 mm ) in thickness . 
 All three ships were fitted with a shallow anti @-@ torpedo bulge integral to the hull which was intended to explode the torpedo before it hit the hull proper and vent the underwater explosion to the surface rather than into the ship . However , later testing proved that it was not deep enough to accomplish its task as it lacked the layers of empty and full compartments that were necessary to absorb the force of the explosion .

 During her sea trials in November 1916 off the River Tyne , Courageous sustained structural damage while running at full speed in a rough head sea . The forecastle deck was deeply buckled in three places between the breakwater and the forward turret . In addition , the side plating was visibly buckled between the forecastle and upper decks . Water had entered the submerged torpedo room and rivets had sheared in the vertical flange of the angle iron securing the deck armour in place . The exact cause remains uncertain , but Courageous received 130 long tons ( 132 t ) of stiffening in response ; Glorious did not receive her stiffening until 1918 . Courageous also was temporarily fitted as a minelayer in April 1917 , but never actually laid any mines . In mid @-@ 1917 both ships received a dozen torpedo tubes in pairs : one mount on each side of the mainmast on the upper deck and two mounts on each side of the rear turret on the quarterdeck . Courageous and Glorious served together throughout the war . Both ships were initially assigned to the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron and later reconstituted the 1st Cruiser Squadron ( CS ) . 
 Even as she was being built , Furious was modified with a large hangar capable of housing ten aircraft on her forecastle replacing the forward turret . A 160 @-@ foot ( 49 m ) flight deck was built along its roof . Aircraft were flown off and , less successfully , landed on this deck . Although the aft turret was fitted and the gun trialled , it was not long before Furious returned to her builders for further modifications . In November 1917 the rear turret was replaced by a 300 @-@ foot ( 91 m ) deck for landing aircraft over another hangar . Her funnel and superstructure remained intact , with a narrow strip of decking around them to connect the fore and aft flight decks . Turbulence from the funnel and superstructure was severe enough that only three landing attempts were successful before further attempts were forbidden . Her 18 @-@ inch guns were reused on the Lord Clive @-@ class monitors General Wolfe and Lord Clive during the war . 
 All three ships were in the 1st CS of which Courageous was flagship when the Admiralty received word of German ship movements on 16 October 1917 , possibly indicating some sort of raid . Admiral Beatty , commander of the Grand Fleet , ordered most of his light cruisers and destroyers to sea in an effort to locate the enemy ships . Furious was detached from the 1st CS and ordered to sweep along the 56th parallel as far as 4 ° East and to return before dark . The other two ships were not initially ordered to sea , but were sent to reinforce the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron patrolling the central part of the North Sea later that day . Two German Brummer @-@ class light cruisers managed to slip through the gaps in the British patrols and destroyed a convoy headed to Scandinavia during the morning of 17 October , but no word was received of the engagement until that afternoon . The 1st CS was ordered to attempt to intercept the German ships , but they proved to be too fast and the British ships were unsuccessful . 
 = = = Second Battle of Heligoland Bight = = = 
 Over the course of 1917 the Admiralty was becoming more concerned about German efforts in the North Sea to sweep paths through the British @-@ laid minefields intended to restrict the actions of the High Seas Fleet and German submarines . A preliminary raid on German minesweeping forces on 31 October by light forces destroyed ten small ships and the Admiralty decided on a larger operation to destroy the minesweepers and their escorting light cruisers . Based on intelligence reports the Admiralty decided on 17 November 1917 to allocate two light cruiser squadrons , the 1st CS covered by the reinforced 1st Battlecruiser Squadron and , more distantly , the battleships of the 1st Battle Squadron to the operation . 
 The German ships , four light cruisers of II Scouting Force , eight destroyers , three divisions of minesweepers , eight Sperrbrechers ( cork @-@ filled trawlers , used to detonate mines without sinking ) and two trawlers to mark the swept route , were spotted at 7 : 30 a.m. , silhouetted by the rising sun . Courageous and the light cruiser Cardiff opened fire with their forward guns seven minutes later . The Germans responded by laying an effective smoke screen . The British continued in pursuit , but lost track of most of the smaller ships in the smoke and concentrated fire on the light cruisers as opportunity permitted . One 15 @-@ inch hit was made on a gun shield of SMS Pillau , but it did not affect her speed . At 8 : 33 the left @-@ hand gun in Glorious 's forward turret was wrecked when a shell detonated inside the gun barrel . At 9 : 30 the 1st CS broke off their pursuit so they would not enter a minefield marked on their maps ; the ships turned south , playing no further role in the battle . The German ships had too much of a lead to be caught by the British ships before they had to turn to avoid the minefield . 
 Both ships had taken minor damage from their own muzzle blasts , and Glorious required five days of repairs . Courageous fired 92 rounds of 15 @-@ inch while Glorious fired 57 , scoring only the single hit on Pillau between them . They also fired 180 and 213 four @-@ inch shells respectively . Courageous 's mine fittings were removed after the battle and both ships received flying @-@ off platforms on top of their turrets in 1918 . A Sopwith Camel was carried on the rear turret and a Sopwith 1 ½ Strutter on the forward turret . 
 Furious was recommissioned on 15 March 1918 and her embarked aircraft were used on anti @-@ Zeppelin patrols in the North Sea after May . In July 1918 she flew off seven Sopwith Camels which participated in the Tondern raid , attacking the Zeppelin sheds at Tondern with moderate success . All three ships were present at the surrender of the German fleet on 21 November 1918 .

 Courageous was reduced to reserve at Rosyth on 1 February 1919 before being assigned to the Gunnery School at Devonport the following year as a turret drill ship . She became flagship of the Rear @-@ Admiral Commanding the Reserve at Devonport in March 1920 . Glorious was also reduced to reserve at Rosyth on 1 February and served as a turret @-@ drill ship , but succeeded her sister as flagship between 1921 and 1922 . Furious was placed in reserve 21 November 1919 before beginning reconstruction as an aircraft carrier in 1921 . 
 The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 required the signatory nations to severely curtail their plans for new warships and scrap many existing warships to meet its tonnage limits . Up to 66 @,@ 000 long tons ( 67 @,@ 000 t ) of existing ships , however , could be converted into aircraft carriers , and the Royal Navy chose to convert the Courageous @-@ class ships because of their high speed . Each ship was reconstructed with a full @-@ length flight deck during the 1920s . Their 15 @-@ inch turrets were placed into storage and later reused during World War II for HMS Vanguard , the Royal Navy 's last battleship . 
 As the first large , or " fleet " , carrier completed by the Royal Navy , Furious was extensively used to evaluate aircraft handling and landing procedures , including the first ever carrier night @-@ landing in 1926 . Courageous became the first warship lost by the Royal Navy in World War II when she was torpedoed in September 1939 . Glorious unsuccessfully hunted the Admiral Graf Spee in the Indian Ocean in 1939 . She participated in the Norwegian Campaign in 1940 , but was sunk by the German battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau on 8 June 1940 in the North Sea . Furious spent the first months of the war hunting for German raiders and escorting convoys before she began to support British forces in Norway . She spent most of 1940 in Norwegian waters making attacks on German installations and shipping , and most of 1941 ferrying aircraft to West Africa , Gibraltar and Malta before refitting in the United States . She ferried aircraft to Malta during 1942 and provided air support to British forces during Operation Torch . Furious spent most of 1943 training with the Home Fleet , but made numerous air strikes against the German battleship Tirpitz and other targets in Norway in 1944 . She was worn out by late 1944 and was reduced to reserve in September before being decommissioned the following year . Furious was sold in 1948 for scrap .

 " Born This Way " is a song by American singer Lady Gaga , and the lead single from her second studio album of the same name . Written by Gaga and Jeppe Laursen , who produced along with Fernando Garibay and DJ White Shadow , it was developed while Gaga was on the road with The Monster Ball Tour . Inspired by the 1990s empowering music for women and the gay community , Gaga explained that " Born This Way " was her freedom song . She sang part of the chorus at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards in 2010 and announced the song as the lead single from the album . The single was released on February 11 , 2011 . 
 The song is backed by rumbling synth sounds , a humming bass and additional chorus percussion , with sole organ toward the end . The lyrics discuss the self @-@ empowerment of minorities including the LGBT community as well as racial minorities , referring to " cholas " and " orients " , which drew criticism from Latino and Asian communities . Critics positively reviewed the song , calling it a " club @-@ ready anthem " , though it faced criticism for having similarities with Madonna 's 1989 single " Express Yourself " . The song reached number one in over 25 countries and was her third single to top the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and the 1,000th song in that chart 's history ( since 1958 ) to reach number one . " Born This Way " has sold 8 @.@ 2 million copies worldwide , becoming one of the best @-@ selling singles of all time . 
 Nick Knight directed the accompanying music video , which was inspired by painters like Salvador Dalí and Francis Bacon and their surrealistic images . Gaga is depicted as giving birth to a new race during a prologue . A series of dance sequences later , the video concludes with the view of a city populated by this race . Critics noted cultural references to the work of Madonna , Michael Jackson , Björk , late fashion designer Alexander McQueen , as well as to Greek mythology and surrealism . 
 Gaga performed the song at the 53rd Grammy Awards after coming out of an incubating vessel . It was also performed during the last leg of The Monster Ball Tour and in television shows such as Saturday Night Live , Dick Clark 's New Year 's Rockin ' Eve and Good Morning America . The song was treated with different remixes , including a " Country Road " version recorded by Gaga herself and another by Indian production duo Salim @-@ Sulaiman . Alice Cooper , Madonna , Katy Perry , Maria Aragon , and the cast of the TV series Glee have covered the song .

 In 2010 , Lady Gaga was touring for her second world tour , The Monster Ball . At that time she started developing ideas for her second studio album , Born This Way . The first song written and recorded for the album was the title track itself which she wrote in Liverpool and Manchester , England , described by Gaga as a " magical message " song . She wrote it in ten minutes and compared the process to an Immaculate Conception . White Shadow , one of the producers of the track , credited Gaga for coming up with the idea and the theme behind the song . " We recorded it around the world , on the road , in whatever was available . It sounds like it reads , but not like you think until you hear it , " he added . Gaga wanted to record her own freedom song , and explained with Billboard her inspiration behind the song : 
 " I want to write my this @-@ is @-@ who @-@ the @-@ fuck @-@ I @-@ am anthem , but I don 't want it to be hidden in poetic wizardry and metaphors . I want it to be an attack , an assault on the issue because I think , especially in today 's music , everything gets kind of washy sometimes and the message gets hidden in the lyrical play . <unk> back to the early ' 90s , when Madonna , En Vogue , Whitney Houston and TLC were making very empowering music for women and the gay community and all kind of disenfranchised communities , the lyrics and the melodies were very poignant and very gospel and very spiritual and I said , ' That 's the kind of record I need to make . That 's the record that 's going to shake up the industry . ' It 's not about the track . It 's not about the production . It 's about the song . Anyone could sing ' Born This Way ' . It could 've been anyone . " 
 On the 43rd episode of her web video series , Transmission Gagavision , Gaga told the interviewer that the greatest challenge she faced while writing " Born This Way " was how she could leave her insecurities behind her , and become confident . " ' Born This Way ' is who I am . An artist in a constant state of half @-@ fantasy / half @-@ reality at all times , " she added .

 On February 8 , 2011 , Gaga tweeted the words " Trois Jours " ( " Three Days " ) , along with a picture of the official single artwork , via TwitPic . Gaga is shown topless in the black @-@ and @-@ white cover art and displays the tattoos on her back . Her hair is air @-@ blown and she wears heavy make @-@ up while sharp edges protrude from her face and shoulders . The artwork was described by Charlie <unk> from The Hollywood Reporter as harkening back to the classic record covers from the 1980s . He compared it to the artworks by bands like Missing Persons , Roxy Music and Duran Duran . Gordon Smart from The Sun also felt that the " stark black and white image " had a glossy eighties air about it . Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly gave a positive review of the cover art , feeling that Gaga looked almost " animalistic " in the picture , and her flowing hair made her look like a creature from the African jungle . She also added that the artwork was " totally and completely fierce " . Archana Ram from the same publication found similarities between the " Born This Way " cover art and Kylie Minogue 's cover art for her 2007 single " 2 Hearts " . Nicole Eggenberger from OK ! described the artwork as a perfect balance between the singer 's " wild side " and her " glamorous " looks . Leah Collins from Dose believed that the extreme make @-@ up and tattoos were an ironic play on the title of the song . 
 Gaga had sung a few lines from the song while accepting the 2010 MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year , for " Bad Romance " . Given as a Christmas gift to her fans , Gaga announced , via Twitter , the release dates of the album and the lead single at the stroke of midnight on New Year 's Day , 2011 . The single was dated to be released on February 13 , 2011 , while the album on May 23 , 2011 . Supplementing this announcement came a black @-@ and @-@ white photograph in which Gaga , according to Jocelyn Vena from MTV , is " nude from the waist down , with her hair blowing about , and sporting a jacket with ' Born This Way ' emblazoned in what looks like bedazzled jewels . " In late January 2011 , Gaga released the lyrics of the song , before announcing that she planned to release the single two days prior to its stipulated date . Hence the song was premiered on radio stations worldwide at 6 a.m. EST on February 11 , 2011 , and was released for digital download from online retailers at 9 a.m. EST the same day .

 " Born This Way " was written by Gaga and Jeppe Laursen ( formerly of the band Junior Senior ) , and produced with Paul Blair ( a.k.a. DJ White Shadow ) and Fernando Garibay , while it was mixed at Abbey Road Studios in London and Germano Studios in New York . The club @-@ beat influenced disco anthem begins with Gaga 's voice uttering the line " It doesn 't matter if you love him or capital H @-@ I @-@ M " on a loop , backed by a rumbling synth sound and a humming bass . As the synths change into a beat , Gaga belts out the song 's first verse , followed by the bass dropping off and the percussion @-@ backed chorus , " I 'm beautiful in my way , ' cause God makes no mistakes ; I 'm on the right track , baby , I was born this way " , which Jocelyn Vena from MTV likened as being " meant to be heard in a big space . It 's fast and hard @-@ hitting . " After the chorus she chants the line " Don 't be a drag , Just be a queen " a number of times on top of handclaps , before moving to the second verse . After the second chorus an interlude follows , where Gaga chants the names of various communities . Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine felt that the interlude is a mixture of the music from American television show , Glee , and the song " There But For the Grace of God Go I " by Machine . The music fades out for a moment as Gaga sings a capella , before the addition of an organ and Gaga closes the song . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony / ATV Music Publishing , " Born This Way " is written in the time signature of common time , with a moderate dance beat tempo of 124 beats per minute . It is composed in the key of B major as Gaga 's voice spans the tonal nodes of F ♯ 3 to C ♯ 5 . " Born This Way " follows a chord progression of F ♯ 5 – F ♯ – E – B – F ♯ in the chorus . 
 The lyrics during the verses talk about empowerment , while the chorus talks about making no apologies and accepting one as themselves . It features the names of LGBT and other minority communities , which was due to the support Gaga had received from the community over the years . She also explained that since The Fame and The Fame Monster did not directly address those communities , " Born This Way " was her chance to create something that not only supported her political and social beliefs , but also empowered her to artistically say , " ' I 'm not being safe with this record . ' I 'm not trying to gain new fans . I love the fans I already have , and this is for them . " 
 After the early release of the lyrics , it had garnered criticism from some Asian and Hispanic communities , including Latino groups <unk> and Chicanos Unidos Arizona , claiming that the usage of the terms " chola " and " orient " was offensive and derogatory . In response to the lyrics , Robert Paul Reyes of <unk> stated that while he agreed with its pro @-@ gay stance , he questioned the use of the term " chola " , asking , " Are Latinos supposed to be grateful that a white superstar , born of privilege , included a racist shout out to our community ? Not all Latino ladies are ' cholas ' in the barrio , some of them are teachers , writers , engineers and nurses and doctors . " Radio stations in Malaysia chose to garble the part of the lyrics dealing with the acceptance of the LGBT community , due to censorship in the country , on content that may be deemed offensive . In response , Gaga urged her Malaysian fans , who wanted the uncensored version to be played , to take action by stating : " It is your job and it is your duty as young people to have your voices heard . You must do everything that you can if you want to be liberated by your society . You must call , you must not stop , you must protest peaceably . "

 A Bollywood version of the song was done by Indian music producer duo Salim and Sulaiman Merchant . The remix was released on DesiHits.com , a website for South Asian music and entertainment news .

The Merchants used a number of Indian musical instruments like the <unk> , sitar by Sunil Das , and the dhol and dholak in the chorus . Salim said that he sang a little bit of alaap to give the remix a Sufi touch , " as that 's the kind of music we do and it was also about adding our signature .

 " Born This Way " received generally positive reviews from music critics upon its release . Michael Cragg from The Guardian called the song a " disco anthem " , and said the chorus " crashes in with the weight of a discarded meat dress " . He also felt that the " campness " of the music made the lyrics sound less serious than it is . Rick Florino of Artistdirect gave the song five out of five stars and labeled it as " an immediate pop classic " , complimenting the hook and the chorus . Alison Schwartz from People added that " the club @-@ ready anthem , complete with a few A Capella chants and Italian lyrics , shows off Gaga 's powerhouse vocal chords — and knack for powerful songwriting . " Jem Aswad from Billboard responded positively to the anthemic nature of the song , and felt that it would become a staple song to be played on the radio and dancefloors in the following months . Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song five out of five stars , describing it as a " life @-@ affirming equality anthem , a straight @-@ up club pumper and a flat @-@ out fantastic pop song . " Writing for Slant Magazine , Sal Cinquemani understood that Gaga " has tapped into something truly special , maybe even important . " He also complimented the song 's underlying message of equality . Meghan Casserly of Forbes expected " Born This Way " to be the biggest gay anthem ever , since , according to her , it was written with that purpose in mind , and she also points out that it is " the next girl power song " . Annie Yuan of The Hollywood Reporter labeled the song " a hodge @-@ podge of other pop tunes . " Kevin O 'Donnell of Spin gave a mixed review , pointing out lyrical similarities to Michael Jackson 's " Black or White " ( 1991 ) . He added that seeing the hype surrounding the project , he expected Gaga to release a song " as epic and instantly classic as The Beatles ' ' A Day in the Life ' or Queen 's ' Bohemian Rhapsody ' . Imagine what she 'd come up with if she 'd spent more than ten minutes writing [ the song ] . " 
 Many critics noted similarities between " Born This Way " and Madonna 's 1989 song , " Express Yourself " , referring to " similar chords , same uplifting , girl @-@ power theme ( ... ) , same tempo " . Popjustice website pointed out the influence of other Madonna songs like " Deeper and Deeper " ( 1992 ) and " Vogue " ( 1990 ) . Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone acknowledged the influences of Madonna but pointed out that they would not overshadow the song , as it " [ summed ] up all the complex Gaga mythos , all her politics and Catholic angst and smeared lipstick , in one brilliant pop blast . " Caryn Ganz , while writing for Yahoo ! Music , criticized " Born This Way " , stating that the song was " overworked , overwrought , noisy , cheesy , and very , very derivative . " She specifically noted the similarities to songs like " When Love Takes Over " ( 2010 ) , " Waterfalls " ( 1995 ) , and three of Madonna 's songs : " Express Yourself " , " Ray of Light " ( 1998 ) , and " Vogue " . Megan Friedman from Time and Marissa Moss from The Huffington Post summarized their reaction as " mixed " , due to the similarities they found with " Express Yourself " . Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph noted that the imitative nature of the song would affect perceptions of Gaga 's artistry , since " Born This Way " was " [ basically ] a reworking of Madonna 's ' Express Yourself ' with a touch of ' Vogue ' , which is a bit too much Madonna for someone who is trying to establish her own identity as the , er , new Madonna . " The song has also attracted some academic attention : Juliet A. Williams , Professor of Gender studies UCLA , mentioning Madonna 's " Express Yourself " and Judith Butler 's Gender Trouble , points out its post @-@ essentialist feminist message . 
 Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times concluded that " Born This Way " had an entirely different message from the Madonna songs it was being compared to and further defended it by saying , " Whether its sound comes too close to one or another Madonna song seems beside the point ; what current pop hit doesn 't go green by recycling something familiar ? " . Gaga herself addressed the comparisons on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno , explaining that she had received an e @-@ mail from Madonna 's representatives , who had mentioned their support for " Born This Way " . " If the Queen says it shall be , then it shall be , " she added . CNN later reported that Madonna 's representatives were not aware that the singer , or her team , had sent Gaga an e @-@ mail regarding the situation . Two months later , while getting interviewed by NME magazine , Gaga further addressed the comparisons to " Express Yourself " : 
 " Why would I try to put out a song and think I 'm getting one over everybody ? That 's retarded . I will look in your eyes and tell you that I 'm not dumb enough or moronic enough to think that you are dumb or moronic enough not to see that I would have stolen a melody . If you put the songs next to each other , side by side , the only similarities are the chord progression . It 's the same one that has been in disco music for the last 50 years . Just because I 'm the first fucking artist in 25 years to think of putting it on Top 40 radio , it doesn 't mean I 'm a plagiarist , it means I 'm fucking smart . Sorry . " 
 When interviewed by ABC News in 2012 , Madonna was asked about the similarities between " Born This Way " and " Express Yourself " , stating : " When I heard [ ' Born This Way ' ] on the radio ... I said , ' that sounds very familiar ' ... It felt reductive . " She also came to report to The Newsweek Daily Beast Company what she had in mind when she heard " Born This Way " : " I thought , ' What a wonderful way to redo my song ' . I mean , I recognised the chord changes . I thought it was … interesting . "
