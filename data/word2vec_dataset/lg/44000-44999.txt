 The first planning maps from 1947 for what later became the Interstate Highway System included a highway along I @-@ 94 's route in Michigan . This highway was included on the 1955 plan for the " National System of Interstate and Defense Highways " with a proposed spur in the Battle Creek area . The modern I @-@ 94 was numbered I @-@ 92 between Benton Harbor – St. Joseph and Detroit with I @-@ 77 from Detroit to Port Huron in the August 1957 plans . 
 In April 1958 , the MSHD wanted to provide a single number for a more direct routing of a Detroit @-@ to – Chicago freeway ; the state proposed rerouting I @-@ 94 to replace I @-@ 92 in the state , but retained the I @-@ 77 designation . On June 27 , 1958 , AASHO adopted their original numbering plan for Michigan , minus the state 's proposed changes . Around the same time , a section of M @-@ 146 near Port Huron was converted into an approach freeway for the Blue Water Bridge .

 In January 1959 , officials announced that sections of US 12 , the Willow Run , Detroit Industrial and Edsel Ford expressways were to be given the I @-@ 94 designation , temporarily co @-@ designated with US 12 . These sections connected Ann Arbor to Detroit , along with a bypass of Kalamazoo to Galesburg and a bypass of Jackson . Later that year , additional segments of I @-@ 94 were opened , starting with a 10 @-@ mile ( 16 km ) section from Hartford to Coloma , then another from Paw Paw to Kalamazoo which connected with a segment between Galesburg to Battle Creek . The overall 45 @-@ mile ( 72 km ) section from Paw Paw to Battle Creek was dedicated on December 7 , 1959 . In addition , a new northwest – southeast section of freeway was built east of Ypsilanti to create a more gradual curve in the routing between present @-@ day exits 185 and 186 , the original routing of the Willow Run Expressway having followed present @-@ day <unk> Road . Signage for the state 's Interstate Highways was placed on hold pending finalization of the numbering scheme , and by late 1959 that signage was being added starting with I @-@ 75 and followed by the other open segments of freeway in the state . 
 Sections of freeway opened in southwestern Michigan in 1960 between the Benton Harbor – St Joseph area and between Jackson and Ann Arbor ; the latter was built over existing portions of US 12 . In this year Michigan became the first state to complete a border @-@ to @-@ border toll @-@ free Interstate within their state , running for 205 miles ( 330 km ) from Detroit toward New Buffalo , the longest toll @-@ free freeway in the country at the time . 
 In January 1962 , the US 12 designation was removed from the I @-@ 94 freeway . In the process , the designation was transferred to replace the US 112 designation in its entirety . After this transfer , I @-@ 94 was no longer concurrent with US 12 , except for the Ypsilanti bypass . In 1963 the freeway was extended south of New Buffalo to end at M @-@ 239 . Traffic was diverted down M @-@ 239 into Indiana where State Road 39 carried traffic the rest of the way to the Indiana Toll Road . By the end of the year , a section of highway opened between Mount Clemens and Marysville , and US 25 was rerouted to run concurrently along the freeway from the New Baltimore area northward . 
 The eastern terminus of I @-@ 94 in the Port Huron area was dedicated on October 14 , 1964 , signaling the completion of the highway between Marysville and the Blue Water Bridge . Two years later , the gap between the Wayne – Macomb county line and the end of the freeway near Mount Clemens was filled in when another section of freeway opened . North of Albion , the route of the freeway previously crossed a branch of the New York Central Railroad at @-@ grade ; the crossing was eliminated when the tracks were removed in 1968 . 
 The sections originally designated as the Willow Run Expressway were rebuilt from <unk> Road in Belleville to <unk> Road in Romulus starting in 1972 . As part of this reconstruction , the segment between Haggerty Road and <unk> Road was widened from four to six lanes , and the eastbound lanes were realigned to facilitate construction of an interchange with I @-@ 275 , a western bypass of Detroit which was under construction at the time . The Willow Run segment was also resurfaced at this point , as the old road bed did not contain steel mesh . Construction of this interchange also obliterated a partial interchange with Huron River Drive . 
 The final section of I @-@ 94 in Michigan opened to traffic on November 2 , 1972 , when the connection across the state line into Indiana was dedicated . This last segment in Michigan between M @-@ 239 and the state line opened when Indiana completed an 18 @-@ mile ( 29 km ) segment of freeway in their state .

 On August 16 , 1987 , Northwest Airlines Flight 255 crashed after attempting to take off from Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport , killing all but one passenger , Cecilia <unk> , upon exploding at an overpass at <unk> Road . A decade later , in July 1997 , the second span of the Blue Water Bridge opened between Port Huron and Point Edward , Ontario . 
 The original interchange with US 24 ( Telegraph Road ) had only two bridges and left hand exits were used throughout . This interchange was reconfigured in 2005 to a single @-@ point urban interchange ( SPUI ) design that was completed in December of that year . A pair of bridges called the Gateway Arch Bridges ( alternately " Gateway to Detroit " ) was incorporated in the new interchange . 
 In 2011 , construction was started to widen I @-@ 94 / I @-@ 69 approaching the Blue Water Bridge allowing for dedicated lanes for local traffic and for Blue Water Bridge traffic . The lane configuration changes have confused drivers in the area , especially motorists with outdated GPS devices ; because of this , MDOT installed updated signs complete with American and Canadian flags to help prevent drivers from heading to Canada by mistake . 
 Additional construction in the Port Huron area started in late 2013 to rebuild and reconfigure the I @-@ 94 / I @-@ 69 interchange outside the city . The project improved 3 @.@ 7 miles ( 6 @.@ 0 km ) of freeway , replaced several bridges and ramps and cost $ 76 million . In June 2014 , MDOT closed the ramps from I @-@ 69 eastbound to BL I @-@ 69 through the interchange until later in the year . The project is slated to be completed in 2015 .

 As the original expressway through the center of Detroit was being planned in the 1940s , it was unofficially named the Harper – McGraw Expressway after the streets along which it was to run . Some initial support surfaced to name it after Roy Chapin , the late president of the Hudson Motor Car Company and a former United States Secretary of Commerce under President Herbert Hoover . On April 23 , 1946 , the Detroit Common Council voted instead to name the highway after Edsel Ford , the son of Henry Ford and president of the Ford Motor Company from 1918 until his death in 1943 . 
 Two other original sections of I @-@ 94 's predecessor highways in the Detroit area were given early names . The westernmost of these is the Willow Run Expressway , named for the Willow Run complex . The plants at Willow Run produced B @-@ 24 Liberator bombers by Ford Motor Company during World War II . The second , the Detroit Industrial Expressway , continued the route of the Willow Run Expressway eastward into Detroit . Both highways were built to move workers from Detroit to the industrial plants at Willow Run during the war and were later incorporated into I @-@ 94 in the 1950s as part of a Detroit – Chicago highway . 
 The section of I @-@ 94 northeast of Detroit was named after former Congressman James G. O 'Hara by the Michigan Legislature . O 'Hara was a World War II veteran who served in the United States House from 1959 until 1977 . During his tenure in Congress , he procured federal funds for the construction of I @-@ 94 through his district . The first attempt to name the highway after him failed in 1991 , but the honor was included in a budget bill passed in 1997 . The section of I @-@ 94 was dedicated on October 16 , 1998 , after donors privately raised nearly $ 10 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 16 @,@ 945 in 2015 ) to pay for the highway signs . 
 A segment of I @-@ 94 in Battle Creek between the exits for Business Loop I @-@ 94 ( BL I @-@ 94 ) and I @-@ 194 was named the 94th Combat Infantry Division Memorial Highway by the Michigan Legislature in 2002 . The name honors a unit of the US Army which was activated at the nearby Fort Custer in 1942 and served with distinction in the European theatre of World War II . Because the unit originated in Battle Creek , and its number matched that of the freeway , the Legislature thought it only fitting to name the section of highway for the unit . The name was dedicated in ceremonies at a rest stop along the section of I @-@ 94 on September 28 , 2002 . 
 Another piece of I @-@ 94 in Calhoun County was designated in 2004 as part of the Underground Railroad Memorial Highway . Starting in 1990 , the National Park Service started working to identify routes of the Underground Railroad . The Battle Creek area was active in the railroad during the Civil War , and the section of I @-@ 94 between exits 98 and 110 east of Battle Creek was included in the memorial designation . 
 In June 2012 , after a resolution passed by the Michigan Legislature was signed by Gov. Rick Snyder , a portion of I @-@ 94 in Taylor between Inkster and Pelham roads was named the " Auxiliary Lt. Dan Kromer Memorial Highway " after a 20 @-@ year veteran of the Taylor Police Department , who was killed in 2010 while helping motorists who had car trouble .

 There are nine highways related to I @-@ 94 in Michigan . The first is the spur into downtown Battle Creek numbered I @-@ 194 and nicknamed " The Penetrator " and officially called the " Sojourner Truth Downtown Parkway " . This auxiliary Interstate Highway runs for about three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) to connect I @-@ 94 northward into downtown . The other eight highways are business loops of I @-@ 94 that connect various cities ' downtowns with the main freeway . Unlike I @-@ 194 , these loops are not freeways . Located from west to east along I @-@ 94 's routing in Michigan , they serve Benton Harbor – St. Joseph , Kalamazoo , Battle Creek , Marshall , Albion , Jackson , Ann Arbor , and Port Huron . 
 = SMS Karlsruhe = 
 SMS Karlsruhe was a light cruiser of the Karlsruhe class built by the German Kaiserliche Marine ( Imperial Navy ) . She had one sister ship , SMS Rostock ; the ships were very similar to the previous Magdeburg @-@ class cruisers . The ship was laid down in 1911 , launched in November 1912 , and completed by January 1914 . Armed with twelve 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 45 guns , Karlsruhe had a top speed of 28 @.@ 5 knots ( 52 @.@ 8 km / h ; 32 @.@ 8 mph ) , which allowed her to escape from British cruisers during her career . 
 After her commissioning , Karlsruhe was assigned to overseas duties in the Caribbean . She arrived in the area in July 1914 , days before the outbreak of World War I. Once the war began , she armed the passenger liner SS Kronprinz Wilhelm , but while the ships were transferring equipment , British ships located them and pursued Karlsruhe . Her superior speed allowed her to escape , after which she operated off the northeastern coast of Brazil . Here , she captured or sank sixteen ships . While en route to attack the shipping lanes to Barbados on 4 November 1914 , a spontaneous internal explosion destroyed the ship and killed the majority of the crew . The survivors used one of Karlsruhe 's colliers to return to Germany in December 1914 . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Karlsruhe was ordered under the contract name " Ersatz Seeadler " and was laid down at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel on 21 September 1911 . She was christened by Karl <unk> , the mayor of Karlsruhe , and launched on 11 November 1912 , after which fitting @-@ out work commenced . She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 15 January 1914 . The ship was 142 @.@ 2 meters ( 467 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 13 @.@ 7 m ( 45 ft ) and a draft of 5 @.@ 38 m ( 17 @.@ 7 ft ) forward . She displaced 6 @,@ 191 t ( 6 @,@ 093 long tons ; 6 @,@ 824 short tons ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two sets of Marine steam turbines driving two 3 @.@ 5 @-@ meter ( 11 ft ) propellers . They were designed to give 26 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 19 @,@ 000 kW ) , but reached 37 @,@ 885 shp ( 28 @,@ 251 kW ) in service . These were powered by twelve coal @-@ fired Marine @-@ type water @-@ tube boilers and two oil @-@ fired double @-@ ended boilers . These gave the ship a top speed of 28 @.@ 5 knots ( 52 @.@ 8 km / h ; 32 @.@ 8 mph ) . Karlsruhe carried 1 @,@ 300 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 300 long tons ) of coal , and an additional 200 tonnes ( 200 long tons ) of oil that gave her a range of approximately 5 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 9 @,@ 300 km ; 5 @,@ 800 mi ) at 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . Karlsruhe had a crew of 18 officers and 355 enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with twelve 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 45 guns in single pedestal mounts . Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle , eight were located amidships , four on either side , and two were side by side aft . The guns had a maximum elevation of 30 degrees , which allowed them to engage targets out to 12 @,@ 700 m ( 41 @,@ 700 ft ) . They were supplied with 1 @,@ 800 rounds of ammunition , for 150 shells per gun . She was also equipped with a pair of 50 cm ( 19 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes with five torpedoes submerged in the hull on the broadside . She could also carry 120 mines . The ship was protected by a waterline armored belt that was 60 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) thick amidships . The conning tower had 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick sides , and the deck was covered with up to 60 mm thick armor plate .

 Karlsruhe 's first commanding officer was Fregattenkapitän Fritz Lüdecke . Following her commissioning in January 1914 , Karlsruhe was assigned to overseas service , under the command of Fregattenkapitän Erich Köhler . At the outbreak of World War I the following August , the ship was based in the Caribbean , along with the cruiser Dresden . She had anchored in Cay Sal Bank in the Florida Strait when she received warnings that war in Europe was imminent . Karlsruhe 's standing orders in the event of war saw the ship conducting a commerce raiding campaign against British merchant traffic . To hunt down Karlsruhe and any merchant ships she might arm as auxiliary cruisers , the Royal Navy deployed five cruiser squadrons , the most powerful were those commanded by Rear Admiral Christopher Craddock and Rear Admiral Archibald Stoddart . The British were forced to disperse their ships to cover the areas in which the two German cruisers , and any auxiliary cruisers they might arm , could operate . 
 On 6 August , Karlsruhe rendezvoused with the passenger ship SS Kronprinz Wilhelm about 120 nmi ( 220 km ; 140 mi ) north of Watling Island . Karlsruhe was in the process of transferring guns and equipment to the liner when Craddock , in his flagship HMS Suffolk , appeared to the south . The Germans had only managed to transfer two 8 @.@ 8 cm guns , a machine gun , and some sailors by the time Suffolk arrived . The two ships quickly departed in different directions ; Suffolk followed Karlsruhe and other cruisers were ordered to intercept her . Karlsruhe 's faster speed allowed her to quickly outpace Craddock , but at 20 : 15 , Bristol joined the pursuit and briefly fired on the German cruiser . The German gunners scored two hits on Bristol during the short engagement . Karlsruhe turned east and again used her high speed to evade the British ships . The British failed to relocate her , and by 9 August , Karlsruhe reached Puerto Rico with only 12 tons of coal in her bunkers . 
 With limited options for coal in the Caribbean , Köhler took his ship down to the northeast coast of Brazil , off Pernambuco . The area was not as heavily patrolled by the British . Here , Karlsruhe had easy access to coal supplies , either from chartered colliers or captured vessels . Köhler frequently kept one or two prizes to assist in the search for targets . In the course of her patrols off the Brazilian coast , Karlsruhe sank or captured sixteen merchant ships . These merchantmen , fifteen British ships and one Dutch vessel , totaled 72 @,@ 805 gross register tons ( GRT ) . Köhler then decided to move to another area , as remaining in one area would increase his chances of being tracked down by the British . He turned his ship toward the West Indies to attack Barbados and Fort @-@ de @-@ France and the shipping lanes between Barbados and Trinidad . 
 As Karlsruhe steamed to Barbados on the night of 4 November , a spontaneous internal explosion destroyed the ship . The hull was split in half ; the bow section quickly sank and took with it Köhler and most of the crew . The stern remained afloat long enough for 140 of the ship 's crew to escape onto the attending colliers . Commander <unk> , the senior surviving officer , took charge and placed all of his men aboard the liner Rio Negro . He scuttled the second collier and steamed north for Iceland . The ship used the cover of a major storm to slip through the British blockade of the North Sea , and put in at Ålesund , Norway . Rio Negro then returned to Germany by early December . The Admiralstab , unaware of the loss of Karlsruhe , coincidentally radioed the ship to order her to return to Germany . Germany kept the loss of the ship a secret , and the British continued searching for her until they learned of her fate in March 1915 . Köhler 's widow christened the cruiser Karlsruhe , the third to bear the name , at her launching in August 1927 . 
 = Hurricane Guillermo ( 1997 ) = 
 Hurricane Guillermo was the ninth most intense Pacific hurricane on record , attaining peak winds of 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of 919 hPa ( 27 @.@ 14 inHg ) . Forming out of a tropical wave on July 30 , 1997 , roughly 345 mi ( 555 km ) south of Salina Cruz , Mexico , Guillermo tracked in a steady west @-@ northwestward direction while intensifying . The system reached hurricane status by August 1 before undergoing rapid intensification the following day . At the end of this phase , the storm attained its peak intensity as a powerful Category 5 hurricane . The storm began to weaken during the afternoon of August 5 and was downgraded to a tropical storm on August 8 . Once entering the Central Pacific Hurricane Center 's area of responsibility , Guillermo briefly weakened to a tropical depression before re @-@ attaining tropical storm status . On August 15 , the storm reached an unusually high latitude of 41 @.@ 8 ° N before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone . The remnants persisted for more than a week as they tracked towards the northeast and later south and east before being absorbed by a larger extratropical system off the coast of California on August 24 . 
 Throughout Guillermo 's track , the storm never threatened any major landmass , resulting in little impact on land . However , because of its extreme intensity , it produced large swells across the Pacific Ocean , affecting areas from Hawaii to coastal Mexico . Along the American Pacific coast , three people drowned amid high waves , two in Baja California and one in California . At its peak , Guillermo was the second strongest known Pacific hurricane on record ; however , it has since been surpassed by five other storms , including Linda later that year . The effects of Guillermo were not deemed severe enough to justify retirement of its name . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Hurricane Guillermo began its extensive track as a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on July 16 , 1997 . Initially disorganized and weak , the system tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean for several weeks . The National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) stated that they had issues monitoring the system as it moved through the Caribbean ; however , they interpreted through satellite data that the wave crossed Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean between July 27 and 28 . Once in the Pacific , convection , areas of thunderstorm activity , and banding features began to form . Additionally , a low pressure system developed within the disturbance by July 29 . The following day , the system became sufficiently organized for the NHC to classify it as Tropical Depression Nine @-@ E ; at this time the depression was situated roughly 345 mi ( 555 km ) south of Salina Cruz , Mexico . In response to a deep @-@ layer ridge to the north , the depression tracked at a steady pace towards the west @-@ northwest , and this motion persisted through the first week of August . Within a day of being classified , the system intensified into Tropical Storm Guillermo , the seventh named storm of the 1997 season . 
 By the afternoon of August 1 , a strong central dense overcast , an area of high , thick clouds , developed over the center of circulation , prompting the NHC to upgrade it to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale . Throughout the next day , the system gradually developed an eye within the central dense overcast , leading to further strengthening . Operationally , Guillermo was thought to have briefly leveled out in intensity on August 2 ; however , in post @-@ storm analysis , the NHC discovered that a steady period of rapid intensification took place . Unlike most hurricanes in the eastern Pacific , Guillermo was investigated by Hurricane Hunters reconnaissance aircraft during its rapid intensification stage . The aircraft released several dropsondes into the storm to gather meteorological data . This mission marked the first time the Hurricane Hunters recorded high @-@ resolution wind data from flight level to within several meters of the ocean surface inside the eyewall of a major hurricane . 
 Radar was also employed to determine the size of the hurricane 's eye , stated to be roughly 13 mi ( 20 km ) in diameter , following a 6 @-@ mile ( 10 km ) decrease due to the strengthening . Light wind shear surrounding the hurricane allowed further strengthening to take place . Late on August 2 , the system attained winds of 135 mph ( 215 km / h ) , making it a Category 4 storm . During the afternoon of August 3 , Guillermo nearly attained Category 5 intensity as it reached its initial peak intensity with winds of 155 mph ( 250 km / h ) along with a barometric pressure estimated at 925 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 32 inHg ) . A brief period of weakening took place later that day before further strengthening ensued . Late on August 4 , Guillermo intensified into a Category 5 hurricane , attaining peak winds of 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) . Operational analysis of satellite information indicated a minimum pressure of 921 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 2 inHg ) ; however , post @-@ storm studies stated that the pressure was more likely around 919 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 14 inHg ) . 
 At its peak , cloud temperatures within the eyewall were estimated to be as low as − 79 ° C ( − 110 ° F ) . Using the Dvorak technique , a method used to estimate the intensity of tropical cyclones , a value of 7 @.@ 6 was obtained . This indicated that maximum winds at the surface could have been as high as 181 mph ( 291 km / h ) ; however , this was not used as the reported intensity as six- to twelve @-@ hour averages indicated sustained winds around 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) . After maintaining this intensity for roughly 18 hours , the system began to weaken as it moved into a less favorable environment with moderate wind shear . Cloud temperatures within the eyewall also began to increase , indicating that the hurricane was losing intensity . 
 Steady weakening took place over the following several days , and the storm dropped below major hurricane status on August 6 . By August 8 , Guillermo moved over colder waters and was downgraded to a tropical storm as sustained winds dropped below 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) . Around this time , the storm started to move along the western edge of the ridge that previously steered it towards the west @-@ northwest , causing Guillermo to turn northwest . On August 9 , the storm crossed longitude 140 ° W , denoting a shift in warning responsibility from the NHC to the Central Pacific Hurricane Center ( CPHC ) . Not long after crossing into the CPHC 's area of responsibility , the storm further weakened to a tropical depression as it moved over 24 ° C ( 75 ° F ) waters . 
 Although most tropical cyclones generally weaken as they increase in latitude , warm waters of 26 ° C ( 79 ° F ) allowed Guillermo to re @-@ intensify into a tropical storm on August 11 . Gradually , the storm attained winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) before succumbing to cooler waters further north . The storm weakened to a tropical depression once more on August 15 , situated well to the north of the Hawaiian islands . Later that day , Guillermo transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at an unusually high latitude of 41 @.@ 8 ° N , roughly 850 mi ( 1 @,@ 370 km ) south @-@ southeast of Unalaska , Alaska . Over the following days , the remnants of the hurricane turned northeastward towards the Pacific coast of North America . On August 19 , the system moved within 575 mi ( 925 km ) of Vancouver Island , British Columbia before Guillermo tracked southward . Over the following few days , the system slowed significantly and turned towards the east . By August 20 , moisture from the remnants of Tropical Storm Ignacio were entrained into the eastern portion of Guillermo 's circulation . On August 24 , the low was finally absorbed by a larger extratropical system while situated roughly 345 mi ( 555 km ) off of the northern California coastline . 
 = = Impact and records = = 
 Along the Pacific coast of Mexico , 12 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) surf produced by Hurricane Guillermo affected numerous beaches . From Cabo San Lucas to San José del Cabo , the storm sent waves from the Gulf of California over the grounds of beachside resorts . Tourists were driven off some of Cabo 's most popular beaches by the rough ocean conditions which flooded homes situated along the coast . Two sightseers were killed after being swept out to sea . 
 Due to accurate forecasts , emergency officials across California were able to close off swimming zones and warn the public about dangerous rip currents prior to their arrival . Guillermo generated heavy surf across the beaches of Southern California . Heights from the surf averaged 6 to 8 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 to 2 @.@ 4 m ) with local areas reaching above 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) , favorable to around 500 surfers at an annual competition at Huntington Beach . According to the Los Angeles Times , some waves reached heights of 15 to 18 ft ( 4 @.@ 6 to 5 @.@ 5 m ) . Over 100 rescues were reported by local lifeguards . Waves ranging from 6 to 12 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 to 3 @.@ 7 m ) also affected Orange County . Hundreds of people were rescued , but rip currents were blamed for three injuries and one death . On August 5 , about a mile north of Huntington Beach pier , a 19 @-@ year @-@ old man was swept away . His body was recovered several days later . On August 6 , a teenage boy and girl were injured on a beach in Corona Del Mar , while an 18 @-@ year @-@ old was pulled ashore and sent to the hospital with neck injuries . In Newport Beach , lifeguards made nearly 300 rescues on August 5 and 6 alone . 
 In addition to coastal impacts , the system brought a surge of warm , moist air into southern California , bringing temperatures in some areas as high as 110 ° F ( 43 ° C ) . Between August 15 and 17 , large waves generated while it was at peak intensity came ashore in Hawaii . The swells caused no damage and reached heights of 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) in eastern @-@ facing shores of the state . 
 Hurricane Guillermo 's central pressure of 919 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 14 inHg ) established it as the second most intense Pacific hurricane on record behind Hurricane Ava of 1973 . However , later in the 1997 season , Hurricane Linda set a new intensity record , and in subsequent years hurricanes Kenna , Ioke , Rick , Marie , Odile and Patricia all achieved lower pressures , leaving Guillermo in ninth place . Guillermo persisted for 16 @.@ 5 days from its classification as a tropical depression to its transition into an extratropical storm , making it the sixth longest @-@ lasting storm in the basin . 
 = 1st Army Group ( Kingdom of Yugoslavia ) = 
 The 1st Army Group was a Royal Yugoslav Army formation commanded by Armijski đeneral Milorad Petrović during the German @-@ led Axis invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in April 1941 during World War II . It consisted of the 4th Army , 7th Army , and the 1st Cavalry Division , which was the army group reserve . It was responsible for the defence of northwestern Yugoslavia , with the 4th Army defending the western sector along the Yugoslav @-@ Hungarian border , and the 7th Army defending the eastern sector along the Reich and Italian borders . 
 The 1st Army Group was weakened by fifth column activities within its major units , and the chief @-@ of @-@ staff and chief of operations of the headquarters of 1st Army Group aided both Croat Ustaše and Slovene separatists in the 4th and 7th Army sectors respectively . The Germans seized bridges over the Drava river in both sectors and several mountain passes in the 7th Army sector on the first day . In the 4th Army sector , the formation and expansion of German bridgeheads across the Drava were facilitated by fifth column elements of the Ustaše and sympathetic units of the paramilitary Civic and Peasant Guards of the Croatian Peasant Party . Revolts of Croat soldiers broke out in all three divisions of the 4th Army in the first few days , causing significant disruption to mobilisation and deployment . The revolts within the 4th Army were of great concern to the commander of the 7th Army , but Petrović did not permit him to withdraw from border areas until the night of 7 / 8 April , which was followed by the German capture of Maribor as they continued to expand their bridgeheads . 
 The 4th Army also began to withdraw southwards on 9 April , and on 10 April it quickly ceased to exist as an operational formation in the face of two determined armoured thrusts by the XLVI Motorised Corps , one of which captured Zagreb that evening . Italian offensive operations also began , with thrusts towards Ljubljana and down the Adriatic coast , capturing over 30 @,@ 000 Yugoslav troops near Delnice . On 12 April , a German armoured column linked up with the Italians near the Adriatic coast , encircling the remnants of the withdrawing 7th Army . When fifth column elements arrested the staffs of 1st Army Group , 4th Army and 7th Army at Petrinja , the 1st Army Group effectively ceased to exist . Remnants of the 4th Army attempted to establish defensive positions in northeastern Bosnia , but were quickly brushed aside by German armour as it drove towards Sarajevo . The Yugoslav High Command unconditionally surrendered on 18 April . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Royal Yugoslav Army ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : Vojska Kraljevine Jugoslavije , VKJ ) was formed after World War I as the army of the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( Kingdom of SCS ) , when that country was created on 1 December 1918 . To defend the new kingdom , an army was formed around the nucleus of the victorious Royal Serbian Army combined with armed formations raised in the former parts of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Empire that joined with the Kingdom of Serbia to form the new state . Many former Austro @-@ Hungarian officers and soldiers became members of the new army . From its beginning , the army , like other aspects of public life in the new kingdom , was dominated by ethnic Serbs , who saw the army as a means by which to secure Serb hegemony in the new kingdom . 
 The development of the army was hampered by the poor economy of the kingdom , and this continued through the 1920s . In 1929 , King Alexander changed the name of the country to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia , at which time the army became the VKJ . The army budget remained tight , and as tensions rose across Europe during the 1930s , it became hard to secure weapons and munitions from other countries . Consequently , at the time World War II broke out in September 1939 , the VKJ had several serious weaknesses , which included reliance on draught animals for transport , and the large size of its formations . For example , infantry divisions had a wartime strength of 26 @,@ 000 – 27 @,@ 000 men , as compared to contemporary British infantry divisions of half that strength . These characteristics resulted in slow , unwieldy formations , and the inadequate supply of arms and munitions meant that even the very large Yugoslav formations had low firepower . Older generals better suited to the trench warfare of World War I , were combined with an army that was not equipped or trained to resist the fast @-@ moving combined arms approach used by the Germans in Poland and France . 
 The weaknesses of the VKJ in strategy , structure , equipment , mobility and supply were exacerbated to a significant degree by the lack of unity across Yugoslavia which had resulted from two decades of Serb hegemony , and the attendant lack of political legitimacy achieved by the central government . Attempts to address the lack of unity came too late to ensure that the VKJ was a cohesive force . Fifth column activity was also a serious concern , not only from the Croatian nationalist Ustaše , but from the Slovene and ethnic German minorities in the country .

 The 1st Army Group was commanded by Armijski đeneral Milorad Petrović , and consisted of the 4th Army , commanded by Armijski đeneral Petar Nedeljković , the 7th Army , commanded by <unk> General Dušan Trifunović , and the 1st Cavalry Division . The 4th Army consisted of three divisions , a brigade @-@ strength infantry detachment , one horsed cavalry regiment and one infantry regiment , and was supported by artillery , anti @-@ aircraft artillery , border guards , and air reconnaissance elements of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force . The troops of the 4th Army included a high percentage of Croats . The 7th Army consisted of two divisions , one divisional @-@ strength mountain detachment , one brigade @-@ strength mountain detachment and a brigade @-@ strength infantry detachment , which was supported by artillery and anti @-@ aircraft artillery , and also had air reconnaissance support . The 1st Army Group did not control any additional support units . 
 = = Planned deployment = = 
 The deployment plan for 1st Army Group saw the 4th Army deployed in a cordon behind the Drava between Varaždin and Slatina , with formations centred around the towns of Ivanec , Varaždin , Koprivnica and Virovitica . The 7th Army deployment plan saw its formations placed in a cordon along the border region from the Adriatic coast near Senj north into the Julian Alps and along the Reich border to Maribor . Of the formations of the 1st Army Group , the mountain detachments and infantry detachment of the 7th Army were largely mobilised , one infantry division of the 4th Army was partly mobilised , and the remaining four infantry divisions and the 1st Cavalry Division had only commenced mobilisation . To the right of the 4th Army was the 2nd Army Group . On the right flank of the 1st Army Group was the 2nd Army of the 2nd Army Group , with the army group boundary running from just east of Slatina through Požega towards Banja Luka . On the left flank , the Adriatic coast was defended by Coastal Defence Command .

 German Army headquarters wanted to capture the bridges over the Drava intact , and from 1 April had issued orders to the German 2nd Army to conduct preliminary operations aimed at seizing the bridge at Barcs and the railway bridge northeast of Koprivnica by coup de main . As a result , limited objective attacks were launched along the line of the Drava by the XLVI Motorised Corps , despite the fact that they were not expected to launch offensive operations until 10 April . Similar operations occurred on the extreme left flank of the 4th Army , where raiding parties and patrols from LI Infantry Corps seized the high ground on the south side of the Drava . 
 In the early hours of 6 April 1941 , units of the 4th Army were located in their mobilisation region or were marching toward the Hungarian border . LI Infantry Corps seized the intact bridge over the Drava at Gornja Radgona , and a bicycle @-@ mounted detachment of the 183rd Infantry Division captured Murska Sobota without encountering resistance . By the evening it had become clear to the Germans that the Yugoslavs would not be resisting stubbornly at the border . XLVI Motorised Corps was then ordered to begin seizing bridges over the Drava at <unk> <unk> , <unk> , Zákány and Barcs . These local attacks were sufficient to inflame dissent within the largely Croat 4th Army , who refused to resist Germans they considered their liberators from Serbian oppression during the interwar period . On 7 April , reconnaissance units of XLVI Motorised Corps crossed the Drava and attacked towards Koprivnica . In the afternoon , German Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers of Sturzkampfgeschwader 77 escorted by Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters caught the Breguet 19s of the 4th Air Reconnaissance Group on the ground at Velika Gorica , destroying most of them . Elements of the 27th Infantry Division Savska unsuccessfully attacked the bridgehead throughout the day , and by nightfall had resolved to counter @-@ attack on the morning of 8 April . Also on 7 April , the few remaining Breguet 19s of 4th Air Reconnaissance Group mounted attacks on a bridge over the Drava at Gyékényes . 
 On the afternoon of 7 April , further German units began to cross the Drava near Barcs and established a second bridgehead there . Fifth column activities within units of the 4th Army were fomented by the Croatian fascist organisation , the Ustaše , which facilitated German establishment of the bridgehead at Barcs , and resulted in a number of significant revolts within units . Of two regiments of the 42nd Infantry Division Murska , all but two battalions revolted and refused to deploy into their allocated positions . Similarly , the 108th Infantry Regiment of the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska , which had mobilised in Bjelovar , was marching towards Virovitica to take up positions . On the night of 7 / 8 April , the Croats of the 108th Regiment revolted , arrested their Serb officers , non @-@ commissioned officers and soldiers . The regiment then marched back to Bjelovar , where it joined up with other rebellious units about noon on 8 April . 
 On 8 April , Josip Broz Tito and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia , then located in Zagreb , along with the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Croatia , sent a delegation to the headquarters of the 4th Army urging them to issue arms to workers to help defend Zagreb . Pavle Gregorić , who was a member of both Central Committees , went to 4th Army headquarters twice , and was able to speak briefly with Nedeljković , but could not convince him to do so . On that same day , the leader of the Croatian Peasant Party , Vladko Maček who had returned to Zagreb after briefly joining the post @-@ Yugoslav coup d 'état government of Dušan Simović , agreed to send an emissary to the 108th Infantry Regiment of the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska urging them to obey their officers , but they did not respond to his appeal . 
 When the Germans began to expand their bridgehead at Barcs , the rebel Croat troops at Bjelovar made contact with them , and the 4th Army began to withdraw southwards on 9 April . On the night of 9 / 10 April , those Croats that had remained with their units began to desert or turn on their commanders . The 27th Infantry Division Savska suffered from similar revolts , which eased the German capture of Koprivnica .

 The border between the Reich and Yugoslavia was unsuitable for motorised operations . Due to the short notice of the invasion , the elements of the invading 2nd Army that would make up LI Infantry Corps and XLIX Mountain Corps had to be assembled from France , Germany and the Slovak Republic , and nearly all encountered difficulties in reaching their assembly areas . In the interim , the Germans formed a special force under the code name Feuerzauber ( Magic Fire ) . This force was initially intended to merely reinforce the <unk> Frontier Guard Division , who were manning the border . On the evening of 5 April , one of the aggressive Feuerzauber detachment commanders , Hauptmann Palten led his Kampfgruppe Palten across the Mura from Spielfeld and , having secured the bridge , began attacking bunkers and other Yugoslav positions on the high ground , and sent patrols deep into the Yugoslav border fortification system . Due to a lack of Yugoslav counter @-@ attacks , many of these positions remained in German hands into 6 April . 
 LI Infantry Corps were tasked with attacking towards Maribor then driving towards Zagreb , while the XLIX Mountain Corps was to capture Dravograd then force a crossing on the Sava . On the first day of the invasion , LI Infantry Corps captured the Drava bridges at Mureck and Radkersburg ( opposite Radgon ) undamaged , and the 183rd Infantry Division captured 300 prisoners . A bicycle @-@ mounted detachment of the 183rd Infantry Division reached the extreme left flank of the Yugoslav 4th Army at Murska Sobota without striking any resistance . The 132nd Infantry Division also pushed south along the <unk> valley towards <unk> . 
 Late that day , mountain pioneers destroyed some isolated Yugoslav bunkers in the area penetrated by Kampfgruppe Palten . On that day , the governor of the Drava Banovina , Marko Natlačen met with representatives of the major Slovene political parties , and created the National Council of Slovenia , whose aim was to establish a Slovenia independent of Yugoslavia . When he heard the news of fifth column @-@ led revolts within the 4th Army , Trifunović was alarmed , and proposed withdrawal from the border areas , but this was rejected by Petrović . The front along the border with Italy was relatively quiet , with only patrol clashes occurring . The Yugoslav High Command ordered that the 7th Army capture Fiume , across the Rječina river from Sušak , but the order was soon rescinded . 
 Over the next three days , LI Corps held the lead elements of its two divisions back while the rest of each division detrained in Graz and made their way to the border . All elements of both divisions had unloaded by 9 April . On the afternoon of 7 April , German Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers of Sturzkampfgeschwader 77 escorted by Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters also caught the Breguet 19s of the 6th Air Reconnaissance Group on the ground at Cerklje , destroying most of them . As a result of the revolts in the 4th Army , on the night of 7 / 8 April , Petrović ordered the 7th Army to begin to withdraw , first to a line through the Dravinja river , Zidani Most bridge and the right bank of the Krka river . This was subsequently moved back to the line of the Kupa river . On 8 April , disregarding orders from above , Palten led his Kampfgruppe south towards Maribor , and crossed the Pesnica river in pneumatic boats , leaving his unit vehicles behind . In the evening , Palten and his force entered Maribor unopposed , taking 100 prisoners . Kampfgruppe Palten was ordered to return to Spielfeld , and spent the rest of the invasion guarding the border . In the meantime , the forward elements of the two divisions consolidated their bridgeheads , with the 132nd Infantry Division securing Maribor , and the 183rd Infantry Division pushing past Murska Sobota . 
 The activities of Natlačen and his council continued from the day the invasion commenced , and the Yugoslav High Command soon ordered their arrest . However , the chief of staff of the headquarters of the 1st Army Group , <unk> General Leon Rupnik and the head of the operations staff , Pukovnik Franjo Nikolić did not carry out the orders . On 9 April , the 6th Air Reconnaissance Group airfield at Cerklje was again attacked by German aircraft .

 Early on 10 April , Nikolić left his post and visited the senior Ustaše leader Slavko Kvaternik in Zagreb . He then returned to the headquarters and redirected 4th Army units around Zagreb to either cease operations or to deploy to innocuous positions . These actions reduced or eliminated armed resistance to the German advance . 
 On the same day , the Germans broke out of the bridgeheads they had established , with the 14th Panzer Division , supported by dive bombers , crossing the Drava and driving southwest towards Zagreb on snow @-@ covered roads in extremely cold conditions . Initial air reconnaissance indicated large concentrations of Yugoslav troops on the divisional axis of advance , but these troops proved to be withdrawing towards Zagreb . Ustaše and their sympathisers in the paramilitary Civic and Peasant Guards of the Croatian Peasant Party disarmed and captured the staff of several 4th Army units , including the 1st Army Group , and 4th and 7th Armies at Petrinja , and the 4th Army effectively ceased to exist as a formation . Soon after the 14th Panzer Division commenced its attack , the main thrust of the XLVI Motorised Corps , consisting of the 8th Panzer Division leading the 16th Motorised Infantry Division crossed the Drava at Barcs . The 8th Panzer Division turned southeast between the Drava and Sava rivers , and meeting almost no resistance , had reached Slatina by evening . 
 About 17 : 45 on 10 April , Kvaternik and SS @-@ Standartenführer ( Colonel ) Edmund Veesenmayer went to the radio station in Zagreb and Kvaternik proclaimed the creation of the Independent State of Croatia . By 19 : 30 on 10 April , despite initial resistance , lead elements of the 14th Panzer Division had reached the outskirts of Zagreb , having covered nearly 160 kilometres ( 99 miles ) in a single day . By the time it entered Zagreb , the 14th Panzer Division was met by cheering crowds , and had captured 15 @,@ 000 Yugoslav troops , and 22 generals , including both Petrović and Trifunović . Held up by freezing weather and snow storms , on 10 April , on the following day LI Corps was approaching Zagreb from the north , and bicycle @-@ mounted troops of the 183rd Infantry Division had turned east to capture Varaždin , along with an entire Yugoslav brigade including its commanding general . On the same day , the German @-@ installed interim Croatian government called on all Croats to stop fighting , and in the evening , LI Infantry Corps entered Zagreb and relieved the 14th Panzer Division . In the face of the assault by the 14th Panzer Division , the 4th Army quickly ceased to exist as an operational formation . The disintegration of the 4th Army was caused largely by fifth column activity , as it was involved in little fighting .

 During the night of 9 / 10 April , lead elements of the XLIX Mountain Corps , consisting of the 1st Mountain Division de @-@ trained and crossed the border near Bleiburg and advanced southeast towards Celje , reaching a point about 19 kilometres ( 12 mi ) from the town by evening . Luftwaffe reconnaissance sorties revealed that the main body of the 7th Army was withdrawing towards Zagreb , leaving behind light forces to maintain contact with the German bridgeheads . When it received this information , 2nd Army headquarters ordered LI Corps to form motorised columns to pursue the 7th Army south , but extreme weather conditions and flooding of the Drava at Maribor on 10 April slowed the German pursuit . 
 About 06 : 00 on 11 April , LI Corps recommenced its push south towards Zagreb , with lead elements exiting the mountains northwest of the city in the evening of the same day , while the 1st Mountain Division captured Celje after some hard marching and difficult fighting . Emissaries from the newly formed National Council of Slovenia approached the commander of XLIX Mountain Corps , General der Infanterie Ludwig Kübler to ask for a ceasefire . Also on 11 April , the Italian 2nd Army commenced offensive operations around 12 : 00 , with the XI Corps pushing through Logatec towards Ljubljana , VI Corps advancing in the direction of <unk> , while strong formations attacked south through Fiume towards Kraljevica and towards Lokve . By this stage , the 7th Army was withdrawing , although some units took advantage of existing fortifications to resist . To assist the Italian advance , the Luftwaffe attacked Yugoslav troops in the Ljubljana region , and the 14th Panzer Division , which had captured Zagreb on 10 April , drove west to encircle the withdrawing 7th Army . The Italians faced little resistance , and captured about 30 @,@ 000 Yugoslav troops waiting to surrender near Delnice . 
 = = = Fate = = = 
 On 10 April , as the situation had become increasingly desperate throughout the country , Dušan Simović , who was both the Prime Minister and Yugoslav Chief of the General Staff , had broadcast the following message : 
 All troops must engage the enemy wherever encountered and with every means at their disposal . Don 't wait for direct orders from above , but act on your own and be guided by your judgement , initiative , and conscience . 
 On 12 April , the 14th Panzer Division linked up with the Italians at Vrbovsko , closing the ring around the remnants of the 7th Army , before thrusting southeast towards Sarajevo . The remaining elements of the 4th Army had organised defences around the towns of Kostajnica , Bosanski Novi , Bihać and Prijedor , but the 14th Panzer Division quickly broke through at Bosanski Novi and captured Banja Luka , and by 14 April it had captured Jajce . In the wake of the panzers , the 183rd Infantry Division pushed through Zagreb and Sisak to capture Kostajnica and Bosanska Gradiška . On 15 April , the 14th Panzer Division was closing on Sarajevo . The Ustaše arrested the staffs of the 1st Army Group , and 4th and 7th Armies at Petrinja , and the 1st Army Group effectively ceased to exist as a formation . After a delay in locating appropriate signatories for the surrender document , the Yugoslav High Command unconditionally surrendered in Belgrade effective at 12 : 00 on 18 April .

 = Open Your Heart ( Madonna song ) = 
 " Open Your Heart " is a song by American singer Madonna from her third studio album True Blue ( 1986 ) . It was released as the album 's fourth single in November 12 , 1986 by Sire Records . It has since appeared remixed on the compilation albums The Immaculate Collection ( 1990 ) and Celebration ( 2009 ) . Originally a rock ' n roll song with the title " Follow Your Heart " , it was written for singer Cyndi Lauper by songwriters Gardner Cole and Peter Rafelson , although it was never played to her . Since Madonna 's management was looking for new songs for True Blue , she accepted it . Madonna altered some of the lyrics and changed the composition to suit the dance @-@ pop genre , giving her a co @-@ writer credit for the song . Lyrically " Open Your Heart " is a love song , talking about innocent feelings of boy @-@ meets @-@ girl romance and Madonna expressing her sexual desire . 
 The song was well received by critics who commended it for being a simple love song . It was also successful commercially , reaching the top @-@ ten of the charts in Belgium , Canada , Ireland , Italy , Netherlands , and the United Kingdom , also reaching the top of Billboard Hot 100 in the United States , thus making it Madonna 's fifth US number @-@ one single . The music video , however , portrayed a different concept of the song . Madonna played an exotic dancer in a peep @-@ show club , who befriends a little boy and subsequently escapes . It was critically acclaimed for portraying a completely opposite perspective of " voyeuristic male gaze and object " , and depicting innocence rather than sexual overtones , although the entry of a child in a strip club was negatively criticized . The video was an homage to actresses Liza Minnelli and Marlene Dietrich . 
 " Open Your Heart " has been performed by Madonna in three of her world tours – 1987 's Who 's That Girl World Tour , 1990 's Blond Ambition World Tour , where Madonna wore her infamous conical bra during the song , and 2012 's The MDNA Tour . The performances were included in the respective video release of the tours . " Open Your Heart " has been covered a number of times by different artists , and appeared in the Britney Spears film , Crossroads ( 2002 ) .

 " Open Your Heart " was originally a rock ' n roll song with the title " Follow Your Heart " and had been written for singer Cyndi Lauper by songwriters Gardner Cole and Peter Rafelson , although it was never played to her . The Temptations were also considered for the song . Their manager Benny Medina decided that they wanted to record the song after all , but upon hearing that Madonna had already recorded it , changed their mind . The original title according to Cole , was from a local health food restaurant called Follow Your Heart in Canoga Park , California , where he was in love with a waitress named Lisa and she was the original inspiration for the lyrics . In Fred Bronson 's book The Billboard Book of Number 1 Hits , Cole explained , 
 " Peter and I usually write very quickly . It 's usually a day or two a song , but for some reason this didn 't really hit us as a hit song . We didn 't give up on it . We just kept working on it over the course of a year . Thank God we did . [ ... ] It was the first song that was cut on the True Blue album . It made me nervous as a writer , because a lot of times the very first song that gets cut doesn 't make it in the long run . But the song ended up making the album , which really opened up a lot of doors for me . " 
 Cole 's manager Bennett Freed was working with Madonna 's management and they were looking for new material for her album . Three of Cole 's songs were chosen for reviewing , including " Open Your Heart " . Madonna 's manager Freddy DeMann overheard the song and thought it would be a hit for Madonna and he asked Cole to re @-@ demo a female demo version . Her female backup singer , Donna De Lory was Cole 's girlfriend and he immediately asked her to sing the demo . Despite the fact that it did not fit exactly with the choice and genre of songs Madonna was singing at that time , she nevertheless accepted it . Madonna recorded " Open Your Heart " , altered the lyrics thus earning a co @-@ writing credit , and along with Patrick Leonard added a bassline underneath the song which turned it into a rock @-@ dance track rather than the original rock ' n roll genre . The song was the first recorded cut for the True Blue album in late 1985 and ultimately made it to the final released tracklist . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Open Your Heart " has a continuous percussion filled structure and a chorus sounding like Belinda Carlisle , according to author Rikky Rooksby in his book The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna . Lyrically , " Open Your Heart " is a simple love song . The song speaks of earnest innocent notions of boy meets girl kind of feelings . According to Professor Mavis Tsai , the phrase " Open Your Heart " is a metaphor for the act of being vulnerable that corresponds to the behavior involved in developing an intimate or close relationship . The following lines in the song , " Open Your Heart , I 'll make you love me ; It 's not that hard , if you just turn the key " illustrate this metaphor vividly . The concept of the song places Madonna as a victim of love . 
 The lyrics puts Madonna in a more direct position expressing her sexual desires for her man according to author Santiago Fouz @-@ Hernández in the line " If you gave me half a chance you 'd see ; My desire burning inside of me . " According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing , " Open Your Heart " is written in the time signature of common time with a medium funk tempo of 112 beats per minute . It is composed in the key of F major with Madonna 's voice spanning from A3 to B ♭ 4 . The song follows a basic sequence of F – E ♭ 9 – E ♭ / G – Gm7 – F as its chord progression .

 Author Susan McClary in Culture / power / history reviewed the song saying that , it was more upbeat than previous single " Live to Tell " and " the play with closure in ' Open Your Heart ' creates the image of open ended jouissance — an erotic energy that continually escapes containment " . Author Taraborrelli called it as one of her most " earnest " songs and compared it with Aretha Franklin 's song " Respect " as well as Barbra Streisand 's " A House is Not a Home " . According to him " it was a tune people could understand and latch on to , which is what makes a pop song memorable " . The New York Times writer Stephen Holden compared the song with sweeter post @-@ Motown valentine songs . Houston Chronicle writer Joey Guerra called the song " perfect " for dancefloor strut . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called it a perfect dance song with deepened dance grooves . Slant Magazine named the song as one of Madonna 's most " robust " songs . Robert Christgau said of the song , " I 'm not saying her flair is <unk> — the generosity she demands in the inexhaustible ' Open Your Heart ' is a two @-@ way street and then some . "

 = = Music video = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 The music video was shot at Echo Park in Los Angeles , California . Madonna portrays an exotic dancer who befriends a young boy , played by child actor Felix Howard . This video was originally set to be directed by Madonna 's then @-@ husband Sean Penn , but in the end the final honors went to Jean @-@ Baptiste Mondino , who went on to work with Madonna on her videos for " Justify My Love " ( 1990 ) , " Human Nature " ( 1995 ) , " Love Don 't Live Here Anymore " ( 1996 ) , " Don 't Tell Me " ( 2000 ) and " Hollywood " ( 2003 ) . The video was shot in July 1986 and was released in December 1986 . It was produced by David Naylor . The video was nominated for three MTV Video Music Awards in 1987 . In the Best Female Video category , " Open Your Heart " lost to another Madonna video , when the music video for " Papa Don 't Preach " won the award . The video has been ranked at number 35 on VH1 's " 50 Sexiest Video Moments " of all time . 
 The video is structured as a cinematic peep show and voyeurism that portrays Madonna as a stripper . According to Mondino , the peep show was his idea since at that time , " we were into a period where we were experimenting [ with ] some kind of freedom about the body , about sexuality and stuff " . He wanted to have a " naive and sweet " feel with the portrayal of a boy waiting outside for Madonna . They built the set from scratch , including the frontal part with the ticket booth . Although it looked fake , Mondino liked it saying " I like the <unk> of it . I haven 't seen it for a long time , but when I saw it once again , I said , ' It 's so naïve ' . It 's kind of badly done , which I like , compared to today . We didn 't have the same equipment , people are more skillful today , but there 's something sweet about it . " Madonna was initially asked by him to wear a black wig , and the initial reaction to the whole wardrobe was positive . But Madonna wanted Mondino 's opinion on the whole ensemble , who replied that she would look better as a blonde . So the wig was kept for the initial scenes of the video only . 
 = = = Synopsis and analysis = = = 
 The " Open Your Heart " music video presents an early version of Madonna 's musings about her Italian @-@ American heritage and focus on her <unk> street theology , which was also explicitly brought out by 1987 's Who 's That Girl World Tour . It starts with the little boy trying to go inside a peep show , where Madonna is the star performer , but gets rebuffed by an old man at the ticket booth . Inside Madonna starts singing the song from the center of a carousel that revolves to display her to the gaze of the customers who are sitting safely in their cubicles . Madonna is dressed in a black bustier , spike heels , fishnets , revealing her new slimmed down body at that time . She begins the video wearing a black wig which she subsequently removes , revealing her short bleached hair . The bluish and dark lighting reveals her look as a mix of actresses Marlene Dietrich in the movie The Blue Angel as well as Liza Minnelli as the character Sally Bowles in the Bob Fosse @-@ directed musical film , Cabaret . 
 The dancing is restrained with a single prop : that of a solitary chair . At one point in the first segment of the video , she is filmed dancing but the camera is almost still and the motions of the dance are confined within the small range of the camera . As the screens inside the viewing booths open and close , the camera slices the shots of Madonna each with its own angle and duration . The same imagery is exhibited by the little boy outside who tries to frame Madonna 's playbill image into different angles . There are four other men in the booths who are made of wood with paintings of artist Tamara de Lempicka on them . Madonna at one point takes off her gloves like Rita Hayworth in Gilda and points towards one of the wooden paintings . It collapses and she blows on her finger . 
 The video is similar in thematic content to Mötley Crüe 's video for the single " Girls , Girls , Girls " . But in contrast , this video tells the story from Madonna 's point of view . She looks down into the cubicles to make eye contact with the men but they are unable to return it . She also looks assertively into the camera , making eye contact with the viewer . With these scenes Madonna portrays her holding power over the men and the ability to pursue them . Madonna represents an assertive woman searching for a lover who can accept her as a human being . Author Bruce Forbes notes that the men in the cubicles are proved unworthy of her and there is an undertone of mockery when Madonna addresses them as ' baby ' while shaking her body . 
 By the end of the video the isolated and sad men depart with the doors closing on them . As the final chorus breaks into dance grooves , Madonna comes out of the theater and gives the boy a quick kiss on his lips . Both are clad in loose @-@ fitting gray suits , which gives Madonna an androgynous look . They stroll away playfully in the sunrise , reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin and Jack Coogan in The Kid with the old boss pursuing them and shouting " Come back , come back , we still need you " in Italian . The tension between the visual and the musical dimensions of the video is extremely unsettling according to author Nicholas B. Dirks . Only when she disappears from the carousel and reappears to run away from her patriarchal boss with the young boy , then the music and visuals become comparable . 
 = = = Reception = = = 
 Feminist writer Susan Bordo gave a negative review of the video , saying that the leering and pathetic men in the cubicles and Madonna 's escape with the boy is " cynically and mechanically tacked on [ as ] a way of claiming trendy status for what is just cheesecake – or , perhaps , pornography " . MTV also had some reservations initially before airing the video , which was later resolved after a meeting with Warner Officials . However socio @-@ critic Mary Harron in her book <unk> : Pop as Commodity said that the underlying message in the video is that though Madonna sells sexuality , she is free . There is no overt representation of anything besides friendship with the boy . Their escape together avoids Madonna the sexual overtones that would have been stronger if she would have escaped with an adult male . This , according to author Richard Dienst , seems to suggest a repudiation of the adult labor of the stage in favor of childhood , androgyny , authenticity and nomadic play . The video is also acclaimed for reviving and re @-@ creating the hard glamor of the studio @-@ era of Hollywood stars and also for representing women as the dominant sex . Author Donn Welton pointed out that the usual power relationship between the " voyeuristic male gaze and object " is destabilized by the portrayal of the male patrons of the peep show as leering and pathetic . At the same time , the portrayal of Madonna as " porno queen object " is deconstructed by the escape at the end of the video . Maura Johnston from Rolling Stone found influences of the work of Italian film director Federico Fellini and American musical theater <unk> Bob Fosse .

 " Open Your Heart " has been featured as a full song in the set lists of three Madonna tours – 1987 's Who 's That Girl World Tour , 1990 's Blond Ambition World Tour , and 2012 's The MDNA Tour . It served as the opening song on 1987 Who 's That Girl Tour . It started off with then young dancer Chris Finch , imitating Felix Howard from the video . Howard did not receive a working license for the tour hence Finch was taken for his part . He went on to become an integral part of most of the songs performed on the tour . After Finch , two other dancers are introduced , before Madonna herself appears on stage . She wore the same black pointy corset and fishnets as in the music video . She first sings the song alone , then Finch joins her again and they dance together till the song ends . Two different performances of the song on this tour can be found on the videos : Who 's That Girl : Live in Japan , filmed in Tokyo , Japan , on June 22 , 1987 , and Ciao Italia : Live from Italy , filmed in Turin , Italy , on September 4 , 1987 . 
 On the Blond Ambition World Tour , " Open Your Heart " follows the opening number " Express Yourself " . This time , it included a hunky dancer watching from a distance as Madonna entered the stage with her hair stretched into a topknot and fake blond ponytail , which was replaced by short peroxide tangles in the European leg of the tour . She wore a double breasted suit with the outer jacket cut in slits so that the conical bra underneath could point through . Showing off the satin pink bodysuit and her monocle chain , Madonna performed the song on a chair . Playing a dominatrix role , Madonna got on top of one of the dancers before carrying off an exhibitionist dance routine with the chair as a prop . Two different performances were taped and released on video , the Blond Ambition Japan Tour 90 , taped in Yokohama , Japan , on April 27 , 1990 , and the Blond Ambition World Tour Live , taped in Nice , France , on August 5 , 1990 . 
 The opening musical introduction of the song served as a brief twenty @-@ six seconds musical interlude on the Drowned World Tour in 2001 . As Madonna finished a performance of " Frozen " in the Geisha inspired segment of the show , she sat in a cross @-@ legged position in front of the stage . The musical intro for " Open Your Heart " would start with a dancer in a Japanese costume dancing behind her on a raised podium . As the music ends , Madonna starts singing " Nobody 's Perfect " from her 2000 album Music . In 2008 , Madonna sang the first verse and chorus at two dates — Las Vegas and East Rutherford — of her Sticky & Sweet Tour . Madonna forgot the lyrics at the Vegas show and refused to sing the song in Boston ; she performed " Express Yourself " instead . 
 Madonna also performed an excerpt of the song at the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show in 2012 , where she was joined by Cee Lo Green and by a large marching band . The same year , the song was included on The MDNA Tour . Following an 8 @-@ minute monologue against intolerance , the song was reinvented and performed in a Basque , folk acoustic version , relying only on drums , which were played by the Basque band Kalakan , and Madonna 's vocal harmony . Madonna 's outfit during the performance consisted of an all @-@ leather look , a custom design by Hervé Léger and Max Azria , with knee @-@ high boots and a mini fur bolero , while her dancers were dressed as soldiers . Towards the end of the performance Madonna proceeded to dance and engage in a sing @-@ along with the members of the audience . On certain shows , her son Rocco Ritchie joined her onstage . Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented that the performances of " Open Your Heart " and " Like a Prayer " were a reminder that " ... for both Madonna and her fans , it always comes back to the music " . The performance of the song at the November 19 – 20 , 2012 shows in Miami , at the American Airlines Arena , were recorded and released in Madonna 's fourth live album , MDNA World Tour . On January 26 , 2014 , Madonna performed " Open Your Heart " and " Same Love " at the 56th Grammy Awards along with Macklemore , Ryan Lewis and Mary Lambert , in support of gay and lesbian rights . During the Rebel Heart Tour in Manchester , in December 2015 , Madonna performed an a cappella version of " Open Your Heart " . 
 = = Cover versions = = 
 Despite being originally written in English , a Spanish version of the song titled " Abre Tu Corazón " was recorded by Venezuelan rock singer Melissa , who released it in March 1986 on her " Melissa III " album . Considering Madonna first released the song on the " True Blue " album three months afterwards , Melissa 's " Abre Tu Corazón " can be considered the first released version of the song , although it is possible that Madonna 's version ( for which she received a co @-@ writer 's credit ) was recorded first . The Madonna tribute compilation Virgin Voices : A Tribute To Madonna , Vol . 2 contained a cover by the late Israeli singer Ofra Haza . A eurodance version was recorded by the group Mad 'House for the album " Absolutely Mad " . A hi @-@ NRG dance version was recorded by Who 's That Girl for the album Exposed , released through Almighty Records . In 2004 Platinum Blonde NRG , Vol . 2 : <unk> Madonna Classics , a hi @-@ NRG cover is performed by In @-@ Deep . The song appears in the opening of the 2002 film Crossroads . Britney Spears ' character lip syncs to the song in her room with a brush in her hand , pretending its a microphone . A Madonna poster is visible during the scene . In 2010 , the TV show Glee covered it in the episode " The Power of Madonna " as a mash @-@ up with the song " Borderline " , performed by Cory Monteith and Lea Michele .

 = Red Rackham 's Treasure = 
 Red Rackham 's Treasure ( French : Le Trésor de Rackham le Rouge ) is the twelfth volume of The Adventures of Tintin , the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé . The story was serialised daily in Le Soir , Belgium 's leading francophone newspaper , from February to September 1943 amidst the German occupation of Belgium during World War II . Completing an arc begun in The Secret of the Unicorn , the story tells of young reporter Tintin and his friend Captain Haddock as they launch an expedition to the Caribbean to locate the treasure of the pirate Red Rackham . 
 Red Rackham 's Treasure was a commercial success and was published in book form by Casterman the year following its conclusion . Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with The Seven Crystal Balls , while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco @-@ Belgian comics tradition . Red Rackham 's Treasure has been cited as one of the most important installments in the series for marking the first appearance of eccentric scientist Cuthbert Calculus , who subsequently became a core character . The story has been variously adapted for both the 1957 Belvision animated series , Hergé 's Adventures of Tintin , and for the 1991 animated series The Adventures of Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana , as well as for the feature film The Adventures of Tintin : The Secret of the Unicorn ( 2011 ) . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 The synopsis continues a plot begun in The Secret of the Unicorn . 
 Tintin and his friend Captain Haddock plan an expedition to the West Indies aboard a fishing trawler , the Sirius , to search for the treasure of the pirate Red Rackham . Having previously read three parchments authored by Haddock 's ancestor , Sir Francis Haddock , the duo had discovered the coordinates to what they believe is the treasure aboard the sunken 17th century vessel , the Unicorn . An eccentric , hard @-@ of @-@ hearing inventor named Professor Cuthbert Calculus offers to aid them with the use of his shark @-@ shaped one @-@ man submarine , but they decline his assistance . Setting sail , they are joined by the police detectives Thomson and Thompson and soon discover that Calculus has stowed away on board , bringing his submarine with him . 
 When they reach the coordinates shown on the parchments , there is no wreckage in sight . Frustrated , Haddock ponders turning back , but Tintin soon realizes the problem : If Sir Francis had used a French instead of an English chart to calculate the position , the coordinates would have been measured on the Paris Meridian rather than the Greenwich Meridian . As they have been using the Greenwich Meridian , they realise that they are too far west . 
 After traveling to the correct position , they discover an unknown island . There , they find a statue of Sir Francis Haddock and other evidence ; Tintin deduces that Francis Haddock had taken refuge on the island and that the wreck of the Unicorn must be nearby . They locate the wreck using Calculus ' submarine and recover various artefacts from it , but do not find the treasure . Among the artefacts is a strongbox containing old documents revealing that Sir Francis Haddock had been the owner of the country estate Marlinspike Hall . Back in Belgium , Calculus purchases the Hall using funds from the sale of his submarine design , and gives it to Haddock . Tintin and Haddock search the house 's cellars , where Tintin spots a statue of Saint John the Evangelist holding a cross with a globe and eagle at its feet . Tintin suddenly remembers that Francis Haddock 's original three parchments said , " For ' tis from the light that light will dawn , and then shines forth the Eagle 's cross " and realises that this message referred , not to the location of the Unicorn , but to Saint John " the eagle " : his traditional symbol . Tintin locates the island on the globe , presses a secret button he finds there , and discovers Red Rackham 's treasure hidden inside .

 = = = Background = = = 
 Amidst the German occupation of Belgium during World War II , Hergé had accepted a position working for Le Soir , Belgian 's largest French @-@ language daily newspaper . Confiscated from its original owners , Le Soir was permitted by the German authorities to reopen under the directorship of Belgian editor Raymond de Becker , although it remained firmly under Nazi control , supporting the German war effort and espousing anti @-@ Semitism . After joining Le Soir on 15 October 1940 , Hergé became editor of its new children 's supplement Le Soir Jeunesse , with the help of an old friend , Paul Jamin , and the cartoonist Jacques Van Melkebeke , before paper shortages forced Tintin to be serialised daily in the main pages of Le Soir . Some Belgians were upset that Hergé was willing to work for a newspaper controlled by the occupying Nazi administration , although he was heavily enticed by the size of Le Soir 's readership , which numbered some 600 @,@ 000 . Faced with the reality of Nazi oversight , Hergé abandoned the overt political themes that had pervaded much of his earlier work , instead adopting a policy of neutrality . Entertainment producer and author Harry Thompson observed that , without the need to satirise political types , " Hergé was now concentrating more on plot and on developing a new style of character comedy . The public reacted positively . " 
 Red Rackham 's Treasure was to be the second half of a series of connected events in two parts which had begun with the previous adventure , The Secret of the Unicorn . This two @-@ part series was the first that Hergé had produced since Cigars of the Pharaoh and The Blue Lotus ( 1934 – 36 ) . However , as Tintin expert Michael Farr related , whereas Cigars of the Pharaoh and The Blue Lotus had been largely " self @-@ sufficient and self @-@ contained " , the connection between The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham 's Treasure was to be far closer . 
 = = = Influences = = = 
 Red Rackham 's Treasure introduced Professor Cuthbert Calculus to The Adventures of Tintin , who became a recurring character . Hergé had made use of various eccentric professors in earlier volumes of the series , such as Sophocles Sarcophagus in Cigars of the Pharaoh , Hector Alembick in King Ottokar 's Sceptre , and Decimus Phostle in The Shooting Star , all of whom prefigure the arrival of Calculus . The character 's deafness had been inspired by a colleague whom Hergé had worked with years earlier at Le Vingtième Siècle . Visually , Calculus was based on a real scientist , the Swiss inventor Auguste Piccard , who had been the first man to explore the stratosphere in a hot air balloon in 1931 . Hergé had observed Piccard walking about Brussels on a number of occasions , however the character of Calculus would be notably much shorter than Piccard . Hergé named this character Tryphon Tournesol ; while the surname meant " sunflower " , the forename was adopted from a carpenter named Tryphon <unk> whom Hergé had encountered in Boitsfort . Tryphon Tournesol was later renamed Cuthbert Calculus in the English translation and Balduin <unk> ( meaning " Little Bee " ) for the German translation . 
 Calculus ' shark @-@ shaped submarine was visually based on a real American submarine ; Hergé had seen a picture of this in a German newspaper . The diving suit worn in the story was also based on clippings that Hergé had accumulated . Similarly , the dockside bar depicted by the cartoonist was based on an illustration that he had collected . The shop where Haddock and Tintin buy the diving equipment , including the suit , was inspired from a picture of a bar which was featured in the German magazine , Berliner <unk> Zeitung . The tribal effigy found on a Caribbean island by Sir Francis Haddock was based on a <unk> tribal statue from Cameroon that Hergé saw in a museum . The Sirius , which had appeared before in The Shooting Star , was named after the SS Sirius , the first ship to cross the Atlantic Ocean solely under steam power , but was visually based upon the design of a trawler , the John @-@ <unk> Hergé had sketched this ship in Ostend docks before obtaining both detailed plans of the trawler from the builders , Jos <unk> & Son , and a small @-@ scale model of it from a collector . The undersea wreck of the Unicorn was loosely inspired by images of the wreck of a 17th @-@ century Swedish vessel , the Vasa , which Hergé had collected . The instance in the story in which a shark swallows a large box ( that the characters hope contains the treasure ) is based on a real account of a shark that swallowed a camera from the American underwater photographer Otis Barton , which Hergé had encountered in a French illustrated magazine . 
 The brief appearance of Dr. <unk> , who warns Haddock to cease drinking alcohol , was an allusion to Hergé 's own physician , Dr. <unk> . Hergé made a comical reference to the French comedian Sacha Guitry in the story by advertising a play by Guitry titled Me in which Guitry himself plays every role . The adventure was the first to depict Tintin wearing a white shirt under a blue sweater ; this would go on to become the character 's iconic costume .

 Le Trésor De Rackham Le Rouge began serialisation as a daily strip in Le Soir from 19 February 1943 . The title of the new adventure had been announced in an advertisement in the newspaper two days previously . In Belgium , it was then published in a 62 @-@ page book format by Editions Casterman in 1944 . Red Rackham 's Treasure contained one of Hergé 's two favourite illustrations from The Adventures of Tintin . It combines three actions encapsulating a sequence of events into one drawing : Haddock striding up the beach in the foreground , the rowboat being brought ashore in the middle ground , and the Sirius weighing anchor in the background . 
 Rather than immediately embark on the creation of a new Tintin adventure , Hergé agreed to a proposal that Le Soir 's crime writer , Paul Kinnet , would author a detective story featuring Thomson and Thompson . The story was titled Dupont et Dupond , détectives ( Thomson and Thompson , Detectives ) , and was illustrated by Hergé . 
 The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham 's Treasure were the first two Adventures of Tintin to be published in English @-@ language translations for the British market . Published by Casterman , these two editions did not sell well , and have since become rare collector 's items . They would be republished for the British market seven years later , this time by Methuen with translations provided by Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale @-@ Cooper . Farr reported that Red Rackham 's Treasure is the best @-@ selling story in The Adventures of Tintin , while Harry Thompson referred to The Secret of the Unicorn @-@ Red Rackham 's Treasure arc as " the most successful of all Tintin 's adventures " . 
 = = Critical analysis = = 
 Harry Thompson stated that the Secrets of the Unicorn @-@ Red Rackham 's Treasure arc marked the beginning of the third and central stage of " Tintin 's career " . He furthermore stated that in these two stories , Tintin has been converted from a reporter into an explorer to cope with the new political climate . He stated that in this story , Hergé " abandons the complex plotting of The Secret of the Unicorn in favour of an episodic style of adventure not seen since the early books " . Thompson further draws attention to the arrival of Calculus in the story , describing him as the " third and final member " of Tintin 's " family " . Thompson was critical of the use of colour in the story , stating that much of it looks better in black @-@ and @-@ white , as it was originally printed in Le Soir . 
 Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters observed that both The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham 's Treasure " hold a crucial position " in The Adventures of Tintin as it establishes the " Tintin universe " with its core set of characters . He felt that while religious elements had been present in previous stories , they were even stronger in The Secret of the Unicorn and its sequel , something which he attributed to Van Melkebeke 's influence . Peeters believed that Red Rackham 's Treasure was " an unforgettable book " because it is the volume in which the " family " — meaning Tintin , Snowy , Haddock , and Calculus — all come together . Fellow biographer Pierre Assouline echoed this idea , noting that Hergé had " settled " the three characters in their new home . Focusing on the character of Calculus , he noted that the idea of the eccentric professor was " so universal that it would be inaccurate to point to any one source " , suggesting possible influences from Charlie Chaplin and Hergé 's own father . For Assouline , the professor embodies " the gentle madness and subtle humour in comic strips " . He added that both Red Rackham 's Treasure and its predecessor " reveal Hergé at a new level in his art " , and suggested that the reason for their popularity lay in the fact that they were " the visual continuation of a literary universe that stretches from Jules Verne to Pierre Benoit " . 
 Jean @-@ Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier opined that The Secret of the Unicorn @-@ Red Rackham 's Treasure arc represents " a turning point " for the series as it shifts the reader 's attention from Tintin to Haddock , who has become " by far , the most interesting character " . They claim that the introduction of Calculus " completes the indispensable triangle that imbues Tintin with its mythic quality . " Asserting that here , Hergé 's " art has reached a degree of near @-@ perfection " , they awarded it five stars out of five . 
 Michael Farr said that the scene introducing Calculus was " a comic tour de force " marking the start of the " rich vein of humour " that the character brought to the series . Noting that unlike The Shooting Star , this two @-@ book story arc contains " scarcely an allusion to occupation and war " , he praised the arc 's narrative as " perfectly paced , without that feeling of haste " present in some of Hergé 's earlier work . 
 In his psychoanalytical study of the Adventures of Tintin , the academic Jean @-@ Marie Apostolidès characterised the Secret of the Unicorn @-@ Red Rackham 's Treasure arc as being about the characters going on a " treasure hunt that turns out to be at the same time a search for their roots . " He stated that the arc revolves around Haddock 's ancestry , and in doing so " deals with the meanings of symbolic relations within personal life " . Highlighting that Calculus was one of many eccentric scientists to have appeared in the series , he nonetheless emphasises his difference by noting that Calculus approaches Tintin , rather than Tintin approaching him , as the young reporter had done with previous scientists . Commenting on the introduction of Calculus ' shark submarine , he states that it " allows them to cross a boundary previously restricting human beings and to penetrate into another universe , the one beneath the seas that holds secrets hitherto unknown . " Ultimately , he believes that by the end of the story , " the family structure is in place " , with Calculus representing a father figure with financial control , and Haddock and Tintin , who have become brothers through their joint adventure , adding that with the aid of Francis Haddock , " the ancestor " , they are given a home at Marlinspike Hall . 
 Literary critic Tom McCarthy highlighted what he perceived as scenes in Red Rackham 's Treasure which reflected common themes in The Adventures of Tintin . He pointed out that in being a stowaway aboard the ship , Calculus was one of many stowaways in the series , and that the treasure represented the theme of jewels and precious stones which also cropped up in The Broken Ear , Tintin in the Congo , and The Castafiore Emerald . He noted Tintin 's misreading of the parchments and stated this was one of a number of calculation mistakes that the character makes in the series . He suggested that a scene in which the shark submarine pushes between Haddock 's buttocks was a form of sexual innuendo referencing anal sex , highlighting similar innuendo in The Broken Ear and The Crab with the Golden Claws .

 In 1991 , a collaboration between the French studio Ellipse and the Canadian animation company Nelvana adapted 21 of the stories into a series of episodes , each 42 minutes long . Red Rackham 's Treasure was the tenth episode of The Adventures of Tintin to be produced , although it ran half as long as most of the others . Directed by Stéphane Bernasconi , the series has been praised for being " generally faithful " , with compositions having been actually directly taken from the panels in the original comic book .

 Coldplay vocalist Chris Martin said , about the writing of the song , " That came out of playing live and wanting to have something with a bit more bounce . We were really getting into things like PJ Harvey and Muse – things with a bit more energy . " 
 When asked about the development of the song , during a track @-@ by @-@ track reveal , bassist Guy Berryman said : 
 When we came to record it in the studio we struggled because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn 't happy about where we 'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn 't put our finger on what it was and so it was a really nice day one day , me and Chris were just trying , I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff . Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove , which stays on the same note as opposed to change , it 's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way . It was a bit mechanical before and it 's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song . It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn 't get on the record but it 's now one of our favourite tracks .

 The song features an acoustic and electric guitar sound . The song starts with a hushed acoustic ballad , the song then builds into a roar of an electric guitar and soaring with vocals . The song also includes an uptempo metronomic drumming rhythm . 
 The first line of the third verse allude to a definitive moment with the cryptic reference to God : " Now when you work it out , I 'm worse than you / Yeah , when you work it out I wanted to / Now , when you work out where to draw the line / Your guess is as good as mine . " Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune commented that the lyric " God gave you style and gave you grace , " Martin sings as if " cataloguing the attributes he only wishes he had " . When the song is performed live , guitarist Jonny Buckland begins a long ripping off guitar riff while Chris Martin plays an acoustic guitar .

 = = History = = 
 M @-@ 66 was first signed along a roadway by July 1 , 1919 between M @-@ 16 ( now M @-@ 21 ) at Lowell and M @-@ 46 near Lakeview . The designation was extended in 1925 along M @-@ 46 to Six Lakes and then north to M @-@ 13 ( now US 131 ) in Lodi . A further extension north from Lodi in 1929 or 1930 along M @-@ 131 to Mancelona , a short segment of M @-@ 88 and north to US 31 in Charlevoix . The southern end was extended to US 16 south of Lowell by 1931 . A section of the northern extension was marked on maps through 1933 as " under construction " . That section was cancelled in favor of another routing near Mancelona . A short bypass of Six Lakes added about a mile to the length of the roadway in 1936 . The M @-@ 131 concurrency was switched to a US 131 concurrency when the latter was extended in 1939 . This concurrency was shortened just before World War II when the Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) rerouted US 131 along a new road between South Boardman and Kalkaska . 
 The MSHD completed a major rerouting of M @-@ 66 around 1944 – 45 . The M @-@ 14 designation of the time was decommissioned and replaced with M @-@ 66 . Starting at Six Lakes , M @-@ 66 turned west along M @-@ 46 instead of east and then turned south through Stanton and Ionia ending north of Battle Creek . The highway between Lowell and Lakeview was redesignated as M @-@ 91 . A minor realignment in late 1950 removed two 90 ° curves near the Osceola – Missaukee county line and replaced them with a pair of sweeping curves . 
 The MSHD rerouted M @-@ 66 between Maple Grove and Nashville in mid @-@ 1953 . In the changes , M @-@ 79 was extended along the new route of M @-@ 66 and then over M @-@ 214 to Hastings . M @-@ 66 was shifted off Assyria Road which was turned back to local control . Another realignment in 1954 shifted M @-@ 66 to the modern routing between the M @-@ 43 concurrency termini , removing M @-@ 43 / M @-@ 66 from a section of M @-@ 50 in the process . The final section gravel section of M @-@ 66 , approximately 11 miles ( 18 km ) in length , was paved near Nashville in 1957 . M @-@ 32 was extended along the northernmost section of M @-@ 66 in 1963 . 
 M @-@ 66 was extended southerly from Assyria through Battle Creek to the Indiana state line replacing sections of M @-@ 78 in 1965 . M @-@ 66 turned south and west along M @-@ 60 and new highway to Colon . The segment of former M @-@ 78 not used by M @-@ 66 was transferred to local control . The final section of M @-@ 78 's roadway given to M @-@ 66 extended it all the way to the state line , resulting in a north – south trans @-@ peninsular highway from Lake Michigan near Charlevoix to Indiana . M @-@ 66 is the only such highway to run the length of the Lower Peninsula . The extension allowed the Green Arrow Association to promote the whole length of the Green Arrow Route with a single highway number . The next year , M @-@ 66 was rerouted through Battle Creek to use the completed I @-@ 194 freeway . 
 A 90 ° turn in Missaukee County was removed north of Lake City in 1972 . In late 1973 or early 1974 , M @-@ 66 and M @-@ 72 were shifted around the south side of Kalkaska . Later in 1974 , the M @-@ 32 concurrency was removed when M @-@ 32 was scaled back to its former terminus . A project in 1981 furthered the 1972 realignment in Missaukee County . About 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) were shortened from the routing when the new alignment was built between Smithville and Phelps Road . 
 = = Memorial designations = = 
 To capitalize on the opening of the Mackinac Bridge in 1957 , local leaders in Battle Creek wanted to promote M @-@ 66 as a route north from Indiana to the bridge . They named the highway the Green Arrow Route as part of this marketing strategy . The color was to evoke the forests in the area , and arrow was meant to play on several historical connections . One of these was the Pennsylvania Railroad 's Northern Arrow passenger train that once operated in the area . The official explanation was to tie into the history of Native Americans in the area , but the route was also " straight as an arrow " . The backers also promoted the highway as a direct and scenic route to vacation country in the northern Lower Peninsula , avoiding most of the larger cities in the area . M @-@ 66 was given the Green Arrow Route name in Public Act 170 of 1959 between the Indiana state line and Kalkaska . Despite these efforts , M @-@ 66 failed to attract much traffic . When the Michigan Legislature <unk> the memorial highway names in Public Act 142 of 2001 , the Green Arrow Route was truncated to the northern border of Calhoun County , a change confirmed by Public Act 138 of 2004 . 
 Born Isabella Baumfree in 1797 , Sojourner Truth settled in the Battle Creek area in the 1840s . She travelled through the Midwest and New England speaking against slavery and for women 's rights . She lived in the area until her death in 1883 . Her connection to the state of Michigan was honored by the state American Revolution Bicentennial Commission in 1976 which urged the Michigan Legislature to name a highway in her honor . Public Act 93 of 1976 named all of M @-@ 66 in Calhoun County , including the segment that runs concurrently with I @-@ 194 , as the Sojourner Truth Memorial Highway . The highway was dedicated to her on May 21 , 1976 . 
 The Cereal City Development Corporation ( <unk> ) asked the Legislature to amend the memorial designation in 1993 . They felt that I @-@ 194 / M @-@ 66 was better known to locals as The Penetrator , and they wished to restore emphasis to Truth . They asked for the " Sojourner Truth Downtown Parkway " name to be applied to " M @-@ 66 between Interstate 94 and Hamblin " . The Legislature passed Public Act 208 of 1993 to affect the change , restoring " the link between Sojourner Truth and the City of Battle Creek , which was once the center of abolitionist sentiment in the state .

 = 15th Sustainment Brigade = 
 The 15th Sustainment Brigade was a sustainment brigade of the United States Army based at Fort Bliss , Texas . It provided logistics support to other units of the United States Army , and was subordinate to the 13th Sustainment Command ( Expeditionary ) . It previously had provided support to the 1st Cavalry Division , but now did so for the 1st Armored Division until 12 May 2015 when the 15th Sustainment Brigade became part of the 1st Armored Division and was renamed 1st Armored Division Sustainment Brigade . 
 The brigade 's lineage dates back to 1919 , and it had a long and decorated history when designated as the supply command of the 1st Cavalry Division . Having seen service in every major conflict of the 20th century in support of its parent division , the unit was not designated as the 15th Sustainment Brigade permanently until 2005 . In February 2008 , the brigade was reassigned to the 13th Sustainment Command , ending almost a century of association with the 1st Cavalry Division . 
 The 15th Sustainment Brigade 's extensive lineage also carries many honors for the unit . What is now the 15th Sustainment Brigade , and its previous incarnations , have earned 17 campaign streamers , as well as numerous awards , mostly for service during the Vietnam War . These decorations include the Presidential Unit Citation , the Valorous Unit Award , and five Meritorious Unit Commendations . 
 = = Organization = = 
 The 15th Sustainment Brigade was permanently attached to the 1st Cavalry Division , though it could operate independently when needed . Currently , it falls under the organization of the 1st Armored Division , having relocated as part of the Base Realignment and Closure 2005 . This assignment allows the unit maximum flexibility when deployed , as it can provide any support function needed , without being permanently attached to any particular unit or area of operations . 
 The unit has two permanently assigned battalions along with its Headquarters and Headquarters Company ( HHC ) . They consist of the 15th Special Troops Battalion , and the 142nd Combat Sustainment Support Battalion which are also headquartered at Fort Bliss , Texas . 72nd Brigade Support Battalion inactivated in November 2014 , in conjunction with inactivation of 212th Fires Brigade ( United States ) in July 2014 . In addition , Company A , 125th Brigade Support Battalion ( formerly with 3rd BCT ) , in conjunction with the inactivation of 3rd BCT , completed a high @-@ visibility project : Company A produced the first Redistribution Property Accountability Team ( <unk> ) yard in the continental US , which gives commanders a clear picture of property redistribution , especially during a unit 's closure . The brigade command is modular in design , allowing it to assume command of additional units when deployed . The command is preparing for deployment to Southwest Asia in 2015 .

 = = = Origins = = = 
 The 15th Sustainment Brigade was originally constituted on 4 May 1966 in the Regular Army as a Headquarters and Headquarters Company . It was first activated on 1 July 1966 . 
 On 20 October 1967 , the Brigade was inactivated after providing support to units in Vietnam , only to be reactivated on 21 September 1968 at Fort Lewis , Washington . The Brigade later inactivated at Fort Lewis on 21 March 1973 having received campaign credits for its support for <unk> Operations ( Phase II and III ) in Vietnam . 
 As mentioned above , the 15th Sustainment Brigade replaced the “ Division Support Command ” of the 1st Cavalry Division . The history of the organization can be traced back to 1919 when one of its present units , the 15th Forward Support Battalion , existed as the 615th Motor Transport Company . The Division Support Command ( DISCOM ) thus predated the 1st Cavalry Division itself , which was not established until 1921 . 
 In the years before World War II , most of the units of the 1st Cavalry Division that were not assigned to larger unit commands were under the control of the Headquarters , Division Special Troops of the division ; an independent unit for various supporting units for a division . These included the service and support elements of the division . After World War II , however , the Special Troops Headquarters was reorganized into Headquarters , Division Trains . This designation immediately predates the " Division Support Command " ( DISCOM ) designation . The division trains were activated 1 November 1957 in Korea . Although a new organization , 1st Cavalry Division 's Division Trains employed concepts and tactics similar to those of U.S. armored division trains that were originated in World War I. 
 = = = Vietnam War = = = 
 On 1 September 1963 , Headquarters , Division Trains was reorganized under the " <unk> " ( Reorganization of the Army Divisions ) plan and redesignated as Headquarters , Headquarters Company and Band , 1st Cavalry Division , 1st Cavalry Division Support Command . Accompanying the division to Vietnam in August 1965 , the Support Command participated in all of the same campaigns that the division did , providing logistics support for the 1st Cavalry Division throughout the entire conflict . 
 The unit 's first major operation was the Pleiku Campaign . During this action , the command supported the division during 35 days of continuous airmobile operations . The opening battle of the campaign , the Battle of Ia Drang Valley , was described in the book We Were Soldiers Once ... And Young which was also the basis of the subsequent Mel Gibson film We Were Soldiers . 
 For most of 1967 and early 1968 , the formation supported the 1st Cavalry Division through Operation Pershing . This was a large scale search of areas under the jurisdiction of the US II Corps which , according to the US Army , saw 5 @,@ 400 enemy killed and 2 @,@ 000 captured . The division re @-@ deployed to Camp Evans , north of Hue in the I Corps Tactical Zone , during the 1968 Tet Offensive It was involved in recapturing Quang Tri and Hue regions . After intense fighting in Hue , the division then moved to relieve US Marine Corps units besieged at the Khe Sanh combat base in Operation Pegasus through March 1968 . The 1st Cavalry Division next conducted major clearing operations in the <unk> Valley from mid @-@ April through mid @-@ May 1968 . From May until September 1968 , the division participated in local pacification missions , as well as Medical outreach programs intended to offer medical support to the Vietnamese local population . During this time , the division and support command were assigned to I Corps . 
 In the autumn of 1968 , the 1st Cavalry Division relocated south to the III Corps Tactical Zone northwest of Saigon , adjacent to a Cambodian region commonly referred to as the " Parrots Beak " , due to its shape . In May 1970 , the division was among U.S. units participating in the Cambodian Incursion , withdrawing from Cambodia on 29 June . The division thereafter took a defensive posture while the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam continued . The bulk of the division was withdrawn on 29 April 1971 . 
 The Division Support Command received all of the same honors as the division headquarters throughout the conflict . These awards included the Presidential Unit Citation for the actions in Pleiku Province and the Valorous Unit Award for action in the “ Parrots Beak ” area of Cambodia ( referred to as the " Fish Hook " area in the unit 's award streamer ) . In addition , Support Command received three Meritorious Unit Commendations and four Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry awards throughout the deployments . 
 On 15 May 1971 , the DISCOM was reorganized and designated as Headquarters and Headquarters Company , 1st Cavalry Division Support Command . Most major subordinate units of the DISCOM had returned from Vietnam in 1971 and were stationed at Fort Hood . By the end of June 1971 , the DISCOM was a large command composed of HHC , Support Command , 15th Adjutant General Company / Band , 15th Medical Battalion , 15th Supply and Transport Battalion , 27th Maintenance Battalion , 8th Engineer Battalion , 315th Composite Support Battalion , 15th Finance Company ( the latter two units had been transferred from the 1st Armored Division ) , and the 15th Data Processing Unit .

 During the early 1980s , the DISCOM consisted of a Headquarters Company , a Division Materiel Management Center , a Division Data Center , the 15th Medical Battalion , 15th Adjutant General Battalion , 15th Finance Company , 15th Supply and Transport Battalion , 27th Maintenance Battalion and the 68th Chemical Company . In October 1984 , the 1st and 2nd Forward Support Battalions were activated from elements of the three functional battalions attached to the unit . The following year saw the Army of Excellence Reorganization ( AOE ) transform the remaining elements of the three functional battalions ( maintenance , medical , and supply and transport ) into the 4th Main Support Battalion . The AOE reorganization also added the <unk> Transportation Company ( Aircraft Maintenance ) to the Division Support Command . The forward and main support battalions , along with the Aviation Maintenance Company , were redesignated in 1987 , becoming the 15th and 115th Forward Support Battalions , 27th Main Support Battalion , and 227th Transportation Company ( Aviation Maintenance ) . 
 On 28 September 1990 , the Division Support Command deployed to the Middle East in support of Operation Desert Shield . In January 1991 , Division Support Command provided support to the 1st Cavalry Division throughout Operation Desert Storm , leading to a quick liberation of Kuwait . On 16 December 1991 , the 215th Forward Support Battalion was activated at Fort Hood bringing the number of active duty forward support battalions to three . On 8 July 1996 , the 615th Support Battalion ( Aviation ) was provisionally organized . The battalion was formally activated on 17 September 1996 .

 On 6 July 2005 , the Division Support Command ( DISCOM ) of the 1st Cavalry Division was inactivated and redesignated the 15th Sustainment Brigade . DISCOM ’ s previously subordinate Forward Support Battalions were redesignated Brigade Support Battalions and task organized under their supported maneuver brigade . 
 The 15th Sustainment Brigade was the first element of the 1st Cavalry Division to return to Iraq and assumed control for logistics in the Baghdad area of operations in July 2006 . The Brigade provided command and control for numerous units not normally associated with the 1st Cavalry Division . It had sustained several casualties during its tour in the country , including a mortar attack that killed two soldiers and injured five more in October 2007 . Tasks the unit completed during its 2006 – 2007 tour in Iraq included construction and maintenance of sustainment facilities , and maintaining vehicles , including adding additional armor to Humvee vehicles for other US units operating in the country . 
 The Brigade changed its higher command for the first time in its history on 15 February 2008 . It was reassigned from the 1st Cavalry Division to the 13th Sustainment Command ( Expeditionary ) , holding a mock cavalry charge to celebrate the occasion . This would also mark the first time that the brigade served independently from the 1st Cavalry Division . Since returning from Iraq , the brigade has undertaken a number of duties around Fort Hood . These activities include testing new systems for use during deployments , remodeling infrastructure around the fort , and training on personal safety .

The four leaves of the codex were used as raw material for the production of another manuscript – Codex Guelferbytanus 64 <unk> . It is a palimpsest , and its text was reconstructed several times . Franz Anton Knittel was the first to examine it and decipher its text .

 It is a palimpsest , the whole book is known as Codex Guelferbytanus 64 <unk> . The upper text is in Latin , it contains Isidore of Seville 's <unk> and his six letters . The lower text of the codex belongs to several much earlier manuscripts , such as Codex Guelferbytanus A , Codex Guelferbytanus B , and Codex Carolinus . 
 = = History = = 
 The manuscript is dated palaeographically to the 6th century or 7th century . According to Tischendorf it was written in the 6th century . Probably it was written in Italy . Nothing is known about its early history . In the 12th or 13th century four of its leaves were used as material for another book and they were overwritten by Latin text . Its later story is linked with the codices Guelferbytanus A and B. 
 Formerly the manuscript was held in Bobbio , Weissenburg , Mainz , and Prague . The Duke of Brunswick bought it in 1689 . 
 The manuscript became known to the scholars in the half of the 18th century , where it was found in the Ducal Library of Wolfenbüttel . The first description of the codex was made by Heusinger . Franz Anton Knittel ( 1721 – 1792 ) recognized two lower Greek texts of the New Testament in this palimpsest codex , and designated them by A and B , he recognized also the Gothic @-@ Latin text ( known later as Codex Carolinus ) . F. A. Knittel deciphered Gothic @-@ Latin text of the Codex Carolinus and published it in 1762 at Brunswick . In his edition all abbreviated forms , Gothic and Latin , are written in full . It was published in Uppsala in 1763 . It was published again by Theodor Zahn . 
 Knittel made many errors , especially in Latin text , he also did not decipher every word and left several lacunae in the reconstructed text ( e.g. Romans 11 : 35 ; 12 : 2 ; 15 : 8 ) . Tischendorf made a new and more accurate collation for the Latin text and edited in 1855 . Tischendorf used abbreviations for the nomina sacra , he did not leave any lacunae . The new collation of the Gothic text was given by Carla <unk> in 1999 . 
 The codex is located at the Herzog August Bibliothek ( no . <unk> ) in Wolfenbüttel .

 Mont Aiguille ( 2 @,@ 085 m ( 6 @,@ 841 ft ) ) is a mountain in the Vercors Plateau of the French <unk> , located 58 km ( 36 mi ) south of Grenoble , in the commune of <unk> , and the département of Isère . The mountain , known as one of the Seven Wonders of Dauphiné , is a relatively flat limestone mesa surrounded by steep cliffs . The mountain lies within an area designated in 1985 as the Vercors Regional Natural Park . Mont Aiguille 's limestone cliffs , especially on the northwest side , are popular with climbers . Its first climb in 1492 was said to mark the birth of mountaineering . 
 = = Topography and geography = = 
 Mont Aiguille is a mesa eroded from the Vercors Plateau in the drainage basin of the Rhône . It is surrounded by steep cliffs and has a height of 2 @,@ 085 metres ( 6 @,@ 841 ft ) and a clean prominence of 465 m ( 1 @,@ 526 ft ) . The surrounding terrain is difficult enough to warrant a technical climb as the easiest method of ascent . The mountain is capped with meadows botanically similar to those on the Vercors High Plateau , but beneath the cliffs there are extensive forests . The mountain lies within the Vercors Regional Natural Park and is in the département of Isère . The nearest access by rail is in the village of Saint @-@ Martin @-@ de @-@ <unk> and by road is from the north via the Col de La <unk> . 
 = = Geomorphology and geology = = 
 <unk> , the mountain is a mesa @-@ like outlier , that is to say , the remains of a plateau that has been otherwise eroded to leave only a single pillar of rock - weaker or fractured rocks ( the so @-@ called <unk> fault ) between the current summit and the Vercors high plateau were eroded over time by over 400 metres , leaving the peak standing on its own . This has resulted in several unique features of Mont Aiguille , including the cliffs , which are almost identical to those on the eastern edge of the Vercors Plateau such as those on the edge of the Grand <unk> , which is the highest point of the range . Another feature resulting from this is the presence of meadows on the summit plateau , which are similar to those to the west on the rest of the Vercors plateau . 
 Mont Aiguille is a limestone mesa , previously connected to the main body of the high plateau of the Vercors Massif . The summit is made up of lower Barremian strata , deposited during the Cretaceous period . This is the same as the plateau to the west , but not as the immediate environs : the lower slopes are composed of older Hauterivian strata . As easily observed , the bedding planes are all roughly level , although there is some inclination down to the north @-@ east . 
 = = History = = 
 According to Roman legend , the mountain was torn from the rest of the Vercors when a hunter named <unk> saw naked goddesses on the mountain and was changed into an ibex as punishment . In the medieval period , Mont Aiguille was traditionally called " Mount Inaccessible " , and typically depicted as an " inverted pyramid " or " mushroom " . Since at least the thirteenth century , the mountain has been regarded as one of the Seven Wonders of Dauphiné . The mountain is most noted for its first ascent in 1492 . Charles VIII ordered that the peak be climbed , so one of his servants , Antoine de Ville , made the ascent using a combination of ladders , ropes and other artificial aids . He was visited in the following days by many local members of the nobility and aristocracy . The team bivouacked on the summit for eight days , erecting small crosses and a stone shelter . The ascent is described by François Rabelais in his Quart Livre . This was the first recorded climb of any technical difficulty , and has been said to mark the beginning of mountaineering . The mountain was not climbed again until 1834 , nearly 350 years later , when it was ascended barefoot by Jean <unk> , accompanied for one @-@ quarter of the way by local explorers . Less than a month later , it was climbed by seven people at the same time , who reportedly danced and sang La Marseillaise on the summit . In 1940 , the top 11 m ( 36 ft ) of the mountain collapsed , reducing the height to 2 @,@ 085 m ( 6 @,@ 841 ft ) . Seventeen years later , on 27 August 1957 , the stunt pilot Henri Giraud landed a Piper J @-@ 3 Cub on the summit , utilising an 80 m ( 260 ft ) -long , 20 m ( 66 ft ) -wide runway which had been built earlier that day using materials and men lifted to the summit by helicopters . In the following 18 years , he staged a further 51 landings on the summit before his final landing in 1975 , many carrying paying passengers , and often made using skis . The mountain was in 1970 designated as part of the Parc naturel régional du Vercors .

 Waxy ( 1790 – 18 April 1818 ) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse that won the 1793 Epsom Derby and was an influential sire in the late eighteenth and early part of the nineteenth century . Waxy was bred by Sir Ferdinando Poole and was foaled at Lewes in 1790 . He was sired by Pot @-@ 8 @-@ Os , a son of the foundation stallion Eclipse , whose genetic lineage traced to the Darley Arabian . Waxy 's dam , Maria , was sired by the influential stallion Herod and produced one full @-@ brother to Waxy , who was named Worthy . Waxy derived his name from a variety of potato , a choice that was inspired by his sire 's name . Trained by Robert Robson , Waxy won nine races out of 15 starts during his four @-@ year racing career , retiring from racing at the age of seven in 1797 after sustaining an injury during his last start . 
 Beginning in 1798 , Waxy stood at stud at Sir Poole 's estate in Lewes and remained there until Poole 's death in 1804 . After Poole 's death , Waxy was acquired by the 3rd Duke of Grafton and stood at his Euston Hall stud . Waxy remained at Euston Hall for the remainder of his life and was used as a breeding stallion until his death on 18 April 1818 . His most notable offspring were produced under the ownership of the 3rd Duke of Grafton and his son . Waxy produced 190 winners of races during his stud career , siring four Epsom Derby and three Epsom Oaks winners , becoming a leading sire in 1810 . His most notable sons that achieved success in the stud were Whalebone and Whisker . Through the produce of these two sons , Waxy became the paternal ancestor of most of the world 's male Thoroughbreds by the mid @-@ twentieth century . 
 = = Background = = 
 Waxy was bred by Sir Ferdinando Poole , a baronet whose family seat was in Poole , Cheshire . Sir Ferdinando leased an extensive estate in Lewes that was built on land once owned by the Grey Friars and was called " The Friary . " Waxy was foaled in 1790 at Poole 's stable at The Friary . 
 The colt was named " Waxy " to distinguish him from Poole 's other colt sired by Pot @-@ 8 @-@ Os out of the mare <unk> , which was subsequently named " <unk> . " Waxy and mealy were two types of potatoes available at the time and are a play on the name of the colts ' sire Pot @-@ 8 @-@ Os , which is itself a pun on the name " Potatoes . " A variant spelling , " <unk> , " is mentioned in some publications . 
 = = = Ancestry = = = 
 Waxy 's sire , Pot @-@ 8 @-@ Os , was a successful sire of racehorses that had won 34 races during his seven @-@ year racing career . In addition to Waxy , Pot @-@ 8 @-@ Os produced the mare Parasol ( the dam of Partisan ) and the colt Lottery . Waxy was Pot @-@ 8 @-@ Os most successful son in the breeding shed , with Waxy 's sons carrying on the direct @-@ male line well into the 20th century . 
 Waxy 's dam , Maria , was bred by Lord Bolingbroke and was sired by the Thoroughbred foundation sire Herod . She produced ten foals between 1784 and 1797 , with Waxy being her sixth foal and one of two by Pot @-@ 8 @-@ Os . Waxy 's full @-@ brother , Worthy ( foaled in 1795 ) , was a moderately successful racer and was later a breeding stallion for the East India Company . Maria died in 1797 , about two weeks after foaling the filly <unk> , later the dam of Derby winner <unk> , Sir Charles and Thunderbolt . 
 = = = Description = = = 
 In the words of jockey Sam <unk> , Waxy was a " handsome , rich bay , with a white stocking on the off @-@ hind [ right ] leg , good length , and especially beautiful quarters . " In the words of his exercise rider ( who wrote an anonymous letter to The Sporting Magazine in 1828 ) , Waxy was " one of the finest formed horses , perfect in symmetry , beautiful in colour , admirable in all his paces , and of the finest temper when in work . " However , when Waxy was confined to a stall during the winter months , his temperament became unruly and unpredictable leading the anonymous writer to remark that , " Oft has he kicked the lappets of my coat over my head . " One of the few , possibly only , surviving portraits of Waxy was painted by Francis Sartorius in 1794 or 1795 , and the depiction was praised in commentary for Sporting Magazine for its " neatness " and for " the truth of representation it so evidently display [ ed ] . " While most breeding stallions and racehorses of the era had stable companions , Waxy reportedly was fond of rabbits in his later years and " was never happy without a rabbit in his paddock " with one female rabbit making her nest in the middle of his stall and raising generations of rabbits at the site that were never harmed by Waxy . 
 = = Racing career = = 
 Waxy did not race at the age of two years , and his first turf appearance was at the spring meeting at Newmarket . Waxy was trained by Robert Robson , who worked for Sir Ferdinando Poole in Lewes for several years from about 1792 . Waxy 's main and most celebrated racing rival was Lord Egremont 's colt Gohanna ( first described as " Brother to Precipitate " ) who was called the " Pride of Petworth . " Waxy raced Gohanna five times in his career , beating him in all but one race , a match race at Newmarket in 1794 where Waxy carried two more pounds than Gohanna and lost by half a head . Waxy was perceived as an excellent racehorse during his racing career . So much so that in one alleged incident , Waxy was mistakenly seized as a <unk> after the proprietor of a <unk> inn where he was staying suddenly died . Being the finest horse in the stable , and assuming he was owned by the stablemaster he was briefly taken by the landowner . Waxy raced until he was seven years old and retired from racing after he was injured in his last start . He was then used as a breeding stallion by Poole at Lewes .

 The Epsom Derby occurred on 18 May and was attended by " as numerous a company as ever appeared on the course . " Eleven horses lined up for the start , seven of them sired by Pot @-@ 8 @-@ Os . The starting odds for Waxy to win the Derby were 100 to 7 and 100 to 10 ( depending on the bookmaking operation ) and at the Tattersalls betting room he " was so little thought of , that he had never been mentioned " in the betting . The race favorite was Lord Egremont 's colt " Brother to Precipitate " ( later named Gohanna in 1795 ) with this horse taking the lead in the initial strides of the race . Waxy pushed Brother to Precipitate ( a " bump " in modern racing terms ) at the track 's first turn , taking and maintaining the lead to become an " easy winner " of the Derby . Three of the top four finishers were sired by Pot @-@ 8 @-@ Os , with second place finisher Brother to Precipitate being the exception . The meeting was also notable for a " dreadful accident , " a collision between a servant on horseback with the colt <unk> , the winner of the race after the Derby , and for the antics of John Lade dressed in a " loose undress of blue and white striped <unk> " asking the crowd to determine whether he was " the captain of a privateer or an ambassador from the Great Mogul . " 
 At Lewes on 1 August , Waxy won an 80 @-@ guinea sweepstakes race against Lord Egremont 's colt Mercury while carrying seven pounds more than the other horses in the race as a handicap for his win in the Derby .

 Waxy first stood at Lewes for a fee of 10 guineas per mare and a groom fee of 10 shillings . In September 1803 , Sir Ferdinando Poole offered to sell Waxy for 700 guineas to William Lightfoot , an agent sent to buy horses for Virginian <unk> John Tayloe . Lightfoot refused to buy Waxy , writing to Tayloe , " he has lost an eye , and is thirteen years old , and I think his health bad . " Instead Lightfoot purchased Waxy 's half @-@ sister Keren <unk> who was covered by Waxy that year . It is unclear how Waxy lost his eye , its loss occurring sometime between 1797 and 1803 . Sir Ferdinando Poole died on 8 June 1804 , and Waxy was then acquired by the Duke of Grafton and relocated to the Euston Hall stud near Newmarket . Under the Duke 's ownership , his fee increased to 25 guineas per mare and he covered 40 mares per season . 
 Waxy died on 18 April 1818 at the advanced age ( for a Thoroughbred ) of 28 , having gone completely blind a few years before his death . He was buried at Newmarket , close to All Saints Church .

 Waxy produced 190 winners in his stud career , including four winners of the Epsom Derby and three winners of the Epsom Oaks . His first Derby winner , Waxy Pope , was foaled when Waxy was 16 years old and most of his notable offspring were produced in the last nine years of his life under the ownership of the Duke of Grafton and his son . Waxy was the leading sire in 1810 , mostly due to the racing success of Pope and Whalebone . His importance to Thoroughbred genetics and prevalence in the General Stud Book led him to be likened to " the ace of trumps , " the most powerful card in bridge , due in part to the success of his sons Whisker and Whalebone . In the mid @-@ 20th century , the paternal line of most of the world 's male Thoroughbreds traced to the Darley Arabian through Waxy , and Waxy 's line was one of only three male lines tracing to Eclipse that persisted into the 20th century ( the others tracing through Hambletonian and Joe Andrews ) . In the words of 20th @-@ century Thoroughbred pedigree analyst John Furman Wall , " with his advent , superb quality was a reality . "

His most productive offspring were produced by the mare Penelope ( by <unk> ) and include Whalebone , Whisker , Web , Woful , Wire and Wilful . Penelope was bred and owned by the Duke of Grafton , and all of her foals were foaled at Euston Hall . Whisker was more notable for siring broodmares , and Whalebone was a good producer of colts .

 Whalebone was foaled in 1807 out of the mare Penelope , who was a daughter of Prunella . He raced for six years and won the Derby in 1810 . He later sired two Derby winners , Lap @-@ dog and Spaniel and Caroline , winner of the Oaks .

 = Battle of Antioch ( 218 ) = 
 The Battle of Antioch ( 8 June 218 ) was fought between the Roman armies of the Emperor Macrinus and his contender Elagabalus , whose troops were commanded by General Gannys . Gannys ' victory over Macrinus led to the downfall of the emperor and his replacement by Elagabalus . After a short reign of four years , Elagabalus was also killed , after which a short period of stability followed . 
 The battle itself is not particularity notable , and even the ancient scholars , Dio and Herodian , only briefly consider the battle itself . However , it is historically notable as the ultimate action in a series of events that led the Army to select the emperor over the objections of the Senate . This further eroded one of the few official powers remaining in the Senate . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Death of Caracalla and rise of Macrinus = = = 
 Macrinus ' predecessor Caracalla was murdered while traveling to visit a temple by Justin <unk> , a soldier who was incensed at being declined the rank of centurion , during a period of war with the Parthians . Macrinus , a Praetorian prefect at the time , was involved in the assassination . Macrinus may have plotted against Caracalla because of fear for his own life , based on a story mentioned by Herodian and supported by Gibbons : Macrinus would often read dispatches sent to Caracalla , and one such dispatch delivered from <unk> , a friend of Caracalla , detailed a prophecy , perhaps fabricated , from the oracle at Delphi , suggesting that Macrinus was plotting against Caracalla and that Macrinus was destined to become the next emperor . 
 In the immediate aftermath of Caracalla 's death , Adventus was selected to serve as emperor , but he declined the position due to his old age . The army then chose Macrinus ; they had no feelings of ' love or esteem ' towards him , but there was no one else competing for the position . The army proclaimed Macrinus as emperor three days after the death of Caracalla , and named him Augustus . 
 The results were applauded by the Senate at first , who were glad to be rid of the former emperor . But tradition held that the emperor could only be selected from among the Senate , causing some concern . Macrinus was a member of the equestrian class , the lower of the two aristocratic classes , which led to further concern . This led the Senate to severely scrutinize his every action . The Senate , however , was powerless to do anything about it , the military was at the time so concentrated at Edessa that there was no force anywhere else in the Empire that could contest the action . 
 As the new emperor , Macrinus had to deal with the major threat of the Parthians , with whom Rome were currently at war . An indecisive battle at Nisibis is cited as a reason for the opening of peace negotiations . Negotiations may have been favourable for both sides ; Rome was being threatened by Armenia and Dacia , and the Parthians were far from home and low on supplies . The settlement , however , was viewed by many people as being unfavourable to Rome ; Dio quotes that a payout of 200 million <unk> was paid to the Parthians in exchange for peace . The sum was called into question by Scott due to its sheer enormity and because Dio is known for being unreliable when discussing finances . Regardless , the general opinion on the negotiations was one of contempt , with Macrinus being accused of being cowardly and weak . 
 With the peace treaty concluded , Macrinus took measures to control the expenditures of Rome , reinstating the fiscal policies of Septimius Severus . This included a reduction in pay and benefits for Legionnaires , which was not popular with the Army who had placed him in command . These policies would only apply to new recruits , but the enlisted soldiers saw this as setting precedent for further changes to the fiscal policies brought in by Caracalla . The sullen behaviour of new recruits , who entered service committing to greater labour for less payment , only furthered discontent among the soldiers . Gibbon suggests that from here only a small spark would be required to ignite a rebellion . 
 = = = Rise of Elagabalus = = = 
 Following the death of Caracalla , Macrinus allowed Caracalla 's mother , Julia Domna , and his aunt Julia Maesa , to settle in their home town of Emesa . Julia Domna , who was at Antioch at the time of Caracalla 's death , attempted suicide and eventually succeeded by starving herself . Julia Maesa , however , returned to Emesa with her finances intact . 
 Julia 's suspicions regarding Macrinus ' involvement in the death of Caracalla led to her championing the case of her grandson , Elagabalus , as the rightful emperor . At the time Elagabalus was the chief priest of the Phoenician god Elagabal in Emesa . The soldiers stationed there frequently visited the temple where Elagabalus was chief priest , and enjoyed watching him perform rituals and ceremonies there . On one such occasion , Julia Maesa took the opportunity to inform the soldiers , either truthfully or not , that Elagabalus was Caracalla 's son . Simultaneously , she may have seen the opportunity to use her family 's wealth and prestige to set in motion her plot . 
 On the night of 15 May 218 , Elagabalus was taken , by either Julia Maesa or Gannys , to the camp of the Legio III Gallica at <unk> and presented to the soldiers stationed there . Some accounts claim that upon being presented to them , Elagabalus was immediately hailed Antoninus after Caracalla . Enhanced by Julia 's monetary contributions , the legion proclaimed Elagabalus emperor on 16 May 218 . 
 Macrinus might have been able to stop the rebellion in this early stage , but could not decide on a course of action and remained at Antioch . 
 = = = Rebellion = = = 
 Now that Elagabalus had the support of an entire legion , other legionnaires , prompted by discontent over pay , moved to join Elagabalus ' ranks as well . In response , Macrinus sent a cavalry force led under the command of Ulpinus Julianus to regain control of the rebels . Instead , the cavalry killed Ulpinus and joined Elagabalus . 
 Following these events , Macrinus traveled to Apamea to ensure the loyalty of Legio II <unk> before setting off to march against Emesa . Macrinus appointed his son Diadumenian the position of Imperator , and promised the soldiers 20 @,@ 000 <unk> each , with 4 @,@ 000 of these to be paid on the spot . Macrinus also hosted a dinner for the residents of Apamea in honour of Diadumenian . At the dinner , Macrinus was presented with the head of Ulpinus Julianus who had been killed by his defecting soldiers . This forced Macrinus to leave , according to Dio in retreat , while Downey asserts that Macrinus left in order to launch an attack . 
 Macrinus ' and Elagabalus ' troops met somewhere near the border of Syria Coele and Syria Phoenice , Macrinus ' efforts here , however , were in vain and the whole legion defected to the challenger , forcing him to retire to Antioch . This allowed <unk> to take the offensive and march on Antioch . 
 = = = Senatorial response = = = 
 During and after Caracalla 's reign the position of the Senate had been considerably weakened . The balance of power had been transferred from the Senate to the army ; as such the emperor of Rome was decided by the soldier while the Senate existed solely to officiate state affairs without any real authority . Thus , both Macrinus and later Elagabalus would attempt to secure the favour of the military while generally disregarding the opinion of the Senate . Macrinus , now in dire circumstances , would have no choice but to turn to the Senate . Thus , while at Antioch , Macrinus would make one more attempt at securing support , this time from Rome . However , a combination of distrust from the Senate , the impeding approach of Elagabalus 's legions and insufficient funds meant that Macrinus would have to face the approaching Elagabalus with only his Praetorian Guard . Had time been available , Marius Maximus , prefect of Rome , would have been able to muster troops and send reinforcements to Macrinus . Despite all of this , the Senate would still declare war against the usurper and his family , regardless of their relative powerlessness . 
 = = Battle = = 
 The battle took place on 8 June 218 at a defile outside of a village , believed to be <unk> , approximately twenty @-@ four miles or so by road between Antioch and Beroea . Herodian challenges this assertion , suggesting that the battle took place closer to the border at Syria Coele and Syria Phoenice , possibly near Emesa . Other sources either agree with Dio that the battle took place near Antioch , with one source , Downey , suggesting that both battles occurred separately or make no claim as to where the battle occurred . 
 The armies of Elagabalus , led by Gannys , a novice but determined commander , met with the Praetorian Guard of Macrinus in a narrowly fought pitched battle . Prior to battle Macrinus had the Praetorian Guard set aside their scaled armour breastplates and grooved shields in favour of lighter oval shields , thus making them lighter and more manoeuvrable and also negating the advantage of light Parthian lancers ( <unk> ) . Despite the numerical superiority of Gannys ' army of at least two full legions , faced with what levies Macrinus was able to accrue , the engagement had begun in Macrinus ' favour with the soldiers led by Gannys turning to flee after the Praetorian Guards had managed to break through the enemy line . At some point during the retreat , Julia Maesa and Soaemias <unk> ( Elagabalus ' mother ) joined the fray , rallying the forces while Gannys , who was on horseback , charged headlong at the enemy thus ending the retreat and renewing the assault . At this point Macrinus , fearing defeat , fled back to the city of Antioch . Had Macrinus remained in battle it is plausible that he might have won the battle and thus secured his position as emperor . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Having been defeated in battle , Macrinus sent his son along with attendants to Artabanus V of Parthia , while he himself returned to Antioch , proclaiming victory over Elagabalus in battle . News of Macrinus ' defeat broke out and many civilians in the city and on the roads were slain because they had favoured Macrinus . Macrinus shaved off his beard and hair to disguise himself as a member of the military police and fled the city at night on horseback . He reached Cilicia along with a few companions ; while masquerading as a military courier he successfully secured a carriage , which he subsequently drove to <unk> , near Nicomedia , before setting sail for Chalcedon . 
 In Chalcedon , Macrinus was arrested after revealing his whereabouts by making a request for money to a Procurator . While being transported back to Antioch , " like the commonest criminal " according to Dio , he injured himself in an escape attempt . He was beheaded in Cappadocia by the centurion Marcianus Taurus . His body remained unburied until Elagabalus had the chance to inspect it . Macrinus ' son Diadumenian faced a similar fate after being captured at Zeugma by the centurion <unk> Pollio . Dio concludes that Macrinus might have been praised for his deeds , rather than ridiculed and later slain , had he shown temperance and passed the title of emperor onto somebody else . He further concludes that Macrinus was the master of his own demise , which he felt was truly deserved . 
 In the interim period between the battle and the capture of Macrinus , Elagabalus declared himself emperor with the support of the military , though he would not return to Rome for several months . This news , upon reaching Rome , was met with dismay by both the Senate and the Roman people , though both submitted through necessity . Elagabalus ' reputation would not improve during his reign ; his worship of Elagabal and the sacrilegious performance of religious rituals would generate anger among the Romans . In an attempt to prevent disaster , his cousin would be elevated to the position of caesar , co @-@ ruler . This appeased the Romans for a time , however envy caused further problems culminating in the death of Elagabalus at the hands of the Praetorian Guard . This was followed by a short period of stability for Rome .

 Asmara Moerni ( [ <unk> <unk> ] ; Perfected Spelling : Asmara <unk> ; Indonesian for True Love ) is a 1941 romance film from the Dutch East Indies ( now Indonesia ) directed by Rd Ariffien and produced by Ang Hock Liem for Union Films . Written by Saeroen , the film followed a doctor who falls in love with his maid , as well as her failed romance with a fellow villager . Starring Adnan Kapau Gani , Djoewariah , and S. Joesoef , the black @-@ and @-@ white film was cast and advertised to cater to the growing native intelligentsia . Despite mixed reviews , it was a commercial success . As with most films of the Indies , Asmara Moerni may be lost . 
 = = Plot = = 
 After four years of doing his residency in Singkawang , Borneo , Dr. Pardi ( Adnan Kapau Gani ) returns to Java to open a practice . Before then , he goes to Cigading to visit his family and give them souvenirs . Upon arrival he is stunned to find that his family 's maid Tati ( Djoewariah ) , who had been his childhood playmate , is now a grown and beautiful woman . He secretly begins to fawn over Tati , although he does not tell her the reason . When Pardi 's mother tells him he should marry quickly , he refuses all of her suggested brides . He says only that he already has someone in mind , aware that his mother would never approve an inter @-@ class marriage with the maid . 
 Tati 's fiancé , Amir ( S. Joesoef ) , is jealous of all the attention that Tati is receiving , which leaves her no time for him . He plans to leave Cigading for the capital , Batavia ( today Jakarta ) , where he will find work . Tati , upon learning this , joins him . She lives at her aunt 's home in the city , making a living by washing clothes , while he finds lodging with a local man and learns to drive a <unk> ( pedicab ) . Together they begin saving for their wedding . Unknown to them , Pardi has cut short his time in Cigading to move to Batavia , both to begin his new job and to find Tati . 
 Days before the wedding , Amir is playing his flute when he is approached by a singer known as Miss Omi , who asks him to join her troupe on an international tour . Amir refuses , even after Omi hires him to drive her around the city in an attempt to convince him . After dropping Omi off , Amir is approached by a man who asks him to deliver a package ; however , before he can deliver the package Amir is arrested and charged with smuggling opium . 
 When Amir does not return , Tati and her aunt are worried : as Tati saw Amir with Omi , she fears that the two have run away together . Heartbroken , she intends to return to Cigading . When she and her aunt visit their boss , Abdul Sidik , they unknowingly pass Pardi – Abdul Sidik 's doctor . Upon returning home , Pardi calls Abdul Sidik and asks him to take Tati in as if she were his daughter and educate her . Tati is a fast learner , and is soon comparable to any woman from a wealthy family . 
 After being held eighteen months without trial , Amir is released and returned to Batavia . He is unable to find Tati , leaving him to wander the streets . Omi spots him , and again she asks him to play with her troupe . Amir agrees , and soon newspapers are filled with advertisements touting his name . Spotting one , Tati and Abdul Sidik go to a performance , only to learn that Amir was the victim of a car accident . At the hospital , where Amir is being treated by Pardi , Tati learns the truth behind Amir 's absence . On his deathbed , Amir asks Pardi to take care of Tati ; the two are later married .

 Asmara Moerni was directed by Rd Ariffien , a former journalist who had been active in the nationalist and labour movements before turning to theatre . He had joined Union Films – the company behind Asmara Moerni – in 1940 , making his debut with Harta Berdarah ( Bloody Treasure ) . Union 's head Ang Hock Liem produced , while the story was written by journalist Saeroen , who had joined Union after commercial success on Albert Balink 's Terang Boelan ( Full Moon , 1937 ) and with the production house Tan 's Film . 
 The black @-@ and @-@ white film starred Adnan Kapau Gani , Djoewariah , and S. Joesoef . It was the feature film debut of Gani and Joesoef , while Djoewariah had been on Union 's payroll since Bajar dengan Djiwa ( Pay with Your Soul ) the preceding year . 
 At the time there was a growing movement to attract native intelligentsia , educated at schools run by the Dutch colonial government , and convince them to view domestic films , which were generally considered to be of much lower quality than imported Hollywood productions . This was blamed , in part , on the dominance of theatrically trained actors and crew . As such , Ariffien invited Gani , at the time a medical doctor and a prominent member of the nationalist movement , to join the cast . Although some nationalists considered Gani 's involvement in Asmara Moerni as <unk> the independence movement , Gani considered it necessary : he believed audiences needed to have higher opinions of domestic film productions . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 Asmara Moerni was premiered on 29 April 1941 at Orion Theatre in Batavia ; the crowds were mostly natives and ethnic Chinese . Rated for all ages , advertising for the film emphasised Gani 's education and Joesoef 's upper @-@ class background . It was also advertised as breaking away from the conventional standards of stage theatre , such as music , which were omnipresent in the contemporary film industry . By August 1941 it was screened in Singapore , then part of the Straits Settlements , and billed as a " modern Malay drama " . A novelisation was published later in 1941 by the Yogyakarta @-@ based Kolff @-@ Buning . 
 The film was a commercial success , though reviews were mixed . An anonymous review for the Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad found the film " fascinating " , with good acting , though another review for the same paper found that , though the film was better than contemporary works such as Pantjawarna and Sorga Ka Toedjoe , its claim to abandon stage standards was to be taken " with a pinch of salt " . A review from the Surabaya @-@ based Soerabaijasch Handelsblad found the film full of drama , describing it as " Western motifs , played in the native environment , with a specifically Sundanese situation " . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 After Asmara Moerni , Union produced a further three films ; only one , Wanita dan Satria , was by Rd Ariffien , who left the company soon after , as did Saeroen . Gani did not act in any further films , but instead returned to the nationalist movement . During the Indonesian National Revolution ( 1945 – 49 ) he became known as a smuggler , and after independence became a government minister . In November 2007 Gani was made a National Hero of Indonesia . Djoewariah continued to act until the 1950s , when she migrated to theatre after receiving a series of increasingly minor roles . 
 Asmara Moerni was screened as late as November 1945 . The film is likely lost . Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable nitrate film , and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara 's warehouse in 1952 , old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed . As such , American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider suggests that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost . However , JB Kristanto 's Katalog Film Indonesia ( Indonesian Film Catalogue ) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia 's archives , and film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service .

 = London Country North East = 
 London Country North East was a bus operator in South East England and London . It was formed from the split of London Country Bus Services in 1986 and operated a fleet of around 350 buses from six garages , with its headquarters located in Hatfield . 
 The company was the last subsidiary of National Bus Company to be privatised , being sold to the AJS Group on 22 April 1988 . Later in the same year it was split into County Bus & Coach and Sovereign Bus & Coach . 
 = = Formation and early history = = 
 In the run @-@ up to deregulation , London Country Bus Services ( <unk> ) was broken into four smaller companies on 7 September 1986 . Three hundred and fifty buses , the garages at Hatfield , Hertford , Stevenage , Harlow , St Albans and the isolated base at Grays formed the new London Country North East ( LCNE ) company . 
 Early difficulties with staff conditions and wages , which the company was attempting to simplify from the complex contracts arranged by <unk> , led to strike action by staff in February 1988 . Performance levels on contracted routes were already below those expected by the local councils who had awarded LCNE the contracts , and by London Regional Transport . Following the strike three of the company 's London contracts ( routes 292 , 298 and 313 ) were terminated and awarded to independents . 
 On 22 April 1988 , London Country North East was sold by the National Bus Company , the last of 72 subsidiaries to be privatised . The buyer was Alan Stephenson 's AJS Group , which had been formed by the management buyout of West Yorkshire Road Car Company . As part of the sale LCNE 's property was bought by Parkdale Holdings and leased back to the company ; some was sold for redevelopment , while the remainder was later sold back to LCNE . Parkdale Holdings later went out of business having changed their name to Pavilion Leisure . 
 A month later LCNE was banned from registering new services for six months by the Traffic Commissioner for failing to operate service in accordance with registrations made . Following poor financial results , AJS decided to split the company in two . 
 = = Division = = 
 In 20 months of existence London Country North East had lost £ 5 @.@ 5 million , on a turnover of £ 14 million . Two operating subsidiaries were created to help improve the situation , under the control of a single holding company , initially called the London Country Travel Group and later renamed to South of England Travel Group . Its chief executive , Bob Howells , had previously been West Yorkshire Road Car Company 's traffic manager . A third company , Cambridge based Premier Travel Services , was added to the group in 1989 but was sold to <unk> in 1991 . Both subsidiaries continued to be owned by AJS until 1991 , when they were sold to new owners . 
 = = County Bus & Coach = = 
 County Bus & Coach took over the former London Country North East garages at Harlow , Grays and Hertford . Under AJS 's ownership it was managed by Graham Willet , previously London Country Bus Services ' chief engineer . The company enjoyed some expansion : small independent Sampson Coaches and its garage at Hoddesdon were bought in February 1989 ; however , as a result of this , Hertford garage was vacated and sold for redevelopment by its owners Parkdale Holdings . The Debden and <unk> Green depots and some local routes of the former East Midland owned <unk> operation were acquired in July 1989 . County Bus & Coach 's fleet policy was to use Mercedes @-@ Benz minibuses on most routes , including in Grays when Lakeside Shopping Centre opened and when two London contracted routes were run ; there is some evidence that passengers did not like these vehicles , and their use is thought to have reduced patronage in the area . 
 AJS group was wound up in 1991 , and the company 's director Bob Howells bought County Bus & Coach through a new holding company , Lynton Travel Group . County Bus & Coach was relaunched with three new local identities : Grays garage became <unk> , Harlow became <unk> , and Hoddesdon became Lea Valley . One small operator , <unk> Coaches of Upper Edmonton , was acquired a few months after and merged with County Bus & Coach . 
 The company was one of the beneficiaries of the collapse of London Forest , gaining three routes in Walthamstow . The services of Golden Boy were also taken over , in September 1992 , although this deal involved no vehicles and no garage . In July 1993 , Lynton Travel purchased 41 @-@ vehicle independent Citibus Tours , based in Chadderton near Oldham . Other changes made in 1993 included the opening of a new garage in Grays to replace the previous building , and a totally new garage at Ware which replaced that at Hoddesdon . Two more operators were taken over in 1994 , namely coach operators Airport Coaches of Stansted Airport and <unk> Bros of Bishops Stortford . 
 However , on 7 October 1994 County Bus & Coach was sold to West Midlands Travel , who had also acquired the former London Buses subsidiary <unk> . In November 1994 County Bus & Coach became only the tenth operator in the UK to introduce low @-@ floor vehicles into service , when four Dennis Lance <unk> with Wright Pathfinder bodywork were introduced to route 502 Harlow to Romford . West Midlands Travel was taken over by National Express in 1995 , and the new owners decided not to keep their London companies . <unk> was the first to be sold , to London United in September 1995 . One year later , County Bus & Coach was sold to the rapidly expanding Cowie Group . 
 After also taking over British Bus on 1 August 1996 , who owned most of the other former London Country Bus Services company , in November 1997 the Cowie Group was rebranded as Arriva . 
 County Bus & Coach 's garage at Grays was transferred to Arriva Southend in 2000 , with that company becoming part of the Arriva Southern Counties operation in 2002 . The rest of County Bus & Coach 's routes , garages and vehicles became Arriva East Herts & Essex . This was later combined with the former Luton & District and London Country North West operations to form Arriva Shires & Essex , in which form County Bus & Coach continues to trade . 
 = = Sovereign Bus & Coach = = 
 Sovereign Bus & Coach took over three former London Country North East depots in the 1989 split , namely Hatfield , Stevenage and St Albans . These were quickly joined by the operations and Stevenage depot of Jubilee Coaches , an independent which had previously taken several contracted routes from LCNE , but found it had bid too low for the routes and could no longer fulfil its operations . Hatfield garage was closed in 1989 , and a new site established at Welwyn Garden City . Another operator , competitor Welwyn Hatfield Line , was taken over in January 1990 and retained as a separate subsidiary for several years . Most of Sovereign 's Stevenage operation was sold to Luton & District ( successors to London Country North West ) in 1990 . In 1991 the owning AJS Group was wound up . Two directors formed the Blazefield Group , and purchased Sovereign Bus & Coach and most of AJS Group 's other operations . At the time Sovereign operated 76 vehicles . 
 Some expansion followed . In October 1991 a new offshoot , Sovereign Buses ( Harrow ) , was formed to operate a number of London Regional Transport contracts won by the company . In August 1994 , the company 's position in London strengthened with the acquisition of the 43 @-@ vehicle Borehamwood Travel Services , which brought tendered route 13 run with AEC Routemasters , under Sovereign operation . BTS was renamed Sovereign London and merged with the Harrow operation . 
 The company 's fleet and operations remained largely static until 3 November 2002 , when Blazefield sold Sovereign London to Transdev . 
 Sovereign contracted further in 2002 with the sale of the St Albans operation to Centrebus . Centrebus sold the depot to Uno in March 2008 . 
 By 2002 , Sovereign 's fleet amounted to just 45 vehicles . Stevenage depot was closed and a smaller garage in the same town acquired , with Arriva Shires & Essex taking over the old site . Finally , in January 2005 , the remainder of Sovereign was sold to Arriva Shires & Essex . Having previously acquired the successors to the former London Country North West , London Country South West and London Country South East companies as well as County Bus & Coach , Arriva now owned all of the former London Country Bus Services apart from the St Albans operation .

 " Badlaa " is the tenth episode of the eighth season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network on January 21 , 2001 . The episode was written by John Shiban and directed by Tony Wharmby . " Badlaa " is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . The episode received a Nielsen rating of 7 @.@ 3 and was viewed by 11 @.@ 8 million viewers . Overall , the episode received mostly negative reviews from critics . 
 The series centers on FBI special agents Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) and her new partner John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) — following the alien abduction of her former partner , Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) — who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . When a mystic smuggles himself out of India , Scully and Doggett give chase as his murderous spree starts terrorising two families in suburban Washington , D.C. But Scully soon comes upon a crisis of faith when she realises how dissimilar her techniques are from those of Mulder , even as she tries to be the believer . 
 " Badlaa " was inspired by stories of Indian fakirs as well as the idea of someone asking for money actually being " a bad guy . " <unk> Roy , a noted stuntman better known as Deep Roy , was chosen to play the part of the antagonistic beggar . The episode 's title means " retort " or " revenge " in Hindi . 
 = = Plot = = 
 At the Sahar International Airport in Mumbai , India , an American businessman dismissively makes his way past a paraplegic beggar . Later , while using the airport 's toilet , the businessman is pulled out of the stall violently by the beggar that he passed earlier . Later , the man checks into a Washington , D.C. hotel and sits down on his bed . Soon , blood streams out of his bodily orifices . 
 Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) arrives late to the crime scene and John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) tells her that the man 's blood all drained abruptly in the hotel . A child ’ s bloody print is found , but Scully doesn ’ t believe that a child did this . Meanwhile , the beggar , somehow disguised as an ordinary looking Caucasian man , applies for a janitorial job at a Cheverly , Maryland elementary school . In the morgue , Scully describes the massive stomach damage done to the body which leads Doggett to the idea of drugs being forcibly cut out of him . However , the man showed no sign of drugs in the blood tests and Scully tells Doggett that his time of death was 24 to 36 hours prior , long before he left India . Due to a discrepancy in weight , she begins to believe that there was a passenger in the corpse . 
 Quinton , a student at the school mentioned before , calls his father after he sees the legless beggar man in his room at night . His father tells him that it was his imagination , goes back downstairs , but then screams . Quinton rushes down to find his father dead and his eyes turned red with blood . Doggett and Scully investigate this latest death after the police told them about the strange man the boy saw . While discussing the lack of any damage to the body except the broken blood vessels in the eyes , Scully comes to the conclusion that the man is still inside the latest victim . She rushes to the morgue and finds the boy ’ s father with a distended belly . She cuts into him and then sees a hand emerge from the scalpel incision . After being temporarily knocked over , she follows a bloody trail , opens a door at the end of the trail , and finds no one there . Unbeknownst to her , however , the beggar is watching her , unnoticed . 
 At the school , the principal tells the legless man ’ s janitor guise that she was very worried when he did not show up that morning . Trevor , a bully who had earlier tormented Quinton , sees partially through the beggar 's forms for a moment . Trevor later shows up at Quinton ’ s home to say he is sorry and says he thinks he knows who killed his father . 
 Scully and Doggett consult Chuck Burks , an old friend of Fox Mulder 's ( David Duchovny ) , who tells the two that Siddhi mystics could do the things Scully described ; the mystics have powers of the mind and can alter people ’ s perceptions of reality . Scully theorizes that a mystic is acting out of revenge since an American plant inadvertently released a gas cloud that killed 118 people in <unk> , outside of Mumbai . One of the victims was the 11 @-@ year @-@ old son of a holy man of the beggar caste . 
 Trevor runs home after hearing the squeaking wheels and goes outside after encountering his mother . She follows him outside to find him face @-@ down in the middle of a pool . She dives down to get him but his form turns into the legless man . At the scene of the crime , the real Trevor tells Scully that it was the " little man " who killed his mother . Later , Quinton and Trevor , after realizing that the janitor is actually the beggar , hunt the legless man in the school . Eventually , the beggar takes the form of Trevor . At that moment , Scully enters the school and opens fire , wounding the beggar and reverting him back to his true form . Two weeks later in Sahar International Airport , the beggar , unharmed , watches another obese American man pass by .

 " Badlaa " was written by John Shiban and inspired by stories of Indian fakirs . In fact , the episode 's title means " to retort " or " to revenge " in Urdu . Further inspiration came " from a little bit of desperation " according to Shiban . He later recalled that he was walking through the Vancouver airport and suddenly had the thought , " What if someone who came up to me and asked me for money was actually a bad guy . " Shiban later noted that his early drafts of the episode featured the antagonist with a different power . He explained , " My original idea was a beggar with no legs who can actually shrink himself and climb inside your ear , and Chris Carter – and this is why he 's Chris Carter – said ' No , no , no ! I know what 's even better . ' " Shiban later said that " ... one thing about this episode that I 'm sort of proud is that people often have told me that it is the most disgusting thought that they ever had , that this little man would actually enter your body and travel around inside you . " 
 The scenes featuring the Indian airport were filmed at a cruise line terminal in Long Beach , California . Ilt Jones , the location manager for the series , felt that the " dated feel " of the terminal added to the scene . He noted , " if you look at newsreel footage of India , they always have old English cars from the sixties , the cruise line terminal in Long Beach was perfect . " 
 Casting director Rick Millikan was tasked with finding a suitable actor to play the part of the beggar . Millikan 's only instructions were to look for " a small all @-@ Indian man with no legs . " Eventually , <unk> Roy , better known as Deep Roy was chosen to play the part . Deep Roy was a noted stunt man who had notably played Droopy McCool of the Max <unk> Band in Return of the Jedi . Deep Roy , however , is not an amputee and so a cart with a false bottom was created . Anytime there was a scene where the beggar had to move , blue screen technology was used to add the background in during post @-@ production . The cart featured a distinct " squeak " that Paul Rabwin described as " creepy " . He noted , " There was a squeak that had to let us know that it was him . It had to scare us [ ... ] Finally we came up with what we thought was just the right squeak and John [ Shiban ] said ' Okay , that 's the one . ' " 
 Producer Paul Rabwin was displeased with the final episode , noting , " ' Badlaa ' was the one episode I did not like the most [ ... ] I think if I had done it different , I would have had John Shiban change the method of transportation . I don 't think it ever worked on any level for me . It was just weird and creepy , but I think the whole idea was distasteful to me . " He later bluntly concluded that " it 's the only episode that I kind of wish we hadn 't done . " 
 = = Reception = = 
 " Badlaa " first aired on Fox on 21 January 2001 . The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 7 @.@ 3 , meaning that it was seen by 7 @.@ 3 % of the nation 's estimated households . The episode was viewed by 7 @.@ 46 million households and 11 @.@ 8 million viewers . The episode ranked as the 50th most @-@ watched episode for the week ending January 21 . The episode subsequently debuted in the United Kingdom on the BBC Two on May 12 , 2002 . Fox promoted the episode with the tagline " Imagine a man who can squeeze into a shoebox ... a suitcase ... or a victim . " 
 Critical reception to the episode was mostly negative . Television Without Pity writer Jessica Morgan rated the episode a " C " and criticized the episode 's plot holes , such as how the beggar escaped back to India after being shot by Scully . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode two stars out of five . The two noted that the episode was " best " when " it 's at its most tasteless " , citing the beggar " crawling up the bottom of an obese man " as " pretty tasteless " . Shearman and Pearson , however , noted that it suffered from the fact that " it doesn 't have the courage of its convictions " . 
 Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a " C + " , calling it " a messy episode " . He argued that it is an example of " magnificently bad television " . This in turn , makes it somewhat entertaining ; VanDerWerff argued that he would " rather watch this episode several times than I would some of those season seven outings where everybody seemed like they would rather be just about anywhere else . " However , he did compliment the episode 's gross @-@ out scares , noting that the beginning was " a pretty great cold open " . Tom Kessenich , in his book Examinations , was extremely critical of the episode . Referring to it as the series ' " nadir " , he ridiculed the plot and sarcastically labeled the main villain " Butt Munch " . Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one star out of four . Vitaris , sardonically referring to the episode as " The X ( <unk> ) <unk> " , noted that while " the butt @-@ crawler is new , the plot is pure " X @-@ Files generic Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week . " Matt Hurwitz and Chris Knowles noted in their book The Complete X @-@ Files that the episode soon became known as the " ' Butt Genie ' episode " among fans . 
 Despite the negativity , several reviews wrote positively of the episode 's antagonistic beggar .

 = Jonathan Jennings = 
 Jonathan Jennings ( March 27 , 1784 – July 26 , 1834 ) was the first governor of Indiana and a nine @-@ term congressman from Indiana . Born in either Hunterdon County , New Jersey , or Rockbridge County , Virginia , he studied law before immigrating to the Indiana Territory in 1806 . Jennings initially intended to practice law , but took jobs as an assistant at the federal land office at Vincennes and assistant to the clerk of the territorial legislature to support himself , and pursued interests in land speculation and politics . Jennings became involved in a dispute with the territorial governor , William Henry Harrison , that soon led him to enter politics and set the tone for his early political career . In 1808 Jennings moved to the eastern part of the Indiana Territory and settled near Charlestown , in Clark County . He was elected as the Indiana Territory 's delegate to the U.S. Congress by dividing the pro @-@ Harrison supporters and running as an anti @-@ Harrison candidate . By 1812 he was the leader of the anti @-@ slavery and pro @-@ statehood faction of the territorial government . Jennings and his political allies took control of the territorial assembly and dominated governmental affairs after the resignation of Governor Harrison in 1812 . As a congressional delegate Jennings aided passage of the Enabling Act in 1816 , which authorized the organization of Indiana 's state government and state constitution . He was elected president of the Indiana constitutional convention , held in Corydon in June 1816 , where he helped draft the state 's first constitution . Jennings supported the effort to ban slavery in the state and favored a strong legislative branch of government . 
 In August 1816 Jennings was elected to serve as the first governor of Indiana at age 32 , and re @-@ elected for an additional term . He pressed for the construction of roads and schools , and negotiated the Treaty of St. Mary 's to open up central Indiana to American settlement . His opponents attacked his participation in the treaty negotiations as unconstitutional and brought impeachment proceedings against him , a measure that was narrowly defeated by a vote of 15 to 13 after a month @-@ long investigation and the resignation of the lieutenant governor . During his second term and following the panic of 1819 , Jennings encountered financial problems , a situation exacerbated by his inability to keep up with his business interests and run the state government simultaneously . Ineligible for another term as Indiana governor under the state constitution , Jennings looked for other means of financial support . Shortly before completion of his second term as governor in 1822 , Jennings was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives , before retiring from public service in 1831 . In Congress Jennings promoted federal spending on internal improvements . 
 Jennings had been a heavy drinker of alcohol for much of his life . His addiction worsened after the death of his first wife , Ann , and his development of rheumatism . Jennings 's alcoholism led to defeat in his reelection campaign in 1830 . In retirement his condition worsened and he was unable to work his farm . When his finances collapsed , his creditors sought to take his land holdings and Charlestown farm . To protect his friend , U.S. Senator John Tipton purchased Jennings 's farm and permitted him to continue living there . After Jennings 's death , his estate was sold , but it left no funds to purchase a headstone for his grave , which remained unmarked for fifty @-@ seven years . 
 Historians have offered varied interpretations of Jennings 's life and impact on the development of Indiana . Early state historians , Jacob Piatt Dunn Jr. and William Wesley Woollen , gave Jennings high praise and credited him with the defeat of the pro @-@ slavery forces in Indiana and with laying the foundation of the state . More critical historians during the prohibition era , such as Logan <unk> , described Jennings as a crafty and self @-@ promoting politician and focused on his alcoholism . Among the modern historians , Randy Mills places Jennings 's importance between the two extremes , but agreed with Woolen 's assessment that the state " owes him more than she can compute . "

 = = = Family background = = = 
 Jonathan Jennings , the son of Jacob and Mary Kennedy Jennings , was born in either Readington Township , Hunterdon County , New Jersey , or Rockbridge County , Virginia , on March 27 , 1784 . He was the sixth of the Jennings 's eight children . His father was a doctor , Presbyterian missionary , and an ordained minister in the Dutch Reformed Church . His mother , who was well educated and practiced medicine , was the daughter of Samuel Kennedy , a Presbyterian minister at Basking Ridge , New Jersey . Mary , who may have had a medical degree , assisted her husband in his practice . Around 1790 Jennings 's father moved the family to Dunlap Creek in Fayette County , Pennsylvania , where Jennings remained until his adulthood . After his mother 's death in 1792 , Jennings was raised by his older sister , Sarah , and his brother , Ebenezer . Jennings was particularly close to Ebenezer and his younger sister , Ann , and her husband , David G. Mitchell , who was a physician . Jennings was schooled at home , then attended the nearby grammar school in Canonsburg , Pennsylvania , where he received a basic education . Two of his classmates , William Hendricks and William W. Wick , would later become his political allies . Jennings studied law in Washington , Pennsylvania . By 1806 Jennings had left Pennsylvania and moved to Steubenville , Ohio , where his brother , Obadiah , had a law office . Jennings helped Obadiah in cases before the Ohio Supreme Court . 
 In 1806 Jennings headed west to Jeffersonville in the Indiana Territory , but stayed only briefly . He moved to Vincennes , the capital of the Indiana Territory , in early 1807 to open his own law practice and was admitted to the bar in April . Jennings had difficulty earning an income as a lawyer , finding there were too few clients in the territory to keep him busy . In July 1807 Nathaniel Ewing , the federal land receiver at Vincennes and a friend from Pennsylvania , invited Jennings to take a job as assistant to John <unk> , the registrar at the federal land office in Vincennes . Along with <unk> , Jennings engaged in land speculation . He obtained significant land holdings and made substantial profits . In 1807 Jennings became an assistant to the clerk of the territorial legislature and continued to speculate on the sale of public lands . 
 = = = Confrontation with Harrison = = = 
 In August 1807 Jennings was appointed clerk of the Vincennes University board of trustees and began to be drawn into ongoing political disputes going on territory . The territorial governor , William Henry Harrison , was a member and president of the board . As governor of the Indiana Territory , Harrison wielded considerable influence through his political appointments and veto powers . Jennings received the university appointment after General Washington Johnston resigned as clerk of the board following a dispute over Harrison 's proposal to ban the French residents of Vincennes from using the university 's commons . The board defeated Harrison 's proposal , but Johnston resigned as its clerk and Jennings was selected as his replacement over Henry Hurst , one of Harrison 's loyal supporters . Harrison was outraged and promptly resigned from the board , but later reconsidered his decision . In September 1807 Harrison was easily reelected to the board and selected as its president . In the meantime , Johnston wrote a pamphlet describing the board 's proceedings , which Jennings certified without the board 's knowledge or approval . Jennings further angered Harrison when he attempted to secure a clerkship in the territorial legislature . Jennings 's opponent for the clerkship was the anti @-@ slavery candidate Davis Floyd , an enemy of Harrison . After Jennings dropped out of the race , Floyd was selected for the position and became an important political ally to Jennings . In April 1808 , with Harrison reelected as president of the Vincennes University board , a commission was appointed to investigate Jennings 's conduct . The committee 's inquiry concerned Jennings 's certification of Johnston 's pamphlet dealing with board proceedings without their knowledge . The incident led to Jennings 's resignation in 1808 and created a considerable amount of animosity between the two that prevailed for many years . 
 By March 1808 , Jennings believed that his future in the Harrison @-@ dominated western part of the territory was bleak . By November he had left Vincennes and moved to Jeffersonville , in Clark County , Indiana Territory , before settling in nearby Charlestown . Jennings may have believed his political future would have more success in the eastern part of the territory . Settlements in the southeast and eastern portion of the territory opposed slavery and Harrison 's aristocratic manner , which were similar to Jennings 's beliefs , while the western portion of the territory and Vincennes area remained proslavery . Although petitions to allow slavery were received before the formation of the Indiana Territory , the issue attracted widespread attention in 1807 when Harrison and his supporters in the territorial legislature revived efforts to allow slavery in the territory . Jennings and his supporters who opposed slavery wrote writing articles appearing in the Vincennes Western Sun newspaper attacking Harrison 's administration , its pro @-@ slavery sentiments , and aristocratic policies . 
 In 1808 , when Congressman Benjamin Parke resigned from office , Harrison ordered a special election to fill the vacancy . Jennings entered the race against Harrison 's candidate , Thomas Randolph , the attorney general for the territory , and John Johnson , a Vincennes native who had the support of the antislavery group . Randolph promised not to introduce slavery into the territory unless the majority of his constituents agreed , while Johnson remained silent on the issue . Jennings , an antislavery candidate from the eastern portion of the territory , rode from settlement to settlement to give speeches against slavery . Jennings spoke against what he believed to be Randolph 's aristocratic tendencies , ties to Harrison 's territorial government , and the issue of slavery in the territory . Jennings found his greatest support among the growing Quaker community in the eastern part of the territory . 
 On November 27 , 1809 , Jennings was elected as a delegate to the Eleventh Congress . The election was close . Jennings beat Randolph , 428 votes to 402 , with Johnson taking 81 votes . Randolph challenged the election results and traveled to Washington D.C. to take his case to the U.S. House of Representatives . Randolph claimed that election officials in Dearborn County did not follow proper procedures for certifying ninety @-@ one votes in the county 's seventh district and argued that the votes should be deducted from the vote totals . Once discarded , the revised totals would make Randolph the winner . A House committee took up the case , issued a resolution in Randolph 's favor , and recommended that a new election be held . Randolph immediately left for the Indiana Territory to launch a new campaign for the seat , but the House defeated the committee 's recommendation by an 83 to 30 vote margin and Jennings was permitted to take his seat . As a territorial delegate in Congress , Jennings learned the legislative process , served on House committees , introduced legislation , debated issues , and continued his ongoing crusade against Governor Harrison . Jennings did not play a major role in congressional discussions , but he did make an effort to represent the interests of his constituents . He was reelected in 1811 , 1812 , and 1814 . 
 = = = Courtship and marriage = = = 
 During his first session in Congress , Jennings had a small portrait of himself made , which he later gave to Ann Gilmore Hay , the daughter of a prominent Charlestown politician , whom he had recently begun courting . Hay was born in Harrodsburg , Kentucky , in 1792 . Her family moved to Clark County in Indiana Territory , and settled in Charlestown . Jennings first met her when he was campaigning for Congress in 1809 . After his first session in Congress ended , Jennings returned to Indiana Territory and married eighteen @-@ year @-@ old Ann on August 8 , 1811 . Ann 's father had just died leaving her with no family or means of support . Following his reelection to Congress in 1811 , the couple returned to Washington , where she remained briefly , before traveling to Pennsylvania to live with Jennings 's sister , Ann Mitchell , for the remainder of the session . Jennings 's wife suffered from ill health , which deteriorated after he became governor of Indiana in 1816 , and she died after a protected illness in 1826 . Later that year Jennings married Clarissa Barbee , who had come from Kentucky to teach at the Charlestown seminary . Jennings had no children from either marriage .

 = = = Battle with Harrison = = = 
 Angered over his electoral loss , Randolph harangued anti @-@ Harrison supporters , even challenging one to a duel . He was stabbed three times , but recovered and challenged Jennings in his bid for reelection in 1810 . Harrison came out to personally stump on Randolph 's behalf . Jennings focused on the slavery issue and tied Randolph to Harrison 's continued attempts to legalize the institution . The congressional election coincided with the first popular election of delegates to the territorial legislature . In 1809 , a year prior to the election , the territory 's pro @-@ slavery faction suffered a significant setback when Illinois was separated from the Indiana Territory , cutting Harrison off from his supporters in the western portion of the territory . Harrison suggested that Jennings further expanded his political base by stumping among the disaffected French residents of the territory . Jennings 's defeat of Randolph in 1810 repudiated Harrison 's pro @-@ slavery policies . Following his triumph in the election , Jennings 's and his anti @-@ slavery allies were successful in enacting a legislative agenda that limited the territorial governor 's authority and repealed an 1805 act regarding indentured service . 
 In his first full term in Congress , Jennings stepped up his attacks on Harrison , accusing him of using his office for personal gain , of taking part in questionable land speculation deals , and needlessly raising tensions with the Native American tribes on the frontier . Jennings presented a congressional resolution that intended to reduce Harrison 's authority to make political appointments and opposed his policy of purchasing lands from the Indians . When Harrison was up for reappointment as territorial governor in 1810 , Jennings sent a scathing letter to President James Madison that argued against his reappointment . Harrison 's allies in Washington argued on his behalf and aided in securing his reappointment . 
 After hostilities broke out on the frontier between the Americans and the native tribes , culminating in the Battle of Tippecanoe in November 1811 , Jennings successfully promoted passage of a bill to grant compensation to veterans of the battle and to give pensions for five years to the widows and orphans of those who were killed . Privately , Jennings lamented the battle , while his friends in the territory faulted Harrison for agitating the situation and causing the needless loss of life . As calls for war with Great Britain increased , Jennings was not among the war hawks , but ultimately accepted the arrival of the War of 1812 . Early in the war , Harrison was commissioned as a military general and dispatched to defend the frontier and invade Canada , which caused him to resign from his post as territorial governor in 1812 . Prior to Harrison 's resignation , Jennings and his allies moved quickly to take advantage of the situation and initiated efforts to weaken the governor 's authority . In 1811 the territorial legislature voted to move the capital away from Vincennes , a pro @-@ Harrison stronghold , and began a shift in political power from the territorial governor to the delegates in the territorial legislature and its elected officials . John Gibson , the elderly , acting governor , whose territorial duties largely dealt with military affairs , did not challenge the territorial legislature . When Harrison 's successor , Thomas Posey , was confirmed on March 3 , 1813 , Jennings 's party in the territorial legislature had become entrenched and began to advance their request for statehood . 
 Jennings ran for reelection to Congress in 1811 against another pro @-@ slavery candidate , Waller Taylor . The campaign was the most divisive in Jennings 's career . Taylor derided Jennings as a " pitiful coward " and went so far as to challenge Jennings to a duel , but he refused . Jennings ran on the slavery issue again , fielding his new motto , " No slavery in Indiana " . Jennings 's supporters tied Taylor , a territorial judge , to the pro @-@ slavery movement . Jennings easily won reelection , thanks to an expanding base of support that included the growing community of <unk> . Following his reelection , Jennings developed jaundice , an illness often caused by alcoholism , but he recovered . During his third term in Congress , Jennings began advocating that statehood be granted to Indiana , but held off formally introducing legislation until the end of the War of 1812 . Jennings ran against Elijah Sparks in his 1814 reelection campaign and easily won . 
 = = = Push for statehood = = = 
 By 1815 Jennings and the territorial legislature were ready to embark on a course for statehood . In December 1815 Jennings 's introduced a petition from the territorial legislature to Congress that requested statehood for Indiana . The 1815 census showed the territory had a population exceeding 63 @,@ 000 , more than the minimum requirement for statehood under the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 . The House began a debate on the measure and passed the Enabling Act on April 11 , 1816 . The act granted Indiana the right to form a government and elect delegates to a constitutional convention that would create a state constitution . The territorial governor , Thomas Posey , expressed concern that the territory was too under @-@ populated to provide sufficient tax revenue to fund a state government . In a letter to President Madison , he recommended that the president veto the bill and delay statehood for another three years , which would allow him to finish his term as governor . Madison signed the bill , ignoring Posey 's plea . 
 Dennis Pennington , a leading member of the territorial legislature , was able to secure the election of many anti @-@ slavery delegates to the constitutional convention . Jennings was a delegate from Clark County . At the convention , held in June 1816 in the new territorial capital of Corydon , Jennings was elected president of the assembly , which permitted him to appoint the convention 's committee chairmen . Although the delegates drafted a new constitution for Indiana , the majority of the content was copied from other state constitutions , most notably Ohio and Kentucky . A few items were new and unique to Indiana . Slavery , which was already prohibited in territorial legislation , was banned in the Indiana constitution ; however , contracts for indentured servants , if they were already in existence , were preserved . The new state government , divided into legislative , executive , and judicial branches , gave the governor limited powers and concentrated authority in the hands of the Indiana General Assembly and county officials . Shortly after the convention , Jennings publicly announced his candidacy for governor . 
 = = Governor = = 
 = = = Campaign and election = = = 
 At the state convention in June 1816 Jennings may have informed some of the delegates that he intended to run for governor and by early July 1816 he had publicly announced his candidacy . Thomas Posey , Indiana 's last territorial governor , was Jennings 's opponent . Posey announced his own candidacy for governor prior to the convention 's adjournment on June 29 , 1816 . With just five weeks before the August 5 election , there was little active campaigning . Posey , who thought Indiana statehood was premature , was not a popular candidate and suffered from health issues . Jennings won by a large majority , 5 @,@ 211 votes to 3 @,@ 934 . Most of Jennings 's votes probably came from the eastern portion of the state , where his support was particularly strong , while Posey 's probably came from the western portion . Jennings moved to the new state capital at Corydon , where he served the duration of his term as governor . 
 Jennings 's salary as governor , which was the highest for an elected official in the state , was $ 1 @,@ 000 . Under the constitution , the governor served a three @-@ year term and was prohibited from serving more that six years in a nine @-@ year period . Jennings 's agenda called for establishing court proceedings to secure justice , organizing a state @-@ funded educational systems , creating a state banking system , preventing unlawful seizure and enslavement of free blacks , organizing a state library , and planning internal improvements . His efforts had limited success , due , in part , to the state 's limited financial resources and Jennings 's limited powers as governor . 
 Jennings strongly condemned slavery in his inauguration speech and as governor , he refined his stance on the institution . On November 7 , 1816 , Jennings encouraged the state legislature to enact laws to prevent " unlawful attempts to seize and carry into bondage persons of color legally entitled to their freedom " while preventing " those who rightfully owe service to the citizens of any other State or Territory , from seeking , within the limits of this state , a refuge from the possession of their lawful owners . " In 1817 Jennings acknowledged a moderation of his earlier position regarding fugitive slaves by claiming it was needed to " preserve harmony " among the states . Jennings agreed to allow citizens " the means of reclaiming any slave escaping to this State that may rightfully belong to them … with as little delay as possible " after citizens of Kentucky had difficulty reclaiming their slaves who had escaped to Indiana . 
 = = = Internal improvements = = = 
 In 1818 , Jennings began promoting a large @-@ scale plan for internal improvements in the state . Most of the projects were directed toward construction of roads , canals , and other projects to enhance the commercial appeal and economic viability of the state . During Jennings 's second term the state government continued to support public improvements , with new road construction and expanded settlement into central Indiana . After Indianapolis became the site for the state 's permanent capital in 1821 and new settlers arrived in the area , the Indiana General Assembly appropriated $ 100 @,@ 000 for new road construction and improvements to some of the more important routes , but it was considerably short of the amount needed . 
 The state experienced budget shortages because of low tax revenues , which forced Jennings to pursue other means of financing the projects . The main sources of funds came from issuing government bonds to the state bank and sales of public lands . The state 's spending and borrowing led to short @-@ term budget problems , but despite early setbacks ( poor access to capital eventually halted improvement programs and caused the Indiana Canal Company to fold because of lack of funds ) , the infrastructure improvements initiated by Jennings attracted new settlers to the state . By 1810 the Indiana Territory 's population within the boundaries of the new state was 24 , 520 . In the decades following his governorship , Indiana 's population grew from sixty @-@ five thousand in 1816 to 147 @,@ 178 in 1820 and surpassed one million by 1850 . 
 In his first inaugural speech in August 1816 , Jennings called attention to the need for an educational plan . In his 1817 annual message to the state legislature , he encouraged the establishment of a free , state @-@ funded education system , as called for in the state constitution , but few of the state 's citizens were willing to impose taxes to fund public schools . The state legislature believed priority should be given to creating government infrastructure . Lack of public funds postponed creation of a state library system until Governor James B. Ray 's administration in 1826 . 
 From the beginning the state 's banking institutions were closely tied to the state government 's fiscal affairs , made even more challenging due to the state 's " extremely limited economic and population base " , the economic depression of the late teens and early twenties , a lack of experience in banking on the part of state politicians and citizens , and other factors . " Indiana banking rested on shaky foundation even in the prosperous years preceding the Panic of 1819 . " To remedy the problem , Jennings signed legislation in 1817 to create the First State Bank of Indiana by converting the Bank of Vincennes , established under a territorial charter in 1814 , into the new bank 's main headquarters and established three new branches at Corydon , Brookville , and <unk> . The First State Bank soon became a depository of federal funds and was involved in land speculation . The Farmers and Mechanics Bank of Madison , established in 1814 , chose to remain separate from the state bank under a territorial charter that was valid until 1835 . 
 When state expenditures exceeded its revenues , Jennings preferred to secure the state 's debts with bank loans to cover the shortfall rather than issuing treasury notes . Although taxes were levied and the state borrowed from the First State Bank of Indiana , the state 's fiscal status remained bleak , worsened by the economic depression of 1819 . Around 1820 federal deposits at the First State Bank were suspended and the bank 's notes were no longer accepted for purchases from federal land offices . Numerous reports of corruption at the Bank of Vincennes and the collapse of land values , brought on by the panic of 1819 , put the bank in further financial distress . By 1821 the bank was insolvent . In June 1822 the Knox County circuit court declared the First State Bank had forfeited its charter . In November 1823 the Indiana Supreme Court upheld the termination of the bank 's charter and concluded that the First State Bank had " embezzled " $ 250 @,@ 000 of federal deposits , issued more paper than it could redeem , had debt exceeding the limited allowed under its charter , established more branches than its capital and specie could support , paid shareholders large dividends , and took steps to dissolve without paying debts owed . For several years after the First State Bank 's failure , Indiana citizens depended on the Bank of the United States , with a branch in Louisville , and the Farmers and Mechanics Bank of Madison for financial services . Farmers and Mechanics Banks fared better than the First State Bank of Indiana , but its charter expired on January 1 , 1835 , and its paper passed at depreciated rates for several years . Jennings was criticized for not monitoring the state 's banks more carefully and investigating bank officials for potential wrongdoing . 
 Most of Jennings second term was spent grappling with the state 's continuing financial difficulties . When tax revenues and land sales remained low , the state 's revenue was not sufficient to repay the bonds it used to finance internal improvements . The Indiana General Assembly was forced to significantly depreciate the value of its bonds , harming the state 's credit and making it difficult to secure new loans . 
 During his tenure as governor Jennings nominated three candidates to the Indiana Supreme Court : John Johnson , James Scott , and Jesse Lynch Holman . All three were quickly confirmed by the state legislature . 
 = = = Treaty of St. Mary 's = = = 
 In late 1818 , Jennings was appointed as a federal commissioner , along with Lewis Cass and Benjamin Parke , to negotiate a treaty with the Native Americans ( Potawatomi , Wea , Miami , and Delaware ) , who lived in the northern and central parts of Indiana . The Treaty of St. Mary 's allowed the State of Indiana to purchase millions of acres of land north of an 1809 treaty line and extending west to the Wabash River and two more parcels of land , which opened most of central Indiana to American settlement . The appointment created a crisis in Jennings 's political career . Because the state constitution prohibited a person from holding a federal government position while exercising duties as the state 's governor , Jennings 's political enemies seized the opportunity to force him from office by arguing that he had vacated the governor 's office when he accepted the federal appointment . 
 Lieutenant Governor Christopher Harrison claimed that Jennings had " abandoned " his elected office and took over as the state 's acting governor in Jennings 's absence . In the meantime the Indiana House of Representatives launched an investigation . When Jennings learned of the situation , he was " mortified " that his actions were being questioned and burned the documents he received from the federal government that related to his assignment . The legislature called Jennings and Harrison to appear for questioning ; however , Jennings declined , stating the assembly did not have the authority to interrogate him , and Harrison refused to appear unless the assembly recognized him as the acting governor . Because neither of the two men would meet with the legislature , the assembly demanded copies of the documents that Jennings received from the federal government to prove he was not acting as its agent . Jennings responded : 
 If I were in possession of any public documents calculated to advance the public interest , it would give me pleasure to furnish them , and I shall at all times be prepared to afford you any information which the constitution or laws of the State may require .... If the difficulty , real or supposed , has grown out of the circumstances of my having been connected with the negotiation at St Mary 's , I feel it my duty to state to the committee that I acted from an entire conviction of its propriety and an anxious desire , on my part , to promote the welfare and accomplish the wishes of the whole people of the State in assisting to add a large and fertile tract of country to that which we already possess . 
 The legislature summoned everyone in the surrounding area who had any knowledge of the events at Saint Mary 's , but found that no one was certain of Jennings 's role in the commission . After a short debate , the House passed a resolution , voting 15 to 13 , to recognize Jennings as governor and dropped it proceedings against him . The House votes opposing Jennings came largely from the state 's western counties . Harrison was outraged by the decision and resigned as lieutenant governor . 
 In 1820 Harrison ran against Jennings in his reelection bid . Jennings won the election by a large majority , 11 @,@ 256 votes to Harrison 's 2 @,@ 008 . Jennings 's win by a three @-@ to @-@ one margin suggests he remained a popular politician and the state 's voters were not overly concerned by attacks on the governor 's character . 
 = = = Personal financial problems = = = 
 Jennings 's personal finances suffered from the panic of 1819 , while the Indiana governorship continued to increase his financial burden . Jennings was never able to recover from his debts . One historian suggests that Jennings 's financial situation may arisen from the expenses incurred during his political campaigns , his long @-@ time service in state government , and being too busy to adequately manage his farm . Jennings and his wife frequently entertained visitors , legislators , and other dignitaries at their Corydon home . At a high @-@ profile dinner in 1819 , he hosted President James Monroe and General Andrew Jackson at a dinner held in their honor in Jeffersonville , when the two leaders were making a tour of the frontier states . In 1822 Jennings solicited a $ 1 @,@ 000 personal loan from the <unk> in a letter to his political ally , George Rapp , but his request was denied . Jennings was able to secure personal loans from friends by granting mortgages on his land . Earlier in his career as a land speculator at Vincennes , when land prices decreased significantly , he was forced to sell several tracts of land at a loss . 
 By the late 1820s Jennings was critically short of cash . He depended on income from political office to pay his expenses . His farm was not likely to provide sufficient financial support . Because the thirty @-@ eight @-@ year @-@ old Jennings was prohibited by law from running for reelection to a third term as Indiana governor in 1823 , he was forced to consider other political options . Jennings decided to return to Congress . 
 = = = Return to Congress = = = 
 In September 1822 , shortly before his second term as governor expired , Jennings became a candidate for Congress after William Hendricks resigned his seat to run for Indiana governor . A special election was held on August 5 , 1822 , to fill Hendricks 's vacant seat in Congress . At the same time , the state 's increased population gave Indiana three congressional seats . A regular congressional election was held on the same day to elect three Indiana congressmen . Jennings and Davis Floyd were the principal candidates in the special election , which Jennings won . In the regular election to fill the seat for Indiana 's Second Congressional District , Jennings easily won , defeating James Scott by a wide margin . Jennings became a Democratic @-@ Republican to the 17th Congress and Lieutenant Governor Ratliff Boon succeeded him as governor . Hendricks ran unopposed and was subsequently elected as governor to succeed Boon . Jennings won reelection to Congress and represented Indiana 's Second District until in 1830 . He became a Jacksonian Republican in the 18th Congress , but switched his allegiance , becoming an Adams Republican in the 19th and 20th Congresses , and then aligned with the Anti @-@ Jacksonians in the 21st Congress . 
 Jennings continued to promote internal infrastructure improvements throughout his term in Congress . He introduced legislation to build more forts in the northwest , to grant federal funding for improvement projects in Indiana and Ohio , and led the debate in support of using federal funds to build the nations longest canal , Wabash and Erie Canal , through Indiana . He introduced a legislative amendment that made a provision to locate and survey the National Road to the west , toward the Mississippi River , so the people living in Indiana and Illinois would have some assurance that the road 's large federal appropriation would benefit them directly . Jennings helped secure appropriation of funds to survey the Wabash River and make it more accessible to year @-@ round steamboat travel . 
 In his reelection as the Second District congressman , Jennings supported tariff protection and internal improvements and vowed to support the presidential candidate that his constituents preferred if the election went to the House to decide the winner . Jennings won reelection to Congress in a close race , beating Jeremiah Sullivan of Madison . In the presidential election of 1824 American political parties organized around three candidates : Andrew Jackson running against John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay . Jennings favored Adams , and later , Clay ; however , when the contested presidential election passed to the House in 1825 , Jennings voted with the majority and gave his political support to Jackson , but he was defeated in the House and Adams became president . Indiana voters who supported Jackson hoped for a victory in the next election . 
 Jennings , seeking to advance his political career , ran for the Senate twice , but was defeated in both attempts . In 1825 he was a senate candidate at a time when the Indiana General Assembly elected the state 's senators to Congress . On the first ballot Isaac Blackford came in first , the incumbent governor , William Hendricks , came in second , and Jennings was third . On the fourth ballot Hendricks won the senate seat . In his second attempt Jennings lost to James Noble . 
 Jennings 's wife died in 1826 after a protected illness ; the couple had no children . Jennings was deeply saddened by her loss and began to drink liquor more heavily . Later that year he married Clarissa Barbee , but his drinking condition only worsened and he was frequently inebriated . 
 While serving in Congress , Jennings 's health continued to decline as he struggled with alcohol addiction and suffered from severe rheumatism . In 1827 ceiling plaster from Jennings 's Washington D.C. boarding room fell on his head , severely injuring him , and ill health limited his ability to visit his constituents , but he continued to remain a popular politician in Indiana . In the congressional election of 1826 , Jennings ran unopposed . He won reelection in 1828 , soundly defeating his opponent , Indiana 's lieutenant governor , John H. Thompson . Jennings did not publicly favor a presidential candidate and won the Second District seat with support from voters who favored Jackson and Adams . During Jennings 's final term in office House journals show that he introduced no legislation , was frequently not present to vote on matters , and only once delivered a speech . Jennings 's friends , led by Senator John Tipton , took note of his situation and took action to block Jennings 's reelection bid when his drinking became a political liability . John Carr , anti @-@ Jackson man , opposed Jennings in a six @-@ way race for the congressional seat and won the election . Tipton had arranged for others to enter the race and divide Jennings 's supporters . Jennings left office on March 3 , 1831 .

 Jennings was twice @-@ elected Grand Master of the Indiana Grand Lodge of Freemasons , serving in 1824 and 1825 . He declined reelection in 1825 . 
 = = = Retirement = = = 
 Jennings retired with his wife , Clarissa , to his home in Charlestown . Tipton may have felt it had been mistake to force Jennings out of public service and hoped that work would force him to give up alcohol . In 1831 Tipton secured Jennings an appointment to negotiate a treaty with native tribes in northern Indiana . Jennings attended the negotiations of the Treaty of Tippecanoe , but the delegation failed in their attempt . Afterwards , Jennings returned to his farm , where his health steadily declined . He continued drinking alcohol , spending considerable time a local tavern , and was frequently discovered sleeping in streets or in roadside ditches . <unk> 's alcoholism worsened to the point where he was no longer able to tend his farm . Without a steady income Jennings 's creditors began moving to seize his estate . In 1832 Tipton acquired the mortgage on Jennings 's farm and enlisted the help of a local financier , James Lanier , to acquire the debts on Jennings 's other holdings . Tipton allowed Jennings to remain on his mortgaged farm for the remainder of Jennings 's life and encouraged Lanier to grant the same permission . 
 Jennings died of a heart attack , most likely brought on by another bout with jaundice , on July 26 , 1834 , at his farm near Charlestown . He was fifty years old . Jennings was buried after a brief ceremony in an unmarked grave . His estate lacked the funds to purchase a headstone . Jennings 's creditors , many of whom were his neighbors , were left unpaid and disgruntled . Following Jennings 's death , Tipton sold the Jennings farm to Joseph Carr and gave Jennings 's widow a $ 100 gift from the proceeds .

 In the late nineteenth century several attempts were made to erect a monument honoring Jennings 's public service . On three separate occasions , in 1861 , 1869 and 1889 , petitions were brought before the Indiana General Assembly to erect a marker for Jennings 's grave , but each attempt failed . In 1892 the state legislature finally granted the petition to erect a monument in his honor . Around the same time , after Jennings 's unmarked gravesite was independently verified by three witnesses to his burial , his body was exhumed and reinterred at a new site at the Charlestown cemetery . 
 Jonathan Jennings Elementary School in Charlestown and Jennings County are both named in his honor . 
 = = = Political impact = = = 
 Historians have offered varied interpretations of Jennings 's life and his impact on the development of Indiana . The state 's early historians , William Wesley Woollen and Jacob Piatt Dunn Jr . , wrote of Jennings in an almost mythical manner , focusing on the strong positive leadership he provided Indiana in its formative years . Dunn referred to Jennings as the " young Hercules " , praising his crusade against Harrison and slavery . Woolen 's assessment was also positive : " Indiana owes him a debt more than she can compute . " During the prohibition era in the early twentieth century , historians Logan Esarey and Arthur Blythe were more critical of Jennings . Esarey , who wrote about Jennings during the height of Prohibition , when attitudes towards alcohol consumption was particularly harsh , was highly critical of Jennings 's alcoholism and destitution . Blythe described Jennings 's abilities as " mediocre . " Esarey argued that Jennings " took no decisive stand " on the important issues and dismissed his importance and impact on Indiana , saying the legislature and its leading men set the tone of the era . In 1954 John Barnhart and Donald <unk> described Jennings as a " shrewd politician rather than a statesman " , whose leadership was " not evident " at the 1816 convention . <unk> argued that Jennings 's " intemperance and poverty , should not obscure his significant contributions as territorial delegate to Congress , president of the Corydon Constitutional Convention , first state governor , and congressman . " 
 Modern historians , Howard Peckham , Randy Mills , Andrew R. L. Cayton , and Dorothy Riker , argue that Jennings 's legacy may lie " somewhere between the two extremes " of Dunn 's and Esarey 's assessments . Mills agrees with Woollen that Indiana owes Jennings a debt of gratitude . Although Jennings 's accomplishments were not extensive , he did a " commendable " job for his stewardship of a state in " transition to a more democratic form of government " . Cayton describes Jennings as " ambitious " , " passionate " , " hot @-@ tempered " , and " moody " . He argues that Jennings was a successful campaigner , but an " indifferent " statesman and governor who was " not very good at laying out an agenda and achieving its implementation " . 
 Jennings believed in popular democracy , opposed slavery , and despised aristocrats , especially William Henry Harrison , for " trampling on the rights of his fellow Americans . " His service as Indiana 's governor and representative to Congress came at the end of one political era and the beginning of another , when governmental power and authority shifted from the governor and his patronage appointments to the state legislature and elected officials .

 = A More Perfect Union : Advancing New American Rights = 
 A More Perfect Union : Advancing New American Rights or simply A More Perfect Union is non @-@ fiction political analysis written by United States Congressman Jesse Jackson , Jr. in collaboration with Frank <unk> Watkins is a political theorist , activist and was the press secretary to Jackson at the time . It was released in hardcover format on October 15 , 2001 and in paperback format on April 25 , 2008 . The material for Jackson 's book , his third , came from three trips he took in 1997 – 98 to American Civil War battlefields . Although Watkins is credited , the biographical content of the book is written as a first person narrative as if written solely by Jackson . 
 The National Park Service has twenty @-@ eight national Civil War historic sites . Jackson and White visited approximately twenty battlefields in August 1997 , December 1997 and the spring of 1998 . Jackson 's wife , Sandi Jackson , participated in the third trip . The trips heightened a belief of Jackson 's that race as it relates to African Americans has been the focal point of social and political existence in American history . Since Jackson is not the first to present such a realization , he presents a North @-@ South schism lens through which to view the congressional politics of race . 
 The book contains about 75 pages of biographical / autobiographical content which provide context for the subsequent political analysis . Critical reviews do not analyze the biographical content . Instead , the reviews focus on the political analysis of race , economic issues , geographical divide , and states ' rights as well as the constitutional amendments proposed in this book . 
 = = Summary = = 
 The title of the book comes from the Preamble to the United States Constitution . The preamble includes the phrase " in Order to form a more perfect Union " as the first specifically mentioned purpose of the United States Constitution . 
 The book has several sections . The first four chapters relate autobiographical details to his experience in touring the Civil War battle sites . In the subsequent section , he discusses federalism . In the third section he describes his economic plan . Then , Jackson outlines eight constitutional amendments . In the final section , he discusses achieving these policy goals set forth in the third and fourth sections . On March 4 , 2003 , Jackson proposed these eight amendments . The book includes full chapters for each amendment . The eight amendments are as follows : 
 the right to public education of equal high quality ; 
 the right to health care of equal high quality ; 
 equal rights for women ; 
 the right to decent , safe , sanitary and affordable housing ; 
 the right to a clean , safe and sustainable environment ; 
 the right . . . to full employment and balanced economic growth ; 
 the explicit fundamental right of citizens to vote ; and 
 an amendment regarding taxing the people of the United States progressively . 
 The Education Amendment which reads " ( 1 ) All persons shall enjoy the right to a public education of equal high quality ; and ( 2 ) The Congress shall have the power to enforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation , " has received public attention for several years . Jackson feels that his amendment is a natural response to San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez , 411 U.S. 1 ( 1973 ) , which determined that an education is not a constitutionally protected fundamental right . 
 An important theme of the book is the North @-@ South relationship as it influences the extent of federalism in the United States . The book describes how from before the Civil War to well after the Civil Rights Movement the balance of power between protectors of state 's rights and defenders of the federal government have battled over resources and power along North @-@ South alliances . Jackson is a detractor of state 's rights and feels that the extensive power given to states has slowed our broad distribution of social goods by perpetuating inequality and thus unrest . Dyson also notes that Jackson attempts to bring class to the forefront of the discourse in an effort to offer a political vision toward social equity and equality . He says Jackson views race as the lens to optimally view American history and views economic issues as the hearing aid through which the politics of today can best be heard . 
 = = Reviews = = 
 In a review for the Chicago Sun @-@ Times , Michael Eric Dyson described the book as " intellectually accomplished and remarkably insightful " . He views Jackson 's eight new amendments as " the political backbone and intellectual infrastructure for the expression of a new politics of race and class that strengthen the status of all suffering Americans . " He encourages understanding the book because it provides a fresh social perspective to addresses current fundamental American political and racial problems . 
 Writing for the Chicago Tribune , Playboy editor John Thomas described the amendments as sensible , but pointed out that some view them as an attempt to legislate policy decisions . Thomas perceived the benefit of the plan to be the fact that the force of the constitution would uphold the amendments , and that this would compel actions to support both political promises and the constitutional tenets . 
 At one stop on the book tour associated with the publication and release of the book at the David A. Clarke School of Law of the University of the District of Columbia , Jackson 's message was perceived as saying that American history can be studied as an analysis of race , but that economics and the tension between states ’ rights and federal rights are the true basis of a domestic history revolving around pursuit of economic development , political power , and personal freedom . He then advanced the theory that these pursuits would most be most readily attained by adopting a set of new constitutional amendments , guaranteeing rights primarily grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , which the U.S. has ratified . Each is discussed in a separate chapter : the rights to quality health care , housing , education , a clean environment , fair taxes , full employment , equality for women , and the right to vote .

 During the promotion of the book there was a controversy when a book @-@ signing party in <unk> , Illinois morphed into a fundraiser without Jackson 's knowledge . When Jackson realized what happened he wrote to the Federal Election Commission and the House Ethics Committee to explain what happened and seek their advice . Jackson decided to return the entire $ 1300 that was raised . 
 An outgrowth of Jackson 's trip was the realization that the National Park Service does not represent the underlying issue of slavery contextually in its battlefield displays and presentations . Instead of presenting the battles as political and moral issues , Jackson felt racial context and relevance needed to be presented in a more forward way . As a result , in 2000 , he <unk> the United States Department of the Interior 's appropriation to include a directive to have United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt use his influence over the superintendents of the national parks to encourage greater inclusion of slavery and social issues in Civil War presentations . 
 = Typhoon Nangka ( 2015 ) = 
 Typhoon Nangka was a large and strong tropical cyclone that impacted central Japan in July 2015 . Nangka started its long @-@ living journey as a tropical disturbance over the Marshall Islands and west of the International Dateline , becoming the eleventh named storm of the annual typhoon season on July 3 . It quickly intensified while moving to the west @-@ northwest , attaining typhoon status on July 6 . Nangka moved through the Northern Marianas Islands , passing directly over the uninhabited island of Alamagan . Shortly thereafter , the typhoon attained peak winds ; the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) estimated 10 ‑ minute sustained winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) , while the unofficial Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) estimated 1 ‑ minute winds of 250 km / h ( 155 mph ) , making it a super typhoon . Nangka later weakened as it curved to the north , moving across central Japan on July 16 as a minimal typhoon . The storm weakened soon after , dissipating in the Sea of Japan on July 18 . 
 The storm first affected the Marshall Islands , bringing strong winds to the capital Majuro . Half of the city lost power , and several boats were sunk . Minimal effects were reported in the Northern Marianas Islands , and later the storm 's flow enhanced the monsoon over the Philippines . Effects were worst in Japan , where rainfall reached 740 mm ( 29 in ) in <unk> , Nara Prefecture . Total damage across the Kansai region reached ¥ 18 billion ( US $ 150 million ) . Nangka killed two people in Japan , injured 55 , and damaged or flooded 220 houses . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A westerly wind burst spawned Typhoon Chan @-@ hom and Tropical Storm Linfa across the western Pacific Ocean , as well as the system that would become Typhoon Nangka . On July 1 , an area of pulsing convection persisted east of the Marshall Islands , associated with a poorly @-@ defined circulation . Low wind shear , water sea surface temperatures , and good outflow favored further development . The circulation gradually became more defined as the convection organized more . At 18 : 00 UTC on July 2 , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) classified the system as a tropical depression , about 80 km ( 50 mi ) east of Aur Atoll . Based on the increasing organization , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) classified the system as Tropical Depression 11W at 12 : 00 UTC on July 3 . About six hours later , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Nangka . 
 When Nangka was upgraded to a tropical storm by the JTWC early on July 4 , convective bands were wrapping into the center , but limited by dry air to the west . By that time , the storm was moving to the west @-@ northwest , steered by the subtropical ridge to the north . On July 5 , the JMA upgraded the storm to a severe tropical storm . By that time , the circulation had become exposed due to moderate wind shear , although the outflow had improved . On July 6 after shear diminished , Nangka began to quickly intensify as it developed an eye in the center of the blossoming convection . As a result , the JTWC upgraded the storm to typhoon status at 06 : 00 UTC , followed by the JMA at 12 : 00 UTC . Nangka reached its first peak intensity at 12 : 00 UTC on July 7 , when JMA estimated 10 minute sustained winds 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . The typhoon was aided by excellent radial outflow enhanced by a TUTT cell to the northwest , and it developed a well @-@ defined eye 48 km ( 30 mi ) in diameter . 
 After its first peak in intensity , Nangka slightly weakened as convection along the west side of the system was restricted due to the TUTT cell , and the eye became cloud @-@ filled . Decreasing wind shear and increasing sea surface temperatures allowed the intensification trend to resume , and the structure became more symmetric late on July 8 as it moved toward the Northern Marianas Islands . A well @-@ defined inner eye re @-@ developed inside of an outer eyewall . On July 9 , the JTWC upgraded Nangka to a super typhoon , estimating peak 1 minute winds of 250 km / h ( 155 mph ) . The JMA also assessed a 10 minute peak of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . At 06 : 00 UTC on July 9 , the eye of Nangka passed over the uninhabited island of Alamagan . The typhoon later weakened while turning more to the west due to increased wind shear . The eye became cloud @-@ filled and was no longer visible by July 11 , although the organization was sustained by good outflow to the south . However , the convection reorganized the next day and the eye reformed . By that time , Nangka was slowing and nearly stationary as the subtropical ridge receded to the east . 
 On July 13 , Typhoon Nangka began moving northward toward Japan through a break in the ridge . The typhoon completed an eyewall replacement cycle , and according to the JTWC attained a secondary peak of 195 km / h ( 120 mph ) . The re @-@ intensification was also aided by a decrease in wind shear , but was short @-@ lived due to drier air from the north and west . As the eye became more ragged , the winds continued to decrease . At 14 : 00 UTC on July 16 , Nangka made landfall along the Japanese island of Shikoku near Muroto , Kōchi , still at typhoon status . Four hours later , the typhoon weakened into a severe tropical storm , and after crossing the Seto Inland Sea , Nangka made a second landfall on Honshu near Kurashiki , Okayama at 21 : 00 UTC . The convection greatly weakened as it crossed Honshu into the Sea of Japan , and the storm deteriorated further due to lower water temperatures . At 12 : 00 UTC on July 17 , the JMA downgraded Nangka to a tropical depression , and early the next day the JTWC discontinued advisories . On July 18 , Nangka dissipated in the central Sea of Japan . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 On Majuro atoll in the Marshall Islands , the developing Nangka produced strong westerly winds near gale force , producing high waves and flooding along the lagoon . At least 25 vessels in the island 's lagoon broke loose from or were dragged by their moorings . High winds from Nangka tore roofs from homes and downed trees and power lines . Nearly half of the nation 's capital , Majuro , was left without power . Tony <unk> , the Marshall Island 's foreign minister , stated " Majuro [ is ] like a war zone . " Some coastal flooding was also noted , which resulted in crop damage . 
 Ahead of the storm , the Guam National Weather Service issued a typhoon watch for Agrihan , Pagan , and Alamagan , as well as a high surf advisory for Guam . The watch was later upgraded to a warning , and was canceled after the typhoon exited the region . Flights were delayed or canceled to the region due to the storm and problems with the local aircraft communication system . During the storm , there were minor power outages on Saipan in two villages that were quickly restored . On Alamagan where the storm struck , six people rode out the storm in a concrete bunker . 
 In the Philippines , the flow from the storm increased the southwest monsoon , causing flash floods and landslides in some areas . The outskirts of the storm later brushed the east coast of South Korea , producing 26 mm ( 1 @.@ 0 in ) in rainfall , and wind gusts of 93 km / h ( 58 mph ) .

 Due to the threat of the storm , nine airlines canceled 214 flights across Japan . Meanwhile , rail service and highways were disrupted , with a portion of the Chūō Expressway closed , and ferry rides were canceled . The Shikoku Railway Company canceled service during the storm and limited rides along the West Japan Railway Company . About 860 @,@ 000 people were advised or ordered to evacuate their homes , including 88 @,@ 100 people from 15 @,@ 400 homes who were forced to leave . After the storm passed , residents were allowed to return home . 
 While moving through Japan , Nangka produced peak wind gusts of 153 km / h ( 95 mph ) in Muroto , Kōchi . Heavy rains impacted much of central Japan , peaking at 740 mm ( 29 in ) in <unk> , Nara Prefecture . Owase , Mie recorded 357 @.@ 5 mm ( 14 @.@ 07 in ) over 24 hours . The highest hourly rainfall was 84 mm ( 3 @.@ 3 in ) in Saijō , Ehime . Kawauchi , Fukushima recorded 77 @.@ 5 mm ( 3 @.@ 05 in ) over one hour , setting a record for the month of July . 
 The rains from Nangka caused rivers to exceed their banks . In Tokushima Prefecture , the Naka River flooded to the second story of nearby school buildings . Flooding stranded 1 @,@ 600 passengers on a train for four hours , which had been traveling from Tsuruga , Fukui to Himeji , Hyōgo . Across Japan , strong waves and high winds killed over 11 @,@ 000 bluefin tuna on a fish farm in Kushimoto , accounting for ¥ 1 @.@ 29 billion ( $ 10 @.@ 4 million ) in losses . About 15 @,@ 000 people lost power across the country . The storm damaged 30 homes and flooded another 190 , and also damaged farming equipment . There were 55 injuries and two deaths related to the typhoon , including an elderly man who drowned after falling into a ditch . Total damage in the Kansai region reached ¥ 18 billion ( US $ 150 million ) , including ¥ 7 @.@ 1 billion ( US $ 58 @.@ 9 million ) in Wakayama Prefecture and ¥ 4 @.@ 9 billion ( US $ 40 @.@ 7 million ) in Hyogo Prefecture . Total economic losses are estimated to be in excess of ¥ 24 billion ( US $ 200 million ) . 
 = River Rother , West Sussex = 
 The River Rother flows from <unk> in Hampshire , England , to Stopham in West Sussex , where it joins the River Arun . The upper river , from its source to Midhurst , has been used to power watermills , with the earliest recorded use being in 1086 , when the Domesday survey was conducted . Although none are still operational , many of the buildings which housed the mills still exist , and in some cases , still retain their milling machinery . This upper section is also noted for a number of early bridges , which have survived since their construction in the fifteenth , sixteenth and seventeenth centuries . 
 The lower river , from Midhurst to its junction with the River Arun , has been used for navigation . Boats used the section from the Arun to Fittleworth following improvements made to the Arun in 1615 , and after the Arun Navigation was completed in 1790 , the Earl of Egremont made the river navigable up to Midhurst by constructing eight locks and some small cuts . The work was completed in 1794 , and many of the bridges built at that time still survive . With the opening of the Mid @-@ Sussex Railway branch to Midhurst in 1859 , traffic declined , and commercial use of the river had ceased by the 1880s . Pleasure boats continued to be used on the river for many years , and published accounts of journeys along the decaying navigation appeared in 1914 and 1920 . The navigation was officially abandoned in 1936 , after an undergraduate pointed out that it was still a public right of way . 
 The river flows through the South Downs National Park , and is a designated Site of Nature Conservation Importance , in recognition of its value for wildlife . It supports a wide range of fish , and its upper reaches are the only location in Sussex where native white clawed crayfish can be found . The quality of the water is generally good , and the river is measured at four gauging stations , three on the main channel , and one of the River Lod , just before its junction with the Rother . Water from the underlying Lower Greensand aquifer and the adjacent chalk aquifer helps to maintain the flows during the summer months , despite the fact that large volumes are abstracted from both the aquifers and the river for the public water supply . 
 = = History = = 
 Following improvements to the River Arun in 1615 , which allowed boats to reach Pallingham , they could also navigate part of the Rother , as far upstream as Fittleworth . The canal engineer William Jessop was asked to survey the river below Petworth Mills in 1783 , and was recalled in 1790 , when he surveyed it below Midhurst . In the same year , the construction of the Arun Navigation was finished , and in 1791 , George Wyndham , 3rd Earl of Egremont , who was based at Petworth House , obtained an Act of Parliament which would enable him to improve the Rother . The Act also authorised a branch canal to Petworth . Since he owned most of the land adjacent to the river , the precise route of the navigation was not specified , and he was free to improve the channel or make cuts as he saw fit . The only restriction was that cuts could not be made through gardens or enclosed grounds . Compared to most other canals at the time , the charges for using the navigation were low , as the Earl wanted to develop the region rather than make a profit . 
 The river 's lower section , below Midhurst , was made navigable by the construction of the Western Rother Navigation in 1794 . The length of the navigation was 11 @.@ 25 miles ( 18 @.@ 11 km ) of which less than 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) consisted of new cuts , with the rest following the existing channel . It rose through 54 feet ( 16 m ) from Stopham to Midhurst by a series of eight locks , and cost £ 13 @,@ 300 to build . Traffic consisted of coal transported up @-@ river , with cargoes of timber , corn and Petworth marble in the other direction . A branch connected it to Petworth by the short Petworth Canal , which was 1 @.@ 25 miles ( 2 @.@ 0 km ) long with two locks , and terminated at <unk> to the south of the town . It was opened in 1793 , having cost the Earl £ 5 @,@ 000 to build , but only lasted for a few years , until a turnpike road was diverted . This made access to Petworth easier , and the canal ceased to be used . 
 Unlike many canals , where navvies were brought into the neighbourhood to carry out the work , the Earl employed local men on the project , most of them already employed by him , and a clergyman praised him for this when writing in 1808 , as it led to much less disruption , but provided increased income for those who worked on the scheme . Wages rose from 8 or 9 shillings ( 40 @-@ <unk> ) per week to 14 or 15 shillings ( 70 @-@ <unk> ) . During his life , the Earl invested some £ 100 @,@ 000 in waterways , some in his native county of Sussex , but also in attempts to build a canal from London to Portsmouth . Between 1802 and 1831 , the average income from the canal was around £ 550 per year . Competition arrived in 1859 , when the Mid @-@ Sussex Railway opened a line from Horsham through Pulborough to Petworth . Traffic declined , and by the 1880s , the navigation was no longer used by commercial boats , although it was not officially abandoned until 1936 . 
 = = = Closure = = = 
 Despite the navigation being closed , a guide to Midhurst published in 1895 advertised that skiffs could be hired , and fishing could be enjoyed . The boats were hired out by a plumber called William Port , and his business continued to prosper until 1912 , when his boathouse burned down . Rowing boats were also available for hire at Coultershaw and Fittleworth . Another book called A New <unk> 's Guide , published in 1896 , suggested that the river could be canoed from Iping to the Arun , a distance of 19 miles ( 31 km ) , when there was sufficient water . By that time , none of the locks were workable , and boats had to be carried around them . 
 In 1887 , part of the river bank near <unk> Lock , which bordered the Cowdray estate of the Earl of Egmont , had collapsed , and the Earl suggested that Lord Leconfield of Petworth , a successor to the Earl of Egremont , should pay for its repair . After some disagreement , a compromise was reached , under which the bank was repaired and a floodgate was fitted at the upper end of the lock , with both men paying half of the cost . Lord Leconfield assumed that when the Arun Navigation finally obtained an Act of Abandonment in 1896 , his responsibilities for the maintenance of the River Rother had ended . However , in 1903 heavy rain and floods destroyed the floodgate and part of the adjacent weir , resulting in river levels though the 8th Earl of Egmont 's estate dropping by 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 6 m ) . The Earl , Augustus Arthur Perceval , issued a writ against Lord Leconfield for damages . The case was heard in the High Court , at which it was agreed that the navigation was now useless , but that the two men would share the costs of rebuilding the floodgate , after which responsibility for its maintenance would pass to the Earl , who could also dredge the river above the lock . 
 P Bonthron , who published a book entitled My Holidays on Inland Waterways in 1916 , described a journey down the river that he had made with friends in 1908 , in a boat hired from William Port at Midhurst . They reached Arundel on the River Arun after two days , from where the boat was sent back to Midhurst by train . Another account of a similar journey made in 1914 by Eleanor Barnes and a friend appeared in As the Water Flows , first published in 1920 , which described canoe journeys on the rivers of southern England made by her over a period of seven or eight years . The warrant of abandonment was obtained jointly by the estates at Petworth and Cowdray after an Oxford undergraduate called Roger <unk> pointed out that the river was still officially a right of way , and that anyone could therefore offer to pay the appropriate tolls to use a boat on it , and expect the owners to rebuild the locks . The powers of the Railway & Canal Traffic Act 1888 were invoked to declare that the navigation was no longer necessary , and despite objections from the River Arun Catchment Board and a canoe club , the warrant was granted on 15 April 1936 . However , the Environment Agency noted in 2003 that although there used to be navigation rights on the river , " the existing status of the navigation is unknown . " 
 = = Hydrology = = 
 The river flows through the South Downs , an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and since 2011 , a designated national park . There are two large aquifers in the area , one consisting of chalk , to the south of the river valley , and the other the Lower Greensand Group , underlying the whole of the river . The aquifers are separated by a Gault Formation , which consists of clay . At the western edge of the region , both the chalk and the gault turn to the north , creating a scarp slope . The base flow of the river consists of water from the Lower Greensand aquifer , and from springs along the bottom of the chalk scarp slope . These help to maintain the flows in the river during the summer months , although there have been significant periods where flows have been low , notably in the drought of the early 1990s , and again in 1995 / 96 . These led to declines in the populations of the macro @-@ invertebrates which are used to measure the health of a river , but these have subsequently recovered . In order to monitor the hydrology , the Environment Agency has a series of observation boreholes along the valley , and maintains gauging stations at Princes Marsh , close to the source , at Iping Mill , at Halfway Bridge on the River Lod just above its junction with the Rother , and at Hardham , just before the river joins the Arun . 
 Flows in the river are swelled by discharges from several sewage treatment works . The three largest are at Princes Marsh , Petersfield and Ambersham , all of which have outflows between 0 @.@ 22 and 1 @.@ 10 million imperial gallons ( 1 and 5 Ml ) per day , with another three discharging between 0 @.@ 022 and 0 @.@ 220 million imperial gallons ( 0 @.@ 1 and 1 Ml ) per day at Rogate , Coultershaw and Fittleworth . The entire river , including parts of some of its tributaries , is designated as a Site of Nature Conservation Importance by the local authorities through which it flows , in recognition of its value for wildlife . The upper reaches of the Rother are important for their fish populations of brown trout , grayling , juvenile sea trout , and the spawning and early development of salmonids . There are also populations of bullhead , eel , lamprey , minnow and stone loach . There has been some concern about declining fish stocks , thought to be partly caused by soil erosion , leading to silt and sediments being deposited on the river bed , which has been exacerbated by low flows in the river . Parts of the lower river support the same types of fish , but there are areas , particularly immediately upstream of weirs , where the major species are bream , pike and roach , with <unk> , dace and perch on the lowest reaches . In order to assist the movement of fish along the river , particularly those that migrate to the headwaters to spawn , fish passes have been constructed around the gauging stations . The only known population of native white clawed crayfish in Sussex is located in the upper reaches of the Rother . 
 The quality of the water is generally good , helped by the fact that the groundwater in the chalk aquifer is of very high quality . However , some of the small streams in the upper reaches are polluted by discharges of effluent which are not licensed , and there are areas where the water in the aquifer , and hence the river , has raised levels of nitrates , largely caused by agricultural fertilisers . The Environment Agency has produced improvement plans to address a number of sources of both agricultural and urban pollution . Natural flows in the river are affected by the abstraction of water for the public water supply . There are many locations at which water is abstracted along the course of the river , including a site in the upper reaches where more than 1 @.@ 1 million imperial gallons ( 5 Ml ) per day is <unk> from the aquifer , and another where the volume exceeds 2 @.@ 2 million imperial gallons ( 10 Ml ) . Just above the junction with the River Arun , the Hardham Water Treatment Works removes more than 2 @.@ 2 million imperial gallons ( 10 Ml ) per day from the river .

 The route description has been split into two sections . From its source to Midhurst , the river has powered several mills , but has never been navigable . Below Midhurst , it was navigable until the navigation closed in the 1880s . There were eight locks on this section , some of which bypassed additional water mills .

 The River Rother rises from several springs near <unk> in Hampshire . The main one supplies watercress beds , before passing under Mill Lane , to the south of the village . It continues eastwards , to reach Greatham Mill . The mill , together with the mill house and an attached barn , date from the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries , and are built of brick . Now Grade II listed . All of the original machinery of the mill is still in situ , but is not operational , as the water supply has been diverted . The stream turns to the south @-@ east , and passes under the A3 West Liss bypass , and Greatham Bridge , on the old route . It is joined by other streams , and turns south to reach Liss railway station . The railway and the river follow the same general route , and the river crosses under the railway five times before reaching Sheet . At the northern edge of the village , the river is joined by the Ashford Stream , and there is another mill . After passing under the A272 road , to the east of the village , it reaches Sheet Mill . 
 <unk> Brook joins from the west , and the course turns to the east . At <unk> , a hamlet which forms part of the civil parish of Rogate , it passes the ruins of Durford Abbey , a Premonstratensian monastery situated on the north bank . It is a scheduled ancient monument , and the site includes a threshing barn with a water wheel and associated drive shafts . On the south bank is Durford Mill . This mill house is a grade II listed structure , and was built of <unk> in 1770 . The mill itself has been modernised and enlarged , and is not listed . A little further downstream , Harting Road crosses the river at Durford Bridge , build in the early 1600s with four semi @-@ circular arches . It was restored in 1924 . To the north of <unk> , another hamlet in Rogate , North Lane crosses the river on <unk> Bridge , which has four round @-@ headed arches , and was probably built in the seventeenth century , but might be earlier . It is built of stone , and was restored in the eighteenth century . 
 To the north of <unk> , a hamlet in the civil parish of Trotton with Chithurst , is <unk> Mill . It is a grade II * listed structure , and consists of two mills , side by side . They were operational until 1966 . The north mill is a timber @-@ framed building , clad with weatherboarding , dating from the sixteenth century . The south mill was built of coursed stone rubble around 1750 . Although it has been converted into a house , it still contains two iron waterwheels , one for each mill , and its machinery . The earliest documentary evidence for the mill dates from 1635 . The adjacent mill house , parts of which date from the eighteenth century , is also a listed building . The river turns to the north to pass to the east of Trotton , and is crossed by Trotton Bridge , dating from the early 1600s , which has five ribbed arches . The river then turns to the east again at Chithurst , where Abbey House , an L @-@ shaped timber @-@ framed building dating from the fifteenth century , and the parish church , much of which dates from the eleventh century , are located on the north bank . An eighteenth century stone and brick bridge with two arches carries Chithurst Lane over the river . 
 Continuing eastwards , the river is crossed by Iping Bridge at Iping , a narrow stone bridge with five arches dating from the seventeenth century . To the west of the bridge is the site of Iping watermill . A mill was recorded there in the Domesday survey , completed in 1086 . By 1665 , there were the remains of a fulling mill at the site , and a wheat @-@ mill and malt @-@ mill , both part of the same building . It became a paper mill in the eighteenth century , and continued to operate until it was destroyed by fire in 1930 . At Stedham , part of the civil parish of Stedham with Iping , Stedham Lane crosses the river on a stone bridge with six segmental arches . Five of them date from the seventeenth century , with one later addition . The river then makes a large loop to the north , where Stedham Mill was situated . The mill building has been demolished , but the mill house is a listed structure . After the loop , <unk> Bridge , on the northern Edge of Midhurst , dates from the fifteenth or sixteenth centuries . It has four segmental arches , was restored in 1919 , and is a grade II * listed structure . 
 After another loop to the north , the river passes between Easebourne to the north east and Midhurst to the south west . The bridge which carries the A272 road has two wide arches , and was of ashlar construction . Although this structure is still in situ , it is difficult to see , as a pedestrian bridge has been built on the north west side , attached to the original bridge by cantilevers , and one of the two arches was widened in 1912 by the addition of another arch outside it . Below the bridge is the mill house and adjoining water mill of North Mill . The mill carries the date 1840 , and the house is of a similar age , although built in two stages . The river flows briefly to the south , passing Cowdray on the east bank , which is a scheduled ancient monument . It consists of a medieval fortified house , which is partly ruined , although some of it has been reused . It is situated within Cowdray Park , a grade II * listed landscaped park , which forms the grounds for Cowdray House , a nineteenth @-@ century mansion some 0 @.@ 75 miles ( 1 @.@ 2 km ) further east . On the opposite bank is a motte @-@ and @-@ bailey castle , dating from the twelfth century . Below this point , the river was navigable .

 The terminus of the Rother Navigation was on a side stream , at the southern edge of Midhurst . There was a wharf and basin , close to a road which is still called The Wharf , and an ashlar bridge crosses the navigation between the wharf and the junction with the main river . It was built in 1794 , and was restored in 1977 to commemorate the silver jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II . The first lock was near Little Topham farm . There was a lock cut across a loop to the north . <unk> Brook , which flows north from springs near Cocking , and then alongside the river for a short distance , joins below the site of the lock . The bridge at South Ambersham was built of stone rubble in 1791 , with a main arch across the navigation and a smaller arch to the north , which has been repaired with brick . Moorland Lock was on a straight cut across a large meander to the south , close to Moorlands Farm . <unk> Lock also bypasses a meander to the south , which fed <unk> Mill . The mill building dates from the eighteenth century , and has been converted into a house . The seventeenth @-@ century timber @-@ framed mill house is also a listed building . There was a motte castle immediately to the south of the mill . A modern timber yard and saw mill is located to the north of the lock site , and <unk> Bridge , which carries a minor road over the river , dates from the construction of the navigation . The River Lod joins on the north bank just below the bridge . 
 A widening in the modern river , close to the dismantled Midhurst branch of the London , Brighton and South Coast Railway , marks the site of <unk> Lock , with a weir to the south and the lock structure to the north . The fourth lock was Coultershaw Lock . The river at this point runs to the south , and there was a large meander to the west with a weir at its head . The mill stream ran to the east , and the lock was built just to the west of the mill . Coultershaw Bridge now carries the <unk> road over the mill stream , near which is Coultershaw Beam Pump ; it was built in 1782 to provide a better water supply to Petworth House . The pump is powered by a water wheel , cast at Cocking Foundry , which is 11 feet ( 3 @.@ 4 m ) in diameter . There were two corn mills and a malt mill recorded on the site in 1534 . The mill was modernised in 1910 , when turbines replaced the wheels , and standby engines were installed in 1919 . It was destroyed by fire in 1923 , and a steel @-@ framed concrete building replaced it . When it ceased to operate in 1972 , the building was demolished , but the beam pump , which was located beneath the building , was rescued and has been restored . The pump no longer performs its original function , but supplies a fountain near the visitor centre . 
 <unk> Lock was another where the lock cut was built across a large meander to the north . The bridge at the tail of the lock is built from red and grey brick , and has a single , round @-@ headed arch . It dates from the construction of the navigation , and is virtually unaltered . Nearby , the Petworth Canal headed northwards to <unk> Bridge . Below the end of the cut , the river is joined by the stream from Burton Mill Pond , which supplied an iron forge built in 1789 . It is crossed by <unk> Bridge , built in the nineteenth century from red brick with grey headers and a parapet in stone , with three segmental arches . At Lower Fittleworth , there is another mill building , although it is unused and in poor condition . It was built in 1628 and enlarged in 1742 . It stands in the grounds of the mill house , which was rebuilt in 1913 . The lock cut ran along the south @-@ western edge of the site . Fittleworth Bridge consists of a southern section , originally built in the sixteenth century , which was rebuilt between 1717 and 1739 , and modified when the navigation was built , to enable boats to pass through the centre arch . A north section , adjacent to the millpond , dates from 1811 @-@ 12 . 
 Near its junction with the River Arun , the river loops to the south in a large meander . A cut ran from the start of the meander to join the Arun above the original junction , with a lock towards the downstream end . The meander fed Hardham Corn Mill . A lock bypassed the mill and the millstream , to enable boats to reach the Hardham Tunnel cut , which headed south from a junction above the mill . The Tunnel Branch was destroyed by the construction of a water treatment works , and the modern weir near the mouth is much closer to the junction than the lock was .

 " I Hear You , I See You " was directed by Lawrence Trilling and written by Jason Katims , one of the executive directors of Parenthood . It marked the first appearance of William Baldwin , who is set to appear in at least eight episodes in the first half of the second season in his recurring role as Gordon Flint . Trilling said the characters will serve not only as Adam 's boss , but also an eventual love interest for Sarah , so they wanted an actor with both stature and comedic talent . Baldwin previously starred in the drama television series Dirty Sexy Money along with Parenthood co @-@ star Peter Krause , and Trilling felt their past experience working together helped Krause and Baldwin develop a quick rapport on Parenthood . " I Hear You , I See You " also included the return of Minka Kelly , who previously appeared in first season episodes as Gaby , Max 's therapist .

 = = Reception = = 
 In its original American broadcast , " I Hear You , I See You " was seen by an estimated average 7 @.@ 69 million viewers , according to Nielsen Media Research , with 8 @.@ 45 million viewers during the first half hour . The second half hour 's viewership was 6 @.@ 93 million , which was considered a major mid @-@ episode drop . It received a 2 @.@ 7 rating among adults between age 18 and 49 , an eight percent viewership drop compared to the first season premiere on March 2 , 2010 . This was despite a boost Parenthood was expected as a result of debuting after the season finale of NBC 's America 's Got Talent . The episode received generally positive reviews . Entertainment Weekly television writer Ken Tucker praised Jason Katims ' script and felt the episode gave all the actors adequate screen @-@ time while contributing to the overall shape of the series . Tucker particularly praised the new link formed between Sarah and Adam , the infusion of comic relief into Julia and Joel , and Sarah Ramos , who he said gave " the best acting of the night " as Haddie . 
 Mandi Bierly , also of Entertainment Weekly , also praised the premiere and drew particular attention to the scene with Sarah confronting Adam about stealing her idea . She said the scene shows the writers and actors " are not people afraid of letting an awkward , tension @-@ filled scene breathe " , and that kind of realism illustrates the strength of the show 's writing and acting . Camille Wright Felton of CNN said she loved the show , and particularly praised the subplot about Haddie learning to drive , as well as Adam 's response when Haddie asked if whether he and his wife had an agreement to ignore each other 's flaws : " Yeah , it 's called marriage . " However , Felton criticized Baldwin 's character , which she described as a " single @-@ minded boss who apparently exists as an island and doesn 't get that people have families and need to tend to family crises " . HitFix television columnist Alan Sepinwall felt the first half of the episode was too uneven in its mix of comedy and drama , but that it was later redeemed mainly by the scenes featuring Max , who he said " is the one character on the show who never feels inauthentic , and he kind of pulls everyone toward him " . Sepinwall praised the performance of Max Burkholder as Max , but described William Baldwin 's character as a " caricatured playboy boss " . 
 <unk> VanDerWerff , of The A.V. Club , also felt the first half was " a little too giggly and chaotic [ with ] every plotline devolving into the most obvious comedy possible " , and felt Baldwin 's boss character was too stereotypical . But he praised several later scenes , like the fight between Joel and Zeek , Crosby 's reaction to max 's tantrum , and Joel 's ambivalence about having another child . Not all reviews of " I Hear You , I See You " were positive . Movieline writer Julie Miller felt most of the episode 's subplots were unoriginal and uninteresting , including Sydney 's inquiries about where babies come from and Zeek making the roof worse by trying to repair it . Miller sarcastically wrote , " The show proved that it is not screwing around in its sophomore year by immediately tackling completely original family issues . " 
 = William Blake 's illustrations of On the Morning of Christ 's Nativity = 
 William Blake drew and painted illustrations for John Milton 's nativity ode On the Morning of Christ 's Nativity between 1803 and 1815 . A total of 16 illustrations are extant : two sets of six watercolours each , and an additional four drawings in pencil . 
 The dating of the sets is unknown , as is Blake 's intended sequence for the illustrations . The two sets of watercolours are known as the " Butts set " and the " Thomas set " , after their respective patrons , or as the " Huntington set " and the " Whitworth set " after the Huntington Library and the Whitworth Art Gallery , which now hold the sets in their collections . 
 = = Provenance = = 
 There is little record of the provenance of the Thomas set or the Butts set before 1852 and 1872 , which has led to disputes about the dating . What is known is that the " Thomas set " was commissioned by the Reverend Joseph Thomas , who had also commissioned illustrations to Milton 's Comus and Paradise Lost from Blake . No contract for the commission is extant , but the commissioning probably took place in 1809 , which is the year in which the illustrations were completed . Blake was eager to accept the commission , according to G. E. Bentley , because " Milton illustrations were a kind of work which Blake could not resist . " They presumably stayed in the Revd Thomas 's family until they were bought at Sotheby 's from an anonymous seller in 1872 . By 1876 they were in the collection of J.E. Taylor , who gave them to the Whitworth in 1892 . 
 Even less is known about the dates of composition for the " Butts set " - between 1811 and 1820 , Blake created at least thirty three designs for Thomas Butts , which included the illustrations of " On the Morning of Christ 's Nativity " . Later , they passed from Butts to his son , who sold them at Sotheby 's in 1852 , passed through several more hands , were sold at Christie 's in 1912 , and in 1916 were sold to Henry Huntington . 
 = = Dating and sequence = = 
 The illustrations themselves do not make the dating any <unk> the edges of the " Thomas set " were trimmed before sale at Sotheby 's , leaving " 18 " or " 180 " on most of the sheets . Only The Night of Peace bears the full date of 1809 . The Butts set is entirely <unk> dates from 1803 to 1817 have been proposed for it . Behrendt argues that the Butts set predates the Thomas set by six years , and Collins Baker and R.R. Wark place it in 1809 , but earlier than the Thomas set . 
 The sequence of the illustrations is also a topic of scholarly dispute : the mountings of the Thomas set were inscribed on their backs with numbers 1 @-@ 6 , but these were added during or after the 1872 Sotheby 's sale , and so are unlikely to follow Blake 's intended order . This " original " order ran thus : 
 The Descent of Peace 
 The Annunciation to the Shepherds 
 The Flight of Moloch 
 The Old Dragon 
 The Overthrow of Apollo and the Pagan Gods 
 The Night of Peace 
 Geoffrey Keynes placed them in 1 @-@ 6 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 @-@ 4 @-@ 5 order , so that The Night of Peace followed The Descent of Peace , because of their similar subjects . Butlin , and nearly all subsequent scholars , have rejected this , as much commentary has centered upon Blake 's use of similar images to frame the sequence . Butlin instead rearranges the " original " sequence as 1 @-@ 2 @-@ 4 @-@ 5 @-@ 3 @-@ 6 , moving The Flight of Moloch to second to last , so that it matches the order of corresponding verses in Milton 's poem . Dunbar also follows Butlin 's order . Behrendt adopts a 1 @-@ 2 @-@ 5 @-@ 3 @-@ 4 @-@ 6 order , seeing a thematic progression from the destruction of classical aesthetics , to the old testament cruelty of Moloch ( who resembles Blake 's Urizen ) , to Satan himself . This order is followed by Werner in her Blake 's Vision of the Poetry of Milton .
