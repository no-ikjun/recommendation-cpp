 The world premiere of At World 's End was held on May 19 , 2007 at Disneyland , home of the ride that inspired the film and where the first two films in the trilogy debuted . Disneyland offered the general public a chance to attend the premiere through the sale of tickets , priced at $ 1 @,@ 500 per ticket , with proceeds going to the Make @-@ a @-@ Wish Foundation charity . Just a few weeks before the film 's release , Walt Disney Pictures decided to move the United States opening of At World 's End from screenings Friday , May 25 , 2007 to Thursday at 8 PM , May 24 , 2007 . The film opened in 4 @,@ 362 theaters domestically , beating Spider @-@ Man 3 's theater opening record by 110 ( this record was surpassed by The Dark Knight the following year ) .

 After a muted publicity campaign , the trailer finally debuted at ShoWest 2007 . It was shown on March 18 , 2007 at a special screening of Pirates of the Caribbean : The Curse of the Black Pearl named " Pirates Ultimate Fan Event " , and was then shown on March 19 during Dancing with the Stars , before it debuted online . Action figures by NECA were released in late April . Board games such as a Collector ’ s Edition Chess Set , a Monopoly Game , and a Pirates Dice Game ( Liar 's dice ) were also released . Master Replicas made sculptures of characters and replicas of jewellery and the Dead Man 's Chest . A video game with the same title as the film was released on May 22 , 2007 on Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 , Wii , PSP , PlayStation 2 , PC , and Nintendo DS formats . The soundtrack and its remix were also released on May 22 .

 = = = Critical response = = = 
 As with Dead Man 's Chest , At World 's End received mixed reviews . The most common criticism of the film from reviewers was that the plot was too convoluted for them to follow . At World 's End has a " Rotten " rating of 45 % on review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes , with the site 's consensus saying that the film " provides the thrilling action scenes , but mixes in too many characters with too many incomprehensible plot threads . " It also has a score of 50 at Metacritic . Favorable reviewer Alex Billington noted , " This is just how the film industry works nowadays ; critics give bad opinions , the public usually has a differing opinion , and all is well in the world of Hollywood since the studios made their millions anyway . " 
 Drew McWeeny praised the film 's complexity as giving it repeat @-@ viewing value , and its conclusion as " perhaps the most canny move it makes . " Todd Gilchrist found the story too similar to other cinematic trilogies such as Star Wars , but praised the production values . Brian Lowry felt that " unlike last year 's bloated sequel , it at least possesses some semblance of a destination , making it slightly more coherent - if no less numbing during the protracted finale . " Total Film praised the performances but complained that the twists and exposition made it hard to care for the characters . Edward Douglas liked the film but had issues with its pacing , while Blake Wright criticized the Davy Jones 's Locker and Calypso segments . James Berardinelli found it the weakest of the trilogy as " the last hour offers adventure as rousing as anything provided in either of the previous installments ... which doesn 't account for the other 108 minutes of this gorged , self @-@ indulgent , and uneven production . " Peter Travers praised Richards and Rush but felt " there can indeed be too much of a good thing , " regarding Depp 's character . Travers later declared the movie to be one of the worst films of the year . Colm Andrew of the Manx Independent said the film was overall a disappointment and that " the final showdown ... is a non @-@ event and the repetitive swordplay and inane plot contrivances simply become boring by the end " . Richard Roeper gave a positive review , saying " Gore Verbinski and the stunt and special effects crews have created one of the most impressive blends of live @-@ action work and CGI wizardry ever put on film , " and believing it " rarely drags and is almost always entertaining . " He praised the performances of the actors as one of the best things about the film . 
 Chow Yun @-@ fat 's character stirred a great deal of controversy with the Chinese press . Perry Lam , of Hong Kong cultural magazine , Muse , found an offensive resemblance between Chow 's character and Fu Manchu : " Now Fu Manchu has returned after an absence of 27 years in the Hollywood cinema ; except that , in a nod to political correctness and marketing realities , he is no longer called Fu Manchu .

 = Flushing – Main Street ( IRT Flushing Line ) = 
 Flushing – Main Street ( signed as Main Street on entrances and pillars , and Main St – Flushing on overhead signs ) is the northern terminal station on the IRT Flushing Line of the New York City Subway , located at Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue in the Downtown section of Flushing , Queens . It is served by the 7 at all times and the < 7 > train rush hours in the peak direction . 
 The Flushing – Main Street station was originally built as part of the Dual Contracts between the Interborough Rapid Transit Company ( IRT ) and the Brooklyn – Manhattan Transit Corporation ( BMT ) . It opened on January 21 , 1928 , completing the segment of the Flushing Line in Queens . Although plans existed for the line to be extended east of the station , such an extension was never built . The station was renovated in the 1990s . 
 The passenger count in 2015 for the station was 19 @,@ 082 @,@ 391 , making it the 12th busiest station system @-@ wide , the busiest station in Queens , and the busiest station outside of Manhattan . 
 = = History = = 
 The station was constructed under the Dual Contracts as part of an extension of the Flushing Line past 103rd Street – Corona Plaza . At the time of the line 's planning in the 1910s , Downtown Flushing was a quiet Dutch @-@ colonial @-@ style village ; what is now Roosevelt Avenue in the area was known as Amity Street , a major commercial thoroughfare in the neighborhood . It was decided to build the station underground due to local opposition to the disturbances , loss of property value , and the required widening of Amity Street that an elevated line would bring . Thus , it is one of only seven underground stations on the Flushing Line , one of three underground stations on the line in Queens , and the only underground station east of Queensboro Plaza . Construction of the station and the double @-@ deck bridge over the Flushing Creek began on April 21 , 1923 , with the station built via cut @-@ and @-@ cover methods . The bridge was completed in 1927 , and the station opened on January 21 , 1928 , over a decade after the line began operation . 
 Following the station 's opening , Downtown Flushing evolved into a major commercial and transit center , as development sprung around the section of Main Street near the station . On April 24 , 1939 , express trains began operating to and from the station , in conjunction with the reconstruction of the Willets Point station for the 1939 World 's Fair . Due to the high level of passenger use , beginning in 1940 local residents requested an additional exit at the east end of the station , and the widening of existing staircases . A new eastern entrance was added after World War II . 
 Between 1999 and 2000 , the station underwent a major renovation project that had been in the planning stages since the 1970s . The renovation added an elevator near the Lippmann Plaza exit that made the station compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 . The project also added new entrances and a large entrance hall near Lippmann Plaza at the far east end of the station , beyond the bumper blocks at the end of the tracks . Prior to 1999 , the tracks went past where the current bumper blocks are , to a dead @-@ end , as the line was planned to extend eastward . 
 The Flushing – Main Street station has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2004 . 
 = = = Proposed extension of the line = = = 
 Under several expansion plans of the New York City Subway , including the Dual Contracts and the IND Second System , the Flushing Line would have been extended past Main Street , along and / or parallel to the right @-@ of @-@ way of the nearby Port Washington Branch of the Long Island Rail Road towards Bell Boulevard in Bayside . A spur line would have branched off north along 149th Street towards College Point . 
 = = Station layout = = 
 The station has three tracks and two relatively narrow island platforms , due to Roosevelt Avenue 's narrow width of approximately 50 feet ( 15 m ) . When peak @-@ direction express service operates , express trains will leave from the middle and southernmost tracks , Track M and Track 2 respectively , while local trains will leave from Track 1 . This system was instituted in November 1952 . Mosaic on the wall tiles read " <unk> <unk> " ; small tiles along the platforms read " M " . 
 There are nine entrances at street level , leading to two separate fare control areas . The original street exit is in the middle of the platforms with a separate fare control mezzanine above the tracks , and the 24 @-@ hour station agent 's booth . Staircases lead up to all four corners of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue . The new fare control area at Lippmann Plaza has an extremely high ceiling , approximately 40 feet ( 12 m ) below the street level . The mezzanine is at platform level , and provides an ADA @-@ compliant elevator , three unidirectional escalators , and a stairway to street level at Lippmann Plaza . New artwork titled Happy World was installed over the row of turnstiles in 1998 . The plaza , also known as Lippmann Arcade , is a pedestrian walkway that leads to a municipal parking lot and several bus stops on 39th Avenue . 
 At the west end of the station platforms are the offices and dispatch tower for the IRT Flushing Line . Train crews report to the offices , while the dispatch tower dispatches trains and controls the Flushing Line . West of the station , the line rises from the tunnel via a portal at College Point Boulevard , and onto the elevated bridge across Flushing Creek . 
 = = Bus service = = 
 In addition to connecting with the nearby Long Island Rail Road station of the same name , the station serves as one of the two busiest local bus @-@ subway interchanges in Queens ( along with Jamaica Center ) and the largest in North America , with over 20 bus routes running through or terminating in the area as of 2015 .

 = Halo : Cryptum = 
 Halo : Cryptum is a military science fiction novel by Greg Bear , based on the Halo series of video games . The book was released in January 2011 and is the eighth Halo book ( the seventh novel ) and the first in the trilogy of novels focusing on the Forerunners , called The Forerunner Saga . Cryptum was released in hardcover , e @-@ book , and audiobook following 2009 's Halo : Evolutions , a collection of Halo short stories . It is succeeded by Primordium , published in January 2012 , and Silentium , in March 2013 . Bear was given little restriction on the story of the novel ; the Halo universe had not yet been explored in that time period . 
 Set approximately 100 @,@ 000 years before the events of Halo : Combat Evolved , the novel tells the story of a young Forerunner 's adventure on prehistoric Earth and across the galaxy . The protagonist , named Bornstellar , awakens an exiled warrior , the Didact , who recruits Bornstellar and his companions , reveals the history of Forerunner @-@ human war and the existence of Halo superweapons , giant rings with the potential to kill every conscious being in the galaxy . The group is captured by the Master Builder , the most powerful individual Forerunner and creator of the Halos , but he is arrested and Bornstellar is called to provide evidence at the Master Builder 's trial . Before the trial begins however , a rogue artificial intelligence attempts to use the Halos to commit genocide against the Forerunners , and Bornstellar escapes to the Ark . 
 Cryptum received mixed reviews ; some critics liked the Forerunner culture and suspense that Bear created , but others disliked the characters , found the plot too slow and concluded that the novel was suited only to existing fans of the Halo series . Cryptum appeared on multiple bestseller lists after promotion on Halo Waypoint , a website that serves as a hub for Halo @-@ related information . 
 = = Background = = 
 Greg Bear was 343 Industries ' first choice to write a trilogy of books based on the history of the Forerunners and another mysterious race known as the Precursors . Bear had been writing a book entitled Hull Zero Three when he was approached to be the trilogy 's author . At the first meeting with Bear regarding the book , he was told that it should be a " classic Greg Bear giant – in the vein of Eon , Anvil of the Stars and so on " , but inspired by Halo and its extended universe . The book and author were announced on April 6 , 2009 . 343 Industries ' General Manager , Bonnie Ross , stated that the back and forth with Bear made " the whole experience better " , and was preferable to assigning the author his task with no feedback . Halo franchise development director Frank O 'Connor stated , " The enigma of the Forerunners is really at the heart of the drama and mystery of the Halo universe ... in all the games and the books so far we 've only scratched the surface of the terrible events that engulfed the Forerunners and the Galaxy they protected 100 @,@ 000 years ago " . Although nothing was forced upon Bear in terms of story templates , he had numerous and comprehensive discussions about the history of the Halo universe and the major events of the Forerunner history had already been established through the information hidden in Halo 3 . O 'Connor said that the book is meant to have a " hard sci @-@ fi " feel with a " hint of space opera , in the mold of Banks , Reynolds and Bear himself . " 
 The book 's cover was designed by <unk> , an artist at 343 Industries known for his " futuristic vistas " . The artwork was taken directly from art made for Halo 4 . O 'Connor explained that the cover was intended to " capture the essence and scope of the book and more importantly , the Forerunner universe . " The art is supposed to convey " the sense of wonder that all our main protagonists feel at the scale and scope of Forerunner technology . " 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 = = = Setting = = = 
 Cryptum takes place approximately 100 @,@ 000 years before the present day in the Halo universe , telling the story of the Forerunners before their disappearance . It revolves around the journey of a young Forerunner , Bornstellar , and two humans , Chakas and Morning Riser , and how their lives change when they meet a Forerunner warrior , the Didact . The Forerunners are a type @-@ three civilization on the Kardashev scale ; they can build artificial planets and control stars . Forerunners are divided into classes by occupation , they are ( in order of rank ) : Builders , the architects of the Forerunners ' megastructures , Miners , Lifeworkers , experts in medicine and biology , and Warriors . Bornstellar 's family are politically important Builders and particularly wealthy , enabling them to own an entire planet . Warriors introduced in this book called Prometheans were later featured as antagonists in the video game Halo 4 . 
 In the Halo universe , humans had advanced to a comparable level of technology to the Forerunners but , after losing a war with them , all human technology was destroyed and their intelligence reduced , leaving them in a subsistence economy with measures to prevent redevelopment of electronics . Humans are aware of the other , space @-@ faring races , but their interactions are limited to visits from Forerunners as they do not have the technology to make contact themselves , they live in wooden buildings and have only primitive steam engines . The San 'Shyuum ( or Prophets as they are referred to in the Halo games ) were also defeated by the Forerunners but their technology was not destroyed ; they were instead confined to their home solar system and forbidden to manufacture weapons . 
 Much of the story takes place on Erde @-@ <unk> , the Forerunner name for Earth , although characters also visit the San 'Shyuum homeworld , Bornstellar 's family 's planet and the Forerunner political centre , a planet @-@ sized space station . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 The protagonist of Cryptum is a young Forerunner named " Bornstellar Makes Eternal Lasting " although he is more commonly referred to as just " Bornstellar " . He is from a long line of Builders , but he is disgruntled with the Forerunners ' status quo . Bornstellar 's curiosity leads him to prehistoric Earth where he meets the humans . Chakas is a human youngster of a species known as <unk> , one of many varieties of the genus Homo . Morning Riser ( full name : Day @-@ Chaser Makes Paths Long @-@ stretch Morning Riser ) is a Florian ( Homo <unk> ) about half the height of Chakas but of similar intelligence . 
 Bornstellar and the humans awaken the Didact , a Warrior class who was one of the commanders of Forerunner military in the Forerunner @-@ human war . He was exiled to stasis after coming into conflict with the Master Builder , the leader of the Forerunners . The Master Builder is responsible for the creation of the titular Halo superweapons . The Didact is married to the Librarian , one of the most powerful and influential Lifeworkers to have lived . She is a <unk> , the highest rank a <unk> can achieve , and is responsible for indexing every species in the galaxy in the Ark . 
 = = = Plot summary = = = 
 The story starts as Bornstellar makes his way to " Erde @-@ <unk> " where he meets the two humans Chakas and Morning Riser , who serve as his guides . Bornstellar is seeking Precursor artifacts , relics from an extinct but technologically superior civilization . The humans lead Bornstellar to a ring island where they find and activate the <unk> of the Didact . The <unk> preserves the Didact in an indefinite sleep . Bornstellar begins to suspect that the artificial intelligence in his suit of armour has conspired to bring him to the island , and that the humans held subconscious knowledge allowing them to aid in waking the Didact . After the Didact recovers from his slumber , he conscripts Bornstellar , Chakas , and Riser , taking them on a quest given by the Librarian who has provided them a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art space ship , hidden for thousands of years beneath the island . Aboard the ship Bornstellar learns about the Forerunner war with humankind 10 @,@ 000 years prior . Forerunners went to war with humans and San ' Shyuum when their expansion began encroaching on Forerunner worlds . After their defeat the Librarian saved the human race from extinction and planted a genetic command known as a " <unk> " in them , the cause of Chakas and Riser 's subconscious knowledge . It is later revealed that the humans and San ' Shyuum were united against the Flood , a parasitic alien species that controls its host , and attacked only the Forerunner planets with Flood infestation . 
 The Didact and his makeshift crew travel to an ancient Precursor planet , <unk> <unk> , where humans had once also settled . The Didact is disturbed to find that many of the Precursor structures on the planet have fallen into ruin ; Precursor structures were thought to be completely indestructible . The Didact also discovers that a prisoner , ensconced in both Precursor and human containment methods , has escaped . They travel to the nearby planet of Faun <unk> , another formerly human @-@ settled world , to find it stripped of all sentient life , its ecosystem in peril . The Didact sponsors Bornstellar 's first mutation , a vital part of Forerunner growth , imprinting himself upon Bornstellar . The Didact 's memories , tactics and experiences are shared with Bornstellar , giving him insight into the context of the Forerunner @-@ human war and the planets the crew had just visited . 
 When attempting to visit the San ' Shyuum home world , the four are captured by Builders , commanded by the Master Builder . The Didact and humans are held prisoner , but Bornstellar is returned to the care of his father because of his family 's status and power . On his family 's home world , he uses the time and peace to reflect on recent events , and allow the imprint of the Didact to fully assimilate into his thoughts . He overhears an argument between his father and another Builder , from which he learns that his father was one of the chief builders of the Halos . The Didact opposed the Builders ' decision to construct such a weapon , hence his exile . It is soon revealed that the Master Builder is being brought up on charges and that the Halo weapons had been recalled , but one of the rings had gone missing . Bornstellar is called to a Forerunner core planet to testify against the Master Builder , who has been put on trial for crimes against The Mantle , a Forerunner philosophy that values the preservation of life over all else . Just as the trial is about to begin , an AI , Mendicant Bias , betrays the Forerunners and intends to use the combined power of the Halos to begin wiping out the Forerunner race . 
 In the ensuing battle to save the planet , several Halos are able to escape , their own AIs enacting failsafe protocols . Bornstellar manages to escape with the help of a young council member and a guard . They escape through the same portal as the Halos but lose power and drift for an unknown amount of time before being recovered by Lifeworkers . The portal has carried them to the Ark , the massive structure that serves as a construction site for Halos and also a haven for the Librarian 's work . The trio are healed , and Bornstellar meets the Librarian , which brings up conflicting thoughts and feelings , due to his imprint from the Didact . She informs him that the Master Builder executed the Didact soon after Bornstellar was sent back to his family . With the news that the Didact is gone , Bornstellar resolves to take his place . The book ends with a narration from the Didact / Bornstellar , revealing that the escaped prisoner was the last Precursor , known as Timeless One . Through a conversation the Didact had long ago , it is learned that the Precursors created the Forerunners , only for the Forerunners to rise up and eradicate the Precursors , except this one , who now seeks revenge . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 In the weeks before release , Tor Books released Chapter One for free , and Chapter Two was made available on the Halo Waypoint website . Tor also ran seven giveaways of the other Halo novels and action figures . An unabridged audio book , narrated by Holter Graham , was released alongside the print edition on January 4 , 2011 . Upon release Greg Bear did book signings attended by Frank O 'Connor . Following its release , Cryptum reached number 22 in the New York Times Best Seller List in the Hardcover Fiction category . It also spent five weeks on the Los Angeles Times Hardcover Fiction Bestseller list , reaching number 17 . Publishers Weekly noted that the book was a bestseller in the hardcovers category in early September 2011 at Borders . 
 Cryptum was met with varying reviews . Dr. Nigel Seel of <unk> called it tired , unoriginal and boring , saying , " It 's hard to care about the flimsy characters , the plot is wearily over familiar , the hero is passive throughout and overall , not enough happens . " He criticised the characters as stereotypical and the plot being far too slow , concluding , " This is one for the die @-@ hard Halo fans . " Hilary Williamson of Book Loons also considered Cryptum appealing only to Halo fans , but praised Graham 's narration . The author of Artistic Gaming 's review of Cryptum found it difficult to like the book 's characters due to the condescending tone of Bornstellar , also concluding that it is only suited to diehard fans . Portland Book Review 's Missy <unk> felt differently . She thought the characters complex and found it comparable to an interesting history lesson . Her review further contrasted Dr. Seel 's by recommending it to all science fiction readers , not just Halo fans . Jason Hamilton of Story Hobby also praised the novel ; he complimented Bear 's creation of a completely different culture to humanity and his balance of providing the reader with enough information to maintain interest without letting on too much and ruining the suspense . 
 = Catalytic triad = 
 A catalytic triad refers to the three amino acid residues that function together at the centre of the active site of some <unk> and transferase enzymes ( e.g. proteases , amidases , esterases , <unk> , lipases and β @-@ lactamases ) . An Acid @-@ Base @-@ Nucleophile triad is a common motif for generating a nucleophilic residue for covalent catalysis . The residues form a charge @-@ relay network to polarise and activate the nucleophile , which attacks the substrate , forming a covalent intermediate which is then hydrolysed to regenerate free enzyme . The nucleophile is most commonly a serine or cysteine amino acid , but occasionally threonine . Because enzymes fold into complex three @-@ dimensional structures , the residues of a catalytic triad can be far from each other along the amino @-@ acid sequence ( primary structure ) , however , they are brought close together in the final fold . 
 As well as divergent evolution of function ( and even the triad 's nucleophile ) , catalytic triads show some of the best examples of convergent evolution . Chemical constraints on catalysis have led to the same catalytic solution independently evolving in at least 23 separate superfamilies . Their mechanism of action is consequently one of the best studied in biochemistry . 
 = = History = = 
 The enzymes trypsin and chymotrypsin were first purified in the 1930s . A serine in each of trypsin and chymotrypsin was identified as the catalytic nucleophile ( by diisopropyl <unk> modification ) in the 1950s . The structure of chymotrypsin was solved by X @-@ ray crystallography in the 1960s , showing the orientation of the catalytic triad in the active site . Other proteases were sequenced and aligned to reveal a family of related proteases , now called the S1 family . Simultaneously , the structures of the evolutionarily unrelated papain and subtilisin proteases were found to contain analogous triads . The ' charge @-@ relay ' mechanism for the activation of the nucleophile by the other triad members was proposed in the late 1960s . As more protease structures were solved by X @-@ ray crystallography in the 1970s and 80s , homologous ( such as TEV protease ) and analogous ( such as papain ) triads were found . The <unk> classification system in the 1990s and 2000s began classing proteases into structurally related enzyme superfamilies and so acts as a database of the convergent evolution of triads in over 20 superfamilies . Understanding how chemical constraints on evolution led to the convergence of so many enzyme families on the same triad geometries has developed in the 2010s . Of particular contention during the 1990s and early 2000s was the contribution of low @-@ barrier hydrogen bonding to catalysis ; however , current thinking is that ordinary hydrogen bonding is sufficient to explain the mechanism . The massive body of work on the charge @-@ relay , covalent catalysis used by catalytic triads has led to the mechanism being the best characterised in all of biochemistry .

 Enzymes that contain an catalytic triad use it for one of two reaction types : either to split a substrate ( hydrolases ) or to transfer one portion of a substrate over to a second substrate ( transferases ) . Triads are an inter @-@ dependent set of residues in the active site of an enzyme and act in concert with other residues ( e.g. binding site and oxyanion hole ) to achieve nucleophilic catalysis . These triad residues act together to make the nucleophile member highly reactive , generating a covalent intermediate with the substrate that is then resolved to complete catalysis . 
 = = = Mechanism = = = 
 Catalytic triads perform covalent catalysis using a residue as a nucleophile . The reactivity of the nucleophilic residue is increased by the functional groups of the other triad members . The nucleophile is polarised and oriented by the base , which is itself bound and stabilised by the acid . 
 Catalysis is performed in two stages . First , the activated nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon and forces the carbonyl oxygen to accept an electron , leading to a tetrahedral intermediate . The build @-@ up of negative charge on this intermediate is typically stabilized by an <unk> hole within the active site . The intermediate then collapses back to a carbonyl , ejecting the first half of the substrate , but leaving the second half still covalently bound to the enzyme as an acyl @-@ enzyme intermediate . The ejection of this first leaving group is often aided by donation of a proton by the base . 
 The second stage of catalysis is the resolution of the acyl @-@ enzyme intermediate by the attack of a second substrate . If this substrate is water then the result is hydrolysis ; if it is an organic molecule then the result is transfer of that molecule onto the first substrate . Attack by this second substrate forms a new tetrahedral intermediate , which resolves by ejecting the enzyme 's nucleophile , releasing the second product and regenerating free enzyme . 
 = = Identity of triad members = = 
 = = = Nucleophile = = = 
 The side @-@ chain of the nucleophilic residue performs covalent catalysis on the substrate . The lone pair of electrons present on the oxygen or sulphur attacks the electropositive carbonyl carbon . The 20 naturally occurring biological amino acids do not contain any sufficiently nucleophilic functional groups for many difficult catalytic reactions . Embedding the nucleophile in a triad increases its reactivity for efficient catalysis . The most commonly used nucleophiles are the hydroxyl ( OH ) of serine and the thiol / <unk> ion ( SH / S − ) of cysteine . Alternatively , threonine proteases use the secondary hydroxyl of threonine , however due to steric hindrance of the side chain 's extra methyl group such proteases use their N @-@ terminal amide as the base , rather than a separate amino acid . 
 Use of oxygen or sulphur as the nucleophilic atom causes minor differences in catalysis . Compared to oxygen , sulphur ’ s extra d orbital makes it larger ( by 0 @.@ 4 Å ) and softer , allows it to form longer bonds ( dC @-@ X and <unk> @-@ H by 1 @.@ 3 @-@ fold ) , and gives it a lower pKa ( by 5 units ) . Serine is therefore more dependent than cysteine on optimal orientation of the acid @-@ base triad members to reduce its pKa in order to achieve concerted deprotonation with catalysis . The low pKa of cysteine works to its disadvantage in the resolution of the first tetrahedral intermediate as unproductive reversal of the original nucleophilic attack is the more favourable breakdown product . The triad base is therefore preferentially oriented to <unk> the leaving group amide to ensure that it is ejected to leave the enzyme sulphur covalently bound to the substrate N @-@ terminus . Finally , resolution of the acyl @-@ enzyme ( to release the substrate C @-@ terminus ) requires serine to be re @-@ protonated whereas cysteine can leave as S − . <unk> , the sulphur of cysteine also forms longer bonds and has a bulkier Van der Waals radius and if mutated to serine can be trapped in unproductive orientations in the active site . 
 = = = Base = = = 
 Since no natural amino acids are strongly nucleophilic , the base in a catalytic triad polarises and <unk> the nucleophile to increase its reactivity . Additionally , it <unk> the first product to aid leaving group departure . 
 The base is most commonly histidine since its pKa allows for effective base catalysis , hydrogen bonding to the acid residue , and deprotonation of the nucleophile <unk> β @-@ lactamases such as TEM @-@ 1 use a lysine residue as the base . Because lysine 's pKa is so high ( pKa = 11 ) , a glutamate and several other residues act as the acid to stabilise its deprotonated state during the catalytic cycle . Threonine proteases use their N @-@ terminal amide as the base , since steric crowding by the catalytic threonine 's methyl prevents other residues from being close enough . 
 = = = Acid = = = 
 The acidic triad member forms a hydrogen bond with the basic residue . This aligns the basic residue by restricting its side @-@ chain rotation , and polarises it by stabilising its positive charge . Two amino acids have acidic side chains at physiological pH ( aspartate or glutamate ) and so are the most commonly used for this triad member . <unk> protease uses a pair of <unk> , one as the base , as usual , and one as the acid . The second histidine is not as effective an acid as the more common aspartate or glutamate , leading to a lower catalytic efficiency . In some enzymes , the acid member of the triad is less necessary and some act only as a dyad . For example , papain uses asparagine as its third triad member which orients the histidine base but does not act as an acid . Similarly , hepatitis A virus protease contains an ordered water in the position where an acid residue should be . 
 = = Examples of triads = = 
 = = = Ser @-@ His @-@ Asp = = = 
 The Serine @-@ Histidine @-@ Aspartate motif is one of the most thoroughly characterised catalytic motifs in biochemistry . The triad is exemplified by chymotrypsin , a model serine protease from the PA superfamily which uses its triad to hydrolyse protein backbones . The aspartate is hydrogen bonded to the histidine , increasing the pKa of its imidazole nitrogen from 7 to around 12 . This allows the histidine to act as a powerful general base and to activate the serine nucleophile . It also has an <unk> hole consisting of several backbone amides which stabilises charge build @-@ up on intermediates . The histidine base aids the first leaving group by donating a proton , and also activates the hydrolytic water substrate by abstracting a proton as the remaining OH − attacks the acyl @-@ enzyme intermediate . 
 The same triad has also convergently evolved in α / β hydrolases such as some lipases and esterases , however orientation of the triad members is reversed . Additionally , brain acetyl <unk> ( which has the same fold as a small G @-@ protein ) has also been found to have this triad . The equivalent Serine @-@ Histidine @-@ <unk> triad is used in acetylcholinesterase . 
 = = = Cys @-@ His @-@ Asp = = = 
 The second most studied triad is the Cysteine @-@ Histidine @-@ Aspartate motif . Several families of cysteine proteases use this triad set , for example TEV protease and papain . The triad acts similarly to serine protease triads , with a few notable differences . Due to cysteine 's low pKa , the importance of the Asp to catalysis varies and several cysteine proteases are effectively Cys @-@ His dyads ( e.g. hepatitis A virus protease ) , whilst in others the cysteine is already deprotonated before catalysis begins ( e.g. papain ) . This triad is also used by some amidases , such as N @-@ <unk> to hydrolyse non @-@ peptide C @-@ N bonds . 
 = = = Ser @-@ His @-@ His = = = 
 The triad of cytomegalovirus protease uses histidine as both the acid and base triad members . Removing the acid histidine results in only a 10 @-@ fold activity loss ( compared to > 10 @,@ 000 @-@ fold when aspartate is removed from chymotrypsin ) . This triad has been interpreted as a possible way of generating a less active enzyme to control cleavage rate . 
 = = = Ser @-@ Glu @-@ Asp = = = 
 An unusual triad is found in <unk> proteases . The low pKa of the glutamate carboxylate group means that it only acts as a base in the triad at very low pH . The triad is hypothesised to be an adaptation to specific environments like acidic hot springs ( e.g. <unk> ) or cell lysosome ( e.g. <unk> peptidase ) . 
 = = = Thr @-@ Nter , Ser @-@ Nter and Cys @-@ Nter = = = 
 Threonine proteases , such as the proteasome protease subunit and ornithine <unk> use the secondary hydroxyl of threonine in an manner analogous to the use of the serine primary hydroxyl . However , due to the steric interference of the extra methyl group of threonine , the base member of the triad is the N @-@ terminal amide which polarises an ordered water which , in turn , <unk> the catalytic hydroxyl to increase its reactivity . Similarly , there exist equivalent ' serine only ' and ' cysteine only ' configurations such as penicillin <unk> G and penicillin <unk> V which are evolutionarily related to the proteasome proteases . Again , these use their N @-@ terminal amide as a base . 
 = = = Ser @-@ <unk> @-@ Lys = = = 
 This unusual triad occurs only in one superfamily of amidases . In this case , the lysine acts to polarise the middle serine . The middle serine then forms two strong hydrogen bonds to the nucleophilic serine to activate it ( one with the side chain hydroxyl and the other with the backbone amide ) . The middle serine is held in an unusual cis orientation to facilitate precise contacts with the other two triad residues . The triad is further unusual in that the lysine and cis @-@ serine both act as the base in activating the catalytic serine , but the same lysine also performs the role of the acid member as well as making key structural contacts . 
 = = Divergent evolution = = 
 The sophistication of the active site network causes residues involved in catalysis ( and residues in contact with these ) to be highly evolutionarily conserved . However , there are examples of divergent evolution in catalytic triads , both in the reaction catalysed , and the residues used in catalysis . The triad remains the core of the active site , but it is evolutionarily adapted to serve different functions . 
 = = = Reaction changes = = = 
 Catalytic triads perform covalent catalysis via an acyl @-@ enzyme intermediate . If this intermediate is resolved by water , the result is hydrolysis of the substrate . However , if the intermediate is resolved by attack by a second substrate , then the enzyme acts as a transferase . For example , attack by an acyl group results in an acyltransferase reaction . Several families of transferase enzymes have evolved from hydrolases by adaptation to exclude water and favour attack of a second substrate . 
 Additionally , an alternative transferase mechanism has been evolved by <unk> , which has two active sites . In the first active site , a cysteine triad hydrolyses a glutamine substrate to release free ammonia . The ammonia then diffuses though an internal tunnel in the enzyme to the second active site , where it is transferred to a second substrate . 
 = = = Nucleophile changes = = = 
 Divergent evolution of active site residues is slow , due to strong chemical constraints . Nevertheless , some protease superfamilies have evolved from one nucleophile to another . This can be inferred when a superfamily ( with the same fold ) contains families that use different nucleophiles . Such nucleophile switches have occurred several times during evolutionary history , however the mechanisms by which this happen are still unclear . 
 Within protease superfamilies that contain a mixture of nucleophiles ( e.g. the PA clan ) , families are designated by their catalytic nucleophile ( C = cysteine proteases , S = serine proteases ) . 
 = = Convergent evolution = = 
 The enzymology of proteases provides some of the clearest known examples of convergent evolution . The same geometric arrangement of triad residues occurs in over 20 separate enzyme superfamilies . Each of these superfamilies is the result of convergent evolution for the same triad arrangement within a different structural fold . This is because there are limited productive ways to arrange three triad residues , the enzyme backbone and the substrate . These examples reflect the intrinsic chemical and physical constraints on enzymes , leading evolution to repeatedly and independently converge on equivalent solutions . 
 = = = Cysteine and serine hydrolases = = = 
 The same triad geometries been converged upon by serine proteases such as the chymotrypsin and subtilisin superfamilies . Similar convergent evolution has occurred with cysteine proteases such as viral C3 protease and papain superfamilies . These triads have converged to almost the same arrangement due to the mechanistic similarities in cysteine and serine proteolysis mechanisms . 
 Families of Cysteine proteases 
 Families of Serine proteases 
 = = = Threonine proteases = = = 
 Threonine proteases use the amino acid threonine as their catalytic nucleophile . Unlike cysteine and serine , threonine is a secondary hydroxyl ( i.e. has a methyl group ) . This methyl group greatly restricts the possible orientations of triad and substrate as the methyl clashes with either the enzyme backbone or histidine base . Consequently , the catalytic residue of a threonine protease is located at it N @-@ terminus . 
 Two evolutionarily independent enzyme superfamilies with different protein folds are known to use the N @-@ terminal residue as a nucleophile : Superfamily PB ( proteasomes using the <unk> fold ) and Superfamily PE ( <unk> using the DOM fold ) This commonality of active site structure in completely different protein folds indicates that the active site evolved convergently in those superfamilies .

 = Maryland Route 231 = 
 Maryland Route 231 ( MD 231 ) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland . The state highway runs 16 @.@ 39 miles ( 26 @.@ 38 km ) from Olivers Shop Road near Hughesville east to MD 765 in Prince Frederick . MD 231 crosses the Patuxent River on the Benedict Bridge , which connects Benedict in eastern Charles County with Hallowing Point in central Calvert County . The highway directly connects MD 5 in Hughesville with MD 2 and MD 4 in Prince Frederick . MD 231 was constructed from Hughesville to Benedict and from <unk> Point to Prince Frederick in the early 1920s . The portion of the state highway west of Hughesville was built in the early 1930s , about the same time ferry service began between Benedict and Hallowing Point . The Benedict Bridge was started in 1950 and was completed in 1952 ; the bridge remained the southernmost crossing of the Patuxent River for 25 years . The bridge was tolled from its opening until around 1955 . MD 231 was reconstructed between Hughesville and Prince Frederick in the mid- to late 1950s to better serve <unk> traffic . 
 = = Route description = = 
 MD 231 begins at an intersection with Olivers Shop Road in the hamlet of Burnt Store in eastern Charles County . Olivers Shop Road connects <unk> to the south with Bryantown to the north . MD 231 heads east as two @-@ lane Burnt Store Road , crossing Gilbert Creek on its way to Hughesville . Within Hughesville , the state highway intersects MD 5 Business ( Old Leonardtown Road ) , where the highway 's name changes to Prince Frederick Road . East of the village center , MD 231 meets MD 5 ( Leonardtown Road ) at a dumbbell interchange . In the hamlet of Patuxent , the state highway intersects MD 381 ( Brandywine Road ) , which heads north into the southeastern corner of Prince George 's County . 
 From Patuxent , MD 231 heads southeast through the neck of far eastern Charles County that reaches to the Patuxent River between Prince George 's County and St. Mary 's County . Before reaching the river , the state highway passes to the north of the village of Benedict , which was the site of the landing of British troops to march toward Washington prior to the Battle of Bladensburg during the War of 1812 . The state highway crosses the Patuxent River on the Benedict Bridge , a 3 @,@ 343 @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 019 m ) long steel beam bridge whose roadway is 24 feet ( 7 @.@ 3 m ) wide . At the Patuxent River 's navigation channel , the bridge features a through steel girder swing span that has 17 feet ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) vertical clearance when closed and provides two openings with 50 feet ( 15 m ) horizontal clearance when opened . 
 MD 231 enters Calvert County at Hallowing Point and continues east as Hallowing Point Road , passing an industrial park and Hallowing Point Park . After intersecting MD 508 ( Adelina Road ) , the state highway veers northeast through the village of Barstow , where the highway intersects Barstow Road , which serves the historic homes Cedar Hill and Willow Glenn . MD 231 passes the Prince Frederick campus of the College of Southern Maryland before entering Prince Frederick . The state highway meets MD 2 and MD 4 , which run concurrently as Solomons Island Road , on the west side of the county seat . MD 231 continues northeast as Church Street , passing the historic home Linden , home of the Calvert County Historical Society . The state highway reaches its eastern terminus at MD 765 ( Main Street ) , a short distance north of the county courthouse . 
 MD 231 is a part of the main National Highway System from MD 5 in Hughesville to MD 2 and MD 4 in Prince Frederick . 
 = = History = = 
 The Prince Frederick Road portion of MD 231 , originally named Benedict Road , was constructed as a gravel road by 1921 . The Hallowing Point Road section was built in gravel around 1923 . Burnt Store Road was constructed of gravel starting in 1930 and was completed by 1933 . At MD 231 's western terminus , Olivers Shop Road was originally MD 232 , which ran from MD 234 at Wicomico north to what was then MD 233 ( Woodville Road ) north of Bryantown . MD 232 was removed from the state highway system around 1989 , leaving MD 231 's western terminus at a county highway . 
 Ferry service began between Benedict and Hallowing Point began around 1933 . On the west side of the Patuxent River , MD 231 originally turned south into the village of Benedict , following Benedict Avenue to the ferry terminal where the avenue starting following the riverbank . The Hallowing Point terminal remains today as a boat ramp immediately south of the bridge . State senator Louis L. Goldstein of Calvert County sponsored a bill to construct a bridge between Benedict and Hallowing Point . In order to get enough votes to pass , the bridge bill stipulated the bridge would have a 25 @-@ cent toll . Work on the Benedict Bridge began in May 1950 . The toll plaza and administration building were completed on the Calvert County side of the bridge in autumn 1951 . The bridge itself and 24 @-@ foot ( 7 @.@ 3 m ) wide gravel approach roads on both sides of the river were completed and opened in spring 1952 . The toll was removed from the bridge in 1955 due to very low traffic ; a daily average of 237 vehicles used the bridge in its first year . By comparison , the bridge had an average annual daily traffic figure of 12 @,@ 312 vehicles in 2013 . 
 The completion of the Benedict Bridge greatly improved the connection between Calvert County and both Charles and St. Mary 's counties . Prior to 1952 , the southernmost bridge on the Patuxent River had been Hills Bridge , by which MD 4 crosses the river at Upper Marlboro . By 1953 , MD 231 between MD 5 in Hughesville and MD 2 in Prince Frederick was marked as a " main highway " on the state highway map . Reconstruction of MD 231 between MD 5 and MD 2 began in 1954 . In both counties , the road was resurfaced in two stages : a first stage of bituminous stabilized gravel and a second stage of bituminous concrete . The reconstruction of MD 231 was completed from Prince Frederick to Hallowing Point in 1956 and from Hughesville to Benedict by 1958 . The Benedict Bridge remained the southernmost crossing of the Patuxent River until the opening of the Governor Thomas Johnson Bridge between Solomons at the bottom of Calvert County and California in St. Mary 's County in 1978 . The " functionally obsolete " bridge underwent major repairs in 2002 , during which the bridge was reduced to one lane of traffic in alternating directions .

 = Providence College = 
 Providence College ( also known as Providence or PC ) is a private , coeducational , Roman Catholic university located about two miles west of downtown Providence , Rhode Island , United States , the state 's capital city . With a 2012 – 2013 enrollment of 3 @,@ 852 undergraduate students and 735 graduate students , the college specializes in academic programs in the liberal arts . It is the only college or university in North America administered by the Dominican Friars . 
 Founded in 1917 , the college offers 49 majors and 34 minors and , beginning with the class of 2016 , requires all its students to complete 16 credits in the Development of Western Civilization , which serves as a major part of the college 's core curriculum ( down from 20 credits previously ) . Fr . Brian Shanley has been the school 's president since 2005 . 
 In athletics , Providence College competes in the NCAA 's Division I and is a founding member of the Big East Conference and Hockey East . In December 2012 , the College announced it and six other Catholic colleges would leave the Big East Conference to form its own league , taking with them the Big East name and branding .

 In 1917 , Providence College was founded as an all @-@ male school through the efforts of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence and the Dominican Province of St. Joseph . The central figure in the college 's incorporation was Matthew Harkins , Bishop of Providence , who sought an institution which would establish a center of advanced learning for the Catholic youth of Rhode Island . 
 Opening its doors at the corner of Eaton Street and River Avenue in 1919 and with only one building , Harkins Hall , the college under inaugural president Dennis Albert Casey , O.P. ( 1917 – 1921 ) began with 71 students and nine Dominican faculty members . Under second president William D. Noon , O.P. ( 1921 – 1927 ) , the college added its first lay faculty member and opened its first dormitory , Guzman Hall ( now known as Martin Hall ) . Under President Lorenzo C. McCarthy , O.P. ( 1927 – 1936 ) , Providence College athletics soon received their moniker , as the " Friars " in black and white had early success in basketball , football , and baseball . In 1933 , the school received regional accreditation by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges . The college conferred its first Master of Arts , Doctor of Philosophy , and Master of Science degrees by 1935 , the year when the school 's newspaper ( The Cowl ) was first published . 
 By 1939 , Aquinas Hall dormitory had been built to accommodate more students enrolling in general studies , but with the impact of World War II upon enrollment , President John J. Dillon , O.P. ( 1936 – 1944 ) lobbied Rhode Island 's congressional delegation to pressure the War Department to assign Providence College an Army Specialized Training Program unit . Unit # 1188 arrived on campus in the Summer of 1943 , allowing the college to continue operation . A class of approximately 380 soldiers @-@ in @-@ training studied engineering at Providence College for a year before going overseas . 
 = = = Post @-@ World War II expansion = = = 
 Robert J. Slavin , O.P. served as president from 1947 to 1961 . During his tenure in 1955 , Providence acquired the House of Good Shepard property that pushed the original boundaries of campus to Huxley Avenue . Slavin also oversaw the establishment of the Reserve Officers ' Training Corps ( ROTC ) on campus in 1951 , and the Liberal Arts Honors Program in 1957 . 
 The athletics program of the college gained acceptance into the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) in 1948 . Prior to the opening of Alumni Hall in 1955 , the men 's basketball team played in local Providence high schools . The college also hired Joe Mullaney as the men 's basketball coach . 
 President Vincent C. Dore , O.P. ( 1961 – 1965 ) opened the doors of the college 's graduate school as well as a new dormitory building , now called Meagher Hall . President William P. Haas , O.P. ( 1965 – 1971 ) opened Phillips Memorial Library in 1969 .

 In 1967 , the college added its first lay faculty members in its Departments of Theology and Philosophy , as well as its first full @-@ time female faculty member . Two years later , the student dress code was abolished . In 1970 , the college decided to admit women starting with the 1971 – 1972 school year . The same year , the first female administrator was hired . 
 Subsequent president Thomas R. Peterson , O.P. ( 1971 – 1985 ) instituted the Development of Western Civilization program , while in 1974 , the college acquired the property of the former Charles V. Chapin Hospital on the other side of Huxley Avenue . The campus was then split in half by Huxley Avenue , providing an " Upper " campus ( due to the uphill nature of the landscape on Smith Hill ) and " Lower " campus ( the new , flatter area of the College ) . In 1974 , the School of Continuing Education awarded the college 's first Associate 's degree . 
 With men 's basketball tickets becoming a hot commodity at the 2 @,@ 600 @-@ seat Alumni Hall gymnasium , and with the opening of the Providence Civic Center in 1972 , the Friars moved downtown in time for their Final Four appearance behind Providence natives Ernie DiGregorio and Marvin Barnes . Two years later , the men 's hockey team played their first season in the new home on campus , as Schneider Arena opened in 1974 with Ron Wilson leading the way . 
 In the early morning hours of December 13 , 1977 , a dormitory fire killed ten female residents of Aquinas Hall . Meanwhile , the demographics of the student body continued to change , as women outnumbered men in incoming classes and non @-@ Rhode Island students soon outnumbered in @-@ state students . In 1984 , Peterson also opened St. Thomas Aquinas Priory at the entrance of campus to accommodate the growing number of Dominican brethren living on campus . 
 = = = Recent expansion = = = 
 John F. Cunningham , O.P. ( 1985 – 1994 ) succeeded Peterson as president in 1985 and saw the Friars men 's hockey team win the inaugural Hockey East Championship the same year over rival Boston College and reach the championship game of the NCAA Tournament to lose 2 – 1 to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute . Men 's basketball again took center stage on the Providence campus , as coach Rick Pitino and senior Billy Donovan took the Friars to their second Final Four appearance in the 1987 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament . Cunningham used the exposure and fundraising opportunities to build two apartment @-@ style residence halls on campus , Davis and Bedford Halls , providing an alternative to dormitory and off @-@ campus housing for upperclassmen . 
 Philip A. Smith , O.P. ( 1994 – 2005 ) succeeded Cunningham in 1994 and oversaw the new influence of women 's athletics at Providence , as several alumni and then @-@ current students won the gold medal for women 's ice hockey as part of the U.S. national team in the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano , Japan . 
 By 2001 , a new on @-@ campus chapel was built , St. Dominic Chapel , followed three years later by the construction of two other major buildings on " Lower " campus : Suites Hall , a suite @-@ style residence hall to provide added upperclassmen housing , and the Smith Center for the Arts . Elected in 2005 , President Brian J. Shanley , O.P. ( 2005 – present ) has overseen the construction of the Concannon Fitness Center in 2007 as part of an overall renovation to Alumni Hall , as well as renovation and expansion of the Slavin Center in 2009 . In 2012 , a groundbreaking was held for the <unk> Center for the Humanities . 
 Shanley also removed the college 's SAT requirement for admissions in addition to transferring a significant portion of the school 's scholarship funds to need @-@ based aid , in order to give more diverse students the opportunity to afford the college . In 2008 , Shanley oversaw the founding of the Providence College School of Business ( <unk> ) , creating separate Schools of Arts and Sciences and Professional Studies .

 Renovations completed in 2009 to the Slavin Center , the campus student union , added solar panels and a <unk> system . 
 After purchasing Huxley Avenue in 2013 , the college began a campus transformation project with plans to develop campus facilities to meet the growing needs of the students . The renovations as of October 2015 include the groundbreaking of the Arthur and Patricia Ryan Center for Business Studies , handicap accessibility to Aquinas Hall , and the addition to outdoor classrooms .

 = = = = Development of Western Civilization = = = = 
 The Development of Western Civilization ( commonly referred to by students as " Civ " or " DWC " ) is a two @-@ year @-@ long program of courses required of all students attending the school , taken in students ' first four semesters at the school . Meeting in the <unk> Center for the Humanities , a lecture hall specifically built in 2013 for the program , the class meets three days a week , with one day being typically reserved for seminar work and / or exams . The class is taught by a team of professors , usually three , who specialize in literature , theology , philosophy , or history . Students move through Western history , studying original texts in each of the four course disciplines . The new Development of Western Civilization Program , implemented in late 2012 , features three semesters of standard lectures which move chronologically from ancient history to the modern period . The fourth and final semester of the program is organized into various colloquia , specialized courses taught by two professors that are more concentrated to students ' interests and majors . 
 There is a tradition which has grown over time from the course called " <unk> scream . " The event takes place the night before DWC final exams in December and May , and is usually centered on the " quad " area between Aquinas , Meagher , and McDermott Halls . It is intended to be a harmless gathering to let off steam from the long hours of studying for the intense course 's final exam , and is completely unsanctioned . As such , the " <unk> scream " can become loud with wild behavior .

 Broken Sword : The Angel of Death ( Secrets of the Ark : A Broken Sword Game in North America ) is a 3D point @-@ and @-@ click adventure game developed by Revolution Software and Sumo Digital , which was released in 2006 in Europe and Australia and in 2007 in North America . Being released only on Windows , it is the only game in the Broken Sword series not to be released on any console . The player assumes the role of George Stobbart , an American patent lawyer , as he and Anna Maria , a girl with an old manuscript , search for a great treasure that the manuscript leads them to . The game uses a point and click interface , though George 's moves can be controlled using a keyboard . 
 Revolution Software and THQ announced The Angel of Death in August 2005 . According to game director Charles Cecil , after the release of Broken Sword : The Sleeping Dragon , the demand from fans for a sequel was overwhelming . Though The Sleeping Dragon benefited commercially from being released on console as well as Windows , it was held back by the constraints of the console versions . As a result , The Angel of Death was written for Windows only . As a series ' first , it was co @-@ developed by Revolution and Sumo Digital instead of having Revolution as the sole developer . It uses Sumo 's <unk> engine and is the first game in history to be amBX enabled . 
 The game has received mostly positive reviews , with critics praising it as a fine example in the adventure gaming genre . While most critics agreed the game addressed many flaws in The Sleeping Dragon , it has also received some criticism , particularly for its rushed ending and at times poor controls . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Broken Sword : The Angel of Death uses both a point and click and direct control interface . The player guides George Stobbart 's movements with a mouse or keyboard , and Nicole Collard is also a playable character in selected portions of the game . George must collect objects that can be used with other collectible objects , parts of the scenery , or other people in the game world to solve puzzles and progress in the game . George can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of what needs to be done to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot . As in the first three Broken Sword games , the death of the player character is possible in The Angel of Death . 
 = = Plot = = 
 After the events in The Sleeping Dragon , George Stobbart is running a bail bonds office in New York with his partner Virgil . George meets Anna Maria , a girl with an old manuscript who wants his help to decode it . A group of mobsters after the manuscript ransack Anna Maria 's hotel room , as well as George 's bail bonds office , and steal the manuscript . George discovers that the mobsters are led by Fingers Martino , who runs an old meat packing factory . George sneaks into the factory and overhears a conversation between Fingers and Mr. <unk> , who has obtained the manuscript . George manages to covertly take back the manuscript , which he examines with Anna Maria . George figures out that the fortified city on it must be Istanbul . 
 In the Pasha Palace hotel in Istanbul , a waiter named Mevlut informs George about a citadel that is located beneath the Topkapi Palace . George and Anna Maria enter the palace and its catacombs where they find a golden cherub ; they take it back to the hotel . After a romantic night with Anna Maria , George wakes up without her , and Mevlut comes in armed with a gun . George is locked up in a cell , as he is suspected to be a terrorist . In his cell , George gets a visit from Father Nicolas and Sister Immaculata , who says that he should meet her on the roof . George escapes from the cell and meets with Immaculata , who appears to be Nicole " Nico " Collard ( his companion in previous installments ) . They return to the hotel , where George finds out Anna Maria has an apartment in Rome . In Rome , in front of Anna Maria 's apartment building , George meets Brother Mark . After George figures out how to enter the building , Mark is not willing to give him a package that has arrived for Anna Maria . Inside her apartment , he finds a photo of Anna Maria who , dressed as a nun , is standing in front of a Vatican wall . Another clue mentions a place near the Vatican , and he also discovers an airline ticket to Phoenix , Arizona . 
 At a monastery in the Vatican , George covertly enters a wafer factory and finds Anna Maria 's file in an office . After George is discovered and is being escorted outside by Cardinal Gianelli , Father Gregor tells him that Anna Maria used to here , but that she has stolen a manuscript , and he hands over his business card . By showing the card to Mark , he is willing to help and gives George Anna Maria 's package . From Mark , he learns about the Black Cat club . The package contains a DVD with an interview with a man called Maynard , who has managed to make " monatomic gold " . Nico leaves to Phoenix to check things out . George gains access to the Black Cat club , where he meets Duane ( who he has met before in previous installments ) . Duane reveals that Spallaci owns the club . Afterwards , George is caught for stealing a towel and tied to a chair . Spallaci interrogates him about Anna Maria , and he overhears the recorded voice of Nico . Shots are being fired , so he thinks Nico has been killed . When he finds a way to escape , he goes for a drink , trying to forget the loss of Nico . The next day , still drunk , he arrives at Anna Maria 's apartment , where Nico returns and George faints . 
 In a flashback scene , Nico explores an old facility in Phoenix , where she is confronted by Spallaci 's men , but is saved by Maynard . However , Maynard dies after he gets locked in the centrifuge , and Nico manages to escape by tricking Spallaci 's men . Back in Rome , Nico informs George that the monatomic gold is being used to build a weapon called the Ark . They return to the monastery and witness Father Gregor shoot Gianelli ; Nico is taken away and George is knocked out . When he awakens , the dying Gianelli hands over a manuscript in Latin , and tells him that the Ark 's purpose is to use the monatomic gold to destroy the unbelievers . George goes to rescue Nico and meets Anna Maria in the catacombs , who tells him her side of the story and that the Ark needs a human interface to be activated . George arrives at the ceremony to see Nico chained to the Ark , ready to become the new Angel of Death . Mevlut , who is in fact ex @-@ Turkish security and only pretended to be a waiter and priest , enters the scene armed with a gun , but Anna Maria points her gun at him as well . George succeeds in stopping the ceremony in time and frees Nico , but Anna Maria and Mevlut shoot each other and die .

 Revolution Software and THQ announced Broken Sword : The Angel of Death on August 17 , 2005 . According to Charles Cecil , the Broken Sword series was originally planned to be a trilogy , but that after the release of Broken Sword : The Sleeping Dragon , the demand from fans for a sequel was overwhelming . Though The Sleeping Dragon benefited commercially from being released on console as well as Windows , this approach required certain development compromises as the PC version , with its superior graphics and processing power , was held back by the constraints of the console versions . As a result , Revolution agreed with THQ to write The Angel of Death for Windows only " so as to really push the boundaries in terms of the technology and graphics . " 
 The Angel of Death was co @-@ developed by Revolution and Sumo Digital , as opposed to the other games in the Broken Sword series , which had Revolution as the sole game developer . Cecil believed that because of the requirement for ever larger development team sizes , it was no longer possible to maintain a large team to write single , original titles . As a result , Revolution concentrated on design , while Sumo concentrated on production . The game uses Sumo 's <unk> engine . It is the first game ever to be amBX enabled . 
 Broken Sword : The Sleeping Dragon was criticized for featuring a high number of action elements , which aimed to put the player under pressure . While Cecil still stood behind this principle , he thought the action elements were not the right approach . The Sleeping Dragon was also criticized for using a high number of crate puzzles . As a result , Cecil reduced the number of them in The Angel of Death . The music in the game was composed by Ben McCullough and features tracks by <unk> . While Rolf Saxon returns to voice George Stobbart , Nicole " Nico " Collard was this time played by Katherine <unk> , making this the first time Nico was voiced by a native French speaker . The rest of the credited voice actors were Regina Regan , Toby <unk> , Bob Golding , Wayne Forester , Andrew Secombe , <unk> Heatley and Alison Pettitt . 
 The Angel of Death was released in Europe on September 15 , 2006 . It was released in North America on February 13 , 2007 as Secrets of the Ark : A Broken Sword Game . The game may be purchased from GOG.com , and is also a part of the Broken Sword Complete package from Mastertronic . As a series ' first , the game 's soundtrack , Broken Sword : The Angel of Death : Soundtrack to the Video Game , was released on the iTunes Store on September 12 , 2006 . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The Angel of Death received mostly positive reviews from critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from critics , the game received an average score of 73 based on 31 reviews , which indicates " mixed or average reviews . " 
 PC Zone said , " It 's hard , its opening acts don 't match the quality of those which follow and some characters grate — but as a modern rendition of a traditional formula , The Angel Of Death has both pointed and clicked wisely . It 's another nail out of the adventure gaming coffin — although admittedly quite a few remain . " Adventure Classic Gaming said , " Not only the game succeeds in addressing many of the flaws in Broken Sword : The Sleeping Dragon that have plagued the previous title , this sequel is able to surpass the high standard and expectation set forth by past games in the series to create yet another chapter in the legend of the Knights Templar . " Eurogamer said , " As an example of classic , back to basics point and click adventuring , there can perhaps be no finer recent example in the genre than The Angel of Death — it 's a nailed @-@ down must @-@ buy if you 're an adventure diehard who plays every one .

 Toronto FC ( TFC ) is a Canadian professional soccer club based in Toronto , Ontario that competes in Major League Soccer ( MLS ) , in the Eastern Conference of the league . The team plays their home matches at their BMO Field , located in Exhibition Place along the western part of the Toronto lake shore . 
 Toronto FC was MLS 's fourteenth , and first Canadian , franchise in the league . The team is coached by Greg Vanney and operated by Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment , which also operates the NHL 's Toronto Maple Leafs , the AHL 's Toronto Marlies , the NBA 's Toronto Raptors ( and the NBA Development League 's Raptors 905 by extension ) and the USL 's Toronto FC II . 
 Toronto FC are five @-@ time Canadian Champions , and its most significant achievement to date is reaching the semifinals of the 2011 – 12 CONCACAF Champions League .

 Toronto was awarded an expansion team in 2005 , with team owner Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd . ( MLSE ) paying $ 10 million for the team . The name of the club was officially announced on May 11 , 2006 . The " FC " in the team 's name is the conventional initialism for Football Club . 
 The announcement followed an online consultation in which the public was invited to vote on the name during a limited period . The voting options were " Toronto Northmen , " " Inter Toronto FC , " " Toronto Reds , " and " Toronto FC . " MLSE 's strategy in choosing " Toronto FC " following this process was based on two reasons . Firstly , over 40 percent of the online vote supported the simplified Toronto FC name during the consultation ; secondly , MLSE hoped that the fairly generic name would help the new club earn a more organic nickname from the Toronto fans rather than having one imposed upon the club . The team has been called " TFC " and " the Reds " by the media and the club .

 Despite a long scoreless streak to start the team 's history , Toronto FC quickly began to establish itself as a club with significant fan support . The club 's first win on May 12 at BMO Field saw Danny <unk> score in the 24th minute , which prompted the sellout crowd to toss promotional plastic seat cushions onto the field in celebration . Though TFC would slip to the bottom of the MLS standings with a record of 6 – 17 – 7 , the club built a foundation as the first Canadian team in MLS . In the club 's second season in 2008 , Toronto hosted the 2008 MLS All @-@ Star Game . The team finished last in the Eastern Conference with a record of 9 – 13 – 8 , but the enthusiastic fan base continued to fill BMO Field to capacity . To determine the Canadian Soccer Association 's representative in the CONCACAF Champions League , Toronto FC played in the inaugural 2008 Canadian Championship competing for the Voyageurs Cup . TFC were the favourites to win the championship in its first year , but the Montreal Impact prevailed . 
 The last @-@ place New York Red Bulls defeated Toronto FC 5 – 0 in the final 2009 regular season game , leaving TFC one point out of the playoffs . Despite bringing in some high profile talent , the Reds could not seem to field a consistent side . Dwayne De Rosario became an immediate scoring influence and Amado Guevara was a strong playmaker and established MLS veteran , but the Honduran 's future at the Canadian club seemed murky with looming 2010 FIFA World Cup duties . Rookie goalkeeper Stefan Frei quickly replaced Greg Sutton as a regular starter and immediately became a fan favourite . TFC only scored 2 goals in the final 15 minutes of games all season ( last in MLS ) . During the same 15 @-@ minute period they gave up 16 goals ( most in MLS ) , thus creating a − 14 goal differential during the final 15 minutes . 
 In the 2009 Canadian Championship , Toronto FC required a four @-@ goal victory over the Montreal Impact in the final game of the competition to nullify the Vancouver Whitecaps ' + 4 goal differential . Anything less would result in Vancouver winning the championship . Toronto FC went down 1 – 0 early , but overwhelmed an under @-@ strength Impact side 6 – 1 on the back of a hat @-@ trick by De Rosario . Guevara added two , scoring in the 69th and 92nd minute . Chad Barrett scored the decisive goal in the 82nd minute , which gave TFC the lead over Vancouver . The unlikely victory was dubbed by fans and media as the Miracle in Montreal . Toronto FC subsequently participated in the 2009 – 10 CONCACAF Champions League , but lost 1 – 0 on aggregate to the Puerto Rico Islanders in the preliminary round of the tournament . 
 After failing to qualify on the final day of the 2009 campaign , Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment said anything short of a playoff spot in 2010 would be unacceptable . With that directive , former director of soccer Mo Johnston hired <unk> and made wholesale changes to the roster to reflect the US Hall of Famer ’ s plan to play a tough , defensive style . Despite scoring troubles , TFC played well at the start , going undefeated in seven games at one time . The team struggled following the World Cup break . Sensing problems in the locker room and to try to salvage the season , MLSE dismissed both Johnston and <unk> on September 14 , naming Earl Cochrane interim director of soccer and Nick <unk> interim coach . The players responded to <unk> 's more open , flexible style , but it wasn 't enough as the club was eliminated from playoff contention with three games left in the season . Off @-@ field issues with season @-@ seat holders over the 2011 season ticket package added to the fans ' frustrations , forcing MLSE to hold a series of town hall meetings . 
 Toronto FC played C.D. Motagua in the preliminary round of the 2010 – 11 CONCACAF Champions League . TFC won 1 – 0 in the first leg on a goal by Chad Barrett , and tied 2 – 2 in the second leg on goals by De Rosario and Barrett , qualifying for the group stage . Toronto FC won their first ever group stage match 2 – 1 against Cruz Azul on August 17 , 2010 . However , the team failed to qualify for the championship round after finishing in 3rd place behind group winners Real Salt Lake and 2nd place Cruz Azul .

 On November 3 , 2010 , MLSE formally announced the hiring of former German international and coach Jürgen Klinsmann , and his California @-@ based company , <unk> , to fix the club 's game . Over the next six months , Klinsmann assessed the club , identifying a playing style and recommended a candidate for the director of soccer position . On January 6 , 2011 , the new management team for Toronto FC was announced . Aron Winter was hired as Head coach with his compatriot , Bob de Klerk named First Assistant coach . Paul Mariner was named as Director of soccer . Winter was selected to bring the Ajax culture , possession and 4 @-@ 3 @-@ 3 system to Toronto FC . Management made wholesale changes to the roster before and during the 2011 season , trading numerous players and eventually their captain and Toronto native De Rosario . 
 Toronto FC used its remaining two designated player slots on two notable European players , signing Torsten Frings and Danny <unk> to 2 @.@ 5 year contracts . The team went on to set a record for most players used in a MLS season with 39 . Despite a strong finish to the season with only 2 losses in their last 12 games , TFC missed the MLS playoffs for a fifth straight year . Nonetheless , they earned a win in their final group stage match of 2011 – 12 CONCACAF Champions League at Pizza Hut Park against FC Dallas , securing a berth in the knockout stage versus LA Galaxy . After a 2 – 2 draw in Toronto before 47 @,@ 658 fans at the Rogers Centre , Toronto FC defeated the Galaxy 2 – 1 in Los Angeles to reach the CONCACAF Champions League semifinals , the first Canadian team to do so . They were defeated by Santos Laguna in their semifinal . 
 On June 7 , 2012 , Aron Winter resigned from the club upon refusing to be reassigned from his Head coaching role after the team started the season with a nine @-@ game losing streak , setting an MLS record for worst start to a season . Under Winter in 2012 , the club 's league record was 1 – 9 – 0 and in all other competitions was 3 – 1 – 4 , including a fourth @-@ straight Canadian Championship . He was replaced by Paul Mariner , but TFC continued to struggle finishing with a 4 – 12 – 8 record in league play under him . Toronto FC also failed to advance in the CONCACAF Champions League , finishing second in its group with a 2 – 2 – 0 record . Overall , they finished the MLS season on a 14 @-@ game winless streak and ended up in last place , with just 5 wins and 23 points ( both franchise lows ) .

 It was announced Kevin Payne would be leaving D.C. United for the general manager position at Toronto FC on November 27 , 2012 . First @-@ time coach Ryan Nelsen replaced Mariner as of January 7 , 2013 . On April 25 , 2013 , Payne signed the first ever young designated player in MLS , Matías <unk> . On July 9 , Payne controversially traded Luis Silva to D.C. United for an undisclosed amount of allocation money . The club fired Payne on September 4 . Following the removal of Payne , recently appointed MLSE president Tim Leiweke reasoned that there were philosophical differences between the two as to how Toronto FC should move forward into 2014 and beyond . Leiweke , who brought David Beckham to the LA Galaxy in early 2007 , quickly revealed that he intended to make TFC more competitive with similarly ambitious , blockbuster signings . On September 20 , Toronto FC announced that the vacant general manager position had been filled by Tim Bezbatchenko . 
 Under Bezbatchenko , Toronto FC made several high profile moves during the 2013 – 14 off season . Among the transfers were MLS veterans Justin Morrow and Jackson ; Brasileiro star Gilberto , United States international Michael Bradley of A.S. Roma , and the return of Toronto FC leading goal scorer De Rosario . On January 10 , 2014 , Tottenham Hotspur announced they had agreed a deal with the club over the transfer of England international Jermain Defoe for a reported fee of £ 6 million , as well as an Advertising Rights Agreement with Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd . This would see Defoe earn a reported £ 90 @,@ 000 a week , making him the highest earner in MLS . These moves required the trade of Matias <unk> to Vancouver , to comply with MLS 's maximum of three designated players per team . On February 7 , 2014 , Brazil national team keeper Júlio César joined on loan from Queens Park Rangers . The team started the year with promise , but much like 2010 , they floundered after the World Cup break . On August 31 , Nelsen was fired by Bezbatchenko a day after a 0 – 3 defeat to the New England Revolution at BMO field , where Nelsen criticized Bezbatchenko in his post @-@ match press conference for putting the players under needless pressure in the media . The head coaching position was filled by former American international and Chivas USA assistant , Greg Vanney . Although the club won the most games in its history , it failed to reach the playoffs for the eighth consecutive year . 
 After completing only 11 months of his four @-@ year contract with TFC , Defoe joined Premier League club Sunderland on January 16 , 2015 , as part of a player exchange sending Jozy Altidore in the other direction . Three days later , the club signed Italian international Sebastian Giovinco on an annual salary of $ 7 million . On September 26 , Giovinco scored and assisted in a 3 – 2 win over Chicago , putting him on 35 points for the season , breaking Chris <unk> 's league record . Toronto FC clinched a playoff berth on October 14 , for the first time in franchise history , and Giovinco 's totals of 22 goals and 16 assists made him the first TFC player to win the MLS Golden Boot . The team were eliminated in the knockout round of the 2015 MLS Cup Playoffs by a 3 – 0 loss at 401 Derby rivals Montreal Impact . On June 29 , 2016 , Toronto FC won its fifth Canadian Championship , as they beat Vancouver 2 – 2 on aggregate , winning on away goals . Giovinco scored a hat @-@ trick against D.C. United , on July 23 , 2016 , in a 4 – 1 home win , surpassing De Rosario 's previous all @-@ time record as Toronto FC 's top scorer by two goals to 35 goals .

 Toronto FC 's biggest rival , Montreal Impact , joined MLS in 2012 . In the years leading up to this , they emerged as fierce rivals during the Canadian Championship . The proximity of the two cities and the fact that Toronto and Montreal are long @-@ standing rivals in NHL ice hockey contributes to these meetings being combative . Since both teams have joined MLS , the rivalry has intensified and the matches have become a Canadian soccer classic , which has also been named the 401 Derby , named after Ontario Highway 401 linking the two cities . On March 16 , 2013 , Toronto FC fans set an MLS record for travelling support with 3 @,@ 200 away fans in Montreal to watch TFC lose 2 – 1 , eclipsing their own record of 2 @,@ 400 at Columbus Crew in 2008 . 
 Columbus Crew and Toronto FC have competed for the Trillium Cup since 2008 . Although a manufactured rivalry , the meetings have since sparked bitterness . On March 28 , 2009 , approximately 1 @,@ 700 Toronto FC supporters travelled to Columbus Crew Stadium and witnessed a 1 – 1 draw , during which they lit a number of flares and allegedly committed vandalism . Following the game some altercations broke out between the two supporter groups . Overwhelmed security called police who ended the melees and made arrests , at which time a TFC fan was tasered while being subdued . The first rematch back in Columbus Crew Stadium following the incident was boycotted by Toronto FC supporters in wake of restrictions imposed on them by Crew officials . 
 Toronto FC also have a rivalry with Vancouver Whitecaps FC .

 = No. 4 Commando = 
 No. 4 Commando was a battalion @-@ sized British Army commando unit , formed in 1940 early in the Second World War . Although it was raised to conduct small @-@ scale raids and harass garrisons along the coast of German occupied France , it was mainly employed as a highly trained infantry assault unit . 
 The unit 's first operation was the successful raid on the Lofoten Islands in March 4 , 1941 . The next two planned operations were both cancelled and it was not until April 22 , 1942 that No. 4 Commando took part in another raid , Operation Abercrombie , a raid on the French coastal town of <unk> . On August 22 , 1942 , No. 4 was one of three commando units selected for the Dieppe raid . Under the command of Lord Lovat , No. 4 Commando landed on the right flank of the main landings and successfully silenced a German gun battery . This was the only complete success of the operation , which was eventually aborted , after less than 10 hours , following heavy losses . 
 As part of the 1st Special Service Brigade , No. 4 Commando took part in the Normandy Landings in June 1944 . Landing on Sword beach 30 minutes before the rest of the brigade , their first objectives were to capture a strong point and gun battery in Ouistreham . After the commandos eliminated these positions they rejoined the brigade , reinforcing the 6th Airborne Division at the Orne bridges . Before the invasion the brigade had been informed that they would stay in France for only a few days . The commando remained there for a further 82 days , protecting the beachhead 's left flank . During that period , No. 4 Commando endured over 50 percent casualties . Finally withdrawn to Britain in September 1944 , they were reassigned to the 4th Special Service Brigade for the assault on Walcheren island . At the end of the war No. 4 Commando became part of the occupation force in Germany , but together with all other army commando units were disbanded in 1946 . 
 = = Background = = 
 The British Commandos were a formation of the British Armed Forces organised for special service in June 1940 . After the Dunkirk evacuation , the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , Winston Churchill , called for a force to be assembled and equipped to inflict casualties on the Germans and bolster British morale . Churchill told the joint Chiefs of Staff to propose measures for an offensive against German @-@ occupied Europe , and stated , " they must be prepared with specially trained troops of the hunter class who can develop a reign of terror down the enemy coast . " One staff officer , Lieutenant Colonel Dudley Clarke , had already submitted such a proposal to General Sir John Dill , the Chief of the Imperial General Staff . Dill , aware of Churchill 's intentions , approved Clarke 's proposal and on 23 June 1940 , the first commando raid took place . 
 The request for volunteers for special service was initially restricted to serving Army soldiers within certain formations still in Britain , and from men of the disbanding divisional Independent Companies originally raised from Territorial Army divisions who had served in Norway . 
 By November 1940 , more than 2 @,@ 000 men had volunteered and were organised into four battalions in a Special Service Brigade , under the command of Brigadier J. C. Haydon . The Brigade quickly expanded to 12 battalions , which were renamed commandos . Each commando had a lieutenant colonel as the commanding officer ( CO ) and numbered around 450 men ( divided into 75 man troops that were further divided into 15 man sections ) . Technically these men were only on secondment to the commandos ; they retained their regimental cap badges and remained on the regimental roll for pay . The new force of commandos came under the operational control of the Combined Operations Headquarters . 
 = = Formation = = 
 No. 4 Commando was formed in Weymouth on 21 July 1940 , when the first intake of 500 volunteers arrived . The unique nature of the commandos immediately became apparent when every man was held responsible for finding his own quarters . As commandos were expected to be fighting troops , they had no administrative personnel , such as clerks and cooks for example . To assist them with living ' off camp ' , with no cook house all ranks were given a daily allowance and a ration card , the allowance being 67 pence for officers and of 34 pence for other ranks . This arrangement meant that commandos lived on civilian rations , while the rest of the armed forces had the more plentiful military scale of rations . 
 Lieutenant Colonel <unk> <unk> , <unk> and the Regimental Sergeant Major W. Morris held their first parade on 22 July 1940 , at Weymouth Pavilion . The volunteers were informed of the intended role for the commandos and that training would be " tough and demanding and any who could not measure up to the standard required would be returned to their parent unit without any leave of appeal " . 
 Training started immediately and concentrated on physical fitness , weapons training , movement across country including cliff climbing , obstacle crossing and raiding operations . Weapons training was limited by the lack of anything other than the personal weapons ( rifles and pistols ) that each man had brought with him . Machine guns or anything heavier were available at the time . In August 1940 , some officers and non @-@ commissioned officers ( NCO ) were sent to Achnacarry in the Scottish Highlands on a commando course . These men were then responsible for teaching the rest of the unit . 
 No. 4 Commando remained at Weymouth until 13 October 1940 , when it boarded trains for Scotland . Arriving on the River Clyde at 06 : 00 the next day , they were sent on board HMS Glengyle , an Infantry landing ship . Glengyle sailed on 18 October for Inveraray , to conduct training for the first time with Assault Landing Craft . The move to Scotland became permanent and No. 4 Commando were based at Ayr . 
 While all this was going on , a decision was made to concentrate the commandos and Independent Companies into five large 1 @,@ 000 man battalions , each of two companies . No. 4 Commando was renamed the No. 1 Company of the 3rd Special Service Battalion , under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Dudley Lister . No. 2 Company was formed by the re @-@ designation of No. 7 Commando . This new formation proved to be too large and unwieldy in practice . Within three months , the Special Service Battalions were disbanded and the original commando units reformed but on a smaller scale with six troops instead of the original ten . Each troop would comprise three officers and 62 other ranks ; this number was set so each troop would fit into two Assault Landing Craft . The new formation also meant that two complete Commando units could be carried in the ' Glen ' type landing ship and one unit in the ' Dutch ' type landing ship .

 = = = Lofoten Islands = = = 
 On 20 February 1941 , No. 4 Commando were informed they would be going to Troon in Scotland for an exercise . The next day the unit boarded HMS Queen Emma , but on 22 February 1941 , after they anchored at Scapa Flow , their real objective was divulged . Together with No. 3 Commando they were to conduct Operation Claymore , a raid on the Lofoten Islands . Claymore 's main objective was to stop the manufacture of fish oil and its exportation to Germany , where it was used in making explosives . 
 Extra training commenced on board ship , including how the men were to get to their boat stations to disembark . Each troop also rehearsed its own part in the mission . Lectures were given in escape and evasion and troop commanders and NCO 's were given small silk maps of Norway to help with any escape attempt . Another item of escape equipment issued was a pair of trouser fly buttons that , when placed one on top of the other , became a small compass . 
 Claymore took place on 4 March 1941 . The Germans were caught unprepared and the landings were unopposed . Within an hour No. 4 Commando had taken all its objectives . The raid was a success : 11 fish oil factories and storage tanks were destroyed , 10 ships sunk , 225 prisoners taken with an unknown number of German sailors killed on the sunken ships . An added bonus were the 315 Norwegian volunteers brought back to join the Free Norwegian Forces . 
 = = = Operation Puma = = = 
 After returning from Norway , training started for Operation Puma , the occupation of the Canary Islands . The operation was planned following intelligence that Spain was going to join the war on the side of the Axis forces . The intention was to prevent Germany using the islands as a U @-@ Boat base . The force assembled included five commando units , an army brigade , two Royal Marine brigades and supporting arms . Training for Operation Puma culminated in landing exercises in the Hebrides from the Landing Ship , Infantry HMS Royal Scotsman . The operation was renamed Operation Pilgrim and after a number of delays was put on hold by the Chiefs @-@ of @-@ Staff . On 13 September a token force including a troop from No. 4 Commando was dispatched to West Africa . The troop was based in Sierra Leone and Nigeria until returning to Britain in February 1942 , after the cancellation of the operation . While this was happening a new second in command ( 2IC ) was appointed , Major Charles Vaughan , and a Captain Lord Lovat joined the unit as the training officer . Lovat had been attached to the Lofoten raid as an observer and had applied for a posting to the commandos . 
 = = = Operation Bludgeon = = = 
 In February 1942 , A , B and C Troops were dispatched to the Outer Hebrides under the command of Captain Lord Lovat for extra training . Returning to Troon in March , they were immediately sent to Dartmouth , Devon where they embarked on HMS Prins Albert . Once on board they were informed about Operation Bludgeon and started mission training . The objective of this raid was a large building that was a short distance inland from the Dutch coast , and that was used by senior German officers . For the duration of the operation B Troop were issued with flamethrowers to set the building on fire . After several days training , the commandos moved around the coast and anchored in the Thames waiting for the order to go . The operation was eventually cancelled , due to the increased German E @-@ Boat activity in the area of the landing . 
 = = = St Nazaire = = = 
 The St Nazaire raid had the objective of destroying the Normandie dry dock , which would prevent its use by any large German warship if that had been damaged or in need of repair . The majority of land force for the raid was supplied by No. 2 Commando , led by Lieutenant Colonel Newman . However the Special Service Brigade headquarters , used the raid to provide experience for their other units and 92 men were drawn from , No 's 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 9 and 12 Commandos to go on the raid . The No. 4 Commando contingent was 12 other ranks commanded by Lieutenant H Pennington . They had all previously served in the Royal Engineers and left under the impression they were going on a Harbour Demolition Course . After their training at Cardiff and Southampton Docks only six of the 12 were selected to go on the raid . Three of the six including Lieutenant Pennington were killed before they were able to land , when their Motor Launch was engaged by the German coastal defence batteries . The other men who had not been selected for the raid were returned to No. 4 Commando . 
 = = = Operation Abercrombie = = = 
 Operation Abercrombie was a raid on the French coastal town of <unk> . Only B and C Troops supported by detachments from the Royal Engineers and the Carleton and York Regiment of Canada participated . The raid was under the overall command of Lord Lovat , with the objective of capturing prisoners and causing as much damage as possible . For this raid they were going to try a different system to cross the channel . Instead of using Infantry Landing Ships to cross the Channel they would be taken across on Motor Gun Boats towing Assault Landing Craft ( LCA ) . The combined force left Dover on 19 April 1942 . En route , one LCA sank with the loss of two commandos who were manning a Bren gun in the bow . The raid was called off and they returned to Dover . A replacement LCA was obtained and they returned to France on 21 April . This time the crossing was uneventful and the commandos made a successful landing . However , the two commando troops were discovered cutting the barbed wire beach obstacles and German machine guns opened fire . The raiders did carry out a reconnaissance of the area but were unable to capture any prisoners . The commandos returned without loss , but one man was wounded in the leg . The smaller Canadian detachment was unable to locate the target beach and returned to Britain . After the raid there was another change in command . Lieutenant Colonel Lister left to form No. 10 ( Inter @-@ Allied ) Commando and Major Vaughan became the temporary commanding officer . Vaughan left shortly afterwards to take over command of the Commando Depot at Achnacarry and was succeeded by Lord Lovat with Major Derek Mills @-@ Roberts becoming the 2IC . 
 = = = Dieppe Raid = = = 
 Originally conceived in April 1942 , " Operation Rutter " was to conduct a major division @-@ sized raid on a German held port of Dieppe on the French channel coast and to hold it for the duration of at least two tides . They would effect the greatest amount of destruction of enemy facilities and defences before withdrawing . The original plan was approved by the Chiefs of Staff in May 1942 . This plan included two parachute landings behind the artillery batteries on either side of the main landing beaches . The parachute operation was later cancelled and instead No. 3 , No. 4 and the newly formed ' A ' ( Royal Marine ) Commando were to land by sea and attack the artillery batteries and the harbour . The Dieppe Raid was a major operation planned by Admiral Lord Mountbatten and Combined Operations Headquarters . The attacking force consisted of around 6 @,@ 000 troops . The Royal Navy supplied 237 ships and landing craft , and the Royal Air Force 74 squadrons of aircraft , of which 66 were fighter squadrons . 
 Landing on the eastern flank No. 3 Commando would assault the Goebbels artillery battery , while No. 4 Commando would be responsible for the Hess battery on the western flank . The Hess battery consisted of six 150 millimetres ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) guns in a concrete emplacement 1 @,@ 100 yards ( 1 @,@ 000 m ) inland from the coastal cliffs . The emplacement was surrounded by two rows of barbed wire , and protected by several machine gun posts . A nearby anti @-@ aircraft tower could also defend against a ground attack on the guns . The commandos were responsible for their own planning and selected two landing beaches codenamed Orange one and two . Orange One at <unk> was overlooked by a chalk cliff but had two gullies leading to the top of the cliff . Before the war there were steps down to the beach . But these had been removed and the gullies filled with barbed wire and other obstacles . The second beach Orange Two was at <unk> 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) further west at the mouth of the River <unk> . This offered access to the top of the cliffs but was covered by two machine gun pillboxes and barbed wire and it was further away from their target . Intelligence had estimated that the strength of the battery was between 120 – 175 men , supported by two infantry companies stationed nearby . 
 The plan was for four troops ( A , B , C and F ) , headquarters and attached specialists , to be divided into two groups . Group one under the command of Major Mills @-@ Roberts would land at Orange One and consisted of C Troop , a section from A Troop , the mortar detachment and some of the specialists . They would scale the cliffs and form a fire base in the woods in front of the battery to support the assault . Group two commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Lovat would land at Orange Two and take out the beach defences . B and F Troops would then advance move along the river and assault the battery from the rear . The rest of A Troop would be the reserve , positioned between the two beaches . After the attack Group two would withdraw through Group one and be picked up by the waiting LCAs on Orange One beach . 
 No. 4 Commando made the crossing to Dieppe on board HMS Prins Albert . The crossing was uneventful and at 04 : 50 just before daybreak Group one landed unopposed . Using two Bangalore <unk> to blow a hole in the barbed wire , they managed to scale the cliffs . As they approached the battery at 05 : 45 it opened fire on the main landing force coming ashore at Dieppe . This was 30 minutes before Group one was expected to be in a position but Mills @-@ Roberts responded by speeding up the advance to get their guns into action sooner . Once in position they opened fire on the battery with their mortars , Bren machine guns and sniper rifles . One of the mortar bombs landed inside the battery and exploded the stored charges , putting the guns out of action . 
 Group two had an opposed landing being greeted by machine gun fire from the two pillboxes guarding the beach . Leaving a section from A Troop to deal with them the rest of the Group ran the 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) to the rear of the battery , bypassing German infantry positions on the way . The A Troop section having finished off the pillboxes , set out for Orange one beach , ambushing a German patrol on route . While this was happening Lovat and the other two troops , were preparing to assault the battery from different directions . The men from B Troop approached from behind the anti @-@ aircraft tower , as they could still see some Germans moving about on it , they detached three men to deal with them . At the same time they stumbled across and captured a machine gun post . At 06 : 15 the assault started , F Troop discovered a group of Germans forming up to put in their own assault on the fire base . Charging into them they were dispersed without loss to the commandos . The troop continued their advance , moving between some buildings and an orchard , when they were themselves caught in the open by heavy gun fire . Two men in the lead the troop commander Captain <unk> and Lieutenant McDonald were killed while Troop Sergeant Major Stockdale was wounded . It was during this action that the already wounded Captain Porteous , acting as the liaison officer between the two groups was awarded the Victoria Cross . 
 The two Groups were in position , when a pre arranged strafing attack by the Royal Air Force commenced , this signalled an increasing in the rate of fire from Group one . At 06 : 30 a very flare fired by Lovat signalled the start of the assault . Group one ceased firing and B and F Troops charged the battery with bayonets fixed . The objective for B Troop was the battery buildings , while F Troop targeted the guns . Captain Porteous now commanding F Troop was wounded again , this time in the thigh but urged his men on . He was shot for the third time and passed out just as the guns were captured . Demolition experts from F Troop destroyed the guns with pre @-@ formed charges while B Troop searched the battery buildings for intelligence materials . Carrying their wounded with them and escorting prisoners both troops withdrew through the fire base . Still in contact with the Germans both groups of commandos made it to Orange One beach and at 08 : 15 were taken off by the LCAs . They crossed the channel without incident arriving at Newhaven docks at 17 : 45 the same day . 
 For their part in the raid Lovat was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and Mills @-@ Roberts the Military Cross . The cost to the Commando was at first thought to be 23 dead but six were only severely wounded and were eventually reported to be prisoners of war . No. 4 Commandos assault on the battery was the only successful part of the whole operation . The War Office claimed it as " a classic example of the use of well trained infantry ... and a thoroughness in planning , training and execution " , and in February 1943 issued an infantry training pamphlet " in order that all may benefit from the story of a stimulating achievement " . 
 = = = Between Dieppe and Normandy = = = 
 After Dieppe the headquarters staff changed again . Lovat was promoted to brigadier and given command of the 1st Special Service Brigade . Mills @-@ Roberts was promoted and sent to North Africa to take over command of No. 6 Commando . They were replaced by Robert Dawson as the CO and Ronald Menday as 2IC . Other changes included moving to a new base in Falmouth and the formation of a heavy weapons troop in each commando . The new troop with mortar and Vickers machine gun sections provided the heavy weapons needed for their new role as assault infantry . By now the Commandos had started to move away from smaller raiding operations . They were formed into units intended to spearhead future Allied landing operations . To assist in this they were given the organic fire support weapons , that had been absent when they were a raiding force . 
 In June 1943 , 10 months after the Dieppe raid , No. 4 Commando started a new round of training . The program included mountain warfare training at the Commando Snow and Mountain Warfare Training Centre in Scotland . The emphasis here was on fighting and living in the mountains and instruction in how to train a partisan force . Afterwards they moved to another new base in Sussex . Instead of occupying one town , the troops spread out . A and B Troops were billeted at Seaford , C and D Troops at Newhaven and E and F Troops at Lewes . Training was now almost non stop and a number of large scale landing exercises , using the new Landing Craft Infantry took place . In February 1944 , while the rest of No. 4 continued to practice day and night assault landings and live firing exercises . C Troop was sent to qualify as parachutists at the parachute training centre RAF Ringway . The ranks of No. 4 Commando swelled in April 1944 with the arrival of two French troops from No. 10 ( Inter @-@ Allied ) Commando . Other new arrivals were the Lee – Enfield No. 4 rifle , which replaced the old SMLE rifles and the Vickers K machine gun , issued two per troop to provide fire support . To learn the characteristics of these new weapons , the commandos spent days on the rifle ranges learning how to handle them .

The Commando Brigade , consisting of No.s 3 , 4 and 6 Army Commandos and No. 45 ( Royal Marine ) Commando , to land on the extreme flank of the Allied Forces on Queen beach ( Sword ) and cut inland to join forces with two brigades dropped inland by glider and parachute . No. 4 Commando to destroy a battery and the garrison in Ouistreham and then rejoin the Brigade . The rest of the Brigade , landing 30 minutes after No.4 , to fight through enemy defences to reach and reinforce Brigades of the 6th Airborne Division , meeting astride the bridges spanning the River Orne and the Caen Canal . Glider Regiments of the Airlanding Brigade would arrive later the same evening descending in country cleared of the enemy . 
 On 25 May 1944 , No. 4 Commando arrived in Southampton . They occupied a large marshalling area with tight security . Orders detailed their role in the invasion . " The two French troops would attack and destroy a strong point that dominated the beaches known as the Casino , followed by the five British fighting troops , supported by the heavy weapons troop , who were to push on further into the town to destroy a coastal battery . " The German defenders in the area came from the 1st Battalion , 736th Infantry Regiment part of the 716th Infantry Division . They were responsible for the Casino strong point with its 7 @.@ 5 centimetres ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) and 5 @.@ 0 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) guns , the coastal battery with its six 15 @.@ 5 centimetres ( 6 @.@ 1 in ) guns and ten machine guns posts , stretching from the <unk> canal along the seafront to Queen beach at La <unk> , where the commando would be landing . 
 The six British troops on board the Infantry Landing Ships , HMS Princess Astrid and HMS Maid of Orleans and the two French troops on LCIs 523 and 527 left the Solent on 5 June 1944 . When out at sea they were informed that the invasion was going to be in Normandy and more specifically Ouistreham . For the landing each man carried a rucksack weighing 80 pounds ( 36 kg ) containing extra ammunition , for the Brens , mortars , Vickers K guns and PIATs . This was on top of their own personal weapon and ammunition . Unusually each man chose whether to would wear a steel helmet or the Commando green beret . No. 4 Commando were in the second wave and landed behind the initial assault battalion , from the East Yorkshire Regiment , part of the 3rd Infantry Division . Captain Porteous described how their dead and wounded were " just swilling around in the water . " Captain McDougal later wrote , " as we were coming ashore the assault troops were committing suicide by trying to dig in on the beach . In passing I kicked the nearest man telling him to keep going . The man was dead . So was the man next to him and a third was seriously wounded by machine gun fire . " The Commandos followed their drills and cleared the beach as quickly as possible . Once clear they headed for their assembly area , which was also the commando medical post . Leaving their <unk> behind , they set off along the Lion sur Mer road towards their objectives . 
 Lieutenant Colonel Dawson had decided that the two French troops should take the lead into Ouistreham , followed by the six British troops . The French were unopposed apart from some mortar rounds and machine gun fire as they neared their objective . No. 8 French Troop occupied houses at the front and sides of the Casino strong point . An assault to capture the Casino was driven back . While this was going on the other French troop , No. 1 , approached the Casino from the rear . Taking up firing positions they too started to engage the strong point but their fire had almost no effect . The French commander Capitaine de frégate Philippe Kieffer was just about to order an all out assault by both troops , when reports that British amphibious tanks were in Ouistreham reached him . Sending a guide to bring one forward , the tank arrived in front of the Casino and proceeded to destroy the German gun emplacements . Within 30 minutes of the tanks ' arrival , all the strong point guns were silenced and No. 1 Troop had assaulted and captured the objective . With its capture the French Commandos were now in control of the western suburbs of Ouistreham . 
 The rest of No. 4 Commando was moving along the Lion sur Mer road towards their objective the gun battery . The battery was located at the extreme left of the landing beaches . The Orne canal formed its northern boundary and the Casino strong point was to the south . It was surrounded by barbed wire and had three machine gun posts . Two of the posts faced where the canal joined the sea and the third faced up the canal towards the port . To the west of the battery were the houses of the town and the port area of Ouistreham . The order of march was : C Troop to deal with any opposition on route , D Troop who were to force an entrance into the battery , A Troop to provide covering fire for the assaulting troops . In the assault E Troop would take the left hand guns , and F Troop the right . Bringing up the rear was the headquarters and the heavy weapons troop . The heavy weapons troop set up a fire base to support both the French and British attacks if needed . Progress along the road was rapid with only intermittent artillery fire slowing them down . As they advanced , a tank from the 13th / 18th Royal Hussars joined them , just in time to engage German snipers who had started shooting at E and F Troops . 
 As C Troop reached the forming up point for the assault it met heavy machine gun fire from the gun battery . A Troop bypassed them to occupy houses to cover the assault . The next to arrive was D Troop , which had a special ladder to cross the anti @-@ tank ditch around the battery . Realising that the man carrying the ladder had been killed crossing the beach and the ladder left behind , they looked for another way to cross . They discovered wooden planks bridging the gap that the defenders used to access the town . D Troop crossed and captured the machine gun posts around the battery . With the machine guns taken , E and F Troops began their assault . The attack was successful but they discovered the guns were only wooden dummies made from telegraph poles . The real guns had been removed three days previously and positioned further inland . 
 Having captured its objectives , No. 4 Commando reformed and set out to join the rest of the brigade , about 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) away . Lieutenant Colonel Dawson was wounded during the fighting and Major Menday temporarily took command . The march inland to the Orne bridges was uneventful and upon arrival No. 4 Commando dug in on a ridge of high ground to the east of the River Orne towards Sallenelles . Their new position was 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) towards Sallenelles beside the Hauger château . Not long after they arrived and started digging in , the gliders of the 6th Airlanding Brigade began landing to their rear . 
 = = = Orne bridgehead = = = 
 Expecting a Germans counterattack , protective trenches were completed by nightfall . The first night 6 / 7 June was uneventful and " stand to " was 04 : 30 , but there were still no signs of a German attack . During the day there was some sniping in the morning and in the afternoon E and F Troop were subjected to a mortar barrage . By now the trenches were complete with overhead protection and arranged to give an all @-@ round defence . In the French troops ' area some activity was observed and Menday , still in command , suspected an attack from the direction of Sallenelles . Nothing come of that but in the evening of 7 June , some dive bombers strafed the brigade position . By the end of the second day there was still no signs of the expected German ground attack . That night was also uneventful but just after stand to on 8 June , German infantry were observed advancing through the woods to their front . Holding fire until the last minute , the Germans were beaten back but A Troop found themselves surrounded on three sides and forced to withdraw . That night the Germans attacked again , this time targeting C Troop , but were again driven back . Shortly thereafter a group from No. 45 ( Royal Marine ) Commando arrived and reported that the Germans had broken through and were on the road behind No. 4 Commando . Captain Porteous and D Troop moved down the road to deal with them . Outnumbered two to one D Troop charged , killing some and forcing the rest to withdraw . 
 The next morning 10 June , from 09 : 30 to 10 ; 00 the No. 4 Commandos position was subjected to heavy artillery and mortar bombardment . For the two hours before this , No. 6 Commando was heavily bombed , which was followed up by a ground assault that lasted until midday . Suspecting an attack on their own position No. 4 Commando stood to . The attack did not materialise until 17 : 00 , when massed German infantry were observed forming up in front of F Troop . At the same time an artillery Forward Observation Officer arrived from brigade , he contacted the 25 pounder guns attached to the 6th Airborne Division and requested 12 rounds of rapid fire . The rounds landed on target and another 12 were called for , breaking the German attack . The British artillery was not alone — since digging in , the Commandos had been on the receiving end of artillery and mortars which was steadily taking its toll in casualties . E Troop for example were now under the command of a section sergeant and had only 20 men left from a complement of 65 . 
 Elsewhere the Germans were attacking A , C and the French troops . C Troop had ambushed the Germans , moving forward to attack and then fought off a second attack . The attack on the French position was supported by a tank , which they only managed to knock out with a PIAT after it had got behind them . In both these attacks the commandos were involved in hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat to keep the Germans from overrunning their positions . From 11 June the German pressure on the commando line lessened . They were still subject to artillery and mortar fire but there were no more infantry attempts to dislodge them . In the days since landing No. 4 Commando had taken 50 percent casualties . Before the landings 1st Special Service brigade had been informed they would be withdrawn in a few days , after the Allies had broken out from the beachhead . Problems capturing Caen meant the commandos and airborne division had to remain to secure the left flank along the line of the Orne . They did not get relieved for 82 days , during which they not only held the left flank but on 18 August started their own break out . With No. 4 Commando leading the first village liberated was Bavent followed by Beaumont en Auge . <unk> was entered over the night of 25 / 26 August and <unk> the following day . Here they remained until 6 September when the brigade was withdrawn and sent back to Britain , for 14 days leave . 
 = = = Walcheren = = = 
 On their return from leave , No , 4 Commando had been made back up to full strength with casualty replacements . The commando were informed they would be joining the 4th Special Service Brigade to replace No. 46 ( Royal Marine ) Commando . Arriving in Belgium they discovered that the brigade was already well into training for Operation <unk> . This was an assault landing on the island of Walcheren to open the sea route into Antwerp . The city had already been liberated but the northern bank of the Scheldt was still in German hands , enabling them to sink shipping trying to use the port . The First Canadian Army would attack across the causeway from the east . In support of them 4th Special Service Brigade would carry out an assault from the sea . The majority of the brigade would land at Westkapelle , No. 4 Commandos objective was further south at Flushing , with the 155th ( South Scottish ) Brigade landing behind them . 
 In preparation for the landing orders were issued to ensure everyone was fit and to concentrate on weapons firing and street fighting . The two French troops were still under command and just for this operation No. 4 Commando took command of a section from the Dutch Troop , No. 10 ( Inter @-@ Allied ) Commando , and groups from the Special Boat Section ( SBS ) , Royal Engineers and the Royal Artillery to call for artillery fire support . For some reason the old method of calling troops by letters of the alphabet was dropped and the troops were now numbered . The No.1 to No.4 Troops were British and No.s 5 and 6 French . The heavy weapons troop was No. 4 Troop . The final plan for the assault was for the SBS and a section from No. 1 Troop , to go first and reconnoitre a suitable landing point . Following them , the rest of No.1 , No. 2 Troop and commando headquarters would secure the beachhead . They would then be joined by the remaining troops , passing through the beachhead and into the town . No.1 Troop would secure the left flank and No. 2 Troop the right . 
 The operation to liberate the island started at 04 : 45 1 November 1944 , when No. 4 Commando left <unk> by LCAs for their objective the town of Flushing . On their way in and 60 minutes before they were expected to land a heavy artillery bombardment started . By 05 : 45 the SBS group landed beside the Oranje Molen windmill . They cleared the mines , other obstacles and dealt with the German guards without firing a shot . Then they marked the landing spot for the rest of the commando , No. 1 and No.2 Troops were the next to land . They extended the beachhead and captured machine gun posts and heavy gun emplacements . Another weapon captured was a 50 millimetres ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) anti @-@ aircraft gun which supported the other troops when they moved into the town . The final wave landed at 06 : 30 , but had to contend with heavy and accurate fire . One LCA carrying the heavy weapons troop was sunk containing most of their weapons and equipment . Once on the island No. 3 and No.5 Troop moved into the town held by the large numbers of Germans defending the area . No. 6 Troop captured the post office and 50 prisoners . In the afternoon No. 1 Troop was released to support No. 3 and together they advanced again before nightfall . No. 4 Commando had by then secured most of the old town and their flanks were secure . 
 The advance continued the next day . No. 5 Troop , unable to use the streets , advanced by mouse @-@ holing , blowing holes in house walls , with ready @-@ made charges every man carried . No. 6 Troop had dug in and controlled the area between the old and new towns , which allowed the 155th ( South Scottish ) Brigade which was following up to bypass them . By that afternoon No. 4 Commando controlled the town . 
 On 3 November the commandos gave control of Flushing to the 52nd ( Lowland ) Infantry Division and prepared to move by sea to support the rest of the brigade at Westkapelle . Before they could disembark , weather conditions deteriorated and they were forced to march around the coast to reach brigade headquarters at <unk> . Lack of supplies curtailed their involvement in the battle for the next two days . Supplies eventually caught up with them and on 6 November they prepared to continue . By now intelligence from Dutch residents and prisoners had revealed that the remaining Germans were holed up in the wooded area between <unk> and <unk> . 
 At 04 : 45 , 7 November No. 4 Commando were ready to start their assault , with No. 3 Troop on the left , the two French troops in the middle and No. 2 Troop on the right . The commandos moved forward , winning a number of small skirmishes , when at 08 : 15 three German officers appeared and offered the surrender of all the remaining German forces in the area . Lieutenant Colonel Dawson met with the German commander and a formal surrender was agreed and 900 prisoners were taken . Other Germans surrendered to some of the Royal Marine commandos at the same time . In the whole operation No. 4 Commando had suffered 13 dead , 21 wounded versus about 200 German dead and the capture of 1 @,@ 200 prisoners and large amounts of weapons and equipment . The total casualties for 4th Special Service Brigade were 103 dead , 68 missing and 325 wounded . 
 = = = Disbandment = = = 
 No. 4 Commando remained at Walcheren until 14 November 1944 , then moved to De Haan , Belgium , to rest and re @-@ equip . They then moved to Blankenberge in Belgium where reinforcements arrived to bring them back up to full strength . They returned to Walcheren to defend the northern coastal areas . Of particular concern was the island of Schouwen @-@ Duiveland , with an estimated garrison of 5 @,@ 000 men and artillery . The objective was " to prevent enemy infiltration and sabotage " . Lieutenant Colonel Dawson allocated stretches of the coast to each troop and taking the offensive to the enemy , started a programme of raids on Schouwen @-@ Duiveland . At this stage of the war these raids were generally successful . Most patrols brought back prisoners and inflicted casualties on the German defenders . One raid was supposed to meet a party from the Dutch resistance that landed without being discovered , but was then disturbed by a German patrol who first fled rather than putting up any resistance . The commandos later learned that this Dutch resistance group had been captured by the German patrol and all its members were hanged the next morning . 
 In March 1945 , No. 4 Commando was relieved by No. 47 ( Royal Marine ) Commando and moved to Middelburg and stayed at Bergen @-@ Op @-@ Zoom by April . While responsible for the security of the immediate area , they conducted small raids from the sea against Zuid Holland . Germany surrendered on 8 May 1945 . On the No. 4 Commando front the two French troops crossed the channel to Schouwen and Lieutenant Colonel Dawson accepted the unconditional surrender of all German forces in the region . Within days of the surrender No. 4 Commando moved to Recklinghausen in Germany as part of the occupation forces . In Recklinghausen part of their duties were to provide the guard force for a civilian internment camp . The camp housed several thousand Nazi civilians who were not prisoners of war . Inmates included those with no identification and those known to have served in concentration camps . The two French troops returned to French control and were demobilised . Other men were posted to No.s 3 and 6 Commandos in Britain , who were preparing for a move to the Far East to continue the fight in the Burma campaign . By June 1945 the strength of No. 4 Commando had been reduced to 188 all ranks . During a visit in October 1945 , Lieutenant General Robert Sturges informed them that the War Office had decided to disband all army commandos . Those not due to be demobilised would be returned to their parent regiment or corps . No. 4 Commando was formally disbanded in January 1946 .

 = Ian Chappell = 
 Ian Michael Chappell ( born 26 September 1943 ) is a former cricketer who played for South Australia and Australia . He captained Australia between 1971 and 1975 before taking a central role in the breakaway World Series Cricket organisation . Born into a cricketing family — his grandfather and brother also captained Australia — Chappell made a hesitant start to international cricket playing as a right @-@ hand middle @-@ order batsman and spin bowler . He found his niche when promoted to bat at number three . Known as " Chappelli " , he earned a reputation as one of the greatest captains the game has seen . Chappell 's blunt verbal manner led to a series of confrontations with opposition players and cricket administrators ; the issue of sledging first arose during his tenure as captain and he was a driving force behind the professionalisation of Australian cricket in the 1970s . 
 John Arlott called him , " a cricketer of effect rather than the graces " . An animated presence at the batting crease , he constantly adjusted his equipment and clothing , and restlessly tapped his bat on the ground as the bowler ran in . Basing his game on a sound defence learned during many hours of childhood lessons , Chappell employed the drive and square cut to full effect . He had an idiosyncratic method of playing back and across to a ball of full length and driving wide of mid on , but his trademark shot was the hook , famously saying " three bouncers an over should be worth 12 runs to me " . A specialist slip fielder , he was the fourth player to take one hundred Test catches . 
 Since his retirement in 1980 , he has pursued a high @-@ profile career as a sports journalist and cricket commentator , predominantly with Channel Nine . He remains a major figure in Australian cricket : in 2006 , Shane Warne called Chappell the biggest influence on his career . Chappell was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1986 , the FICA Cricket Hall of Fame in 2000 and the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2003 . On 9 July 2009 , Ian Chappell was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame . 
 = = Family and early career = = 
 The first of three sons born in Adelaide to Martin and Jeanne ( née Richardson ) , Chappell was steeped in the game from an early age . His father was a noted Adelaide grade cricketer who put a bat in his hands as soon as he could walk , and his maternal grandfather was famous all @-@ round sportsman Vic Richardson , who captained Australia at the end of a nineteen @-@ Test career . Chappell was given weekly batting lessons from the age of five , as were younger brothers Greg and Trevor , who both also went on to play for Australia . 
 Chappell grew up in the beachside suburb of Glenelg and attended the local St Leonard 's Primary School where he played his first competitive match at the age of seven . He was later selected for the South Australian state schoolboys team . He then enrolled at Prince Alfred College , a private secondary school noted for producing many Test cricketers , including the Australian captains Joe Darling and Clem Hill . His other sporting pursuits included Australian football and baseball : Chappell 's performances for South Australia in the Claxton Shield won him All @-@ Australian selection in 1964 and 1966 as a catcher . He credits Vic Richardson , who had represented both SA and Australia in baseball during the 1920s , for his love of the sport . At the age of 18 , his form in grade cricket for Glenelg led to his first @-@ class debut for South Australia ( SA ) against Tasmania in early 1962 . Chappell replaced West Indian Gary Sobers who was selected for a Test match in the Caribbean . 
 The aggressive style of Sobers and SA captain Les Favell heavily influenced Chappell during his formative years in major cricket . In 1962 – 63 , Chappell made his initial first @-@ class century against a New South Wales team led by Australian captain Richie Benaud , who was bemused by the young batsman 's habit of gritting his teeth as he faced up ; to Benaud , it looked as if he was grinning . Chappell spent the northern summer of 1963 as a professional in England 's Lancashire League with Ramsbottom and played a single first @-@ class match for Lancashire . 
 = = International career = = 
 In 1963 – 64 , Chappell batted at number three for SA for the first time , in a match against Queensland at Brisbane , and scored 205 not out . He was the youngest member of the SA team that won the Sheffield Shield that season . A century against Victoria early the following season resulted in Chappell 's selection for a one @-@ off Test against Pakistan at Melbourne in December 1964 . He made 11 and took four catches , but was dropped until the Fourth Test in the 1965 – 66 Ashes series . Chappell supplemented his aggressive batting with brilliant fielding in the slips , and he showed promise as a leg @-@ spinner . At this point , the selectors and captain Bob Simpson considered him an all @-@ rounder : he batted at number seven and bowled 26 ( eight @-@ ball ) overs for the match . 
 = = = <unk> start = = = 
 He retained his place for the following Test and for the tour of South Africa in summer 1966 – 67 . Playing in a side defeated 1 – 3 , Chappell struggled to make an impression . His highest score in ten Test innings was 49 , while his five wickets cost 59 runs each . On the advice of Simpson , he ceased playing the hook shot as it was often leading to his dismissal . In the first Test of 1967 – 68 against India , he failed twice batting in the middle order . Heading into the second Test at Melbourne , Chappell 's place was in jeopardy , but he rode his luck to score 151 – his innings contained five chances that the Indians failed to take . However , in the remainder of the series , he managed only 46 runs in four innings , so his selection for the 1968 tour of England was based as much on potential as form . 
 In England , Chappell rewarded the faith of the selectors by scoring the most first @-@ class runs on the tour ( 1 @,@ 261 runs , including 202 not out against Warwickshire ) , leading the Australian Test aggregates with 348 runs ( at 43 @.@ 50 ) . His top score was 81 in the fourth Test at Leeds . Wisden lauded his play off the back foot and judged him the most difficult Australian batsman to dismiss . In a summer severely affected by rain , Australia drew the series and retained The Ashes .

 A string of big scores and a record number of catches during the 1968 – 69 season earned Chappell the Australian Cricketer of the Year award . Against the touring West Indies , Chappell hit 188 not out , 123 , 117 , 180 and 165 before the New Year . Two of these centuries came in the Test series , when Chappell 's average for 548 runs was 68 @.@ 50 . Chappell was elevated to number three in the batting order and became a less @-@ frequent bowler ; he was also appointed vice @-@ captain of the team . 
 Following up with a successful tour of India in late 1969 , Chappell demonstrated his fluency against spin bowling by compiling Test innings of 138 at Delhi and 99 at Kolkata . His ability against both fast and slow bowling earned high praise , including from his captain Bill Lawry . When the Australians arrived in South Africa in early 1970 , following their victory over India , Lawry told the local media that Chappell was the best all @-@ round batsman in the world . His appraisal looked misguided when Chappell managed just 92 runs ( at 11 @.@ 5 average ) , with a top score of 34 , as Australia lost 0 – 4 . 
 On this tour , Chappell clashed with cricket administrators over pay and conditions for the first time . The South African authorities requested that an extra Test be added to the fixture and the Australian Board of Control consented . Incensed that the players were not consulted about the change , Chappell led a group of his teammates in a demand for more money to play the proposed game . Eventually the match was cancelled after Chappell and his supporters refused to back down .

 Chappell became South Australian captain when the long @-@ serving Les Favell retired at the start of the 1970 – 71 season . His younger brother Greg made his debut in the second Test of the summer against Ray Illingworth 's England . Facing an English attack led by the hostile fast bowling of John Snow , Chappell scored a half @-@ century in each of the first two Tests , but failed to capitalise on good starts while Greg Chappell scored 108 in his initial innings . Rain caused the abandonment of the third Test without a ball being bowled . Temporarily promoted to open the batting , Chappell failed in the fourth Test as Australia lost . In the fifth Test at Melbourne , he returned to number three and started nervously . Dropped on 0 and 14 , Chappell found form and went on to post his maiden Ashes century ( 111 from 212 balls ) , which he followed with scores of 28 and 104 in the sixth Test . 
 The washed @-@ out Test resulted in a late change to the schedule and an unprecedented seventh Test was played at Sydney in February 1971 . Trailing 0 – 1 in the series , Australia could retain The Ashes by winning this game . Australia 's performances were hampered by playing slow , defensive cricket . In a radical attempt to breathe some aggression into the team , the selectors sacked captain Bill Lawry and appointed Chappell in his stead . Dismayed by the manner of Lawry 's dismissal , Chappell responded with an attacking performance as captain , he won the toss , put England in and dismissed them for 184 , and Australia led the first innings by 80 runs , but set 223 to win they folded for 160 and lost The Ashes after holding them for 12 years . Chappell gained some consolation at the end of a dramatic summer when he led SA to the Sheffield Shield , the team 's first win for seven years . 
 Chappell 's battles against the short @-@ pitched bowling of Snow during the season compelled him to reappraise his game . Following a conversation with Sir Donald Bradman , he decided to reinstate the hook shot and spent the winter months practising the stroke by hitting baseballs thrown by his brother Greg . Although he still regularly lost his wicket after playing the shot , Chappell felt that the psychological benefit of showing aggression to opposing bowlers offset the times that he was dismissed for a low score . 
 = = = A team in his own image = = = 
 Ian Chappell fashioned an Australian team in his own image between 1971 and 1975 : aggressive , resourceful and insouciant . 
 Australia lost an unofficial Test series to a Rest of the World team led by Gary Sobers that toured in 1971 – 72 as a replacement for the politically unacceptable South Africans . Chappell was the outstanding batsman of the series , with four centuries included in his 634 runs , at an average of 79 @.@ 25 . He took the team to England in 1972 and was unlucky not to regain The Ashes in a rubber that ended 2 – 2 . The series began disastrously for Chappell when he was out hooking from the first ball he faced in the opening Test at Manchester . He fell the same way in the second innings and Australia lost the match . However , the team regrouped and had the better of the remaining matches , apart from the fourth Test at Leeds , played on a controversial pitch that the Australians believed was " doctored " to suit the England team . Greg Chappell emerged as a prolific batsman during the series , batting one place below his brother in the order . The siblings shared several crucial partnerships , most notably 201 at the Oval in the last Test when they became the first brothers to score centuries in the same Test innings . Australia won the game , an effort that Chappell later cited as the turning point in the team 's performances . 
 In 1972 – 73 , Australia had resounding victories against Pakistan ( at home ) and the West Indies ( away ) . Chappell 's leadership qualities stood out in a number of tight situations . He hit his highest Test score of 196 ( from 243 balls ) in the first Test against Pakistan at Adelaide . Pakistan " appeared probable winners of the last two Tests on the second last day of each game " , yet Chappell 's team managed to win on both occasions . 
 On indifferent pitches in the Caribbean , Chappell was the highest @-@ scoring batsman of the Test series with 542 runs ( at 77 @.@ 4 average ) . He hit 209 in a tour match against Barbados , two Test centuries and a " glorious " 97 on a poor pitch at Trinidad in the third Test , batting with an injured ankle . This set up a dramatic last day when the West Indies needed just 66 runs to win with six wickets in hand at lunch . The home team collapsed against an inspired Australian bowling attack supported by Chappell 's aggressive field @-@ placements . Chappell 's team would be the last to leave the West Indies as winners for 22 years . 
 = = = The ugly Australians = = = 
 Australia played six Tests against New Zealand on both sides of the Tasman in 1973 – 74 . Chappell led his team to a 2 – 0 victory in the three Tests played in Australia . During the third Test at Adelaide , he equalled the world record of six catches in a Test match by a fielder , which was beaten by his brother Greg the following season . In the drawn first Test at Wellington , the Chappells became the first brothers to each score a century in both innings of a Test match . The Australians lost to the Kiwis for the first time ever in the second Test at Christchurch , when Chappell was involved in a verbal confrontation with the leading New Zealand batsman , Glenn Turner . The Australians then played an ill @-@ tempered tour match at Dunedin that didn 't enhance the reputation of Chappell or his team , before winning the final Test at Auckland . On this tour , the behaviour of the team was questioned with some journalists labelling them " ugly Australians " . In 1976 , Chappell wrote about his attitude to the opposition : 
 ... although we didn 't deliberately set out to be a ' bunch of bastards ' when we walked on to the field , I 'd much prefer any team I captained to be described like that than as ' a nice bunch of blokes on the field . ' As captain of Australia my philosophy was simple : between <unk> and <unk> there was no time to be a nice guy . I believed that on the field players should concentrate on giving their best to the team , to themselves and to winning ; in other words , playing hard and fairly within the rules . To my mind , doing all that left no time for being a nice guy . 
 The increasing prevalence of verbal confrontation on the field ( later known as sledging ) concerned cricket administrators and became a regular topic for the media . Its instigation is sometimes attributed to Chappell . By his own admission , he was a frequent user of profanity who was often at " boiling point " on the field , but claims that the various incidents he was involved in were not a premeditated tactic . Rather , they were a case of him losing his temper with an opponent . 
 = = = The Ashes regained and the first World Cup = = = 
 The highlight of Chappell 's career was Australia 's 4 – 1 win over England in 1974 – 75 that reclaimed The Ashes . Strengthened by the new fast bowling partnership of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson , the Australians played aggressive cricket and received criticism for the amount of short @-@ pitched bowling they employed . Chappell scored 90 on an " unreliable " pitch on the first day of the opening Test at Brisbane . He finished the six Tests with 387 runs at 35 @.@ 18 average , and took 11 catches in the slips . The Test matches attracted big crowds and record gate takings , enabling Chappell to negotiate a bonus for the players from the Australian Cricket Board ( ACB ) . Although this more than doubled the players ' pay , their remuneration amounted to only 4 @.@ 5 % of the revenue generated by the series . 
 Within months , Chappell was back in England leading Australia in the inaugural World Cup . His dislike of the defensive nature of limited @-@ over cricket led to the Australians placing a full slips cordon for the new ball and employing Test @-@ match style tactics in the tournament . Despite the apparent unsuitability of this approach , Chappell guided the team to the final where they lost a memorable match to the West Indies . 
 The workload of the captaincy was telling on Chappell and the four @-@ Test Ashes series that followed the World Cup dampened his appetite for the game . After winning the only completed match of the series , the first Test at Birmingham , Australia 's retention of the Ashes was anti @-@ climactic : the third Test at Leeds was abandoned due to vandalism of the pitch during the night before the last day 's play . In the last Test at the Oval , Chappell scored 192 from 367 balls to set up an apparent victory . However , England managed to bat for almost 15 hours to grind out a draw and Chappell announced his resignation from the captaincy on the final day of the match . In 30 Tests as captain , he scored 2 @,@ 550 runs at an average of 50 , with seven centuries . 
 = = = First retirement = = = 
 Remaining available for Test cricket , he played in the 1975 – 76 series against the West Indies under the captaincy of his brother Greg . Australia avenged their loss in the World Cup final by winning 5 – 1 , claiming the unofficial title of best team in the world . During the season , Chappell incurred censure for his behaviour in a Sheffield Shield match and was warned not to continue wearing a pair of adidas boots with the three stripes clearly visible . This breached the prevailing protocol of cricketers wearing all white . His highest innings of the summer was 156 during Australia 's only loss , at Perth in the second Test . Wisden nominated him as the most influential player of the series for his 449 runs at an average of 44 @.@ 90 . Throughout the course of the series , Chappell passed two significant milestones when he became the fourth Australian to make 5 @,@ 000 runs in Test cricket and the first player to hold one hundred Test catches for Australia . The summer ended in controversy and triumph in the domestic competition . During a dispute with the SACA over team selection , he threatened a " strike " action by the SA team . After the matter was resolved , Chappell led the side to the Sheffield Shield title for the second time in his career and shared the inaugural Sheffield Shield player of the season award with his brother Greg . He retired from first @-@ class cricket at the end of the season , aged only 32 . 
 = = World Series Cricket and aftermath = = 
 In 1976 , Chappell toured South Africa with Richie Benaud 's International Wanderers team , released his autobiography Chappelli and was named as one of five Wisden Cricketers of the Year . He was hired to spend the summer of 1976 – 77 as a guest professional in the Melbourne district competition where he was paid more than he had been as Australian captain . During the season , he was involved in a famous altercation with a young English all @-@ rounder who was in Victoria on a cricketing scholarship , Ian Botham . Both men have put forward vastly different versions as to what happened during the physical confrontation in a Melbourne pub . The animosity between them continues and Channel Nine used it as a marketing ploy when Botham temporarily partnered Chappell as a television commentator during the 1998 – 99 season . Botham again revived the feud in his 2007 autobiography with another version of the incident . 
 = = = Rebel skipper = = = 
 Throughout his career , Chappell found the ACB obdurate in his attempts to make a living from the game . In 1969 and 1970 , they refused his applications to play professionally in England . As Australian captain , he made several unsuccessful representations at ACB meetings in an effort to secure a more realistic financial deal for the Australian players . In consultations with the then @-@ president of the <unk> , Bob Hawke , he explored the possibility of <unk> the players . 
 Approached to lead an Australian team in World Series Cricket ( WSC ) , a breakaway professional competition organised by Kerry Packer for Channel Nine , Chappell signed a three @-@ year contract worth A $ 75 @,@ 000 in 1976 . His participation was , " fundamental to the credibility of the enterprise " . Chappell devised the list of Australian players to be signed , and was involved in the organisation and marketing of WSC . His central role was the result of , " years of personal disaffection with cricket officialdom " , in particular Don Bradman . Recently , Chappell wrote : 
 While captaining Australia , I was approached on three separate occasions before WSC to play ' professional ' cricket , and each time I advised the entrepreneurs to meet the appropriate cricket board because they controlled the grounds . On each occasion , the administrators sent the entrepreneurs packing and it quickly became clear they weren 't interested in a better deal for the players . That 's why I say the players didn 't stab the ACB in the back . The administrators had numerous opportunities to reach a compromise but displayed little interest in the welfare of the players . It wasn 't really surprising then that more than 50 players from around the world signed lucrative WSC contracts and a revolution was born . About half of the WSC players were from Australia and this high ratio can , in part , be attributed to Bradman 's tight @-@ fisted approach to the ACB 's money . 
 In WSC 's debut season of 1977 – 78 , Chappell hit the first Supertest century and finished fifth in overall averages . The prevalence of short @-@ pitched fast bowling and a serious injury to Australian David Hookes led to the innovation of batting helmets ; Chappell was one of the many batsmen to use one . Following their 1975 – 76 tour of Australia , the West Indies adopted a four @-@ man fast bowling attack , while the World XI contained fast bowlers of the calibre of Imran Khan , Mike Procter , Garth Le Roux , Clive Rice and Sarfraz Nawaz . The constant diet of pace bowling undermined the confidence of some batsmen during WSC . Chappell 's form fell away during the second season and he scored only 181 runs at 25 @.@ 85 in four <unk> . During the last six days of the season , the WSC Australians lost the finals of both the limited @-@ overs competition ( to the West Indies XI ) and the Supertest series ( to the World XI ) , thus forfeiting the winner @-@ takes @-@ all prize money . After the latter match , Chappell vented his frustrations on World XI captain Tony Greig by refusing to shake his hand and criticising Greig 's inconsequential contribution to his team 's victory . The final act of the competition was a series between the WSC Australians and the WSC West Indies played in the Caribbean in the spring of 1979 . After the Australians suffered a heavy defeat in the first Supertest at Jamaica , Chappell rallied his team to draw the five match series one @-@ all . His best effort were scores of 61 and 86 at Barbados . 
 = = = Return to Tests = = = 
 Convinced to return to official cricket when WSC ended , Chappell resumed as captain of SA in 1979 – 80 , a decision he later regretted . It was a season too far for the increasingly irascible Chappell . Reported by an umpire for swearing in a match against Tasmania , he received a three @-@ week suspension . In his first match after the ban , he was again reported for his conduct in a game against the touring English team . Given a suspended ban by the ACB , he was then selected for Australia 's last three Tests of the season . His Test career finished with scores of 75 and 26 not out at the MCG against England in February 1980 . In his final first @-@ class match , SA needed to beat Victoria to win the Sheffield Shield . Although Chappell scored 112 , SA lost the match and the shield . Ironically , the umpires voted him the competition 's player of the season for a second time . 
 = = = ODI record = = = 
 Chappell 's aggressive approach suited limited @-@ overs cricket : he scored his runs at a strike @-@ rate of 77 runs per hundred balls . The timing of his career limited him to 16 ODI matches , but he appeared in a number of historic fixtures such as the first ODI ( at the MCG in 1971 ) , the first World Cup final ( at Lord 's in 1975 ) and the first day / night match ( during WSC , at VFL Park in 1978 ) . He passed fifty in half of his innings with a top score of 86 at Christchurch in 1973 – 74 . In his final season of international cricket , he scored 63 not out ( from 65 balls ) against the West Indies at the SCG to win the player of the match award ; five days later he hit an unbeaten 60 from 50 balls in his penultimate ODI appearance , against England . As captain , he recorded six wins and five losses from 11 matches . He is also credited to have hit the first ever six in an ODI match ( which is in fact the first ODI match ever played ) .

 The title of the ABC 's documentary The Chappell Era , broadcast in 2002 , encapsulated Chappell 's significance to Australian cricket . Subtitled Cricket in the ' 70s , it chronicled the rise of the Australian cricket team under Chappell , the fight for better pay for the players , and professionalisation of the game through WSC . During the program , Chappell reiterated his criticisms of cricket 's administration at the time . 
 In Wisden , Richie Benaud wrote , " Chappell will be remembered as much for his bid to improve the players ' lot as he will for his run @-@ getting and captaincy " . During the WSC period , he founded a players ' association with a loan provided by Kerry Packer . Despite Chappell 's continued support for the organisation after his retirement , apathy and a lack of recognition from the ACB led to its demise in 1988 . Revived in 1997 as the Australian Cricketers ' Association ( ACA ) , it is now an important organisation within the structure of Australian cricket . In 2005 , Chappell became a member of the ACA executive . 
 Chappell was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1986 , the FICA Cricket Hall of Fame in 2000 and the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2003 . Two new grandstands at the Adelaide Oval were named the Chappell Stands ; at the dedication ceremony in 2003 , the SACA president Ian McLachlan called the Chappells , " the most famous cricketing family in South Australia " . In 2004 , the Chappell family was again honoured with the creation of the Chappell – Hadlee Trophy , an annual series of ODI matches played between Australia and New Zealand . 
 Chappell is the leading advocate for greater formal recognition of the first Australian sporting team to travel overseas , the Australian Aboriginal cricket team in England in 1868 . 
 = = Media career = = 
 Following the path of his grandfather Vic Richardson , who was a radio commentator for many years , Chappell entered the media in 1973 by writing ghosted magazine articles and a column for The Age . He did television commentary for the 0 – 10 Network and the BBC before playing WSC . During the 1980s , Chappell spent eight years co @-@ hosting with Mike Gibson , Wide World of Sports , an innovative magazine @-@ style program broadcast by Channel Nine on Saturday afternoons and co @-@ hosted a sister show , Sports Sunday , for five years . Early in his stint on the former program , he swore without realising that he was live to air . A similar incident occurred during a live telecast of the 1993 Ashes series . Channel Nine suspended him on both occasions . 
 Chappell began working as a commentator for Channel Nine 's cricket coverage in the 1980 – 81 season , a position he retains .

 The major controversy of his first season was the <unk> Incident , which involved his two younger brothers in an ODI played between Australia and New Zealand at the MCG .

 = = = = Kim Hughes = = = = 
 He supported the claims of Rod Marsh to the Australian captaincy over the incumbent , Kim Hughes , in the early 1980s . The constant campaign against Hughes destabilised his authority . Compounding the situation , the ACB compelled Hughes to be interviewed by Chappell on a regular basis . 
 During the 1981 Ashes , Ian Chappell introduced an interview between Hughes and Richie Benaud by claiming the Australian captain was " thought of that dumb so and so who couldn 't run a bath and who keeps getting caught at deep fine leg . " He also criticised Hughes ' batting . " Hughes needs to score the runs when they are needed most . He is not doing this and his inconsistency is rubbing off on others ... there is a not a lot of thought in his batting " . 
 On the morning of the second test against the West Indies in 1984 – 85 , Chappell asked Hughes " Three months ago , you claimed Australia possessed no Test @-@ worthy legspinner . So what is Bob Holland doing in the team ? " Hughes resigned as captain after that match . 
 Following Hughes ' resignation , Australian cricket went into turmoil and Chappell received a share of the blame for the outcome . 
 = = = = Allan Border & Bob Simpson = = = = 
 Chappell had a direct influence on Hughes ' successor , Allan Border . Early in his captaincy tenure , Border was struggling with the burdens of the position so the ACB appointed Bob Simpson as team coach to assist . This led to animosity between Chappell and Simpson as Chappell derided the need for a coach . Simpson responded by writing that the peer influence of older players helping younger players fell away during the era when the Chappell brothers led the team , and he was redressing the problem . 
 Chappell believed that the Border @-@ Simpson leadership was too defensive and that Simpson usurped too much of Border 's control of the team ; Border heeded Chappell 's assessment and adopted a more aggressive on @-@ field approach later in his career and became known as " Captain Grumpy " to his team mates . Mark Taylor , who captained the team after Border , moved to dilute Simpson 's authority . Chappell remains a long @-@ standing critic of the use of coaches by national teams . 
 = = = = Steve Waugh = = = = 
 Ian Chappell was often critical of Steve Waugh as captain , believing him to be a selfish player and unimaginative captain . When Waugh was appointed captain in 1999 Chappell said : 
 I think he 's been a selfish cricketer . . . I 've always felt that the things you do as a player leading up to getting the captaincy do have an effect [ on ] how players perceive you . I 've had the feeling that a selfish player when he becomes captain . . . gets a little less out of his players than someone who is not selfish . 
 Chappell felt Shane Warne should have been picked as captain instead and his criticism of Waugh 's captaincy did not abate during Waugh 's stint in that role , despite his success . Waugh later wrote of Chappell : 
 Ian Chappell … always sweated on my blunders and reported them with an ' I told you so ' mentality ... To say Chappell 's criticism irked me would be an understatement , though I knew that , like anyone , he was entitled to an opinion . I don 't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact , I would much rather someone make a judgement than not , but I have always felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact ... It was something I had to live with , and when I realised he was never going to cut me much slack , I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside . 
 Chappell rated Ricky Ponting a better captain than Waugh .

Ashley Mallett 's biography , Chappelli Speaks Out ( published in the UK as Hitting Out – the Ian Chappell Story ) was written in collaboration with Chappell and released in 2005 . It caused controversy due to Chappell 's assessment of Steve Waugh , who he described as " selfish " and as a captain , " ran out of ideas very quickly " . Waugh responded by writing , " to say Chappell 's criticism irked me would be an understatement . " He categorised the criticisms as " personal " and noted that Chappell , " always sweated on my blunders and reported them with an ' I told you so ' mentality " .

 Constitution Center ( formerly known as the David Nassif Building ) is an office building located at 400 7th Street SW in Washington , D.C. It is 140 feet ( 43 m ) high and has 10 floors . Covering an entire city block , it is the largest privately owned office building in the District of Columbia . Current tenants include the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency . As of February 2014 , Constitution Center was worth $ 725 @.@ 8 million , making it the most valuable , taxable property in the city .

 In the 1950s , the U.S. Congress , then the governing institution of the District of Columbia , undertook the Southwest D.C. urban renewal project , the first in the capital district and one of the earliest such programs in the nation . In 1946 , Congress passed the District of Columbia Redevelopment Act , which established the District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency ( RLA ) and provided legal authority to clear land and funds to spur redevelopment in the capital . Congress also gave the National Capital Planning Commission ( NCPC ) the authority to designate which land would be redeveloped , and how . The RLA was not funded , however , until passage of the Housing Act of 1949 . A 1950 study by the NCPC found that the small Southwest quarter of the city suffered from high concentrations of old and poorly maintained buildings , overcrowding , and threats to public health ( such as lack of running indoor water , sewage systems , electricity , central heating , and indoor toilets ) . Competing visions for the redevelopment ranged from renovation to wholesale leveling of neighborhoods , but the latter view prevailed as more likely to qualify for federal funding . Original plans called for the demolition of almost all structures in Southwest Washington beginning in 1950 , but legal challenges led to piecemeal razing of the area until the mid @-@ 1950s . 
 Issues surrounding the planning and construction of L 'Enfant Plaza ( immediately to the west of the site ) delayed construction of any buildings on the block until the late 1960s . In 1963 , the RLA purchased the land from the Westminster Memorial Church , Fifth Baptist Church , and homeowners . The United States Department of Health , Education and Welfare wished to purchase the site for its new headquarters , but the RLA declined to sell the property . ( The federal government does not pay taxes on land and structures it owns , and the RLA wanted a private owner who would add to the tax base . ) The RLA attempted to sell the land on January 29 , 1965 , but there were no buyers . 
 The building was constructed pursuant to an agreement between the General Services Administration ( GSA ) and Boston developer David Nassif , Sr. In July 1965 , President Lyndon B. Johnson began planning to unite various disparate transportation agencies into a new United States Department of Transportation . GSA ( the property owner and manager for the U.S. federal government ) began seeking to lease or build a structure to house the new agency in late 1965 . Donald T. Kirwan , chief of GSA 's leasing division , knew Nassif from a previous lease negotiation , and discussed with him the siting of a building and its size . Nassif approached the RLA on April 21 , 1966 , and asked to buy the newly razed block of land bounded by 6th , 7th , D , and E Streets SW . In May 1967 , GSA sent a letter to Nassif advising him that it was likely to lease the entire structure he intended to build . The $ 5 @.@ 9 million land purchase was finalized on October 30 , 1967 . The cost of the structure is unclear . On November 15 , 1967 , Nassif had secured a $ 39 million construction loan . But The Washington Post pegged the cost of the building at $ 27 million in July 1968 . The newspaper said in August 1970 that the cost of the structure was $ 26 @.@ 5 million . The building was designed by architect Edward Durrell Stone , who also designed the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts . On April 11 , 1968 , GSA leased the entire building from Nassif for 20 years for $ 98 million . John A. Volpe Construction was the chief contractor . 
 Construction began in July 1968 ( although it was delayed for a very short time when unionized ironworkers at the site went on strike ) and was completed in 1969 . The main entrance faced 7th Street SW . It included a central courtyard ( open to the sky ) which featured a fountain , footpaths , benches , and landscaping . Four 15 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) high arcades pierced the building in the center of the block on each side , creating access to the courtyard . The facade 's vertical marble ribs were obtained from the same quarry near Carrara , Italy , that provided the marble for the Kennedy Center . The finished building had 10 floors , three basement floors , overhanging eaves , and 2 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 square feet ( 230 @,@ 000 m2 ) of space ( 1 @,@ 019 @,@ 000 square feet ( 94 @,@ 700 m2 ) of usable space ) . It was the largest privately owned office building in the city at the time . 
 Kirwan 's contacts with Nassif later became the subject of a legal investigation . Kirwan not only shared inside information with Nassif about leasing plans of the GSA , he later invested in Nassif 's D.C. business and became an officer in it . This relationship ( Kirwan left GSA in December 1966 , before the letter indicating intention to lease was set to Nassif ) , and GSA 's irregular leasing of the building , became public knowledge in August 1970 . An internal GSA audit was critical of the leasing process and the costs of the lease . 
 That same month , refinancing of the building was called into question . In the U.S. , it is common business practice for the initial lender to provide an interim loan ( the " construction loan " ) to build a building . The interim loan is then paid off by a second lender , who becomes the mortgage lender and receives payments from the building 's owner . Riggs Bank , a local D.C. bank , had provided the interim construction loan to Nassif . The New York City Employees Retirement System was to have paid off this construction loan . That payment was halted when the loan officer Nassif had dealt with was indicted for taking bribes to approve loans . When the pension fund refused to provide the loan , Riggs Bank sued for payment and threatened to foreclose on the Nassif Building . 
 From 1969 until 2007 , the Nassif Building served as the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Transportation ( DOT ) . The building was designed to have removable interior walls to permit easy reconfiguration of the interior space . In November 1970 , the federal government exercised its powers of eminent domain and seized control of the three @-@ story basement parking garage from Nasif in order to provide inexpensive parking for DOT workers . Over the years , so many government workers complained of ailments while working in the structure that some believed it suffered from sick building syndrome . David Nassif Associates , owner of the building , disputed these claims . However , when the Department of Transportation announced it would leave the building in 2000 , the owners promised a $ 100 million renovation that included a new air ventilation and cleaning system as an inducement for the agency to stay . The owners also unsuccessfully sued the General Services Administration in 1999 to force it to renew the federal lease on the building . The Department of Transportation completed their move out of the Nassif Building and into their new headquarters in June 2007 . 
 The L 'Enfant Plaza Metro station opened an escalator entrance in the structure 's north arcade on July 1 , 1977 . The entrance was one of two which opened that day ( Metro Blue Line 's opening day ) . The third entrance ( inside the L 'Enfant Promenade underground shopping center at L 'Enfant Plaza ) opened in October 1977 . In June 1992 , Virginia Railway Express opened the $ 1 @.@ 1 million VRE L 'Enfant Station on Virginia Avenue SE ( about a half block north of Constitution Center ) . 
 = = Renovation = = 
 In 2006 , Nassif Associates announced a $ 220 million renovation of the building and renamed it " Constitution Center " . <unk> was the architectural firm overseeing the redesign , and Davis Construction oversaw the construction . 
 The renovation included some of the highest security features of any building in the D.C. area . They included a central and perimeter security system ; closing of the central plaza of the building , which , along with other changes , increased its interior footage by 80 @,@ 000 square feet ( 7 @,@ 400 m2 ) ; steel @-@ jacketed underground parking garage columns capable of withstanding a powerful explosion ; six fully staffed security screening points ; concrete blockades built into the façade ; communication , potable water , and utilities contained in blast @-@ proof spaces ; ventilation shafts for the parking garage in a secure area ; and special security procedures to obtain access to the building 's critical systems . The security enhancements made the office building suitable for all federal agencies with the exception of the United States Department of Defense . The 700 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 65 @,@ 000 m2 ) underground parking garage contains 1 @,@ 500 spaces . 
 Several amenities were also added to the building . These included a 10 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 930 m2 ) , 400 @-@ seat auditorium on the courtyard / plaza level ; a six @-@ room , 11 @,@ 000 square feet ( 1 @,@ 000 m2 ) conference center which can accommodate meetings of 10 to 500 people ; a full @-@ service cafeteria on the plaza level , with access to the courtyard ; and a fitness center for 100 people . 
 The exterior of the building was also radically changed . The celebrated key visual feature of the building , its exterior vertical white marble ribbing , was completely removed after it was found to be bowed from age and weather . Although this fundamentally changed the nature of Durrell 's building , there was almost no public outcry . It was replaced by an energy @-@ efficient , all @-@ glass facade . Perhaps the most significant renovation feature was the structure 's use of a chilled beam HVAC system , which uses chilled or heated water circulated in strategically placed columns in the interior space to cool and warm the building . To test the efficiency of the chilled beam technology , the system was installed in the penthouse of the building and tested for a full year . The architect agreed to use the system after the test outperformed specifications . The installation represented the first large @-@ scale use of the chilled beam technology in the United States . Other energy @-@ saving enhancements included motion and daylight detectors to turn lights off when not needed , and special exterior windows which automatically dim to prevent daytime heating . The building 's ventilation system was also upgraded . The renovation left the structure with 1 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 square feet ( 130 @,@ 000 m2 ) of interior space . The final cost of the renovation was pegged at $ 250 million . 
 Some aesthetic improvements were made as well . The building now features a 1 acre ( 0 @.@ 40 ha ) park in its open @-@ to @-@ the @-@ sky central courtyard . Most of the courtyard 's concrete was removed and trees , shrubs , and flowers planted to absorb rainwater . The park , which is now no longer accessible by the public , also includes a very large granite abstract art sculpture ( " Legacy " ) by Richard Deutsch . The sculpture is meant to reflect the original facade of the building by Edward Durrell Stone as well as the memory of David Nassif , Sr. and his son , David Nassif , Jr .. The L 'Enfant Plaza Metro station still has an entrance under the building on D Street SW ( although this entrance closed between October 2007 and July 2008 for the building 's reconstruction ) . The renovation installed artwork by internationally @-@ known artist Stephen Knapp near this entrance , in which strong beams of light are passed through dyed glass to splay brightly colored patterns on the ceiling . The light sculpture , titled " Transformation " , symbolizes the building 's renovation and rebirth . 
 The Constitution Center is registered with the Green Building Council for Gold LEED Certification . 
 The renovated Constitution Center won two awards . The Mid @-@ Atlantic Construction construction news Web site gave the building its " Project of the Year – Renovation / Restoration " accolade in December 2010 . On March 25 , 2011 , the Washington Building Congress bestowed its 2011 WBC Craftsmanship Award on J.E. Richards , Inc. for excellence in workmanship in installing the power generation , distribution , and switchgear at Constitution Center . 
 In January 2011 , Constitution Center was valued at $ 446 million by city tax assessors , making it the third most valuable private property in the city that year . 
 = = Tenants = = 
 The late @-@ 2000s recession left the renovated building struggling to find tenants . It was empty for nearly two years after it was opened for occupancy in April 2009 . Both the United States Department of Homeland Security and NASA explored leasing all or part of it in 2009 and 2010 , but chose not to do so . In August 2010 , the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) signed a letter contract for 900 @,@ 000 square feet ( 84 @,@ 000 m2 ) of space at Constitution Center . The SEC planned to take occupancy in September 2011 . In January 2011 , the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency agreed to lease 640 @,@ 000 square feet ( 59 @,@ 000 m2 ) of space and the Federal Housing Finance Agency signed an agreement to occupy 335 @,@ 000 square feet ( 31 @,@ 100 m2 ) of space . The Office of the Comptroller and the Federal Housing Finance Agency both occupied the building by March 2012 . 
 The SEC 's occupancy of the building did not occur as planned . In October 2010 , the SEC informed Nassif Associates that it needed only 340 @,@ 000 square feet ( 32 @,@ 000 m2 ) of the 900 @,@ 000 square feet ( 84 @,@ 000 m2 ) it had leased . On January 20 , 2011 , the SEC 's inspector general launched an investigation into whether the SEC leased was proper and legal . SEC chairman Mary Schapiro was strongly criticized by Republicans in the United States House of Representatives for her handling of the lease , which she had personally approved . By May , it was unclear if the SEC would occupy any space at all in the building . On May 23 , the SEC inspector general requested a formal opinion by the Comptroller General of the United States as to whether the lease violated the <unk> Act . The inspector general said SEC " grossly overestimated the amount of space needed at SEC Headquarters for the SEC 's projected expansion by more than 300 percent and used these groundless and unsupportable figures to justify the SEC committing to an expenditure of $ 556 @.@ 8 million over 10 years " . 
 In early July 2011 , Nassif Associates said it had agreed to release the SEC from occupying 550 @,@ 000 square feet ( 51 @,@ 000 m2 ) of space at Constitution Center . The company asked the SEC to reimburse it for $ 45 million in build @-@ out and other expenses incurred between August 2010 and July 2011 , but the agency declined to do so . Nassif Associates said it declined to file suit against the agency , although it indicated it would continue to negotiate with the SEC and other federal agencies to seek reimbursement . At the same time , the United States Department of Justice said it was considering whether to prosecute officials at the SEC over the lease 's handling and the alleged forging of documents designed to justify it . 
 Occupancy issues at Constitution Center were further confused by legislative action . In October 2011 , the United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure voted 31 @-@ to @-@ 22 to permit the Federal Trade Commission to lease 160 @,@ 000 square feet ( 15 @,@ 000 m2 ) of space at Constitution Center and vacate the Apex Building ( which would be turned over to the National Gallery of Art ) . Although this legislation was not adopted by Congress , the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in March 2012 directed the General Services Administration ( GSA ) to analyze space needs for the Federal Trade Commission and several other federal agencies in the District of Columbia and issue a report to the committee on how Constitution Center could meet these needs . GSA reported in June 2012 that Constitution Center held too little space to house the entire FTC , and it was too costly to do so ( after accounting for moving expenses and rental prices ) . GSA instead proposed that the FTC lease additional space at 601 New Jersey Avenue NW and 1800 M Street NW ( where it already leased space , and where additional room was available ) . 
 In April 2012 , Nassif Associates said the SEC owed it rent as well . The company said the letter contract required the agency to pay $ 1 @.@ 3 million a month beginning November 1 , 2011 . As of April 30 , 2012 , the agency owed $ 7 @.@ 75 million in back rent , a company spokesperson said . The agency disputed the cost , saying the build @-@ out of the interior was never completed . SEC officials also said the agency now needed no space at all at Constitution Center , and that the SEC was working with GSA to find other federal tenants to take over its lease . In late May , the Federal Aviation Administration said it might lease 270 @,@ 000 square feet ( 25 @,@ 000 m2 ) of space in the building as part of a major consolidation of six of its offices in the city . 
 In July 2012 , GSA bowed to congressional pressure and moved 1 @,@ 100 FTC workers into Constitution Center from leased locations at 601 New Jersey Avenue NW and 1800 M Street NW . The deal kept the FTC in its Apex Building headquarters . Three months later , GSA rented out the last of its space in Constitution Center by signing leases for the National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities .

 On April 22 , 2011 , David Nassif Associates announced it was putting Constitution Center up for sale , and said it hoped to find a buyer by the end of summer 2011 . The company also said it hoped for a $ 900 million purchase price . Real estate banking firm <unk> Secured assisted in securing a buyer . 
 In June 2012 , the Washington Business Journal reported that CommonWealth Partners and Nassif Associates had negotiated a purchase agreement , but were unable to reach agreement . CommonWealth Partners then withdrew from any further discussions . 
 A deal for the sale of Constitution Center was agreed to in December 2012 . MetLife and an unidentified investor ( represented by Clarion Partners LLC ) each purchased a 50 percent interest in the building . The sale price was $ 734 million , or $ 524 per square foot ( 0 @.@ 093 square meters ) . The sale price was the most expensive in D.C. history for a single building . ( It was the most paid per square foot , however . That record went to two @-@ building Market Square at 701 and 801 Pennsylvania Avenue NW , which sold in 2011 to Wells Real Estate Investment Trust for $ 905 per square foot . ) When the deal closed in February 2013 , David Nassif Associates announces it would wind down its operations and liquidate its remaining obligations . 
 City tax assessors said that Constitution Center 's value rose to $ 725 @.@ 8 million in 2014 , up from $ 573 @.@ 5 million in 2013 ( an increase of $ 152 @.@ 3 million ) , making it the most valuable taxable property in the District of Columbia . 
 = Hurricane Neki = 
 Hurricane Neki was the final tropical cyclone of the 2009 Pacific hurricane season . It developed on October 18 as an unusually large disturbance from a trough south of Hawaii . Moving northwestward , it slowly organized at first due to its large size . After reaching hurricane status on October 21 , Neki intensified at a much faster rate and peaked with winds of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) . It later turned to the north and north @-@ northeast and weakened due to hostile conditions . While passing through the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument , Neki was downgraded to a tropical storm after the center became exposed from the deepest convection . It caused little impact in the island chain . After stalling and executing a small loop , Neki resumed its northward track and dissipated on October 27 . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Hurricane Neki were from a surface trough that persisted near the equator in the central Pacific Ocean in the middle of October 2009 . A weak tropical disturbance became evident in the trough on October 15 , and three days later the system began developing curved bands of convection on its northern and southern periphery . This created an unusually large gyre for the region . Following the formation of a well @-@ defined circulation , it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Three @-@ C late on October 18 , about 730 mi ( 1175 km ) south of Ka Lae , Hawaii . 
 Upon developing into a tropical cyclone , the storm was moving west @-@ northwestward , influenced by a ridge to its north . It was located over an area of warm sea surface temperatures and moderate wind shear , which favored gradual intensification . The convection diminished during a diurnal cycle before redeveloping the next day . Maintaining an unusually large size , the depression slowly organized , gradually separating from the trough from which it developed . On October 19 , the CPHC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Neki , and shortly thereafter the storm turned toward the northwest . By the next day , the cyclone resembled the structure of a monsoon depression typically found in the western Pacific Ocean . However , the structure began to more resemble a tropical cyclone after the outermost convection diminished and the thunderstorms around the center increased . Following the development of a banding @-@ eye feature , Neki intensified into a hurricane early on October 21 about 625 mi ( 1010 km ) southwest of Honolulu , Hawaii , or about 335 mi ( 535 km ) east @-@ southeast of Johnston Atoll . 
 After reaching hurricane status , Neki began rapidly intensifying as it turned northward , due to an approaching upper @-@ level trough to its north . An anticyclone aloft provided favorable outflow , which contributed in the strengthening . Early on October 22 , Neki reached its peak winds of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) about 215 mi ( 345 km ) northeast of Johnston Atoll , based on estimates from satellite imagery using the Dvorak technique . Afterward , the trough that influenced the hurricane 's track also began restricting westerly outflow and increasing wind shear , which caused a steady weakening trend . It maintained major hurricane status – a Category 3 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale – for about 24 hours , during which the track turned toward the north @-@ northeast . The weakening and deterioration of the storm 's structure became more marked on October 23 after the thunderstorms failed to persist over the center . 
 While approaching the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument , Neki weakened to tropical storm status . Continued wind shear exposed the circulation from the convection , although further weakening was slow to occur . On October 24 , Neki made its closest approach to land after passing within 13 mi ( 21 km ) of the uninhabited Necker Island . Its forward motion slowed due to a building ridge to the north , causing the storm to execute a small loop . Despite the shear , Neki was initially able to continue developing thunderstorms , although cooler water temperatures resulted in further weakening . The storm resumed its northward motion after the ridge receded to the east , and on October 26 Neki weakened to a tropical depression once the circulation decoupled from the thunderstorms . The next day it dissipated as the center became elongated ahead of an approaching cold front . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Although still a minimal tropical storm at the time , the CPHC anticipated Neki to become a hurricane as it tracked northwestward . As such , they issued a hurricane watch for Johnston Island on the afternoon of October 19 . The following day , the hurricane watch was replaced by a tropical storm watch as Neki was no longer forecast to pass close enough to the island to produce hurricane @-@ force winds . Later that day , a hurricane watch was issued for the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument for areas between the French Frigate Shoals and Lisianski Island . The following morning , a supplementary hurricane warning was issued for the monument for areas between the French Frigate Shoals and Nihoa . Additionally , the tropical storm watch for Johnston Island was discontinued . Early on October 22 , the hurricane watch for Lisianski Island to Marco Reef was replaced by a tropical storm watch . Several hours later , the CPHC discontinued this watch . Early on October 23 , as Neki weakened to a tropical storm , the hurricane warning for areas between the French Frigate Shoals and Nihoa was replaced by a tropical storm warning . The tropical storm warning remained in effect for more than a day before being canceled during the afternoon of October 24 . 
 As the hurricane turned northward and was seen as a threat to the Hawaiian Islands , officials in the <unk> requested that all 17 personnel in the region be evacuated . Several days before the storm passed through the islands , an AC @-@ 130 aircraft was flown to the area and evacuated the people stationed on Tern Island , while a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration vessel evacuated the temporary residents on Laysan Island . Hurricane Neki caused relatively little damage in the <unk> Marine National Monument . All of the structures were undamaged ; however , two small natural habitat islands , Round and Disappearing Islands , were affected substantially . The former lost some land area and the latter was completely washed away . The storm damaged coral reefs in the region , which quickly regrew in the subsequent years . Neki did not affect the state of Hawaii , other than producing high clouds across the region . 
 = Prussian Homage ( painting ) = 
 The Prussian Homage ( Polish : <unk> <unk> ) is an oil on canvas painting by Polish painter Jan Matejko painted between 1879 and 1882 in Kraków ( then part of Austria @-@ Hungary ) . The painting depicts the " Prussian Homage , " a significant political event from the time of the Renaissance in Poland in which Albrecht Hohenzollern , the Duke of Prussia paid tribute and swore allegiance to King Sigismund I the Old in Kraków 's market square on 10 April 1525 . Matejko depicted over thirty important figures of the Polish Renaissance period , taking the liberty of including several who were not actually present at the event . 
 The painting glorifies this event in Poland 's past and its culture , and the majesty of its kings . At the same time , the painting has darker undertones , reflecting the troubled times that befell Poland in the late eighteenth century , for the Kingdom of Prussia would become one of the partitioning powers that ended the independence of Poland . The painting was seen by some as anti @-@ Prussian , foretelling its perceived betrayal of Poland ; others have noted it is also critical of Poland , as Matejko included signs that signify this seemingly triumphant moment was a hollow , wasted victory . Matejko created his painting to remind others about the history of the no @-@ longer @-@ independent country he loved , and about the changing fates of history . The painting is counted among his masterpieces . 
 = = History = = 
 Matejko began to paint the Prussian Homage on Christmas Eve 1879 and finished it in 1882 . He donated it to the Polish nation during the meeting of the Diet of Galicia ( Sejm <unk> ) in Lwów ( Lviv ) on 7 October 1882 to start a collection designed to revive the remodelling of Wawel Castle . It was subsequently exhibited in Kraków , Lwów and Warsaw , as well as in Berlin , Paris , Budapest , and most notably in Rome and Vienna . When it returned to Kraków in 1885 , it was temporarily exhibited in the Sukiennice Museum because the Royal Wawel Castle was occupied at that time by the Austrian army , as Kraków was part of the Austrian partition of Poland . 
 Because of the pro @-@ Polish and anti @-@ Prussian character of the painting German emperor William I objected to a proposal to reward Matejko . During this period , Prussia was trying to suppress Polish culture in its territory and Germanise it . During World War II , the Nazis systematically tried to destroy all Polish cultural artefacts in occupied Poland . This painting , together with Matejko 's painting of the Battle of Grunwald , was on their " most wanted " list . Fortunately it was hidden and safeguarded throughout the war in the town of Zamość . 
 For most of the twentieth and at the beginning of the twentieth @-@ first centuries , the painting has been hung in the National Museum gallery in the Sukiennice Museum in Kraków , where it is usually displayed in the Prussian Homage Hall . 
 Renovation work started in the Sukiennice Museum in June 2008 . The painting previously had been restored in 1915 and 1938 . During World War II it was damaged while it was at Zamość , and in 1945 it was renovated . In 1974 , experts again tried to restore it to its original condition before it went on public exhibition in Moscow . The most recent restoration process took place between 2006 and 2008 , when the painting was finally returned to its former glory . 
 In 2011 , the painting was sent to Germany for an art exhibition entitled " Side by Side Poland – Germany " , which was promoted as part of the 1000 Years of Art and History project of Royal Warsaw Castle in cooperation with the Martin @-@ Gropius @-@ Bau exhibition hall in Berlin . It was on display there between 23 September 2011 and 9 January 2012 . 
 = = Significance = = 
 This painting is considered among Matejko 's most famous works and is also one of his largest canvases . It portrays an event of significant political triumph for Poland , the Prussian Homage , in which Poland was able to enforce its will over Prussia . Prussia latter gained independence and turned against the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth , becoming one of the nations that divided Poland among them . Matejko 's painting was created during the partition period , when independent Poland had ceased to exist , and like many of Matejko 's other works , it aimed to remind the Polish people of their most famous historical triumphs . 
 At the same time , the painting foreshadows the tragedies of the future through the gestures and facial expressions of certain characters . This is visible , for example , in the figures of King Sigismund I the Old and Albrecht Hohenzollern , who is kneeling before him . Sigismund is portrayed as a powerful and majestic figure but not threatening . He treats Albrecht lightly — signifying that this event was only a temporary victory and not a total , lasting domination that crushed his opponent . Albrecht 's character is portrayed with many signs of his villainous intent . He kneels on both knees , which a duke should do only in front of a God , not a sovereign . This implies that he does not see Sigismund as a sovereign . He grips his standard strongly , but touches the Bible only lightly . The standard flies on a military lance , implying that Prussia had further military ambitions . Finally , there is a gauntlet on the ground , an implied challenge to Sigismund from Albrecht . 
 Due to its criticism of Albrecht and the event it portrayed , the painting often is seen as strongly anti @-@ Prussian . While it appears to glorify Poland , it is also critical of the country . Matejko went beyond portraying the glory of a historical event and attempted to convey hints of how the country 's history would play out in the future . This event was merely a hollow victory that failed to secure Poland 's future . Matejko shows that the homage was an empty gesture and that it was Prussia that exploited it rather than Poland . Nobody in the painting is smiling except a lady of the court who is engaged in idle gossip . 
 The painting has been the subject of numerous art historical studies and has been reinterpreted through the works of artists such as Tadeusz Kantor . In 1992 , the <unk> pod <unk> cabaret group organized a historical re @-@ enactment of the painting . 
 = = Historical characters in the painting = = 
 Matejko depicted many important figures of the Polish Renaissance period including taking the liberty to include at least one who were not actually present at the event . In a similar vein , although the event portrayed took place in 1525 , Matejko painted fragments of the Sukiennice in Renaissance style , a form that dates from the year 1555 , after a fire which destroyed the building in its original Gothic style . St. Mary 's Basilica is visible in the background . 
 At the center of the painting , Albrecht , Duke of Prussia is kneeling before King Sigismund I the Old of Poland . Sigismund Augustus is shown here as a 5 @-@ year @-@ old boy wearing a red dress , held up by Piotr Opaliński , the court house tutor . Matejko portrayed Józef Szujski , professor of the Jagiellonian University , as Opaliński . Thirty one other political figures contemporary with the event are also depicted , including : 
 Behind Albrecht , Duke of Prussia are two other German rulers , George , Margrave of Brandenburg @-@ Ansbach and Frederick II of Legnica , who joined <unk> in the homage . 
 In the space between George and Frederick , was Castellan Łukasz II <unk> ( the old , bearded man ) , who was a sympathizer with Prussia . 
 Albrecht 's advisor , Frederic von <unk> is behind the standard , waiting to receive it after the scene is over . 
 The Bishop of Kraków , Piotr <unk> ( wearing a bishop 's mitre ) stands to the right of the King Sigismund . 
 The man holding up a sword is Hieronymus <unk> Łaski , a diplomat and nephew of Archbishop Jan Łaski . Both men are shown to the right of the king , at the top of the crowd . Jan is separated from Hieronymous by Bishop <unk> . Hieronymous is holding the sword with which Albrecht will be knighted stiffly as a warning to the Prussian ruler . 
 Duchess Anna Radziwiłł , ruler of Masovia , appears top left . Historically , the Duchess died in 1522 before the event occurred . However , Matejko included her in the painting to emphasize the connection between Masovia and Poland . 
 Janusz III of Masovia , the last Duke of Masovia of the Piast line . He died at a very young age in 1526 . 
 Hedwig Jagiellon , Electress of Brandenburg , who was daughter of Sigismund I the Old and his first wife Barbara Zápolya . Her parents planned her marriage to Prince Janusz . The death of the Duke ruined her plans . The character was modeled by Matejko 's daughter Beata . She is seen just below Anna Radziwiłł at the top left of the painting . 
 Mauritius Ferber , Bishop of Warmia , and Krzysztof Kreutzer , Prussian diplomat , are engaged in discussion just below and to the left of Hedwig . Ferber appears worried and makes a well @-@ hidden gesture to repel evil ; Kreutzer tries to calm him . 
 Queen Bona Sforza appears center @-@ left . Matejko used his wife Teodora as a model for the Queen . 
 Piotr <unk> <unk> , Grand Marshal of the Crown and governor of Kraków , appears with his right hand raised purportedly a gesture to demand silence and order from the crowd . 
 <unk> Lanckoroński , starost of <unk> , appears on horseback in the lower right of the painting . He is a notable military commander and his figure personifies the still @-@ respectable military prowess of the Commonwealth . 
 The old mustached man in white above Bishop Ferber and to the left of Duchess Anna is Prince Konstanty Ostrogski , Grand Hetman ( top military commander ) of Lithuania , Voivode ( governor ) of Trakai , and Castellan of Vilnius . 
 Located to the right of Prince Ostrogski and wearing a helmet is Jan Amor Tarnowski , the governor of Kraków who would later achieve high military office . This portrait was based on Stanisław Tarnowski , a professor of the Jagiellonian University and literary historian who would publish Matejko 's biography four years after his death . 
 The man taking coins from the tray is Andrzej <unk> , treasurer and Court Marshal who skillfully managed the state finances . Looking proudly , unworried , seeing only victory , he symbolizes the importance and wealth of Polish officials of the period . 
 To the right of the large black figure of Opaliński is Krzysztof <unk> who was one of King Sigismund 's chief advisors in matters of foreign affairs . Holding the globus <unk> , he was one of the main political figures in contemporary Polish and Prussian politics and his worried visage questions the honesty of the ceremony . 
 Hetman Mikołaj Firlej , Castellan of Kraków , is located between Krzysztof <unk> and Andrzej Tęczyński . One of many characters with a worried expression , Firlej , a respected military leader , is likely considering the possibility of Prussia growing into a military power . 
 Andrzej Tęczyński , Ensign of Kraków , who later became Castellan of Kraków , appears holding the banner in the top right corner . He is having difficulty holding the Polish flag unfolded , which once again foreshadows the troubles ahead . 
 Albrecht <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and voivode of Vilnius , is barely visible in the top right of the painting . His presence in the painting is intended to symbolize the wisdom of the king as a legislator . 
 Below the king sits Stańczyk . His worried face shows doubt that the homage will mean victory in the long run , and he is making a gesture to repel bad luck . 
 In the lower @-@ left corner of the painting holding a document bearing the royal seal , stands Bartolommeo Berrecci , architect who rebuilt Royal Wawel Castle . Next to him is Seweryn Boner , an important burgher and banker . His face is one of the two self @-@ portraits of Jan Matejko . The second is the face of the royal jester Stańczyk . As Berrecci , Matejko portrayed himself as a gray eminence , dominating the scene , with a royal scepter in his hand .

 Some generic characters of minor importance were also depicted by Matejko in the painting . The following personages are : 
 An old Teutonic soldier is shown under Hedwig ; he signifies the end of the Teutonic Order . 
 Underneath the soldier at the bottom of the painting , an executor or a city guard keeps watch on the crowd , ensuring no unrest will disrupt the proceedings . 
 At the top of the painting , a dove symbolizing peace can be seen .
