 In 2005 , a meme known as the " duckroll " began , after Poole used a word filter to change " egg " to " duck " across 4chan . Thus , words such as " <unk> " were changed to " duckroll " . This led to a bait @-@ and @-@ switch in which external links disguised as relevant to a discussion instead led to a picture of a duck on wheels . 
 An unidentified 4chan user applied the concept of the duckroll to a 2007 post relating to the video game Grand Theft Auto IV . In March of that year , the game 's trailer had been released , and the game 's immense popularity caused publisher Rockstar Games ' website to crash . The user posted a YouTube link that purportedly led to the trailer , but in reality directed users the music video for Rick Astley 's 1987 song " Never Gonna Give You Up " . Thus , the " <unk> " was born . In an interview with the Los Angeles Times , Astley said he found the meme " bizarre and funny " .

 A link to the YouTube video of Tay Zonday 's song " Chocolate Rain " was posted on / b / on July 11 , 2007 . The Age reported that 4chan posters urged each other to " swarm " the video on YouTube and thus increase its ranking . The video became an immensely popular Internet meme , resulting in cover versions by John Mayer and Green Day drummer Tré Cool . The portion of the song in which Zonday turns away from the microphone , with a caption stating " I move away from the mic to breathe in " , became an oft @-@ repeated meme on 4chan and inspired remixes .

 The character of <unk> is portrayed by Catherine " Catie " Wayne , an American Internet celebrity known for her highly energetic vlogs . Her rise to exposure began in late 2008 and early 2009 , surrounding self @-@ made videos that were initially made to be posted to her Gaia Online profile . They then spread to 4chan and other sites , resulting in a large online following .

 In his American incarnation , Pedobear is an anthropomorphic bear child predator that is often used within the community to mock contributors showing a sexual interest in children . Pedobear is one of the most popular memes on non @-@ English imageboards , and has gained recognition across Europe . In February 2010 , a photoshopped version of Pedobear appeared along with mascots of the 2010 Winter Olympics in an article on the games in Gazeta <unk> , a Polish newspaper . This was done accidentally ; due to the image being used from Google Images , the authors were unaware of the joke . Similarly , the Dutch television guide <unk> used one of the images . It has been used as a symbol of pedophilia by Maltese graffiti vandals prior to a papal visit .

 On July 30 , 2014 , an anonymous user made a reply in a thread on the board / pol / " Politically Incorrect " of 4chan , criticizing modern art in an ironic fashion , saying 
 Art used to be something to cherish 
 Now literally anything could be art 
 This post is art . 
 Less than an hour later the post was photographed off the screen and framed by another user who posted another reply in the thread with a photo of the framed quote . Later the user , after endorsement by other anonymous users in the thread , created an auction on eBay for the framed photo which quickly rose to high prices , culminating in a price of $ 90 @,@ 900 @.@ 00 .

 On February 15 , 2009 , a user uploaded two YouTube videos that showed the physical abuse of a domestic cat named Dusty by a person calling himself " Timmy . " The 4chan community was able to track down the originator of the videos , a fourteen @-@ year @-@ old from Lawton , Oklahoma , and passed his details to his local police department . As a result of this , a suspect was arrested and the cat was treated by a veterinarian and taken to a safe place .

 According to the Washington Post , " the site 's users have managed to pull off some of the highest @-@ profile collective actions in the history of the Internet . " 
 Users of 4chan and other websites " raided " Hal Turner by launching DDoS attacks and prank calling his phone @-@ in radio show during December 2006 and January 2007 . The attacks caused Turner 's website to go offline . This cost thousands of dollars of bandwidth bills according to Turner . In response , Turner sued 4chan , <unk> , and other websites ; however , he lost his plea for an injunction and failed to receive letters from the court . 
 KTTV Fox 11 aired a report on Anonymous , calling them a group of " hackers on steroids " , " domestic terrorists " , and collectively an " Internet hate machine " on July 26 , 2007 . Slashdot founder Rob Malda posted a comment made by another Slashdot user , Miang , stating that the story focused mainly on users of " 4chan , <unk> and <unk> " . Miang claimed that the report " seems to confuse / b / raids and motivational poster templates with a genuine threat to the American public " , arguing that the " unrelated " footage of a van exploding shown in the report was to " equate anonymous posting with domestic terror " . 
 On July 10 , 2008 , the swastika CJK <unk> character ( <unk> ) appeared at the top of Google 's Hot Trends list — a tally of the most popular search terms in the United States — for several hours . It was later reported that the HTML numeric character reference for the symbol had been posted on / b / , with a request to perform a Google search for the string . A multitude of / b / visitors followed the order and pushed the symbol to the top of the chart , though Google later removed the result . 
 Later that year , the private Yahoo ! Mail account of Sarah Palin , Republican vice presidential candidate in the 2008 United States presidential election , was hacked by a 4chan user . This followed criticism of Palin and other politicians supposedly using private email accounts for governmental work . The hacker posted the account 's password on / b / , and screenshots from within the account to Wikileaks . A / b / user then logged in and changed the password , posting a screenshot of his sending an email to a friend of Palin 's informing her of the new password on the / b / thread . However , he forgot to blank out the password in the screenshot . A multitude of / b / users attempted to log in with the new password , and the account was automatically locked out by Yahoo ! . The incident was criticized by some / b / users , in that most reports on the hack focused on 4chan , rather than Palin 's violation of campaign law . One user commented , " seriously , / b / . We could have changed history and failed , epically . " The FBI and Secret Service began investigating the incident shortly after its occurrence . On September 20 it was revealed they were questioning David Kernell , the son of Democratic Tennessee State Representative Mike Kernell . 
 The stock price of Apple Inc. fell significantly in October 2008 after a hoax story was submitted to CNN 's user @-@ generated news site <unk> claiming that company CEO Steve Jobs had suffered a major heart attack . The source of the story was traced back to 4chan . 
 In May 2009 , members of the site attacked YouTube , posting pornographic videos on the site . A 4chan member acknowledged being part of the attack , telling the BBC that it was in response to YouTube " deleting music " . In January 2010 , members of the site attacked YouTube again in response to the suspension of YouTube user <unk> for failing to meet the minimum age requirement of thirteen . The videos uploaded by the user had apparently become popular with 4chan members , who subsequently became angered after the account was suspended and called for a new wave of pornographic videos to be uploaded to YouTube on January 6 , 2010 . Later the same year , 4chan made numerous disruptive pranks directed at singer Justin Bieber . 
 In September 2010 , in retaliation against the Bollywood film industry 's hiring of Aiplex Software to launch cyberattacks against The Pirate Bay , Anonymous members , recruited through posts on 4chan boards , subsequently initiated their own attacks , dubbed Operation Payback , targeting the website of the Motion Picture Association of America and the Recording Industry Association of America . The targeted websites usually went offline for a short period of time due to the attacks , before recovering . 
 The website of the UK law firm ACS : Law , which was associated with an anti @-@ piracy client , was affected by the cyber @-@ attack . In retaliation for the initial attacks being called only a minor nuisance , Anonymous launched more attacks , bringing the site down yet again . After coming back up , the front page accidentally revealed a backup file of the entire website , which contained over 300 megabytes of private company emails , which were leaked to several torrents and across several sites on the Internet . It has been suggested that the data leak could cost the law firm up to £ 500 @,@ 000 in fines for breaching British Data Protection Laws . In January 2011 , BBC News reported that the law firm have announced they are to stop " chasing illegal file @-@ sharers " . Head of ACS : Law Andrew Crossley in a statement to a court addressed issues which influenced the decision to back down " I have ceased my work ... I have been subject to criminal attack . My e @-@ mails have been hacked . I have had death threats and bomb threats . " 
 In August 2012 , 4chan users attacked a third @-@ party sponsored Mountain Dew campaign , Dub the Dew , where users were asked to submit and vote on name ideas for a green apple flavor of the drink . Users submitted entries such as " <unk> " , " <unk> " , several variations of " <unk> Granny " , and " Hitler did nothing wrong " .

 On October 18 , 2006 , the Department of Homeland Security warned National Football League officials in Miami , New York City , Atlanta , Seattle , Houston , Oakland , and Cleveland about a possible threat involving the simultaneous use of dirty bombs at stadiums . The threat claimed that the attack would be carried out on October 22 , the final day of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan . Both the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security expressed doubt concerning the credibility of the threats , but warned the relevant organizations as a precaution . The games proceeded as planned but under a higher level of security awareness . The threats came to light in the national media after Jake Brahm admitted to having posted the threats on 4chan and repeating them on other websites approximately 40 times . 
 Brahm did not expect the message to be taken seriously since he " would never take anything posted on 4chan as fact " ; an FBI official was quoted as saying the " credibility of [ the threat ] was beyond ridiculous " . As a parody of the incident , 4chan temporarily added " Don 't mess with football " as an additional rule for / b / . On October 20 , 2006 , Brahm turned himself in to federal authorities , and was charged with fabricating a fake terrorist threat and taken into custody . On February 28 , 2008 , he pleaded guilty to the federal charges . On June 5 , 2008 , he was sentenced to six months in prison , six months ' house arrest , and ordered to pay $ 26 @,@ 750 in restitution . 
 Around midnight on September 11 , 2007 , a student posted photographs of mock pipe bombs and another photograph of him holding them while saying he would blow up his high school — Pflugerville High School in Pflugerville , Texas — at 9 : 11 am on September 11 . Users of 4chan helped to track him down by finding the perpetrator 's father 's name in the <unk> data of a photograph he took , and contacted the police . He was arrested before school began that day . The incident turned out to be a hoax ; the " weapons " were toys and there were no actual bombs . 
 Jarrad Willis , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old from Melbourne , Australia was arrested on December 8 , 2007 , after apparently posting on 4chan that he was " going to shoot and kill as many people as I can until which time I am incapacitated or killed by the police " . The post , accompanied by an image of another man holding a shotgun , threatened a shopping mall near Beverly Hills . While the investigation was still open , Willis was charged with criminal defamation for a separate incident but died before the case was heard . 
 On February 4 , 2009 , a posting on the 4chan / b / board said there would be a school shooting at St <unk> Gymnasium in <unk> , Sweden , leading 1250 students and 50 teachers to be evacuated . A 21 @-@ year @-@ old man was arrested after 4chan provided the police with the IP address of the poster . Police said that the suspect called it off as a joke , and they released him after they found no indication that the threat was serious . 
 On January 21 , 2014 , an anonymous poster started a thread on / b / identifying a student named Westley Sullivan who apparently went to the same high school as the poster . The original post included a link to Westley Sullivan 's Facebook profile , which has since been taken down , and a screenshot of a post which said " if <unk> <unk> closed tomorrow im going to blow it up " , referring to Sullivan 's high school , Fairview High School , in Fairview , Kentucky . A few anonymous individuals went to Sullivan 's Facebook profile and found his address , phone number , school ID number , school schedule and teachers , and other personal information . Information like his teachers and ID number had been posted directly , and the more personal information like his address was found in the <unk> data of some of the pictures posted on his profile . These individuals then contacted Fairview school officials and the local police department , as well as the FBI . The next day it was learned that police had arrested Sullivan in his home and he had been charged with 2nd degree terroristic threatening , a Class D felony in Kentucky .

 On July 26 , 2009 , AT & T 's DSL branch temporarily blocked access to the <unk> domain ( host of / b / and / r9k / ) , which was initially believed to be an attempt at Internet censorship , and met with hostility on 4chan 's part . The next day , AT & T issued a statement claiming that the block was put in place after an AT & T customer was affected by a DoS attack originating from IP addresses connected to <unk> , and was an attempt to " prevent this attack from disrupting service for the impacted AT & T customer , and ... our other customers . " AT & T maintains that the block was not related to the content on 4chan . 
 4chan 's founder Christopher Poole responded with the following : 
 In the end , this wasn 't a sinister act of censorship , but rather a bit of a mistake and a poorly executed , disproportionate response on AT & T 's part . Whoever pulled the trigger on <unk> the site probably didn 't anticipate [ nor intend ] the consequences of doing so . We 're glad to see this short @-@ lived debacle has prompted renewed interest and debate over net neutrality and Internet censorship — two very important issues that don 't get nearly enough attention — so perhaps this was all just a blessing in disguise .

Three days later , Verizon Wireless confirmed that 4chan was " explicitly blocked " . The block was lifted several days later . 
 = Litchfield Towers = 
 Litchfield Towers , commonly referred to on campus as " Towers " , is a complex of dormitories at the University of Pittsburgh 's main campus in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . Litchfield Towers is both the largest and tallest dormitory at the University of Pittsburgh , housing approximately 1 @,@ 850 students . 
 Designed by the architectural firm of <unk> & Ritchey , the complex was completed in 1963 and was named for former chancellor Edward Litchfield following his death in an airplane crash in 1968 . The complex consists of three towers , which during construction were designated A , B , and C in the architectural plans . The names stuck after the towers were completed , and the towers are still so named today . 
 Towers A , B , and C house mostly first @-@ year freshmen . The towers are all of different heights , and differ slightly in their living accommodations . Tower B is the tallest of the three , at 22 stories . Tower A is 19 stories tall , and Tower C is 16 stories in height . Rooms in Towers A and B are the same size , roughly 17 ft ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) by 11 ft ( 3 @.@ 4 m ) . These measurements are not exact , however , because the three towers are cylindrical in shape ( although actually twenty @-@ sided ) and the rooms themselves are therefore somewhat trapezoidal . 
 = = History = = 
 The original proposal for the " unusual skyscraper dormitory " complex , designed by Dahlen Ritchey of the architectural firm of <unk> & Ritchey , was unveiled in June , 1960 and called for three towers to contain living quarters with unobstructed views for 1 @,@ 868 male students . The towers were preliminarily designated as A , B , and C , with undergraduates to occupy tower A and B and graduate students tower C. The towers would rise from a three story base that included a dining room accommodating 14 @,@ 000 students , serving men from the towers and women from the nearby Schenley Quadrangle residences , as well a parking garage in its bottom level . Construction was initially delayed a year due to perceived high expense , but the dormitories opened in September , 1963 at a cost of $ 14 million with initially 1 @,@ 150 residents filling approximately two @-@ thirds of the spaces . 
 The reference to the three towers as A , B , and C , which originated in their designs , remains to this day , although from their inception , the towers have been designated with unofficial nicknames reflecting the similarity of their shape to the canister packaging of the coinciding to the commercial cleansing products Ajax , Bab @-@ O , and Comet . Due to the obscurity of Bab @-@ O cleanser in more recent years , Tower B has often been referred to by the nicknames Bon Ami and Bounty . 
 Collectively , the dorms were at first simply referred to by the university as the Tower Residence Halls . In 1971 , the university formally named the complex Litchfield Towers in honor of Edward Litchfield who had served as Pitt 's chancellor during their construction and subsequently died in a tragic 1968 airplane crash . 
 = = Towers A and B = = 
 Towers A and B are very similar to each other . All rooms in both towers are doubles , meaning that two people share each room . There is a lounge the size of three dorm rooms every third floor , containing a large television and several couches and tables for studying . Communal and university @-@ sponsored events frequently take place in the various lounges throughout the towers . Every floor shares a communal bathroom , with several shower and restroom stalls . Each floor has twenty rooms , except for the lounge floors , which only have seventeen . Each floor 's resident assistant lives alone in their respective room , meaning each floor houses 39 people . On the ground floor of Tower A there is a small fitness center containing treadmills , ellipticals , bikes , and weight equipment . A fully functioning post office and all student mailboxes are located on the ground floor of Tower B. Due to the fact that both Towers A and B are exclusively residences for first year students , they are both designated as alcohol @-@ free . Its distribution , sale , and consumption , is punished if discovered . 
 Previously , there had been several specialized student communities in Litchfield Towers which are set aside by the university , although they have since moved to other on @-@ campus housing spaces . Students Pursuing Academics and Careers in Engineering , commonly referred to as the " SPACE " floors , was located on floors 8 through 11 of Tower A until it was moved to Forbes Hall in 2011 . The University Honors College first @-@ year Living Learning Community was housed on floors 11 and 12 of Tower B prior to 2005 , and then on floors 11 through 14 after 2005 , and the University of Pittsburgh College of Business Administration Living Learning Community is located on floors 9 and 10 of Tower B. After the 2006 @-@ 2007 school year , The University Honors College First @-@ Year Honors Community was moved to Forbes Hall until 2011 when it moved to Sutherland Hall , while the College of Business Administration Living Learning Community was moved directly to Sutherland Hall in 2007 . 
 = = Tower C = = 
 Tower C is different from Towers A and B in several ways , but primarily in the fact that its rooms are single occupancy . The rooms are 2 / 3 the size of rooms in Towers A and B , and like Tower A and Tower B , every third floor has a lounge containing a television , couches , and tables for extra study . In addition , each floor has 30 rooms , except floors containing a lounge , which have 27 . No official specialized student communities are housed in Tower C , but designated male and female floors are 24 @-@ hour Quiet Living Communities . Up until 2010 @-@ 11 , Tower C was open to students of any year , however it now houses primarily first @-@ year students .

 Panther Central is the center for most basic student services . Some of these services include issuing of student ID cards , replacement of lost ID cards , verifying residential status for students with forgotten ID cards , dispensing of general information , placing maintenance requests for rooms , and other such services . 
 = = = Dining services = = = 
 Until the 2007 academic year , the ground floor of the Litchfield towers complex housed two University dining facilities , both run by the French food service conglomerate Sodexo . " The Marketplace " ( formerly known as C @-@ Side ) was an all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ eat buffet serving traditional foods such as pastas and salad . The menu changed throughout the day , starting with breakfast foods such as waffles and cereal and ending with dinner dishes such as lasagna . The other , " Eddie 's " , was structured more like a food court , with several stand @-@ alone food shops serving such foods as sandwiches , chicken , and hamburgers . Eddie 's also contained a small grocery store mainly selling snack foods and pre @-@ packaged dinners . The grocery store offered a small selection of kosher foods . The small shop in the lobby of Towers , " Common Grounds " , which sells coffee , juice , bagels , and various other baked goods still remains . 
 For the fall of 2007 , the Litchfield Tower dining facilities were completely remodeled . The newly renovated dining hall has been named " Market Central " , and contains six new all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ eat venues and two takeout areas ( " Market @-@ To @-@ Go " and " Quick Zone " ) . Often referred to as just " Market " by campus residents , Market Central 's venues offer a great deal of variety . The Flying S @-@ T @-@ A @-@ R Diner , for example , offers around @-@ the @-@ clock breakfast while Magellan 's serves up food from around the world such as <unk> and other ethnic specialties . Upon entering , students present their campus IDs to gain access to all six venues for their entire duration in the facility . Meal passes or dining dollars can be used for admittance . In 2013 , renovations to Market Central included doubling the size of the Quick Zone and the addition of " Towers Treats " ice cream and dessert booth . 
 = = = Security = = = 
 Although Panther Central , the Towers Lobby which connects all three towers , and the dining services located on the ground floor are accessible to everyone , only residents are allowed in the individual towers and must present their student ID card to a 24 @-@ hour security guard to gain entrance . Visitors to any of the Towers must be signed in by a resident of the Tower , and must present either their student ID card if they are a student or a valid form of photographic identification if they are not . Guests signed in by residents must be signed out and leave the Tower by 2 : 00 AM . If not , an overnight stay request must be completed , of which a student can only file a certain number each academic semester . No resident is permitted to sign in more than three people at one time . 
 During the designated moving @-@ in / moving @-@ out periods at the beginning and end of semesters , the elevators in all three Towers can access the basement garage , allowing students and visitors the ability to travel freely between Towers . 
 = 1995 Gulf of Aqaba earthquake = 
 The 1995 Gulf of Aqaba earthquake ( also known as Nuweiba earthquake ) occurred on November 22 at 06 : 15 local time ( 04 : 15 UTC ) and registered 7 @.@ 3 on the moment magnitude scale . The epicenter was located in the central segment of the Gulf of Aqaba , the narrow body of water that separates Egypt 's Sinai Peninsula from the western border of Saudi Arabia . At least 8 people were killed and 30 were injured in the <unk> area . 
 The earthquake occurred along the Dead Sea Transform ( DST ) fault system , an active tectonic plate boundary with seismicity that is characterized by long @-@ running quiescent periods with occasional large and damaging earthquakes , along with intermittent earthquake swarms . It was the strongest tectonic event in the area for many decades and caused injuries , damage , and deaths throughout the Levant and is also thought to have remotely triggered a series of small to moderate earthquakes 500 kilometers ( 310 mi ) to the north of the epicenter . In the aftermath of the quake , several field investigations set out to determine the extent of any surface faulting , and the distribution of aftershocks was analyzed . 
 = = Tectonic setting = = 
 The Gulf of Aqaba is situated along the southern portion of the Dead Sea Transform ( DST ) fault zone , a 1 @,@ 000 km ( 620 mi ) transform fault that forms the barrier between the African plate and the Arabian Plate ( Arabian @-@ Nubian Shield ) . The left @-@ lateral strike @-@ slip fault connects the spreading center that forms the Red Sea in the south with the East Anatolian Fault in Turkey in the north . Although there is much that is not known about the DST , it is accepted that its transform motion began around 12 – 18 million years ago . Geologist A. M. Quennell , who is credited with first recognizing the movement along the fault in 1958 , estimated the total displacement to be 107 kilometers ( 66 mi ) while a similar study that included more regional influences resulted in an estimated slip of 100 kilometers ( 62 mi ) . That broader kinematic model translates into a slip rate of 8 – 10 mm / year for the portion of the fault south of the Dead Sea . 
 Along the length of the Dead Sea Transform ( also known as the Levantine fault ) there are several pull @-@ apart basins that have resulted in the formation of the Dead Sea as well as the Gulf of Aqaba . The 180 km ( 110 mi ) gulf comprises three distinct pull @-@ apart basins that were formed by individual segments of the fault and are known as ( from north to south ) the Elat Deep , Aragonese Deep , and the Dakar Deep . At 25 km ( 16 mi ) wide , the gulf is relatively narrow , but is up to 1 @,@ 800 meters ( 5 @,@ 900 ft ) deep , with the nearby mountains near 2 @,@ 600 meters ( 8 @,@ 500 ft ) in height . This difference in elevation suggests that the tectonic activity outpaces the erosive processes in the area , but the background seismicity is infrequent and is marked by earthquake swarms . 
 = = Stress triggering = = 
 The earthquake was the largest event to occur on along the DST during the 20th century and was felt up to 600 km ( 370 mi ) away . The period of aftershocks carried on for over a year with many exceeding magnitude 5 . Within several hours of the mainshock a number of small earthquakes occurred along the DST 500 km ( 310 mi ) north of the epicenter . Analysis of these earthquakes suggest that they may have been remotely triggered by the Gulf of Aqaba mainshock . Much attention has been given to remotely triggered earthquakes since the 1992 Landers earthquake in southern California . 
 The Dead Sea fault system runs from the Red Sea north to a triple junction in south @-@ central Turkey and consists of a main fault and several secondary faults . The fault system is at its widest and deepest in the gulf where a transition from proto @-@ oceanic rifting to transform faulting occurs . Moving northward through Lebanon and Syria , where the DST is known as the <unk> fault , the trace follows a restraining bend and splits into several strands that include the <unk> and <unk> faults . These strands are believed to be the source of the Near East earthquakes of 1759 . The increased seismic activity following the Aqaba earthquake was detected by the Syrian National Seismic Network ( <unk> ) and occurred in the area of the <unk> and <unk> faults within a 25 km × 25 km ( 16 mi × 16 mi ) area near the restraining bend in southwest Syria . The <unk> consists of twenty vertical @-@ component seismometers , but only nine instruments recorded the swarm . 
 This small area in southwest Syria situated 500 km north of the Gulf of Aqaba mainshock had almost no activity during the two previous months then , beginning two hours and 47 minutes after the event , a swarm of 21 small earthquakes occurred . The average background seismicity was .5 to 1 events per day preceding November 22 , and during the swarm 21 small earthquakes with a peak magnitude of ( Md = 3 @.@ 7 ) were recorded in three and a half hours . Randa Mohamad ( from the Syrian National Seismological Center ) and other seismologists determined that the abrupt increase of activity was due to remote earthquake triggering from the Gulf of Aqaba mainshock , and reported the results of their investigation in a journal published by the Seismological Society of America . 
 = = Damage = = 
 The epicenter was located 60 kilometers ( 37 mi ) south of the head of the Gulf of Aqaba where the countries of Egypt , Israel , Jordan , and Saudi Arabia converge . Damage to buildings occurred in the coastal cities of Eilat , Israel and Aqaba , Jordan and a small tsunami was observed by witnesses there . Farther down the coast and closer to the epicenter in the Egyptian city of Nuweiba several well @-@ built , modern , concrete reinforced homes were completely destroyed . 
 The earthquake 's effects were felt as far north as Lebanon and Syria and it was the strongest event in the Jordan Rift Valley since the 1927 Jericho earthquake which was centered near the Dead Sea . The heaviest damage occurred in the resort town of Eilat where seven hotels and 50 other buildings were damaged , and cracks formed in the sidewalks . Fifteen people were treated there for injuries or shock and one man died of a heart attack in Aqaba . In Saudi Arabia two women were reported dead and five deaths were reported in Egypt , with three of them occurring in the gulf resort town of Nuweiba . Eight buildings collapsed in Cairo where , just several years before , the much smaller 1992 Cairo earthquake had a much more destructive impact . One person was killed and two were injured slightly at Al @-@ Bad ' , Saudi Arabia and damage was reported there as well as the towns of <unk> and <unk> .

 The Gulf of Aqaba lies between the Sinai Peninsula and the Arabian Peninsula , both mostly desert regions with very few permanent settlements . The seismologists who work with historical events gather <unk> data from written records from cities that may not have been anywhere near the epicentral area . This can result in the <unk> of events when significant damage was reported in a particular location which were not actually where the earthquake occurred . The records of these events have been influenced by the distribution of the population ( where the people were ) and this has caused difficulty in creating a complete and accurate index of historical events . Several studies in the 80s and 90s indicate that there were two or possibly three large earthquakes in the region in the last 2000 years with magnitudes estimated to be 6 @.@ 5 – 7 @.@ 0 based on <unk> data . 
 The countries surrounding the gulf have been actively monitoring the seismicity there since the 1980s and have found a consistent low level of activity , but a primary characteristic of the activity is that there are multiple sequences of earthquake swarms . Three swarm events , beginning in the north and ending in the south gulf , have been observed beginning in 1983 when more than 1 @,@ 000 events occurred over a three @-@ month period near the northeastern boundary of the Elat Deep ( in the northern gulf ) with the largest three events approaching 5 on the Richter magnitude scale . A less pronounced swarm occurred in 1990 with the largest event reaching 4 @.@ 3 in the central gulf near the Elat Deep and the <unk> Deep . The last significant swarm happened in 1993 in the southwestern <unk> Deep ( in the southern gulf ) with the highest magnitude of 6 @.@ 1 and more than 300 larger than magnitude 3 in the following weeks .

 During several independent field studies cracks and other ground deformations were observed on both the Egyptian and Saudi Arabian sides of the gulf . During a field survey that was done there in 1996 , a series of cracks were discovered between 28 ° 35 ' N and 29 ° 05 ' N on the Saudi Arabian coast . A field investigation was also done in Egypt in 1996 by seismologist Yann Klinger and others along with the Egyptian Geological Survey and Mining Authority . The most dramatic ground ruptures found were north of Nuweiba along a coastal road . 
 The countries surrounding the gulf ( Egypt , Israel , Jordan , and Saudi Arabia ) operate their own seismic networks and during the months that followed the main event , fourteen temporary and permanent stations recorded thousands of aftershocks . Klinger acquired data on approximately 1 @,@ 000 aftershocks via the European @-@ Mediterranean Seismological Center and the agencies of each country . The data was filtered to include only those aftershocks within 150 km ( 93 mi ) of the epicenter . Data from four stations from the Institute for Petroleum Research and Geophysics of Israel plus seven stations from Jordan 's Natural Resource Authority recorded aftershocks in the epicentral area that met the restriction . It was found that the aftershocks were arranged with a north @-@ south alignment over a length of 70 km ( 43 mi ) and that was expected from an earthquake of such magnitude . The group of aftershocks were bunched in two distinct clusters , with one in the north and one further south .

 Vampire : The Masquerade – Redemption is a 2000 role @-@ playing video game developed by Nihilistic Software and released by Activision for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS . Set in White Wolf Publishing 's World of Darkness , the game is based on White Wolf 's role @-@ playing game Vampire : The Masquerade and follows the adventures of Christof Romuald , a 12th @-@ century French crusader who is killed and subsequently revived as a Vampire . The game depicts Christof 's centuries @-@ long journey from the Dark Ages of 12th century Prague and Vienna to modern @-@ day London and New York City in search of his humanity and his kidnapped love , the nun Anezka . 
 Redemption is presented in the first- and third @-@ person perspectives . The player controls Christof and up to three allies through a linear structure , providing the player with missions to progress through a set narrative . Certain actions committed by Christof throughout the game can raise or lower his humanity , affecting which of the game 's three endings the player receives . As a Vampire , Christof is imbued with a variety of abilities and powers that can be used to combat or avoid enemies and obstacles . Use of these abilities drains Christof 's supply of blood which can be replenished by drinking from enemies or innocents . It includes multiplayer gameplay called " Storyteller " , which allows one player to create a narrative for a group of players with the ability to modify the game dynamically in reaction to the players ' actions . 
 Founded in March 1998 , Nihilistic 's twelve @-@ man team began development of Redemption the following month as their first game . It took the team twenty @-@ four months to complete on a budget of US $ 1 @.@ 8 million . The team relied on eight outside contractors to provide elements that the team could not supply , such as music and artwork . The game 's development was difficult : late changes to software forced the developers to abandon completed code and assets ; a focus on high @-@ quality graphics and sound meant that the game ran poorly on some computer systems ; and the original scope of the game exceeded the game 's schedule and budget , forcing the team to cancel planned features . 
 The game received a mixed critical response ; reviewers praised its graphics and its multiplayer functionality , but were polarized by the quality of the story and combat . It received the 1999 Game Critics Awards for Best Role @-@ Playing game . Redemption was released for Microsoft Windows on June 7 , 2000 , with a Mac OS version following in November 2001 . It was successful enough to merit the production of a sequel , Vampire : The Masquerade – Bloodlines , which was released in November 2004 as an indirect sequel set in the same fictional universe . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Vampire : The Masquerade – Redemption — shortened to Redemption — is a role @-@ playing game ( RPG ) presented primarily from the third @-@ person perspective ; the playable character is shown on the screen while an optional first @-@ person mode used to view the character 's immediate environment is available . The camera can be freely rotated around the character and positioned above it to give a greater overview of the immediate area . The game follows a linear , mission @-@ based structure . Interaction is achieved by using a mouse to click on an enemy or environmental object to attack it or to activate it . Interaction is context based ; clicking on an enemy initiates combat , while clicking on a door causes it to open or close . 
 The playable character can lead a group of three additional allies into battle , controlling their actions to attack a single enemy or to use specific powers . Characters can be set to one of three modes : defensive , neutral , or offensive . In defensive mode , the character remains distant from battles , while offensive mode sends the character directly into battle . The main character and active allies are represented by portraits on screen that reflect their current physical or emotional state , showing sadness , anger , feeding , or the presence of injuries or staking — having been stabbed through the heart and rendered immobile . 
 The player can access various long @-@ range and melee weapons including swords , shields , bows , and guns , stakes , and holy water . Some weapons have a secondary , more powerful attack ; for example a sword can be spun to decapitate a foe . Because they are vampires , allies and enemies are susceptible to damage from sunlight . Disciplines ( vampiric powers ) are used to supplement physical attacks . Each discipline can be upgraded , becoming a more powerful version of itself ; alternatively , other in @-@ game benefits can be gained . The game features disciplines that allow the player to enhance the character 's physical abilities such as speed , strength , or durability . Disciplines can also allow the player to <unk> an enemy or a potential feeding victim , render the character invisible to escape detection , turn the character into mist , summon serpents to attack enemies , heal , revive their allies , and teleport to a haven . Each discipline can be upgraded up to five times , affecting the abilities ' durations , the scale of the damage or their effect , and the cost of using it . The characters ' health and disciplines are reliant on blood , which can only be replenished by feeding on the living — including other party members — or finding blood containers such as bottles and plasma bags . Drinking an innocent to death and other negative actions reduces the player 's humanity , increasing the likelihood of entering a frenzy when injured or low on blood , during which they indiscriminately attack friend and foe . 
 Completing objectives and defeating enemies is rewarded with experience points , which are used to unlock or upgrade existing disciplines and improve each characters ' statistics , such as strength or agility . Weapons , armor , and other accessories can be purchased or upgraded using money or valuable items , which are collected throughout the game . The character 's inventory is grid @-@ based ; objects occupy an allotted amount of space , requiring the management of the storage space available . A belt allows some items to be selected for immediate use during gameplay , such as healing items , without the need to access them in the main inventory . The first version of the game allows progress to be saved only in the main character 's haven or safehouse ; it automatically saves other data at specific points . An update to the game enabled players to save their in @-@ game data at any point in the in @-@ game narrative . 
 Redemption features an online multiplayer component which allows players to engage in scenarios together . One player assumes the role of the Storyteller , guiding other players through a scenario using the Storyteller interface . The interface allows the Storyteller to create or modify scenarios by placing items , monsters , and characters across the map . Character statistics , such as experience points , abilities , and disciplines , can also be modified . Finally , the Storyteller can assume the role of any character at any given time . These functions allow the Storyteller to dynamically manipulate the play environment while the other players traverse it .

 = = = Setting = = = 
 The events depicted in Vampire : The Masquerade – Redemption occur in two time periods : 12th century Prague and Vienna , and late @-@ 20th century London and New York City . The game is set in the World of Darkness ; it depicts a world in which vampires , werewolves , demons , and other creatures influence human history . The vampires are divided into seven Clans of the Camarilla — the vampire government — each with distinctive traits and abilities . The Toreadors are the closest to humanity — they have a passion for culture ; the Ventrue are noble , powerful leaders ; the Brujah are idealists who excel at fighting ; the Malkavians are either cursed with insanity or blessed with insight ; the Gangrel are loners in synchronization with their animalistic nature ; the Tremere are secretive , untrustworthy , and wield blood magic ; and the monstrous Nosferatu are condemned to remain hidden in the shadows . Redemption also features the Cappadocian clan ; the Society of Leopold — modern @-@ day vampire hunters ; the <unk> clan of assassin vampires ; the Setite clan ; and the Sabbat — vampires who revel in their nature , embracing the beast within . 
 The main character of Redemption is French crusader Christof Romuald , a once @-@ proud , religious church knight who is transformed into a Brujah vampire . With his religious faith destroyed , Christof is forced to reassess his understanding of good and evil as he <unk> to his new life . Christof 's anchor to humanity is the nun Anezka , a human with a pure soul who loves <unk> even after his transformation . As a member of the Brujah under Ecaterina the Wise , Christof allies with Wilhem Streicher , the Gangrel Erik , and the Cappadocian Serena during his journeys through 12th century Prague . Other characters in this era include the slaver Count Orsi , the Tremere Etrius , and the Ventrue Prince <unk> . 
 Christof continues his quest into the late @-@ 20th century , where he allies with the Brujah Pink , the enslaved Toreador Lily , and the Nosferatu Samuel . Other characters include the 300 @-@ year @-@ old human leader of the Society of Leopold , Leo <unk> — who has unnaturally extended his lifespan by consuming vampire blood — and the Setite leader Lucretia . During his journey , Christof comes into conflict with Vukodlak , a powerful Tzimisce vampire intent on usurping the clans ' ancestors and taking their power for himself . Trapped in a mystical sleep by those who oppose his plot , Vukodlak commands his followers to help resurrect him . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 In 1141 in Prague , crusader Christof Romuald is wounded in battle . He recovers in a church , where he is cared for by a nun called Anezka . The pair instantly fall in love but are restrained by their commitments to God . Christof enters a nearby silver mine to kill a monstrous Tzimisce vampire who is tormenting the city . Christof 's victory is noted by the local vampires , one of whom , Ecaterina the Wise , turns him into a vampire to prevent another clan from taking him . 
 Initially defiant , Christof agrees to accompany Ecaterina 's servant Wilhem on a mission to master his new vampiric abilities . Afterwards , he meets with Anezka and refuses to taint her with his cursed state . At Ecaterina 's haven , the Brujah tell Christof about an impending war between the Tremere and Tzimisce clans that will devastate humans caught up in it . Wilhem and Christof gain the favor of the local Jews and Cappadocians , who devote their member Serena to the Brujah cause . The Ventrue prince <unk> tells the group that in Vienna , the Tremere are abducting humans to turn them into ghouls — servitors addicted and empowered by Vampire blood . The group infiltrate the Tremere chantry in Prague , and stop the Gangrel Erik from being turned into a Gargoyle , and he joins them . Christof learns that Anezka , seeking Christof 's redemption , has visited the Tremere and Tzimisce clans , and the Vienna Tremere stronghold , Haus de <unk> . There , the Tremere leader Etrius turns Erik into a Gargoyle , forcing Christof to kill him . Etrius reveals that the Tzimisce abducted Anezka . 
 Returning to Prague , Christof finds the Tzimisce in nearby Vyšehrad Castle have been revealed to the humans , who have launched an assault on the structure . Christof , Wilhem , and Serena infiltrate the castle and find that the powerful , slumbering <unk> has enslaved Anezka as a ghoul . Anezka rejects Christof and prepares to revive Vukodlak , but the outside assault collapses the castle upon them . 
 In 1999 , the Society of Leopold excavates the site of Vyšehrad Castle ; they recover Christof 's body and take it to London , where he is awoken by a female voice . He learns that the events at Vyšehrad and the resulting human uprising divided the vampires into two sects : the Camarilla who seek to hide from humanity and the Sabbat who seek to regain dominion over it . The Society 's excavation also enables Vukodlak 's followers to recover Vyšehrad . After escaping , Christof meets Pink , who agrees to help him . They learn that the Setite clan has been shipping Vyšehrad contraband to New York City and infiltrate a Setite brothel to gain information . They kill the Setite leader Lucretia and recruit Lily , an enslaved prostitute . 
 Christof , Pink , and Lily travel to New York City aboard a contraband ship , rescue the Nosferatu Samuel from the Sabbat , and infiltrate a warehouse storing the Vyšehrad contraband . There they encounter Wilhem , who is now a Sabbat under Ecaterina following the collapse of their group . Wilhem reveals that Pink is an assassin working for Vukodlak . Pink escapes and Wilhem rejoins Christof , hoping to reclaim the humanity he has sacrificed during the previous 800 years . Together , Christof , Wilhem , Lily , and Samuel discover that Vukodlak is hidden beneath a church within his Cathedral of Flesh and that Anezka is still in his servitude . In the cathedral they find that Vukodlak has awoken ; he tries to influence Christof by offering him Anezka then revealing that she is completely dependent on Vukodlak 's blood and will die without him . Christof refuses and Vukodlak drops the group into tunnels beneath the cathedral . Christof finds the Wall of Memories , which hold Anezka 's memories of the last millennia , showing she continued to hope as Vukodlak found new ways to defile and torment her . She eventually sacrificed her innocence to gain Vukodlak 's trust , using her position to delay his resurrection over hundreds of years until , with no options left , she prayed for Christof 's return . The group returns to the Cathedral and battles Vukodlak . 
 The ending of Redemption varies depending upon on the quantity of humanity Christof has retained during the game . If the quantity is great , Christof reconciles with Anezka and turns her into a vampire , sparing her from death . If his humanity is moderate , he surrenders to Vukodlak and becomes a ghoul ; Vukodlak betrays Christof and forces him to murder Anezka . A lesser quantity of humanity results in Christof killing Vukodlak by drinking his blood . Greatly empowered , Christof forsakes his humanity , murders Anezka , and revels in his new power .

 The development of Vampire : The Masquerade – Redemption began at Nihilistic Software in April 1998 , shortly after the developer 's founding in March that year . Its development was publicly announced in March 1999 . Intending to move away from the first @-@ person games the team members had worked on with previous companies , Nihilistic prepared a design and story for a futuristic RPG with similar themes and gothic aesthetics to those of the Vampire : The Masquerade series . After publisher Activision approached the team using the White Wolf license , they adapted parts of their original design to fit the Vampire series , which became the original design for Redemption . <unk> by Id Software founder John Carmack helped Nihilistic decide to work with Activision . The Nihilistic team developed Redemption over twenty @-@ four months ; the team expanded to twelve members by the end of development . The development team included Nihilistic President and CEO Ray <unk> , lead programmer Rob Huebner , world designer Steve Tietze , level designer Steve Thoms , lead artist Maarten Kraaijvanger , artist Yujin Kiem , art technician Anthony Chiang , and programmers Yves <unk> and <unk> Shu . 
 Activision provided a budget of US $ 1 @.@ 8 million ; the amount was intentionally kept low to make the project manageable for Nihilistic and reduce the risk to Activision , which was relatively inexperienced with RPGs at the time . Nihilistic 's management was committed to the entire team working in a one @-@ room environment with no walls , doors , or offices , believing this would force the individual groups to communicate and allow each department to respond to queries immediately , saving hours or days of development time . Redemption 's story was developed with input from Wolf ; it was co @-@ written by Daniel Greenberg , a writer for the source pen @-@ and @-@ paper RPG . 
 The small size of the team led to Nihilistic relying on eight external contractors to provide elements the team could not supply . Nick Peck was chosen to provide sounds effects , ambient loops , and additional voice recordings based on his previous work on Grim Fandango ( 1998 ) . Kevin Manthei provided the musical score for the game 's 12th century sections , while a duo called Youth Engine provided the modern @-@ day sections ' score . Some artwork was outsourced ; Peter Chan ( Day of the Tentacle ( 1993 ) and Grim Fandango ) developed concept art to establish the look of the game 's environments , and Patrick Lambert developed character concepts and full @-@ color drawings for the modelers and animators to use . Huebner considered the most important external relationship was with a small start @-@ up company called <unk> , which produced cinematic movies for the game 's story elements and endings . Nihilistic met with various computer animation firms but their prices were too expensive for the project budget . 
 Redemption was officially released to manufacturing on May 30 , 2000 . The game features 300 @,@ 000 lines of code , with a further 66 @,@ 000 lines for <unk> scripts . In January 2000 , it was announced that Nihilistic was seeking a studio to port Redemption to the Sega Dreamcast video game console , however this version was never released . In February 2001 , after the release of the PC version , it was announced that MacSoft Games was developing a <unk> version of the game . 
 = = = Technology = = = 
 Nihilistic initially looked at existing game engines such as the Quake engine and Unreal Engine , but decided those engines , which were primarily designed for first @-@ person shooters , would not be sufficient for its point @-@ and @-@ click driven RPG and decided to create its own engine for development of Redemption . This was the NOD engine , which the developers could customize for the game 's 3D perspective and role @-@ playing mechanics . The team also considered that developing its own engine would allow it to freely reuse code for future projects or to license the engine for profit . NOD was prototyped using the Glide application programming interface ( API ) because the team believed it would be more stable during the engine 's development , intending that once the engine was more complete , it would be moved to a more general API designed to support a wide range of hardware such as Direct3D . However , once a basic engine was in place in Glide , the programmers turned their attention to gameplay and functionality . By June 1999 , Redemption was still running in Glide , which at that point lacked some of the basic features the team needed to demonstrate at that year 's Electronic Entertainment Expo . When the team eventually switched to Direct3D , it was forced to abandon some custom code it had built to compensate for Glide 's limitations such as texture and graphic management , which required the re @-@ exporting of hundreds of levels and models for the new software . The late API switch also limited the time available to test the game 's compatibility on a wide range of hardware . The team focused on building the game for hardware accelerated systems to avoid the limitations of supporting a wider range of systems , which had restricted the development of the company founders ' previous game , Star Wars Jedi Knight : Dark Forces II ( 1997 ) . 
 The programmers suggested using 3D Studio Max for art and level design , which would save money by allowing the company to license a single piece of software , but the lead artists successfully lobbied against this plan , believing that allowing the respective teams to choose the software would allow them to work most efficiently . Huebner said this saved the project more time than any other decision made during development . The level designers chose QERadiant to take advantage of their previous experience using the software while working on Id Software 's Quake series . Id allowed Nihilistic to license QERadiant and modify it to create a customized tool for its 3D environments . Because QERadiant was a finished , functional tool , it allowed the level designers to begin developing levels from the project 's start and then export them into the NOD engine , rather than waiting for up to six months for Nihilistic to develop a custom tool or learning a new 3D level editor . In twenty @-@ four months , the three level designers built over 100 in @-@ game environments for Redemption . They obtained blueprints and sketches of buildings from medieval Prague and Vienna to better represent that period and locations . The four @-@ person art team led by Kraaijvanger used Alias Wavefront Maya to create 3D art . Nihilistic 's management wanted Kraaijvanger to use a less expensive tool but relented when the cost was found to be lower than had been thought . Throughout the project , the art team built over 1 @,@ 500 3D models . 
 At the start of development , Nihilistic wanted to support editing of the game by the user @-@ community , having seen the benefits to the community while working on other games . Staff who worked on Jedi Knight knew the experience of creating a new , customized programming language called COG that gave the programmers the results they wanted but cost time and significant project resources . With Redemption , they wanted to incorporate an existing scripting engine that would more easily enable users to further develop the game instead of developing their own code again , which would consume months of development time . The team tested various languages , but became aware of another studio , Rebel Boat Rocker , which was receiving attention for its use of the Java language . Speaking to that studio 's lead programmer Billy <unk> , Nihilistic decided to experiment with Java , having little prior knowledge of it . The language successfully integrated into the NOD engine without problems , providing a standardized and freely distributable scripting engine . Several designers were trained to use Java to allow them to build the several hundred scripts required to drive the game 's storyline . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 The Nihilistic team used their experience adapting an existing property for the Star Wars games to design Redemption . Reasoning that most people would be familiar with vampire tropes , the team wrote the game assuming players would not need an explanation of the genre 's common elements , while enabling them to explore White Wolf 's additions to the mythos . When translating the pen @-@ and @-@ paper RPG to a video game , the team redesigned some of the disciplines to make them simpler to understand . For example , in the pen @-@ and @-@ paper game , the " Protean " discipline includes the abilities to see in the dark , grow claws , melt into the ground , and change into an animal , however in Redemption these were made into individual disciplines to make them instantly accessible , instead of requiring the player to select Protean and then select one of the sub @-@ abilities . 
 Huebner said the team struggled with restraint . From inception , the team had developed its assets for a high @-@ end system to ensure the finished project would have top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ range graphics , and because if necessary , it could more easily scale down the art down than scale it up . However , the art teams were not stopped from producing new assets , resulting in Redemption requiring approximately 1GB of storage space to install . Additionally , textures were made in 32 @-@ bit color , models were extremely detailed — featuring between 1 @,@ 000 and 2 @,@ 000 triangles each on average — and levels were illuminated with high @-@ resolution light @-@ maps . Because the game was designed for high @-@ end computer systems , it relied on algorithms to scale down the models ; combined with the high detail art assets , Redemption was taxing to run on low- and mid @-@ range systems . Nihilistic had intended to include both 16 @-@ bit and 32 @-@ bit versions of the game textures , and different sound quality levels to allow players to choose which versions to install , but the CD @-@ ROM format was not spacious enough to accommodate more than one version of the game . The finished product barely fitted onto two CD @-@ ROMs ; some sound assets were removed to fit the format . This caused the game to use a large amount of computer resources and limited the ability to port it to more limited console environments . 
 The programmers identified early on that pathfinding — the ability of the variable @-@ sized characters to navigate through the environment — would be a problem . Huebner cited the difficulty of programming characters to navigate an environment in which level designers are free to add stairs , ramps , and other 3D objects . They came up with a temporary solution and planned to improve the pathfinding later into development . By the time they properly addressed the problem , many of the levels were almost complete and featured few markers the programmers could use to control movement . They could identify walkable tiles but not walls , cliffs , and other environmental hazards . Ideal solutions , such as creating zones for characters could walk through would have taken too much time to retroactively add into the 100 created levels , so the programmers spent several weeks making small , iterative fixes to conceal the obvious errors in the pathfinding and leave less obvious ones intact . 
 From the outset , the team wanted to make a grand RPG , but were restricted by their budget and schedule . They were reluctant to cut any content such as one of the time periods or the multiplayer aspect , and they decided to postpone the original release date from March 2000 to June the same year . They also scaled back the scope of their multiplayer testing and canceled the planned release of an interactive pre @-@ launch demo . The delay allowed Nihilistic to retain most of the intended design but they were forced to remove the ability to play the entire single @-@ player campaign as a team online , compensating for this by adding two multiplayer scenarios built using levels from the single @-@ player game . Huebner said they did not plan appropriately for multiplayer when building the Java scripts for the single @-@ player game , meaning the scripts did not work effectively in multiplayer mode . 
 The multiplayer " Storyteller " mode was conceived early in the development cycle . Diverting from the typical death match or co @-@ operative gameplay multiplayer modes , Storyteller required Nihilistic to develop an interface that could give one player , the Storyteller , enough control to run a particular scenario , and change events in the game in real time without making it too complex to understand for the average player . Much of the technology was simple to implement , requiring typical multiplayer software components that would allow users to connect with each other . The largest task required the development of an interface that could provide the Storyteller with control over the aspects of a multiplayer game without it becoming too complex . The interface had to contain lists of objects , characters , and other resources , and options to manipulate those resources . It had to be mostly accessible using a mouse as input , reserving the keyboard for less common and more advanced commands . The mode was inspired by the text @-@ based Multi @-@ User Dungeon , a multiplayer real @-@ time virtual world in which high @-@ ranking users can manipulate the game 's environment and dynamically create adventures .

 Vampire : The Masquerade – Redemption was released for Microsoft Windows on June 7 , 2000 . The game 's release included a standalone copy of the game , and a Collector 's Edition containing a copy of the game , a hardbound , limited edition of White Wolf 's Book of Nod chronicling the first Vampire , a Camarilla pendant , the game 's strategy guide , and an alternative game case cover . The Collector 's Edition also included a copy of the game 's soundtrack , featuring songs by Type O Negative , Gravity Kills , Ministry , Darling Violetta , <unk> , Primus , Youth Engine , and Kevin Manthei . Nihilistic also released Embrace , a level editor with access to the game 's code to allow fans to modify levels and scripts . A Mac OS version was released in November 2001 . Redemption received a digital release on the GOG.com service in February 2010 . 
 During its first week on sale , the Microsoft Windows version of Redemption was the third best @-@ selling game behind The Sims and Who Wants To Be A Millionaire 2nd Edition . Sales of the Collector 's Edition were individually tracked ; it was the fifth best @-@ selling game that same week . Redemption achieved enough success to merit the 2004 release of an indirect sequel , Vampire : The Masquerade – Bloodlines , which was set in the same fictional universe and was developed by Troika Games .

 Vampire : The Masquerade – Redemption received a mixed critical response . The aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic give it a score of 75 % ( based on 33 reviews ) and 74 out of 100 ( based on 22 reviews ) , respectively . Reviewers compared it to other successful RPGs , including Diablo II , Deus Ex , <unk> : Evil Reigns , and the Final Fantasy series . 
 The game 's graphics received near @-@ unanimous praise . Game Revolution said its " brilliant " graphics were among the best in gaming and Next Generation said the graphics were the best in any PC RPG . Computer Games said it was the most attractive PC game at the time , ArsTechnica said it was the best game to look at and watch since The Last Express ( 1997 ) , and PC Gamer said , " there has never been a more beautifully created RPG " . The level design and environments were praised for the level of detail , providing a brooding , atmospheric aesthetic with " painstaking " detail . Reviewers also made positive comments about the game 's lighting effects . Conversely , Computer Gaming World ( CGW ) said that while the game was attractive , the visuals were superficial and failed to emphasize the game 's horror elements . They were also critical of the third @-@ person in @-@ game camera positioning , claiming that it obscured the area directly in front of the player and did not allow the player to look upwards . 
 Responses to the story were ambivalent ; some reviewers called it strong with good dialog ; others said it was poor . <unk> and CGW called the dialog poor , sophomoric , and often overly @-@ verbose ; in particular CGW said some speeches became an " agonizingly long filibuster " that only served to delay the return of control to the player . Other sources called it one of the richest , most engrossing stories to be found outside films and novels , and more original than most RPGs . Computer Games criticized the linear storyline , and said the few dialog choices available to the player had no real impact on the storytelling . CGW said the linear story prevented Redemption from being a true RPG because it lacked interaction with many characters , and the lack of player impact on the story made it seem as though they were not building characters but rather were getting them to the story milestones . According to PC Gamer , while the game 's linearity was a negative , it kept the narrative tight and compelling . 
 Reviewers variously appreciated and disliked the voice acting . Game Revolution and Computer Games said the acting ranged from adequate to good , while CGW said the voices were inappropriate and the 12th century European voices sounding like modern Americans , but that the modern @-@ era featured better actors . ArsTechnica said the acting was inconsistent but was better than that of Deus Ex . The weather effects , background sound , and moody music were said to blend together well and help immerse the player in the game 's world . CGW said the sound quality was sometimes poor . 
 Much of Redemption 's criticism focused on technical problems when it was released , undermining the game experience or making it unplayable . Several reviewers noted issues with the initial lack of a function to save game progress at any point , which meant that dying or technical issues with the game could necessitate them to reload a previous save , and then repeat up to 30 minutes of gameplay . CGW added that the repetitive gameplay meant that losing progress and having to repeat it was a particular downside . Next Generation , who provided the game with a score of 3 out of 5 , said that Redemption was potentially only a few patches away from being a 5 out of 5 game , if not for technical issues . PC Gamer 's review even included recommended instructions for cheats that worked around the technical flaws . 
 CGW said the in @-@ game combat became a confusing mess once allies became involved , in part due to poor Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) that caused them to use powers liberally and become low on blood as a result . The AI was considered to be insufficient for the game ; pathfinding failures meant allies would become stuck on environmental objects or each other during combat , use up their costliest abilities on enemies regardless of their threat , and were poor at staying alive in battle . Enemies were similarly dismissed for either not noticing the playable character in obvious circumstances or failing to respond to attacks on themselves . 
 Combat was also criticized ; Computer Games called the game " little more than a hack @-@ and @-@ slash adventure " , and said the game 's focus on combat was counter to the greater focus on political intrigue and social interaction prevalent in the source Vampire – the Masquerade tabletop game . ArsTechnica said that combat was initially fun but very repetitive , and it became a chore by the later stages of the game , noting that every enemy dungeon consisted of four levels filled with identical enemies , while Next Generation said the number of enemies and the difficulty of defeating them often meant the playable character would run away or die . The repetitive combat was also criticized by other reviewers , who disliked that it involved repeatedly clicking on enemies until they were dead ; and running away if the playable character was about to die against unending waves of enemies . Disciplines were considered helpful in adding variety to combat , but battles were too fast @-@ paced to allow the tactical use of a wide range of powers because of the inability to pause the combat to allow the issuing of orders . 
 Game Revolution said the multiplayer feature was a revelation and worth the cost of the game alone . Computer Games said it was innovative and may serve as an inspiration for future games . PC Gamer said the multiplayer mode was the redeeming factor of the game , though it was still marred by bugs . Others noted that aspects of the multiplayer interface were insufficient , such as the inability to store custom dialog , requiring the Storyteller to type text in real time during gameplay .

 = George Toogood Smith = 
 George Toogood Smith ( 1903 – 5 June 1955 ) was the maternal uncle , through marriage , of John Lennon . Smith operated his family 's two dairy farms and a retail outlet with his brother , Frank Smith , in the village of Woolton , Liverpool . The farms had been in the Smith family for four generations , but after the start of World War II , they were taken over by the British Government for war work . 
 Smith started courting Mimi Stanley in the spring of 1932 , but was thwarted by her indifference and her father 's interference . After delivering milk to the hospital where she worked he gave her an ultimatum that she must marry him , " or nothing at all ! " On 15 September 1939 , she finally married him . They bought a semi @-@ detached house called Mendips , named after the range of hills , at 251 Menlove Avenue , Liverpool . 
 Lennon lived with Smith and his wife for the majority of his childhood , and Smith taught the young Lennon to read , read him nursery rhymes at night , and later taught Lennon how to solve crossword puzzles . He also taught him to draw and paint and bought him his first mouth organ . Smith collapsed and died on a Sunday at his home of a liver haemorrhage , aged 52 , and was buried in St Peter ’ s Church graveyard , Woolton . 
 = = Early years = = 
 George Toogood Smith 's parents , Francis and Alice Smith , had eight children in total ; Mary , Eleanor , Francis , Robert , Alice , George , Alfred and one other who died . Robert was killed in action on 30 August 1918 in World War I. George 's paternal grandmother 's maiden name was Toogood which was given to George as a middle name . His mother died in 1949 . Smith operated his family 's two dairy farms and a shop with his brother Frank in the village of Woolton . The farms had been in the Smith family for four generations . Smith delivered milk by horse and cart in the Woolton area . The raw milk he provided was stored in a large churn and was ladled out into the bottles and receptacles of customers . 
 When other girls were thinking of marriage , Mimi Stanley talked of challenges and adventures . She once confided that she never wanted to get married , as she hated the idea of being " tied to the kitchen sink " . She became a resident trainee nurse at the Woolton Convalescent Hospital , to which Smith delivered milk every morning . Smith started seriously courting Mimi in the spring of 1932 , but was constantly thwarted by her indifference and her father 's interference . George Stanley ( Mimi 's father ) would only allow the couple to sit in the back room of the family home in Newcastle Road when he or his wife were in the front room , and before it grew too late he would burst into the back room and loudly order Smith home . The courtship lasted almost seven years , but Smith grew tired of waiting , so after delivering milk to the hospital one morning he gave her an ultimatum that she must marry him , " or nothing at all ! " The youngest sister of the Stanley family , Julia Stanley , had married Alfred Lennon nine months before , on 3 December 1938 . 
 = = = Marriage = = = 
 On 15 September 1939 , Mimi finally married Smith . They bought a semi @-@ detached house called Mendips ( named after the range of hills ) at 251 Menlove Avenue ( across the road from the Allerton Park golf course ) in a middle @-@ class area of Liverpool . After World War II started the British Government took over the Smith family 's farmland for war work , and they had to find other sources of income . 
 Menlove Avenue suffered extensive damage during the war , and Smith and his wife often had to throw a wet blanket on incendiary bombs that fell in their garden . Smith was called up for military service , but was discharged three years later , and subsequently worked in an aircraft factory in Speke until the end of the war . Smith later left the milk trade and started a small bookmaker 's business , which led his wife to complain that Smith was a compulsive gambler , and had lost most of their money . During 1942 – 1943 , Mimi 's sister Julia lived with Lennon at The Dairy Cottage ; 120a Allerton Road , Woolton , which was owned by the Smith family . 
 = = = John Lennon = = = 
 Lennon lived with Smith and his wife for the majority of his childhood when his mother Julia ( under pressure from the local authorities , Mimi , and the Stanley family ) was told that she was unable to care for her son . Julia was eventually forced to hand the care of Lennon over to Mimi and George , who had no children of their own . Lennon then lived continuously at Mendips , in the smallest bedroom above the front door . Lennon later talked about Mendips and the area around it : " I lived in the suburbs in a nice semi @-@ detached place with a small garden and doctors and lawyers and that ilk living around ... not the poor <unk> kind of image that was projected in all The Beatles ' stories " . 
 Smith was very fond of Lennon , and his softer approach to parenting was in stark contrast to his stern wife , who based everything on decorum , honesty , and a black @-@ and @-@ white attitude ; either you were good enough or you were not . Pete Shotton — Lennon 's school friend — later commented that " Mimi had a very strong sense of what was right or wrong " . In contrast , Smith used to give the young Lennon " <unk> " ( kisses ) that his wife did not approve of . 
 Smith taught the four @-@ year @-@ old Lennon to read by reading out loud the headlines of the Liverpool Echo , read him nursery rhymes at night , and later taught Lennon how to solve crossword puzzles . Smith told Lennon that words did not have to be taken at face value , as they had many different meanings , which Lennon would later use in his writing . He also taught Lennon to draw and paint and bought him his first mouth organ . Mimi admitted that she never had the time to " go playing ducks in the bath with him " ( Lennon ) but that Smith would put Lennon to bed nearly every night . Mimi later said : " John [ Lennon ] loved his uncle George . I felt quite left out of that . They 'd go off together , just leaving me a bar of chocolate and a note saying : ' Have a happy day . ' " 
 Smith often took Lennon and his cousins to the cinema or the park , even though he worked at night and early in the morning on the farm and his milk round . When the cousins played outside Smith allowed them to eat meals with their hands in the garden shed . During the school holidays Lennon and his cousins were allowed to accompany Smith on his milk rounds , and every year he allowed Lennon to place a bet on the Grand National . 
 = = Death = = 
 Smith collapsed and died on a Sunday at home of a liver haemorrhage ( aged 52 ) and was buried in the graveyard of St. Peter 's Church , Woolton , in the Smith family grave . 
 At the time of Smith 's death , the fourteen @-@ year @-@ old Lennon was visiting members of the Stanley family in Sango Bay , Durness , Scotland , and was not informed until he returned home . Lennon 's first reaction was to laugh hysterically , but then to privately grieve and cry , as he later did after hearing about the death of his mother three years later , and the death of Stuart Sutcliffe ( The Beatles ' first bass player ) which were all major factors in Lennon 's early life . In the same year as Smith ’ s death the McCartney family moved to 20 Forthlin Road , which is only ¾ of a mile ( 1 @.@ 2 km ) from Mendips . Lennon would later meet Paul McCartney for the first time at St. Peter 's Church , where Smith was buried . 
 After Smith 's death , Lennon insisted on wearing a large overcoat that had belonged to Smith , and even though it became worn and threadbare , Lennon wore it throughout his art college years . Mimi never used the downstairs sitting rooms again after Smith 's death ( only using the breakfast room and the kitchen ) and never replaced the furniture , which became old and faded . Lennon continued to live at Mendips ( and also for a time with his first wife Cynthia Lennon ) until his early 20s , before moving to London . 
 When Lennon was living in America he asked his half @-@ sister , Julia Dykins , to send the clock that was previously in the living room at Mendips , which had been passed down through Smith 's family , and was inscribed with the words , " George Smith , Woolton Tavern " , onto a metal plate on the back . In Lennon 's last published interview , he said : " This image of me being an orphan is garbage , because I was well protected by my auntie and uncle [ Smith and Mimi ] and they looked after me very well , thanks " .

 = Leicester Square = 
 Leicester Square ( / <unk> / <unk> @-@ ter ) ) is a pedestrianised square in the West End of London , England . It was laid out in 1670 and is named after the contemporary Leicester House , itself named after Robert Sidney , 2nd Earl of Leicester . 
 The square was originally a gentrified residential area , with tenants including Frederick , Prince of Wales and artists William Hogarth and Joshua Reynolds . It became more down @-@ market in the late 18th century as Leicester House was demolished and retail developments took place , becoming a centre for entertainment . Several major theatres were established in the 19th century , which were converted to cinemas towards the middle of the next . Leicester Square holds a number of nationally important cinemas such as the Odeon Leicester Square , Empire , Leicester Square and the now closed Odeon West End , which are frequently used for film premières , The nearby Prince Charles Cinema is popular for showing cult films and marathon film runs . The square remains a popular tourist attraction , including hosting events for the Chinese New Year . 
 The square has always had a park in its centre , which was originally Lammas land . The park 's fortunes have varied over the centuries , reaching near dilapidation in the mid @-@ 19th century after changing ownership several times . It was restored under the direction of Albert Grant , which included the construction of four new statues and a fountain of William Shakespeare . The square was extensively refurbished and remodelled for the 2012 London Olympics , costing more than £ 15m and taking over 17 months to complete .

 The square lies within an area bound by Lisle Street , to the north ; Charing Cross Road , to the east ; Orange Street , to the south ; and Whitcomb Street , to the west . The park at the centre of the Square is bound by Cranbourn Street , to the north ; Leicester Street , to the east ; Irving Street , to the south ; and a section of road designated simply as Leicester Square , to the west . It is within the City of Westminster , north of Trafalgar Square , east of Piccadilly Circus , west of Covent Garden , and south of Cambridge Circus .

 The land where Leicester Square now lies once belonged to the Abbot and Convent of Westminster Abbey and the Beaumont family . In 1536 , Henry VIII took control of 3 acres ( 1 @.@ 2 ha ) of land around the square , with the remaining 4 acres ( 1 @.@ 6 ha ) being transferred to the king the following year . The square is named after Robert Sidney , 2nd Earl of Leicester , who purchased this land in 1630 . By 1635 , he had built himself a large house , Leicester House , at the northern end . The area in front of the house was then enclosed , depriving inhabitants of St Martin in the Fields parish of their right to use the previously common land . The parishioners appealed to King Charles I , and he appointed three members of the privy council to arbitrate . Lord Leicester was ordered to keep part of his land ( thereafter known as Leicester Fields and later as Leicester Square ) open for the parishioners . 
 The square was laid out to the south of Leicester House and developed in the 1670s . The area was originally entirely residential , with properties laid out in a similar style to nearby Pall Mall . In 1687 , the northern part of the square became part of the new parish of St Anne , Soho . The Jocelyn Sidney , 7th Earl of Leicester took ownership of the property in 1728 and it was briefly the residence of Frederick , Prince of Wales from 1742 until Leicester 's death the following year . The poet Matthew Prior lived at what is now No. 21 around 1700 and artist William Hogarth resided at No 30 between 1733 and 1764 , where he produced some of his best known works including Gin Lane . The magistrate Thomas de Veil , later to found Bow Street Magistrates ' Court , lived at No 40 between 1729 and 1737 ; this location is now the Odeon West End . The painter Joshua Reynolds lived at No 47 from 1760 until his death in 1792 ; this location is now Fanum House , once the Automobile Association head office . 
 At the end of the 17th century , Lord Leicester 's heir , Philip Sidney , 3rd Earl of Leicester , permitted a small amount of retail development in booths along the front of Leicester House . A statue of King George I was built on the square in 1760 following the coronation of his grandson , George III . The square remained fashionable throughout most of the 18th century , with notable residents including the architect James Stuart at No 35 from 1766 to 1788 and the painter John Singleton Copley at No. 28 from 1776 to 1783 . 
 Leicester House was intermittently inhabited during the mid @-@ 18th century , and was finally sold to the naturalist Ashton Lever in 1775 . Lever turned the house into a museum with a significant amount of natural history objects . In turn , the square began to serve as a venue for popular entertainments . <unk> started appearing around Leicester Square during the century , and visitors could pay to watch the severed heads of traitors executed at Temple Bar through a telescope . Leicester House became home of a museum of natural curiosities called the <unk> in the 1780s . It was demolished in 1791 – 72 due to rising debts following the extinction of the Leicester peerage , and replaced by Leicester Place . That in turn was converted into a church in 1865 and is now the site of the Prince Charles Cinema . 
 In 1790 , a new Royal Opera House was proposed to be built in Leicester Square . The scheme was led by The Prince of Wales , Francis Russell , 5th Duke of Bedford and James Cecil , 1st Marquess of Salisbury and aimed to re @-@ establish London as a centre for Italian opera and ballet , with an opera house to rival those in mainland Europe . The opera house was never built , as the royal patent needed at that time to license a theatre was refused . The plans for the original design are preserved in Sir John Soane 's Museum , while a 1790 painting by William Hodges , which displays the finished design , belongs to the Museum of London .

 By the 19th century , Leicester Square was known as an entertainment venue , with many amusements peculiar to the era , including Wyld 's Great Globe , which was built for The Great Exhibition of 1851 and housed a giant scale map of the Earth . The construction of New Coventry Street made it easier for traffic to access the square , resulting in private residences being replaced by shops , museums and exhibition centres . Savile House at No. 5 – 6 , built in 1683 for Thomas Bruce , 2nd Earl of Ailesbury , had become a museum by this time , and was ultimately destroyed by fire in 1865 . It was rebuilt as the Empire Theatre . 
 Several foreign @-@ owned hotels were established around the square , making it popular with visitors to London . Brunet 's Hôtel at No. 25 was opened by Louis Brunet in 1800 , later expanding to Nos. 24 and 26 during the following decade . It was bought by Francis <unk> in 1815 known as <unk> 's Hôtel . The Hôtel <unk> et de Provence opened at No. 17 – 18 in 1845 as the Hôtel de Provence , and renamed in 1869 . It closed in 1919 and became a public house . The Cavour , at No. 20 at the southeast of the square , opened in 1864 . It was badly damaged in World War II but subsequently restored . 
 The Alhambra Theatre was built in 1854 on the east side of the square , dominating the site . It temporarily closed two years later when the original owner , Edward Clarke , became bankrupt , but then reopened in 1858 as the Alhambra Palace . It enjoyed a surge in popularity after Queen Victoria and family came to see " Black Eagle – The Horse of Beauty " . It burned down in 1882 , but reopened the following year . In the early 20th century , the theatre became a popular venue for ballet . It was demolished in 1936 and replaced by the Odeon Cinema . The Empire Theatre of Varieties opened in 1881 on the former site of Savile House , but had a troubled start , closing for a time , until the end of the decade . The theatre had a notorious reputation for high @-@ class prostitutes frequenting the theatre , and in 1894 the London County Council ordered the promenade on the upper balcony to be remodelled . A young Winston Churchill , then a cadet at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst , helped destroy canvas screens that had been erected to prevent access to the balcony . The theatre closed in 1927 , to be replaced by the Empire Cinema . 
 During the Winter of Discontent , where the incumbent Labour Party struggled to meet demands of trade unions and a shrinking economy , refuse collectors went on strike in January 1979 . Leicester Square was turned into a de facto dump , earning it the nickname of " <unk> Square " . In the 1980s , the square was pedestrianised , cutting off all vehicular traffic . Access to the square for goods and deliveries is now controlled by specially designated marshals . 
 By the start of the 21st century , Westminster City Council were concerned that the square was too dangerous at night , and wanted to demolish sections of it to encourage the growth of theatres and cinemas , and reduce popularity of nightclubs . In 2010 , a major redevelopment of Leicester Square took place as part of a Great Outdoors scheme proposed by the Mayor of London , Boris Johnson . The improvements included 12 @,@ 000 square metres ( 130 @,@ 000 sq ft ) of granite paving and a water feature surrounding the Shakespeare statue . The square re @-@ opened in May 2012 after 17 months ' work at a total cost of £ 15 @.@ 3 million .

 In the middle of the Square is a small park that was originally available for common use on Lammas Day ( 12 August ) , such as washing clothes and herding cattle . The Earl of Leicester was obliged to preserve these grounds , which were separated from the rest of the square with railings . In 1808 , the garden was sold by the Leicester Estate to Charles Elmes for £ 210 ( now <unk> ) , who neglected to maintain it . Ownership changed hands a number of times during the first half of the 19th century , including Robert Barren following <unk> 's death in 1822 , John <unk> in 1834 , and Hyam Hyams and Edward Moxhay in 1839 . Little maintenance was done and the garden deteriorated to the point of severe dilapidation . 
 In 1848 , the land was subject to the significant legal case of Tulk v Moxhay . The plot 's previous owner , Moxhay , had agreed upon a covenant not to erect buildings but the law would not allow buyers who were not " privy " to the initial contract to be bound by subsequent promises . The judge , Lord Cottenham , decided that future owners could be bound by promises to abstain from activity . Otherwise , a buyer could sell land to himself to undermine an initial promise . James Wyld bought the assets of the garden from the Tulk and Moxhay 's deaths in 1849 in order to erect the Great Globe , though buried the statue of George I under 12 foot of earth with the globe stuck on top . The statue was subsequently uncovered following the globe 's demise , but by 1866 it had deteriorated due to vandalism and was sold for £ 16 . Arguments continued about the fate of the garden , with Charles Augustus Tulk 's heirs erecting a wooden hoarding around the property in 1873 . These were quickly removed after the Master of the Rolls ordered that the land must be preserved for its original purpose . 
 The garden was saved by the Member of parliament Albert Grant , who purchased the park in 1874 for £ 11 @,@ 060 and donated it to the Metropolitan Board of Works . The title deed for the square passed to the succeeding public bodies and is now in the ownership of the City of Westminster . After the purchase , the architect James Knowles redesigned the park . A statue of William Shakespeare surrounded by dolphins was constructed in the centre . The four corner gates of the park had one bust each of famous former residents in the square : the scientist Sir Isaac Newton designed by W. Calder Marshall ; Sir Joshua Reynolds , the first President of the Royal Academy by H. Weekes ; John Hunter , a pioneer of surgery , by T. Wooler ; and William Hogarth , the painter , by J. Durham . Ownership transferred to Westminster City Council in 1933 . The most recent addition was a bronze statue of film star and director Charlie Chaplin , designed by sculptor John Doubleday in 1981 . On the pavement were inscribed the distances in miles to several Commonwealth countries , including Canada , Kenya and Jamaica . After the Great Outdoors refurbishment of the square , only the statue of Shakespeare still remains .

 The Leicester Square Theatre is based in nearby Leicester Place . It was constructed in 1955 as a church , before becoming the Notre Dame Hall , then the Cavern in the Town , a popular live music venue in the 1960s . In the 1970s , it was renamed back to the Notre Dame Hall , where the Sex Pistols played one of their first gigs at the club on 15 November 1976 . It was converted into a theatre in 2002 as The Venue , and refurbished as the Leicester Square Theatre in 2008 . In 2014 , it began a production of a musical based on Oscar Wilde 's De Profundis . 
 The Square has been the home for TKTS ( originally known as the Official London Half @-@ Price Theatre Ticket Booth ) , since 1980 . Tickets for theatre performances taking place around the West End that day and during the week are sold from the booth at a significant discount .

The projection room still contains some of the original 1930s decor and normally houses two projectors . The Empire opened in 1962 . It was previously the largest cinema on the square , but in 2013 it was subdivided to cater for an IMAX screen . The Odeon West End , on the south side , opened in 1930 . It was not generally used for premières and was earmarked for demolition in 2014 , to be replaced by a ten @-@ storey hotel including a two @-@ screen cinema . Westminster City Council reported 400 new jobs would be available after the redevelopment .

 A short distance from the west of the Square , on the south side of Panton Street , is the Odeon Panton Street . The Prince Charles Cinema , to the north of the square opened in 1962 with a " satellite dish " design where the audience looks upwards to the stage . The cinema became notorious for showing pornographic and erotic films during the 1970s , including 1974 's Emmanuelle . It later became a favourite venue for showing cult films , including the The Rocky Horror Picture Show ( 1975 ) and a sing @-@ along version of The Sound of Music ( 1965 ) , and marathon performances including all seven Muppet films back to back . Prices are considerably cheaper than the main cinemas in the square ; in 2013 a ticket for a new release at the Prince Charles cost £ 10 , compared to £ 24 at the Odeon .

 The 1st Split Partisan Detachment ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : Prvi splitski <unk> odred ) or the 1st Split Detachment ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : Prvi splitski odred ) was a short @-@ lived unit of the Yugoslav Partisans during World War II . It was composed of volunteers from the city of Split and was created in August 1941 , just four months after the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia , and the annexation of Split and most of Dalmatia by the Kingdom of Italy . The unit , composed mostly of young men with little or no fighting experience , planned to relocate to the Dinara mountains to join other Partisan units in fighting the Axis powers . 
 After initial organizational problems , the weakened detachment reached an area near the village of <unk> where they were engaged by Ustaše Militia backed by Italian reinforcements . After a day of fighting and the death of one of their commanders , members of the detachment began to retreat . In the end , the Partisans suffered four killed in action and 25 taken prisoner , while 13 managed to escape . All but three of the prisoners were later executed by firing squad . A Split Detachment was reformed , but most of its fighters were part of the 3rd Dalmatian Assault Brigade .

 The Axis powers began their invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941 . Just four days later , a puppet state known as the Independent State of Croatia ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : Nezavisna Država Hrvatska – NDH ) was declared , encompassing most of modern @-@ day Croatia , Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of modern @-@ day Serbia . In accordance with the Treaties of Rome signed by the Ustaše leadership of the NDH , a large part of the Croatian coastline and islands , including the cities of Split and Rijeka , were incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy . The low morale of Yugoslav troops in Split and the uncontested advance of the Italian Army through Dalmatia resulted in a number of desertions . Paramilitary formations of the Croatian Peasant Party ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : Hrvatska <unk> Stranka , HSS ) disarmed soldiers . By 11 April , there were no organized military formations remaining in Split , and a large number of police and gendarmerie switched their allegiance to the NDH . With Split under the control of the new Ustaše government , the authorities apprehended 300 citizens they deemed to be political enemies . On 13 April , members of the League of Communist Youth of Yugoslavia ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : Savez komunističke omladine Jugoslavije , SKOJ ) broke in to a number of Ustaše weapons depots , stealing dozens of rifles and machine guns , as well as ammunition and hand grenades . 
 On the evening of 15 April , the first troops of the Italian Army entered Split , signifying the start of their occupation . On 21 April , civil control of Split passed from the NDH to Italian authorities , followed by the raising of the Italian flag over the city . On 18 May , Italy and the NDH signed the Treaties of Rome , confirming Italian rule of Dalmatia , including Split .

 On 7 August 1941 , Pavle Pap @-@ <unk> and Mirko Kovačević @-@ Lala arrived in Split with instructions from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Croatia ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : <unk> komitet komunističke <unk> Hrvatske ) to discuss the forming of Partisan detachments to fight the Axis occupiers . In a meeting with the members of the Regional Committee , they agreed that the new detachments should operate in the Dinara mountains where their fighters could rely on support from the population of the Sinj and Livanjsko field regions as well as other Partisan formations planned for Bosanska Krajina and Lika . This plan meant that the detachments would have to be formed and then relocated to the Dinara mountains . Relocation meant crossing the rough terrain of Zagora , whose population did not support the Partisans . Despite these difficulties , it was decided that in the next two days the Regional Committee would form seven detachments , including one from Split . 
 According to the initial plan , on the night of 11 August , the Split Detachment was to move just outside the town and collect weapons that had been captured on 13 April . They would then link up with the Solin Detachment and continue towards Kamešnica . From there , they would travel to Otok to meet with the Sinj Detachment . On 8 August , a meeting of Communist Party members and sympathisers was held in a field house between Split and <unk> to ask for volunteers to join the Split Detachment . The detachment was formed on 11 August , and consisted of 66 members organized in three platoons . The detachment departed Split on the same day , under the command of <unk> Borovčić @-@ Kurir with commissar Alfred Santini , and accompanied by Kovačević @-@ Lala who was in overall command of all Partisan detachments in Dalmatia . 
 = = = Ambush and aftermath = = = 
 The plan went awry when the 2nd Platoon got lost and missed a rendezvous with the 1st and 3rd Platoon , which were waiting for them near <unk> . The 2nd Platoon was therefore disbanded while the rest of the detachment continued via Mosor to <unk> where they were to meet up with their guides . They arrived on the night of 12 August , and upon realizing their guides were not there , decided to continue alone towards Kamešnica , but got lost and ran out of supplies during the night . At dawn on 13 August the detachment camped near the village of <unk> . In the evening they once again continued towards Kamešnica , and at dawn on 14 August , they camped near the village of <unk> , near <unk> . Borovčić @-@ Kurir tasked two fighters to go into the village and ask the locals for water and directions . After talking to some locals , the fighters were fired upon by a member of the Ustaše Militia of the village . They returned fire then continued back to their camp and notified the others about the incident . 
 Just as they finished their report , the detachment was fired on by Ustaše Militia . The Ustaše called for help from Sinj , and by 18 : 00 , Italian reinforcements had arrived and began encircling the detachment , engaging them with mortars and light artillery . Outnumbered and facing an enemy with greater firepower , the Partisans planned to hold their positions until evening then retreat using the cover of darkness . About 20 : 00 , Kovačević @-@ Lala , one of the most experienced members of the detachment , was killed after being hit by a mortar round , which had a significant effect on the morale of the remaining fighters . Borovčić @-@ Kurir issued the order to retreat , but it turned into chaos as individuals fled the area . 
 Four Partisans died in the fighting , and three more were summarily shot after capture . Twenty @-@ five were captured and taken prisoner , while 13 managed to escape . The 25 that were captured were moved to Sinj , where one of the prisoners was beaten to death . The rest were placed on trial before a special court that was sent from Mostar . Three prisoners were acquitted while the remaining 21 were taken to <unk> near Sinj , and executed by firing squad . According to the Yugoslav historian Mate <unk> , a Split Detachment was still active at the time of the Italian Armistice in September 1943 , but only consisted of the detachment staff and a few fighters , with the Dinara Battalion forming part of the 3rd Dalmatian Assault Brigade . 
 = = Commemoration = = 
 After the war , a public school was named after Borovčić @-@ Kurir . In 1962 , the 1st Split Partisan Detachment was commemorated with a 15 metres ( 49 feet 3 inches ) tall monument designed by <unk> <unk> , which was erected in <unk> where the captured members of the detachment were executed . The monument was destroyed by an explosion in August 1992 , during the Croatian War of Independence . It was renovated in 2009 with financial aid from the owners of the <unk> Split football club , as several members of the detachment had played for the club before the war . In 1981 , a monument dedicated to the detachment was placed in <unk> street in Split . In July 2013 , this monument was vandalized by unknown perpetrators who spray painted symbols of the Ustaše , swastikas , and the initials of the Croatian Civic Party ( Hrvatska <unk> stranka ; <unk> ) and the Croatian Pure Party of Rights ( Hrvatska <unk> stranka <unk> ; <unk> ) . This was the second time the monument had been damaged . A movie about the detachment , entitled Prvi splitski odred and directed by <unk> <unk> , was released in 1972 . 
 In August 2014 , the Mayor of Split Ivo Baldasar announced he would propose that the Split city council name a street in the Mejaši neighbourhood after the detachment . The initiative was met with opposition from the Mejaši district leaders , who stated that people living in Mejaši had a " different political orientation " and that such action would devalue the Croatian War of Independence and all of its values . The initiative was also met with opposition from the Croatian Democratic Union ( Hrvatska demokratska zajednica ; HDZ ) members of the council who accused Baldasar of " forging history " , because " the detachment was never Partisan , and its members didn 't die under Partisan insignia . " A HDZ council member explained that even during the existence of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , the street that was named after the detachment did not have the word Partisan in it . Members of the Organization of Anti @-@ fascists and Anti @-@ fascist Fighters of Split were also dissatisfied because the proposal was intended for a minor street at the edge of the city . Faced with this opposition , Baldasar withdrew his proposal during a council meeting on 25 August , explaining he couldn 't " allow arguments surrounding street names " .

 Demi 's Birthday Suit , or The Suit , was a trompe @-@ l 'œil body painting by Joanne Gair photographed by Annie Leibovitz that was featured on the cover of the Vanity Fair August 1992 issue to commemorate and exploit the success of Leibovitz 's More Demi Moore cover photo of Demi Moore one year earlier . As an example of modern body painting artwork , it raised the profile of Gair in pop culture as an artist in that genre . 
 The work is considered to be groundbreaking by some , although there is controversy surrounding its originality . The converse of this image serves as the cover to Gair 's second bodypainting book , Body Painting . The photo shoot also let Moore show off the results of her fitness regimen . 
 = = Artistic perspective = = 
 Gene Newman considers the body painting of Moore to be the introduction of modern body painting to the world . Although willing to credit Moore and Gair with the rebirth of bodypainting in a San Francisco Chronicle story , the " makeup artist , wig maker and stylist " Jim Ponder had difficulty calling interest in bodypainting a trend because it traces back to the " beginnings of man . " Joanne Gair has described the painting as a stylized reference to Botticelli , since the sinuous pose is reminiscent of the central figures in both Primavera and The Birth of Venus . The Amazon.com product description for Gair 's book calls her participation in this photoshoot as her " defining moment . " Soon after the release of the magazine Gair became such a pop culture icon that she was considered for an Absolut Vodka Absolut Gair ad campaign according to a story in The New York Times . The work is considered to be an example from the most sophisticated end of the bodypainting spectrum which extends all the way to Henna tattoos . 
 Some sources have claimed that the work is a derivative of preceding works . Playboy published a photo with similar bodypainting , with a necktie , suit jacket and similar pose , in its March 1968 issue , as part of a feature on bodypainting .

 Gair had worked with Leibovitz and Moore on More Demi Moore . Departing Vanity Fair editor Tina Brown felt " The only thing to do for the anniversary cover was to reprise it . " According to a Houston Chronicle story that quotes both Moore and Brown , about 100 million people had seen the earlier cover , and this cover capitalized on the anniversary . 
 They decided to attempt a body painting during the week @-@ long shoot at the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles , California in 1992 . Gair was provided with a pinstriped three @-@ piece suit by Richard Tyler as a model to paint onto Moore . Since in those days she did not generally work with assistants , the day started at 6 : 30 A.M. and Demi Moore slept that night in the painted @-@ on suit in case they needed to resume the next day . It took 15 hours to apply the suit because it was difficult for Gair to build the proper paint density . Moore 's body heat melted the paint . For the 1992 cover , which required a full @-@ day sitting for Gair and her team of make @-@ up artists , Leibovitz could not decide where to shoot , and " reserved two mobile homes , four hotel rooms and five houses " . Stylist Lori Goldstein assisted with the application . 
 Having started rigorous workouts in the final trimester of her pregnancy the year before to prepare for her role in A Few Good Men , Moore was physically fit for the photoshoot . Thus she appeared in additional nude photos within the magazine 's cover story . Moore viewed the photos as a chance to show off the results of her workouts : " I said I would get better with each baby and I have . " The weeklong effort also involved shots taken in Kauai , Hawaii that are included in Gair 's second book , Body Painting . Moore felt she looked better on the cover at age 29 than she had in a bikini nine years earlier in Blame It on Rio .

 Demi Moore had appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair exactly one year earlier in the August 1991 edition in Leibovitz 's photograph , More Demi Moore . As a groundbreaking work , the photograph of her pregnant pose was an iconic one for Moore , Leibovitz and women in general who now view public representation of pregnancy as socially acceptable . It had a cultural impact by causing numerous celebrities to pose for photographs in advanced pregnancy , which has made pregnancy photos fashionable and created a profitable business for photographers such as Jennifer Loomis . The American Society of Magazine Editors regards it as one of the best U.S. magazine covers ever , and it is one of Leibovitz ' best @-@ known works . Additionally , the photo served as a litmus test when Internet decency standards were first being legislated and adjudicated . 
 = Randolph , Tennessee = 
 Randolph is a rural unincorporated community in Tipton County , Tennessee , United States , located on the banks of the Mississippi River . Randolph was founded in the 1820s and in 1827 , the Randolph post office was established . In the 1830s , the town became an early center of river commerce in West Tennessee . Randolph shipped more cotton annually than Memphis until 1840 . In 1834 , the first pastor of the Methodist congregation was appointed . The fortunes of the community began to decline in the late 1840s due to failed railroad development , an unfavorable mail route and other factors . The first Confederate States Army fort in Tennessee was built at Randolph early in the Civil War in 1861 , a second fortification at Randolph was constructed later that same year . During the Civil War , the town was burned down twice by Union Army forces . 
 The settlement is located on the second Chickasaw Bluff , the landscape is dominated by valleys carved into the soil as a product of erosion . The surface soil is composed mostly of silt loam , derived from eroded loess , and is found in different qualities and at different stages of erosion . The stratum beneath the surface consists of glacial gravel . Randolph is situated on the southeastern edge of the New Madrid Seismic Zone , an area with a high earthquake risk . Between 1974 and 2004 , forty @-@ five earthquakes were recorded in a radius of 20 miles ( 32 km ) around the settlement . Located in the humid subtropical climate zone , the climate is characterized by hot , humid summers and chilly to mild winters . 
 In 2008 , Randolph Bluff Historic Park was dedicated . The park is intended to promote the Civil War history of the community and make the unique views of the Mississippi River available to a wider public . As of 2008 , Randolph has a population of about 200 and consists of about two dozen dwellings . The economy of the rural community is dominated by agriculture with no major industries and businesses present . The Girl Scouts Heart of the South operates a camp at Randolph . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = European settlement = = = 
 Around 1800 , Europeans began settling the land east of the Mississippi River that was inhabited by the Chickasaw Indians for centuries prior to the arrival of Europeans . Chickasaw land in West Tennessee and southwestern Kentucky was ceded in the Jackson Purchase . In 1818 , both sides agreed to the transfer by signing the Treaty of Tuscaloosa . 
 In the early 19th century , the terrain of the Chickasaw Bluffs provided promising locations for a harbor on the Mississippi River for Randolph . In 1820 , the area had an estimated population of 54 . Early in the 1820s , investors John T. Brown and Robert Bedford were the owners of the land that would form Randolph a few years later . Only 40 – 50 miles ( 60 – 80 km ) north of Memphis by water , they described the area as " a good landing for Mississippi River flatboats " . The Hatchie River , joining the Mississippi River just north of Randolph , was accessible to steamboats upriver to Bolivar . Brown and Bedford chose the site to lay out the plan for Randolph , a promising river town . The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture gives the date of Randolph 's official establishment as 1823 . Other reports date the foundation to 1827 or 1828 . The settlement is named for John Randolph ( 1773 – 1833 ) , a leader in the United States Congress from Virginia .

 Located on the banks of the Mississippi River , the topography of Randolph provided for an ideal harbor for steamboats and flatboats at all river stages . Randolph became the center of steamboat commerce in Tennessee . The town was an early rival of Memphis over commercial superiority on the Mississippi River . In 1830 , Randolph was the most important shipping point in Tennessee . In the mid @-@ 1830s , Randolph shipped up to 40 @,@ 000 bales of cotton on the Mississippi River every year . More cotton was shipped from Randolph than from Memphis until 1840 . At the peak of its commercial success , the community was called the " great steamboat depot of West Tennessee " . 
 By 1829 , Randolph had three commission warehouses , six dry goods stores , ten physicians and one tavern . In 1834 , Randolph had a population of approximately 1 @,@ 000 . By that time , the town had four hotels , almost fifty businesses , private schools , and more than ten saloons . In the 1830s , two newspapers were published in Randolph , the Randolph Recorder and the Randolph Whig . In the 1830s , the first bank was founded and a stagecoach line provided a connection between Randolph and Jackson twice a week . The commercial success of Randolph can be attributed in part to the use of slave labor , mostly for the cultivation of cotton . Corn , beans and peas were also cultivated . In the Randolph Recorder during the early 1830s , landowners announced public auctions of slaves or offered rewards for runaway or stolen slaves . 
 = = = = Decline = = = = 
 The fortunes of Randolph declined in the later 1840s and the 1850s due to many factors , starting shortly after the establishment of the town . Five years after the settlement was founded , a dispute over the ownership of the land the town was established on , arose over a faulty land title with land owner Ann <unk> from New York . Until 1835 , the pending lawsuit " prevented the growth of population " in and around Randolph . The residents of the community bought back the land their town was founded on for $ 8 @,@ 000 in a settlement . 
 An unfavorable mail line also had an early and lasting influence on the fortunes of the town . When the mail route was established in 1829 , Randolph was put at the end of a branch route of the mail line and received mail only once a week . Failed railroad development further contributed to the demise of the town ; and in 1852 , residents of Randolph unsuccessfully tried to move the county seat from Covington to Randolph . Financial depression and David Crockett 's failed attempt to cut a canal from the Hatchie River to the Tennessee River also were problems that had a negative impact on the future of commercial prosperity in Randolph . During the Civil War , the town was burned down twice , in September 1862 and again in 1865 , discouraging many residents from re @-@ building residences and businesses a second time .

 Fort Wright was the first Confederate Army fortification built at Randolph . On January 20 , 1861 , the Memphis Appeal published a pro @-@ secessionist proposal to build a fort at Randolph to defend Memphis . In April 1861 , Tennessee Governor Isham G. Harris ordered to establish a camp and complete the fortification at Randolph . About 5 @,@ 000 troops from Tennessee , Arkansas and the Confederate Army were stationed at the location to accomplish the task . By June 1861 , fifty cannons were reported to be ready at Fort Wright . 
 Nathan Bedford Forrest ( 1821 – 77 ) trained at Fort Wright . Forrest and other future leaders in the Confederate States Army and the Army of Tennessee received training at Fort Wright . The fort was Tennessee 's first military training camp in which soldiers could gain experience in the construction of fortifications and the setup of artillery batteries . Fort Wright was the forwardmost defensive position on the Mississippi River until July 1861 . In 2008 , only a powder magazine is left of Fort Wright . 
 Fort Randolph , the second Confederate stronghold in the area during the Civil War , was constructed in Fall 1861 . The fortification was situated on the Mississippi River bluffs , about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) southwest of Fort Wright . In a dispatch published by the New York Times in March 1862 , Fort Randolph is described as a " rough and incomplete earthwork ( ... ) , more than 100 feet above the river " . The position of the fortification allowed a view of the Mississippi River for 6 miles ( 10 km ) , both upstream and downstream . In 2008 , Fort Randolph is no longer in existence .

 In 1862 , Union Army Major General William T. Sherman ( 1820 – 91 ) and his troops assumed control of Memphis and the surrounding areas . While trying to keep the area under Union control , Sherman became " frustrated by the constant guerrilla activity in his sector " . Confederate guerrillas from the Randolph area weakened the Union forces along the Mississippi River . 
 In September 1862 , the Union supply ship Eugene was fired at from Randolph . Sherman ordered to " destroy the place , leaving one house to mark the place " . Union Army soldiers burned down Randolph in retaliation for the guerrilla attack . To his superior officer , General Ulysses S. Grant , Sherman reported that he had " given public notice that a repetition [ of guerrilla attacks ] will justify any measures of retaliation " . Randolph was burned down a second time by federal soldiers in 1865 .

 Randolph is located at 35 ° 30 ′ 59 ″ N 89 ° 53 ′ 19 ″ W. The elevation above sea level is 315 feet ( 96 m ) . 
 The surface soil in the Randolph area is composed mostly of silt loam of different qualities and at different stages of erosion . About 15 % of the surface soil consists of " Adler silt loam " with a slope of 0 – 1 % , found in the frequently flooded plains at Randolph . About 20 % of the soil is severely eroded " Memphis silt loam " with 12 – 25 % slopes , and ca . 35 % of the soil consists of " Memphis silt loam " with 20 – 40 % slopes . Less than 8 % consists of moderately eroded " Memphis silt loam " with slopes from 1 – 5 % . The remaining surface soil is composed of other silts , sands or clays , including " <unk> fine sandy loam " ( ca . 6 % ) and " Tunica clay " ( ca . 1 @.@ 5 % ) . Approximately 1 @.@ 5 % of the area is covered by water . The parent material of the " Memphis silt loam " is Pleistocene loess . Loess is a fine @-@ grained , slightly coherent , silty , windblown sediment . Eroded loess consists of extremely fine , sandy particles and forms silt in environments that provide sufficient moisture of the soil , usually caused by occasional flooding or precipitation .

 The settlement of Randolph is situated on top of the second Chickasaw Bluff , on the eastern bank of the Mississippi River in Tipton County . The four Chickasaw Bluffs are high grounds above the Mississippi River flood plains , composed of eroded pre @-@ historic loess over glacial gravel . The Chickasaw Bluffs west of the community , on the banks of the Mississippi River , and flat cotton @-@ fields east of Randolph dominate the rural landscape surrounding the settlement . 
 In the last 150 years , the general landscape around Randolph has not changed much . In 1862 , the hinterland of the town is described to be " full of ravines and gorges " . Ravines and gorges are valleys or canyons carved from the landscape as a product of erosion , caused by a stream or river or by seasonal precipitation , funneling water towards less elevated locations of the drainage basin . The landscape cut into the soil of the Mississippi River bluffs by water erosion for centuries is still present in modern times .

 In 1833 , a stagecoach road from Randolph to Jackson in Madison County , 70 miles ( 100 km ) east of Randolph , was established . The antebellum route connected the two towns as well as the villages along the way two times per week . Randolph and Memphis were connected by a direct travel route later in the 1830s . The road was part of a mail line between Jackson and Memphis in Shelby County on which mail was delivered weekly on horseback . The exact routing of the segment between Randolph and Memphis is unknown . A fragment of the route bearing the former name , about 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) in length , was in existence until about 2005 . The remaining piece of Old Randolph Road was located about 2 miles ( 3 km ) north of the mouth of the Wolf River and 800 feet ( 240 m ) east of the Mississippi River , just south of the mouth of the Loosahatchie River in Memphis . As of 2010 , the remaining fragment of Old Randolph Road is destroyed , the land on which the historic mail route was located is used as an industrial property . A publication dated 1862 , reports that Randolph is " approached in the rear by several good roads " . 
 In 2008 , Randolph is located near " good roads " as well as it was during the Civil War , with the exception that modern roads in the area are paved for the most part . U.S. Route 51 passes Randolph 5 miles ( 8 km ) in the southeast and Tennessee State Route 59 ( TN 59 ) passes 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 800 m ) southeast of the town .

 Randolph is located on the eastern bank of the Mississippi River , just south of the lower mouth of the Hatchie River . In the 1820s , the Hatchie River at Randolph was accessible to steamboats for 60 miles ( 100 km ) upriver to Bolivar in Hardeman County . 
 The United States Army Corps of Engineers ( USACE ) is the federal agency responsible for navigable waters and flood protection , among many other peacetime and wartime tasks . From 2005 to 2007 , the USACE spent $ 9 @,@ 773 @,@ 662 to ensure the navigation of the Mississippi River at Randolph for boats and barges and to provide flood protection for the immediately surrounding areas of the town . Contracts include surveying and mapping , engineering and construction , as well as tasks related to conservation and development of the Mississippi River and the river basin at Randolph .

 Agriculture is the predominating source of income in the area surrounding Randolph , especially the cultivation of cotton . Corn , beans and peas were also cultivated during the last century . After the abolition of slavery in 1865 , sharecropping was the primary means of income for low income families in the area . Mostly for the cultivation of cotton , land would be used by sharecroppers in return for a share of the crop to the landowner . Modern machines such as the cotton picker have made the manual cultivation obsolete over time as they took over the work from the manual laborers .

 = New York State Route 239 = 
 New York State Route 239 ( NY 239 ) was a state highway in eastern Erie County , New York , in United States . The southern terminus of the route was at an intersection with NY 354 in Marilla . Its northern terminus was at a junction with U.S. Route 20 ( US 20 ) in the village of Alden . NY 239 was about 3 miles ( 5 km ) in length and named Exchange Street . When NY 239 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , it extended eastward to the Wyoming County village of Attica . NY 239 was truncated to Marilla in 1949 and removed from the state highway system completely in September 1980 as a result of a highway maintenance swap between the state of New York and Erie County earlier that year . The roadway is now County Route 578 ( CR 578 ) . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 239 began at an intersection with NY 354 just west of the Erie – Wyoming county line in the town of Marilla . The route then traveled to the northeast , climbing in elevation as it proceeded onward . It then made a turn to the north , descending in elevation . Running at about a height of 900 feet ( 270 m ) above sea level , NY 239 crossed into the town of Alden and continued toward downtown . NY 239 continued northward , passing nearby <unk> Road , a connector between NY 239 and County Line Road , which ran parallel to NY 239 along the Erie – Genesee county line . The route dipped further in elevation , entering the village of Alden . Inside the village , it passed the Buffalo Water Filtration Plant to the west and crossed the Conrail @-@ owned Buffalo Line . NY 239 passed through a primarily residential area of the village just before terminating at US 20 in the village center .

NY 354 was extended eastward on January 1 , 1949 , over NY 239 's alignment to a new terminus in Attica . As a result , NY 239 was truncated to its junction with NY 354 in the town of Marilla . 
 On April 1 , 1980 , ownership and maintenance of NY 239 was transferred from the state of New York to Erie County as part of a larger highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government .

 = Hebron glass = 
 Hebron Glass ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> , <unk> al @-@ Khalili ) refers to glass produced in Hebron as part of a flourishing art industry established in the city during Roman rule in Palestine . Hebron 's Old City still contains a quarter named the " Glass @-@ Blower Quarter " and Hebron glass continues to serve as a tourist attraction for the city . 
 Traditionally , the glass was melted using local raw materials , including sand from neighbouring villages , sodium carbonate ( from the Dead Sea ) , and coloring additives such as iron oxide and copper oxide . Nowadays , recycled glass is often used instead . Glass production in Hebron is a family trade , the secrets of which have been preserved and passed down by a few Palestinian families who operate the glass factories located just outside the city . The products made include glass jewellery , such as beads , bracelets , and rings , as well as stained glass windows , and glass lamps . However , due to the Palestinian @-@ Israeli conflict , glass production has suffered a decline . 
 = = History = = 
 The glass industry in Hebron was established during Roman rule in Palestine ( 63 BCE @-@ 330 CE ) . As the ancient Phoenician glass industry shrank from the exposed cities along the eastern Mediterranean coastline , the industry migrated inland , to Hebron in particular . Glass artifacts from Hebron dating to the 1st and 2nd centuries have been found , and are on exhibit as part of the Drake Collection . Stained glass windows made of Hebron glass dating to the 12th century are found in the structure built over the Cave of <unk> , which served as a church during the Crusader era in Palestine . Another example of stained glass windows produced in Hebron are those adorning the Dome of the Rock in the Old City of Jerusalem . 
 " Hebron ’ s medieval reputation in glassmaking is corroborated by some of the many Christian pilgrims who visited the city over the centuries . Between 1345 and 1350 , Franciscan monk Niccolò da <unk> noted that “ they make great works of art in glass . ” In the late 15th century , the German friar Felix Faber and his companions also stopped in this “ exceeding ancient city , ” and he described how “ we came forth from our inn , and passed through the long street of the city , in which work @-@ people of divers crafts dwelt , but more particularly workers in glass ; for at this place glass is made , not clear glass , but black , and of the colors between dark and light . ” 
 While acknowledging that the production of glass in Palestine dates back to Roman period , <unk> Ju <unk> , director of <unk> : Centre for Architectural Conservation , contends that the practices of today 's glass industry in Hebron most likely emerged in the 13th century CE . This corresponds to what foreigners observed , like Jacques de Vitry who around 1080 mentioned Acre and Tyre , ( but not Hebron ) , as glass @-@ producing cities , while by 1483 , when Felix Fabri visited the city , he described passing " through the long street of the city , in which work @-@ people of divers crafts dwelt , but <unk> workers in glass ; for at this place glass is made , not clear glass , but black , and of the colours between dark and light . " 
 Ju <unk> notes that an alternate theory assigns today 's techniques to the Venetian glass tradition and that still other researchers claim they were already extant at the time of the Crusades and were carried back to Europe from Hebron , possibly originating in Syria . 
 Glass produced by these factories were typically functional items including drinking and eating vessels , as well as olive oil and later petrol @-@ based lamps , although the factories also produced jewellery and accessories . Bedouins pf the Negev ( <unk> ) , the Arabian Desert , and Sinai were the primary purchasers of jewellery , but large exports of expensive Hebron glass items were sent by guarded camel caravans to Egypt , Syria , and the Transjordan . Marketing communities of Hebron glass were established in al @-@ Karak ( Crac ) in southern Jordan and Cairo in Egypt by the 16th century . 
 The glass industry was a principal employer and a generator of wealth for its owners . Well known for glass production throughout the Arab world , Western travellers to Palestine in the 19th century provided descriptions of the Hebron glass industry as well . For example , Ulrich Jasper <unk> noted during his travels in Palestine in 1807 @-@ 09 that 150 persons were employed in the glass industry in Hebron , while later , in A New and Complete History of the Holy Bible as Contained in the Old and New Testaments ( 1844 ) , Robert Sears writes , " The population of Hebron is considerable : the inhabitants manufacture glass lamps , which are exported to Egypt . Provisions are abundant , and there is a considerable number of shops . " 
 Later in the century , the production declined due to competition from imported European glass @-@ ware . However , the products of Hebron continued to be sold , particularly among the poorer populace , particularly by travelling Jewish traders from the city . At the World Fair of 1873 in Vienna , Hebron was represented with glass ornaments . A report from the French consul in 1886 suggests that glass @-@ making remained an important source of income for Hebron with four factories making 60 @,@ 000 francs per annum . 
 The tradition of glassblowing continues in the 21st century in three factories located outside of the traditional quarter of the Old City , north of Hebron and south of the neighboring town of <unk> which generally produce functional household souvenirs . Two of the factories are owned by the <unk> family . These are displayed in large halls close to each of the factories . 
 Hebron glass is an attraction for both domestic and foreign tourists . Today , however , due to ongoing export problems , the decline in tourism , and restrictions on Palestinian freedom of movement in the aftermath of the Second Intifada , industry production has suffered . According to <unk> al @-@ Ju 'bah , the director of <unk> : Centre for Architectural Conservation , under these circumstances , the survival of the Hebron glass industry is in question . 
 = = Production = = 
 Hebron glass was traditionally produced using sand from the village of Bani Na 'im , east of Hebron , and sodium carbonate taken from the Dead Sea . Instead of sand , recycled glass is the primary raw material used to make Hebron glass today . 
 The precise production process is a trade secret maintained by the few Palestinian families who run the factories which continue to produce Hebron glass today , passed through generations by apprenticing children . As one master of the craft said , " You can learn to play the ' oud at any age , but unless you begin [ glasswork ] as a child , you will never become a master . " 
 According to the Holy Land Handicraft Cooperative Society , the blowing technique employed is the same as was used by the ancient Phoenicians , though archaeologists and historians of glass agree that glassblowing was not common until the last few centuries BCE . Molten glass is withdrawn from a furnace on the end of an iron pipe , which is blown into as a metal tool called a <unk> is used to shape the glass . It is returned to the furnace and reshaped by the same process before being detached from the pipe and placed into a cooling chamber . 
 = = Jewellery = = 
 Glass beads for jewellery have traditionally been made in Hebron . Blue beads and glass beads with ' eyes ' ( <unk> ) were made for use as amulets since they were considered particularly effective against the evil @-@ eye . In the Museum of Mankind collections , there exist several glass necklaces that were made in Hebron during the Mandate period or earlier . Besides necklaces made of blue and green beads , and ' eyes ' beads , there are examples of beads of small hands , also called a Hamsa , representing the hand of Fatimah , the daughter of the prophet Muhammad . Most of a woman 's jewellery was given to her at marriage ; in the early 1920s , in Bayt <unk> , a glass bracelet ( <unk> ) made in Hebron would be considered a necessary part of the jewellery of a bride 's trousseau .

 In 1799 , English traveller William George Browne mentioned the production of " Coarse glass beads ... called Hersh and <unk> " in Palestine ; The " <unk> " ( <unk> ) were large beads , while the Hersh ( Harish ) were smaller . These Hebron glass beads were used for trade , and export primarily to Africa from the early to mid @-@ 19th century . Spread throughout West Africa , in Kano , Nigeria , they were grounded on the edges to make round beads fit together on a strand more suitably . There , they picked up the name " Kano Beads " , although they were not originally produced in Kano . By the 1930s , their value had decreased ; in 1937 , A. J. Arkell recorded the beads being sold " for a song " by Sudanese women to Hausa traders in <unk> .

 The University of California , Riverside ( UCR or UC Riverside ) , is a public research university and one of the 10 general campuses of the University of California system . The main campus sits on 1 @,@ 900 acres ( 769 ha ) in a suburban district of Riverside , California , United States , with a branch campus of 20 acres ( 8 ha ) in Palm Desert . Founded in 1907 as the UC Citrus Experiment Station , Riverside pioneered research in biological pest control and the use of growth regulators responsible for extending the citrus growing season in California from four to nine months . Some of the world 's most important research collections on citrus diversity and entomology , as well as science fiction and photography , are located at Riverside . 
 UCR 's undergraduate College of Letters and Science opened in 1954 . The Regents of the University of California declared UCR a general campus of the system in 1959 , and graduate students were admitted in 1961 . To accommodate an enrollment of 21 @,@ 000 students by 2015 , more than $ 730 million has been invested in new construction projects since 1999 . Preliminary accreditation of the UC Riverside School of Medicine granted in October 2012 and the first class of 50 students was enrolled in August 2013 . It is the first new research @-@ based public medical school in 40 years . 
 UCR is consistently ranked as one of the most ethnically and economically diverse universities in the United States . The 2016 U.S. News & World Report Best Colleges rankings places UCR tied for 58th among top public universities , tied for 121st nationwide and ranks 16 + graduate school programs including the Graduate School of Education and the Bourns College of Engineering based on peer assessment , student selectivity , financial resources , and other factors . Washington Monthly ranked UCR 2nd in the United States in terms of social mobility , research and community service , while U.S. News ranks UCR as the fifth most ethnically diverse and , by the number of undergraduates receiving Pell Grants ( 42 percent ) , the 15th most economically diverse student body in the nation . Nearly two @-@ thirds of all UCR students graduate within six years without regard to economic disparity . UCR 's extensive outreach and retention programs have contributed to its reputation as a " campus of choice " for minority students , including LGBT students . In 2005 , UCR became the first public university campus in the nation to offer a gender @-@ neutral housing option . 
 UCR 's sports teams are known as the Highlanders and play in the Big West Conference of the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) Division I. Their nickname was inspired by the high altitude of the campus , which lies on the foothills of Box Springs Mountain . The UCR women 's basketball team won back to back Big West championships in 2006 and 2007 . In 2007 , the men 's baseball team won its first conference championship and advanced to the regionals for the second time since the university moved to Division I in 2001 . 
 = = History = = 
 At the turn of the 20th century , Southern California was a major producer of citrus , the region 's primary agricultural export . The industry developed from the country 's first navel orange trees , planted in Riverside in 1873 . <unk> by the citrus industry , the UC Regents established the UC Citrus Experiment Station ( CES ) on February 14 , 1907 , on 23 acres ( 9 ha ) of land on the east slope of Mount <unk> in Riverside . The station conducted experiments in fertilization , irrigation and crop improvement . In 1917 , the station was moved to a larger site , 475 acres ( 192 ha ) near Box Springs Mountain . 
 The 1944 passage of the GI Bill during World War II set in motion a rise in college enrollments that necessitated an expansion of the state university system in California . A local group of citrus growers and civic leaders , including many UC Berkeley alumni , lobbied aggressively for a UC @-@ administered liberal arts college next to the CES . State Senator Nelson Dilworth , former Assemblyman Philip L. Boyd and Riverside State Assemblyman John Babbage were instrumental in shepherding the legislation through the State Legislature . Governor Earl Warren signed the bill in 1949 , allocating $ 2 million for initial campus construction . 
 Gordon S. Watkins , dean of the College of Letters and Science at UCLA , became the first provost of the new college at Riverside . Initially conceived of as a small college devoted to the liberal arts , he ordered the campus built for a maximum of 1 @,@ 500 students and recruited many young junior faculty to fill teaching positions . He presided at its opening with 65 faculty and 127 students on February 14 , 1954 , remarking , " Never have so few been taught by so many . " 
 UCR 's enrollment exceeded 1 @,@ 000 students by the time Clark Kerr became president of the UC system in 1958 . Anticipating a " tidal wave " in enrollment growth required by the baby boom generation , Kerr developed the California Master Plan for Higher Education and the Regents designated Riverside a general university campus in 1959 . UCR 's first chancellor , Herman Theodore Spieth , oversaw the beginnings of the school 's transition to a full university and its expansion to a capacity of 5 @,@ 000 students . UCR 's second chancellor , Ivan Hinderaker led the campus through the era of the free speech movement and kept student protests peaceful in Riverside . According to a 1998 interview with Hinderaker , the city of Riverside received negative press coverage for smog after the mayor asked Governor Ronald Reagan to declare the South Coast Air Basin a disaster area in 1971 ; subsequent student enrollment declined by up to 25 % through 1979 . Hinderaker 's development of innovative programs in business administration and biomedical sciences created incentive for enough students to enroll at Riverside to keep the campus open . 
 In the 1990s , the UC experienced a new surge of enrollment applications , now known as " Tidal Wave II " . The Regents targeted UCR for an annual growth rate of 6 @.@ 3 % , the fastest in the UC system , and anticipated 19 @,@ 900 students at UCR by 2010 . By 1995 , African American , American Indian , and Latino student enrollments accounted for 30 % of the UCR student body , the highest proportion of any UC campus at the time . The 1997 implementation of Proposition 209 — which banned the use of affirmative action by state agencies — reduced the ethnic diversity at the more selective UC campuses but further increased it at UCR . 
 With UCR scheduled for dramatic population growth , efforts have been made to increase its popular and academic recognition . The students voted for a fee increase to move UCR athletics into NCAA Division I standing in 1998 . In the 1990s , proposals were made to establish a law school , a medical school , and a school of public policy at UCR , with the UCR School of Medicine and the School of Public Policy becoming reality in 2012 . In June 2006 , UCR received its largest gift , 15 @.@ 5 million from two local couples , in trust towards building its medical school . The Regents formally approved UCR 's medical school proposal in 2006 . Projected to be completed by 2013 , it will be the first new medical school in 40 years built in California .

 UCR 's main campus sits at an elevation of 1 @,@ 100 ft ( 340 m ) to 1 @,@ 450 ft ( 440 m ) near Box Springs Mountain , 3 miles ( 5 km ) east of downtown Riverside , and comprises 1 @,@ 112 acres ( 450 ha ) divided into eastern and western areas by the State Route 60 freeway . 
 East Campus , occupying approximately 600 acres ( 243 ha ) , hosts the core cluster of academic buildings and services . The original buildings that formed the earliest kernel of the campus included the UC Citrus Experiment Station , residential buildings , and barn , all of which are still in use . They were designed by Lester H. Hibbard , in association with H.B. Cody . Built by 1917 at a cost of $ 165 @,@ 000 , the architecture of the major buildings followed the Mission Revival style suggesting the Spanish colonial heritage of Southern California . 
 Further major construction largely ceased on the site until the groundbreaking for the College of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences ( <unk> ) in April 1951 . A group of five buildings designed by different architects in a decidedly more Modern style were completed by 1954 : the Rivera Library , Webber Hall , Geology Building , Physical Education Building and Watkins Hall . After the Regents declared UCR a " general campus " of the UC system in 1958 , many new buildings and additions were laid out over the following decade . Following an east – west axis , new student residence halls and athletic facilities were developed along the southeastern quadrant of the main campus , while academic and research facilities were built along the central campus area closer to the freeway . The Bell Tower , one of only five carillons in California , was built in this period . Designed by A. Quincy Jones , the tower is 161 ft ( 49 m ) tall and contains 48 bells , each weighing from 28 pounds ( 13 kg ) to 5 @,@ 091 pounds ( 2 @,@ 309 kg ) , covering four chromatic octaves . 
 After the drop in enrollment and subsequent restructuring of academic programs in the 1970s , little capacity construction was undertaken over the next two decades . However , enrollment growth in the late 1980s justified considerable further campus expansion over the 1990s . Major additions built in the period include : Bourns Hall , completed in 1995 ; the Humanities & Social Science building , completed in 1996 ; and the Science Library , completed in 1998 . The Pentland and Stonehaven residence halls were completed in 2000 , and the Arts building was completed in 2001 . Active construction projects include new buildings for Engineering and Materials Science , Psychology Research , and Genomics . The first phase of a new Commons was completed in 2007 , and phase II is in development . Other ongoing projects include a new <unk> Instructional and Research Center and Students Academic Support Services Building . Since 1999 , more than $ 730 million has been invested in construction projects . 
 Of the 511 acres ( 207 ha ) of UCR property constituting West Campus , approximately 216 acres ( 87 ha ) along University Avenue have been developed . These include facilities such as University Extension , the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) Germplasm Repository , International Village ( student housing ) , Human Resources and Highlander Hall . University Village , a mixed use commercial development , features a movie theater , stores , restaurants , office space , and an apartment complex , along with a parking structure and surface parking . Citrus groves and row crops occupy the remaining 295 acres ( 119 ha ) stretching northwest to the intersection of Chicago Avenue and Le Conte Drive . Plans for future expansion include converting a portion of these fields into new UCR infrastructure . 
 The University of California , Riverside , has recently united its three downtown arts presentation venues under the umbrella name of the UCR <unk> . The <unk> is composed of the UCR / California Museum of Photography , The Sweeney Art Gallery , and the Culver Center of the Arts , a media lab and presentation facility .

Initially funded by a $ 6 million gift from Richard J. Heckmann , a water treatment entrepreneur , the institution was planned as a teaching and research center of the A. Gary Anderson Graduate School of Management at the UCR School of Business Administration . The center encourages local entrepreneurship through the Coachella Valley Angel Network , an angel investment network . A further investment of $ 10 million from the State of California and a donation of 20 acres ( 8 ha ) of land from the City of Palm Desert allowed for the opening of an expanded graduate center on April 15 , 2005 , adjacent to the California State University , San Bernardino Palm Desert Campus . The center is also home to university researchers in conservation biology , technology transfer and Native American studies . Master 's level instruction in business management and creative writing is available at the center .

 As a campus of the University of California system , UCR is governed by a Board of Regents and administered by a president . The current president is Janet Napolitano , and the administrative head of UCR is Kim Wilcox . UCR 's academic policies are set by its Academic Senate , a legislative body composed of all UCR faculty members . 
 UCR is organized into four academic colleges , two professional schools , and several interdisciplinary divisions . UCR 's liberal arts college , the College of Humanities , Arts and Social Sciences , was founded in 1954 , and began accepting graduate students in 1960 . The College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences , founded in 1960 , incorporated the CES as part of the first research @-@ oriented institution at UCR ; it eventually also incorporated the natural science departments formerly associated with the liberal arts college to form its present structure in 1974 . UCR 's newest academic unit , the Bourns College of Engineering , was founded in 1989 . Comprising the professional schools are the Graduate School of Education , founded in 1968 , and the UCR School of Business Administration , founded in 1970 . These units collectively provide 81 majors and 52 minors , 48 master 's degree programs , and 42 Doctor of Philosophy ( PhD ) programs . UCR is the only UC campus to offer undergraduate degrees in creative writing and public policy and one of three <unk> ( along with Berkeley and Irvine ) to offer an undergraduate degree in business administration . Through its Division of Biomedical Sciences , founded in 1974 , UCR offers the Thomas Haider medical degree program in collaboration with UCLA . UCR 's doctoral program in the emerging field of dance theory , founded in 1992 , was the first program of its kind in the United States , and UCR 's minor in lesbian , gay and bisexual studies , established in 1996 , was the first undergraduate program of its kind in the UC system . A new BA program in bagpipes was inaugurated in 2007 .

In the 2016 edition of U.S. News & World Report 's " America 's Best Colleges " , UCR was ranked tied for 121st among national universities ; criteria include professor peer assessment , student selectivity and retention , as well as faculty resources , financial resources , and alumni giving . In the 2015 edition of the Washington Monthly college rankings , UCR ranked 2nd among national universities . Washington Monthly assesses the quality of schools based on social mobility ( recruiting and graduating low @-@ income students ) , research ( producing cutting @-@ edge scholarship and PhDs ) , and service ( encouraging students to give something back to their country ) . Money magazine ranked UC Riverside 150th in the country out of the nearly 1500 schools it evaluated for its 2014 Best Colleges ranking . The Daily Beast ranked UC Riverside 153rd in the country out of the nearly 2000 schools it evaluated for its 2013 Best Colleges ranking . According to the Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index published by Academic Analytics in 2006 , UCR as an institution ranked 46th among top research universities considering such criteria as faculty publications , citations , research funding and other honors . Since 1997 , more than 110 UCR faculty members have been elected fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science . Over the course of UCR 's history , seven current or former faculty members have been elected to the National Academy of Sciences , and more than 50 have received Guggenheim Fellowships .

 UCR operated under a $ 435 million budget in fiscal year 2005 – 06 . The state government provided $ 153 million , student fees accounted for $ 111 million , the federal government financed $ 84 million , and $ 45 million came from university sales and services . Private support and other sources accounted for the remaining $ 18 million . Overall , monies spent at UCR have an economic impact of nearly $ 1 billion in California . Faculty members received nearly $ 87 million in research funding in 2005 – 06 , mostly from federal agencies such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health . Total research expenditures at Riverside are significantly concentrated in agricultural science , accounting for 53 % of total research expenditures spent by the university in 2002 . Top research centers by expenditure , as measured in 2002 , include the Agricultural Experiment Station , the Center for Environmental Research and Technology , the Center for Bibliographical Studies , the Air Pollution Research Center , and the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics . 
 Throughout UCR 's history , researchers have developed more than 40 new citrus varieties and invented new techniques to help the $ 960 million @-@ a @-@ year California citrus industry fight pests and diseases . In 1927 , entomologists at the CES introduced two wasps from Australia as natural enemies of a major citrus pest , the <unk> mealybug , saving growers in Orange County $ 1 million in annual losses . This event was pivotal in establishing biological control as a practical means of reducing pest populations . In 1963 , plant physiologist Charles Coggins proved that application of gibberellic acid allows fruit to remain on citrus trees for extended periods . The ultimate result of his work , which continued through the 1980s , was the extension of the citrus @-@ growing season in California from four to nine months . In 1980 , UC Riverside released the <unk> grapefruit , its first patented citrus variety . Since then , the citrus breeding program has released other varieties such as the <unk> grapefruit , the Gold Nugget mandarin ( or tangerine ) , and others that have yet to be given trademark names . To assist entrepreneurs in developing new products , UCR is a primary partner in the Riverside Regional Technology Park , which includes the City of Riverside and the County of Riverside . It also administers six reserves of the University of California Natural Reserve System . UCR recently announced a partnership with China Agricultural University to launch a new center in Beijing , which will study ways to respond to the country 's growing environmental issues . UCR can also boast the birthplace of two name reactions in organic chemistry , the Castro @-@ Stephens coupling and the Midland Alpine <unk> Reduction .

On November 3 , 2009 , the Science library was officially renamed the Raymond L. Orbach Science Library in honor of former Chancellor Raymond L. Orbach . Smaller libraries include the Media and Cultural Library , the Music Library , and a branch digital library in Palm Desert . The UCR Library is one of 116 members of the Association of Research Libraries , and is ranked 93rd in this group . 
 UCR 's academic colleges administer significant museum collections in the arts and sciences . The Citrus Variety Collection constitutes 1 @,@ 800 trees representing two of each of the 640 types of Citrus and 28 other related genera in the Rutaceae family , the largest such collection in the world . The Herbarium houses more than 110 @,@ 000 dried plant specimens from across the Western hemisphere . UCR is also home to 40 acres ( 16 ha ) of botanical gardens containing more than 3 @,@ 500 plant species from around the world . The Gardens are located in the eastern foothills of the Box Springs Mountain on the University of California , Riverside campus . Over four miles ( 6 km ) of trails wind through many microclimates and hilly terrain . The Entomology Research Museum contains more than three million insect specimens , with particular strengths in Hymenoptera , <unk> , <unk> , Thysanoptera and <unk> . The UCR / California Museum of Photography and Sweeney Art Gallery house UCR 's primary art collections .

 = = Student life = = 
 Much of the student life on campus revolves around extensive local outreach and retention programs . Riverside enrolls the highest percentage of African American students of any of the 10 UC campuses and the second highest percentage of Latino students after Merced , prompting the Los Angeles Times and New York Times to run stories stating that UCR is a " campus of choice " for minority students . UCR was the first college in California to open a staffed lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) resource center in 1993 , the first UC campus to offer a LGBT minor studies program in 1996 , and the first campus in the nation to offer a gender @-@ neutral housing option in 2005 . In recognition of this , The Advocate recognized UCR as one of the nation 's best campuses for LGBT students in 2006 , although it did not make the top 20 . The Princeton Review listed UCR as a " Best Western College . " While over 83 percent of students are non @-@ white , there is a tendency for the different ethnic groups to self @-@ segregate . 
 = = = Housing = = = 
 UCR 's residence halls consist of three structures — Aberdeen @-@ Inverness , Lothian , and Pentland Hills — which as of 2002 housed 2 @,@ 930 students in triple , double and single rooms . In addition , UCR features several on @-@ campus apartment complexes such as Stonehaven , Bannockburn Village , University Plaza , Falkirk , Oban , Glen Mor and International Village , which together house 959 students . UCR also offers student family housing at Canyon Crest , a low @-@ density residential community that serves 268 and is slated for demolition to make room for higher @-@ density residence halls . Glen Mor , an apartment housing complex adjacent to Pentland Hills , was opened in 2007 , and the university also purchased a nearby apartment complex , which is now known as Falkirk , for student housing in 2007 . About half of the student population lives in off @-@ campus apartments , one @-@ fourth commute , and one @-@ fourth live on campus . Thirty percent of students remain on campus for the weekend . 
 Reflecting UCR 's diversity , a number of residence halls have been established for specific social , cultural and academic needs . Ethnic and gender @-@ oriented theme halls include <unk> a Mundo , for students seeking to support Latino or Chicano students in <unk> to life at UCR ; a Pan African Theme Hall for students interested in developing consciousness of African culture in relation to other cultures of the world ; and Stonewall Hall , dedicated to students of all gender identities and sexual orientations who wish to live in a gender @-@ neutral community . UCR 's three academic colleges in the humanities , sciences and engineering fields are represented by respective theme halls , and halls exist for honor students and transfer students . 
 = = = Student organizations and activities = = = 
 UCR hosts over 375 registered student organizations , including the Associated Students of the University of California , Riverside ( ASUCR ) , which represents undergraduates on administrative and policy issues . ASUCR is guided by a Senate composed of 16 elected officers , who represent the three undergraduate colleges in proportion to their enrollment , 10 Directors , who are in charge of the various parts of ASUCR , and a Judicial Council of 6 , which adjudicates any cases involving personnel misconduct or interpretation of the Constitution . Membership is composed of all UCR students who pay mandatory activity fees . ASUCR assesses these fees and distributes funds to registered student groups on campus , including student lobbying groups , a right that ASUCR won in a federal court case against the Regents in 1999 . 
 Of the registered student groups , 40 are fraternities and sororities . Nine men 's fraternities belong to the North @-@ American Interfraternity Conference ; seven women 's sororities belong to the National Panhellenic Conference ; seven men 's fraternities and ten women 's sororities represent the National Multicultural Greek Council , and two others fall under the campus Raza Assembly and are unique to UCR . Thirteen percent of the undergraduate student body participates in Greek life , although chapter houses are not permitted . Including the Greek letter organizations , more than 60 student volunteer service organizations at UCR contribute to more than 100 @,@ 000 hours of collective and individual service done in the community each year . Jewish student life has existed for over a decade through UCR Hillel . 
 Student media organizations include The Highlander student newspaper , currently published every Tuesday during the academic year . First published in 1954 , the Highlander remains an independent student media outlet . It was an entirely self @-@ funded organization until 2001 , when ASUCR passed a funding referendum for it . Student fees from the referendum go towards overhead and printing costs , however the Highlander is primarily funded through its own advertising revenue . In 2003 , the Highlander published a comic depicting a stereotypical Asian American graduate teaching assistant with poor English skills , inciting community backlash and prompting an apology from Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief Kahlil Ford . Other student news publications on campus include the Asian Community Times , Indian Time , Nuestra Cosa , <unk> , and the X @-@ Factor Student Newspaper . Campus literary magazines include Mosaic , published at UCR since 1959 , and Crate , published by graduate students in UCR 's master 's level creative writing program since 2005 . UCR broadcasts over radio as <unk> at 88 @.@ 3 FM . The station programs a variety of independent music , news and commentary . 
 On @-@ campus entertainment events are planned by a 14 @-@ member Associated Students Program Board ( <unk> ) , comprising six student @-@ run divisions that include concerts , films and lectures , cultural events and special events , as well as a marketing and leadership division . <unk> 's major events include the Block Party Concert , Student Film Festival , International Film Festival , World Fest , Welcome Week , Homecoming and Spring Splash . 
 Still other on @-@ campus events take place at The Barn , one of the original buildings on campus grounds . Throughout the 60s ' , 70s ' and 80s ' popular up and coming bands played at The Barn including No Doubt and Radiohead . During the 90s ' however , the university administration sought to avoid a " party school " stigma and did away with the concerts and events and remodeled the facility into a restaurant , The Big West Bar and Grill . As recently as the fall of 2007 , concerts returned to The Barn and efforts are underway to rejuvenate it and once again make it into an on @-@ campus venue attracting students as well as the larger university community . 
 The Graduate Student Association of the University of California , Riverside ( <unk> ) is ASUCR 's counterpart on the graduate level . It is guided by a Graduate Student Council consisting of representatives from every department on campus . <unk> assesses fees required of all graduate students and uses them to fund research awards and <unk> , conference travel grants , and speaker funds . 
 = = = Athletics = = = 
 UCR 's varsity teams compete in the Big West Conference of NCAA Division I. Programs include men 's and women 's soccer , cross country , basketball , track and field , baseball , softball , tennis , golf and women 's volleyball . After students voted to assess themselves $ 35 a quarter to fund the athletic programs in 1998 , men 's and women 's soccer and golf were added , and the athletic department switched from NCAA Division II in 2000 . While at Division II level , UCR produced 5 national championship teams in men 's baseball and women 's volleyball . As of 2006 , UCR had produced 17 individual national champions , 175 All @-@ Americans and many conference and regional champions . The men 's golf team represented UCR in the 2004 and 2005 NCAA West Regionals after winning back to back Conference Championships in those respective years while having three athletes ranked in the top 100 in the country . In 2006 , 2007 , and 2010 the UCR women 's basketball team represented the conference in the Division I tournament but lost all three times in the first round . In December 2008 , the UCR women 's basketball team upset the # 16 @-@ seeded Vanderbilt Commodores . 
 In 2005 the women 's soccer team competed in the first round of the NCAA tournament . In 2007 , UCR 's baseball team won their first Big West championship and reached the Division I postseason for the second time since 2003 , and the cross country team sent its first two athletes to the national championships . Football was played until 1975 , and the team won two CCAA championships before the sport was discontinued because of low attendance and in anticipation of the impact of Title IX regulations . 
 The volleyball and basketball teams play home games in the Student Recreation Center ( SRC ) , which seats 3 @,@ 168 . The baseball team competes at the Riverside Sports Complex , just off campus at the corner of Blaine and Rustin streets . UCR graduate Troy Percival personally built UCR 's baseball clubhouse to major league quality standards . Softball is played at the Amy S. Harrison Field , named after a UCR graduate who donated $ 300 @,@ 000 towards its upgrade in 2004 . Adjacent to the softball field are the soccer and track fields . The soccer field was resurfaced with artificial turf in 2007 . In 2011 , the old track and field facility , which had bleachers that dated back to the 1950s and a track surface that was over 15 years old , was completely torn out and replaced with a brand new facility . 
 Non @-@ varsity student sports clubs that compete with other area universities include the Rugby Football Club , established in 2006 , which plays in the Southern California Rugby Football Union . The karate program is provided through the UC Riverside Recreation Center 's Leisure Line classes . The classes are provided by top of the line USA Shotokan karate team coaches from the American <unk> Karate Association , an association that has been in the city for over 40 years . It is one of the largest collegiate programs in the United States , that take competitors to local , national and international competitions . A Men 's and Women 's Club Soccer team also competes in the West Coast Soccer Association . 
 In 1954 , UCR 's founding class adopted the name " Highlanders " , reflecting the campus ' high altitude . After the student body passed a referendum to move to Division I competition in 1998 , the bear mascot , formerly called " Scotty " , was professionally redesigned to look more ferocious . The new mascot featured a half @-@ blue face in homage to William Wallace , the subject of the movie Braveheart . In line with the Scottish motif , UCR assembles a bagpipe band made up of students and staff who play at graduation and other campus events . The blue and gold tartan worn by the pipe band and the mascot is a registered trademark of the University of California . For the women 's basketball team 's first appearance at the NCAA Tournament in 2006 , UCR sent 22 members of the pipe band to play at halftime .

 = Beechwood ( Vanderlip mansion ) = 
 Beechwood is a Hudson River estate in Scarborough @-@ on @-@ Hudson , in Briarcliff Manor , New York . The estate was most notably the home of Frank A. Vanderlip and his family , and is a contributing property to the Scarborough Historic District . The house and property were owned by the Vanderlip family from 1906 to 1979 . The property is now a 37 @-@ condominium complex as the result of a development project that began in the 1980s . 
 Contemporarily , Beechwood is known for being a filming location of the 1970 film House of Dark Shadows , and a filming location and the primary setting of Savages , a 1972 Merchant Ivory film . In June 2016 , Money Man : Frank Vanderlip and the Birth of the Federal Reserve premiered there . The film documents Vanderlip 's life and was filmed at Beechwood . 
 = = History = = 
 The first portion of the main residence dates to 1780 , and includes the original kitchen 's fireplace . Benjamin and Ann Folger were among the earliest residents , and named their residence " <unk> Place " . In the 1830s , Folger deeded the estate to a self @-@ proclaimed prophet , Robert Matthews , who believed himself to be the resurrected Matthias of the New Testament . Matthews convinced his followers to fund an expansion to the house , which he had named " Zion Hill " . During this time , Isabella Baumfree ( Sojourner Truth ) was a housekeeper to him . After he spent the money his followers and Folger had given him , Matthews became violent . Further on , he was tried for murder , and acquitted for lack of evidence . Matthews was later found guilty of assaulting his grown daughter , and he served a short jail term . 
 The property containing the mansion had been in the Remsen family for decades . Anna Remsen Webb was one of the inheritors of the estate . In the 1890s , her husband 's half @-@ brother Henry Walter Webb substantially added to the estate from numerous properties , including the Remsen estate and William Creighton 's estate ( Creighton had named his house " Beechwood " after he purchased it in 1836 ) . Henry Webb attached the name Beechwood to the entire estate and house . He renovated and expanded the mansion , hiring R. H. Robertson to double the size of the house . Robertson designed the expansion in the Colonial Revival style , to be compatible with the neoclassical Federal style of the original but more ornate . 
 Frank Vanderlip purchased the 23 @-@ acre ( 9 @.@ 3 ha ) property from Webb 's widow in 1906 , and bought more property to make the estate a total 125 acres ( 51 ha ) . He hired William Welles Bosworth soon after to further enlarge the house and to design a wing for his library and the lawns of the estate . In 1907 , while Vanderlip was vice president of the First National City Bank ( later Citibank ) , he had two columns from the headquarters 55 Wall Street shipped to Beechwood ( 55 Wall Street was being remodeled and the columns were re @-@ spaced , with two left over ) . He had the columns placed two @-@ thirds above ground in Beechwood 's entranceway off of Albany Post Road ( now U.S. Route 9 ) , an entrance which was later closed due to increasing traffic volume on Route 9 ( the current entrance is off Scarborough Station Road ) . Vanderlip also made a cage for his children 's pet rabbits using a discarded wrought @-@ iron elevator , also discarded from the bank . Among the guests the Vanderlips hosted at the house were Woodrow Wilson , Henry Ford , Sarah Bernhardt , Annie Oakley , Franklin D. Roosevelt , John D. Rockefeller , and Isadora Duncan . The Wright Brothers even landed a plane on the property . In 1910 , Vanderlip bought the nearby mansion Woodlea , although his wife Narcissa Vanderlip prevented the family from moving , due to her preference of Beechwood over the grandiose Woodlea . In 1979 , Vanderlip descendants sold the property . Three condominiums were built during a transformation of the mansion in the 1980s . A later expansion resulted in a total of 37 condominiums on the property 's 33 acres . 
 = = Description = = 
 Near the center of the property , at the southwest corner of Route 9 and Scarborough Station Road , sits the eponymous mansion that features two large porticoed entryways , a two @-@ story octagonal library , numerous porches , verandas , and over 100 interior rooms . Other major structures included a hunting lodge , a second mansion built for the Vanderlips ' daughter Charlotte , a home for the Vanderlips ' physician , and the Scarborough School , a progressive school which the Vanderlips established just south of the mansion in 1916 . 
 The 80 @-@ acre ( 32 ha ) private parkland was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted for the Vanderlips and has expansive lawns , a grove of large beech trees , imported trees , and an Italianate garden with an alcove , fountain , and small pool with Wisteria @-@ covered trellises . The lawns , formal gardens , and stone gazebo , erected by the Vanderlips , have been preserved and feature in wedding ceremonies that occasionally occur on the property . 
 The Beechwood estate also contained a carriage house , gatehouse , squash court ( no longer extant ) , and a white @-@ stucco artist 's studio named Beech Twig , which was home to author John Cheever , whose children attended the school on the property . The family rented the house until they moved to Ossining . Descriptions of the building 's interior closely match descriptions employed by Cheever in some short stories . Novelist Richard Yates also lived in the same house as a child , as well as other artists , writers , and composers . The estate 's garage is located northeast of the mansion , and is a flat @-@ roof , two @-@ story concrete building dating to the early 1900s . 
 = The World Needs a Hero = 
 The World Needs a Hero is the ninth studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth , released in May 2001 by Sanctuary Records . After the critical and commercial failure of the previous album Risk ( 1999 ) , The World Needs a Hero represented a change back to a heavier musical direction . Subsequently , the album charted at number 16 on the Billboard 200 upon release . 
 After parting with former label Capitol Records , the album was the first of two Megadeth studio albums to be released by Sanctuary . It was the last of two studio albums to feature drummer Jimmy DeGrasso and the only one to feature Al Pitrelli on lead guitar . Furthermore , The World Needs a Hero was the last album with original bassist David Ellefson until his return to Megadeth in 2010 . Additionally , mascot Vic Rattlehead appears on the cover of a Megadeth album for the first time since Rust in Peace ( 1990 ) . 
 = = Background and production = = 
 In 1999 , Megadeth released its eighth studio album , Risk . The album was noteworthy for being a drastic musical departure for the band , and the culmination of the band 's increasing attempts for mainstream success throughout the 1990s , a trend starting with Countdown to Extinction ( 1992 ) . The World Needs a Hero marks a stylistic transition towards the band 's thrash metal roots . Furthermore , the album had been touted by the band as an " antidote " to Risk in a press release . However , the album has been noted by several music critics as still retaining some commercial feel from previous albums . 
 According to frontman Dave Mustaine , the album title refers to stereotypical rock stars . When asked about the matter , and an earlier comment about Axl Rose having killed the traditional rock star image , Mustaine explained that " People want heroes . Most bands look like average Joes , wearing gas @-@ station shirts , have funky hair @-@ dos and I think people wanna be able to go ' they may not be popular , but they 're MY band . ' " Mustaine went on to say that many of contemporary rock music groups looked and sounded the same , and that the music industry needed a hero . He then proceeded to contrast a perceived lack of image of then current music scenes with the image of 1980s metal bands like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest . 
 In another interview , Mustaine offered a more straightforward interpretation of the album title . Commenting on negative stories in the news , such as wars and natural disasters , Mustaine inferred that the world at that time was in need of a hero to solve various problems around the planet . 
 The album cover by Hugh Syme shows mascot Vic Rattlehead breaking out of Mustaine . 
 = = Songs = = 
 The album 's lead single was " Moto Psycho " , and a video was also made for this song . The song is about people who commute every day to work , spending a lot of time on the road . " Dread and the Fugitive Mind " was released on the Capitol Punishment compilation a year earlier , at the insistence of Megadeth 's former label , Capitol Records . The album 's opener , " <unk> " , is explained by Mustaine as being about living a double life and " the person I want you to think that I am and the person inside that I really know I am . " " Coming Home " was only available on the Japanese pressing as a bonus track , but has since been released on the <unk> box set . Mustaine has stated that concept for " Promises " is " prejudiced relationships , " such as those between a Catholic and a Protestant in Ireland , interracial and same @-@ sex relationships , " it could be about a guy and a sheep for all I care . It just means that if we can 't be together in this life , maybe we 'll make it in the next . " 
 When asked if " Recipe for Hate ... <unk> " was written about any particular person , Mustaine said that there were " a whole bunch of people that 'd probably deserve that song , " but didn 't single out anyone in particular . " Silent Scorn " is an instrumental song which is often played over the sound system at concerts ; this can be heard on the band 's live album Rude Awakening ( 2002 ) right after the final song in the set , " Holy Wars ... The Punishment Due " . " Return to Hangar " is a sequel to " Hangar 18 " from Rust in Peace ; the captive aliens from the first song escape and kill their captors . On the live albums Rude Awakening and That One Night : Live in Buenos Aires ( 2007 ) it is played back @-@ to @-@ back with " Hangar 18 " . The main riff and structure of " When " , the album 's closing number , is reminiscent of " Am I Evil ? " by Diamond Head , which Mustaine said was intentional .

The album also charted in Poland ( # 17 ) , Germany ( # 36 ) , Sweden ( # 38 ) , and Switzerland ( # 55 ) as well . By December 2005 , The World Needs a Hero had sold about 219 @,@ 000 copies in the United States . Megadeth commenced a tour to promote the album on June 8 , 2001 at Milton Keynes National Bowl in England , where they were featured alongside acts such as AC / DC , The Offspring , and Queens of the Stone Age . The appearance at the Dynamo Festival in the Netherlands was canceled without explanation . A show scheduled for August 2 , 2001 in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia was banned because the band 's imagery was considered " unsuitable " by the country 's government . Following the breakup of the band in 2002 , six of the album 's songs appeared on Still Alive ... and Well ? , a 2002 compilation combining studio tracks from The World Needs a Hero , with six live tracks . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 The World Needs a Hero received generally mediocre reviews and was regarded as a " return to roots " by critics . Writing for AllMusic , reviewer Steve Huey opined that Mustaine " tries to conjure memories " of Rust in Peace and Countdown to Extinction , but while comparing " Dread and the Fugitive Mind " to " Sweating Bullets " ( from Countdown to Extinction ) said that much of the material " feels like rehashed Megadeth " . Huey critiqued the production as still being " radio @-@ friendly " and said because of that , the group " never quite kicks up the fury or flash of past glories " . Neil Arnold of Metal Forces wrote that even though the album was " lacking the menace of the band ’ s earlier work " , it was still a more accomplished effort than the previous record . He concluded that Megadeth were " clearly opting for melody over aggression " , albeit rarely breaking into " thrash mode " . 
 Meanwhile , reviewer Greg Pratt of Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles was more sympathetic towards the album . Pratt , after briefly critiquing the lack of a thrashy sound , positively compared the record to Youthanasia ( 1994 ) and Countdown to Extinction ( 1992 ) . Additionally , he commented that even in the absence of longtime members Nick Menza and Marty Friedman , that the band still sounded good . Pratt reacted positively to a number of the album 's songs , but cited " Recipe for Hate ... <unk> " as being the album 's " most intense moment " . Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic had mixed feelings about the music on the record . While Stagno noted that the album was advertised as a return towards the band 's roots , he explained that those who were hoping for an album in the style of the band 's first four records would be disappointed . Stagno ultimately defined the album as " more of an all @-@ out metal record " . 
 The Rolling Stone Album Guide described the album as " sluggish " and " retrograde " and called it a " step back for the band " . Orlando Weekly 's John Engels felt that the void left by former guitarist Marty Friedman was successfully filled by Al Pitrelli . However , he noted that the album occasionally sounds repetitive , and criticized a number of songs for their " childish " lyrics . Friedman stated he was " a little disappoint [ ed ] " by the album . Friedman specifically singled out the album 's cover for criticism , though he also commented that he thought that the music was " very well done " .

 = Australia at the Winter Olympics = 
 Australia first competed in the Winter Olympic Games in 1936 in Garmisch @-@ Partenkirchen , and has participated in every games since , with the exception of the 1948 Games in St. Moritz . 
 In the early years , Australia 's athletes did poorly ; only two athletes placed in the top half of their events before 1976 , while the vast majority placed in the bottom quarter , including some who finished last . This lack of success was attributed to the Australian culture , climate and lack of snow , as well as the lack of support for the athletes — sports administrators regarded investment in winter sports as futile . 
 After the appointment of Geoff Henke — who had been unable to compete in 1956 after the administrators neglected to endorse his ice hockey team 's application — as team manager in 1976 , the results slowly began to improve , and by the 1990s , some Australians were regarded as medal prospects . The upturn in performance was accompanied by increased government funding for winter sports , the creation of the Olympic Winter Institute of Australia and the purchase of an alpine training base in Austria . 
 Australia won its first medal , a bronze , in 1994 in the men 's 5 @,@ 000 metres short track relay speed skating event . Zali Steggall gained Australia 's first individual medal in 1998 , when she won bronze in the slalom event . In 2002 , Steven Bradbury won the 1 @,@ 000 metres short track speed skating and Alisa Camplin won the aerials event , making Australia the only southern hemisphere country to have won a gold medal at a Winter Olympics . 
 Australia sent 40 competitors to compete in 10 sports at the 2006 Games in Turin . Their goal of winning a medal was achieved when Dale Begg @-@ Smith won the gold in men 's freestyle moguls skiing . Camplin claimed her second medal , a bronze in the aerials event . 
 At the 2010 Games in Vancouver Australia had its most successful Winter Olympics taking home two gold and one silver . Begg @-@ Smith won a silver in the moguls , while Torah Bright and Lydia Lassila won the women 's half @-@ pipe snowboarding and aerial freestyle skiing respectively . 
 At the 2014 Games , Australia sent its largest ever Winter Olympic Team , 60 athletes , to Sochi , competing in 10 sports . The Sochi Team included 31 female athletes making it the first Australian Olympic Team , Summer or Winter , with more female athletes than male . Australia again won three medals with David Morris ( aerial skiing ) and Torah Bright ( snowboard halfpipe ) winning silver and Lydia Lassila ( aerial skiing ) finishing with bronze . 
 Overall Australia has won 12 Winter Olympic medals - 5 gold , 3 silver and 4 bronze . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early struggles = = = 
 Winter sports have traditionally been second to summer pursuits in Australian sporting culture , but interest and support in the former has grown . The decision @-@ making bodies of the Australian Olympic Federation ( AOF ) allowed winter sports to be represented , but their representatives were usually overruled by their summer counterparts . 
 The first Winter Olympics took place in 1924 . Australia first competed at the Winter Olympics in 1936 , when its sole representative , Kenneth Kennedy , participated in speed skating . Kennedy came 33rd in both the 1500 m and 5000 m , near the bottom of the standings . He was entirely on his own ; no Australian support staff were in attendance , even though the AOF officially sanctioned Kennedy 's entry . 
 The Olympics were then halted due to the outbreak of World War II . Australia did not send a team to the 1948 Winter Olympics , but has competed at every Winter Olympics since , sending nine athletes to the 1952 Olympics . There were five skiers , two cross @-@ country and three downhill — who either failed to finish or whose results were unknown — three figure skaters and one speed skater . Adrian Swan and Nancy Burley , who finished 10th and 14th in figure skating , were the only two Australia competitors to place in the top 20 , although neither placed in the top half of the field . Burley and fellow figure skater <unk> Molony were the first two women to represent Australia at the Winter Olympics . 
 Supervision and support for the athletes were relatively minimal in the early years . Colin Hickey said that he never received clothing from the AOF , except for a black armband and tie for the 1952 Olympics to mourn the death of King George VI . He also said that Australian officials had " no control over me ... All they 'd do was tell me what times I had to do " . Hickey was <unk> and had travelled to Europe at the age of 18 to support himself and race . In 1952 , a support staffer was present for the first time ; Robert " George " Chisholm was the first manager of an Australian Winter Olympic team . The lack of administrative attention was highlighted when Chisholm incorrectly declared that the campaign was Australia 's first at the Winter Olympics . 
 At the 1956 Winter Olympics , Hickey , a " rink rat " who was overlooked for ice hockey when he was young because of his small frame , came seventh in the 500 and 1000 metres speed skating at his second Olympics . He later won a bronze medal at the world championships . Australia 's nine other competitors were less successful ; two male figure skaters — Allan <unk> and Charles Keeble — placed in the top 15 but in the bottom 25 % in the individual event , while the pairs combination of Mervyn Bower and Jacqueline Mason failed to take to the ice after Bower was injured . The five downhill skiers were Australia 's least successful entrants ; the highest finish was 33rd and the median was 60th , and all were near the bottom of their events . Australia sent its first coach and female staffer for the 1956 campaign ; C. Mason oversaw the skaters and Lillian Chisholm acted as the chaperone . The ice hockey team offered to pay their own way to compete ; the only thing that they needed from the AOF was formal permission . However , the AOF never responded to their request ; they were unable to attend , and criticised the AOF for their disinterest . One of the affected athletes was Geoff Henke , later credited for ending the neglect of winter sports when he became an administrator . 
 Australia sent 31 athletes in 1960 , its largest team before the 2006 Winter Olympics ; their size was boosted by an outclassed 18 @-@ man ice hockey team , which conceded 83 goals in losing all six matches . They lost to Czechoslovakia 18 – 1 and the United States 12 – 1 in their two group matches , and were then placed into a group with Finland and Japan , the last @-@ placed teams in the two other preliminary groups . The Australians played two matches against each of the other teams to determine the three worst teams in the nine @-@ country contest . They lost all four matches , conceding a total of 53 goals . The heaviest margins were in the defeats to Czechoslovakia and Finland , 18 – 1 and 19 – 2 respectively . Australia scored only 10 goals in reply . 
 Hal <unk> competed in Nordic combined , the only time that Australia has participated in the event at the Olympics , and finished last . Four years after injury prevented them from competing , Bower and Mason recorded Australia 's best result , placing 12th in the pairs figure skating , although they were still second to last . Hickey and two male figure skaters — who were close to last — were the only Australians to place in the top 20 , while Christine Davy became the first Australian to break into the top 30 in a skiing event , although she too was in the bottom 20 % of the competition . The athletes were accompanied by seven staff members , the largest Australian support contingent until 1988 . Chisholm mistakenly noted in his official report that it was Australia 's second participation , forgetting the delegations sent in 1936 , 1952 and 1956 . 
 With the ice hockey team in mind , there was debate about the trade @-@ off between selection standards and participation after the 1960 Winter Olympics . At a 1963 meeting , Kenneth Kennedy complained that the ice hockey team was not given overseas trips to compete because they were not world class , but could never become competitive unless they had experience in international matches . Edgar Tanner said " I ask the winter sports whether they really believe they are in world class , or world ranking , in the field of sport and whether they can do Australia credit , or just be there . " Bill Young , of cycling , disagreed , saying " I thought the first spirit of the Games was to compete " , but was overruled by Tanner . 
 In contrast to the large 1960 team , the teams in subsequent Olympics were scaled back and were the smallest since 1936 . The 1964 Winter Olympics were marred by the deaths of Australian skier Ross Milne — who crashed during a practice run — and a British luge competitor . Milne had skidded off the course and crashed into a tree . Members of the IOC asked the AOF whether Milne was negligently sent to compete despite a lack of experience , which the AOF denied . The Australian manager John Wagner blamed the accident on a large group of skiers who had congregated lower down on the course during the practice session , forcing Milne to take evasive action . The Australian delegation felt that the training arrangements had not been enacted strictly , making the course unsafe . Australia was represented by five skiers — excluding Milne . Christine Smith placed in the top 30 in two events , but the remainder placed 40th or lower , although all were in the bottom half of the field . Milne 's replacement Peter Wenzel placed 68th in both the downhill and giant slalom . 
 Motivated in part by a desire to prove that Australians could compete at the highest level , and believing that claims that his brother died due to inexperience was a smokescreen intended to cover @-@ up the poor safety standards , Malcolm Milne represented Australia at the next two Winter Olympics , won a World Cup event and came third in a World Championship . In 1968 , Milne finished 24th in both the downhill and slalom events , Australia 's best result in a skiing event up to that point . Ross Martin came 60th in both cross @-@ country events , and Colin Coates came 41st and 49th in his two speed skating events . Australia had more officials present than athletes , with five competitors and three administrators . This trend continued at the 1972 Olympics in Sapporo , which were attended by five staff and four athletes . Milne rose up the rankings to finish 23rd and 24th in the downhill and slalom respectively , as did Coates , who came in the top 30 in three of his four events , including an 18th @-@ place result in the 10 @,@ 000 m event . Milne was considered a medal contender and the team manager felt that but for a near @-@ fall , he would have placed near the medalists . 
 = = = Henke era = = = 
 Up to this point , Australia 's performances had been poor , and winter athletes were often derided by the summer @-@ dominated administrators . During one meeting , a cross @-@ country representative asked for the selection of six athletes , prompting the selection committee chairman to interject . The chairman said that a seventh place would be needed , and went on to explain that a dog was required to find the athletes after they got lost in the snow . The majority of his colleagues burst into laughter . 
 After the 1968 Winter Olympics , at which the only Australian alpine skier was Milne , skiing delegate Peter Blaxland said that the country should not send a solitary skier for psychological reasons . The Winter Olympics team manager reported that his European counterparts were surprised by Australia 's small team . The response from the board — dominated by Summer Olympics delegates — was unsympathetic , with Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes expressing concern that uncompetitive athletes might be selected . The neglect of the Winter Olympics continued until Henke 's appointment as team manager in 1976 . Henke held the position for two decades , until Ian Chesterman took over in 1998 . He rose to become vice @-@ president of the AOF , and is credited with ending the administrative neglect of winter sport . Up until Henke 's appointment , Hickey and Milne were the only athletes to have placed in the top half of any event . In 1981 , Henke took AOF board members into the Australian Alps for a board meeting , allowing him to exploit the environment to promote winter sport . He said that the next Olympics " was the first time the AOF ever really got behind the winter team " . 
 Coates reached his peak at the 1976 games in Innsbruck . He competed in five events , and apart from a 25th @-@ place finish in the 500 m event , did no worse than 11th in the remaining four . He came sixth in the 10 @,@ 000 m , eighth in the 1 @,@ 500 m and tenth in the 5 @,@ 000 m . It was only the second time that an Australian had placed in the top 10 , and remained Australia 's best result until 1994 . His five skiing compatriots were less productive ; they registered in 13 races between them and completed only seven due to crashes and disqualifications , with only one top 30 result . 
 In 1980 , Australia 's competing contingent rose into double figures for the first time since 1960 , with 10 representatives . Jacqui <unk> became the first Australian to break into the top 20 in a skiing event , placing 17th in the slalom . The brother @-@ and @-@ sister pairing of Peter and Elizabeth Cain , Australia 's first representatives in figure skating in 20 years , came 11th . Coates was unable to repeat his performances of four years earlier and his 18th and 19th places were Australia 's only other top 20 results . 
 In 1984 in Sarajevo , Steven Lee and Cameron Medhurst placed 19th in the downhill and individual figure skating respectively . No other top 20 finishes were recorded among the 11 athletes , and the two cross @-@ country skiers and the first Australian Olympic biathlete , Andrew Paul , finished no better than 47th in their eight events . Australia sent 15 athletes to the 1988 Olympics in Calgary , where they competed in the bobsleigh for the first time . The two two @-@ man bobsleigh teams came 23rd and 26th respectively , well down the field . 
 Although a competitor on paper in 1988 , Coates was supposed to only be a coach and was forbidden to compete . The Australian Skating Union had refused to select him as they wanted to allow younger athletes an opportunity to race . However , the AOF officially listed Coates as a competitor so that he could train with the others on the ice , and because the artificially inflated athlete count would entitle the Australian team to take more support staff . However , Coates was informed that the registration was only for show and that he was not to race . However , when it was time for his event , he put on a uniform , defied team orders and skated his best time ever . Henke publicly excoriated Coates in front of the cameras , but stopped when he found out that Prime Minister Bob Hawke had sent Coates a congratulatory message . However , Coates ' new Australian record was only good enough for 26th place and ended his sixth and final Olympic campaign . His speed skating teammates Michael Richmond and Danny Kah managed two top 15 finishes each , and Medhurst was the only other Australian to place in the top 20 . 
 The 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville , France was viewed as the potential start of a new era in Australian winter sports , with hopes that a maiden medal would result . Australia 's short track relay team went into the 1992 Olympics as world champions , but crashed in the semi @-@ finals . The Australians were in third place when Richard Nizielski lost his footing and knocked over team @-@ mate John Kah during a changeover ; they finished fourth and failed to reach the final . In the individual speed skating events , Australia scored only four top 20 finishes from 12 starts , with none higher than 12th , and only one placing in the top half . Kirstie Marshall was in the process of winning the 1992 World Cup series , and was one of the favourites for the women 's aerial skiing , which was a demonstration event , but she crash @-@ landed and finished seventh . Lee managed two top 20 finishes in alpine skiing events , and finished in the top half of the competitors in four events ; most of the Australians remained in the bottom half in all of their events . Despite the disappointments of the near @-@ misses , Australia increased their investment in the Winter Olympics , purchasing a training base called Sonnpark in Austria in 1993 . The 1992 Games also included <unk> as a demonstration sport four athletes qualified for the Games . Nick Kirshner , Les <unk> , Geoff Tasker and Daniel Guerin . Tasker and Kirshner 's Nominations where both rejected after their arrival In the village

 In 1994 , the short track relay team won Australia 's first Winter Olympic medal , a bronze . They qualified for the four @-@ team final after edging out Japan and New Zealand , finishing second in their semi @-@ final . The quartet adopted a plan of staying on their feet as the first priority , and remaining <unk> and defeating at least one of the other three finalists . During the race , the Canadians fell and lost a significant amount of time , meaning that Australia would win a medal if they raced conservatively and avoided a crash . Late in the race , Nizielski was fighting with his American counterpart for track position to claim the silver medal , but took the safe option and yielded , mindful of the lost opportunity of the crash in Albertville . It was a successful campaign for the largest team that Australia had sent — apart from 1960 . The 27 athletes recorded an unprecedented five top 10 finishes . Marshall placed first in the opening round of the aerials , but faded to sixth in the final , while Kerryn Rim placed eighth in the 15 km biathlon and Steven Bradbury and Nizielski of the medal @-@ winning relay team placed eighth and tenth in the 500 m and 1 @,@ 000 m short track events respectively . In contrast to the previous games , the Australian short track speed skaters placed in the top half of the field in six of their eight individual starts . However , the Australians in the remaining disciplines generally finished in the bottom half of their competition . 
 Further medal success was anticipated at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano , which were attended by 24 Australian athletes . Zali Steggall , who months earlier had become the first Australian woman to win a World Cup event and was ranked sixth in the world , won the country 's first individual medal with a bronze in slalom skiing . Her time of 1 m 32 @.@ 67 s was only 0 @.@ 27 s behind the gold medallist . Marshall , the world champion in 1997 and 1999 , and Jacqui Cooper — ranked second in the world — were expected to do well in the aerials , but both crashed and failed to make the final . Bradbury , Nizielski and Kieran Hansen , three of the quartet that won Australia 's maiden medal in 1994 , returned but finished last , in eighth place . 
 = = = Golden breakthrough = = = 
 The improved results of the 1990s prompted higher expectations from the Australian Winter Olympic hierarchy . At the start of the 2002 Olympics , the Australian chef de mission Ian Chesterman addressed the team , saying " historically our winter teams have been the child racked by self @-@ doubt , shy in nature as we saw our big brother , our summer Games team , take on and conquer the world . " He added , " but over time we have developed a belief in ourselves " . 
 Australia competed in five sports in 2002 , the fewest sports entered in since 1984 . Australian cross @-@ country skiers were absent for the first time since 1976 , and there were no bobsleigh sliders for the first time since Australia 's debut in the sport in 1988 . This was partly due to the AOC 's higher selection standards than those of the IOC . Australian bobsledder Will <unk> lamented that " We also beat half the teams currently in Salt Lake City , but unfortunately we couldn 't meet the very high standard of the AOC " . According to the Skiing Australia Cross Country Committee , tougher AOC selection standards contributed to the failure to compete in the discipline in 2002 . 
 In 2002 , Australia won their first two gold medals , the first time any southern hemisphere country had won an event . Australia 's maiden gold came in highly unlikely circumstances . Steven Bradbury , a member of the bronze @-@ winning 1994 relay team , won gold in short track speed skating on 17 February when all of his competitors in the 1 @,@ 000 m final crashed out on the final turn while jostling for the medal positions . He had qualified for the final after benefiting from similar incidents and disqualifications in the quarter and semifinals . Bradbury came third in his quarterfinal and would have been eliminated , but world champion Marc Gagnon was disqualified for obstruction and the Australian progressed . 
 Bradbury 's strategy from the semifinal onwards was to cruise behind his opponents and hope that they crashed , as he realised that he could not match their raw pace . His reasoning was that risk @-@ taking by the favourites could cause a racing incident , and if two ( or more ) riders collided and fell , the remaining three would all receive medals , and that as he was slower than his opponents , trying to challenge them directly would only increase his chance of being caught in a collision and falling . 
 In the semifinal , three skaters , including the defending champion , crashed into each other and Bradbury moved up into second place to qualify for the final . In the final , Bradbury was substantially slower than his opponents and was safely in last place , around 15 m behind with only 50 m to go , when all four rivals collided and fell over , allowing him to avoid the pile @-@ up and take the victory . The unlikely win turned Bradbury into something of a folk hero across Australia and around the world . 
 Having won three consecutive World Cup titles , Jacqui Cooper was the favourite in the aerials , but injured herself in training and was sent home days before the competition . Alisa Camplin , who had never won a World Cup event , won after exceeding her rivals ' points tally on the second and final jump . 
 In 2006 , Australia sent 40 athletes to compete in 10 sports . It was a record number of competitors and events , and Australian officials publicly declared their expectations of medal success . Aerial skiing medal hopeful Lydia Ierodiaconou injured herself when she landed badly on the second qualification jump , while Jacqui Cooper , who placed first in the qualification round , crashed in both of her finals jumps . Camplin won bronze , her second Olympic medal . Dale Begg @-@ Smith , considered the favourite in moguls skiing , won gold in the event . Torah Bright was rated as a medal chance in snowboarding half @-@ pipe , and came fifth . Damon Hayler , rated as a medal chance in snowboard cross , came seventh . Michelle Steele , a beach flag sprinter less than two years earlier , was seen as a medal possibility in the skeleton , but inexperience with the intimidating and technical track contributed to her 13th place . As only eight teams competed in the men 's short track speed skating relay , Australia had a good mathematical chance of winning a medal , but they failed to reach the final . 
 In 2010 , Australia had its most successful Winter Olympics , ending with two gold and one silver . There were a further seven finishes in the top ten . <unk> Bright returned and won gold . After falling in her first run in the final — only the highest of the two runs is counted — she had to perform her second run before all the other competitors as she was ranked last after the first phase , and produced the top @-@ score ; the later competitors could not match her and she took victory . In 2010 , Lassila ( née Ierodiaconou ) took gold , having come into the event as the reigning World Cup champion and favourite after setting a record score at a recent World Cup competition . After being second after the first jump , she scored highly on her final attempt , and the leader Xu <unk> from China failed to land her second jump cleanly , sealing Lassila 's win . Cooper returned for a final campaign and came fifth . Begg @-@ Smith was again the favorite after three consecutive World Cup wins , but he was narrowly beaten by local skier Alexandre <unk> . 
 Russian @-@ born short @-@ track speed skater Tatiana <unk> , whose citizenship was expedited to allow her to compete , made the semifinals in two events , placing 7th and 11th . In the snowboard cross , Hayler came tenth , while Alex Pullin was fastest in the qualification time trial , but crashed in the first round of racing . Scott Kneller came seventh in the men 's ski cross , while Holly Crawford came eighth in half @-@ pipe and Emma Lincoln @-@ Smith tenth in the skeleton . 
 In 2014 at the Sochi , Russia Olympic Winter Games Australia won three Olympic medals and a total of 15 top 10 performances were recorded , a significant increase from the nine achieved in Vancouver in 2010 . In addition Australia recorded 27 top 16 performances compared to 15 in Vancouver four years earlier . 
 This was a Team of history makers . Torah Bright became Australia 's most successful female Winter Olympian by adding a silver medal to her gold from Vancouver in 2010 . In Sochi , Bright was the only athlete to attempt three Snowboard events at the one Olympics : <unk> , Halfpipe and Snowboard Cross . David Morris , Australia ’ s only male <unk> at the Sochi Games wrote his own piece of Olympic history by completing a double @-@ full full @-@ full ( quad twisting somersault ) in the men ’ s Freestyle Skiing – Aerials super @-@ final . Morris scored 110 @.@ 41 points for his jump and was awarded the silver medal . He was later honoured for his achievement by carrying the Australian flag in the Closing Ceremony . Aerials team mate and defending Olympic Aerial Skiing Champion Lydia Lassila was in Sochi to make history . Lydia chose to execute a jump in the women ’ s super @-@ final that no other woman in the history of the sport had attempted in competition , a quad twisting triple somersault . The high degree of difficulty jump scored her 72 @.@ 12 points and the bronze medal . This historical effort has taken the sport of women ’ s Aerials to a whole new level . Lassila is also the first mother to win a Winter Olympic medal for Australia . Bobsleigh ’ s Jana Pittman became the first female Olympian to compete in both a Summer and Winter Olympics . Callum and Aimee Watson became the first siblings to compete at the same Games in Cross Country . Alex <unk> pulled off the best ever performance by a male Australian biathlete when he finished 45th in the 20 km Individual . Other historic bests were John Farrow finishing 17th in the men ’ s Skeleton , Belle Brockhoff , eighth in the women ’ s Snowboard Cross and Kent <unk> , ninth in the men ’ s Snowboard Halfpipe . 
 = = Infrastructure and training = = 
 Although Australia has competed in every Winter Olympics since 1936 , it was not until the late 1980s that the athletes were supported by institutionalised training , government infrastructure or sports science . Malcolm Milne 's success prompted the eventual starting of the Australian Ski Federation by Geoff Henke in the 1980s , and with it , a program to sponsor talented young skiers and send them to Europe to hone their craft . The beneficiaries of this program included Lee , Zali Steggall , and aerial skiers Cooper and Marshall . In 1993 , a training centre and base called Sonnpark was set up in <unk> , near Innsbruck , Austria , a joint venture between the Australian and Austrian Olympic Committees for summer and winter sports . Colin Hickey said about Sonnpark " Yeah . It 's great ... With that sort of back @-@ up , we 'd have given them [ the Europeans ] a run for their money . " Australia sold the base in 2002 . After the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano , the Olympic Winter Institute of Australia ( OWIA , initially called the Australian Institute of Winter Sports ) was created . It was given a million @-@ dollar annual budget ; for the first time , Australia had a federal government – funded full @-@ time winter sports training program to accompany the Australian Institute of Sport . This led to a steady rise in the number of Australians who won medals at World Cup events in the immediate years after the OWIA 's creation . After the 2010 Olympics , the OWIA mooted plans to build a half @-@ pipe course at <unk> in the Australian Alps , and a water jump in Brisbane for aerials freestyle training . In 2010 , the OWIA 's new training base , Icehouse , was opened in Melbourne . The largest facility of its type in the southern hemisphere , it features two large skating rinks and cost <unk> million . 
 The Australian Olympic Committee ( AOC , formerly the Australian Olympic Federation ) is the peak body responsible for Australia 's participation at the Olympics . Aside from funding the participation at the Olympics , the AOC provides money for the training and preparation of athletes . This occurs through their funding of the OWIA , grants for athletes to travel overseas to compete and the provision of monetary awards to athletes and their coaches if they win medals at World Cup events or World Championships in the lead up to the Olympics . The funding of the OWIA by the AOC varies by year , but hovers between <unk> and 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 , with a higher budget in the years immediately before an Olympics . Through the Australian Sports Commission , the federal government also sponsors OWIA , contributing more than half a million dollars a year . In 2009 , the OWIA lobbied the government for an increase in its annual budget from <unk> to <unk> , a fraction of the <unk> spent by Canada — the host of the 2010 Olympics . In contrast , the current funding for the Summer Olympics team is <unk> per annum and the AOC asked for an increase of <unk> annually in 2009 . Australia aimed to win two medals in 2010 , something that was achieved , and which Chesterman touted as justification for further funding to maintain and increase rankings in the face of growing expenditure by other countries . 
 = = Public participation and support for winter sports in Australia = = 
 Although Australia is generally considered to be more suited to summer sport , several ice @-@ based sports take place as well . Snow falls on the Australian Alps and parts of Tasmania . The Australian Alps are within six hours ' drive for residents of Sydney , but within two hours ' drive for residents of Melbourne and Canberra , Tasmanian ski slopes are within a day 's drive for residents of the major cities of Hobart and Launceston . However , the season is quite short , as the snow is skiable for only about four months per year . Skiing in Australia was first introduced by Norwegian miners in the goldrush town of Kiandra , New South Wales , around 1859 , near today 's Selwyn <unk> ski resort . The sport remains a popular winter activity in the south @-@ eastern states and territories . Major alpine skiing resorts include Thredbo , <unk> and Charlotte Pass in New South Wales ; Mount Hotham , Falls Creek and Mount Buller in Victoria and Mount Ben Lomond in Tasmania . Victoria has three dedicated cross @-@ country ski resorts and extensive areas are available for cross @-@ country skiing within national parks including Kosciuszko National Park ( NSW ) , Alpine National Park ( VIC ) ; Namadgi National Park ( ACT ) and in the Tasmanian Wilderness . 
 The Kiandra snow shoe club is easily among the oldest continuing ski clubs in the world and was established by Norwegian gold prospectors in the mid @-@ 19th century . The Australian gold rushes first brought a population of skiers to the Australian snowfields in the 1860s . Ski chalets were established closer to Mount Kosciuszko in the early 20th century and the construction of the Snowy Mountains Hydro @-@ Electric Scheme brought easier access and European workers with an interest in skiing , who helped build the modern ski resorts of New South Wales . In 2004 , a mogul course called " <unk> 's Dream " was constructed on Blue Cow . The Mount Buller World Aerials is an annual event on the World Cup calendar . Aerial skiers practice extensively on water before trying jumps on snow ; Camplin jumped in a pond outside Melbourne . The Kangaroo <unk> , a member of the Worldloppet Ski Federation series of cross @-@ country skiing races , is an annual citizen race that attracts competitors from several countries . Ski jumping is currently non @-@ existent in Australia . 
 Many major Australian cities have indoor ice rinks , enabling participation in some winter sports regardless of the climate . These began to appear at the end of the 19th century , and ice hockey was played as early as 1904 . Sydney hosted the 1991 short @-@ track speed skating World Championships , and the 2001 Goodwill Games — hosted in Brisbane — included figure skating . Australia has no tracks usable for bobsleigh , luge and skeleton , but there is a bobsleigh push track in the Docklands area of Melbourne . 
 In keeping with an existing tradition for Australian gold medallists at the Summer Olympics , Bradbury , Camplin and Begg @-@ Smith 's victories were recognised by Australia Post , which released stamps depicting their triumphs , and gave the athletes royalties for the use of their image . Due to the relative lack of interest in winter sport in Australia , both Camplin and Bradbury had been without sponsorship before their Olympic triumphs , and were effectively broke .

 The Olympic Winter Institute of Australia has programs in alpine skiing , freestyle skiing ( aerial and mogul ) , snowboarding , short track speed skating , figure skating and ( along with the Australian Institute of Sport ) skeleton . Australia also competed in biathlon , cross @-@ country skiing , bobsleigh and luge at the 2006 Winter Olympics . 
 = = = Alpine skiing = = = 
 Australia has competed in alpine skiing at every Olympics since 1952 . Australia 's first female skier , Christine Davy , competed in 1956 . Malcolm Milne was considered a possible <unk> at the 1972 Olympics , having finished on the podium at the world championships , but a knee injury and a near fall snuffed out his chances . 
 Steven Lee represented Australia at three Winter Olympics ; he won a World Cup event in <unk> , Japan in the Super G event in 1985 , and was the second Australian to do so . He achieved three top @-@ 25 finishes in his career . Zali Steggall won Australia 's second Olympic bronze in the slalom event in 1998 . Twelve skiers represented Australia at the 2002 Olympics with Jenny Owens achieving the best result in the Downhill Combined event with a 9th place . Four skiers represented Australia in 2006 and only half the number participated in 2010 . 
 = = = Biathlon = = = 
 Australia has participated in biathlon at every Olympics since 1984 except for 2002 ; Kerryn Rim 's eighth place in 1994 in the 15 km individual event was their best result . Cameron Morton represented Australia in 2006 and finished in the bottom 10 % in each of his two races . In 2010 , Australia 's sole representative Alexei <unk> came second last in his event — one competitor did not finish . Rim 's result remains the only top @-@ 20 finish by an Australian in the discipline , and more than 80 % of Australian entrants have finished in the bottom half of the field , including many in the bottom fifth . 
 = = = Figure skating = = = 
 Australia first competed in figure skating in 1952 , and has competed in 1956 , 1960 and every Olympics since 1980 . In earlier years , Australia earned some last places or near @-@ misses . Until 1988 , no Australian had placed above the 20th percentile , but results have slowly improved ; Anthony Liu finished 10th out of 28 competitors in the men 's event in 2002 . Joanne Carter represented Australia in 2006 . She had placed 12th in 2002 and apart from Liu is the only Australian to have placed in the top half of the field . In 2010 , Australia 's lone participant <unk> Lee came 20th . Australia has competed in ice dancing only twice — in 1988 and 2014 — when their solitary representative in both the men and women 's individual event came last . 
 = = = Freestyle skiing = = = 
 Australia has contested moguls freestyle skiing in every Olympics since it became an official sport in 1992 , as well as 1988 , when it was a demonstration sport . Australia has participated in every aerial freestyle event since it became official in 1994 , as well as 1992 , when it was a demonstration event . 
 Unlike in other winter disciplines , Australia started in the upper half of the field in the moguls ; Nicholas Cleaver and Adrian Costa placed 11th and 14th out of 47 competitors in 1992 . Since then , the results deteriorated into the lower half of the rankings , until 2006 , when Canadian @-@ born Dale Begg @-@ Smith won gold and four Australians qualified for the 35 @-@ man competition . Manuela Berchtold , the only female Australian representative in 2006 , came 14th out of 30 competitors . In 2010 , Begg @-@ Smith won silver , while two other moguls racers , one male and one female , were outside the top half and did not pass the first round . 
 Australia has been strong in women 's aerial skiing , having recruited gymnasts into the sport , and Kirstie Marshall and Jacqui Cooper have both been regarded as major medal chances in the last 15 years . However , both were plagued by injuries and crashes and failed to medal at the Olympic level despite enjoying success in World Cup or world @-@ championship events . Alisa Camplin won Australia 's second gold in 2002 . Australia fielded 4 of the 23 qualifiers in the women 's aerials in 2006 . Lydia Ierodiaconou injured herself when she landed badly in the second qualification jump and failed to reach the final . Camplin and Cooper contested the aerials finals , after the latter qualified first with a world record score of 213 @.@ 36 . Cooper managed only 152 @.@ 69 in the final and finished eighth , and Camplin went on to win bronze . In 2010 , Lassila ( née Ierodiaconou ) took gold . After being second after the first jump , she scored highly on her final attempt , and the leader Xu <unk> from China failed to land her second jump cleanly , sealing Lassila 's win . Cooper returned for a final campaign and came fifth , while Elizabeth Gardner came 12th in the final . In contrast , Australia has not had a strong male tradition . Until 2010 , no male had competed in aerials — one athlete was selected but did not end up taking to the snow due to injury . In 2010 , David Morris ended the trend and came 13th out of 25 entrants . 
 Ski cross was introduced in 2010 . Scott Kneller reach the semifinals and placed seventh in the male competition , while Jenny Owens and Katya Cremer came 13th and 15th , all in the top half of the field .

 Australia has competed in cross @-@ country skiing in 1952 , 1960 , 1968 , 1980 to 1998 , and since 2006 . The two Australian representatives in 1952 occupied the last two places , and before 1984 , no Australian finished above the bottom 15 % of racers . Results have slowly improved , but most Australian entrants in the last two decades have placed in the bottom 25 % . In 1992 , Anthony Evans became the first Australian to place in the top half , finishing in the top 40 in two events . Australia fielded three competitors in cross @-@ country skiing in 2006 , its largest contingent in the event . Paul Murray and Esther Bottomley competed in the sprint ; Clare @-@ Louise Brumley was selected for the pursuit and 30 km freestyle , but competed only in the former due to illness . Nobody broke into the top half in their respective races . At the 2010 Games , Australia had three representatives . Ben Sim came in the top half in one event , but he , Bottomley and Murray finished in the bottom 20 % in their remaining four events . Australia has never competed in ski jumping , and their sole entry in Nordic combined was by Hal <unk> in 1960 , who came last .

 The first Australian to compete in bobsleigh represented Great Britain . Frederick McEvoy drove the British two @-@ man and four @-@ man bobsleighs in 1936 , earning fourth place and a bronze respectively , and carried the British flag at the opening ceremony . Australia first competed in bobsleigh in 1988 , and has competed in the event in every Olympics since , except for 2002 . Paul <unk> became the first Australian to compete at both the Summer and Winter Olympics : he competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics in athletics , and participated in bobsleigh in 1992 as the brakeman . Australia competed in luge in 1992 and 1994 . They did not compete in skeleton in 2002 . 
 Australia competed in all three sports in 2006 . In bobsleigh , Australia competed in the two @-@ man and two @-@ woman events , and was the highest @-@ placed country to miss qualifications for an Olympic berth in the four @-@ man event at the 2006 Challenge Cup . The Australian Olympic Committee unsuccessfully tried to have the Brazilian bobsleigh team thrown out due to the use of drugs by Armando dos Santos , so that Australia would take its place . Hannah Campbell @-@ Pegg came 23rd in luge , and Michelle Steele , a beach flag sprinter chosen from a systematic program to identify a potential skeleton medal @-@ winner from female non @-@ winter athletes , came 13th due to inexperience with the intimidating and technical track . Shaun Boyle represented Australia in the men 's skeleton and placed 22nd . In 2010 , Australia were represented in every bobsled event , but all finished last , failed to finish due to crashes or had to withdraw due to injuries sustained in earlier races . Australia 's sole luger and two male skeleton racers came in the bottom 20 % , while Emma Lincoln @-@ Smith and Melissa Hoar came 10th and 12th respectively . Until 2010 , Australia had placed in the bottom half of the field in every sliding event it has entered , and came last in the luge in 1994 . Lincoln @-@ Smith 's effort in the skeleton in 2010 changed this record . 
 = = = Speed skating = = = 
 Australia has competed in either the long track or short track forms of speed skating at every Olympics that it has attended , except 1964 . Australia 's Winter Olympic inaugural participant was long track speed skater Kenneth Kennedy , who competed in 1936 and placed in the bottom 25 % in all of his four events . Colin Hickey finished seventh in 1956 in the 500 and 1 @,@ 000 m long track speed skating , and placed 13th and 14th four years later . Until 1968 , Hickey 's four aforementioned results were the only times that an Australian finished in the top half of their event . 
 Colin Coates participated in six Winter Olympics , from 1968 to 1988 , and came sixth in the 10 @,@ 000 m event in 1976 , Australia 's best result before Lillehammer . His four top @-@ 11 finishes in 1976 made him only the third Australian to place in the top half of a Winter Olympic event . Before the 1988 Olympics , three other athletes had represented Australia in long track racing , and all had placed near the bottom . In 1988 , Danny Kah and Michael Richmond both broke into the top 15 and the top half in two events each , and in 1994 , the former recorded Australia 's best long track result , finishing fifth in the 5 @,@ 000 m event . However , Australia did not compete in long track again until 2010 , when sole representative Sophie Muir became the first woman to compete for the country in the discipline ; she came in the bottom fifth of entrants in both her races . 
 Short track speed skating has provided the country with many firsts . Australia won its first World Championships in a winter sport when their relay team won the 5 @,@ 000 m race in 1991 , which was hosted in Sydney . However , they crashed at the 1992 Olympics when the discipline was introduced and failed to win a medal , and all of the individual competitors finished in the bottom half of the field . They recovered to post a series of strong performances in Lillehammer in 1994 . The short track relay yielded Australia 's first Winter Olympic medal , a bronze . The Australians also did well individually ; all four representatives finished in the top 13 in at least one of their races , and in the top half in six of their eight events , including top @-@ ten finishes for Steven Bradbury and Richard Nizielski . 
 Bradbury won Australia 's first winter gold medal in Salt Lake City in 2002 , when he was the " last man standing " in the 1 @,@ 000 m event . Five men and Emily Rosemond competed in short track in 2006 . Rosemond placed 12th in the 1 @,@ 000 m , but none of the others managed to pass the first round . From 1994 to 2006 , Bradbury ( three times in 2002 ) and Rosemond have been the only two Australians to finish in the top half of the field , and the men 's relay team has missed the final on every occasion . In 2010 , the sole male race Lachlan Hay was eliminated in the first round , while the sole female , Tatiana <unk> made the semifinals in two events , placing 7th and 11th .

 Zeke Steggall — brother of Zali — represented Australia in snowboarding 's first two appearances at the Olympics in 1998 and 2002 , finishing in the bottom 20 % in each of his slalom races . The number of events in the discipline was increased and the 2006 team consisted of nine athletes , who competed in all three events for both men and women . 
 The team representing Australia at the 2006 Winter Olympics was Mitchell Allan ( halfpipe ) , Torah Bright ( halfpipe ) , Andrew Burton ( halfpipe ) , Holly Crawford ( halfpipe ) , Damon Hayler ( snowboard cross ) , Ben Mates ( halfpipe ) , Emanuel Oppliger ( parallel giant slalom ) , Johanna Shaw ( parallel giant slalom ) and Emily Thomas ( snowboard cross ) . Bright came fifth , and Hayler came seventh , and the pair were the only Australians — apart from Oppliger ( 15th ) — to finish in the top half of their respective events . In 2010 , Bright returned and won gold . After falling in her first run in the final — only the highest of the two runs is counted — she had to perform her second run before all the other competitors as she was ranked last after the first phase , and produced the top @-@ score , which the others could not match . Crawford came eighth in the final . Australia 's two male competitors Mates and Scott James finished in the middle of the field and missed the finals . In the snowboard cross , Hayler came tenth , while Alex Pullin was fastest in the qualification time trial , but crashed in the first round of racing , while the sole female racer Stephanie Hickey finished near bottom . Shaw was again Australia 's sole slalom racer , and ended in the bottom half . 
 = = Australia at the Winter Paralympics = = 
 Australia has competed in every Winter Paralympics since the inaugural games in 1976 . Their sole participant in 1976 was Ron Finneran , although he was not an official entrant . In 1980 , alpine and cross @-@ country skier <unk> <unk> and cross @-@ country skier Peter Rickards became the first official competitors for Australia . The number of Australian athletes increased to three , five , five and six at the next four games , respectively , and all of the athletes were alpine skiers . The participation decreased to four in 1998 and climbed back up to six in 2002 . Australia won its first Winter Paralympic medals in 1992 , and has medalled at every games since then . All of the medals have been won in alpine skiing . 
 Australia won four medals in 1992 — one gold , one silver and two bronze . Michael Milton , an amputee alpine skier , won gold in the slalom and silver in the super @-@ G. In paraplegic sit @-@ skiing , David Munk won bronze in the super @-@ G , and Michael Norton won bronze in the downhill . In 1994 , Australia won three gold , two silver and four bronze medals . Milton won gold in the giant slalom , silver in the slalom and bronze in the downhill and super @-@ G , and Norton won gold in the slalom and super @-@ G. James Patterson , a skier with cerebral palsy , won silver in the downhill and bronze in the giant slalom . Munk won another bronze , this time in the giant slalom . In 1998 , Australia won two medals , both through Paterson : gold in the downhill and bronze in the slalom . 
 In 2002 , Australia 's medal count consisted of six golds and one silver . Milton swept his disability class , winning gold in the downhill , super @-@ G , giant slalom and slalom . Bart Bunting , a vision @-@ impaired skier guided by Nathan Chivers , won gold in the downhill and super @-@ G , and silver in the giant slalom . 
 In 2006 , Emily Jansen , a leg amputee alpine skier , became Australia first female Winter Paralympian . James Millar , born without his right forearm , competed in the cross @-@ country and the biathlon , becoming the first Australian to compete in an event outside alpine skiing . Milton attended his last Paralympics , but did not win a medal . A target of two medals was set , which took into account the merging of several disability classes . Australia met this target , as Milton won silver in the downhill and Toby Kane won bronze in the super @-@ G. In 2010 , Australia won a silver and three bronze , all in alpine skiing . Jessica Gallagher became the first Australian woman to win a medal , taking bronze in the slalom for the visually impaired . Cameron Rahles <unk> won bronze in both the slalom and super combined . 
 = Battle of Zadar = 
 The Battle of Zadar ( Croatian : Bitka za Zadar ) was a military engagement between the Yugoslav People 's Army ( Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija , or JNA ) , supported by the Croatian Serb Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina ( SAO Krajina ) , and the Croatian National Guard ( Zbor Narodne Garde , or ZNG ) , supported by the Croatian Police . The battle was fought north and east of the city of Zadar , Croatia , in the second half of September and early October 1991 during the Croatian War of Independence . Although the JNA 's initial orders were to lift the Croatian siege of the JNA 's barracks in the city and isolate the region of Dalmatia from the rest of Croatia , the orders were amended during the battle to include capturing the Port of Zadar in the city centre . The JNA 's advance was supported by the Yugoslav Air Force and Navy . 
 Fighting stopped on 5 October , when a cease @-@ fire agreement was reached by the belligerents after the JNA reached the outskirts of Zadar and blocked all land routes to the city . Subsequent negotiations resulted in a partial withdrawal of the JNA , restoring road access to Zadar via the Adriatic Highway and the evacuation of JNA facilities in the city . The JNA achieved a portion of its stated objectives ; while it blocked the Maslenica Bridge ( the last overland route between the Croatian capital of Zagreb and Zadar ) , a road via Pag Island ( relying on a ferry ) remained open . The JNA Zadar garrison was evacuated as a result of negotiations , but the ZNG captured several relatively small JNA posts in the city . The port was never captured by the JNA , although it was blockaded by the Yugoslav Navy . 
 The September – October fighting caused 34 civilian deaths in Zadar from the artillery bombardment . Croatia later charged 19 JNA officers involved in the offensive with war crimes against the civilian population ; they were tried , convicted in absentia and sentenced to prison . 
 = = Background = = 
 After the 1990 electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia ethnic tensions between Croats and Croatian Serbs worsened , and the Yugoslav People 's Army ( Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija , or JNA ) confiscated Croatia 's Territorial Defence ( Teritorijalna obrana , or TO ) weapons to minimize resistance . On 17 August an open revolt broke out among the Croatian Serbs , centred on the predominantly Serb @-@ populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland near Knin and parts of Lika , Kordun , Banovina and Slavonia . 
 After two unsuccessful attempts by Serbia ( supported by Montenegro and Serbia 's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo ) to obtain the Yugoslav Presidency 's approval for a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces in January 1991 and a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March , the JNA ( supported by Serbia and its allies ) asked the federal Presidency to give it wartime powers and declare a state of emergency . The request was denied on 15 March , and the JNA was brought under the control of Serbian President Slobodan Milošević . Milošević , preferring the expansion of Serbia to the preservation of Yugoslavia , threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the federal Presidency . The threat caused the JNA to gradually replace plans to preserve Yugoslavia with Serbian expansion . By the end of March , the conflict escalated after the first fatalities during an incident at Plitvice Lakes . The JNA stepped in , supporting the insurgents and preventing the Croatian police from intervening . In early April , leaders of the Serb revolt in Croatia declared their intention to integrate the area under their control with Serbia ; this was seen by the Government of Croatia as an intention to secede from Croatia . 
 At the beginning of 1991 , Croatia had no regular army ; to bolster its defence , the country doubled its police personnel to about 20 @,@ 000 . The most effective portion of the force was the 3 @,@ 000 @-@ strong special police , deployed in 12 battalions with a military structure ; an additional 9 @,@ 000 – 10 @,@ 000 regionally organized reserve police were grouped into 16 battalions and 10 independent companies . Although most were equipped with small arms , a portion of the force was unarmed . In May the Croatian government responded by forming the Croatian National Guard ( Zbor narodne garde , or ZNG ) , but its development was hampered by a United Nations ( UN ) arms embargo introduced in September . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 In April and early May , ethnic tensions in Zadar and northern Dalmatia escalated after increased sabotage activities targeting communications , the power distribution grid and other property . On 2 May , the situation continued to deteriorate after the killings of Croatian policemen at Borovo Selo and Franko Lisica ( a member of the Croatian special police ) in the village of <unk> ( near Zadar ) by Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina ( SAO Krajina ) troops . The news incited riots in Zadar that day , with crowds marching through the city centre demanding weapons to confront the Croatian Serbs and smashing the windows of shops owned by Serbian companies and Serbs living in the city . Croat @-@ owned businesses in Knin were destroyed in retaliation during the night of 7 – 8 May . The JNA took an active role in events in nearby Benkovac on 19 May , distributing a leaflet with the names of 41 Croats targeted for immediate execution and providing weapons to SAO Krajina forces in the area . In late May , the conflict gradually escalated to exchanges of mortar fire . 
 From late June through July , northern Dalmatia saw daily armed skirmishes but no actual combat ; nonetheless , the conflict 's increasing intensity in the region ( and elsewhere in Croatia ) caused residents of Zadar to build bomb shelters . SAO Krajina authorities called up three TO units in the Zadar hinterland on 11 July ( a day after the fatal shooting of a Croatian police patrol in the Zadar area ) , and at the end of July the JNA 9th ( Knin ) Corps began conscripting the Serb population in Benkovac to strengthen its ranks . On 1 August , Croatia deployed two battalions of the ZNG 4th Guards Brigade to Kruševo ( near Obrovac ) ; they were involved in combat with the SAO Krajina TO and police forces two days later , the first engagement of the Croatian War of Independence in the region . Growing appetites of the SAO Krajina were announced in mid @-@ August , when Milan Martić , one of its leaders , spoke of a planned conquest of Zadar . Later that month , the JNA openly sided with the SAO Krajina . On 26 August the 9th ( Knin ) Corps troops and artillery ( commanded by chief of staff Colonel Ratko Mladić ) attacked the village of Kijevo , advancing with SAO Krajina forces to expel all Croats from the village . Another regional setback for Croatia was the 11 September JNA capture of the Maslenica Bridge , cutting the last overland road link between Dalmatia and the rest of Croatia . 
 On 14 September the ZNG and Croatian police blockaded and cut utilities to all accessible JNA facilities , beginning the Battle of the Barracks . The move affected 33 large JNA garrisons in Croatia and a number of smaller facilities ( including border posts and <unk> and ammunition @-@ storage depots ) , forcing the JNA to change its plans for the Croatian campaign . 
 = = Timeline = = 
 = = = September = = = 
 The planned JNA campaign included an advance in the Zadar area by the 9th ( Knin ) Corps . The corps began its operations against the ZNG on 16 September ; fully mobilised and prepared for deployment , it was tasked with isolating Dalmatia from the rest of Croatia . To achieve this , its units advanced with its main axis directed at Vodice and supporting advances directed towards Zadar , Drniš and Sinj . The initial push was intended to create conditions favouring attacks on Zadar , Šibenik and Split . The bulk of the JNA 221st Mechanised Brigade , with its battalion of World War II @-@ vintage T @-@ 34 tanks replaced by a battalion of M @-@ 84 tanks from the corps reserve , was committed to the main axis of the attack and supported by elements of the SAO Krajina TO . The secondary advance ( towards Biograd na Moru ) was assigned to the 180th Mechanised Brigade ( supported by the T @-@ 34 battalion detached from the 221st Brigade ) , the 557th Mixed Antitank Artillery Regiment and elements of the SAO Krajina TO . Further elements of the 221st Brigade were detached from the main axis and tasked with lifting the ZNG blockade of JNA garrisons in the Sinj and Drniš areas . The overall offensive was supported by the 9th Mixed Artillery Regiment and the 9th Military Police Battalion . Despite its initial secondary role , the 3 @,@ 000 @-@ strong 180th Brigade became the main attacking force deployed against Zadar . The city was defended by elements of the 4th Guards Brigade , the 112th Infantry Brigade , the independent Benkovac – <unk> and Škabrnja battalions of the ZNG and the police . Although the JNA estimated Croatian troop strength at approximately 4 @,@ 500 , the Croatian units were poorly armed . The city 's defence was commanded by Colonel Josip <unk> , head of the Zadar Sector of the 6th ( Split ) Operational Zone . 
 The offensive began at 16 : 00 on 16 September ; by the second day , JNA 9th ( Knin ) Corps commanding officer Major General Vladimir Vuković modified the initial plan because of significant resistance from the ZNG and Croatian police ( who relied on populated areas and terrain features to hold back the JNA ) . Vuković 's changes involved diverting part of the force to attack Drniš and Sinj , resting the remainder of the attacking force . These orders were confirmed on 18 September by the JNA Military @-@ Maritime District commander , Vice Admiral Mile <unk> . The Yugoslav Navy began a blockade of the Croatian Adriatic coast on 17 September , further isolating Zadar , and the city 's electricity supply was cut on the first day of the JNA attack . The ZNG was driven out of <unk> , towards Škabrnja , on 18 September . Croatian forces captured seven JNA facilities in Zadar , the most significant the <unk> <unk> barracks and depot . The captures provided the ZNG with about 2 @,@ 500 rifles , 100 M @-@ 53 machine guns and ammunition , although the Yugoslav Air Force bombed the barracks on 22 September in an unsuccessful attempt to hinder removal of the weapons . The captured weapons bolstered the Croatian defence , but JNA attacks north of the city resulted in a stalemate ; Croatian forces were spread too thin to defend the city and capture the remaining barracks , and the besieged JNA garrisons were too weak to break out . 
 After this there was a lull in fighting in the Zadar area until the end of the month , with only sporadic small @-@ arms fire and minor skirmishes . During that period , the JNA 's efforts were concentrated on the Battle of Šibenik and an advance towards Sinj . Although the ZNG defended Šibenik and Sinj it lost Drniš , abandoning it before the JNA 's arrival on 23 September . During the last week of September the JNA returned its focus to Zadar , stepping up its artillery bombardment of the city and ending its naval blockade on 23 September . On 29 September the JNA edged towards Zadar , capturing the villages of <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> and announcing its intention to evacuate its Zadar barracks ( which was affected by desertions ) . 
 = = = October = = = 
 The fighting picked up again on 2 October , when a JNA tank @-@ and @-@ infantry attack on Nadin — the northernmost point of ZNG resistance in the Zadar area — was repelled . On 3 October , the Yugoslav Navy reinstated its Adriatic blockade . That day , the JNA 9th ( Knin ) Corps ordered a new push towards Zadar to relieve the city 's JNA barracks , destroy the ZNG ( or drive it from the city ) and capture the Port of Zadar in the city centre . The attacking force was augmented by the 1st Battalion of the 592nd Mechanised Brigade . The offensive began at 13 : 00 on 4 October , supported by artillery , naval and air forces . The besieged JNA garrisons in the city , except for the Šepurine barracks garrison , also provided mortar and sniper support . The 271st Light Artillery Regiment and the 60th Medium Self @-@ Propelled Missile Regiment of the Yugoslav Air Defence , based in Šepurine , broke through the Croatian siege and joined the advancing JNA force . Although the ZNG and the police held the city and inflicted many casualties , by the night of 4 – 5 October Zadar was besieged by the JNA ; this forced the Croatian authorities to request a cease @-@ fire and negotiations . 
 The cease @-@ fire was agreed at 16 : 00 on 5 October , and scheduled to begin two hours later ; negotiations were set for 09 : 00 the following day . However , the fighting continued ; negotiations did not take place as originally planned , with the JNA citing the Croatian general mobilization as the reason for their cancellation . Two days of negotiations then began at Zadar Airbase on 7 October . The talks involved Zadar JNA commander Vuković , Colonel <unk> <unk> and Colonel Momčilo Perišić . Major <unk> <unk> represented the General Staff of the HV at the talks , with <unk> representing the regional defence command . With additional input from Zadar civilian representatives Ivo <unk> and <unk> Kero , the cease @-@ fire went into effect at noon on 10 October . On 8 October , during the negotiations , Croatia declared its independence from SFR Yugoslavia .

 The JNA 9th ( Knin ) Corps had completed a significant part of its assigned task before the overall offensive against Croatian forces began in the second half of September by capturing the Maslenica Bridge , which blocked the Adriatic Highway and almost @-@ completely isolated Dalmatia from the rest of Croatia . This isolation was reinforced by the Yugoslav Navy blockade , which lasted until 13 October . However , the cease @-@ fire agreement ended the JNA siege and a supply route to Zadar was opened via the Pag Island road . The JNA remained on the outskirts of the city , threatening the ZNG defences . Although the ZNG and the police could not withstand the JNA forces ( supported by artillery and armour ) , they held Zadar ; the city celebrates its defence on 6 October each year . 
 The cease @-@ fire agreement also provided for the evacuation of the JNA Zadar garrison . The evacuation , encompassing six barracks and 3 @,@ 750 people , began on 11 October and took 15 days to complete . The JNA removed 2 @,@ 190 – 2 @,@ 250 truckloads of weapons and equipment and the personal effects of JNA personnel and their families . Evacuated personnel and equipment were required to be removed from Croatian soil ; the JNA complied , except for its artillery ( which was primarily left for the SAO Krajina TO ) . The JNA also transferred 20 truckloads of weapons to the SAO Krajina TO in the area . On 18 October , the ZNG Independent Benkovac – <unk> Battalion merged with the 1st Battalion of the 112th Brigade to create the 134th Infantry Brigade . 
 The exact number of casualties sustained by the ZNG , the police or the JNA has never been reported ; in Zadar , 34 civilians were killed and 120 structures damaged by artillery fire during September and October 1991 . A group of 19 JNA officers , including Perišić and Mladić , were tried in absentia and convicted by a Croatian court for war crimes against the civilian population . 
 = = = Renewed fighting = = = 
 After the JNA completed its evacuation of the Zadar garrison , its force north of the city regrouped and launched a new offensive on 18 November with infantry and armoured units ( supported by artillery bombardment and close air support ) . The attack targeted the villages of Škabrnja , Gorica , Nadin and <unk> Donji . Škabrnja was captured on the first day after an air assault by a battalion of the JNA 63rd Parachute Brigade , and Nadin fell on 19 November . During and immediately after the attack on Škabrnja , the JNA and the supporting SAO Krajina TO forces killed 39 civilians and 14 ZNG soldiers in what became known as the Škabrnja massacre . Some of those killed were buried in a mass grave in the village ; twenty @-@ seven victims were exhumed in 1995 , after the end of the war . Another seven civilians were killed in Nadin . 
 On 21 November the JNA and the SAO Krajina TO destroyed the Maslenica Bridge and began reorienting their main effort towards Novigrad , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , on the right flank of the Zadar sector . Those efforts culminated on 31 December 1991 – 1 January 1992 , when the four settlements were captured . On 3 January the JNA attacked <unk> and <unk> Donji , again threatening the road to Pag and Zadar ; however , the advances failed . Zadar was bombarded by artillery during the offensive . A plan by the JNA 9th ( Knin ) Corps to advance to the Adriatic coast at Pirovac ( east of Zadar ) was drawn up by 30 December 1991 under the codename Strike 91 ( Udar 91 ) , but was not implemented . This period saw more war crimes committed by SAO Krajina troops , including the killing of nine civilians and a JNA member in the <unk> massacre on 21 December . Fighting stopped again on 3 January when a new cease @-@ fire , based on a peace plan brokered by United Nations Special Envoy Cyrus Vance , went into effect . 
 In early 1992 , the Independent Škabrnja Battalion became the 1st Battalion of the 159th Infantry Brigade . Control of the battlefield changed slightly during the night of 22 – 23 May 1992 , when Croatian forces captured Križ Hill ( near <unk> , southeast of Zadar ) ; this improved security along the Adriatic Highway . Another change took place in January – February 1993 , when Croatian troops recaptured part of the Zadar hinterland in Operation Maslenica . The rest of the region was recaptured by Croatia during Operation Storm in August 1995 .

 The 2002 – 03 South @-@ West Indian Ocean cyclone season was one of the longest lasting and the second @-@ most active season in the South @-@ West Indian ocean . Storms during the season impacted the Mascarene Islands , Seychelles , Madagascar , and countries in southeastern Africa . The season began early when an unnamed tropical storm struck Seychelles in September , becoming the most damaging storm there in 50 years . The next system , Atang , was the first named storm of the season , but was only a tropical depression ; it was named due to the threat to an outer island of Mauritius . Atang later struck Tanzania in a climatologically unusual area in November , resulting in unconfirmed deaths of fishermen . The first named storm to reach tropical storm intensity was Boura , which brushed the Mascarene Islands with gusty winds and rainfall . In December , Cyclone Crystal threatened to strike Mauritius but instead veered eastward , and later , Tropical Storm Delfina lasted from late December through early January 2003 . Delfina damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in Mozambique and Malawi , killing 54 people . 
 In January 2003 , Severe Tropical Storm Ebula continued the steady activity , forming in the eastern portion of the basin . Later , Tropical Storm Fari crossed southern Madagascar with heavy rains , causing flooding and mudslides that left 3 @,@ 400 people homeless . In February , there were four simultaneous tropical cyclones in the Indian Ocean , three of which in the basin . Cyclone Gerry formed first and the farthest west , passing just east of Mauritius and killing one person there . Cyclone Hape formed shortly thereafter , and Tropical Storm Isha formed farther east , having originated from the Australian basin . Cyclone Japhet struck southern Mozambique and produced widespread flooding in southeastern Africa , killing 25 people . In March , Cyclone Kalunde was the strongest storm of the season , reaching 10 @-@ minute sustained winds of 215 km / h ( 135 mph ) . It struck Rodrigues while weakening , damaging 1 @,@ 600 houses and causing an island @-@ wide power outage . About a month later , a subtropical cyclone named Luma intensified southeast of Madagascar and developed an eye . Lastly , Cyclone Manou was only the sixth May tropical cyclones on record , making a rare landfall in southeastern Madagascar , killing 89 people and destroying thousands of houses . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 Météo @-@ France 's meteorological office in Réunion ( MFR ) is the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the South @-@ West Indian Ocean , tracking all tropical cyclones from the east coast of Africa to 90 ° E. At the beginning of the season , the MFR moved the tropical cyclone year from August 1 to July 1 . The Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) , which is a joint United States Navy – United States Air Force task force that issues tropical cyclone warnings for the region , also issued advisories for storms during the season . 
 During the season , MFR issued advisories on 16 systems , of which 13 intensified to reach tropical storm force winds , meaning conditions were generally favorable for tropical cyclogenesis . The 13 systems with tropical storm force winds is only one short of the most such storms since the beginning of satellite @-@ tracking in the 1967 – 68 season , set in the 1993 – 94 season . This is four more than the average of nine named storms . In this season , there were 24 days on which tropical cyclones were active , slightly above normal , but only one storm – Kalunde – remained at that intensity for more than three days . By contrast , there were 68 days in which a tropical storm was active in the basin , which is 15 days above normal . The season began early and ended late ; only four seasons began earlier and four ended later than this season since the start of satellite @-@ coverage in the basin . 
 In addition to the named storms and an unnamed tropical storm in September , there was one non @-@ developing tropical depression . On December 25 , Tropical Depression 05 developed in the northeastern portion of the basin . It moved to the south and later southeast , crossing into the Australian region on December 27 . A day later , the JTWC issued its last advisory .

 = = = Moderate Tropical Storm 01 = = = 
 In late August , a weak low @-@ level circulation persisted near Diego Garcia . It was associated with a trough near the equator , and initially remained disorganized due to high wind shear . The disturbance was located at a low latitude near the equator , and a ridge extending from the eastern coast of Africa imparted a general west @-@ southwest movement . The system was organized enough to be classified by MFR on September 4 at 2 @.@ 5 ° S. Subsequently , the system developed more convection as its circulation became better defined . Operationally , MFR began issuing warnings on September 5 on Tropical Disturbance 01 , and the next day upgraded it to a tropical depression . Post analysis from MFR indicated that the system reached peak winds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) on September 6 , the same day that the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) initiated advisories on it as Tropical Cyclone 01S . The storm developed banding features , but the thunderstorms were sheared away from the circulation . On September 7 , the storm moved through Seychelles – an island nation in the southern Indian Ocean – before weakening . MFR discontinued advisories on September 8 , and the JTWC followed suit the next day . 
 While moving through Seychelles , the storm produced a microburst that last for two hours across several islands , producing wind gusts up to 130 km / h ( 81 mph ) on Praslin . Heavy rainfall affected Praslin , La Digue , and particularly Mahé , which reported 327 @.@ 1 mm ( 12 @.@ 88 in ) in a 24 ‑ hour period . Damage on Mahé was limited to landslides and some flooding . On Praslin , high winds damaged the roofs of over 50 houses and destroyed six homes , while the airport was also damaged . The winds damaged 50 power lines , causing an island @-@ wide power outage . High winds also downed about 30 @,@ 000 trees , which blocked roads but were quickly removed . Due to widespread tree damage , Cousin Island – a nature preserve – was closed for about two weeks , accounting for about $ 50 @,@ 000 ( 2002 USD , <unk> rupees ) in damage . Nationwide , the storm left 375 families homeless and damaged crop fields , becoming the most damaging in the country in 50 years . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Atang = = = 
 Convection persisted near a broad circulation on November 3 to the west of Diego Garcia . The system moved westward and organized due to generally favorable conditions . MFR classified it as Tropical Disturbance 02 on November 4 . Two days later , the agency upgraded it to Tropical Depression 2 , and shortly thereafter the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 02S . At that time , the storm was moving to the southwest toward the Mauritius outer island of Agaléga , developing improved outflow . To emphasize the threat , the Meteorological Service of Mauritius named the system Atang , despite it only being a tropical depression . Late on November 6 , JTWC estimated peak winds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) , around the same time that Atang began a slow motion to the southwest . The next day , the depression resumed a westward motion and became disorganized , with several circulations , and the JTWC and MFR both discontinued advisories . The remnants of Atang again turned to the southwest and re @-@ intensified , prompting JTWC and MFR to re @-@ issue advisories on November 9 . By that time , the outflow improved , although it maintained multiple circulations . Atang passed near the north coast of Madagascar on November 10 after turning to the west , and that day the JTWC again discontinued advisories . After another period of re @-@ organization , the agency again re @-@ issued advisories on Atang on November 11 over the Mozambique Channel . The next day , the system moved inland in southeastern Tanzania , and dissipated shortly thereafter . 
 In northern Mozambique , Atang produced moderate but beneficial rainfall in Cabo Delgado Province . The landfall area does not usually experience tropical cyclones , and damage in Mozambique was minimal . In Tanzania , there were unofficial reports that Atang killed several fishermen and caused heavy rainfall with wind gusts to 148 km / h ( 92 mph ) . 
 = = = Tropical Cyclone Boura = = = 
 A strong area of winds near the equator developed an area of convection on November 14 to the east @-@ northeast of Diego Garcia . It quickly developed outflow and a distinct circulation , becoming a tropical depression late on November 14 . Early on November 15 , MFR upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Boura , and later that day the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 03S . With a ridge to the southeast , the storm moved quickly southwestward . Easterly wind shear prevented significant intensification until the circulation became established beneath the convection . On November 17 , Boura intensified to reach 10 @-@ minute winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) , making it a tropical cyclone . The JTWC upgraded Boura to the same intensity that day but in 1 @-@ minute winds , or the equivalent of a minimal hurricane . The cyclone intensified slightly further to peak winds of 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) . 
 Boura maintained its peak winds for about 18 hours , during which wind shear began to increase . The cyclone weakened as it curved more to the west , a change due to a ridge to the south . The JTWC estimated that Boura maintained peak winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) . Initially , the storm retained good outflow and convection , and Boura passed just north of St. Brandon on November 19 , producing 54 @.@ 5 mm ( 2 @.@ 15 in ) of rainfall and wind gusts of 106 km / h ( 66 mph ) . While the storm turned to the west and northwest , it interacted with the ridge to the south to produce wind gusts of 118 km / h ( 74 mph ) and 111 km / h ( 69 mph ) on Mauritius and Réunion , respectively . The convection gradually diminished , and on November 22 Boura weakened to tropical depression status while the JTWC discontinued advisories . The circulation continued to the northwest , devoid of convection . After turning to the northeast on November 25 , Boura dissipated a day later north of Madagascar . 
 = = = Tropical Cyclone Crystal = = = 
 For several days in mid @-@ December , tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated a storm to form to the southwest of Diego Garcia , which was proven true when an area of convection formed in that area , becoming a tropical disturbance on December 21 , the fourth of the season . On December 23 , MFR upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression , and later that day to Tropical Storm Crystal . The storm moved southwestward toward Mauritius due to a ridge to the southeast . Strengthening was gradual , and the JTWC upgraded Crystal to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane late on December 24 . The next day , an eye developed , although dry air initially prevented much further intensification . MFR upgraded Crystal to tropical cyclone status on December 26 , and that day the cyclone passed just east of St. Brandon . Subsequently , Crystal intensified quickly after the eye became clearer , reaching peak winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) on December 27 . Around that time , the storm passed east of Mauritius as it turned to the south while rounding the ridge . After maintaining peak winds for about 18 hours , Crystal weakened , gradually undergoing extratropical transition . The convection diminished over the center , and Crystal weakened to tropical storm status on December 28 . The next day , the JTWC and MFR discontinued advisories , labeling the storm as extratropical . The remnants continued to the southeast , dissipating on January 3 after crossing into the Australian region . 
 While passing just east of St. Brandon , Crystal produced wind gusts of 91 km / h ( 56 mph ) . The storm initially threatened to strike Mauritius , but effects were minimal due to the island being on the dry southwest quadrant of the storm . Crystal produced wind gusts of 91 km / h ( 56 mph ) . Rainfall reached 58 @.@ 8 mm ( 2 @.@ 31 in ) , although minimal precipitation occurred in northern Mauritius . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Delfina = = = 
 In late December , a tropical disturbance rapidly formed off the northwest coast of Madagascar . By late on December 30 , MFR classified it as a tropical disturbance . The system quickly intensified while moving westward , becoming a strong tropical storm before hitting northeastern Mozambique on December 31 . Delfina weakened while moving inland , and it was no longer classifiable as a tropical cyclone by January 1 . However , its remnants moved across the country and into Malawi , later looping around and crossing back over Mozambique . When the remnants reached the Mozambique Channel , they were reclassified as Tropical Disturbance 07 , which moved southward over waters . It re @-@ intensified into a tropical storm on January 8 before weakening the next day , becoming extratropical . The remnants persisted for several days , dissipating on January 14 . 
 In both Mozambique and Malawi , Delfina dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding . In the former country , over 18 @,@ 000 houses were severely damaged or destroyed , leaving thousands homeless . The storm damaged roads and bridges , which disrupted relief efforts in the aftermath , and floods destroyed widespread areas of crops in the midst of an ongoing food shortage . Lingering flooding caused an outbreak of cholera and malaria in Mozambique , and 47 people were killed by Delfina . In Malawi , flooding was not widespread , although the storm destroyed about 3 @,@ 600 houses . Delfina killed eight people in the country . Only two months after the storm struck , however , Cyclone Japhet left damage and deaths in many of the same areas that Delfina affected . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Ebula = = = 
 An area of convection persisted on January 6 to the southwest of Diego Garcia with an associated circulation . It moved generally southward southwest within an area of generally favorable conditions , becoming Tropical Disturbance 08 on January 7 . Thunderstorms increased , and the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 09S early on January 8 . The next day , MFR upgraded it to Tropical Storm Ebula . Outflow became more pronounced and the storm continued to intensify . On January 10 , the JTWC upgraded Ebula to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane , and estimated peak winds of 115 km / h ( 75 mph ) , just shy of tropical cyclone status . Subsequently , increased wind shear imparted weakening . After having spent much of its duration moving generally southward , Ebula turned to the southeast on January 11 due to a ridge to the south moving farther east . The thunderstorms diminished , and the JTWC discontinued advisories on January 12 . That day , MFR declared that Ebula became extratropical , and the remnants dissipated on January 15 . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Fari = = = 
 An area of convection persisted on January 20 to the east @-@ southeast of Diego Garcia , quickly developing outflow due to minimal wind shear . It moved to the southwest and its circulation became better defined . On January 23 , the MFR initiated advisories on Tropical Disturbance 09 , and later that day the JTWC issued a TCFA . Subsequently , the MFR upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression and the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 11S . Shortly thereafter , the system weakened and the circulation became exposed from the deep convection . The JTWC discontinued advisories on January 24 , but MFR continued tracking the disturbance as it moved to the west . After reaching an area of low wind shear , thunderstorms again increased over the center , and the JTWC re @-@ issued advisories on January 28 . By that time , the system was nearing eastern Madagascar , and later that day MFR upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Fari . Early on January 29 , MFR estimated peak winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) , making Fari a moderate tropical storm . Shortly thereafter , the storm made landfall on Madagascar just south of Mahanoro . Fari quickly weakened into a tropical depression while crossing the country , emerging into the Mozambique Channel early on January 30 . After the storm turned to the south , the MFR and JTWC declared Fari extratropical on January 31 , and the remnants dissipated on February 2 . 
 Tropical Storm Fari struck Madagascar after the country had experienced weeks of heavy rainfall , causing widespread flooding . In the area where it moved ashore , the storm flooded crop fields that damaged most of the banana and fruit trees . The storm left landslides that isolated Marolambo and caused damage in other towns . Fari left 3 @,@ 400 people homeless and caused an outbreak of conjunctivitis and diarrhea . 
 = = = Intense Tropical Cyclone Gerry = = = 
 On February 5 , MFR began tracking a tropical disturbance to the east of Madagascar 's northern coast . The system moved to the southwest before turning to the north on February 7 . By that day , the system had persistent convection around a weak circulation , located in an area of low wind shear . On February 8 , the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 16S , although initially the circulation was broad and exposed from the thunderstorms . The next day , MFR upgraded the depression to tropical storm status , and the Meteorological Services of Mauritius named the system Gerry . The storm turned to the south toward Mauritius and steadily intensified . On February 12 , the JTWC upgraded Gerry to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane , and shortly thereafter MFR upgraded the storm to a tropical cyclone . Around that time , Gerry began undergoing rapid deepening , becoming an intense tropical cyclone early on February 13 while developing a well @-@ defined eye and outflow . That day , the cyclone passed about 120 km ( 75 mi ) east of Mauritius . At that time , the JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 195 km / h ( 120 mph ) , and MFR estimated peak 10 minute winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) . Subsequently , Gerry began weakening due to increasing wind shear , with the eye becoming disorganized . Later , the convection separated from the deepest convection , and the cyclone weakened to tropical storm status on February 14 . The next day , JTWC discontinued advisories , and on February 16 MFR declared Jerry extratropical . The remnants dissipated two days later . 
 Early in its duration , Gerry passed just west of Tromelin Island , producing tropical storm force winds and gusts to 111 km / h ( 69 mph ) . The cyclone originally threatened to strike Mauritius directly , but due to a more east @-@ southeasterly motion , Gerry passed more to the east . The storm forced the closure of Sir <unk> <unk> International Airport , along with schools and government offices . Wind gusts on Mauritius reached 144 km / h ( 90 mph ) . Gerry dropped heavy rainfall , peaking at 139 @.@ 2 mm ( 5 @.@ 48 in ) at Mare aux Vacoas , and it produced high waves along the northern coast . One person was killed who was electrocuted during the storm 's passage . 
 = = = Tropical Cyclone Hape = = = 
 Around the same time that Tropical Storm Gerry was developing , another area of convection to its east was organizing . On February 7 , the system became a tropical disturbance , and initially moved to the north . Operationally , MFR first began issuing advisories on February 9 for Tropical Disturbance 11 , when the system had a small center and accompanying convection . By that time , the disturbance had turned to the south , and favorable conditions allowed for gradual development . MFR upgraded the system to tropical storm status late on February 9 , although the system was not named Hape until 36 hours later . On February 10 , the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 17S . An eye developed on February 11 , suggesting quick intensification . At 1800 UTC that day , the JTWC and MFR upgraded Hape to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane and to tropical cyclone status , respectively . By that time , the cyclone had turned to the east @-@ northeast due to a weakness in a ridge to the north . MFR estimated that Hape reached peak 10 @-@ minute winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) on February 12 , and the next day the JTWC estimated 1 @-@ minute winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) . Later , the storm weakened , and it turned to the southeast when the ridge re @-@ intensified . Outflow decreased due to interaction with Cyclone Gerry to the west , and Hape weakened to tropical storm status on February 13 . On February 15 , the JTWC discontinued advisories once the circulation was exposed from the deep convection . The next day , MFR followed suit after the circulation dissipated . 
 = = = Moderate Tropical Storm Isha = = = 
 Widespread convection in the monsoon trough persisted across the southeastern Indian Ocean in early February . One area was tracked by the JTWC on February 3 in the Australian basin , southwest of Indonesia . The system moved westward without development , crossing into the basin on February 8 . The next day , MFR began tracking the system as a tropical disturbance . On February 11 , the system turned to the southeast , due to a ridge to the north . That day , JTWC started issuing advisories on Tropical Cyclone 18S . Initially , the storm failed to intensify much due to a nearby upper @-@ level ridge . On February 12 , MFR upgraded the system to a tropical storm , and the next day the system was named Isha . Outflow became more pronounced due to minimal wind shear . The JTWC briefly estimated peak 1 minute winds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) , but the MFR never estimated winds above 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) . Isha weakened late on February 13 due to cooler waters , dry air , and stronger shear . On February 14 , the JTWC discontinued advisories once there was little convection left , and the MFR estimated Isha dissipated the next day . 
 = = = Intense Tropical Cyclone Japhet = = = 
 Cyclone Japhet developed on February 25 near the southwest coast of Madagascar , and initially moved to the northwest before turning to the southwest . With favorable conditions for development , Japhet quickly intensified in the Mozambique Channel , reaching maximum winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) , sustained over 10 minutes . This made it an intense tropical cyclone , only the sixth to occur in the channel in 24 years . After stalling briefly , the cyclone turned to the northwest , weakening slightly before striking Mozambique just south of Vilankulo on March 2 . Japhet slowly weakened while progressing inland , dissipating over Zambia on March 6 . 
 Along its path , Japhet dropped heavy rainfall that caused widespread river flooding . The rains occurred after an extended drought , although excessive precipitation caused heavy crop damage , notably around where the storm moved ashore . In two provinces in Mozambique , the cyclone damaged or destroyed 25 @,@ 000 houses , leaving at least 23 @,@ 000 people homeless . Flooding in Zambia caused rivers to rise in Mozambique several days after the storm 's passage . There were 17 deaths in Mozambique . Further inland , remnant rainfall destroyed a bridge and several houses in Zimbabwe , killing eight people . 
 = = = Intense Tropical Cyclone Kalunde = = = 
 Kalunde formed on March 3 from an area of convection southeast of Diego Garcia . The system slowly intensified while drifting to the west , becoming a moderate tropical storm on March 5 . Its intensification rate increased as it began a steady southwest movement . Kalunde underwent rapid deepening and developed an eye , reaching peak intensity on March 8 . Around that time , MFR estimated a minimum pressure of 910 mbar ( 27 inHg ) with winds of 215 km / h ( 135 mph ) , and the JTWC estimated peak winds of 260 km / h ( 160 mph ) ; this made Kalunde the strongest cyclone of the year in the basin . It weakened after undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle , and on March 12 Kalunde passed near Rodrigues island as a weakening cyclone . Around that time , the storm turned to the south , weakening to a tropical storm on March 14 before becoming extratropical the next day . The remnants of Kalunde dissipated on March 16 . 
 When the cyclone passed Rodrigues , it produced wind gusts estimated up to 210 km / h ( 130 mph ) , which caused an island @-@ wide power outage . Many roads were washed out , and about 80 percent of the drinking water was contaminated . During the storm 's three @-@ day passage of the island , a total of 329 @.@ 1 mm ( 12 @.@ 96 in ) of rain fell . A total of 1 @,@ 600 homes were damaged , and total losses across the island amounted to $ 3 @.@ 15 million ( 2003 USD , € 3 @.@ 4 million ) . 
 = = = Subtropical Depression Luma = = = 
 A large low @-@ level circulation persisted off the southwest coast of Madagascar on April 6 . On April 8 , it became a subtropical depression according to MFR , and moved to the southwest before turning sharply to the southeast . That day , the JTWC briefly assessed a fair potential for development . The circulation became exposed on April 9 , but when it began quickly intensifying the next day , MFR initiated advisories on Subtropical Depression Luma . By that time , the JTWC classified the system as extratropical ; however , the system developed convection near the center and became more of a tropical cyclone . On April 11 , Luma developed an eye in the center of the thunderstorms , prompting MFR to upgrade the storm to peak winds of 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) . At that time , the storm was in an area of weak wind shear , although increasing shear caused rapid weakening and for the eye to dissipate . Early on April 12 , Luma became extratropical as it merged with an approaching cold front . 
 = = = Tropical Cyclone Manou = = = 
 Late in the season in April , an area of convection formed southwest of Diego Garcia . It gradually organized , and there was a companion system to the west that also showed signs of development . The eastern system was declared Tropical Disturbance 16 on May 2 , and with a ridge to the southeast it moved generally to the southwest . Early in its duration , the system affected St Brandon and Mauritius with gusty winds . On May 4 it intensified into Tropical Storm Manou on May 4 . After an initial strengthening phase , the storm weakened but later re @-@ intensified as it approached Madagascar . Manou developed a well @-@ defined eye and reached peak winds only 19 km ( 12 mi ) from the eastern Madagascar coastline . It reached tropical cyclone status , at the time only one of six in the month since 1968 . For about 12 hours , the cyclone stalled before turning to the south and weakening . After becoming extratropical on May 10 , Manou dissipated three days later . 
 Manou struck Madagascar a year after Cyclone Kesiny hit the country in May 2002 , representing the first known occurrence of May tropical cyclone impacts in consecutive years . When Manou struck Madagascar , it produced gusts as strong as 211 km / h ( 131 mph ) and heavy rainfall reaching 227 mm ( 8 @.@ 9 in ) in a 15 ‑ hour period , both at Vatomandry . Damage in the country was heaviest there , where 85 % of buildings were destroyed and 23 people were killed . Manou destroyed about 24 @,@ 500 houses nationwide , leaving 114 @,@ 480 people homeless . The storm destroyed large areas of crops and disrupted transportation , including damaging the road between Vatomandry and Brickaville . Manou injured 85 and killed 89 people throughout Madagascar .

 = The Christmas Sessions = 
 The Christmas Sessions is the first Christmas album by American Christian rock band MercyMe . The album , produced by Brown Bannister , was released on September 27 , 2005 . The band , who greatly enjoy Christmas , had previously recorded Christmas songs and enjoyed the process so much that they wanted to produce a full @-@ length album . After releasing a studio album in early 2004 , they decided to take time off ; they realized they could record a Christmas album over that period and began work in December 2004 . The band , aiming to produce a rock @-@ oriented album , recruited Bannister , a noted rock producer , to produce it . In addition to one original song , " Joseph 's Lullaby " , the album consists of covers of both modern and traditional Christmas songs that the band members had listened to when growing up . 
 Upon its release , The Christmas Sessions received positive reviews from critics . Praise was offered for the album 's production qualities , as well as the change in direction for MercyMe and the band 's take on the traditional songs . Minor criticism was directed at lead vocalist Bart Millard 's vocals , as well as at individual songs . The album reached a peak of number three on the Billboard Christian Albums chart , number ten on the Holiday Albums chart , and number sixty @-@ four on the Billboard 200 . Multiple songs from the album appeared on record charts , including " Joseph 's Lullaby " , which peaked at number one on the Christian Songs chart ; " God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen " and " Little Drummer Boy " also appeared in the top ten on the chart , peaking at numbers nine and ten , respectively , and " Silent Night " reached a peak of number six on the Adult Contemporary chart . 
 = = Background and recording = = 
 According to Bart Millard , the lead vocalist for MercyMe , the band enjoys the Christmas season greatly and had recorded songs for compilation albums like WOW Christmas : Green and had liked the process of taking older Christmas songs and altering them ; Millard said that the band " had so much fun doing it that we found ourselves wishing we had a Christmas record of our own " . After the band released their third studio album Undone in early 2004 , they decided to take some time off , and realized they could record a Christmas album over that period . Although MercyMe had started as a rock band , they become associated with the adult contemporary genre after their single " I Can Only Imagine " became successful . In creating The Christmas Sessions , the band incorporated more elements from rock music and other genres ; Millard described it as " the most ' rock ' album we 've done " and noted they did not concern themselves with the album 's direction , saying " we didn ’ t have to worry about which direction we went . We just made the record we wanted to make " . 
 MercyMe began recording the album over Christmas 2004 , and put the " finishing touches " on it over the following summer . The band brought in rock producer Brown Bannister , who had previously recorded albums for artists like Amy Grant and Steven Curtis Chapman , to produce both The Christmas Sessions and their next studio album , which would also utilize a rock sound . In selecting songs for The Christmas Sessions the band wanted to cover Christmas songs they had grown up with , but they did write and record one original song , " Joseph 's Lullaby " . Millard had initially written it as " Mary 's Lullaby " but changed the lyrics and key upon suggestion from Bannister 's wife , who noted that , being male , it was odd for him to be singing from the perspective of Mary as opposed to Joseph .
