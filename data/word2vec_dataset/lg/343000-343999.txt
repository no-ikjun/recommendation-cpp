 Rick Porter of <unk> praised the writing of the episode , as well as the acting of Mindy Kaling and Jenna Fischer . Porter also praised the final scene of the episode , when Jan and Michael drive home after the day . Porter stated " I don 't know whether to laugh or turn away in shame from that final scene , though , as they bicker about what to eat while they 're driving home . It was like watching two friends fight -- fascinating and incredibly uncomfortable at the same time . " Christine Fenno , of Entertainment Weekly , stated " ' The Deposition ' was a simmering slow cooker of corporate intrigue , flavored by Michael Scott 's ridiculousness , with spicy smack talk on the side . " Fenno , like Porter , also praised the acting of Jenna Fischer , saying that she " stole the low @-@ key opening scenes " . Travis Fickett , of IGN , stated that " this happens to be the best episode of the season and one of the best episodes of the series . It 's almost as if the writers planned it this way - to emphasize their importance and remind us how much we 'll miss them when they 're gone . " Fickett went on to praise the acting between Steve Carell ( Michael ) and Paul Lieberstein ( Toby ) . BuddyTV Senior Writer Oscar Dahl stated that the episode was an oddity among the series , saying " The Deposition " was an atypical episode of The Office , one that basically put the character of Michael Scott on trial and humiliated him over and over again .

 " Dwight Christmas " was written by executive story editor Robert Padnick , marking his fourth writing credit for the series after joining the writing staff in the seventh season . It was directed by Charles McDougall , his first directing credit for the season . McDougal 's first job for the series was directing its first Christmas episode during the show 's second season . The basic plot of the episode , involving Belsnickel , had originally been conceived during the writing for fourth season and was going to air as that year 's Christmas installment . However , the 2007 – 08 Writers Guild of America strike halted production , and the unfinished script was never used . According to executive producer and showrunner Greg Daniels , the writing staff wanted to use the premise for many years , but could never find a right time to implement it , until an opportunity during the show 's last season presented itself . Before the episode aired , Kemper , in an interview with TV Guide said that " I feel like I might be expected to say this because it is the last one , but I truly love this episode so much " and that she " specifically love [ s ] Dwight 's storyline " because " he brings in his family Christmas traditions . I 've always held Dwight as one of my favorite characters and now ' Dwight Christmas ' just takes it to a new level . " Fischer said that filming the last Christmas episode was " emotional " and regretted not being able to have Mindy Kaling , who portrayed Kelly Kapoor on the series , film a karaoke scene . This is the second episode of season nine to not feature Andy or Clark . Ed Helms , who portrayed Andy , left the show temporarily in the season 's sixth episode " The Boat " in order to film The Hangover Part III , whereas Clark Duke , who portrayed Clark , left for a few episodes to film Kick @-@ Ass 2 .

 Dwight , who dresses up as Belsnickel , has one of the warehouse workers , Nate , dress up as Belsnickel 's assistant , Zwarte Piet , before the office vetoes the idea , feeling that it is racist . Dwight presents the camera with a picture of he and his brother celebrating Christmas , and a version of the same photo decorated in the style of the 1999 science fiction film The Matrix . When Jim is trying to convince the office to do Dwight 's idea , he mispronounces one of the German character 's names , calling him " Hufflepuff " , one of the four houses of the magical school Hogwarts from the book series Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling . Creed Bratton ( a fictionalized version of the actual Creed Bratton ) mentions that , for this years party , he wants a " Tapas Swiss Miss " -themed party , which is a combination of Spanish tapas and Swiss Miss hot cocoa . Andy , via email , tells Erin that he saw the 2012 movie Life of Pi , an adaptation of the book of the same name . He also notes that he wants to see the first part of Peter Jackson 's 2012 film The Hobbit : An Unexpected Journey .

 The episode received largely positive reviews from television critics . Andrea Reiher of Zap2it named " Dwight Christmas " the best comedy TV episode of 2012 . She wrote that the episode " was not only funny but had a huge nostalgia factor " , and continued the show 's trend of strong holiday episodes . Reiher also praised the episode 's two subplots , writing that " drunk Darryl and Die Hard " helped produce " a classic episode of The Office that brought back the warm and fuzzy feelings of the early seasons of the show . " 
 Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste awarded the episode an 8 out of 10 . Although she noted that Erin and Pete 's subplot " could 've easily been ripped from the season two Jim @-@ Pam @-@ Roy storyline " , she concluded that " The Office successfully found a way to make its final Christmas count . " Damon Houx of Screen Crush called the episode " a really good Christmas episode " that " got [ the ] central three characters absolutely right " . Although he wrote that the show was missing several cast members , like Helms and Duke , it was " as good as the post @-@ Carell Office has been " . Cindy White of IGN awarded the episode a 9 out of 10 , denoting an " amazing episode " . She wrote that it " harkens back to forgotten holiday traditions of old , like good Christmas episodes of The Office " . She also concluded that " the nostalgia swirling around Dwight Christmas was particularly noticeable " which she deduced was probably " a conscious effort here on the part of the writers to recapture that old Office magic and make this one to remember , and I think that effort paid off . " 
 Brett Davinger of the California Literary Review wrote that , while the episode 's plot was " not particularly notable " on the surface , it manages to work " because of Rainn Wilson ’ s commitment to it " .

Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five and called it " a worthy extension of [ The Office Christmas ] tradition " and " definitely one of the best episodes of this final season " . He praised Dwight 's antics as well as Kevin 's humorous lines . Michael Tedder Vulture awarded the episode four stars out of five and wrote that " part of the charm of this episode was that the writers didn 't try to stuff it with too much plot " . One of the very few mixed reviews was written by Caroline Framke of The A.V.

She concluded that the episode " ranks as more impish than admirable . " 
 = The Year of the Sex Olympics = 
 The Year of the Sex Olympics is a 1968 television play made by the BBC and first broadcast on BBC2 as part of Theatre 625 . It stars Leonard Rossiter , Tony Vogel , Suzanne Neve and Brian Cox . It was directed by Michael Elliott . The writer was Nigel Kneale , best known as the creator of Quatermass . 
 Influenced by concerns about overpopulation , the counterculture of the 1960s and the societal effects of television , the play depicts a world of the future where a small elite control the media , keeping the lower classes docile by serving them an endless diet of lowest common denominator programmes and pornography . The play concentrates on an idea the programme controllers have for a new programme which will follow the trials and tribulations of a group of people left to fend for themselves on a remote island . In this respect , the play is often cited as having anticipated the craze for reality television . 
 Kneale had fourteen years earlier adapted George Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty @-@ Four as a classic and controversial BBC broadcast and the play reflects much of Kneale 's assimilation of Orwell 's concern about the power of the media and Kneale 's experience of the evolving media industry . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 In the future , society is divided between ' low @-@ drives ' that equate with the labouring classes and ' hi @-@ drives ' who control the government and media . The low @-@ drives are controlled by a constant broadcast of pornography that the hi @-@ drives are convinced will pacify them , though one hi @-@ drive , Nat Mender ( Tony Vogel ) , believes that the media should be used to educate the low @-@ drives . After the accidental death of a protester during the Sex Olympics gets a massive audience response , the Co @-@ ordinator Ugo Priest ( Leonard Rossiter ) decides to commission a new programme . In The Live Life Show , Nat Mender , his partner Deanie ( Suzanne Neve ) and their daughter <unk> ( Lesley Roach ) are stranded on a remote Scottish island while the low @-@ drive audience watches . Mender 's former colleague , <unk> Opie ( Brian Cox ) , realising that “ something got to happen ” , decides to spice up the show by introducing a psychopath , <unk> ( George Murcell ) to the island . When <unk> goes on a murderous rampage , Ugo Priest is horrified when the audience reacts with laughter to the slaughter and The Live Life Show is deemed a triumph . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 Nigel Kneale was a Manx television playwright who had come to prominence in the 1950s thanks to his adaptation of Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty @-@ Four and his three Quatermass serials , all of which had been made by the BBC . Kneale had since become disenchanted with the BBC , mainly because he had received no extra money when the BBC sold the film rights to The Quatermass Experiment , and had turned to freelance writing , producing scripts for Associated Television and for Hammer Films . When approached by the BBC for a script for the BBC2 anthology series Theatre 625 , Kneale , still upset over the sale of the film rights to The Quatermass Experiment turned them down . The Director General of the BBC , Sir Hugh Greene intervened and arranged a £ 3 @,@ 000 ex gratia payment to Kneale in recognition of Quatermass ' success . Kneale accepted a commission from Theatre 625 producer Michael Bakewell on Friday , 7 April 1967 for what would become The Year of the Sex Olympics . 
 Kneale 's concept concerned " the world of the future , and a way of keeping the population happy without being active " . According to Kneale , the notion for the play came from the " worldwide dread of populations exploding out of all control " leading him to devise a world where pornography hooks the population " on a substitute for sex rather than the real thing and so keeping the population down " . Kneale was also influenced by the dropout counterculture of the late 1960s , recalling " I didn 't like the Sixties at all because of the whole thing of ' let it all hang out ' and let 's stop thinking [ ... ] which was the all too frequent theme of the Sixties which I hated " . Dissatisfaction with the youth culture of the time was a preoccupation of Kneale 's : in the mid @-@ sixties he had worked on an unmade script , The Big , Big , Giggle , about a teenage suicide cult and following The Year of the Sex Olympics , returned to the theme of youth out of control in his 1969 play Bam ! Pow ! Zapp ! and in the fourth and final Quatermass serial in 1979 . Many cultural icons of the youth movement including members of The Beatles , Pink Floyd and Monty Python , were fans of Kneale 's work . For The Year of the Sex Olympics Kneale extrapolated the possible consequences of the youth movement 's desire for freedom from " traditional " cultural inhibitions , asking as the academic John R. Cook puts it , " In a world of no limits , will the result quickly be apathy if there is nothing any more to get excited about , nothing precious or illicit to fight for in the teeth of the censor ? " . 
 Kneale also sought to make " a comment on television and the idea of the passive audience " , depicting a world where the media is controlled by an elite who feed the population with a diet of low quality programmes and echoing the Orwellian concept of language reduction , where vocabulary has been eroded through exposure to advertising slogans , <unk> and predominantly visual media . He later recalled , " I thought people in those conditions would have very , very , reduced language — they wouldn 't be really a verbal society any more , and I think we 're heading towards that . Television is mainly responsible for it , the fact that people are now conditioned to image . The pictures they see on television screens more and more dominate their thinking , as far as people do a lot of thinking , and if you had a verbally reduced society , you would get the kind of language — possibly — that you did get in the play " . 
 = = = Production = = = 
 Kneale 's script was accepted on 25 October 1967 by Ronald Travers , who had taken over as producer from Michael Bakewell on Theatre 625 . Production began in early 1968 with Michael Elliot as director . Elliot initially asked Leo McKern to take on the key role of Co @-@ ordinator Ugo Priest but with McKern unavailable he turned to Leonard Rossiter . Writing to Rossiter , offering him the part , Elliot described The Year of the Sex Olympics as " the most important play Nigel Kneale has written since Quatermass " . Cast as <unk> Opie was Brian Cox who would go on to have a distinguished career in film and television . 
 The Year of the Sex Olympics proved to be a difficult production when the ' Clean @-@ Up TV ' campaigner Mary Whitehouse of the National Viewers and Listeners Association obtained a copy of the script and attempted to block the production . Her objections were overruled by Hugh Greene . Location filming — for the outdoor scenes set on the island that appears in The Live Life Show — took place on the Isle of Man between 8 and 10 May 1968 . A mishap occurred during the shoot when Tony Vogel slipped and broke his wrist . Filming continued at Ealing Film Studios between 13 and 15 May covering the elements that would be played into the screens on the set during studio recording such as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> programmes as well as the audience reaction shots . The scene where Kin Hodder falls to his death was also shot at Ealing . Following rehearsals , the production moved to BBC Television Centre between 12 and 14 June . Industrial action by BBC electricians interrupted the production and by the end of the recording session , the final ten minutes of the play remained <unk> , leading to a remount on 23 June to complete the outstanding scenes . 
 BBC2 was the only UK television station broadcasting in colour at the time . The Year of the Sex Olympics presented a production with gaudy sets , costumes and makeup . In a contemporary review of the play for The Sun newspaper , Nancy Banks @-@ Smith commented that , " If you didn 't see it in colour , you didn 't really see it " . 
 The Year of the Sex Olympics was broadcast at 9 : <unk> on BBC2 on Monday , 29 July 1968 . Appearing on arts programme Late Night Line Up later that night to discuss the play , Kneale said , " You can 't write about the future . One can play with the processes that might occur in the future , but one is really always writing about the present because that is what we know . It 's largely an image of television as I know it " . Sean Day @-@ Lewis , writing in The Daily Telegraph hailed the programme as a " highly original play written with great force and making as many valid points about the dangers of the future as any science fiction I can remember — including 1984 ! " . The Year of the Sex Olympics was watched by 1 @.@ 5 million viewers . Audience Research Report indicated that many viewers found the play impenetrable . It was repeated on BBC1 in 1970 with 15 minutes cut from the running time , as part of The Wednesday Play strand . 
 As often happened in this era , the colour master tapes of The Year of the Sex Olympics were wiped some time after broadcast and the play was believed lost until the 1980s when a black and white telerecording was discovered . This copy was released on DVD , with an introduction by film and television historian Kim Newman , a commentary by actor Brian Cox and a copy of the original script , by the British Film Institute in 2003 . 
 = = Cultural significance = = 
 One of the first to draw comparisons with The Year of the Sex Olympics and the rise of reality television programmes ( soap operas without professional actors ) , such as Big Brother , Castaway 2000 and Survivor , was the journalist Nancy Banks @-@ Smith in a review of the first series of the UK version of Big Brother for The Guardian in 2000 , a theme she later expounded upon in 2003 , writing that the play " foretold the reality show and , in the scramble for greater sensation , its logical outcome " . Banks @-@ Smith had long been an admirer of The Year of the Sex Olympics , having written in The Sun following its original broadcast in 1968 : " Quite apart from the excellent script and the ' big big ' treatment , the play radiated ripples . Is television a substitute for living ? Does the spectacle of pain at a distance atrophy sympathy ? Can this coffin with knobs on furnish all we need to ask ? " . Another admirer , the writer and actor Mark Gatiss , has said that upon seeing Big Brother he yelled at the television , " Don 't they know what they 're doing ? [ ... ] It 's The Year of the Sex Olympics ! Nigel Kneale was right ! " . When The Year of the Sex Olympics was repeated on BBC Four on 22 May 2003 , Paul Hoggart in The Times noted that " in many respects Kneale was right on the money [ ... ] when you consider that nothing gets contemporary reality show audiences more excited than an emotional train @-@ wreck on live TV " . 
 Although the reality television of The Live Life Show is the aspect most commentators pick up on , The Year of the Sex Olympics is also a wider satire on sensationalist television and the media in general . Mark Gatiss has noted that the <unk> and <unk> programmes that also appear in the play " ingeniously depicted the future of lowest common denominator TV " . This view is echoed by the writer and critic Kim Newman who has said that " as an extreme exercise in revolutionary self @-@ criticism on the part of television professionals , who also lampoon their own world of chattering commentators and ratings @-@ chasing sensationalism , the play [ ... ] is a trenchant contribution to a series of debates that is still raging " and has concluded that " Nigel Kneale might be quite justified in shouting , " I was right ! I was right ! " " . 
 = Sviatoslav I of Kiev = 
 Sviatoslav I Igorevich ( Old East Slavic : <unk> ~ <unk> / <unk> <unk> , <unk> / <unk> <unk> ; Old Norse : <unk> <unk> ; Russian : <unk> <unk> , Sviatoslav Igorevich ; Ukrainian : <unk> <unk> , Sviatoslav <unk> ; Belarusian : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ; Bulgarian : <unk> , Svetoslav , Greek : <unk> , <unk> ) ( c . 942 – March 972 ) , also spelled Svyatoslav , Grand prince of Kiev . The son of Igor of Kiev and Olga , Sviatoslav is famous for his persistent campaigns in the east and south , which precipitated the collapse of two great powers of Eastern Europe , Khazaria and the First Bulgarian Empire . He also conquered numerous East Slavic tribes , defeated the Alans and attacked the Volga Bulgars , and at times was allied with the Pechenegs and Magyars . 
 His decade @-@ long reign over the Kievan Rus ' was marked by rapid expansion into the Volga River valley , the Pontic steppe , and the Balkans . By the end of his short life , Sviatoslav carved out for himself the largest state in Europe , eventually moving his capital in 969 from Kiev ( modern @-@ day Ukraine ) to Pereyaslavets ( identified as the modern village of <unk> , Romania ) on the Danube . In contrast with his mother 's conversion to Christianity , Sviatoslav remained a staunch pagan all of his life . Due to his abrupt death in ambush , his conquests , for the most part , were not consolidated into a functioning empire , while his failure to establish a stable succession led to a fratricidal feud among his three sons , resulting in two of them being killed . 
 = = Name = = 
 Sviatoslav is the first ruler of the Kievan Rus ' recorded in the Primary Chronicle with a name of Slavic origin ( as opposed to his predecessors , whose names derived from Old Norse ) . This name , however , is not recorded in other medieval Slavic countries . Nevertheless , <unk> is the Old East Norse cognate with the Slavic form as attested in the patronymic Old East Norse name of Vladimir : <unk> <unk> . This patronymic naming convention , continues namely in Icelandic and in East Slavic languages . Even in Rus ' , it was attested only among the members of the house of Rurik , as were the names of Sviatoslav 's immediate successors : Vladimir , Yaroslav , and Mstislav . This is questionable , however , as these names follow conventions well established in other Slavic lands , and it ignores Vladimir of Bulgaria , who ruled between 889 @-@ 893 . Some scholars speculate that the name of Sviatoslav , composed of the Slavic roots for " holy " and " glory " , was an artificial derivation combining those of his predecessors Oleg and Rurik ( they mean " holy " and " glorious " in Old Norse , respectively ) . On the other hand , such a compound structure name was already known from Great Moravia , as in the rulers named Svatopluk . Clearly Sviatoslav 's name belongs to this tradition , as he had a son by the name of Yaropolk , of much the same form , and a grandson by the same name , Sviatopolk . 
 = = Early life and personality = = 
 Virtually nothing is known about Sviatoslav 's childhood and youth , which he spent reigning in Novgorod . Sviatoslav 's father , Igor , was killed by the <unk> around 945 , and his mother , Olga , ruled as regent in Kiev until Sviatoslav reached maturity ( ca . 963 ) . Sviatoslav was tutored by a Varangian named <unk> . The tradition of employing Varangian tutors for the sons of ruling princes survived well into the 11th century . Sviatoslav appears to have had little patience for administration . His life was spent with his druzhina ( roughly , " company " ) in permanent warfare against neighboring states . According to the Primary Chronicle , he carried on his expeditions neither wagons nor kettles , and he boiled no meat , rather cutting off small strips of <unk> , game , or beef to eat after roasting it on the coals . Nor did he have a tent , rather spreading out a horse @-@ blanket under him and setting his saddle under his head , and all his retinue did likewise . 
 Sviatoslav 's appearance has been described very clearly by Leo the Deacon , who himself attended the meeting of Sviatoslav with John I Tzimiskes . Following Deacon 's memories , Sviatoslav was a blue @-@ eyed male of average height but of stalwart build , much more sturdy than Tzimiskes . He shaved his blond head and his beard but wore a bushy mustache and a <unk> as a sign of his nobility . He preferred to dress in white , and it was noted that his garments were much cleaner than those of his men , although he had a lot in common with his warriors . He wore a single large gold earring bearing a carbuncle and two pearls . 
 = = Religious beliefs = = 
 Sviatoslav 's mother , Olga , converted to Eastern Orthodox Christianity at the court of Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus in 957 . However , Sviatoslav remained a pagan all of his life . In the treaty of 971 between Sviatoslav and the Byzantine emperor John I Tzimiskes , the Rus ' are swearing by Perun and Veles . According to the Primary Chronicle , he believed that his warriors ( druzhina ) would lose respect for him and mock him if he became a Christian . The allegiance of his warriors was of paramount importance in his conquest of an empire that stretched from the Volga to the Danube . 
 = = Family = = 
 Very little is known of Sviatoslav 's family life . It is possible that he was not the only ( or the eldest ) son of his parents . The Russo @-@ Byzantine treaty of 945 mentions a certain Predslava , Volodislav 's wife , as the noblest of the Rus ' women after Olga . The fact that Predslava was Oleg 's mother is presented by Vasily Tatishchev . He also speculated that Predslava was of a Hungarian nobility . George Vernadsky was among many historians to speculate that Volodislav was Igor 's eldest son and heir who died at some point during Olga 's regency . Another chronicle told that Oleg ( ? - 944 ? ) was the eldest son of Igor . At the time of Igor 's death , Sviatoslav was still a child , and he was raised by his mother or under her instructions . Her influence , however , did not extend to his religious observance . 
 Sviatoslav had several children , but the origin of his wives is not specified in the chronicle . By his wives , he had Yaropolk and Oleg . By <unk> , a woman of indeterminate origins , Sviatoslav had Vladimir , who would ultimately break with his father 's paganism and convert Rus ' to Christianity . John Skylitzes reported that Vladimir had a brother named <unk> ; whether this <unk> was a son of Sviatoslav , a son of <unk> by a prior or subsequent husband , or an unrelated Rus ' nobleman is unclear . 
 = = Eastern campaigns = = 
 Shortly after his accession to the throne , Sviatoslav began campaigning to expand Rus ' control over the Volga valley and the Pontic steppe region . His greatest success was the conquest of Khazaria , which for centuries had been one of the strongest states of Eastern Europe . The sources are not clear about the roots of the conflict between Khazaria and Rus ' , so several possibilities have been suggested . The Rus ' had an interest in removing the Khazar hold on the Volga trade route because the Khazars collected duties from the goods transported by the Volga . Historians have suggested that the Byzantine Empire may have incited the Rus ' against the Khazars , who fell out with the Byzantines after the persecutions of the Jews in the reign of Romanus I Lecapenus . 
 Sviatoslav began by rallying the East Slavic vassal tribes of the Khazars to his cause . Those who would not join him , such as the <unk> , were attacked and forced to pay tribute to the Kievan Rus ' rather than to the Khazars . According to a legend recorded in the Primary Chronicle , Sviatoslav sent a message to the <unk> rulers , consisting of a single phrase : " I want to come at you ! " ( Old East Slavic : " <unk> на <unk> <unk> " ) This phrase is used in modern Russian ( usually misquoted as " <unk> на <unk> " ) and in modern Ukrainian ( " <unk> на <unk> " ) to denote an unequivocal declaration of one 's intentions . Proceeding by the Oka and Volga rivers , he attacked Volga Bulgaria . He employed Oghuz and Pecheneg mercenaries in this campaign , perhaps to counter the superior cavalry of the Khazars and Bulgars . 
 Sviatoslav destroyed the Khazar city of Sarkel around 965 , possibly sacking ( but not occupying ) the Khazar city of Kerch on the Crimea as well . At Sarkel he established a Rus ' settlement called Belaya <unk> ( " the white tower " or " the white fortress " , the East Slavic translation for " Sarkel " ) . He subsequently destroyed the Khazar capital of Atil . A visitor to Atil wrote soon after Sviatoslav 's campaign : " The Rus ' attacked , and no grape or raisin remained , not a leaf on a branch . " The exact chronology of his Khazar campaign is uncertain and disputed ; for example , Mikhail Artamonov and David Christian proposed that the sack of Sarkel came after the destruction of Atil . 
 Although Ibn <unk> reports the sack of Samandar by Sviatoslav , the Rus ' leader did not bother to occupy the Khazar heartlands north of the Caucasus Mountains permanently . On his way back to Kiev , Sviatoslav chose to strike against the Ossetians and force them into subservience . Therefore , Khazar successor statelets continued their precarious existence in the region . The destruction of Khazar imperial power paved the way for Kievan Rus ' to dominate north @-@ south trade routes through the steppe and across the Black Sea , routes that formerly had been a major source of revenue for the Khazars . Moreover , Sviatoslav 's campaigns led to increased Slavic settlement in the region of the Saltovo @-@ Mayaki culture , greatly changing the demographics and culture of the transitional area between the forest and the steppe . 
 = = Campaigns in the Balkans = = 
 The annihilation of Khazaria was undertaken against the background of the Rus ' <unk> alliance , concluded in the wake of Igor 's Byzantine campaign in 944 . Close military ties between the Rus ' and Byzantium are illustrated by the fact , reported by John Skylitzes , that a Rus ' detachment accompanied Byzantine Emperor Nikephoros Phokas in his victorious naval expedition to Crete . 
 In 967 or 968 , Nikephoros sent to Sviatoslav his agent , Kalokyros , with the task of talking Sviatoslav into assisting him in a war against Bulgaria . Sviatoslav was paid 15 @,@ 000 pounds of gold and set sail with an army of 60 @,@ 000 men , including thousands of Pecheneg mercenaries . 
 Sviatoslav defeated the Bulgarian ruler Boris II and proceeded to occupy the whole of northern Bulgaria . Meanwhile , the Byzantines bribed the Pechenegs to attack and besiege Kiev , where Olga stayed with Sviatoslav 's son Vladimir . The siege was relieved by the druzhina of <unk> , and immediately following the Pecheneg retreat , Olga sent a reproachful letter to Sviatoslav . He promptly returned and defeated the Pechenegs , who continued to threaten Kiev . 
 Sviatoslav refused to turn his Balkan conquests over to the Byzantines , and the parties fell out as a result . To the chagrin of his boyars and his mother ( who died within three days after learning about his decision ) , Sviatoslav decided to move his capital to Pereyaslavets in the mouth of the Danube due to the great potential of that location as a commercial hub . In the Primary Chronicle record for 969 , Sviatoslav explains that it is to Pereyaslavets , the centre of his lands , " all the riches flow : gold , silks , wine , and various fruits from Greece , silver and horses from Hungary and Bohemia , and from Rus ' furs , wax , honey , and slaves " . 
 In summer 969 , Sviatoslav left Rus ' again , dividing his dominion into three parts , each under a nominal rule of one of his sons . At the head of an army that included Pecheneg and Magyar auxiliary troops , he invaded Bulgaria again , devastating Thrace , capturing the city of Philippopolis , and massacring its inhabitants . Nikephoros responded by repairing the defenses of Constantinople and raising new squadrons of armored cavalry . In the midst of his preparations , Nikephoros was overthrown and killed by John Tzimiskes , who thus became the new Byzantine emperor . 
 John Tzimiskes first attempted to persuade Sviatoslav into leaving Bulgaria , but he was unsuccessful . Challenging the Byzantine authority , Sviatoslav crossed the Danube and laid siege to Adrianople , causing panic on the streets of Constantinople in summer 970 . Later that year , the Byzantines launched a counteroffensive . Being occupied with suppressing a revolt of Bardas Phokas in Asia Minor , John Tzimiskes sent his commander @-@ in @-@ chief , Bardas Skleros , who defeated the coalition of Rus ' , Pechenegs , Magyars , and Bulgarians in the Battle of Arcadiopolis . Meanwhile , John , having quelled the revolt of Bardas Phokas , came to the Balkans with a large army and promoting himself as the liberator of Bulgaria from Sviatoslav , penetrated the impracticable mountain passes and shortly thereafter captured Marcianopolis , where the Rus ' were holding a number of Bulgar princes hostage . 
 Sviatoslav retreated to Dorostolon , which the Byzantine armies besieged for sixty @-@ five days . Cut off and surrounded , Sviatoslav came to terms with John and agreed to abandon the Balkans , renounce his claims to the southern Crimea , and return west of the Dnieper River . In return , the Byzantine emperor supplied the Rus ' with food and safe passage home . Sviatoslav and his men set sail and landed on Berezan Island at the mouth of the Dnieper , where they made camp for the winter . Several months later , their camp was devastated by famine , so that even a horse 's head could not be bought for less than a half @-@ <unk> , reports the Kievan chronicler of the Primary Chronicle . While Sviatoslav 's campaign brought no tangible results for the Rus ' , it weakened the Bulgarian statehood and left it vulnerable to the attacks of Basil the Bulgar @-@ Slayer four decades later . 
 = = Death and aftermath = = 
 Fearing that the peace with Sviatoslav would not endure , the Byzantine emperor induced the Pecheneg khan <unk> to kill Sviatoslav before he reached Kiev . This was in line with the policy outlined by Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus in De Administrando Imperio of fomenting strife between the Rus ' and the Pechenegs . According to the Slavic chronicle , <unk> attempted to warn Sviatoslav to avoid the Dnieper rapids , but the prince slighted his wise advice and was ambushed and slain by the Pechenegs when he tried to cross the cataracts near <unk> early in 972 . The Primary Chronicle reports that his skull was made into a chalice by the Pecheneg khan . 
 Following Sviatoslav 's death , tensions between his sons grew . A war broke out between his legitimate sons , Oleg and Yaropolk , in 976 , at the conclusion of which Oleg was killed . In 977 Vladimir fled Novgorod to escape Oleg 's fate and went to Scandinavia , where he raised an army of Varangians and returned in 980 . Yaropolk was killed , and Vladimir became the sole ruler of Kievan Rus ' . 
 = = Art and literature = = 
 Sviatoslav has long been a hero of Belarusian , Russian , and Ukrainian patriots due to his great military successes . His figure first attracted attention of Russian artists and poets during the Russo @-@ Turkish War ( 1768 – 1774 ) , which provided obvious parallels with Sviatoslav 's push towards Constantinople . Russia 's southward expansion and the imperialistic ventures of Catherine II in the Balkans seemed to have been legitimized by Sviatoslav 's campaigns eight centuries earlier . 
 Among the works created during the war was Yakov <unk> 's tragedy Olga ( 1772 ) . The Russian playwright chose to introduce Sviatoslav as his protagonist , although his active participation in the events following Igor 's death is out of sync with the traditional chronology . <unk> 's rival Nikolai <unk> ( 1758 – 1815 ) also wrote a play on the subject of Sviatoslav 's life . Ivan <unk> 's painting Sviatoslav 's Return from the Danube to Kiev ( 1773 ) explores the conflict between military honour and family attachment . It is a vivid example of <unk> rendering of early medieval subject matter . 
 Interest in Sviatoslav 's career increased in the 19th century . <unk> Lebedev depicted an episode of Sviatoslav 's meeting with Emperor John in his well @-@ known painting , while Eugene <unk> sculpted an equestrian statue of Sviatoslav in the early 20th century . Sviatoslav appears in the 1913 poem of Velimir <unk> Written before the war ( # 70 . <unk> <unk> <unk> ) as an epitome of militant <unk> : 
 Sviatoslav is the villain of the novel The Lost Kingdom , or the Passing of the Khazars , by Samuel Gordon , a fictionalized account of the destruction of Khazaria by the Rus ' . The Slavic warrior figures in a more positive context in the story " <unk> <unk> <unk> " by Vadim Viktorovich <unk> ; the story is included in his book <unk> <unk> . 
 In 2005 , reports circulated that a village in the Belgorod region had erected a monument to Sviatoslav 's victory over the Khazars by the Russian sculptor Vyacheslav <unk> . The reports described the 13 @-@ meter tall statue as depicting a Rus ' cavalryman trampling a supine Khazar bearing a Star of David and <unk> . This created an outcry within the Jewish community of Russia . The controversy was further exacerbated by <unk> 's connections with <unk> and other anti @-@ Semitic organizations , as well as by his involvement in the " letter of 500 " , a controversial appeal to the Prosecutor General to review all Jewish organizations in Russia for extremism . The Press Center of the Belgorod Regional Administration responded by stating that a planned monument to Sviatoslav had not yet been constructed but would show " respect towards representatives of all nationalities and religions . " When the statue was unveiled , the shield bore a twelve @-@ pointed star . 
 Svyatoslav is the main character of the books " Knyaz " ( " Князь " ) and " The Hero " ( " Герой " ) , written by Russian writer Alexander Mazin . 
 On 7 November 2011 Ukrainian fisherman Sergei <unk> fished up a one metre long <unk> sword from the waters of the Dnieper not far from the spot where Svyatoslav is believed to have been killed in 972 . The handle is made out of four different metals including gold and silver , and it is very possible that it belonged to Sviatoslav himself .

" Silver Soul " ) , also styled as Gintama , is a Japanese manga written and illustrated by Hideaki Sorachi and serialized , beginning on December 8 , 2003 , in Shueisha 's Weekly Shōnen Jump . Set in Edo which has been conquered by aliens named Amanto , the plot follows life from the point of view of samurai Gintoki Sakata , who works as a freelancer alongside his friends Shinpachi Shimura and Kagura in order to pay the monthly rent . Sorachi added the science fiction setting to develop characters to his liking after his editor suggested doing a historical series . 
 The series has been adapted into an original video animation ( OVA ) by Sunrise and was featured at Jump Festa 2006 Anime Tour in 2005 . This was followed by a full anime series , which debuted on April 4 , 2006 in TV Tokyo and finished on March 25 , 2010 . A sequel titled Gintama ' first premiered in Japan on April 4 , 2011 and ended on March 26 , 2012 , before returning once again for a brief run from October 4 , 2012 to March 28 , 2013 .

It debuted in the January 2007 issue , and was serialized at a rate of one chapter a month . Sentai Filmworks initially licensed the series . The website Crunchyroll purchased the anime 's streaming rights and home video rights .

The anime and its DVDs have been featured , at various time , in Top Ten of their respective media , while TV Tokyo has announced that the first Gin Tama anime was responsible for high sales overseas along with the anime adaptation from Naruto . Publications for manga , anime and others have commented on the Gin Tama manga . Positive response have focused on the comedy and characters from the series , while negative responses concern the manga 's artwork . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The story is set in an alternate late Edo period . Humanity is attacked by aliens called " Amanto " ( <unk> , " Sky People " ) . The samurai of Japan join the battle against the aliens , but when the Shogun realizes the power of aliens , he betrays the samurai and surrenders to the aliens . The Shogun writes an unequal contract with aliens which allows the aliens to enter the country and places a ban on carrying swords in public . The swords of samurai are taken away so they can no longer resist the aliens . After that the Shogunate becomes a puppet government . 
 The plot is focused on an eccentric samurai , Gintoki Sakata ( aka Odd Jobs Gin ) who helps a teenager named Shinpachi Shimura save his sister Tae from a group of aliens who want to make her part of a brothel . Impressed with Gintoki , Shinpachi becomes his apprentice and works with him as a freelance odd @-@ jobs man in order to pay the monthly rent on Gintoki 's combination home and office , as well as to know more about him . 
 The two of them rescue a teenage alien girl named Kagura from a group of Yakuza who wanted to use her superhuman strength to kill people . Kagura joins Shinpachi and Gintoki to work as freelancers and the three become known as " Yorozuya " ( <unk> , " We do everything " or literally " The Anything Store " ) . 
 While doing their job , they encounter the police force Shinsengumi several times , who normally ally with Odd Jobs Gin in their work since the jobs commonly involve dangerous criminals . They eventually meet some of Gintoki 's former comrades from the fight against the Amanto 's invasion , including the revolutionary Kotaro Katsura who maintains a friendly relationship with them despite his terrorist activities against the bakufu . On the other hand , Shinsuke <unk> acts as a major antagonist throughout the series , as he wants to destroy the bakufu and sees his former comrades as enemies . 
 Although the series ' story is commonly episodic , there are also a few story arcs which are developed through several chapters . Across several story arcs <unk> starts gaining allies including Kagura 's brother , Kamui , and the elite unit <unk> to prepare for his large scale coup d 'état .

 Hideaki Sorachi 's main focus in Gin Tama is the use of gags ; during the manga 's second year of serialization he started to add more drama to the story while still keeping the comedy . Various jokes from the manga are comments regarding clichés from other shōnen series . For example , in the first chapter after Gintoki fights a group of aliens to protect Shinpachi and Tae , Shinpachi complains that he only fought for " one page " and Gintoki replies , " Shut up ! One page is a long time for a manga artist ! " Gintoki 's exaggerated desire to read the Weekly Shōnen Jump ( which causes him to fight other readers in order to get it ) also makes fun of shōnen , since during those parts characters quote them . Other types of comic situations are more general , so that the reader must know about Japanese culture to understand them . The humour is described by publications as being " bizarre " and " weird " . It is also described as being divided between two categories : " sci @-@ fi comedy " and a " samurai comedy " with the former referring to the aliens . It tends to point out " an irritating foible about modern society " including celebrations days or famous mythical figures . Additionally , there are references to several historical figures with a few characters from the story being based on them . Besides the series ' comedy , the aliens ' invasion in Japan bring several social issues between them and the humans with the most recurring one being the lack of social equality . As a result , one of the main themes involves society trying to preserve their own way of living rather than fulfilling a dream like in other shōnen series . 
 = = Production = = 
 In 2003 , Hideaki Sorachi was an up @-@ and @-@ coming manga artist who had already created two one @-@ shots for the Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine . Although he was preparing to write his first serialized series , his editor suggested he create a manga series based on the Shinsengumi , mostly inspired by an upcoming TV @-@ drama about the 1860s troupe as depicted by idol actors . Sorachi attempted to create this series since he admitted to liking the Shinsengumi , but ultimately failed to get anything off the ground . Instead of abandoning the idea completely , he remained focused on the historical Japanese era but began to create his own story , adding in elements of science fiction and fictionalizing many of the figures from the era to create a story more to his own liking . The original title of the series was meant to be " Yorozuya Gin @-@ san " ( <unk> , lit . " General Merchant Gin @-@ san " ) , but it did not have any impact on Sorachi . After great debate , he decided to go with the name Gin Tama after discussing it with his family , deciding on a name that sounded close to the edge without being completely off it . Although Sorachi considered the one @-@ shot " <unk> " to be very poor , the setting of such one @-@ shot served as the base for Gin Tama such as the addition of alien characters . Sorachi liked the Bakumatsu and Sengoku periods due to how both were eras of change and thus presented the positive and negative points of humanity . The series was then set in an alternate Bakumatsu to give a bigger significance to the characters ' bushido as in that time samurais were at the low point of their lives . 
 The main character of the series was originally meant to be Toshiro Hijikata as Sorachi was a fan of the Shinsengumi , most notably from Hijikata Toshizō ( the Shinsengumi who was the base for the one of Gin Tama ) , after he saw the film Burn ! Sword ! . When Sorachi could not " shake off " Hijikata 's initial design , he decided not to use him as the lead character , but added him along with the Shinsengumi to the story . The pilot chapter from the series had a different plot to the one from the serialization : Shinpachi already met Gintoki in the story and there were more Shinsengumi to the story such as one based on Harada Sanosuke . As all these new Shinsengumi were older than most of the recurring characters from the series , Sorachi removed them thinking they were not entertaining . When asked by a fan , Sorachi mentioned that most characters from the series are based on real @-@ life Edo citizens while Gintoki 's character is roughly based on the folk hero Sakata <unk> . 
 When starting serialization the manga was unpopular and was close to being cancelled . Although Sorachi was pleased with the first tankōbon selling all of its copies , he later learned Shueisha was afraid of poor sales which resulted in the minimum printed . In order to increase its popularity , the author introduce new characters , the Shinsengumi , who felt memorable to his assistants . Sorachi had little hope on the manga 's popularity , as he noted that people used to tell him the manga would not surpass the number of two tankōbon volumes . However , once the third volume was released , Sorachi found that he did not have " any fresh material to use . " During the first year of the series , Sorachi believed that the source of the popularity of Gin Tama was partially connected to the Shinsengumi drama . While the drama ran during the first year of the series , when the manga was mostly shorter stories that established the characters and the world , he felt uncomfortable of making things related to the drama . By the second year and beyond , he became more daring in his stories and concepts , creating longer storylines that included more drama while keeping his sense of humor and <unk> of modern Japan by way of his fictionalized past . Although Sorachi has already planned the series ' ending , he is not sure when the manga is going to reach that point due to the characters requiring development to behave the way he wants . 
 When working on a chapter of Gintama , Sorachi sometimes has problems finishing the manuscript , leaving his supervisor to take it before he can revise it . He figures out what to write by staying in his room or going for a walk . Although he commented that some of his ideas are " random , " he focuses on the fact that they are all related to the manga , and when he has problems coming up with ideas , Sorachi is often helped by his editor . Thinking of Gin Tama as a " non @-@ sense manga , " before writing a chapter , Sorachi decides whether it should be a comedy or a drama . Sorachi defines Gin Tama as a " science fiction human drama pseudo @-@ historical comedy . " 
 When Sorachi is illustrating Gin Tama , he usually uses a felt @-@ tip pen , a fountain pen , a brush @-@ tip pen , and a <unk> , but for the major characters he only uses a felt @-@ tip pen and a fountain pen , and does their outlines with a <unk> @-@ 0 @.@ 8 .

 The music video for " Toxic " was filmed over three days in December 2003 , on a sound @-@ stage in Los Angeles , California . It was directed by Joseph Kahn , who previously worked with Spears on the music video for her 2000 single " Stronger " . The editor of the video was David Blackburn , who also edit " Womanizer " and " Do Somethin ' " . Spears first approached Kahn with a story sketch of a secret agent out for revenge against an ex @-@ lover , to which Kahn created a treatment for . Her concept was almost fully formed and detailed , exemplifying the scene in which she drops water on the passenger 's lap . Kahn said , " That 's part of her brilliance [ ... ] She totally understands that she 's naughty and nice , that she 's the girl @-@ next @-@ door gone bad who is constantly titillating you " . Spears said she wanted to join the mile high club and be a stewardess that kissed a man in the bathroom . Kahn suggested making him a fat man , so the " common man " would feel represented . Spears also told him about a scene in which she would be naked and covered in diamonds . Kahn stated he was " not sure what I was thinking about when she told me about that scene , maybe those intros to James Bond movies , but every video needs an iconic image to remember , and that 's it " . 
 The choreography was a collaboration between Brian Friedman and Spears , and every scene had a completely different strictly structured routine . After the treatment was finished , Kahn proceeded to cast his friends and acquaintances , as in most of his projects . The plane passenger in which Spears drops water on was played by his long @-@ time casting director , while the fat man in the bathroom was played by the casting director 's assistant .

He explained " the trick was to make it look pop at the same time " and told Henderson " ' Would you like to be kissed by Britney Spears ? ' " . According to Kahn , the hint of a smile that appears on Henderson 's face before Spears pours the poison into his mouth was what managed to get the shot past censors . Although Spears was at first going to be involved in the editing process with Blackburn , she did not contact Kahn after the media scandal over her wedding in Las Vegas . " Toxic " is Spears 's most expensive music video to date , at a cost of $ 1 million . The music video premiered exclusively on MTV 's Making the Video on January 13 , 2004 .

 " Home " is the third episode of the fourth season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : Enterprise . It first aired on October 22 , 2004 , on the UPN network in the United States . It was the second episode of the season directed by Allan Kroeker and the first in season four to be written by Michael Sussman . 
 Set in the 22nd century , the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship , Enterprise , registration NX @-@ 01 . This episode brought to a close the Xindi story arc that ran throughout Season 3 , with the crew returning to Earth after the successful mission . It features three stories ; Captain Jonathan Archer ( Scott Bakula ) coming to terms with the psychological impact of the previous mission , Doctor Phlox ( John Billingsley ) finds that the people on Earth have become hostile to aliens , while Commander Charles " Trip " Tucker ( Connor Trinneer ) and Sub @-@ Commander T 'Pol ( Jolene Blalock ) travel to Vulcan for her arranged marriage . 
 The episode featured the return of several recurring characters , such as Vaughn Armstrong as Admiral Maxwell Forrest and Gary Graham as Ambassador Soval . Others who made their first of several appearances included Michael Reilly Burke , Ada Maris , Jack Donner and Joanna Cassidy as T 'Pol 's mother . Filming took seven days , during which time the standing sets used for the interior of Enterprise were redressed to appear as its sister ship , Columbia ( NX @-@ 02 ) , and location filming was conducted at Malibu Creek State Park . " Home " received a mixed reception from critics , and was watched by 3 @.@ 16 million viewers on first broadcast . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Captain Archer and the crew are welcomed back to Earth following the successful Xindi mission . As Enterprise undergoes repairs and refitting , Archer is reunited with a former girlfriend , Captain Erika Hernandez , who has been appointed to Starfleet 's second Warp 5 starship , Columbia ( NX @-@ 02 ) . Archer is debriefed by Admiral Maxwell Forrest and Ambassador Soval . After reacting in anger when Soval asks pointed questions about the <unk> incident , he is ordered by Forrest to take some relaxation leave . 
 He chooses to go mountain climbing ; to his initial annoyance , Hernandez invites herself along . That night , Archer dreams that he is attacked by Reptilians , and Hernandez tries to help him come to terms with his memories and new @-@ found adulation . In return , Archer tries to caution her that space exploration is not as idealistic as she thinks it is . In spite of this , the two manage to rekindle their romance . Returning to Starfleet Command , Archer is able to keep his emotions in check , and ultimately receives an unexpected thanks from Soval . Elsewhere , Doctor Phlox learns that some humans still hold a grudge over the Xindi attack , <unk> blaming all aliens , and Phlox 's presence in a bar results in a brawl . 
 Meanwhile , Sub @-@ Commander T 'Pol – who has been invited to accept a Starfleet commission – takes the opportunity to travel to Vulcan to visit her mother , T 'Les . When Commander Tucker mentions that he does not have a home to go to , T 'Pol invites him along . On Vulcan , after a tense homecoming , she learns that her mother has resigned from the Vulcan Science Academy as indirect punishment for T 'Pol 's actions at the P <unk> sanctuary . One logical way for T 'Pol to restore her mother 's position is to honor her engagement to Koss , a member of an influential family . Despite Tucker 's feelings , who admits to T 'Les ' observation that he is in love with T 'Pol , she consents to marry Koss . Just before the ceremony begins , however , T 'Pol quickly kisses Tucker on the cheek .

 When predicting what would be in store for season four , Scott Bakula suggested that he would like to see the crew come to terms with the emotional scars of the mission they had against the Xindi in the third season . He wanted several questions to be covered , such as " How do they come back into society , how do they re @-@ adjust their behaviors ? What has happened to them will always be inside of them , every time they 're confronted with new situations . " Following the resolution of the mission in " Zero Hour " , he wanted the crew to receive " a great reception " on their return to Earth . He was pleased with how this was handled in the series , describing " Home " as " a great episode " . When actress Jolene Blalock revealed that her character would be getting married in " Home " , she joked that she wouldn 't need to fight someone – a reference to the Star Trek : The Original Series episode " Amok Time " . Dominic Keating summed up the plot of the episode in an interview with Cult Times magazine , saying " Our heroes find that their world has changed after the Xindi annihilation of Florida at the end of the second year . " 
 The episode featured the return of several recurring characters , such as Admiral Forrest played by Vaughn Armstrong , who hadn 't appeared on the show for more than a year . Meanwhile , Gary Graham returned as Soval after a single appearance in the third season , and Jim Fitzpatrick made a third appearance as Commander Williams . There were several actors who appeared in the series for the first time including Jack Donner , although he had appeared as Subcommander Tal in The Original Series episode " The Enterprise Incident " . He described in an interview with TrekNation that he had been seeking to return to the Star Trek franchise for a while , having previously been overlooked for a part on Star Trek : Voyager . He said that his casting was directly linked to showrunner Manny Coto 's desire to link Enterprise more to The Original Series and was pleased to say that they had ask him back to appear later in the season . 
 Also making an appearance was Michael Reilly Burke as Koss – a character who was first mentioned in the first season episode " Breaking the Ice " . Burke had previously appeared as a Borg in Star Trek : The Next Generation and a Cardassian in Star Trek : Deep Space Nine . Also making their first appearances in the show were Ada Maris as Captain Erika <unk> and Joanna Cassidy as T 'Pol 's mother , T 'Les . Donner , Burke and Cassidy would go on to appear in the Vulcan @-@ arc episodes later in the season , while Maris appeared in the Klingon two part story comprising " Affliction " and " Divergence " . 
 Filming began on August 4 for seven days , finishing on August 12 . The Enterprise standing sets were re @-@ dressed to appear as the interior scenes on the USS Columbia and a variety of swing sets were used . There was exterior shots filmed at Malibu Creek State Park for the scenes with Archer and Hernandez . One area which had only previously been mentioned in Star Trek was the Fire Plains on Vulcan – in the Star Trek : Voyager episode " Innocence " , which was created in " Home " using computer @-@ generated imagery . Allan Kroeker directed " Home " , his second of the season after the first episode of " Storm Front " – although he had directed numerous episodes during the first three seasons , and " Home " was written by Mike Sussman , who wrote five episodes during the previous season . 
 = = Reception and home media release = = 
 " Home " first premiered on UPN in the United States on October 22 , 2004 . It was watched by an audience of 3 @.@ 16 million viewers , an increase over the previous week 's episode , the second part of " Storm Front " which was watched by 3 @.@ 11 million . This was part of an overall increase in viewers during the first six episodes of Enterprise , with each episode being watched by a greater number of viewers than those before it . According to the Nielsen ratings received for " Home " , the episode placed fifth in its timeslot , with a rating of 1 @.@ 7 / 3 percent . This means that it was seen by 1 @.@ 7 percent of all households , and 3 percent of all those watching television at the time of broadcast . It gained higher ratings than The WB , who aired What I Like About You and Grounded for Life . 
 Prior to broadcast , " Home " was listed as one of the programmes on Entertainment Weekly 's " Tonight 's Best TV " for October 22 . In another preview , IGN <unk> described the episode as a " <unk> " , and described the writers as " lazy " because of the trade off between character development and a general plot – the latter of which they said was absent in this episode . However , the review praised the additional attention given to Linda Park as Hoshi , saying that she is " possibly the most under @-@ utilized actor on the show and shows the most potential . " Overall it said that " the episode hints at promise for the rest of the season but is dull as <unk> on its own . " 
 Ryan Britt , while writing for Tor.com , thought more favourably of " Home " , including it in a list of six episodes from Enterprise which are comparable to the best of the other Star Trek series . It was described as " the sort of episode that either rewards someone who liked the characters on this show , or could potentially get you to like them if you didn ’ t really know what was going on . " Britt 's only complaint was that the romance between T 'Pol and Tucker wasn 't further developed as it brought out the best in Blalock and Trinneer . 
 The first home media release of " Home " was in the season four DVD box set of Enterprise , originally released in the United States on November 1 , 2005 . The Blu ray release of the final season of Enterprise was on April 29 , 2014 . 
 = Vanajan Autotehdas = 
 Vanajan Autotehdas Oy ( VAT ) was a producer of heavy vehicles based in Hämeenlinna , Finland . The company was founded as Yhteissisu Oy in 1943 by the Finnish government and a number of major Finnish companies with the aim of producing lorries and buses for the Finnish Defence Forces . World War II was over before the company could start series production ; it was renamed Vanajan Autotehdas and the marque became Vanaja . Subsequently , the production consisted of outdated lorry models , partly built from military surplus materials . After overcoming initial difficulties , the company modernised its products , became profitable and grew until the mid 1950s . Many major components , including engines , were imported . Diesel engines became widely available in 1955 , and in 1959 VAT introduced its most significant innovation , the full load lifting tandem axle mechanism , which improved off @-@ road capability significantly ; the system is now used in Sisu vehicles . 
 The company started producing bus chassis in 1950 , and the superstructures were built by a number of Finnish coach builders . The last models were appreciated by a number of bus operators , and missed after production was stopped . All Vanaja bus chassis were fitted with air brakes by 1958 , after the failure of hydraulic brakes on a Vanaja bus had led to one of the worst traffic accidents ever to have happened in Finland . 
 VAT fell into financial difficulties by end of the 1960s ; this led to a merger with the other Finnish heavy vehicle producer Oy Suomen Autoteollisuus Ab at the end of 1968 . The Vanaja brand ceased to exist in 1971 , after which the former Vanaja factory produced Sisu terminal tractors , bus chassis , military vehicles and mobile crane chassis . The factory now belongs to Patria — which produces Patria AMV armoured personnel carriers — and heavy @-@ vehicle axle producer Sisu Axles . 
 Vanajan Autotehdas was always a small company , employing about 400 people in 1968 , and in the 1960s its market share was barely 5 % in Finland . Almost all Vanajas were sold for the domestic market ; only a few units were exported . Vanaja vehicles became known for their robust construction and high degree of customisation . The number of Vanaja bus chassis and lorries totalled 7 @,@ 140 units ; this consists of 260 lorry and 66 bus chassis models ; for 116 lorry models only one or two units were produced . Vanajas had a good reputation and they are nowadays valued by vintage vehicle enthusiasts . 
 = = Foundation = = 
 During the winter of 1942 – 43 , the Finnish Defence Forces estimated there was no immediate prospect of a quick end to the Continuation War but there was an immediate need for new vehicles . In the longer term , the army was expected to need at least 7 @,@ 000 lorries and buses . Neutral countries such as Sweden and Switzerland were willing to sell vehicles to Finland but demanded payment in advance and in their own currencies . As Finland did not have sufficient currency reserves the only option was to develop domestic vehicle production . 
 At that time , the only Finnish heavy vehicle producer Oy Suomen Autoteollisuus Ab ( SAT ) was building a new factory in Karis , a location considered less likely than Helsinki to come under attack from Soviet air raids . Company general director Tor Nessling suggested the factory should be larger than originally planned . As another option , Nessling , with extreme reservation , considered building a new factory elsewhere in Finland . SAT was experienced in heavy vehicle production but economic and technical resources were limited . Heavy vehicle importers and some political cliques thought SAT was trying to benefit from the war and to gain a dominant position in the Finnish market . 
 Defence minister Rudolf Walden called a meeting held on 3 and 4 March 1943 to explore solutions to the acute shortage of vehicles . The meeting was attended by representatives of the government and military leadership , and key personnel from leading Finnish industrial companies . A committee was formed to propose founding a company in which SAT and the state were both involved . The proposal was presented in a meeting on 20 March . The name of the company was Oy Yhteissisu Ab ( " mutual Sisu " ) , which meant the intention was joint production of Sisu vehicles . The private owners were A. <unk> , Ata , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> Oy , <unk> , W. <unk> & Co . , Suomen Autoteollisuus , Suomen Gummitehdas , Suomen <unk> , Tampereen <unk> ja <unk> @-@ <unk> , <unk> <unk> and Strömberg . The headquarters was in <unk> in Helsinki . The company chairman was Heikki H. <unk> and the reluctant Tor Nessling was appointed general manager . 
 The Defence Forces set strict requirements for the vehicles to be produced . There was not enough time to develop a new model . Although outdated , the best of the available options was the Sisu S @-@ 21 . Yhteissisu and SAT agreed to transfer Sisu S @-@ 21 lorry production to Yhteissisu . The Yhteissisu @-@ produced models were named S @-@ 22 . 
 = = Start of production = = 
 Immediately after the company was founded , production started in the SAT factory in <unk> , Helsinki . The Yhteissisu vehicles were built separately from SAT vehicles . It was clear from the start that vehicles should be produced away from Helsinki ; the company sought a suitable location close to good rail , road and waterway connections . The original idea was to build the factory inside caves mined into bedrock ; the place would be required to have suitable geology . A suitable area was finally found in Vanaja next to Hämeenlinna . Yhteissisu bought 31 @.@ 1 hectares ( 77 acres ) of land on 14 March 1944 . A contract for factory construction was signed with a contractor on 30 March . The Railway Administration accepted Yhteissisu 's plan to build a railway connection in the area . Quarrying work for the underground workshop began in July 1944 . The expense and a shortage of time meant the plan had to be amended , and the entire production area was built above ground . The factory buildings were completed in early November 1944 . Alvar Aalto 's architectural office designed houses for the factory workers . 
 The first lorry made in Vanaja was a Sisu S @-@ 22 prototype , which rolled out of the factory door on 1 August 1945 . After a short and intensive testing period , serial production began on 29 October 1945 but because of a shortage of materials and component quality problems , the first vehicles were not ready until early 1946 . The capabilities of the domestic suppliers proved to be very limited and the company was dependent on imported gearboxes , steering components , drive shafts and electrical systems until domestic companies could set up their own production . The Finnish suppliers were unable to meet the requirements with the available materials and experienced severe quality problems . Total production in 1946 was 147 Sisu S @-@ 22 vehicles , which was far below the target of 2 @,@ 000 vehicles . The original , calculated price per vehicle had been 765 @,@ 000 marks but the eventual cost was 800 @,@ 000 marks . 
 The war had ended before series production was started , and the Defence Forces did not need new vehicles . On the contrary , the army had to reduce the number of vehicles according to the Moscow Armistice . The frustrated component suppliers left the business and the Ministry of Trade and Industry terminated the vehicle supply contract from the end of 1946 . In early 1946 , Yhteissisu had agreed with the Ministry of Trade and Industry that vehicles not bought by the state could be sold on the civilian market . Sisu S @-@ 22s became available for sale at 12 SAT locations in Finland . The company presented a lighter , lower @-@ cost model , the S @-@ <unk> , at the Helsinki Domestic Industry Fair in May 1946 . 
 = = From Yhteissisu to Vanajan Autotehdas = = 
 Tor Nessling resigned from Yhteissisu in February 1947 . There was talk of closing the company . Yhteissisu sold only 103 S @-@ 22s in 1947 , some of which had been produced the previous year . 55 lorries were built by the company in 1947 . The company 's share capital was reduced from 75 million marks to 7 @.@ 5 million , then increased to 50 million ; the state became the main owner , having a 44 % share of the company . The other owners were <unk> <unk> , A. <unk> , Strömberg and Tampereen <unk> ja <unk> @-@ <unk> . From September , the new general manager of the company was Eero Kytölä . The company lost two million marks in 1947 . 
 Yhteissisu had the rights to use the Sisu brand until summer 1948 . In a general meeting held in 1948 , the board decided to rename the company Vanajan Autotehdas and the brand of the vehicles became Vanaja . The factory area was moved from the municipality of Vanaja to that of Hämeenlinna at the beginning of the same year .

 General manager Kytölä travelled to France and West Germany in 1947 and early 1948 to buy military surplus materials from the Western Allies . He bought 425 White Motor Company M2 Half @-@ Track vehicles , 186 lorry engines , 304 Cadillac V8 engines , 4 Mack ED diesel engines , 2 Hercules Diesel <unk> engines , 11 @,@ 000 GMC wheels and one 45 @-@ tonne @-@ capacity trailer . Trading was organised through the Ministry of Supply and the first delivery arrived in March 1948 . The White Half @-@ Track vehicles were without armour ; Kytölä 's idea was to equip them with superstructures for field or forest clearing , or to convert them into Four @-@ wheel drive lorries by replacing the tracks with a conventional rear axle . In total , VAT sold 359 units as half @-@ tracks , and 60 were converted into 4 × 4 or 4 × 2 vehicles . These lorries were sold as Vanaja <unk> . Some of the half @-@ track vehicles were scrapped for parts ; the last was sold in 1952 . 
 = = Growth and recession in 1950s = = 
 After the original contract with the state was terminated , a new agreement for the production of 650 vehicles to be delivered between 1948 and 1952 was reached . The state helped production with a significant <unk> of 132 million marks . According to the contract , 150 vehicles were scheduled to be built in 1948 . The company reached this target and made a further 11 vehicles for private use . 92 were sold under the name of Sisu S @-@ 22 or S @-@ <unk> and 69 were badged as Vanaja V @-@ 48 . 101 M2 Half @-@ Tracks were sold . In 1948 , VAT made a loss of 746 @,@ 000 marks . In 1949 , VAT made another 150 vehicles for the state and 37 vehicles for private operators ; it produced 163 V @-@ 48s and 24 <unk> . The company also sold 211 M2 Half @-@ Tracks , allowing it to declare its first profit of 1 @.@ 208 million marks , which was helped by a devaluation of the Finnish mark . 
 VAT 's positioning in the heavy @-@ vehicle market strengthened in 1950 and the company started producing bus chassis . The same year , VAT introduced a new product family — the VK series . Production was disrupted by a three @-@ month strike , as a result of which completion of some of the 150 state @-@ ordered vehicles scheduled for delivery that year was delayed until the following year . Despite its difficulties VAT posted a profit of almost two million marks . By now , the company employed 106 workers . 
 Sales and profits grew year @-@ on @-@ year during the early 1950s . The <unk> from the government was repaid in 1952 . For a short time , VAT imported and marketed clearing tractors produced by Italian firm Ansaldo @-@ Fossati . Although there was demand for this type of vehicle , they sold poorly because their price was considered inconsistent with their technical quality ; only a few units were delivered in 1953 . 
 The development of sales was overestimated ; in 1956 , 525 Vanajas were sold and in March 1957 , the volume for the whole year was estimated to reach about 400 units . VAT employed about 200 workers at the time and changed to a four @-@ day working week . The company blamed the government 's import licence bureaucracy for the problem — it was difficult to get diesel engines from abroad . In the following month , over 30 Vanajas that were otherwise ready were awaiting diesel engines . The economy improved in 1959 . 
 = = = Criticism = = = 
 In 1950 , the Finnish government was criticised for ignoring other options and buying only Vanajas , which were said to be overpriced . The state had ordered 650 vehicles , spread over several years , and this tied the state 's hands in equipment buying for a long period . 
 Both VAT and SAT were criticised in 1954 by heavy vehicle importers because the two companies had access to a large share of the limited foreign currency reserves for component supply . The importers ' representatives said neither Sisu nor Vanaja were very domestic products and the vehicles the importers represented were actually more domestic because some assembly work was done in Finland . According to the Association of Vehicle Importers , the domestic vehicles cost between 30 % and 80 % more compared to imported ones . The following year , the government started to investigate possibilities for importing heavy vehicles in kit form to reduce foreign @-@ currency expenditure . VAT and SAT expressed doubts about the viability of such production . In 1957 , the government ended restrictions on the import of heavy vehicle chassis . Eventually , the prices of imported vehicles approached those of Sisu and Vanaja vehicles . 
 = = = Entering the diesel era = = = 
 The Vanaja petrol engines made by SAT and Tampella were outdated American engines built under licence . Customers wanted diesel engines , which were more powerful . The first Vanaja diesel models were powered by Kämper and <unk> engines . VAT also tested <unk> 's two @-@ stroke diesel engines but only one such vehicle was built . Import licences for diesel engines were difficult to obtain and this constrained vehicle sales . In some cases , customers provided their own engines — for example Volvo or Mercedes @-@ Benz , which were mounted to their ordered vehicles on the assembly line . In 1955 , VAT bought two batches of 6 @-@ cylinder 90 @-@ hp Leyland 0 @.@ 350 diesel engines . These proved to be too inefficient , and the following year the company ordered a batch of 300 stronger <unk> made in the Netherlands by van <unk> 's <unk> N.V. 
 In 1956 , VAT became the representative for Ansaldo S.A. and Kämper @-@ Motoren GmbH . Ansaldo offered engines of between 100 hp and 8 @,@ 000 hp intended for marine and industrial applications . Kämper products delivered between 14 hp and 150 hp . A 6 @-@ cylinder , 130 @-@ hp Kämper was offered as an option for Vanajas .

 The best @-@ known hallmark of Vanaja , the full @-@ load lifting tandem axle , was introduced in January 1957 . This invention enabled an additional load of 2 @.@ 5 tonnes to be carried and the entire load on the tandem could be moved to the fore axle using an electro @-@ hydraulic system . The system improved the traction , offering a significant advantage on slippery surfaces . The innovative lifting tandem was developed under leadership of the company 's chief engineer Veikko <unk> . Vanaja became the leader in the Finnish logging vehicle market and maintained this position until production ceased . In forestry work , a layout with a driven front axle and a tandem axle with a driven fore axle , called 4 × 4 + 2 , became famous in Finland but is seldom seen outside the Nordic countries . 
 = = Vehicles for the Finnish Defence Forces = = 
 The Finnish Defence Forces carried out a winter test for potential military vehicles in March 1958 . 35 candidate vehicles from the two domestic producers and various importers were driven around Finland . VAT sent four vehicles to the test , three of which were 4 × 4s and one was an ordinary , rear @-@ wheel driven vehicle . During the five days ' testing period , all vehicles were continuously fully loaded . For part of the journey , the vehicles had to tow an eight @-@ ton field cannon . The vehicles were tested for off @-@ road capabilities in even , 50 @-@ to @-@ 70 cm ( 20 @-@ to @-@ 28 in ) -deep snow . One of the Vanajas was destroyed in an accident . The domestic vehicles performed well in the test ; in some cases the rear @-@ wheel driven Sisus and Vanajas outperformed the 4 × 4 @-@ driven foreign competitors . None of the vehicles were clearly better than the others but the result convinced the Defence Forces of the capabilities of the domestic vehicles and led to several deals for SAT and VAT . 
 In 1960 , VAT delivered the first Vanaja <unk> lorries , which were intended for general use in garrisons , to the Defence Forces . The later versions were called AS @-@ 33 . 155 units were produced . Vanaja NS @-@ 47 was the first Finnish 4 × 4 off @-@ road lorry designed primarily for military use . A few dozen vehicles were ordered between 1962 and 1964 , and were used for hauling 35 mm Oerlikon anti @-@ aircraft cannons and heavy artillery . 
 = = Exporting efforts = = 
 In September 1958 VAT , together with other Finnish companies , participated in the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair . The vehicles shown were one Vanaja VAK lorry and a mid @-@ engined <unk> bus chassis . Due to the AEC engines the Vanaja 's did not raise interest among the potential Greek customers , as relations between the UK and Greece were bad at the time . The lorry was finally sold in Greece but the bus chassis returned to Finland and was sold to a bus operator which built a tourist bus body on it . 
 VAT signed a contract to sell 200 lorries to Turkey in 1959 . The first two vehicles were shipped from Finland in 1959 but the contract was terminated in an embarrassing way because the Bank of Finland refused to take Turkish liras in payment . 
 At the end of the 1950s and in the early 1960s , VAT and the French <unk> <unk> SA had plans for joint production , but only one jointly produced prototype was ever made ; the chassis was from Vanaja , the engine was from AEC , and the cabin , which was a forward control type cabin and partly made from glass fibre , was from <unk> . 
 Four Vanaja 's were shown at the Barcelona international fair in June 1961 . The vehicles were taken to the fair by driving them through Europe . The fair was considered successful , but no vehicle sales resulted from it . 
 = = <unk> in 1960s = = 
 General Manager Eero Kytölä resigned from his position in 1962 . DI Ilmari Karttunen , who had previously worked as factory superintendent , was appointed the new head of the company . He led VAT until 1967 , when Jaakko <unk> took the post . 
 During 1958 – 1960 VAT focused increasingly on custom @-@ building vehicles according to customer request . Typically a potential customer just walked into the main office in Helsinki or factory in Hämeenlinna and described what kind of vehicle he wanted . The enthusiastic engineers listened carefully to every individual customer 's wishes and designed vehicles accordingly , with two or three axles , desired layout , wheelbase and with conventional or forward control cabin . Many vehicle types were only produced for one or two units . The volume model , however , was a nine @-@ tonne variant of the VAK series . 
 A good example of custom @-@ built vehicles are the <unk> series forward @-@ control vehicles , developed for an <unk> company in Helsinki . The company needed short vehicles with a good grade ability and high payload . The wheelbase of these vehicles was 3 @.@ 8 metres ( 12 ft ) and the total weight was 10 @.@ 6 tonnes ; use of these vehicles on public roads required a special permit . 
 A typical feature in Vanajas was over @-@ engineered structures which were robust rather than optimised . The main components were sourced from well @-@ established suppliers . VAT also showed progressive thinking in driver ergonomics ; the comfortably sprung and hydraulically damped driver 's seat was positioned close to the door , to ease reversing . The seat had several ways in which it could be adjusted . Hanging pedals , which were set to the same level , became standard at an early stage . Vanaja 's interior heater , which produced 9 @,@ 000 kcal / h , was possibly the most efficient available in lorries by the 1960s . Many Vanaja drivers valued the particularly soft suspension of the vehicles . Two @-@ axle lorries were available in 4 × 2 and 4 × 4 layouts ; the three @-@ axle models were produced as 6 × 2 , 6 × 4 , 4 × 4 + 2 and 6 × 6 . 
 VAT celebrated its 20th anniversary in 1963 . All press releases and publications ignored the fact that its key competitor , SAT , had had a significant role in its foundation . Yhteissisu was not mentioned in any context . 
 VAT got a notable order from the Infrastructure and Hydro Engineering Administration in April 1965 . The order for 250 vehicles was funded by a loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( IBRD ) for development of the road network . Forty vehicles were equipped with a driven front axle . The order was completed in 1966 . 
 The company faced a difficult situation again in 1967 when the total number of vehicles produced was just 381 units . At the beginning of 1968 VAT fired 40 of the 400 employees . Vanaja had its staunch customer base and the vehicles were generally well regarded but the overall market share remained low ; in 1963 just 4 – 5 % of the newly registered heavy lorries in Finland were Vanajas . The highly customised production had led to an excessive diversity of models , which made spare part supply difficult . Moreover , the customising presumably took resources away from technical development work . There was no change for the better although the company introduced its modern forward control model B6 @-@ 76 which was expected to become the next volume model . 
 = = Factory and production = = 
 The original factory building , officially a warehouse and assembly hall , had a volume of 25 @,@ 000 m3 ( 33 @,@ 000 cu yd ) . The facilities were developed over time and by the end of 1953 , the floor area was 35 @,@ 000 m2 ( 42 @,@ 000 sq yd ) . The warehouse and assembly hall were renamed the main hall ; it was now 120 m ( 130 yd ) long and 30 m ( 33 yd ) wide . Bus chassis production was located at the southern side of the hall and lorries were built at the northern side . This set @-@ up was often changed depending on the product mix and production volume . 
 At the end of the building was a crane for ironware handling . When the frames were taken in , they were fitted with suspension and axles , and then turned the right way up . The next parts were the engine and transmission components . The final part for lorries was a pre @-@ assembled cabin . Conventional bus chassis were delivered with bonnet and wings , but the forward control types left the factory without any body parts . After being painted , the vehicles left the assembly hall . Finally , every vehicle was tested on a 100 @-@ to @-@ 200 km ( 62 @-@ to @-@ 124 mi ) -long test run on different roads and with various loads . The bus chassis were tested in a similar way ; because there was no body , the drivers only had warm clothes and driving goggles to protect them against the weather conditions . The vehicles were handed over to the customers after final adjustments . 
 Construction work on a new <unk> shop began in 1955 and the building was ready in 1957 . The new facilities were for machining , heat treatment and sheet metal works . Another end of the building was for a service workshop . A new service workshop with 17 vehicle places was built in 1966 . 
 = = Suppliers = = 
 = = = Engines = = = 
 VAT could offer only petrol engines until 1953 . The most common ones were the Hercules engines made domestically under licence by SAT and Tampella . The SAT @-@ made engine was called the Sisu AMG or <unk> , and the engine made by Tampella was the Tampella 6000 . The second most common engine was the Cadillac V8 1G and the third was the White 160 AX , which Kytölä had bought from Central Europe . Some Bedford petrol engines were used in Defence Forces lorries in the 1960s and Ford V8 engines were used for fire engines . The first diesel Vanajas were powered by <unk> and Kämper engines . The vast majority of diesel engines were supplied by Leyland and AEC . A few Vanajas were equipped with the Perkins R6 or the Ford Trader <unk> . In some cases , the engine was provided by the customer ; one Vanaja was powered by a Mercedes @-@ Benz diesel engine . 
 = = = Transmission = = = 
 VAT used Valmet gearboxes , which were copied from the transmissions made by the American company Fuller in the late 1940s and the early 1950s . When components became more easily available , VAT started to use genuine <unk> and ZF @-@ made gearboxes . The transfer cases were supplied by Timken and ZF . VAT built the rear axles from gears made by ATA until the company started buying axles from Timken . 
 = = = Cabins = = = 
 The company had several suppliers of lorry cabins ; they were produced at the beginning by Tampella , Valmet , <unk> <unk> , Auto @-@ Heinonen , <unk> and later as a main supplier by <unk> <unk> . VAT itself made cabins for some special , one @-@ off products . In the late 1960s , some Vanajas were equipped with British <unk> forward control cabins made by Motor Panels Ltd . The cabins were bought via A.E.C. 
 = = Bus chassis production = = 
 Bus chassis production began in 1950 . VAT made the first prototypes of rear @-@ engined buses in 1956 . The company made two prototype chassis , which were designated model VAT @-@ 4800 ; the superstructures were made by coach builders Ajokki Oy and <unk> Oy . The solution caused several technical problems , including proper cooling and transfer of heating to the front end of the body . The cooling problem was finally solved by a large air scoop located at the back of the roof ; this was not regarded as an aesthetically pleasing arrangement . As the solution was found , VAT produced ten more rear @-@ engined chassis called type VAT @-@ 5200 . 
 By 1958 , all VAT bus chassis were equipped with air brakes ; later these were also fitted to lorries . The decision was influenced by one of the worst road traffic accidents to happen in Finland ; 15 people drowned in <unk> when a fairly new Vanaja bus drove through the boom barrier of a ferry slip , sinking in 4 metres ( 13 ft ) of water . The driver survived and said the bus ' brakes had failed ; this was confirmed in the following investigation , which found the sealing of one of the hydraulic Lockheed brakes had failed . 
 VAT delivered its first mid @-@ engined bus chassis to Ajokki Oy coach works in April 1958 . It was powered by a horizontally mounted 164 @-@ hp AEC diesel engine . The end customer was bus operator Väinö <unk> Oy , which also participated in the development work . In 1960 , VAT introduced the <unk> chassis with air suspension and dual @-@ circuit air brakes . VAT returned to building rear @-@ engined buses in 1966 – 67 , but sales did not reach the level of the mid- and front @-@ engined models . The company conducted a number of experiments with the construction ; one example was a bus with a frameless structure in which the beams were replaced by a lighter solution . 
 = = Model nomenclature = = 
 The model nomenclature of the early 1950s was as follows : 
 VK : Vanaja kuorma @-@ auto ; " Vanaja lorry " 
 VL : Vanaja linja @-@ auto ; " Vanaja bus " 
 Letter B at the end , for example in model VK @-@ 6B , meant forward control cabin and L came from extra long springs . 
 The lorry model names were changed in 1956 . 
 VAK : Vanaja kuorma @-@ auto ; " Vanaja lorry " ; lorry with a conventional cabin 
 <unk> : Vanaja kuorma @-@ auto bulldog ; " Vanaja lorry forward control " 
 <unk> : Vanaja kuorma @-@ auto <unk> ; " Vanaja lorry four @-@ wheel drive " 
 <unk> : Vanaja kuorma @-@ auto telillä ; " Vanaja lorry with a tandem " ; lorry with a tandem of which one axle is driven ( 6 × 2 ) 
 <unk> : Vanaja tandem @-@ telillä ; " Vanaja driven tandem " ; lorry with a tandem of which both axles are driven ( 6 × 4 ) 
 <unk> : Vanaja <unk> telillä ; " Vanaja four @-@ wheel @-@ drive with a tandem " ; lorry with a driven front axle and tandem of which one axle is driven ( 4 × 4 + 2 ) 
 <unk> : Vanaja kuorma @-@ auto <unk> <unk> <unk> ; " Vanaja lorry all axles driven " ; lorry with a driven front axle and driven tandem ( 6 × 6 ) 
 The bus model names changed accordingly . 
 <unk> : Vanaja linja @-@ auto ; " Vanaja bus " 
 VLB : Vanaja linja @-@ auto bulldog ; " Vanaja bus forward control " ; the engine was placed in the front 
 VLK : Vanaja linja @-@ auto <unk> ; " Vanaja bus with mid @-@ placed engine " 
 VLT : Vanaja linja @-@ auto <unk> ; " Vanaja bus with rear placed engine " 
 In addition , the model name " VAT " was used for two rear @-@ engined bus models : the VAT @-@ 4800 — of which two units were produced in 1956 , and the VAT @-@ <unk> — of which ten units were produced in 1957 . The next change came in 1961 , when an engine manufacturer 's code was included in the model name . For example , the VAK lorry powered by an AEC <unk> 470 became the A @-@ 47 . Correspondingly , the same lorry with a Leyland <unk> diesel became the A @-@ <unk> ; the R stood for <unk> ( heavy ) , meaning it had a stronger front axle . The bus model names changed again in the same manner . For example , a forward control bus with the Leyland <unk> engine was called the VLB @-@ 60 . 
 The new model numbering was changed in 1963 because of increased front axle loads ; after the letter code a 2 indicated the higher axle capacity . In later models , a 6 means the front axle capacity is 6 tonnes . The S in types <unk> , AS and NS meant <unk> ( soldier ) ; they were intended for military use . 
 The bus model numbering changed for the last time in 1966 ; the front @-@ engined VLB became <unk> , the mid @-@ engined VLK was changed to <unk> and the rear @-@ engined VLT became <unk> . The three @-@ digit numbers on the bonnet sides of the last Vanaja lorries indicate the engine displacement in cubic inches . They are not model numbers , although they are often incorrectly referred to as such . 
 = = End of Vanaja = = 
 In 1964 , VAT had started to seek a stronger partner when it negotiated with AB Scania @-@ Vabis . The companies planned to use Scania engines in Vanaja vehicles but the plan proved too expensive for VAT . This may have led the major owners of VAT to start discussions about merging VAT and SAT . The chairman of VAT held regular meetings with the SAT manager Tor Nessling . In 1967 , AB Scania @-@ Vabis expressed its interest in VAT and German company Klöckner @-@ Humboldt @-@ Deutz AG was interested in co @-@ operation with , or acquisition of , VAT . Valmet is also rumoured to have been interested in VAT but there is no evidence of concrete negotiations . 
 As well as being a small producer , VAT had problems with unreliable deliveries and quality problems caused by the component suppliers . Semi @-@ finished lorries often waited outside the factory for engines or other key components . The British diesel engines suffered from more quality problems compared with their Swedish and German competitors . The company 's owners became increasingly reluctant to fund the unprofitable business . 
 Speculation about a merger between SAT and VAT began in Swedish newspapers in 1967 and was soon picked up by the Finnish media . The major owner , the state of Finland with its 45 % share , suggested a merger to Nessling in December 1967 . The financial situation of VAT was unsustainable ; the whole year 's turnover was 19 @.@ 5 million new Finnish marks when the company had debts of 14 @.@ 5 million ; 100 old Finnish marks became 1 new mark in 1963 . The contract for the merger of Suomen Autoteollisuus and Vanajan Autotehdas was signed on 30 May 1968 . VAT was formally discontinued at the end of 1968 . After the merger , the state owned 17 @.@ 2 % of the new SAT , becoming the third @-@ largest shareholder of the company . 
 Customers ' reactions to the merger varied . Most of the public understood the need for the merger of two small companies , which were both operating in a very limited market and trying to challenge the mass producers . Some loyal Vanaja customers were astounded at the decision to discontinue the make . Some customers were upset because the last long @-@ nosed Vanajas were equipped with cabins from <unk> @-@ Sisu ; they said they would never buy Sisu and moved to imported vehicles . Many proven technical solutions used in Vanajas were soon implemented on Sisus . The drop in the truck market was short @-@ lived and sales soon returned to the levels experienced by Vanaja and Sisu combined in the mid @-@ 1960s . The last Vanaja vehicles were mobile cranes produced at the end of 1971 ; subsequently all vehicles made in the SAT Hämeenlinna works were badged as Sisus . 
 Combining the strengths of the both companies was not successful in bus chassis production because of strategic mistakes by SAT . The Vanaja LK @-@ series with a large , centrally mounted engine was discontinued , which led to the loss of the main customer , Väinö <unk> Oy . SAT offered Sisu chassis to replace the Vanaja models , but a number of bus operators , including <unk> , rejected them . 
 = = = Production figures = = = 
 The number of Vanaja lorries and bus chassis produced totalled 7 @,@ 140 units . In addition , dozens of trailers and semi @-@ trailers were produced and sold under the Vanaja brand in connection with lorries . In 1955 , four Vanaja rail buses made in collaboration with <unk> firm <unk> were sold to the Finnish State Railways . 
 About 260 models of lorry were produced , which were fitted with 35 types of engine , 20 different gearboxes , and 15 to 20 types of cabin . Many of the models were produced in small numbers , with 116 types only being represented by one or two units . Most of the differences came from special <unk> that always needed approval from the authorities . In many cases , it is impossible even for experts to identify different models and years of production . There were 66 types of bus chassis produced , and the number of different body types built on them by various coach builders and operators is unknown . 
 = = From Sisu @-@ Hämeenlinna to the present = = 
 The merger led to a clash of two organisational cultures . While VAT had a flat organisation , open communication among its workforce and a spirit of togetherness , SAT 's organisation was strictly hierarchical . The division of portfolios between Karis and Hämeenlinna was changed after the merger . <unk> production was gradually concentrated at Karis and Sisu @-@ Hämeenlinna focused on producing mobile cranes , bus chassis , terminal tractors and military vehicles . Former VAT personnel had to increase production of the new portfolio and simultaneously adopt new processes , so it was three to four years before the Hämeenlinna factory could deliver results in line with its capacity . 
 In 1971 and 1981 the factory made tram bogies under licence from <unk> . The trams were made by Valmet for the city of Helsinki . Bus chassis production was officially discontinued in 1986 , although in 1989 a small batch was made and later fitted with Ajokki coach bodies for delivery to a customer in the Soviet Union . 
 SAT had planned its first terminal tractor in Helsinki in the 1960s and the production and development was continued in Hämeenlinna in 1969 . The Sisu terminal tractors became famous worldwide for their innovative design . Production was moved to Tampere in 1996 . 
 SAT 's military vehicle production was moved from the Karis Works to Hämeenlinna in 1970 . The Sisu A @-@ 45 vehicle was later followed by the introduction of two heavier versions ; the Sisu SA @-@ 150 and the Sisu SA @-@ 240 . Production of the armoured personnel carrier Sisu XA @-@ 180 " Pasi " started in the early 1980s . Several vehicles were sold to the Finnish Defence Forces and other armies ; it was also used in United Nations peacekeeping missions . Other military products were the Sisu NA @-@ 140 " Nasu " , which was produced from 1985 to 2002 , and the mine @-@ clearance vehicle Sisu RA @-@ 140 DS " <unk> " , 41 of which were produced between 1994 and 2001 . 
 In 1985 , the company moved its axle production from Helsinki to a new factory at Hämeenlinna . In 1995 , axle production was separated into an independent unit called Sisu Axles ; this was sold to investors in 1999 . The main factory builds military vehicles ; the state separated it from the parent company in 1996 and renamed it Patria Vehicles Oy . Its main products are Patria AMV armoured personnel carriers . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Vanaja was sometimes characterised as " one of the world 's best lorries " because of the company 's ability to engineer a vehicle ideal for each application in accordance with the customer 's wishes . The merger of SAT and VAT has inspired a number of imaginative conspiracy theories . In reality , the acquisition followed a normal process that was initiated by the owners . Experts in the field almost unanimously agree that the merger ensured the Finnish vehicle industry would continue well into the future . Vanajas are valued by vintage vehicle enthusiasts . 
 = Kamp Krusty = 
 " Kamp Krusty " is the first episode of The Simpsons ' fourth season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 24 , 1992 . During summer vacation , the children of Springfield attend Kamp Krusty , a summer camp named after Krusty the Clown . The camp is extremely unpleasant , leading to the campers rebelling against the camp director . The episode was written by David M. Stern and directed by Mark Kirkland . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Bart and Lisa excitedly discuss their visit to Kamp Krusty , a summer camp run by Krusty the Clown . Homer has made Bart 's visit conditional on him getting at least a C average on his report card . Bart receives a D- in each subject from Ms. Krabappel , so he changes each grade into straight A 's . Homer chides Bart for not faking plausible grades , but lets him go to camp anyway , because he does not want Bart hanging around throughout the summer . 
 The camp 's director , Mr. Black , has licensed Krusty 's name from the comedian . The campers find out that the camp is a dystopia . Dolph , Jimbo and Kearney , the camp counselors , take the children on death marches , and force them into making knockoff wallets for export . 
 Homer and Marge enjoy their summer alone , with Homer losing weight and growing hair . Lisa writes to them , describing the camp 's brutal conditions , but her parents think she is exaggerating . Bart hopes that his hero Krusty , will save them , but Krusty remains unaware of the camp 's nature , and is currently visiting England for the Wimbledon Tennis Tournament . 
 To keep the children complacent , Mr. Black informs the campers that Krusty has finally come , but it is actually Barney Gumble disguised as Krusty . Bart leads the campers in rebellion , driving out Mr. Black and the bullies . Kent Brockman reports on the revolt , where Bart explains the camp 's deplorable conditions that caused him and the campers to rebel in the first place . The stress of seeing Bart as the leader of the rebellion during the report on TV causes Homer to immediately lose the hair he grew and regain the lost weight . Krusty is called away from his vacation , and arrives at the camp where the kids at first don 't believe its him , until a rough search reveals his iconic pacemaker scar . Krusty apologizes to the children for the poor conditions , saying that he was bribed to approve the camp . As compensation , Krusty takes them to " the happiest place on Earth " , Tijuana , Mexico . 
 = = Production = = 
 The idea that the children should go to a camp run by Krusty was first suggested by David M. Stern . The animators were enthusiastic about making this episode because they had all gone to summer camps as children and thought it would be a fun episode to write for . The writers also thought that " it would be fun if while the kids are gone Homer and Marge find that as the kids are miserable their marriage is better than ever . " The layout for Bart and Lisa 's cabin was influenced by the director , Mark Kirkland , who as a child went to a Boy Scout camp that had exposed wires and other similar faults . Kirkland was also sure that the character Mr. Black was going to reappear later in the series , but he never did . Al Jean commented , " I guess that the hydrofoil really got Mr. Black out of the show forever . " 
 After he saw the completed episode , James L. Brooks called the writers and suggested that the Kamp Krusty script be used as a plotline for a film . However , the episode ran very short , and to make it barely fit the minimum time the Kamp Krusty song had to be lengthened by a number of verses . The episode was also chosen to be the first episode of the season , further complicating matters . As Jean told Brooks , " First of all , if we make it into the movie then we don 't have a premiere , and second , if we can 't make 18 minutes out of this episode how are we supposed to make 80 ? " 
 Along with the following episode " A Streetcar Named Marge " , " Kamp Krusty " was a holdover from the previous season 's production run . It was the final episode to be produced in this run and so the last animated at Klasky Csupo , before the show 's producers Gracie Films moved its domestic production to Film Roman . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 Some elements of the plot are borrowed from the Allan Sherman song " Hello <unk> , Hello <unk> " , a song about a kid who went to camp and hated it . The idea for the song sung by the children was from a 1960s TV show called Camp <unk> , which has a theme song that is similar to the Kamp Krusty song . The song was later used in " Marge Be Not Proud " , and inspired the title of a later episode . 
 The scene where Lisa gives a bottle of whiskey to a man on horseback ( payment for delivering a letter ) is a reference to Meryl Streep 's scene from the film The French Lieutenant 's Woman . Some aspects of the episode are references to the novel Lord of the Flies ( a pig 's head on a spear , kids using primitive weapons and wearing war paint , and a burning effigy ) . 
 The scene where Kearney beats a drum to make the campers work in the sweatshop is taken from the slave galley scene in the 1959 film Ben @-@ Hur . The episode ends with the song " South of the Border " . According to the DVD commentary , the song is not sung by Frank Sinatra but by another artist impersonating him . The plot of the episode inspired the 1991 video game spin @-@ off from the television series called Bart Simpson 's Escape from Camp Deadly . 
 = = Reception = = 
 In its original broadcast , " Kamp Krusty " finished 24th in ratings for the week of September 21 – 27 , 1992 , with a Nielsen rating of 13 @.@ 5 , equivalent to approximately 12 @.@ 6 million viewing households . It was the highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week . Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , the authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , had mixed views about the episode . They said that it is " A bit baffling to non @-@ Americans unfamiliar with the summer camp system . But top grade stuff nonetheless . Anyone who 's worked as a counsellor in such a place can testify to this episode 's authenticity . " The episode 's reference to Ben @-@ Hur was named the 31st greatest film reference in the history of the show by Total Film 's Nathan Ditum . 
 = John Morrison ( wrestler ) = 
 John Randall Hennigan ( born October 3 , 1979 ) is an American professional wrestler and actor , who is best known for his tenure with the WWE where he was better known by his ring names John Morrison and Johnny Nitro . He currently wrestles for Lucha Underground under the ring name Johnny Mundo . 
 Hennigan entered Tough Enough III , a televised competition that would award the winner a WWE contract . Hennigan won the competition and was assigned to their developmental territory , Ohio Valley Wrestling ( OVW ) , to continue his wrestling training . While situated at OVW , he adopted the ring name Johnny Nitro and was placed in a tag team with Joey Mercury . The duo won the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship and alongside their manager Melina , the stable was called MNM . 
 After signing with WWE , MNM was called up to the SmackDown ! roster and on their debut match in April 2005 , Hennigan and Mercury won the WWE Tag Team Championship . In 2005 , Hennigan won five championships ; three WWE Tag Team Championships and two WWE Intercontinental Championships . After MNM split , Hennigan 's ring name changed to John Morrison and he formed a partnership with The Miz in late 2007 , with the two capturing the WWE Tag Team Championship and the World Tag Team Championship on separate occasions , and winning the 2008 Tag Team of the Year Slammy Award . During his tenure with WWE , Hennigan won nine championships . He is a three @-@ time WWE Intercontinental Champion , a record @-@ tying four @-@ time WWE Tag Team Champion ( once with The Miz and three times with Joey Mercury ) , a one @-@ time World Tag Team Champion with The Miz , and a one @-@ time ECW World Champion . 
 In November 2011 , Hennigan left WWE , and began wrestling overseas and on the independent circuit before signing with Lucha Underground in September 2014 . Hennigan won the main event of the debut episode , as well as the first ladder match and steel cage match of Lucha Underground . He also represented Lucha Underground in the 2015 and 2016 Lucha Libre World Cups , winning the latter tournament . He is a one @-@ time Lucha Underground Champion , a one @-@ time Gift of the Gods Champion and one @-@ time Lucha Underground Trios Champion with PJ Black and Jack Evans .

 Before getting into professional wrestling , Hennigan attended the University of California at Davis studying both film and geology . Upon deciding that he did not want to pursue either path , Hennigan began his professional wrestling career training at the Supreme Pro Wrestling school in Sacramento , California . After failing his audition for Tough Enough 2 , he was accepted as a cast member for Tough Enough III in 2002 , eventually becoming the co @-@ winner with Matt Cappotelli . For winning , Hennigan was awarded a WWE developmental contract and assigned to WWE 's developmental territory , Ohio Valley Wrestling ( OVW ) , to continue his training . Hennigan competed in the Acolytes Protection Agency 's invitational Bar Room Brawl match at Vengeance in July 2003 .

 On March 1 , 2004 , Hennigan debuted on the Raw brand under the ring name " Johnny Blaze " . His gimmick was that he was the apprentice and assistant of the Raw General Manager , Eric Bischoff . The next week his name was changed to " Johnny Spade " , and three weeks after that it was changed to " Johnny Nitro " . The Nitro name , which finally stuck , was a reference to WCW Monday Nitro , the flagship show of World Championship Wrestling for which Bischoff had previously worked . To drive the point home , he began using the Nitro theme as his ring entrance music . Nitro acted as Bischoff 's apprentice and assistant until June , when he was sent back to OVW . To explain his departure , Nitro lost a match on June 7 episode of Raw against Eugene , which carried the stipulation that upon his loss , he also lost his job .

 Upon his return to OVW , Nitro was put into a feud with his former partner Matt Cappotelli . During the course of the feud Melina was brought into the company as Nitro 's ex @-@ girlfriend and an ally of Cappotelli , only to turn on him and side with Nitro . Not long after , Nitro and Melina were joined by Joey Mercury , forming the stable MNM . MNM wrestled in OVW for around a year , holding the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship once , before being called up to the main SmackDown ! roster in April 2005 . 
 In their first match for the brand , they won the WWE Tag Team Championship from Rey Mysterio and Eddie Guerrero . MNM held the titles for three months , having successful titles defenses against the teams of Mysterio and Guerrero and Hardcore Holly and Charlie Haas , before dropping them to the Legion of Doom ( LOD ) at The Great American Bash . They won the titles again in a four @-@ way match defeating The Mexicools , William Regal and Paul Burchill , and LOD , but lost them to Mysterio and Batista days before Armageddon in December . Due to help from Mark Henry , MNM defeated Mysterio and Batista in a rematch on December 30 to win the championship for the third time . They began a rivalry with the team of Paul London and Brian Kendrick that lasted over three months , until they dropped the championship to London and Kendrick at Judgment Day in May , with the storyline leading to Nitro and Melina suddenly turning on Mercury after the match , breaking up the group . Later that night , Melina and Nitro were booked off the SmackDown ! brand by having the General Manager , Theodore Long , " fire " them . 
 The next week Nitro , along with Melina , debuted on the Raw brand in a loss to WWE Champion John Cena . Nitro was immediately placed in the WWE Intercontinental Championship picture , beginning his first reign at Vengeance in June defeating champion Shelton Benjamin in a triple threat match also involving Carlito . Nitro held the belt for four months , feuding with several challengers before losing it to Jeff Hardy on October 2 episode of Raw . Nitro then engaged in a feud with Hardy . Nitro recaptured the Intercontinental Championship from Hardy on November 6 when the General Manager for the night , Eric Bischoff , restarted a match that Nitro lost by disqualification . The next week , however , Hardy won the title back . 
 In addition , Nitro was featured in a sporadic feud with John Cena throughout 2006 . The feud was unique in that it also involved non @-@ wrestler Kevin Federline , who appeared on October 16 episode of Raw . Federline was then , in storyline , trained by Nitro for a match with Cena , which he won after interference from Umaga . 
 In November , MNM reunited on an episode of Raw to accept an open challenge from The Hardys ( Jeff and Matt Hardy ) at December to Dismember , a match that they lost . MNM and the Hardys feuded across the brands throughout December , with the feud intensifying after Mercury was legitimately injured at Armageddon in a four @-@ way ladder match . Mercury wrestled Matt on SmackDown ! , while Nitro continued to feud with Jeff for the Intercontinental Championship on Raw , including a steel cage match at New Year 's Revolution . MNM lost to The Hardys at the Royal Rumble , and again at No Way Out in February which ended the feud . MNM continued on and off as a team until Mercury was released from WWE in March 2007 . 
 Without Mercury , Nitro 's association with Melina was played down as she began competing for the WWE Women 's Championship . Nitro was paired up with Kenny Dykstra , until the 2007 WWE Draft , during which Nitro was sent to the ECW brand and Dykstra was sent to SmackDown ! .

 Nitro made his ECW début on June 19 with a win over Nunzio , and few days later , on June 24 , at Vengeance : Night of Champions , he won the vacant ECW World Championship in a match against CM Punk , making it his first World Championship in WWE , when he was called upon to replace the missing Chris Benoit due to a " family emergency " . 
 A few weeks after getting the title , Nitro 's ring name was changed to " John Morrison " and his gimmick was tweaked to be even more conceited and self – aggrandizing — in addition to being modelled after Jim Morrison ( 1943 – 1971 ) , the legendary frontman of the 1960s rock band The Doors , to whom Nitro bears a strong physical resemblance . After defeating CM Punk again at The Great American Bash , he began taking part in a " 15 Minutes of Fame " segment on the weekly ECW on Sci Fi television program , where if a wrestler could either defeat him or last 15 minutes without being defeated , they would earn a title shot . The first wrestler to do so was CM Punk , which set up another match between the two at SummerSlam . Morrison won by illegally using the ring ropes for leverage . The next week , Punk again became the number one contender ; this time , however , Punk won the championship .

 = Hydrochloric acid = 
 Hydrochloric acid is a clear , colorless , highly pungent solution of hydrogen chloride ( HCl ) in water . It is a highly corrosive , strong mineral acid with many industrial uses . Hydrochloric acid is found naturally in gastric acid . When it reacts with an organic base it forms a hydrochloride salt . 
 It was historically called <unk> <unk> , muriatic acid , and spirits of salt because it was produced from rock salt and green vitriol ( by Basilius Valentinus in the 15th century ) and later from the chemically similar common salt and sulfuric acid ( by Johann Rudolph Glauber in the 17th century ) . Free hydrochloric acid was first formally described in the 16th century by Libavius . Later , it was used by chemists such as Glauber , Priestley , and Davy in their scientific research . 
 With major production starting in the Industrial Revolution , hydrochloric acid is used in the chemical industry as a chemical reagent in the large @-@ scale production of vinyl chloride for PVC plastic , and <unk> / TDI for polyurethane . It has numerous smaller @-@ scale applications , including household cleaning , production of gelatin and other food additives , <unk> , and leather processing . About 20 million tonnes of hydrochloric acid are produced worldwide annually . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Hydrochloric acid was known to European alchemists as spirits of salt or <unk> <unk> ( salt acid ) . Both names are still used , especially in other languages , such as German : <unk> , Dutch : <unk> , Swedish : <unk> , Turkish : <unk> <unk> , Polish : <unk> <unk> and Chinese : <unk> . Gaseous HCl was called marine acid air . The old ( pre @-@ systematic ) name muriatic acid has the same origin ( muriatic means " pertaining to brine or salt " , hence <unk> means hydrochloride ) , and this name is still sometimes used . The name hydrochloric acid was coined by the French chemist Joseph Louis Gay @-@ Lussac in 1814 . 
 = = History = = 
 Aqua regia , a mixture consisting of hydrochloric and nitric acids , prepared by dissolving sal <unk> in nitric acid , was described in the works of Pseudo @-@ Geber , a 13th @-@ century European alchemist . Other references suggest that the first mention of aqua regia is in Byzantine manuscripts dating to the end of the 13th century . 
 Free hydrochloric acid was first formally described in the 16th century by Libavius , who prepared it by heating salt in clay crucibles . Other authors claim that pure hydrochloric acid was first discovered by the German Benedictine monk Basil Valentine in the 15th century , when he heated common salt and green vitriol , whereas others argue that there is no clear reference to the preparation of pure hydrochloric acid until the end of the 16th century . 
 In the 17th century , Johann Rudolf Glauber from Karlstadt am Main , Germany used sodium chloride salt and sulfuric acid for the preparation of sodium sulfate in the Mannheim process , releasing hydrogen chloride gas . Joseph Priestley of Leeds , England prepared pure hydrogen chloride in 1772 , and by 1808 Humphry Davy of Penzance , England had proved that the chemical composition included hydrogen and chlorine . 
 During the Industrial Revolution in Europe , demand for alkaline substances increased . A new industrial process developed by Nicolas Leblanc of <unk> , France enabled cheap large @-@ scale production of sodium carbonate ( soda ash ) . In this Leblanc process , common salt is converted to soda ash , using sulfuric acid , limestone , and coal , releasing hydrogen chloride as a by @-@ product . Until the British Alkali Act 1863 and similar legislation in other countries , the excess HCl was vented into the air . After the passage of the act , soda ash producers were obliged to absorb the waste gas in water , producing hydrochloric acid on an industrial scale . 
 In the 20th century , the Leblanc process was effectively replaced by the Solvay process without a hydrochloric acid by @-@ product . Since hydrochloric acid was already fully settled as an important chemical in numerous applications , the commercial interest initiated other production methods , some of which are still used today . After the year 2000 , hydrochloric acid is mostly made by absorbing by @-@ product hydrogen chloride from industrial organic compounds production . 
 Since 1988 , hydrochloric acid has been listed as a Table II precursor under the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances because of its use in the production of heroin , cocaine , and methamphetamine . 
 = = Chemical properties and reactions = = 
 Hydrogen chloride ( HCl ) is a monoprotic acid , which means it can dissociate ( i.e. , ionize ) only once to give up one H + ion ( a single proton ) . In aqueous hydrochloric acid , the H + joins a water molecule to form a hydronium ion , H3O + : 
 HCl + H2O → H3O + + Cl − 
 The other ion formed is Cl − , the chloride ion . Hydrochloric acid can therefore be used to prepare salts called chlorides , such as sodium chloride . Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid , since it is essentially completely dissociated in water . 
 <unk> acids have one acid dissociation constant , Ka , which indicates the level of dissociation in water . For a strong acid like HCl , the Ka is large . Theoretical attempts to assign a Ka to HCl have been made . When chloride salts such as NaCl are added to aqueous HCl , they have practically no effect on pH , indicating that Cl − is an exceedingly weak conjugate base and that HCl is fully dissociated in aqueous solution . For intermediate to concentrated solutions of hydrochloric acid , the assumption that H + molarity ( a unit of concentration ) equals HCl molarity is excellent , agreeing to four significant digits . 
 Of the six common strong mineral acids in chemistry , hydrochloric acid is the monoprotic acid least likely to undergo an interfering oxidation @-@ reduction reaction . It is one of the least hazardous strong acids to handle ; despite its acidity , it consists of the non @-@ reactive and non @-@ toxic chloride ion . Intermediate @-@ strength hydrochloric acid solutions are quite stable upon storage , maintaining their concentrations over time . These attributes , plus the fact that it is available as a pure reagent , make hydrochloric acid an excellent acidifying reagent . 
 Hydrochloric acid is the preferred acid in titration for determining the amount of bases . Strong acid <unk> give more precise results due to a more distinct endpoint . <unk> , or " constant @-@ boiling " , hydrochloric acid ( roughly 20 @.@ 2 % ) can be used as a primary standard in quantitative analysis , although its exact concentration depends on the atmospheric pressure when it is prepared . 
 Hydrochloric acid is frequently used in chemical analysis to prepare ( " digest " ) samples for analysis . Concentrated hydrochloric acid dissolves many metals and forms oxidized metal chlorides and hydrogen gas . It also reacts with basic compounds such as calcium carbonate or copper ( II ) oxide , forming the dissolved chlorides that can be analyzed . 
 = = Physical properties = = 
 Physical properties of hydrochloric acid , such as boiling and melting points , density , and pH , depend on the concentration or molarity of HCl in the aqueous solution . They range from those of water at very low concentrations approaching 0 % HCl to values for fuming hydrochloric acid at over 40 % HCl . 
 Hydrochloric acid as the binary ( two @-@ component ) mixture of HCl and H2O has a constant @-@ boiling <unk> at 20 @.@ 2 % HCl and 108 @.@ 6 ° C ( 227 ° F ) . There are four constant @-@ crystallization eutectic points for hydrochloric acid , between the crystal form of HCl · H2O ( 68 % HCl ) , HCl · 2H2O ( 51 % HCl ) , HCl · 3H2O ( 41 % HCl ) , HCl · 6H2O ( 25 % HCl ) , and ice ( 0 % HCl ) . There is also a metastable eutectic point at 24 @.@ 8 % between ice and the HCl · 3H2O crystallization . 
 = = Production = = 
 Hydrochloric acid is prepared by dissolving hydrogen chloride in water . Hydrogen chloride can be generated in many ways , and thus several precursors to hydrochloric acid exist . The large @-@ scale production of hydrochloric acid is almost always integrated with the industrial scale production of other chemicals . 
 = = = Industrial market = = = 
 Hydrochloric acid is produced in solutions up to 38 % HCl ( concentrated grade ) . Higher concentrations up to just over 40 % are chemically possible , but the evaporation rate is then so high that storage and handling require extra precautions , such as pressurization and cooling . Bulk industrial @-@ grade is therefore 30 % to 35 % , optimized to balance transport efficiency and product loss through evaporation . In the United States , solutions of between 20 % and 32 % are sold as muriatic acid . Solutions for household purposes in the US , mostly cleaning , are typically 10 % to 12 % , with strong recommendations to dilute before use . In the United Kingdom , where it is sold as " Spirits of Salt " for domestic cleaning , the potency is the same as the US industrial grade . 
 Major producers worldwide include Dow Chemical at 2 million metric tons annually ( 2 Mt / year ) , calculated as HCl gas , Georgia Gulf Corporation , <unk> Corporation , <unk> Nobel , and <unk> at 0 @.@ 5 to 1 @.@ 5 Mt / year each . Total world production , for comparison purposes expressed as HCl , is estimated at 20 Mt / year , with 3 Mt / year from direct synthesis , and the rest as secondary product from organic and similar syntheses . By far , most hydrochloric acid is consumed <unk> by the producer . The open world market size is estimated at 5 Mt / year .

 Hydrochloric acid is a strong inorganic acid that is used in many industrial processes such as refining metal . The application often determines the required product quality . 
 = = = Pickling of steel = = = 
 One of the most important applications of hydrochloric acid is in the pickling of steel , to remove rust or iron oxide scale from iron or steel before subsequent processing , such as extrusion , rolling , galvanizing , and other techniques . Technical quality HCl at typically 18 % concentration is the most commonly used pickling agent for the pickling of carbon steel grades . 
 Fe2O3 + Fe + 6 HCl → 3 FeCl2 + 3 H2O 
 The spent acid has long been reused as iron ( II ) chloride ( also known as ferrous chloride ) solutions , but high heavy @-@ metal levels in the pickling liquor have decreased this practice . 
 The steel pickling industry has developed hydrochloric acid regeneration processes , such as the spray roaster or the fluidized bed HCl regeneration process , which allow the recovery of HCl from spent pickling liquor . The most common regeneration process is the <unk> process , applying the following formula : 
 4 FeCl2 + 4 H2O + O2 → 8 HCl + 2 Fe2O3 
 By recuperation of the spent acid , a closed acid loop is established . The iron ( III ) oxide by @-@ product of the regeneration process is valuable , used in a variety of secondary industries . 
 = = = Production of organic compounds = = = 
 Another major use of hydrochloric acid is in the production of organic compounds , such as vinyl chloride and dichloroethane for PVC . This is often captive use , consuming locally produced hydrochloric acid that never actually reaches the open market . Other organic compounds produced with hydrochloric acid include bisphenol A for polycarbonate , activated carbon , and ascorbic acid , as well as numerous pharmaceutical products . 
 2 CH2 = CH2 + 4 HCl + O2 → 2 <unk> + 2 H2O ( dichloroethane by <unk> ) 
 wood + HCl + heat → activated carbon ( chemical activation ) 
 = = = Production of inorganic compounds = = = 
 Numerous products can be produced with hydrochloric acid in normal acid @-@ base reactions , resulting in inorganic compounds . These include water treatment chemicals such as iron ( III ) chloride and <unk> chloride ( PAC ) . 
 Fe2O3 + 6 HCl → 2 FeCl3 + 3 H2O ( iron ( III ) chloride from magnetite ) 
 Both iron ( III ) chloride and PAC are used as flocculation and coagulation agents in sewage treatment , drinking water production , and paper production . 
 Other inorganic compounds produced with hydrochloric acid include road application salt calcium chloride , nickel ( II ) chloride for electroplating , and zinc chloride for the galvanizing industry and battery production . 
 CaCO3 + 2 HCl → CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O ( calcium chloride from limestone ) 
 = = = pH Control and neutralization = = = 
 Hydrochloric acid can be used to regulate the acidity ( pH ) of solutions . 
 OH − + HCl → H2O + Cl − 
 In industry demanding purity ( food , pharmaceutical , drinking water ) , high @-@ quality hydrochloric acid is used to control the pH of process water streams . In less @-@ demanding industry , technical quality hydrochloric acid suffices for neutralizing waste streams and swimming pool pH control . 
 = = = Regeneration of ion exchangers = = = 
 High @-@ quality hydrochloric acid is used in the regeneration of ion exchange resins . <unk> exchange is widely used to remove ions such as Na + and Ca2 + from aqueous solutions , producing demineralized water . The acid is used to rinse the cations from the resins . Na + is replaced with H + and Ca2 + with 2 H + . 
 Ion exchangers and demineralized water are used in all chemical industries , drinking water production , and many food industries . 
 = = = Other = = = 
 Hydrochloric acid is used for a large number of small @-@ scale applications , such as leather processing , purification of common salt , household cleaning , and building construction . Oil production may be stimulated by injecting hydrochloric acid into the rock formation of an oil well , dissolving a portion of the rock , and creating a large @-@ pore structure . Oil well <unk> is a common process in the North Sea oil production industry . 
 Hydrochloric acid has been used for dissolving calcium carbonate , i.e. such things as de @-@ scaling kettles and for cleaning mortar off brickwork , but it is a hazardous liquid which must be used with care . When used on brickwork the reaction with the mortar only continues until the acid has all been converted , producing calcium chloride , carbon dioxide , and water : 
 <unk> + CaCO3 → CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O 
 Many chemical reactions involving hydrochloric acid are applied in the production of food , food ingredients , and food additives . Typical products include aspartame , fructose , citric acid , lysine , hydrolyzed vegetable protein as food enhancer , and in gelatin production . Food @-@ grade ( extra @-@ pure ) hydrochloric acid can be applied when needed for the final product . 
 = = Presence in living organisms = = 
 Gastric acid is one of the main secretions of the stomach . It consists mainly of hydrochloric acid and acidifies the stomach content to a pH of 1 to 2 . 
 Chloride ( Cl − ) and hydrogen ( H + ) ions are secreted separately in the stomach fundus region at the top of the stomach by parietal cells of the gastric mucosa into a secretory network called <unk> before it enters the stomach lumen . 
 Gastric acid acts as a barrier against microorganisms to prevent infections and is important for the digestion of food . Its low pH <unk> proteins and thereby makes them susceptible to degradation by digestive enzymes such as pepsin . The low pH also activates the enzyme precursor <unk> into the active enzyme pepsin by self @-@ cleavage . After leaving the stomach , the hydrochloric acid of the <unk> is neutralized in the duodenum by sodium bicarbonate . 
 The stomach itself is protected from the strong acid by the secretion of a thick mucus layer , and by secretin induced buffering with sodium bicarbonate . Heartburn or peptic ulcers can develop when these mechanisms fail . Drugs of the <unk> and proton pump inhibitor classes can inhibit the production of acid in the stomach , and antacids are used to neutralize existing acid . 
 = = Safety = = 
 Concentrated hydrochloric acid ( fuming hydrochloric acid ) forms acidic mists . Both the mist and the solution have a corrosive effect on human tissue , with the potential to damage respiratory organs , eyes , skin , and intestines irreversibly . Upon mixing hydrochloric acid with common oxidizing chemicals , such as sodium hypochlorite ( bleach , <unk> ) or potassium permanganate ( KMnO4 ) , the toxic gas chlorine is produced . 
 <unk> + 2 HCl → H2O + NaCl + Cl2 
 2 KMnO4 + 16 HCl → 2 <unk> + 8 H2O + 2 KCl + 5 Cl2 
 <unk> + 4 HCl → 2 H2O + <unk> + Cl2 
 Personal protective equipment such as latex gloves , protective eye goggles , and chemical @-@ resistant clothing and shoes will minimize risks when handling hydrochloric acid . The United States Environmental Protection Agency rates and regulates hydrochloric acid as a toxic substance . 
 The UN number or DOT number is 1789 . This number will be displayed on a placard on the container . 
 = Billy Butlin = 
 Sir William Heygate Edmund Colborne " Billy " Butlin ( 29 September 1899 – 12 June 1980 ) was a British , South Africa @-@ born entrepreneur whose name is synonymous with the British holiday camp . Although holiday camps such as Warner 's existed in one form or another before Butlin opened his first in 1936 , it was Butlin who turned holiday camps into a multimillion @-@ pound industry and an important aspect of British culture . 
 Born in Cape Town , South Africa , to William and Bertha Butlin , Butlin had a turbulent childhood . His parents separated before he was seven , and he returned to England with his mother . He spent the next five years following his grandmother 's family fair around the country where his mother sold gingerbread ; exposing the young Butlin to the skills of commerce and entertainment . When he was twelve his mother emigrated to Canada , leaving him in the care of his aunt for two years . Once settled in Toronto , his mother invited him to join her there . 
 In Canada Butlin struggled to fit in at school and soon left for a job in a Toronto department store Eatons . In the First World War he enlisted as a bugler in the Canadian Army . After the war , Butlin returned to England , bringing only £ 5 with him . Investing £ 4 of that money to hire a stall travelling with his uncle 's fair , Butlin discovered that giving his customers a better chance to win brought more custom in , and he quickly became successful . One stall became several , including prominent locations such as Olympia in London , and Butlin soon was able to purchase other fairground equipment , and started his own travelling fair . He proved successful in this endeavour as well , and by 1927 he opened a static fairground in Skegness . Over the next 10 years Butlin expanded his fairground empire , all the time harbouring an idea to increase the number of patrons in his Skegness site by providing accommodation . 
 Butlin 's first holiday camp opened at Skegness in 1936 , followed by Clacton , two years later . Plans to open a third in Filey were cut short by the outbreak of the Second World War . Butlin used the war to his advantage , persuading the MoD to complete the Filey Holiday Camp and construct two more camps in Ayr and Pwllheli as training camps which he reclaimed when the war was over . In the post @-@ war boom , Butlin opened four more camps at Mosney , Bognor Regis , Minehead and Barry Island as well as buying hotels in Blackpool , Saltdean , and Cliftonville . By the time he retired in 1968 , Butlin had allowed hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers a self @-@ contained vacation with a variety of entertainment . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Butlin was born in the Cape Colony ( part of modern @-@ day South Africa ) . His father , William Colborne Butlin ( born June 1867 ) , was the son of a clergyman ; his mother , Bertha Cassandra Hill ( born March 1878 ) , was a member of a family of travelling showmen . They met at a young age when Bertha 's parents were working a country fair that William attended and in December 1896 they were married . Their marriage was considered not socially acceptable in Leonard Stanley , Gloucestershire , where they lived , and they emigrated to South Africa . William founded a bicycle shop to try to keep the family , and they had two children , Butlin and his brother Harry John ( known as Binkie ) Butlin . When the marriage failed , Butlin ’ s mother returned to England with her children and rejoined her own family in <unk> , near Bristol . Within a short time Harry contracted polio , and he died in March 1907 . For a time Butlin joined his mother in travelling around the fair circuit 
 In his autobiography , Butlin recorded that his mother remarried and emigrated to Canada around 1910 and passenger lists of the period show Bertha travelling to Toronto via Montreal in 1912 . For two years Butlin , and his cousin Jimmy Hill boarded with a widow in Bristol . In December 1913 his mother returned and married Charles <unk> in Swindon . Butlin 's mother and stepfather then asked him to join them in Toronto , Canada . He was unhappy at school in Canada , mocked because of his English accent , and he left school at fourteen . Eventually he got a job as a messenger boy at Eatons , Toronto ’ s largest department store . One of the best aspects of working for the company was that he was able to visit their summer camp , which gave him his first taste of a real holiday , indeed a taste of what was to become a very big part of his life . Later he transferred to Eatons advertising department where he drew black and white adverts , while studying at night school twice a week . 
 In 1915 , during World War I , Butlin volunteered somewhat reluctantly for service in the Canadian Army . Knowing that the army already had a full quota of despatch riders , Butlin intended to volunteer for service in that category in the knowledge that although his application would be declined he would still receive an " I volunteered " badge for his actions without actually having to serve . While applying , Butlin forgot to tell the recruiter of this intention , and was consequently allocated to the Canadian Expeditionary Force which was taking part in the fighting along the Western Front . He was subsequently posted to the 170th ( Mississauga Horse ) Battalion on 29 December 1915 . His attestation papers give his date of birth as 1898 ( rather than the actual 1899 ) , allowing him to enlist although only 15 at the time . The papers give his occupation as a " Suit Case Maker " . The papers also show , as Butlin himself later stated , that he had been selected to serve as a bugler . Before his deployment to Europe , Butlin transferred to the 216th ( Bantams ) Battalion , with which he was sent to England . Once in England , he was stationed at Sandgate near Folkestone before being deployed to France . In France , the 216th became part of the 3rd Canadian Division which took part in the second battle of Vimy Ridge , as well the battles at Ypres and Arras , and the second battle of Cambrai ; while in France , Butlin served as a stretcher @-@ bearer . 
 After the war , Butlin returned to England aboard a cattle ship , arriving in England with only £ 5 ( 2011 : £ 189 @.@ 00 ) capital . He made his way to Tiverton in Devon where his uncle , Marshall Hill , was a well known showman . He purchased a hoopla stall from Hill , and ran it successfully . In later interviews Butlin claimed that he accidentally sawed the corners off his hoopla blocks , but some observers such as The Sunday Herald report that he did it intentionally , displaying " logic and business sense " . In either case , Butlin 's actions allowed patrons to have a much higher success rate ( approximately 3 in 5 for each ring ) and brought him more custom than his fellow stall holders . By contrast an average game would have odds of approximately 1 in 9 for each ring or 1 in 3 for a 3 @-@ ring game . Butlin 's stall gave him less profit per customer than his competitors , but the increase in business gave him a bigger overall profit than theirs . He moved to London and set up a successful stall in Olympia outside the Christmas Circus run by Bertram Mills . By the end of the season Butlin had been so successful that he could afford to bring his mother ( by then widowed ) to the UK from Canada .

 = = = <unk> and amusement parks = = = 
 Over the next few years Butlin toured the country with the Hills Travelling Fair , leaving his mother to run the Olympia site . Soon he had his own travelling fair visiting country fairs such as Barnstaple . Butlin opened some permanently sited stalls in 1925 , in Barry Island , Wales . In 1927 he leased a piece of land from the Earl of Scarbrough in the seaside town of Skegness . On this land , he set up an amusement park with hoopla stalls , a tower slide , a haunted house , and a scenic railway . In 1928 , Butlin secured an exclusive licence to sell Dodgem cars in Europe . The first Dodgems in Britain were available in his park at Skegness ; other showmen bought Dodgems from Butlin . His activities in Skegness continued to expand , and by 1930 included a zoo featuring lions , zebras and an African village . 
 Butlin opened a similar fairground in 1932 , in Bognor Regis , on the corner of the Esplanade , named the Recreation Shelter . The following year he opened a zoo nearby , which featured polar bears , kangaroos and monkeys . At around the same time he also opened an amusement park in Bognor 's neighbouring village of Littlehampton , known as Butlin 's Park . 
 In the 1930s Butlin had amusement parks in <unk> ( opened 1928 ) , Hayling Island ( 1931 ) , Felixstowe ( 1931 ) , Southsea ( 1931 ) and on the Isle of Man . He continued to operate his winter fair at Olympia during this time and soon added the winter fairs at Waverley Hall in Edinburgh and at the Kelvin Hall in Glasgow . By 1935 most of his existing parks had zoos attached to them , providing another source of revenue . 
 Butlin 's funfair and amusement park business continued to expand into the post @-@ war period . In 1938 he gained the sole contract to supply amusements to the Empire Exhibition in Glasgow and after the war , he continued to open amusement parks such as the one at Sheerness . 
 = = = First holiday camps = = = 
 For some time Butlin had nurtured the idea of a holiday camp . He had seen the way landladies in seaside resorts would , sometimes literally , push families out of the lodgings between meals , regardless of the weather . Butlin toyed with the idea of providing holiday accommodation that encouraged holiday @-@ makers to stay on the site and even provided entertainment for them between meals . 
 He opened his first Butlin 's camp at Ingoldmells , near Skegness , on 11 April 1936 ( Easter eve ) . It was officially opened by Amy Johnson , the first woman to fly solo from England to Australia . An advertisement costing £ 500 ( 2011 : £ 28 thousand ) was placed in the Daily Express , announced the opening of the camp , inviting the public to book for a week 's holiday . The advertisement offered holidays with three meals a day and free entertainment with a week 's full board cost anything from 35 shillings to £ 3 ( 2011 : £ 167 @.@ 00 ) , according to the time of year . When the camp opened , Butlin realised that his guests were not engaging with activities in the way he had planned ; most kept to themselves , and others looked bored . He asked Norman Bradford ( who was engaged as an engineer constructing the camp ) to take on the duty of entertaining the guests , which he did with a series of ice breakers and jokes . By the end of the night the camp was buzzing and the Butlin 's atmosphere was born . From that point on , entertainment was the very heart of Butlins and Bradford became the first of the Butlin 's Redcoats . The same night Butlin decided that for his camp to work he would require many more people to carry out the same job as Bradford , and the role of Redcoat was conceived . 
 In his autobiography , Butlin refers to Clacton as his second camp ; however , in 1937 , the architect Harold Ridley Hooper , who had drawn the plans for the camp at Skegness , created plans on behalf of Butlins ltd , for a second camp at Dovercourt , in Essex . In the winter of 1938 , the camp at Dovercourt was requisitioned by the government for housing children evacuated from Germany by the <unk> programme . Writers and speakers discussing that programme , such as Anthony Grenville and Ela <unk> , claim that the camp had been constructed by Butlin and operated as a Butlin 's camp for the 1937 – 1938 season , <unk> also suggests that it had closed in the summer of 1938 ( the same time the Clacton camp opened . ) recollections of the refugees suggest that by December 1938 the camp was being run by Harry Warner , whose company Butlin was on the board of . At around the same time Butlin 's advertised Dovercourt as " associated with Butlin 's " and into the early 1940s Butlin was putting on rail packages with LNER to the Dovercourt camp . 
 Butlin proposed a new holiday camp at Clacton @-@ on @-@ Sea in Essex in 1936 . Both the council and the local association of hotels were against the idea , as were the boarding house keepers . To persuade them , Butlin took the members of the council to Skegness to see how the people there appreciated their holiday camp . The councillors were soon won over when they learnt that the local traders in Skegness had seen an initial dip in custom after its construction followed by a rise as campers had visited the town and seasonal workers had come to spend their pay . Once approved by the council , construction began and the camp opened in 1938 . 
 On 30 January 1937 , Butlin turned his business into a limited company " Butlin 's ltd " . Butlin took the decision to form the company as a means to raise finance for his new camps . On 8 February 1937 the company published its prospectus ahead of a public sale of shares . When the shares became available , they sold out entirely in five minutes . 
 = = World War II years = = 
 With the outbreak of the Second World War , both the Clacton and Skegness camps were requisitioned by the War Office for use as training camps . The ministry needed further camps , and contracted Butlin to build them . Butlin agreed , on the condition that he could purchase the sites when the war was over , to use as holiday camps . The ministry agreed , and Filey ( 1945 ) , Pwllheli and Ayr ( both in 1947 ) , opened after the war . As Butlin was dealing with other sites , he asked his business competitor , Harry Warner , to complete the construction of Filey . Butlin had purchased his first hotel in 1939 , the Thatched Barn in Borehamwood , Hertfordshire . Like his camps , it was requisitioned ( this time by the SOE ) before he could develop it . 
 During the war years , a number of Butlin 's camps were used as Royal Navy shore establishments . Skegness became HMS Royal Arthur , a training establishment for petty officers ; Pwllheli became HMS Glendower , and Ayr became HMS Scotia . Filey became RAF <unk> Moor and Clacton , after being considered for use as a prisoner of war camp , was later used as a training site for the Pioneer Corps . Butlin was recruited by the Ministry of Supply and asked to look at the causes of low morale amongst the workers in Britain 's munitions factories . His first stop was at the Royal Ordnance Factory , Chorley , where he found that the camouflaged huts and barbed wire fences used to house workers gave them the feeling of being interned . Using the knowledge and experience he had gained in setting up his holiday camps , Butlin was able to devise activities and systems to boost morale , which led to his appointment as Director General of Hostels . In this position , Butlin introduced games and entertainment similar to those used in his holiday camps . These included : whist drives , amateur dramatics , theatrical productions and cinema . In 1943 , he encouraged workers to continue taking their holiday entitlement but to do so at home , arranging various travelling fairs to visit towns on their " holiday week " . Butlin 's appointment to this role gave cause for concern in some quarters , with questions being asked of the under @-@ secretary , Harold Macmillan , about the nature of his involvement . However the appointment was a voluntary one with no salary or expenses and had been made after the consideration of other suitable candidates . 
 Late in the war , during the Allied advance through western Europe following the Normandy landings , Butlin was approached by General Bernard Montgomery , who asked him to help set up leave centres for the 21st Army Group . Starting in Brussels , the " 21 Club " concept quickly spread through western Europe , providing entertainment and relaxation for servicemen and women . 
 In 1944 , Butlin was awarded the MBE for his wartime service to the Ministry of Supply . 
 = = Post war expansion = = 
 After the war , it became apparent that most holiday camps in Britain had been damaged by troop occupation , and the situation was so bad that questions were raised in parliament . Other than Clacton , the Butlins camps were relatively unscathed , and even Clacton , which had been damaged by troop occupation , re @-@ opened in early 1946 . In the post @-@ war boom Butlin saw opportunities on foreign shores . He opened camps at Mosney , in the soon to be Republic of Ireland , in 1948 and on Grand Bahama , in 1949 . 
 In most ways Mosney was identical to the existing successful camps , but in Ireland this was something that was seen to be feared , rather than embraced . A number of complaints appeared in the Catholic Standard , warning that holiday camps were an English idea that was not desirable in Catholic Ireland . Like the other camps , Mosney was designed to have a church and reassurances were given that it would be a Catholic chapel with a resident priest . <unk> were also given that Irish nationals would have priority over British tourists in booking holidays . In July 1948 the camp was finally opened by William Norton , the Minister for Social Welfare , and it operated successfully as a Butlin 's camp until the early 1980s . 
 A more ambitious plan by Butlin was thought up on a trip to the Bahamas in 1946 . Seeing potential for a camp in warmer climes , he formed a company under the chairmanship of Sir Bede Edmund Hugh Clifford and bought land in Grand Bahama . Butlin also purchased the Princess hotel in Bermuda and the Fort Montagu beach hotel in Nassau . The camp was intended to be complete and open on New Years Day of 1950 . After an investment of US $ 5 million ( 2011 : £ 28 @.@ 9 million ) the camp opened , still only partially complete , in the winter of 1949 . To celebrate its opening , Butlin ran a mystery flight , where guests , who had paid $ 129 ( 2011 : £ 746 @.@ 73 ) each , were taken on a flight to the resort without being informed in advance . However Butlin did not remain celebrating for long ; he required a further $ 2 @.@ 25 million ( 2011 : £ 14 @.@ 5 million ) to complete the camp , and to make matters worse American tourists were not used to the holiday camp mentality so the venture held little interest . In an attempt to save the camp , Butlin sold the Hotel leases to an American firm . By November 1950 , the subsidiary company handling the Caribbean resort was ordered to be wound up by a court . Butlin admitted defeat and focused his efforts back in Europe . In the late 1940s Butlin had successfully opened hotels outside the Skegness and Ayr camps , so he now saw his opportunity to expand into this market . Butlin began acquiring hotels in Saltdean , Blackpool and Cliftonville . 
 = = Further camps = = 
 In the 1960s Butlin began to create a series of new camps at Bognor Regis ( opened 1960 ) , Minehead ( 1962 ) and Barry Island ( 1966 ) . Barry Island remained part of the Butlin 's empire until the 1980s , while Bognor and Minehead remain part of the company today . 
 On 2 July 1960 Butlin planned to open his holiday camp at Bognor , but because of flooding it was not ready . Butlin offered his patrons the chance to be re @-@ sited at Clacton or to stay and help complete the camp 's construction . A number opted to stay and help , and received a free bottle of champagne as a reward . Once opened , the camp quickly became popular , accommodating around 5 @,@ 000 campers and another 5 @,@ 000 day visitors . 
 In the winter of 1961 , Butlin began work on his camp in Minehead . The site opened to the public on 26 May 1962 having cost £ 2 million to construct . Over the next decade several attractions were added to the site ; a miniature railway was added in 1964 , chairlifts in 1965 , and a monorail in 1967 . 
 Butlin 's inspiration for his holiday empire had come from a holiday to Barry Island in his twenties , when he had been locked out of his B & B all day by his landlady . He finally decided to build the last and smallest of the camps there in 1965 . Butlin took out a 99 @-@ year lease on the headland at Nell 's Point , Barry Island , in 1966 . Building work began there in the winter and the gates opened to campers on 18 June 1966 . Butlin retired in 1969 and the Barry Island camp was the last opening under his management . 
 = = Later life = = 
 Growing up , Butlin had lived with his aunt Jessie in the Swan Pub in <unk> , in his later life he was able to purchase desirable property for himself ; for many years living on The Bishops Avenue . His house there was Dane Court in Hampstead , which he purchased in 1947 . Butlin sold Dane Court in 1951 , and moved to a property in Grosvenor Square . He remained in this property through the 1950s and 1960s . 
 Butlin retired in 1969 , handing over running the company to his son Bobby . A hostile takeover bid by Phonographic Equipment in November 1969 made him decide to come out of retirement , in the capacity of " consultant " . With his father 's help Bobby fended off the takeover , and Butlin returned to his retirement . In 1972 , the Rank Organisation launched a friendly takeover for £ 43 million ( 2011 : £ 466 million ) , which both Butlin and his son agreed to accept . 
 Butlin 's retirement was forced by circumstance . His accountant informed Butlin that the total rate of income tax and surtax that Butlin was due to pay for the coming year was 115 % of his income . Butlin took the decision to move from his London home to become a permanent resident in Blair Adam House , St. John , on the island of Jersey , in the Channel Islands . This move was financially beneficial since Jersey had a fixed 20 % rate of income tax . He remained a resident of Jersey until his death on 12 June 1980 , aged 80 . He is buried in the parish of St John and his grave is shaped to represent a double bed . 
 Butlin actively engaged in charity work through the Grand Order of Water Rats and through the Variety Club . In 1963 , he set up the Bill Butlin charitable trust , and in 1966 donated £ 100 @,@ 000 ( 2011 : £ 1 @.@ 53 million ) to set up a trust to help in cases where police officers were incapacitated or fatally injured while on active duty . With public support the fund grew firstly to £ 250 @,@ 000 and eventually to over £ 1 million . In return he received many honours , from having a Hybrid Tea Rose name after him , to his knighthood in 1964 . In being knighted , Butlin was following in the footsteps of his great uncle Sir Henry Trentham Butlin , an eminent surgeon . In 1960 , Butlin was awarded the Carl Alan award for his services to dance . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Butlin remained close to his mother , both in following her to Canada and in arranging for her to come home after the death of his stepfather . She died in 1934 and never saw his first holiday camp . By contrast , Butlin makes no mention in his biography of his father after returning from Canada . Public records from South Africa show that his father remained in Cape Town for the rest of his life , dying in 1954 . 
 In the 1920s while staying in Tiverton in Devon , and working with Marshall Hill , Butlin met Doris " Dolly " Mabel Cheriton ( born 1898 ) , whose family owned the local fish and chip shop ; the couple were married in 1927 . Dolly gave her name as " Dorothy " on signing the register , and her death in 1958 was also registered in the name " Dorothy " . However , by the early 1930s the marriage had broken down and they had separated . Soon after , Butlin met and fell in love with Norah Faith Cheriton ( Dolly 's niece , born 1914 ) . Dolly refused to grant Butlin a divorce . It was not until Dolly 's death in 1958 that he and Norah were free to marry . Butlin was surprised by Eamonn Andrews for This Is Your Life on his wedding day in 1959 . The second marriage lasted only a few months , as Butlin had already fallen in love with Sheila Edwina Devine . This time it was Norah who refused to grant divorce . In 1975 , with divorce law having changed , Butlin was able to divorce Norah and marry Sheila with whom he remained until his death . 
 Butlin had several children from his three marriages : Shirley ( born 1931 to Dolly ) , Robert ( born to Nora in 1934 as Robert F. Reeves ) , Cherie ( also known as Cherry , born to Nora in 1939 ) , Sandra ( born 1941 ) , William Jr ( also known as Billy , born 1960 to Sheila ) , and Jacquie ( born to Sheila ) . Bertha Hill 's obituary records " William , Dolly and baby Shirley " and on Shirley 's fifth birthday the local Skegness newspaper noted that she invited many of her friends to her father 's holiday camp for her party .

 = Meteorological history of Hurricane Gordon ( 1994 ) = 
 The meteorological history of Hurricane Gordon consisted of a thirteen @-@ day period in which the storm 's path was erratic , persistent , and highly unusual . The hurricane formed near Panama in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on November 9 , 1994 . As a tropical depression it brushed Nicaragua and spent several days in the waters off the country 's coast . Strengthening slightly into a tropical storm , Gordon wound its way north into the Greater Antilles . Despite warm waters , persistent wind shear prevented significant strengthening . Executing a slow turn to the north and then the northwest , Gordon made two more landfalls , on eastern Jamaica and eastern Cuba , while delivering tremendous rains to western Hispaniola . 
 As Tropical Storm Gordon made its fourth landfall crossing the Florida Keys , it interacted with a cyclone in the upper @-@ troposphere and a series of cyclonic lows which lent the storm some sub @-@ tropical characteristics . After a few days as an unusual hybrid of a tropical and a subtropical system in the Gulf of Mexico , the storm re @-@ claimed its fully tropical form and made yet another landfall , this time across the Florida peninsula , and continued into the Atlantic Ocean . In the Atlantic , Gordon rapidly strengthened to a Category 1 Hurricane . Gordon 's characteristic wandering briefly brought it near North Carolina , but ultimately the storm headed south , weakening into a minor tropical storm before making its sixth and final landfall on Florida 's east coast . 
 Hurricane Gordon was the seventh named storm and third hurricane of the 1994 Atlantic hurricane season . Although it never made landfall as a hurricane , in its meandering course the storm included six separate landfalls : four as a tropical storm and two as a tropical depression . Three of its landfalls were in the U.S. state of Florida . 
 = = Formation = = 
 During the first week of November a large area of disturbed weather accumulated just north of Panama over the southwestern Caribbean Sea . A tropical wave passed through the area and gave it mild convection . A second wave passed through the area on November 6 and introduced cyclonic circulation to the disturbance . Over the next two days the system gradually organized and sparked a deep convection off Nicaragua 's southeast coast . This organization , with initial maximum sustained winds of 30 mph ( 45 km / h ) , was designated Tropical Depression Twelve . Moving northwest , the storm began to slowly strengthen and its upper level outflow became favorable to further development . Spots of convection flared on the morning of November 9 ; banding features appeared as its center made landfall on the northeastern Nicaraguan coast near Puerto Cabezas . A full day later a trough to the storm 's northwest over the Gulf of Mexico moved the depression offshore , to the northeast , and over the warm waters of the western Caribbean Sea . Fueled by these warm waters , on the night of November 9 it strengthened into Tropical Storm Gordon with 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) winds . 
 Lacking firm movement because of weak steering currents , Gordon meandered north @-@ northeast in the presence of mild west @-@ southwesterly wind shear , unable to strengthen under the adverse conditions . By November 11 , a trough prodded Gordon to the north @-@ northeast at 8 mph ( 13 km / h ) , and it strengthened by 6 mph ( 9 km / h ) as it moved through the central Caribbean Sea . The trough continued steering Gordon , bending it eastward towards Jamaica on the afternoon on November 12 . Despite the warm waters , Gordon did not strengthen that day as strong upper @-@ tropospheric shear hindered development , disorganized the upper level circulation , and reduced its winds to 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) . 
 = = Through the Greater Antilles = = 
 November 13 was an active day for Tropical Storm Gordon . The trough over southern Florida and the Gulf of Mexico continued to push Gordon eastward towards Jamaica . In the pre @-@ dawn hours the storm clipped the eastern edge of the island , leaving 7 @.@ 44 in ( 18 @.@ 9 cm ) of rainfall . Southwesterly wind shear kept the storm from developing beyond 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) , but neither the shear nor the landfall significantly disrupted the cyclone 's organization . Accelerating , Gordon turned towards the northeast . Continued shear prevented the upper @-@ level development needed for typical cyclonic organization , but a strong lower level circulation had formed . Its sustained winds were still only 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) , but as the system approached eastern Cuba a gust of 120 mph ( 192 km / h ) was reported . The center crossed near Guantánamo Bay and the storm dumped heavy rainfall as it passed over the eastern portion of the island ; even heavier rain fell in Haiti to the west , where 22 @.@ 94 in ( 58 @.@ 27 cm ) of rain was recorded at Camp @-@ Perrin . 
 Meanwhile , the broad @-@ scale circulation that was covering most of the Caribbean Sea ( of which Tropical Storm Gordon was only a part ) was interacting with an upper @-@ tropospheric trough near the Straits of Florida . This trough strengthened the broad upper @-@ level cyclone , which in turn strengthened Gordon and spawned several other low @-@ level circulations in the western Caribbean Sea . When Gordon crossed eastern Cuba , the National Hurricane Center determined that it had become the most dominant of these low level systems and had absorbed their <unk> . ( Meteorologist Jose Fernandez @-@ Partagas voiced the minority opinion that Gordon 's circulatory center had dissipated over Cuba and that a low pressure system near the Bahamas was now the dominant system , which would have meant the demise of Tropical Storm Gordon and the emergence of a new tropical storm . While possible , this view was not accepted by the official hurricane summaries . ) By nightfall of November 13 , Gordon had not only made two landfalls and survived interactions with three competing systems but also , in assimilating the Bahamian low , had gained the cool central core typical of a subtropical cyclone . 
 The deep @-@ layered cyclone within which Gordon was embedded steered the storm west @-@ northwest , south of Turks and Caicos and the Bahamas , on November 14 . A large ridge of high pressure near the U.S. Mid @-@ Atlantic coast increased the pressure gradient around the storm , so although its sub @-@ tropical elements ( namely a lack of deep convection ) precluded a core of strong winds immediately around the storm 's nucleus , strong winds were supported outside the storm 's circulatory center . These winds inched up to 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) , but did not strengthen any further . The ridge continued to steer the hybrid Tropical / Subtropical Storm Gordon west @-@ northwestward past the western Bahamas . This brought the southern portion of the storm 's circulation over northern Cuba , while the strengthening northern circulation produced 60 mph ( 90 km / h ) winds near Palm Beach . The storm 's fourth landfall occurred on November 15 when Gordon passed over the Florida Keys near Key West , Florida . The storm then continued west over the lower Keys and into the Straights of Florida , where the storm 's center began to warm and deep convection signaled the return of Gordon 's purely tropical characteristics . 
 = = Second Florida landfall and peak strength = = 
 Steering currents remained weak giving the storm a chance to fully re @-@ develop its deep convection while immobile at sea . During this time , Tropical Storm Gordon began to spawn tornadoes . As the storm center was well offshore most were probably unreported , but six tornadoes touched down on the Florida coast . Four of the tornadoes were rated F0 on the Fujita scale , two were rated F1 , and one was given an F2 rating with estimated wind speeds of 113 – 157 mph ( 181 – 253 km / h ) . 
 After stalling offshore for almost a day , a mid- to upper @-@ tropospheric trough over the central U.S. slowly pulled Tropical Storm Gordon northward then north @-@ northeastward towards Florida 's west coast . The storm made landfall between Ft . Myers and Naples with 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) winds . The eastward component of the storm 's movement increased , and Gordon moved northeastward onto the Florida Peninsula at 10 mph ( 17 km / h ) . The storm barely weakened as it crossed the landmass keeping its 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) winds . Crossing the peninsula in a mere six hours , the storm continued to pick up speed . Early on November 17 , back over the open ocean , the storm 's central pressure began to fall . Improved organization was not apparent and wind shear was pulling at the core of the deep convection when , on November 17 , Gordon suddenly spawned 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) winds and was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane . 
 = = Third Florida landfall and demise = = 
 The shortwave trough that had been steering Gordon across Florida moved ahead of the storm and its influence was replaced by a mid @-@ tropospheric ridge over the eastern United States . Under the influence of this new ridge the storm , which had been speeding northeast at 25 mph ( 40 km / h ) , turned to the north late on November 17 . The hurricane 's loop continued , and as it moved to a west @-@ northwesterly heading Gordon briefly threatened North Carolina 's Outer Banks before stalling offshore once again . In the presence of weak steering currents once again , Gordon lost strength and slipped back to tropical storm status with 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) winds . On November 18 , about 90 mi ( 150 km ) off the Outer Banks , Gordon began a southward drift away from the North Carolina coast . In its brush with the Mid @-@ Atlantic States , Gordon dropped 2 – 5 in ( 5 – 13 cm ) with a maximum of 5 @.@ 25 in ( 13 @.@ 3 cm ) recorded at Norfolk , Virginia . Warm waters improved its organization , but this did not result in stronger winds and the storm continued to weaken . Strong upper @-@ level winds battered the storm from the northwest . They sheared away Gordon 's upper @-@ level convection while polluting the storm with colder and dryer air that weakened its lower level convection . 
 A high pressure system over the central United States drifted east and added a westward component to Gordon 's southward motion , pulling the storm southwest towards Florida . The persistent shear and a continued lack of deep convection eventually reduced the storm 's winds to below tropical storm force , and on the morning on November 20 Gordon became a tropical depression . The high pressure system over the continent continued pulling the depression towards the west until it made its final landfall near Cape Canaveral that night with winds of 30 mph ( 45 km / h ) . Between its three Floridian landfalls , Hurricane Gordon dumped 5 – 10 in ( 13 – 25 cm ) of rain on Florida , with a station at Cooperstown recording 16 @.@ 1 in ( 40 @.@ 9 cm ) . The storm moved northward across Florida , northeastward across Georgia , and finally merged with a frontal system over South Carolina . 
 = = = Track and forecasting = = = 
 Gordon 's track was likened to Hurricane Dawn in 1972 . The National Hurricane Center described the storm as " a complex system , [ which ] followed an unusual , erratic path over the western Caribbean Sea and islands , Florida and the southwestern Atlantic . " Due to the path , the agency had difficulties in forecasting Gordon , and the forecast errors were 10 % to 30 % above the average of the previous decade . 
 = Operation Ladbroke = 
 Operation Ladbroke was a glider landing by British airborne troops during the Second World War near Syracuse , Sicily , that began on 9 July 1943 as part of Operation Husky , the Allied invasion of Sicily . The first Allied mission using large numbers of the aircraft , the operation was carried out from Tunisia by glider infantry of the British 1st Airlanding Brigade , commanded by Brigadier Philip Hicks , with a force of 136 Wacos and eight Horsas . The objective was to establish a large invasion force on the ground near the town of Syracuse , secure the Ponte Grande Bridge and ultimately take control of the city itself with its strategically vital docks , as a prelude to the full @-@ scale invasion of Sicily . 
 En route to Sicily , sixty @-@ five gliders released too early by the American and British towing aircraft crashed into the sea , drowning approximately 252 men . Of the remainder , only eighty @-@ seven men arrived at the Pont Grande Bridge , although they successfully captured the bridge and held it beyond the time they were to be relieved . Finally , with their ammunition expended and only fifteen soldiers remaining unwounded , the Allied troops surrendered to Italian forces . The Italians , having gained control of the bridge , sought to destroy the structure , but were frustrated by troopers of the 1st Airlanding Brigade who had removed the previously attached explosive charges . Other troops from the brigade , who had landed elsewhere in Sicily , aided further by destroying communications links and capturing gun batteries . 
 = = Background = = 
 By December 1942 , with Allied forces advancing through Tunisia , the North African Campaign was coming to a close ; with victory there imminent , discussions began among the Allies regarding the nature of their next objective . Many Americans argued for an immediate invasion of Northern France , while the British , as well as General Dwight David Eisenhower , argued that the island of Sardinia was the best subsequent target of the Allied troops . In January 1943 the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt settled at the Casablanca Conference on the island of Sicily , whose invasion and occupation could potentially provide the Allies with Mediterranean shipping routes and airfields nearer to mainland Italy and Germany . The codename Operation Husky was decided upon for the Allied invasion of Sicily , and planning for Husky began in February . Initially the British Eighth Army , under the command of General Bernard Law Montgomery , were to land on the south @-@ eastern corner of the island and advance north to the port of Syracuse . Two days later the U.S. Seventh Army , commanded by Lieutenant General George Patton , would land on the western corner of the island and move towards the port of Palermo . 
 In March it was decided that the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division , under Major General Matthew Bunker Ridgway , and the British 1st Airborne Division , under Major @-@ General George Frederick Hopkinson , would be dropped by parachute and glider just prior to the amphibious landings ; they would land a few miles behind the beaches and neutralize their defenders , thereby aiding the landing of the Allied ground forces . However , in early May these directives were radically changed at the insistence of General Montgomery ; he argued that with Allied forces landing separately at either end of the island , the defending Axis forces would have the opportunity to defeat each Allied Army in turn before both could unite . Instead , the plans were altered to land both the Eighth and Seventh Armies simultaneously along a 100 miles ( 160 km ) stretch of coastline on Sicily 's south @-@ eastern corner . At the same time , the plans for the two airborne divisions were also adjusted ; Montgomery believed that the airborne troops should be landed near Syracuse , so that they could seize the valuable port . The commander of the 82nd Airborne Artillery , Brigadier General Maxwell D. Taylor , further asserted that dropping behind the island 's beaches and overcoming its defences was not a suitable mission for the airborne troops , as they were only lightly armed and vulnerable to the ' friendly fire ' of the planned Allied naval bombardment . In the revised blueprint for the airborne divisions , a reinforced regimental combat team ( the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment , under Colonel James Maurice Gavin ) from the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division would be dropped by parachute north @-@ east of the port of Gela to block the movement of Axis reserves towards the Allied beachheads . The British 1st Airborne Division was now to conduct three brigade @-@ size airborne operations : the Ponte Grande road bridge south of Syracuse was to be captured by the 1st Airlanding Brigade , under Brigadier Philip Hicks , the port of Augusta was to be seized by Brigadier Ernest E. Down 's 2nd Parachute Brigade , and finally the Primasole Bridge over the River Simeto was to be taken and secured by Brigadier Gerald Lathbury 's 1st Parachute Brigade . 
 = = Planning = = 
 As there were insufficient transport aircraft for all three brigades to conduct their operations simultaneously , it was decided that the first operation would be Ladbroke , whose objective was the capture of the Ponte Grande Bridge . The mission , under the command of Brigadier Philip Hicks , was conducted just prior to the amphibious landings , on the night of 9 July , while the remaining two operations took place on successive two nights . The 1st Airlanding Brigade was also given the additional tasks of capturing Syracuse harbour and the urban area that adjoined it , and either destroying or confiscating a coastal artillery battery that was in range of the amphibious landings . When training began for the operation , difficulties immediately arose . The original plan for the airborne operations had called for all three to employ parachutists , but in May Montgomery altered the plan ; after determining that airborne troops would be at a considerable distance from Allied ground forces , he believed that the force sent to capture Syracuse would be served best by gliders in order to provide them with the maximum possible amount of firepower . His airborne advisor , Group Captain Cooper of the Royal Air Force , argued that a glider landing conducted at night with inexperienced aircrews was not practical , but the decision was left unchanged . 
 Montgomery 's orders raised several issues , the first with the transport aircraft of the Troop Carrier Wings assigned to the airborne operations . When they had arrived in North Africa , it had been decided that the 52nd Troop Carrier Wing would operate with 1st Airborne Division and its counterpart , the 51st , with 82nd Airborne Division . A few weeks later this arrangement was switched , with the 52nd now operating with 82nd Airborne Division and the 51st with 1st Airborne Division ; this seemed a logical decision , as each Wing had operational experience with the division it had been paired with . However , the decision to turn the Syracuse assault into a glider @-@ based one was problematic ; the 51st had practically no glider experience , whilst the 52nd had much more but was already training for a parachute @-@ based mission . To switch both was impractical and would have led to a number of problems , which left 1st Airborne Division , and thus 1st Airlanding Brigade , with an inexperienced Troop Carrier Wing . 
 = = = Glider problems = = = 
 Further problems were encountered with the gliders to be used in the operation , and the glider pilots themselves . Until a few months prior to the operation , there was a notable shortage of serviceable gliders in North Africa . In late March a small number of Wacos arrived at Accra on the Gold Coast , but pilots sent to ferry them to North Africa found that they were in poor condition . Due to neglect and the deleterious effects of tropical weather , the pilots were able to assemble only a small number of Wacos and fly them back on 22 April . On 23 April , a larger number of the American gliders began to arrive in North African ports , but were not immediately available for use as the crates holding them were unloaded haphazardly , instructions were often found to be missing , and those men assigned to assemble the gliders were often inexperienced . However , when the decision was made to conduct a glider @-@ borne assault with 1st Airlanding Brigade , assembly was improved , and by 12 June 346 gliders had been put together and delivered to the Troop Carrier Wings . A small number of Horsa gliders were transported to North Africa for use by the brigade . Thirty took off from England and undertook a trip of approximately 1 @,@ 500 miles ( 2 @,@ 400 km ) in Operation Turkey Buzzard . After attacks from Luftwaffe fighter patrols and experiencing often turbulent weather , a total of 27 Horsas were delivered to North Africa in time for the operation . 
 When sufficient gliders had arrived in North Africa , however , they were not all usable even in training ; on 16 June , most of the gliders were grounded for repairs , and on 30 June , large numbers of them had developed weaknesses in their tail @-@ wiring , necessitating another grounding period of three days . Given these problems and delays , 51st Troop Carrier Wing was not able to conduct a large @-@ scale glider exercise until mid @-@ June . On 14 June , fifty @-@ four Wacos were flown over 70 miles ( 110 km ) and then released to land at an airfield , and a larger exercise was conducted on 20 June ; but even these limited exercises were unrealistic , as they were conducted in broad daylight . The British glider pilots themselves also caused difficulties ; although there were a sufficient number of them to conduct the operation , they were highly inexperienced . Detached from the Glider Pilot Regiment for the operation , they had no experience with the Waco gliders and night operations involving them , as British doctrine had deemed such operations impossible . On average , the pilots had eight hours of flight experience in gliders . Few were rated as being ' operationally ready ' and none had combat experience . Colonel George Chatterton , the commander of the Glider Pilot Regiment , had protested their participation as he believed they were entirely unfit for any operation . When the training period for the brigade ended with a total of two exercises completed , the glider pilots had an average of 4 @.@ 5 hours training in flying the unfamiliar Waco , which included an average of 1 @.@ 2 hours night flying . 
 = = = 1st Airlanding Brigade = = = 
 The units of the 1st Airlanding Brigade were : the 1st Battalion , Border Regiment ; 2nd Battalion , South Staffordshire Regiment ; 181st ( Airlanding ) Field Ambulance and 9th Field Company , Royal Engineers . The Staffords were tasked with securing the bridge and the area to the south , while the Borders were to capture Syracuse . For the mission the 1st Airlanding Brigade were allocated 136 Waco and eight Horsa gliders . With the shortage of space in the gliders - Wacos could only accommodate fifteen troops , half that of the Horsa , thus the whole brigade could not be deployed . Six of the Horsas carrying ' A ' and ' C ' companies from the Staffords were scheduled to land at the bridge at 23 : 15 on 9 July in a coup @-@ de @-@ main operation . The remainder of the brigade would arrive at 01 : 15 on 10 July using a number of landing @-@ zones between 1 @.@ 5 and 3 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 and 4 @.@ 8 km ) away , then converge on the bridge to reinforce the defence . 
 = = = Italian forces = = = 
 The Ponte Grande Bridge was immediately outside the area defended by the Italian 206 Coastal Division , which would oppose the British seaborne landing . The fortress commander was Rear Admiral Primo Leonardi , with Colonel Mario Damiani in command of the army contingent . The Augusta @-@ Syracuse Naval Fortress Area , which included the Coastal Division , was protected by six medium and six heavy coastal artillery batteries , with eleven additional dual @-@ purpose coastal and anti @-@ aircraft batteries , with six batteries only of anti @-@ aircraft guns . Finally the Fortress contained an armoured train with four 120 mm guns . The army contingent was the 121st Coastal Defence Regiment , which included four battalions . There were also naval and air force battalions available , while the 54 Infantry Division Napoli was in a position to send reinforcements if required . 
 = = Mission = = 
 On 9 July 1943 , a contingent of 2 @,@ 075 British troops , along with seven jeeps , six anti @-@ tank guns and ten mortars , boarded their gliders in Tunisia and took off at 18 : 00 , bound for Sicily . In the hours that preceded the landing , twelve Boeing B @-@ 17 and six Vickers Wellington equipped with radar jamming devices flew back and forth along the coast in the Siracusa @-@ Licata sector ; between 21 : 00 and 21 : 30 , 55 Wellingtons of 205th Group carried out a diversionary bombing of the port and airport of Syracuse , causing a number of civilian and military casualties , including the commander of the Italian naval base , Commander Giuseppe <unk> . 280 puppets dressed in paratrooper uniforms were launched north of the landing area , in order to deceive the Italian defense . En route , the gliders encountered strong winds , poor visibility and at times were subjected to anti @-@ aircraft fire . To avoid gunfire and searchlights , pilots of the towing aircraft climbed higher or took evasive action . In the confusion surrounding these manoeuvres , some gliders were released too early and sixty @-@ five of them crashed into the sea , drowning around 252 men . Of the remainder , only twelve landed in the right place . Another fifty @-@ nine landed up to 25 miles ( 40 km ) away while the remainder were either shot down or failed to release and returned to Tunisia . About 200 American paratroopers , having been mistakenly parachuted in the area assigned to the Eighth Army , were captured by the Italian 146th Coastal Regiment ( 206th Coastal Division ) in the early hours of 10 July . 
 Only one Horsa with a platoon of infantry from the Staffords landed near the bridge . Its commander , Lieutenant Withers , divided his men into two groups , one of which swam across the river and took up position on the opposite bank . Thereafter the bridge was captured following a simultaneous assault from both sides . The Italian defenders from the 120th Coastal Infantry Regiment abandoned their pillboxes on the north bank . 
 The British platoon then dismantled some demolition charges that had been fitted to the bridge and dug @-@ in to wait for reinforcement or relief . Another Horsa landed roughly 200 yards ( 180 m ) from the bridge but exploded on landing , killing all on board . Three of the other Horsas carrying the coup @-@ de @-@ main party landed within 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) of the bridge — their occupants eventually finding their way to the site . Reinforcements began to arrive at the bridge , but by 06 : 30 they numbered only eighty @-@ seven men . 
 Elsewhere , about 150 men landed at Cape Murro di Porco and captured a radio station . Based on a warning of imminent glider landings transmitted by the station 's previous occupants , the local Italian commander ordered a counter @-@ attack but his troops failed to receive his message . The scattered nature of the landings now worked in the Allies ' favour as they were able to cut all telephone wires in the immediate area . The glider carrying the brigade deputy commander , Colonel O. L. Jones , landed beside an Italian coastal artillery battery ; at daylight the staff officers and radio operators attacked and destroyed the battery 's five guns and their ammunition dump . Other isolated groups of Allied soldiers tried to aid their comrades , assaulting Italian defences and targeting reinforcements . Another attack by a group of <unk> on three 149 / 35 mm Italian coastal batteries failed , and the batteries were able to open fire on Allied landing craft and troops at 6 : 15 on 10 July . At 9 : 15 , the 1st Battalion of the Italian 75th Infantry Regiment ( " Napoli " Division ) captured another 160 American paratroopers on the <unk> <unk> @-@ Syracuse road . Another group of paratroopers attacked an Italian patrol led by Major Paoli , commander of the 126th Artillery Group ; Paoli was killed and his unit fell in disarray , and was thus unable to intervene in the later fight against British tanks near the bridge . 
 The first counterattack on the bridge was by two companies of Italian sailors , who were repulsed by the British . As the Italians responded to the Allied landings , they gathered more troops and brought up artillery and mortars to bombard the Allied @-@ controlled Pont Grande Bridge . The British defenders came under attack from the Italians while the expected British 5th Infantry Division relief did not appear at 10 : 00 as planned . At 11 : 30 the Italian 385th Coastal Battalion arrived at the bridge , followed soon afterward by the 1st Battalion , 75th ( Napoli ) Infantry Regiment . The Italians were positioned to attack the bridge from three sides . By 14 : 45 there were only fifteen British troops defending the bridge that had not been killed or wounded ( four officers and eleven soldiers ) . At 15 : 30 , with their ammunition consumed , the British stopped fighting . Some men on the south side of the bridge escaped into the countryside , but the rest became prisoners of war . With the bridge back in Italian hands , the first unit from 5th Infantry Division , the 2nd Battalion , Royal Scots Fusiliers , of 17th Infantry Brigade , arrived at the bridge at 16 : 15 and mounted a successful counter @-@ attack , which had been made possible by the prior removal of demolition charges from the bridge , preventing its destruction by the Italians . The 1st Battalion of the 75th Infantry Regiment , having no artillery , was unable to oppose the British tanks and had to retreat after suffering heavy losses . The survivors from the 1st Airlanding Brigade took no further part in the fighting and were withdrawn back to North Africa on 13 July . During the landings , the losses by 1st Airlanding Brigade were the most severe of all British units involved . The casualties amounted to 313 killed and 174 missing or wounded . Fourteen accompanying glider pilots were killed , and eighty @-@ seven were missing or wounded . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 After an enquiry into the problems with the airborne missions in Sicily , the British Army and Royal Air Force submitted recommendations in the aftermath of Operation Ladbroke . Aircrew were to be trained in parachute and glider operations , and pathfinders were to be landed before the main force , to set out their beacons . The landing plan was simplified with complete brigades landing on a drop zone , instead of the smaller battalion landing areas used on Sicily . Gliders were no longer released at night while still over water , and their landing zones would be large enough to accommodate the aircraft with room to spare . Following a friendly fire incident over an Allied convoy , more training was given to ship 's crews in aircraft recognition ; Allied aircraft were also painted with three large white stripes . Training for pilots of the Glider Pilot Regiment was increased , and improvements to the gliders were implemented , including better inter @-@ aircraft communication . To provide another method of delivering jeeps and artillery by air , the Royal Air Force started experimenting with how to use parachutes to drop them into combat , the jeeps and guns being carried in aircraft 's bomb bays . A second Royal Air Force transport group , No. 46 , was formed and equipped solely with C @-@ 47 Dakotas , instead of the mixture of aircraft in No. 38 Group . Together , the Royal Air Force groups were capable of supplying eighty @-@ eight <unk> , eighty @-@ eight Stirlings , thirty @-@ six Halifaxes and 150 Dakotas , a total of 362 planes which did not include aircraft held as reserves . 
 = Crystal Palace Dinosaurs = 
 The Crystal Palace Dinosaurs , also known as Dinosaur Court , are a series of sculptures of extinct animals ( including dinosaurs ) and mammals in Crystal Palace Park , now in the London borough of Bromley . Commissioned in 1852 to accompany the Crystal Palace after its move from the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park and unveiled in 1854 , they were the first dinosaur sculptures in the world , pre @-@ dating the publication of Charles Darwin 's On the Origin of Species by six years . While to varying degrees inaccurate by modern standards , the models were designed and sculpted by Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins under the scientific direction of Sir Richard Owen , representing the latest scientific knowledge at the time . The models were classed as Grade II listed buildings from 1973 , extensively restored in 2002 , and upgraded to Grade I listed in 2007 . 
 The models represent fifteen genera of extinct animals , not all dinosaurs . They are from a wide range of geological ages , and include true dinosaurs , ichthyosaurs , and plesiosaurs mainly from the Mesozoic era , and some mammals from the more recent Cenozoic era . 
 = = History = = 
 Following the closure of the Great Exhibition in October 1851 , Joseph Paxton 's Crystal Palace was bought and moved to Penge Place atop Sydenham Hill , South London by the newly formed Crystal Palace Company . The grounds that surrounded it were then extensively renovated and turned into a public park with ornamental gardens , replicas of statues and two new man @-@ made lakes . As part of this renovation , Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins was commissioned to build the first @-@ ever life @-@ sized models of extinct animals . He had originally planned to just re @-@ create extinct mammals before deciding on building dinosaurs as well , which he did with advice from Sir Richard Owen , a celebrated biologist and palaeontologist of the time . Hawkins set up a workshop on site at the park and built the models there . The models were displayed on three islands acting as a rough timeline , the first island for the Paleozoic era , a second for the Mesozoic , and a third for the Cenozoic . The models were given more realism by making the water level in the lake rise and fall , revealing different amounts of the dinosaurs . To mark the launch of the models , Hawkins held a dinner on New Year 's Eve 1853 inside the mould of one of the Iguanodon models . 
 Hawkins benefited greatly from the public 's reaction to the dinosaurs , which was so strong it allowed for the sale of sets of small versions of the dinosaur models , priced at £ 30 for educational use . But the building of the models was costly ( having cost around £ 13 @,@ 729 ) and in 1855 , the Crystal Palace Company cut Hawkins 's funding . Several planned models were never made , while those half finished were scrapped , despite protest from sources including the Sunday newspaper , The Observer . 
 With progress in palaeontology , the reputation of the models declined . In 1895 , the American fossil hunter Othniel Charles Marsh scorned the dinosaurs ' friends as doing them a great injustice , and spoke angrily of the models . The models and the park fell into disrepair as the years went by , a process aided by the fire that destroyed the Crystal Palace itself in 1936 , and the models became obscured by overgrown foliage . A full restoration of the animals was carried out in 1952 by Victor H.C. Martin , at which time the mammals on the third island were moved to less well @-@ protected locations in the park , where they were exposed to wear and tear . The limestone cliff was blown up in the 1960s . 
 In 2002 , the display was totally renovated . The destroyed limestone cliff was completely replaced using 130 large blocks of Derbyshire limestone , many weighing over 1 tonne ( 0 @.@ 98 long tons ; 1 @.@ 1 short tons ) , rebuilt according to a small model made from the same number of polystyrene blocks . <unk> replacements were created for the missing sculptures , and badly damaged parts of the surviving models were recast . For example , some of the animals ' legs had been modelled in lead , fixed to the bodies with iron rods ; the iron had rusted , splitting the lead open . 
 The models and other elements of Crystal Palace Park were classed as Grade II listed buildings from 1973 . The models were extensively restored in 2002 , and upgraded to Grade I listed in 2007 . 
 = = The Dinosaur Park = = 
 Fifteen genera of extinct animals , not all dinosaurs , are represented in the park . At least three other genera ( Dinornis , a mastodon , and Glyptodon ) were planned , and Hawkins began to build at least the mastodon before the Crystal Palace Company cut his funding in 1855 . An inaccurate map of the time shows planned locations of the Dinornis and mastodon .
