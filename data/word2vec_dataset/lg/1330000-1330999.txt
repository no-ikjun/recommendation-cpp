 The Chief Minister is elected by the Members of the Legislative Assembly ( MLA ) and selects colleagues to serve as ministers alongside him or her in the Executive , known informally as the cabinet . Whereas the ACT has federally been dominated by Labor , the Liberals have been able to gain some footing in the ACT Legislative Assembly , and were in government for just over eight of the Assembly 's 25 @-@ year history , mostly during a period of six and half years from 1995 and 2001 , when Labor won power . At the 2004 election the Australian Labor Party , headed by then Chief Minister Jon Stanhope , won nine of the 17 seats and formed the ACT 's first majority government , but after the 2008 election was forced into minority government with the Greens . 
 As almost all of the ACT 's population lives in Canberra , political trends for both areas are closely aligned . The ACT was given its first federal parliamentary representation in 1949 , when it gained a seat in the House of Representatives , the Division of Australian Capital Territory . The ACT member could only vote on matters directly affecting the territory . In 1974 , the ACT was allocated two Senate seats . In 1974 , the House of Representatives seat was divided into two . A third was created in 1996 , but was abolished in 1998 because of changes to the regional demographic distribution . 
 Both House of Representatives seats have mostly been held by Labor , usually by comfortable margins . The Labor Party has polled at least seven percentage points more than the Liberal Party at every federal election since 1990 , and their average lead since then has been 15 percentage points . The ALP and the Liberal Party have always held one Senate seat each . 
 The Australian federal government retains some influence over the ACT government . In the administrative sphere , most frequently this is through the actions of the National Capital Authority which is responsible for planning and development in areas of Canberra which are considered to be of national importance or which are central to Griffin 's plan for the city , such as the Parliamentary Triangle , Lake Burley Griffin , major approach and processional roads , areas where the Commonwealth retains ownership of the land or undeveloped hills and ridge @-@ lines ( which form part of the Canberra Nature Park ) . The national government also retains a level of control over the Territory Assembly through the provisions of the Australian Capital Territory ( Self @-@ Government ) Act 1988 . This federal act defines the legislative power of the ACT assembly . 
 The Australian Federal Police ( AFP ) provides all of the constabulary services in the territory in a manner similar to state police forces , under a contractual agreement with the ACT Government . The AFP does so through its community policing arm , ACT Policing ( Australian Capital Territory Police ) . 
 People who have been charged with offences are tried either in the ACT Magistrates Court or for more severe offences , the ACT Supreme Court . Prior to its closure in 2009 , prisoners were held in remand at the Belconnen Remand Centre in the ACT but usually gaoled in New South Wales . The Alexander <unk> Centre was officially opened on 11 September 2008 by then Chief Minister Jon Stanhope . The total cost for construction was $ 130 million . Courts such as a Small Claims Tribunal and a Family Court exist for civil law actions and other non @-@ criminal legal matters . 
 = = Economy = = 
 In May 2012 , the unemployment rate in Canberra was 3 @.@ 4 % which was lower than the national unemployment rate of 5 @.@ 1 % . As a result of low unemployment and substantial levels of public sector and commercial employment , Canberra has the highest average level of disposable income of any Australian capital city . The gross average weekly wage in Canberra is $ 1702 compared with the national average of $ 1485 @.@ 80 ( May 2013 ) . 
 The median house price in Canberra as of September 2009 was $ 511 @,@ 820 , lower than only Sydney among capital cities of more than 100 @,@ 000 people , having surpassed Melbourne and Perth since 2005 . The median weekly rent paid by Canberra residents is higher than rents in all other states and territories . As at January 2014 the median unit rent in Canberra was $ 410 per week and median housing rent was $ 460 , making the city the third most expensive in the country . Factors contributing to this higher weekly rental market include ; higher average weekly incomes , restricted land supply , and inflationary clauses in the ACT Residential <unk> Act . 
 The city 's main industry is public administration and safety , which accounted for 29 @.@ 8 % of Gross Territory Product in 2011 – 12 and employed 33 @.@ 9 % of Canberra 's workforce . The headquarters of many Australian Public Service agencies are located in Canberra , and Canberra is also host to several Australian Defence Force establishments , most notably the Australian Defence Force headquarters and HMAS Harman , which is a naval communications centre that is being converted into a tri @-@ service , multi @-@ user depot . 
 The former RAAF Fairbairn , adjacent to the Canberra Airport was sold to the operators of the airport , but the base continues to be used for RAAF VIP flights . A growing number of software vendors have based themselves in Canberra , to capitalise on the concentration of government customers ; these include Tower Software and <unk> . A consortium of private and government investors is currently making plans for a billion @-@ dollar data hub , with the aim of making Canberra a leading centre of such activity in the Asia @-@ Pacific region . 
 = = Sustainability and environment = = 
 The average <unk> was responsible for 13 @.@ 7 tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2005 . In 2012 the ACT Government legislated greenhouse gas targets to reduce its emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020 , 80 per cent by 2050 , with no net emissions by 2060 . The government announced in 2013 a target for 90 % of electricity consumed in the ACT to be supplied from renewable sources by 2020 . 
 In 1996 Canberra became the first city in the world to set a vision of no waste , proposing an ambitious target of 2010 for completion . The strategy aimed to achieve a waste @-@ free society by 2010 , through the combined efforts of industry , government and community . By early 2010 , it was apparent that though it had reduced waste going to landfill , the ACT initiative 's original 2010 target for absolutely zero landfill waste would be delayed or revised . 
 Plastic bags made of polyethylene polymer with a thickness of less than 35 µm were banned from retail distribution in the ACT from November 2011 . The ban was introduced by the ACT Government in an effort to make Canberra more sustainable . 
 Of all waste produced in the ACT , 75 per cent is recycled . Average household food waste in the ACT remains above the Australian average , costing an average $ 641 per household per annum . 
 Canberra 's annual <unk> festival features a large display of flowers every Spring in Commonwealth Park . The organisers of the event have a strong environmental standpoint , promoting and using green energy , " green catering " , sustainable paper , the conservation and saving of water .

 As at census night in August 2011 , the population of Canberra was 355 @,@ 596 , up from 323 @,@ 056 people in 2006 . The 2011 census showed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 1 @.@ 4 % of ACT 's population , while 28 @.@ 6 % of the population were born overseas . The largest group of people born overseas came from the United Kingdom ( 3 @.@ 7 % ) and then China ( 1 @.@ 8 % ) . 
 Significant numbers of immigrants have also come from New Zealand , India and Vietnam . Recent immigrants have arrived from countries in East and South Asia . Most locals only speak English at home ( 77 @.@ 8 % ) ; other languages spoken at home include Mandarin , Italian , Vietnamese , Cantonese and Spanish . 
 Canberrans are relatively young , highly mobile , and well educated . The median age is 34 years , and only 10 @.@ 7 % of the population is aged over 65 years . Between 1996 and 2001 , 61 @.@ 9 % of the population either moved to or from Canberra , which was the second highest mobility rate of any Australian capital city . According to statistics collected by the National Australia Bank and reported in The Canberra Times , Canberrans on average give significantly more money to charity than Australians in other states and territories , for both dollar giving and as a proportion of income . 
 As at May 2013 , 45 % of ACT residents ( 25 – 64 ) had a level of educational attainment equal to at least a bachelor 's degree , significantly higher that the national average of 29 % . On census night in 2011 , approximately 44 % of ACT residents described themselves as Christian , the most common denominations being Catholic and Anglican ; 29 % described themselves as having no religion . 
 As of 2012 the most common crimes in the ACT are property related crimes , unlawful entry with intent and motor vehicle theft .

 The two main tertiary institutions are the Australian National University ( ANU ) in Acton and the University of Canberra ( UC ) in Bruce , with over 10 @,@ 500 and 8 @,@ 000 full @-@ time @-@ equivalent students respectively . Established in 1946 , the ANU has always had a strong research focus and is ranked among the leading universities in the world and the best in Australia by The Times Higher Education Supplement and the Shanghai Jiao Tong World University Rankings . There are two religious university campuses in Canberra : <unk> in the northern suburb of Watson is a campus of the Australian Catholic University ; St Mark 's Theological College in Barton is part of the secular Charles Sturt University . 
 The Australian Defence Force Academy ( ADFA ) and the Royal Military College , Duntroon are located in the inner @-@ northern suburb of Campbell . ADFA teaches military undergraduates and postgraduates and includes UNSW @ ADFA , a campus of the University of New South Wales ; Duntroon provides Australian Army officer training . Tertiary level vocational education is also available through the multi @-@ campus Canberra Institute of Technology . 
 In February 2004 there were 140 schools in Canberra ; 96 were operated by the government and 44 were private . During 2006 , the ACT Government announced closures of up to 39 schools , to take effect from the end of the school year , and after a series of consultations unveiled its Towards 2020 : Renewing Our Schools policy . As a result , some schools closed during the 2006 – 08 period , while others were merged ; the creation of combined primary and secondary government schools will proceed over the next decade . The new policy has provoked significant opposition . Most suburbs are planned to include a primary and a nearby preschool ; these are usually located near open areas where recreational and sporting activities are easily available . Canberra also has the highest percentage of non @-@ government ( private ) school students in Australia , accounting for 40 @.@ 6 per cent of ACT enrollments . 
 = = Arts and entertainment = = 
 Canberra is home to many national monuments and institutions such as the Australian War Memorial , the National Gallery of Australia , the National Portrait Gallery , the National Library , the National Archives , the Australian Academy of Science , the National Film and Sound Archive and the National Museum . Many Commonwealth government buildings in Canberra are open to the public , including Parliament House , the High Court and the Royal Australian Mint . 
 Lake Burley Griffin is the site of the Captain James Cook Memorial and the National Carillon . Other sites of interest include the Black Mountain Tower , the Australian National Botanic Gardens , the National Zoo and Aquarium , the National Dinosaur Museum and Questacon – the National Science and Technology Centre . 
 The Canberra Museum and Gallery in the city is a repository of local history and art , housing a permanent collection and visiting exhibitions . Several historic homes are open to the public : Lanyon and Tuggeranong <unk> in the Tuggeranong Valley , Mugga @-@ Mugga in <unk> , and <unk> ' Cottage in Parkes all display the lifestyle of the early European settlers . Calthorpes ' House in Red Hill is a well @-@ preserved example of a 1920s house from Canberra 's very early days . Canberra has many venues for live music and theatre : the Canberra Theatre and Playhouse which hosts many major concerts and productions ; and Llewellyn Hall ( within the ANU School of Music ) , a world @-@ class concert hall are two of the most notable . The Street Theatre is a venue with less mainstream offerings . The Albert Hall was the city 's first performing arts venue , opened in 1928 . It was the original performance venue for theatre groups such as the Canberra Repertory Society . 
 <unk> was a large annual festival , for some years one of the biggest festivals in Canberra . It was downsized and rebranded as Stone Day in 2012 . There are numerous bars and nightclubs which also offer live entertainment , particularly concentrated in the areas of Dickson , Kingston and the city . Most town centres have facilities for a community theatre and a cinema , and they all have a library . Popular cultural events include the National Folk Festival , the Royal Canberra Show , the <unk> car festival , Enlighten festival , the National Multicultural Festival in February and the Celebrate Canberra festival held over 10 days in March in conjunction with Canberra Day . 
 Canberra maintains sister @-@ city relationships with both Nara , Japan and Beijing , China . Canberra has friendship @-@ city relationships with both Dili , East Timor and Hangzhou , China . City @-@ to @-@ city relationships encourage communities and special interest groups both locally and abroad to engage in a wide range of exchange activities . The Canberra Nara Candle Festival held annually in spring , is a community celebration of the Canberra Nara Sister City relationship . The festival is held in Canberra Nara Park on the shores of Lake Burley Griffin . 
 = = Media = = 
 As Australia 's capital , Canberra is the most important centre for much of Australia 's political reportage and thus all the major media , including the Australian Broadcasting Corporation , the commercial television networks , and the metropolitan newspapers maintain local bureaus . News organisations are represented in the " press gallery " , a group of journalists who report on the national parliament . The National Press Club of Australia in Barton has regular television broadcasts of its lunches at which a prominent guest , typically a politician or other public figure , delivers a speech followed by a question @-@ and @-@ answer session .

 Canberra has a daily newspaper , The Canberra Times , which was established in 1926 . There are also several free weekly publications , including news magazines CityNews and Canberra Weekly as well as entertainment guide BMA Magazine . BMA Magazine first went to print in 1992 ; the inaugural edition featured coverage of the Nirvana Nevermind tour .

 Pay television services are available from Foxtel ( via satellite ) and telecommunications company TransACT ( via cable ) . 
 = = Sport = = 
 In addition to local sporting leagues , Canberra has a number of sporting teams that compete in national and international competitions . The best known teams are the Canberra Raiders and the Brumbies who play rugby league and rugby union respectively ; both have been champions of their leagues . Both teams play their home games at Canberra Stadium , which is the city 's largest stadium and was used to hold group matches in soccer for the 2000 Summer Olympics and in rugby union for the 2003 Rugby World Cup . The city also has a successful basketball team , the Canberra Capitals , which has won seven out of the last eleven national women 's basketball titles . Canberra United FC represents the city in the W @-@ League , the national women 's association football league , and were champions in the 2011 – 12 season . The Canberra Vikings represent the city in the National Rugby Championship and finished second in the 2015 season . 
 There are also teams that participate in national competitions in netball , field hockey , ice hockey , cricket and baseball . Manuka Oval is another large outdoor sporting facility where cricket and Australian Rules football are played . 
 Expansion AFL club Greater Western Sydney Giants commenced a partnership with Canberra in 2012 will play three home games at Manuka Oval each season until at least 2021 . Prior to this the Melbourne @-@ based AFL team the Kangaroos played some home games at Manuka Oval until July 2006 . Following the move of the Kangaroos ' alternative home ground to Carrara in Queensland , Melbourne and the Western Bulldogs played some home games at Manuka Oval from 2007 against the Sydney Swans . Canberra is also home to the Barassi International Australian Football Youth Tournament . The historic Prime Minister 's XI cricket match is played at Manuka Oval annually . Other significant annual sporting events include the Canberra Marathon and the City of Canberra Half Ironman Triathlon . 
 The Australian Institute of Sport ( AIS ) is located in the Canberra suburb of Bruce . The AIS is a specialised educational and training institution providing coaching for elite junior and senior athletes in a number of sports . The AIS has been operating since 1981 and has achieved significant success in producing elite athletes , both local and international . The majority of Australia 's team members and medallists at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney were AIS graduates . 
 Canberra has numerous sporting ovals , golf courses , skate parks , and swimming pools that are open to the public . Tennis courts include those at the National Sports Club , Lyneham , former home of the Canberra Women 's Tennis Classic . A Canberra @-@ wide series of bicycle paths are available to cyclists for recreational and sporting purposes . Canberra Nature Parks have a large range of walking paths , horse and mountain bike trails . Water sports like sailing , rowing , dragon boating and water skiing are held on Canberra 's lakes . The Rally of Canberra is an annual motor sport event and a facility for drag racing is currently being planned for construction .

 Canberra has two large public hospitals , the approximately 600 @-@ bed Canberra Hospital — formerly the Woden Valley Hospital — in Garran and the 174 @-@ bed Calvary Public Hospital in Bruce . Both are teaching institutions . The largest private hospital is the Calvary John James Hospital in Deakin . Calvary Private Hospital in Bruce and <unk> 's National Capital Private Hospital in Garran are also major healthcare providers . 
 The Royal Canberra Hospital was located on Acton Peninsula on Lake Burley Griffin ; it was closed in 1991 and was demolished in 1997 in a controversial and fatal implosion to facilitate construction of the National Museum of Australia . The city has 10 aged care facilities . Canberra 's hospitals receive emergency cases from throughout southern New South Wales , and ACT Ambulance Service is one of four operational agencies of the ACT Emergency Services Authority . NETS provides a dedicated ambulance service for inter @-@ hospital transport of sick newborns within the ACT and into surrounding New South Wales . 
 = = = Transport = = = 
 The automobile is by far the dominant form of transport in Canberra . The city is laid out so that arterial roads connecting inhabited clusters run through undeveloped areas of open land or forest , which results in a low population density ; this also means that idle land is available for the development of future transport corridors if necessary without the need to build tunnels or acquire developed residential land . In contrast , other capital cities in Australia have substantially less green space . 
 Canberra 's districts are generally connected by parkways — limited access dual carriageway roads with speed limits generally set at a maximum of 100 km / h ( 62 mph ) . An example is the Tuggeranong Parkway which links Canberra 's CBD and Tuggeranong , and bypasses Weston Creek . In most districts , discrete residential suburbs are bounded by main arterial roads with only a few residential linking in , to deter non @-@ local traffic from cutting through areas of housing . 
 In an effort to improve road safety , traffic cameras were first introduced to Canberra by the Carnell Government in 1999 . The traffic cameras installed in Canberra include fixed red @-@ light and speed cameras and point @-@ to @-@ point speed cameras ; together they bring in revenue of approximately $ 11 million per year in fines . 
 ACTION , the government @-@ operated bus service , provides public transport throughout the city . Deane 's Transit Group provides bus services between Canberra and nearby areas of New South Wales through their <unk> Express ( <unk> and Yass ) and Deane 's <unk> ( Queanbeyan ) brands . A light rail line is proposed to link the CBD with the northern district of Gungahlin . In the 2011 census , 6 @.@ 7 % of the journeys to work involved public transport ; with 6 @.@ 5 % walking or cycling to work . 
 There are two local taxi companies . Aerial Capital Group enjoyed monopoly status until the arrival of <unk> in 2007 . In October 2015 the ACT Government passed legislation to regulate ride sharing , allowing ride share services including Uber to operate legally in Canberra . The ACT Government was the first jurisdiction in Australia to enact legislation to regulate the service . 
 An interstate NSW TrainLink railway service connects Canberra to Sydney . Canberra 's railway station is in the inner south suburb of Kingston . Between 1920 and 1922 the train line crossed the Molonglo River and ran as far north as the city centre , although the line was closed following major flooding and was never rebuilt , while plans for a line to Yass were abandoned . A 3 ft 6 in ( 1 @,@ 067 mm ) gauge construction railway was built in 1923 between the Yarralumla brickworks and the provisional Parliament House ; it was later extended to Civic , but the whole line was closed in May 1927 . Train services to Melbourne are provided by way of a NSW TrainLink bus service which connects with a rail service between Sydney and Melbourne in Yass , about a one @-@ hour drive from Canberra . 
 Plans to establish a high @-@ speed rail service between Melbourne , Canberra and Sydney , have not been implemented , as the various proposals have been deemed economically unviable . The original plans for Canberra included proposals for railed transport within the city , however none eventuated . The phase 2 report of the most recent proposal , the High Speed Rail Study , was published by the Department of Infrastructure and Transport on 11 April 2013 . A railway connecting Canberra to Jervis Bay was also planned but never constructed . 
 Canberra is about three hours by road from Sydney on the Federal Highway ( National Highway 23 ) , which connects with the Hume Highway ( National Highway 31 ) near Goulburn , and seven hours by road from Melbourne on the Barton Highway ( National Highway 25 ) , which joins the Hume Highway at Yass . It is a two @-@ hour drive on the Monaro Highway ( National Highway 23 ) to the ski fields of the Snowy Mountains and the Kosciuszko National Park . Batemans Bay , a popular holiday spot on the New South Wales coast , is also two hours away via the Kings Highway . 
 Canberra Airport provides direct domestic services to Sydney , Melbourne , Brisbane , Adelaide , Gold Coast and Perth , with connections to other domestic centres . There are direct daily flights to Albury and Newcastle in New South Wales . No regular commercial international flights operate from the airport . Canberra Airport is , as of September 2013 , designated by the Australian Government Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development as a restricted use designated international airport . Until 2003 the civilian airport shared runways with RAAF Base Fairbairn . In June of that year , the Air Force base was decommissioned and from that time the airport was fully under civilian control . 
 Canberra has one of the highest rates of active travel of all Australian major cities , with 7 @.@ 1 per cent of commuters walking or cycling to work in 2011 . An ACT Government survey conducted in late 2010 found that Canberrans walk an average of 26 minutes each day . According to The Canberra Times in March 2014 , Canberra 's cyclists are involved in an average of four reported collisions every week . The newspaper also reported that Canberra is home to 87 @,@ 000 cyclists , translating to the highest cycling participation rate in Australia ; and , with higher popularity , bike injury rates in 2012 were twice the national average . 
 = = = Utilities = = = 
 The government @-@ owned ACTEW Corporation manages Canberra 's water and sewerage infrastructure . <unk> is a joint venture between ACTEW and AGL , and is the retail provider of Canberra 's utility services including water , natural gas , electricity , and also some telecommunications services via a subsidiary TransACT . 
 Canberra 's water is stored in four reservoirs , the Corin , <unk> and Cotter dams on the Cotter River and the Googong Dam on the Queanbeyan River . Although the Googong Dam is located in New South Wales , it is managed by the ACT government . ACTEW Corporation owns Canberra 's two wastewater treatment plants , located at Fyshwick and on the lower reaches of the Molonglo River . 
 Electricity for Canberra mainly comes from the national power grid through substations at Holt and Fyshwick ( via Queanbeyan ) . Power was first supplied from a thermal plant built in 1913 , near the Molonglo River , but this was finally closed in 1957 . A 20 megawatt photovoltaic solar plant , described as the largest photovoltaic solar farm in Australia , was officially opened at <unk> on 3 September 2014 . Planning approval is being sought for the 7 megawatt <unk> Capital solar farm at Uriarra and the 13 megawatt Mugga Lane Solar Park at Hume . In addition numerous houses in Canberra have photovoltaic panels and / or solar hot water systems . Some limited local renewable power is produced via a hydro generator on the main water supply pipeline for Canberra at Mount Stromlo and methane plants at waste landfill sites at Belconnen and Mugga Lane . There are currently no wind @-@ power generators in Canberra , but several have been built or are being built or planned in nearby New South Wales , such as the 140 @.@ 7 megawatt Capital Wind Farm . The ACT government announced in 2013 that it was raising the target for electricity consumed in the ACT to be supplied from renewable sources to 90 % by 2020 . This will raise the target from 210 to 550 megawatts . It announced in February 2015 that three wind farms in Victoria and South Australia would supply 200 megawatts of capacity ; these are expected to be operational by 2017 . Contracts for the purchase of an additional 200 megawatts of power per year from two wind farms in South Australia and New South Wales were announced in December 2015 and March 2016 . The ACT government announced in 2014 that up to 23 megawatts of feed @-@ in @-@ tariff entitlements would be made available for the establishment of a facility in the ACT or surrounding region for burning household and business waste to produce electricity by 2020 .

 = Battle of Suoi Bong Trang = 
 The Battle of Suoi Bong Trang ( 23 – 24 February 1966 ) was an engagement fought between US , Australian and New Zealand forces , and the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army during the Vietnam War . The battle occurred during Operation Rolling Stone , an American security operation to protect engineers building a tactically important road in the vicinity of Tan Binh , in central Binh Duong Province , 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) north @-@ west of Bien Hoa airbase . During the fighting , soldiers from the US 1st Brigade , 1st Infantry Division and the 1st Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( 1 RAR ) , which had been attached for the operation , fought off a regimental @-@ sized Viet Cong night assault . Repulsed by massed firepower from artillery and tanks , the Viet Cong suffered heavy casualties and were forced to withdraw by morning . After the attack , the Americans and Australians made no attempt to pursue the Viet Cong , focusing on securing the battlefield and evacuating their own casualties . The Viet Cong continued to harass the American sappers with occasional sniper and mortar fire , but these tactics proved ineffective , and the road was completed by 2 March . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Military situation = = = 
 During February 1966 , as part of an American road @-@ building program designed to challenge the Viet Cong 's ability to manoeuvre in the areas around Saigon , the US 1st Engineer Battalion — under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Howard Sargent — had been engaged in constructing an all @-@ weather road between Route 13 and Route 15 in central Binh Duong Province , west of Ben Cat , on the northern apex of the Viet Cong base area known as the Iron Triangle . This road was planned to cut the communist supply routes between War Zone C , the Mekong Delta , the Iron Triangle and War Zone D , while it would also link the two forward brigades of the US 1st Infantry Division between Phuoc Vinh and Lai Khe and help to extend the authority of the South Vietnamese government . 
 In response to the American moves , Viet Cong Local Force elements began harassing the sappers , subjecting them daily to sniping , laying mines and carrying out sabotage in an effort to hamper construction . A large American security operation known as Operation Rolling Stone was subsequently launched by elements of US 1st Division on 11 February , in an area of operations approximately 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) north @-@ west of Bien Hoa airbase . The US 1st Brigade under the command of Colonel Edgar N. Glotzbach was allocated the task , and he assigned one of his three battalions to guard the engineers on a rotating basis , while the other two would probe the Viet Cong positions nearby in order to keep them off balance . 
 Meanwhile , following a request from the American divisional commander , 1 RAR — under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Alex Preece — was detached from the US 173rd Airborne Brigade and placed under the operational command of the US 1st Division until 5 March . Major General William E. <unk> had selected the Australians specifically because of their reputation for dispersed , aggressive patrolling . Attached to support the infantry from 1 RAR were Australian M113s from 1 APC Troop , engineers from 3 Field Troop , Bell Sioux light observation helicopters and Cessna 180 fixed @-@ wing aircraft from 161st Independent Reconnaissance Flight , and 105 @-@ millimetre ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) L5 Pack <unk> from 161st Battery , Royal New Zealand Artillery .

 Headquarters US 1st Brigade was located about 1 @,@ 000 metres ( 1 @,@ 100 yd ) east of the engineer base camp in the vicinity of the hamlet of Tan Binh , just north of the new roadway and less than 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) west of Route 16 . The brigade 's constituent battalions were widely dispersed carrying out search and destroy operations , and the area of operations was only lightly defended . Nevertheless , except for the harassment faced by the engineers , contact between the Americans and the Viet Cong had been infrequent during the first weeks of the operation . While US and Australian forces possessed only limited details regarding the location of Viet Cong Main Force regiments , Australian intelligence assessed that a minimum of two Local Force platoons , and possibly a Local Force company , were operating in the area but cautioned commanders that the Viet Cong probably had the ability to concentrate a Main Force battalion in the area with little warning . The concept of operations required the Australians to protect the engineer base , the laterite pit and road work parties over a distance of 6 @,@ 000 metres ( 6 @,@ 600 yd ) , as well as protecting engineer reconnaissance parties when they moved forward to plan new sections of the road . 
 On 19 February , 1 RAR was inserted by helicopter , taking over from 2nd Battalion , US 38th Infantry Regiment . Preece immediately instituted a program of twenty @-@ four @-@ hour dispersed patrolling , and within two days this had succeeded in reducing the level of Viet Cong activity against the road construction . Two platoons of American M48 Patton tanks were also moved into the area , patrolling by day with the Australian armoured personnel carriers , while securing the laterite pit at night . Several contacts took place and by 22 February the Australians began to suspect that a major attack on them was being planned , noting that they were now facing Main Force elements . In the early morning of 23 February three Viet Cong soldiers were killed in an Australian ambush , while several others were wounded but escaped . The dead soldiers were well equipped with new AK @-@ 47 assault rifles and webbing , and they were identified as being from 761st Main Force Regiment . Also captured was a large quantity of ammunition , rations and medical supplies . Later that night a North Vietnamese engineer officer was also killed in a separate ambush , adding further weight to the Australian suspicions . As dawn broke the next day , two half @-@ platoon ambushes from B Company , 1 RAR — under the command of Major Ian McFarlane — engaged two squads of Viet Cong Main Force . Preece immediately warned Glotzbach of an imminent attack , and then informed Sargent that the Australians were moving to set up a defensive position , recommending that the engineers relocate in order to join them . 
 Meanwhile , to the west three battalions of Viet Cong 9th Division were massing for a decisive blow , preparing a regimental attack on the American and Australian positions . Units included <unk> Battalion of the 761st Regiment , 707 Battalion of the <unk> Regiment and <unk> Independent Battalion ; in total around 2 @,@ 000 men . By 20 : 00 they had completed a 25 @-@ kilometre ( 16 mi ) approach march and were in assembly areas near the village of Ap Bo , using local women and youths as porters to carry ammunition , equipment and supplies . Small reconnaissance parties moved forward as pathfinders , easily locating the American headquarters due to the large amount of noise and light it gave off . The Viet Cong regimental commander determined to attack on three separate axes from the east , and to then send a force around behind the Brigade Headquarters and assault from the west , thereby surrounding the defenders and preventing them from concentrating their forces in defence . Fire support was provided from two separate locations : with 60 @-@ millimetre ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) mortars deployed to the west , in between the Australians and the US 1st Brigade 's headquarters , while 82 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 2 in ) mortars would fire from a position in Ap Bo to the south @-@ east .

 By late afternoon on 23 February 1 RAR had adopted a position in all @-@ round defence in the vicinity of the Suoi Bong Trang , a major creek to the west of the US 1st Brigade 's headquarters , while the US engineers had moved into a new defensive position inside the Australian perimeter . Meanwhile , alerted by the Australians , a platoon of M48 Patton tanks from Troop B , 1st Squadron , US 4th Cavalry Regiment and a second 105 @-@ millimetre ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) howitzer field battery from 1st Battalion , US 5th Artillery Regiment had been moved in to defend the Brigade Headquarters . 1st Battalion , US 26th Infantry Regiment — under the command of Lieutenant Colonel <unk> Phillips — returned from the field and also deployed in defence by last light , augmenting Company B , 1st Battalion , US 28th Infantry Regiment . Additional ammunition was also brought forward , in anticipation of a likely Viet Cong attack . 
 At 22 : 00 , soldiers from B Company , 1 RAR , occupying the western sector of the Australian perimeter noticed lights 250 metres ( 270 yd ) to their front . McFarlane subsequently requested artillery and mortar fire to target the location , but the request was declined by Preece . Meanwhile , a small Australian standing patrol that had deployed forward of the company main defensive position under the command of Private Walter Brunalli , observed the lights moving closer , east of the US 1st Brigade 's headquarters . Two tanks had been positioned forward of the American positions , with a squad of infantry on the eastern approaches , and by midnight they had also reported sounds of movement and intermittent flashes of light through the trees . In the early morning of 24 February , just after midnight , sporadic firing was heard throughout the area . The forward American listening posts had detected small groups of Viet Cong moving outside the perimeter , killing two and forcing the remainder to withdraw into the darkness after one of the sentries opened fire . Glotzbach waited for the Viet Cong main effort , however , and withheld the bulk of the firepower at his disposal . 
 With their defences alerted , the Americans and Australians " stood to " for the next 45 minutes . The battle began at 01 : 45 with a heavy barrage of Viet Cong mortar and small arms fire . The Americans responded with small arms , machine @-@ guns , tank fire , mortars and artillery and over the next hour the firing grew in intensity until , at 03 : 00 , the Viet Cong switched their fires to the north @-@ west side of the American perimeter , augmenting their barrage with recoilless rifles . Glotzbach expected a full @-@ scale ground assault , but the Viet Cong had been held back by the weight of American firepower , with heavy artillery including 8 @-@ inch ( 200 mm ) and 175 @-@ millimetre ( 6 @.@ 9 in ) howitzers firing in support from Phuoc Vinh , in addition to the defenders ' own artillery , which was now firing over open sights after lowering their tubes to fire directly at the Viet Cong positions . In total eight field batteries were available . Elsewhere , the Australian standing patrol had remained in position despite the proximity of the Viet Cong , and with the Americans pouring massive fire into the area they were soon caught in the crossfire . Brunalli was subsequently wounded in the arm . 
 Although the Australian position was not the focus of the attack , it too soon came under attack from 60 @-@ millimetre ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) mortars , killing an American sapper . With the base plate positioned between the Australians and the US 1st Brigade 's headquarters there was initial confusion over the source of the rounds , and both <unk> and Preece accused the other of firing on their positions . However , after US aircraft arrived overhead to illuminate the battlefield the Australians were able to join the fighting , and they began firing at masses of Viet Cong who had become disorientated and were milling around on the battlefield . Earlier , a number of Australian ambushes had intercepted Viet Cong pathfinder groups and this had largely prevented the communists from conducting a final reconnaissance of their objectives . Unaware of the newly strengthened defences , they had assaulted into the combined firepower of two American field artillery batteries firing over open sights , as well as tanks supported by infantry . Using anti @-@ personnel canister , flechette and <unk> rounds , as well as prepositioned banks of Claymore mines , the Americans broke up several assaults with heavy casualties , while the Australians poured small arms fire into the flank of what was now turning into a costly and futile attack . 
 = = = Viet Cong withdraw , 24 February 1966 = = = 
 By 02 : 45 three Viet Cong soldiers had moved to within 25 metres ( 27 yd ) of Brunalli 's standing patrol , taking up firing positions . The Australians killed one and wounded another who was dragged away by the third , before they withdrew to another location nearby . Meanwhile , the two American tanks forward of the US 1st Brigade 's headquarters were overrun and their crews killed . Having suffered heavy losses , by 04 : 00 some of the Viet Cong began to retreat from the battlefield , and many were now filtering past 1 RAR . As groups of Viet Cong began to move past their position the standing patrol was now in an untenable position , clashing briefly with one group of 15 Viet Cong . McFarlane finally ordered the patrol to withdraw , so that he could engage with artillery and mortars . Moving to achieve a clean break , the patrol engaged another group of 10 Viet Cong with a volley of small arms fire , before withdrawing 30 metres ( 33 yd ) towards the company position in the darkness . Expecting to be followed up the Australians set up a snap ambush , killing another Viet Cong soldier before successfully completing the move back to their perimeter . 
 With the Viet Cong line of withdrawal carrying them past the Australian position , heavy fire was maintained on them as they attempted a partial retreat , resulting in further casualties . However , as daybreak neared the Viet Cong lingered , unwilling to commit to an all @-@ out attack , but also unwilling to completely withdraw . Finally , the main Viet Cong attack began at 05 : 30 . Earlier losses had been heavy , though , and they were unable to concentrate in sufficient numbers to mount a massed assault . Instead only a series of disjointed attacks followed , none more than 40 men strong . By 06 : 45 these attacks had been repelled by the Americans and the Viet Cong withdrew before dawn , avoiding the arrival of additional American air support .

 = = = Casualties = = = 
 At first light the next morning Australian clearing patrols located 89 dead and 11 wounded Viet Cong in front of their positions . The bulk of the casualties had been inflicted by the Americans , but it was later determined that at least 17 Viet Cong had been killed by 1 RAR . Others had been disintegrated by artillery and tank fire and the battlefield was littered with shattered human remains , including severed limbs and chunks of flesh , while red pulp covered the rubber trees that were still standing . Later , 154 bodies were bulldozed into a B @-@ 52 bomb crater nearby , while it was estimated that a further 200 Viet Cong casualties had been removed from the battlefield . Fifteen Viet Cong had also been captured during the battle , as had a large quantity of equipment , including small arms and ammunition , crew @-@ served weapons and grenades . The villagers of Ap Bo were again used by the Viet Cong to carry many of the dead and wounded from the battlefield with ox carts , and they also suffered a number of casualties from artillery and mortar fire landing in the area . In contrast , American casualties were limited , consisting of 11 killed and 72 wounded . Australian casualties were lighter still , with just two men wounded . One American tank had also been destroyed , while two tanks and four armoured personnel carriers were damaged . Overall , the commander of the combined US @-@ Australian force believed that they had won an impressive victory , but his troops were exhausted and with ammunition running low , Glotzbach decided not to pursue the withdrawing force . Instead , the Americans and Australians focused on securing the battlefield and evacuating their own casualties . 
 = = = Subsequent operations = = = 
 For the next two days , the Australians continued to provide protection to the US engineers before being replaced by an American infantry battalion . 1 RAR subsequently flew out on 26 February , returning to Bien Hoa airbase . Meanwhile , following the attack at Tan Binh the Viet Cong attempted to avoid further contact , choosing instead to harass the American work parties with occasional mortar and sniper fire . These tactics proved ineffective , and although the Americans lost a further three killed and 29 wounded , the road was completed by 2 March . The Americans then launched an extensive civic action program in an attempt to consolidate their gains , repairing damaged houses , distributing food and providing basic health care to the local population . Despite such efforts though , American commanders were pessimistic about the possibility of achieving any long term gains in Binh Duong Province unless the South Vietnamese Army was able to provide lasting protection for the local population . On 7 March , just five days after the completion of Operation Rolling Stone , the US 1st Brigade was redeployed with US 173rd Airborne Brigade and 1 RAR on Operation Silver City , sweeping the south @-@ west sector of War Zone D. 
 At the strategic level the ARVN and the South Vietnamese government had both rallied after appearing on the verge of collapse and the threat against Saigon subsided . General William Westmoreland , commander of US forces in Vietnam , planned to adopt a more offensive strategy , and between January and December 1966 US troop levels rose from 210 @,@ 000 to 327 @,@ 000 . The Australian government also increased its own commitment to the ground war in March 1966 , announcing the deployment of a two battalion brigade — the 1st Australian Task Force ( 1 ATF ) — with armour , aviation , engineer and artillery support ; in total 4 @,@ 500 men . Additional Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) and the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) force elements would also be deployed and with all three services total Australian strength in Vietnam was planned to increase to 6 @,@ 300 personnel . 1 RAR was subsequently replaced by 1 ATF which was allocated its own area of operations in Phuoc Tuy Province , thereby allowing the Australians to pursue operations more independently using their own counter @-@ insurgency tactics and techniques . The task force arrived between April and June 1966 , constructing a base at Nui Dat , while logistic arrangements were provided by the 1st Australian Logistic Support Group which was established at the port of Vung Tau . 
 = Washington State Route 9 = 
 State Route 9 ( SR 9 ) is a 98 @.@ 17 @-@ mile ( 157 @.@ 99 km ) long state highway traversing three counties , Snohomish , Skagit and Whatcom , in the U.S. state of Washington . The highway extends north from an interchange with SR 522 in the vicinity of Woodinville north through Snohomish , Lake Stevens , Arlington , Sedro @-@ Woolley and Nooksack to become British Columbia Highway 11 ( BC 11 ) at the Canada – US border in Sumas . Three other roadways are briefly concurrent with the route : SR 530 in Arlington , SR 20 in Sedro @-@ Woolley and SR 542 near Deming . A spur route in Sumas serves trucks traveling into British Columbia . 
 Before SR 9 was created , several other roads used the route of the current highway . The first was a roadway extending from the current southern terminus to Snohomish established by 1895 and another road between Arlington and Sedro @-@ Woolley by 1911 . The current SR 542 concurrency was first established in 1925 , when a branch of State Road 1 from Bellingham to Mount Baker was added to the state highway system . These roads were combined and several other roads were added to create Secondary State Highway 1A ( SSH 1A ) , which originally ran from Woodinville to Blaine in 1937 . A branch of SSH 1A connected the mainline to the Canada – US border in Sumas , but was later included into SSH 1A when the Blaine to Sumas segment was deleted in 1953 . A highway renumbering in 1964 introduced the sign routes that would be co @-@ signed with the existing system until 1970 , one of which would replace SSH 1A , SR 9 . SSH 1A / SR 9 extended south to Woodinville until 1965 , when it was shortened to SR 202 , later SR 522 , which wasn 't complete yet . SR 9 was not complete between Lake Stevens and Arlington until after 1966 . 
 Between 2004 and 2009 , nine complete construction projects , arranged by the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) , have improved the roadway . The projects ranged from expanding the current weigh station at the Sopher Hill Road intersection in 2005 to realigning the highway between Nooksack and Sumas in 2006 to eliminate 90 @-@ degree turns . WSDOT is also widening SR 9 in Snohomish County from 2 lanes to a four @-@ lane divided highway . Between 2009 and 2013 , WSDOT plans to complete six other projects in Snohomish County to improve the corridor from SR 522 to Bryant . Some projects include <unk> , adding a roundabout at SR 531 , realignments south of Snohomish and the addition of web cameras . 
 = = Route description = = 
 State Route 9 ( SR 9 ) originates as the Snohomish – Woodinville Road at a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 522 north of Woodinville . Temporarily paralleling a BNSF rail line , the highway intersects SR 524 in Maltby . After SR 524 , the roadway passes several residential communities in Clearview and Cathcart . Shortly after leaving Cathcart , SR 96 terminates at the road . SR 9 passes Harvey Airfield and crosses another BNSF rail line and the Snohomish River to enter Snohomish . North of the Snohomish River Bridge , the highway encounters a diamond interchange with 2nd Street and Riverview Road and turns northeast to intersect Bickford Avenue , which once was U.S. Route 2 ( US 2 ) . Curving north out of Snohomish , the route interchanges with US 2 in a modified diamond interchange , with a westbound US 2 offramp routed onto New Bunk Foss Road . 
 In suburban West Lake Stevens near the Lake Stevens shoreline , SR 204 ends at the highway . After the intersection , the roadway had an estimated daily average of 25 @,@ 000 motorists in 2007 , making this stretch of road the busiest on the whole highway . SR 9 also forms the western boundary of Lake Stevens and the eastern boundary of Marysville while passing a weigh station and the SR 92 junction . After Lake Cassidy , the road intersects SR 528 and continues into North Marysville , where the roadway passes over the Snohomish County Centennial Trail . After passing SR 531 , several residential subdivisions , Pioneer Elementary and Arlington High School , the highway enters downtown Arlington as Hazel Street . After a brief concurrency with SR 530 , SR 9 crosses the Stillaguamish River and passes Bryant to enter a heavily forested area and leave Snohomish County . 
 Entering Skagit County , the highway continues northwest through a large forest to Lake McMurray , where it intersects SR 534 and encounters the Lake McMurray Store , established in 1889 . Passing Big Lake and its community of the same name , the roadway serves Big Lake Elementary before intersecting SR 538 at a roundabout . Turning northeast to Clear Lake and Clear Lake Elementary , the route crosses the Skagit River into Sedro @-@ Woolley . In Sedro @-@ Woolley , the street becomes concurrent with SR 20 and is named Moore Street . At the end of the concurrency , the road turns north as Township Street , paralleling another BNSF rail line , at Cascade Middle School . Continuing north out of the city and into rural areas , SR 9 passes Samish Elementary , crosses the Samish River and exits rural Skagit County . 
 The highway enters Whatcom County in a valley located east of Lake Whatcom . Passing Acme and crossing the Nooksack River , the roadway becomes concurrent with SR 542 in Deming . Traveling west with SR 542 along the Nooksack River , the road splits in Cedarville and continues north through a series of 90 @-@ degree turns in a plain located near the Sumas River . In Nooksack , the route becomes Nooksack Avenue and encounters SR 544 , named Main Street , which travels west to Everson . North of Nooksack , SR 9 intersects SR 546 in a rural area and travels northeast along the Sumas River to Sumas . In Sumas , SR 547 ends at SR 9 and a spur route that serves trucks branches off and SR 9 terminates at the Canada – US border . The road continues north from the Canada – US border , through Abbotsford , BC to Highway 1 ( BC 1 ) , as BC 11 . 
 = = = Spur route = = = 
 Within Sumas , SR 9 has a short 0 @.@ 24 mi ( 0 @.@ 39 km ) spur route that is used by trucks travelling into Canada . SR 9 Spur starts at SR 9 ( Cherry Street ) and travels east as Garfield Street and north as Sumas Avenue to the Canada – US border , where it becomes Boundary Avenue and reconnects back to SR 9 's continuation in Canada , Highway 11 ( BC 11 ) in Abbotsford , BC . After the Cherry Street intersection , an estimated daily average of 1 @,@ 800 motorists used the roadway in 2007 .

 The current route of SR 9 began as a road extending from Grace ( today Woodinville ) north to Snohomish , first appearing in an 1895 map . The Snohomish to Arlington segment was not built until after SR 9 , but between Arlington and Sedro @-@ Woolley , there was a highway by 1911 . The first section of the roadway to be included in the state highway system was the current SR 542 concurrency , which became a branch of State Road 1 extending from Bellingham to Mount Baker in 1925 . Secondary State Highway 1A ( SSH 1A ) was established in 1937 and ran from Primary State Highway 2 ( PSH 2 ) in Woodinville north to Sumas and west to PSH 1 in Blaine . A branch of SSH 1A connected the main highway to the Canada – US border . Between Lynden and Nooksack , SSH 1A was realigned in 1951 and in 1953 , SSH 1A between Blaine and Sumas was deleted . SSH 1E became concurrent with SSH 1A in 1957 when it was extended east through Arlington to Darrington . A third concurrency was added in 1961 when PSH 16 was extended west , concurrent in Sedro @-@ Woolley , to Fredonia . During the 1964 highway renumbering , a new system of highways , sign routes , was introduced and was co @-@ signed with the existing primary and secondary state highways . SSH 1A became SR 9 , but SSH 1A was still signed until 1970 . In 1965 , SSH 1A / SR 9 was shortened from Woodinville to SR 202 in Grace , which was not complete yet . By 1966 , the highway was not complete between Lake Stevens and Arlington and in 1970 , SR 202 became SR 522 . 
 Since 2004 , the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) has completed nine construction projects on SR 9 . The Lake Stevens weigh station , located on the west side of the highway at the Sopher Hill Road <unk> was expanded to serve two trucks at once in late 2005 . The U.S. Route 2 ( US 2 ) interchange was modified to use New Bunk Foss Road as an onramp and traffic signals were added in January 2006 . The roadway was repaved between Snohomish and Lake Stevens and also guardrails and turn lanes were added in 2006 . < On November 22 , 2006 , WSDOT opened a new alignment of SR 9 between Nooksack to Sumas that bypassed three 90 @-@ degree turns . A roundabout was added to the SR 538 intersection east of Mount Vernon in summer 2007 . Between SR 522 and SR 524 , the highway was widened from a 2 @-@ lane road to a four @-@ lane divided highway in 2008 . A curve on the roadway north of Arlington was <unk> in late 2008 and turn lanes were added to two intersections near Bryant . 
 = = Future developments = = 
 Between 1980 and 2000 , the population of Snohomish County grew by 80 % ; most new residents now use the 2 @-@ lane SR 9 to commute . Accidents have increased from an average of 325 collisions per year in the 1990s to 450 collisions per year between 2000 and 2007 . Since late 2005 , WSDOT has been improving the corridor with six projects located between SR 522 and the Skagit County line that are scheduled to be completed by 2013 . South of Snohomish , WSDOT is improving the highway in multiple ways including new intersections and alignments , new web cameras and new turn lanes . Between SR 524 and Clearview , the 2 @-@ lane road is being widened to a four @-@ lane divided highway starting in 2011 . The SR 531 intersection south of Arlington is scheduled to be rebuilt as a roundabout in 2011 . The roundabout option was chosen over a traffic signal in early October 2009 . A route development plan is currently being designed for the highway between SR 522 and <unk> Road north of Arlington . During a project to widen SR 9 in Lake Stevens , a left @-@ turn lane to Lake Stevens Road was removed and residents located on the road have protested .

 = New York State Route 20N = 
 New York State Route 20N ( NY 20N ) was a state highway in central New York in the United States . It was an alternate route of U.S. Route 20 ( US 20 ) that stretched for 30 @.@ 5 miles ( 49 @.@ 1 km ) between Marcellus and Cazenovia . The road began at its parent route , US 20 , and NY 174 in Marcellus and ended at US 20 , NY 20SY , and NY 92 in Cazenovia . All of NY 20N was concurrent with at least one other route , namely NY 174 in Marcellus , NY 175 from Marcellus to Onondaga Hill , NY 173 from Onondaga Hill to Manlius , and NY 92 and NY 20SY between Manlius and Cazenovia . NY 20N was assigned in May 1937 and removed c . 1962 along with NY 20SY . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 20N began at an intersection with US 20 and NY 174 in the town of Marcellus . The route headed north , overlapping NY 174 through the town of Marcellus into the village of Marcellus . At the time , the two routes entered the village on South Street and followed it north to Main Street . NY 20N and NY 174 turned east , following Main for a half @-@ block to North Street . Here , NY 20N and NY 174 split , with NY 174 heading to the west and NY 20N proceeding east along NY 175 , which began at this junction at the time of NY 20N 's removal . 
 NY 20N and NY 175 continued east to Onondaga , where NY 173 joined the two routes and created a three @-@ route overlap for 100 yards ( 91 m ) . At the east end of the overlap , NY 20N continued east along NY 173 into the southernmost section of Syracuse . Here , the two routes intersected NY 80 and US 11 and passed under Interstate 81 before exiting the city limits . 
 Now in the town of De Witt , NY 20N and NY 173 met the northern terminus of NY 91 in the hamlet of Jamesville . The overlap between NY 20N and NY 173 ended 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) to the east in the village of Manlius , where NY 92 and NY 20SY joined both routes just west of where NY 173 split from NY 20N and continued to the east . Outside of Manlius , NY 20N , NY 20SY and NY 92 headed southeast for 7 miles ( 11 km ) to Cazenovia , where all three routes ended at US 20 adjacent to Cazenovia Lake and west of the village . 
 = = History = = 
 The portion of NY 20N from the intersection of NY 174 and NY 175 in the village of Marcellus to the junction of NY 92 and NY 173 in Manlius was part of the Seneca Turnpike . The turnpike was created in the 1800s and at the time was the longest in the state . NY 20N was assigned c . 1938 as a northerly alternate route to US 20 , which bypassed Syracuse to the south . The route extended from the town of Marcellus to the village of Cazenovia and overlapped NY 174 , NY 175 , NY 173 , and NY 92 upon assignment . All four of the routes that NY 20N originally overlapped were assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . 
 A second , more northerly alternate route of US 20 in the Syracuse area was assigned in 1951 and designated as NY 20SY . From Manlius to Cazenovia , NY 20SY overlapped NY 20N and NY 92 . Both NY 20N and NY 20SY were removed c . 1962 .

 Countdown to Extinction is the fifth studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth , released on July 14 , 1992 through Capitol Records . It was the group 's second studio release to feature the " classic " lineup of Dave Mustaine , Marty Friedman , David Ellefson and Nick Menza , with all of them contributing to songwriting on the album . The album features some of the band 's best known songs such as " Symphony of Destruction " , " Sweating Bullets " and " Skin o ' My Teeth " , which enjoyed significant chart success and made a great musical impact . 
 Countdown to Extinction received positive reaction from music critics , who noted its politically oriented lyrics and simplified sound in comparison to their previous record . The album entered the Billboard 200 at number two , the band 's highest position ever . It eventually achieved double platinum status and became their most commercially successful album . The record was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 1993 Grammy Awards , while the album 's title track won the Humane Society 's Genesis Award for raising awareness for animal rights issues . 
 In 2012 , in recognition of the album 's 20th anniversary , Megadeth kicked off a 20th anniversary tour in South America , playing the album in its entirety . In addition , a 20th anniversary special edition of the album was released in November 2012 , and a live album featuring a performance of the full album was released in September 2013 . 
 = = Production and musical style = = 
 Countdown to Extinction is Megadeth 's fifth studio album , and the second to feature the line @-@ up of Dave Mustaine , Marty Friedman , David Ellefson and Nick Menza . In an interview for Billboard at the time , Mustaine admitted that he fired past members Chuck Behler and Jeff Young because they resisted his pleas to seek rehabilitative counseling . He added that it was a " major accomplishment " that all four members of Megadeth contributed material to the album , unlike their earlier releases which were " nearly all Mustaine " . Mustaine also revealed that producer Max Norman had significant input to the album by making " a lot of suggestions and a lot of great artistic ideas " . Guitarist Marty Friedman said that unlike Rust in Peace , the creation of this record was " completely different " . He further stated that the band had changed the songs " a million times " before recording them on demo and entering the studio . 
 The music for Countdown to Extinction was written in two different sessions . The first session was done following the conclusion of Clash of the Titans tour , while the second session took place after a one @-@ month break , in the fall of 1991 . The album was recorded in the first half of 1992 , when the Rodney King Riots took place . These events negatively affected the recording process , as the band was forced to leave the studio every night at six o 'clock because of the enacted curfew . Dave Mustaine shared his experience : " There ’ s nothing worse than getting a creative moment and you have to leave . It was like a school bell ringing . " The record was produced by Mustaine and Max Norman at The Enterprise in Burbank , California , while the mixing was handed by Norman with the help of Fred Kelly . Referring to the recording process , Mustaine said that Countdown to Extinction " was one of those records where everything was firing on all 12 cylinders and you just know it " . He also said that it didn 't take the band a long time to record the album because " records were a lot easier to make back then because the pressure wasn 't quite as hard " . 
 Following Metallica 's mainstream breakthrough in 1991 , Mustaine stripped down Megadeth 's sound , though the music remained as technically perfectionist as their previous releases . Drummer Nick Menza explained : " Metallica has definitely opened the doors for other bands to step through . We 're obviously the next band to step through that doorway . " Musically , Countdown to Extinction saw Megadeth beginning to incorporate more melody and mid @-@ tempos into its traditional sound . Bassist David Ellefson noted that the band 's goal was to " create music that had more of a groove to it , " capitalizing on the melodic playing style employed by Friedman , and further assisted by the input of producer Norman . Author Thomas Harrison wrote that with this album , Megadeth 's music became " more virtuosic than noisy and took the next step towards widespread acceptance " . 
 = = Lyrics = = 
 Like its predecessor , many of the songs on the album have political and military undertones . However , the opening track " Skin o ' My Teeth " was speculated being about suicide , a theme which differs from the rest of the album . " Symphony of Destruction " , with lyrics written by Dave Mustaine , details a story about a regular citizen as the head of a puppet regime , as the country is run by a phantom government . The song was noted by critics for its great social and philosophical impact . " Architecture of Aggression " explores the nature of global conflict ; Mustaine revealed that the song was about former Iraq president Saddam Hussein , who was engaged in the Gulf War at the time . " Foreclosure of a Dream " deals with economic concerns and social inequality . According to music critic Eduardo <unk> , " perhaps no other Megadeth song in history deals as directly and soberly " with these issues . The song sampled then @-@ U.S. President George H. W. Bush 's infamous " Read my lips " speech , making a statement about taxation endangering the " American Dream " . Billboard praised the track , along with " Symphony of Destruction " , for being " socially conscious " and described them as " powerful statements for hard rockers " . 
 The fifth track , " Sweating Bullets " , shows Mustaine 's battle with his inner selves , which is presented throughout conversational singing style . " Sweating Bullets " was written during the second recording session and was released as the album 's third single . Its lyrical theme deals with paranoia . David Ellefson commented that the song 's lyrics were " <unk> perfect " and sounded like " the inside of a crazed lunatic 's mind " . The title track was inspired by environmental concerns about the future of the planet . The name was suggested by Nick Menza , who had read a story in Time magazine entitled " The Countdown to Extinction " . " High Speed Dirt " focuses on skydiving . " Captive Honour " is a song about prison and the consequences of crime , while " <unk> " was written about the Marvel Comics character Deathlok .

 Countdown to Extinction received generally positive reaction from critics . Spin wrote that the album " may just be the finest thrash metal album ever made , although purists may find it a bit too polished and easy to swallow " . AllMusic reviewer Steve Huey said that " Megadeth guns for arena thrash success and gets it on Countdown to Extinction " . However , Huey noted the simplification of Megadeth 's sound on the album in response to Metallica 's commercially successful self @-@ titled album released the previous year . Sputnikmusic reviewer Mike Stagno praised Mustaine 's vocals as well as a number of the album 's tracks . Despite calling this effort " Megadeth 's first step into the world of mainstream music " , he also noted that " the band still maintains its identity " . Reflex described the sound as " impressively clean , streamlined , and sharp , brimming with killing riffs " . They highlighted the vocal delivery on the record , saying " Mustaine 's never sounded more confident , verbally and vocally " . 
 Popmatters writer Craig Hayes opined that Countdown to Extinction was " either an exemplary illustration of nimble @-@ fingered thrash metal that introduced Megadeth to a legion of new fans " or " an unimaginative , artistically cynical stab at arena @-@ baiting commercial success " . According to Greg Sandow from Entertainment Weekly , Megadeth 's " music has lost its former hurricane verve but keeps its crunch , and feels more rooted , even more melodic " . Chad Bowar from About.com raved the album 's 20th anniversary edition , describing the songs as " more straightforward " and the lyrics predominantly being " politically charged " . Jon Hadusek , writing in Consequence of Sound , labeled Countdown to Extinction as Mustaine 's " political record " and said that the record " saw Megadeth moving away from thrash metal and closer to generic hard rock , a sonic shift they would embrace on subsequent albums " . In an unfavorable review , Karen <unk> of Rolling Stone wrote that " while Countdown echoes the band 's earlier work thematically , it 's stylistically disappointing " . By contrast , Holger Stratmann of Rock Hard concluded that the disc is " a compact album with a few strokes of genius " . Reviewing the album 's deluxe edition for Record Collector , journalist Joel McIver eulogized it as a " masterpiece of technical , melodic thrash " and a showcase of Megadeth " at their best and most coherent " .

 Countdown to Extinction was released on July 6 , 1992 through Capitol Records and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with first week sales of 128 @,@ 000 copies . It was prevented from entering the chart at number one because of Billy Ray Cyrus ' long chart @-@ topping reign with Some Gave All . The album was acknowledged as the band 's commercial breakthrough , and according to authors Pete Prown and Harvey P. Newquist , Megadeth " reached the heights of popularity and critical acclaim " with this particular record . Two years after its original release , Countdown to Extinction was certified double platinum and became the band 's most commercially successful album , confirming that they had retained their audience in the wake of grunge . The record was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 1993 Grammy Awards , while the album 's title track won the Humane Society 's Genesis Award for raising awareness for animal rights issues . 
 The record enjoyed similar chart success outside of the United States . It managed to peak within the top 5 on the charts in the United Kingdom and New Zealand , and charted for eight weeks on both of them . It also entered the top 10 on the Japanese and Norwegian albums chart , while it charted slightly lower in several other countries as well . It was eventually certified three times platinum from the Canadian Music Association for shipping 300 @,@ 000 copies and received a silver award from the British Phonographic Industry for having a shipment of 60 @,@ 000 copies . 
 Asked how does he think that the album has aged , Dave Mustaine responded : " I think it 's timely and timeless at the same time , and I think that 's one of the most difficult things for a musician to do . Very few records in our genre are like that . Musically it 's heavy and the lyrics are very symbolic . " In the liner notes of the album 's 20th anniversary edition , music journalist Kory Grow wrote that " thanks to a perfect balance of hard @-@ rock song structures , epic choruses , and fleet @-@ fingered guitar work , Countdown to Extinction became an instant classic , benefiting from copious MTV and radio play . " Artistdirect editor in chief Rick Florino called the album a " seminal " release and commented that it " changed the game by preserving the band 's thrash intensity and impressive technical prowess , while dropping some of the biggest hooks the genre had ever seen " . In a retrospective review of the album , Craig Hayes from Popmatters wrote that Countdown to Extinction 's " status as a gateway metal album is indisputable " and its " popularity speaks volumes about its significance in the metal canon " .

 The group started the Countdown to Extinction tour in 1992 with Pantera and Suicidal Tendencies as the opening acts . They headlined the Roskilde Festival in Copenhagen on June 27 the same year , and continued with dates in Europe during the summer . The tour carried on throughout 1993 , with the band making appearances on a number of large festivals . In January they performed in the United States with Stone Temple Pilots as the supporting act . Although these two bands had scheduled tour dates in Japan during the month of May , the dates were subsequently canceled . In June 1993 , Megadeth played at the Milton Keynes National Bowl with Diamond Head and later opened for Iron Maiden and Metallica on their European tour . After finishing their major European tour , the band began a US tour which eventually ended on December 8 , 1993 .

 = Tory Christman = 
 Tory Christman is a prominent American critic of Scientology and former member of the organization . Originally brought up a Catholic , Christman turned to Scientology after being introduced to the book Dianetics : The Modern Science of Mental Health authored by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard while staying with her parents in Chicago , Illinois . She identified with concepts described in the book including the idea of attaining the Scientology state of clear , and became a member of the organization in 1969 . She hitchhiked from Chicago to Los Angeles , California , in order to begin the process of studying Scientology , and initially felt that it helped improve her life . In 1972 , she joined the elite division within Scientology called the Sea Org . After being a member of the Scientology organization for ten years , Christman reached the spiritual Operating Thetan level of OT III , and learned the story of Xenu . She subsequently rose to a higher Operating Thetan level of OT VII , the second @-@ highest within the organization . Her medical condition of epilepsy caused difficulty while in Scientology , as the organization did not approve of taking medication in order to manage her condition . 
 She became an ordained minister within Scientology , and instructed celebrity member actor John Travolta in initial coursework . Christman worked in various capacities during her time with Scientology , including for its drug rehab organization Narconon , and at one of the organization 's Celebrity Centres . After serving in these roles , Christman came to work for the Office of Special Affairs ( OSA ) , which functions as an intelligence agency within Scientology . She participated in multiple missions for OSA , including a 1979 operation designed to advance the organization 's interests in Clearwater , Florida , and a 1985 operation assisting OSA agents during a lawsuit against Scientology . In 1999 , OSA agents removed the censorship software " Scieno Sitter " from Christman 's home computer , in order to allow her to carry out a mission of monitoring critical material about Scientology on the Internet . It was in this capacity that she came across the Scientology critic website Operation Clambake , managed by Andreas Heldal @-@ Lund . 
 Christman reported directly to OSA vice president , Janet Weiland , about her efforts to remove criticism of Scientology from the media and online . She supervised the Scientology Parishioners League , a group dedicated to removing criticism about the organization from the press , media , and Internet . After an operation viewed as successful where Christman complained to MTV about a South Park parody involving Travolta and characters from the comedy series which satirized Scientology , she was assigned in 2000 to monitor postings to the newsgroup <unk> Christman took the screen name of " Magoo " , and posted multiple times to the newsgroup in attempts to stifle criticism . This conflicted with her ideals of freedom of speech , and after Andreas Heldal @-@ Lund reached out to her by email , she subsequently decided to leave Scientology . 
 After leaving Scientology , Christman 's family and friends in the movement ceased communication with her , under the organization 's policy of disconnection . She traveled to Florida to join members of the Lisa McPherson Trust , a group dedicated to protesting against Scientology . For leaving Scientology and joining with a critic group , she felt she was subjected to the Scientology policy of " Fair Game " ; a form of retribution for criticizing the organization . Christman has since become one of the more prominent critics of Scientology ; she lectures and gives interviews about the organization internationally . In 2008 she joined in protests organized by the movement against Scientology called Project Chanology started by the Internet @-@ based group Anonymous , but criticized the group for some of their initial illegal acts . Christman maintains an account on YouTube with the identification " <unk> " , where she posts topically about Scientology . The Sunday Times characterized Christman in a 2009 article as " a fierce critic of the church " . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Christman was born in 1947 ; she is the daughter of Paul Christman , an American football player and member of the College Football Hall of Fame who played college football for the University of Missouri and professionally for the Chicago Cardinals and Green Bay Packers . Christman was brought up to believe in Catholicism . In 1969 at age 22 , Christman went through a difficult period abusing heroin in San Francisco , California . Christman had left home for California with the intent of becoming a hippie . She required medical treatment after using a dirty hypodermic needle , and returned to her parents ' residence in Chicago , Illinois . While recuperating in Illinois after a stay at Lake Forest Hospital , two Scientologist friends persuaded her to join the Scientology organization . 
 She read the foundational text Dianetics : The Modern Science of Mental Health by Scientology founder , science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard , and came to believe " it was a solution for helping other people " . In recalling her initial thoughts upon reading the book by Hubbard , Christman commented , " I was really looking for a higher state of consciousness and a way of helping people . And I read Dianetics and I felt " WOW this is it ! " You know , " I can help people go CLEAR . " She hitchhiked from Chicago to Los Angeles , California to study Scientology in 1969 . Her first course in Scientology cost US $ 35 @.@ 00 . Christman was quoted with a positive comment about Scientology , in the 1992 edition of the Church of Scientology International @-@ produced book What is Scientology ? . She stated in the book , " I find life just gets better and better . " Christman has a son .

 = = = Rise within organization = = = 
 In 1972 , Christman joined the division of Scientology called the Sea Org , an elite unit within the organization . 3 News characterised the Sea Org as " Scientology 's senior management " . In their book Cults and New Religions , Douglas E. Cowan and David G. Bromley describe the Sea Org writing , " Described by the Church as ' a fraternal religious order , ' members of the Sea Org ' occupy the most essential and trusted positions in the senior churches in the Scientology hierarchy ' . " Rolling Stone notes , " Sea Org members staff all of the senior ecclesiastic positions in the church hierarchy " . In 2010 , there were 5 @,@ 000 members in the Sea Org . Her Sea Org career was short lived ; she was instructed to cease taking prescribed medication for her epilepsy , and as a result experienced multiple serious seizures . In one instance two of her front teeth came out after she suffered a fall caused by a seizure while in the bathroom . She recounted these incidents of seizures , in an interview with CBS News , " So I started having grand mal seizures , and I wasn 't even off the medicine . I was only off part of the medicine , and I started having very bad grand mal seizures . " Christman recalled that her epilepsy was not recognized as a genuine medical condition by the Scientology organization ; whose practice was to instruct members to attempt self @-@ treatment utilizing saunas and vitamins . After a few months she was finally convinced by her mother to resume her medication , even though this meant expulsion from the Sea Org . She remained a member of the church . 
 After being a member of the Scientology organization for ten years , Christman reached the spiritual " Operating Thetan " level of OT III . She recounted her experience of reading the Xenu story upon reaching the level of OT III : " You 've jumped through all these hoops just to get to it , and then you open that packet , and the first thing you think is , ' Come on . ' " She explained , " You 're surrounded by all these people who 're going , ' Wow , isn 't it amazing , just getting the data ? I can tell it 's really changed you . ' After a while , enough people say it and you 're like , ' Wow . You know , I really feel it . ' " 
 While a member of the organization , Christman rose to the Operating Thetan level of OT VII , " the near @-@ pinnacle of enlightenment " , and second @-@ highest level within the movement . She worked for a time in one of the organization 's Celebrity Centres , and became acquainted with celebrity members including John Travolta and Kelly Preston . She became an ordained minister within Scientology , and in this role trained new recruits to the organization , including Travolta . She trained Travolta on the " Hubbard Qualified Scientologist " , the second Scientology class after the initial communication course . Christman spent time working at Narconon International , a group affiliated with Scientology and promoted as a drug rehabilitation program using methods created by L. Ron Hubbard . She later came to realize that Narconon was a recruitment arm for Scientology , " Narconon 's orders come from the Church of Scientology 's senior management . Their programs , policies -- it 's all church policy . There 's no question about this to anyone involved . ... At Narconon ( they 're ) handling drugs in society . But in truth , it 's to ' safe point the environment ' – a goodwill gesture so they can recruit people . " 
 According to Rolling Stone , Christman became a " high @-@ ranking Scientologist " during her time in Scientology . She had difficulty progressing higher than OT VII within the organization , in part due to her medical condition of epilepsy . 
 = = = Office of Special Affairs = = = 
 Christman worked with the Office of Special Affairs ( OSA ) in her efforts to curtail or remove material critical of Scientology from the press , media , and the Internet . She spent a total of 20 years working for the OSA agency while a member of the Scientology organization . OSA agents serve as the " internal security force and intelligence unit " within Scientology . Christman assisted OSA agents in 1979 , when a politician in Clearwater , Florida was attempting to hinder the Scientology organization 's efforts to establish a presence in the city . She was ordered to participate in public meetings , and divert the focus of these events to questioning of the politician , Richard <unk> . He was defeated in a subsequent election , and the Scientology organization proceeded to increase its activities in Clearwater . In 1985 , Christman helped OSA agents during a lawsuit from a former Scientology member . She attended the court proceedings and wrote reports about members of the jury , and assisted Scientology lawyers in compiling profiles of the jurors . At the time , Christman was an ardent believer in the Scientology organization and did not question the activities of the OSA agents . Reflecting back on her experiences assisting OSA agents , she commented , " I was in a cult . Scientology promotes not watching the news . It keeps you inside a Truman Show where you 're totally unaware of things . It 's like your own thinking gets shut down and you get used to not considering anything that might be critical of Scientology . " 
 In 1998 , the Scientology organization publicized an initiative to hand out software on CDs to all its members , which would help them create their own websites describing their activity in the movement , and linking back to the main site at <unk> The Scientology organization did not reveal to these individuals that the CD was simultaneously bundled with censorship software which blocked websites critical of the organization . This censorship software was termed , " Scieno Sitter " by critics of the organization . ( Janet Weiland , vice president of the OSA , has stated that it remains Scientologists ' personal choice whether to use the filter , to protect them and their family members from encountering on @-@ line harassment , and some Scientologists have always chosen to surf the Internet without filtering . ) OSA agents wished for Christman to specifically monitor such critical websites and report to the organization about her findings , so they removed the Scieno Sitter censorship software from the computer at her residence in 1999 , allowing her to research sites online freely . She came across the Scientology critic website Operation Clambake , managed by Andreas Heldal @-@ Lund . 
 Christman reported directly to OSA vice president , Janet Weiland , about her efforts to remove criticism of Scientology from the media and online . She assisted in dealing with public relations for Scientology . Within the organization , negative publicity in the media was referred to as " Black PR " . In 2000 , Christman was in charge of the Scientology Parishioners League , a division formed by volunteers on orders from Weiland in order to respond rapidly to incidents of critical coverage of Scientology in the press . Weiland recruited Christman to the Scientology Parishioners League in 1999 . She would receive instruction from OSA agents , and proceed to complain to journalism editors and television producers in an attempt to convince them to pull a critical segment on Scientology . A & E Network produced a special television program analyzing cults , and the Scientology Parishioners League complained to the network and attempted to have Scientology removed from coverage in the program , asserting , " Scientology isn 't a cult . " 
 Christman was tasked with refuting facts posted on the Internet about the organization . She observed about her time working with OSA , " The guys I worked with posted every day all day . It was like a machine . I worked with someone who used five separate computers , five separate anonymous identities ... to refute any facts from the internet about the Church of Scientology . " She acknowledged that she set up multiple identities for use in this purpose online , " I was in charge of setting up phony accounts on the Internet that were designed to shut down free speech by blocking out opponents ' sites or trick @-@ routing people to pro @-@ Scientology sites when they were looking for opposing information . " 
 She was assigned to try to stop the MTV Movie Awards from featuring a South Park satire which poked fun at Scientology and the film based on a book by its founder L. Ron Hubbard , titled Battlefield Earth . Christman repeatedly called the New York office of MTV in an attempt to get them to stop the satire from airing . In the eventual broadcast , which ran June 8 , 2000 , the South Park character Cartman was shown using a Scientology personality test as toilet paper . Christman believed she had succeeded in her mission , for she thought that her efforts prevented the book Dianetics from being used by Cartman , instead of the personality test . 
 After the perceived success of her South Park assignment , OSA agents instructed Christman to deal with Scientology critics who congregated on the Internet . Her initial activities focused on a Warner <unk> bulletin board which focused on Battlefield Earth , and she subsequently progressed to posting on the newsgroup alt.religion.scientology ( ARS ) . In 2000 , ARS functioned as a community of individuals whose efforts included posting material which reflected negatively on the Scientology organization . Christman took the screen name of " Magoo " . From her Burbank , California residence in 2000 , Christman posted numerous attacks on Scientology critics that were active on ARS . She worked to become the most frequent poster on the newsgroup by July 2000 . Scientology critics on ARS were mystified as to the identity of the individual behind the Magoo handle , and posited that it was either a collective of OSA agents , or David Miscavige himself , the leader of Scientology management . 
 = = = Decision to leave = = = 
 During this period of time in her efforts on behalf of the OSA agents , Christman felt conflicted in her activities , because she supported freedom of speech and she felt her activities constituted censorship . The operator of Xenu.net , Andreas Heldal @-@ Lund , saw Christman 's posts on ARS and reached out to her via email on July 14 , 2000 . The two engaged in communication , and Heldal @-@ Lund explained to Christman his motivation for managing the Operation Clambake site . Christman identified with Heldal @-@ Lund 's ideals of free speech , and on July 20 , 2000 , she announced her intention to leave Scientology in a public post to ARS . She realized she would face repercussions from the organization for her actions , and asked Heldal @-@ Lund for help ; he recommended she contact a group of protesters against Scientology called the Lisa McPherson Trust ( <unk> ) who were based in Clearwater , Florida . The <unk> was started by Robert Minton and former Scientologists to highlight the controversial death of Scientology member , Lisa McPherson . 
 Through the Scientology practice of " disconnection " , Christman 's husband and the majority of her acquaintances and friends who were Scientologists at the time of her exit from the group were excommunicated from her and cut off contact . Christman recounted how after leaving the organization , the Church of Scientology attempted to damage her reputation through a policy referred to as " dead <unk> " . According to Christman , the Scientology organization publicized inaccurate information about her online , tried to get her removed from her position of employment , and opened a lawsuit related to her protesting against the group on church property . Then Scientology @-@ spokesperson , Mike Rinder , called her a " wacko " and rejected her assertions as " absolute bullshit " . 
 Christman contacted the Scientology critics based in Clearwater , and arranged flight transportation to Florida . She arrived at the airport in California to find that her flight was cancelled . Her former supervisor , Janet Weiland , was waiting for her close to the ticket counter , and tried to convince her to remain in the organization . Christman eventually got on a flight to Tampa , Florida , but was met at the gate when she arrived by agents of Scientology . Tampa police were notified , and escorted Christman safely away from the Scientologists . While a member of Scientology , Christman had given over $ 1 million to the organization ; she used her inheritance money to pay for coursework . She commented to the St. Petersburg Times of Florida about the thought process she underwent after leaving the organization , " When you get out and you get the whole thing , you 're like , ' What was I thinking ? ' . I know the people inside are brainwashed and they 're laughing at me . But to me , the truth is , I 'm free . I can do what I want . I can say what I want . " 
 = = = Public criticism = = = 
 Shortly after leaving the organization , Christman began protesting in Florida against Scientology with members of the Lisa McPherson Trust . She picketed with signs outside of the organization 's Fort Harrison Hotel in Clearwater , Florida . Scientology representatives in Clearwater complained to police in November 2000 about the picketing , and Christman and Minton were fined US $ 100 . On February 21 , 2001 , Judge Thomas E. <unk> dismissed other charges in the case , and criticized Scientology for its treatment of critics , commenting , " I 'm missing the point here . I hope someone will let us know when the great invasion is coming . " This experience was a defining period for Christman , as she was concerned that her former church would attempt to characterize her as a criminal . She maintained that the actions by representatives of Scientology against her were examples of the policy , " Fair Game " ; a form of retribution for criticizing the organization . 
 In 2008 , Christman was engaged in traveling around the world lecturing about Scientology and gave media interviews about the subject . In his 2008 book Tom Cruise : An Unauthorized Biography , author Andrew Morton thanked Christman in the acknowledgements section for advising him with regard to the jargon and complicated history of Scientology . In February 2008 , Christman appeared on the National Public Radio program Morning Edition in a piece about the protest movement against Scientology called Project Chanology started by the Internet @-@ based group Anonymous ; she said she objected to any illegal methods used , but appreciated new activists taking part in criticizing Scientology . Along with Scientology critic Mark Bunker , she took part in the international protests against the organization in 2008 as part of Project Chanology . Christman maintains an account on YouTube with the identification " <unk> " , where she posts topically about Scientology . Her YouTube account was briefly shut down in April 2008 around the time period that the same thing happened to Mark Bunker ; soon afterwards an unidentified individual posted to alt.religion.scientology and boasted of " silencing " Christman . Christman resided in Los Angeles , California in 2009 . The Sunday Times characterized Christman in a 2009 article as " a fierce critic of the church " .

 Luton released Holmes on 8 May 2007 following their relegation to League One , after he had spent nearly seven years with the club . He eventually signed for Rotherham United of League Two on a two @-@ year contract on 14 June 2007 . His debut for Rotherham was in a 0 – 0 draw against Hereford United on 10 August 2007 and he scored his first goal for the team against Notts County on 22 September with a 25 @-@ yard shot into the far corner . Holmes finished 2007 – 08 with 27 appearances and two goals . After making only one appearance during 2008 – 09 , he joined York City in the Conference Premier on a one @-@ month loan on 22 September 2008 and made his debut a day later in a 2 – 0 defeat to Kidderminster Harriers . He scored for the team in the following game with a six @-@ yard shot from a Craig Farrell pass , which finished as a 3 – 3 draw with Stevenage Borough . He suffered from a hip injury , which resulted him in missing York 's 3 – 1 defeat against Wrexham . His final game for York was a 2 – 0 victory against Rushden & Diamonds and he finished the loan spell with five appearances and one goal , before returning to Rotherham on 18 October 2008 after being recalled by the club . Weeks after returning to Rotherham , it was suggested that Holmes might be loaned out again after failing to break back into the team . It was over a month before Holmes eventually made his first appearance for Rotherham since returning , after starting in the 2 – 0 defeat at home to Bradford City on 21 November 2008 .

 = Interstate 780 = 
 Interstate 780 ( I @-@ 780 ) is an Interstate Highway in the San Francisco Bay Area of the U.S. state of California . It serves to connect Interstate 80 in Vallejo with Interstate 680 just north of the Benicia @-@ Martinez Bridge in Benicia . Originally , this segment was part of I @-@ 680 before that Interstate was extended and rerouted to Fairfield . The city @-@ maintained Curtola Parkway continues west from I @-@ 80 to State Route 29 in Vallejo . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The Interstate 780 state @-@ maintained freeway begins at Lemon Street and Curtola Parkway , quickly crossing underneath I @-@ 80 at a cloverleaf interchange . The freeway passes through parts of unincorporated Solano County , then heads southeast along the Benicia State Recreation Area ( a marsh ) . It then bypasses downtown Benicia through the hills to the north . I @-@ 780 ends at I @-@ 680 at the north end of the Benicia @-@ Martinez Bridge , with I @-@ 680 heading south through the East Bay to San Jose . 
 = = History = = 
 By 1914 , a paved county road connected Vallejo and Benicia north of the Carquinez Strait , following the present Maine Street , Benicia Road , Columbus Parkway , and K Street . Although state highways were designated to Benicia in 1910 ( Legislative Route ( LRN ) 7 , now I @-@ 680 ) and Vallejo in 1931 ( LRN 74 , now SR 29 ) , this connection was not added until 1935 , when LRN 74 ( an unsigned designation ) was extended east from Vallejo to Benicia and north along former Route 7 to Fairfield . ( A short spur connecting Vallejo to the Carquinez Bridge was added to Route 74 in 1937 . ) LRN 74 initially entered Benicia on K Street and left on East Fifth Street , making several turns in between . Two realignments were built in the 1940s , reducing the number of turns to one , at the corner of L and East Second Streets . 
 On September 15 , 1955 , the Bureau of Public Roads approved the Interstate Highway System spurs and connections in urban areas . Among these was a loop around the San Francisco Bay , soon numbered I @-@ 280 and I @-@ 680 . The east half ( I @-@ 680 ) incorporated a number of existing legislative routes , including Routes 69 , 108 , 107 , 75 , and 74 , crossing the Carquinez Strait on the proposed Benicia @-@ Martinez Bridge and ending at I @-@ 80 near downtown Vallejo . The first piece of this freeway north of the Carquinez Strait was at the I @-@ 80 cloverleaf interchange , built in the late 1950s when I @-@ 80 was upgraded through Vallejo . This was an extremely short roadway , beginning at Lemon Street , crossing under I @-@ 80 and Laurel Street , and ending at Reis Avenue and Cedar Street . In about 1960 , it was extended east to the old highway ( Columbus Parkway ) between the cities , and was completed to the new bridge in about 1962 , the year the bridge opened . 
 In the 1964 renumbering , the legislative designation of the completed Vallejo @-@ Benicia freeway was changed from Route 74 to Route 680 , reflecting its Interstate designation . The short piece of non @-@ freeway in Vallejo , extending west from I @-@ 80 to SR 29 , became State Route 141 . This route followed Benicia Road and Maine Street , the same alignment the state highway had always taken ; it initially connected with I @-@ 780 via Lemon Street , but later followed Benicia Road from I @-@ 80 north of I @-@ 780 . In 1975 , a proposed ( and never constructed ) extension west and north to SR 37 east of the Napa River was added to Route 141 . The route was to be the Waterfront Freeway , scaled down to a boulevard in 1974 . 
 The Federal Highway Administration approved a relocation of I @-@ 680 onto the State Route 21 freeway between Benicia and Fairfield in July 1973 . To keep the route to Vallejo in the Interstate system , it was renumbered I @-@ 780 ; the corresponding legislative changes were made in 1976 . As part of the project to construct a new northbound Benicia @-@ Martinez Bridge , the I @-@ 680 / I @-@ 780 interchange was rebuilt ; the new span opened in August 2007 . Route 141 was deleted from the state highway system in 1988 , soon after the city of Vallejo constructed Curtola Parkway over ( replacing Maryland Street ) just to the south , directly connecting I @-@ 780 with a surface road to SR 29 .

 = Hurricane Hazel = 
 Hurricane Hazel was the deadliest and costliest hurricane of the 1954 Atlantic hurricane season . The storm killed at least 400 people in Haiti before striking the United States near the border between North and South Carolina , as a Category 4 hurricane . After causing 95 fatalities in the US , Hazel struck Canada as an extratropical storm , raising the death toll by 81 people , mostly in Toronto . As a result of the high death toll and the damage caused by Hazel , its name was retired from use for North Atlantic hurricanes . 
 In Haiti , Hazel destroyed 40 % of the coffee trees and 50 % of the cacao crop , affecting the economy for several years to come . The hurricane made landfall in the Carolinas , and destroyed most waterfront dwellings near its point of impact . From North Carolina , it traveled north along the Atlantic coast . Hazel affected Virginia , West Virginia , Maryland , Delaware , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , and New York ; it brought gusts near 160 km / h ( 100 mph ) and caused $ 281 million ( 1954 USD ) in damage . When it was over Pennsylvania , Hazel consolidated with a cold front , and turned northwest towards Canada . When it hit Ontario as an extratropical storm , rivers and streams in and around Toronto , Ontario overflowed their banks , which caused severe flooding . As a result , many residential areas located in the local floodplains , such as the Raymore Drive area , were subsequently converted to parkland . In Canada alone , over C $ 135 million ( 2009 : $ 1 @.@ 1 billion ) of damage was incurred . 
 The effects of Hazel were particularly unprecedented in Toronto , as a result of a combination of a lack of experience in dealing with tropical storms and the storm 's unexpected retention of power . Hazel had traveled 1 @,@ 100 km ( 680 mi ) over land , but while approaching Canada , it had merged with an existing powerful cold front . The storm stalled over the Greater Toronto Area , and although it was now extratropical , it remained as powerful as a category 1 hurricane . To help with the cleanup , 800 members of the military were summoned , and a Hurricane Relief Fund was established that distributed $ 5 @.@ 1 million ( 2009 : $ 41 @.@ 7 million ) in aid . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On October 5 , a tropical wave with tropical @-@ storm force winds was approaching the Lesser Antilles . Due to the potential for tropical storm formation , a Hurricane Hunters plane flew from San Juan , Puerto Rico to investigate the system . When the plane reached the system , they observed a tropical cyclone about 30 mi ( 50 km ) east of the island of Grenada with winds estimated at 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) . The United States Weather Bureau promptly classified the system as Hurricane Hazel . The Atlantic hurricane reanalysis later assessed that Hazel developed at 06 : 00 UTC on October 5 about 220 mi ( 350 km ) east of Grenada . Although the Hurricane Hunters observed hurricane @-@ force winds , the storm had a small eye 5 mi ( 8 km ) in diameter and a central barometric pressure of 1 @,@ 002 mbar ( 29 @.@ 6 inHg ) . The 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) winds were therefore revised downward to 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) late on October 5 , though it was estimated that the storm attained hurricane status at 00 : 00 UTC on October 6 . At the same time , Hazel made landfall on Grenada with winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) . 
 After entering the Caribbean Sea , Hazel continued to present a small eye and wind diameter . The winds gradually increased as the storm moved westward , parallel to the northern Venezuela coast . On October 8 , the tiny eye increased to a diameter of 29 mi ( 46 km ) , while the winds reached 85 mph ( 135 km / h ) , although winds were estimated as high as 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) . That day , the Hurricane Hunters encountered severe turbulence , which hospitalized one crew member and injured another . For the next five days , there were no further flights into the core of the hurricane , although the planes continued to monitor the storm , with radar imagery indicating that the eye became open and ragged . Late on October 9 , it is estimated Hazel intensified into a major hurricane with winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) . Originally , it was estimated that Hazel attained these winds the day prior . The intensification was confirmed on October 10 , when aircraft noted a well @-@ defined eye on radar imagery . 
 On October 10 , Hazel slowed in the central Caribbean and turned sharply to the north @-@ northeast toward Hispaniola , steered by an upper @-@ level low . At 09 : 00 UTC on October 12 , the hurricane made landfall near <unk> along the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane wind scale . There were no strong wind readings at landfall , but based on previous radar and aircraft observations the sustained winds were officially estimated at 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) . After moving through the Gulf of Gonâve , Hazel struck northwestern Haiti near Baie @-@ de @-@ Henne at 00 : 00 UTC on October 13 , as a Category 2 hurricane with winds estimated at 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) . Around that time , the hurricane curved more to the north and northwest due to an approaching trough , and the Hurricane Hunters resumed entering the center of Hazel , reporting an eye and hurricane force winds . At 14 : 00 UTC on October 13 , Hazel struck Inagua in the Bahamas with winds of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) . 
 After affecting the Bahamas , Hazel accelerated northwest toward the southeastern United States , steered between a trough and a ridge . Hurricanes are generally expected to lose power after going north of Florida due to lower water temperatures , however , Hazel restrengthened as it tracked northward over the Gulf Stream . The Hurricane Hunters were unable to observe the core of the storm until it neared land , reporting an eye 18 mi ( 33 km ) in diameter on October 15 . Later that day , a ship just offshore South Carolina reported a central pressure of 938 mbar ( 27 @.@ 7 inHg ) , which was the lowest in association with the hurricane . At 15 : 30 UTC on October 15 , Hazel made landfall just west of the North Carolina / South Carolina border with a 40 mi ( 64 km ) eye , slightly northeast of Myrtle Beach in the latter state . Based on the pressure , a larger than average size , and the fast forward movement , the landfall intensity was estimated at 130 mph ( 215 km / h ) , or a Category 4 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale . 
 The eye of Hazel was tracked across several towns in North Carolina as the system continued northward . At 18 : 00 UTC on October 15 , the hurricane became extratropical near Raleigh , and within six hours had passed near Washington , D.C. The extratropical remnants of Hazel accelerated to the north through Pennsylvania and New York along an extended cold front . Despite widespread observations across the eastern United States , there was uncertainty in the track of Hazel as an extratropical storm . Although it was possible the original circulation dissipated over western Pennsylvania and a new one formed over western New York , the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis assessed the circulation as becoming elongated but continuous . On October 16 , the storm crossed into Ontario and over the Toronto region . Shortly thereafter , the former Hurricane Hazel dropped to gale @-@ force winds after moving almost almost 1 @,@ 000 km ( 620 mi ) over land . The storm slowed and turned northward , passing over James Bay early on October 17 . After turning to the northeast , the remnants of Hazel were absorbed by a larger extratropical storm over Canada on October 18 . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 On October 6 , small craft warnings were issued for the Dutch islands of Aruba , Bonaire , and Curaçao , despite predictions that Hazel would pass to the north ; these warnings were canceled a day later . After the storm had turned northward , tropical cyclone warnings were posted for Haiti , the Dominican Republic , and the waters of the Mona Passage . Small crafts near Jamaica were advised to head for port ahead of the storm . The U.S. Navy completed extensive preparations at its Guantanamo Bay base , ordering about 1 @,@ 000 civilians into fortified Quonset huts , flying aircraft out of the storm 's path , and positioning surface ships out at sea . 
 At on October 14 , the National Weather Bureau issued a warning for the Carolinas , with the caveat that the worst of the hurricane was expected to stay offshore . Instead , the storm took a northwest turn and headed toward land . By evening of the same day , the storm was forecast to make landfall near the Carolinas border . Further forecasts expected Hazel to lose its power and dissipate over the Allegheny Mountains . 
 In her book Hurricane Hazel , Betty Kennedy argues that in Canada , the impressions that Hazel was " the best @-@ kept secret in town " and that it was a " fully documented meteorological event that should have taken nobody by surprise " both " paradoxically [ ... ] contain a great deal of truth " . Meteorologists predicted that if Hazel merged with the cold front , the storm would not lose intensity , but would instead potentially strengthen . Two Special Weather Bulletins were issued by the Dominion Weather Office , but since it was expected that the storm would pass east of Toronto , few other warnings were given and there were no evacuations , which increased the eventual property damage and loss of life . The forecast called for high winds between 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) and 80 km / h ( 50 mph ) , with only occasional showers . On lakes Erie and Ontario , ships received warnings of strong winds , and the predicted wind speeds ranged from 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) to 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . Toronto Hydro had called in standby crews as heavy winds were forecast , although they were almost sent home at one point due to a lull in the storm . 
 There had been significant rainfall in the Toronto area in the two weeks prior to Hazel , so the ground was already saturated . Few people in Canada had any experience with hurricanes , since it was unheard of for them to travel as far north and inland as Toronto . Kennedy also notes that if " Toronto had been about to face a blizzard , or was threatened by a 14 @-@ inch [ 36 @-@ cm ] snowfall , that [ sic ] would have been something understandable . [ ... ] This was different . This was the unknown , the unfamiliar , the totally unexpected crisis . Hurricanes belonged in the tropics . "

 On October 8 , two crew members on Reconnaissance aircraft were injured due to turbulence while observing Hazel ; one was severely enough injured to require hospitalisation . The ABC Islands of Aruba , Bonaire and Curaçao , located north of Venezuela , received rough winds and rains of up to 9 @.@ 8 inches ( 250 mm ) when the intensifying cyclone passed to the north . Flash flooding in Aruba and Curaçao destroyed a bridge and several water dams and resulted in losses of $ 350 @,@ 000 ( 1954 USD ) . Puerto Rico suffered its worst flooding since 1899 as a result of the hurricane . Due to timely warnings , only nine people were killed : eight by drowning and one by a landslide ; however , infrastructure , buildings , and agricultural areas suffered serious damage , and over 11 @,@ 000 people were evacuated from flooded areas . 
 In Haiti , Hazel brought flash floods which destroyed numerous villages , and high winds which caused considerable damage to major cities . The death toll was estimated to be as high as 1 @,@ 000 people ; most of the casualties drowned when the water flowed in a flood down the mountains , some of which were as high as 2 @,@ 400 m ( 8 @,@ 000 ft ) . The situation was exacerbated by deforestation , which lessened the ability of the soil to hold water . Haiti 's South Peninsula took the brunt of the storm : the largest town , Aux Cayes , reported at least 200 casualties , while the second @-@ largest town of Jérémie was reported to have been washed in the sea , with at least 200 more casualties . Damage in Aux Cayes was estimated to be $ 500 @,@ 000 ( 1954 USD ) . Estimates of people left homeless in the wake of Hazel are as high as 100 @,@ 000 . Hazel destroyed about 40 % of the coffee trees and 50 % of the cacao crop , affecting the country 's economy for several years . Objects from Haiti , such as bowls , were reported to have been transported by the hurricane to the Carolinian coast . 
 West of Haiti , the hurricane brought hurricane @-@ force winds to Cuba . A fisherman on the eastern tip of Cuba was killed by rough seas while trying to secure his boats . Since the hurricane passed largely east of the Bahamas , only minor damage was reported there . Hazel passed directly over Inagua , where it claimed six lives when a sailboat capsized while taking shelter from the storm . 
 = = = United States = = = 
 In South Carolina , the storm produced 10 – 11 ft ( 3 @.@ 0 – 3 @.@ 4 m ) tides along the coast . Hundreds of buildings were destroyed , including about 80 % of waterfront dwellings in Myrtle Beach . As a result of the high storm surge , the low @-@ lying sandy barrier islands were completely flooded . Two piers in Myrtle Beach were damaged . In North Myrtle Beach , a 3 @-@ story hotel and a 800 ft ( 240 m ) pier were washed out to sea . At Cherry Grove Beach , 75 residences were demolished , while at <unk> Island , 40 homes were destroyed , while numerous others were damaged . One death occurred in South Carolina . Damage in the state totaled about $ 27 million . 
 At landfall , the hurricane brought a storm surge of over 5 @.@ 5 m ( 18 ft ) to a large area of coastline , producing severe coastal damage ; the damage was greater since the hurricane coincided with the highest lunar tide of the year . Brunswick County , North Carolina , suffered the heaviest damage , where most coastal dwellings were either destroyed or severely damaged . For example , in Long Beach , North Carolina , only five of the 357 buildings were left standing . The official report from the Weather Bureau in Raleigh , North Carolina stated that as a result of Hazel , " all traces of civilization on the immediate waterfront between the state line and Cape Fear were practically annihilated . " According to NOAA , " every pier in a distance of 170 miles [ 270 kilometres ] of coastline was demolished " . 
 At the Raleigh @-@ Durham Airport in North Carolina , gusts of 90 mph ( 140 km / h ) were recorded ; in surrounding cities , including Kinston , Goldsboro , and Faison , wind gusts were estimated to have reached 120 mph ( 190 km / h ) . With such high winds state @-@ wide , heavy damage was caused to forests , and to property as a result of falling trees . However , since the Carolinas , like the rest of the Southeastern United States , were suffering from a severe drought , the heavy rainfall brought by Hazel was welcome . In North Carolina , the most rain was received in the interior of the state : Robbins received 286 mm ( 11 @.@ 3 in ) of rain , and Carthage received 247 mm ( 9 @.@ 7 in ) . 
 Nineteen people were killed in North Carolina , with several hundred more injured ; 15 @,@ 000 homes were destroyed and another 39 @,@ 000 were damaged . The number of people left homeless by the storm was " uncounted thousands " . Damages in the Carolinas amounted to $ 163 million , with $ 61 million incurred by beachfront property . Total damage in the United States ranged from $ 281 million to $ 308 million . 
 While Hazel caused the most damage in the Carolinas , the storm did not lose all of its intensity . Going north , Hazel turned extratropical by midday when it merged with a cold front ; however , it retained hurricane @-@ strength winds and it was continuing to drop heavy rainfall . 
 In Virginia , wind gusts of over 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) were observed at the Weather Bureau office in Norfolk . Roofs were blown off , trees and power lines were toppled , windows were shattered , and awnings were torn . The naval station suffered mainly minor damage to its temporary installations . The tugboat Indian , carrying five barges , sank in the James River ; four of the eight crew members drowned . One building was demolished and several others were damaged in Portsmouth . The ferry Princess Anne was beached into the docks at <unk> . An unfinished vessel at the Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News broke from its moorings and was swept into the shore of the James River . The roof of the Custom house was detached and landed on the street . In Richmond , 200 store fronts were damaged , while part of the steeple at Trinity Methodist Church was toppled . Additionally , a 150 ft ( 46 m ) microwave tower in Warsaw was knocked over . Approximately 50 % of residents in Virginia lost telephone and electrical service for six days . The storm damaged approximately 18 @,@ 000 homes and businesses . Overall , there were 12 deaths and about $ 15 million in damage . 
 After North Carolina , the storm went through Virginia , West Virginia , Maryland , Delaware , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , and New York . In general , power was knocked out and trees were downed . Wind gusts throughout the area reached 160 km / h ( 99 mph ) . Though not near the center , a gust of 182 km / h ( 113 mph ) was recorded in Battery Park , the highest wind speed ever recorded within the municipal boundaries of New York City . 
 Rain amounts were heavier on the western side of the storm . In West Virginia , the average amount of rain received was 230 mm ( 9 in ) with localized amounts of 300 mm ( 12 in ) reported in the Appalachians . To the north in Pittsburgh , only 90 mm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) of rain was reported . 
 To the east , the Washington , D.C. area was particularly affected , and considerable flooding was reported in Virginia and Maryland . Much of the grounds of the Naval Academy in Annapolis , MD were flooded and the Midshipmen were put to work the next day cleaning up debris . New Jersey escaped major flooding as the high tide was low enough , but to the south in Chesapeake Bay , the majority of crab pots were destroyed . Hazel lost a considerable amount of moisture when crossing the Allegheny Mountains , which raised rivers and streams in the Pittsburgh area significantly above the flood mark . In Pennsylvania , the winds were still high enough to <unk> several homes . 
 In upstate New York , the storm blocked highways and railroads .

 After weeks of unusually high rainfall saturated the Greater Toronto Area , Hazel dropped additional rainfall , peaking at 8 @.@ 4 in ( 214 mm ) in Snelgrove , Ontario . In three hours , the city received 3 @.@ 5 in ( 90 mm ) of precipitation . Most of these rains ran off into rivers and creeks of Toronto , which raised water levels by as much as 20 – 26 ft ( 6 – 8 m ) . Not built to withstand heavy flooding , Toronto 's infrastructure took a heavy hit : over 50 bridges , many parts of important highways , as well as numerous roads and railways were destroyed when the high water washed them out or carried debris and smashed them . 
 Floodwaters slowly rose in Holland Marsh – a bowl @-@ shaped valley near Bradford – allowing people to escape to the town . Highway 400 , which passes through the marsh , was under as much as 10 ft ( 3 m ) of water in some places when as much 6 m ( 20 ft ) of water backed up . Much of the crops in the area were either swept away or ruined . After the water pumps failed due to debris , better equipment allowed the Holland Marsh to be drained by November 13 . The Humber River in the west end of Toronto caused the most destruction as a result of an intense flash flood , after most minor rivers and creeks drained into it . A team of five volunteer firefighters were killed when their fire truck was swept away as they were responding to help a stranded motorist . Communities in the Humber floodplain were devastated . At Woodbridge , the river swelled from its usual width of 20 to 107 m ( 66 to 351 ft ) at its narrowest point , and left hundreds homeless and nine dead . The Humber swept away 366 m ( 1 @,@ 201 ft ) of Raymore Drive and 14 nearby homes , killing 35 people out of the 81 Canadian fatalities . The rise of the river was unprecedented and the residents did not evacuate , which led to the high death toll . The Etobicoke Creek also overflowed its banks at the village of Long Branch , killing seven people after many dwellings were swept into Lake Ontario . 
 The death toll of 81 people has not since been equaled by a natural disaster in Canada . In addition to the casualties , over 4 @,@ 000 families were left homeless . The Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada estimates the total cost of Hurricane Hazel for Canada , taking into account long @-@ term effects such as economic disruption , the cost of lost property , and recovery costs , to be C $ 137 @,@ 552 @,@ 400 .

 In the aftermath of Hazel , a three @-@ day period of national mourning was declared in Haiti for hurricane victims . With existing infrastructure already poor , the recovery was very slow since many of the few existing roads were blocked , and communications equipment was either out , damaged , or destroyed . The Haitian Red Cross appealed for assistance to the International Red Cross , while the American Red Cross made a donation of $ 25 @,@ 000 ( 1954 USD ) . Pan American World Airways offered the use of its planes to assist with the delivery of aid , and the US aircraft carrier USS Saipan deployed 18 helicopters to help deliver supplies . Despite the relief effort , there was an outbreak of typhoid fever following Hazel due to a lack of clean water . 
 = = = United States = = = 
 In the Carolinas , the National Guard was mobilised by the evening of October 15 to prevent looting along affected areas of the coastline . On October 17 , President Dwight D. Eisenhower declared a " major disaster " in the Carolinas , and offered " immediate and unlimited federal assistance . " Recovery was quick , and by October 24 , all but two units were demobilised . Another concern was the rebuilding of the sand dunes along waterfronts . An artificial sand dune barrier , 39 km ( 24 mi ) long , was completed by October 30 , which in the long run led to a more rapid natural build @-@ up of larger dunes . With Myrtle Beach a popular tourist destination , the Chamber of Commerce began an information campaign to inform the public , which might have erroneously concluded from the massive media coverage that the city had been destroyed , that the city would be ready for the coming summer . The rebuilding after the partial destruction would transform Myrtle Beach from a " quaint summer colony to a high @-@ rise resort city " .

 The army sent about 800 soldiers to Toronto to assist with the cleanup , providing blankets and mattresses . Toronto residents helped out with the relief effort : the Salvation Army received so many donations of clothes , footwear , blankets , food , and money that its storage facilities were overfilled , forcing it to advise against further donations until they were needed . A Hurricane Relief Fund was established to coordinate financial donations , ultimately raising about $ 5 @.@ 3 million ( CAD ) . The fund received donations from organisations , companies , and individuals including Pope Pius XII , the Ford Motor Company , the United Church of Canada , Laura Secord Candy Shops , and the British @-@ American Oil Company . A portion of the fund was set aside as a contingency reserve in the event of unresolved claims and also toward administrative expenses . 
 The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority was created after the storm to manage the area 's floodplains and rivers , such as building dams . The heavily flooded areas were expropriated and barred from rebuilding homes , and most of the land was later converted into an extensive park system along Toronto 's rivers .

 " Criminal " was written in 2008 by Max Martin , Shellback and Tiffany Amber , and was produced by Martin and Shellback . Spears told MTV News that after she first listened to the song , she felt it was different and unlike anything she had heard before . In an interview with Rolling Stone , Spears spoke about Martin 's productions on Femme Fatale , saying , " Max played a huge role on this album and he has been there since the beginning so there is such a huge level of trust . He gets exactly what I am saying when I tell him what I want and don ’ t want musically " . Spears recorded her vocals at Maratone Studios in Stockholm , Sweden . The track was later mixed by Serban Ghenea at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach , Virginia . It was registered on Broadcast Music Incorporated under the legal title " In Love With a Criminal " .

 " Criminal " is a guitar @-@ driven midtempo track which incorporates a folk @-@ style flute melody . Erin Thompson of the Seattle Weekly said the song " takes a breather from aggressive , wall @-@ to @-@ wall synths , driven instead by a steady guitar rhythm and an oddly Asian folky @-@ sounding flute melody . " . The radio edit changes the drums to be louder , among various other instrumental changes . It is considered the only ballad of the album . Thompson compared it to her past ballads , saying it is not " sappy " like " I 'm Not a Girl , Not Yet a Woman " ( 2002 ) and not " teary @-@ sad " like " Everytime " ( 2004 ) . " Criminal " is reminiscent of the music of ABBA and Madonna , and the latter 's albums Ray of Light ( 1998 ) and American Life ( 2003 ) , according to David Buchanan of Consequence of Sound and Samesame.com.au , respectively . The beat was compared by Keith Caufield of Billboard to Madonna 's " Don 't Tell Me " ( 2000 ) . Carl Wilson of the Los Angeles Times said " Criminal " is " awkwardly pitched between rock and ballad " . The use of the flute was compared by Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush to the sample of " The Lonely Goatherd " from The Sound of Music ( 1959 ) on Gwen Stefani 's " Wind It Up " ( 2006 ) . 
 In the verses , Spears sings about being in love with a bad boy and outlaw , in lyrics such as " He is a hustler / He 's no good at all / He is a loser , he 's a bum , bum , bum , bum " and " He is a bad boy with a tainted heart / And even I know this ain 't smart " . During the chorus , she pleads to her mother not to worry in lines such as " But mama I 'm in love with a criminal " and " Mama please don 't cry / I will be alright . " Andrew Leahey of The Washington Times and Erin Thompson of the Seattle Weekly compared the lyrics to those of Madonna 's " Papa Don 't Preach " ( 1986 ) , while David <unk> compared them to Coolio 's " Mama I 'm in Love Wit ' a Gangsta " ( 1994 ) . The words in the chorus end in ' al 's syllables , as evident in lyrics such as " And this type of love isn 't rational / It 's physical " . Keith Caufield noted that they were an unintentional nod to Supertramp 's " The Logical Song " ( 1979 ) . Thompson stated that Spears 's vocals are less processed than on the rest of the album , while according to Amy Sciarretto they are " heavily auto @-@ tuned and studio @-@ treated , [ ... ] she delivers her lines in a monotone , robotic fashion . "

 Criminal received positive reviews from music critics . Andy Gill of The Independent called it one of the highlights of Femme Fatale , along with " Till the World Ends " . Gill also said that the album sounds more programmed than natural , commenting that " indeed , such is the shock when the final track , ' Criminal ' , opens with a little folksong @-@ style flute and guitar figure that one 's immediate reaction is that a <unk> <unk> has been accidentally appended to Britney 's running @-@ order . " Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush gave the song four stars , explaining that " Only Brit can make a flute sound sexy . Seriously , few pop stars can pull off a flute and Brit does it with ease . " Aaron @-@ Spencer Charles of Metro said that " the verses , chorus and bridge all work perfectly for Ms. Spears , showing that she still has it from all those years ago . " Erin Thompson of the Seattle Weekly called it her best vocal performance of the album , and added that " it has a spark and a mischievous sass to it – and these days anytime Britney shows even just a bit of her old liveliness and independence , we like it . " Rudy Klapper of Sputnikmusic commented the song " isn 't exactly the progressive stylings of a Janelle Monae [ sic ] , but damn if it ’ s not catchy and interesting . " The A.V. Club 's Genevieve Koski claimed that the album " [ i ] s not all dance @-@ floor narcotics " , adding that " Inside Out " , " Till the World Ends " and " Criminal " " add texture to the wall @-@ to @-@ wall synth waves and booty bass . " Robert Copsey of Digital Spy said the production of Femme Fatale is " polished , intriguing and – best of all – fun " , exemplifying " Inside Out " , the piano breakdown in " Big Fat Bass " and the flute in " Criminal " . 
 No Ripcord 's Gary McGinley stated that Femme Fatale " is so synth @-@ led that hearing the simple guitar lines on Criminal and He 's About To Lose Me ( from the Deluxe Edition ) is refreshing . " Natalie Shaw of the BBC Online commented that " Criminal " " with its teenage lyrics [ ... ] on top of a fairytale flute melody and a rhythm so summery it manages to completely set itself free from the rest of the album . " David Buchanan of Consequence of Sound found that Femme Fatale " is entirely rescued by backtracking to Circus @-@ style material , with Rihanna @-@ esque ' Gasoline ' , and the Ray Of Light @-@ era Madonna influence in closing song ' Criminal ' . Katherine St Asaph of Popdust said that as " a bad @-@ boy track , it at least makes a bit more lyrical sense than ' Judas ' and is more vulnerable than her past few singles , which is probably a good career move . " Keith Caufield of Billboard commented that " while some of the lyrics are a teensy clunky at times – [ it ] is a fitting closer to a nearly @-@ completely excellent album . " Los Angeles Times writer Carl Wilson stated that the album 's momentum " flags only on the closing ' Criminal ' , with its formless Renaissance fair flute line and a tempo [ that is ] joyless " . Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times considered " Criminal " , along with " Inside Out " , " weak mid @-@ tempo fare " songs . Eric R. Danton of the Hartford Courant deemed the song as " an eye @-@ rolling homage to those oh @-@ so @-@ attractive bad boys that good girls lust for in spite of themselves . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine , senior editor of Allmusic , called it " a lousy song " .

 At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards , Spears said to MTV News that she had thought of a " really cool concept for the video , just to make it interesting . You 'll have to see . " She then contacted Chris Marrs Piliero , who directed the music video for her previous single " I Wanna Go " , to work with her . She told him the basic story she had planned , which he described as a " fairy @-@ tale , sweet , knight @-@ in @-@ shining @-@ armor feel to it . I said let 's take that and make the fairy tale badass . " Spears also wanted her real @-@ life boyfriend Jason Trawick to play the criminal . Marrs Piliero was initially hesitant to cast Trawick feeling that a professional actor would do a better job , but did not talk to Spears about it . He told USA Today , " When you 're doing nudity , I don 't think it was at the top of Britney 's list to bring in some random guy while her boyfriend watches . [ ... ] We definitely wanted to make some passionate , steamy scenes , but we also wanted it to be intensely beautiful . We didn 't want to go for raunchy . We wanted it to be sensual and steamy . " On September 6 , 2011 , Spears announced through her Twitter account that she had decided to shoot the video " in the streets of merry old England when I get there . " In an interview with AOL , she explained , " I 've never shot on location out of the country of America for a video . So , it should be very interesting . It was partly my idea ... to see if it could to happen , and they were like , ' Yeah , it 's a great idea , ' so we did it . "

 The video begins at a formal party in which Spears seems to be looking for someone . The opening shot of her was inspired by the scene of Jennifer Love Hewitt walking into the party in Can 't Hardly Wait ( 1998 ) . Her boyfriend ( Bradshaw ) talks with two people next to her . He persuades her to smile to avoid embarrassment from the guests then verbally abuses her and grabs her face , after which she leaves to the restroom , where she wipes away a tear and puts on her fragrance Radiance . She comes back to the party and catches her boyfriend flirting with another woman ; Spears tells her " So you 're not working the street corner tonight I see ? " , making her boyfriend angry . He apologizes to the other woman for his girlfriend 's remark then grabs Spears by the arm and carries her outside the building . After he slaps her , one of the waiters of the party ( Trawick ) wearing a leather jacket punches her boyfriend several times . The waiter asks Spears if she is okay , and after she kicks her boyfriend in the crotch goodbye , she replies " Now I 'm okay . " She and the waiter climb on his motorcycle and leave the scene . When they get to his house , it is revealed by a newspaper that he is a criminal . She opens one of the lockers in his house and finds a gun , after which the couple kisses . This is followed by scenes of them having sex . 
 The next morning , the criminal brings Spears breakfast to the bed and kisses her on the forehead . He has several tattoos in his body , including one on his chest that reads " R.I.P. Goose " , a reference to the film Top Gun ( 1986 ) . They go to a convenience store where she steals vanilla candles and points the gun to the employee ; the criminal takes money out of the cash register and they escape by stealing a Citroën <unk> . The robbery is caught by the security cameras , and pictures of the couple appear on the local news . There are scenes of them having sex in the shower . As they change clothes , several policemen then appear outside the criminal 's house ; they start shooting it with Heckler & Koch MP5 's as Spears and the man embrace , kissing passionately . The policemen then enter the house , and one of them confirms that the couple escaped . The video ends with Spears and the criminal escaping on the motorcycle as the credits roll . One of them reads " No vanilla candles were harmed in the making of this music video . " The video also includes intercut scenes of Spears performing dance moves similar to voguing .

 After pictures of Spears and Trawick carrying replica guns on set surfaced online , the Hackney London Borough Council criticized her for " promoting gun violence " , since the area had been badly affected by the 2011 England riots . The Council told London Tonight that they had not agreed to the use of replica guns at Stoke Newington Town Hall , and that they would be raising the matter with the production company . Councillor Ian Rathbone added that Spears should apologize and make a sizeable donation to a Hackney charity " for the rudeness and damage she 's done to this community . " When asked if she thought the council was overreacting , Hackney MP Diane Abbott insisted : " It is only a music video but it 's images like this , with popstars <unk> gangs , which means that some young people ... get drawn in . Britney should really know better . " Rae Alexandra of the SF Weekly explained that the United Kingdom " is not a place that readily embraces guns . Rather , it 's a place where guns are rare , gun licensing is tightly controlled , and the entire establishment has been in a panic about gun use on its streets for the last three years . " On September 26 , 2011 , Spears ' representatives released a statement to MTV News saying , " The video is a fantasy story featuring Britney 's boyfriend , Jason Trawick , which literally plays out the lyrics of a song written three years before the riots ever happened . " The production company apologized to the Council before the release of the video . Marrs Piliero stated about the controversy , 
 " Holding the gun became a controversial thing ' cause we filmed it in London , and they don 't have a lot of gun use out there . That doesn 't mean that there 's no gun use , so I did find it really interesting . For me , the thing is , it blew me away that members of [ the British ] Parliament were speaking about this . One , because it 's a music video , and two , because don 't you guys have television shows out there that show crime ? It 's really strange to me . I don 't understand why pop stars are put on such a high pedestal over other celebrities . Why do members of Parliament feel that they need to scrutinize her for having a gun , and ' She 's in the public , ' and ' She should know better , ' and ' She 's a role model , ' but what about every other celebrity out there ? What about every other actor ? That 's very strange to me . I was really surprised at how much the gun use was scrutinized . [ Trawick plays ] a professional criminal , so it makes sense he has a gun . We shouldn 't censor ourselves . "

 The video was ranked at number ten on a list of the ten most controversial music videos in pop music by AOL on September 29 , 2011 . Spears announced through her Twitter account on October 13 , 2011 , that the video would be released the following week . On October 17 , 2011 , she posted five GIF files with scenes from the video on her Tumblr . The video was released the same day on the iTunes Store ; it reached the top position on its chart within minutes . Becky Bain of Idolator called it " an epic mini @-@ movie , full of romance , intrigue [ ... ] [ with ] a whole lot of unnecessary PDA between Brit and her beau . It was full of passion , joy and just a little touch of madness — just like its star . " Bain also noted several influences , such as Alfred Hitchcock films and the music videos for Spears ' " Toxic " ( 2004 ) and Green Day ’ s " 21 Guns " ( 2009 ) . A writer for Rolling Stone also compared it to a Hitchcock film and deemed the opening scene as " a tribute to Old Hollywood " . The reviewer found the scenes of physical abuse " surprising " and called the acting " stiff " , but said that " from there on out , we 're in the usual comfort zone of a Britney video – sexy dancing , sexy vamping – with the added bonus of gratuitous PDA between the pop star and her real @-@ life boyfriend . " 
 USA Today 's Ann Oldenburg described the video as sexy and " pretty personal . " Kenneth Partridge of AOL commented , " Packed with sex , violence and questionable acting , the new Britney Spears video , ' Criminal , ' has all the trappings of a midnight movie . " A reporter from the American edition of The Huffington Post said : " We can 't honestly remember the last time Britney Spears looked so gorgeous in a music video " and deemed it as the best video from Femme Fatale . Erin Strecker Entertainment Weekly also called it the best video of the album , and highlighted Spears ' look , the ending scene and the " fun story " . Katherine St Asaph of Popdust said it is " probably the best video of the Femme Fatale era . " Tom Townshend of MSN stated that although the video was not appropriate for Spears ' younger fans , " [ it ] is actually rather compelling and feels more like a short film rather than a pop starlet 's music video . " A writer for VH1 said that part of the reason the video works is the comic sensibility between Spears and Marrs Piliero , explaining that " [ it ] point [ s ] to one of Spears 's greatest talents : giving the impression that although she takes her career extremely seriously , she nevertheless doesn 't take it too seriously . " The critic summarized the review by saying that the video is " entertaining [ as ] a bad @-@ girl adventure story , and her role here is essentially that of a ( wait for it ) femme fatale . " 
 Critics also commented on the Hackney controversy . Sarah Dean of the UK edition of The Huffington Post said : " If having a blonde , leather @-@ clad superstar brandishing a gun at a shop owner 's face isn 't <unk> violence , I 'm not sure what is " and added that , in essence , the video " seems more like an opportunity for her to live out her sexual fantasies than anything beneficial to music fans . " Amanda Dobbins of New York stated that " After viewing the final product , we 're guessing [ the local officials ] probably won 't be down with the shower sex , the regular sex , the domestic abuse , the armed robbery , or any of Britney 's other questionable activities , either . " Katherine St Asaph of Popdust joked about the situation , saying , " Britney Spears ’ video for ' Criminal ' is out , and gang recruitment is already up 200 % since 8 a.m. ! This has not happened . " Marianne Garvey of the UK website of E ! Online said , " With the ' fantasy ' getting so hot and heavy and Britney stripping down to nothing , the guns are the last thing you notice . "

 Alyssa Rosenberg of <unk> said that although it is common to see pop stars being assaulted by men in their videos — exemplifying Rihanna 's " Man Down " — the public is aware of Spears 's vulnerability , explaining that " we believe she really would choose a guy who would do something like this to her . " Rosenberg also stated even though her bad behaviour once she leaves her boyfriend is not directed at him , the fact that he treated her badly is a form of narrative permission for her to rob a store and have sex with the criminal . She also commented that the same narrative works on her previous video with Marrs Piliero for " I Wanna Go " . The video received comparisons to Rihanna 's " We Found Love " , which was released two days after " Criminal " , on October 19 , 2011 . Among the similarities , critics noted that they were both filmed in the United Kingdom and arose controversy in the country ; both contain scenes of sex , violence and crime ; both feature bad boy archetypes and both evoke the personal lives of the artists . Katherine St Asaph found the opening line of Spears 's boyfriend ( " Would you try smiling just once ? " ) a subtle dig at the press . She explained that there is a tendency among writers and spectators to call " her every smile plastered on or conservator @-@ mandated " , and that the fact the line is delivered by her abusive boyfriend only makes it more evident . According to her , that there are two contradictory ways to analyze the relationship between Spears and Trawick as the criminal : it could be seen as him luring her into her life , but Spears is the one that kisses him and she is the first to pull the gun . 
 St Asaph explained that the only interpretation of the video lies on the opinion of each viewer about Spears 's personal life , and how active a role each person imagines she plays in it . It was noted by St Asaph that although most pop stars release videos that draw from their personal lives , they do not make the viewer uncomfortable . The same cannot be said for Spears and Rihanna , and it does not matter if they themselves have moved on from past situations , because the discussion around them has not . St Asaph also expressed that neither Spears or Rihanna said much about the parallels to their lives , but that they do not need to : their videos are much more effective than anything they could reveal in an interview . Rae Alexandra of the SF Weekly also compared it to " We Found Love " , saying that both videos feature an anti @-@ British sentiment . She wrote that all the villains in the video – her boyfriend and the policemen – are British , whereas her savior in the video is an American criminal . Alexandra noted that Spears and Rihanna chose to films their " grittiest videos " in a country with a lower crime rate than the United States , that is also so against guns that politicians felt the need to talk about it . According to her , the videos continue with a xenophobic portrayal of British people as villains by American pop culture .

 " Deep Blue " is a song by English musician George Harrison , released as the B @-@ side to his 1971 charity single " Bangla Desh " . Harrison wrote the song in 1970 , midway through the recording sessions for All Things Must Pass , and recorded it in Los Angeles the following year while organising the Concert for Bangladesh . The composition was inspired by the deteriorating condition of his mother , Louise , before she succumbed to cancer in July 1970 , and by Harrison 's feelings of helplessness as he visited her in hospital in the north of England . Given the subject matter of his lyrics , " Deep Blue " also served to convey the suffering endured by the millions of refugees from war @-@ torn Bangladesh in 1971 , as sickness and disease became widespread among their makeshift camps in northern India . 
 Following Harrison 's work with American guitarist David Bromberg , " Deep Blue " features sparse instrumentation in the folk @-@ blues style . It includes one of Harrison 's first uses of dobro on a recording . The song proved popular on US radio and was listed with the A @-@ side when " Bangla Desh " peaked at number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart . 
 Well regarded by music critics and commentators , " Deep Blue " was unavailable officially for 35 years after this non @-@ album single , during which it gained a reputation as an overlooked B @-@ side . The re @-@ release came in September 2006 , when EMI included the song as a bonus track on the reissue of Harrison 's Living in the Material World album . 
 = = Background = = 
 George Harrison 's inspiration for writing " Deep Blue " was the fatal illness of his mother , Louise . The youngest of her four children , Harrison often credited his mother with encouraging his music career from a young age , and a sense of individuality generally . Although a practising Catholic , she instilled in all her children the importance of spirituality over religion , a trait that was influential in Harrison 's embracing of Hinduism in 1966 . Louise was also diligent in replying to her son 's fan mail and , in the words of music journalist John Harris , she " stood alone among the Beatle parents as an active champion of their talents " . 
 Harrison discussed the song at length in a 1987 interview for Musician magazine , during which he recalls that his mother developed a brain tumour late in 1969 but then recovered for seven months . After hearing of the initial diagnosis in September 1969 , Harrison cancelled a recording session with Apple Records artist Jackie Lomax to see her ; author Peter Doggett comments that , because of the severity of this news , Harrison would later have no recollection of how he heard of John Lennon 's decision to leave the Beatles , on 20 September . 
 Although Louise 's cancer had gone into remission , it returned in the spring of 1970 . Exhausted from nursing her , Harrison 's father , Harry , was then also hospitalised . As a result , their youngest son was " running back and forth " between Warrington and London while trying to record his first post @-@ Beatles solo album , All Things Must Pass . Adding to the strain , Harrison would also tell Musician , he was having to assure each of his parents that the other one was okay . On 4 July , the day that his song " Something " won an Ivor Novello award , Harrison put his solo album on hold and drove north to see Louise for the last time . In his Musician interview , Harrison says that he wrote " Deep Blue " " at home one exhausted morning " during this period . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Musically , the song is in the folk @-@ blues style . Author Simon Leng notes " Deep Blue " as a comparatively rare foray into the genre for Harrison , along with " Sue Me , Sue You Blues " , a song he wrote in early 1971 in response to Paul McCartney 's lawsuit to dissolve the Beatles ' partnership . Leng attributes the folk @-@ blues influence primarily to Bob Dylan and American roots guitarist David Bromberg , the latter of whom Harrison had met in New York , through Dylan , shortly before beginning work on All Things Must Pass . Another Harrison biographer , Ian Inglis , writes that the style of " Deep Blue " ' s " easy , unpretentious melody " is equally influenced by the Lovin ' Spoonful . Harrison recalled the mix of major and minor chords as reflecting the " frustration and gloom " he experienced while visiting his mother in the cancer ward . 
 In what Inglis describes as a " poignant contrast " with the composer 's Beatles track " Here Comes the Sun " , Harrison sings that the sunshine brings him no relief , but instead leaves him " suffering in the darkness " , which is " so easy come by on the roadside of one long lifetime " . In his autobiography , I , Me , Mine , Harrison says of the mood he captured in the song : " it 's that smell and the whole atmosphere of doom that 's in those hospitals . " 
 The lyrics bear out the powerlessness he felt while someone dear to him died , specifically in the second verse : 
 When you stand there , watch tired bodies 
 Full of sickness and pain to show you 
 Just how helpless you really are ... 
 Harrison was at Louise 's bedside until her death on 7 July . According to Rolling Stone contributor Mikal Gilmore , he read passages to her from a text about the Bhagavad Gita , " commenting on the sacred book 's views of death as a changeover rather than a termination " . In " Deep Blue " ' s final verse , Harrison 's lyrics likewise focus on spirituality : 
 When I think of the life I 'm living 
 Pray God help me , give me your light 
 So I can love you and understand 
 This repetition that keeps me here feeling deep blue ... 
 Harrison was alone with his mother at the end , author Joshua Greene writes , and when she began to slip into unconsciousness , he " put down the book and began chanting softly into her ear " . Inglis views the lyrics to " Deep Blue " as exemplifying Harrison 's " fondness for family " . Pattie Boyd , Harrison 's wife at the time , recalls that Louise had withheld the seriousness of her condition from him for eight weeks before September 1969 , " in case George was busy " with his career , and that , following her death , Harrison was anxious about how his father would manage alone . Keen to strengthen the familial bond , Harrison invited his brothers Harold and Pete to live on his Friar Park estate in Oxfordshire , along with their father .

 Within a year of Louise Harrison 's death , Harry was staying in Los Angeles with Harrison and Boyd , while Harrison worked with Ravi Shankar on the soundtrack to the film Raga . A Bengali Hindu , Shankar was distraught at the news of the humanitarian disaster then occurring in East Pakistan , following the outbreak of the Bangladesh Liberation War in March 1971 . After fleeing the war zone in their homeland , an estimated 7 million refugees were being accommodated in inadequate camps in India , where diseases such as cholera had become rife . Shankar later recalled that Harrison was deeply moved by his request for help in aiding the Bengali refugees , as a result of which he committed to staging the Concert for Bangladesh in New York that summer . Author Elliot Huntley suggests that , having been incapable of assuaging his mother 's pain as she lay dying in 1970 , Harrison gained extra motivation from " a situation his fame and commercial cache could do something to alleviate " . 
 As a B @-@ side for the hastily written " Bangla Desh " , which he composed to bring attention to the cause , Harrison chose to record " Deep Blue " . In the Bangladesh context of 1971 , author Bruce Spizer writes , the song made a suitable , " intimately chilling " companion to the hard @-@ charging lead track . Harrison recorded " Deep Blue " in Los Angeles , at the Record Plant West on 4 – 5 July , while organising the benefit concerts to be held at New York 's Madison Square Garden on 1 August . 
 In contrast with the extravagant sound normally associated with co @-@ producer Phil Spector 's work , " Deep Blue " received a sparse musical arrangement . <unk> by Jim Keltner 's kick drum , the recording features three distinctive guitar parts , all performed by Harrison – two finger @-@ picked acoustic guitars , along with fills played on a dobro . Leng cites Bromberg 's influence again in Harrison 's acoustic guitar playing on the track and considers the American guitarist to have been Harrison 's inspiration for adopting the dobro , the two musicians having recently collaborated on " The <unk> " for Bromberg 's debut solo album . The dobro had since become " something of a party piece for him " , Leng writes , as " Deep Blue " preceded 1971 releases by John Lennon , Gary Wright and Billy Preston that each featured Harrison " cameos " on the instrument . 
 The only other musician on the session for " Deep Blue " , bassist Klaus Voormann , recalls that he , Harry Harrison and Memphis producer Don Nix then travelled to Nashville and explored the American South , before heading to New York for the concert rehearsals . " Deep Blue " appeared on Harrison 's initial setlist at the rehearsals , but was not performed at either of the two Concert for Bangladesh shows . 
 = = Release = = 
 Apple Records issued the " Bangla Desh " / " Deep Blue " single on 28 July 1971 in the United States ( as Apple 1836 ) and 30 July in Britain ( R <unk> ) . Before then , Apple 's US distributor , Capitol Records , had manufactured one @-@ sided promo discs , featuring just " Bangla Desh " , with the result that the lead side had already received considerable airplay in the build @-@ up to the concerts . The release was accompanied by a trade advertisement that reflected the emotion conveyed in " Deep Blue " , of someone watching a loved one " waste away " , Spizer writes ; in this case , the image depicted a mother attempting to comfort her starving child . 
 The B @-@ side was a popular track in its own right at the time of release . In his 1987 feature on Harrison , in Musician , music journalist Timothy White described the song as having been " a jukebox favorite in bars in the [ United ] States " . By 11 September , when the single reached its peak position on America 's Billboard Hot 100 , at number 23 , radio programmers had opted for " Deep Blue " and the entry appeared as a double A @-@ side in the chart listings . The single enjoyed more success on the other two US national charts , peaking at number 20 on Cash Box and number 13 on Record World .

 The 1971 single remained the only official release for " Deep Blue " for over 30 years , during which the song was largely forgotten . In his conversations with Derek Taylor over 1978 – 79 for I , Me , Mine , Harrison acknowledged that the track had become " a bit obscure " . Inglis suggests that its exclusion from any album releases was because the lyrics ' " raw imagery " confined the track to a " very specific personal and political relevance " within the Bangladesh context . 
 After the expiration of Harrison 's contract with Capitol in 1976 , this and other non @-@ album B @-@ sides were among the notable omissions from The Best of George Harrison , a compilation that ignored many popular songs from his solo career in favour of an LP side of Beatles tracks . That same year , Harrison signed with Warner Bros. Records , whose staff producer Ted Templeman expressed his admiration for " Deep Blue " . As a result , Harrison wrote a song in the same musical style , the more upbeat " Soft @-@ Hearted Hana " , for his 1979 album George Harrison . 
 From the mid 1990s , " Deep Blue " became available on Harrison bootleg compilations such as Pirate Songs and Through Many Years . Along with " Miss O 'Dell " , a song he wrote in Los Angeles partly about the Bangladesh crisis , it was finally given an official CD release in September 2006 , as a bonus track on Harrison 's remastered Living in the Material World album . " Deep Blue " also appears on the 2014 Apple Years 1968 – 75 reissue of the album . 
 = = Reception = = 
 " Deep Blue " impressed the notably anti @-@ Harrison Village Voice critic Robert Christgau , who considered the song on a par with " Here Comes the Sun " and " My Sweet Lord " , while noting its status as a track " hidden away " on a B @-@ side . In their 2000 book on the four ex @-@ Beatles ' solo recordings , Chip Madinger and Mark Easter wrote of " Deep Blue " : " The track 's understated instrumentation and perceptive lyrical content make this one of the best , yet most overlooked songs in George 's catalog . " In a 2001 appraisal of Harrison 's Apple recordings , for Record Collector , Peter Doggett opined that Harrison had " tucked away an acoustic gem " on the B @-@ side to " Bangla Desh " and described the song as " a sad but still buoyant lament inspired by his regular visits to his dying mother 's bedside " . 
 Among reviews of the Living in the Material World reissue , John Metzger of The Music Box describes " Deep Blue " as a " loose , swinging acoustic blues " . Writing for AllMusic , Bruce Eder views it as an " important bonus track " , as well as " a fantastic showcase " for Harrison 's acoustic guitar playing . In a review of the Apple Years reissues , New Zealand Herald music critic Graham Reid describes the song as an " especially good " B @-@ side . 
 Theologian Dale Allison recognises " Deep Blue " as Harrison 's " musically beautiful and lyrically moving " response to his mother 's death , a " prayer to God for help , light , love , and understanding in the midst of personal grief " . Ian Inglis praises the song 's " uncluttered production and economical backing " , adding : " ' Deep Blue ' is unlike anything he had written or recorded at that time , and its relative obscurity is undeserved . " While comparing the song favourably with better @-@ known compositions by Lennon ( " Julia " ) and McCartney ( " Yesterday " , " Let It Be " ) , Inglis concludes : " Where they differ is that Harrison 's song is about himself as much as it is about his mother ; her death is a starting point for an exploration of the ' suffering ' and ' darkness ' that afflict us all . " Elliot Huntley describes it as " a plaintive acoustic guitar tune " that became an " unjustly overlooked B @-@ side " . 
 Simon Leng sees " Deep Blue " as a candidate for what he terms " the ' last great B @-@ side ' accolade " , rivalling Harrison 's Beatles tracks " The Inner Light " and " Old Brown Shoe " . Leng also considers it to be a " worthy companion " to Dylan 's New Morning album and the work of Bromberg and Ry Cooder .

 = Cerro Maravilla murders = 
 The Cerro Maravilla murders , also known as the Cerro Maravilla massacre , is the name given by the Puerto Rican public and media to describe the events that occurred on July 25 , 1978 , at Cerro Maravilla , a mountain in Puerto Rico , wherein two young Puerto Rican pro @-@ independence activists were murdered in a Puerto Rico Police ambush . The event sparked a series of political controversies where , in the end , the police officers were found guilty of murder and several high @-@ ranking local government officials were accused of planning and / or covering up the incident . 
 Originally declared a police intervention against terrorists , the local media quickly questioned the officers ' testimonies as well as the only surviving witness for inconsistencies . Although reluctant , Carlos Romero Barceló ( PNP ) , then Governor of Puerto Rico , ordered the local Justice Department to launch various investigations , and asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) and the US Justice Department to aid in the investigations , which concluded that there was no wrongdoing on the officers ' part . However , after the local opposing political party launched its own inquiries , new evidence and witness testimonies surfaced which uncovered gross negligence and murder on the officers ' part , as well as the possibility of a local and federal cover @-@ up . Trials were held and a total of 10 officers were convicted of various crimes . 
 The incident and subsequent events have become one of the most controversial events in Puerto Rico 's political history , frequently called " the worst political cover @-@ up in the history of the island . " The event is often used by Puerto Rican independence activists as an example of political oppression against the independence movement . Joy James commented that " the Cerro Maravilla massacre demonstrated the reason why colonialism was banned in the world . " 
 = = The victims = = 
 Carlos Enrique Soto Arriví was born on December 8 , 1959 , in San Juan . His parents were Pedro Juan Soto ( one of the most admired Puerto Rican novelists in the 20th century ) and Rosa Arriví . He had an older brother ( Roberto Alfonso ) and a younger brother ( Juan Manuel ) . 
 As a student he enjoyed literature . He also wrote stories and went on to win second place in a competition held by the Puerto Rico Department of Education . When his parents went to Europe to finish their doctoral studies , he learned to speak French in a year . Upon returning from Europe , he enrolled at the Escuela Superior República de Colombia , a high school in Río Piedras , although in a lower grade , because the school officials did not want to credit his years of overseas study . Although Soto Arriví was interested in social issues from a very young age , his political activism started when he joined a pro @-@ independence group in high school . 
 Arnaldo Darío Rosado Torres was born on November 23 , 1953 , in Old San Juan . His parents were Pablo Rosado and Juana Torres <unk> . Rosado finished his high school studies and went to work at a cracker factory . Dario Rosado was married to Angela Rivera , and had a son called Manuel <unk> Rosado Rivera . 
 From a very young age , Rosado identified with the cause of Puerto Rico 's independence . He joined the socialist league with which he participated in several activities . Rosado was an autodidact and an avid reader of various kinds of literature , especially those related to the political processes of Puerto Rico and Latin America . He also wrote poems , essays , and had several pen @-@ pals throughout Latin America . 
 = = The incident = = 
 On the night of July 25 , 1978 Carlos Soto Arriví and Arnaldo Darío Rosado , two independence activists of the Armed Revolutionary Movement ( Spanish : Movimiento Revolucionario Armado ) , along with undercover police officer Alejandro González Malavé posing as a fellow group member , took taxi driver Julio Ortiz Molina hostage and ordered him to drive them to Cerro Maravilla where several communication towers were located . Their original plan was to set fire and sabotage the towers to protest the imprisonment of Puerto Rican nationalists convicted of the 1950 assassination attempt on U.S. President Harry S. Truman and the 1954 shooting at the United States Capitol where five members of Congress were injured . State police officers were alerted of their plan prior to their arrival and the activists were ambushed and shot . The undercover agent received a minor bullet wound during the shooting , while the taxi driver was left relatively unharmed . 
 = = = Initial statements = = = 
 The morning after the shootings , the officers argued that they acted in self defense , stating that they ordered the activists to surrender , at which time the activists started shooting at them and they returned fire . Initially , the taxi driver said he was under the dashboard of his cab when the shooting started and could not see who shot first , although he contradicted his statement a few days later in an interview with the San Juan Star , a local newspaper , stating that he ducked under the dashboard of the car after the three men ( the two activists and the undercover agent ) left the car , and that he saw " 10 heavily armed men " approaching . When he emerged from the car , he saw the three men alive and two of them were being beaten by the armed men , who were later identified as policemen . Then @-@ Governor of Puerto Rico Carlos Romero Barceló ( PNP ) praised the officers in a televised address by calling them “ heroic ” , stating that they acted in self @-@ defense and stopped a terrorist attack . 
 Two days later , in a follow @-@ up interview by <unk> @-@ TV news reporter Enrique Cruz , the taxi driver stated that when the first shooting occurred , he heard one of his three passengers shout " I 'm an agent ! Don 't shoot me , I 'm an agent ! " while the others called for help and shouted " I give up ! I give up ! " . He saw " 10 heavily armed men " approaching , later identified as police agents , when the three passengers exited the car , and the taxi driver was ordered at gunpoint to exit the vehicle . He was extracted by an agent , kicked , and taken away from the scene . While being escorted , he saw the two activists directly in front of his vehicle being beaten by the armed men . 
 = = = The first investigations = = = 
 Facing public pressure due to the taxi driver 's conflicting statements , Governor Barceló ordered two separate investigations by the P.R. Justice Department in addition to the ongoing standard Police investigation , all of which concluded that the officers ' actions were free of any wrongdoing , despite various inconsistencies in their stories . P.R. District Attorney Pedro Colton informed reporters on July 29 , four days after the incident , that the P.R. Justice Department 's investigation revealed " no massacre , no beatings , and no aggressions , except for the shootings that occurred in Cerro Maravilla . " Opposing political parties , mainly the Popular Democratic Party ( PDP ) , insisted that the investigations were just cover @-@ ups and demanded that a special independent prosecutor be assigned to investigate . Two special investigations by the U.S. Justice Department 's Civil Rights Division and by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) were performed on separate occasions between 1978 and 1980 , which confirmed the conclusions of the P.R. Justice Department that the officers acted in self @-@ defense . 
 = = = The second investigations = = = 
 In the November 1980 general elections , Governor Romero Barceló was re @-@ elected by a margin of 3 @,@ 503 votes ( one of the closest in Puerto Rico history ) , though his party lost control of the state legislature to the main opposition party , the PPD . This loss was attributed by the New York Times to the surrounding controversy regarding the investigations at the time . Other news organizations , such as Time , attributed the loss to Gov. Romero <unk> 's stance on the island 's political status . The Legislature quickly started new inquiries and hearings into the Cerro Maravilla incident . The Senate , then presided by Miguel Hernández Agosto , spearheaded the investigations by naming former Assistant District Attorney Hector Rivera Cruz to investigate . 
 The second investigations performed between 1981 and 1984 by the legislature , the U.S. Justice Department , and the local press uncovered a plot to assassinate the activists and a possible , though not conclusive , conspiracy to cover @-@ up these actions . During interviews of the Senate Investigations Committee in 1983 , officer Miguel Cartagena Flores , a detective in the Intelligence Division of the Puerto Rico Police Department , testified : “ When I arrived at the scene I saw 4 police officers aiming their guns at the two activists who were kneeling before them . I turned my eyes away and heard 5 gunshots . " Cartagena , who was offered immunity for his testimony , added that several hours before the shooting , he and other officers were told by Col. Angel Perez Casillas , commander of the Intelligence Division , that “ these terrorists should not come down ( from the mountain ) alive . ” His testimony was corroborated by officer Carmelo Cruz who , although he did not witness the fatal shooting , confirmed many details provided by Cartagena when also granted immunity . 
 Other inquiries obtained similar testimony from witnesses , including the taxi driver who now stated that the activists were “ alive and disarmed ” when the police removed him from the scene . The taxi driver stated that there was a short exchange of gunfire , and when he was removed to another place nearby he heard a second volley of gunfire , but was asked by the police and investigators of the PR Justice Department to forget about the second round of shots . The statement regarding two different volleys of shots was upheld by various people , including ex @-@ officer Jesus Quiñones before a Federal grand jury ( he quit the force shortly after the shootings ) , and three other civilian witnesses in a San Juan Star interview . 
 Subsequently , the legislature and local press started questioning the actions of the Puerto Rico Police , the Puerto Rico Justice Department , the U.S. Justice Department , and the FBI actions during the first investigation , alleging corruption within the agencies and a conspiracy to cover @-@ up evidence . Letters were sent by various community and political leaders to then Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Senator Edward M. Kennedy , asking for an inquiry into the conduct of the Federal investigations . Several letters even accused former US Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti of providing aid to Gov. Romero Barceló during the investigations . Two leaders from the opposing parties , the Popular Democratic Party and the Puerto Rican Independence Party , charged that after a December 1979 meeting between the two , the Governor , then considered as a lifelong Republican , began campaigning to deliver the 41 Democratic Party convention votes of the island for President Jimmy Carter 's ( D ) nomination for the presidency ( ironically , Carter ’ s opponent for the nomination was Senator Kennedy ) . Almost 45 days after President Carter won the nomination by only one delegate , the U.S. Justice Department announced that due to lack of evidence it was bringing its investigation of the case to an end . A Justice Department internal memorandum that was issued the same month of Romero Barceló ’ s and Civiletti ’ s meeting later proved that the investigations were closed even when agents were still investigating important evidence of the case that could potentially incriminate the officers , including “ several unexplained contusions ” on a victim 's face and the fact that one of the police officers recanted his original story , stating that there was in fact “ two bursts of firing ” . 
 These and several other accusations brought public and political pressure to the investigating agencies . This led to internal revisions of evidence and procedures from the first investigations both at the local and federal level , though all organizations still adamantly denied any cover @-@ up . These second investigations led to reassignments , demotions and resignations among top officials within the PR Justice Department , including three different P.R. Secretaries of Justice ( equivalent to State Attorney General ) accepting and resigning their posts in a span of six months . On November 29 , 1983 , three prosecutors were relieved of their duties after a report by the state Senate Investigations Committee found they had failed to properly investigate the Cerro Maravilla shootings , citing 101 specific deficiencies in two investigations . This was the third state Attorney General to oversee the investigations since the shootings occurred in 1978 . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The second investigations led to ten officers being indicted and found guilty of perjury , destruction of evidence , and obstruction of justice , four of which were convicted of second @-@ degree murder in 1984 . The convicted officers , who were no longer on active duty , and their status with the Puerto Rico Police were : 
 Col. Ángel Pérez Casillas ( head of the Puerto Rico Police Department Intelligence Division during the incident ; suspended ) 
 Lieut . Nelson González Pérez ( resigned ) 
 Lieut . Jaime <unk> Hernández ( suspended ) 
 Officer Juan Bruno González ( suspended ) 
 Officer William Colón <unk> ( suspended ) 
 Officer Nazario Mateo Espada ( suspended ) 
 Officer Rafael Moreno Morales ( suspended ) 
 Officer Luis <unk> Martínez ( on disability leave ) 
 Officer Jose Ríos Polanco ( suspended ) 
 Officer Rafael Torres Marrero ( on disability leave ) 
 That same year , in the general elections held in November , Romero Barceló lost his gubernatorial seat against former governor and opposing party rival Rafael Hernández Colón ( PPD ) . It is widely accepted that Romero Barceló lost the elections because of this case , since his public opinion rating had deteriorated substantially during late 1984 as the investigations progressed , and since his political rivals used his defense of the officers as an indication of a possible conspiracy . 
 = = = Undercover agent murdered = = = 
 Alejandro Gonzalez Malavé , the undercover agent who was accompanying the activists , was not indicted for his part in the slayings because he was granted immunity for testifying against other officers , but was removed from the police force due to public pressure . In February 1986 , he was acquitted of kidnapping the taxi driver . His lawyer had argued that he was acting under orders and , therefore , it was the government who was actually guilty of kidnapping . This , despite the testimony presented by officer Carmelo Cruz who had testified that it was Gonzalez who recklessly endangered the hostage 's life . The prosecution had provided evidence that he threatened the hostage at gunpoint , drove the car , and , when the car approached the mountaintop , refused to free the hostage despite suggestions from the activists . These actions , according to officer Cruz , were contrary to standard police procedures since his primary concern should have been the safety of the hostage . Nevertheless , the Puerto Rico Police Department did not reinstate Gonzalez as an active police officer , a fact that he publicly expressed resentment over , and subsequently threatened to provide incriminating evidence to the media about other individuals involved in the shootings unless reinstated . 
 On the evening of April 29 , 1986 , just two months after his acquittal , Gonzalez was assassinated in front of his mother 's house in Bayamón . He sustained three gunshot wounds and his mother was slightly injured . A few hours later , a group identifying itself as the “ Volunteer Organization for the Revolution ” called local news agencies claiming responsibility . In their statements they swore to kill , " one by one , " all the policemen involved in the deaths in Cerro Maravilla . The FBI considered it one of the most dangerous terrorist organizations in the United States at the time , given that it was the same organization that claimed responsibility for an attack on a Navy bus in Puerto Rico on December 3 , 1979 , in which two Navy men were killed and 10 people injured , and the attack on a U.S. National Guard base on January 12 , 1981 , in which six fighter @-@ jet planes were destroyed . To this day , no one has been identified as a possible suspect in Gonzalez 's murder , and the case remains unsolved . 
 = = = Public apologies = = = 
 In 1992 , former US Justice Department Civil Rights Division chief Drew S. Days III admitted before the P.R. Senate that the U.S. Justice Department and the FBI acted negligently during the 1978 – 1980 investigations of the Cerro Maravilla incident , such as rejecting interviews with key witnesses ( including the taxi driver ) , refusing to offer immunity to certain witnesses , and avoiding various standard investigating tasks . Days stated : " I think that certainly an apology is justified with respect to the way the federal government handled its investigation : the FBI , the Justice Department , and my division . . . it was not done in the professional way that it should have been done . " FBI Director William S. Sessions had made similar concessions in a written statement in 1990 , stating : “ In hindsight , the eyewitness should have been interviewed and a civil rights investigation initiated ” . In 1984 , the FBI conducted an internal review of its Cerro Maravilla Case files , and concluded that there was no cover @-@ up effort inside the FBI , only a desire to avoid derailing " the cooperative anti @-@ terrorism effort " with the Puerto Rican police . Their statements were accompanied with promises to improve their agencies to avoid similar incidents in the future . 
 In 2003 , 25 years after the incident , former Gov. Romero Barceló admitted in a public radio interview that it was “ an error of judgment ” and “ a premature declaration ” to laud the police officers , since at that time he believed they were telling the truth about their self @-@ defense . However , he has publicly denied any wrongdoing regarding the alleged cover @-@ up during the first investigations . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Since the conclusion of the final investigations , there has been heated debate about the Cerro Maravilla incident in Puerto Rico , with some groups arguing that there are still others responsible for planning and / or ordering the plot to kill the activists as well as the subsequent cover @-@ up , while others have argued that the incident was exaggerated by rival politicians and the media , maintaining that no conspiracy ever took place and that some of the officers incarcerated , though not all , are actually innocent . 
 Every year on July 25 , Puerto Rican Nationalists and independence activists gather atop Cerro Maravilla to honor Carlos Soto and Arnaldo Dario , as well as to defend and celebrate the Puerto Rican independence ideology . It is usually organized by the family of the victims , former members of nationalist groups , and by the Puerto Rican Independence Party ( PIP ) . The mountain has also been christened by them as “ El Cerro de los <unk> ” ( The Mountain of the Martyrs ) . 
 The American movie A Show of Force is loosely based on the events and theories behind the incident . 
 = Evanton = 
 Evanton ( Scottish Gaelic : Baile <unk> or Scottish Gaelic : Am Baile <unk> ) is a large village in Easter Ross , in the Highland Council Area of Scotland . It lies between the river Sgitheach and the Allt Graad , is 24 kilometres ( 15 mi ) north of the city of Inverness , some 6 @.@ 5 km ( 4 @.@ 0 mi ) south @-@ west of Alness , and 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) north @-@ east of Dingwall . The village has a dozen or so streets , the main one being Balconie Street ( <unk> ) . It has been described by analysts at Highland Council as a " commuting settlement " , because most of the inhabitants work in other areas of Easter Ross and the greater Inverness area . 
 The current town was founded in the early nineteenth century by Alexander Fraser of <unk> / Balconie who named it after his son Evan , but the core of the village buildings date from the Victorian era . Evanton has several tourist attractions , including the <unk> monument , the Black Rock Gorge and the ruined church of Kiltearn lying near the river Sgitheach as it flows into the Cromarty Firth , as well as other miscellaneous natural , historical and archaeological attractions in the surrounding area . There are two Churches , one Church of Scotland and one Free Church of Scotland . There is one primary school , but the nearest high schools are in Dingwall and Alness . It has one convenience store , a post @-@ office , one public inns ( Balconie Inn ) a bus stop and an ATM . The village hall is named the ' Diamond Jubilee Hall . ' The community owns and manages the local woodland . 
 = = Kiltearn background = = 
 Evanton lies within the ancient parish of Kiltearn ( Gd : <unk> <unk> ) , within the medieval lands known as <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) in the heart of the old " Earldom " of Ross . Traditionally , <unk> is supposed to be derived from a grant of King Máel Coluim III to Donald Munro of Foulis ( Domhnall mac an <unk> ) , the legendary progenitor of Clan Munro . However , there is no evidence for the existence of this family until the fourteenth century . 
 Evanton is in close proximity to the site of Balconie Castle , an old seat of the Mormaers and Earls of Ross . By the early modern period , the area was dominated by the <unk> of Foulis ( <unk> ) , who had their Foulis Castle just a few kilometres away . Indeed , the latter began to bury their family at Kiltearn after 1588 . The Cille place @-@ name in Kiltearn tells us that there had been a very ancient Gaelic church near Evanton , like all Cille place @-@ names , founded before 800 . The current Gaelic name <unk> <unk> ( " Church of the Lord " ) is probably a corruption of an older form , both because the name formation is unusual in being dedicated to the Lord Himself , and because the form given in 1227 is <unk> , suggesting some kind of connection to Tigernach in Ireland . Other suggestions have included a dedication to St <unk> . The church lay next to the lordly residence of Balconie . By the later Middle Ages , Balconie was one of the five lordships of Ross , as well as an individual seat of the Earls of Ross . Place @-@ name evidence suggests that the site may once have been a Pictish residence . A charter granted by <unk> , Earl of Ross in 1281 records the name <unk> , but a charter of 1333 refers to a location called <unk> . The development of the name <unk> , where Pictish <unk> is replaced by Gaelic Baile , suggests the names are the same , but the great early twentieth century <unk> William J. Watson was <unk> . 
 = = History = = 
 In Kiltearn there had been a settlement , an old <unk> toun known as Drummond ( <unk> ) , near the location of Evanton , and several lordly residences , such as Foulis , Novar and Balconie Castle . In 1807 , the local landowner Alexander Fraser was clearing his estates to make way for sheep , and founded Evanton as a planned settlement for the relocated residents , modestly naming it after his son . To this day , in the words of one historian , Evanton " remains today an attractive example of a well planned , regularly laid out estate village " . The Reverend Thomas Munro expressed similar sentiments in the 1840s , when he wrote that " the village was built on a waste of land , and differs from all others in the country by its regular and neat appearance " . The village suffered from the severe famine that plagued the Highlands in the 1840s . There was a riot in the village in 1846 , because the authorities continued to export grain despite the failure of the previous year 's potato crop ; similar riots occurred in Rosemarkie , <unk> and Avoch . In 1847 , there was near starvation in the village , and the villagers managed to maintain themselves on turnips . However , the village population recovered ; by the beginnings of the First World War , Evanton had taken much of its current physical shape , and at this point in time contained businesses as diverse as a tobacconist and a bicycle shop , both of which have subsequently disappeared . 
 In the twentieth century , the village enjoyed a variety of fortunes . The distillery closed in 1926 ( see below ) and one of the most important historical locations in Easter Ross , Balconie Castle , was demolished in 1965 . It had been an old seat of the Earls of Ross , but by the 1960s the owner could not afford to repair the dry rot . There was a RAF airfield constructed near Evanton in 1922 , on Alness Bay . It was first known as the " Novar Base " , because of its location on the Novar Estates , then later as HMS <unk> . It was serviced from Leuchars , and was used by the aircraft from the nearby Home Fleet base of Invergordon . The largest aircraft to have landed there was a USAAF B17 . On Empire Day , 1939 , RAF bases all over the United Kingdom were opened to the public , and the Evanton Aerodrome was the most northerly location to participate , attracting 9000 visitors . The base closed in the 1970s . However , the oil boom of the 1970s caused radical expansion of the village . It has been growing steadily ever since . 
 = = Demographics = = 
 The modern village is on average a little younger than the Highland region in general . The population of Evanton varies depending on how it is calculated . The Evanton " Settlement Zone " is different from the Evanton " Settlement " , and the former is of course larger . There are 671 households and 1678 inhabitants in total in the Evanton @-@ zone . Evanton @-@ settlement on its own however has only 1105 inhabitants . The population in both cases though is growing steadily , and the 1990s saw a moderate increase of 8 @.@ 12 % for the zone , rising from 1552 to 1678 ; and 10 @.@ 72 % for the settlement on its own , rising from 998 to 1105 . Over two thirds of the houses in the zone are owner @-@ occupied . Roughly 16 @.@ 4 % or 275 people who live in Evanton @-@ zone were born outside Scotland , almost always coming from England . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Evanton is more or less enclosed to the north @-@ east and the south @-@ west by two rivers , the Allt Graad and the River Sgitheach . The Allt Graad , sometimes called the River Glass , is a picturesque river that flows from Loch Glass , near Ben <unk> , for 9 km ( 5 ½ miles ) until it passes the northern end of the village , and empties into the Cromarty Firth . However , some 3 km ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) before it reaches the Cromarty Firth , it passes through the Black Rock Gorge . The latter is a few hundred metres in length and reaches 36 metres ( 120 ft ) in depth . In April , 2004 , ten days of filming took place in the area for the movie Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and the Gorge is the setting for the scene where Harry is chased by a dragon . The River Sgitheach , sometimes written as Skiack or <unk> , is not as large a river as the Allt Graad and can run low in the summer . It flows from the mountains of inland Ross and is complemented by numerous other streams until it passes several waterfalls before flowing past the southern end of the village , and the northern end of the old settlement of Drummond , into the Cromarty Firth about 1 km from the mouth of the Allt Graad . 
 = = Economy = = 
 A significant but small percentage of people have employment in the oil industry owing to the proximity of oil rigs on the Cromarty Firth . Other locally significant industries include forestry , tourism and catering . A significant number of people work in larger nearby localities , such as Inverness , Dingwall , Alness and Invergordon , which is why only 14 % of households in the zone own no car . 10 @.@ 4 % of the population of the zone are self @-@ employed , and 28 % economically inactive , roughly corresponding with the Highland averages . There are also two hotels and two bars , which soak up much of the tourist income that the town generates . 
 There had been a distillery in the Evanton area of the Kiltearn parish as early as the eighteenth century , its existence being reported by Harry Robertson , the author of the late eighteenth century Kiltearn section of the late eighteenth century 1st Statistical Account . The Glen Skiack distillery opened in 1896 and only ever produced a relatively small amount of Whisky . However , the effects of the U.S. Prohibition law , which damaged the income of all Scottish distilleries , proved too much for Glen Skiack , and the operation was forced to close in 1926 . The building itself was demolished in 1933 . 
 There is only one small Inn in Evanton , The Balconie Inn . The Novar Arms Hotel is now a lodging for travelling labour . There is no garage in Evanton , one auto bank and one small supermarket . 
 = = Transport = = 
 In 1860 , the Highland Railway decided to construct a railway line going from Inverness through Easter Ross . The line was completed by 1862 , and the following year , on 23 May 1863 , Evanton gained its own railway station . However , the station was called Novar , and was not renamed " Evanton " until 1937 . Sadly for the local economy , the station was closed in June 1960 . The platforms remain there to this day , but the signal posts have been destroyed . The Inverness to Thurso railway line , known today as " Far North Line " , still passes by the seaward side of the town , and the trains can still be heard from a great distance . The nearest train station is Alness . 
 The A9 , the great road connecting Edinburgh with Inverness and the far north , once ran through Evanton , on the path of Balconie Street . However , a bypass was created as part of a general scheme to shorten the journey between Inverness to Invergordon . This reduced the amount of traffic going through the village , but decreased the revenue available to local businesses . The road also cut through much of the farmland of the zone , distorting the shape of the fields . This was compounded by the closure of the filling station in the village . For those who do not have cars , the only means of transport is either by foot or by the # 25 bus service operated by Stagecoach . Recently , the express service running from Inverness to Dornoch began to stop in Evanton . Now residents can travel from and to Inverness without the long diversion through Dingwall , making it easier to work in the city of Inverness without personal transport .

 In 1845 , the local minister wrote that " the language generally spoken is an impure form of Gaelic , but it is rapidly losing ground " and that " in Evanton , both English and Gaelic are spoken indifferently " . The minister wrote that the people , especially the children , learned English with ease after they had learned to write Gaelic . The minister also gave some reasons why the people were keen to learn English , telling us that " English being the language universally spoken by the higher classes , the mass of the people attach a notion of superior refinement to the possession of it " . Half a century previously , Harry Robertson had praised the spirit of one watchmaker in the region , but added " it is a pity that he can hardly read nor write , and hardly speaks English " . 
 Today , one can see Gaelic written on the walls of the parish church , but the language has effectively died out , and English is totally dominant . Nevertheless , there are still some 72 residents ( 4 @.@ 3 % ) of the village who know the language . The village is also a big location on the Highland folk @-@ circuit , and enjoys a vibrant musical culture in the Gaelic tradition . It is a regular practice for local musicians to meet in the Balconie Inn , one of the two licensed establishments of the town , and engage in evening @-@ long sessions . Many prominent musicians on the Celtic music scene have visited , including <unk> Steel and Dougie MacLean . 
 Note there is now only one licensed premises open to the public , The Balconie Inn .

 The " naked rambler " Stephen Gough was reported and arrested at Evanton in November , 2003 . He was engaged in a naked trek through Britain . While walking through Evanton wearing only a hat , a backpack and boots , he was spotted and reported by a local resident . He was sentenced two months later at Dingwall Sheriff Court . His arrest at Evanton meant that he still had one hundred miles to go in order to complete his journey . He completed his journey in January 2004 and repeated the feat in 2006 . 
 Evanton was the venue for the premier of the 1st tour of the new Scottish National Theatre in 2006 . Unable to find a suitable location in Inverness , the National Theatre chose to present " Home " at the studio of Arts In Motion , on the Evanton Industrial Estate . 
 Evanton has a number of public facilities including the Diamond Jubilee Hall , Chapel Road , building work started in December 1897 , Major Randle Jackson of <unk> House gave 50 % of the building costs and the people of Evanton ( Parish of Kiltearn ) raised the rest . The hall opened on 5 November 1898 with a grand concert over 500 people from the village attending . Diamond Jubilee Hall transferred from Highland Council to the Community on Thursday 29 September 2011 . Evanton Sports Centre ( opposite Kiltearn Primary School ) is the other public <unk> in the village which <unk> for various sporting activities badminton , basketball , football and tennis . Evanton also has a good sized park at <unk> . In recent years a local group of parents and young people has worked with Highland Council and various funding bodies to install a <unk> area , a BMX track and a Half @-@ Pipe ramp , a new <unk> for toddlers was added in 2007 by EYE . In 2008 Highland Council upgraded the original park which was installed in the 1970s . 
 = Toyohara Kunichika = 
 Toyohara Kunichika ( Japanese : <unk> <unk> ; 30 June 1835 – 1 July 1900 ) was a Japanese woodblock print artist . Talented as a child , at about thirteen he became a student of Tokyo 's then @-@ leading print maker , Utagawa Kunisada . His deep appreciation and knowledge of kabuki drama led to his production primarily of ukiyo @-@ e actor @-@ prints , which are woodblock prints of kabuki actors and scenes from popular plays of the time . 
 An alcoholic and womanizer , Kunichika also portrayed women deemed beautiful ( <unk> ) , contemporary social life , and a few landscapes and historical scenes . He worked successfully in the Edo period , and carried those traditions into the Meiji period . To his contemporaries and now to some modern art historians , this has been seen as a significant achievement during a transitional period of great social and political change in Japan 's history . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 The artist who became known as Toyohara Kunichika was born Ōshima Yasohachi on June 30 , 1835 , in the <unk> district , a merchant and artisan area of Edo ( present @-@ day Tokyo ) . His father , Ōshima <unk> , was the proprietor of a <unk> ( public bathhouse ) , the <unk> . An indifferent family man , and poor businessman , he lost the bathhouse sometime in Yasohachi 's childhood . The boy 's mother , Arakawa <unk> , was the daughter of a teahouse proprietor . At that time , commoners of a certain social standing could ask permission to alter the family name ( <unk> gomen ) . To distance themselves from the father 's failure , the family took the mother 's surname , and the boy became Arakawa Yasohachi . 
 Little is known about his childhood except that , as a youth , Yasohachi earned a reputation as a prankster and drew complaints from his neighbors , and that at nine he was involved in a fight at the <unk> Festival in Asakusa . At age ten he was apprenticed to a thread and yarn store . However , because he preferred painting and sketching to learning the dry goods trade , at eleven he moved to a shop near his father 's bathhouse . There he helped in the design of Japanese lampshades called <unk> , consisting of a wooden frame with a paper cover . When he was twelve , his older brother , <unk> , opened a raised picture shop , and Yasohachi drew illustrations for him . 
 It is believed that around age twelve Yasohachi began to study with Toyohara ( <unk> ) Chikanobu ( not to be confused with Kunichika ’ s student Toyohara Chikanobu ) . At the same time he designed actor portraits for <unk> sold by a shop called <unk> . His teacher gave him the name " <unk> " . It may have been on the recommendation of Chikanobu that the boy was accepted the following year as an apprentice in the studio of Utagawa Kunisada , the leading and most prolific print maker of the mid @-@ 19th century . By 1854 the young artist had made his first confirmed signed print and had taken the name " Kunichika " , a composite of the names of this two teachers , Kunisada and Chikanobu . His early work was derivative of the Utagawa style and some of his prints were outright copies ( an accepted practice of the time ) . While working in Kunisada 's studio Kunichika was assigned a commission to make a print illustrating a bird 's @-@ eye view of <unk> Avenue following the terrible earthquake of 1855 that destroyed most of the city . This assignment suggests that he was considered one of Kunisada 's better students . 
 The " prankster " artist got into trouble in 1862 when , in response to a commission for a print illustrating a fight at a theater , he made a " parody print " ( <unk> @-@ e ) which angered the students who had been involved in the fracas . They ransacked Kunichika 's house and tried to enter Kunisada 's studio by force . His mentor revoked Kunichika 's right to use the name he had been given but relented later that year . Decades afterwards Kunichika described himself as greatly " humbled " by the experience . 
 Kunichika 's status continued to rise and he was commissioned to create several portraits of his teacher . When Kunisada died in 1865 , his student was commissioned to design two memorial portraits . The right panel of the portrait contains an obituary written by the writer , <unk> <unk> , while the left contains memorial poems written by the three top students , including Kunichika . 
 = = Artist on the cusp of a new era = = 
 At the time Kunichika began his serious studies the late Edo period , an extension of traditions based on a feudal society , was about to end . The " modern " Meiji era ( 1868 – 1912 ) , a time of rapid modernization , industrialization , and extensive contact with the West , was in stark contrast to what had come before . 
 Ukiyo @-@ e artists had traditionally illustrated urban life and society – especially the theater , for which their prints often served as advertising . The Meiji period brought competition from the new technologies of photography and photoengraving , effectively destroying the careers of most . 
 As Kunichika matured his reputation as a master of design and of drama grew steadily . In guides rating ukiyo @-@ e artists his name appeared in the top ten in 1865 , 1867 , and 1885 , when he was in eighth , fifth , and fourth place , respectively . In 1867 , one year before the collapse of the Tokugawa Shogunate , he received an official commission by the government to contribute ten pictures to the 1867 World Exhibition in Paris . He also had a print at the 1893 World 's Columbian Exposition in Chicago . 
 Kunichika often portrayed beautiful women ( <unk> ) , but his finest works are considered to have been bust , half- and three @-@ quarter length , and close @-@ up or " large @-@ head " portraits of actors , and triptychs that presented " wide @-@ screen " views of plays and popular stories . 
 Although Kunichika 's Meiji @-@ era works remained rooted in the traditions of his teachers , he made an effort to incorporate references to modern technology . In 1869 he did a series jointly with Yoshitoshi , a more " modern " artist in the sense that he depicted faces realistically . In addition , Kunichika experimented with " Western " vanishing point perspective . 
 The press affirmed that Kunichika 's success continued into the Meiji era . In July 1874 , the magazine Shinbun hentai said that : " Color woodcuts are one of the specialties of Tokyo , and that <unk> , Yoshitoshi , Yoshiiku , Kunichika , and <unk> are the experts in this area . " In September 1874 The same journal held that : " The masters of <unk> : Yoshiiku , Kunichika and Yoshitoshi . They are the most popular Ukiyo @-@ e artists . " In 1890 , the book Tôkyô <unk> <unk> <unk> ( Famous Views of Tokyo ) , under the heading of woodblock artist , gave as examples Kunichika , Kunisada , Yoshiiku , and Yoshitoshi . In November 1890 a reporter for the newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun wrote about the specializations of artists of the Utagawa school : " Yoshitoshi was the specialist for warrior prints , Kunichika the woodblock artist known for portraits of actors , and Chikanobu for court ladies . " 
 Contemporary observers noted Kunichika 's skillful use of color in his actor prints , but he was also criticized for his choices . Unlike most artists of the period , he made use of strong reds and dark purples , often as background colors , rather than the softer colors that had previously been used . These new colors were made of aniline dyes imported in the Meiji period from Germany . ( For the Japanese the color red meant progress and enlightenment in the new era of Western @-@ style progress . ) 
 Like most artists of his era and genre , Kunichika created many series of prints , including : Yoshiwara beauties compared with thirty @-@ six poems ; Thirty @-@ two fashionable <unk> ; Sixteen Musashi parodying modern customs ; Thirty @-@ six good and evil beauties ; Thirty @-@ six modern restaurants ; Mirror of the flowering of manners and customs ; Fifty @-@ four modern feelings matched with chapters of The Tale of Genji ; Scenes of the twenty @-@ four hours parodied ; Actors in theatrical hits as great heroes in robber plays ; Eight views of bandits parodied . 
 In 1863 Kunichika was one of a number of artists who contributed landscape prints to two series of famous <unk> scenes commissioned to commemorate the journey made by the shogun Iemochi from Edo to Kyoto to pay his respects to the emperor . Otherwise , his landscapes were primarily theater sets , or backgrounds for groups of beauties enjoying the out @-@ of @-@ doors . He recorded some popular myths and tales , but rarely illustrated battles . When portraying people he only occasionally showed figures wearing Western dress , despite its growing popularity in Japan . He is known to have done some shunga ( erotic art ) prints but attribution can be difficult as , like most artists of the time , he did not always sign them . Kunichika had many students but few attained recognition as print artists . In the changing art scene they could not support themselves designing woodblock prints , but had to make illustrations for such popular media as books , magazines and newspapers . His best @-@ known students were Toyohara Chikanobu and Morikawa <unk> . Both initially followed their master 's interest in theater , but later Chikanobu more enthusiastically portrayed women 's fashions , and <unk> did illustrations . Neither is considered by critics to have achieved his master 's high reputation . 
 Kunichika had one female student , Toyohara <unk> , who reportedly became his partner in his later years . Her work reflected the Utagawa style . She competently depicted actors , and the manners and customs of the day . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 As a young man , Kunichika had a reputation for a beautiful singing voice and as a fine dancer . He is known to have used these talents in amateur burlesque shows . 
 In 1861 Kunichika married his first wife , <unk> , and in that same year had a daughter , Hana . The marriage is thought not to have lasted long , as he was a womanizer . He fathered two out @-@ of @-@ wedlock children , a girl and a boy , with whom he had no contact , but he does appear to have remained strongly attached to Hana . 
 Kunichika was described as having an open , friendly and sincere personality . He enjoyed partying with the geishas and prostitutes of the Yoshiwara district , while consuming abundant amounts of alcohol . His greatest passion , however , was said to be the theater , where he was a backstage regular . His appearance said to be shabby . He was constantly in debt and often borrowed money from the kabuki actors he depicted so admiringly . A contemporary said of him : " Print designing , theater and drinking were his life and for him that was enough . " A contemporary actor , <unk> IV , said that when visiting actors backstage for the purpose of sketching them , Kunichika would not socialize but would concentrate intensely on his work . 
 Around 1897 , his older brother opened the Arakawa Photo shop , and Kunichika worked in the store . Because Kunichika had a dislike for both the store and photography , only one photograph of him exists . 
 In October 1898 Kunichika was interviewed for a series of four articles about him , The Meiji @-@ period child of Edo , which appeared in the Tokyo newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun . In the introduction to the series , the reporter wrote : 
 ... his house is located on the ( north ) side of Higashi Kumagaya @-@ Inari . Although his residence is just a partitioned tenement house , it has an elegant , latticed door , a nameplate and letterbox . Inside , the entry ... leads to a room with worn tatami mats upon which a long <unk> has been placed . The space is also adorned with a Buddhist altar . A cluttered desk stands at the back of the miserable two @-@ tatami room ; it is hard to believe that the well @-@ known artist Kunichika lives here ... Looking around with a piercing gaze and stroking his long white beard , Kunichika talks about the height of prosperity of the <unk> ... 
 During the interview , Kunichika claimed to have moved 107 times , but it seems more likely that he moved only ten times . 
 Kunichika died at his home in <unk> ( an eastern suburb of Edo ) on July 1 , 1900 at the age of 65 , due to a combination of poor health and bouts of heavy drinking brought on by the death at 39 of his daughter Hana while giving birth to his grandson , <unk> Ito , some months previously . He was buried at the Shingon Buddhist sect temple of <unk> in <unk> , Asakusa . His grave marker is thought to have been destroyed in a 1923 earthquake , but family members erected a new one in 1974 . In old Japan , it had been a common custom for people of high cultural standing to write a poem before death . On Kunichika 's grave his poem reads : 
 " Since I am tired of painting portraits of people of this world , I will paint portraits of the King of hell and the devils . " 
 Yo no <unk> no , hito no <unk> mo <unk> , <unk> ya oni no <unk> . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 In 1915 , Arthur Davison <unk> , an Iowa lawyer , poet , and influential collector of Japanese prints , wrote Chats on Japanese Prints . In the book he listed fifty @-@ five artists , including Kunichika , whose work he dismissed as " degenerate " and as " All that meaningless complexity of design , coarseness of color and carelessness of printing that we associate with the final ruin of the art of color prints . " His opinion , which differed from that of Kunichika 's contemporaries , influenced American collectors for many years , with the result that Japanese prints produced in the second half of the 19th century , especially figure prints , fell out of favor . 
 In the late 1920s and early 1930s an author , adventurer , banker and great collector of Japanese art , Kojima Usui , wrote many articles aimed at resurrecting Kunichika 's reputation . He was not successful in his day , but his work became a basis for later research , which did not really begin until quite recently . In 1876 Laurance P. Roberts wrote in his Dictionary of Japanese Artists that Kunichika produced prints of actors and other subjects in the late Kunisada tradition , reflecting the declining taste of the Japanese and the deterioration of color printing . Roberts described him as , " A minor artist , but represents the last of the great ukiyo @-@ e tradition . " The cited biography reflects the author 's preference for classical ukiyo @-@ e . Richard A. Waldman , owner of The Art of Japan , said of Roberts 's view , " Articles such as the above and others by early western authors managed to put this artist in the dustbin of art history . " An influential reason for Kunichika 's return to favor in the western world is the publication , in 1999 , in English , of Amy Reigle Newland 's Time present and time past : Images of a forgotten master : Toyohara Kunichika 1835 – 1900 . In addition , the 2008 show at the Brooklyn Museum , Utagawa : Masters of the Japanese Print , 1770 – 1900 , and a resulting article in The New York Times of 03 / 22 / 08 have increased public awareness of and prices for Kunichika prints .

 " On the Day Before " is the forty @-@ eighth The West Wing episode and fourth of the third season . It originally aired on NBC October 31 , 2001 . The episode deals with a suicide bomber in Jerusalem , as well as continued negotiations over the estate tax . Written by Aaron Sorkin , Paul Redford , and Nanda <unk> , and directed by Christopher Misiano , the episode contains the first appearances by H. Richard Greene as Congressman Robert Royce and Thomas <unk> as Assistant Secretary of State Bob " Bobby " <unk> . There are also guest appearances by Kevin Tighe , Cliff DeYoung and Mary Mara .

 The White House is hosting a dinner for Nobel laureates but the staff keep getting interrupted by various domestic and international crises . As President Bartlet vetoes the bill to repeal the estate tax , it appears that the Republican Party might have the two @-@ thirds majority needed to override the veto . A representative of the dissenting Democrats is brought in to negotiate a deal with Toby and Sam . Meanwhile , Josh is meeting with Indiana Governor Jack Buckland ( Tighe ) to talk him out of a potential primary challenge against Bartlet . Leo is at this point getting exasperated by their own partisans taking advantage of the administration 's weakness due to the impending hearings over the president 's concealment of his MS. He tells Josh to " throw an elbow " and threaten to leak the fact that Buckland tried to blackmail the president . In the end , Josh ends up striking a compromise , while it is Toby and Sam who " throw an elbow " by turning down Democratic Congressman Kimble and offering the same deal to moderate Republican Congressman Robert Royce instead . 
 A Palestinian suicide bomber in Jerusalem causes the death of several Israelis , as well as two American nationals . National Security Advisor Nancy McNally and Leo consider the potential implications of possible retributions and are relieved when the Palestinians respond to American pressure by arresting a leader of a militant group . As Leo points out , however , the solution is likely to be only temporary . 
 Other staff members have their own problems to deal with . Charlie has been offered immunity from the special prosecutors and Leo , among others , suggests he take it . Charlie , however , insists that he will " stay with [ his ] team " . Donna , who in the previous episode ( " Ways and Means " ) went on a date with a Republican congressional aide involved in the investigation , comes clean with Josh . It turns out she met him not only once , but also on another occasion after she had found out what position he held , and Josh is not pleased . C.J. is provoked by an inexperienced lifestyle reporter , Sherri Wexler ( Mara ) , trying to put her in a bad light and responds by embarrassing her in front of a full press room .

 The West Wing episodes were written close to production and at the time of the September 11 attacks Sorkin was writing on episode six of the season ( " Gone Quiet " ) , which originally was to air on Halloween ( October 31 ) . The events caused consternation in the writing staff , and the episode had to be entirely rewritten . " I was kind of paralyzed , " said Sorkin , " I didn 't know what to write " . Because of the attacks , air dates were postponed and the already finished " On the Day Before " became the Halloween episode instead . Nevertheless , the episode took on greater relevance to actual , international events than the writers had intended . On August 9 , after the actors had just done a cold reading of the episode , they were informed about the Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing , a Jerusalem suicide bombing in which an American was killed . The close similarity to an event in the script came as a shock to the actors . " It was mind @-@ blowing , " said Richard Schiff ( Toby ) .

 The title of this episode refers to a conversation that the President has with his staff towards the end of the episode . In it , he tells his staff that at a White House dinner , someone told him that on Yom Kippur Jews ask God for forgiveness , but " on the day before " Yom Kippur , called <unk> Yom Kippur , Jews ask forgiveness from one another . The president remarks that " you can 't ask forgiveness of God until you 've asked forgiveness of people on the day before . " 
 In a reference to the Palestinian leadership , Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization Yasser Arafat is mentioned by name . Even though foreign dignitaries were normally fictional on the show , producer Aaron Sorkin said it felt right to call the Chairman by his real name " ' cause Arafat 's been around forever and he 'll be around forever " . In a later episode , however ( " Gaza " in season five ) , the name of the Chairman of the Palestinian Authority was changed to Nizar <unk> , a fictional character . By that point in mid @-@ 2004 , Arafat was in failing health in real life , and would die in November 2004 . The show continued to use the <unk> character and never made any references to Arafat 's successor Mahmoud Abbas . 
 When the president vetoes the bill , it is said that this is Bartlet 's first veto . In a previous episode , " In This White House " as Sam debates Ainsley Hayes for the first time , it is made clear that the president has in fact previously vetoed a bill . It has been suggested , however , that what was discussed on that occasion was a pocket veto . 
 At one point in the episode , Josh quotes an interview with one of Buckland 's aides in what he calls the Indianapolis Post @-@ Dispatch . No such newspaper exists . The show chose to combine the names of two different newspapers : the Indianapolis Star , and the St. Louis Post @-@ Dispatch .

 = USS Iowa turret explosion = 
 The USS Iowa turret explosion occurred in the Number Two 16 @-@ inch gun turret of the United States Navy battleship USS Iowa ( BB @-@ 61 ) on 19 April 1989 . The explosion in the center gun room killed 47 of the turret 's crewmen and severely damaged the gun turret itself . Two major investigations were undertaken into the cause of the explosion , one by the U.S. Navy and then one by the General Accounting Office ( GAO ) and Sandia National Laboratories . The investigations produced conflicting conclusions . 
 The first investigation into the explosion , conducted by the U.S. Navy , concluded that one of the gun turret crew members , Clayton Hartwig , who died in the explosion , had deliberately caused it . During the investigation , numerous leaks to the media , later attributed to U.S. Navy officers and investigators , implied that Hartwig and another sailor , Kendall Truitt , had engaged in a homosexual relationship and that Hartwig had caused the explosion after their relationship had soured . In its report , however , the U.S. Navy concluded that the evidence did not show that Hartwig was homosexual but that he was suicidal and had caused the explosion with either an electronic or chemical detonator . 
 The victims ' families , the media , and members of the U.S. Congress were sharply critical of the U.S. Navy 's findings . The U.S. Senate and U.S. House Armed Services Committees both held hearings to inquire into the Navy 's investigation and later released reports disputing the U.S. Navy 's conclusions . The Senate committee asked the GAO to review the U.S. Navy 's investigation . To assist the GAO , Sandia National Laboratories provided a team of scientists to review the Navy 's technical investigation . 
 During its review , Sandia determined that a significant overram of the powder bags into the gun had occurred as it was being loaded and that the overram could have caused the explosion . A subsequent test by the Navy of the overram scenario confirmed that an overram could have caused an explosion in the gun breech . Sandia 's technicians also found that the physical evidence did not support the U.S. Navy 's theory that an electronic or chemical detonator had been used to initiate the explosion . 
 In response to the new findings , the U.S. Navy , with Sandia 's assistance , reopened the investigation . In August 1991 , Sandia and the GAO completed their reports , concluding that the explosion was likely caused by an accidental overram of powder bags into the breech of the 16 @-@ inch gun . The U.S. Navy , however , disagreed with Sandia 's opinion and concluded that the cause of the explosion could not be determined . The U.S. Navy expressed regret ( but not an apology ) to Hartwig 's family and closed its investigation .

 Ordered in 1938 under the Second Vinson Act , Iowa was the lead ship of her class of battleship . She was launched on 27 August 1942 and commissioned on 22 February 1943 . Iowa ’ s main battery consisted of nine 16 inch ( <unk> ) / 50 caliber guns . 
 After serving in both World War II and the Korean War , Iowa was decommissioned on 24 February 1958 and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard . She remained in the Reserve Fleet until 1983 . At this time , Iowa was moved to Avondale Shipyards near New Orleans , Louisiana , to undergo a modernization as part of President Ronald Reagan 's " 600 @-@ ship Navy " plan . Under the command of Captain Gerald E. <unk> , she was recommissioned on 28 April 1984 , one year ahead of schedule . In order to expedite the schedule , many necessary repairs to Iowa 's engines and guns were not completed and the mandatory US Navy Board of Inspection and Survey ( InSurv ) inspection was not conducted at that time . 
 Almost two years later , beginning on 17 March 1986 , Iowa underwent her overdue InSurv inspection under the supervision of Rear Admiral John D. Bulkeley . The ship failed the inspection . Among many other deficiencies , the ship was unable to achieve her top speed of 33 knots ( 38 mph ; 61 km / h ) during a full @-@ power engine run . Other problems discovered included hydraulic fluid leaks in all three main gun turrets , totaling 55 US gallons ( 210 L ) per turret per week , <unk> ( <unk> lubricant ) which had not been removed from all the guns , deteriorated bilge piping , frequent shorts in the electrical wiring , pump failures , unrepaired soft patches on high @-@ pressure steam lines , and frozen valves in the ship 's firefighting system . Bulkeley personally recommended to the Chief of Naval Operations ( CNO ) , Admiral James Watkins , and the Secretary of the Navy , John Lehman , that Iowa be taken out of service immediately . Lehman , who had advocated bringing the Iowa @-@ class ships out of mothballs , did not take the ship out of service , but instructed the leaders of the Atlantic Fleet to ensure that Iowa 's deficiencies were corrected . 
 A month after the InSurv , Iowa failed an Operation Propulsion Program Evaluation . A short time later , the ship retook and passed the evaluation . In July 1987 , Captain Larry Seaquist assumed command of the ship . 
 After a deployment to the Persian Gulf , Iowa returned to Norfolk for maintenance on 10 March 1988 . On 23 May , Captain Seaquist was replaced by Captain Fred Moosally as Iowa 's commanding officer . 
 = = = Gunnery training and experiments = = = 
 A week after taking command , Moosally and his executive officer , Mike Fahey , canceled a planned $ 1 million repair package for Iowa 's main gun batteries , including repairs to the main gun turrets ' lighting , electrical , powder hoists , and hydraulic systems — 75 detailed deficiencies in all . Instead , the funds were spent on overhauling the ship 's powerplant . In August 1988 , Iowa set sail on sea trials around the Chesapeake Bay area and then began refresher training in the waters around Florida and Puerto Rico in October . 
 Between September 1988 and January 1989 , sailors aboard Iowa reportedly conducted little training with her main guns , in part because of ongoing , serious maintenance issues with the main gun turrets . According to Ensign Dan Meyer , the officer in charge of the ship 's Turret One , morale and operational readiness among the gun @-@ turret crews suffered greatly . 
 In January 1989 Iowa 's Master Chief Fire Controlman , Stephen Skelley , and Gunnery Officer , Lieutenant Commander Kenneth Michael Costigan , persuaded Moosally to allow them to experiment with increasing the range of the main guns using " supercharged " powder bags and specially designed shells . Moosally was led to believe , falsely , that top officials from Naval Sea Systems Command ( NAVSEA ) had authorized the experiments . In fact , John McEachren , a mid @-@ level bureaucrat with NAVSEA , had given the go @-@ ahead to conduct the experiments even though he had no authority to do so . McEachren concealed his approval of the gunnery experiments from his superiors . 
 Several of the officers and petty officers in charge of the main gun turret crews believed that Skelley 's and Costigan 's proposed experiments were dangerous , especially because of the age of the guns and the turrets , in addition to their numerous maintenance problems . Meyer complained to Commander Robert John Kissinger , Iowa 's chief weapons officer , about the proposed experiments , but Kissinger refused to convey the concerns to Captain Moosally or halt the experiments . 
 On 20 January 1989 , off Vieques Island , Iowa 's Turret One fired six of the experimental shells using the supercharged powder bags . Skelley claimed that one of the 16 inch shells traveled 23 @.@ 4 nautical miles ( 40 km ) , setting a record for the longest conventional 16 inch ( <unk> ) shell ever fired . Although the shells had been fired without serious incident , Meyer and Petty Officer First Class Dale Eugene Mortensen , gun chief for Turret One , told Skelley that they would no longer participate in his experiments . Skelley asked Turret Two 's gun chief , Senior Chief Reggie Ziegler , if he could use Turret Two for his experiments ; Ziegler refused . Skelley then asked Lieutenant Phil Buch , Turret Two 's officer in charge , and Buch acquiesced . 
 A week after the long range shoot at Vieques , Iowa 's new executive officer , Commander John Morse , directed a main battery drill , over the objections of his gun crews , in which Turrets One and Two fired while both were pointed 15 ° off the starboard side of the ship 's bow . At this angle , one of Turret Two 's guns was firing over Turret One . During the shoot , according to Turret Two 's left gun captain , Jack Thompson , one of the powder bags in the left gun began to smolder before the <unk> was closed . Thompson said that he was barely able to close and latch the <unk> before the gun discharged on its own . The concussion from Turret Two 's guns shredded Turret One 's gun bloomers ( the canvas covers at the base of the main gun barrels ) and damaged Turret One 's electrical system . Dan Meyer said of the shoot that it was " the most frightening experience I have ever had in my life . The shock wave blew out the turret officer 's switchboard and the leads . We had no power , no lights for a time . Men were screaming . There was panic . " 
 In February the battleship returned to Norfolk . There Ziegler complained to his wife about the morale , training , and safety situation aboard Iowa , stating , " We 're shorthanded . Chiefs with seventeen years of service are quitting . I 've got to teach these kids to push the right button , or they 'll blow us to kingdom come ! My butt is on the line ! " He added that if he died at sea , he wanted to be buried at sea . Before leaving Norfolk in early April 1989 , Third Class Gunner 's Mate Scot Blakey , a member of Turret Two 's crew , told his sister , Julie Blakey , " I 'm not thrilled with some of the things we 're doing on the Iowa . We shouldn 't be doing them . Something could go wrong . " When Julie asked , " Why are you doing them ? " Scot replied , " We don 't have a choice . " 
 = = = Preparation for fleet exercise = = = 
 On 10 April the battleship was visited by commander of the US 2nd Fleet , ( then ) Vice Admiral Jerome L. Johnson , and on 13 April Iowa sailed from Norfolk to participate in a fleet exercise in the Caribbean Sea near Puerto Rico . The exercise , titled " <unk> 3 @-@ 89 " , began on or around 17 April under Johnson 's command . Iowa served as Johnson 's flagship during the exercise . 
 Throughout the night of 18 April , Turret Two 's crew conducted a major overhaul of their turret in preparation for a firing exercise scheduled to take place the next day . The center gun 's compressed air system , which cleansed the bore of sparks and debris each time the gun was fired , was not operating properly . 
 Also on 18 April , Iowa 's fire @-@ control officer , Lieutenant Leo Walsh , conducted a briefing to discuss the next day 's main battery exercise . Moosally , Morse , Kissinger , and Costigan did not attend the briefing . During the briefing , Skelley announced that Turret Two would participate in an experiment of his design in which D @-@ 846 powder would be used to fire 2700 lb ( 1224 @.@ 7 kg ) shells . 
 The powder lots of D @-@ 846 were among the oldest on board Iowa , dating back to 1943 – 1945 , and were designed to fire 1900 lb ( 861 @.@ 8 kg ) shells . In fact , printed on each D @-@ 846 powder canister were the words , " <unk> : Do Not Use with 2 @,@ 700 @-@ pound projectiles . " D @-@ 846 powder burned faster than normal powder , which meant that it exerted greater pressure on the shell when fired . Skelley explained that the experiment 's purpose was to improve the accuracy of the guns . Skelley 's plan was for Turret Two to fire ten 2 @,@ 700 @-@ pound practice ( no explosives ) projectiles , two from the left gun and four rounds each from the center and right guns . Each shot was to use five bags of D @-@ 846 , instead of the six bags normally used , and to fire at the empty ocean 17 nautical miles ( 30 km ) away . 
 Ziegler was especially concerned about his center gun crew . The rammerman , Robert W. <unk> , was inexperienced , as were the powder car operator , Gary J. Fisk , the <unk> , Reginald L. Johnson Jr . , and the gun captain , Richard <unk> Lawrence . To help supervise Lawrence , Ziegler assigned Second Class Gunner 's Mate Clayton Hartwig , the former center gun captain , who had been excused from gun turret duty because of a pending reassignment to a new duty station in London , to the center gun 's crew for the firing exercise . Because of the late hour , Ziegler did not inform Hartwig of his assignment until the morning of 19 April , shortly before the firing exercise was scheduled to begin . 
 The rammerman 's position was of special concern , as ramming was considered the most dangerous part of loading the gun . The ram was used to first thrust the projectile and then the powder bags into the gun 's breech . The ram speed used for the projectile was much faster ( 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) per second ) than that used for the lighter powder bags ( 1 @.@ 5 feet ( 0 @.@ 46 m ) per second ) , but there was no safety device on the ram piston to prevent the rammerman from accidentally pushing the powder bags at the faster speed . <unk> the powder bags into the gun could subject the highly flammable powder to excessive friction and compression , with a resulting increased danger of premature combustion . Also , if the bags were pushed too far into the gun , a gap between the last bag and the primer might prevent the powder from igniting when the gun was fired , causing a misfire . None of Iowa 's <unk> had any training or experience in ramming nonstandard five @-@ bag loads into the guns . Complicating the task , as the rammerman was shoving the powder bags , he was also supposed to simultaneously operate a lever to shut the powder hoist door and lower the powder hoist car . Iowa crewmen later stated that Turret Two 's center gun rammer would sometimes " take off " uncontrollably on its own at high speed . Furthermore , <unk> had never operated the ram before during a live fire shoot .

 At 08 : 31 on 19 April , the main turret crewmembers were ordered to their stations in Turrets One , Two , and Three . Thirty minutes later the turrets reported that they were manned , swiveled to starboard in firing position , and ready to begin the drill . Vice Admiral Johnson and his staff entered the bridge to watch the firing exercise . Iowa was 260 nautical miles ( 480 km ) northeast of Puerto Rico , steaming at 15 knots ( 17 mph ; 28 km / h ) . 
 Turret One fired first , beginning at 09 : 33 . Turret One 's left gun misfired and its crew was unable to get the gun to discharge . Moosally ordered Turret Two to load and fire a three @-@ gun salvo . According to standard procedure , the misfire in Turret One should have been resolved first before proceeding further with the exercise . 
 Forty @-@ four seconds after Moosally 's order , Lieutenant Buch reported that Turret Two 's right gun was loaded and ready to fire . Seventeen seconds later , he reported that the left gun was ready . A few seconds later , <unk> Lawrence , in Turret Two 's center gun room , reported to Ziegler over the turret 's phone circuit that , " We have a problem here . We are not ready yet . We have a problem here . " Ziegler responded by announcing over the turret 's phone circuit , " Left gun loaded , good job . Center gun is having a little trouble . We 'll straighten that out . " Mortensen , monitoring Turret Two 's phone circuit from his position in Turret One , heard Buch confirm that the left and right guns were loaded . Lawrence then called out , " I 'm not ready yet ! I 'm not ready yet ! " Next , Ernie <unk> , Turret Two 's leading petty officer suddenly called out , " Mort ! Mort ! Mort ! " Ziegler shouted , " Oh , my God ! The powder is smoldering ! " At this time , Ziegler may have opened the door from the turret officer 's booth in the rear of the turret into the center gun room and yelled at the crew to get the breech closed . About this same time , <unk> yelled over the phone circuit , " Oh , my God ! There 's a flash ! " 
 At 09 : 53 , about 81 seconds after Moosally 's order to load and 20 seconds after the left gun had reported loaded and ready , Turret Two 's center gun exploded . A fireball between 2 @,@ 500 and 3 @,@ 000 ° F ( 1 @,@ 400 and 1 @,@ 600 ° C ) and traveling at 2 @,@ 000 feet per second ( 610 m / s ) with a pressure of 4 @,@ 000 pounds @-@ force per square inch ( 28 MPa ) blew out from the center gun 's open breech . The explosion caved in the door between the center gun room and the turret officer 's booth and buckled the bulkheads separating the center gun room from the left and right gun rooms . The fireball spread through all three gun rooms and through much of the lower levels of the turret . The resulting fire released toxic gases , including cyanide gas from burning polyurethane foam , which filled the turret . Shortly after the initial explosion , the heat and fire ignited 2 @,@ 000 pounds ( 910 kg ) of powder bags in the powder @-@ handling area of the turret . Nine minutes later , another explosion , most likely caused by a buildup of carbon monoxide gas , occurred . All 47 crewmen inside the turret were killed . The turret contained most of the force of the explosion . Twelve crewmen working in or near the turret 's powder magazine and annular spaces , located adjacent to the bottom of the turret , were able to escape without serious injury . These men were protected by blast doors which separate the magazine spaces from the rest of the turret . 
 = = Immediate aftermath = = 
 Firefighting crews quickly responded and sprayed the roof of the turret and left and right gun barrels , which were still loaded , with water . Meyer and Kissinger , wearing gas masks , descended below decks and inspected the powder flats in the turret , noting that the metal walls of the turret flats surrounding several tons of unexploded powder bags in the turret were now " glowing a bright cherry red " . On Kissinger 's recommendation , Moosally ordered Turret Two 's magazines , annular spaces , and powder flats flooded with seawater , preventing the remaining powder from exploding . The turret fire was extinguished in about 90 minutes . 
 After the fire was extinguished , Mortensen entered the turret to help identify the bodies of the dead crewmen . Mortensen found Hartwig 's body , which he identified by a distinctive tattoo on the upper left arm , at the bottom of the 20 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) deep center gun pit instead of in the gun room . His body was missing his lower forearms , legs below the knees , and was partially , but not badly , charred . The gas ejection air valve for the center gun was located at the bottom of the pit , leading Mortensen to believe that Hartwig had been sent into the pit to turn it on before the explosion occurred . Mortensen also found that the center gun 's powder hoist had not been lowered , which was unusual since the hoist door was closed and locked . 
 After most of the water was pumped out , the corpses in the turret were removed without noting or photographing their locations . The next day , the bodies were flown from the ship by helicopter to Roosevelt Roads Naval Station , Puerto Rico . From there , they were flown on a United States Air Force C @-@ 5 Galaxy transport aircraft to the Charles C. Carson Center for Mortuary Affairs at Dover Air Force Base , Delaware . 
 Morse directed a cleanup crew , supervised by Lieutenant Commander Bob Holman , to make Turret Two " look as normal as possible " . Over the next day , the crew swept , cleaned , and painted the inside of the turret . Loose or damaged equipment was tossed into the ocean . No attempt was made to record the locations or conditions of damaged equipment in the turret . " No one was preserving the evidence , " said Brian R. Scanio , a fireman present at the scene . A team of Naval Investigative Service ( NIS ) investigators ( the predecessor of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service or NCIS ) stationed nearby on the aircraft carrier Coral Sea was told that their services in investigating Iowa 's mishap were not needed . 
 On 23 April Iowa returned to Norfolk , where a memorial service was held on 24 April . Several thousand people , including family members of many of the victims , attended the ceremony at which President George H. W. Bush spoke . During his speech , Bush stated , " I promise you today , we will find out ' why , ' the circumstances of this tragedy . " 
 Shortly after the memorial service at Norfolk on 24 April , Kendall Truitt told Hartwig 's family that Hartwig had taken out a $ 50 @,@ 000 double indemnity life insurance policy on himself and named Truitt as the sole beneficiary . Truitt was a friend of Hartwig 's and had been working in Turret Two 's powder magazine at the time of the explosion , but had escaped without serious injury . Truitt promised to give the life insurance money to Hartwig 's parents . Unsure if she could trust Truitt , Kathy Kubicina , Hartwig 's sister , mailed letters on 4 May to Moosally , Morse , Costigan , Iowa 's Chaplain Lieutenant Commander James Danner , and to Ohio Senators Howard Metzenbaum and John Glenn in which she described the life insurance policy . She asked that someone talk to Truitt to convince him to give the money to Hartwig 's parents .

 = = = Preliminary = = = 
 Several hours after the explosion , Admiral Carlisle Trost , the Chief of Naval Operations ( CNO ) , issued a moratorium on the firing of all 16 @-@ inch guns . Vice Admiral Joseph S. Donnell , commander of Surface Forces Atlantic , appointed Commodore Richard Milligan to conduct an informal one @-@ officer investigation into the explosion . An informal investigation meant that testimony was not required to be taken under oath , witnesses were not advised of their rights , defense attorneys were not present , and no one , including the deceased , could be charged with a crime no matter what the evidence revealed . 
 Milligan boarded Iowa on 20 April and toured Turret Two . He did not attempt to stop the ongoing cleanup of the turret . Accompanying Milligan to assist him in the investigation was his personal staff , including his chief of staff , Captain Edward F. Messina . Milligan and his staff began their investigation by interviewing members of Iowa 's crew . 
 During Meyer 's interview by Milligan and his staff , Meyer described Skelley 's gunnery experiments . Meyer stated that Moosally and Kissinger had allowed Skelley to conduct his experiments without interference or supervision . At this point , according to Meyer , Messina interrupted , told the stenographer to stop typing , and took Meyer out into the passageway and told him , " You little shit , you can 't say that ! The admiral doesn 't want to hear another word about experiments ! " 
 After reentering the interview room , Meyer told the panel that he and Mortensen had found Hartwig 's body in the gun pit . After his interview was over , Meyer warned Mortensen , who was scheduled to be interviewed later , to be careful with what he said , because , in Meyer 's opinion , Milligan and his staff appeared to have a hidden agenda . Later , when Meyer and Mortensen read transcripts of their interviews with Milligan 's panel , they found that some of what they had said had been altered or expunged , including what Meyer had said about the location of Hartwig 's body . 
 Scanio was interviewed by Milligan and his panel three days later . Scanio , in describing the interview , stated , " I told them everything that exactly happened ... and it seemed that when I said certain things , they just stopped the recorder , and then they 'd go on and ask a different question , and they wouldn 't finish the question they were on . " Scanio said that Milligan would not allow him to identify whose body was found at the bottom of the center gun pit . 
 During his interview , Skelley admitted that he was aware that it was illegal to use D @-@ 846 powder with 2 @,@ 700 @-@ pound rounds . Skelley also admitted that he had no written permission from NAVSEA authorizing his experiments . In his interview with Milligan , Moosally complained that the U.S. Navy had given him a bunch of " misfits " for his crew . 
 Captain Joseph Dominick Miceli , from NAVSEA , was assigned to Milligan 's team to lead the technical investigation into the explosion . Miceli had commanded the Naval Weapons Support Center at Crane , Indiana from 1982 to 1985 . Much of the powder in use on Iowa was bagged under Miceli 's direction at Crane . While at Crane , Miceli had also begun the use of " wear reducing " polyurethane foam jackets on the powder bags . Cyanide gas from the burning foam jackets had killed many of the turret crewmen . Therefore , as noted by Navy officers and later by outside observers , Miceli had a potential conflict of interest regarding any findings that powder or powder bags had contributed to the explosion or to any deaths afterwards . Ted Gordon , former Navy Deputy Judge Advocate General , stated : " Joe Miceli had his own turf to protect . The guns , the shells , the powder were all his responsibility . He had a vested interest in seeing that they were not at fault in the Iowa accident . " 
 = = = Focus on Truitt and Hartwig and media reports = = = 
 Upon receiving Kubicina 's letters concerning Hartwig 's life insurance policy , Morse and Moosally turned them over to Milligan on 7 May . Milligan immediately called Claude Rollins , the NIS regional director in Norfolk , and requested NIS assistance in the investigation . Ted Gordon , the commanding officer of the NIS , objected to opening a formal criminal investigation because Milligan 's investigation was supposed to be informal . Admiral Leon A. Edney , the U.S. Navy 's Vice Chief of Naval Operations , however , told Gordon that formal NIS participation in the investigation under Milligan 's supervision was fine . 
 Meeting with NIS agents at Norfolk on 9 May , Messina explained that Hartwig had been Turret Two 's center gun captain , had been peering into the gun 's breech at the time of the explosion , according to the wounds found on his body , and had likely inserted an ignition device between two of the powder bags as the gun was loaded . Messina told the NIS agents about Hartwig 's insurance policy and that a homosexual relationship had possibly existed between Hartwig and Truitt . Later , Milligan 's team told the NIS that a book called Getting Even : The Complete Book of Dirty Tricks by George <unk> had been found in Hartwig 's locker . Milligan subsequently reported that the book contained instructions on how to construct a bomb . 
 NIS agents Tom Goodman and Ed Goodwin interviewed Kubicina soon after accepting the case . After initially discussing the insurance policy , the agents began asking Kubicina about Hartwig 's sexuality . Kubicina later found out that the U.S. Navy had also interviewed Hartwig 's best friend from high school and lied to him about what she had said . NIS agents interviewed Truitt and repeatedly pressed him to admit to a sexual relationship with Hartwig . Other agents interviewed Truitt 's wife Carole , also pressing her about the sexual orientation of Hartwig and Truitt , asking questions about how often she and her husband had sex , what sorts of sexual acts they engaged in , and whether she had ever had sex with any of Truitt 's crewmates . When Truitt learned of the interview , he advised the NIS that he would not cooperate further with the investigation . A search of Truitt 's locker turned up a burlap bag of the type filled with gunpowder for firing the big guns . Based on this , the insurance policy , Hartwig 's known antipathy for Truitt 's wife , and the belief that Truitt and Hartwig had been sexually involved , the NIS considered Truitt a suspect . Truitt and Hartwig had previously been questioned about being gay in February 1987 , but each denied it and the matter had been dropped . 
 Beginning in May , reports on the NIS investigation began to appear in news media , including The Virginian @-@ Pilot , Newsday , The Washington Post , The New York Times , and the Daily Press , most of which mentioned Hartwig or Truitt by name . The reporters later stated that the information in their stories was leaked to them by sources in the NIS , the U.S. Navy 's Chief of Naval Information ( <unk> ) office , led by Rear Admiral Brent Baker , or by other Department of Defense ( DoD ) officials . On 24 May , the National Broadcasting Company ( NBC ) aired an NBC news story by Fred Francis and Len Tepper that identified Truitt and Hartwig as criminal suspects in the Iowa explosion and implied that the two had been in a homosexual relationship . NIS special agent James <unk> had — without authorization , it was later revealed by NIS officials — given Tepper and Francis classified computer diskettes containing the complete NIS files on the Iowa investigation . Later media reports indicated that the U.S. Navy believed that Hartwig had intentionally caused the explosion after his relationship with Truitt had gone sour . 
 On 25 May at Norfolk , NIS agents Goodman and Mike Dorsey interrogated Seaman David Smith , an Iowa crewman and friend of Hartwig . The NIS agents kept Smith in the interrogation room for 7 hours and 40 minutes and , according to Smith , repeatedly threatened that they would charge him with 47 counts of accessory to murder , perjury , and obstruction of justice unless he admitted that Hartwig had told him that he intended to blow up Turret Two . Smith refused . At 10 p.m. , Smith was allowed to return to Iowa , where he then stood a nine @-@ hour watch . Less than one hour after finishing the watch , Smith was taken back to the NIS building at Norfolk and interrogated for an additional six hours . Finally , Smith claimed that Hartwig had made romantic advances towards him , had shown him an explosive timer , and had threatened to blow up Turret Two . Three days later , however , Smith recanted his statement to the NIS in its entirety when he was asked to reread and reaffirm a transcript of the interrogation , and signed a statement to that effect . Smith 's original statement was later leaked to the media without noting that he had retracted it . 
 = = = Continued focus on Hartwig = = = 
 Lieutenant Commander Thomas <unk> , a clinical psychologist assigned to assist the NIS investigation , asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation 's ( FBI ) Behavioral Analysis Unit for help in compiling a " psychological autopsy " on Hartwig . Visiting the FBI 's facility at Quantico , Virginia , <unk> , Goodman , Goodwin , and NIS employee Dawn Teague explained to FBI special agents Richard Ault and Roy Hazelwood that the Iowa explosion was not an accident , but an act of sabotage . The NIS gave the FBI agents copies of their interviews with several Iowa crewmen , including Smith , and with Hartwig 's family and acquaintances . They did not tell the FBI that Smith had recanted his statement to the NIS . On 15 June , the day after receiving the material about Smith 's interview , Ault and Hazelwood issued a 15 @-@ page " equivocal death analysis " stating that , in their opinion , Hartwig was not homosexual but that he " died as a result of his own actions , staging his death in such a fashion that he hoped it would appear to be an accident " . 
 NIS agents Robert Nigro and Goodman briefed Miceli on their case against Hartwig , telling him that they believed that Hartwig had blown up Turret Two with a Radio Shack timer , and gave him a copy of Smith 's interview . They did not tell Miceli that Smith had recanted his statement or that the NIS had been unable to find any evidence that Hartwig had ever purchased any electronic device from Radio Shack . Miceli directed his team to begin testing to see if an electrical timer could have ignited the powder bags . Technicians at the Navy 's metallurgical laboratory at Norfolk Naval Shipyard tested the copper @-@ nickel @-@ alloy rotating band from the center gun 's projectile , and stated that they had found trace chemical elements , including barium , silicon , aluminum , and calcium , under the band , which indicated that an electronic timer had been used to cause the explosion . Miceli asked the FBI to duplicate the test on the band . After testing the band , the FBI stated that they did not believe an electronic timing device had been present and that chemicals found on the band likely came from Break @-@ Free solvent used by the Navy to extract the projectile from the center gun barrel after the explosion . According to Ken <unk> of the FBI Laboratory , Miceli then abruptly terminated the Navy 's request for assistance from the FBI lab . 
 On 28 August , technicians at the Naval Weapons Support Center at Crane , Indiana confirmed the FBI 's conclusion that an electronic timer , batteries , and / or a primer were not involved in the explosion . Subsequently , Miceli 's team announced that a chemical — not electrical — ignition device had been used to cause the explosion , but the new conclusion was not included in Milligan 's report before the report was released . On 11 August 1989 the Navy , acting on a recommendation from Miceli , recertified the Iowa @-@ class battleship 's 16 @-@ inch ( 410 mm ) guns for operation . 
 = = = Investigation conclusion = = = 
 On 15 July 1989 Milligan submitted his completed report on the explosion to his chain of command . The 60 @-@ page report found that the explosion was a deliberate act " most probably " committed by Hartwig using an electronic timer . The report concluded that the powder bags had been <unk> into the center gun by 21 inches ( 53 cm ) , but had been done so under Hartwig 's direction in order to trigger the explosive timer that he had placed between two of the powder bags . 
 Donnell , on 28 July , endorsed Milligan 's report , saying that the determination that Hartwig had sabotaged the gun " leaves the reader incredulous , yet the opinion is supported by facts and analysis from which it flows logically and inevitably " . Donnell 's superior , Atlantic Fleet Commander Admiral Powell F. Carter , Jr . , then endorsed the report , adding that the report showed that there were " substantial and serious failures by Moosally and Morse " , and forwarded the report to the CNO , Carlisle Trost . Although Miceli had just announced that test results at Dahlgren showed that an electronic timer had not caused the explosion , Trost endorsed the report on 31 August , stating that Hartwig was " the individual who had motive , knowledge , and physical position within the turret gun room to place a device in the powder train " . Trost 's endorsement cited Smith 's statement to the NIS as further evidence that Hartwig was the culprit . Milligan 's report was not changed to reflect Miceli 's new theory that a chemical igniter , not an electrical timer , had been used to initiate the explosion . 
 On 7 September , Milligan and Edney formally briefed media representatives at the Pentagon on the results of Milligan 's investigation . Edney denied that the Navy had leaked any details about the investigation to the press . Milligan stated that the Navy believed Hartwig had caused the explosion , citing , among other evidence , the FBI 's equivocal death analysis on Hartwig . Milligan displayed two books , Getting Even and Improvised Munitions Handbook , which he said belonged to Hartwig and provided " explicit " instructions on how to construct detonators and bombs . Milligan and Edney said that there was no proof that Hartwig was homosexual . Edney then stated that the investigation had proved that the Iowa @-@ class battleships were safe to operate and that the powder in use on the ships " is stable and ready to use " . 
 Most of the victims ' family members criticized the Navy 's conclusions . Many of the families told media representatives of private misgivings that the victims had expressed to them about problems with training and the dangerous gunfire experiments occurring on Iowa before the explosion . Hartwig 's family disputed the allegations that he was depressed and suicidal . 
 Several journalists immediately began questioning the results of Milligan 's investigation . John Hall , a reporter for the Richmond Times @-@ Dispatch , wrote a series of four articles beginning on 17 September that revealed that Iowa was engaged in illegal powder experiments when the gun blew up ; that conflicts of interest were evident in the investigators assigned to the inquiry ; that many of the ship 's crew were improperly or inadequately trained ; and that evidence did not support the Navy 's theory that Hartwig caused the explosion . The Associated Press picked up Hall 's story and it was run in other newspapers throughout the United States . Robert Becker and A. J. Plunkett from the Daily Press wrote a lengthy story which criticized Milligan 's report in detail . ABC reporter Robert Zelnick wrote an op @-@ ed piece , which ran in The New York Times on 11 September , heavily criticizing the Navy for , in Zelnick 's words , " scapegoating a dead seaman . " Television <unk> 20 / 20 and 60 Minutes both ran stories questioning the Navy 's conclusions . The Washington Post , in contrast , ran a story by George Wilson that generally supported the Navy 's findings . 
 On 3 October , Donnell disciplined Iowa 's officers in response to findings in Milligan 's report . Moosally and Bob Finney , Iowa 's operations officer , were given <unk> " letters of admonition " which were not placed in their permanent personnel records . Kissinger and Skelley received punitive letters of admonition which were placed in their records , as well as fines of $ 2 @,@ 000 and $ 1 @,@ 000 respectively . Donnell suspended both fines . Shortly thereafter , the Navy issued a statement explaining that the safety violations and training deficiencies found aboard Iowa during the investigation were unrelated to the explosion . Two weeks later , a panel of thirteen admirals recommended that Moosally be given another major command , stating that Moosally was " superbly fit " for such responsibility . Milligan was one of the admirals on the panel who supported the recommendation . After 60 Minutes producer Charles Thompson asked Brent Baker and Chief of Naval Personnel Jeremy Michael Boorda about the recommendation , Moosally 's name was withdrawn . 
 = = = Congressional inquiries = = = 
 Ohio Senators Howard Metzenbaum and John Glenn were concerned with the Navy 's conclusions and arranged to hold a hearing on the Navy 's investigation in the Senate Armed Services Committee ( SASC ) , chaired by Sam Nunn . Also , Congresswoman Mary Rose Oakar asked Nicholas <unk> , chairman of the Investigations Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee to look into the Navy 's findings and schedule hearings . John Glenn asked the General Accounting Office ( GAO ) to review the Navy 's investigation into the explosions as well as to examine the unauthorized gunfire experiments and other unsafe practices that may have occurred on Iowa and review the Navy 's utilization of the four Iowa @-@ class battleships . 
 The first Senate hearing took place on 16 November 1989 . Trost , Milligan , Miceli , and Robert Powers from the NIS testified at the hearing and were questioned by Senators Glenn , Alan Dixon , John McCain , and James Exon . The senators questioned the Navy officers about the lack of adequate training on Iowa ; the age and condition of the ship 's powder ; problems with the center gun 's rammer ; the illegal gunfire experiments ; the methods used and conclusions reached in the investigation ; and the series of leaks to the media from Navy and NIS personnel . 
 On 11 December 1989 Moosally testified before the SASC . He denied that Iowa had carried out illegal or unauthorized gunfire experiments . In response to questions from the senators , Moosally stated that he believed the explosion was an intentional act , but that he could not support Milligan 's conclusion that Hartwig was the culprit . During the hearing , Sam Nunn announced that Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque , New Mexico , had agreed to a request by the GAO to assist with the Navy 's technical investigation to see if there might be a natural explanation for the explosion . Later , FBI agents Ault and Hazelwood appeared before the committee and answered questions about how they had prepared their equivocal death analysis on Hartwig . In addition , Truitt plus two other Iowa sailors and acquaintances of Hartwig testified that Hartwig was not suicidal and that the Navy was trying to " cover up " that the explosion was likely an accident . 
 On 12 , 13 , and 21 December , the House Armed Services Committee held its hearings into the Navy 's investigation . The committee , including <unk> , Les Aspin , Larry Hopkins , Norman <unk> , and Joseph Brennan , interviewed Donnell , Ault , Hazelwood , Milligan , Miceli , Truitt , <unk> , and Richard <unk> , the Armed Services Medical Examiner . 
 In early March 1990 , the House Armed Services Committee released its report , titled USS Iowa Tragedy : An Investigative Failure . The report criticized the Navy for failing to investigate every natural possible cause before concluding that the explosion was an intentional act . The report also criticized the Navy for allowing the turret and projectile to become contaminated ; for permitting evidence to be thrown overboard ; for endorsing Milligan 's report prior to completing the technical investigation ; and for neglecting to disclose the nature of the disagreement with the FBI laboratory over substances found on the projectile 's rotating band . The FBI 's equivocal death analysis was labeled the " single major fault of the investigation " . The NIS 's actions in the investigation were described as " flawed " and the NIS agents assigned to the case were criticized for unprofessional interviewing techniques and for leaking sensitive documents and inaccurate information . Finally , the report concluded that Milligan was unfit to oversee a major criminal investigation . 
 = = Sandia investigation = = 
 = = = Initial inquiries = = = 
 Forty scientists from Sandia , led by Richard Schwoebel , began an independent technical inquiry into the explosion on 7 December 1989 . In order to investigate the Navy 's theory that an electronic or chemical ignition device had been used to cause the explosion , Schwoebel asked Miceli to examine the projectiles removed from Turret Two 's left and right guns to compare with the one taken from the center gun . Miceli informed Schwoebel that both projectiles had been misplaced and he could not locate them . 
 At a 16 January 1990 meeting with the Sandia scientists , Steve Mitchell , a technician from Indian Head Naval Surface Warfare Center , reported that his team had discovered that the propellant pellets making up the powder in Iowa 's powder bags could fracture and give off hot fragments in drop tests , and that the fractured surface often had a burnt appearance and odor . At this point , according to Schwoebel , Miceli interjected and said , " This kind of thing can 't be duplicated during the actual loading operation . This result is not relevant to the explosion . " Mitchell added that his team had found it extremely unlikely that friction or static electricity could have ignited the center gunpowder bags . Tom Doran , a member of Miceli 's team from Dahlgren , reported that his team had conducted tests to see if an overram could have caused the explosion , but revealed that the tests had used bags filled with wooden pellets with black powder pouches at the ends , not actual powder bags . 
 Sandia investigators asked if two similar explosions on the battleship USS Mississippi could be related to the Iowa explosion . In 1924 and 1943 , open breech explosions had occurred in the Turret Two center gun aboard Mississippi , each time killing most of the crewmen in the turret . Miceli 's team responded that the explosions were not related , because the Mississippi incidents were not actual explosions , but " intense burnings " of the powder which resulted from different causes than the Iowa incident . A staff officer from Naval Sea Systems Command , Rear Admiral Robert H. Ailes , told Sandia that the Mississippi explosions " would not be discussed " . 
 Sandia 's chemical and materials analysis group , headed by James Borders , investigated further the theory about a chemical igniter . Navy technicians stated that the discovery under the center gun 's projectile 's rotating band of minute steel @-@ wool fibers that were encrusted with calcium and chlorine , a fragment of polyethylene terephthalate ( commonly used in plastic bags ) , and different glycols , including brake fluid , hypochlorite , antifreeze , and Brylcreem together indicated the use of a chemical igniter . The Navy was unable to locate the steel @-@ wool fiber evidence for Borders to examine . No untouched portions of the rotating band remained and Sandia was provided with a section to examine that had already been examined by the FBI . Borders ' team examined the rotating band and did not find any traces of polyethylene terephthalate . The team found that the glycols present actually came from the Break @-@ Free cleaning solution which had been dumped into the center gun 's barrel to help free the projectile after the explosion . The team also found that calcium and chlorine were present in Iowa 's other gun turrets and in the gun turrets of the other Iowa @-@ class battleships , and that this was indicative of routine exposure to a maritime environment . Borders concluded that ordinary sources accounted for all of the " foreign materials " found by the Navy on the center gun projectile , and that the theory that a chemical igniter had been used to cause the explosion was extremely doubtful .

 Karl Schuler , a member of Sandia 's team , determined that the five powder bags in Turret Two 's center gun had been rammed 24 inches ( 61 cm ) into the gun , farther than the 21 inches ( 53 cm ) that the Navy had estimated in Milligan 's report . After spending 50 hours exploring the ramifications on a Cray supercomputer , Schuler concluded that this overram , combined with the 2 @,@ 800 pounds @-@ force per square inch ( 19 MPa ) of pressure produced by the rammer , likely compressed the powder bags to the point that they had ignited . Mel Baer , a Sandia team member , determined that the explosion likely occurred in the vicinity of the first ( most forward ) powder bag , corroborating the Navy 's conclusion on this point . 
 Another group of Sandia investigators , directed by Paul Cooper , conducted 450 drop tests using small bags of D @-@ 846 powder in late March to early May 1990 . The team determined that the " tare " or " trim " layer ( a small amount of powder placed at the end of each bag to equalize the bag 's weight , inserted in the mid @-@ 1980s when the powder was mixed and <unk> under Miceli 's direction ) would often ignite when compressed at high speed . Cooper found that the burning fragments did not ignite adjacent powder in the same bag , but instead would burn through the bag material and ignite the adjacent bag 's black powder patch and thereby ignite the rest of the bags . The week of 7 May , Schwoebel asked Miceli to conduct drop tests at Dahlgren using five actual bags of powder compressed into a steel cylinder of the same diameter as a 16 @-@ inch gun . Miceli responded that Cooper 's finding " has no relation to actual 16 @-@ inch gun conditions " and refused repeated requests from Sandia to conduct the tests . 
 Concerned that Miceli 's refusal to conduct full @-@ scale drop tests was placing Navy gun crews at risk , on 11 May Schwoebel contacted Rick DeBobes , Nunn 's counsel for the SASC . On 14 May 1990 , a letter from Nunn was sent to Trost requesting that the Navy conduct the tests as requested by Sandia and that Sandia be allowed to observe the tests . That same day , Miceli 's supervisor , Vice Admiral Peter <unk> , commander of Sea Systems Command , called Sandia 's president , Al <unk> , and told him that the Navy would conduct the full @-@ scale drop tests as requested and Sandia was invited to participate . 
 The drops tests were conducted at Dahlgren under Miceli 's and Tom Doran 's direction . The tests consisted of vertically stacking five D @-@ 846 powder bags under an 860 @-@ pound ( 390 kg ) weight and dropping them three feet onto a steel plate to simulate a high @-@ speed overram in a 16 @-@ inch gun barrel . On 24 May 1990 on the 18th drop test , witnessed by Cooper and Schuler , the powder bags exploded , destroying the entire testing apparatus . Miceli immediately told <unk> , who notified the Navy 's leadership to halt any further use of 16 @-@ inch guns and to reopen the Navy 's investigation . 
 = = = Findings = = = 
 The next day Schwoebel , Schuler , Cooper , and Borders publicly briefed the SASC in the Hart Senate Office Building on the results of their investigation , stating that , in Sandia 's opinion , the explosion had occurred because of an overram of the powder caused by either an accident due to human error or an equipment failure . In his closing remarks the committee chairman , Sam Nunn , rejected Milligan 's finding that the explosion had resulted from an intentional act . Nunn added that Milligan 's conclusions were not supported " by reliable , probative , and substantial evidence " . Nunn later criticized the NIS , saying , " The Navy 's whole investigative technique here should be under serious question . " 
 Also testifying before the Senate on 25 May was Frank C. Conahan from the GAO . Conahan reported that the GAO had found that the Iowa @-@ class battleships were not assigned an equal share of personnel in comparison with other Navy ships , especially in the main gun department . The GAO observed that the nonjudicial punishment rate on the battleships was 25 % higher than for the rest of the Navy . Conahan concluded by suggesting that , because of the issues surrounding the limited deployment availability of the battleships , they " seem to be top candidates for deactivation as we look for ways to scale back US forces . "

 After the Senate hearing , the Secretary of the Navy , Henry L. Garrett III , reopened the investigation . Nunn , via DeBobes , directed that no one associated with the first investigation , especially Milligan or Miceli , be involved with the second . In spite of this request , the Navy chose Miceli to lead the new investigation but continuously report on his progress to a technical oversight board . On 30 June 1990 Frank Kelso relieved Trost as CNO and Jerome L. Johnson replaced Edney as vice @-@ chief . Shortly thereafter , DeBobes visited Kelso in the Pentagon and suggested that it was not a good idea to leave Miceli in charge of the reinvestigation . Kelso listened but declined to remove Miceli . Sandia , at the Senate 's request , remained involved in the investigation . The Navy stated that it expected the reinvestigation to be completed in six months . 
 In June and July 1990 , Miceli 's team conducted overram tests using a full @-@ scale mock @-@ up of a 16 @-@ inch ( 410 mm ) gun breech . The tests were conducted at rammer speeds of 2 , 4 , 8 , and 14 feet per second ( 4 @.@ 3 m / s ) . One of the tests at 14 feet per second ( 4 @.@ 3 m / s ) caused an explosion in the breech . Cooper and Schuler , who were observing the tests , reported to Schwoebel that , in their opinion , Miceli tried to limit the scope of the testing and conduct most of the ram tests at lower speeds . The Sandia team members also noted that Miceli refused to allow his civilian technicians to test alternate overram scenarios and appeared to , by various means , deliberately delay the progress of the investigation . 
 During further overram testing by Miceli 's team , four more explosions occurred . Tom Doran , a civilian member of Miceli 's team , told Schwoebel on 18 July that his tests had shown that overram explosions could occur much more easily and at slower speeds depending on the configuration of loose pellets in the powder bags . Doran reported that Miceli then ordered him not to conduct further testing along that avenue of inquiry . 
 In August 1990 , the Navy lifted the restriction on firing 16 @-@ inch guns . The Navy removed the trim layers from the 16 @-@ inch powder bags , added a color @-@ coded system on the 16 @-@ inch gun ram to indicate the slow @-@ speed ram position , and instructed gun crews to conduct additional training on rammer operations . 
 In November 1990 , Cooper discovered the two missing Turret Two left and right projectiles in a warehouse at Dahlgren . Cooper and other Sandia scientists examined the shells and found the same iron fibers and chemicals on the two shells that had been found on the center gun projectile . Said Schwoebel , " It should have ended the Navy 's case against Hartwig right then and there . " The Navy disagreed that the materials found on all three shells were the same . 
 = = = Conclusion = = = 
 On 3 July 1991 Miceli briefed the NAVSEA technical oversight board and stated that his investigation supported the Navy 's original theory that the explosion was an intentional act . Although Sandia representatives were present at Miceli 's briefing , the board members did not invite Sandia to rebut or comment on Miceli 's assertions . 
 Sandia 's final findings were submitted to the Senate in August 1991 and included in the GAO 's report on its investigation . Schwoebel 's team concluded that the fibers and various chemical constituents found by the Navy on the center gun projectile were unrelated to the explosion . The team found that an overram had occurred , but could not determine the speed at which the rammer had compressed the powder bags against the projectile . Sandia found that the overram had likely caused the explosion and that the probability was 16 @.@ 6 % of selecting a group of five @-@ bag charges from the propellant lot aboard Iowa that was sensitive to ignition by overram . The report stated that , in Sandia 's opinion , the explosion had occurred immediately with the overram — that there was no delay as theorized by the Navy . Sandia theorized that the overram may have occurred due to inadequate training of some members of the center gun crew ; a poorly conceived , briefed , and executed firing plan that contributed to confusion ; and — possibly — a malfunction of the rammer . Sandia 's report concluded that the probability of powder ignition in the 16 @-@ inch guns by an overram was such that measures needed to be taken to ensure that <unk> were precluded at any speed . The GAO report concluded that the possibility of an overram @-@ caused explosion was a " previously unrecognized safety problem " . Schwoebel 's team also briefed Admiral Kelso at the Pentagon on their findings . 
 On 17 October 1991 , 17 months after the Navy reopened the investigation , Kelso conducted a press conference at the Pentagon to announce the results of the Navy 's reinvestigation . Kelso noted that the Navy had spent a total of $ 25 million on the investigation . He stated that the Navy had uncovered no evidence to suggest that the gun had been operated improperly , nor had it established a plausible accidental cause for the explosion . Kelso stated , " The initial investigation was an honest attempt to weigh impartially all the evidence as it existed at the time . And indeed , despite the Sandia theory and almost two years of subsequent testing , a substantial body of scientific and expert evidence continue to support the initial investigation finding that no plausible accidental cause can be established . " Kelso added that the Navy had also found no evidence that the explosion was caused intentionally . He further announced that he had directed the Navy to never again use an informal board composed of a single officer to investigate such an incident . Kelso concluded by offering " sincere regrets " to the family of Clayton Hartwig and apologies to the families of those who died , " that such a long period has passed , and despite all efforts no certain answer regarding the cause of this terrible tragedy can be found " .

 Turret Two was trained forward with its own mechanism after the explosion , and superficial repairs were conducted . All the related repair pieces were stored inside the turret and the turret was sealed shut . The turret was never put back into operation . 
 Iowa decommissioned in Norfolk on 26 October 1990 . As part of the National Defense Reserve Fleet , she was berthed at the Naval Education and Training Center in Newport from 24 September 1998 to 8 March 2001 , when she began her journey under tow to California . The ship was stored at Suisun Bay near San Francisco from 21 April 2001 to 28 October 2011 as part of the Reserve Fleet there . In May 2012 , Iowa was towed to San Pedro , California , and is now a floating museum . 
 From August 1990 to February 1991 , the Iowa @-@ class battleships Wisconsin and Missouri were deployed to the Persian Gulf . The two battleships fired 1 @,@ 182 16 @-@ inch shells in support of Gulf War combat operations without mishap .

 Milligan and Miceli retired from the Navy in 1992 as a rear admiral and captain , respectively . Milligan later taught economics at the Naval Postgraduate School , then became vice president of a national insurance company . 
 Captain Moosally retired at that rank in May 1990 . At his change of command ceremony on Iowa on 4 May , Moosally criticized the Navy for mismanaging the investigation , saying that the investigators were " people who , in their rush to manage the Iowa problem , forgot about doing the right thing for the Iowa crew " . Later , Moosally began working for Lockheed Martin in the Washington , D.C. area . In 2001 , Moosally told the Washington Post , " Only God knows what really happened in that turret . We 're never really going to know for sure . " 
 Skelley was transferred to the battleship Wisconsin in late 1990 or early 1991 and helped direct that ship 's gunnery participation during the Gulf War . He retired from the Navy in the fall of 1998 . 
 Meyer resigned in 1991 . In his resignation letter , he complained about the Navy 's investigation into the explosion , and Miceli 's and other officers ' roles in what Meyer claimed was a cover @-@ up . The letter was passed to Vice Admiral Jeremy Michael Boorda , then chief of the Bureau of Naval Personnel , who requested , unsuccessfully , that Meyer withdraw it . When Meyer subsequently received his discharge papers , he discovered that statements in his letter criticizing the Navy and certain officers had been removed . Following assignment to the Middle East Force during Desert Shield and Desert Storm , Meyer followed through with his resignation , and matriculated at the Indiana University School of Law at Bloomington . Meyer later served as the director of civilian reprisal investigations for the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Defense . As one of two director @-@ level leaders of the Department of Defense Whistleblower Program , he conducted and oversaw allegations of whistleblower reprisal made by DoD civilian employees and submitted to the Inspector General . 
 Kendall Truitt was denied reenlistment , reportedly in retaliation for his speaking to the press and defending Hartwig . He was discharged on 9 February 1990 . He continued his effort to clear Hartwig 's name in statements to the media .

 The New York Times in 1993 severely criticized the U.S. Navy for a series of botched investigations , including the Tailhook scandal , the Iowa explosion , security breaches at the U.S. embassy in Moscow , Russia , and a problematic investigation into the murder of a homosexual sailor in Yokosuka , Japan . The newspaper stated , " Each fumbled inquiry may have exposed a different U.S. Navy foible . The repeated bungling suggests a systemic problem in the Naval Investigative Service -- and a management failure at the highest levels . " 
 Schwoebel , in 1999 , published a book titled Explosion Aboard the Iowa on his experience directing Sandia 's investigation into the explosion . In the book , Schwoebel concluded that , in his opinion , the Iowa incident and aftermath illustrated that high @-@ consequence incidents should be investigated by an independent group instead of by a self @-@ assessment , as had occurred with the U.S. Navy investigating itself in this case . He also observed that abuse results when a powerful organization attempts to manipulate the press , as the U.S. Navy had apparently tried to do through leaks of information about the investigation . Furthermore , Schwoebel noted the unfair and indiscriminate recitation by the press of the sensational material leaked by the U.S. Navy . Finally , he observed that the U.S. Navy was lacking a due process in military justice as it related to deceased personnel . 
 Also in 1999 , Charles Thompson published a book , titled A Glimpse of Hell : The Explosion on the USS Iowa and Its Cover @-@ Up , documenting his investigation into the explosion and its aftermath . The book was extremely critical of many of Iowa 's officers , including Moosally , as well as many of the officers involved with the subsequent U.S. Navy investigation , and the NIS . The book received favorable reviews and was selected by the Military Book of the Month Club as its featured selection in March 1999 . Thompson stated that after the book was published , a previously scheduled invitation to speak at the U.S. Navy 's National Museum was rescinded , his book was banned from being sold in the museum 's book store , and Navy exchange stores at bases throughout the world were forbidden from selling his book . E @-@ mails between U.S. Navy officials obtained by Thompson through a Freedom of Information request included one from a U.S. Navy public affairs officer saying with regard to Thompson , " I will call book wholesalers and tell them not to set up book signings with this author . " In 2001 , the FX television network broadcast A Glimpse of Hell , a made @-@ for @-@ TV movie . Starring James Caan and Robert Sean Leonard , the movie was based on Thompson 's book . According to Nielsen Media Research , A Glimpse of Hell received a 3 @.@ 3 household rating and drew 2 @.@ 7 million viewers , which was enough to make the movie the most @-@ watched program in FX 's seven @-@ year history . 
 Alan E. Diehl , a former safety manager for the U.S. Navy , described the USS Iowa incident in his 2003 book Silent Knights : Blowing the Whistle on Military Accidents and Their Cover @-@ Ups . Diehl called the incident and its aftermath the worst military cover @-@ up he had ever seen . 
 An episode of the TV series JAG was based upon the incident .

 On 19 April 1991 , the Hartwig family sued the Navy for " intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress " under the Federal Tort Claims Act . On 30 June 1992 the Hartwigs added another count of emotional distress to the lawsuit , after the Navy sent a letter to Hartwig 's parents inviting the dead sailor to join the US Navy Reserve . The Hartwigs sued for emotional distress in order to avoid the limitations imposed by the Feres Doctrine . The DoD asked for a dismissal of the Hartwigs ' suit on grounds of sovereign immunity , but in May 1993 , US District Judge Paul R. <unk> ruled in Cleveland that the Hartwigs ' suit could proceed . After discovery , the government again moved for dismissal . On 26 January 1999 Magistrate Judge David Perelman issued a recommendation to grant dismissal because several years of discovery had revealed that defamation was essential to the Hartwigs ' claims , and that pure defamation claims were barred by sovereign immunity . The Hartwig family filed objections , but on 10 November 1999 District Judge Solomon Oliver , Jr. adopted the recommendation to dismiss , ruling that " however hurtful the government 's action may have been , they cannot form the basis of a claim against the United States . " 
 The Hartwigs sued NBC News for $ 10 million for emotional distress , claiming that the reports by Fred Francis had falsely portrayed Hartwig as a suicidal mass murderer . NBC responded by claiming that it could not be held liable , because its information had come directly , via leaks , from the NIS . A federal judge dismissed the suit . 
 Thirty @-@ eight of the other Iowa victims ' family members filed suit against the Navy , seeking $ 2 @.@ 35 billion in damages for the death of their family members in the explosion . Citing the Feres case , US District Judge Claude M. Hilton in Alexandria , Virginia , summarily dismissed the suit . 
 In March 2001 Moosally , Miceli , Morse , and Finney filed suit against Glimpse of Hell author Thompson , his publisher , W.W. Norton , and Dan Meyer , who the plaintiffs stated provided much of the information used in the book , for libel , false light privacy , and conspiracy . In April 2001 Mortensen filed a separate suit for the same causes of action . In response to the suit , Thompson stated that he stood " foursquare " behind his book 's content . 
 In April 2004 , the South Carolina Supreme Court dismissed the suits against Thompson and Meyer , but allowed the suit against W. W. Norton to proceed . In February 2007 the suit was settled out @-@ of @-@ court for undisclosed terms . Stephen F. DeAntonio , an attorney for the plaintiffs , said that they felt " totally vindicated " . W. W. Norton did not publicly retract or repudiate any of the material in Thompson 's book , however , instead sending a letter to the former officers stating , in part , " To the extent you believe the book implies that any of you were engaged in a cover @-@ up , were incompetent , committed criminal acts , violated Naval regulations or exhibited faulty seamanship or professional ineptitude , Norton regrets the emotional distress experienced by you or your family . "

 A small memorial to the 47 sailors killed in the explosion was erected at " Iowa Point " on Norfolk Naval Station . Each year after the accident on 19 April a memorial service is held at Norfolk by former Iowa crewmembers and family members of those killed in the explosion . 
 At the 1999 ceremony , retired Navy Captain Larry Seaquist , who had commanded Iowa before Moosally , spoke to former Iowa crewmen and families of the 47 sailors killed in the explosion . Seaquist criticized the Navy for misleading families about its investigation and harassing family members , adding " It would have been very nice if the leadership of the Navy would have been here to say something simple to you , like ' We apologize . ' " In response , a Navy spokesman said , " What Captain Seaquist says is his opinion . It 's his right . " 
 The first memorial ceremony on the ship since she was decommissioned took place on 19 April 2012 .
