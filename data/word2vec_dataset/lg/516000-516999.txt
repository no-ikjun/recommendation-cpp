 In its original American broadcast , " Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy " finished 58th in the ratings for the week of November 28 to December 4 , 1994 , with a Nielsen rating of 9 @.@ 5 . The episode was the third highest rated show on the Fox network that week . 
 Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , the authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , said it was " an amazing episode , in which Homer actually has an argument with someone , rather than backing down . As he and his father drift further apart , so the family are at a loss at what to do . You can 't help but feel sorry for Grampa as a piece of Simpson family history goes up in flames " . Nate Meyers at Digitally Obsessed praised Dan Castellaneta 's role in the episode and said : " Dan Castellaneta 's work as both Homer and Grampa Simpson in [ the episode ] is full of emotion and brilliant comic timing . Watch the closing scene carefully as Homer returns to his childhood home , because Castellaneta gracefully dances between a tender father @-@ son relationship and flat @-@ out comedy " . Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said he " didn ’ t remember this as a very good episode , but it actually turns out to be quite strong . The initial plot in which Homer and Marge can ’ t get it together offers plenty of funny moments , and the scenes in which Homer battles with his dad offer depth and much humor . It ’ s also hard to beat the children 's fears of the reverse vampires " .

 = Desolate North = 
 Desolate North is the debut studio album by the funeral doom metal band Celestiial , first released by Bindrune Recordings on June 6 , 2006 . It comprises the five tracks from Celestiial 's demo , Ashen , combined with three more tracks recorded separately . It was written , performed and recorded entirely by Tanner Anderson , the member of Celestiial , and was never written to be an album or to be performed . The Bindrune CD release is out @-@ of @-@ print , but Desolate North is still available digitally and in LP @-@ format , the latter having been released by music distributor Handmade Birds in 2011 . 
 The album received mixed reviews — some critics claimed it was fresh and a new sound , while others argued it was very similar to music already available . Desolate North has an extremely slow rhythm and has only limited vocals . The music is interspersed with various woodland sounds , such as running water and footsteps . The natural imagery used on the album is reminiscent of that used in black metal , but the music is closer to ambient . 
 = = Recording = = 
 The album was recorded in three parts . First , Anderson recorded the music for Ashen . This was done in a wooden loft in the corner of the rehearsal space used by Azrael , of whom Anderson was , at the time , a member . Anderson has said that he does not remember how long this recording took him , as he slept there after finishing the work . He described that space as perfect for the recording , as there was nothing there to distract him . 
 As the entire album was recorded and played by Anderson , the only option was to record the music in layers . First , he recorded the drums , using a drum kit . However , he was unhappy with the way they sounded , and so re @-@ recorded on a drum machine . The next layers to be recorded were the guitar , bass and vocals , with other sounds being added later . 
 The other three songs on Desolate North one was recorded at the same place in early 2005 , and the other two , the harp pieces , were recorded at Anderson 's home . He has said how this was the most difficult part of the recording . As it happened , Anderson misplaced his microphone stand and so recorded those two songs with the microphone tucked under his chin . Despite the hindrance , Anderson claimed that the microphone picked up everything , and he was happy with the result . 
 Anderson has described the process as giving the album a " raw " sound , and he has hypothesized that it is because of the raw sound of the album that critics have described his work as having influences from black metal . Although the album 's production was criticised by Ignacio Coluccio of Maelstrom , Kim Kelly , of Pivotal Alliance , praised the album for its high quality recording , explaining that it " is not raw , <unk> black metal at all " . 
 = = Release = = 
 A small number of copies of Ashen were sent to various people . Marty <unk> , of Bindrune Recordings , was the only person attached to a record label to receive one , and Celestiial was then taken on by Bindrune . Anderson was very happy with this , as he had been an avid reader of Worm Gear ( a magazine attached to the label ) when he was younger . Despite the fact that Anderson had not written Desolate North with the intention of it ever being released , in 2006 , it was released by Bindrune Recordings . The CD version released by Bindrune Recordings is now out of print . However , in 2011 , the album was rereleased in vinyl LP format by Handmade Birds , and the album remains available in digital format . 
 = = Musical style = = 
 Desolate North has been described as taking " the template of the funeral doom genre ... and disembowel [ ing ] the formula even further " . The album makes use of minimal vocals , instead relying on electronics , guitars , and syncopated drums ( with liberal use of cymbals ) . These sounds are also backed up by more traditional instruments , such as harps and Native American flutes . Additionally , sampled sounds — including footsteps , water , birdsong and wind — are used . 
 Celestiial is a funeral doom metal band . However , Desolate North has been described as taking the genre in new directions with comparisons to ambient , goth , experimental , and dark folk music being made . The music has also been described as meditative and medieval . 
 Anderson admits that there may be death metal influences in the vocals , but says that it was not a conscious design , and that the music does not have any other similarities to death metal . He claims that there are no black metal influences . He says that describing Celestiial 's music as folk is a bad idea , as folk is such a broad , vague description as to make it meaningless . He says that what he is creating is neither folk , nor traditional , and even the harp songs are not traditional works , though they are influenced by the traditional music of the United Kingdom and traditional Irish music . 
 = = Imagery = = 
 Desolate North uses imagery very much based around nature , with natural sounds sampled in the music , and imagery involving woodland , and , as one reviewer put it , " the scary places that we all fear when the lights are out " . Bindrune recordings describes this affinity for nature by saying that " Celestiial was created to mirror mysticism in nature . " 
 Brandon <unk> , of Pitchfork Media , talked of a black metal influence in the album 's imagery . Anderson responded to the claim of black metal influence by stating that he does not know why people compare his music to black metal ; he hypothesized that it is simply the raw production of the music , or the double ' i ' in the band name . 
 Anderson was once asked about whether there were any pagan beliefs in Celestiial . He responded that Celestiial " is romanticized Paganism with very real Pagan values behind it " . He talked of how Celestiial celebrated paganism and the natural world , but that paganism is often viewed as something that it is not . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Desolate North received mixed reviews . The album garnered positive reviews from a number of <unk> , with comparisons to founders of the genre , such as <unk> . AllMusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia , however , felt that Desolate North compared negatively with the efforts of more prominent bands , concluding that " Celestiial could be a hell of a lot worse , but they could be much better , too . " Scott Seward of Decibel Magazine felt that the music compared well to similar bands , said that Anderson " makes beautiful sounds out of the darkness that others would rather run from " . 
 Reviewers disagreed on the originality of the music — while Seward claimed that it was new and inventive , Murat Batmaz , of Maelstrom , said that it was very typical funeral doom metal . Negative reviews and comments talked about the poor production and guitars , and the lack of speed in the music , combined with the monotony of the sound . Seward felt that the album " is not ' heavy ' music in the least , if we ’ re talking volume and crunch " , but that " it is ' heavy ' music if we ’ re talking about the end product : a deep and pervasively creepy atmosphere that is compelling in its use of silence and hushed reverence for the forest floor " .

 = 1996 Oman cyclone = 
 The 1996 Oman cyclone ( also known as Cyclone 02A ) was a tenacious and deadly system that caused historic flooding in the southern Arabian Peninsula . It originated from a disturbance in the Gulf of Aden , the first such tropical cyclogenesis on record . After moving eastward , the system interacted with the monsoon trough and became a tropical storm on June 11 . Later that day , it turned toward Oman and struck the country 's southeast coast . It weakened over land , dissipating on June 12 , although it continued to produce rainfall – heavy at times – over the next few days . 
 Offshore Oman , the storm 's rough waves disabled an oil tanker and damaged a fishing boat , killing one person in the latter incident . Striking Oman , the storm produced significant rainfall totals well above the monthly average , peaking at 234 mm ( 9 @.@ 2 in ) in the Dhofar region . Strong winds where the storm moved ashore damaged buildings and the local water plant . The rains washed out roads and isolated villages , killing two people due to drowning in Al @-@ <unk> . However , the effects were more severe in Yemen , where the floods were considered the worst on record . The storm produced the heaviest rainfall in 70 years , reaching 189 mm ( 7 @.@ 4 in ) in Ma 'rib . Flood waters washed away or damaged 1 @,@ 068 km ( 664 mi ) of roads and 21 bridges , some of them dating back 2 @,@ 000 years to the Roman era . The storm washed away the topsoil or otherwise wrecked 42 @,@ 800 ha ( 106 @,@ 000 acres ) of crop fields , accounting for US $ 100 million in agriculture damage . At least 1 @,@ 820 houses were destroyed , many of them built on wadis , or dry river beds . Overall damage was estimated at US $ 1 @.@ 2 billion , and there were 338 deaths in Yemen . The World Bank assisted in a project to rebuild the damaged infrastructure in Yemen and to mitigate against future floods . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On May 31 , a weak circulation persisted over the warm waters of the Gulf of Aden between Yemen and Somalia . Its origins were unknown , possibly the convergence of the sea breeze along the coast of Somalia with the monsoon flow . The system produced convection , or thunderstorms , along both coasts of the body of water . As it moved east @-@ northeastward along the coast of Yemen and Oman , the disturbance brought dry air from the north , which decreased the convection . It moved farther offshore on June 7 into the open Arabian Sea , where it interacted with the south @-@ west monsoon and developed more convection . 
 The area of thunderstorms persisted about 1 @,@ 480 km ( 920 mi ) northeast of Somalia by June 9 . It became circular as the circulation became more defined , fueled by the instability from the monsoon trough . Wind shear was expected to prevent significant development , although the system organized enough that the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on June 10 . On the next day , the agency initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 02A about 160 km ( 100 mi ) from the Oman coastline . This marked the first occasion that a tropical cyclone originated from a system in the Gulf of Aden . 
 After becoming a tropical storm , the system 's structure became more aligned as it developed an anticyclone aloft . Fueled by water temperatures of 29 ° C ( 84 ° F ) , the cyclone intensified further . At 03 : 00 UTC on June 11 , the Omani city of <unk> recorded sustained winds of 75 km / h ( 45 mph ) , and a station on Masirah Island recorded a pressure of 994 mbar ( 29 @.@ 4 inHg ) . On this basis , the JTWC estimated that the storm attained peak winds of 75 km / h ( 45 mph ) . However , a nearby ship reported sustained winds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) , and the well @-@ defined structure on satellite imagery suggested winds as strong as 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . Moving northwestward , the cyclone made landfall around 09 : 00 UTC on June 11 about 130 km ( 80 mi ) southwest of Masirah Island in southeastern Oman , at a location named Ras Madrakah . It quickly weakened over the desert terrain and dry air , and the circulation dissipated by June 12 over the central portion of the country . However , the remnants turned to the southwest , steered by a northerly flow . It entered the Rub ' al Khali , or Empty Quarter , of Saudi Arabia late on June 12 , and continued slowly westward . The storm 's interaction with the monsoon brought the intertropical convergence zone northward into Oman and Yemen , bringing unusually heavy rainfall until the system gradually wound down . 
 The IMD – the official warning agency for the basin – did not track the cyclone . In general , tropical cyclone forecast models failed to predict that the storm would form . 
 = = Impact = = 
 The precursor to the storm dropped heavy rainfall in Oman , reaching 29 mm ( 1 @.@ 1 in ) in <unk> on May 31 . The storm later produced intense precipitation across the coast and desert regions of the country . Masirah recorded 48 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) of rainfall over 36 hours , compared to the average monthly average of 1 mm ( 0 @.@ 039 in ) , while Salalah reported 36 mm ( 1 @.@ 4 in ) , or 600 % of the average June rainfall . However , the heaviest rainfall occurred on June 11 and into the following day , when the system drew moisture into mountainous parts of the Dhofar region . A station called Jebel <unk> recorded 234 mm ( 9 @.@ 2 in ) over 48 hours , including 143 mm ( 5 @.@ 6 in ) on June 11 . Farther north , heavy rainfall occurred in the Al Hajar Mountains , where 201 mm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) was recorded , mostly over eight hours ; there , 71 @.@ 8 mm ( 2 @.@ 83 in ) of precipitation was recorded over two hours . 
 Offshore the Arabian Peninsula , the cyclone produced rough waves that disabled an oil tanker ; the crew was rescued by the Omani Coast Guard after being stranded for a few days . A fishing boat was damaged after being washed ashore near Ras Madrakah , killing one person in the crew of nine . Near where the storm moved ashore , the storm 's strong winds heavily damaged the village of Ras Madrakah . Considered the worst storm in memory , the cyclone wrecked workshops and buildings , including damaging the roof of the desalination plant , leaving residents without water for several days . Strong winds of over 93 km / h ( 58 mph ) knocked down 20 trees in Rima that were planted to provide shade for government buildings . Across the storm 's track through Oman , the rains replenished water levels in aquifers , while also washing out roads and isolating villages . This lack of transportation prevented prompt repair work . The <unk> al @-@ <unk> desert was flooded for over a month due to the storm , killing two people due to drowning in Al @-@ <unk> . The floods provided grazing for the endangered oryx population , although many livestock were killed . Three airports in the country were closed due to floods up to four days . 
 Damage was heaviest in Yemen , where the storm 's remnants dropped the heaviest rainfall in 70 years . Ma 'rib recorded 189 mm ( 7 @.@ 4 in ) of rainfall , and the capital Sana 'a reported 164 mm ( 6 @.@ 5 in ) of precipitation . Widespread flooding affected much of Yemen , the worst on record for the country . Damage was heaviest in three governorates – Hadhramaut , Shabwah , and Ma 'rib – with lesser effects in three other governorates . The waters washed away or damaged 1 @,@ 068 km ( 664 mi ) of roads and 21 bridges , including the primary road crossing Hadhramaut . Some of the damaged roads were built 2 @,@ 000 years prior under the Roman Empire . Primary highways were damaged in 16 locations . Thousands of cars and other vehicles were inundated , necessitating boat travel to transport injured residents . About 2 @,@ 300 m ( 7 @,@ 500 ft ) of power lines was cut . The floods washed away 113 power poles , and four main generators were affected , causing widespread outages . Storm debris contaminated also many drinking wells and damaged 1 @,@ 357 water pumps damaged . About 80 % of Shabwah Governorate lost water access , forcing some residents to drink from contaminated wadis , or formerly dry river beds . About one @-@ third of gabions – structures to help with flood control – were damaged or destroyed , as were 634 dykes . 
 Many Yemeni villages were isolated , and the entirety of <unk> and <unk> provinces were inaccessible within <unk> Governorate . The floods destroyed 1 @,@ 820 houses , many of them washed away , and many others were damaged , leaving 22 @,@ 842 families homeless . The storm washed away the topsoil or otherwise wrecked 42 @,@ 800 ha ( 106 @,@ 000 acres ) of crop fields . The storm also knocked over 37 @,@ 000 fruit trees and killed 13 @,@ 000 livestock , accounting for about US $ 100 million in agriculture damage . About 70 % of arable land in Shabwah Governorate was washed away . The floods littered about 25 km ( 16 mi ) of irrigation canals with sand . Many of the houses and fields were built on wadis which were swept away when water levels rose . The floods also damaged or destroyed 43 health facilities and 53 schools . Overall , 338 people were killed by the floods in Yemen , and damage was estimated at US $ 1 @.@ 2 billion , according to the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters . However , Yemen 's General Secretariat for Natural Disasters and Relief estimated damage at US $ 200 million , which accounted for 12 % of the country 's GDP .

 After the worst of the floods ended , the Yemeni government created a Flood Relief High Committee to coordinate incoming aid and relief distribution . The Ministry of Health coordinated the transportation and storage of goods . Workers quickly repaired roads and airports . In Shabwah , CARE and Oxfam repaired damaged pumps and wells to restore access to clean water , and the German government sent a team to restore water access in Ma 'rib Governorate . The widespread destruction of crop fields caused many tribes to abandon their ancestral land . Many of the residents left homeless either stayed with families or relatives , or resided in temporary shelters , where there were reports of malaria , typhoid , and diarrhea . The government provided building materials to rebuild houses . In the immediate aftermath , the local Red Cross chapter distributed about 1 @,@ 300 blankets , 200 tents , and 200 sets of cooking tools . Stagnant waters in Yemen caused a locust outbreak in August 1996 that affected Saudi Arabia for the next three months . Officials used over 350 @,@ 000 l ( 92 @,@ 000 US gal ) of pesticide in response to the outbreak . The heavy rural damage depressed the regional economy in 1996 and 1997 . 
 On June 17 , the government of Yemen issued an appeal for international aid , while also declaring four governorates as disaster areas . After the severe flooding occurred , 20 countries and various international organizations provided money or relief goods to Yemen , amounting to US $ 14 million . Yemen 's needs were determined by a survey between officials in the Ministry of Electricity and workers in the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs . Several departments within the United Nations provided assistance as well toward a crop assessment , drugs , and wheat flour . The World Health Organization provided medical supplies to the country . The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies provided 3 million water tablets , along with cash and general supplies . The European Commission ( precursor to the European Union ) donated about US $ 186 @,@ 000 to the Yemeni Red Cross , and other European countries – France , Germany , Italy , the Netherlands , Norway , Spain , Sweden , Switzerland , and the United Kingdom – also provided assistance . Other countries in the Middle East also sent supplies to Yemen . Neighboring Oman sent 28 metric tons of food , and Qatar sent US $ 1 @.@ 2 million worth of food , blankets , and tents . Syria sent US $ 5 million worth of food aid . As part of a plan toward preventing future floods , the World Bank provided US $ 14 @.@ 5 million to rebuild roads , power and water plants , and regrowing lost crops . 
 In the months after the floods , the government of Yemen sought help from the International Development Association to prevent future floods from being as damaging . The government created an Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project that was geared toward more long term solutions . Thousands of farmers benefited from the improved irrigation and from the employment opportunities . Roads and bridges were rebuilt to a higher construction standard using local builders and contractors , the first such occurrence in the country using competitive bidding . The project was completed in December 2001 at a cost of US $ 31 @.@ 59 million ; the International Development Association paid US $ 27 @.@ 44 million , and Yemen 's government provided the rest of the funding . 
 = HMS Anne ( 1915 ) = 
 HMS Anne was a seaplane carrier of the Royal Navy used during World War I. Converted from the captured German freighter Aenne Rickmers , the ship 's two aircraft conducted aerial reconnaissance , observation and bombing missions in the Eastern Mediterranean and Red Sea during 1915 – 17 even though the ship was not commissioned into the Royal Navy until mid @-@ 1915 . She was decommissioned in late 1917 and became a Merchant Navy collier for the last year of the war . Anne was sold off in 1922 and had a succession of owners and names until she was scrapped in 1958 . 
 = = Description = = 
 Anne was 367 feet 1 inch ( 111 @.@ 89 m ) long , had a beam of 47 feet 7 inches ( 14 @.@ 5 m ) , and a draught of 27 feet 3 inches ( 8 @.@ 31 m ) . She was rated at 4 @,@ 083 gross register tons ( GRT ) . The ship had one propeller shaft powered by one triple @-@ expansion steam engine that used steam generated by an unknown number of coal @-@ fired boilers . Anne had a maximum speed of 11 knots ( 20 km / h ; 13 mph ) . 
 = = Career = = 
 The merchant ship SS Aenne Rickmers was built by Rickmers of Bremerhaven in 1911 . On the outbreak of war in August 1914 , she was seized whilst in Port Said , Egypt and was requisitioned for service under the Red Ensign of the British Merchant Marine in January 1915 to operate seaplanes . No special modifications were made to the ship ; the aircraft were stowed on the aft hatch covers and handled with her cargo booms . Aenne Rickmers operated two French Nieuport floatplanes that had been off @-@ loaded by the French seaplane carrier <unk> ; they were flown by French pilots with British observers . 
 For the first two months of 1915 , the ship and her aircraft supported Allied operations in Syria , Palestine and the Sinai Peninsula . Aside from reconnaissance duties , they delivered and recovered Allied agents as well as observed for ships performing coastal bombardments . On 4 March , Aenne Rickmers was ordered to join several Allied ships that were going to bombard Smyrna , Turkey . A week later , she was torpedoed by the Turkish torpedo boat Demir Hisar . The ship was hit by one torpedo in the Number 1 cargo hold ; this was full of timber which limited water ingress and saved her from sinking . Aenne Rickmers arrived at Mudros the following day to begin repairs , but the repair crew was withdrawn a week later to work on the damaged battlecruiser HMS Inflexible . The seaplane carrier HMS Raven II ( another merchant conversion ) arrived on 20 March to load her aircraft and crew , leaving only a five @-@ person skeleton crew behind . During a storm on 6 April , the ship dragged her anchors and ran aground on a sandy beach . She was temporarily repaired there and refloated on 12 May , sailing to Alexandria , Egypt two days later for permanent repairs and to off @-@ load her cargo . This was completed by 18 June , but the ship lay idle until the end of the month when she was provided with an Arab crew and sailed to Port Said . 
 Aenne Rickmers rendezvoused with the French armoured cruiser Jeanne d 'Arc on 18 July at Scarpanto and the carrier searched the Turkish coast for U @-@ boat bases and observed while the French ship bombarded coastal installations . The ship then returned to Port Said where she was fitted with a 12 @-@ pounder gun . Aenne Rickmers was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 5 August 1915 and renamed HMS Anne the same day . She rendezvoused with Jeanne d 'Arc and the French pre @-@ dreadnought battleship Jauréguiberry around 13 August and observed while they bombarded Turkish installations in Haifa . On 17 August , aircraft from both Anne and Raven II spotted for Jeanne d 'Arc as she bombarded Tarsus and then assisted Jeanne d 'Arc and Jauréguiberry on 30 August as they captured Ruad Island . 
 In early September , the ship assisted the French as they evacuated Armenian troops and civilians from Alexandretta and the surrounding area and then resumed her earlier work of reconnaissance and espionage . Anne lost her first aircraft when it suffered an engine failure whilst on a reconnaissance mission over Beersheba on 9 October . The ship had her bottom cleaned in Alexandria during November and lost another aircraft , again over Beersheba , on 22 December . In January 1916 , she was assigned to the East Indies and Egypt Seaplane Squadron together with the carriers Empress , Ben @-@ my @-@ Chree and Raven II . The squadron was under the command of the General Officer Commanding , Egypt and its primary duty was to watch Turkish positions and movements in southern Palestine and the Sinai in early 1916 . Around 17 April , Anne was attacked by two German aircraft , but was not damaged . A few days later , she discovered a U @-@ boat base at <unk> , whilst operating near Kastellorizo . The ship loaded aboard the French seaplane contingent in Egypt at the end of the month , and delivered it to Malta on 9 May for transfer , including her own Nieuports , to the French seaplane carrier Campinas . Her aircraft had made a total of 118 flights since she began operating them in January 1915 and only two had been lost . 
 Later that month , Anne exchanged her existing 12 @-@ pounder for an anti @-@ aircraft gun of the same calibre and was back at Port Said by 21 May . She lay idle there until mid @-@ June when she began transporting military supplies between Port Said and several ports in the Red Sea . This lasted until 2 August when she embarked British seaplanes , including Short Type 184 , Sopwith Schneider and Baby floatplanes , and she observed for the French cruiser Pothuau on 10 August as the latter ship bombarded <unk> . The East Indies and Egypt Squadron reassembled in late August with Raven II , Anne and Ben @-@ my @-@ Chree and the aircraft from the three carriers attacked the Turkish supply dump at El Afule for thirty minutes . The squadron then steamed south along the Palestinian coast where they encountered two Turkish supply dhows . One was sunk by the escorting French destroyer <unk> while the other was captured . The squadron flew off seven aircraft that attacked an encampment at Bureir and a nearby railroad viaduct . One of Anne 's seaplanes was lost during this mission and the pilot was captured . Despite the loss , her aircraft bombed Turkish installations at Tull <unk> , Nablus , Ludd and Ramleh before returning to Port Said on 27 August . 
 A few days later , Anne replaced Raven II , after that ship had been damaged by an air attack on 1 September , on an expedition into the Red Sea to support the Arab Revolt against the Turks . She rendezvoused with the elderly cruiser HMS Fox and Dufferin of the Royal Indian Marine ( RIM ) and they arrived at Rabigh on 9 September . The ship briefly ran aground off <unk> , but got off and was able to observe for Fox and Hardinge of the RIM as they shelled Turkish positions near <unk> on 13 September . Aside one brief visit to Suez to recoal , Anne remained in the area while her aircraft flew bombing and reconnaissance missions until she was relieved by Raven II on 26 October . The ship was idle at Port Said for the rest of the year other than one trip to Cyprus transporting coal . In January 1917 , Anne returned to the Red Sea and joined Hardinge and the Armed boarding steamer Suva . Together with some 500 Arabs , the crews of the three ships made an amphibious landing and captured <unk> . The ship returned to Suez on 27 January and seems to have been used only as a collier until she was paid off on 8 August . 
 = = = Commercial service = = = 
 Anne served as a collier under the Red Ensign from 29 January 1918 until the end of the war under the management of F. C. Strick and Co . She was sold in 1922 to S.N. Vlassopoulos of Greece and was renamed <unk> . The ship was sold to a Romanian company in 1939 and renamed Moldova ; she was then transferred to Panamanian registry in 1942 with the same name . Moldova was sold in 1949 to <unk> & Co. and renamed <unk> in 1954 . She resumed her former name of Moldova in 1955 and arrived at Hong Kong to be scrapped on 8 November 1958 . 
 = I Blame Myself = 
 " I Blame Myself " is a song by American recording artist Sky Ferreira from her debut studio album Night Time , My Time ( 2013 ) . It was released in the United Kingdom on June 9 , 2014 by Capitol Records as the second single from the record . The song was written and produced by Ariel Rechtshaid and Justin Raisen , with additional songwriting provided by Ferreira , Daniel Nigro , and Jordan Benik . " I Blame Myself " is a synthpop song , in which Ferreira acknowledges that she is responsible for her public image . 
 Contemporary music critics commended " I Blame Myself " in their reviews of Night Time , My Time , and placed particular praise on its production . An accompanying music video for the track was filmed in Compton , California and directed by Grant Singer ; it was premiered through <unk> on April 16 , 2014 . It depicts Ferreira as a gang leader , who is called in to settle a conflict between rivaling groups . She has performed the track on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in April 2014 .

 In February 2014 , it was reported that " Boys " would be serviced as the second single from Night Time , My Time , following its lead single " You 're Not the One " which had been premiered in September 2013 . However , Capitol Records instead released the song as a free digital download in the United Kingdom on March 1 , preceding the launch of Night Time , My Time in the country . " I Blame Myself " was confirmed as the official second single from the record in April , while Ferreira was filming its accompanying music video . 
 " I Blame Myself " was written and produced by Ariel Rechtshaid and Justin Raisen , with additional songwriting provided by Ferreira , Daniel Nigro , and Jordan Benik . Rechtshaid and Raisen additionally collaborated for the drums . Individually , <unk> contributed vocal production , while Raisen was responsible for recording , Pro Tools engineering , additional vocals , synthesizers , and mixing . <unk> Beach provided additional vocals for the track , while Jeremiah Raisen assisted during its production . 
 Ferreira commented that she had co @-@ written the track during summer 2013 ; she sings " 10 years old without a voice / I feel like nothing 's really changed / Now I 'm just a little older " during the second verse , which she revealed was inspired by a two @-@ year period in which she did not speak because she felt like she had had nothing to offer . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Drawing from synthpop music , " I Blame Myself " incorporates minimalist production <unk> with styles commonly seen in new wave music . Distinguished as the " poppiest " track from Night Time , My Time , its lyrics see Ferreira accepting that her behavior contributes to the public image she is given by the media ; during the chorus , she states " I just want you to realize I blame myself for my reputation . " " I Blame Myself " was assumed to have been inspired by the " anthemic pop fizz " from her breakthrough single " Everything Is Embarrassing " from her second extended play Ghost ( 2012 ) . Jenn Pelly from Pitchfork Media implied that " I Blame Myself " referenced the struggles Ferreira faced while creating her long @-@ delayed debut studio album ; Pelly suggested that the track was inspired by her frequent conflicts with her record label during production of the project , and added that it " lays out the emotional core " of her process . Jillian Mapes from the same publication assumed that Ferreira crafted the song in response to being labeled a " socialite [ and ] Forever 21 model " and receiving criticism after her drug arrest in September 2013 , which she expected would highlight that her side projects " have nothing to do with the kind of songs Ferreira writes these days " . " I Blame Myself " , in addition to the tracks " 24 Hours " and " Love in Stereo " , blend " tenderized vocal hooks [ and ] chiming synth melodies " , which reminded Lauren Martin from Fact of 1980s music . With his similar observation , Dan Keenan from Impact noted that the " chiming synths " that Martin recognized developed into the " undeniably cathartic " refrain .

 " I Blame Myself " received generally favorable reviews from contemporary music critics . Writing for The A.V. Club , Annie Zaleski called the track the " most stunning song " from Night Time , My Time ; she commended Ferreira 's " confident " vocal delivery and the " strident tone " of the recording , which Zaleski felt was " deeply affecting . " Dan Keenan from Impact felt that its lyrics showcased that pop music is not always equivalent with insincerity . Writing for Pitchfork Media , Carrie Battan felt that " I Blame Myself " sounded like " an uptempo beast " that deserved to be successful . Jordan Sargent from Spin felt that " I Blame Myself " positively exemplified a " darkness " among the stand @-@ out tracks from the record , which he credited to having her adolescence " drained away by airplane flights , photo shoots , and useless recording sessions " . The New York Times ' Jon Caramanica was unsure why Ferreira " [ painted ] such a dark picture of herself " with the lyrics , and felt that the self @-@ punishment was unnecessary given the strength of " I Blame Myself " and Night Time , My Time overall . John Preston from <unk> believed that the track was a worthy substitute for fans that " mourn the overall departure " of the mainstream pop sound of Ferreira 's 2010 single " One " , and raved that it was an example of " airy and gleaming brilliance " . 
 Two critics from Pitchfork Media reviewed " I Blame Myself " separately from Night Time , My Time . Jenn Pelly ranked the track as the twelfth @-@ best song released in 2013 . She spoke favorably of its lyrical content , commending the chorus lyrics " How could you know what it feels like to fight the hounds of hell ? " and " You think you know me so well " for painting Ferreira as an exemplar for " bullied high school weirdos " , and appreciating that the lines " I know it 's not your fault / That you don 't understand / I blame myself " for acknowledging her own wrongdoings with the intention of starting anew . Jillian Mapes complimented the " bluntness " that was delivered throughout the song , and suggested that the track had " anthem potential " . She praised the verses for verbalizing self @-@ confidence issues that are often associated with young women , with particular acclaim being placed on the lines " I ’ m just a face without a choice / Trust you ’ d never like to guess what I think above the shoulders . " She concluded her review by noting that the song should be recognized as a " declaration of force [ and ] a song about the power of vulnerability " rather than confusing it for an " admission of weakness " .

 An accompanying music video for " I Blame Myself " was filmed in Compton , California and directed by Grant Singer . During an interview with Idolator , Ferreira commented that " I can 't really give too many details about it yet , but I shot it in L.A. with Grant Singer , who does all my other videos . And my family ’ s in it . " A 15 @-@ second preview of the project was released on April 14 , 2014 , while the final product was premiered through the online retailer <unk> on April 16 , 2014 . It was the first of several " <unk> " music videos released through the retailer , in partnership with London magazine System . The clip was inspired by the visuals for 1990s hip hop music and the catalog of Michael Jackson , which Ferreira revealed " inspire me and played a big part of my childhood . " 
 The video depicts an ongoing conflict between gangs , which Ferreira attempts to remedy upon her arrival ; she is eventually taken in for questioning by law enforcement , although she resists her arrest and later escapes from jail . She commented that its concept was inspired by real events , and elaborated that " people always ask me questions about certain things , and it 's kind of like my response . " Jeremy Gordon from Pitchfork Media interpreted Ferreira 's commentary to be referencing her arrest in September 2013 , in which she was charged with possession of ecstasy . Ferreira was criticized on social media networks for allegedly objectifying African American people in the music video , with whom she was seen dancing with during several scenes interspersed throughout the clip . On her Facebook account , Ferreira commented that " I never have and never will look at any human being as a prop " and criticized false assumptions of the " rich little white girl exploiting the black people and the ghetto " .

 Having appeared as the musical guest that evening , Ferreira performed " I Blame Myself " on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on April 5 , 2014 . She was dressed in a sequined blazer , a white shirt , black shorts , a black tie , and sunglasses . Ferreira stood in place while singing the track ; the onstage visuals consisted of several blue and red strobe lights . Having taken place before the music video was made publicly available , she revealed that the visuals for the song had been filmed and would be released shortly .

 = Mycena intersecta = 
 Mycena intersecta is a species of mushroom in the Mycenaceae family . First reported as a new species in 2007 , it is known only from central Honshu , in Japan , where it is found growing solitarily or scattered , on dead leaves in lowland forests dominated by oak . The mushrooms have olive @-@ brown caps up to 12 mm ( 0 @.@ 47 in ) in diameter atop slender stems that are 50 to 80 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 to 3 @.@ 1 in ) long by 0 @.@ 7 to 1 @.@ 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 03 to 0 @.@ 05 in ) thick . On the underside of the cap are the distantly spaced , whitish gills that have cross @-@ veins running between them . Microscopic characteristics of the mushroom include the smooth , irregularly cylindrical cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the gill edge ) , the absence of pleurocystidia ( cystidia on the gill face ) , the diverticulate elements of the cap cuticle , the broadly club @-@ shaped to irregularly shaped caulocystidia ( cystidia on the stem ) , the weakly dextrinoid flesh ( staining reddish to reddish @-@ brown in Melzer 's reagent ) , and the absence of clamp connections . The edibility of the mushroom is unknown . 
 = = <unk> and naming = = 
 The mushroom was first collected by Japanese mycologist Haruki Takahashi in 1999 , and published as a new species ( along with seven other Japanese Mycenas ) in a 2007 publication . The specific epithet is from the Latin word intersecta or " intersected " , and refers to the intervenose gills . Its Japanese name is <unk> @-@ ashinagatake ( <unk> ) . 
 According to Takahashi , the fungus is best classified in the section Fragilipedes ( Fr . ) Quél . , as defined by the Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap of M. intersecta is initially conical to convex to bell @-@ shaped , eventually reaching 8 to 12 mm ( 0 @.@ 31 to 0 @.@ 47 in ) in diameter . When it is moist , it is partly translucent , so that the outlines of the gills underneath the cap can be seen . The cap is somewhat hygrophanous , and dry . Its surface is initially minutely pruinose ( as if covered with a fine white powder ) , but this effect soon sloughs off , leaving the surface smooth . The cap color is initially olive @-@ brown to yellowish @-@ brown , then somewhat paler from the margin . The white flesh is up to 0 @.@ 7 mm thick , and lacks any distinctive taste and odor . The slender stem is 50 to 80 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 to 3 @.@ 1 in ) long by 0 @.@ 7 to 1 @.@ 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 03 to 0 @.@ 05 in ) thick , cylindrical , and hollow . Its surface is dry , and colored pale olive @-@ brown near the top , becoming olive @-@ brown downward . Like the cap , it is at first pruinose , but smooths out in age . The base of the stem is covered with coarse white hairs . The gills are adnate to subdecurrent ( running slightly down the length of the stem ) , and distantly spaced , with 16 – 19 gills reaching the stem . The gills are up to 1 @.@ 5 mm broad , thin , somewhat intervenose , and whitish , with edges that are the same color as the gill faces . Takahashi 's description does not include any discussion of the mushroom 's edibility .

 The basidiospores are roughly ellipsoid and measure 7 @.@ 5 – 8 @.@ 5 by 5 – 6 µm . They are thin @-@ walled , smooth , colorless , and inamyloid to weakly amyloid — indicating a weak ability to absorb the iodine in Melzer 's reagent . The spore @-@ bearing cells , the basidia are 22 – 31 by 5 @.@ 5 – 7 µm , club @-@ shaped , and mostly two @-@ spored . The cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the gill edge ) are 27 – 40 by 3 – 6 µm , abundant , and form a sterile gill edge . They are irregularly cylindrical to constricted , smooth , colorless , and thin @-@ walled . Pleurocystidia ( cystidia on the gill face ) are absent . The hymenophoral tissue is made of thin @-@ walled hyphae that are 5 – 18 µm wide , cylindrical , smooth , colorless , and weakly dextrinoid . The cap cuticle is made of parallel , bent @-@ over hyphae that are 2 – 6 µm wide , cylindrical , and densely covered with warty or finger @-@ like thin @-@ walled diverticulae that are colorless and inamyloid . The layer of hyphae underneath the cap cuticle are parallel , olive @-@ brown , and weakly dextrinoid , with short and inflated cells up to 22 µm wide . The stem cuticle is made of parallel , bent @-@ over hyphae that are 2 – 4 µm wide , cylindrical , smooth to sparsely diverticulate . These hyphae curve outward to form club @-@ shaped or irregularly shaped caulocystidia ( cystidia on the stem ) that are olive @-@ brown , inamyloid , and thin @-@ walled . They measure 13 – 29 by 3 – 7 µm , and are broadly club @-@ shaped to irregularly shaped , and often have one to three knob @-@ like excrescences . The stem tissue is made of longitudinally running , cylindrical hyphae that are 5 – 12 µm wide , smooth , colorless , and have a weakly dextrinoid in Melzer 's reagent . Clamp connections are absent in all tissues of M. intersecta .

 = Evanescence ( Evanescence album ) = 
 Evanescence is the self @-@ titled and third studio album by the American rock band Evanescence . It was released on October 7 , 2011 on Wind @-@ up Records . The band began writing the album in June 2009 . Its release was delayed several times ; on February 22 , 2010 , the band entered the studio with producer Steve Lillywhite but later stopped working with him because he " wasn 't the right fit " . At the time the album was scheduled for an August or September 2010 release , but Lee later announced that Evanescence had suspended recording to write more material . On April 11 , 2011 , the band returned to the studio with producer Nick Raskulinecz . 
 According to Lee , the band brought influences from Björk , Depeche Mode , Massive Attack , MGMT and Portishead to the album . Evanescence 's songs contain sounds and influences characteristic of nu metal , hard rock and electro . Although the album received generally @-@ positive reviews from music critics , who praised Lee 's vocals and its innovative sound , some noted a similarity to the band 's older material . Evanescence debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart with 127 @,@ 000 copies sold in its first week , and topped four other Billboard charts ; Rock Albums , Digital Albums , Alternative Albums and Hard Rock Albums . The album was successful worldwide , appearing on the charts of over twenty countries . The band promoted Evanescence by premiering songs online on a number of websites and appearing on several television shows . 
 The first single from the album , " What You Want " , was released on August 9 , 2011 ; " My Heart Is Broken " , the album 's second single , was released on November 11 . " Lost in Paradise " was released internationally as its third single on May 25 , 2012 , and " The Other Side " was distributed to U.S. modern rock radio stations as a promotional single on June 11 . In 2011 the band embarked on the Evanescence Tour , their third worldwide tour , to promote the album with The Pretty Reckless and Fair to Midland .

 After finishing a tour to promote Evanescence 's previous album , The Open Door , Amy Lee said that she " just sort of took off and didn 't know what I was going to do next . " According to Lee , she was unsure at the time when ( or if ) Evanescence would continue . After taking a break from music for 18 months , she decided she wanted to work with the band members and it " became more of a group project " . Lee admitted to an identity crisis : " [ The success with ] Fallen happened really fast , and it was just go , go , go for a couple years , and we went right into writing and wrote the next record . By the time we finished touring with The Open Door , I just needed to go , ' Who am I as an adult ? ' " During her hiatus , Lee began painting , attended concerts and museums and listened to folk and indie music . 
 In a June 2009 post on the Evanescence website , Lee wrote that the band was in the process of writing material for an album planned for release the following year . According to Lee , the music would be an evolution of previous work and " better , stronger , and more interesting " . She described Evanescence 's music as epic , dark , big , beautiful and desperate . In a Spin interview , Lee called the record " fun " – according to her , a " totally new thing " for the band : " When I listen to our old music I see that 's where I was in my life at that time . This has been a long trip and parts have been hard . But it 's about not taking everything so seriously this time . " 
 Writing for the album began in 2009 , when Lee wrote an electronic @-@ driven song different from her usual style . She said , " I remember listening to it over and over , just obsessing over it the way I used to obsess over Evanescence music . That was the spark for me – and the spark to go in the electronic direction and bring some of that into what Evanescence is doing . " Unlike the band 's two previous albums ( primarily written by Lee ) , every band member contributed to the writing process . 
 = = Recording and development = = 
 Evanescence entered the studio on February 22 , 2010 to begin recording the album . Will Hunt returned as drummer ; a second drummer and programmer , Will " Science " Hunt , was brought in to assist with writing but did not join the band . David Campbell , who previously worked with Evanescence on The Open Door , was brought back to handle string arrangements and the album was scheduled for release by producer Steve Lillywhite . Lee later said that Lillywhite " wasn 't the right fit " , adding that the band was experimenting and when they tried to record the songs Lee wrote without the band " it wasn 't working . " According to Lee , the slow , acoustic songs written with Lillywhite did not mesh with Evanescence 's sound . 
 When the band began recording with Lillywhite , the album was intended for an August or September 2010 release . However , on June 21 , 2010 Lee announced on <unk> that Evanescence had suspended recording to continue work on the album and " get our heads into the right creative space " . According to Lee , Wind @-@ up Records was experiencing " uncertain times " which would further delay the album 's release . Label president Ed Vetri supported Lee 's decision : " One thing we do at Wind @-@ up is , we 're patient . I [ f ] it 's not right , it 's not coming out . If it takes a year or four years , [ we 're ] going to take the time it needs to write the right record . " After visiting the studio several times to see the album 's progress , Vetri said that " her core fans will be really happy . " 
 Evanescence re @-@ entered Blackbird Studio in Nashville in early April 2011 with nineteen songs and new producer Nick Raskulinecz , who previously produced for Alice in Chains and Foo Fighters . The album was mixed by Randy Staub . After an initial denial by band management , on June 12 Lee confirmed that guitarist Troy <unk> had rejoined Evanescence . She also announced that the album would be released on October 4 , 2011 ; the date was later pushed back a week by Wind @-@ up Records . According to Lee , when the band returned to the studio , she wanted the album released as soon as possible because of the long time since Evanescence 's last album . The instruments other than pianos were recorded first , followed by the pianos and then by Lee 's vocals ; she said the demanding songs made her " push " herself vocally . Raskulinecz 's production , she said , made Evanescence a rock album . Lee appreciated his work , including the producer 's willingness to answer her questions and determine when the album would be finished : 
 Nick is an awesome producer . He really helped me get the plan and have confidence in the decisions that we made . For me , I have a lot of ideas and sometimes it just comes down to " OK , everything that I 'm doing I have two options ! " He 's awesome , because as I 'm doing these things I 'm asking him from the vocal booth or the piano room or whatever , " Which one of these should I do ? " He 's good at helping me make a quick decision . I really trust his opinion because he makes great records . 
 In December 2015 , Lee posted a cover of " Baby Did a Bad Bad Thing " by Chris Isaak , which she stated was originally intended to appear on the album produced by Lillywhite in 2010 . She also further explained that the original album did not share any of the same tracks that the version produced by Raskulinecz had , as the record company rejected these recordings . Lee said she used her frustration with being forced to start over to write what she called " ( Evanescence 's ) heaviest album . " 
 = = Title and concept = = 
 In a June 2011 Kerrang ! interview , Lee said that the album would be self @-@ titled and was " about the band ; it 's more of a band record . " Lee explained that the concept " to me is about falling back in love with this thing , with Evanescence , with what I 've obsessed over for a decade , longer than that . " There were originally many album @-@ title ideas , but Lee said that as the project became more collaborative " it just felt like this is who we are , it 's a band . And to have that feeling in the music where the band is so pumped up , it was just the only title that felt right . It 's about falling back in love with this thing in a major way . " In an MTV News interview , she said that sixteen songs had been recorded but not all would be included on the album . It was later decided to release two versions of the album : a deluxe edition with all sixteen songs and a standard edition with twelve . 
 <unk> 's cover artwork was introduced on the band 's website on August 30 , 2011 . It is their first album cover which does not feature Lee . In an interview , she discussed the cover : " Well , both of our other records are me on the cover , and I think it 's cool to have that photo , you know , that people can look at and go , ' OK , that 's who that is . ' But I feel like , by now , they know who we are , and I wanted something really different . I didn 't feel like we had to put a photo on the cover , I wanted it to be more mysterious and more about Evanescence itself , not just me . " The cover , black with vapor behind the band 's name , is a play on the meaning of " evanescence " ( " to dissipate like vapor " ) .

 During the Steve Lillywhite sessions , Lee described the album as a " rainbow of sounds " with heavy , stripped @-@ out songs . According to Lee , it had electro influences and a lot of drum programming . During the later sessions with Nick <unk> , she discussed two of the album 's themes : brokenness ( " <unk> has become a little bit of theme , without necessarily offering a solution " ) and oceans . In a later MTV interview , Lee mentioned other themes : " the quest for freedom , and then there 's songs that are just about falling in love " . She said that Evanescence used new and vintage instruments ( such as a harp , synthesizers and the Moog Taurus Pedal ) and recorded the ballads " Secret Door " and " My Heart Is Broken " . In a Kerrang ! interview , Lee said she was inspired by her life and personal relationships . 
 According to Lee , the album was fun but not in a " poppy way " and the band enjoyed its recording . She was inspired by her relationship with Evanescence 's fans : " I can really hear myself singing about my relationship with Evanescence and with the fans . There 's always one big relationship on a record that I sing about the most . I feel like my big relationship on this album [ is ] with Evanescence itself , and with the fans . I think lyrically you 're hearing a lot about a relationship , a struggle with a relationship or love in a relationship , and mostly I 'm singing about that . " 
 For the album , the band was influenced by artists such as Björk , Depeche Mode , Massive Attack , MGMT and Portishead . Lewis Corner of the Digital Spy website noted that rumbling guitars and dainty strings were present on most of the album 's songs : " Amy Lee declares over roaring guitars and classical strings , reinforcing their medieval influences as opposed to the electronic sound they 've been purporting . "

 Lee shares writing credits with other members of the band on 11 of the standard @-@ edition album 's 12 songs . <unk> 's first track and lead single , " What You Want " , was described as one of the band 's most unusual songs with heavy guitar melodies , loud drums and a freedom theme . Opening with drums and a synchronized synthesizer , Lee sings " Do what you , what you want / If you have a dream for better / Do what you , what you want / ' Til you don 't want it anymore " before the song 's rhythmic , guitar @-@ driven beat . Lyrically , the song explores a relationship which is not working out , despite present love . " Made of Stone " , one of the album 's oldest songs , has heavy @-@ metal influences . " The Change " ( originally entitled " Purple " ) , which begins gently and grows more insistent , has been compared to " Digital Bath " by the American alternative metal band Deftones . The fourth track ( and second single ) , " My Heart Is Broken " , is a ballad written for harp and recorded with a piano . It begins with the piano and Lee 's vocals , evolving into rhythmic guitars and strings . In the chorus Lee sings , " I will never find a way to heal my soul / And I will wander ' til the end of time / Torn away from you / My heart is broken " . 
 The fifth track , " The Other Side " , has churning , chunky guitars , a double @-@ bass drum and Lee 's " ethereal , widescreen " vocals with elements of R & B. Lyrically , the song 's theme is death . " Lost in Paradise " is a symphonic rock ballad which begins with piano , strings and Lee 's <unk> vocals before adding the band for the song 's climax ; its lyrics reflect Lee 's past struggles , apologizing to her fans for the band 's five @-@ year absence . The song 's musical structure was compared to " Jóga " , by the Icelandic recording artist Björk . " Sick " has a loose , lazy melody and a chanted chorus ; one of the first songs written for the album , it " set [ s ] a heavy direction for the rest of the record . " " End of the Dream " begins " full bore with chunky guitar , then falls into a brooding grove with piano underpinning Lee 's unmistakable vocals . " In the chorus , Lee sings " Follow your heart ' til it bleeds , " evincing the track 's " seize the day " message . Lee said about the song , " It 's about understanding that this life isn 't forever , and how you have to live it , embrace even the pain , before it 's all over . As much as it hurts , it just means you 're alive . So don 't be so afraid to get hurt that you miss out on living . " " Oceans " begins with a big , low synth and a vocal before the band joins in . According to Lee , " It 's big and lush . We 've been having a lot of fun playing that one especially . " " Never Go Back " ( originally called " Orange " ) examines " loss from the perspective of someone losing someone in a tragedy " . Lee said that the song , with the lyrics " It 's all gone , the only world I 've ever known " , was inspired by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami . " Swimming Home " is an electro @-@ pop song with grinding guitars and a " weeping " piano .

" According to Chad Grischow of IGN , Evanescence is a " great album that delivers the familiar while keeping an eye on the future . " Rob Williams of the Winnipeg Free Press described the album as gothic nu @-@ metal and hard rock , with dramatic orchestration which makes everything sound " big and alive " : " With so many extra bells and whistles , despair has never sounded so epic . " Marc Hirsh of The Boston Globe wrote that the album captures " each party elevating the other far above where their proclivities would get them on their own . " 
 According to Nick Catucci of Rolling Stone , Evanescence is primarily a " syrupy mix of piano , guitar and strings " which is not as " saucy " as the band 's older material . Chris Willman of Reuters wrote , " Every interchangeable tune on the new album also sounds designed to play over the end credits of an action blockbuster that takes itself too seriously " . Theon Weber of Spin gave the album a mixed review ; rather than holding back too much , Weber wrote , Lee did not do enough to restrain her performance : " Evanescence gets lost in the cavernous spaces carved out by their <unk> weapon . " Edna Gundersen of USA Today criticized Raskulinecz 's production and the album 's electronics : " Tempered , her [ Lee 's ] emotional wail enhances the hypnotic medieval magic of signature Evanescence tunes . Some electronics slip into the mix , but the band 's rock essence and penchant for weepy strings remain prominent , as does its flair for conveying wretched despair . " Although PopMatters ' Dane Prokofiev criticized the album 's eponymous title as a new @-@ band strategy , he praised the " noticeable increase in the prominence of choir singing , tinkling piano motifs , and the silky sound of string instruments " with the caveat that the additional deluxe @-@ edition songs were superior to those on the standard edition . Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club called the album " narcissistic " , " corny " and " irredeemably stupid " .

 In October 2006 , news reports surfaced that Washington had insulted co @-@ star T.R. Knight with a homophobic slur during an argument with Patrick Dempsey . Shortly after the details of the argument became public , Knight publicly disclosed that he was gay . The situation seemed somewhat resolved when Washington issued a statement , apologizing for his " unfortunate use of words during the recent incident on @-@ set . " The controversy later resurfaced when the cast appeared at the Golden Globes in January 2007 . While being interviewed on the red carpet prior to the awards , Washington joked , " I love gay . I wanted to be gay . Please let me be gay . " After the show won Best Drama , Washington , in response to press queries as to any conflicts backstage , said , " I never called T.R. a faggot . " However , in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres on The Ellen DeGeneres Show , Knight said that " everybody heard him . " 
 After being rebuked by his studio , Touchstone Television , Washington issued a statement apologizing for repeating the word on the Golden Globes carpet . On January 30 , 2007 , a source told People magazine that Washington was scheduled to return to the Grey 's Anatomy set as early on that Thursday for the first time since entering " executive counseling " after making the comments at the Golden Globes . However , on June 7 , 2007 , ABC announced it had decided not to renew Washington 's contract , and that he would be dropped from the show . " I 'm mad as hell and I 'm not going to take it anymore , " Washington said in a statement released by his publicist , borrowing the famous line from Network . In another report , Washington stated he was planning to " spend the summer pursuing charity work in Sierra Leone , work on an independent film and avoid worrying about the show . " In a subsequent interview , Washington claimed that " they fired the wrong guy " , referring to Knight , and said he was considering filing a lawsuit as a result . He accused Knight of using the controversy to bolster his own career and increase his salary on Grey 's Anatomy . Washington , in late June 2007 , began asserting that racism within the media was a factor in his firing from the series . On July 2 , 2007 , Washington appeared on Larry King Live on CNN , to present his side of the controversy . According to Washington , he never used the " F Word " in reference to Knight , but rather blurted it out in an unrelated context in the course of an argument " provoked " by Dempsey , who , he felt , was treating him like a " B @-@ word , " a " P @-@ word , " and the " F @-@ word , " which Washington said conveyed " somebody who is being weak and afraid to fight back . " Washington himself said that his dismissal from Grey 's Anatomy was an unfortunate misunderstanding that he was eager to move past . He later stated that if he were to be asked to make a cameo appearance on the show , he would not hesitate to say " yes " . Washington 's image was used in advertisements for the May 9 , 2008 episode " The Becoming " . After this aired , Washington 's attorney Peter Nelson contacted ABC and Screen Actors Guild and cited this as an unlawful use of his client 's image . His publicist , Howard <unk> , told The Hollywood Reporter that " they have the rights of the character to advance the story , but not the image " and stated he expected this to result in a " financial settlement " , but it is still uncertain whether this ultimately happened .

 Debbie Chang of <unk> expressed disappointment in the shows ' development throughout the season , by stating it was " all about couples , jumping in and out of relationships , trying their <unk> to have hot sex on the cramped , twin @-@ sized bunk @-@ beds in the on @-@ call room " . Chang also noted the little screen time of characters Mark Sloan and Richard Webber , and the lack of romantic development in their storylines . Many critics negatively reviewed Izzie Stevens 's development in the show 's fourth season , particularly her affair with George . Katherine Heigl herself deemed their relationship " a ratings ploy " . Heigl explained : " They really hurt somebody , and they didn ’ t seem to be taking a lot of responsibility for it . I have a really hard time with that kind of thing . I ’ m maybe a little too black and white about it . I don ’ t really know Izzie very well right now . She ’ s changed a lot . " Laura Burrows of IGN stated the series became " a little more than mediocre , but less than fantastic " in its fourth season . She also said that " this season proved that even strong chemistry and good acting cannot save a show that suffers from the inevitable recycled plot . " However , the episode " Physical Attraction , Chemical Reaction " received a positive review , with Burrows stating that it " fully encompassed all the things that make this show great : intense emotional drama and macabre OR activities " . The Derek / Rose relationship received negative reviews , with Burrows stating that it was " emotional , but not remarkable " . Jack Florey of IndieLondon reviewed the characters , stating that their behaviour is the show 's biggest problem : " the self @-@ absorbed , pretentious and frequently selfish attitudes that drive the surgeons at the centre of Grey ’ s <unk> more than reward . " As for the storylines , Foley stated that they didn 't " ring true " and that " the plot devices became increasingly clunky " , noting the lack of realism in arcs such as George and Callie 's marriage and the Izzie 's affair " as a means of ripping it apart " . <unk> also commented on Meredith Grey 's arc , by stating that she turned into " one of the most selfish , self @-@ centered characters on television " , whereas Mark Sloan 's storyline was named " sex @-@ obsessed , borderline misogynistic and close to scandalous " . Daniel Fienberg of Zap2It said " One of the season 's best performances came from Emmy @-@ nominated guest star Elizabeth Reaser . " Pajiba TV reviewed Reaser 's performance by stating that it " has been one of the only good things that show 's had going for it anymore . " Entertainment Weekly called Reaser 's performance as Ava the sixth most memorable patient performance on the show . About.com stated that Alex Karev developed into " a bold and overly confident surgeon " .

 = Romualdas Marcinkus = 
 Romualdas Marcinkus ( 22 July 1907 – 29 March 1944 ) was a Lithuanian pilot . Marcinkus participated in an early trans @-@ European flight on 25 June 1934 , and was the only Lithuanian pilot to serve in the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) during the Second World War . In his youth Marcinkus was a Lithuanian <unk> football champion and a playing coach for the Lithuania national football team . 
 While serving in the Lithuanian Air Force , Marcinkus was a paratrooper instructor , and headed the aviation sport and physical education department , and during his later years coached a junior football team . A few months before the Soviet occupation of Lithuania early in the Second World War , Marcinkus left Lithuania and enlisted in the French Air Force . After the Battle of France and the French capitulation , Marcinkus escaped to Britain , where he flew for the RAF . As a pilot for No. 1 Squadron RAF , he took part in various missions , including escorting bombers and night combat . On 12 February 1942 , during Operation Cerberus , he was shot down , became a prisoner of war , and was sent to Stalag Luft III . 
 At Stalag Luft III Marcinkus became an active member of an underground group of prisoners who organized and executed the Great Escape . Marcinkus was responsible for analyzing the German railway schedules – a vital part of the plan . On the night of 25 March 1944 , Marcinkus became one of 76 servicemen who escaped the prison camp . After several days he was recaptured by the Gestapo and executed . 
 At the end of the Second World War , Lithuania lost its independence and Marcinkus was largely forgotten . His memory was kept alive by the Lithuanian émigré press . After Lithuania regained its independence in 1990 , more detailed accounts of his life were published there and abroad . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Marcinkus was born on 22 July 1907 in the provincial Lithuanian town of Jurbarkas . At the time Jurbarkas , as well of the rest of Lithuania , was part of the Russian Empire . Romualdas ' father , Pranas Marcinkus , served as a policeman in Jurbarkas , <unk> , and <unk> . His mother , Honorata Kroazė @-@ <unk> , came from an urban family of French origins . Marcinkus ' cousin , Vanda Kroazė @-@ <unk> , stated that the Kroazė family 's origins in Lithuania began with a Frenchman named Courvoisier , who came to Lithuania with Napoleon 's army during the French invasion of Russia in the 19th century and married a local Lithuanian woman . 
 <unk> was the eldest of five children in the family . After his younger brother died during childhood he became the family 's only son . Following the First World War , Lithuania successfully re @-@ established its independence and the first gymnasium in Jurbarkas was established . Soon afterwords , Marcinkus attended the institution , and became passionate about sports , especially football . Romualdas , or Romas as his friends called him , played football for the local team . Marcinkus was known for his stamina and discipline among his peers . 
 = = In Lithuanian army service = = 
 At age 17 , Marcinkus moved from Jurbarkas to Kaunas , the temporary capital of Lithuania . In Kaunas , he attended the Higher German School . After graduating from the German School , he enrolled at the Kaunas Military School , intending to enlist in the Lithuanian army . 
 During this time the Lithuanian army was expanding and modernizing . The Lithuanian Air Force was especially targeted for rapid development and service in this branch was prestigious . Some of its earlier members such as Jurgis <unk> and Antanas Gustaitis were instrumental in improving on aeronautical designs . While at the military school Marcinkus played for the <unk> ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) football club . After his father 's death in 1927 , Marcinkus took on the responsibility of supporting his remaining family , he also began playing football for <unk> Kaunas . 
 The aviator Steponas Darius , with associates , had established the Lietuvos <unk> <unk> <unk> , which soon became one of the leading football clubs in Lithuania . Marcinkus joined the club and won a national championship during his first season . On 27 July 1927 , Marcinkus played for Lithuania in an international match . Although they lost , Marcinkus managed to score his first goal in an international game . The Lithuanian team 's coach predicted a bright future for Marcinkus in football . At that time football was among the most popular sports in Kaunas . 
 In 1928 Marcinkus graduated from the Kaunas Military School and received a commission as an infantry second lieutenant . From 1930 until 1932 he attended the Vytautas the Great Military Institute 's aviation department and became a military pilot . While pursuing his military career , Marcinkus did not abandon his passion for football . He became a Lithuanian football champion three times . His team won the cup for the Baltic states ' championship twice , and he played over forty games for the national team . Eventually , Marcinkus became a coach for the national team . He also wrote several articles about football and ethics in sports . His many successes made him a celebrity in his home county . He is considered one of the best Lithuanian players of that time . 
 In 1933 , Marcinkus advanced to the rank of lieutenant , which was conferred by Lithuanian President , Antanas Smetona . In the same year he married Aleksandra <unk> . <unk> was also a prominent Lithuanian sportswoman ; she won several basketball championships for Lithuania . Around the same time , inspired by <unk> <unk> , Marcinkus became a paratrooper instructor . Soon he became a parachuting master in the air force and participated in various air shows . 
 In 1934 Marcinkus was transferred to the air reconnaissance department , there he started improving his expertise in independent flying , mapping , photography , and weapon systems . 1934 proved to be a challenging year for Marcinkus . Antanas Gustaitis , a prominent Lithuanian aircraft constructor and commander of Lithuanian Military Aviation , invited Marcinkus to participate in a trans @-@ European flight , along with Jonas <unk> , Juozas <unk> , Jonas <unk> , and Kazys <unk> . After detailed planning and preparation , the trans @-@ European flight was begun in the same year . During the 25 days of their flight , the pilots flew three of Gustaitis ' designed aircraft , the <unk> IVs , over 10 @,@ 000 kilometers and visited 12 European capitals . The Lithuanian pilots were warmly welcomed in the countries they visited . They were received by the British Royal Family and the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini . 
 Upon his return , Marcinkus was promoted to the rank of captain and decorated with the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas Knight 's Cross . He was also named head of the aviation physical education department . He went on to establish a junior football team and teach German . His superiors noted that Marcinkus seemed more interested in sports than in his military duties at that time . His sporting career ended in 1938 , however , when he injured a knee and was forced to abandon football . Despite the fact that he was decorated with steel wings ( <unk> <unk> ) , the highest award in Lithuanian military aviation , the following year proved very trying on a personal level . He was burdened with debts and underwent a nervous breakdown . His military career was interrupted by a scandal and he was transferred to the reserves . 
 While the Winter War was gathering momentum , Marcinkus argued for supporting Finland , but Lithuania remained neutral during the conflict . Nevertheless , some Lithuanians left to fight alongside the Finns . In 1940 Marcinkus also left Lithuania , apparently intending to help Finland , although the war had ended by the time he arrived . Soon afterwards he traveled to France , then at war with Germany . 
 = = In French army service = = 
 Marcinkus arrived in France in mid @-@ March 1940 and immediately requested acceptance into the French Air Force . Bureaucratic delays hindered his enlistment . By the time these hurdles were cleared , the Battle for France was rapidly drawing to a close . It is possible , however , that Marcinkus succeeded in shooting down several German military planes during his short career in the French air force . 
 After France surrendered , Marcinkus managed to make his way to the French colonies in Africa ( Morocco and Algeria ) . He decided to go to Great Britain and continue fighting , but the French army 's terms of armistice at Compiègne and tensions between Britain and France made this difficult . On 12 August 1940 he was finally demobilized from the French army . Marcinkus and some of his associates concocted a daring plan to commandeer several aircraft without authorization and fly to England . The plan was not executed due to increased security at airfields and other circumstances . He finally received the necessary documents enabling him to go to Britain in autumn of 1940 . 
 = = In British service = = 
 In October 1940 , Marcinkus reached Liverpool , and from there travelled on to London . On 24 December of the same year , Marcinkus became a pilot in the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) . To achieve that , he changed some of his personal data ; he stated that he was three years younger , otherwise he would have been too old for service in the RAF . At that time , his homeland Lithuania had already lost its independence , and the Lithuanian air force was rapidly liquidated by its occupiers . Throughout the years , <unk> maintained close contacts with the Lithuanian attaché in Britain in order to receive news about Lithuania and his family . 
 On 1 January 1941 , Marcinkus was transferred to a training base . He demonstrated his flying skills , hoping to fly the British Hurricane fighter aircraft . He was successful and was transferred to No. 1 Squadron RAF . Marcinkus became the only Lithuanian pilot to fly for the RAF during the Second World War . Marcinkus wrote in his letter about the new challenges lying ahead : 
 I was transferred to the night fighters – at that time the most dangerous kind of military aviation . But I like danger – I faced danger during my entire life , in flying , sports , and personal life . With this I am satisfied , but ... I am lacking warmth and the comfort of my personal life in this country of " cold slob weather and so called correctness " . 
 In one of the Marcinkus 's letters to the Lithuanian envoy , Bronius <unk> , he notes that he shot down his first German bomber , a Dornier Do 17 in March . Marcinkus also wrote that he was gathering skills and knowledge in order to make a contribution towards liberating Lithuania and restoring its independence . 
 In the RAF , Marcinkus carried out multiple tasks , including various training missions , night combat and bomber escort . In June , Marcinkus and his squadron members engaged in prolonged air combat with the Luftwaffe . As later reports confirm , the Germans lost four Me 109 fighter aircraft , one of which was shot down by Marcinkus . The original report submitted by Marcinkus claiming one Me 109 shot down on 21 June 1941 is held in The National Archives ; he states that he fired two short bursts from his guns from 100 yards behind the German . Sergeant <unk> , also of 1 Squadron , witnessed the plane break up in the air . On the allied side , one American pilot was missing . The last mission Marcinkus carried out as a RAF pilot was on 12 February 1942 . 
 On 11 February 1942 , a German operation codenamed " Cerberus " had commenced , in which a German Kriegsmarine squadron consisting of Scharnhorst , Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen , supported by a number of smaller ships , attempted to sail to their home bases via the English Channel . Six fighters from No. 1 Squadron were tasked with intercepting German ships and attacking German torpedo boats . Marcinkus was among the pilots . On 12 February , while attacking the Scharnhorst , his plane was shot down by anti @-@ aircraft fire and crashed into the sea . Romualdas Marcinkus suffered a spinal fracture and was rescued by Germans , subsequently becoming a prisoner of war . During the course of the battle , the British lost approximately forty planes and failed to prevent the German fleet from returning to Kiel and Wilhelmshaven . 
 = = The Great Escape = = 
 Marcinkus was sent to Stalag Luft III , a prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camp near Sagan that housed captured air force servicemen during the Second World War . The camp was restructured several times in order to accommodate more POWs . It would eventually hold over 10 @,@ 000 inmates . Marcinkus was the only known Lithuanian at the camp . 
 Squadron Leader Roger Bushell selected inmates and began planning an escape , at first focused on digging a tunnel . Already experienced from earlier escapes , Bushell became the nominal leader of this endeavour . The group expanded and accepted Marcinkus into their ranks — his fluent command of several languages , most importantly German , was seen as valuable . 
 The prisoners delegated various tasks amongst themselves in order to better implement their escape . Marcinkus began working on creating forged documents that would aid the escapees once they were out of the confines of the Stalag . He also contributed his intelligence to analyses of the Baltic and Low Countries . His extensive knowledge of Germany 's military and transport positions led to his nickname as " Know @-@ it @-@ All . " He analyzed German news reports , but his most important contribution was his compilation of the German railway schedules , an essential part of the escape plan . Bertram James remembered Marcinkus ' contribution to the escape operation : 
 While I didn 't know Marcinkus directly , but I remember him very well . I remember him as friendly guy , having a good character , he also had a phenomenal memory . He was especially good at memorizing numbers , dates , and after analyzing a pile of information , he made a precise compilation of the Reich 's railway schedules . These schedules were used by men , who during the Great Escape traveled by train , including me ... He was fluent in German , perhaps this allowed him to bribe or negotiate with German officials in order to get needed information , but I know for sure , that Marcinkus ' analyzed vast amounts of information and became very useful during the Great Escape . 
 During March 1944 , final preparations for the escape gathered momentum . In its original form about 200 prisoners were to escape . As cover stories , they were to pose as foreign workers from a number of countries . According to the plan , Marcinkus needed to be among the first escapees . He was selected to lead a group of four prisoners posing as Lithuanian workers traveling back to Lithuania . The group 's prospects hinged on the hope that the Germans encountered on the way would not speak or understand Lithuanian , as Marcinkus was the only member fluent in that language . 
 On the night of 25 March , the prisoners enacted their plan . Serious problems arose immediately . The tunnel hatch proved difficult to open and the tunnel exit was several metres short of the relatively safe forested area . These problems led to delays and only 76 POWs managed to make their break for freedom . As originally intended , Marcinkus was one of the first ten to escape . 
 Marcinkus and the three prisoners in his group posing as Lithuanians – Tim <unk> , Henri Picard and Gordon <unk> – managed to reach a train heading towards Danzig ( now Gdansk , Poland ) . Most likely , they intended to travel to East Prussia , cross the Lithuanian border , and somehow cross the Baltic Sea to neutral Sweden . However , officials at the Stalag had discovered the escape and began manhunts . Marcinkus and his group travelled further than most of the escapees , but were captured by the Gestapo near Schneidemühl on 26 March . Marcinkus and his associates were brought to Stalag <unk> and spent the night there . On the following day they were handed over to the Danzig Gestapo . 
 = = Death = = 
 Officers of the Danzig Gestapo took Marcinkus to a forest near <unk> and executed him . On 29 March his body was cremated in Danzig 's Gestapo crematorium . 
 The executions of the fifty recaptured servicemen were sanctioned by Adolf Hitler . Only three escapees managed to reach their final destinations . The Gestapo claimed that the recaptured servicemen were shot after resisting arrest and while attempting to escape again . By the time of his death Marcinkus held the rank of flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve . 
 = = Commemoration = = 
 Details of the Great Escape executions reached the British Government . Its Foreign Secretary , Anthony Eden , then delivered this speech to the House of Commons : 
 His Majesty 's Government must , therefore , record their solemn protest against these cold @-@ blooded acts of butchery . They will never cease in their efforts to collect the evidence to identify all those responsible . They are firmly resolved that these foul criminals shall be tracked down to the last man wherever they may take refuge . When the war is over they will be brought to exemplary justice . 
 The remaining inmates at Stalag Luft III erected a memorial to their fifty executed comrades at the end of 1944 . Following the war , the Allies launched an investigation into the escaped prisoners ' executions and named seventy @-@ two individuals as responsible . Marcinkus ' killer was convicted in 1948 . In the same year Marcinkus ' burial place was identified and an urn containing his ashes was transferred to the British section of the Old Garrison Cemetery in Poznań , his grave is marked by a Commonwealth War Graves Commission headstone . 
 Marcinkus was posthumously mentioned in despatches in the 1944 King 's Birthday Honours , he also received the 1939 – 45 Star , the Air Crew Europe Star , and the War Medal 1939 – 1945 . British authorities attempted to contact his relatives in Lithuania , but Lithuania — as a Soviet Socialist Republic — was behind the Iron Curtain , and they were advised to stop these attempts since his relatives might suffer negative consequences . At the time Soviet authorities saw those people who maintained contacts with the West as untrustworthy . 
 Marcinkus was seldom mentioned during the Cold War and his pre @-@ war biography was only reprinted in the Lithuanian émigré press , particularly in the US During the 1950s articles about Marcinkus began to appear in these newspapers , including <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ( 1950 ) , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( 1955 ) , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( 1956 ) . The first significant publication discussing Marcinkus in Soviet Lithuania appeared in a 1967 issue of the journal <unk> . <unk> Marcinkus 's life was more frequently mentioned , although much of the information presented was inaccurate and incomplete . 
 After Lithuania successfully re @-@ established its independence , interest in his story gained momentum in Lithuania and elsewhere . In Jurbarkas , a street was named after him . The Lithuanian Air Force now sponsors the Marcinkus Pistol Marksmanship Cup . In 2001 the British Ambassador in Vilnius gave Marcinkus ' previously unclaimed war medals to a surviving relative , his nephew , Alvydas <unk> , during a commemorative ceremony . The RAF provided a fly @-@ past of Harrier jets from Marcinkus ' No. 1 Squadron RAF , in which one aircraft saluted the ceremony . In the same year a plaque was dedicated to honour the famous Lithuanian pilot in Kaunas . <unk> <unk> , a CNN award @-@ winning journalist , wrote a detailed account of Marcinkus ' life in her book <unk> <unk> ( " Hurricane Captain " ) , which was published in 2004 . A documentary film with the same title was produced in 2004 . Marcinkus ' life story was reprinted in various foreign publications in the USA , Canada , and Japan . 
 = Mount Hood = 
 Mount Hood , called Wy 'east by the Multnomah tribe , is a potentially active stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc of northern Oregon . It was formed by a subduction zone on the Pacific coast and rests in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States . It is located about 50 miles ( 80 km ) east @-@ southeast of Portland , on the border between Clackamas and Hood River counties . In addition to being Oregon 's highest mountain , it is one of the loftiest mountains in the nation based on its prominence . 
 The height assigned to Mount Hood 's snow @-@ covered peak has varied over its history . Modern sources point to three different heights : 11 @,@ 249 feet ( 3 @,@ 429 m ) , a 1991 adjustment of a 1986 measurement by the U.S. National Geodetic Survey ( NGS ) , 11 @,@ 240 feet ( 3 @,@ 426 m ) based on a 1993 scientific expedition , and 11 @,@ 239 feet ( 3 @,@ 426 m ) of slightly older origin . The peak is home to 12 named glaciers and snowfields . It is the highest point in Oregon and the fourth highest in the Cascade Range . Mount Hood is considered the Oregon volcano most likely to erupt , though based on its history , an explosive eruption is unlikely . Still , the odds of an eruption in the next 30 years are estimated at between 3 and 7 percent , so the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) characterizes it as " potentially active " , but the mountain is informally considered dormant . 
 = = Establishments = = 
 Timberline Lodge is a National Historic Landmark located on the southern flank of Mount Hood just below Palmer Glacier , with an elevation of about 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) . 
 The mountain has six ski areas : Timberline , Mount Hood Meadows , Ski Bowl , Cooper Spur , Snow Bunny , and Summit . They total over 4 @,@ 600 acres ( 7 @.@ 2 sq mi ; 19 km2 ) of skiable terrain ; Timberline offers the only year @-@ round lift @-@ served skiing in North America . 
 Mount Hood is within the Mount Hood National Forest , which comprises 1 @,@ 067 @,@ 043 acres ( 1 @,@ 667 sq mi ; 4 @,@ 318 km2 ) of land — including four designated wilderness areas that total 314 @,@ 078 acres ( 491 sq mi ; 1 @,@ 271 km2 ) — and more than 1 @,@ 200 miles ( 1 @,@ 900 km ) of hiking trails . 
 The most northwestern pass around the mountain is called Lolo Pass . Native Americans crossed the pass while traveling between the Willamette Valley and Celilo Falls . 
 = = Name = = 
 The Multnomah name for Mount Hood was Wy 'east . In one version of the legend , the two sons of the Great Spirit <unk> fell in love with the beautiful maiden Loowit , who could not decide which to choose . The two braves , Wy 'east and Klickitat , burned forests and villages in their battle over her . <unk> became enraged and smote the three lovers . Seeing what he had done , he erected three mountain peaks to mark where each fell . He made beautiful Mount St. Helens for Loowit , proud and erect Mount Hood for Wy 'east , and the somber Mount Adams for the mourning Klickitat . 
 There are other versions of the legend . In another telling , Wy 'east ( Hood ) battles Pahto ( Adams ) for the fair La @-@ wa @-@ la @-@ clough ( St. Helens ) . Or again Wy 'east , the chief of the Multnomah tribe , competed with the chief of the Klickitat tribe . Their great anger led to their transformation into volcanoes . Their battle is said to have destroyed the Bridge of the Gods and thus created the great Cascades Rapids of the Columbia River . 
 The mountain was given its present name on October 29 , 1792 , by Lt. William Broughton , a member of Captain George Vancouver 's discovery expedition . Lt. Broughton observed its peak while at Belle Vue Point of what is now called Sauvie Island during his travels up the Columbia River , writing , " A very high , snowy mountain now appeared rising beautifully conspicuous in the midst of an extensive tract of low or moderately elevated land [ location of today 's Vancouver , Washington ] lying S 67 E. , and seemed to announce a termination to the river . " Lt. Broughton named the mountain after Lord ( Samuel ) Hood , a British Admiral at the Battle of the Chesapeake . 
 Lewis and Clark spotted the mountain on October 18 , 1805 . A few days later at what would become The Dalles , Clark wrote , " The pinnacle of the round topped mountain , which we saw a short distance below the banks of the river , is South 43 @-@ degrees West of us and about 37 miles ( 60 km ) . It is at this time topped with snow . We called this the Falls Mountain , or Timm Mountain . " Timm was the native name for Celilo Falls . Clark later noted that it was also Vancouver 's Mount Hood . 
 Two French explorers from the Hudson 's Bay Company may have traveled into the Dog River area east of Mount Hood in 1818 . They reported climbing to a glacier on " Montagne de Neige " ( Mountain of Snow ) , probably Eliot Glacier . 
 = = = Ships = = = 
 There have been two United States Navy ammunition ships named for Mount Hood , despite the mountain 's namesake having been an enemy commander . USS Mount Hood ( AE @-@ 11 ) was commissioned in July 1944 and was destroyed in November 1944 while at anchor in Manus Naval Base , Admiralty Islands . Her explosive cargo ignited , resulting in 45 confirmed dead , 327 missing and 371 injured . A second ammunition ship , AE @-@ 29 , was commissioned in May 1971 and decommissioned in August 1999 . 
 = = Volcanic activity = = 
 The glacially eroded summit area consists of several andesitic or dacitic lava domes ; Pleistocene collapses produced avalanches and lahars ( rapidly moving mudflows ) that traveled across the Columbia River to the north . The eroded volcano has had at least four major eruptive periods during the past 15 @,@ 000 years . 
 The last three eruptions at Mount Hood occurred within the past 1 @,@ 800 years from vents high on the southwest flank and produced deposits that were distributed primarily to the south and west along the Sandy and Zigzag rivers . The last eruptive period took place around 220 to 170 years ago , when dacitic lava domes , pyroclastic flows and mudflows were produced without major explosive eruptions . The prominent Crater Rock just below the summit is hypothesized to be the remains of one of these now @-@ eroded domes . This period includes the last major eruption of 1781 to 1782 with a slightly more recent episode ending shortly before the arrival of Lewis and Clark in 1805 . The latest minor eruptive event occurred in August 1907 . 
 The glaciers on the mountain 's upper slopes may be a source of potentially dangerous lahars when the mountain next erupts . There are vents near the summit that are known for emitting gases such as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide . Prior to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens , the only known fatality related to volcanic activity in the Cascades occurred in 1934 , when a climber suffocated in oxygen @-@ poor air while exploring ice caves melted by fumaroles in Coalman Glacier . 
 Since 1950 , there have been several earthquake swarms each year at Mount Hood , most notably in July 1980 and June 2002 . Seismic activity is monitored by the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver , Washington , which issues weekly updates ( and daily updates if significant eruptive activity is occurring at a Cascades volcano ) . 
 The most recent evidence of volcanic activity at Mount Hood consists of fumaroles near Crater Rock and hot springs on the flanks of the volcano . 
 = = Elevation = = 
 Mount Hood was first seen by European explorers in 1792 and is believed to have maintained a consistent summit elevation , varying by no more than a few feet due to mild seismic activity . Elevation changes since the 1950s are predominantly due to improved survey methods and model refinements of the shape of the Earth ( see vertical reference datum ) . Despite the physical consistency , the estimated elevation of Mount Hood has varied substantially over the years . 
 Early explorers on the Columbia River estimated the elevation to be 10 @,@ 000 to 12 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 000 to 3 @,@ 700 m ) . Two people in Thomas J. Dryer 's 1854 expedition calculated the elevation to be 18 @,@ 361 feet ( 5 @,@ 596 m ) and that the tree line was at about 11 @,@ 250 feet ( 3 @,@ 430 m ) . Two months later , a Mr. Belden claimed to have climbed the mountain during a hunting trip and determined it to be 19 @,@ 400 feet ( 5 @,@ 900 m ) upon which " pores oozed blood , eyes bled , and blood rushed from their ears . " Sometime by 1866 , Reverend G. H. Atkinson determined it to be 17 @,@ 600 feet ( 5 @,@ 400 m ) . A Portland engineer used surveying methods from a Portland baseline and calculated a height of between 18 @,@ 000 and 19 @,@ 000 feet ( 5 @,@ 500 and 5 @,@ 800 m ) . Many maps distributed in the late 19th century cited 18 @,@ 361 feet ( 5 @,@ 596 m ) , though Mitchell 's School Atlas gave 14 @,@ 000 feet ( 4 @,@ 300 m ) as the correct value . For some time , many references assumed Mount Hood to be the highest point in North America . 
 Modern height surveys also vary , but not by the huge margins seen in the past . A 1993 survey by a scientific party that arrived at the peak 's summit with 16 pounds ( 7 @.@ 3 kg ) of electronic equipment reported a height of 11 @,@ 240 feet ( 3 @,@ 426 m ) , claimed to be accurate to within 1 @.@ 25 inches ( 32 mm ) . Many modern sources likewise list 11 @,@ 240 feet ( 3 @,@ 426 m ) as the height . However , numerous others place the peak 's height one foot lower , at 11 @,@ 239 feet ( 3 @,@ 426 m ) . Finally , a height of 11 @,@ 249 feet ( 3 @,@ 429 m ) has also been reported . 
 Mount Hood 's tree line is generally around 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) . 
 = = Glaciers = = 
 Mount Hood is host to 12 named glaciers or snow fields , the most visited of which is Palmer Glacier , partially within the Timberline Lodge ski area and on the most popular climbing route . The glaciers are almost exclusively above the 6 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) level , which also is about the average tree line elevation on Mount Hood . More than 80 percent of the glacial surface area is above 7 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 100 m ) . 
 The glaciers and permanent snow fields have an area of 3 @,@ 331 acres ( 1 @,@ 348 ha ) and contain a volume of about 282 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 0 @.@ 348 km3 ) . Eliot Glacier is the largest glacier by volume at 73 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 0 @.@ 09 km3 ) , and has the thickest depth measured by ice radar at 361 feet ( 110 m ) . The largest glacier by surface area is the Coe @-@ Ladd Glacier system at 531 acres ( 215 ha ) . 
 Glaciers and snowfields cover about 80 percent of the mountain above the 6 @,@ 900 @-@ foot ( 2 @,@ 100 m ) level . The glaciers declined by an average of 34 percent from 1907 – 2004 . Glaciers on Mount Hood retreated through the first half of the 20th century , advanced or at least slowed their retreat in the 1960s and 1970s , and have since returned to a pattern of retreat . The neo @-@ glacial maximum extents formed in the early 18th century . 
 During the last major glacial event between 29 @,@ 000 and 10 @,@ 000 years ago , glaciers reached down to the 2 @,@ 600 @-@ to @-@ 2 @,@ 300 @-@ foot ( 790 to 700 m ) level , a distance of 9 @.@ 3 miles ( 15 @.@ 0 km ) from the summit . The retreat released considerable outwash , some of which filled and flattened the upper Hood River Valley near Parkdale and formed Dee Flat . 
 Older glaciation produced moraines near Brightwood and distinctive cuts on the southeast side ; they may date to 140 @,@ 000 years ago . 
 = = Climbing = = 
 Mount Hood is Oregon 's highest point and a prominent landmark visible up to 100 miles ( 160 km ) away . It has convenient access and a minimum of technical climbing challenges . About 10 @,@ 000 people attempt to climb Mount Hood each year . There are no trails to the summit . Even the " easier " southside climbing route is a technical climb with crevasses , falling rocks , and often inclement weather . Ropes , ice axes , crampons and other technical mountaineering gear are necessary . Peak climbing season is generally from April to mid @-@ June . 
 There are six main routes to approach the mountain with about 30 total variations for summiting . The climbs range in difficulty from class 2 to class 5 @.@ 9 + ( for Arachnophobia ) . The most popular route , dubbed the south route , begins at Timberline Lodge and proceeds up Palmer Glacier to Crater Rock , the large prominence at the head of the glacier . The route goes east around Crater Rock and crosses Coalman Glacier on the Hogsback , a ridge spanning from Crater Rock to the approach to the summit . The Hogsback terminates at a <unk> where Coalman Glacier separates from the summit rock headwall , and then to Pearly Gates , a gap in the summit rock formation , then right onto the summit plateau and the summit proper . 
 Technical ice axes , fall protection , and experience are now recommended in order to attempt the left chute variation or Pearly Gates ice chute . The Forest Service is recommending several other route options due to these changes in conditions ( e.g. " Old Chute " , West Crater Rim , etc . ) . 
 = = = Climbing accidents = = = 
 As of May 2002 , more than 130 people had died in climbing @-@ related accidents since records have been kept on Mount Hood , the first in 1896 . Incidents in May 1986 , December 2006 , and December 2009 attracted intense national and international media interest . Though avalanches are a common hazard on other glaciated mountains , most Mount Hood climbing deaths are the result of falls and hypothermia . Despite a quadrupling of forest visitors since 1990 , fewer than 50 people require rescue per year . Only 3 @.@ 4 percent of search and rescue missions in 2006 were for mountain climbers .

A portion of the Pacific Crest Trail is coincident with the Timberline Trail on the west side of Mount Hood . 
 The predecessor of the Pacific Crest Trail was the Oregon Skyline Trail , established in 1920 , which connected Mount Hood to Crater Lake .

 = = Plot = = 
 Cartman , Stan , Kyle , Kenny , Butters and Jimmy arrive at Pi Pi 's Splashtown waterpark . Cartman is distraught to discover that most of the park 's attendants are people of different races , while Kyle is disgusted to learn so many people freely urinate in the pools . Based on his observance of more minorities at the park than white people , Cartman calculates there will be no white people left by the year 2012 , and interprets this as a sign that Mayans accurately predicted the world would end the same year , and that the new world will be " made up of minorities . " Annoyed by Cartman 's racism , Kyle points out that since white people do not make up the majority of the park 's attendance , then they are the new minority , but Cartman refuses to believe it , <unk> thinking that a minority is someone who is " black or brown . " At the same time , a scientist tests the park 's water and discovers it is 98 percent urine . He urges Pi Pi , the park 's Venetian owner , to immediately close and evacuate his park , claiming the high urine content will soon trigger a cataclysmic event . Pi Pi dismisses the warning , but the park is soon overcome by tsunamis of urine and volcanic eruptions . Hundreds drown in the subsequent flood , including Kenny , but the other boys manage to survive . 
 The park is quarantined , and the scientist advises against a mission to rescue those trapped inside , fearing their exposure to " pee contamination " has turned them into dangerous , hate @-@ filled mutants . To prove his theory , the scientist urinates onto a test monkey , which clearly becomes annoyed and enraged . An antidote to this reaction is then tested on other monkeys , but proven unsuccessful when the monkeys still become angered when urinated on . Meanwhile , Cartman clings to debris to stay afloat , while the other boys have reached higher ground . Cartman is rescued by the occupants of an inflatable raft . Noticing he is the only white person in the raft , Cartman assumes he is the " last of his species , " and that his envisioned 2012 scenario has occurred three years early . He imagines a world in which he must speak in minority slang , is paid lower wages , and eventually forced to live in a concentration camp . 
 The other boys find Pi Pi , who informs them the park can be drained of the inundation if someone can swim through the pee to reach an emergency release valve . Kyle reluctantly agrees to do the job as he said at the start of the episode that he could hold his breath for the longest , but is horrified to learn he must drink some of the pee in order to offset the fluid pressure he will encounter at the depths . Outside , an antidote that keeps the monkeys calm during yet another urination test is discovered : bananas . Back inside the park , Kyle reluctantly drinks a <unk> of pee in preparation for his plunge into the flood . Just after he finishes the jar , helicopters arrive as part of the rescue mission . Just as Kyle complains that eating a banana would be the only ordeal more disgusting than what he has just been through , he is ordered at gunpoint to consume the antidote , much to his anger .

 " Pee " , the South Park thirteenth season finale , was written and directed by series co @-@ founder Trey Parker , and was rated TV @-@ MA L in the United States . Since the episode takes place in a waterpark , all animation had to be drawn from scratch . The episode was conceived a mere week before its initial broadcast , and the animation was almost completely unfinished two days before airing . Parker and Matt Stone had the idea of a waterpark @-@ themed episode for a long time and reminisced about Water World in Denver , Colorado during the episode 's production . Initially , the name of the park in the episode was Pi Pi 's Urine World . " Pee " first aired on November 18 , 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central . The episode marked the third time during the thirteenth season that Kenny was killed , a running gag throughout the series . He also died during the season premiere , " The Ring " and during " W.T.F. " During one of the final scenes , an alien holding a banana is visible among the crowd in the background . The alien was placed in the episode as part of a contest offered by the show 's official website , in which viewers who could find and identify the alien in the episode could enter a contest , with the winner getting an animated version of himself or herself placed in the South Park opening credits . 
 The episode featured a musical number sung by Cartman called " Not My Water Park " , in which he despairs over the number of minorities at the waterpark . He also reminisces about the park before the ride instructions were also read in Spanish . The day after " Pee " was originally broadcast , three different kinds of T @-@ shirts and hooded sweatshirts based on the episode were made available on South Park Studios , the official website of South Park . One featured Butters standing next to a puddle of urine saying , " 1 in 3 People Admit They Pee in Pools " . The second included Cartman and his quote from the episode , " Your world is cold and void of any humanity " . The third featured Stan , Cartman , Kyle and Kenny wearing bathing suits and standing in front of a Pi Pi 's Splashtown logo . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The episode is a parody on the disaster film genre , which has been parodied in previous South Park episodes , like " Pandemic " , the twelfth season parody of the film Cloverfield . " Pee " included a particularly large number of references to 2012 , a science fiction film about the end of the world as predicted by the Mayan calendar , which was released only days before " Pee " was originally broadcast . The episode parodies many common elements of such disaster films , including scientists struggling to figure out the source of the problem . The destruction of rides and park amenities by the tsunami of urine is a reference to the destruction of historical monuments in 2012 , and other such disaster films by Roland Emmerich , the director of 2012 , Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow . " Pee " also includes several references to the 2012 phenomenon , the prediction that cataclysmic events would occur in the year 2012 , which is said to be the end of the Mayan Long Count calendar . The scene in which Kyle is forced to drink three cups of urine in order to prevent his body from enduring the effects of fluid pressure before swimming down to drain it all out , is a parody of a scene in the 1989 film The Abyss , where the protagonist inhales a liquid breathing medium before venturing into the ocean depths . There is also a reference to the film Alive ( 1993 ) when Randy comes to rescue the children on a helicopter . He is holding a baby red shoe , just as Nando <unk> at the end of the movie .

If Magazine writer Carl Cortez , who was critical of the second half of season thirteen , said " Pee " ranked as one of the best episodes of the season , and said it included several " classic South Park moments " . Cortez called it a " wonderfully twisted spoof " of disaster films and called the script " pretty biting stuff ... without being wholly offensive " . Ramsey Isler of IGN said the emergency staff subplot working on a cure was not " quite perfect parody " . But he praised Kyle in the ending scene , as well as the way South Park found a new , literal twist on " toilet humor " by featuring rivers and tsunamis of pee . Sean O 'Neal of The A.V. Club said that the episode was overly offensive , rather than an ironic commentary on racism . Although O 'Neal said previous South Park episodes like " With Apologies to Jesse Jackson " were effective , " Pee " and its references to minority park attendees and the Italian waterpark owner " came off less like ironic racism and more as good , old @-@ fashioned , butter @-@ your @-@ <unk> @-@ with @-@ it racism " .

 New York State Route 350 ( NY 350 ) is a north – south state highway in western Wayne County , New York , in the United States . It extends for 11 @.@ 40 miles ( 18 @.@ 35 km ) from an intersection with NY 31 and NY 31F in the village of Macedon to a junction with NY 104 in the town of Ontario . NY 350 serves as the eastern terminus for three routes : the aforementioned NY 31F , NY 286 , and NY 441 , all of which originate in the Rochester area . Aside from the village of Macedon at its south end and the hamlet of Ontario Center at its north terminus , NY 350 serves mostly rural areas dominated by farmland . NY 350 was assigned c . 1932 to the portion of its routing south of Cator Corners , the north junction with NY 31F . It was extended northward to its current terminus in the 1940s . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 350 begins at an intersection with NY 31 in the village of Macedon near the former Mobil Chemical and Tyco plant . The junction also serves as the eastern terminus of NY 31F , which overlaps NY 350 north from the intersection on Ontario Center Road . The conjoined routes cross over the Erie Canal and an industrial railroad spur off of the CSX Transportation @-@ owned Rochester Subdivision before exiting the village and entering the surrounding town of Macedon . NY 31F and NY 350 pass through forested areas up to an overpass carrying the Rochester Subdivision line over the road , at which point the wooded areas give way to open fields . The two routes split roughly 1 @.@ 75 miles ( 2 @.@ 82 km ) north of Macedon at a junction named Cator Corners . While NY 31F heads west through Macedon Center toward Monroe County , NY 350 continues east as Ontario Center Road . 
 As NY 350 departs Cator Corners , it curves back to the north , leaving Macedon Center Road — the east – west roadway that NY 31F follows from Cator Corners west to the county line — to continue east as a county road . NY 350 continues across rolling farmland to the town of Walworth , where it meets the eastern terminus of NY 441 at a four @-@ way intersection with Walworth – Penfield Road west of the hamlet of Walworth . The route continues on , entering a slightly more forested area as it heads toward a junction with NY 286 at Atlantic Avenue . Like NY 31F and NY 441 before it , NY 286 serves as an east – west connector between NY 350 and the eastern suburbs of the city of Rochester 15 miles ( 24 km ) to the west . 
 Past NY 286 , the wooded areas become more sporadic as NY 350 turns to travel in a more northwesterly direction across farmlands and fields . It soon enters the town of Ontario , where development along the road increases as it heads into the hamlet of Ontario Center . Here , it passes Wayne High School of the Wayne Central School District prior to intersecting Ridge Road in the center of the community . This junction once served as Ontario Center 's main business district ; however , it has been replaced in purpose by the adjacent four @-@ lane NY 104 , located just 200 yards ( 183 m ) north of Ridge Road . NY 350 ends upon intersecting the NY 104 divided highway ; however , Ontario Center Road continues north of the east – west commercial strip for 3 miles ( 5 km ) to Lake Road near the Lake Ontario shoreline . 
 = = History = = 
 The portion of modern NY 350 that overlaps with NY 31F was originally designated as part of Route 20 , an unsigned legislative route , by the New York State Legislature in 1908 . Route 20 continued east from here on what is now NY 31 and west on current NY 31F . On March 1 , 1921 , Route 20 was altered to follow modern NY 31 and NY 250 between Macedon and Fairport , bypassing current NY 350 entirely . Even though it was no longer part of a legislative route , the Macedon – Cator Corners highway was taken over by the state of New York by 1926 . At the time , it was the only portion of what is now NY 350 that was state @-@ maintained . 
 In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , the segment of current NY 350 between Atlantic Avenue and Ridge Road became part of an extended NY 35 , which had ended at a junction west of the village of Avon in Livingston County prior to 1930 . The extension took NY 35 northeastward through Monroe and Wayne Counties to a new terminus in the town of Ontario . NY 35 entered Wayne County on modern NY 286 ( Atlantic Avenue ) and followed Atlantic Avenue and Ontario Center Road north to NY 3 ( Ridge Road ; later U.S. Route 104 or US 104 ) . By the following year , the portion of Ontario Center Road from Cator Corners to NY 33 ( Walworth – Penfield Road ; now NY 441 ) was designated as part of NY 33B . The Macedon – Cator Corners segment of former legislative Route 20 was designated as NY 350 c . 1932 . 
 NY 35 was split up into two routes in the early 1940s . The portion of old NY 35 west of Ontario Center Road became NY 383 while the Ontario Center Road section became part of an extended NY 350 . The extension created an overlap between NY 350 and NY 33B from Cator Corners to NY 33 . NY 33 was truncated on its east end to downtown Rochester on January 1 , 1949 . As a result , NY 33B was redesignated as NY 31F . The easternmost leg of the route still overlapped NY 350 ; however , it now followed NY 350 south to NY 31 in Macedon . NY 350 was extended a short distance northward in the mid @-@ 1940s to meet the new super two highway carrying US 104 between Union Hill and Sodus .

 = Honest services fraud = 
 Honest services fraud is a crime defined in a 28 @-@ word sentence of 18 U.S.C. § 1346 ( the federal mail and wire fraud statute ) , added by the United States Congress in 1988 , which states : " For the purposes of this chapter , the term scheme or artifice to defraud includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services . " 
 The statute has been applied by federal prosecutors in cases of public corruption as well as in cases in which private individuals breached a fiduciary duty to another . In the former , the courts have been divided on the question of whether a state law violation is necessary for honest services fraud to have occurred . In the latter , the courts have taken differing approaches to determining whether a private individual has committed honest services fraud — a test based on reasonably foreseeable economic harm and a test based on materiality . The statute , which has been a target of criticism , was given a narrow construction by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Skilling v. United States ( 2010 ) . In order to avoid finding the statute to be unconstitutionally vague , the Court interpreted the statute to only cover " fraudulent schemes to deprive another of honest services through bribes or kickbacks supplied by a third party who ha [ s ] not been deceived " . 
 = = History and case law = = 
 Since at least 1941 , particularly in the 1970s and 1980s , and prior to 1987 , the courts had interpreted the mail fraud and wire fraud statutes as criminalizing not only schemes to defraud victims of money and property , but also schemes to defraud victims of intangible rights such as the " honest services " of a public official . In 1987 , the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in McNally v. United States that the mail fraud and wire fraud statutes pertained strictly to schemes to defraud victims of tangible property , including money . In 1988 , Congress enacted a new law that specifically criminalized schemes to defraud victims of " the intangible right of honest services . " 
 = = = Meaning of " honest services " in public corruption = = = 
 Honest services fraud is generally more easily proven in the public sphere than in the private , because honest services fraud by public officials can include most unethical conduct , whereas honest services fraud by private individuals only includes some unethical conduct . Federal courts have generally recognized two main areas of public @-@ sector honest service fraud : bribery ( direct or indirect ) , where a public official was paid in some way for a particular decision or action , and failure to disclose a conflict of interest , resulting in personal gain .

 In 1997 , the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit decided in United States v. Brumley that in order for a state official to have committed honest services fraud , he or she must have violated the state statute defining the services which were owed to the employer ( the state ) . 
 We find nothing to suggest that Congress was attempting in § 1346 to garner to the federal government the right to impose upon states a federal vision of appropriate services — to establish , in other words , an ethical regime for state employees . Such a taking of power would sorely tax separation of powers and erode our federalist structure . Under the most natural reading of the statute , a federal prosecutor must prove that conduct of a state official breached a duty respecting the provision of services owed to the official 's employer under state law . Stated directly , the official must act or fail to act contrary to the requirements of his job under state law . This means that if the official does all that is required under state law , alleging that the services were not otherwise done " honestly " does not charge a violation of the mail fraud statute . 
 However , the First , Fourth , Ninth , and Eleventh Circuit Courts have all held that the federal statute does not limit the meaning of " honest services " to violations of state law . As the Ninth Circuit decided in United States v. Weyhrauch in 2008 : 
 Because laws governing official conduct differ from state to state , conditioning mail fraud convictions on state law means that conduct in one state might violate the mail fraud statute , whereas identical conduct in a neighboring state would not . Congress has given no indication it intended the criminality of official conduct under federal law to depend on geography . 
 The defendant in that case , Bruce Weyhrauch , is currently appealing that decision to the United States Supreme Court , which granted certiorari .

 In 1997 , the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit set a key limit on honest services fraud in United States v. Czubinski , ruling that a mere workplace violation does not constitute fraud without evidence of depriving the employer of property in some way . Richard Czubinski was employed in Massachusetts by the Internal Revenue Service when , in 1992 , he violated IRS rules by carrying out several unauthorized searches of the IRS database and accessing files outside of the course of his official duties . In 1995 , he was convicted of wire fraud ( defrauding the IRS of property and the public of his honest services ) and computer fraud . The appellate court reversed the honest services fraud conviction on the basis that Czubinski 's actions did not amount to anything more than a workplace violation , warranting no more than a dismissal : 
 Czubinski was not bribed or otherwise influenced in any public decisionmaking capacity . Nor did he embezzle funds . He did not receive , nor can it be found that he intended to receive , any tangible benefit . ... The conclusive consideration is that the government simply did not prove that Czubinski deprived , or intended to deprive , the public or his employer of their right to his honest services . Although he clearly committed wrongdoing in searching confidential information , there is no suggestion that he failed to carry out his official tasks adequately , or intended to do so . 
 Czubinski 's other convictions were also reversed .

 Although the law is most often applied to corrupt public officials , several federal courts have upheld honest services fraud convictions of private individuals who breached a fiduciary duty to another , such as an employer . 
 Generally , the federal circuit courts have adhered to one of two approaches when dealing with honest services fraud cases . One , the " reasonably foreseeable economic harm " test , requires that the defendant intentionally breached his fiduciary duty and " foresaw or reasonably should have foreseen " that his actions could cause economic harm to his victim . The other , the " materiality " test , requires that the defendant possessed a fraudulent intent and made " any misrepresentation that has the natural tendency to influence or is capable of influencing " the victim to change his behavior .

 In 1997 , the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held in United States v. Frost that private individuals could be also convicted of honest services fraud . Two professors at the University of Tennessee Space Institute , Walter Frost and Robert Eugene Turner , were also president and vice president , respectively , of FWG Associates , a private atmospheric science research firm . Frost and Turner gave FWG reports to two of their students , one a doctoral candidate employed by the Department of the Army and one a master 's degree candidate employed by NASA , allowing them to plagiarize an overwhelming majority of the reports for their respective dissertations . They also allowed another doctoral candidate , employed by NASA , to submit a dissertation which was mostly written by one of their employees at FWG . Their aim was to secure federal contracts with the agencies employing these students . All three students received their degrees , facilitated by Frost and Turner . In addition to many other charges , Frost and Turner were convicted of three counts of mail fraud for defrauding the University of Tennessee of their honest services as employees . On appeal , Frost and Turner argued that § 1346 did not apply to them because they were not public servants . The court disagreed , ruling that " private individuals , such as Frost and Turner , may commit mail fraud by breaching a fiduciary duty and thereby depriving the person or entity to which the duty is owed of the intangible right to the honest services of that individual . " 
 In 1998 , the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld the wire fraud conviction of Sun @-@ Diamond Growers of California for defrauding its hired public relations firm of the honest services of one of its agents , James H. Lake , in order to curry favor with the United States Secretary of Agriculture , Mike Espy . The corporation 's vice president for corporate affairs , Richard Douglas , had acted in the scheme in such a manner that potentially could have caused economic harm to the public relations firm ( tarnishing its reputation by engaging Lake in illegal activity ) – he and Lake had illegally funneled contributions to a congressional candidate , Espy 's brother . Sun @-@ Diamond argued that those actions could not be criminal because there was no intent to do economic harm to the firm . However , the court ruled that an intent to do economic harm was not necessary to have committed wire fraud , affirming a pre @-@ McNally decision in light of the 1988 statute : 
 In the private sector context , § 1346 poses special risks . Every material act of dishonesty by an employee deprives the employer of that worker 's " honest services , " yet not every such act is converted into a federal crime by the mere use of the mails or interstate phone system . Aware of the risk that federal criminal liability could metastasize , we held in Lemire that " not every breach of a fiduciary duty works a criminal fraud . " ... Rather , " [ t ] here must be a failure to disclose something which in the knowledge or contemplation of the employee poses an independent business risk to the employer . " ... Sun @-@ Diamond appears to confuse the requirement of an intent to defraud ... with a requirement of intent to cause economic harm . 
 In 1999 , the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit adopted a similar interpretation in United States v. deVegter . Michael deVegter , a financial advisor hired by Fulton County , Georgia , to craft a professional recommendation of the best underwriter for the county to <unk> deVegter accepted a payment of about $ 42 @,@ 000 from Richard Poirier in exchange for manipulating the report to influence Fulton County into hiring Poirier 's investment banking firm for the underwriter <unk> deVegter and Poirier were both indicted for conspiracy and wire fraud , with the latter including charges under the honest services statute . The district court dismissed the honest services charges for lack of evidence before the trial began ; the government appealed . The court agreed with the government that there was sufficient evidence alleged in the indictment for the defendants to be charged with honest services fraud , because the allegations showed a breach of fiduciary duty and an intent to defraud in such a manner that " reasonably foreseeable economic harm to Fulton County " was a consequence of the scheme . 
 In 2001 , the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit recognized that there were two different tests that other circuit courts had generally used to determine whether honest services fraud had been committed ; in United States v. Vinyard , it concluded that the " reasonably foreseeable economic harm " test was superior ( because it was based on employee intent and not employer response ) and applied that test to the case at hand . The defendant in the case , Michael Vinyard , had been convicted in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina of fourteen counts of mail fraud and twelve counts of money laundering . His brother , James Vinyard , was an employee of the Sunoco Products Corporation who was charged with finding an independent broker to research recycled resins for their manufacture of plastic bags . The brothers instead created their own brokerage , " Charles Stewart Enterprises , " incorporated in the state of Iowa , and misrepresented it to Sunoco as an legitimate , independent firm that was supplying recycled resins at the lowest possible price . They purchased recycled resins from plastic vendors and , marking up the price , sold them to Sunoco , which eventually yielded $ 2 @.@ 8 million in profits . The brothers funneled these profits from CSE to themselves through another entity in order to conceal their involvement with CSE on their tax returns . When the brothers were eventually indicted for mail fraud and money laundering , James Vinyard pleaded guilty and testified against his brother . Michael Vinyard appealed , arguing that his conviction of honest services fraud ( defrauding Sunoco of the honest services of his brother , their employee ) was wrongful because he did not cause harm nor did he intend to cause economic harm to the victim , Sunoco . Upholding his conviction , the court rejected this argument : 
 The reasonably foreseeable harm test is met whenever , at the time of the fraud scheme , the employee could foresee that the scheme potentially might be detrimental to the employer 's economic well @-@ being . Furthermore , the concept of " economic risk " embraces the idea of risk to future opportunities for savings or profit ; the focus on the employer 's wellbeing encompasses both the long @-@ term and the short @-@ term health of the business . Whether the risk materializes or not is irrelevant ; the point is that the employee has no right to endanger the employer 's financial health or jeopardize the employer 's long @-@ term prospects through self @-@ dealing . Therefore , so long as the employee could have reasonably foreseen the risk to which he was exposing the employer , the requirements of § 1346 will have been met . 
 In 2006 , the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit treated the issue of whether private defendants could be prosecuted under § 1346 as settled law , citing the numerous other circuits which had affirmed the practice . In the case United States v. Williams , the defendant , John Anthony Williams , was an Oregon insurance salesman who had sold several annuities to an elderly rancher named Loyd Stubbs . When Stubbs liquidated his annuities , Williams deposited the resulting funds in a joint bank account he had opened in his and Stubbs ' names . Williams proceeded to make massive cash withdrawals from the account , depositing the money in his own personal account and spending much of it ; he also wired money to personal bank accounts he had in Belize and Louisiana . Williams was convicted of four counts of wire fraud , three counts of mail fraud , three counts of money laundering , and one count of foreign transportation of stolen money ; the fraud charges stemmed from schemes to defraud Stubbs of money and of Williams ' honest services as his financial advisor . On appeal , Williams argued that § 1346 did not apply to private commerce . The court disagreed , and , citing previous case law , ruled that within a fiduciary relationship the statute applied . 
 = = = = " Materiality " test = = = = 
 In 1996 , the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit laid out the " materiality " test in its decision in United States v. Gray . Kevin Gray , Gary Thomas , and Troy Drummond were three members of the men 's basketball coaching staff at Baylor University in Texas . These coaches helped five players , recruited from two @-@ year colleges , to obtain the credits required for eligibility and possibly scholarships by providing these students with written course work or answers to correspondence exams , which were then sent to the sponsoring schools as the students ' work . They were convicted of conspiracy , mail fraud , and wire fraud ; the fraud charges stemmed from schemes to deprive Baylor University of both property ( in the form of scholarships ) and the coaches ' honest services as Baylor employees . The court upheld the convictions , affirming the honest services fraud convictions on the basis that the coaches made " material " misrepresentations : 
 A breach of fiduciary duty can constitute illegal fraud ... only when there is some detriment to the employer . ... The detriment can be a deprivation of an employee 's faithful and honest services if a violation of the employee 's duty to disclose material information is involved . ... Materiality exists whenever " an employee has reason to believe the information would lead a reasonable employer to change its business conduct . " ... The information withheld , i.e. the " coaches ' cheating scheme " , was material because Baylor did not get the quality student it expected . Further , appellants failure to disclose the scheme to Baylor was material as Baylor might have been able to recruit other qualified , eligible students to play basketball . Instead , once the scheme was suspected , Baylor was forced to institute a costly investigation and the players under suspicion were withheld from competition . It is quite reasonable to believe that Baylor would have changed its business conduct had it known of the " cheating scheme . " 
 In 1997 , the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit also applied the " materiality " test in its decision in United States v. Cochran . Robert M. Cochran was a bond underwriter in Oklahoma who was convicted of five counts of wire fraud , two counts of money laundering , and one count of interstate transportation of stolen property . Three of wire fraud counts for which Cochran was convicted were honest services fraud . Cochran 's firm , Stifel , Nicolaus & Company , served as managing underwriter when the SSM Healthcare System , a non @-@ profit corporation operating several hospitals and nursing homes , issued more than $ 265 million of tax @-@ exempt bonds ; Sakura Global Capital bid $ 400 @,@ 000 to provide SSM with a forward supply contract . However , SGC subsequently made a secret payment of $ 100 @,@ 000 to Cochran 's firm over the course of three wire transmissions ; thus , Cochran supposedly deprived SSM and its bondholders of his honest services . The appellate court reversed his conviction , deciding that the government did not provide sufficient evidence that Cochran had actually defrauded SSM or its bondholders of his honest services , applying the " materiality " test : 
 Though Stifel misrepresented that SGC would not pay an additional fee to Stifel for the forward supply contract , this information resulted in no actual or potential harm to SSM . ... No evidence independent of the alleged scheme suggests in any way that Mr. Cochran sought to harm SSM or its bondholders . Moreover , we know not from this record how SSM would have changed its conduct had the disclosure been made . 
 In 1999 , the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit diverged from the D.C. Circuit 's Sun @-@ Diamond ruling in its decision in United States v. Pennington . Donald B. Pennington was the president of Harvest Foods , a grocery store chain in eastern Arkansas , when that company contracted with a food broker and a consultant , John Oldner , to negotiate deals between it and its suppliers . The broker and consultant both funneled a portion of their money from Harvest Foods and its supplier to Pennington – through a sham corporation , Capitol City Marketing – as kickbacks . Pennington was convicted of money laundering and mail fraud ; in his appeal he contended that there was insufficient evidence to convict him because the government had failed to show that he had an intent to defraud Harvest Foods of his honest services as its president . The court upheld the conviction , stating that there was sufficient evidence that his actions were a breach of his duty as a fiduciary of Harvest Foods to disclose his material interest in their contracts with Oldner and the broker . However , the court also went further and required ( and found ) intent to economically harm : 
 Pennington and Oldner correctly assert that , when dealing with business transactions in the private sector , a mere breach of fiduciary or employee duty may not be sufficient to deprive a client or corporation of " honest services " for purposes of § 1346 — to be guilty of mail fraud , defendants must also cause or intend to cause actual harm or injury , and in most business contexts , that means financial or economic harm . ... However , proof of intent to harm may be inferred from the willful non @-@ disclosure by a fiduciary , such as a corporate officer , of material information he has a duty to disclose . 
 In 2003 , the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit , like the Fourth Circuit in Vinyard , noted the existence of the two tests , but unlike the Fourth Circuit , it opted to use the " materiality " test ( describing it as " arising out of fundamental principles of the law of fraud " and critiquing the alternative as " designed simply to limit the scope " of the law ) . It applied this test to the case at hand , United States v. Rybicki . The defendants were two personal injury lawyers , Thomas Rybicki and Fredric Grae , in the state of New York ; both were convicted of twenty counts of mail fraud , two counts of wire fraud , and one count of conspiracy . The fraud charges pertained to a scheme to make illegal payments to insurance claims adjusters with the intent of inducing the adjusters to expedite the settlement of certain claims ; Rybicki and Grae made such payments in at least twenty cases . As the acceptance of such payments by the adjusters was against the insurance companies ' policies , Rybicki and Grae had defrauded those insurance companies of the honest services of their employees . Such was the basis for the successful fraud prosecution . The court affirmed the conviction , determining that all of the necessary elements for the crime of honest services fraud to have occurred were present , including material misrepresentation . The court defined the crime thus : 
 The phrase " scheme or artifice [ to defraud ] by <unk> [ ing ] another of the intangible right of honest services , " in the private sector context , means a scheme or artifice to use the mails or wires to enable an officer or employee of a private entity ( or a person in a relationship that gives rise to a duty of loyalty comparable to that owed by employees to employers ) purporting to act for and in the interests of his or her employer ( or of the other person to whom the duty of loyalty is owed ) secretly to act in his or her or the defendant 's own interests instead , accompanied by a material misrepresentation made or omission of information disclosed to the employer or other person . 
 = = Usage and criticism = = 
 The statute grants jurisdiction to the federal government to prosecute local , state and federal officials . It is frequently used to fight public corruption because it is easier to prove than bribery or extortion . The term " honest services " is broad and open to jury interpretation , according to several legal experts . Prosecutions under the 1970 Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ( RICO ) frequently use violations of the honest services statute , as mail and wire fraud are predicate acts of racketeering ; therefore , two mailings or wire transmissions in the execution of honest services fraud can form " a pattern of racketeering activity . " 
 Prosecutions for honest services fraud that do not involve public corruption generally involve corporate crime , although the line between torts and crimes in such cases is considered murky and unclear . 
 The law is reportedly a favorite of federal prosecutors because the language of statute is vague enough to be applied to corrupt political officials ' unethical or criminal activities when they do not fall into a specific category , such as bribery or extortion . For similar reasons , defense attorneys dislike the law , viewing it as a poorly defined law that can be used by prosecutors to convert any kind of unethical behavior into a federal crime . 
 Nevertheless , prosecutors must still prove all the elements of mail fraud or wire fraud in a case regarding a scheme to defraud of honest services . 
 U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has criticized the statute , stating that the clause was so poorly defined that it could be the basis for prosecuting " a mayor for using the prestige of his office to get a table at a restaurant without a reservation . " 
 In The Perfect Villain : John McCain and the <unk> of Lobbyist Jack Abramoff , investigative journalist Gary S. <unk> argued that honest @-@ services fraud is so vague as to be unconstitutional , and that prosecutors abused it as a tool to increase their conviction rates . Bennett L. <unk> , a professor at Pace University Law School , similarly has contended that the law " is not only subject to abuse ... but has been abused . " The case of former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman is often cited as an example of possible prosecutorial misconduct and abuse of the honest services law . 
 Many interest groups oppose the usage of the honest services law , including the conservative United States Chamber of Commerce and Washington Legal Foundation , as well as the more liberal National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers . One notable proponent of the law is the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington .

 In its 2009 @-@ 2010 term , there were three appeals against the statute at the United States Supreme Court , all challenging its constitutionality . All three appellants were convicted of honest services fraud in 2006 or 2007 . 
 Weyhrauch v. United States , by former Alaska state legislator Bruce Weyhrauch , deals with whether a public official can be charged with honest services fraud without violating his duty under state law . 
 Black v. United States , by newspaper magnate Conrad Black , deals with whether there must be proof that the defendant knew his actions would cause economic harm to the company . 
 Skilling v. United States , by former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling , deals with whether the honest services statute requires proof of personal gain . He is also contending that the statute is unconstitutionally vague and unfair . 
 In December 2009 , the Associated Press reported that the Justices of the Court " seemed to be in broad agreement that the law is vague and has been used to make a crime out of mistakes , minor transgressions and mere ethical violations . " Both liberal and conservative justices have criticized the law . Richard Thornburgh , a former United States Attorney General , has remarked that he expects the court to issue " something fairly sweeping ... without doing violence to proper law enforcement . " 
 On June 24 , 2010 , the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in the cases of Black and Skilling that the law against " honest services " fraud is too vague to constitute a crime unless a bribe or kickback was involved . 
 = M @-@ 15 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 15 is a north – south state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan . The southern terminus is a junction with US Highway 24 ( US 24 ) just south of Clarkston on the northwestern edge of the Detroit metropolitan area . The trunkline is a recreational route running north and northwest to the Tri @-@ Cities area . The northern terminus is the junction with M @-@ 25 on the east side of Bay City . The total length is about 73 2 ⁄ 3 miles ( 118 @.@ 6 km ) between the two regions . 
 The original M @-@ 15 designation was used in the northern half of the state in 1919 . This designation was wholly replaced by the US 41 on November 11 , 1926 . This previous designation contained the section of highway in Marquette County that is home to the first painted highway centerline in the nation . Another section in western Marquette County included the first bridge built by the state of Michigan . Within the next year after M @-@ 15 was replaced by US 41 , the designation was reused for a new highway routing along the current highway . This current highway was extended northerly to eventually end at I @-@ 75 in Bay City , before it was scaled back slightly to end in southeast Bay City . A proposed , but unbuilt , extension around the west side of Metro Detroit later became part of the I @-@ 275 corridor . 
 This highway is now a part of the Pure Michigan Byway System , but none of it is located on the National Highway System . A section of the two @-@ lane highway has the local moniker , " Death Alley " , where the local sheriff says the highway is poorly designed . The stretch of highway in Genesee County has been the location of 14 traffic fatalities between 2004 and 2009 as reported by The Flint Journal , including that of a 14 @-@ year @-@ old local girl . 
 = = Route description = = 
 M @-@ 15 runs through mostly rural agricultural communities of The Thumb connecting the northern edge of Metro Detroit with the Tri @-@ Cities area . It starts at a junction south of the village of Clarkston in northern Oakland County . The highway runs north along Ortonville Road from the intersection with US 24 ( Dixie Highway ) near Deer and Middle lakes through Clarkston . Continuing through town on Main Street near Parke Lake , it comes to an interchange with Interstate 75 ( I @-@ 75 ) north of the village next to Little Walters Lake . South of Ortonville near Lake Louise and Bald Eagle Lake , M @-@ 15 turns northwest between the two lakes . The trunkline becomes State Road at the county line and turns north again near <unk> Lake near the Ortonville State Recreation Area outside Goodrich in southeastern Genesee County . South of Davison , M @-@ 15 intersects I @-@ 69 near the Davison Country Club before running through town . In Otisville , State Road curves around to the west of some small lakes and through town . 
 State Road turns northwesterly again in Millington in southwestern Tuscola County , heading up to Vassar . In Vassar , M @-@ 15 intersects and turns northwest along Huron Avenue , a historical routing of M @-@ 24 , crossing the Cass River in town . Outside Vassar , Huron Avenue becomes Saginaw Road . In western Tuscola County , M @-@ 15 intersects M @-@ 46 in the community of Richville . The name of the road changes in Saginaw County to Vassar Road , and the trunkline continues northwesterly through the <unk> Township communities of <unk> Corners and Arthur . Arthur is located along the highway between the M @-@ 83 and M @-@ 81 junctions . 
 In Bay County , M @-@ 15 follows Tuscola Road where it meets the western terminus of M @-@ 138 which runs along Munger Road in Munger . As the highway enters Bay City on the southeast side of town , Tuscola Road leaves the farmlands for residential areas of Bay City . The roadway runs <unk> near the St. Stanislaus , St. Patrick and Elm Lawn cemeteries , before turning north on Trumbull Street at 10th Street . The highway follows Trumbull Street for five blocks , where the highway designation ends at a four @-@ way intersection with M @-@ 25 / Center Avenue . Trumbull Street continues north through this residential section of the city .

 On July 1 , 1919 , the original routing of M @-@ 15 was located in the Upper Peninsula ( UP ) . It ran from the state line along the Menominee River in Menominee , connecting with STH @-@ 15 in Wisconsin , running north through the UP to Escanaba , Marquette and Houghton . Between Powers and Escanaba , M @-@ 15 ran concurrently with M @-@ 12 . The northern terminus of the highway was at Fort Wilkins in Copper Harbor . The first highway centerline in the nation was painted along a section of the highway in 1917 , along the Marquette – Negaunee Road , now a part of Marquette County Road 492 . 
 The Peshekee River Bridge , carried M @-@ 15 over the Peshekee River in western Marquette County 's Michigamme Township . The bridge was built in 1914 in response to the 1913 State Trunk Line Act passed by the Michigan Legislature . This act designated a state trunkline highway network of nearly 3 @,@ 000 miles ( 4 @,@ 828 km ) . The act further said that the Michigan State Highway Department would design , build and maintain trunkline bridges spanning 30 feet ( 9 m ) or more so long as the local governments improved an adjacent 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) of roads . Marquette County built a mainline road from Marquette west to Michigamme near the county line , this road generally followed what is now known as County Road 492 ( CR 492 ) . About 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) west of Marquette on CR 492 is a historical marker at the site of the first center line painted in 1917 along Dead Man 's Curve . M @-@ 15 continued through Morgan Meadows and crossing the Carp River into the town of Negaunee and connecting with Ishpeming . This road in now known as East Division or " County Road " also former Business M @-@ 28 . West of Ishpeming in Ishpeming Township , M @-@ 15 followed Randal Drive and Westward to North Lake Junction . M @-@ 15 made its way along what is now CR 496 and several abandoned sections through Clarksburg and Humboldt Locations and the village of Champion . West of Champion M @-@ 15 continued to Michigamme crossing the Peshekee River , Marquette County improved a 3 @-@ mile ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) section in 1913 to encourage the state to build the bridge . The bridge was designed by C.V. Dewart for the department and built by the local firm of Powell and Mitchell in Marquette . The bridge was designated Trunk Line Bridge No. 1 as the first state @-@ built bridge on the trunkline highway system . 
 The 1925 draft plan for the establishment of the US Highway System would have replaced M @-@ 15 with three different US Highways . Between Menominee and Powers , M @-@ 15 was to be replaced by US 41 . East of Powers to Rapid River , the trunkline would have been US 2 . The next segment between Rapid River and Covington was planned as US 102 while the remainder north to Copper Harbor was planned as US 41 In between Powers and Covington , US 41 was planned to follow US 2 west to Iron Mountain and then route of the modern US 141 between Powers and Covington . When the system was announced on November 11 , 1926 , US 41 was the only US Highway routed along the alignment of M @-@ 15 . The original map showed US 41 following an unbuilt alignment between Powers and Marquette , but the US 41 designation was instead routed to follow the former M @-@ 15 . 
 = = = Current designation = = = 
 The current routing of M @-@ 15 was designated after 1926 . The southern end was located at US 10 in Clarkston running north to M @-@ 38 and M @-@ 24 in Vassar . By the end of 1936 , M @-@ 15 was extended concurrently along M @-@ 24 from Vassar into Bay City . By June 1942 , the M @-@ 24 concurrency was removed as M @-@ 24 was realigned to replace M @-@ 85 between Vassar and Caro . By July 1 , 1960 , the northern end was extended to run concurrently with M @-@ 25 and BUS US 23 to US 23 on the west side of Bay City . This M @-@ 15 / M @-@ 25 routing was extended again in the next year to end at the new I @-@ 75 / US 10 / US 23 freeway . These two northerly extensions were both reversed and scaled back in 1970 . M @-@ 15 's northern end is moved back to M @-@ 25 / Center Avenue in Bay City , its current location . At some time after the 1993 beginning of the program , M @-@ 15 was named the " Pathway to Family Fun " Recreational Heritage Route in what is now the Pure Michigan Byway System . Running roughly parallel to I @-@ 75 , the route has not been added to the National Highway System , a system of roadways considered important to the nation 's economy , defense and mobility . 
 The state highway map in 1933 showed a proposed southern extension from Clarkston through southern Oakland County , Wayne County into Monroe County . This proposed highway would have bypassed Metro Detroit to the west through Farmington , Northville , Plymouth and Belleville . The full highway was never built , and M @-@ 15 was never extended south of Clarkston , but part of this proposal was completed . Much of it later became Haggerty Highway , and part of the I @-@ 275 and M @-@ 5 corridors .

 M @-@ 15 between the Oakland County line and I @-@ 69 has been nicknamed by locals as " Death Alley " . On April 17 , 2009 , The Flint Journal reported that between 2004 and April 2009 , 14 people died on the stretch of road in car accidents . When Genesee County Sheriff Robert J. <unk> was asked about the stretch , he said the road suffers from a bad design , including a lack of turn lanes . He was quoted as saying , " It 's a death trap " . The Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) looks at roadways after every fatal crash to determine what improvements could be made . Other local government officials have called for solutions to safety issues on the roadway .

 = Boeing 757 = 
 The Boeing 757 is a mid @-@ size , narrow @-@ body twin @-@ engine jet airliner that was designed and built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes . It is the manufacturer 's largest single @-@ aisle passenger aircraft and was produced from 1981 to 2004 . The twinjet has a two @-@ crew member glass cockpit , turbofan engines of sufficient power to allow takeoffs from relatively short runways and higher altitudes , a conventional tail and , for reduced aerodynamic drag , a supercritical wing design . Intended to replace the smaller three @-@ engine 727 on short and medium routes , the 757 can carry 200 to 295 passengers for a maximum of 3 @,@ 150 to 4 @,@ 100 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 830 to 7 @,@ 590 km ) , depending on variant . The 757 was designed concurrently with a wide @-@ body twinjet , the 767 , and owing to shared features pilots can obtain a common type rating that allows them to operate both aircraft . 
 The 757 was produced in two fuselage lengths . The original 757 @-@ 200 entered service in 1983 ; the 757 @-@ 200PF , a package freighter ( PF ) variant , and the 757 @-@ 200M , a passenger @-@ freighter combi model , debuted in the late 1980s . The stretched 757 @-@ 300 , the longest narrow @-@ body twinjet ever produced , began service in 1999 . Passenger 757 @-@ 200s have been modified to special freighter ( SF ) specification for cargo use , while military derivatives include the C @-@ 32 transport , VIP carriers , and other multi @-@ purpose aircraft . Private and government operators have also customized the 757 for research and transport roles . All 757s are powered by Rolls @-@ Royce RB211 or Pratt & Whitney PW2000 series turbofans . 
 Eastern Air Lines and British Airways placed the 757 in commercial service in 1983 . The narrow @-@ body twinjet succeeded earlier single @-@ aisle airliners , and became commonly used for short and mid @-@ range domestic routes , shuttle services , and transcontinental U.S. flights . After regulators granted approval for extended flights over water ( ETOPS ) in 1986 , airlines also began using the aircraft for intercontinental routes . Major customers for the 757 included U.S. mainline carriers , European charter airlines , and cargo companies . The airliner has recorded eight hull @-@ loss accidents , including seven fatal crashes , as of September 2015 . 
 Production of the 757 ended in October 2004 , after 1 @,@ 050 had been built for 54 customers . The 757 @-@ 200 was by far the most popular model , with 913 built . Diminished sales amid an airline industry trend toward smaller jetliners led Boeing to end production without a direct replacement , in favor of the 737 family . The last 757 was delivered to Shanghai Airlines in November 2005 . In July 2015 , 738 of the narrow @-@ body twinjets were in airline service ; Delta Air Lines is the largest operator with 138 aircraft . 
 = = Development = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 In the early 1970s , following the launch of the wide @-@ body 747 , Boeing began considering further developments of its narrow @-@ body 727 trijet . Designed for short and medium length routes , the three @-@ engined 727 was the best @-@ selling commercial jetliner of the 1960s and a mainstay of the U.S. domestic airline market . Studies focused on improving the 189 @-@ seat 727 @-@ 200 , the most successful 727 variant . Two approaches were considered : a stretched 727 @-@ 300 , and an all @-@ new aircraft code @-@ named 7N7 . The former was a cheaper derivative using the 727 's existing technology and tail @-@ mounted engine configuration , while the latter was a twin @-@ engine aircraft which made use of new materials and improvements to propulsion technology which had become available in the civil aerospace industry . 
 United Airlines provided input for the proposed 727 @-@ 300 , which Boeing was poised to launch in late 1975 , but lost interest after examining development studies for the 7N7 . Although the 727 @-@ 300 was offered to Braniff International Airways and other carriers , customer interest remained insufficient for further development . Instead , airlines were drawn to the high @-@ bypass @-@ ratio turbofan engines , new flight deck technologies , lower weight , improved aerodynamics , and reduced operating cost promised by the 7N7 . These features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new mid @-@ size wide @-@ body airliner , code @-@ named 7X7 , which became the 767 . Work on both proposals accelerated as a result of the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s . 
 By 1978 , development studies focused on two variants : a 7N7 @-@ 100 with seating for 160 , and a 7N7 @-@ 200 with room for over 180 seats . New features included a redesigned wing , under @-@ wing engines , and lighter materials , while the forward fuselage , cockpit layout , and T @-@ tail configuration were retained from the 727 . Boeing planned for the aircraft to offer the lowest fuel burn per passenger @-@ kilometer of any narrow @-@ body airliner . On August 31 , 1978 , Eastern Air Lines and British Airways became the first carriers to publicly commit to the 7N7 when they announced launch orders totaling 40 aircraft for the 7N7 @-@ 200 version . These orders were signed in March 1979 , when Boeing officially designated the aircraft as the 757 . The shorter 757 @-@ 100 did not receive any orders and was dropped ; 737s later fulfilled its envisioned role . 
 = = = Design effort = = = 
 The 757 was intended to be more capable and more efficient than the preceding 727 . The focus on fuel efficiency reflected airline concerns over operating costs , which had grown amid rising oil prices during the Yom Kippur War of 1973 . Design targets included a 20 percent reduction in fuel consumption from new engines , plus an additional 10 percent from aerodynamic improvements , versus preceding aircraft . Lighter materials and new wings were also expected to improve efficiency . The maximum take @-@ off weight ( MTOW ) was set at 220 @,@ 000 pounds ( 99 @,@ 800 kg ) , which was 10 @,@ 000 pounds ( 4 @,@ 540 kg ) more than the 727 . The 757 's higher power @-@ to @-@ weight ratio allowed it to take off from short runways and serve airports in hot and high climates , offering better takeoff performance than that offered by competing aircraft . Competitors needed longer takeoff runs at airports at higher elevations , with higher ambient temperatures and thinner air . Boeing also offered options for higher payload capability . 
 The twin @-@ engine configuration was chosen for greater fuel efficiency versus three- and four @-@ engine designs . Launch customers Eastern Air Lines and British Airways selected the RB211 @-@ 535C turbofan built by Rolls @-@ Royce , which was capable of 37 @,@ 400 pounds @-@ force ( 166 kN ) of thrust . This marked the first time that a Boeing airliner was launched with engines produced outside the U.S. Domestic manufacturer Pratt & Whitney subsequently offered the 38 @,@ 200 pounds @-@ force ( 170 kN ) thrust PW2037 , which Delta Air Lines launched with an order for 60 aircraft in November 1980 . General Electric also offered its CF6 @-@ 32 engine early in the program , but eventually abandoned its involvement due to insufficient demand . 
 As development progressed , the 757 increasingly departed from its 727 origins and adopted elements from the 767 , which was several months ahead in development . To reduce risk and cost , Boeing combined design work on both twinjets , resulting in shared features such as interior fittings and handling characteristics . Computer @-@ aided design , first applied on the 767 , was used for over one @-@ third of the 757 's design drawings . In early 1979 , a common two @-@ crew member glass cockpit was adopted for the two aircraft , including shared instrumentation , avionics , and flight management systems . Cathode @-@ ray tube ( CRT ) color displays replaced conventional electromechanical instruments , with increased automation eliminating the flight engineer position common to three @-@ person cockpits . After completing a short conversion course , pilots rated on the 757 could be qualified to fly the 767 and vice versa , owing to their design similarities . 
 A new aft @-@ loaded shape which produced lift across most of the upper wing surface , instead of a narrow band as in previous airfoil designs , was used for the 757 's wings . The more efficient wings had less drag and greater fuel capacity , and were similar in configuration to those on the 767 . A wider wingspan than the 727 's produced less lift @-@ induced drag , while larger wing roots increased undercarriage storage space and provided room for future stretched versions of the aircraft . 
 One of the last 727 vestiges , the T @-@ tail , was dropped in mid @-@ 1979 in favor of a conventional tail . This avoided the risk of an aerodynamic condition known as a deep stall , and allowed for more passengers to be carried in a less tapered rear fuselage . At 155 @.@ 3 feet ( 47 @.@ 3 m ) in length , the 757 @-@ 200 was 2 @.@ 1 feet ( 0 @.@ 640 m ) longer than the 727 @-@ 200 , and with a greater proportion of its internal volume devoted to cabin space , seating was available for 239 passengers , or 50 more than its predecessor . The fuselage cross @-@ section , whose upper lobe was common to the 707 and 737 , was the only major structural feature to be retained from the 727 . This was mainly to reduce drag , and while a wider fuselage had been considered , Boeing 's market research found low cargo capacity needs and reduced passenger preference for wide @-@ body aircraft on short @-@ haul routes . 
 = = = Production and testing = = = 
 Boeing built a final assembly line in Washington at its Renton factory , home of 707 , 727 , and 737 production , to produce the 757 . Early in the development program , Boeing , British Airways , and Rolls @-@ Royce unsuccessfully lobbied the British aircraft industry to manufacture 757 wings . Ultimately , about half of the aircraft 's components , including the wings , nose section , and empennage , were produced in @-@ house at Boeing facilities , and the remainder subcontracted to primarily U.S.-based companies . Fairchild Aircraft made the leading edge slats , Grumman supplied the flaps , and Rockwell International produced the main fuselage . Production ramp @-@ up for the new narrow @-@ body airliner coincided with the winding @-@ down of the 727 program , and final assembly of the first aircraft began in January 1981 . 
 The prototype 757 rolled out of the Renton factory on January 13 , 1982 . The aircraft , equipped with RB211 @-@ 535C engines , completed its maiden flight one week ahead of schedule on February 19 , 1982 . The first flight was affected by an engine stall , following indications of low oil pressure . After checking system diagnostics , company test pilot John Armstrong and co @-@ pilot Lew Wallick were able to restart the affected engine , and the flight proceeded normally thereafter . Subsequently , the 757 embarked on a seven @-@ day weekly flight test schedule . By this time , the aircraft had received 136 orders from seven carriers , namely Air Florida , American Airlines , British Airways , Delta Air Lines , Eastern Air Lines , Monarch Airlines , and <unk> . 
 The seven @-@ month 757 flight test program used the first five aircraft built . Tasks included flight systems and propulsion tests , hot and cold weather trials , and route @-@ proving flights . Data from the 767 program helped expedite the process . After design issues were identified , the 757 's exit doors received dual @-@ spring mechanisms for easier operation , and the fuselage was strengthened for greater bird strike resistance . The production aircraft was 3 @,@ 600 pounds ( 1 @,@ 630 kg ) lighter than originally specified , and recorded a three percent better @-@ than @-@ expected rate of fuel burn . This resulted in a range increase of 200 nautical miles ( 370 km ) , and prompted Boeing to tout the aircraft 's fuel efficiency characteristics . After 1 @,@ 380 flight test hours , the RB211 @-@ powered 757 received U.S. Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) certification on December 21 , 1982 , followed by U.K. Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) certification on January 14 , 1983 . The first delivery to launch customer Eastern Air Lines occurred on December 22 , 1982 , about four months after the first 767 deliveries . The first 757 with PW2037 engines rolled out about one year later , and was delivered to Delta Air Lines on November 5 , 1984 . 
 = = = Service entry and operations = = = 
 Eastern Air Lines operated the first commercial 757 flight on January 1 , 1983 , on the Atlanta @-@ to @-@ Tampa route . On February 9 , 1983 , British Airways began using the aircraft for London @-@ to @-@ Belfast shuttle services , where it replaced Hawker Siddeley Trident 3B trijets . Charter carriers Monarch Airlines and Air Europe also began 757 operations later that year . Early operators noted improved reliability and quieter performance compared with previous jetliners . Transition courses eased pilots ' introduction to the new CRT @-@ based cockpit , and no major technical issues arose . Eastern Air Lines , the first 727 operator to take delivery of 757s , confirmed that the aircraft had greater payload capability than its predecessor , along with lower operating costs through improved fuel burn and the use of a two @-@ crew member flight deck . Compared with the 707 and 727 , the new twinjet consumed 42 and 40 percent less fuel per seat , respectively , on typical medium @-@ haul flights . 
 Despite the successful debut , 757 sales remained stagnant for most of the 1980s , a consequence of declining fuel prices and a shift to smaller aircraft in the post @-@ deregulation U.S. market . Although no direct competitor existed , 150 @-@ seat narrow @-@ bodies such as the McDonnell Douglas MD @-@ 80 were cheaper to acquire and carried nearly as many passengers as some airlines ' 757s . A three @-@ year sales drought abated in November 1983 when Northwest Airlines placed orders for 20 aircraft , which averted a costly production rate decrease . In December 1985 , a freighter model , the 757 @-@ 200PF , was announced following a launch order for 20 aircraft from UPS Airlines , and in February 1986 , a freighter @-@ passenger combi model , the 757 @-@ 200M , was launched with an order for one aircraft from Royal Nepal Airlines . The freighter model included a main deck cargo hold and entered service with UPS in September 1987 . The combi model could carry both cargo and passengers on its main deck and entered service with Royal Nepal Airlines in September 1988 . 
 In the late 1980s , increasing airline hub congestion and the onset of U.S. airport noise regulations fueled a turnaround in 757 sales . From 1988 to 1989 , airlines placed 322 orders , including a combined 160 orders from American Airlines and United Airlines . By this time , the 757 had become commonplace on short @-@ haul domestic flights and transcontinental services in the U.S. , and had replaced aging 707s , 727s , Douglas DC @-@ 8s , and McDonnell Douglas DC @-@ 9s . The 757 @-@ 200 's maximum range of 3 @,@ 900 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 220 km ) , which was over one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half times the 727 's , allowed airlines to use the aircraft on longer nonstop routes . The 757 was also flown out of airports with stringent noise regulations , such as John Wayne Airport in Orange County , California , and airports with aircraft size restrictions , such as Washington National Airport near downtown Washington , D.C. The largest U.S. operators , Delta Air Lines and American Airlines , would ultimately operate fleets of over 100 aircraft each . 
 In Europe , British Airways , Iberia , and Icelandair were the 757 's largest mainline customers , while other carriers such as Lufthansa rejected the type as too large for their narrow @-@ body aircraft needs . Many European charter airlines , including Air 2000 , Air Holland , and <unk> International , also acquired the twinjet for holiday and tour package flights in the late 1980s . In Asia , where even bigger aircraft were commonly preferred because of large passenger volumes , the 757 found fewer orders . A 1982 sales demonstration was unable to attract a purchase from potential customer Japan Airlines , and the first Asian customer , Singapore Airlines , sold its four 757s in 1989 in favor of standardizing on the 240 @-@ seat wide @-@ body Airbus A310 , just five years after debuting the type on Indonesian and Malaysian routes . The 757 fared better in China , where following an initial purchase by the Civil Aviation Administration of China ( <unk> ) in 1987 , orders grew to 59 aircraft , making it the largest Asian market . Operators such as China Southern , China Southwest , Shanghai Airlines , Xiamen Airlines , and Xinjiang Airlines used the 757 on medium length domestic routes . 
 In 1986 , the FAA approved RB211 @-@ powered 757s for extended @-@ range twin @-@ engine operational performance standards ( ETOPS ) operations over the North Atlantic , following precedents set by the 767 . Under ETOPS regulations , a set of safety standards governing twinjet flights over oceans and other areas without nearby suitable landing sites , airlines began using the aircraft for mid @-@ range intercontinental routes . Although the 757 was not originally intended for transoceanic flights , regulators based their decision on its reliable performance record on extended transcontinental U.S. services . ETOPS certification for 757s equipped with PW2000 series engines was granted in 1992 . 
 In the early 1990s , the FAA and other U.S. government agencies , including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) and the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) , began studying the 757 's wake turbulence characteristics . This followed several incidents , including two fatal crashes , in which small private aircraft experienced loss of control when flying close behind the twinjet . Smaller airliners had also suffered unexpected rolling movements when flying behind 757s . Investigators focused on the aircraft 's aft @-@ loaded wing design , which at certain points during takeoff or landing could produce wingtip vortices that were stronger than those emanating from larger 767s and 747s . Other tests were inconclusive , leading to debate among government agencies , and in 1994 and 1996 the FAA updated air traffic control regulations to require greater separation behind the 757 than other large @-@ category jets . The 757 became the only sub @-@ 300 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 136 @,@ 000 kg ) airliner to be classified as a " heavy " jet , alongside wide @-@ body aircraft , under FAA separation rules . 
 = = = Stretched variant = = = 
 Production of the 757 peaked at an annual rate of 100 aircraft in the early 1990s , during which time upgraded models came under consideration . For over a decade , the narrow @-@ body twinjet had been its manufacturer 's only single @-@ aisle airliner without a stretched variant , and while rumors of a long @-@ range 757 @-@ 200X and stretched 757 @-@ <unk> persisted , no formal announcements had been made . European charter carriers were particularly interested in a higher @-@ capacity version which could take better advantage of the 757 's range . Besides meeting the needs of charter customers , a larger model would enable Boeing to match the passenger lift capabilities of the 767 @-@ 200 with lower operating costs , and counter longer @-@ range versions of the 185 @-@ seat Airbus A321 , a new stretched variant of the A320 narrow @-@ body airliner . 
 In September 1996 , following a launch order for 12 aircraft from charter carrier Condor , Boeing announced the stretched 757 @-@ 300 at the Farnborough Airshow . The new model was a 23 @.@ 4 @-@ foot ( 7 @.@ 13 m ) stretch of the 757 @-@ 200 , resulting in room for 50 more passengers and nearly 50 percent more cargo . The type 's design phase was intended to be the shortest in its manufacturer 's history , with 27 months from launch to certification . Due to development and cost concerns , radical upgrades such as a Next Generation 737 @-@ style advanced cockpit were not implemented . Instead , the stretched derivative received upgraded engines , enhanced avionics , and a redesigned interior . The first 757 @-@ 300 rolled out on May 31 , 1998 , and completed its maiden flight on August 2 , 1998 . Following regulatory certification in January 1999 , the type entered service with Condor on March 19 , 1999 . 
 The 757 @-@ 300 was also ordered by American Trans Air , Arkia Israel Airlines , Continental Airlines , Icelandair , and Northwest Airlines . Sales for the type remained slow , and ultimately totaled 55 aircraft . Boeing had targeted the 757 @-@ 300 as a potential 767 @-@ 200 replacement for two of its largest customers , American Airlines and United Airlines , but neither were in a financial position to commit to new aircraft . Overtures to other charter airlines also did not result in further orders . By November 1999 , faced with diminishing sales and a reduced backlog despite the launch of the 757 @-@ 300 , Boeing began studying a decrease in 757 production rates . 
 = = = Further developments = = = 
 While the 757 program had been financially successful , declining sales in the early 2000s threatened its continued viability . Airlines were again gravitating toward smaller aircraft , now mainly the 737 and A320 , because of their reduced financial risk . An airline industry downturn and the large number of relatively young 757s already in service also reduced customer demand . In 2000 , spurred by interest from Air 2000 and Continental Airlines , Boeing reexamined the possibility of building a longer @-@ range 757 @-@ 200X . The proposed derivative would have featured auxiliary fuel tanks , plus wing and landing gear upgrades from the 757 @-@ 300 , resulting in a higher MTOW and a potential range increase to over 5 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 9 @,@ 260 km ) . However , the proposal failed to garner any orders . In March 2001 , Boeing delivered the first 757 @-@ 200SF , a second @-@ hand 757 @-@ 200 converted for freighter use , to DHL Aviation . The 757 @-@ 200SF marked the manufacturer 's first foray into passenger @-@ to @-@ freighter conversions . 
 Customer interest in new 757s continued to decline , and in 2003 , a renewed sales campaign centered on the 757 @-@ 300 and 757 @-@ 200PF yielded only five new orders . In October 2003 , following Continental Airlines ' decision to switch its remaining 757 @-@ 300 orders to the 737 @-@ 800 , Boeing announced the end of 757 production . The <unk> and last example , a 757 @-@ 200 built for Shanghai Airlines , rolled off the production line at the Renton factory on October 28 , 2004 , and was delivered on November 28 , 2005 , after several months of storage . With the conclusion of the 757 program , Boeing consolidated 737 assembly at its Renton factory , downsizing its facilities by 40 percent and shifting staff to different locations . 
 Since the end of production , most 757s have remained in service , mainly in the U.S. From 2004 to 2008 , the average fuel cost for typical mid @-@ range U.S. domestic 757 flights tripled , putting pressure on airlines to improve the fuel efficiency of their fleets . In May 2005 , the FAA granted regulatory approval for manufacturer @-@ sanctioned blended winglets from Aviation Partners Incorporated as a retrofit on the 757 @-@ 200 . The winglets improve fuel efficiency by five percent and increase range by 200 nautical miles ( 370 km ) through the reduction of lift @-@ induced drag . Continental Airlines was the first carrier to order winglets for the 757 @-@ 200 , and in February 2009 became the first operator of 757 @-@ 300s with winglets . 
 In the 2010s , the 757 has remained the only narrow @-@ body aircraft in use by the large fleets of all three U.S. legacy carriers : American Airlines , Delta Air Lines and United Airlines . During this period , the 757 's capacity and range capabilities have remained largely unequaled among narrow @-@ body airliners ; when selecting replacement aircraft , airlines have had to either downsize to smaller single @-@ aisle aircraft in production with fewer seats and less range such as the 737 @-@ 900ER and A321 , or <unk> to the larger , longer @-@ range 787 Dreamliner and A330 @-@ 200 wide @-@ body jets . The Tupolev Tu @-@ 204 , a narrow @-@ body twinjet introduced in 1989 with a design similar to the 757 's , is offered in a 200 @-@ seat version , which has seen limited production for mainly Russian customers . Within Boeing , the 215 @-@ seat , 3 @,@ 200 @-@ nautical @-@ mile ( 5 @,@ 930 km ) range 737 @-@ 900ER has been regarded as the closest aircraft in production to the 757 @-@ 200 . 
 = = = Replacement aircraft = = = 
 Boeing officials stated in 2011 that the manufacturer had no plans to develop a dedicated 200 @-@ seat airliner to replace its largest narrow @-@ body aircraft . Instead , a new airliner family , code @-@ named Y1 , was being considered for the <unk> to 180 @-@ seat markets covered by the 737 @-@ 700 and 737 @-@ 800 . Stretched Y1 models or a medium @-@ range version of the 787 Dreamliner were possible replacements for the 757 . In 2012 , after shelving the Y1 project in favor of the redesigned and re @-@ engined 737 MAX family , Boeing indicated that the larger 737 MAX models ( particularly the largest and longest range variant , 737 MAX 9 ) would cover the bulk of the 757 replacement market . Company officials further emphasized that up to 95 percent of the 757 's current routes could be flown by the 737 MAX . 
 In 2014 , Airbus launched the Airbus A321neoLR , a model with three auxiliary fuel tanks and seating for 206 passengers . The European manufacturer states that the new variant will exceed the range of a 757 @-@ 200 with winglets and be more fuel @-@ efficient . In response , the options open to Boeing include developing and building a new aircraft , whose cost could reach US $ 15 billion , or revising and enhancing the 767 , as well as <unk> and improving the wings of the existing 757 . Officials at Air Lease Corporation , which has ordered the Airbus A321neoLR , have urged Boeing to build an all @-@ new twin @-@ aisle airplane for 7 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 130 m ) runways . However , Boeing officials have declined to respond directly to Airbus ' decision to launch the A321neoLR , and have dismissed its rival 's projections of demand for 1 @,@ 000 aircraft ; instead , the company now considers the space between the 737 MAX 9 and the 787 @-@ 8 to be a niche , and foresees a more modest , incremental market . Boeing officials have also dismissed suggestions to <unk> the 757 . Whether the 757 replacement market is commercially viable has been debated by aviation industry analysts , with some skeptics pointing to the fact that over 150 aircraft , or approximately 15 percent of the worldwide 757 fleet , are currently unused and parked in desert storage . 
 In early 2015 , Boeing disclosed that it was conducting studies for a long @-@ haul 757 successor aimed at transatlantic routes too long for the A321neoLR and 737 MAX 9 . Such an aircraft would carry more passengers than the 737 MAX and have more range than the 757 . A parallel development along with the 737 replacement , similar to when the 757 and 767 were developed in the 1970s , is under consideration . As of February 2015 , Boeing has not committed to a replacement ( which would be available after the 777X ) , but is polling customers such as United Airlines on how to fill the gap between the 737 MAX 9 and the 787 . Boeing calls the successor airliner " MOM " for Middle of Market . The airplane could likely seat 220 passengers and be sized between the 737 and 787 @-@ 8 Dreamliner .

 = = = Overview = = = 
 The 757 is a low @-@ wing cantilever monoplane with a conventional tail unit featuring a single fin and rudder . Each wing features a supercritical cross @-@ section and is equipped with five @-@ panel leading edge slats , single- and double @-@ slotted flaps , an outboard aileron , and six spoilers . The wings are largely identical across all 757 variants , swept at 25 degrees , and optimized for a cruising speed of Mach 0 @.@ 8 ( 533 mph or 858 km / h ) . The reduced wing sweep eliminates the need for inboard ailerons , yet incurs little drag penalty on short and medium length routes , during which most of the flight is spent climbing or descending . The airframe further incorporates carbon @-@ fiber reinforced plastic wing surfaces , Kevlar fairings and access panels , plus improved aluminum alloys , which together reduce overall weight by 2 @,@ 100 pounds ( 950 kg ) . 
 To distribute the aircraft 's weight on the ground , the 757 has a retractable tricycle landing gear with four wheels on each main gear and two for the nose gear . The landing gear was purposely designed to be taller than the company 's previous narrow @-@ body aircraft in order to provide ground clearance for stretched models . In 1982 , the 757 @-@ 200 became the first subsonic jetliner to offer carbon brakes as a factory option , supplied by Dunlop . The stretched 757 @-@ 300 features a retractable tailskid on its aft fuselage to prevent damage if the tail section contacts the runway surface during takeoff . 
 Besides common avionics and computer systems , the 757 shares its auxiliary power unit , electric power systems , flight deck , and hydraulic parts with the 767 . Through operational commonality , 757 pilots can obtain a common type rating to fly the 767 and share the same seniority roster with pilots of either aircraft . This reduces costs for airlines that operate both twinjets . 
 = = = Flight systems = = = 
 The 757 's flight deck uses six Rockwell Collins CRT screens to display flight instrumentation , as well as an electronic flight instrument system ( EFIS ) and an engine indication and crew alerting system ( EICAS ) . These systems allow the pilots to handle monitoring tasks previously performed by the flight engineer . An enhanced flight management system , improved over versions used on early 747s , automates navigation and other functions , while an automatic landing system facilitates CAT IIIb instrument landings in 490 feet ( 150 m ) low visibility conditions . The inertial reference system ( IRS ) which debuted with the 757 @-@ 200 was the first to feature laser @-@ light gyros . On the 757 @-@ 300 , the upgraded flight deck features a Honeywell Pegasus flight management computer , enhanced EICAS , and updated software systems . 
 To accommodate the same flight deck design as the 767 , the 757 has a more rounded nose section than previous narrow @-@ body aircraft . The resulting space has unobstructed panel visibility and room for an observer seat . Similar pilot viewing angles as the 767 result from a downward sloped cockpit floor and the same forward cockpit windows . 
 Three independent hydraulic systems are installed on the 757 , one powered by each engine , and the third using electric pumps . A ram air turbine is fitted to provide power for essential controls in the event of an emergency . A basic form of fly @-@ by @-@ wire facilitates spoiler operation , utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables . The fly @-@ by @-@ wire system , shared with the 767 , reduces weight and provides for the independent operation of individual spoilers . When equipped for extended @-@ range operations , the 757 features a backup hydraulic motor generator and an additional cooling fan in the aircraft 's electronics bay . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 The 757 interior allows seat arrangements of up to six per row with a single center aisle . Originally optimized for flights averaging two hours , the 757 features interior lighting and cabin architecture designs aimed at a more spacious impression . As on the 767 , garment @-@ bag @-@ length overhead bins and a rear economy @-@ class galley are standard equipment . The bins have twice the capacity as those on the preceding 727 . To save weight , honeycomb sandwich is used for interior paneling and bins . Unlike previous evacuation slide designs which are not equipped for water landings , the 757 's main exits feature combination slide rafts similar to those found on the 747 . In the 1980s , Boeing altered the interior designs of its other narrow @-@ body aircraft to be similar to that of the 757 . 
 In 1998 , the 757 @-@ 300 debuted a redesigned interior derived from the Next Generation 737 and 777 , including sculptured ceiling panels , indirect lighting , and larger overhead bins with an optional continuous handrail built into their base for the entire cabin length . Centerline storage containers mounted in the aisle ceiling for additional escape rafts and other emergency equipment were also added . The 757 @-@ 300 's interior later became an option on all new 757 @-@ 200s . In 2000 , with wheeled carry @-@ on baggage becoming more popular , Delta Air Lines began installing overhead bin extensions on their 757 @-@ 200s to provide additional storage space , and American Airlines did the same in 2001 . The larger bins are part of aftermarket interior upgrades which include updated ceiling panels and lighting . 
 = = Variants = = 
 The 757 was produced in standard and stretched lengths . The original 757 @-@ 200 debuted as a passenger model , and was subsequently developed into the 757 @-@ 200PF and 757 @-@ 200SF cargo models , as well as the convertible 757 @-@ 200M variant . The stretched 757 @-@ 300 was only available as a passenger model . When referring to different versions , Boeing and airlines have been known to collapse the model number ( 757 ) and the variant designator ( e.g. -200 or -300 ) into a truncated form ( e.g. " 752 " or " 753 " ) . The International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) classifies all variants based on the 757 @-@ 200 under the code " <unk> " , while the 757 @-@ 300 is referred to as " <unk> . " 
 = = = 757 @-@ 200 = = = 
 The 757 @-@ 200 , the original version of the aircraft , entered service with Eastern Air Lines in 1983 . The type was produced with two different door configurations , both with three standard cabin doors per side : the baseline version has a fourth , smaller cabin door on each side aft of the wings , and is certified for a maximum capacity of 239 , while the alternate version has a pair of over @-@ the @-@ wing emergency exits on each side , and can seat a maximum of 224 . The 757 @-@ 200 was offered with a MTOW of up to 255 @,@ 000 pounds ( 116 @,@ 000 kg ) ; some airlines and publications have referred to higher gross weight versions with ETOPS certification as " 757 @-@ 200ERs " , but this designation is not used by the manufacturer . Similarly , versions with winglets are sometimes called " 757 @-@ <unk> " or " 757 @-@ <unk> " . The first engine to power the 757 @-@ 200 , the Rolls @-@ Royce RB211 @-@ 535C , was succeeded by the upgraded RB211 @-@ <unk> in October 1984 . Other engines used include the RB211 @-@ 535E4B , along with the PW2037 and <unk> from Pratt & Whitney . Its range with full payload is 3 @,@ 850 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 130 km ) . 
 Although designed for short and medium length routes , the 757 @-@ 200 has since been used in a variety of roles ranging from high @-@ frequency shuttle services to transatlantic routes . In 1992 , after gaining ETOPS approval , American Trans Air launched 757 @-@ 200 transpacific services between Tucson and Honolulu . Since the turn of the century , mainline U.S. carriers have increasingly deployed the type on transatlantic routes to Europe , and particularly to smaller cities where passenger volumes are unable to support wide @-@ body aircraft . Production for the 757 @-@ 200 totaled 913 aircraft , making the type by far the most popular 757 model . In July 2015 , 683 of different 757 @-@ 200 versions were in service . The longest commercial route served by a 757 is United Airlines ' New York to Berlin flight at over 4 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 410 km ) as of February 2015 ; the aircraft assigned to this route cannot fly with full payload . United 's 757s assigned to transatlantic routes are fitted with 169 seats . 
 = = = 757 @-@ 200PF = = = 
 The 757 @-@ 200PF , the production cargo version of the 757 @-@ 200 , entered service with UPS Airlines in 1987 . Targeted at the overnight package delivery market , the freighter can carry up to 15 containers or pallets on its main deck , for a volume of up to 6 @,@ 600 cubic feet ( 187 m3 ) , while its two lower holds can carry up to 1 @,@ 830 cubic feet ( 51 @.@ 8 m3 ) of bulk cargo . The maximum revenue payload capability is 87 @,@ 700 pounds ( 39 @,@ 800 kg ) including container weight . The 757 @-@ 200PF is specified with a MTOW of 255 @,@ 000 pounds ( 116 @,@ 000 kg ) for maximal range performance ; when fully loaded , the aircraft can fly up to 3 @,@ 150 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 830 km ) . Because the freighter does not carry any passengers , it can operate transatlantic flights free of ETOPS restrictions . Power is provided by RB211 @-@ 535E4B engines from Rolls @-@ Royce , or PW2037 and <unk> engines from Pratt & Whitney . 
 The freighter features a large , upward @-@ opening main deck cargo door on its forward port @-@ side fuselage . Adjacent to the large cargo door is a standard exit door used by the pilots . All other emergency exits are omitted , and cabin windows and passenger amenities are not available . The main deck cargo hold has a smooth fiberglass lining , and a fixed rigid barrier with a sliding access door serves as a restraint wall next to the flight deck . Both lower holds can be equipped with a telescoping baggage system to load custom @-@ fitted cargo modules . When equipped for extended @-@ range transatlantic operations , UPS 757 @-@ <unk> feature an upgraded auxiliary power unit , additional cargo bay fire suppression equipment , enhanced avionics , and an optional supplemental fuel tank in the aft lower hold . Total production for the 757 @-@ 200PF totaled 80 aircraft . In July 2015 , 79 of these were in service . 
 = = = 757 @-@ 200M = = = 
 The 757 @-@ 200M , a convertible version capable of carrying cargo and passengers on its main deck , entered service with Royal Nepal Airlines in 1988 . Also known as the 757 @-@ 200 Combi , the type retains the passenger windows and cabin doors of the 757 @-@ 200 , while adding a forward port @-@ side cargo door in the manner of the 757 @-@ 200PF . Kathmandu @-@ based Royal Nepal Airlines , later renamed Nepal Airlines , included the convertible model as part of an order for two 757s in 1986 . 
 Nepal Airlines ordered the 757 @-@ 200M to fulfill a requirement for an aircraft that could carry mixed passenger and freight loads , and operate out of <unk> International Airport in the foothills of the Himalayas . Patterned after convertible variants of the 737 and 747 , the 757 @-@ 200M can carry two to four cargo pallets on its main deck , along with 123 to 148 passengers in the remaining cabin space . Nepal Airlines ' 757 @-@ 200M , which features Rolls @-@ Royce RB211 @-@ <unk> engines and an increased MTOW of 240 @,@ 000 pounds ( 109 @,@ 000 kg ) , was the only production example ever ordered . 
 In October 2010 , Pemco World Air Services and Precision Conversions launched aftermarket conversion programs to modify 757 @-@ 200s into 757 Combi aircraft . Vision Technologies Systems launched a similar program in December 2011 . All three aftermarket conversions modify the forward portion of the aircraft to provide room for up to ten cargo pallets , while leaving the remaining space to fit around 45 to 58 passenger seats . This configuration is targeted at commercial charter flights which transport heavy equipment and personnel simultaneously . Customers for converted 757 Combi aircraft include the Air Transport Services Group , National Airlines , and North American Airlines . 
 = = = 757 @-@ 200SF = = = 
 The 757 @-@ 200SF , a conversion of passenger 757 @-@ 200s for cargo use , entered service with DHL Aviation in 2001 . Modifications by Boeing Wichita in Kansas included the removal of passenger amenities , main deck structural reinforcement , and the installation of a 757 @-@ 200PF forward fuselage section with a port @-@ side cargo door . The forward two entry doors are retained , resulting in a main deck cargo capacity of 14 pallets , which is one less than the 757 @-@ 200PF . Environmental controls can be fitted for animal cargo , and rear exits and window pairs are retained on some aircraft . Besides Boeing , Israel Aerospace Industries , Precision Conversions , and ST Aerospace Services have also handled 757 @-@ 200SF conversions . In September 2006 , FedEx Express announced a US $ 2 @.@ 6 billion plan to acquire over 80 converted 757 freighters to replace its 727 fleet . In July 2015 , 173 converted 757 @-@ <unk> were in service .

 The 757 @-@ 300 , the stretched version of the aircraft , entered service with Condor in 1999 . With an overall length of 178 @.@ 7 feet ( 54 @.@ 5 m ) , the type is the longest single @-@ aisle twinjet ever built . Designed to serve the charter airline market and provide a low @-@ cost replacement for the 767 @-@ 200 , the 757 @-@ 300 shares the basic design of the original 757 , while extending the fuselage before and after the wings . Eight standard cabin doors , plus a pair of over @-@ the @-@ wing emergency exits on each side , enable the 757 @-@ 300 to have a maximum certified capacity of 295 passengers A higher MTOW of 272 @,@ 500 pounds ( 124 @,@ 000 kg ) is specified , while fuel capacity remains unchanged ; as a result , the stretched variant offers a maximum range of 3 @,@ 395 nautical miles ( 6 @,@ 290 km ) . Engines used on the type include the RB211 @-@ 535E4B from Rolls @-@ Royce and the <unk> from Pratt & Whitney . Due to its greater length , the 757 @-@ 300 features a retractable tailskid on its aft fuselage . 
 Condor ordered the stretched 757 to replace its McDonnell Douglas DC @-@ 10s and serve as low @-@ cost , high @-@ density transportation to holiday destinations such as the Canary Islands . Because tests showed that boarding the 757 @-@ 300 could take up to eight minutes longer than the 757 @-@ 200 , Boeing and Condor developed zone @-@ based boarding procedures to expedite loading and unloading times for the lengthened aircraft . The 757 @-@ 300 has been operated by mainline carriers Continental Airlines ( now part of United Airlines ) , Northwest Airlines ( now part of Delta Air Lines ) , and Icelandair ; other operators have included American Trans Air ( the first North American operator ) , Arkia Israel Airlines , along with charter carriers Condor and Thomas Cook Airlines . Production for the 757 @-@ 300 totaled 55 aircraft . All 55 were in service in July 2015 . 
 = = = Government , military , and corporate = = = 
 Government , military , and private customers have acquired the 757 for uses ranging from aeronautical testing and research to cargo and VIP transport . The 757 @-@ 200 , the most widely ordered version of the aircraft , has formed the basis for these applications . The first government operator of the 757 was the Mexican Air Force , which took delivery of a VIP @-@ configured 757 @-@ 200 in November 1987 . 
 Airborne Research Integrated Experiments System – ARIES , a NASA platform for air safety and operational research , was created in 1999 using the second production 757 . The aircraft originally flew in the 757 flight test program before entering service with Eastern Air Lines . After NASA purchased the aircraft in 1994 to replace its 737 @-@ 100 testbed , it was initially used to evaluate a hybrid laminar flow control system , avionics systems for the proposed Northrop YF @-@ 23 jet fighter , and the 777 's fly @-@ by @-@ wire control system . Equipped with a flight deck research station , on @-@ board laboratories , and two experimental flight decks , ARIES was used for evaluating weather information and landing approach systems , as well as runway friction tests . ARIES went into storage in 2006 . 
 C @-@ 32 – the United States Air Force ( USAF ) operates four VIP @-@ configured 757 @-@ 200s under the designation C @-@ 32A , with missions including the transport of the Vice President of the United States under the callsign Air Force Two . The C @-@ <unk> are outfitted with a communication center , conference room , seating area , and private living quarters . The USAF also operates two 45 @-@ seat 757 @-@ 200 aircraft , designated C @-@ 32B , for use by the U.S. State Department Foreign Emergency Support Team . The C @-@ <unk> feature the blue @-@ and @-@ white paint scheme used by the USAF for its VIP transport fleet , while the C @-@ <unk> are painted in solid white with minimal identification markings . The first C @-@ 32s were delivered in 1998 and replaced C @-@ 137 transports . 
 F @-@ 22 Flying Testbed – the first 757 built was used in 1998 as a testbed for Lockheed Martin F @-@ 22 Raptor avionics and sensor integration . The Boeing @-@ owned aircraft was fitted with a canard above its cockpit to simulate the jet fighter 's wing sensor layout , along with a forward F @-@ 22 fuselage section with radar and other systems , and a 30 @-@ seat laboratory with communication , electronic warfare , identification , and navigation sensors . 
 Krueger flap and Natural <unk> Flow Insect Mitigation Test Program – Boeing commenced a series of test flights on 17 March 2015 with a modified Boeing 757 , incorporating new wing @-@ leading @-@ edge sections and an actively blown vertical tail . The left wing has been modified to include a 6 @.@ 7 m @-@ span glove section supporting a variable @-@ camber Krueger flap which will be deployed during landing and which protrudes just ahead of the leading edge . Although Krueger flaps have been tried before as insect @-@ mitigation screens , previous designs caused additional drag ; the newer design being tested is variable @-@ camber and designed to retract as seamlessly as possible into the lower wing surface . Increasing the use of natural laminar flow ( NLF ) on an aircraft wing has the potential to improve fuel burn by as much as 15 % , but even small contaminants from insect remains will trip the flow from laminar to turbulent , destroying the performance benefit . The test flights have been supported by the European airline group <unk> AG and conducted jointly with NASA as part of the agency ’ s Environmentally Responsible Aviation ( ERA ) program . While the left wing tests the Kreuger flaps , the right wing is being used to test coatings that prevent insects from adhering to the wing . Success here will open the door to the application of Natural <unk> Flow to reduce fuel burn . 
 Active Flow Control System – Boeing has mounted 31 active flow jets mounted ahead of the rudder 's leading edge . They receive air from the Auxiliary Power Unit ( APU ) . Their purpose is to recover air flow that has separated from the rudder and redirect it to the rudder so that the rudder regains effectiveness , even at high deflection angles . The air exiting the APU is very hot , at 380 degrees F , and is cooled by a heat exchanger mounted under the aft fuselage , which is connected to the ducts running along the front and back of the stabilizer 's spars . This ensures an even air supply at all times . 
 Royal New Zealand Air Force 757 Combi – the Royal New Zealand Air Force ( RNZAF ) operates two 757s converted to 757 @-@ 200M standard by ST Aerospace Services for delivering equipment , medical evacuation , troop movements , and VIP transport . A cargo door , upgraded auxiliary power unit , enhanced communications systems , and retractable <unk> are fitted . The aircraft , which replaced two 727 @-@ <unk> , have carried the Prime Minister of New Zealand , and flown to the ice @-@ covered Pegasus Field near New Zealand 's Scott Base in McMurdo Sound , Antarctica . 
 VIP transport – the 757 @-@ 200 serves as VIP transports for the President of Argentina under the Presidential Air Group serial Tango 01 and for the President of Mexico under the Mexican Air Force call sign <unk> or Transporte <unk> 1 . A Royal Brunei Airlines 757 @-@ 200 was used by the Sultan of Brunei in the 1980s before being sold to the Government of Kazakhstan in 1995 . The royal family of Saudi Arabia uses a 757 @-@ 200 as a flying hospital . 
 During the 2004 U.S. presidential election , Senator John Kerry chartered a 757 @-@ 200 from <unk> Airlines nicknamed " Freedom Bird " as his campaign jet . During the 2008 U.S. presidential election , then @-@ Senator Barack Obama chartered a 757 @-@ 200 from North American Airlines for the same purpose . In 2008 , British heavy metal band Iron Maiden chartered and customized a 757 ( nicknamed " Ed Force One " , and of which singer Bruce Dickinson was the pilot ) for their " Somewhere Back in Time World Tour " . Since the 2000s , Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban has used his personal 757 @-@ 200 to transport team members between games .

 The largest 757 operators are Delta Air Lines , FedEx Express and United Airlines ; Delta Air Lines is the largest overall , with a 757 fleet of 138 aircraft as of 2015 . American Airlines ' 757 fleet of 142 aircraft was the largest until 2007 , when the carrier retired Pratt & Whitney PW2000 @-@ powered models acquired from TWA in order to standardize around a Rolls @-@ Royce RB211 @-@ powered fleet . Delta subsequently acquired 17 former American Airlines 757s , and in October 2008 gained 45 more 757s from its merger with Northwest Airlines . 
 The cargo carrier with the most 757s is FedEx Express , which operated a 757 @-@ 200SF fleet of 96 aircraft in July 2015 . The largest operator of the 757 @-@ 200PF is UPS Airlines , with 75 aircraft in July 2015 . DHL Aviation and its affiliated companies , DHL Air UK , DHL Latin America , European Air Transport Leipzig , and Blue Dart Aviation , combined operate 43 cargo 757s of various types in 2015 . 
 Joint launch customer British Airways operated the 757 @-@ 200 for 27 years before retiring the type in November 2010 . To celebrate the fleet 's retirement , the airline unveiled one of its last three 757 @-@ 200s in a retro style livery on October 4 , 2010 , matching the color scheme that it introduced the aircraft into service with in 1983 . Subsequently , the type remained in operation with the company 's subsidiary , OpenSkies .

American Airlines Flight 965 was blamed on navigational errors by the crew , while DHL Flight 611 involved air traffic control errors . Accidents attributed to pilot disorientation due to improperly maintained instruments include Birgenair Flight 301 on February 6 , 1996 , in Puerto Plata , Dominican Republic , with the loss of all 189 passengers and crew , and Aeroperú Flight 603 on October 2 , 1996 , off the coast of <unk> , Peru , with the loss of all 70 on board . In the Birgenair accident , investigators found that the aircraft had been stored without the necessary covers for its pitot tube sensors , thus allowing insects and debris to collect within , while in the Aeroperú accident , protective tape covering static vent sensors had not been removed . 
 Two private aircraft crashes were blamed on wake turbulence emanating from 757s . On December 18 , 1992 , a Cessna Citation crashed near Billings Logan International Airport in Montana , killing all six aboard , and on December 15 , 1993 , an IAI <unk> crashed near John Wayne Airport in California , killing all five aboard . Both airplanes had been flying less than three nautical miles ( 5 @.@ 56 km ) behind a 757 . The FAA subsequently increased the required separation between small aircraft and 757s from four to five nautical miles ( 7 @.@ 41 to 9 @.@ 26 km ) . 
 On September 14 , 1999 , Britannia Airways Flight <unk> crash landed near Girona @-@ Costa Brava Airport , Spain , during a thunderstorm ; the 757 's fuselage broke into several pieces .

 = Bruce Davidson ( equestrian ) = 
 Bruce Oram Davidson ( born December 31 , 1949 , in Rome , New York ) is an American equestrian who competes in the sport of eventing . He grew up in a family uninterested in horses , but began to compete in Pony Club events after a family friend introduced him to riding . He began college at Iowa State University , but left in his third year to train full @-@ time with the United States Equestrian Team . In 1974 he married , and his two children were born in 1976 and 1977 . His son , Bruce Davidson , Jr . , has followed in his footsteps to become a top eventing rider . 
 At 18 , Davidson tried out for the United States eventing team and was accepted . He won his first medal as a member of the silver @-@ medal @-@ winning US team at the 1972 Summer Olympics . After that , Davidson went to win gold at the 1976 and 1984 Olympics and silver in 1996 , participating unsuccessfully in 1988 . He has also competed repeatedly at both the World Equestrian Games and the Pan American Games , winning medals at both , as well as winning repeatedly at the top @-@ level Badminton Horse Trials and Rolex Kentucky Three Day events . In the 1980s and early 1990s , Davidson was a consistently top @-@ level rider on both the American and international eventing scenes . He is also known for his horse breeding and training abilities . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 In 1949 , Davidson was born to Francis and Annette Davidson , the former a businessman and the latter a concert pianist . He was the third of four children , and had little opportunity to be around horses until his family moved to Westport , Massachusetts , when he was a child . A family friend introduced Davidson to horses , and he began attending Pony Club events . He bought , trained and sold horses until he found a championship horse in Irish Cap , the horse that took him to his first gold medal at the 1974 World Eventing Championship . Davidson went to college at Iowa State University with a veterinary major , but left in his third year to train with the United States Equestrian Team ( USET ) . 
 In 1974 , Davidson married Carol Hannum , a top rider and daughter of Nancy Hannum , who owns extensive property in Pennsylvania surrounding Davidson 's <unk> Farm . In 1976 , Davidson 's son , Bruce " Buck " Oram Davidson , Jr . , was born , followed by a daughter , Nancy Fraser Davidson , in 1977 . In 2006 , Davidson 's first grandson , Oram , was born to Nancy . Buck Davidson is also an internationally competitive event rider , competing in high @-@ level events such as the Rolex Kentucky Three Day along with his father . 
 In 2002 , at a competition in Massachusetts , Davidson 's horse suffered a fall in a freak accident . The horse , High Scope , broke his neck and died instantly , while Davidson was taken to the intensive care unit at Massachusetts Memorial Hospital . After being treated for injuries , Davidson was released . In 2010 , Davidson missed that year 's Rolex Three Day Event in Kentucky after undergoing surgery to repair herniated discs in his back .

 At 18 , Davidson participated in a tryout for aspiring eventers run by Neil Ayer and Jack le Goff , who were trying to build the United States team to an international level . He had talent , and according to <unk> , " He didn 't know which diagonal he was posting when he came to me . Two years later , he was riding in the Olympics . " Davidson was chosen , and began training with the USET in a four @-@ year , seven @-@ day @-@ a @-@ week program in Gladstone , New Jersey . 
 Davidson won team eventing medals at Olympic Games in 1972 , 1976 , 1984 and 1996 , and also competed at the 1988 Games . In the 1972 Games , at age 22 , he took individual eighth , while the American team won silver . At the 1976 Summer Olympics , the team won gold while Davidson came in tenth individually . In 1984 , Davidson , who finished 13th individually , was the lowest scoring member of the gold @-@ medal @-@ winning United States team . At the 1988 Games , Davidson took 18th , while the American team did not finish the competition . In 1996 , Davidson did not compete as an individual , but the American team again took silver . 
 Outside of the Olympics , Davidson also competed repeatedly at the Eventing World Championships and the Pan @-@ American Games . He took both an individual and a team gold at the 1974 World Championships , and another individual gold at the 1978 Championships . Davidson 's victory at the 1974 Championships aboard Irish Cap made him the first American ever to win the event , and his win in 1978 aboard Might Tango made him the first rider of any nationality to win back @-@ to @-@ back championships . In this event , the inexperienced Might Tango was Davidson 's backup horse after Irish Cap went lame , leading to a scenario which Sports Illustrated likened to " a junior high school quarterback leading USC to victory in the Rose Bowl " . Might Tango 's inexperience led to increased tiredness and rumors that the activity made him go into shock , but Davidson replied that the horse was just " very tired " and praised him for his stamina . The United States also took a team bronze at the 1978 championships . In 1990 , Davidson took an individual bronze at the World Championships in Stockholm , Sweden . In 1998 , Davidson competed at the World Equestrian Games in Rome , where he took an individual 21st place , as well as helping the US to a team 4th . 
 At the 1975 Pan American Games , he took both the individual and the team silver ; he followed this up by an individual gold and a team silver at the 1995 Games . 
 He has also ridden at the Badminton Horse Trials , where he is one of only two Americans to win that event , and he also holds the honor of having the most wins at the Rolex Three Day Event with six victories . Through his 1974 World Championship victory , Davidson is credited with helping to create the Rolex event , as this victory allowed the US to host the 1978 World Championships . The 1978 event turned into an annual competition that eventually became the Rolex Kentucky Three @-@ Day , which was the first and continues to be the only four @-@ star eventing competition in the United States . Davidson has competed at the event almost every year since it began . 
 In 1993 and 1995 , Davidson held the top place in the world eventing rankings compiled by the FEI , and between 1980 and 1995 , he was annually named the leading rider for the United States Eventing Association . 
 = = = Other = = = 
 In 2002 , Davidson was named as one of the 50 most influential horsemen of the 20th century by the equine magazine The Chronicle of the Horse . In 2009 , Davidson was inducted to the United States Eventing Association Hall of Fame , along with his horse Irish Cap . In 2003 , another horse ridden by Davidson , Plain Sailing , had also been inducted . 
 Davidson is also known for his success in finding and training the horses that he rides at the international level . Irish Cap was purchased at the age of five years , JJ Babu and Dr. Peaches as yearlings and Might Tango as a two @-@ year @-@ old ex @-@ racehorse – all ended as championship horses . He is currently a Thoroughbred breeder , and at his <unk> Farm he says that " the ultimate in the sport is to breed , train and win , to carry the whole system right on through . " 
 = Typhoon Dujuan ( 2003 ) = 
 Typhoon Dujuan , known in the Philippines as Typhoon <unk> , was the strongest tropical cyclone to strike the Pearl River delta since Typhoon Hope in 1979 . The 13th storm and 7th typhoon of the 2003 Pacific typhoon season , Dujuan developed on August 27 to the east of Taiwan . It initially moved to the northwest , slowly intensifying into a tropical storm while drawing moisture and rainfall over the Philippines . On the island of Luzon , one person was killed and areas were flooded . Dujuan quickly intensified after turning and moving quicker to the west @-@ northwest , developing an eye . It reached peak winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) on September 1 , and shortly thereafter passed just south of Taiwan . There , Dujuan left 590 @,@ 000 people without power , killed three , and caused NT $ 200 million ( <unk> , $ 115 million USD ) in crop damage . While moving through the South China Sea , the typhoon developed concentric eyewalls . Dujuan weakened to severe tropical storm status before making landfall on September 2 in southern China , just east of Hong Kong near Shenzhen , Guangdong . The storm dissipated the next day after causing 40 deaths and ¥ 2 @.@ 3 billion ( CNY , $ 277 million USD ) in damage . Most of the deaths were in Shenzhen where the storm moved ashore , and the city experienced a near @-@ total power outage . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On August 25 , an area of convection persisted on satellite imagery on August 25 . The thunderstorms pulsed and became better organized by August 27 . That day , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) estimated that a tropical depression formed southeast of the Japanese island of Okinotorishima , or about 520 km ( 325 mi ) northwest of Guam . The Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) also estimated a tropical cyclone formed on August 27 . With a ridge to the north , the depression tracked slowly to the southwest . The system gradually organized while developing improved outflow to the south , although a tropical upper tropospheric trough to the north caused wind shear . On August 29 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Dujuan , although the JTWC had upgraded a day prior . That day , the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) began issuing advisories as the storm approached the region , naming it <unk> . 
 Shortly after it was named , Dujuan quickly intensified after an upper level low to the northwest improved outflow to the north . On August 30 , the ridge to the north built eastward , causing the storm to slow and turn more to the northwest . That day , an eye developed in center , and the JMA upgraded Dujuan to typhoon status . Subsequently , the typhoon accelerated to the west @-@ northwest and later to the west . On September 1 , the JMA estimated Dujuan attained peak 10 – minute sustained winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) . Around the same time , the JTWC assessed peak 1 – minute winds of 230 km / h ( 145 mph ) , making it the equivalent of a Category 4 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane wind scale . While near peak intensity , the center of Dujuan passed about 45 km ( 30 mi ) south of the southern tip of Taiwan . While moving westward through the South China Sea , the typhoon weakened slightly after its peak intensity due to an eyewall replacement cycle . Radar from the Hong Kong Observatory indicated an inner eye about 20 km ( 12 mi ) in diameter , and an outer eye about 100 km ( 60 mi ) in diameter . At around 1200 UTC on September 2 , Dujuan made landfall just east of Hong Kong , near Shenzhen . The JMA estimated the typhoon had weakened into a severe tropical storm by the time of landfall , while the JTWC estimated winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . It was considered the strongest typhoon to strike the Pearl River Delta since Typhoon Hope in 1979 . Dujuan rapidly weakened while continuing westward through China , dissipating on September 3 over Guangxi . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Although the center passed north of Luzon in the Philippines , Dujuan interacted with the monsoon to produce heavy rainfall over the country . Flash flooding in Metro Manila covered roads , causing traffic jams . Dangerous conditions caused many schools to close . The typhoon destroyed one house , and one person was killed in the country . While in the vicinity , Dujuan produced gusts of 100 km / h ( 62 mph ) on Yonaguni , a Japanese subdivision of Okinawa . Strong winds and high waves disrupted marine and airline traffic , with two flights canceled . Rainfall on Okinawa reached about 18 mm ( 0 @.@ 71 in ) . 
 On August 31 , officials in Taiwan issued a sea warning , advising for boats to avoid the Bashi Channel . Schools in southern Taiwan were closed , and transport was disrupted . The Ministry of National Defense canceled a military exercise due to the storm . In Taiwan , the typhoon dropped heavy rainfall that reached 628 mm ( 24 @.@ 7 in ) in Pingtung County , and several other locations reported over 200 mm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) . Sustained winds reached 176 km / h ( 109 mph ) on Orchid Island offshore southeastern Taiwan , where gale force winds were recorded for 13 hours and gusts reached 271 km / h ( 168 mph ) . The typhoon was so strong that it destroyed the anemometer there . On the island of Taiwan , winds peaked at 87 km / h ( 54 mph ) at <unk> , while gusts peaked at 184 km / h ( 114 mph ) in a mountainous region of Nantou County . The typhoon left about 590 @,@ 000 people without power at some point on the island . Transport was disrupted , and there was about NT $ 200 million ( TWD , $ 115 million USD ) . Dujuan killed three people and injured eight in southern Taiwan ; one was a drowning in the Penghu islands , and another occurred when a man was blown out of his window in Taipei . 
 Before Dujuan made its final landfall , the Hong Kong Observatory initially issued a standby warning signal , and eventually raised it to a number 9 signal , the second @-@ highest out of 10 , for the first time since Typhoon York in 1999 . The threat of the storm caused 360 flights to be canceled or delayed at Hong Kong International Airport , and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange was closed . Officials opened 27 shelters for residents , housing over 120 people . Winds in the territory briefly reached typhoon status , or 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) , at Lau <unk> Shan . Rainfall reached over 90 mm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) on Lantau Island . Dujuan caused minor flooding and two small landslides In Hong Kong , the typhoon knocked down 85 trees and caused a power outage affecting 300 people in Yuen Long . Dujuan injured 24 people in the territory , and four fishermen were missing and presumed drowned after their boat sank . Despite the close passage , damage was minor in Hong Kong . During the height of the storm , three people stole $ 1 @.@ 3 million ( USD ) worth of jewelry , watches , and clothing from a store . 
 On the Chinese mainland , Dujuan produced 183 mm ( 7 @.@ 2 in ) of rainfall in <unk> in Guangdong , of which 131 mm ( 5 @.@ 2 in ) fell in 24 hours . In Fujian province , winds reached 144 km / h ( 90 mph ) in Quanzhou , and in Guangdong , winds peaked at 179 km / h ( 112 mph ) in Shenzhen . In <unk> near where Dujuan made landfall , 90 % of residents lost power , after strong winds knocked down power lines , although it was quickly restored . Also in the city , 20 people were killed , 16 of whom due to the collapse of a half @-@ finished building that they were constructing . Officials had opened 272 emergency shelters before the storm 's arrival , housing 4 @,@ 950 people . In Huizhou , nine people were killed , and another three people died in Shanwei from the storm .

 = Clara Clemens = 
 Clara Langhorne Clemens Samossoud , formerly Clara Langhorne Clemens Gabrilowitsch ( June 8 , 1874 – November 19 , 1962 ) , was the daughter of Samuel Clemens , who wrote as Mark Twain . She was a contralto concert singer and , as her father 's only surviving child , managed his estate and guarded his legacy after his death . She was married twice — first to Ossip Gabrilowitsch , then ( after Gabrilowitsch 's death ) to Jacques Samossoud . She wrote biographies of Gabrilowitsch and of her father . In her later life she became a Christian Scientist .

 Clara was the second of three daughters born to Samuel Clemens and his wife Olivia Langdon Clemens in Elmira , New York . Her older sister , Susy , died when Clara was 22 . Her only brother , Langdon , died as an infant before she was born . Her younger sister was Jean . Clara had a serious accident as a child , while riding a toboggan she ended up being hurled into a great oak tree . This resulted in a severe leg injury that almost led to amputation . 
 = = Early career = = 
 She spent the period from September 1897 to May 1899 living in Vienna with her parents . While there , she cultivated her voice for the purpose of going on the concert stage . Her voice was characterized as unusually sweet and attractive . She also studied piano in 1899 under Teodor <unk> . In December 1900 , she was invited by the people of Hartford to perform at a grand concert given by the Boston Symphony Orchestra . She studied for several years under masters in Europe , before making her professional debut in Florence . Her American debut , assisted by violinist Marie Nichols , as a contralto concert singer was on the evening of September 22 , 1906 at the Norfolk <unk> in Norfolk , Connecticut where in 1905 she rented Edgewood , Clemens used the proceeds from the concert to purchase a memorial window for her mother in the Norfolk Church of the Transfiguration , Episcopal . Charles Edmund " Will " Wark ( 1876 @-@ 1954 ) , a classical pianist originally from Cobourg , Ontario , Canada , became Clemens piano accompanist from the winter of 1906 to late in 1908 . Clemens and Nichols also continued to perform together , including a series of concerts in London and Paris in 1908 . On May 30 , Clemens debuted in London at a benefit concert , raising money for American girls to attend Oxford and Cambridge Universities .

 At 10 : 00am on December 20 , 1908 in Danbury , Clemens went for a sleigh ride with Russian concert pianist Ossip Gabrilowitsch who was staying with her father at his residence , Innocence at Home , in Redding . While passing through Redding Glen , the horse took fright at a wind @-@ whipped newspaper and bolted with driver Gabrilowitsch losing control . At the top of a hill , next to a 60 @-@ foot ( 18 m ) drop , the sleigh overturned , throwing Clemens out . Gabrilowitsch leaped to the ground and caught the horse by the head , stopping it as it was about to plunge over the bank , dragging Clemens with her dress caught in a runner . Having only sprained his right ankle , Gabrilowitsch returned Clemens to home , unharmed except for the shock of the accident . Twain biographer Michael Shelden doubted the truth of this heroic tale and supplied a motive for why the story might have been planted in the press , namely , to quiet rumors that Clara was having an affair with Charles E. Wark , her former accompanist , a married man . 
 Clemens had been introduced to Gabrilowitsch in 1899 in Vienna by Theodor <unk> who was also training Gabrilowitsch . At noon on October 6 , 1909 , she subsequently married Gabrilowitsch in the drawing room at <unk> , the Clemens home with Rev. Dr. Joseph H. Twitchell presiding . ( Twitchell was a great friend of her father . ) Her father said that the engagement was not new , having been " made and dissolved twice six years ago . " He also said that the marriage was sudden because Gabrilowitsch had just recovered from a surgical operation he had undergone in the summer and they were about to head off to their new house in Berlin where he would begin his European season . Her sister , Jean Clemens , drowned in the bathtub on December 24 , 1909 after having an epileptic seizure . On April 21 , 1910 , her father died and left his entire estate to her in a will dated August 17 , 1909 which provided for quarterly payments of interest to keep it " free from any control or interference from any husband she may have . " On July 9 , she announced that she was giving practically the entire library of her father , comprising nearly 2 @,@ 500 books , to the Mark Twain Free Library . On August 19 , 1910 , her only child was born in Connecticut at <unk> . 
 Nina Gabrilowitsch ( 1910 @-@ 1966 ) , the last known lineal descendant of Mark Twain , died January 16 , 1966 in a Los Angeles hotel . She had been a heavy drinker , and bottles of pills and alcohol were found in her room .

 On April 23 , 1926 , she played the title role in a dramatization of Joan of Arc written by her father at Walter Hampden 's theater . This adaptation and her performance were not very well received by critics . It was again produced in 1927 , opening on April 12 and for a series of special morning and afternoon performances at the <unk> Totten Theatre . 
 Gabrilowitsch was conductor of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra from 1918 until 1935 , when he fell ill . He entered the Henry Ford Hospital on March 25 , 1935 , where he stayed until September 28 , 1935 , at which point he was released to his home to convalesce . He subsequently died at his home on September 14 , 1936 , aged 58 . 
 On May 11 , 1944 , Clara and Jacques Samossoud , a Russian born symphony conductor 20 years her junior , were married in her Hollywood home . She died at age eighty @-@ eight in San Diego , California . 
 Clara explored eastern religions for a few years , and then eventually became a Christian Scientist , although there is some question as to her seriousness and commitment to it . She authored a book on the subject : Awake to a Perfect Day , published by Citadel Press , NYC , 1956 After originally objecting to the release of her father 's Letters from the Earth in 1939 , she changed her stance shortly before her death in 1962 and allowed them to be published . She also published biographies of both her father ( My Father , Mark Twain in 1931 ) and of her first husband ( My Husband : Gabrilowitsch in 1938 ) . 
 = Lindsay Hassett = 
 Arthur Lindsay Hassett MBE ( 28 August 1913 – 16 June 1993 ) was a cricketer who played for Victoria and Australia . The diminutive Hassett was an elegant middle @-@ order batsman , described by Wisden as , " ... a master of nearly every stroke ... his superb timing , nimble footwork and strong wrists enabled him to make batting look a simple matter " . His sporting career at school singled him out as a precocious talent , but he took a number of seasons to secure a regular place in first @-@ class cricket and initially struggled to make large scores . Selected for the 1938 tour of England with only one first @-@ class century to his name , Hassett established himself with three consecutive first @-@ class tons at the start of the campaign . Although he struggled in the Tests , he played a crucial role in Australia 's win in the Fourth Test , with a composed display in the run @-@ chase which sealed the retention of the Ashes . Upon returning to Australia , he distinguished himself in domestic cricket with a series of high scores , becoming the only player to score two centuries in a match against Bill O 'Reilly — widely regarded as the best bowler in the world . 
 However , the eruption of World War II interrupted Hassett 's progress . With first @-@ class cricket cancelled , he enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force , serving in the Middle East and New Guinea before being chosen to captain the Australian Services cricket team that played the " Victory Tests " in England during the months immediately following Victory in Europe Day . Hassett was the only capped Test player in the team and his men unexpectedly drew the series 2 – 2 against an English team consisting of Test cricketers . Hassett 's leadership was intrinsic to the success of the team , which toured and helped to re @-@ establish the game in England , India and Australia in the aftermath of the war . 
 At the advanced age of 32 , Hassett began his Test cricket career in earnest and became a more sedate , cautious player who often frustrated spectators with his slow scoring . From 1946 – 47 onwards , he served as Don Bradman 's vice @-@ captain for three series , including the Invincibles tour of England in 1948 . He then succeeded the retired Bradman as Australian captain in 1949 and presided over a successful team that gradually aged and declined . After an unbeaten tour of South Africa that saw a 4 – 0 triumph in the Tests , Hassett led the Australians to 4 – 1 home win over England in the 1950 @-@ 51 Ashes series . The solitary loss in the Fifth Test was the first Australian Test defeat since the resumption of cricket after World War II . Australia 's dominance of world cricket waned and , in Hassett 's final season at home in 1952 – 53 , it drew 2 – 2 against a South African team that was expected to be weak opposition . In 24 Test matches as captain , Hassett oversaw 14 wins and suffered defeat only four times , but it was the last of the four losses that blighted his record . Defeated in the last match of the 1953 series against England , Hassett 's team lost The Ashes , ending Australia 's 19 @-@ year ascendancy . At the age of 40 , he promptly retired following a final testimonial match after returning to Australia . A cheerful character with a poker face that aided his captaincy , Hassett was known for his ability as an ambassador for Australia , his sense of humour and diplomatic skills . Richie Benaud wrote of him : " There are others who have made more runs and taken more wickets , but very few have ever got more out of a lifetime . " 
 = = Early years = = 
 The youngest of nine children ( six boys and three girls ) , Hassett was born in Newtown , a suburb of Geelong , Victoria 's second @-@ largest city . His father Edward was a real estate agent who served as the secretary of the Geelong Permanent Building Society and was a keen club cricketer . The Hassett boys played three @-@ a @-@ side cricket matches in the backyard where Lindsay imitated his idol , the Test batsman Bill Ponsford . Along with two of his brothers , Lindsay attended Geelong College and made the First XI at the age of 14 . During his five years in the team , he amassed 2 @,@ 335 runs and was captain for three years . This total included an innings of 245 against Scotch College . In addition , he led the school 's football team for three seasons and won the Victorian Public Schools singles championship at tennis . An elder brother , Richard , played for Victoria in the early 1930s as a leg spinner . 
 While still at school , Hassett played for the South Melbourne First XI in Melbourne 's district cricket competition during the 1930 – 31 season . A month after his debut for South , he was selected for his first representative match ; batting for the Victorian Country XI against the touring West Indies team , he scored 147 not out . After being overlooked for further state honours for a season , he made his first @-@ class debut against South Australia in February 1933 , but his highest score in four innings for the season was 12 and he aggregated only 25 runs . He was overlooked for the entirety of the next two seasons . Recalled in 1935 – 36 , Hassett consolidated his place in the team through consistency rather than tall scores , scoring 212 runs at 30 @.@ 28 , including two fifties , 73 and 51 . 
 The following season , he led Victoria 's batting averages , scoring 503 runs at 71 @.@ 85 . Despite his success , Hassett was unable to register his maiden first @-@ class century , although he did manage seven consecutive fifties in nine innings for the season , including a 93 against Queensland and 83 against arch @-@ rivals New South Wales in a consistent run that helped Victoria to the Sheffield Shield title . 
 In 1937 – 38 , Hassett made 693 first @-@ class runs including a century and five fifties at an average of 53 @.@ 30 , including another 90 against Queensland . Despite having only one first @-@ class century to his name , 127 not out against the touring New Zealanders at the MCG in the first match of the season , he " scraped " into Australia 's team for the 1938 tour of England .

 Hassett allayed doubt about his selection when he began the tour with innings of 43 , 146 , 148 and 220 not out , against Worcestershire , Oxford University , Leicestershire and Cambridge University respectively as Australia won their first four matches by an innings . He added 57 and 98 in the next two matches against the Marylebone Cricket Club and Hampshire , and despite failing to pass 30 in the next four innings , he was selected to make his Test debut at Nottingham in the first match of the series . Hassett had an ignominious debut , scoring one and two in a high @-@ scoring draw in which almost 1 @,@ 500 runs were scored for the loss of only 24 wickets on a " batting paradise " . He maintained his county form between Tests , adding 118 against Lancashire before scoring his only half @-@ century in the Tests , adding 56 and 42 at Lord 's in the drawn Second Test . 
 The Third Test was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to rain , and Hassett prepared for what would be the decisive Fourth Test by scoring 94 and 127 in consecutive matches against Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire . The match at Headingley in Leeds was Australia 's only Test victory , which was enough to ensure a drawn series and the retention of The Ashes . In a low @-@ scoring match in a batsman @-@ friendly series , Australia , chasing a target of only 105 runs to win , had slumped to 3 / 50 when Hassett came to the crease as an approaching storm threatened to either end the game or make the pitch difficult to bat on . Hassett calmly hit 33 runs from 36 balls , to guide the tourists to a five @-@ wicket victory , much to the relief of his captain Don Bradman , who was so nervous about the outcome that he could not watch the play . The innings earned Hassett a reputation of being calm under pressure , and Bradman later wrote that Hassett was a " masterful player " in a crisis . 
 After the match @-@ winning innings , Hassett failed to pass 31 in his next six innings before Australia lost the Fifth Test by an innings and 579 runs , the heaviest defeat in Test history . He made 42 and 10 in the record @-@ breaking match , and added a pair of half @-@ centuries against Sussex thereafter . As he finished third in the batting averages for the tour , with 1 @,@ 589 runs at 52 @.@ 97 , and the dry summer resulted in pitches mostly favourable to batting , Wisden found his Test performances , in which he made 199 runs at 24 @.@ 88 , anomalous : 
 Hassett , adding together the runs he made and the runs he saved , was one of the most useful men on the side . He never quite fulfilled the promise of a sensational start ... He appeared to make his strokes very late and , although adopting almost a two @-@ eyed stance , had , so far as could be seen , no technical faults ... there was a good deal of surprise that he did not come off in the big matches although it must not be forgotten that his second innings at Leeds counted a lot in Australia 's victory . 
 = = Rivalry with O 'Reilly = = 
 Benefiting from his experience in England , Hassett scored five centuries in his nine matches for 1938 – 39 and finished second in the first @-@ class aggregates for the season . This included a run of seven matches in the middle of the season in which he scored five centuries and four fifties and ended the season with 967 runs at 74 @.@ 38 . He made 211 not out and 102 in two matches against South Australia , whose attack was led by Clarrie Grimmett , the world record holder for the most career Test wickets . Hassett also scored centuries in both matches against Queensland and another against Western Australia . In the first match against Queensland , he scored 104 in the first innings before adding 73 in the second innings to steer the Victorians to a narrow three @-@ wicket victory . 
 This period of Hassett ’ s career was notable for his battles with Australia 's leading Test bowler , Bill O 'Reilly , when the latter appeared for New South Wales ( NSW ) . O 'Reilly conceded that Hassett played his bowling better than any other batsman . Hassett 's method was predicated on counter @-@ attacking : whenever O 'Reilly bowled his famed wrong ' un , he could read this delivery in its flight ( whereas most other batsmen could not ) and he advanced down the pitch to hit the ball over the fielders on the leg side . The disparate <unk> and physiques of the two men accentuated their rivalry . Ray Robinson wrote that O 'Reilly , " ... towered nine inches above him ; it would have looked more apt for Hassett to sell him a newspaper than contend with his bowling . " The phlegmatic Hassett sometimes goaded the irascible O 'Reilly , which few batsmen were game to do . On one occasion , he repeatedly mis @-@ hit O 'Reilly 's bowling , prompting an irritated O 'Reilly to ask if he had a middle to his bat . Hassett replied , " I don 't need one with you , <unk> . " It was a long , defensive innings of 81 against NSW ( including O 'Reilly ) in 1937 that first brought Hassett to the attention of the national selectors . During an interval in the match , O 'Reilly told his teammates : " Nobody has ever kept me out like that little bastard . " 
 In the 1938 – 39 season , O ’ Reilly removed Hassett twice in three innings in matches between the two states . Their rivalry culminated in two encounters on the SCG at the conclusion of the 1939 – 40 season . The first , between Victoria and NSW , effectively decided the winner of the Sheffield Shield ; Victoria had won the first match between the two teams for the season . By scoring 122 in both innings , Hassett became the only player to score two centuries in a match against a team containing O 'Reilly . Nevertheless , NSW won the game and the shield , before playing against a Rest of Australia combination . Batting for the Rest of Australia , Hassett almost repeated his feat by making 136 and 75 , but this was not enough to stop NSW , who demonstrated their strength with another victory . Hassett had scored five half @-@ centuries in the five preceding matches of the season , including three in four innings against Grimmett ’ s South Australia , and ended the Australian summer with 897 runs at 74 @.@ 75 . He lost his wicket to O 'Reilly in a first @-@ class match only three times . 
 = = War years and the Services team = = 
 On 23 September 1940 , Hassett enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) ; despite his enlistment he remained active in cricket and played four first @-@ class matches in the following 1940 – 41 season , scoring 384 runs at 54 @.@ 86 including a century against South Australia , before his posting to the Middle East in early @-@ 1941 . As a member of the 2 / 2nd Heavy Anti @-@ Aircraft Regiment , attached to the Australian 7th Division , he was stationed at Haifa in the British Mandate of Palestine ( now Israel ) . During his time in the army , Hassett became popular among his colleagues because of his " blithe spirit " . He was offered a commission as an officer , but declined . Hassett maintained his connection to cricket by captaining an AIF team against service teams from other Empire countries serving in the region , playing matches in Egypt and Palestine . Following the outbreak of war in the Pacific , the Australian 6th and 7th Divisions were recalled to Australia . He married during his brief return to Melbourne in May 1942 , before his unit was deployed to Port Moresby in New Guinea to fight against Imperial Japan . 
 In 1945 , with the cessation of hostilities in Europe , Hassett was selected to lead the Australian Services cricket team on a tour of England . Officially a military unit , the team 's commanding officer was Squadron Leader Stan Sismey of the Royal Australian Air Force , although Hassett was the on @-@ field captain . They went on to play 64 matches in nine months of cricket in four countries . The focal point of the campaign was a series of matches against England known as the " Victory Tests " , which began in May . Australian cricket administrators would not accredit the three @-@ day matches as official Test matches , arguing that there were not enough Test @-@ level players among the servicemen ; Hassett was the only player who had Test experience , and only nine others had played first @-@ class cricket . As a result , Australia were not expected to be able to seriously challenge the hosts , who had many of their pre @-@ war Test players . 
 The Victory Tests were expected to usher in a new post @-@ war era , which it hoped would be more aggressive and attractive . The last Anglo @-@ Australian Test series before the war had featured a large number of draws due to defensive play . Australia unexpectedly drew the series 2 – 2 , and Hassett wrote at the end of the series that " This is cricket as it should be ... These games have shown that international cricket can be played as between real friends — so let 's have no more talk of " war " in cricket " . The series was regarded as an outstanding success , with a total attendance of 367 @,@ 000 watching the bright and attacking play . In the five Victory Tests , Hassett made 277 runs at 27 @.@ 70 , including two fifties . The Services and Australian Imperial Force teams played separate matches in England during the season , which lasted until September , although only one other Services match was given first @-@ class status . Hassett scored three centuries in matches for the Services . 
 Due to the unexpectedly strong success of the Victory Tests , the government of Australia ordered the team to delay their demobilisation . With the team raising so much money for war charities , the government directed them to travel home via India and Ceylon for further fundraising matches for the Red Cross . 
 Hassett enjoyed greater success on the Services tour of India , although the Australians had little to celebrate as a team . It was a tougher proposition for Hassett ’ s men , as all but one of the nine matches were against first @-@ class opposition , and many of the players regarded the local umpires as being deliberately biased in favour of the home teams . After arriving in October , conflict hit the team after a series of ineffective displays . The team , mostly made up of RAAF personnel , had been ill with food poisoning and dysentery , and travelled across the Indian subcontinent via long and bumpy train journeys for the first month . The airmen wanted to travel by air , and tried to ask Hassett and manager Keith Johnson for air travel . When this was refused , they threatened to abandon the tour or replace infantryman Hassett with either Keith Carmody or Keith Miller — who were RAAF fighter pilots — if their wish was not granted . With incumbent Australian captain Bradman likely to miss the upcoming tour of New Zealand , the Services leader would be one of the frontrunners for the national captaincy . Miller refused to plot against Hassett and the dispute ended when Sismey arranged for a RAAF plane already in India to transport the team ; after a month in India , their first flight came in late November . 
 In the opening match of the tour , a draw against North Zone , Hassett made 73 . In a high @-@ scoring match in hot conditions against the Prince 's XI in Delhi , he struck 187 and 124 not out in Australia 's 8 / 424 declared and 5 / 304 . The team was scheduled to play East Zone in Calcutta , but the city was gripped in deadly riots as independence activists agitated against British rule . Australia batted first and made only 107 , before East Zone replied with 131 . Led by Hassett 's 125 , Australia posted 304 to leave the hosts a target of 281 . On the final day , pro @-@ independence rioters broke through the security presence and invaded the pitch for the second time during the match , while East Zone were batting . East Zone batsman Denis Compton told the rioters to talk to Hassett , saying that the Australian skipper controlled proceedings . Hassett smiled at the leader of the irate demonstrators and asked " You wouldn 't happen to have a cigarette , would you , old boy ? " The rioters calmed down and play resumed . 
 Australia struggled in the three representative matches against India . Hassett made 53 in the first match in Mumbai , and although the Australians took a 192 @-@ run first innings lead , the hosts managed to hold on for a draw . The second match in Calcutta was an evenly @-@ contested draw , before India won the deciding match . Hassett top @-@ scored with 143 in Australia ’ s 339 , but the hosts took a first innings lead of 186 to set up a six @-@ wicket win . Hassett ended with 235 runs at 47 @.@ 00 in the three international matches , but did not taste victory in any of his seven matches on Indian soil . He scored 57 as Australia defeated Ceylon by an innings in Colombo before returning to Australia mid December . As time had passed , the players had become increasingly tired by the long campaign , and morale began to drop as waited for their return to their families and civilian life . 
 = = Post @-@ war career = = 
 Johnson 's team arrived in Australia late in 1945 , but the armed services and Australian Board of Control ordered them to play another series against the various Australian states . The fixtures were meant to revive cricket following the war and were also used as a lead @-@ up to the international tour to New Zealand in March 1946 . As a result , Hassett could not appear for Victoria during the 1945 – 46 season . The Services performed poorly ; after playing consecutive draws against Western Australia and South Australia , they were crushed by an innings by both Victoria and New South Wales , before drawing against Queensland and Tasmania , the smallest state . Hassett ’ s team was saved by the clock against Queensland when the time ran out with the hosts four runs short of their target , but their fortunes were reversed in the final match when Tasmania hung on with only one wicket in hand to salvage a draw . 
 Hassett ended the Australian summer with 312 runs at 39 @.@ 00 , including three fifties . During the entire Services campaign , he scored 1 @,@ 434 runs at 49 @.@ 44 in 18 first @-@ class matches and top @-@ scored for the Australians ’ whole campaign with 187 . His aggregate was only 13 behind that of all rounder Keith Miller . 
 Based on his form for the Services , Hassett was selected in the Australian team for a brief five @-@ match tour of New Zealand in February and March 1946 . As the military men played poorly in Australia , the national selectors concluded that their achievements against England must have been against weak opposition , and only Hassett and Miller were selected for the Australian tour of New Zealand . 
 Despite speculation that he would lead the team , as Bradman had made himself unavailable due to concerns over fitness and his ability to play at his pre @-@ war world @-@ leading standards , the Australian Board of Control appointed Bill Brown as captain and O 'Reilly as Brown 's deputy . In the Board 's ballot for the leadership positions , Hassett received only one of the 13 votes , although it was enough to make him the third on @-@ tour selector . One motive speculated for his being overlooked was that he had rested himself from the match against Victoria because he was tired of the long periods in the military away from his family and decided instead to spend the time in Melbourne with his wife and young daughter ; this supposedly drew the ire of the Victorian Cricket Association . 
 On the tour , Hassett made first @-@ class centuries against Auckland ( 121 ) and Wellington ( 143 ) and scored 19 in the one @-@ off match against New Zealand — retrospectively accredited as a Test — played at Basin Reserve in Wellington on a poor rain @-@ affected pitch that saw the contest finished within two days . The match ended in an easy victory for Australia when New Zealand was bowled out for 42 and 54 , but the tour attracted big crowds and made a record profit . Hassett scored 351 runs at 70 @.@ 20 for the whole tour . By the time he returned home from the tour , Hassett had played cricket continuously for almost twelve months . 
 = = = Sheet anchor role = = = 
 The following season , Hassett returned to serve his state and became Victorian captain for the first time . In the warm @-@ up matches ahead of the Tests , he hit 57 , 57 and 28 against the touring MCC team . He then scored 114 and 36 not out against South Australia in his last match before the beginning of the Ashes series . After a long deliberation , and against medical advice , the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Bradman decided to resume as Test captain . As Brown was injured and O 'Reilly had retired , Hassett was appointed vice @-@ captain . The First Test at Brisbane revealed a more circumspect Hassett . He made 128 ( from 395 balls in 392 minutes ) , his maiden Test century , and shared a 276 @-@ run partnership with Bradman , the cornerstone of Australia 's match @-@ winning score of 645 . Although the crowd continually barracked Hassett for his slow scoring , Ray Robinson felt that he played a crucial " anchoring " role in support of Bradman , who initially struggled with his timing , controversially survived an appeal for a catch by Jack Ikin , then limped through the latter stages of his innings with a strained muscle . Hassett later joked that one of his brothers had his wedding on the day , and was waiting for the batting to finish before starting the ceremony , but could wait no more and proceeded , only to come back after the marriage had been completed to find that just one run had been scored in the intervening period and that his brother was still only on 97 . 
 Australia went on to start the post @-@ war Ashes era with a crushing win by an innings and 332 runs . Hassett made 34 as Australia won the Second Test by an innings , and the Third Test was his first Test on his home ground at the MCG . He made only 12 and 9 as England held on for a draw with three wickets in hand . 
 Hassett 's other major innings of the series was 78 from 227 balls in the drawn Fourth Test at Adelaide . He added 189 runs with Arthur Morris after Australia , in reply to England 's first innings of 460 , were 2 / 18 . At one point , the umpire denied an appeal by Norman Yardley for lbw against Hassett , prompting a frustrated Neville Cardus to write , " ... he deserved to be [ given out ] ; the sight of a cricketer of his gifts continuing to deny his eye and technique in a Test match was enough to make any umpire go mad and , like the judge in Chesterton 's story , administer justice instead of law . " Hassett ended the Tests with 47 in the second innings as Australia stumbled to a five @-@ wicket win on a deteriorating and spinning pitch in the Fifth Test in Sydney , in pursuit of 214 . He finished the series with 332 runs at 47 @.@ 43 and had difficulty against the leg spinner Doug Wright , who dismissed him five times in seven innings . He had added 126 for Victoria against Wally Hammond ’ s Englishmen just a week earlier . 
 Despite his slow scoring in the Tests , Hassett was dynamic in the Shield matches for Victoria . In two matches for Victoria between the Third and Fourth Tests , Hassett hit 200 against Queensland and 190 against NSW ; in both innings he scored at a rate of almost 50 runs per hour . Victoria won both their matches against arch @-@ rivals NSW convincingly , by an innings and 288 runs respectively , and won the Sheffield Shield , having secured victory in each of the four matches that Hassett played in . Hassett was highly productive throughout the whole season , ending with 1 @,@ 213 runs at 71 @.@ 35 . 
 India embarked on its first tour of Australia in the summer of 1947 – 48 , and the hosts won the first series between the two countries 4 – 0 . After failing to pass 50 in the first two Tests , Hassett hit 80 in a rain @-@ affected Third Test win , and then his highest Test score , 198 not out in an innings win in the Fourth Test in Adelaide , finishing the series with 332 runs at 110 @.@ 67 . Hassett was rested from the Fifth and final Test as Australia sought to try out new players such as Sam Loxton ahead of the tour of England . He remained in strong form for Victoria , scoring 118 and 204 against South Australia and Queensland respectively , but his state were unable to retain their title , losing three and winning two matches when Hassett was available . He ended the season with 893 runs at 68 @.@ 69 . 
 = = = Invincibles tour = = = 
 Ten years after his first tour of England , Hassett was included in the 1948 team as Bradman 's deputy . Hassett was one of three on @-@ tour selectors along with Bradman and Arthur Morris . Considered one of the strongest Australia teams to tour England , the team became known as The Invincibles because it went undefeated through 34 matches , an unprecedented feat . As matches often started the day after the previous fixture , Australia employed a rotation policy and Hassett led the tourists in nine of the 34 matches while Bradman was rested . Under Hassett 's watch , Australia won seven matches , five of these by an innings , while both draws were rain @-@ affected fixtures in which more than half the playing time was lost . 
 Hassett had two close encounters as captain , both on damp pitches before the First Test when Australia 's unbeaten record was challenged . Against Yorkshire in the third match of the tour , Australia came the closest to losing for the entire tour . In a low @-@ scoring match in which neither team posted more than 101 , Australia was set 60 for victory , Hassett elected not to ask for the pitch to be rolled . Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Hassett " might have made an initial mistake in not having the pitch rolled because whenever there was rain about in England the heavy roller seemed to knock any nonsense [ erratic bounce and sideways movement ] out of the pitch " . Australia lost quick wickets and Hassett came in with the score at 2 / 5 . After being involved in a run out , he fell to leave Australia at 5 / 20 . Australia lost another wicket to be 6 / 31 , effectively seven down with Sam Loxton incapacitated by injury , but scraped hom without further loss after both batsmen at the crease were dropped . It would have been their first defeat against an English county since 1912 . In the 11th match of the tour against Hampshire , Australia ceded a first innings lead for the first time on tour . On a drying pitch , Australia were dismissed for 117 in reply to the home side 's 195 . Australia had made a solid start , before Hassett fell for 26 , sparking a collapse of 8 / 47 to be all out for 117 . Hampshire were then bowled out for 103 , leaving Australia a target of 182 , which they reached to seal an eight @-@ wicket win . 
 The two matches aside , Hassett had a productive lead @-@ in to the Tests , scoring 110 against Surrey and two fifties . One of these came in a match against the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) at Lord 's . The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests , and was basically a full @-@ strength Test team . It was a chance to gain a psychological advantage before the Tests . Australia batted first and Hassett made 51 in an innings win . Fingleton hailed Hassett 's display as " the prettiest half century we saw in the whole summer . There was not effort in his play . The ball sped quietly and quickly in all directions . " 
 In the First Test at Trent Bridge , Hassett came in on the second day with Australia at 4 / 185 in reply to England 's 165 . Australia had been scoring slowly due to England 's use of leg theory . Hassett almost holed out early when he edged a ball just wide of the wicket @-@ keeper . Hassett and Bradman were heckled for their slow batting but they remained unhurried in the face of England 's stifling tactics Australia had plenty of time after bowling out their opponents easily . Hassett had a period of 20 minutes without scoring . 
 Early on the third day , Bradman fell for 138 with the score at 5 / 305 . Yardley again pinned Hassett down with more leg theory . Laker bowled with one slip , while Young had none and employed a pure ring field . The scoring was slow during this passage of play — Young delivered 11 consecutive maiden overs and his 26 @-@ over spell conceded only 14 runs . The injured Ray Lindwall came out to join Hassett at 7 / 365 without a runner . Hassett — who had scored only 30 runs in the first 75 minutes of the morning — swept Laker for four and then hit him for the first six of the match . Hassett added 53 in the two hours of the morning session to reach lunch at 94 . Australia were unhurried and remained patient in the face of Yardley 's defensive tactics because they had bowled England out on the first day and there was still sufficient time to force a result . After the break , Hassett reached his first Test century on English <unk> from 305 minutes . He then accelerated , adding a further 37 runs in 49 minutes , before being bowled by Bedser , having struck 20 fours and a six . This ended an eighth @-@ wicket partnership of 107 with Lindwall with the score at 8 / 473 ; Australia ended at 509 to take a 344 @-@ run first innings lead . In the second innings , Hassett hit the winning run to end with an unbeaten 21 in an eight @-@ wicket win . 
 The First Test set the tone for the series , and ahead of the next Test , Hassett top scored with 127 and took five catches in an innings win over Northamptonshire . Hassett scored 47 and a duck in the Second Test at Lord 's , having been dropped three times in the first innings as Australia went on to a 409 @-@ run win . Hassett then struck 139 against Surrey , his second century against the county in as many matches . Hassett and Australia were in difficulty in the Third Test at Old Trafford . Hassett made 38 as Australia scored 221 in reply to 363 . In England 's second innings , Hassett twice dropped Cyril Washbrook in the same position from the same shot . After the third day 's play , Washbrook shouted Hassett a drink ; England were in a strong position , 316 runs ahead with seven wickets in hand . Luckily for Australia and Hassett , the pair of missed chances from the England opener late in the day cost little . Washbrook remained unbeaten on 85 as England declared without further addition after the entire fourth day and the final morning had been lost to rain . Hassett was not required as Australia batted for 61 overs to ensure a draw . 
 Hassett had a new role as the teams headed to Headingley for the Fourth Test . He would improvise and open with Morris , as regular opener Sid Barnes was injured . Hassett dropped Len Hutton — who went on to score 81 — on 25 . Hassett struggled to make an impact in the unfamiliar role , scoring 13 and 17 . However , the other Australian batsmen stepped up and scored 3 / 404 in 330 minutes on the final day to set a new world record for the highest successful Test runchase , ensuring an unassailable 3 – 0 series lead . Hassett scored two fifties in the lead @-@ up to the Fifth Test , where he returned to his customary role with the return of Barnes . Hassett took a diving catch in the first innings and scored 37 in an innings win . Australia thus won the series convincingly 4 – 0 and Hassett finished the series with 310 runs at 44 @.@ 29 . 
 After the Tests , seven matches remained on Bradman 's quest to go through a tour of England without <unk> played in four of the matches and was in fine form , hitting three consecutive centuries . Against the Gentlemen of England at Lord 's , Hassett made 200 not out against a team that featured eight Test players . He then made 103 against Somerset and 151 against the South of England . Australia won the first two and were denied by rain in the third . 
 Hassett ended the first @-@ class matches with 1 @,@ 563 runs at 74 @.@ 22 and seven centuries . He had the third highest aggregate behind Bradman and Morris and the second highest average . In recognition of his performances in England , he was named one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1949 . Wisden opined that " in addition to his playing ability Hassett 's cheerfulness and leadership , which extended to off @-@ the @-@ field relaxation as well as in the more exacting part of the programme , combined to make him an ideal vice @-@ captain able to lift a considerable load off Bradman 's busy shoulders " . 
 = = = Captain of Australia = = = 
 By virtue of his performances with the Services team and his seniority in Australian cricket , Hassett appeared certain to succeed Bradman as captain ; his only rival for the position was NSW captain Arthur Morris , the third selector during the tour of England . The season , which was purely domestic with no touring Test team , started with Bradman 's testimonial match , in which Hassett led a team against the retiring Australian leader . Hassett scored 35 and 102 and the match ended with the scores tied . Bradman 's outfit managed to fall short of the victory by the smallest possible margin , ending one run short of their target with one wicket remaining at the end of the final over . Hassett continued his liking for the Queensland attack , scoring 104 and 205 in Victoria ’ s two matches against their northern opponents for the year . Victoria did not do so well as a team , winning two and losing one of the six matches in which Hassett played , as New South Wales took the title . The summer finished with Hassett captaining a team against an eleven led by Morris . The match was designated as a trial for the selection of the Australian team to tour South Africa the following summer . Hassett scored 73 and 159 and top @-@ scored in both innings ; Morris 66 and 12 . However , Hassett ’ s effort was not enough to stop an eight @-@ wicket defeat after Morris ’ s men took a 377 @-@ run first innings lead . Morris and Hassett were the first and third highest run @-@ scorers for the 1948 – 49 season . Hassett ended the season with 855 runs at 61 @.@ 07 . 
 The day after the match , the chosen touring team was passed to the Board of Control for a decision on the captaincy . The 7 – 6 result in favour of Hassett provoked Ray Robinson to write that the deciding vote , cast for Hassett by the Board chairman Dr Allen Robertson ( from Victoria ) , " ... save [ d ] the Board from an act of disgusting ingratitude " and that , " ... once again Hassett 's notable achievements with the Services team had been devalued . " The main reason given for the administrators ' less than unanimous endorsement of Hassett was his religion . As an Irish Catholic , Hassett was subjected to the sectarian bias of some Australian cricket officials , an attitude that was common among the Anglo @-@ Saxon Protestant ruling class of the time , and so narrowly became the first Catholic captain since Percy McDonnell in 1888 . 
 The team itself was significantly different from the Invincibles squad . Bradman had retired ; Sid Barnes , Don Tallon , Ernie Toshack and Bill Brown were unavailable , while the omission of Keith Miller caused a furore . Miller later joined the tour after an injury sustained in a car crash sidelined Bill Johnston for an extended period at the start of the tour . However , Johnston recovered , and both he and Miller took their places in all five Tests , eliminating any disadvantage caused by the controversial initial omission of the latter . 
 Matching Bradman 's feat , Hassett led his team through South Africa undefeated and claimed the Test series 4 – 0 , winning 14 out of 21 matches . Although he was hampered by recurrent problems with his tonsils , the success of the tour was attributed to Hassett 's , " ... unobtrusive yet dominant personality . " He scored 889 first @-@ class runs at 68 @.@ 38 on the tour , including four centuries . In the lead @-@ up to the Tests , Hassett scored 100 and 96 , and he led Australia to four consecutive wins , three by an innings and the other by ten wickets . 
 The opening Test began at Johannesburg on Christmas Eve 1949 . Batting first , Australia started poorly when both opening batsmen failed to score , before Hassett " transformed the course of the game with a hundred of considerable quality . " He compiled 112 ( in 261 minutes ) of the 198 runs added while he was at the crease ; Australia amassed 413 then bowled South Africa out twice to win by an innings . He then scored 57 and enforced the follow on in an eight @-@ wicket win in the Second Test . 
 Hassett ’ s winning run looked at an end when Australia was exposed to a sticky wicket in the Third Test . The hosts had reached 2 / 240 at the end of the first day before rain hit and made the pitch extremely difficult for batting . The next day , Hassett had to waste time to keep South Africa batting on the poor surface so that Australia ’ s batsmen would not be exposed to the worst conditions . He then told his bowlers to perform badly so that the hosts would not realise how difficult the pitch was and declare so that Australia would have to face the sticky wicket . Despite Hassett ’ s subterfuge , the pitch was so poor that South Africa fell to be 311 all out , but Australia had gained extra time . The tourists made only 75 , but then dismissed the hosts for 99 , Hassett using defensive tactics to slow the scoring and keep South Africa batting as the pitch slowly improved . Australia chased down the target of 336 with five wickets in hand to secure a highly unlikely win . The local newspaper , The Natal Mercury said that " Renowned for their fighting qualities as a cricketers , the occasion brought the best out of the Australians ... That indomitable spirit to win through , no matter what the circumstances may be , was in most marked evidence . " 
 Hassett ’ s perfect record as Test captain ended in the Fourth Test , when he made 53 in a high @-@ scoring draw . He then " reached peak form " in the final Test at Port Elizabeth . He top @-@ scored with 167 as the match unfolded in a similar manner to the First Test , with a similar result . Australia made 7 / 549 declared and then won by an innings and 259 runs after enforcing the follow on . 
 As a leader , Hassett was regarded as an outstanding success . In that era , the tours were accompanied by much ceremony , and captains were expected to make many appearances with dignatories at dinner parties and make speeches . He had his players participate in cultural activities such as dancing and singing with indigenous tribesmen , and reached out to the local children , interspersing his presentations with self @-@ deprecating jibes . As the team ’ s boat departed for home , Hassett tossed his remaining money away among the local children . The Australian High Commission hailed him as the most effective Australian diplomat to have visited South Africa . Of his on @-@ field performances , the historian Chris Harte wrote that " Hassett ’ s captaincy impressed from the start . His warmth of personality and sense of fun contrasted with Bradman ’ s efficient but cold methods . It was a happy tour with the players remembering particularly the hospitality offered to them . "

 Hassett started the 1950 – 51 season strongly ; after making 19 against England for Victoria , he struck 113 and 179 against South Australia and New South Wales in his two other matches before the Tests . 
 The England team that visited Australia for the 1950 – 51 Ashes series had a poor start to their tour , but at Brisbane on the opening day of the First Test , " ... surprised even themselves by dismissing Australia for 228 on a good pitch . " However , rain intervened to negate England 's advantage , and when the contest resumed two days later , England batted on a sticky wicket . The English captain Freddie Brown conceded a first @-@ innings lead of 160 runs by declaring with his team 's score on 7 / 68 to force Australia to bat in unfavourable conditions . The Australian batsmen fared worse in the difficult conditions and Hassett gambled by declaring at 7 / 32 , setting England 193 to win . Hassett himself had only managed eight and three for the match . During the 70 minutes remaining before stumps , Australia took six English wickets ( which meant that 20 wickets fell for 102 runs in the day 's play ) , and went on to win the match by 70 runs the following day . Hassett returned to his normal form away from the sticky wicket , scoring 127 and 28 not out against Queensland between Tests . It was his third century in as many matches for Victoria . 
 In the Second Test at Melbourne , " Australia owed much to the imperturbable Hassett " , as he top @-@ scored with 52 in the first innings . Australia won another low @-@ scoring match by 28 runs ; Freddie Brown was the only other player to post a half century in the match and no team passed 200 . Hassett then stroked 70 in the Third Test , which Australia won by an innings to take an unassailable 3 – 0 series lead , before Australia won their fifth Test in a row in the next match in Adelaide . 
 Before the final Test , Hassett 's run @-@ scoring peaked when he stroked 232 against Brown 's men in a drawn match for Victoria . In the Fifth Test at the MCG , he top @-@ scored with 92 before his dismissal to a one @-@ handed diving catch sparked a collapse and Australia managed only 217 batting first . The tourists took a first innings lead and Hassett made 48 in Australia ’ s second innings of 197 . England made the 95 needed for victory , and the eight @-@ wicket loss was Australia 's first Test defeat since the resumption of international cricket after World War II , ending a streak of 25 Tests without defeat . Hassett and Brown described the series as the friendliest they had been involved in , but despite the success on the field , the series was poorly attended and revenue was down by around 25 % from the corresponding tour four years earlier , mainly due to the absence of Bradman to spark public interest . 
 Hassett was the second @-@ highest run @-@ scorer of the series , hitting 366 runs at 40 @.@ 67 . Only England 's Len Hutton ( 533 runs at 88 @.@ 83 ) was better . Hassett ended the first @-@ class season with 1 @,@ 423 runs at 64 @.@ 68 , including four centuries and five fifties , topping the run @-@ scoring aggregates . He played in seven shield matches without defeat , winning five to help Victoria to another title . 
 Wisden , taking into consideration Australia 's post @-@ war record and the West Indies ' success during their 1950 tour of England , declared the 1951 – 52 series between the two sides to be , " the unofficial cricket championship of the world " . Hassett went into the First Test at Brisbane without playing a first @-@ class match for the season due to the scheduling . However , this was negated by the fact that the tourists only had one match of comparable standard before the Tests , prompting Hassett to make some unusually blunt comments , saying that " The West Indies have suffered from sheer stupidity in the organisation of their tour " . Like many of the Australians , he struggled to pick the action of West Indian leg spinner Sonny Ramadhin . He was out for only six in the first innings , as Australia eked out a 10 @-@ run lead . He then managed 35 as Australia scraped home in the second innings by three wickets to 7 / 236 . He had been dismissed by Ramadhin both times , bowled and lbw , unable to pick which way the ball was spinning . Between Tests , Hassett had an opportunity to rectify this problem when Victoria hosted the Caribbean tourists , but Ramadhin prevailed again , dismissing him for 12 in his only innings . Having worked out how to pick Ramadhin 's variations , he compiled 132 and 46 not out in a seven @-@ wicket win in the Second Test at Sydney . Hassett 's century was part of a 235 @-@ run partnership with Keith Miller , an Australian Test record for any wicket against the West Indies . Ramadhin ended with 1 / 196 and was demoralised . Between Tests , Hassett 's Victorians faced New South Wales in consecutive matches . Hassett scored 92 in the first encounter , a high @-@ scoring draw , and his team had the upper hand in the latter , forcing their opponents to hold on with only three wickets remaining . 
 Hassett missed the next Test with a strained muscle ; this led to a bureaucratic restriction that hindered his deputy Morris . Having been injured on the eve of the Test , Hassett ’ s withdrawal forced the selectors to call in batsman Phil Ridings at late notice , but some of the board members could not be contacted to ratify the decision . This meant that Hassett had to be replaced by a spare bowler who was already in the squad . In Hassett ’ s absence , Australia ’ s thin batting line @-@ up collapsed on a damp pitch hostile to batsmen and lost . Returning for the Fourth Test at the MCG , Australia ’ s batsmen again struggled ; Hassett made 15 and his team conceded a lead of 56 on the first innings . His team was set a second innings target of 260 runs to win . Hassett made 102 but found little support from the other batsmen . When he was dismissed with the score at 8 / 218 , the West Indies appeared set to level the series . However , an unbeaten last wicket partnership of 38 runs between tailenders Doug Ring and Bill Johnston gave Australia an unlikely victory and the series 3 – 1 . It was reported that Hassett , who had just taken a shower after being dismissed , was so mesmerised by the efforts of Ring and Johnston that the watched the final moments of the match naked from the change rooms . 
 Ahead of the final Test of the series , Hassett 's Victorians suffered a four @-@ wicket defeat in their second match of the season against the West Indies , Hassett scoring 56 and 43 . Australia completed an emphatic 4 – 1 result by winning the final encounter , even though they were bowled out for 116 on the first day of the match , before fighting back to dismiss the tourists for 78 . Hassett 's second innings score of 64 took his total to 402 runs ( at an average of 57 @.@ 43 ) , making him the leading run @-@ scorer for the series . Hassett ended the season with a dominant 229 against South Australia , setting up an innings win , dwarfing the 222 and 166 made by his opponents combined . Despite this , New South Wales claimed the Sheffield Shield for the season , and Hassett ended the summer with 855 runs at 61 @.@ 07 . 
 = = = Australia 's decline and the Ashes lost = = = 
 In 1952 – 53 , South Africa 's cricket authorities were hesitant to send their inexperienced team to Australia , fearing that the Test series would be uncompetitive . The Australian Board of Control 's concern that — after losing money on the previous season 's tour by the West Indies — the series would be another financial disaster resulted in South Africa offering an indemnity of ₤ 10 @,@ 000 against any losses . Hassett began the season with two consecutive Sheffield Shield losses before the Tests , although he did manage 91 against South Australia before facing South Africa . He scored 123 in the return match later in the season and Victoria recorded two wins under his watch , against Queensland . 
 Australia won the opening game of the rubber in an unexpectedly close match in Brisbane by 96 runs , Hassett making 55 and 17 . South Africa struck back and gained their first Test victory over Australia for 41 years , taking the Second Test at Melbourne by 82 runs . Australia recovered momentum by convincingly winning the Third Test by an innings , but Hassett 's form had been mediocre in all three encounters , totalling 76 runs in five innings . In the Fourth Test at Adelaide , he played his only significant innings for the series , scoring 163 and sharing a 275 @-@ run stand with Colin McDonald . With Australia heading for a victory that would give them the series , Ray Lindwall and Miller suffered injuries and were unable to bowl in the second innings . This compelled Hassett to delay his second innings declaration : South Africa then forced a draw by batting out 73 ( eight @-@ ball ) overs against the depleted bowling attack with four wickets in hand . In anticipation of the forthcoming tour of England , Australian selectors made a fateful decision to rest Lindwall and Miller for the last Test when Hassett won the toss and elected to bat . He scored 40 runs in a total of 520 that gave Australia apparent command of the match . However , South Africa again fought back ; after scoring 435 , the tourists bowled Australia out for 209 , Hassett making 30 . They then won the match by chasing a target of 297 runs in their second innings . Hassett bowled the final over and the tourists ’ Roy McLean took three fours from the first five balls to reach their target and square the series . Hassett ended the Tests with 309 runs at 38 @.@ 63 and the entire season with 779 runs at 38 @.@ 95 , a substantially lower return compared to previous Australian summers . 
 For the first time in 20 years , Australia had failed to win a Test series at home , the last being the infamous Bodyline series of 1932 – 33 . Wisden called the 2 – 2 result , " ... the biggest cricket shock for many years . " The absence of Lindwall and Miller in the later part of the series exposed the limitations of the other Australian bowlers and did not augur well for the future . Hassett made it known that the tour of England in 1953 would be his farewell to the game . The selectors included only two specialist opening batsmen in the team , which caused problems when McDonald was injured and Morris struggled for form . This forced Hassett to play as an opener in the Tests ; while Morris ’ s old partner Barnes was in England to report on the tour as a reporter , his history of criticising cricket administrators meant that officialdom would call him into the squad to cover for McDonald . There were also tensions among the team off the field . The more experienced members of the team from Hassett ’ s generation were World War II veterans , and were happy to be alive and tended to enjoy drinking and partying , while the younger members tended to be <unk> . This led to a divide as the seniors regularly halted the team bus for drinking stops at the roadside pubs , leaving their younger teammates waiting . Some of the non @-@ drinkers said that because of the frequent visits at pubs , the team bus only travelled approximately 15 km each hour . 
 Hassett struggled in two warm @-@ up matches against Tasmania before the Australians left for England , and despite winning both fixtures , it was not to be a happy tour on the field . In the first match on English soil , against East Molesey , Bill Johnston , Australia ’ s leading wicket @-@ taker in 1948 , broke down with a serious knee injury . Hassett struggled in the opening first @-@ class matches in England , passing 40 only once in six innings . In the last match before the Tests , against Sussex , he hit an unbeaten 108 . Australia 's progress before the Tests was constantly curtailed by bad weather . Of the six first @-@ class matches that Hassett played , three did not reach the second innings , although Australia did manage two victories . 
 In the First Test at Trent Bridge , Hassett hit 115 in a rain @-@ affected match that ended in a draw . Over the next month , he struggled in the county matches , scoring only 30 runs in total . The Australians were to be frustrated in the next three Tests . In the Second Test at Lord ’ s , Hassett made 104 , top @-@ scoring in Australia ’ s 346 despite being hindered by a bandaged right arm and cramps . England took a 26 @-@ run first innings lead , but Australia replied with 368 . Hassett ’ s bowlers reduced England to 3 / 12 but they hung on to deny Australia victory . The Third Test was another wet affair . Hassett made 26 as Australia scored 318 and took a 42 @-@ run first innings lead , but they then collapsed to be 8 / 35 . Australia was saved from defeat by the rain , which meant that less than 14 hours of play was possible . 
 In the Fourth Test , the Australians worked themselves into a position to win the match and thus retain the Ashes . Hassett made 37 as his team compiled 266 and took a 99 @-@ run first innings lead . The tourists looked set for victory and retention of The Ashes at the start of the final day , but time @-@ wasting and defiant defence from the English batsmen left Australia a target of 177 in the last two hours . This would have required a scoring rate much higher than in the first four days of the match . Hassett made only four , but Australia had made 111 in 75 minutes and were on schedule for a win . At that point , English medium @-@ pacer Trevor Bailey began bowling with the wicket @-@ keeper more than two metres down the leg side in order to deny the Australians an opportunity to hit the ball , but the umpires did not penalise them as wides . The match ended in a draw with Australia at 4 / 147 when time ran out . English wicket @-@ keeper Godfrey Evans said that " they were right " in claiming that Bailey 's bowling was " the worst kind of negative cricket " and that he had " cheated [ them ] of victory " . The match was also marred by a series of umpiring decisions made by Frank Chester against the Australians , leading Hassett to request that he not be appointed for the Fifth Test , something the English cricket authorities granted . 
 This meant that the fate of the Ashes would be determined by the final match at The Oval . Hassett warmed up with consecutive half @-@ centuries against Surrey and Warwickshire . In the second innings of the latter match , he made 21 not out , holding the team together as Australia stumbled to 5 / 53 in pursuit of 166 for victory when time ran out . 
 In Australia ’ s tour matches at The Oval , the pacemen had been effective , and Hassett and Morris thought that things would be similar in the Tests . As a result , leg spinner Ring was omitted . Hassett made 53 as Australia made 275 batting first . England then took a 31 @-@ run lead and Hassett was out for only 10 in the second innings as Australia fell for only 162 , as the local spinners Jim Laker and Tony Lock cut down the Australians on a turning surface . The hosts then reached the target safely with eight wickets in hand to claim a 1 – 0 victory , thus winning the Ashes for the first time since the infamous Bodyline tour of 1932 – 33 . Hassett was in fine form after the Tests , scoring 148 against Somerset , 65 against Kent , 106 against South , and 74 and 25 against TN Pearce 's XI in the remaining first @-@ class matches in England . Australia managed to win the matches against Kent and South by an innings , but it was too late to save the Ashes . Nevertheless , Harte said that " Hassett ’ s leadership throughout had been sparkling " . 
 Hassett made one final first @-@ class appearance upon returning to Australia , in a testimonial match against Morris 's XI . He made 126 in the first innings , his final century , but could manage only three in the second as his team went down by 121 runs . Nevertheless , the match sent him into retirement ₤ 5 @,@ 503 wealthier , and with more first @-@ class centuries than any Australian except Bradman . 
 = = Style and personality = = 
 The diminutive Hassett was an elegant middle @-@ order batsman , known for his wide range of strokes , timing , quick footwork and strong wrists . However , as his career progressed and his seniority in the Australian team increased , he became a more cautious player who often frustrated spectators with sedate scoring , particularly after World War II . Despite this , Hassett remained an aggressive and adventurous <unk> in matches for Victoria . He had a poker face , and this benefited him as a captain , as even his teammates sometimes found it hard to discern his mood or thinking . During his 24 Test matches in charge , he won 14 games and suffered defeat only four times , but it was the last of the four losses that blighted his record . Hassett was a very occasional right @-@ arm medium pace bowler , averaging one over per first @-@ class match . He took 18 wickets in 216 matches , and never took more than two in a single innings . He never took a wicket at Test level and bowled less than 19 overs . 
 Hassett ’ s most distinctive trait was his fun @-@ loving personality . He was famed for his practical jokes , sense of humour — particularly his self @-@ deprecating quips — and wit , such as in his calming talk to the rioters in Calcutta in 1945 . He remained jovial during his speeches even after Australia suffered defeats . After bowing out of Test cricket in 1953 with a loss , he said that England " earned the victory from the very first ball — to the second last over anyway " , referring to an over that he bowled when defeat became inevitable . 
 During the 1938 tour of England , Hassett smuggled a “ wet , muddy , and complaining ” mountain goat ( put a waistcoat on the goat , according to some sources ) into the bedroom he shared with Stan McCabe and O 'Reilly while the team was staying at <unk> , after they had fallen asleep . They awoke to unexpected smells and bleating . During the 1948 tour of England , he was reported to have unnerved his teammates and tempted fate by bringing a toy duck into the dressing room , and held up play during a county match by hiding the ball in a pile of sawdust . During the same summer , Hassett and a few teammates were being chauffeured back to London after a function . It was after midnight , but Hassett asked the driver to stop at a random mansion along the road . He then rang the bell and told the startled householder that he " just thought we 'd pop in " . The owner happened to recognise Hassett and received the cricketers . In the Third Test of the same tour , after dropping two hooked catches from Washbrook , Hassett responded by borrowing a policeman ’ s helmet , before motioning to Ray Lindwall to bowl another bouncer . During the 1953 tour of England , a waiter spilled a dessert on Hassett 's jacket . Initially declining the waiter 's multiple offers to have his jacket taken away for cleaning , Hassett acquiesced and while taking off his jacket , noticed a spot on his trousers . He then silently pointed to the spot , removed his trousers and handed them to the waiter , before continuing to eat his meal in his underpants . 
 Aside from the humorous side of his personality , Hassett was also known for his diplomatic skills as a leader and his affability , particularly his ability to endear himself to hosts and public while representing Australia overseas . Richie Benaud wrote of Hassett : " There are others who have made more runs and taken more wickets , but very few have ever got more out of a lifetime . " Teammate Keith Miller said that Hassett had " more genuine friends in all walks of life than any other cricketer " . 
 = = Outside cricket = = 
 After returning from World War II , Hassett operated a sports store in Melbourne ; one of his staff members was Victorian Test teammate Neil Harvey . After retiring from cricket , Hassett joined the Australian Broadcasting Commission as a radio commentator in 1956 , remaining in that position until 1981 . During his time in the commentary booth , he was known for his self @-@ deprecating humour and frequently made fun of his conservative approach to batting during the latter half of his career . Hassett was known for his disapproval of some of the aspects of the modern evolution of cricket , particularly the more aggressive player conduct that contrasted with the more sedate and gentlemanly style of his era . 
 He served on the executive committee of the Anti @-@ Cancer Council of Victoria , along with fellow former South Melbourne , Victorian and Test cricketer Laurie Nash . Hassett ran for election as South Melbourne ’ s delegate to the VCA in December 1953 , but was defeated . During the 1954 – 55 Ashes series in Australia , he wrote for The Daily Telegraph . 
 In 1942 , Hassett married Tessie Davis , a Geelong accountant , and they had two daughters . His nephew John Shaw went on to play for Victoria in the 1950s and 1960s . A batsman , Shaw was a regular member of the state team and was selected for an Australian Second XI that toured New Zealand in 1959 – 60 . The MCG has a function room named after Hassett , as does the VCA , which launched a monthly luncheon club in December 1990 named in his honour . In the first year of its operation , more than 500 people joined and a profit in excess of <unk> was made ; this money was reinvested in the VCA 's promotion of junior cricket . 
 In his final years , Hassett moved to <unk> on the south coast of New South Wales to pursue his love of fishing . He died there in 1993 .

 = Agnosticism = 
 Agnosticism is the view that the truth values of certain claims – especially metaphysical and religious claims such as whether God , the divine , or the supernatural exist – are unknown and perhaps unknowable . 
 According to the philosopher William L. Rowe , " agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist . " Agnosticism is a doctrine or set of tenets rather than a religion as such . 
 Thomas Henry Huxley , an English biologist , coined the word " agnostic " in 1869 . Earlier thinkers , however , had written works that promoted agnostic points of view , such as Sanjaya <unk> , a 5th @-@ century BCE Indian philosopher who expressed agnosticism about any afterlife ; and Protagoras , a 5th @-@ century BCE Greek philosopher who expressed agnosticism about " the gods " . The Nasadiya Sukta in the Rigveda is agnostic about the origin of the universe . 
 = = Defining agnosticism = = 
 Agnosticism is of the essence of science , whether ancient or modern . It simply means that a man shall not say he knows or believes that which he has no scientific grounds for professing to know or believe . Consequently Agnosticism puts aside not only the greater part of popular theology , but also the greater part of anti @-@ theology . On the whole , the " bosh " of heterodoxy is more offensive to me than that of orthodoxy , because heterodoxy professes to be guided by reason and science , and orthodoxy does not . 
 That which Agnostics deny and repudiate , as immoral , is the contrary doctrine , that there are propositions which men ought to believe , without logically satisfactory evidence ; and that reprobation ought to attach to the profession of disbelief in such inadequately supported propositions . 
 Agnosticism , in fact , is not a creed , but a method , the essence of which lies in the rigorous application of a single principle ... Positively the principle may be expressed : In matters of the intellect , follow your reason as far as it will take you , without regard to any other consideration . And negatively : In matters of the intellect do not pretend that conclusions are certain which are not demonstrated or demonstrable . 
 Being a scientist , above all else , Huxley presented agnosticism as a form of demarcation . A hypothesis with no supporting objective , testable evidence is not an objective , scientific claim . As such , there would be no way to test said hypotheses , leaving the results inconclusive . His agnosticism was not compatible with forming a belief as to the truth , or falsehood , of the claim at hand . Karl Popper would also describe himself as an agnostic . According to philosopher William L. Rowe , in this strict sense , agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist . 
 Others have redefined this concept , making it compatible with forming a belief , and only incompatible with absolute certainty . George H. Smith , while admitting that the narrow definition of atheist was the common usage definition of that word , and admitting that the broad definition of agnostic was the common usage definition of that word , promoted broadening the definition of atheist and narrowing the definition of agnostic . Smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as agnostic atheism ( the view of those who do not believe in the existence of any deity , but do not claim to know if a deity does or does not exist ) and agnostic theism ( the view of those who do not claim to know of the existence of any deity , but still believe in such an existence ) . 
 Most recently , the terms apathetic and pragmatic agnosticism have been coined with regard to the view that there is no proof of either the existence or non @-@ existence of any deity , but since any deity that may exist appears unconcerned for the universe or the welfare of its inhabitants , the question is largely academic and that their existence therefore has little to no impact on personal human affairs and should be of little theological interest . 
 = = = Etymology = = = 
 Agnostic ( from Ancient Greek ἀ- ( a- ) , meaning " without " , and γνῶσις ( <unk> ) , meaning " knowledge " ) was used by Thomas Henry Huxley in a speech at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1869 to describe his philosophy , which rejects all claims of spiritual or mystical knowledge . 
 Early Christian church leaders used the Greek word gnosis ( knowledge ) to describe " spiritual knowledge " . Agnosticism is not to be confused with religious views opposing the ancient religious movement of Gnosticism in particular ; Huxley used the term in a broader , more abstract sense . Huxley identified agnosticism not as a creed but rather as a method of skeptical , evidence @-@ based inquiry . 
 In recent years , scientific literature dealing with neuroscience and psychology has used the word to mean " not knowable " . In technical and marketing literature , " agnostic " can also mean independence from some parameters — for example , " platform agnostic " or " hardware agnostic " . 
 = = = Qualifying agnosticism = = = 
 Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume contended that meaningful statements about the universe are always qualified by some degree of doubt . He asserted that the fallibility of human beings means that they cannot obtain absolute certainty except in trivial cases where a statement is true by definition ( e.g. tautologies such as " all bachelors are unmarried " or " all triangles have three corners " ) . 
 = = = Types = = = 
 Strong agnosticism ( also called " hard " , " closed " , " strict " , or " permanent agnosticism " ) 
 The view that the question of the existence or nonexistence of a deity or deities , and the nature of ultimate reality is unknowable by reason of our natural inability to verify any experience with anything but another subjective experience . A strong agnostic would say , " I cannot know whether a deity exists or not , and neither can you . " 
 Weak agnosticism ( also called " soft " , " open " , " empirical " , or " temporal agnosticism " ) 
 The view that the existence or nonexistence of any deities is currently unknown but is not necessarily unknowable ; therefore , one will withhold judgment until evidence , if any , becomes available . A weak agnostic would say , " I don 't know whether any deities exist or not , but maybe one day , if there is evidence , we can find something out . "

 = = = Greek philosophy = = = 
 Agnostic thought , in the form of skepticism , emerged as a formal philosophical position in ancient Greece . Its proponents included Protagoras , Pyrrho , Carneades , Sextus Empiricus and , to some degree , Socrates , who was a strong advocate for a skeptical approach to epistemology . 
 Pyrrho said that we should refrain from making judgment as we can never know the true reality . According to Pyrrho , having opinion was possible , but certainty and knowledge are impossible . Carneades was also a skeptic in relation to all knowledge claims . He proposed a probability theory , however . According to him , certainty could never be attained . Protagoras rejected the conventional accounts of the gods . He said : 
 Concerning the gods , I have no means of knowing whether they exist or not or of what sort they may be . Many things prevent knowledge including the obscurity of the subject and the brevity of human life .

 Throughout the history of Hinduism there has been a strong tradition of philosophic speculation and skepticism . 
 The Rig Veda takes an agnostic view on the fundamental question of how the universe and the gods were created . Nasadiya Sukta ( Creation Hymn ) in the tenth chapter of the Rig Veda says : 
 = = = Hume , Kant , and Kierkegaard = = = 
 Aristotle , Anselm , Aquinas , and Descartes presented arguments attempting to rationally prove the existence of God . The skeptical empiricism of David Hume , the <unk> of Immanuel Kant , and the existential philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard convinced many later philosophers to abandon these attempts , regarding it impossible to construct any unassailable proof for the existence or non @-@ existence of God . 
 In his 1844 book , Philosophical Fragments , Kierkegaard writes : 
 Let us call this unknown something : God . It is nothing more than a name we assign to it . The idea of demonstrating that this unknown something ( God ) exists , could scarcely suggest itself to Reason . For if God does not exist it would of course be impossible to prove it ; and if he does exist it would be folly to attempt it . For at the very outset , in beginning my proof , I would have presupposed it , not as doubtful but as certain ( a presupposition is never doubtful , for the very reason that it is a presupposition ) , since otherwise I would not begin , readily understanding that the whole would be impossible if he did not exist . But if when I speak of proving God 's existence I mean that I propose to prove that the Unknown , which exists , is God , then I express myself unfortunately . For in that case I do not prove anything , least of all an existence , but merely develop the content of a conception . 
 Hume was Huxley 's favourite philosopher , calling him " the Prince of Agnostics " . Diderot wrote to his mistress , telling of a visit by Hume to the Baron D 'Holbach , and describing how a word for the position that Huxley would later describe as agnosticism didn 't seem to exist , or at least wasn 't common knowledge , at the time . 
 The first time that M. Hume found himself at the table of the Baron , he was seated beside him . I don 't know for what purpose the English philosopher took it into his head to remark to the Baron that he did not believe in atheists , that he had never seen any . The Baron said to him : " Count how many we are here . " We are eighteen . The Baron added : " It isn 't too bad a showing to be able to point out to you fifteen at once : the three others haven 't made up their minds . " 
 = = = Thomas Henry Huxley = = = 
 Agnostic views are as old as philosophical skepticism , but the terms agnostic and agnosticism were created by Huxley to sum up his thoughts on contemporary developments of metaphysics about the " unconditioned " ( William Hamilton ) and the " unknowable " ( Herbert Spencer ) . Though Huxley began to use the term " agnostic " in 1869 , his opinions had taken shape some time before that date . In a letter of September 23 , 1860 , to Charles Kingsley , Huxley discussed his views extensively : 
 I neither affirm nor deny the immortality of man . I see no reason for believing it , but , on the other hand , I have no means of disproving it . I have no a priori objections to the doctrine . No man who has to deal daily and hourly with nature can trouble himself about a priori difficulties . Give me such evidence as would justify me in believing in anything else , and I will believe that . Why should I not ? It is not half so wonderful as the conservation of force or the indestructibility of matter ... 
 It is no use to talk to me of analogies and probabilities . I know what I mean when I say I believe in the law of the inverse squares , and I will not rest my life and my hopes upon weaker convictions ... 
 That my personality is the surest thing I know may be true . But the attempt to conceive what it is leads me into mere verbal subtleties . I have <unk> up all that chaff about the ego and the non @-@ ego , <unk> and phenomena , and all the rest of it , too often not to know that in attempting even to think of these questions , the human intellect flounders at once out of its depth . 
 And again , to the same correspondent , May 6 , 1863 : 
 I have never had the least sympathy with the a priori reasons against orthodoxy , and I have by nature and disposition the greatest possible antipathy to all the atheistic and infidel school . Nevertheless I know that I am , in spite of myself , exactly what the Christian would call , and , so far as I can see , is justified in calling , atheist and infidel . I cannot see one shadow or tittle of evidence that the great unknown underlying the phenomenon of the universe stands to us in the relation of a Father [ who ] loves us and cares for us as Christianity asserts . So with regard to the other great Christian dogmas , immortality of soul and future state of rewards and punishments , what possible objection can I — who am compelled perforce to believe in the immortality of what we call Matter and Force , and in a very unmistakable present state of rewards and punishments for our deeds — have to these doctrines ? Give me a <unk> of evidence , and I am ready to jump at them . 
 Of the origin of the name agnostic to describe this attitude , Huxley gave the following account : 
 When I reached intellectual maturity and began to ask myself whether I was an atheist , a theist , or a pantheist ; a materialist or an idealist ; Christian or a freethinker ; I found that the more I learned and reflected , the less ready was the answer ; until , at last , I came to the conclusion that I had neither art nor part with any of these denominations , except the last . The one thing in which most of these good people were agreed was the one thing in which I differed from them . They were quite sure they had attained a certain " gnosis " – had , more or less successfully , solved the problem of existence ; while I was quite sure I had not , and had a pretty strong conviction that the problem was insoluble . And , with Hume and Kant on my side , I could not think myself presumptuous in holding fast by that opinion ... 
 So I took thought , and invented what I conceived to be the appropriate title of " agnostic " . It came into my head as suggestively <unk> to the " gnostic " of Church history , who professed to know so much about the very things of which I was ignorant . ... To my great satisfaction the term took . 
 In 1889 , Huxley wrote : 
 Therefore , although it be , as I believe , demonstrable that we have no real knowledge of the authorship , or of the date of composition of the Gospels , as they have come down to us , and that nothing better than more or less probable guesses can be arrived at on that subject .

 William Stewart Ross wrote under the name of Saladin . He championed agnosticism in opposition to the atheism of Charles Bradlaugh as an open @-@ ended spiritual exploration . In Why I am an Agnostic ( c . 1889 ) he claims that agnosticism is " the very reverse of atheism " .

 Robert G. Ingersoll , an Illinois lawyer and politician who evolved into a well @-@ known and sought @-@ after orator in 19th @-@ century America , has been referred to as the " Great Agnostic " . 
 In an 1896 lecture titled Why I Am An Agnostic , Ingersoll related why he was an agnostic : 
 Is there a supernatural power — an arbitrary mind — an enthroned God — a supreme will that sways the tides and currents of the world — to which all causes bow ? I do not deny . I do not know — but I do not believe . I believe that the natural is supreme — that from the infinite chain no link can be lost or broken — that there is no supernatural power that can answer prayer — no power that worship can persuade or change — no power that cares for man . 
 I believe that with infinite arms Nature embraces the all — that there is no interference — no chance — that behind every event are the necessary and countless causes , and that beyond every event will be and must be the necessary and countless effects . 
 Is there a God ? I do not know . Is man immortal ? I do not know . One thing I do know , and that is , that neither hope , nor fear , belief , nor denial , can change the fact . It is as it is , and it will be as it must be . 
 In the conclusion of the speech he simply sums up the agnostic position as : 
 We can be as honest as we are ignorant . If we are , when asked what is beyond the horizon of the known , we must say that we do not know . 
 = = = Bertrand Russell = = = 
 Bertrand Russell 's pamphlet , Why I Am Not a Christian , based on a speech delivered in 1927 and later included in a book of the same title , is considered a classic statement of agnosticism . He calls upon his readers to " stand on their own two feet and look fair and square at the world with a fearless attitude and a free intelligence " . 
 In 1939 , Russell gave a lecture on The existence and nature of God , in which he characterized himself as an atheist . He said : 
 The existence and nature of God is a subject of which I can discuss only half . If one arrives at a negative conclusion concerning the first part of the question , the second part of the question does not arise ; and my position , as you may have gathered , is a negative one on this matter . 
 However , later in the same lecture , discussing modern non @-@ anthropomorphic concepts of God , Russell states : 
 That sort of God is , I think , not one that can actually be disproved , as I think the omnipotent and benevolent creator can . 
 In Russell 's 1947 pamphlet , Am I An Atheist or an Agnostic ? ( subtitled A Plea For Tolerance in the Face of New <unk> ) , he ruminates on the problem of what to call himself : 
 As a philosopher , if I were speaking to a purely philosophic audience I should say that I ought to describe myself as an Agnostic , because I do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one can prove that there is not a God . On the other hand , if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think I ought to say that I am an Atheist , because when I say that I cannot prove that there is not a God , I ought to add equally that I cannot prove that there are not the Homeric gods . 
 In his 1953 essay , What Is An Agnostic ? Russell states : 
 An agnostic thinks it impossible to know the truth in matters such as God and the future life with which Christianity and other religions are concerned . Or , if not impossible , at least impossible at the present time . 
 Are Agnostics Atheists ? 
 No . An atheist , like a Christian , holds that we can know whether or not there is a God . The Christian holds that we can know there is a God ; the atheist , that we can know there is not . The Agnostic suspends judgment , saying that there are not sufficient grounds either for affirmation or for denial . 
 Later in the essay , Russell adds : 
 I think that if I heard a voice from the sky predicting all that was going to happen to me during the next twenty @-@ four hours , including events that would have seemed highly improbable , and if all these events then produced to happen , I might perhaps be convinced at least of the existence of some superhuman intelligence .
