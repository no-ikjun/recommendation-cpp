 In the United States , it is common for medical insurance not to cover treatment for the bends that is the result of recreational diving . This is because scuba diving is considered an elective and " high @-@ risk " activity and treatment for decompression sickness is expensive . A typical stay in a recompression chamber will easily cost several thousand dollars , even before emergency transportation is included . As a result , groups such as Divers Alert Network ( DAN ) offer medical insurance policies that specifically cover all aspects of treatment for decompression sickness at rates of less than $ 100 per year . 
 In the United Kingdom , treatment of DCS is provided by the National Health Service . This may occur either at a specialised facility or at a hyperbaric centre based within a general hospital . 
 = 10 Hygiea = 
 10 Hygiea is the fourth @-@ largest asteroid in the Solar System by volume and mass , and it is located in the asteroid belt . With somewhat oblong diameters of 350 – 500 kilometres ( 220 – 310 mi ) ( 217 – 310 miles ) and a mass estimated to be 2 @.@ 9 % of the total mass of the belt , it is the largest of the class of dark C @-@ type asteroids with a carbonaceous surface . 
 = = Observation = = 
 Despite its size , Hygiea appears very dim when observed from Earth . This is due to its dark surface and larger @-@ than @-@ average distance from the Sun . For this reason , many smaller asteroids were observed before Annibale de <unk> discovered Hygiea on 12 April 1849 . At most oppositions , Hygiea has a magnitude that is four magnitudes dimmer than Vesta 's , and observing it typically requires at least a 100 @-@ millimetre ( 4 in ) telescope . However , while at a perihelic opposition , it can often be observed just with <unk> binoculars . 
 = = Discovery and name = = 
 On 12 April 1849 , in Naples , Italy , astronomer Annibale de <unk> ( age 29 ) discovered Hygiea . It was the first of his nine asteroid discoveries . The director of the Naples observatory , Ernesto <unk> , named the asteroid . He chose to call it <unk> <unk> ( " Bourbon Hygieia " ) in honor of the ruling family of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies where Naples was located . 
 In 1852 , John Russell Hind wrote that " it is universally termed Hygiea , the unnecessary appendage ' <unk> ' being dropped " ( as well as the final " ia " in favor of just " a " ) . The name comes from Hygieia , the Greek goddess of health , daughter of Asclepius ( Aesculapius for the Romans ) . The name was occasionally misspelled Hygeia in the 19th century , for example in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society . 
 = = Physical characteristics = = 
 Based on spectral evidence , Hygiea 's surface is thought to consist of primitive carbonaceous materials similar to those found in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites . Aqueous alteration products have been detected on its surface , which could indicate the presence of water ice in the past which was heated sufficiently to melt . The primitive present surface composition would indicate that Hygiea had not been melted during the early period of Solar System formation , in contrast to other large planetesimals like 4 Vesta . 
 Hygiea is the main member of the Hygiea family and contains almost all the mass ( well over 90 % ) in this family . It is the largest of the class of dark C @-@ type asteroids that are dominant in the outer asteroid belt — which lie beyond the Kirkwood gap at 2 @.@ 82 AU . Hygiea appears to have a noticeably oblate spheroid shape , with an average diameter of 444 ± 35 km and a semimajor axis ratio of 1 @.@ 11 . This is much more than for the other objects in the " big four " — 2 Pallas , 4 Vesta and the dwarf planet Ceres . Aside from being the smallest of the four , Hygiea , like Ceres , has a relatively low density , which is more comparable to the icy satellites of Jupiter or Saturn than to the terrestrial planets or the stony asteroids . 
 Although it is the largest body in its region , due to its dark surface and larger @-@ than @-@ average distance from the Sun , Hygiea appears very dim when observed from Earth . In fact , it is the third dimmest of the first twenty @-@ three asteroids discovered , with only 13 <unk> and 17 Thetis having lower mean opposition magnitudes . At most oppositions , Hygiea has a magnitude of around + 10 @.@ 2 , which is as much as four orders fainter than Vesta , and observation calls for at least a 4 @-@ inch ( 100 mm ) telescope to resolve . However , at a perihelic opposition , Hygiea can reach + 9 @.@ 1 and may just be resolvable with <unk> binoculars , unlike the next two largest asteroids in the asteroid belt , 704 Interamnia and 511 Davida , which are always beyond binocular visibility . 
 At least 5 stellar occultations by Hygiea have been tracked by Earth @-@ based astronomers , but all with few independent observers so that little was learned of its shape . The Hubble Space Telescope has resolved the asteroid and ruled out the presence of any orbiting companions larger than about 16 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 9 mi ) in diameter . 
 = = Orbit and rotation = = 
 Generally , Hygiea 's properties are the most poorly known out of the " big four " objects in the asteroid belt . Its orbit is much closer to the plane of the ecliptic than those of Ceres , Pallas or Interamnia , but is less circular than Ceres or Vesta with an eccentricity of around 12 % . Its perihelion is at a quite similar longitude to those of Vesta and Ceres , though its ascending and descending nodes are opposite to the corresponding ones for those objects . Although its perihelion is extremely close to the mean distance of Ceres and Pallas , a collision between Hygiea and its larger companions is impossible because at that distance they are always on opposite sides of the ecliptic . In 2056 , Hygiea will pass <unk> from Ceres , and then in 2063 , Hygiea will pass <unk> from Pallas . At aphelion Hygiea reaches out to the extreme edge of the asteroid belt at the perihelia of the Hilda family which is in 3 : 2 resonance with Jupiter . Hygiea is used by the Minor Planet Center to calculate perturbations . 
 Hygiea is an unusually slow rotator , taking 27 hours and 37 minutes for a revolution , whereas 6 to 12 hours are more typical for large asteroids . Its direction of rotation is not certain at present , due to a twofold ambiguity in lightcurve data that is exacerbated by its long rotation period — which makes single @-@ night telescope observations span at best only a fraction of a full rotation — but it is believed to be retrograde . <unk> analysis indicates that Hygiea 's pole points towards either ecliptic coordinates ( β , λ ) = ( 30 ° , 115 ° ) or ( 30 ° , 300 ° ) with a 10 ° uncertainty . This gives an axial tilt of about 60 ° in both cases .

 = Sinoceratops = 
 Sinoceratops / <unk> / is an extinct genus of ceratopsian dinosaur that lived approximately 72 to 66 million years ago during the latter part of the Cretaceous Period in what is now Shandong province in China . It was named in 2010 by Xu Xing et al. for three skulls from Zhucheng , China . The name of its type species Sinoceratops <unk> means " Chinese horned face from Zhucheng " , after the location of its discovery . 
 Sinoceratops was a medium @-@ sized , averagely @-@ built , ground @-@ dwelling , quadrupedal herbivore . It could grow up to an estimated 6 m ( 19 @.@ 7 ft ) length and 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) height , and weigh up to 2 tonnes ( 2 @.@ 0 long tons ; 2 @.@ 2 short tons ) . It was the first ceratopsid dinosaur discovered in China , and the only ceratopsid known from Asia . All other centrosaurines , and all chasmosaurines , are known from fossils discovered in North America , except for possibly Turanoceratops . Sinoceratops is also significant because it is one of the largest known centrosaurines , and is much larger than any other known basal members of this group . 
 Sinoceratops was discovered in the Xingezhuang Formation , which was deposited during the late Cretaceous . It lived alongside <unk> , saurolophines , and tyrannosaurines . The most common creature in the formation was Shantungosaurus , to which most of the material has been assigned . The animals living alongside Sinoceratops and Shantungosaurus were Zhuchengceratops , <unk> , and Zhuchengtyrannus . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The genus name Sinoceratops means " Chinese horned face " , and is derived from the word <unk> referring to China from Latin Sina , the country of its discovery , and the Greek words <unk> ( κέρας ) meaning " horn " , and ops ( <unk> ) meaning " face " . Sinoceratops was described and named by paleontologist Xu Xing and colleagues , in 2010 . The type species is Sinoceratops <unk> . The specific name refers to the location of its discovery , the city of Zhucheng which also financed the excavations . 
 = = Description = = 
 Sinoceratops was a larger ceratopsian ornithischian , with an estimated length of about 6 metres ( 19 @.@ 7 ft ) , weight of 2 tonnes ( 2 @.@ 0 long tons ; 2 @.@ 2 short tons ) , and height of about 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) . Thomas R. Holtz Jr. estimated its length at 7 metres ( 23 ft ) and weight at 2 @.@ 3 tonnes ( 2 @.@ 3 long tons ; 2 @.@ 5 short tons ) , the weight of a rhinoceros . It has a short , hooked horn on its nose ( called a nasal horn ) , no horns above its eyes ( brow horns ) , and a short neck frill with a series of forward @-@ curving <unk> that gave the frill a crown @-@ like appearance . Inside this row of <unk> there is a series of low knobs on the top of the frill , which are not seen in any other horned dinosaur . Sinoceratops is a member of the short @-@ frilled ceratopsids , the Centrosaurinae . <unk> specimen ZCDM <unk> consists of a partial skull with most elements of the skull roof and partial braincase . The skull of Sinoceratops is estimated to be 180 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 ft ) long making it one of the largest known centrosaurine skulls . 
 = = = Distinguishing anatomical features = = = 
 Features that differentiate an animal from most or all others are called a diagnosis . Some , but not all , of the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies . An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism . 
 According to Xu ( 2010 ) , Sinoceratops can be distinguished based on the following diagnostic characteristics : there are at least ten robust , strongly curved <unk> processes along the rear margin of the combined parietals , while at the same time at least four <unk> processes on the combined squamosals are present ; there is a large accessory fenestra in front of the antorbital fenestra ( differing from all other known centrosaurines ) ; the external margin of the parietals is only weakly undulating ( differing from all other known centrosaurines ) ; and the presence of broad @-@ based epoccipitals ( differing from all other known centrosaurines ) . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 The holotype specimen ZCDM <unk> , consisting of a partial skull , including a braincase , was in the summer of 2008 recovered at the Xingezhuang Formation of the <unk> Group in Shandong , China . The specimen was collected in fluvial sediments that were deposited during the Campanian @-@ Maastrichtian stages of the Cretaceous period , approximately 72 – 66 million years ago . Two other specimens have been recovered from the same formation . Specimen ZCDM <unk> is a partial skull that consists of the skull roof and most of the braincase , and ZCDM <unk> represents a partial braincase . 
 The discovery was significant , because it represented the first ceratopsid known from China , and possibly the only ceratopsid from Asia . The only other possible Asian ceratopsid is Turanoceratops , but recently , its identification as a ceratopsid has been questioned . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Sinoceratops was assigned to the taxon Centrosaurinae , as a basal member by Xu et al . ( 2010 ) based on characteristics present in the skull . Sinoceratops bears several characteristics that resemble features in chasmosaurines , blurring the distinction between the Centrosaurinae and Chasmosaurinae . According to Xu e.a. the basal position of Sinoceratops indicates that <unk> originated in Asia . Sinoceratops however , shares a number of features with advanced centrosaurines such as Centrosaurus and Styracosaurus that are not seen in primitive centrosaurines like <unk> , including a well @-@ developed nose horn and reduced brow horns . The implication might be that this genus represents a lineage that invaded Asia from North America through Beringia . 
 The cladogram below follows the phylogenetic analysis performed by Sampson et al . ( 2013 ) , and the clade names within Centrosaurinae follow Fiorillo & <unk> ( 2012 ) . 
 = = Paleoecology = = 
 Sinoceratops is known from the Xingezhuang Formation of southern China . It is known from skull material . Alongside it , in the formation , lived Shantungosaurus , a very common hadrosaurid to which most of the material has been assigned , Zhuchengtyrannus , an Asian tyrannosaurid related to Tarbosaurus , Zhuchengceratops , an Asian leptoceratopsid , and <unk> , a possible older individual of Shantungosaurus . Other possible remains have been assigned to <unk> , a probable junior synonym of Shantungosaurus , and material tentatively assigned to Tyrannosaurus . 
 = Kingdom of Nri = 
 The Kingdom of Nri ( Igbo : ' Ọ ̀ <unk> <unk> ' ) ( 948 – 1911 ) was the West African medieval region in southeastern Nigeria , a subgroup of the Igbo speaking people . The Kingdom of Nri was unusual in the history of world government in that its leader exercised no military power over his subjects . The kingdom existed as a sphere of religious and political influence over a third of Igboland , and was administered by a priest @-@ king called as an Eze Nri . The Eze Nri managed trade and diplomacy on behalf of the Igbo people , and possessed divine authority in religious matters . 
 The kingdom was a haven for all those who had been rejected in their communities and also a place where slaves were set free from their bondage . Nri expanded through converts gaining neighboring communities ' allegiance , not by force . Nri 's royal founder , Eri , is said to be a ' sky being ' that came down to earth and then established civilization . One of the better @-@ known remnants of the Nri civilization is its art , as manifested in the Igbo Ukwu bronze items . 
 Nri 's culture had permanently influenced the Northern and Western Igbo , especially through religion and taboos . British colonialism , the Atlantic slave trade and the rise of Bini and Igala kingdoms , contributed to the decline of the Nri Kingdom . The Nri Kingdom is going through a cultural revival . 
 = = History = = 
 The Nri kingdom is considered to be a center of Igbo culture . Nri and Aguleri , where the Umueri @-@ Igbo creation myth originates , are in the territory of the <unk> @-@ Eri clan , who trace their lineages back to the patriarchal king @-@ figure , Eri . Eri 's origins are unclear , though he has been described as a " sky being " sent by Chukwu ( God ) . He is credited with first giving societal order to the people of Anambra . Nri history may be divided into six main periods : the pre @-@ Eri period ( before 948 CE ) , the Eri period ( 948 — 1041 CE ) , migration and unification ( 1042 — 1252 CE ) , the heyday of Nri hegemony ( 1253 — 1679 CE ) , hegemony decline and collapse ( 1677 — 1936 CE ) and the Socio @-@ culture Revival ( 1974 — Present ) . 
 = = = Foundation = = = 
 Archaeological evidence suggests that Nri hegemony in Igboland may go back as far as the 9th century , and royal burials have been unearthed dating to at least the 10th century . Eri , the god @-@ like founder of Nri , is believed to have settled the region around 948 , with other related Igbo cultures following after in the 13th century . The first eze Nri ( King of Nri ) , Ìfikuánim , follows directly after him . According to Igbo oral tradition , his reign started in 1043 . At least one historian puts Ìfikuánim 's reign much later , around 1225 CE . 
 In 1911 , the names of 19 eze Nri were recorded , but the list is not easily converted into chronological terms because of long <unk> between installations . Tradition held that at least seven years would pass upon the death of the eze Nri before a successor could be determined ; the interregnum served as a period of divination of signs from the deceased eze Nri , who would communicate his choice of successor from beyond the grave in the seven or more years ensuing upon his death . Regardless of the actual date , this period marks the beginning of Nri kingship as a centralized institution . 
 = = = Zenith and fall = = = 
 Colonization and expansion of the kingdom of Nri was achieved by sending mbùríchi , or converts , to other settlements . Allegiance to the eze Nri was obtained not by military force but through ritual oath . Religious authority was vested in the local king , and ties were maintained by traveling mbùríchi . By the 14th century , Nri influence extended well beyond the nuclear northern Igbo region to Igbo settlements on the west bank of the Niger and communities affected by the Benin Empire . There is strong evidence to indicate Nri influence well beyond the Igbo region to Benin and Southern Igala areas like <unk> . At its height , the kingdom of Nri had influence over roughly a third of Igboland and beyond . It reached its furthest extent between 1100 and 1400 . 
 Nri 's hegemony over much of Igboland lasted from the reigns of the fourth eze Nri to that of the ninth . After that , patterns of conflict emerged that existed from the tenth to the fourteenth reigns , which probably reflected the monetary importance of the slave trade . Outside @-@ world influence was not going to be halted by native religious doctrine in the face of the slave trade 's economic opportunities . Nri hegemony declined after the start of the 18th century . Still , it survived in a much @-@ reduced , and weakened form until 1911 . In 1911 , British troops forced the reigning eze Nri to renounce the ritual power of the religion known as the <unk> , ending the kingdom of Nri as a political power . 
 = = Government = = 
 Nearly all communities in Igboland were organized according to a title system . Igbo west of the Niger River and on its east bank developed kingship , governing states such as <unk> , Onitsha and <unk> , their title Obi . The Igbo of Nri , on the other hand , developed a state system sustained by ritual power . 
 The Kingdom of Nri was a religio @-@ polity , a sort of theocratic state , that developed in the central heartland of the Igbo region . The Nri had a taboo symbolic code with six types . These included human ( such as twins ) , animal , object , temporal , behavioral , speech and place taboos . The rules regarding these taboos were used to educate and govern Nri 's subjects . This meant that , while certain Igbo may have lived under different formal administration , all followers of the Igbo religion had to abide by the rules of the faith and obey its representative on earth , the eze Nri . 
 An important symbol among the Nri religion was the <unk> , a tender palm frond , used to <unk> and restrain . It was used as protection for traveling delegations or safeguarding certain objects ; a person or object carrying an <unk> twig was considered protected . The influence of these symbols and institutions extended well beyond Nri , and this unique Igbo socio @-@ political system proved capable of controlling areas wider than villages or towns . 
 For many centuries , the people within the Nri hegemony were committed to peace . This religious pacifism was rooted in a belief that violence was an abomination which polluted the earth . Instead , the eze Nri could declare a form of excommunication from the <unk> Nri against those who violated specific taboos . Members of the <unk> could isolate entire communities via this form of ritual siege . 
 = = = Eze Nri = = = 
 The eze Nri was the title of the ruler of Nri with ritual and mystic ( but not military ) power . He was a ritual figure rather than a king in the traditional sense . The eze Nri was chosen after an interregnum period while the electors waited for supernatural powers to manifest in the new eze Nri . He was installed after a symbolic journey to Aguleri on the Anambra River . The authorities must be notified prior to commencement of this journey to obtain the <unk> @-@ eze , the royal scepter . There , the process of paying of homage to all the necessary shrines / deities in Aguleri by the new Eze Nri , visitation to <unk> tomb at Ama @-@ <unk> , collection of <unk> , purification of the virgin boy to receive the clay from the chosen diver from <unk> in Aguleri , sitting on the throne of Eri at Obu @-@ <unk> in Aguleri by the new Eze @-@ Nri before going back to Nri on the seventh day to undergo a symbolic burial and exhumation , then finally be anointed with white clay , a symbol of purity . Upon his death , he was buried seated in a wood @-@ lined chamber . The eze Nri was in all aspects a divine ruler . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 While the eze Nri lived relatively secluded from his followers , he employed a group of Jesuit @-@ like officials called ndi Nri . These were ritual specialists , easily identifiable by facial scarifications or ichi , who traveled with ritual staffs of peace in order to purify the earth from human crimes . The ndi Nri exercised authority over wide areas of Igboland and had the power to install the next eze Nri . 
 Areas under Nri influence , called Odinani Nri , were open to Ndi Nri traveling within them to perform rituals and ensure bountiful harvest or restore harmony in local affairs . Local men within the <unk> Nri could represent the eze Nri and share his moral authority by purchasing a series of ranked titles called <unk> and <unk> . Men with these titles were known as mbùríchi and became an extension of the Nri 's religio @-@ political system . They controlled the means for agriculture and determined guilt or innocence in disputes . 
 Both the Ndi Nri priests and mbùríchi nobility belonged to the <unk> , the right hand . The <unk> god was one dedicated to achievement and power , both of which were associated with the right hand . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Nri maintained its vast authority well into the 16th century . The peace mandated by the Nri religion and enforced by the presence of the mbùríchi allowed trade to flourish . Items such as horses , which did not survive in tsetse fly @-@ infested Nri , and seashells , which would have to be transported a long ways due to Nri 's distance from the coast , have been found depicted in Nri 's bronze . A Nri dignitary was unearthed with ivory , also indicating a wealth in trade existed among the Nri . Another source of income would have been the income brought back by traveling mbùríchi . 
 Unlike in many African economies of the period , Nri did not practice slave ownership or trade . Certain parts of the Nri domain , did not recognize slavery and served as a sanctuary . After the selection of the tenth eze Nri , any slave who stepped foot on Nri soil was considered free . 
 Nri had a network of internal and external trade , which its economy was partly based on . Other aspects of Nri 's economy were hunting and agriculture . Eri , the sky being , was the first to ' count ' the days by their names , eke , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , which were the names of their four governing spirits . Eri revealed the opportunity of time to the Igbo , who would use the days for exchanging goods and knowledge . 
 = = Culture = = 
 = = = Art = = = 
 Igbo @-@ Ukwu , a part of the kingdom about eleven miles south from Nri itself , practiced bronze casting techniques using elephant @-@ head motifs . The bronzes of Igbo @-@ Ukwu are often compared to those of Ife and Benin , but they come from a different tradition and are associated with the eze Nri . In fact , the earliest body of Nigerian bronzes has been unearthed in Igbo territory to the east of the Niger River at a site dated to the 9th century , making it ( and , by extension , Nri ) older than Ife . 
 It appears that Nri had an artistic as well as religious influence on the lower Niger . Sculptures found there are bronze like those at Igbo @-@ Ukwu . The great sculptures of the Benin Empire , by contrast , were almost always brass with , over time , increasingly greater percentages of zinc added . 
 The bronzes of Igbo @-@ Ukwu pay special attention to detail depicting birds , snails , chameleons , and other natural aspects of the world such as a hatching bird . Other pieces include gourds and vessels which were often given handles . The pieces are so fine that small insects were included on the surfaces of some while others have what looks like bronze wires decorated around them . None of these extra details were made separately ; the bronzes were all one piece . Igbo @-@ Ukwu gave the evidence of an early bronze casting tradition in Nri . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 Religious beliefs were central to the Kingdom of Nri . Nri oral tradition states that a bounty of yams and <unk> could be given to the eze Nri , while blessings were given in return . It was believed that Nri 's influence and bountiful amount of food was a reward for the ruler 's blessings . Above all , Nri was a holy land for those Igbo who followed its edicts . It served as a place where sins and taboos could be absolved just by entering it . Even Igbo living far from the center of power would send abnormal children to Nri for ritual cleansing rather than having them killed , as was sometimes the case for dwarfs or children who cut their top teeth before their lower teeth . 
 Nri people believed that the sun was the dwelling place of <unk> ( Light ) and Agbala ( Fertility ) . Agbala was the collective spirit of all holy beings ( human and nonhuman ) . Agbala was the perfect agent of Chukwu or <unk> ( the Creator God ) and chose its human and nonhuman agents only by their merit ; it knew no politics . It transcended religion , culture and gender , and worked with the humble and the truthful . They believed <unk> , The Light , to be the symbol of human perfection that all must seek and Agbala was entrusted to lead man there . 
 = = Tradition = = 
 Nri tradition was based on the concept of peace , truth and harmony . It spread this ideology through the ritualistic <unk> traders who maintained Nri influence by traveling and spreading Nri practices such as the " <unk> " to other communities . These men were identified through the ritual facial scarifications they had undergone . Nri believed in cleansing and purifying the earth ( a supernatural force to Nri called Ana and <unk> ) of human abominations and crimes . 
 = = = Year counting ceremony = = = 
 The <unk> Aro festival ( counting of the year ) was a royal festival the eze Nri used to maintain his influence over the communities under his authority . Each of these communities sent representatives to pay tribute during the ceremony to show their loyalty . At the end the Eze Nri would give the representatives a yam medicine and a blessing of fertility for their communities . The festival was seen as a day of peace and certain activities were prohibited such as the planting of crops before the day of the ceremony , the splitting of wood and unnecessary noise . <unk> Aro was a regular event that gave an opportunity for the eze to speak directly to all the communities under him . 
 = = = Nri scarification = = = 
 Ritual scarification in Nri was known as Ichi of which there are two styles ; the Nri style , and the <unk> style . In the Nri style , the carved line ran from the center of the forehead down to the chin . A second line ran across the face , from the right cheek to the left . This was repeated to obtain a pattern meant to imitate the rays of the sun . In the <unk> style , circles and semicircular patterns are added to the initial incisions to represent the moon . These scarifications were given to the representatives of the eze Nri ; the mbùríchi . The scarification 's were Nri 's way of honoring the sun that they worshiped and was a form of ritual purification . 
 <unk> had its origins in Nri mythology . Nri , the son of Eri who established the town of Nri , was said to have pleaded to Chukwu ( the Great God ) because of hunger . Chukwu then ordered him to cut off his first son 's and daughter 's heads and plant them , creating a ' blood bond ' between the Igbo and the earth deity , Ana . Before doing so , Nri was ordered to mark ichi onto their two foreheads . Coco yam , a crop managed by females , sprang from his daughter 's head , and yam , the Igbo peoples ' staple crop , sprung from his son 's head ; Chukwu had taught Nri plant domestication . From this , the eze Nri 's first son and daughter were required to undergo scarification 's seven days after birth , with the eze Nri 's daughter being the only female to receive ichi . Nri , the son of Eri , also gained knowledge of the yam medicine ( <unk> ji ) . People from other Igbo communities made pilgrimages to Nri in order to receive this knowledge received in exchange for annual tributes .

 Bound for Glory ( 2005 ) was a professional wrestling pay @-@ per @-@ view ( PPV ) event produced by the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ( TNA ) promotion that took place on October 23 , 2005 at the TNA Impact ! Zone in Orlando , Florida . It was the first event under the Bound for Glory name and tenth event in the 2005 TNA PPV schedule . The show was promoted as TNA 's premiere PPV event and their equivalent to the rival World Wrestling Entertainment 's ( WWE ) WrestleMania . Ten professional wrestling matches and one pre @-@ show match were featured on the card , three of which involved championships . 
 The main event was for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship , in which champion Jeff Jarrett fought the challenger Rhino with Tito Ortiz as Special Guest Referee . The match was originally Jarrett versus Kevin Nash with Ortiz as referee , however Nash was not cleared to wrestle due to a medical emergency . A Ten @-@ Man Gauntlet match was held to determine Nash 's replacement , which Rhino won . Rhino then went on to defeat Jarrett to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at the show . The TNA X Division Championship was defended in a Thirty @-@ Minute Iron Man match by champion A.J. Styles against the challenger Christopher Daniels at the event . Styles defeated Daniels one fall to zero falls to retain the championship . Monster 's Ball II was held at Bound for Glory , in which Rhino defeated Abyss , Jeff Hardy , and Sabu . The NWA World Tag Team Championship was successfully defended by America 's Most Wanted ( Chris Harris and James Storm ) against The Naturals ( Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens ) at the show . Chris Sabin , Matt Bentley , and Petey Williams competed in a Three Way Ultimate X match to determine the number @-@ one contender to the TNA X Division Championship also on the card . Williams won the encounter to earn a future title match . 
 Bound for Glory is remembered for Nash being removed from the main event and for Rhino 's impromptu championship victory . Rhino becoming champion was ranked by TNA as the 21st greatest moment in the company 's history . The event was dedicated to Reggie Lisowski , who died the night prior . Bob Kapur of the professional wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer rated the show a 9 out of 10 , higher than the 2006 edition . It also received a higher rating by the Canadian Online Explorer than WWE 's WrestleMania 21 PPV event held on April 3 , 2005 , which had been given a 5 out of 10 by Dale Plummer and Nick Tylwalk .

 Bound for Glory was scheduled to feature nine professional wrestling matches and one pre @-@ show match , however , due to a medical emergency TNA was forced to change the main event of the show , resulting in ten overall matches . Each of these matches involved wrestlers from pre @-@ existing scripted feuds and storylines portraying villains , heroes , or less distinguishable characters ; these scripted events built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches . 
 The main storyline heading into Bound for Glory revolved around the NWA World Heavyweight Championship . At TNA 's previous PPV event Unbreakable on September 11 , then @-@ champion Raven retained the title in a Raven 's Rules match against Rhino . On September 15 , Jeff Jarrett defeated Raven with help from America 's Most Wanted ( Chris Harris and James Storm ; AMW ) and Scott D 'Amore at a Border City Wrestling event to win the championship . On the October 1 episode of TNA 's television program TNA Impact ! , Jarrett announced a partnership with AMW and D 'Amore before the 3Live Kru ( Konnan , Ron Killings , and B.G. James ) interrupted them . Team 3D ( Brother Devon and Brother Ray ) then made their TNA debut , followed by the TNA return of Kevin Nash , who challenged Jarrett to a title defense at Bound for Glory . Jarrett and Nash previously fought at TNA 's Against All Odds PPV event on February 13 , which Jarrett won to retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship . On the October 8 episode of Impact ! , NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zbyszko announced that the match between Nash and Jarrett was official and set for Bound for Glory with an added stipulation . Mixed martial arts fighter Tito Ortiz was then revealed as the Special Guest Referee for the bout . This was Ortiz 's second time refereeing an NWA World Heavyweight Championship match in TNA , with his first being the NWA World Heavyweight Championship bout at TNA 's Hard Justice PPV event on May 15 . 
 At Unbreakable , the TNA X Division Championship was defended in a Three Way match by then @-@ champion Christopher Daniels against A.J. Styles and Samoa Joe . Styles won the match and the title at the event . This led to TNA promoting a Thirty @-@ Minute Iron Man match between Styles and Daniels for the title at Bound for Glory . This was a rematch between the two that took place at Against All Odds . Other events that lead to this match included the 2005 TNA Super X Cup Tournament , which caused the Three Way match at Unbreakable , and Daniels defeating Styles in an Ultimate X Challenge match at TNA 's Destination X PPV event on March 13 to become champion . On the October 8 episode of Impact ! , Daniels issued a challenge to Styles to pick three wrestlers on the roster and he would defeat all of them in fifteen minutes or less . Styles accepted the challenge and chose Shark Boy , Sonjay Dutt , and himself . Daniels defeated both Shark Boy and Dutt before the time @-@ limit expired , but did not defeat Styles in time on the October 15 episode of Impact ! . 
 There were several other matches promoted for the show . The most significant of these were a Four Way Monster 's Ball match , a Three Way Ultimate X match , and an NWA World Tag Team Championship bout . The Monster 's Ball match , promoted as Monster 's Ball II , was announced in late @-@ September . The participants advertised for the bout were Abyss , Rhino , Jeff Hardy , and Sabu . The only recent storylines connected to this bout included Abyss and Sabu being involved in a rivalry for an undisclosed reason , leading to a match at Unbreakable . Sabu had also been involved in a minor feud with Rhino , by teaming with Raven to face the team of Rhino and Jarrett in a match at TNA 's Sacrifice PPV event on August 14 . The Ultimate X match was announced at Unbreakable after a bout pitting Chris Sabin against Petey Williams . There , Matt Bentley returned to TNA and issued an Ultimate X open challenge to the pair to take place at Bound for Glory . TNA later scheduled the match , with the winner becoming number @-@ one contender to the TNA X Division Championship . After this , the three promoted the encounter by interfering in each other 's Impact ! matches . On the April 29 episode of Impact ! , The Naturals ( Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens ) defeated then @-@ NWA World Tag Team Champions AMW to become the new champions . This led to a rematch at Hard Justice , where The Naturals retained the title . On the October 15 episode of Impact ! , Zbyszko declared that The Naturals would defend the NWA World Tag Team Championship against AMW the following week . AMW reclaimed the championship from The Naturals on the October 22 episode of Impact ! . Afterwards , TNA added a rematch between the two teams for the title to the Bound for Glory card .

Liger gained a near @-@ fall on Joe at 6 minutes . Afterwards , Joe slammed Liger in the mat back @-@ first with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver . He then followed by applying his Coquina Clutch submission hold . As the referee waited for Liger to submit , he became limp , causing the referee to lift and drop Liger 's arm three times , resulting in the knock @-@ out victory for Joe . 
 The Diamonds in the Rough ( Simon Diamond , David Young , and Elix Skipper ) versus Apolo , Sonny Siaki , and Shark Boy in a Six Man Tag Team match followed . The duration of this contest was 7 minutes and 3 seconds . Young pinned Siaki to win the encounter for his team after forcing Siaki against the mat with a spinebuster .

James ) Team Canada were accompanied by Scott D 'Amore . At 6 minutes and 8 seconds , Young gained the pinfall victory for his team on James , after Roode hit James with a hockey stick while the referee was preoccupied . 
 The Three Way Ultimate X match was next to determine the number @-@ one contender to the TNA X Division Championship . Petey Williams , Chris Sabin , and Matt Bentley were the participants in this encounter , which spanned 13 minutes and 13 seconds . Bentley was accompanied by Traci to the ring . In an Ultimate X match , ropes are hung above the ring in a manner to form an " X " , in which the objective is to climb the ropes and retrieve an object at the center of the " X " . In this case , the object was a giant red " X " . Sabin scaled the ropes above the ring mid @-@ way through the match , before Bentley jumped up and tackled him to the mat below . The result of this impact caused the " X " to fall off the ropes . TNA officials then had to re @-@ hang it while the match continued . Later , Bentley and Sabin attempted to retrieve the " X " again , only to cause it to fall once more . This time Williams was standing below and caught it ; the referee declared Williams the winner , thus becoming the number @-@ one contender to the TNA X Division Championship . 
 The NWA World Tag Team Championship was defended by AMW , who were accompanied by Gail Kim , against The Naturals in the sixth bout on the card . The duration of the contest was 10 minutes and 37 seconds . Douglas ' head was busted open during the match , causing him to bleed from the forehead throughout . The Naturals got a two @-@ count on Harris after they performed AMW 's signature Death Sentence maneuver on him by slamming him back @-@ first into the mat while jumping on his throat .

AMW followed by performing the Death Sentence on Stevens and pinning him to remain champions .

 Monster 's Ball II was held at Bound for Glory . Rhino , Abyss , Sabu , and Jeff Hardy all participated in the match . James Mitchell accompanied Abyss to the ring . In a Monster 's Ball match , pinfalls and submissions count anywhere . There are no disqualifications or count @-@ outs and weapons are supplied and welcomed . It is called Monster 's Ball because in the storyline each wrestler has supposedly been locked in a dark room for the preceding 24 hours without food or water . In the very beginning , Sabu started bleeding from his right eye , while Hardy had blood coming out of a cut on his arm . Mid @-@ way through the bout , Rhino also started to bleed . Hardy laid Abyss on a table and then ascended to the top of the Bound for Glory set . He then jumped off in a somersault and landed on Abyss . Eventually both Abyss and Hardy recovered , leading to Rhino tackling Abyss through a table with his signature Gore maneuver . Afterwards , Rhino drove Hardy 's head into the mat with his signature Rhino Driver maneuver from the second ring rope and followed with a pin to win the match at 12 minutes and 20 seconds . After this match , Larry Zbyszko announced that a Ten @-@ Man Gauntlet match would be held later in the show to determine who would face Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship . 
 The TNA X Division Championship was defended by A.J. Styles against Christopher Daniels in a Thirty @-@ Minute Iron Man match . In an Iron Man match , a time @-@ limit is set for a particular amount , in this case thirty @-@ minutes . The match will continue until time runs out and the competitor who gained the most falls when time runs out by pinfall , submission , count @-@ out , or disqualification is the overall winner of the bout . Daniels attempted to get Styles to submit early in the bout by using his Koji Clutch submission hold . Later on , Daniels earned a two @-@ count after landing on Styles with his signature <unk> aerial maneuver . Styles also gained a near @-@ fall by holding Daniels on his shoulders before twisting him off and slamming him to the mat for what he calls a Rack Bomb . With only 13 seconds left in the match and the score still tied zero to zero , Styles performed his signature Styles Clash maneuver and followed with the pin . As time ran out , Styles had the most falls thus retaining the TNA X Division Championship . 
 TNA then held an impromptu Ten @-@ Man Gauntlet match to determine Kevin Nash 's replacement in the main event . This was the ninth match of the show with a duration of 14 minutes and 12 seconds . The participants for the match were Abyss , A.J. Styles , Jeff Hardy , Kip James , Lance Hoyt , Monty Brown , Rhino , Ron Killings , Sabu , and Samoa Joe . The rules for a Gauntlet match are as follows : two wrestlers start the match with another entering at 2 minute intervals . The objective of the match is to eliminate opponents by throwing them over the top rope and down to the floor . The last wrestler left in the ring is the winner of the contest . The last two wrestlers were Abyss and Rhino . Rhino won the match after lifting Abyss over the top rope and down to the floor . 
 The main event was for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship , in which then @-@ champion Jeff Jarrett was pitted against Rhino with Tito Ortiz as Special Guest Referee . Jarrett was accompanied to the ring by Gail Kim . A casket was positioned by the ring , as in storyline Jarrett planned to bury his opponent after defeating them . During the match , Kim distracted Ortiz allowing Jarrett to bash Rhino over the head with a guitar for a two @-@ count . AMW then came to ringside to distract Ortiz and slide Jarrett another guitar . As Jarrett attempted to hit Rhino with the guitar , Rhino countered by crashing into Jarrett with his Gore maneuver for the pinfall victory at 5 minutes and 30 seconds to become the new NWA World Heavyweight Champion . After the contest , AMW , Jarrett , and Team Canada attacked Rhino and placed him in the casket . Team 3D came to his defense , as well as the <unk> .

 Wade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter reviewed the show . He felt that Rhino versus Jeff Jarrett was " not much of a main event , but it followed the old rule of having the replacement babyface wrestler in a main event always win so fans don 't feel ripped off . " As for the Iron Man match for the TNA X Division Championship between A.J. Styles and Christopher Daniels , Keller expressed that it was a " very good match " that had a " nice change of pattern with just one fall during the match , but ultimately the first two @-@ thirds wasn 't particularly exciting or engrossing enough to top their previous Iron Man match . " He went on to say that Styles and Daniels " were great in the final minutes at conveying sheer exhaustion mixed with desire to win " and that they " had a tough act to follow with the stunt filled Monsters Ball . " As for the Monster 's Ball match , Keller said it was a " good one " but it was " tough to go to four stars for a match that includes so many huge spots and little long @-@ term selling , but it 's also hard not to rate it this high when there 's a potential " big spot of the year " and a crowd chanting " That was awesome ! " afterward . " Meanwhile , Keller felt the World Tag Team Championship match was " average " and that it " just didn 't feel like a major PPV title match . " " Just a <unk> fest with a lousy ending . The highspots were good , but it was far from a standout Ultimate X match . The " can 't miss " match just missed based on not fulfilling high expectations , " is what Keller had to say regarding the Ultimate X match . As for Jushin Liger versus Samoa Joe , Keller believed it was an " above average match of below average length , " but that it was " disappointing they didn 't go longer . " 
 James Caldwell , also of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter , reviewed the show . He felt differently from both Keller and Kapur , as he stated that Bound for Glory overall was a " bad PPV . " He believed the main event was a " cluster , " the Gauntlet match was " pointless , " and the Monster 's Ball match was the " same ole ' <unk> match with no long @-@ term selling and too many highspots that didn 't mean much at the end of the day . " He called the NWA World Tag Team Championship match " ridiculous " and the TNA X Division Champion number @-@ one contender the " worst Ultimate X match in TNA history . " He did , however , praise the Iron Man match stating it was " definitely the match of the night with some good wrestling holds and believable <unk> . " He also enjoyed the Liger versus Joe bout , say it was a " good start to the show even if it was shorter than expected . "

 Perry 's decision to write " E.T. " came after its beat was accidentally played during a recording session she had with Dr. Luke , Max Martin , and Ammo . It was originally intended for American hip hop group Three 6 Mafia . However , after hearing it , Perry chose to work with the track . She told MTV News : " I heard it and I always knew I wanted to write this futuristic , <unk> song , and they pulled it up and I was like , ' Wait , I can wrap my head around this . I know this seems like a long shot , but I think I have the perfect material to put on top of this sound . ' And I did , and it really worked out perfectly . " 
 On August 17 , 2010 , the solo version of the song was released as a promotional single from Teenage Dream . In December 2010 , Perry asked fans through Twitter to help her select the album 's fourth single . On December 13 , 2010 , she tweeted , " Thanks for all your great suggestions for the next single today ! " and " Your voice has been heard ! We 're on the same page .

Darryl Sterdan of the QMI Agency noted the song uses the " stomp @-@ stomp @-@ clap " beat from Queen 's " We Will Rock You " ( 1977 ) , while AllMusic 's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted similarities to productions helmed by Ryan Tedder . 
 According to Perry , the song is about " falling in love with a foreigner " . James Montgomery of MTV News also noted that Perry sings about a " lover from different dimension " . For its single release , the song was reworked to feature two verses from Kanye West , in which he raps about " <unk> " . " E.T. " opens with the first rap verse by West containing the lines " I got a dirty mind / I got filthy ways / I 'm trying to bathe my Ape in your milky way / They <unk> ' me an alien / A big @-@ headed astronaut " . Then , using metaphors about extraterrestrials , Perry sings , " You 're not like the others / Futuristic lover / Different DNA " . The chorus has Perry addressing her lover : " Kiss me , kiss me / <unk> me with your love and / Fill me with your poison " , claiming to be " ready for abduction " . West contributes a second verse to the track , before Perry 's final refrain , with heavily auto @-@ tuned vocals : " I know a bar out in Mars / Where they driving spaceships instead of cars " .

 Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly felt that Perry shows strength on the song , comparing its sound to a combination of American rock musicians Lita Ford and Trent Reznor .

Ben Kaplan from The National Post lauded the track as a " great duet " , praising the vocals of both performers . Speaking for West 's contribution on the track Brad Wete from Entertainment Weekly noted that the song was improved from a male perspective . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic commented that Perry " replicates Ryan Tedder 's glassy robotic alienation on ' E.T. ' , but tellingly avoids ripping off Lady Gaga " . 
 Matthew Cole of Slant Magazine disliked the single 's " inscrutability " and said that song 's backing track was reminiscent of t.A.T.u. ' s " All the Things She Said " . Jason Richards from Now called the song " awkward " and Sputnikmusic 's Rudy Clapper dismissed its attempt at a more mature sound , calling it " cheesy " . PopMatters ' staff writer Steve Leftridge called the song " neither strong nor edgy nor clever nor sonically interesting enough to lend any genuine credibility to Perry as a serious artist with anything to actually say . " Amos Barshad of New York magazine felt West 's alien metaphors went into jarring , misogynistic directions . Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club gave the song a C- , saying that while its lyrical content was " borderline @-@ embarrassing " , it did earn " a couple bonus points for showing a relatively darker side " of Perry , while A.V. Club editor Steven Hyden was more critical of the both Perry 's and West 's lyrics , saying that " borderline @-@ embarrassing " was too generous and that " the whole concept of the song is so beyond either side of sanity " that it was impossible to grade .

 = = Plot = = 
 Leslie ( Amy Poehler ) feels powerless at work because a policy by Chris ( Rob Lowe ) forbidding workplace romances is preventing her from dating Ben ( Adam Scott ) . Meanwhile , now that he is staying in Pawnee permanently , Ben decides to move out of the motel where he has been living . Andy ( Chris Pratt ) and April ( Aubrey Plaza ) offer him a spare room in their house , since their previous roommate moved out and left the house to them . Although the two have been living by themselves for only a week , the house is a complete mess with no everyday items like plates or utensils available . Ben decides to teach a reluctant Andy and April how to properly live like adults . 
 Meanwhile , the parks employees attend an art show exhibiting paintings that will later be hung in government buildings . Jerry ( Jim O 'Heir ) displays his painting of the fictional topless centaur Greek goddess <unk> , which looks exactly like Leslie . Jerry explains he subconsciously painted Leslie while thinking about powerful women . Instead of being embarrassed , Leslie feels empowered by the painting . Tom , however , is humiliated because a pot @-@ bellied cherub in the painting shares his likeness . The next day , local conservative activist Marcia Langman ( Darlene Hunt ) compares the painting to bestiality , deems it unsuitable for a government setting and demands it be destroyed . 
 Leslie goes on the news program " Ya ' Heard ? with Perd " to rouse public support for the painting by portraying it as a depiction of a powerful woman . However , she is undermined when reporter Perd Hapley ( Jay Jackson ) also has on pornographic film actress Brandi Maxxxx ( Mara Marini ) , who defends the painting by comparing it to pornography . Chris convenes a meeting of the Pawnee Public Arts Commission to rule on whether the painting is acceptable . Despite Leslie 's eloquent defense , the commission fears the nudity is offensive and decides to destroy it instead of risking public backlash . Leslie instead steals the painting and runs away . Meanwhile , after cleaning up around the house , Ben gives Andy and April money to buy common household items . Although they almost waste their money on frivolous items , Andy insists they need to take Ben 's advice . April admits she is afraid of growing up because she does not want them to lose their unique personalities , but Andy assures her they will not change . 
 Chris angrily demands Leslie bring the painting to city hall the next day to be destroyed . When Leslie reluctantly agrees to do so , Jerry expresses disappointment that she would give up so easily . Feeling empowered again , Leslie asks Jerry to quickly paint another , similar painting , only this time with Tom as the centaur . Leslie tells Marcia the new painting is the original one but painted over . With no more nudity in the painting , a frustrated Marcia gives up her quest to have the painting destroyed . Tom is delighted with the painting until he realizes that Jerry forgot to draw a penis on the centaur . Ben later confides to Andy he likes Leslie but is unable to ask her out because of Chris , but Andy tells him if they truly care about each other , then it will eventually happen . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Jerry 's Painting " was written by Norm Hiscock and directed by Dean Holland . During its original broadcast , the episode ran for an extended 40 minutes rather than the usual 30 minutes . The extra time was due to an extended episode of The Office that ran before Parks and Recreation : " Goodbye , Michael " , which featured the final appearance of Steve Carell as a regular cast member playing Michael Scott . " Jerry 's Painting " featured a guest appearance by Darlene Hunt as Marcia Langman , a member of the conservative group the Society for Family Stability Foundation . Hunt 's character has previously appeared in past Parks and Recreation episodes to object to Leslie 's actions : in the second season premiere " Pawnee Zoo " she condemned Leslie 's same @-@ sex wedding ceremony of two male penguins , and in the third season episode " Time Capsule " she argued against Leslie including the novel Twilight in a Pawnee time capsule because she felt it was anti @-@ Christian . " Jerry 's Painting " also featured Jay Jackson in his recurring role as Pawnee journalist Perd Hapley , and Mara Marini as Hapley 's guest , porn star Brandi Maxxxx .

 During one scene at the art show , a character named Orin stands in front of a blank canvas and stares straight ahead without moving . This style of art exhibition is similar to that of Marina Abramović , a Yugoslavian performance artist who sits or stands silently and immobile at some of her art exhibits . After seeing herself as a goddess in Jerry 's painting , Leslie starts responding when people nickname her Aphrodite , the Greek goddess of love , beauty and sexuality . While speaking to Ben , Tom describes his seduction ritual with women as turning the lights off with the Clapper , a sound @-@ activated electrical light switch , and then putting on music by Boyz II Men , an R & B vocal group . This was previously demonstrated in the second @-@ season finale " Freddy Spaghetti " , when the group 's song " On Bended Knee " was playing while Tom has his girlfriend at his apartment . 
 While stressing over Chris ' policy of not dating co @-@ workers , Ann offers to help Leslie relax by getting her a prescription for Paxil , an antidepressant drug . Ben gives Andy and April cash and instructs them to buy home products at Bed Bath & Beyond , a chain of domestic merchandise retail stores . While there , Andy and April instead start to purchase several " as seen on TV " items , including Shake Weight <unk> , Slap Chop kitchen gadgets and a Marshmallow Shooter . During the arts commission meeting , Tom describes himself as a " small , slender man " similar to actor Taye Diggs . In a different scene , Tom expresses anger that Jerry 's painting is " killing the Jay @-@ Z vibe " he has long been cultivating , a reference to the hip hop artist .

 " Jerry 's Painting " received generally positive reviews . Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis called the episode " one that may just have been the season 's best — and that ’ s saying something when a show is as consistent as this one " . She called the main plotline about the painting " brilliant " and said the subplot with Ben , April and Andy was so funny she hoped they had more pairings in the future . Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic called " Jerry 's Painting " one of the strongest episodes of the season , and said he enjoyed seeing Leslie 's character so empowered . McHatton also praised seeing April and Andy facing adulthood , writing , " It 's something many of us young adults go through and it was nice to see it reflected " in the characters . Scott Meslow of The Atlantic said the show demonstrated how Leslie Knope has developed into a strong and confident character since the " daffy , wide @-@ eyed dreamer " she was in the first season . He also praised the show 's " new funniest pairing " of Ben , April and Andy , and said the episode demonstrated that " even this late in the season , the show can still feel surprising and fresh " . 
 New York magazine writer Steve Kendell said " Jerry 's Painting " was an excellent episode , and that he appreciated seeing Leslie portrayed in a sexier and more confident way than previous episodes had . Joel Keller of TV Squad said the main story with Leslie was funny , but the subplot was even better . He said it showcased the deadpan comedic talents of Adam Scott , and that April and Andy continue to be an excellent pairing . The A.V. Club writer Claire Zulkey called the episode " a pretty simple episode that got funnier and more quotable as the episode rolled on " . She particularly praised Adam Scott 's performance , but said she did not look forward to the romantic pairing of Scott and Amy Poehler because she feels they lack chemistry . Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said the episode featured great scenes about government inaction and the way small @-@ time media can make a frenzy out of any minor thing . He also praised the subplot with April and Andy , which he said demonstrated how the two characters getting married hasn 't at all changed who they are . 
 Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com complimented the writers , who he said are able to make consistently strong episodes because they seem to have a perfect understanding of their characters . He also said " Jerry 's Painting " proved Ben 's character has comedic potential beyond being Leslie 's romantic interest . Zap2it writer Rick Porter said it was not the best of the season , but still " a very solid half @-@ hour of comedy " and that " the show 's batting average this season is remarkably high " . While Porter praised the main story , he said he found the subplot less entertaining , and did not believe April 's character would have acted the way she did or lived in such filthy conditions . Not all reviews were positive . Matt Fowler of IGN said the idea of Jerry subconsciously painting Leslie and Tom was " a bit too absurd " , and that the episode did not feature enough of Ron Swanson . Fowler also said he did not enjoy seeing the normally positive Chris taking on an authoritarian role . 
 = Exit ( U2 song ) = 
 " Exit " is a song by rock band U2 . It is the tenth track on their 1987 album The Joshua Tree . " Exit " was developed from a lengthy jam that was recorded in a single take and edited down to a shorter arrangement . The lyrics , which portray the mind of a serial killer , were inspired by lead singer Bono 's reading of Norman Mailer 's 1980 novel The Executioner 's Song , and other related works . In his trial for the murder of Rebecca Schaeffer , Robert John Bardo used " Exit " as part of his defence , claiming the song had influenced his actions . 
 " Exit " was frequently played live on The Joshua Tree Tour , but has been performed on just one occasion since then . Live performances are depicted in the 1988 film Rattle and Hum and the 2007 video and live album Live from Paris . 
 = = Writing and recording = = 
 " Exit " was created on the final day of recording for The Joshua Tree . It developed from a lengthy jam that the band recorded in a single take . Producer Brian Eno edited the jam down to the end length . Guitarist the Edge said " it started off as an exercise in playing together with a kind of mood and a place in mind . And it really , for me , it brought me there , it really did succeed as an experiment . " Producer Daniel Lanois said " There 's something that happens when U2 bash it out in the band room ... and sometimes things get out of control , sonically , in a good way . Out of control in the sense that you don 't know what it is anymore , it just takes on a life of its own , and it makes people do things . " Speaking of the jam , he noted " it was a long jam , and there was just this one section of it that had some kind of magic to it , and we just decided to turn it into something . " 
 The lyrics were inspired by Norman Mailer 's 1980 Pulitzer Prize @-@ winning novel The Executioner 's Song , written about serial killer Gary Gilmore , and by Truman Capote 's 1966 novel In Cold Blood . Lead singer Bono had read both novels and wanted to try and write " a story in the mind of a killer " . Further reading of Flannery O 'Connor and Raymond Carver caused him to try and understand " the ordinary stock first and then the outsiders , the driftwood — those on the fringes of the promised land , cut off from the American dream . " Bono described the lyrics as " just a short story really , except I left out a few of the verses because I liked it as a sketch . It 's just about a guy who gets an idea into his head . He picks it up off a preacher on the radio or something and goes out ... " . He noted that , although 30 songs were in contention for inclusion on the album , he " wanted a song with that sense of violence in it , especially before ' Mothers of the Disappeared ' . " 
 = = Composition and theme = = 
 " Exit " runs for 4 : 13 . It is played in common time at a tempo of 120 beats per minute . 
 " Exit " portrays the mind of a psychotic killer . Hot Press editor Niall Stokes stated the song " trawls the area occupied by either or both [ Gilmore and Manson ] , getting inside the head of a protagonist who 's careening into psychosis . " He added that the point of " Exit " was " to convey the state of mind of someone driven , by whatever powerful urges , to the very brink of desperation . " Stokes felt that " the undercurrent of religious imagery " in the song was a response to " the fanaticism implicit in faith " , and that the song allowed U2 to " [ purge their ] own demons , their own anger and fury at the vicissitudes fate had thrust upon them . Another Hot Press contributor , Bill Graham , said " Exit " allowed U2 to " finally confess their gradual recognition of the Anti @-@ Christ in everybody . " 
 Bassist Adam Clayton said the line " He saw the hands that build could also pull down " was a jab at the US government 's conflicting roles in international relations . Two songs from The Joshua Tree , " Bullet the Blue Sky " and " Mothers of the Disappeared " , focused on the foreign policy of the United States . In describing " Exit " , Bono said " It is all very well to address America and the violence that is an aggressive foreign policy but to really understand that you have to get under the skin of your own darkness , the violence we all contain within us . Violence is something I have quite a bit about . I have a side of me which , in a corner , can be very violent . It 's the least attractive thing in anyone and I wanted to own up to that . " 
 Don McLeese of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times believed " Exit " " [ suggests ] the evil that can result from moral self @-@ righteousness . " Music journalist Bill Graham wrote " For the first time , [ Bono ] was owning up to the dangers of the dualism implicit in Christianity " , comparing the song 's spiritual and musical tone to that of the Virgin Prunes . David Werther , a faculty associate in Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin – Madison , compared " Exit " with U2 's 1991 song " Until the End of the World " in an examination of the role music can play in catharsis . He noted that both were powerful songs , but that while " Until the End of the World " allowed the possibility of purification , which he described as the cleansing of the soul " through pity and fear " , by placing the listener in the position of Judas Iscariot , " Exit " was an example of purgation , a freeing from excess pity and fear . Werther noted " ' Exit ' evokes feelings of fear , fear of losing control , giving into one 's dark side , perhaps even taking one 's life " , contrasting it to the " waves of regret " experienced by Judas . 
 = = Reception = = 
 " Exit " received mixed to positive reception from critics . Colin Hogg of The New Zealand Herald described the song as a " decidedly scary ... guitar @-@ driven barrage " . Divina <unk> of The San Diego Union @-@ Tribune described it as " blistering " . Tony Perry of The Patriot @-@ News felt it was one of the low points of the album , stating " ' Exit ' ... <unk> into little more than noise " , a sentiment echoed by Lennox Samuels of The Dallas Morning News who called it " a dull piece " . Writing for the Orange County Registrar , Jim Washburn and Noel Davis called it " a journey through a killer 's mind , made harrowing not so much by Hewson 's creepy @-@ <unk> lyrics as by the band 's ( still the Edge , drummer Larry Mullen and bassist Adam Clayton ) overdriven backing , which practically boils right out of the pot . " Thom Duffy of the Orlando Sentinel labelled the song 's atmosphere " eerie " . 
 Richard Harrington of The Washington Post called it " metaphorically ambivalent " . Barbara Jaeger of The Bergen Record called Clayton 's bassline " ominous " . Stokes described it as " the antithesis of [ U2 's ] bright , ringing , optimistic , inspirational selves , it was dirty , loud , discordant , repetitive , noisy , black . If the intention was to invoke a sense of evil abroad , then it was effective " . Graham said " ' Exit ' should have exploded the myth of U2 as the nice guys of rock . Never had they shown such a vicious streak or produced such a withering track .... Far more than even ' Bullet the Blue Sky ' , [ the Edge 's ] playing is scratching at the prison bars of polished good taste " , describing it as the wild card of the album . Author John Luerssen contrasted it to the rest of the band 's catalogue , saying " Unlike most of the songs U2 had written up to this point , ' Exit ' lacked any optimism . " Hot Press contributor Colm O 'Hare felt the claims by Bardo evoked memories of Charles Manson 's use of " Helter Skelter " , and contained " even more sinister shades " of the death of John Lennon . In Rolling Stone , Steve Pond argued it was " awkward enough to remind you that not even Patti Smith could regularly pull off this sort of thing . " 
 Although " Exit " was not released as a single it charted in the Netherlands , peaking at number 46 after two weeks . 
 = = Live performances = = 
 U2 debuted " Exit " on 8 March 1987 for a broadcast of The Old Grey Whistle Test . Bono introduced it as " a song about a religious man , a fanatic , who gets into his head the idea he calls ' the hands of love ' . " It was next performed on 2 April 1987 in Tempe , Arizona , during the first concert of The Joshua Tree Tour . Clayton noted that the manner in which they created the song inadvertently caused a problem for U2 , saying " when you 're in a touring situation you have to learn numbers that were never actually written so much as spontaneously created . " " Exit " was played at all 109 concerts on the tour , and was frequently followed by a snippet of the Them song " Gloria " , which was written by Van Morrison Following the conclusion of the Joshua Tree Tour , U2 performed " Exit " on only one more occasion ; 14 October 1989 in Melbourne , Australia , on the Lovetown Tour , almost two years after the previous performance of the song . In 2007 , U2 's manager Paul McGuinness said that the song had been " slightly tainted " after the trial of Robert John Bardo , speculating that it had fallen out of favour with the band following the incident . 
 In 2006 , Bono stated " When things aren 't going right and I 'm feeling like we 're not communicating , I go through terrible things on stage . " He likened his emotions on those occasions to " a big blackness " , and found that performing the song helped him to purge them from his mind on some occasions . Several scenes in the 1988 film Rattle and Hum depict Bono with his arm in a sling , a result of his falling and dislocating his shoulder during a performance of " Exit " on 20 September 1987 in Washington . The concert was being filmed for the movie , and the Edge stated that " the show was not going well " . Bono fell while running across the stage " in an attempt to try and get something going " . Recalling the incident , Bono said " [ ' Exit ' ] had taken me to some ugly place ... but it was rage that caused it . That was when I realized rage is an expensive thing for your general well @-@ being . " On another occasion he said " I just want to take a bath after we do that . I just want to wash it off my skin . " Graham wrote that " performances of ' Exit ' would grow ever more fraught and <unk> . " 
 David Zimmerman of USA Today believed the live performance of " Exit " helped to showcase Mullen 's drumming skills , which he described as " more assertive than ever " . McLeese described the live rendition as " harder , more aggressive and more explosive than much of the band 's earlier music . " Jon Bream of the Star Tribune said " it galvanized the crowd in much the same way that U2 had in its legendary performances at Live Aid in 1985 " , believing that it helped to focus the band 's energy . 
 A live performance of " Exit " , recorded on 8 November 1987 in Denver , Colorado , appears as the fourth song in the 1988 film Rattle and Hum . Another live performance of the song , played on 4 July 1987 at the Hippodrome de Vincennes in Paris , was broadcast live on television . It was later released on the video and live album Live from Paris in 2007 . 
 = = Trial of Robert John Bardo = = 
 Robert John Bardo , an American from Tucson , Arizona , became obsessed with actress Rebecca Schaeffer in 1986 after sending her a letter that same year . After witnessing her in a love scene in the 1989 film Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills , Bardo stated that the film " ruined this innocent image of her . " He paid a private investigator to find out her home address and began to stalk her , and on 18 July 1989 , he travelled to Shaeffer 's home and murdered her . 
 Park Elliott Dietz , a psychiatrist who had worked on the case of John Hinckley , Jr. following his assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan , was assigned to work with Bardo . He told that court that Bardo claimed " Exit " had influenced his actions . According to the Associated Press , when the song was played in court " Bardo , who had sat motionless through the trial , sprang to life ... He grinned , bobbed to the music , pounded his knee like a drum and mouthed the lyrics . " Bardo was convicted of first @-@ degree murder . 
 Bono said he did not feel responsible that a U2 song was used in a murder defence , but stated " I still feel that you have to go down those streets in your music . If that 's where the subject is taking you , you have to follow . At least in the imagination . I 'm not sure I want to get down there to live . I 'll take a walk occasionally , and have a drink with the devil , but I 'm not moving in with him . " The Edge said that the song 's defence in the trial was " very heavy " , stating " Should any artist hold back from putting out something because he 's afraid of what somebody else might do as a result of his work ? I would hate to see censorship come in , whether from the government or , from my point of view , personal . "

Maybe she should follow the career of her older sister and become a secretary . ” However , another counselor did encourage her to attend college , and even went to her house to help her fill out an application . She took her younger sisters to the library to get them to follow her lead . 
 She was the first of her family to go to college , being accepted into the Educational Opportunity Program ( which assists low @-@ income , first @-@ generation college students ) at California State Polytechnic University , Pomona ( Cal Poly Pomona ) and paying for it with the help of government grants and part @-@ time jobs . She graduated in 1979 with a Bachelor of Arts in political science . She then earned a Master of Public Administration degree at the University of Southern California in 1981 . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Solis served near the end of the Carter administration in the White House Office of Hispanic Affairs , where she was editor @-@ in @-@ chief of a newsletter during a 1980 – 1981 Washington semester internship as part of her master 's program . At the start of the Reagan administration in 1981 , she became a management analyst at the civil rights division of the Office of Management and Budget , but her dislike for Ronald Reagan 's policies motivated her to leave later that year . 
 In Washington , she met Sam H. Sayyad , whom she subsequently married . He owns an automobile repair center in Irwindale , California . The couple lives in a modest house in El Monte , California , not far from where she grew up . 
 Returning to California , Solis became Director of the California Student Opportunity and Access Program in 1982 , to help disadvantaged youth gain necessary preparation for college . In particular , she worked with the Whittier Union High School District . Friends urged her to try for elective office , and so in 1985 , she ran for the Board of Trustees of the Rio Hondo Community College District . She campaigned hard and overtook an incumbent and one other better established candidate to become the top placer . She was reelected in 1989 . During her time on the board , she worked towards improved vocational job training at the college and sought to increase the number of tenured faculty positions held by minorities and women . She joined several California chambers of commerce , women 's organizations , and Latino organizations . She gained added political visibility in 1991 when she was named to the Los Angeles County Commission on Insurance by Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina , a political mentor . Solis also served as chief of staff for State Senator Art Torres . 
 = = California State Legislature = = 
 Solis had the opportunity to run for the California State Assembly when , after California 's 1991 redistricting , the incumbent Dave Elder in Solis 's 57th State Assembly district was shifted into another district , while her new representative retired . In the June 1992 Democratic primary to fill the open seat , Solis 's opponents had the endorsement of powerful State Assemblyman Richard Polanco and the former incumbent . Solis had the support of Molina and U.S. Representative Barbara Boxer , in an effort that focused on door @-@ to @-@ door campaigning and featured Solis 's mother making burritos for campaign volunteers . Solis came out on top of a three @-@ way Democratic race , receiving 49 percent of the vote and besting her nearest competitor , future Assemblyman Ed Chavez , who received 31 percent . In the general election , Solis garnered 61 percent of the vote against Republican Gary Woods ' 34 percent , and gained election to the Assembly . She was one of seven Latinos who won election to the Assembly in the wake of the redistricting and became collectively known as Los Siete . Solis was among the most liberal of this ideologically diverse group . 
 In her one term in the State Assembly , Solis was prominent in the debate on illegal immigration to the United States , backing a bill to allow immigrants in the United States illegally to attend California colleges as long as they were residing in the state . She backed labor and opposed the tobacco industry in supporting a bill that banned smoking in all workplaces . She served on committees dealing with education , labor , and environmental issues , including a new committee that dealt with groundwater contamination and landfill leakage . She was not known as a strong orator . 
 The Democratic incumbent in Solis 's 24th State Senate district , Art Torres , gave up his office when he received the 1994 Democratic nomination for the statewide office of California Insurance Commissioner . Solis ran for the seat , won the Democratic primary with 63 percent of the vote against two opponents , and then won the 1994 general election with 63 percent of the vote against Republican Dave Boyer 's 33 percent . She became the first Hispanic woman to ever serve in the State Senate and the first woman ever to represent the San Gabriel Valley ; she was also the Senate 's youngest member at that time . She was reelected in 1998 with 74 percent of the vote . 
 In the State Senate , Solis authored 17 bills to prevent domestic violence and championed labor , education , and health care issues . She described herself as " a big believer that government , if done right , can do a lot to improve the quality of people 's lives " . In 1995 she sponsored a bill to raise the minimum wage from $ 4 @.@ 25 to $ 5 @.@ 75 ; it was strongly opposed by business organizations and the restaurant industry . When Governor Pete Wilson vetoed it , she organized a successful drive to make the issue into a ballot initiative the next year , using $ 50 @,@ 000 of her own campaign funds and rallying union support . The initiative 's passing garnered her a statewide reputation and other states followed with similar initiatives . She chaired the labor committee and established herself as loyal to labor interests , but made a point of establishing relationships with Republicans on the committee . Solis held high @-@ profile hearings on labor law enforcement following a summer 1995 sweatshop raid in El Monte that discovered more than 70 Thai workers existing in slave @-@ like conditions . She called garment manufacturers to explain themselves and pushed for tougher enforcement of anti @-@ sweatshop laws . Republican State Senator Ray Haynes later said that Solis was " a committed liberal in the pockets of labor " , but Republican State Senate Leader Rob Hurtt said of her , " We obviously didn 't see eye to eye . But she was respectful . I 'll give her credit ; she was a very hard worker and she knew her stuff . " 
 Solis was an environmental activist in the State Senate , due to concerns that stemmed from a childhood spent within smelling distance of the Puente Hills Landfill and making frequent visits to the San Gabriel Mountains . In 1997 , she worked to pass environmental justice legislation with a law to protect low @-@ income and minority communities from newly located landfills , pollution sources , and other environmental hazards in neighborhoods that already had such sites . She got the bill , SB 1113 , approved over the strong opposition of various business interests , water contractors , and some state government agencies , but Wilson vetoed it . She returned in 1999 with a weakened measure , which was signed by Governor Gray Davis . Calling for " the fair treatment of people of all races , cultures , and incomes with respect to the development , adoption , implementation , and enforcement of environmental laws " , it represented the first legislation of its kind in the nation and is considered a landmark . 
 Solis faced controversy with her 1999 legislation , SB 63 , that lowered the carpool restrictions on the El Monte Busway from three or more occupants to two or more . When this took effect in January 2000 , it quickly resulted in greatly increased volume on the busway and protests from bus riders and prior <unk> . Solis at first defended the change , but it continued to have a detrimental effect on the busway and did not improve flow in the regular traffic lanes . By May , she was co @-@ sponsoring legislation to rescind the change and restore the higher occupancy requirement , which passed and took effect in July 2000 . 
 Due to her work in overcoming obstacles for environmental justice , in 2000 Solis was given the Profile in Courage Award by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation , and was praised as " a politician who hasn 't shied away from challenging the old boy network both within and without the Latino community " . She was the first woman to win the award , and gained appearances in George and People magazines and on the Today show . Art Torres , who had become California Democratic Party chair , said of Solis , " She 's going to be a national star " . 
 = = U.S. House of Representatives = = 
 Term limits would have prevented Solis from seeking reelection to the State Senate . After months of deliberation , she decided to run for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000 against 18 @-@ year incumbent Matthew G. Martínez in the 31st congressional district , which consisted largely of working class Hispanics and Asians . This action was criticized by Hispanics and others , and only two members of Congress , Barbara Boxer and Loretta Sanchez , supported her . Martínez was more conservative than many of his constituents , as he had supported the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , opposed gun control , and supported bans on specific abortion procedures . He was also criticized for lacking effort and neglecting his district . Solis was able to obtain the support of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor ( which called her a " warrior for working families " ) , Emily 's List , Handgun Control Incorporation , the Sierra Club and the California League of Conservation Voters . With their help , Solis outspent Martínez by a 4 @-@ to @-@ 1 margin and had hundreds of volunteers working for her . 
 She defeated the incumbent Martínez in the March 2000 Democratic primary by a 69 percent to 31 percent margin . On primary night , Martínez called Solis " obnoxious " and accused her of untruthful advertising . He subsequently switched to the Republican Party , and urged Latinos to vote against her , to no great effect . Without a Republican opponent in the general election , Solis beat three little @-@ known challengers from third parties and won 79 percent of the vote . 
 Upon arriving in the House of Representatives , Solis was named freshman class whip , making her responsible for collecting votes from first @-@ term Democrats . National Journal magazine named her one of its " Ten Freshmen to Watch " , and said that her election " is a sign of things to come in California and a generational changing of the guard in the Hispanic Caucus " . Solis commissioned for her new office a painting of the United States Capitol with the San Gabriel Mountains behind it , so that she would not forget her roots . Her Washington apartment was tiny . 
 As congresswoman , Solis was most known for her work on environmental issues as a member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce , the Committee on Natural Resources , and the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming . She made the promotion of green @-@ collar jobs a priority and sponsored the Southern California portion of the California Wild Heritage Act , which would create or enlarge many wilderness areas . In 2003 she sponsored legislation that funded a National Park Service study to designate a large swath of the Angeles National Forest , the Puente and Chino Hills , and the Rio Hondo and San Gabriel River , a National Recreation Area . ( In 2013 , after Solis had left the Obama administration , the Park Service recommended proceeding with a greatly reduced version of the original proposal ; while other advocates evinced disappointment , Solis said it was still a positive step and that Congress could expand the area in whatever legislation it undertook . ) 
 Solis was not a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee , but championed the Employee Free Choice Act and was the only member of Congress on the board of American Rights at Work , a pro @-@ union organization that strongly supports the act , for whom she served as treasurer starting in 2004 . On trade she voted against both the Dominican Republic – Central America trade agreement and the <unk> trade agreement , and also expressed opposition to a purposed bilateral <unk> trade agreement , citing concerns about human rights violations . Solis opposed legislation that would soften job safety requirements . She received 100 percent ratings from several pro @-@ labor groups for the years 2005 through 2007 , and was a major recipient of union political donations . United Farm Workers co @-@ founder Dolores Huerta is one of Solis 's role models . 
 During her tenure in the House Solis was an advocate of comprehensive immigration reform . She was one of the leading opponents of H.R. <unk> a House bill sponsored by Wisconsin Congressman Jim <unk> and voted against it . 
 Solis supported legislation aimed at reducing the number of teen pregnancies within Latina and African American communities and sponsored a bill , that became law in 2003 , that granted U.S. citizenship to immigrants after one year of military service instead of the previous three years . 
 Solis is Roman Catholic and pro @-@ choice . Along with 47 other Catholic members of Congress , she sent a letter to Cardinal Theodore McCarrick of Washington , D.C. , in order to dissuade him from refusing them the sacraments because of their pro @-@ choice legislative voting . Solis signed a " Statement of Principles , " stating her commitment to her faith as well as her disagreement with the Roman Catholic Church on some issues . They stated that on those issues , such as abortion rights , they decided to follow their conscience instead of the Church teachings . 
 Solis was a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and rated a lifetime " liberal quotient " of 99 percent from Americans for Democratic Action , and a lifetime 2 percent rating from the American Conservative Union . From 2006 to 2008 she wrote blog entries for The Huffington Post . Solis believed in the importance of mentoring , and as a House member continued relationships she had established with up @-@ and @-@ coming political figures in her district , including California State Assemblywoman Judy Chu and Monterey Park Mayor Sharon Martinez . 
 After the 2000 census and subsequent redistricting , Solis 's area became part of California 's 32nd congressional district . She was reelected for additional terms in 2002 , 2004 , and 2006 by very large margins , twice with no Republican in opposition . She ran unopposed in 2008 . 
 Solis chaired the Health and the Environment Task Force of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus during the 110th Congress . However , during 2006 and 2007 , Solis was part of a falling out between several female representatives and Joe Baca , leader of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus , arguing there was a " lack of respect afforded to women members of the Hispanic Caucus , " which Baca denied . She had previously broken ties with the caucus ' political action committee over its campaign contributions to Baca 's sons . Baca responded that Solis " was a kiss @-@ up " to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi , a remark for which he later apologized . Solis was indeed considered a close ally of Pelosi , which helped her get a seat on the Energy and Commerce Committee . She considered running for the position of Democratic Caucus Vice @-@ Chairman for the 110th Congress , but deferred to incumbent John Larson after Rahm Emanuel chose to run for caucus chair , which Larson had been running for . Solis 's aggressive fundraising for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee gained her a vice chair position on the Democratic Steering & Policy Committee . At the time of her selection to Obama 's cabinet , she had been elected 2nd vice chair of the Hispanic Caucus and was considered a potential candidate for a leadership position in the House . 
 Solis was a strong supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton 's 2008 presidential bid ; when that fell short , Barack Obama aggressively sought her support , as part of strengthening his appeal to Hispanic voters . She supported Clinton 's effort to establish a U.S. Public Service Academy and was a co @-@ sponsor of a House bill to create one . Solis did not become wealthy from her political career ; by 2008 , she and her husband 's main assets consisted of retirement funds and his auto shop , valued at under $ 100 @,@ 000 . 
 = = U.S. Secretary of Labor = = 
 On December 18 , 2008 , sources close to the Obama transition team identified Solis as the President @-@ elect 's choice for U.S. Secretary of Labor , the last cabinet position yet to be filled . The selection earned praise from the AFL @-@ CIO and other labor organizations , but was not well received by business groups and the anti @-@ union group Center for Union Facts . The official announcement was made by Obama on December 19 . Solis 's successor was chosen in a special election in California 's 32nd congressional district ; she declined to endorse a candidate in the primary ( from which her past mentee Judy Chu emerged on top and eventually won the general election ) . 
 Solis 's confirmation hearings were held on January 9 , 2009 , before the Senate Health , Education , Labor , and Pensions Committee . Committee chair Ted Kennedy repeatedly praised her , while , despite examination by Republican members , Solis declined to discuss specific policy issues , including the Employee Free Choice Act . Several days later , Senate Republicans said they might try to put a procedural hold on her nomination because of her unwillingness to answer questions in detail in the hearings . By January 23 , a secret hold was placed on the nomination by an anonymous Republican . A series of written questions and responses between Republican members and Solis followed , during which she was more forthcoming . Republican Mike Enzi pressed her on whether her unpaid high @-@ level positions at American Rights at Work constituted prohibited lobbying activity ; Solis denied violation of rules of conduct and stated she had not helped lobbying . Solis did acknowledge that she had failed to report those positions on her annual House financial disclosure forms at the time , which a White House spokesperson argued was an unintentional oversight . On February 2 , Obama appointed veteran Labor Department official Edward C. <unk> as Acting Secretary . The prolonged process was considered by some Republican aides to be a preview of future battles on labor issues between the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress . 
 A vote on Solis 's committee confirmation was set on February 5 , but postponed after news that Solis 's husband Sam Sayyad had just paid $ 6 @,@ 400 in outstanding state and local tax liens dating back to 1993 for his auto repair business . Sayyad had filed a separate tax return from Solis , and intended to contest the lien as they were for business taxes he believed to have already paid . A White House spokesperson stated Solis should not be penalized for any mistakes that her husband may have made . The revelations came in the wake of several other Obama nominations troubled or derailed due to tax issues . Committee Republicans subsequently indicated they would not blame Solis , but were still concerned about her ties to American Rights at Work . On February 11 , 2009 , the committee approved her nomination by voice vote with two votes opposed . After still further delays , Republicans agreed not to subject her nomination to a filibuster and on February 24 , 2009 , Solis was confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 80 – 17 . She resigned from the House and was sworn into her new position that evening . ( A ceremonial swearing in featuring Vice President Joe Biden was later held on March 13 . ) 
 Solis became the first Hispanic woman to serve as a regular U.S. cabinet secretary and the first cabinet secretary with Central American descent . She also became the first Hispanic Secretary of Labor . Solis felt that under the George W. Bush administration , the department had become unimportant and lacking in power , and that its actions reflected a pro @-@ business agenda . Accordingly , she hoped to reinvigorate it . 
 In her first days as secretary , Solis affirmed an extension to unemployment benefits specified by the 2009 Obama stimulus package , and joined Vice President Biden 's Middle Class Task Force . In her first major speech as secretary , Solis pleased community forum attendees at Miami 's Greater Bethel AME Church by vowing more aggressive enforcement of workplace protection laws , saying " You can rest assured that there is a new sheriff in town . " In late March 2009 , Solis vowed to add 250 investigators to the department 's Wage and Hour Division after a Government Accountability Office report showed the division 's enforcement of wage laws was quite inadequate ; the staffing up was completed by the end of the year . In late May 2009 , Solis suspended immigrant guest worker regulations related to H ‑ 2A visas adopted in the final days of the Bush administration ; the move earned plaudits from the United Farm Workers . In July 2009 , she expressed concern about workplace deaths among Hispanics , which she said they were especially vulnerable to ( her continuing attention to issues such as this during her tenure would lead to Hispanic workers considering her their champion ) . In October 2009 , the Occupational Safety and Health Administration levied the largest fine in its history on BP plc for failing to fix safety problems following the 2005 Texas City Refinery disaster . Business groups such as the National Federation of Independent Business complained that Solis was forging a less cooperative relationship , one that departed from the Bush administration 's " compliance assistance " approach ; the Labor Department said that compliance assistance was still an important part of the new strategy . 
 For 2010 , Solis 's agenda was to enact some ninety new rules and regulations intended to grant more power to unions and to workers . Whether Solis would try to revive Clinton administration ergonomics rules that had been discarded in the early days of the Bush administration , and that business groups continued to oppose , was unclear . In the wake of the April 2010 Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in West Virginia , the worst in the U.S. in forty years , Solis announced that the Labor Department 's Mine Safety and Health Administration would conduct an internal review of its enforcement of the Massey Energy mine prior to the accident . She also requested that the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health provide an independent analysis of that review . ( By the end of her tenure , however , some safety experts said she had fallen short of getting any meaningful new regulatory scheme in place in the wake of the disaster . ) Later that month , Solis and the department hosted the first @-@ ever meeting of the G @-@ 20 labor ministers ; they discussed how to accelerate job creation in their respective countries . Solis also faced disgruntlement from a local of the American Federation of Government Employees representing her own employees , who were unhappy that a longstanding <unk> program reduced under the George W. Bush administration had not been restored . The department said the program was modern and fair and that it was part of ongoing contract negotiations with the local . The year also saw the department trying to crack down on firms that illegally use summer internships for free labor , by clarifying what may constitute an unpaid academic internship ; the move brought resistance from universities . The year additionally saw Solis leading an administration campaign against farmers who employed children or underpaid workers . ( Proposed new rules in this area were dropped in 2012 , however , following adamant criticism from conservatives and agricultural groups . ) 
 In February 2011 , as protests continued over Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker 's proposal to limit that state 's public employee unions ' collective bargaining rights , and similar proposals were made in other states , Solis spoke out strongly and emotionally against such moves , saying " [ those governors ] aren 't just asking workers to tighten their belts , they 're demanding they give up their uniquely American rights as workers " . Overall , however , the Obama administration did not speak out forcefully against these moves . 
 In October 2012 , Solis defended the work of the Bureau of Labor Statistics , after the Current Population Survey it puts out monthly reported that unemployment in the United States had fallen below eight percent for this first time since Obama took office . Some critics , including former General Electric CEO Jack Welch , charged that the number had been tampered with in order to benefit Obama one month before the U.S. presidential election . Solis said , " I 'm insulted when I hear that because we have a very professional , civil service organization where you have top , top economists that work at the BLS . They 've been doing these calculations . These are our best trained and best @-@ skilled individuals working in the BLS , and it 's really ludicrous to hear that kind of statement . " For the year , the Labor Department set a record for the most back pay it had ever collected due to wage violations , $ 280 million going to some 300 @,@ 000 workers . Workplace fatalities in construction and general industrial sectors reached an all @-@ time low . 
 On January 9 , 2013 , Solis tendered her resignation as Secretary of Labor , becoming one of several Cabinet members deciding not to stay on for Obama 's second term . Her last day in office was January 22 , 2013 . 
 Solis , who had never become part of the inner circle of presidential advisors , said it had been a difficult decision and Obama praised her work as secretary . Reflecting upon her tenure , Solis generally garnered praise from labor unions and leading Democrats for her stricter enforcement of job safety regulations and more aggressive pursuit of wage and hour violators . Other leaders and analysts in the labor field thought her performance as secretary was underwhelming , with minimal public visibility and no memorable legacy left behind . All agreed that she operated in a difficult political environment , with the effects of the Great Recession still being felt , Republicans staunchly opposed to labor @-@ based initiatives , and the Obama administration 's attentions focused elsewhere . Business groups , meanwhile , continued to characterize her as having been uncooperative in her dealings with them . 
 = = Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors = = 
 Solis 's departure from the Labor Department was linked to an interest in running for a seat on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors in 2014 , when incumbent Gloria Molina would be term @-@ limited . She also said she wanted to rest , reconnect with her local community after twelve years in Washington , and spend time with her now 87 @-@ year @-@ old mother . 
 Later during January 2013 , Solis confirmed her interest in the County Board of Supervisors race , saying " I 'm going to take a look at it . " In explaining why a former U.S. Representative and Cabinet member would be interested in a county @-@ level body , analysts stated that the board is the most powerful county @-@ level legislative body in the United States , and exercises some executive and quasi @-@ judicial powers as well . It controls a workforce larger than the Labor Department 's and its $ 26 billion budget is equivalent to that of an average U.S. state . Each member presiding over some two million constituents , three times that of Solis ' old congressional district , and that it is quite possibly the fourth most powerful position in California politics , after Governor , U.S. Senator , and Mayor of Los Angeles . The supervisors have long been nicknamed " the five little kings " . 
 In November 2013 , Solis became a scholar @-@ in @-@ residence at her alma mater of Cal Poly Pomona . Her duties were to include guest lecturing in classes , mentoring students , and assisting in curriculum development , with a focus in political science . 
 During early 2014 , reports emerged that the United States Office of Special Counsel , the United States Department of Justice , and the FBI had begun investigating Solis during 2012 for possible violations of fundraising rules by federal officials during her time as Labor Secretary . Allegations were made that Solis solicited subordinates for funds for the 2012 re @-@ election campaign of President Obama . A spokesperson for Solis said that she believed she had done nothing wrong . The matter was also being looked into by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and its chair , Representative Darrell Issa , who said there was evidence supporting the allegations . By early 2016 , no further word had emerged on any of these investigations . 
 On April 5 , 2014 , Solis formally announced the start of her campaign for the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors seat , with the election to be held on June 3 . By this time she had raised over $ 600 @,@ 000 for her effort and was considered the favorite to win the contest . News of the federal investigation had little effect on her campaign . Solis won the seat on June 4 , 2014 , garnering 70 percent of the vote against two other opponents . The margin meant she won the seat outright and would not need to run in a runoff election . 
 As Supervisor for District 1 , she was at the forefront of the response to the Exide lead contamination issue , which affected Vernon and several other communities within her purview and which touched upon her past concerns with environmental justice . The Supervisors allocated some county money for cleanup , with Solis saying , " the state continues to drag its feet " . Going to the state capitol and asking for additional funds to remedy the situation , she said , " This has gone on too long . " In February 2016 she praised Governor Jerry Brown for finally increasing state funds for the cleanup , saying " Our voices were heard . For too long we have seen two Americas : one in which affluent neighborhoods get immediate help and relief . The other America is made up of poor working @-@ class families who silently suffer . Today 's announcement from the governor reconciles these two Americas . " 
 Among the other areas Solis was responsible for was Downtown Los Angeles . There she said her main priority was dealing with gentrification and the lack of affordable housing . 
 Regarding the new job as a whole , Solis said , " It 's fascinating how many people work for the county – over 100 @,@ 000 . At the Department of Labor it was like 15 @,@ 000 . The budget here is $ 26 billion , much more than what I was used to in D.C. " In December 2015 Solis took over as Chair of the Supervisors , a position which is rotated on a yearly basis . She said a priority for 2016 would be " to reaffirm our commitment to our diverse county family – to make this family , our family , inclusive for everybody , no matter their background , no matter where they come from , no matter how far down the scale they have been . " 
 = Charles M. Loring = 
 Charles <unk> Loring ( November 13 , 1833 – March 18 , 1922 ) was an American businessman , miller and publicist . Raised in Maine to be a sea captain , Loring instead became a civic leader in Minneapolis , Minnesota where he was a wealthy flour miller and in Riverside , California where he helped to build the first city hall . He was a popular and generous man who enjoyed many friendships and business associations . 
 Loring is remembered as the influential commissioner and president of the first Minneapolis park board . Considered the " Father of the Park System " in Minneapolis , Loring encouraged the city to work with Horace Cleveland , one of the first landscape architects , and park superintendents William W. Berry and Theodore Wirth . The city built what has been called , " the best @-@ located , best @-@ financed , best @-@ designed , and best @-@ maintained public open space in America . " 
 = = Family and early life = = 
 Loring 's grandfather was a respected teacher in Portland , Maine known as Master Loring , a descendant of one of the earliest settlers of Hingham , Massachusetts . Charles himself was a fifth great grandson of Hingham immigrant Deacon Thomas Loring . His mother was Sarah Wiley , a relative of Parson Wiley , a noted clergyman . His father Captain Horace Loring , a seaman who once visited the West Indies , took the young Loring on voyages as far from home as Cuba to prepare him for a life as a sea captain . But Loring disliked the ocean and the isolation and moved to Chicago in 1856 where he worked as a wheat speculator for B. P. Hutchinson and became a successful grain trader . 
 Loring never enjoyed perfect health , and when he fell ill in Chicago and moved on doctor 's advice to Minneapolis , his friend Loren Fletcher helped him become manager of the supply store for <unk> Morrison 's lumber business . Loring and Emily S. <unk> married in 1855 . They had one daughter , Eva Maria , and one son , Albert C. Loring who managed businesses for his father . Emily Loring died on March 13 , 1894 . Loring remarried on November 28 , 1895 to Florence Barton , daughter of A. B. Barton of Minneapolis . 
 Florence Loring participated in civic affairs and was a <unk> whose Crazy Quilt is in the collection of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts . The Lorings constructed the Florence Barton Loring Shelter in 1906 to protect children , lost animals and the city 's draft horses . Known at different times as the Minneapolis Humane Society , the Animal Rescue League , and the Animal Humane Society of Hennepin County , today 's Animal Humane Society ( AHS ) was located there near Loring Park for 40 years . Florence Loring also built a home for nurses near the hospital in Riverside , California where the Lorings lived in winter . 
 = = Flour milling = = 
 Minneapolis was founded at Saint Anthony Falls , the only waterfall on the Mississippi River , because of the potential for energy created by falling , flowing water . Loring understood the city 's geography — its waterfalls , lakes and river banks — and was able to use these unique aspects of his new home to slowly build his fortune . 
 In 1861 , Loring joined Fletcher in L. Fletcher & Co . , a general store specializing in supplies for lumbermen on Nicollet Avenue across from Minneapolis City Hall where they prospered for fifteen years . They joined with W. F. Cahill to convert the municipal waterworks building into a flour mill run on hydropower , the smallest in the Mississippi west bank milling district . With George <unk> they added three limestone stories and operated it as the W. F. Cahill & Co . Holly mill . During this period , Loring served in the city government , first as road supervisor and in 1872 as a Minneapolis City Council member from the Fifth Ward in the Near North community . 
 The group sold the Holly mill in 1872 to W. H. and F. S. Hinkle and purchased the Galaxy mill from W. P. Ankeny . In 1873 Fletcher and Loring also became principal owners of the Minnetonka Mills Company near Lake Minnetonka , in production between 1881 and 1886 . Loring supervised his milling interests until 1880 , when his son A. C. Loring took responsibility for their management . The Northwestern Consolidated Milling Company led by John Martin purchased the Galaxy mill and beginning in 1891 operated nine mills in Minneapolis . By the early 1900s and until the Great Depression , Washburn @-@ Crosby which became General Mills , Pillsbury @-@ Washburn , and Northwestern which became part of Standard Milling Company were an oligopoly , holding 97 % of the Minneapolis flour market . 
 = = Electricity and rail = = 
 Through his business associations , Loring contributed to major advances in the infrastructure of Minneapolis , to supply electricity , as a director of a railroad , and as chief executive of the North American Telegraph Company . In 1881 with William D. Washburn , Joel Bean Bassett , Sumner W. Farnham , James A. Lovejoy and Otis Arkwright Pray , Fletcher and Loring co @-@ founded the Minnesota Electric Light and Electric Motive Power Company , later the Minnesota Brush Electric Company . The group ran lines to bars and businesses on Washington Avenue and supplied them from the first hydroelectric central power plant in the U.S. , thirteen years before the Niagara Falls plant went on line in 1894 . In 1883 with Washburn , Martin , H. T. Welles , Thomas Lowry , George R. Newell , Anthony Kelly , Clinton Morrison , J. K. Sidle , W. W. Eastman , William D. Hale , Charles A. Pillsbury and Charles J. Martin , Loring incorporated the Minneapolis Sault Ste . Marie & Atlantic Railway Company known as the Soo Line Railroad .

 Despite opposition from the Knights of Labor who eventually became supporters , on January 23 , 1883 the Minneapolis Board of Trade passed resolutions to secure legislation to create a Board of Park Commissioners , and the city ratified a Park Act on April 3 , 1883 . Loring was the natural choice and was appointed the commission 's first president . He was reelected each term and served until 1890 when he insisted on resigning because a property in which he held financial interest was under park board consideration .

 Horace Cleveland made his " crowning achievement " in Minneapolis at the end of his career , in part thanks to " kindred spirits . " William Watts Folwell who was the founding president of the University of Minnesota , and Berry and Loring , both from Maine , were all united in their love for nature . The system Cleveland created is characterized by the use of indigenous plants in their natural environment and by the linking of open spaces and landmarks across distance with boulevards and parkways . Cleveland had thought about linked public open spaces as early as 1855 . 
 During Loring 's tenure , Cleveland designed the Grand Rounds Scenic Byway and the Chain of Lakes . In his history of the Minneapolis park system , Loring describes how green space was preserved around every Minneapolis lake . Many donations and acquisitions of property came early enough that the land was affordable . In 1872 for example , the city thought William S. King 's price of $ 50 @,@ 000 was too high for the 250 acres ( 1 @.@ 0 km2 ) of land around Lake Harriet . Thirty years later it would have sold for $ 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 .

 Minnehaha Falls received pilgrimages from fans of Longfellow 's The Song of Hiawatha by the 1870s . At the same time , business people wanted to harness its power . In 1884 Loring advocated a Minnesota state park at Minnehaha Falls , a goal the state tried and failed to achieve . In 1888 , Cleveland presented The Aesthetic Development of the United Cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis at the Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts and convinced the city to preserve the waterfall and to build a city park there . In the 1890s , Cleveland 's Minnehaha Park was annexed to Minneapolis and completed the Grand Rounds . Today Minnehaha Park sees 500 @,@ 000 visitors each year . Named by Folwell , the 52 @-@ mile ( 83 km ) Grand Rounds circles from Northeast , Minneapolis to Theodore Wirth Park , to the Chain of Lakes and follows the Mississippi River upstream past Minnehaha Falls to downtown .

 At the 1889 meeting of the American Park and Outdoor Art Association , held in Minneapolis , Loring read Cleveland 's The Influence of Parks on the Character of Children . In 1905 Loring learned of Theodore Wirth and recruited him as park superintendent . Wirth met with Minneapolis neighborhoods to extend Cleveland 's work from landmark geographical features to every street . He wrapped " sixty miles of picturesque parkways around the City like an emerald ribbon . " Wirth planned a playground within the reach of most children and canopies of trees throughout the city . Each home is within six blocks of a park and as of the U.S. Census in 2000 , there are 770 square feet ( 72 m2 ) of parkland for each resident . 
 Minneapolis park assets as of 2004 included the following . 144 of the parks were in place when Wirth retired in 1935 .

 Significant Other is the second album by American rap rock / nu metal band Limp Bizkit . Released in 1999 by Flip / Interscope Records , the album saw the band expanding its sound from that of its debut album Three Dollar Bill , Yall , to incorporate further metal and hip hop influences . Significant Other was co @-@ produced by Terry Date and Limp Bizkit . The album has sold at least 16 million copies worldwide . 
 During the band 's live performance at Woodstock 1999 , violence erupted during the album 's song " Break Stuff " . However , the controversy did not affect the album 's success , as Significant Other received high commercial sales , peaking at number one on the Billboard 200 . Critical reception to the album was favorable , with critics responding well to the album 's unique sound and the band 's performance , which was considered to be an improvement over the band 's debut . 
 = = Production = = 
 Following the radio success of the band 's cover of George Michael 's " Faith " , the band was determined to record the follow @-@ up to their first album in order to show that they weren 't a " Korn ripoff " or a cover band ; the band began writing an album which dealt with issues deriving from their newfound fame . Producer Terry Date , known for working with Pantera , White Zombie and Deftones , was chosen by Limp Bizkit to produce Significant Other . Guitarist Wes Borland stated of Date 's production , " he doesn 't get overly involved at the ' music ' end of things . He 's a producer who fools with sound and sonically makes everything perfect . He gets sounds that translate really well on tape and pretty much completely captures what we do , perfectly . " The band immediately began recording after the conclusion of the Family Values Tour , despite the insistence of Interscope Records that the band take a break after it . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 An early version of " I 'm Broke " was recorded for Three Dollar Bill , Yall $ , but was left off the album because of how different the song sounded from the rest of that album 's material . The melody for " Trust ? " originated from a melody played in rough form in early 1998 , during the Ladies Night in Cambodia tour . In response to claims that the lyrics of Three Dollar Bill , Yall $ were misogynistic , Durst toned down his lyrical content on this album , which he described as being more lyrically mature . Fred Durst 's breakup with his girlfriend inspired the songs " Nookie " and " Re @-@ Arranged " . 
 The band allowed Durst and DJ Lethal to explore their hip hop influences by recording with Method Man . DJ Premier of Gang Starr was brought in to produce the collaboration . The band wanted to record " a track that was straight hip @-@ hop " , according to Borland . The song was originally titled " Shut The Fuck Up " , but was retitled " N 2 Gether Now " for marketing purposes . Durst also recorded a song with Eminem , " Turn Me Loose " , which was left off the album . The band also collaborated with Korn vocalist Jonathan Davis and Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots on " Nobody Like You " . Weiland would frequently visit NRG studios and help with the recording , vocally coaching Durst . Staind singer Aaron Lewis provided backup vocals on the song " No Sex " , while Scott Borland , Wes ' brother , played keyboards on " Just Like This " , " Nookie " , " Re @-@ Arranged " , " I 'm Broke " , " 9 Teen 90 Nine " and " A Lesson Learned " . 
 Describing the album 's music , Allmusic 's Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that it contains " flourishes of neo @-@ psychedelia on pummeling metal numbers and there are swirls of strings , even crooning , at the most unexpected background . " While the band was opposed to solos , they allowed John Otto to perform an extended drum solo in the middle of " Nobody Like You " . Scott Borland wrote string melodies for " Don 't Go Off Wandering " . 
 The band also recorded interludes with Primus bass player and singer Les Claypool and MTV VJ Matt Pinfield . Claypool stated , " I came in and they wanted me to write some sort of intro for the record . I got stoned and got in front of the mic and started babbling and they ended up not using the intro and using that instead . "

 Significant Other received largely favorable reviews from critics . Entertainment Weekly reviewer David Browne gave the album a B , writing " Significant Other isn 't simply modern rock ; it 's postmodern rock . " Robert Christgau gave the album an honorable mention , writing , " Give their image credit for having a sound . " Christgau noted the songs " Just Like This " and " N 2 Gether Now " as highlights of the album . Allmusic 's Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the album " considerably more ambitious and multi @-@ dimensional " than the band 's previous album , Three Dollar Bill , Yall $ . 
 In later reviews of the album , About.com 's Tim Grierson gave the album 4 out of 5 stars , calling it " A buzz saw of bad attitude , metal guitar and white @-@ boy rapping , Limp Bizkit 's breakthrough album , Significant Other , is unapologetically rude and immature . But perhaps more importantly , it also rocks very , very hard . " Rolling Stone and its album guide awarded the album three and a half out of five stars . A less favorable notice came from author Martin Charles Strong , who gave the album 5 out of 10 stars in his book The Essential Rock Discography . In 2014 , Revolver magazine said Significant Other was " one of the great guilty @-@ pleasure hard @-@ rock albums of all time " , and listed it as one of ten essential nu metal albums " you need to own . "

 Violent action sprang up during and after Limp Bizkit 's performance at Woodstock ' 99 , including fans tearing plywood from the walls during a performance of the song " Break Stuff " . Several sexual assaults were reported in the aftermath of the concert . Durst stated during the concert , " People are getting hurt . Don 't let anybody get hurt . But I don 't think you should mellow out . That 's what Alanis Morissette had you motherfuckers do . If someone falls , pick ' em up . We already let the negative energy out . Now we wanna let out the positive energy " . Durst later stated in an interview , " I didn 't see anybody getting hurt . You don 't see that . When you 're looking out on a sea of people and the stage is twenty feet in the air and you 're performing , and you 're feeling your music , how do they expect us to see something bad going on ? " . Les Claypool told the San Francisco Examiner , " Woodstock was just Durst being Durst . His attitude is ' no press is bad press ' , so he brings it on himself . He wallows in it . Still , he 's a great guy . " 
 Durst saw the band as being scapegoated for the event 's controversy and later stated that the promoters of Woodstock ' 99 were at fault for booking his band , due to their reputation for raucous performances . While the performance was the subject of much controversy , the violence did not affect sales of Significant Other .

 = David Wetherall = 
 David Wetherall ( born 14 March 1971 ) is an English former footballer who played as a central defender , finishing his playing career with Bradford City at the end of the 2007 – 08 season . Born in Sheffield , he supported Sheffield Wednesday as a child , and started his playing career there . Before he made a league appearance for Sheffield Wednesday , he transferred to Leeds United and made more than 200 appearances . After this he joined Bradford City for a then club @-@ record fee of £ 1 @.@ 4 million and played every minute of every match in his first season for the club . Relegation from the Premier League soon followed and the club went into administration in 2002 but when Stuart McCall departed for Sheffield United , Wetherall became the team captain . Wetherall missed several games through injury in the seasons that followed and Bradford City were further relegated to League One in 2004 and then to League Two in 2007 . He played his final game in professional football on 3 May 2008 against Wycombe Wanderers . 
 Wetherall had two spells as caretaker manager of Bradford City , and was an integral part of club 's coaching setup following his retirement as a player . He left Bradford in June 2011 after 12 years with the club to take up a position with the Football League . He was inducted into Show Racism The Red Card 's hall of fame for his involvement in their anti @-@ racism campaign .

 = = = Early life and career = = = 
 Wetherall was born in Sheffield . He was capped by England at schoolboy level , and in 1989 , when he left school , he signed for Sheffield Wednesday under the management of Howard Wilkinson . Wetherall had attended Rotherham sixth form college where he achieved four A @-@ levels at grade A , and chose to study for his BSc in chemistry at the University of Sheffield , so that he could live at home with his parents and combine his education with playing for Sheffield Wednesday 's reserve team . He graduated with a first @-@ class honours degree in 1992 , becoming the first Premier League player to achieve such a qualification . In 1990 he was part of a British squad which travelled to Italy for the world student five @-@ a @-@ side football championship , and represented Great Britain as they won the association football bronze medal at the 1991 World Student Games hosted in Sheffield . 
 = = = Leeds United = = = 
 Wilkinson , by then Leeds United manager , returned to his former club in July 1991 to sign two young centre @-@ backs , Jon Newsome first and Wetherall a few days later , for a combined fee of £ 275 @,@ 000 . The 20 @-@ year @-@ old Wetherall 's first season at Leeds was the final year of his degree course , so he played for the reserves while training part @-@ time . He made a brief debut in the First Division , on 3 September 1991 at Elland Road as a late substitute against Arsenal ; Leeds went on to win the 1991 – 92 league title . He remembers it as " With 20 minutes to go , we were 2 – 1 down and I was on the touchline ready to go on , then Lee Chapman scored and the gaffer ( Howard Wilkinson ) told me to sit down again . But he threw me on for the last two minutes . I always tell people that made the difference in winning the title ! " As his team @-@ mates took the league trophy on a celebratory open top bus tour , Wetherall chose to revise for his examinations , a decision he came to regret , because " those experiences don 't come around that often " . Though the revision bore fruit : he graduated with first @-@ class honours . 
 Wetherall made his first start for Leeds in the newly formed Premier League in September 1992 against Southampton , scored his first goal for the club the following March to secure a draw at home to Chelsea and finished the 1992 – 93 season with 13 league appearances . He " noticed a massive difference in [ his ] fitness coming in full @-@ time after just having two blasts a week . " In the 1993 – 94 season , he established himself as a regular first @-@ team player . The following season he scored in a 2 – 1 defeat of defending champions Manchester United , and continued his knack of scoring vital goals with a last @-@ minute equaliser to avoid an embarrassing defeat by Walsall of Division Three in the 1995 FA Cup . In the replay , he scored for both Leeds and Walsall , the own goal taking the match into extra time . Leeds finished in fifth place in the league , and Wetherall was chosen manager Wilkinson 's player of the season . Wilkinson also singled him out for praise for his performance in a 3 – 0 UEFA Cup first @-@ round win against AS Monaco in Monaco in September 1995 , though they were heavily defeated by PSV Eindhoven in the next round . Wetherall played in the League Cup Final in 1996 , his first major final , but Leeds were outclassed , beaten 3 – 0 by Aston Villa . 
 In the 1996 – 97 season , Wetherall played less regularly as new manager George Graham experimented with defensive combinations , though by the following season he had re @-@ established himself in the starting eleven , sometimes acting as captain , and signed a new five @-@ year contract . On 27 September 1997 , he scored in the 1 – 0 victory over arch @-@ rivals Manchester United when Roy Keane 's knee was badly injured in the act of fouling Alf @-@ Inge Håland , who then accused Keane of feigning injury . Keane later took revenge on Håland during a Manchester derby and said to Håland as he lay on the ground : " And don 't ever stand over me again sneering about fake injuries , and tell your pal Wetherall there 's some for him as well . " Later that season Wetherall was among the Leeds travelling party who escaped unhurt as their aircraft crash @-@ landed after an engine caught fire on takeoff . 
 When David O 'Leary replaced Graham as manager it became clear that his centre @-@ back pairing of choice would be Lucas Radebe and the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Jonathan Woodgate , so Wetherall decided to leave Leeds for a club where he could play regular first @-@ team football . A transfer to nearby Huddersfield Town fell through after terms had been agreed , and the player 's reluctance to move house while wife Caroline was heavily pregnant with their second son caused him to reject an offer from Southampton . After eight years with Leeds , having scored 18 goals from 250 games in all competitions , he accepted an offer from fellow West Yorkshire club Bradford City . 
 = = = Bradford City = = = 
 Bradford City signed Wetherall for a club record £ 1 @.@ 4 million , to give experience to a side who had just been promoted to the Premier League . Wetherall was aged just 28 , but manager Paul Jewell had made a number of signings aged over 30 , prompting journalists to call his team " Dad 's Army " . Bradford won their first game 1 – 0 with a last minute goal at Middlesbrough scored by Dean Saunders who started a celebration pouring scorn at the club 's cynics . Wetherall 's first goal for Bradford was in a League Cup game at Reading before he scored again in the following round as Bradford were knocked out by Barnsley . His first league goal came in a 2 – 0 win against Newcastle United on 18 December . Wetherall missed only two cup game for Bradford City during his first season , and was the only player in the Premier League to have played every minute of the league season . His partnership with the emerging Andy O 'Brien in central defence was the front line in Bradford 's survival attempt . Bradford went into the final game of the season facing possible relegation . After only 12 minutes of their final game with Liverpool , Wetherall headed home a Gunnar Halle free @-@ kick . Bradford held on for a 1 – 0 win and with Wimbledon 's defeat at Southampton , Bradford stayed up with a then @-@ record low of 36 points . The goal directly resulted in Wetherall 's former club Leeds United qualifying for the next season 's Champions League . 
 The 2000 – 01 season started early for Bradford after chairman Geoffrey Richmond decided to enter the Intertoto Cup . Wetherall did not play in the team 's first game away at FK <unk> , and after playing in the second leg and the two third round games , he missed the semi @-@ final with Zenit St Petersburg because of an ankle injury . Bradford subsequently lost both legs . Wetherall started the league season but after playing all 52 league games since joining Bradford without leaving the field , Wetherall limped off before half @-@ time during a 2 – 0 defeat to their nearest rivals Derby County in November 2000 . Days after new manager Jim Jefferies took over , Wetherall was ruled out until the following February following a groin operation . His first game back was on 24 February 2001 as Bradford lost 2 – 1 to West Ham United . His return to league action lasted just four games when , after scoring in a 2 – 2 draw with Newcastle United , he was ruled out for the rest of the season with a recurrence of the groin injury . Bradford lost their Premier League status a month later after losing 2 – 1 at Everton . 
 Wetherall 's start to the 2001 – 02 season was hampered by a groin injury and his first full game of the campaign came on 14 September 2001 when he scored in a 5 – 1 Division One victory over Gillingham , which put Bradford second in the table . A groin injury again kept Wetherall out of the side for nearly five months , during which time he was linked with moves back to the Premier League at either Southampton or Manchester City , but he opted to stay at Valley Parade . He returned from injury for a reserve game in March after four months out with just over two months of the season left . He returned to the side against Burnley in a game noted for Paul Gascoigne 's debut for Burnley , and scored in his next game as Bradford eased any relegation worries by defeating Crewe Alexandra 2 – 0 . He played in the club 's final seven games and was named club captain for the following season after Stuart McCall left the club . 
 Wetherall was one of 19 senior first @-@ team players to be laid off by chairman Richmond in May 2002 , after the club were put into administration and the players unpaid since April . Those players went as far as taking strike action before a pre @-@ season friendly at Hull City , even though Wetherall , as their Professional Footballers ' Association representative , had initially denied they would do so , before the club was saved and players reinstated . Wetherall played in the club 's opening game of the season as Bradford drew 0 – 0 with Wolverhampton Wanderers live on television , but was again ruled out through an injury , this time to his hip . A planned comeback was put off five weeks later , before he sought the advice of a specialist in Denmark . After sitting out another three months through injury , Wetherall made his return as a substitute against Gillingham in December 2002 but was again injured in a reserve team comeback three days later . He again returned in February 2003 against Coventry City and played 15 games during the final three months of the season . 
 Wetherall kept off his injury problems and played in the first 15 games of the 2003 – 04 season , but was ruled out for two months after suffering medial ligament damage , following a knee injury sustained during the club 's 1 – 0 defeat to Watford . He returned on 28 December 2003 in a 1 – 0 victory which gave Bradford their first win in six games . His return to the defence added a second successive clean sheet . The revival in form was short @-@ lived and despite Wetherall missing just one more game , when he sustained a calf injury , Bradford were threatened with another relegation . Wetherall scored a header against Reading in a 2 – 1 win and gave Bradford a " slim chance " of avoiding relegation , only for that to be confirmed two weeks later after a 3 – 2 defeat to Wimbledon . 
 Despite the club 's relegation to League One and another spell in administration , Wetherall turned down a move away from Bradford City after snubbing Coventry City during the 2004 summer . In October 2004 , Wetherall and fellow veteran player Dean Windass both signed year 's extensions to their contracts , with Wetherall 's keeping him at Bradford until the end of the 2007 – 08 season . He also put his injury problems to one side for the 2004 – 05 season and missed just one league game – a 1 – 1 draw with Walsall in February when he was ruled out because of suspension ending his run of 42 consecutive games . Bradford manager Colin Todd had identified Wetherall as a key player for the season , but despite scoring four goals and striker Windass ' 27 goals earning him the league 's top scorer 's crown , Bradford could only finish 11th . 
 In October 2006 , days after playing his 250th game for Bradford , he signed a new deal keeping him at the club until 2010 with a clause allowing him to move into a coaching role when his playing career ended or continue playing beyond 2010 . He received the first red card of his career in a 2 – 2 draw with Cheltenham Town on 30 December for two bookable offences . 
 When he took over as Bradford caretaker manager , Wetherall stepped down as captain and instead handed the armband to centre @-@ back partner Mark Bower . But when McCall was appointed the new manager in June 2007 , Wetherall was reinstated as club captain for the 2007 – 08 season . On 20 February 2008 he announced the 2007 – 08 season would be his last as a player , although Bradford City would keep his registration , and instead he would join the club 's coaching staff . Wetherall said : " I was becoming increasingly frustrated at not being able to do the things that I used to be able to do . Situations I would normally deal with comfortably were suddenly becoming a struggle . " Bradford fans held a special day to celebrate Wetherall 's career , when they took banners and wore fancy dress and laboratory coats during the club 's 1 – 1 draw with Rotherham United on 22 March 2008 . In his penultimate month as a footballer , Wetherall was also named the League Two fans ' player of the month by the Professional Footballers ' Association . He played his final game for Bradford against Wycombe Wanderers on 3 May 2008 in a 2 – 1 defeat . 
 = = Managerial career = = 
 Wetherall was one of four senior players to act as Bradford City manager for two weeks during November 2003 , following the sacking of Nicky Law . He , as well as Peter Atherton , Wayne Jacobs and Dean Windass oversaw training but just one game when Bradford City lost 1 – 0 to Stoke City with Jacobs taking charge from the touchline . Wetherall took his first full steps into management on a caretaker basis when he was appointed player @-@ manager at Bradford City following the sacking of Colin Todd on 12 February 2007 . The side were on a poor run of form but Wetherall , whose role was extended in March , could not reverse the fortunes and the side were relegated to League Two . During Wetherall 's short stint in charge the club won just two games and drew another four . During his spell in charge of Bradford , Wetherall appointed his former Leeds teammate Nigel Martyn as goalkeeping coach , a position he kept under McCall . Wetherall returned to concentrate on his playing career after Stuart McCall was named full @-@ time manager during the summer of 2007 . 
 Wetherall holds the UEFA B coaching licence and returned to the Bradford City coaching set up during the summer of 2008 . He managed the club 's reserves upon his return , and in the summer of 2009 , he combined it with the role of youth side management , after Chris Casper left the club . He added he had been put off by senior management because of the day @-@ to @-@ day pressure of the job : " Football is a results @-@ based business first and foremost and that 's totally and utterly the case at first @-@ team level . " When McCall was sacked as manager , new manager Peter Taylor brought Junior Lewis into the coaching set @-@ up at Bradford , leaving Wetherall to concentrate on his role as youth team manager . After Taylor left the club in February 2011 and Lewis and assistant manager Jacobs were placed on gardening leave , Wetherall acted as assistant to interim manager Peter Jackson . He stayed with Bradford until the end of the season but then left the club to take up a position as head of youth development with the Football League .

According to The Jewish Chronicle , The Daily Stormer " posts hundreds of racist articles targeting black people , Muslims and Jews " . The website offers pro @-@ separatist coverage of the conflict in Eastern Ukraine , which Anglin considers " the correct moral position " . The SPLC described the site as " the newest up and comer in the heated competition to rule the hate web " , which " has in the last six months [ up to March 2015 ] often topped the oldest and largest hate site on the web , Stormfront , in terms of reach and page views , based on Alexa data " . Anglin claimed in May 2016 that the website 's traffic had doubled over the last six months , peaking at 120 @,@ 000 daily visitors . 
 The Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) stated that The Daily Stormer owed its success to the online imageboard 4chan becoming popular among racists , as both websites use similar memes and rhetorical styles . One meme the website has used is to overlay photographs of Taylor Swift with anti @-@ Semitic quotations , including those by Hitler . The website puts triple parentheses around the names of Jews , a far @-@ right meme created by fellow website The Right Stuff . Jacob Siegel of The Daily Beast wrote that the website was growing in popularity amongst a younger audience due to its use of humor , and was attracting activists of other anti @-@ political correctness ideologies — such as <unk> , men 's rights activists and opponents of Social Justice Warriors — who would not usually identify with fascism . The SPLC has also documented Anglin 's involvement in and encouragement of culture jamming by making hyperbolic statements in fake online accounts as women and minorities . He has also said that " ridiculous " statements such as " gas the <unk> " , if repeated in media coverage , can work to desensitize the public to the Holocaust . In late 2015 , during protests chiefly by African Americans at the University of Missouri , Anglin began a hoax of a campus Ku Klux Klan rally and claimed victory when the rumor spread . 
 Hacker and Internet troll weev wrote an article on the website after his release from prison , espousing his recent conversion to Neo @-@ Nazism and his opposition to Jews who had " abused our compassion to build an empire of wickedness the likes the world has never seen " . Fredrick Brennan , founder of the online community 8chan , wrote an article on The Daily Stormer encouraging eugenics , based on his own experiences of having brittle bone disease . Florida @-@ based Jewish troll Joshua Ryne Goldberg , who encouraged an Islamist attack on a free speech exhibition in Garland , Texas , under the alias of a religious extremist , wrote white supremacist articles for The Daily Stormer under the pseudonym Michael Slay . 
 The Daily Stormer attracted media coverage when the SPLC stated that white supremacist spree killer Dylann Roof — who on June 17 , 2015 , shot nine African Americans to death in the Charleston church shooting — may have made several comments on the site . The SPLC found similarities between one user 's comments and Roof 's manifesto . The Daily Beast stated that Anglin " repudiated Roof 's crime and publicly disavowed violence , while endorsing many of Roof 's views " . In October of that year , Anglin gave a positive reaction to an attempted assassination on Henriette <unk> , a pro @-@ immigration candidate to be mayor of the German city of Cologne , decrying her as a " feminist hag " . 
 = = = Support of Donald Trump = = = 
 Anglin officially endorsed Donald Trump for president in 2015 after the candidate said that many illegal immigrants from Mexico were criminals and rapists . Anglin encouraged the website 's readers to " vote for the first time in our lives for the one man who actually represents our interests " . The website also received national and international coverage for its endorsement of Trump 's proposal of a temporary moratorium on admitting foreign Muslims into the country ; it proclaimed " Heil Donald Trump – The Ultimate Savior " . According to the SPLC , white <unk> endorsement of Trump is <unk> , as the movement is generally skeptical of all politicians . In July 2016 , Andrew Anglin and The Daily Stormer were mentioned by Lacy Clay , Democratic Representative from Missouri , as he asked in a congressional hearing whether FBI director James Comey was aware of Trump sharing Twitter posts by white supremacists . 
 In The Daily Telegraph , Black Trump supporter Crystal Wright wrote that the candidate needed to separate himself from white nationalists such as The Daily Stormer , who were endorsing him ahead of other politicians they deemed " <unk> " for holding more liberal positions . Writing for The Atlantic , Conor <unk> theorized that modern academia 's focus on race rather than " color @-@ blind " individualism was causing divisions and allowing white nationalist sites such as The Daily Stormer to gain an audience , and therefore become a " tiny but nevertheless alarming portion " of Trump 's support . Al Jazeera writer Malcolm Harris analyzed the endorsement and predicted that a Trump presidency would strengthen organized racist groups and lead to civil war . 
 Huffington Post journalist Jessica Schulberg compared how white nationalists like Anglin and former KKK leader David Duke believed Trump to be representative of their ethnic interests , while at the same time several Jews believed him to be representative of theirs . In July 2016 , Trump tweeted an image originating from the far @-@ right , showing his rival Hillary Clinton , a background of money and a balloon in the shape of a six @-@ pointed star calling her the " Most Corrupt Candidate Ever ! " ; he deleted the image and reposted it with a circular balloon . Anglin believed Trump had posted the first image in full knowledge that the balloon was a Star of David , and that this was evidence of Trump being a pragmatic anti @-@ Semite : " The evangelicals will listen to his pro @-@ Israel statements , while we will listen to his signals . By pushing this into the media , the Jews bring to the public the fact that yes , the majority of Hilary 's [ sic ] donors are filthy Jew terrorists . " 
 = = = Reaction from white nationalists = = = 
 The SPLC has stated that white nationalist websites have taken issue with what they see as low @-@ brow coverage on The Daily Stormer , as well as Anglin 's defense of Christianity and denouncement of the white supremacist sect Christian Identity . Others , such as the Traditionalist Youth Network , have praised The Daily Stormer for its reach and influence . 
 Colin Liddell of <unk> has criticized Anglin 's beliefs and tone . Liddell , who believes that stopping migration and encouraging higher <unk> is more important for preserving the white race , condemned Anglin for writing that it was impossible for the race to survive without adopting his views on Jews , Hitler and the Holocaust . Liddell considered that Anglin was attracting poor whites with his provocative online persona in the same manner as monster trucks and professional wrestling , writing that " it is hard not to conclude that Anglin is a paid <unk> and agent provocateur , whose purpose is simply to infest and discredit White nationalism " . Jared Taylor of American Renaissance criticized The Daily Stormer 's " extremely harsh , dismissive and insulting tone toward blacks " , which he called unhelpful .

 = = = " Troll Army " = = = 
 The Daily Stormer orchestrates what it calls a " Troll Army " , involved in Internet trolling . It came to attention in October 2014 in a campaign against British Labour politician Luciana Berger , a Jewish Member of Parliament . A man had been sent to prison for sending her abusive messages over Twitter and The Daily Stormer encouraged its readers to send her antisemitic messages , as long as they did not promote violence . It also gave out guidelines on how to limit traceability and create anonymous e @-@ mail and Twitter accounts . Berger said she received 400 abusive messages in one week . The abuse was brought up in the British Parliament , where Speaker John Bercow deemed it " beneath contempt " . 
 The Troll Army launched a campaign in February 2015 against Mariam <unk> , an Afghan Australian Muslim activist who demanded that a T @-@ shirt bearing the Australian flag reading " If you don 't love it , leave " be withdrawn from sale at Woolworths . A woman was arrested for sending her abusive messages , and Anglin interpreted <unk> 's actions as curbing freedom of speech , which he believed " should be responded to with the most ridiculous conceivable hateful speech " , claiming that " the vast majority of White people do not think name @-@ calling should be an <unk> offense " . Around 3 @,@ 000 people defended her with the hashtag # <unk> . 
 In 2016 , The Daily Stormer took part in a Gamergate @-@ related attempt to have Nintendo marketing officer Alison Rapp fired . Rapp had angered gamers by allegedly removing " provocative content " from localizations of Japanese games , and activists including The Daily Stormer circulated her 2012 essay in which she argued for foreign bodies not to impose laws against child pornography in Japan . She was dismissed soon afterward , with Nintendo stating that it was unrelated to the controversy . Later that year , the site encouraged racially abusing Julia Ioffe , a Jewish Russian journalist who had written a piece on Trump 's wife , Melania in GQ ; Melania Trump and The Daily Stormer both found the piece too critical . Ioffe said that the abuse was unparalleled in her lifetime since leaving Russia to escape such prejudices 26 years earlier . In June , users of the website revealed the personal details of Erin <unk> , a Jewish woman running for Congress in California , and sent her Holocaust @-@ related messages . 
 = = = Printer stunt = = = 
 In 2016 , The Daily Stormer took credit for sending numerous racist , anti @-@ Semitic fliers to thousands of publicly accessible , Internet @-@ connected printers throughout the country , many of them at universities . The fliers urged the reader to visit the website and accompany it " in the struggle for global white supremacy " ; Anglin credited weev for the stunt . On April 20 that year , Hitler 's birthday , university printers in Germany were hacked to publish Nazi propaganda tracts including the website 's name . 
 = Bunkers in Albania = 
 Over 700 @,@ 000 bunkers in Albania were constructed during the nearly forty @-@ year rule of Enver Hoxha – one for every four inhabitants . The bunkers ( Albanian : <unk> ) are still a ubiquitous sight in Albania , with an average of 24 bunkers for every square kilometre of the country . 
 Hoxha 's programme of " bunkerisation " resulted in the construction of bunkers in every corner of the then People 's Socialist Republic of Albania , ranging from mountain passes to city streets . They had little military value and were never used for their intended purpose during the years of Communist rule ( 1945 – 1990 ) . The cost of constructing them was a drain on Albania 's resources , diverting them away from more pressing needs , such as dealing with the country 's housing shortage and poor roads . 
 The bunkers were abandoned following the collapse of communism in 1990 . Most are now derelict , though some have been reused for a variety of purposes including residential accommodation , cafés , storehouses and shelters for animals or the homeless . A few briefly saw use in the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s . 
 = = Background = = 
 From the end of World War II to his death in April 1985 , Enver Hoxha pursued a style of politics informed by hardline Stalinism as well as elements of Maoism . He broke with the Soviet Union after Nikita Khrushchev embarked on his reformist Khrushchev Thaw , withdrew Albania from the Warsaw Pact in 1968 in protest of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia , and broke with the People 's Republic of China after U.S. President Richard Nixon 's 1972 visit to China . 
 His regime was also hostile towards the country 's immediate neighbours . Albania did not end its state of war with Greece , left over from the Second World War , until as late as 1987 – two years after Hoxha 's death – due to suspicions about Greek territorial ambitions in southern Albania ( known to Greeks as Northern Epirus ) . 
 Hoxha was virulently hostile towards the more moderate communist government of Josip Broz Tito in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , accusing Tito 's government of maintaining " an anti @-@ Marxist and chauvinistic attitude towards our Party , our State , and our people . " He asserted that Tito intended to take over Albania and make it into the seventh republic of Yugoslavia , and castigated the Yugoslav government 's treatment of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , claiming that " Yugoslav leaders are pursuing a policy of extermination there . " 
 Albania still maintained some links with the outside world at this time , trading with neutral countries , such as Austria and Sweden , and establishing links across the Adriatic Sea with its former colonial power Italy . However , a modest relaxation of domestic controls was curtailed by Hoxha in 1973 with a renewed wave of repression and purges directed against individuals , the young and the military , whom he feared might threaten his hold on the country . A new constitution was introduced in 1976 that increased the Communist Party 's control of the country , limited private property and forbade foreign loans . The country sank into a decade of paranoid isolation and economic stagnation , virtually cut off from the outside world . 
 = = Military doctrine = = 
 Starting in 1967 and continuing until 1986 , the Albanian government carried out a policy of " bunkerisation " that saw the construction of hundreds of thousands of bunkers across the country . They were built in every possible location , ranging from " beaches and mountains , in vineyards and pastures , in villages and towns , even on the manicured lawns of Albania 's best hotel . " Hoxha envisaged Albania fighting a two @-@ front war against an attack mounted by Yugoslavia , NATO or the Warsaw Pact involving a simultaneous incursion by up to eleven enemy airborne divisions . As he put it , " If we slackened our vigilance even for a moment or toned down our struggle against our enemies in the least , they would strike immediately like the snake that bites you and injects its poison before you are aware of it . " 
 Albania 's military doctrine was based on a concept of " people 's war " drawing on the experience of the Albanian Partisans in World War II , which Hoxha had led . It was the only European country to have managed to liberate itself without the intervention of foreign troops ( though the Partisans benefited from great quantities of supplies and weapons provided by the Allies ) . The Partisans ' victory was mythologised on a massive scale by the Hoxha regime , which used its wartime successes to legitimise its rule . The armed forces were based on the Partisan model and built around infantry units ; 75 percent of the regular forces and 97 percent of reservists were employed in infantry roles . 
 The Partisans ' strategy was based around mountain @-@ based guerrilla warfare , in which they took refuge in the mountains and launched raids into the less defensible lowlands . By contrast , Hoxha aimed to defend Albania 's national integrity and sovereignty " at all costs " , which necessitated defending the lowlands as well . The bunkers were therefore intended to establish defensive positions across the entirety of the country . Smaller ones were laid out in lines radiating out within sight of a large command bunker , which was permanently manned . The commanders of the large bunkers would communicate with their superiors by radio and with the occupants of the smaller bunkers by making visual signals that could be seen through slits . 
 The regime also sought intensively to <unk> civilians . 800 @,@ 000 people out of a population of about three million served in defence in some way , ranging from the regular armed forces and reserves to civil defence and student armed youth units . Many sectors of the government , state @-@ owned businesses and the public service were also given roles in defence , meaning that almost the entire population was brought in one way or another into the scope of state defence planning . From the age of three , Albanians were taught that they had to be " vigilant for the enemy within and without " and propaganda slogans constantly emphasised the need for watchfulness . 
 Citizens were trained from the age of 12 to station themselves in the nearest bunker to repel invaders . Local Party cells organised families to clean and maintain their local bunkers , and civil defence drills were held at least twice a month , lasting for up to three days , in which civilians of military age of both sexes were issued with rifles ( but no ammunition ) . 
 Members of the Young Pioneers , the Communist youth movement , were trained to defend against airborne invasion by fixing pointed spikes to treetops to impale descending foreign parachutists . Despite the militarisation of the population , the Albanian defence system was massively inefficient and took little account of the country 's real defence needs ; training was minimal , fuel and ammunition were scarce , uniforms and equipment were of poor quality , weapons were antiquated and the military lacked a proper command and control system . 
 = = Construction = = 
 The bunkers were constructed of concrete , steel and iron and ranged in size from one- or two @-@ person pillboxes with gun slits to large underground nuclear bomb shelters intended for use by the Party leadership and bureaucrats . The most common type of bunker is a small concrete dome set into the ground with a circular bottom extending downwards , just large enough for one or two people to stand inside . Known as <unk> <unk> ( " firing position " ) or QZ bunkers , they were prefabricated and transported to their final positions , where they were assembled . They consist of three main elements : a 3 m ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) diameter hemispherical concrete dome with a firing slit , a hollow cylinder to support the dome and an outer wall with a radius 60 cm ( 24 in ) larger than the cylinder . The gap between the cylinder and outer wall is filled with earth . 
 At various places along the coast , large numbers of QZ bunkers were built in groups of three , linked to each other by a prefabricated concrete tunnel . Elsewhere bunkers were constructed in groupings around strategic points across the country , or in lines across swathes of territory . Tirana was particularly heavily defended , with thousands of bunkers radiating out in fifty concentric circles around the city . 
 The QZ bunker was designed by military engineer Josif Zagali , who served with the Partisans during World War II and trained in the Soviet Union after the war . He observed how dome @-@ shaped fortifications were virtually impervious to artillery fire and bombs , which simply ricocheted off the dome . He used his knowledge to design the subsequently ubiquitous dome @-@ shaped bunkers . Hoxha was initially delighted with the design and had many thousands of Zagali 's bunkers constructed ; 
 Zagali himself was promoted to the rank of colonel and became chief engineer of the Albanian Ministry of Defence . However , Hoxha 's paranoia led to Zagali being purged in 1974 and imprisoned for eight years on bogus charges of " sabotage " as a " foreign agent " . His wife went insane , his family was shunned by friends and acquaintances , and his daughter died of breast cancer . Zagali later said that it was " a painful and tragic fate not only for me and my family but for thousands and thousands of such families in Albania who have experienced the dictatorship of Enver Hoxha . " His experiences were later used as the basis of <unk> Bunker , a film by Albanian director <unk> <unk> . 
 = = = Command and control bunkers = = = 
 The command @-@ and @-@ control bunkers , known as Pike <unk> ( " firing point " ) or PZ bunkers , were also prefabricated and assembled on site . They are far larger and heavier than the QZ bunkers , with a diameter of 8 metres ( 26 ft ) . They are made from a series of concrete slices , each weighing eight or nine tons , which were concreted together on site to form an interlocking dome . Fully assembled , they weigh between 350 – 400 tons . 
 = = = Large bunkers and tunnels = = = 
 There was also a third category of larger " special structures " for strategic purposes . The largest were bunker complexes tunnelled into mountains . At Linza near the capital , Tirana , a network of tunnels some 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) long was built to protect members of the Interior Ministry and the <unk> ( the secret police ) from nuclear attack . Elsewhere , thousands of kilometres of tunnels were built to house political , military and industrial assets . Albania is said to have become the most tunnelled country in the world after North Korea . The tunnels were built in conditions of great secrecy . Engineering teams were not allowed to see construction through to completion but were rotated from site to site on a monthly basis . 
 = = Impact = = 
 The bunkerisation programme was a massive drain on Albania 's weak economy . The construction of prefabricated bunkers alone cost an estimated two percent of net material product , and in total the bunkers cost more than twice as much as the Maginot Line in France , consuming three times as much concrete . The programme diverted resources away from other forms of development , such as roads and residential buildings . On average , they are said to have each cost the equivalent of a two @-@ room apartment and the resources used to build them could easily have resolved Albania 's chronic shortage of housing . According to Josif Zagali , building twenty smaller bunkers cost as much as constructing a kilometre of road . It also had a human cost ; 70 – 100 people a year died constructing the bunkers . In addition , the bunkers occupied and obstructed a significant area of arable land . 
 The bunkerisation of the country had effects that went beyond their ubiquitous physical impact on the landscape . The bunkers were presented by the Party as both a symbol and a practical means of preventing Albania 's subjugation by foreign powers , but some viewed them as a concrete expression of Hoxha 's policy of isolationism – keeping the outside world at bay . Some Albanians saw them as an oppressive symbol of intimidation and control . Ismail Kadare used the bunkers in his 1996 novel The Pyramid to symbolise the Hoxha regime 's brutality and control , while <unk> has characterised the bunkers as " a symbol of totalitarianism " because of the " isolation psychology " that they represented . It has been argued that the bunkerisation programme was a form of " patterned large @-@ scale construction " that " has a disciplinary potential as a means of familiarising a population with a given order of rule . " The regime 's xenophobia had the effect of creating a siege mentality and a sense of constant emergency . 
 Hoxha 's strategy of " people 's war " also caused friction with the Albanian armed forces . The bunkers had little military value compared with a conventionally equipped and organised professional army . As one commentator has put it , " How long could one man in each bunker hold out ? How would you resupply each individual bunker ? How would they communicate with each other ? " General <unk> <unk> , the Defence Minister and a member of the Politburo , publicly criticised the bunker system in a 1974 speech and disputed Hoxha 's line that Albania was under equal threat from the United States and the Soviet Union . He argued that Albania needed a modern , well @-@ equipped professional army rather than a poorly trained and equipped civilian militia . Hoxha responded by having <unk> arrested , accusing him of being an agent of the Chinese and of working to bring about a military coup . Dubbed " the arch @-@ traitor <unk> " , the general and his associates were convicted and punished according to " the laws of the dictatorship of the proletariat " – meaning that they were executed . 
 Many other military figures , such as bunker designer Josif Zagali , were also caught up in the 1974 purges . The introduction of a new constitution two years later sealed Hoxha 's absolute control of the military by appointing him as Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Armed Forces and Chairman of the Defence Council . 
 = = Today = = 
 The bunkerisation programme was stopped soon after Hoxha 's death in 1985 , leaving Albania 's towns and countryside dotted with vast numbers of useless bunkers . They still dominate the Albanian landscape . A BBC reporter described in 1998 how they were ubiquitous on the road between Tirana and the city 's airport , " looking down from every hillside , sprouting out of every bank . " Their solidity has made it difficult to get rid of them . Some have been removed , particularly in cities , but in the countryside most bunkers have simply been abandoned . Some have been reused as housing for animals or as storehouses ; others have been abandoned to lie derelict due to the cost of removing them . 
 The extreme secrecy of the Communist regime meant that Albania 's post @-@ communist governments lacked information on how the bunkers had been used , or even how many had been built . In 2004 Albanian officials discovered a forgotten stockpile of 16 tons of mustard gas and other chemical weapons in an unguarded bunker only 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) from Tirana . The United States government gave Albania $ 20 million to destroy the weapons . In other places , abandoned bunkers have become a lethal danger . In 2008 alone , at least five holiday @-@ makers drowned when they were caught in whirlpools created by water currents around bunkers that had subsided into the sea . The Albanian army has carried out bunker removal programmes along the coastline , dragging them out of the ground with modified Type 59 tanks . 
 Although the bunkers were never used in a real conflict during Hoxha 's rule , some found use in conflicts that broke out in the 1990s . During the 1997 rebellion in Albania , the townspeople of Sarandë in southern Albania were reported to have taken up positions in bunkers around the town in the face of fighting between government troops and rebels . After the outbreak of the Kosovo War in 1999 , border villages in Albania were repeatedly shelled by Serbian artillery batteries located in nearby Kosovo and local people used the bunkers to shelter from the shelling . 
 Kosovo Albanian refugees took to using bunkers as temporary shelters until aid agencies could move them into tent camps , while NATO troops stationed in Albania relocated dozens of bunkers to fortify their base at <unk> . The Kosovo Liberation Army also used them as defensive positions during the Kosovo War , though this was not without its risks ; on at least one occasion bunkers along Albania 's border with Kosovo were mistakenly bombed by NATO aircraft . 
 An acute shortage of housing after the fall of the Communist regime in 1990 led some Albanians to set up home in abandoned bunkers , though the lack of running water and sanitation meant that the area around inhabited bunkers soon became contaminated and unhealthy . A few bunkers have found more creative uses . In the coastal city of Durrës one beachside bunker has been turned into the Restaurant <unk> , and another bunker in Gjirokastër was turned into a café . 
 There have been various suggestions for what to do with them : ideas have included pizza ovens , solar heaters , beehives , mushroom farms , projection rooms for drive @-@ in cinemas , beach huts , flower planters , youth hostels and kiosks . Some Albanians have taken to using the bunkers for more romantic purposes . In a country where until recently cars were in short supply , they were popular places for lovers to consummate their relationships ; as travel writer Tony Wheeler puts it , " Albanian virginity is lost in a Hoxha bunker as often as American virginity was once lost in the back seats of cars . " 
 In November 2014 , a " five star " nuclear shelter built near Tirana for Hoxha was opened as a tourist attraction and art exhibition . The large bunker contains a museum with exhibits from World War Two and the communist period . 
 Albania 's bunkers have even become a symbol of sorts for the country . Pencil holders and ashtrays in the shape of bunkers have become one of the country 's most popular tourist souvenirs . One such line of bunker souvenirs was promoted with a message to buyers : " Greetings to the land of the bunkers . We assumed that you could not afford to buy a big one . " 
 = Anti @-@ Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu = 
 The Anti @-@ Hindi imposition agitations of Tamil Nadu were a series of agitations that happened in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu ( formerly Madras State and part of Madras Presidency ) during both pre- and post @-@ Independence periods . The agitations involved several mass protests , riots , student and political movements in Tamil Nadu , and concerned about the official status of Hindi in the state . 
 The first anti @-@ Hindi imposition agitation was launched in 1937 , in opposition to the introduction of compulsory teaching of Hindi in the schools of Madras Presidency by the first Indian National Congress government led by C. Rajagopalachari ( Rajaji ) . This move was immediately opposed by E. V. Ramasamy ( Periyar ) and the opposition Justice Party ( later Dravidar Kazhagam ) . The agitation , which lasted three years , was multifaceted and involved fasts , conferences , marches , picketing and protests . The government responded with a crackdown resulting in the death of two protesters and the arrest of 1 @,@ 198 persons including women and children . Mandatory Hindi education was later withdrawn by the British Governor of Madras Lord Erskine in February 1940 after the resignation of the Congress Government in 1939 . 
 The adoption of an official language for the Indian Republic was a hotly debated issue during the framing of the Indian Constitution after India 's independence from the United Kingdom . After an exhaustive and divisive debate , Hindi was adopted as the official language of India with English continuing as an associate official language for a period of fifteen years , after which Hindi would become the sole official language . The new Constitution came into effect on 26 January 1950 . Efforts by the Indian Government to make Hindi the sole official language after 1965 were not acceptable to many non @-@ Hindi Indian states , who wanted the continued use of English . The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam ( DMK ) , a descendant of Dravidar Kazhagam , led the opposition to Hindi . To allay their fears , Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru enacted the Official Languages Act in 1963 to ensure the continuing use of English beyond 1965 . The text of the Act did not satisfy the DMK and increased their skepticism that his assurances might not be honoured by future administrations . 
 As the day ( 26 January 1965 ) of switching over to Hindi as sole official language approached , the anti @-@ Hindi movement gained momentum in Madras State with increased support from college students . On 25 January , a full @-@ scale riot broke out in the southern city of Madurai , sparked off by a minor altercation between agitating students and Congress party members . The riots spread all over Madras State , continued unabated for the next two months , and were marked by acts of violence , arson , looting , police firing and lathi charges . The Congress Government of the Madras State , called in paramilitary forces to quell the agitation ; their involvement resulted in the deaths of about seventy persons ( by official estimates ) including two policemen . To calm the situation , Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri gave assurances that English would continue to be used as the official language as long the non @-@ Hindi speaking states wanted . The riots subsided after Shastri 's assurance , as did the student agitation . 
 The agitations of 1965 led to major political changes in the state . The DMK won the 1967 assembly election and the Congress Party never managed to recapture power in the state since then . The Official Languages Act was eventually amended in 1967 by the Congress Government headed by Indira Gandhi to guarantee the indefinite use of Hindi and English as official languages . This effectively ensured the current " virtual indefinite policy of bilingualism " of the Indian Republic . There were also two similar ( but smaller ) agitations in 1968 and 1986 which had varying degrees of success . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Republic of India has hundreds of languages . During the British Raj , English was the official language . When the Indian Independence Movement gained momentum in the early part of the 20th Century , efforts were undertaken to make Hindustani as a common language to unite various linguistic groups against the British Government . As early as 1918 , Mahatma Gandhi established the Dakshin Bharat Hindi <unk> Sabha ( Institution for the Propagation of Hindi in South India ) . In 1925 , the Indian National Congress switched to Hindustani from English for conducting its proceedings . Both Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru were supporters of Hindustani and Congress wanted to propagate the learning of Hindustani in non @-@ Hindi speaking Provinces of India . The idea of making Hindustani or Hindi the common language , was not acceptable to Periyar , who viewed it as an attempt to make Tamils subordinate to North Indians . 
 = = Agitation of 1937 – 40 = = 
 The Indian National Congress won the 1937 elections in Madras Presidency . Rajaji became the Chief Minister on 14 July 1937 . He was a supporter of propagating Hindi in South India . On 11 August 1937 , within a month of coming to power , he announced his intention to introduce Hindi language teaching in secondary schools by issuing a policy statement . On 21 April 1938 , he issued a government order ( G.O. ) making the teaching of Hindi compulsory in 125 secondary schools in the Presidency . Periyar and the opposition Justice Party led by A. T. <unk> immediately opposed the move . They started statewide protests against Rajaji and Hindi . 
 The agitation was backed by Periyar 's Self @-@ Respect Movement and Justice Party . It also had the support of Tamil scholars like Maraimalai Adigal , <unk> Bharathi , K. <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . In December 1937 , Tamil Saivite scholars were among the first to announce their opposition to the Hindi teaching in the Saiva <unk> Maha Samaja conference at <unk> . Women also participated in the agitation in large numbers . <unk> <unk> , Narayani , Va . Ba . <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Dr. <unk> , Malar <unk> , <unk> and <unk> were some of the women who were arrested for participating in the agitation . On 13 November 1938 , the Tamil Nadu Women 's Conference was convened to demonstrate women 's support for the movement . The agitation was marked by anti @-@ Brahmin sentiments as the protesters believed Brahmins were attempting to impose Hindi and Sanskrit over Tamil . Despite the general anti @-@ Brahminism of the agitation , a few Brahmins like Kanchi Rajagopalachari also participated in the movement . The Tamil speaking Muslims in the Madras presidency supported the agitation ( in contrast to the Urdu speaking Muslims , who supported the propagation of Hindi ) . The agitation was marked by fasts , protest marches , processions , picketing of schools teaching Hindi and government offices , anti @-@ Hindi conferences , observing an anti @-@ Hindi day ( 1 July and 3 December 1938 ) and black flag demonstrations . It was active in the Tamil speaking districts of the Presidency – Ramnad , Tinnevely , Salem , Tanjore and North Arcot . During the course of the agitation , two protesters <unk> and Natarajan – lost their lives in police custody . 
 The ruling Congress Party was divided on the Hindi issue . While Rajaji and his supporters stuck to their position , <unk> and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan were against it . They wanted Rajaji to make Hindi optional or to provide a conscience clause for allowing parents to withhold their children from Hindi Classes . But Rajaji was firm in his stance . The police response to the agitation grew progressively brutal in 1939 . During the agitation , a total of 1 @,@ 198 protesters were arrested and out of them 1 @,@ 179 were convicted ( 73 of those jailed were women and 32 children accompanied their mothers to prison ) . Periyar was fined 1 @,@ 000 Rupees and sentenced to one year of rigorous imprisonment for inciting " women to disobey the law " ( he was released within six months on 22 May 1939 citing medical grounds ) and Annadurai was jailed for four months . On 7 June 1939 , all those arrested for participating in the agitations were released without explanation . Rajaji also organised pro @-@ Hindustani meetings to counter the agitators . On 29 October 1939 , the Congress government resigned protesting the involvement of India in the Second World War , and the Madras provincial government was placed under Governor 's rule . On 31 October , Periyar suspended the agitation and asked the Governor to withdraw the compulsory Hindi order . On 21 February 1940 , Governor Erskine issued a press communique withdrawing compulsory Hindi teaching and making it optional .

 During 1946 – 50 , there were sporadic agitations against Hindi by the Dravidar Kazhagam ( DK ) and Periyar . Whenever the government introduced Hindi as a compulsory language in schools , anti @-@ Hindi protests happened and succeeded in stopping the move . The largest anti @-@ Hindi imposition agitations in this period occurred in 1948 – 50 . After India obtained independence in 1947 , the Congress Government at the Centre urged all states to make Hindi compulsory in schools . The Congress Government of Madras Presidency under <unk> Ramasamy Reddiar complied and made Hindi compulsory from the academic year 1948 – 49 . It also introduced a minimum mark qualification in Hindi for the promotion of students to higher classes . Periyar once again launched an anti @-@ Hindi imposition agitation . The 1948 agitation was supported by former Congress nationalists like M. P. Sivagnanam and Thiru . Vi . Ka , who recanted their earlier pro @-@ Hindi policies . On 17 July , the DK convened an all party anti @-@ Hindi conference to oppose the compulsory Hindi teaching . As in the agitation of 1938 – 40 , this agitation was also characterized by strikes , black flag demonstrations and anti @-@ Hindi processions . When Rajaji ( then the Governor @-@ General of India ) visited Madras on 23 August , the DK staged a black flag demonstration protesting against his visit . On 27 August , Periyar and Annadurai were arrested . The Government did not change its position on Hindi and the agitation continued . On 18 December , Periyar and other DK leaders were arrested again . A compromise was reached between the government and agitators . The government stopped the legal action against the agitators and they in turn dropped the agitation on 26 December 1948 . Eventually , the government made Hindi teaching optional from the academic year 1950 – 51 . Students who did not want to learn Hindi were allowed to participate in other school activities during Hindi classes . 
 = = Official languages and the Indian Constitution = = 
 The Indian Constituent Assembly was established on 9 December 1946 , for drafting a Constitution when India became independent . The Constituent Assembly witnessed fierce debates on the language issue . The adoption of a " National Language " , the language in which the constitution was to be written in and the language in which the proceedings of the assembly were to be conducted were the main linguistic questions debated by the framers of the Constitution . On one side were the members from the Hindi @-@ speaking provinces like <unk> Rai Sastri , R.V. <unk> , Balkrishna Sharma , Purushottam Das Tandon , ( all from United Provinces ) , <unk> Gupta ( Bihar ) , Hari Vinayak <unk> ( Bombay ) and Ravi Shankar Shukla , Seth Govind Das ( Central Provinces and Berar ) . They moved a large number of pro @-@ Hindi amendments and argued for adopting Hindi as the sole National Language . On 10 December 1946 , <unk> declared " People who do not know Hindustani have no right to stay in India . People who are present in the House to fashion a constitution for India and do not know Hindustani are not worthy to be members of this assembly . They had better leave . " 
 The pro @-@ Hindi block was further divided into two camps : the Hindi faction comprising Tandon , Ravi Shankar Shukla , Govind Das , Sampurnanand , and K. M. Munshi ; and the Hindustani faction represented by Jawaharlal Nehru and Abul Kalam Azad . The adoption of Hindi as the national language was opposed by members from South India like T.T. Krishnamachari , G. <unk> , T. A. <unk> Chettiar , N. G. Ranga , N. Gopalaswamy Ayyangar ( all belonging to Madras ) and S. V. Krishnamurthy Rao ( Mysore ) . This anti @-@ Hindi block favoured retaining English as official language . Their views were reflected in the following pronouncement of Krishnamachari : 
 We disliked the English language in the past . I disliked it because I was forced to learn Shakespeare and Milton , for which I had no taste at all . If we are going to be compelled to learn Hindi , I would perhaps not be able to learn it because of my age , and perhaps I would not be willing to do it because of the amount of constraint you put on me . This kind of intolerance makes us fear that the strong Centre which we need , a strong Centre which is necessary will also mean the enslavement of people who do not speak the language at the centre . I would , Sir , convey a warning on behalf of people of the South for the reason that there are already elements in South India who want separation ... , and my honourable friends in U.P. do not help us in any way by flogging their idea of " Hindi Imperialism " to the maximum extent possible . So , it is up to my friends in Uttar Pradesh to have a whole India ; it is up to them to have a Hindi @-@ India . The choice is theirs . 
 After three years of debate , the assembly arrived at a compromise at the end of 1949 . It was called the Munshi @-@ Ayyangar formula ( after <unk> Munshi and Gopalaswamy Ayyangar ) and it struck a balance between the demands of all groups . Part XVII of the Indian Constitution was drafted according to this compromise . It did not have any mention of a " National Language " . Instead , it defined only the " Official Languages " of the Union : 
 Hindi in Devanagari script would be the official language of the Indian Union . For fifteen years , English would also be used for all official purposes ( Article 343 ) . A language commission could be convened after five years to recommend ways to promote Hindi as the sole official language and to phase out the use of English ( Article 344 ) . Official communication between states and between states and the Union would be in the official language of the union ( Article 345 ) <unk> would be used for all legal purposes – in court proceedings , bills , laws , rules and other regulations ( Article 348 ) .The Union was duty bound to promote the spread and usage of Hindi ( Article 351 ) . 
 India became independent on 15 August 1947 and the Constitution was adopted on 26 January 1950 . 
 = = The language commission = = 
 The adoption of English as official language along with Hindi was heavily criticized by pro @-@ Hindi politicians like Jana Sangh 's founder Syama Prasad Mookerjee , who demanded that Hindi should be made National language . Soon after the Constitution was adopted on 26 January 1950 , efforts were made to propagate Hindi for official usage . In 1952 , the Ministry of Education launched a voluntary Hindi teaching scheme . On 27 May 1952 , use of Hindi was introduced in warrants for judicial appointments . In 1955 , in @-@ house Hindi training was started for all ministries and departments of the central government . On 3 December 1955 , the government started using Hindi ( along with English ) for " specific purposes of the Union " 
 As provided for by Article 343 , Nehru appointed the First Official Language Commission under the chairmanship of B. G. Kher on 7 June 1955 . The commission delivered its report on 31 July 1956 . It recommended a number of steps to eventually replace English with Hindi ( The report had dissenting notes from two non @-@ Hindi members – P. Subbarayan from Madras State and Suniti Kumar Chatterji from West Bengal ) . The Parliamentary Committee on Official Language , chaired by Govind Ballabh Pant was constituted in September 1957 to review the Kher commission report . After two years of deliberations , the Pant Committee submitted its recommendations to the President on 8 February 1959 . It recommended that Hindi should be made the primary official language with English as the subsidiary one . The Kher Commission and the Pant Committee recommendations were condemned and opposed by from non @-@ Hindi politicians like Frank Anthony and P. Subbarayan . The Academy of Telugu opposed the switch from English to Hindi in a convention held in 1956 . Rajaji , once a staunch supporter of Hindi , organised an All India Language Conference ( attended by representatives of Tamil , Malayalam , Telugu , Assamese , Oriya , Marathi , Kannada and Bengali languages ) on 8 March 1958 to oppose the switch and declared " Hindi is as much foreign to non @-@ Hindi speaking people as English is to the protagonists of Hindi . " 
 As the opposition to Hindi grew stronger , Nehru tried to reassure the concerns of non @-@ Hindi speakers . Speaking in the parliamentary debate on a bill introduced by Anthony to include English in the Eighth Schedule , Nehru gave an assurance to them ( on 7 August 1959 ) : 
 I believe also two things . As I just said , there must be no imposition . Secondly , for an indefinite period – I do not know how long – I should have , I would have English as an associate , additional language which can be used not because of facilities and all that ... but because I do not wish the people of Non @-@ Hindi areas to feel that certain doors of advance are closed to them because they are forced to correspond – the Government , I mean – in the Hindi language . They can correspond in English . So I could have it as an alternate language as long as people require it and the decision for that – I would leave not to the Hindi @-@ knowing people , but to the non @-@ Hindi @-@ knowing people . 
 This assurance momentarily allayed the fears of the South Indians . But the Hindi proponents were dismayed and Pant remarked " Whatever I achieved in two years , the prime minister destroyed in less than two minutes " . 
 = = DMK 's anti @-@ Hindi policies = = 
 The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam ( DMK ) which split from the Dravidar Kazhagam in 1949 , inherited the anti @-@ Hindi policies of its parent organisation . DMK 's founder Annadurai had earlier participated in the anti @-@ Hindi imposition agitations during 1938 – 40 and in the 1940s . In July 1953 , the DMK launched an agitation for changing the name of a town – <unk> – to <unk> . They claimed that the town 's name ( after <unk> <unk> ) symbolised the exploitation of South India by the North . On 15 July 1953 , M. Karunanidhi ( later Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu ) and other DMK members erased the Hindi name in <unk> railway station 's name board and lay down on the tracks . In the altercation with the Police that followed the protests , two DMK members lost their lives and several others including Karunanidhi and <unk> were arrested . 
 In the 1950s DMK continued its anti @-@ Hindi policies along with the secessionist demand for Dravidistan . On 28 January 1956 , Annadurai along with Periyar and Rajaji signed a resolution passed by the Academy of Tamil Culture endorsing the continuation of English as the official language . On 21 September 1957 the DMK convened an anti @-@ Hindi Conference to protest against the imposition of Hindi . It observed 13 October 1957 as " anti @-@ Hindi Day " . On 31 July 1960 , another open air anti @-@ Hindi conference was held at <unk> , Madras . In November 1963 , DMK dropped its secessionist demand in the wake of the Sino @-@ Indian War and the passage of the anti @-@ secessionist 16th Amendment to the Indian Constitution . But the anti @-@ Hindi stance remained and hardened with the passage of Official Languages Act of 1963 . The DMK 's view on Hindi 's qualifications for official language status were reflected in Annadurai 's response to the " numerical superiority of Hindi " argument : " If we had to accept the principle of numerical superiority while selecting our national bird , the choice would have fallen not on the peacock but on the common crow . " 
 = = Official Languages Act of 1963 = = 
 As the deadline stipulated in Part XVII of the Constitution for switching to Hindi as primary official language approached , the central government stepped up its efforts to spread Hindi 's official usage . In 1960 , compulsory training for Hindi typing and stenography was started . The same year , India 's president Rajendra Prasad acted on the Pant Committee 's recommendations and issued orders for preparation of Hindi glossaries , translating procedural literature and legal codes to Hindi , imparting Hindi education to government employees and other efforts for propagating Hindi . 
 To give legal status to Nehru 's assurance of 1959 , the Official Languages Act was passed in 1963 . In Nehru 's own words : 
 This is a Bill , in continuation of what has happened in the past , to remove a restriction which had been placed by the Constitution on the use of English after a certain date i.e. 1965 . It is just to remove that restriction that this is placed . 
 The Bill was introduced in Parliament on 21 January 1963 . Opposition to the Bill came from DMK members who objected to the usage of the word " may " instead of " shall " in section 3 of the Bill . That section read : " the English language may ... continue to be used in addition to Hindi " . The DMK argued was that the term " may " could be interpreted as " may not " by future administrations . They feared that the minority opinion would not be considered and non @-@ Hindi speakers ' views would be ignored . On 22 April , Nehru assured the parliamentarians that , for that particular case " may " had the same meaning as " shall " . The DMK then demanded , if that was the case why " shall " was not used instead of " may " . Leading the opposition to the Bill was Annadurai ( then a Member of the Rajya Sabha ) . He pleaded for an indefinite continuation of the status quo and argued that continued use of English as official language would " distribute advantages or disadvantages evenly " among Hindi and non @-@ Hindi speakers . The Bill was passed on 27 April without any change in the wording . As he had warned earlier , Annadurai launched statewide protests against Hindi . In November 1963 , Annadurai was arrested along with 500 DMK members for burning part XVII of the Constitution at an anti @-@ Hindi Conference . He was sentenced to six months in prison . On 25 January 1964 , a DMK member , <unk> , committed suicide at Trichy by self @-@ immolation , to protest the " imposition of Hindi " . He was claimed as the first " language martyr " of the second round of the anti @-@ Hindi struggle by the DMK . 
 Nehru died in May 1964 and Lal Bahadur Shastri became Prime Minister of India . Shastri and his senior cabinet members Morarji Desai and <unk> Lal Nanda were strong supporters of Hindi being the sole official language . This increased the apprehension that Nehru 's assurances of 1959 and 1963 will not be kept despite Shastri 's assurances to the contrary . Concerns over the preference of Hindi in central government jobs , civil service examinations and the fear that English would be replaced with Hindi as medium of instruction brought students into the anti @-@ Hindi imposition agitation camp in large numbers . On 7 March 1964 , the chief minister of Madras State , M. Bhaktavatsalam at a session of the Madras Legislative Assembly recommended the introduction of Three @-@ language formula ( English , Hindi and Tamil ) in the state . <unk> over the Three @-@ language formula increased student support for the anti @-@ Hindi cause . 
 = = Agitation of 1965 = = 
 As 26 January 1965 approached , the anti @-@ Hindi imposition agitation in Madras State grew in numbers and urgency . The Tamil Nadu Students Anti Hindi Agitation Council was formed in January as an umbrella student organisation to coordinate the anti @-@ Hindi efforts . The office bearers of the council were student union leaders from all over Madras State including P. Seenivasan , K. <unk> , Jeeva Kalaimani , Na . <unk> , <unk> , Ravichandran , Tiruppur . S. Duraiswamy , <unk> Muthaiah , Durai Murugan , K. Raja Mohammad , <unk> , M. Natarajan and L. Ganesan . 
 Several student conferences were organised throughout the state to protest against Hindi imposition . On 17 January , the Madras State Anti @-@ Hindi Conference was convened at Trichy and was attended by 700 delegates from Madras , Maharashtra , Kerala and Mysore . They called for the indefinite suspension of Part XVII of the constitution . The Home and Information & Broadcasting ministries of the central government ( headed by Nanda and Indira Gandhi respectively ) upped the ante and issued circulars for replacing English with Hindi from 26 January . On 16 January , Annadurai announced that 26 January ( also the Republic Day of India ) would be observed as a day of mourning . Chief minister Bhaktavatsalam warned that the state government would not tolerate the sanctity of the Republic day blasphemed and threatened the students with " stern action " if they participated in politics . The DMK advanced the " Day of Mourning " by a day . On 25 January , Annadurai was taken into preventive custody along with 3000 DMK members to forestall the agitations planned for the next day . On 26 January , 50 @,@ 000 students from Madras city 's colleges marched from Napier park to the Government secretariat at Fort St. George and unsuccessfully tried to petition the chief minister . 
 On 25 January , a clash between agitating students and Congress party workers in Madurai went out of control and became a riot . Rioting soon spread to other parts of the State . Police responded with lathi charges and firing on student processions . Acts of arson , looting and damage to public property became common . Railway cars and Hindi name boards at railway stations were burned down ; telegraph poles were cut and railway tracks displaced . The Bhaktavatsalam Government considered the situation as a law and order problem and brought in para military forces to quell the agitation . Incensed by police action , violent mobs killed two police men . Several agitators committed suicide by self @-@ immolation and by consuming poison . In two weeks of riots , around 70 people were killed ( by official estimates ) . Some unofficial reports put the death toll as high as 500 . A large number of students were arrested . The damage to property was assessed as ten million Rupees . 
 On 28 January , classes in Madras University , Annamalai University and other colleges and schools in the state were suspended indefinitely . Within the Congress , opinion was divided : one group led by K. Kamaraj wanted the government not to impose Hindi on the Tamils ; but others like Morarji Desai did not relent . Home minister Nanda agreed with Bhaktavatsalam 's handling of the agitation . Rioting continued throughout the first week of February and by the second week students lost control of the agitation . Violence continued despite Annadurai 's appeal for calm . Efforts were made by both sides to find a compromise . On 11 February , C. Subramaniam and O. V. <unk> , two union ministers from Madras state , resigned protesting the government 's language policy . President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan refused to accept the Prime Minister Shastri 's recommendation that their resignations be accepted . Shastri backed down and made a broadcast through All India Radio on 11 February . Expressing shock over the riots , he promised to honour Nehru 's assurances . He also assured Tamils that English would continue to be used for centre @-@ state and intrastate communications and that the All India Civil Services examination would continue to be conducted in English . 
 = = = Impact = = = 
 Shastri 's assurances calmed down the volatile situation . On 12 February , the students council postponed the agitation indefinitely and on 16 February , C. Subramaniam and O. V. <unk> withdrew their resignations . Sporadic acts of protests and violence continued to happen throughout February and early March . On 7 March , the administration withdrew all the cases filed against the student leaders and on 14 March , the Anti @-@ Hindi imposition Agitation Council dropped the agitation . Shastri 's <unk> angered the pro @-@ Hindi activists in North India . Members of Jan Sangh went about the streets of New Delhi , blackening out English signs with tar . The agitation slowly changed into a general anti @-@ Congress organisation . In the 1967 election , student leader P. Seenivasan contested against Kamaraj in the Virudhunagar constituency . A large number of students from all over the state campaigned for him and ensured his victory : the Congress party was defeated and DMK came to power for the first time in Madras State . 
 The Anti @-@ Hindi imposition agitations in Tamil Nadu also had a considerable impact on the neighbouring states of Andhra Pradesh , Mysore and Kerala . The 1965 agitations evoked a strong response from the Tamils of Bangalore city . In Mysore , over 2000 agitators gathered to protest Hindi and the police had to launch a lathi charge when the agitation grew violent . In Andhra Pradesh , trains were damaged and colleges were shut down .

 = = = Amendment efforts in 1965 = = = 
 Efforts to amend the Official Languages Act according to Shastri 's assurances given in February 1965 faced stiff resistance from the pro @-@ Hindi lobby . On 16 February 55 MPs from 8 different states publicly expressed their disapproval of any change in the Language policy . On 19 February 19 MPs from Maharashtra and Gujarat voiced their opposition for change and on 25 February 106 Congress MPs met the Prime Minister to request him not to amend the Act . However , Congress MPs from Madras did not debate the issue on the Parliament floor but met the Prime Minister on 12 March . Congress and opposition parties hesitated to debate the issue in Parliament as they did not wish to make their bitter divisions in public . On 22 February at a meeting in Congress Working Committee , K. Kamaraj pressed for the amendment to Official Languages Act , but received instant opposition from Morarji Desai , Jagjivan Ram and Ram <unk> . The Congress working committee finally agreed to a resolution which amounted to slowing down of Hindi @-@ <unk> , strong implementation of the three language formula in Hindi and non @-@ Hindi speaking states , and conduct of the public services exam in all regional languages . These decisions were agreed upon during the Chief Ministers ' meeting which was held on 24 February . 
 The three language formula was not strictly enforced either in South or Hindi @-@ speaking areas . The changes to public services exams were impractical and not well received by government officials . The only real concession to the south was the assurance that the Official Languages Act would be modified . However , any effort to follow through with that pledge received stiff resistance . In April 1965 , a meeting of a cabinet sub @-@ committee comprising <unk> lal Nanda , A. K. Sen , <unk> Sinha , Mahavir Tyagi , M. C. <unk> and S. K. Patil and but no southern members debated the issue and could not come to any agreement . The sub @-@ committee recommended the continuation of English and Hindi as joint link languages and was not in favour of either quota system or use of regional languages in public services exams . They drafted an amendment to Official Languages Act incorporating Nehru 's assurances explicitly . This Bill guaranteeing the use of English in inter @-@ state and state @-@ Union communications as long as desired by Non @-@ Hindi states was approved for discussion by the Speaker on 25 August . But it was withdrawn after a bitter debate citing inopportune time due to the ongoing Punjabi Suba movement and Kashmir crisis at that time .

 Shastri died in January 1966 and Indira Gandhi became prime minister . The election of 1967 saw Congress retaining power with a reduced majority in the Centre . In Madras State , Congress was defeated and DMK came to power thanks to the support of the entire student community who had taken up the challenge thrown by Kamaraj to defeat him in the elections . The Students ' Election Army did door to door campaign urging people to vote against Congress to teach them a lesson for all the atrocities committed by the Bhaktavatsalam Government to students under Defence of India Rules etc . , <unk> defeated Kamaraj in Virudhunagar . In November 1967 , a new attempt to amend the Bill was made . On 27 November , the Bill was tabled in Parliament ; it was passed on 16 December ( by 205 votes to 41 against ) . It received presidential assent on 8 January 1968 and came into effect . The Amendment modified section 3 of the 1963 Act to guarantee the " virtual indefinite policy of bilingualism " ( English and Hindi ) in official transactions .

 The anti @-@ Hindi activists from Madras State were not satisfied with the 1967 Amendment , as it did not address their concerns about the three language formula . However , with DMK in power , they hesitated to restart the agitation . The Tamil Nadu Students ' Anti @-@ Hindi imposition Agitation council split into several factions . The moderate factions favored letting Annadurai and the government to deal with the situation . The extremist factions restarted the agitations . They demanded scrapping of the three language formula and an end to teaching of Hindi , abolishing the use of Hindi commands in the National Cadet Corps ( NCC ) , banning of Hindi films and songs and closure of the Dakshina Bharat Hindi <unk> Sabha ( Institution for Propagation of Hindi in South India ) . 
 On 19 December 1967 , the agitation was restarted . It turned violent on 21 December and acts of arson and looting were reported in the state . Annadurai defused the situation by accepting most of their demands . On 23 January 1968 , a resolution was passed in the Legislative Assembly . It accomplished the following : 
 The Three @-@ Language Policy was scrapped and Hindi was eliminated from the curriculum . Only English and Tamil were to be taught and the use of Hindi commands in the NCC was banned . Tamil was to be introduced as the medium of instruction in all colleges and as the " language of administration " within five years , the Central Government was urged to end the special status accorded to Hindi in the Constitution and " treat all languages equally " , and was urged to provide financial assistance for development of all languages mentioned in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution . These measures satisfied the agitators and " normalcy " returned by February 1968 . 
 = = Agitation of 1986 = = 
 In 1986 , Indian Prime minister Rajiv Gandhi introduced the " National Education Policy " . This education policy provided for setting up Navodaya Schools , where the DMK claimed teaching of Hindi would be compulsory . The Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam ( ADMK ) led by M. G. Ramachandran ( which had split from the DMK in 1972 ) , was in power in Tamil Nadu and the DMK was the main opposition party . Karunanidhi announced an agitation against the opening of Navodaya schools in Tamil Nadu . The Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya program , supported fully by the Ministry of Human Resource Development , was established to identify gifted and talented students from economically disadvantaged and historically neglected communities , throughout every state and Union Territory in India and provide for them an education on par with elite residential schools traditionally available in India only for children of the wealthy as well as children of the political class . On 13 November , the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly unanimously passed a resolution demanding the repeal of Part XVII of the constitution and for making English the sole official language of the union . 
 On 17 November 1986 , DMK members protested against the new education policy by burning Part XVII of the Constitution . 20 @,@ 000 DMK members , including Karunanidhi , were arrested . 21 persons committed suicide by self @-@ immolation . Karunanidhi was sentenced to ten weeks of rigorous imprisonment . Ten DMK MLAs including K. <unk> were expelled from the Legislative Assembly by the speaker P. H. Pandian . Rajiv Gandhi assured Members of Parliament from Tamil Nadu that Hindi would not be imposed . As part of the compromise , <unk> schools were not started in Tamil Nadu . Currently , Tamil Nadu is the only state in India without Navodaya schools .

 In 2014 , the Home Ministry ordered that “ government employees and officials of all ministries , departments , corporations or banks , who have made official accounts on social networking sites should use Hindi , or both Hindi and English but give priority to Hindi ” . This move was immediately opposed by all the political parties in Tamil Nadu . Terming the move on use of Hindi as being " against letter and spirit " of the Official Languages Act the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa cautioned that this direction may “ cause disquiet to the people of Tamil Nadu who are very proud of and passionate about their linguistic heritage . ” and asked the Prime Minister of India to suitably modify the instructions to ensure that English was the language of communication on social media . The major opposition party Indian National Congress advised prudence , expressing fear that such directions may result in a backlash in non @-@ Hindi states , especially Tamil Nadu and also said that the “ Government would be well @-@ advised to proceed with caution , ” . These protests ensured the continuous official usage of English . 
 = = Impact = = 
 The anti @-@ Hindi imposition agitations of 1937 – 40 and 1940 – 50 led to a change of guard in the Madras Presidency . The main opposition party to the Indian National Congress in the state , the Justice Party , came under Periyar 's leadership on 29 December 1938 . In 1944 , the Justice Party was renamed as Dravidar Kazhagam . The political careers of many later leaders of the Dravidian Movement , such as C. N. Annadurai and M. Karunanidhi , started with their participation in these agitations . The agitations stopped the compulsory teaching of Hindi in the state . The agitations of the 1960s played a crucial role in the defeat of the Tamil Nadu Congress party in the 1967 elections and the continuing dominance of Dravidian parties in Tamil Nadu politics . Many political leaders of the DMK and ADMK , like P. Seenivasan , K. <unk> , Durai Murugan , Tiruppur . S. Duraiswamy , <unk> Muthaiah , K. Raja Mohammad , M. Natarajan and L. Ganesan , owe their entry and advancement in politics to their stints as student leaders during the agitations , which also reshaped the Dravidian Movement and broadened its political base , when it shifted from its earlier pro @-@ Tamil ( and anti @-@ Brahmin ) stance to a more inclusive one , which was both anti @-@ Hindi and pro @-@ English . Finally , the current two @-@ language education policy followed in Tamil Nadu is also a direct result of the agitations . 
 In the words of <unk> Ramaswamy ( Professor of History at Duke University ) , 
 [ The anti @-@ Hindi imposition agitations knit ] together diverse , even incompatible , social and political interests ... Their common cause against Hindi had thrown together religious revivalists like Maraimalai <unk> ( 1876 – 1950 ) with avowed atheists like Ramasami and Bharathidasan ( 1891 – 1964 ) ; men who supported the Indian cause like T.V. Kalyanasundaram ( 1883 – 1953 ) and M. P. Sivagnanam with those who wanted to secede from India like Annadurai and M. Karunanidhi ( b . 1924 ) ; university professors like <unk> Bharati ( 1879 – 1959 ) and M.S. <unk> Pillai ( 1866 <unk> ) with uneducated street poets , populist pamphleteers and college students . 
 The anti @-@ Hindi imposition agitations ensured the passage of the Official Languages Act of 1963 and its amendment in 1967 , thus ensuring the continued use of English as an official language of India . They effectively brought about the " virtual indefinite policy of bilingualism " of the Indian Republic .

He notes that they were presented to the world as the embodiment of what was wrong with college sports because they wore revolutionary baggy shorts and black socks and blasted hip @-@ hop music while talking a lot of trash . The film documents the " formation , rise , scandal and epilogue of the team " . It documents the 1991 – 92 and 1992 – 93 teams , the University of Michigan basketball scandal , and related off the court issues such as hate mail . Forbes notes that the legacy of the quintet , which includes successive appearances in the championship game of the NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Championship , was overshadowed by the scandal , which necessitated the removal of Final Four banners and vacating of games . The film is noted for presenting the inside story a group of players who the contemporary media derided as thugs and villains , while enterprise rode them as a multimillion @-@ dollar merchandising juggernaut . 
 The film chronicles a group of athletes who influenced a nation of basketball fans – some of whom became professional basketball players . It includes commentaries from former Michigan coaches Steve Fisher , Brian Dutcher , and Perry Watson , and rap icons Ice Cube and Chuck D. It also extends to details such as : " Howard discussing his grandmother 's death the day he signed his letter of intent , to Ray Jackson talking about being ' the fifth wheel ' and considering a transfer , to Jimmy King 's brutal honesty about his disdain for Christian Laettner -- in somewhat unpalatable verbiage , to Rose talking about the loitering ticket he got in the Detroit ' crack house . ' " The film also presented numerous other highlights of the era as well as some from the high school days of the featured players . Webber was considered notable for his non @-@ involvement in the production , while the rest of the Fab Five were credited as executive producers . Rose approached ESPN Films about the project and brought the other players into the fold . His production role came through his own company , Three Tier Entertainment . The film was directed by Jason <unk> and narrated by Taye Diggs . 
 At first , only three of the freshmen started . Although they all played when the season opened on December 2 , 1991 against the University of Detroit , they did not all play at the same time until December 7 against Eastern Michigan and did not start regularly until February 9 , 1992 . In that first game starting together as a regular unit , the five freshmen accounted for all the team 's points in a 74 – 65 victory against Notre Dame . The film presented the opinions of upperclassmen Eric Riley and James <unk> when they were replaced by freshmen in the starting lineup . Both fought off impulses to transfer . 
 The four members of the Fab Five who participated in the film have had a tense relationship with Chris Webber , the one player who was not in the film . There was speculation that Chris Webber did not participate to avoid questions about the timeout call in the 1993 NCAA tournament title game . Webber said he initially agreed to be in the documentary but backed out after being told shooting would wrap up in a week , giving him insufficient time to prepare . Jimmy King called that assertion “ a flat @-@ out lie . ”

 ESPN built up the film with nearly a month of previews and promos . The week before the initial broadcast , ESPN aired clips of the film during some of its other programming ; they featured the team 's feelings about Duke prior to the 1992 championship game . These clips started what would become a national controversy . 
 The film 's initial airing established a record as the ratings leader among all ESPN documentaries with a 2 @.@ 1 rating according to Nielsen Company , surpassing two of the 30 for 30 films , each of which posted a 1 @.@ 8 rating : Pony Exce $ $ ( aired December 11 , 2010 , focusing on SMU football of the 1980s , a decade that culminated in scandal ) and The U ( aired December 12 , 2009 , detailing the University of Miami football team in the 1980s and 1990s ) . The Fab Five aired at 9 p.m. ET , drawing an average of 2 @,@ 088 @,@ 000 households and 2 @,@ 746 @,@ 000 viewers , both bests among ESPN documentaries ; it surpassed the previous high marks set by Pony Exce $ $ , when it was seen by an average of 1 @,@ 843 @,@ 000 homes and 2 @,@ 517 @,@ 000 viewers on ESPN . The Fab Five was rebroadcast at 11 p.m. on ESPN2 . In excess of 11 million people watched part of the movie on one of the two original national broadcasts on the day of the 2011 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament selections . 
 The Fab Five also garnered high TV ratings during their playing days ; they were one of the featured teams in both of the two highest rated NCAA Men 's Basketball Championship games ever played in terms of households ( although not viewers ) , The film aired almost precisely twenty years after the legendary group was assembled . In an attempt to meet the same college basketball fan viewer interest on the tournament selection weekend , HBO produced its own hour @-@ long documentary titled Runnin ’ Rebels of UNLV on Jerry <unk> and the UNLV Runnin ' Rebels basketball teams of the 1972 – 92 era . Fox Sports also aired an hour @-@ long special featuring sports agent Rob Pelinka , a Michigan teammate of the Fab Five , called Pelinka Chips In on March 14 , but the special had low ratings . Pelinka had a cameo in the Fab Five film . ⋅ 
 = = Critical review = = 
 The New York Times described the film as a " flashback to a time when baggy basketball shorts , hip @-@ hop music and black shoes were considered controversial and an affront to hoops purists " . Washington Post columnist Jason Reid noted that the film went out of its way to present the inappropriate racial commentary by Jalen Rose when he described Duke basketball head coach Mike Krzyzewski 's recruits as Uncle Toms . Among those critical of the racial commentary was Duke player Grant Hill , who was cited in an Associated Press story that ran in major national media outlets . Hill blogged on The New York Times with a response naming a litany of <unk> castigated by Rose 's general aspersions . His response was at the top of The New York Times ' " most @-@ emailed list " for several days and was shared on Facebook by nearly 100 @,@ 000 people within its first few days . King responded to Hill in The Wall Street Journal . In the midst of the media exchange , the 2011 editions of the teams advanced to meet on March 20 at 2011 NCAA Tournament West Regional in Charlotte , North Carolina , at the Time Warner Cable Arena with Duke ranked as a # 1 seed and Michigan as an # 8 seed . Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski did not respond until after both teams were eliminated from the tournament , but he noted that he felt the statements were insulting and gave specific reasons why each of the Fab Five members did not go to Duke . Duke player and Michigan native Shane Battier supported Hill 's statements saying , " Maya Angelou couldn ’ t have written it and expressed it better . " 
 The Detroit Free Press ' Mark Snyder regarded The Fab Five as a " Warts and all " depiction . He went on to describe it as a " . . .a tour de force of information from coaches . . .to the scorned upperclassmen . . . , then @-@ Free Press beat writer Greg <unk> and the Detroit News ' Bryan Burwell , and even rappers Ice Cube and Chuck D reflecting on the style elements . . . " The article concluded by summarizing the film as " riveting , brutal in its honesty , realistic in its language and stunning in its archival footage " . One reviewer , however , felt that the reserves were a bit overlooked . 
 A Michigan writer from The Grand Rapids Press described the film as " youthful nostalgia that must be felt by a whole generation " , but noted that the film was lacking in terms of outside perspective . He noted that fans would have welcomed voices of Bobby Knight , Dick Vitale , Jimmy Jackson , or Christian Laettner . He also noted the absence of Webber 's voice as leaving the film with a hole . However , he noted that as much as the Fab Five revolutionized basketball in the American culture , this film remade the image of the Fab Five . Nonetheless , some questioned why Webber declined to participate and speculate on various reasons . 
 Another Michigan writer from SB Nation described the film as thorough in its ability to provide the viewer with the answers to natural intrigues such as : " How was the recruiting class assembled ? Who pushed for the baggy shorts ? The black socks ? How did a stodgy University of Michigan culture react to this bold , brash and outspoken team ? " Other columnists were also satisfied to learn that Rose came up with the shorts and Jackson came up with the socks . He also commended the film on its detail surrounding Chris Webber 's infamous timeout in the 1993 NCAA championship . The same reviewer enumerated his five biggest omissions from the film : Michigan athletic director Bill Martin , 1991 – 92 Duke Blue Devils men 's basketball team , 1992 – 93 North Carolina Tar Heels men 's basketball team , Michael Talley and Webber . He was also critical of Mitch Albom 's involvement with the Fab Five . 
 Rivals.com spoke against the tone of the film , which shows a lack of respect for team values . However , in describing the payment scandal , Webber 's related legal problems and the removal of the Fab Five 's banners from Crisler Arena , and the infamous timeout gaffe at the end of the 1993 national championship game at the 1993 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament the documentary was considered fearless . 
 Another controversy arose from the film when the Illinois Fighting Illini men 's basketball teams of the late 1980s with Kendall Gill and Stephen Bardo claimed to be the originators of baggy shorts in basketball . All of the Wolverines who took part in the production of the film described how they felt they originated the baggy shorts as a result of Rose 's request . Even rapper Ice Cube described his recollection of them as the originators .

 San Juan Creek , also called the San Juan River , is a 29 @-@ mile ( 47 km ) stream in Orange County , California that consists of a catchment basin encompassing 133 @.@ 9 square miles ( 347 km2 ) . Its mainstem rises in the Santa Ana Mountains , in the Trabuco Ranger District of the Cleveland National Forest . From there it runs parallel to the Ortega Highway as it winds west and south through San Juan Canyon , where it is joined by numerous small tributaries , and is joined by Trabuco Creek , its main branch as it passes through San Juan Capistrano . It flows into the Pacific Ocean at Doheny State Beach . Once out of the foothills , San Juan Creek flows through the city of San Juan Capistrano where groundwater flow direction generally is from the northeast to the southwest . Groundwater in this basin at the San Juan Capistrano reach is considered good . Recent efforts of stream conservation have been in the planning stage including habitat conservation plan work . 
 Historically , the San Juan Creek watershed was inhabited by the Acjachemen , now Juañeno Indians . The Juañeno received their current name from Spanish conquistadors in the 1770s , who built Mission San Juan Capistrano very near San Juan Creek , giving it its name . After the Spanish settlement , development in the watershed continued to grow and pollution of the creek has increased . The construction of Dana Point Harbor in 1960 increased the pollution of San Juan Creek at its mouth , posing an increasing danger to visitors of Doheny State Beach . In the late 1990s and early 21st century , floods destroyed many river control structures in the San Juan watershed , and the risk of floods continues to grow . 
 Although the San Juan watershed was formerly rich in biodiversity , with sixteen major plant communities and hundreds of species of birds , invertebrates , mammals , and others , the watershed is projected to be 48 percent developed by the year 2050 . Many reaches of open land in the San Juan watershed are now heavily developed , and urban runoff coming from residential communities is taking an increased toll on the creek and its tributaries . Although the mainstem San Juan Creek does not have any major water diversions or dams , its tributaries are heavily affected , most notably Trabuco and Oso Creeks . 
 = = Course = = 
 San Juan Creek begins high in the Santa Ana Mountains southwest of Lake Elsinore , at the head of the steep and narrow San Juan Canyon , at roughly 1 @,@ 690 feet ( 520 m ) in elevation where Morrell Canyon Creek , draining the western Elsinore Mountains and southernmost Santa Ana Mountains , has its confluence with Bear Canyon Creek . From there , it flows steeply downhill over riffles and waterfalls , and paralleling California State Route 74 , here known as the Ortega Highway , as it winds through the rocky gorge . It drops over San Juan Falls , a 15 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) cascade , then crosses under an arch bridge that carries the Ortega Highway . It is joined by Hot Springs Creek and Cold Springs Creek on the right bank , while Lucas Canyon Creek meets it on the left . 
 Once out of the mountains , San Juan Creek proceeds to meander through a broad and shallow farming and ranching valley underlain by thick alluvial deposits . The creek swings west to receive Bell Canyon on the right , from several residential communities that overlook , but do not border , it. and Verdugo Canyon Creek from the left . Trampas Canyon enters from the left and Cañada <unk> and Cañada Chiquita enter from the right . The creek then crosses under Interstate 5 , and enters a flood control channel , turning south and receiving El Horno Creek on the right . It receives its largest tributary , Trabuco Creek , on the right bank , then continues south and east to the Pacific Ocean . Before it reaches the sea , however , it enters a lagoon at the northern end of Doheny State Beach , which occasionally spills into Capistrano Bay .

 All direct tributaries of San Juan Creek , from mouth to source , are listed . The list also includes streams that join major tributaries .

 = = = Rocks and topography = = = 
 The geology of the San Juan Creek watershed is complex , but can be described as having many seismic fault zones , with streams tending to follow these fault zones where canyons have formed , and having extremely erosive soils . The alluvial floodplain of San Juan Creek tends to have very deep concentrations in lower reaches and are said to be poorly drained . Soil types in the San Juan watershed can be divided into the Metz @-@ San <unk> , Sorrento @-@ Mocho , <unk> . Alo @-@ <unk> , Cieneba @-@ Anaheim @-@ Soper , and Friant @-@ Cieneba @-@ Exchequer associations , in order from most level to steepest . Sedimentary bedrock composes many hillsides in the San Juan watershed , and poses a landslide danger during earthquakes , severe erosion or other events that may cause failure of hillside stability . 
 There are also several seismic faults within the watershed . These include a fault line ( <unk> ) running along Oso Creek northeast @-@ southwest , passing offshore 7 miles ( 11 km ) south of the mouth of San Juan Creek , as well as another fault zone ( Mission Viejo ) that parallels the <unk> but ends far more south , in San Diego County . In summary , the San Juan watershed can be considered as being bisected by two faults , running through its approximate center . The first recorded earthquake in the area partially destroyed Mission San Juan Capistrano in 1812 , followed by others in 1862 , 1933 and 1938 . 
 The uplift of the San Joaquin Hills , a small coastal mountain range generally following the Pacific coast of Orange County , created a physical barrier for streams flowing off the Santa Ana Mountains . But by the Wisconsinian Glaciation , an enormous climate change helped solve that problem . During the Wisconsinian Glaciation , a period of time that lasted from about 70 @,@ 000 to 10 @,@ 000 years ago , glaciers and ice sheets moved south from Canada into the northern United States , radically altering the climate of the entire continent . The arid Southern California climate was supplanted by a temperate rainforest climate that would receive rainfall in excess of 80 to 90 inches ( 2 @,@ 000 to 2 @,@ 300 mm ) per year . San Juan Creek and other streams along the South Coast became powerful rivers that cut their way through the San Joaquin Hills , but this condition reverted by the end of the period . Several wet periods did occur throughout the Ice Age , but the Wisconsinian was the largest . 
 = = = Hydrology and groundwater = = = 
 Groundwater in the San Juan Creek basin , also referred to as the " San Juan Creek Groundwater Basin " , has a total volume of roughly 900 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 1 @.@ 1 × 109 m3 ) . ( California State Water Resources Control Board , 1977 . ) Natural groundwater recharge in the San Juan basin is estimated to be roughly 160 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 200 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m3 ) per year historically , mostly from precipitation . This amount has been reduced due to extensive development of the lower segment of the watershed , which is continuing to reduce the amount of open ground that can potentially serve in groundwater recharge . Artificially sourced water from irrigation and other uses is responsible for recharging roughly 37 @,@ 500 acre feet ( 46 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 m3 ) annually . The watershed is essentially split into half by the <unk> and Mission Viejo fault zones , which result in the division of the " Upper " and " Lower " groundwater basins . The groundwater mostly lies in alluvium , which ranges from a depth of 200 feet ( 61 m ) in the lower watershed to mostly none in the upper reaches of the watershed . 
 Historically , the total surface outflow from the San Juan basin into the Pacific was calculated at 5 @,@ 200 acre feet ( 6 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 m3 ) annually . Increasing urban development , resulting in increased runoff from irrigation and other sources , brought the annual outflow to 7 @,@ 800 acre feet ( 9 @,@ 600 @,@ 000 m3 ) as of 1993 . The maximum annual yield is 9 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 11 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m3 ) . Although water from San Juan Creek , tributaries and basin groundwater are increasingly used for a limited amount of agricultural and municipal purposes , the annual yield from the watershed is continually increasing . As the groundwater recharge rate of the watershed is relatively high , it is safe to assume that groundwater levels will recover quickly from human use and human @-@ induced pollution . 
 Due to the lower amount of urbanization in the San Juan watershed as compared with other watersheds in the county , the 100 @-@ year flood inundation risk is also significantly lower than that of most of the nearby watersheds . It has been calculated that a 100 @-@ year flood in the watershed would only affect a roughly 0 @.@ 5 mi ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) wide area for the lower reaches of San Juan Creek inside San Juan Capistrano , while for Trabuco Creek , only a 0 @.@ 2 mi ( 0 @.@ 32 km ) wide area would be affected , mainly due to severe downcutting . A fact of note is that the failure of the earthen Trampas Canyon Dam ( in Trampas Canyon , 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) upstream of San Juan Capistrano ) would actually create a <unk> slightly larger than that of the 100 year flood that would race down San Juan Creek to its mouth . However , many levees in the San Juan area are still inadequately suited to a 100 @-@ year flood , regardless of the extent . 
 = = Watershed = = 
 The Santa Ana Mountains occupy most of the north , east and south parts of the approximately 133 @.@ 9 @-@ square @-@ mile ( 347 km2 ) San Juan Creek watershed , while the San Joaquin Hills and one of their small subranges border the watershed on the southwest , east , and northwest . The three major tributaries , San Juan , Trabuco and Bell Creeks , all originate in the Santa Ana Mountains . There are four main alluvial river valleys in the watershed , drained by San Juan , Trabuco , Oso and Bell Creeks . The San Juan Creek valley occupies the south portion of the watershed , running roughly south before spreading wider near the coast , and running northeast until it turns sharply to the southeast to meet the Pacific Ocean at the city of Dana Point . The Trabuco Creek valley runs west from the northeasternmost portion of the watershed , then gradually becomes wider in a section called the Plano Trabuco then it joins the smaller , urbanized valley of Oso Creek , which runs primarily south . The combined valley then runs southward to merge with the San Juan Creek valley in San Juan Capistrano . The Bell Creek valley is narrower , beginning a few miles south of Trabuco Canyon , California , and running in an almost perfectly straight southward course to San Juan Creek , which at this point is shortly out of the uppermost reach of its watershed , San Juan Canyon . There are 19 other major creeks in the watershed , including <unk> Canyon Creek and El Horno Creek , both of which drain parts of the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains . 
 San Juan Creek is considered as part of the 500 @-@ square @-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 300 km2 ) San Juan <unk> Unit , which is a coastal region running from central @-@ south Orange County to the north extent of San Diego County , which borders Orange County on the south . The hydrologic unit also covers the watersheds of Aliso Creek , Salt Creek , Prima <unk> Cañada , Segunda <unk> Cañada , and San Mateo Creek , in order from north to south . Elevation above sea level ranges from 0 to 5 @,@ 700 feet ( 0 to 1 @,@ 737 m ) , and precipitation in the hydrologic unit ranges from 12 to 16 inches ( 300 to 410 mm ) annually . Except for San Mateo Creek , all of the other streams in the unit have a relatively developed watershed . San Juan Creek receives extra runoff from agriculture , urban activities , commercial irrigation , and other human @-@ induced sources , which creates an extra unnatural flow ( consisting of urban runoff and agricultural return flows ) . This runoff is often polluted by trash , heavy metals , and oil received while running over pavement , and pesticides and fertilizer if draining farmland . A specific point of concern in the watershed is Oso Creek . A Southern California environmentalist , Michael Hazzard , said after diving into Upper Oso Creek Reservoir to retrieve an outboard motor : 
 I spent three days diving to retrieve an outboard motor and my skin broke out in hives and boils and my gallbladder suffered and I later had six operations over a 21 ⁄ 2 @-@ year period . 
 = = = Wildlife = = = 
 San Juan Creek was originally rich in riparian zones and other habitats in both its upper and lower watershed , with wetlands totaling over 300 acres ( 1 @.@ 2 km2 ) historically in the lower reaches , before the rapid population explosion of Orange County began . There are 16 major vegetation zones in the watershed . Currently , the total wetland acreage in the watershed is 3 acres ( 0 @.@ 012 km2 ) , or one percent of the historic total . In 1987 , just five bird species were confirmed in the watershed , while for fish , benthic invertebrates , and certain insects there were no confirmed observations , in part due to insufficient site coverage . Steelhead trout have recently been observed in the creek and its tributary , Trabuco Creek . A further reason for the decline of creek habitat and wildlife is mainly due to invasive plant and animal species , including giant reed ( Arundo donax ) and many sport fishes , such as bluegill and striped bass . However , a notable aspect of the creek water is while a sample taken at the creek mouth in January 1995 had a temperature of <unk> ( 56 @.@ 84 degrees Fahrenheit ) , many creeks along the Orange County coast have much higher temperatures .

 The USGS operated two stream gauges on San Juan Creek in the city of San Juan Capistrano , one from 1929 to 1969 and the second from 1970 to 1984 . For the former gauge , the highest recorded peak flow during that period was 22 @,@ 400 cubic feet per second ( 630 m3 / s ) per second on 25 February 1969 , with a gauge height of 5 @.@ 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 7 m ) . The second highest peak flow during that period was 13 @,@ 000 cubic feet per second ( 370 m3 / s ) on 2 March 1938 , presumably at the peak of the Los Angeles Flood of 1938 . For the more recent stream gauge , the highest recorded flow was 14 @,@ 700 cubic feet per second ( 420 m3 / s ) on 4 March 1978 , gauge height 17 feet ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) . The second highest flow was 11 @,@ 700 cubic feet per second ( 330 m3 / s ) on 20 February 1980 , gauge height 15 @.@ 43 feet ( 4 @.@ 70 m ) . The highest flow recorded on San Juan Creek of all time , however , was not by a USGS stream gauge ; the flow of 33 @,@ 650 cubic feet per second ( 953 m3 / s ) was recorded on 11 January 2005 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Indigenous peoples = = = 
 Before the 18th century , San Juan Creek and its tributary , Trabuco Creek , had indigenous names , but these are thus far unknown . The land in the San Juan watershed was mostly Acjachemen Indian territory , which extended from Aliso Creek in the north to San Mateo Creek in the south , a distance of roughly 35 miles ( 56 km ) north @-@ south . Most of the population centered on the outfalls of the two large perennial streams in the area , San Juan and San Mateo Creeks , as well as Trabuco Creek . 
 Such inhabitants , who numbered roughly two thousand overall , were hunter @-@ gatherers , living in small , semi @-@ permanent villages beside or near perennial streams . There were five villages on the main stem , three of which were below the Trabuco Creek confluence , and four more in other parts of the watershed , mostly on Trabuco and Oso Creeks . Their diet usually consisted of fruits , acorns , and grains , and sometimes meat , while they practiced little agriculture . Shell middens indicate that they also harvested shellfish from the coast . Although natural disasters such as floods , drought , and wildfires occurred during that time , as they do today , the Juañeno did not affect the environment of the area in either a negative or positive way . No permanent structures were built in the San Juan watershed until the arrival of the Spanish . 
 = = = Spanish arrival = = = 
 The first European land exploration of Alta California , the Spanish Portolà expedition , passed this way on its way north , camping at the creek on July 23 , 1769 . Franciscan missionary Juan Crespi noted in his diary , " ... we came to a very pleasant green valley , full of willows , alders , live oaks , and other trees not known to us . It has a large arroyo , which at the point where we crossed it carried a good stream of fresh and good water , which , after running a little way , formed in pools in some large patches of tules . " On the return journey to San Diego , the party used the campsite again , on January 20 . 
 In 1776 , Father Junípero Serra founded Mission San Juan Capistrano on a site that was most probably close to the creek , and as a result , the creek takes its name from the mission . The first site , however , was abandoned due to lack of water , although the creek was known in historical accounts to be perennial . The mission was moved to a second site , where it now stands . The Acjachemen were dubbed the " Juañeno " by the Spanish , after the mission . The Spanish were among the first to create hydrological changes in the San Juan watershed , which included excavating irrigation channels , diverting water from streams , and <unk> and changing course of streams . Grazing animals , including cows , sheep and other livestock , began their prevalence during this period , destroying many native grasses and leaving the ecosystem unbalanced and prone to erosion . 
 The origin of the name of Trabuco Creek ( Spanish : " <unk> Creek " , literally ) stems from the Gaspar de Portolà expedition of 1769 , during which a soldier lost a blunderbuss ( " <unk> " ) , and the name became associated with the creek after that point . The origin of the name of Oso Creek ( Spanish : " Bear Creek " ) is not known . Many of the creeks in the watershed have names of Spanish origin , which were most likely named by the Spanish conquistadors a long time before the area was annexed by the United States . 
 In 1812 , a heavy earthquake severely damaged many of the structures built by the Spanish . The Great Stone Church at Mission San Juan Capistrano , which had been built only six years before , collapsed ; over forty people were reported to have been killed . 
 Before urban development , the partially devastated lands caused by overgrazing during the Spanish period was still potentially capable of rebounding to their natural state . In 1964 , the urban percentage was 3 , while by 1988 , it had increased to 18 percent . In the 1990s , the watershed was 32 percent urban , and the projected growth by 2050 is 50 percent . Many areas in the watershed now have no chance to revert to their natural state as long as human habitation continues . 
 = = = 20th century to present = = = 
 In the late 1960s , the construction of Dana Point Harbor began very near the mouth of San Juan Creek . This harbor prevented the occurrence of a large surf break phenomenon , colloquially known as " Killer Dana " , in the bay . With the disappearance of Killer Dana , water circulation in the bay decreased . Resultantly , as pollution from San Juan Creek continued to flow freely into the bay , it stayed there for a longer period of time in comparison with that if the harbor had never been built . The pollution problems are ongoing , posing problems at Doheny Beach , where the 850 @,@ 000 annual visitors are threatened by the continuing pollution from San Juan Creek . 
 During floods in the 1990s , an almost sheer 30 @-@ foot ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) waterfall was rapidly scoured out of a steep earthen slope on Trabuco Creek , downstream of a railroad bridge and upstream of the Oso Creek confluence . This drop required quick reinforcement with grouted riprap , and still exists , with an average gradient of 29 percent before sheerly plunging into a murky stream pool . It still poses a major barrier to migrating fish and other riverine organisms , and thus isolates the lower few miles of Trabuco Creek from the relatively natural upper course . 
 In 1996 , severe floods caused by heavy rainstorms in the San Juan watershed caused both San Juan and Trabuco creeks to overflow , destroying long sections of concrete lining near their confluence . The damage was chiefly caused by severe basal erosion , which led to subsequent failure of the concrete walls and levees . Once the concrete was breached , the bare earth underlying it was exposed to erosion , threatening a nearby residential community , but the floods receded before any serious harm was done . The failed sections were repaired with grouted riprap , which can still be seen today . 
 In early 2005 , even more severe floods that also caused flooding along area streams such as San Diego Creek and Aliso Creek impacted the San Juan watershed , with an all @-@ time highest flow of 33 @,@ 650 cubic feet per second ( 953 m3 / s ) recorded on January 11 . Although the floods did not exceed the San Juan Creek channel capacity of 58 @,@ 800 cubic feet per second ( 1 @,@ 670 m3 / s ) , the west levee of the channel inside San Juan Capistrano nearly failed . Also in 2005 , pumps were installed on Tick and Dove Creeks ( tributaries of Bell Canyon , which flows into San Juan Creek ) to remove urban runoff stemming from a 1 @,@ 100 @-@ acre ( 4 @.@ 5 km2 ) residential community on a nearby ridge . The pumps remove excess flow and divert it to storage basins for later use as reclaimed irrigation water . 
 In May 2009 , it was announced that levee repairs along San Juan Creek would close a popular bikeway for up to two years , with repairs finished later in 2013 . This spurred protests from many area residents who are common users of the path . 
 = = River modifications = = 
 Although most streams in the San Juan watershed are less developed than those in the neighboring Aliso Creek and Salt Creek watersheds , San Juan , Oso and Trabuco Creeks have undergone an extensive series of modifications designed to control floods , reduce excessive erosion , and provide reclaimed water for irrigation . A growing amount of urban runoff flows into the creek and its tributaries , adding to the excessive perennial flow referred to often as a " nuisance flow " or " dry season nuisance flow " . Historically , only San Juan and Trabuco creeks were known to be perennial , while most of the tributaries , except for spring @-@ fed ones such as Holy Jim Creek , were ephemeral . Oso Creek was formerly ephemeral , but currently it can flow in excess of 100 cubic feet per second ( 2 @.@ 8 m3 / s ) in up to ten percent of a year . Finally , the long series of human @-@ made modifications to the creek have resulted in its mouth , Doheny State Beach , placing tenth in the most polluted beaches of California . 
 San Juan Creek is channelized for approximately 3 @.@ 5 miles ( 5 @.@ 6 km ) from immediately upstream of the Interstate 5 bridge to the mouth . Trabuco Creek is only channelized for several hundred yards above its confluence with the larger stream . In sharp contrast is Oso Creek , which is channelized along nearly its entire length , while Bell Canyon Creek is free @-@ flowing . Two large reservoirs , Upper Oso and Lake Mission Viejo , are built on Oso Creek , with a total storage capacity of roughly 7 @,@ 500 acre feet ( 0 @.@ <unk> km3 ) . While Lake Mission Viejo is primarily for recreation , the 115 @-@ acre ( 0 @.@ 47 km2 ) Upper Oso Reservoir collects Oso Creek water and diverts it for irrigation use , while any low @-@ flow spillage that occurs over its dam is collected at a small downstream dam that feeds a pipe that pumps it back to the reservoir ; in this way the Upper Oso Reservoir can be considered as a pumped @-@ storage operation , although it does not produce hydroelectricity . A notable aspect of the reservoir is that it was vital in providing water to extinguish a large wildfire in October 2002 . The dam is rockfill , 800 feet ( 240 m ) long and 142 feet ( 43 m ) high . 
 A few check dams exist on small upper tributaries of San Juan Creek , mostly inside the Cleveland National Forest , as well as a small , abandoned gabion structure lower on San Juan Creek . The structure , which was formerly a small dam , is now out of operation , but its roughly 3 @-@ to @-@ 4 @-@ foot ( 0 @.@ 91 to 1 @.@ 22 m ) drop still poses a problem for migrating steelhead trout . There are a few water diversion weirs that exist on San Juan tributary streams to divert water for irrigation , ranching and limited municipal uses , but due to limited flows and polluted water , the usefulness of these structures are limited . 
 A number of drop structures , which are small dams used to control water velocity , exist on streams in the San Juan watershed , primarily also on Trabuco and Oso creeks . On Trabuco Creek , there are eight drop structures , mostly built of riprap . The largest are a 30 @-@ foot ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) cascade immediately downstream of a Metrolink bridge and a concrete drop structure at the terminus of a culvert that crosses underneath Interstate 5 ; however , neither is inventoried by the Orange County Flood Control Division . There are also about seven drop structures on Oso Creek , most of which are also built of riprap . The mainstem San Juan Creek does not have any notable drop structures , dams or water diversions . 
 As with channelization , levees are only found in the lower San Juan watershed . San Juan Creek is bounded with levees from upstream of Interstate 5 to very near its mouth at Doheny Beach , while Trabuco Creek has levees from upstream of Del Obispo Street ( a continuation of the Ortega Highway ) downstream to its mouth at San Juan Creek . Oso Creek has some raised banks , but it is not certain if those are levees . Smaller tributaries , such as El Horno Creek and Bell Canyon , do not have levees . Although the San Juan and Trabuco Creek levees are said to have a " fairly high level of protection currently " , failure scenarios of levees in the San Juan watershed have been extensively studied , and they have been determined to possibly fail for a variety of reasons , some of which have already been demonstrated in the floods of 1996 and 2005 . In response to the danger of another flood , work has begun on a new west @-@ bank levee replacement that will finish in 2013 .

 = Murray Maxwell = 
 Captain Sir Murray Maxwell , CB , FRS ( 10 September 1775 – 26 June 1831 ) was a British Royal Navy officer who served with distinction in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries , particularly during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars . Maxwell first gained recognition as one of the British captains involved in the successful Adriatic campaign of 1807 – 1814 , during which he was responsible for the destruction of a French armaments convoy at the Action of 29 November 1811 . As a result of further success in the Mediterranean , Maxwell was given increasingly important commissions and , despite the loss of his ship HMS Daedalus off Ceylon in 1813 , was appointed to escort the British Ambassador to China in 1816 . 
 The voyage to China subsequently became famous when Maxwell 's ship HMS Alceste was wrecked in the Gaspar Strait , and he and his crew became stranded on a nearby island . The shipwrecked sailors ran short of food and were repeatedly attacked by Malay pirates , but thanks to Maxwell 's leadership no lives were lost . Eventually rescued by a British East India Company ship , the party returned to Britain as popular heroes , Maxwell being especially commended . He was knighted for his services , and made a brief and unsuccessful foray into politics before resuming his naval career . In 1831 Maxwell was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island , but fell ill and died before he could take up the post . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Murray Maxwell was born in 1775 to James and Elizabeth Maxwell ; his father was a British Army officer with the 42nd Regiment of Foot ( known as the " Black Watch " ) and the son of Sir Alexander Maxwell , second of the Maxwell Baronets of <unk> . The family lived in <unk> in Wigtownshire , Scotland , and Murray was intended for the armed forces from an early age : six of Murray 's eight brothers would also join the Army or Navy . In 1790 , at the age of 14 , he was sent to sea on board HMS Juno , then commanded by Samuel Hood . He had been in Juno for three years when the French Revolutionary Wars broke out , and was on board when the frigate was forced to make a desperate escape from Toulon harbour under heavy fire from French Republican batteries during the siege of the city . Later that year , he was engaged in the invasion of Corsica and the siege of Bastia , during which he made such a favourable impression that when Hood transferred to HMS Aigle in 1794 , he requested that Maxwell accompany him . Maxwell was transferred again during 1794 , this time to the small frigate HMS Nemesis under the command of Hood 's relative Captain Samuel Hood Linzee . 
 In December 1795 Maxwell was taken prisoner when Nemesis was captured by a superior French force in Smyrna harbour . Despite Smyrna 's neutrality , the large French frigate Sensible and the smaller corvette Sardine entered the port , followed later by the corvette Rossignol , and called on Nemesis to surrender . Linzee protested at the illegal nature of the French demands , but decided it would be futile to engage the significantly stronger force inside a neutral harbour , and complied with the French order . Maxwell was rapidly exchanged , and returned to service aboard HMS Hussar under Captain James Colnett . However , on 27 December 1796 , Hussar was wrecked off Southern France , and Maxwell once again became a prisoner of war . <unk> a second time , he joined HMS Blenheim , and later moved to HMS Princess Royal , before being made lieutenant in October 1796 . Following his promotion , Maxwell was not employed at sea again until 1802 . In 1798 he married the daughter of an army officer , Grace Callander Waugh . 
 = = Napoleonic Wars = = 
 At the conclusion of the Peace of Amiens and the start of the Napoleonic Wars , Maxwell returned to sea @-@ service in command of the sloop @-@ of @-@ war HMS Cyane . Within days of the start of the war , Cyane captured two French transports destined for the Caribbean , and later served in the West Indies , on one occasion exchanging fire with two large French frigates off Martinique . In 1803 , Maxwell was involved in the capture of St Lucia , for which he was made captain of the ship of the line HMS Centaur — the flagship of his former commander Sir Samuel Hood . In this ship Maxwell participated in the capture of the French and Dutch colonies of Tobago , <unk> and Essequibo in 1803 , following which his promotion to post captain was confirmed . He also blockaded Martinique , and was subsequently involved in the operation to seize Diamond Rock , overseeing the construction of a gun battery on its summit . This fortified position was able to severely restrict French shipping entering or leaving Fort @-@ de @-@ France . Present at the capture of Surinam and Berbice in 1804 , Maxwell was the senior naval officer at the surrender of Surinam by its Dutch governor . His actions at Surinam : commanding the naval forces in the siege and capturing a succession of Dutch forts along the Suriname River , were highly commended . Maxwell 's decisive leadership was essential in the rapid movement of troops by water to prevent the Dutch preparing fresh defensive positions ; the colony surrendered after the British reached Paramaribo , giving up 2 @,@ 000 prisoners , several ships , large quantities of supplies and the colony itself , with its valuable plantations . British losses numbered less than 30 . 
 = = = Mediterranean service = = = 
 In 1805 Maxwell took command of the frigate HMS Galatea off Jamaica , participating in the Atlantic campaign of 1806 as part of the squadron under Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane that drove off a French attack on the Jamaica convoy near Tortola on 4 July 1806 . In 1807 , Maxwell was transferred to the Mediterranean in HMS Alceste . He was initially part of a raiding squadron that attacked coastal batteries and positions along the Spanish coast in support of the Peninsular War . In April 1808 , shortly before Spain became an ally of Britain , he successfully destroyed a Spanish convoy carrying military stores off Rota . Over the next two years Maxwell became an expert at raiding the French , Italian and Spanish coasts , destroying numerous Italian Martello Towers and small armed vessels . In May 1810 he was commended for a raid at Frejus , where he led a landing party that stormed and destroyed a coastal fort and seized a coastal convoy . 
 = = = Adriatic campaign = = = 
 Maxwell 's most notable service came during the Adriatic campaign of 1807 – 1814 . Alceste was despatched to the Adriatic Sea to support James Brisbane in the absence of William Hoste , who had been wounded at the Battle of Lissa in March 1811 . On 4 May , Maxwell and Brisbane led an attack on Parenza , where a brig carrying supplies to Ragusa had taken shelter . Seizing an island at the mouth of the harbour , the British established a mortar position overlooking the anchorage , and sank the brig with a heavy bombardment . In November 1811 , with the temporary absence of Brisbane , Maxwell became the senior officer in the Adriatic . Seven months later , a convoy of French frigates carrying cannon from Corfu to Trieste was spotted attempting to slip past his base of operations on the island of Lissa . Ashore in Port St. George , Maxwell was informed by telegraph , and led Alceste and the rest of his squadron — HMS Active and HMS Unite — in pursuit . 
 On 29 November , after a night 's chase , the British caught their opponents near Pelagosa . The French force consisted of the large frigates Pauline and Pomone , and the armed storeship Persanne . In the battle that followed , Unite pursued and , after a lengthy chase , seized the smaller Persanne , while Maxwell and James Alexander Gordon in Active engaged the frigates . The action was bitterly contested , the British taking 61 casualties , including Gordon who lost a leg . However , Alceste and Active successfully isolated Pomone , and when another British ship , HMS Kingfisher , appeared in the distance , Pauline fled . Alone and having lost heavily , Pomone surrendered . The prizes were later sold along with their cargo of 200 cannon . Maxwell , despite attributing most of the credit for the victory to the wounded Gordon , was rewarded in 1812 with command of HMS Daedalus , a former Italian frigate captured at the Battle of Lissa . 
 = = = HMS Daedalus = = = 
 Maxwell commanded Daedalus for less than a year . On 2 July 1813 the frigate ran aground on a shoal off Galle , Ceylon , causing serious damage to her keel . Although she was soon brought off , the leaks created in the grounding became so severe that Maxwell had no option but to order his crew to cease their desperate attempts to keep her afloat and abandon ship . He was the last to leave and shortly after he had been transported to a nearby East Indiaman , Daedalus rolled over and sank . Maxwell returned to Britain to face a court martial but was exonerated for the frigate 's loss and reappointed to Alceste . In 1815 he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath for his naval service , and although the war against France had ended , was retained for active duty at the special request of Lord Amherst . 
 = = Voyage to China and shipwreck = = 
 In 1816 Maxwell was ordered to escort Lord Amherst on a diplomatic mission to the <unk> Emperor of China . Alceste was accompanied by the small sloop HMS Lyra , under Captain Basil Hall , and the East Indiaman General Hewitt , which carried gifts for the Emperor . The small convoy called at Madeira , Rio de Janeiro , Cape Town , <unk> and Batavia , and arrived at Peiho after nearly six months at sea in July . Amherst went ashore with his party , instructing Maxwell to meet him at Canton once his diplomatic mission was complete . The mission was expected to last several months , so Maxwell and Hall agreed to use the time to become the first British sailors to explore the Yellow Sea and beyond . Between them , Lyra and Alceste visited the Gulf of <unk> , the West coast of Korea and the " Loo @-@ Choo " ( Ryukyu ) Islands — in some cases as the first European ships known to have sailed these waters . During the journey , Maxwell saw the Great Wall of China and discovered serious inaccuracies in the charts of Western Korea , finding it lay 130 miles east of its supposed position . The expedition also made the first known British government contacts with both the Koreans and the Ryukyu Islanders , who ignored instructions from Chinese officials not to communicate with the British ships . 
 Maxwell arrived off the Pearl River in November 1816 and prepared to sail to Whampoa for his reunion with Amherst . Amherst 's mission had foundered on the British party 's refusal to kowtow to the <unk> Emperor and offer him tribute as overlord , and Amherst and his retinue had to retire to Whampoa with their mission incomplete . At the mouth of the Pearl , Alceste was refused permission to enter the river and perfunctorily ordered to halt by a local mandarin , who threatened to sink the frigate if it tried to force passage . Responding angrily that he would pass the river with or without the mandarin 's permission , Maxwell attacked the Chinese defences , breaking through a blockade of junks and firing on the forts guarding the river mouth , scattering their defenders . He sailed on to Whampoa without further impediment , without casualties ; Chinese losses were reportedly 47 killed and many wounded . Maxwell himself had fired the first cannon as a statement that he took personal responsibility for the exchange of fire — reportedly , the first cannonball was ironically marked " Tribute from the King of England to the Chinese " . Collecting Amherst and his party from Whampoa , Maxwell sailed back down the Pearl River and , in January 1817 , began the return journey to Britain , visiting Macao and Manila . 
 On 18 February 1817 Alceste entered the Gaspar Strait between Bangka and Liat , traversing largely uncharted waters . Some hours later the frigate struck a hidden reef and grounded , sustaining severe damage to her hull . Despite Maxwell 's best efforts to free his ship the carpenter reported that Alceste was taking on water and would rapidly sink if refloated . Ordering the ship to be abandoned , Maxwell gave the ship 's barge to the ambassador and supervised the construction of a raft which , with the remaining boats , safely convoyed the crew , passengers and a quantity of supplies to a nearby island , formed largely of impenetrable mangrove swamps . The last to leave Alceste , Maxwell arrived on shore on the morning of 19 February . A council of officers subsequently decided that Amherst would take the ship 's boats and 50 men and attempt to reach Batavia , four days sail away . It was essential that Amherst reach Batavia quickly , as the supplies salvaged from the wreck , especially of drinkable water , would only last a few days shared among all 250 survivors . 
 = = = Attack by Dayaks = = = 
 To keep up morale following Amherst 's departure , Maxwell began organising his remaining 200 men ( and one woman ) to secure their position and gather supplies . The men were divided into parties , with one ordered to dig a well while another returned to the wreck of Alceste to salvage what weapons and equipment they could . A third party was ordered to clear a path to the island 's central hill , where a cool cave could be used as a larder and trees felled to form a protective stockade . By the end of the first day the well was producing a steady supply of water . 
 The party aboard Alceste , having determined that the ship was in no immediate danger of sinking , decided to remain aboard overnight . However , at dawn they awoke to discover the ship surrounded by Dayak ( or Malay ) proas armed with swivel guns . The party escaped on the raft , only reaching the island ahead of the pursuing proas with the assistance of boats sent to meet them carrying armed Royal Marines . With the wreck vacated , the Dayaks began enthusiastically looting it and several proas approached the island , landing their crews on offshore rocks to both observe the British and store their salvage . Maxwell hastily organised defensive positions in case the Dayaks attacked the island , completing the stockade on the island 's hill and preparing sharpened stakes and hundreds of improvised cartridges for the group 's 30 muskets . Over the next few days the proas approached the island several times , but despite attempts by the British to communicate with them , never landed . Eventually , on 22 February , Maxwell took advantage of the divided Dayak positions to drive their observers off the rocks , with the intention of recapturing the wreck . This was initially successful , but the departing Dayaks set fire to Alceste , burning her to the waterline . The destruction of the frigate 's upper works exposed her hold , and the next morning the stranded sailors were able to collect some supplies that had floated out . 
 During the early morning of 26 February , British sentries spotted two proas attempting to land at the cove where the remaining British boats were anchored . Taking one of the boats to intercept the proas , Lieutenant Hay boarded a Dayak canoe and captured it , despite fire from the Dayak guns . Four Dayaks were killed , two captured , and five jumped into the sea and drowned themselves , having scuttled their <unk> . Later in the day fourteen more proas appeared , led by a large vessel carrying a rajah . These approached the island and several Malays came ashore , a number of British sailors being admitted on board the rajah 's canoe in return . The inability of either side to speak the others language hindered negotiations , and the Malays retreated to their boats late in the day . The rajah subsequently directed renewed salvage operations on the wreck , seeking especially the copper nails that had held the ship 's beams together . By 2 March there were nearly 30 proas off the island , 20 of which were detached to open an ineffective long @-@ range fire on the British positions ashore , accompanied by frenzied drumming and the bashing of gongs . Although further attempts were made to communicate with the proas , and messages successfully passed to them in the hope someone in authority would transmit them to nearby settlements , the British crew expected an attack at any moment . In preparation , Maxwell gathered his men together and spoke to them : 
 My lads , you must all have observed the great increase in the enemy 's force , and the threatening posture they have assumed . I have reason to believe they will attack us this night . I do not wish to conceal our real state , because I do not believe there is a man here who is afraid to face any sort of danger . We are in a position to defend ourselves against regular troops , far less a set of naked savages , with their spears and <unk> . It is true they have swivels in their boats , but they cannot act here . I have not observed that they have any muskets , but if they have , so have we . When we were first thrown on shore we could only muster seventy @-@ five musket ball cartridges — we now have sixteen hundred . They cannot send up , I believe , more than five hundred men ; but with two hundred such as now stand around me , I do not fear a thousand — nor fifteen hundred of them . The pikemen standing firm , we will give them such a volley of musketry as they will be little prepared for ; and when they are thrown into confusion , we will sally out , chase them into the water , and ten to one but we secure their <unk> let every man be on the alert , and should these barbarians this night attempt our hill , I trust we shall convince them they are dealing with Britons . 
 So loud was the cheering that followed this address that the proas fell silent , the Dayaks apparently unnerved . In the morning however the 20 canoes were still offshore and , with the anticipated rescue overdue and supplies running low , a desperate plan was made to use the ship 's boats to board and capture enough Dayak vessels to enable the entire crew to reach Batavia . However , while these plans were being formed the British East India Company 's ( EIC ) armed brig Ternate appeared on the southern horizon . 
 = = = Napoleon = = = 
 Determined to make one last show of defiance , Maxwell ordered the marines to wade towards the proas at low tide and open fire on them . This achieved no hits , but did persuade the Dayaks to move further offshore , and they departed entirely when the Ternate was spotted . The following day the survivors embarked on board Ternate , Maxwell having lost not one man on either the shipwreck or the island . At Batavia the crew were reunited with Amherst and his party , who had sent Ternate to search for them and subsequently chartered the East Indiaman Caesar for the remainder of the journey to Britain . 
 The voyage to Europe remained eventful . In the Indian Ocean Caesar caught fire and was almost destroyed , and after stopping at Cape Town , the Indiaman visited St Helena , where Amherst , Maxwell and the other officers were introduced to the former French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte , then a prisoner on the island . At the meeting Bonaparte recalled Maxwell 's conduct in the action of November 1811 and commended him on his victory , saying " Vous <unk> très <unk> . Eh bien ! Your government must not blame you for the loss of the Alceste , for you have taken one of my frigates " . 
 = = Later service = = 
 Returning to Britain in August 1817 , where the story of his shipwreck and subsequent difficulties had become headline news , Maxwell was widely praised for his leadership . In the court martial convened to investigate the incident he was exonerated of all blame , and especially commended for his calm and authoritative control of the situation . Chief among the witnesses on his behalf was Lord Amherst himself . The court martial reported that " his coolness , self @-@ <unk> and exertions were highly conspicuous , and everything was done by him and his officers within the power of man to execute " . The following year he was knighted , and in 1819 made a Fellow of the Royal Society . That same year the HEIC presented him with £ 1 @,@ 500 as a reward for his services in China and to compensate him for his financial losses in the wreck . An account of the Yellow Sea voyage by Basil Hall was published in 1818 under the title " Account of a Voyage of Discovery to the West Coast of Corea and the Great Loo @-@ Choo Islands " . The book was dedicated to Sir Murray Maxwell , and proved popular . 
 Maxwell stood in the 1818 general election , seeking to become Member of Parliament for Westminster . He was narrowly defeated by less than 400 votes , losing to Sir Samuel Romilly and Sir Francis Burdett . The campaign ruined him financially , and after a " severe personal injury " in Covent Garden when he was struck in the back by a paving stone thrown from a mob opposed to his candidacy , he was left with disgust for the political process . Maxwell 's lungs were badly damaged ; he never fully recovered from the injury , and never again became involved in politics , instead returning to the Navy in 1821 as captain of HMS Bulwark , the flagship of Admiral Sir Benjamin Hallowell at Chatham . The same year , the Arctic explorer Henry <unk> Hoppner , who had served under Maxwell aboard the Alceste on the mission to China , named Murray Maxwell Bay on Baffin Island after his former captain . 
 By 1823 Maxwell was in command of HMS Gloucester organising operations against smugglers , and later in the year he was given a foreign posting in command of HMS Briton off South America . Here he observed the Peruvian War of Independence and was present at the surrender of Callao , forming a friendship with the defeated General <unk> . This posting proved a frustrating experience for Maxwell , who broke his kneecap on the outward journey and never fully recovered use of the limb . He also failed to gain any of the financial rewards that overseas postings could bring , and was unable to restore his shattered finances , returning a poorer man than when he had left . 
 Still feeling the chest injury sustained during the 1818 election , Maxwell returned to Britain in 1826 and entered retirement ; during this period he also reportedly had a bout of depression , especially following the sudden death of his youngest daughter in 1827 . In 1830 , he was recalled by the newly crowned King William IV . A former naval officer himself , King William selected a number of senior Navy officers to be his aides de camp , including Maxwell , who was subsequently appointed to succeed John Ready as Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island on 14 March 1831 . As Maxwell sailed from his home in Scotland to London to make preparations for his departure , he was suddenly taken ill . Medical assistance was unavailable for 48 hours during the passage , and the weather too rough for him to go ashore in an open boat in his condition . As a result , Maxwell died shortly after arriving at Green 's Hotel in Lincoln 's Inn Fields , London ; Colonel Aretas William Young took his place as governor . Maxwell was buried at St Marylebone Parish Church , and was survived by his wife and their son John Balfour Maxwell , who died in 1874 as an admiral of the Royal Navy .

 = Ryan FR Fireball = 
 The Ryan FR Fireball was a mixed @-@ power ( piston and jet @-@ powered ) fighter aircraft designed by Ryan Aeronautical for the United States Navy during World War II . It was the Navy 's first aircraft with a jet engine . Only 66 aircraft were built before Japan surrendered in August 1945 . The FR @-@ 1 Fireball equipped a single squadron before the end of the war , but did not see combat . The aircraft ultimately proved to lack the structural strength required for operations aboard aircraft carriers and was withdrawn in mid @-@ 1947 . 
 = = Design and development = = 
 Design of the FR @-@ 1 began in 1943 to a proposal instigated by Admiral John S. McCain , Sr. for a mixed @-@ powered fighter because early jet engines had sluggish acceleration that was considered unsafe and unsuitable for carrier operations . Ryan received a contract for three XFR @-@ 1 prototypes and one static test airframe on 11 February 1943 with the first two prototypes delivered in 14 months . Another contract was placed for 100 aircraft on 2 December 1943 and a later contract on 31 January 1945 increased the total of FR @-@ 1s on order to 700 . 
 The XFR @-@ 1 was a single @-@ seat , low @-@ wing monoplane with tricycle landing gear . A 1 @,@ 350 @-@ horsepower ( 1 @,@ 010 kW ) Wright R @-@ 1820 @-@ <unk> Cyclone radial engine was mounted in the fighter 's nose while a 1 @,@ 600 lbf ( 7 @,@ 100 N ) General Electric I @-@ 16 ( later redesignated as the J @-@ 31 ) turbojet was mounted in the rear fuselage . It was fed by ducts in each wing root which meant that the wing had to be relatively thick to house the ducts and the outward @-@ retracting main landing gear . To simplify the fuel system , both engines used the same grade of avgas . Two self @-@ sealing fuel tanks were housed in the fuselage , one of 130 US gallons ( 490 l ; 110 imp gal ) and the other of 50 US gallons ( 190 l ; 42 imp gal ) . The cockpit was positioned just forward of the leading edge of the wing and the pilot was provided with a bubble canopy which gave him excellent visibility . The XFR @-@ 1 had the first laminar flow airfoil in a navy carrier aircraft . 
 The Fireball was armed with four .50 in ( 12 @.@ 7 mm ) M2 Browning machine guns with 300 rounds per gun . They were mounted in the center section of the wing , immediately outboard of the air intakes for the jet engine . Four 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) rockets could be carried under each outer wing panel and two hardpoints were provided under the center section for 1 @,@ 000 lb ( 454 kg ) bombs or 100 US gal ( 380 l ; 83 imp gal ) drop tanks . Armor plates were provided in front and behind the pilot 's seat and for the oil cooler . 
 The first XFR @-@ 1 made its first flight on 25 June 1944 without its jet engine , but that was installed shortly afterward . The second prototype first flew on 20 September 1944 . Test flights confirmed wind tunnel tests that revealed a lack of longitudinal stability because the center of gravity had been miscalculated . In addition , the circular rear fuselage of the FR @-@ 1 gave less stability than the slab @-@ style fuselage of the Grumman F4F Wildcat that was used as a model for the stability calculations . A new tail with enlarged vertical and horizontal stabilizers was designed and retrofitted to the prototypes . The original Douglas double @-@ slotted flaps proved to be unsatisfactory during flight testing , but all three prototypes and the first 14 production aircraft were built with them before they were replaced with a single @-@ slotted flap . 
 The first prototype was lost in a crash at NAS China Lake on 13 October 1944 . Investigation showed that the wing structure was not strong enough to resist compressibility effects . This was cured by doubling the number of rivets in the outer wing panels . The second prototype crashed on 25 March 1945 when the pilot failed to recover from a dive from 35 @,@ 000 feet ( 10 @,@ 670 m ) , probably also due to compressibility effects . The third prototype crashed on 5 April when the canopy blew off during a high @-@ speed pass over Lindbergh Field . 
 Operational testing by the Naval Air Test Center at Naval Air Station Patuxent River that included carrier acceptability tests revealed additional problems . The piston engine tended to overheat until electrically operated cowl flaps were installed , the catapult hooks had to be moved and the nosewheel oleo shock strut had to be lengthened by 3 inches ( 76 mm ) . Carrier suitability tests began aboard the escort carrier Charger in early January 1945 . The aircraft successfully made five catapult takeoffs using the piston engine as well as three takeoffs using both engines . No problems were reported when landing aboard the carrier . 
 The FR @-@ 1 Fireball was further developed into the XFR @-@ 2 which utilized a 1 @,@ 425 hp ( 1 @,@ 063 kW ) Wright R @-@ 1820 @-@ <unk> in place of the <unk> . One single airframe was converted to this configuration . No prototypes were built for the next proposed variant , the FR @-@ 3 , which would have used a General Electric I @-@ 20 turbojet . Both of these projects were canceled with the end of the war . The fastest Fireball was the XFR @-@ 4 , which had a Westinghouse J34 turbojet and was approximately 100 mph ( 161 km / h ) faster than the FR @-@ 1 . The turbojet 's air intakes were moved from the wing roots to the fuselage in front of the wing ; they were covered by electrically powered doors to lessen drag when the aircraft was flying only on its piston engine . The Fireball 's fuselage was lengthened by 8 inches ( 203 mm ) to accommodate the larger engine and the leading edge extension of the wing root that housed the air intakes was also removed . The XFR @-@ 4 was intended to serve as a testbed for the turbojet installation on the XF2R @-@ 1 Dark Shark . This was the final variant ; the piston engine was replaced with a General Electric <unk> @-@ GE @-@ 2 turboprop , but only one prototype was built .
