 The remnants of Cyclone Sose were a significant factor in stormy weather over the North Island of New Zealand between April 12 and April 14 . Numerous locations received 10 to 20 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 to 7 @.@ 9 in ) of rainfall , and 23 @.@ 0 cm ( 9 @.@ 1 in ) of precipitation fell at Glenbervie , Northland region , in just seven hours . The heavy rainfall rates caused " significant " flooding of low @-@ lying roads and farmlands in the region . Floodwaters inundated the township of <unk> and entered several local businesses . The swollen <unk> River temporarily rendered New Zealand State Highway 10 impassable to most vehicles at a bridge over the waterway . A hospital became isolated from the rest of the town . Further to the west , State Highway 1 was blocked by flooding at <unk> , as was State Highway 2 between Te Puke and Te <unk> Junction . At the former , the rains triggered a landslide and polluted the local supply of drinking water . Several residences throughout the region sustained damage . A 22 @-@ year @-@ old man drowned in high waters along the Wairoa River . Rising waters from the <unk> River threatened to affect the Mission House , the nation 's oldest surviving building , where staff were on standby to relocate furnishings if necessary . 
 A severe traffic accident occurred on State Highway 28 at <unk> , Waikato , on the morning of April 13 . The head @-@ on collision was attributed to slick roads resulting from the storm . Three individuals were killed and two more were hospitalized . Several other accidents were reported around the same time . In addition to the rainfall , strong winds brought down trees and utility poles across the island and as far south as Marlborough on the South Island . There , the strong winds fanned a large fire ignited by sparks from downed power lines . The fire covered more than 70 hectares ( 175 acres ) of land and prompted several families to evacuate their homes . Three people were injured at <unk> after a temporary tent collapsed at a local festival . Along the coast , swells triggered by Sose reached 3 @.@ 5 m ( 11 ft ) in height . 
 The tight pressure gradient between Cyclone Sose and the ridge to its south generated extremely rough seas along the eastern coast of Australia , especially Queensland . Along the state 's southern shore , normally protected from strong swells , waves were as high as 8 m ( 26 ft ) and frequently between 4 – 5 m ( 13 – 16 ft ) . A 53 @-@ year @-@ old man and his 9 @-@ year @-@ old son both drowned in the heavy surf near Gladstone on April 8 . Offshore <unk> , New South Wales , a yacht capsized , forcing its two occupants to swim to land . The large swells proved popular with experienced surfers looking for a challenge . Although the event became infamous within local surfing circles , at least one surfer was hospitalized after being swept against rocks , and several others required rescue . Some beach erosion was reported in several locations , leading to minor sandbagging efforts to hamper the erosion .

 A large wave breaking on the cliffs of <unk> Island in New Caledonia swept away a spectator , who was presumed dead after the rough conditions delayed searching efforts . The storm disrupted classes and school activities in parts of the archipelago , but little to no damage was reported . 
 The distant cyclone sent large swells toward Tonga and Samoa , coinciding with high astronomical tides . Coastal flooding on low @-@ lying islands of Tonga reportedly destroyed houses and crops . 
 = New York State Route 410 = 
 New York State Route 410 ( NY 410 ) is a 4 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) east – west state highway in Lewis County , New York , in the United States . It serves as a connector between NY 26 , NY 126 , and the village of Castorland midway between the two highways . The route begins at an intersection with NY 26 in the town of Denmark and heads northeast through Castorland and across the Black River to a junction with NY 126 in the town of Croghan . Most of the route passes through open , rural areas , save for the section within Castorland . NY 410 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York even though the road had yet to be improved to state highway standards . Work on rebuilding the road was delayed by the state for years , leading the Kiwanis Club of Lowville to pressure the state to reconstruct the highway . The route was finally brought up to state highway standards in the latter part of the 1930s . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 410 begins at a rural intersection with NY 26 in the town of Denmark . The two @-@ lane route heads eastward from the junction , winding to the north and south across open , rolling terrain with several cultivated fields . After 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) , the highway meets County Route 19 ( CR 19 , named East Road ) and turns to the northeast toward the village of Castorland . The open fields gradually give way to homes as NY 410 enters the village limits as Main Street . The route passes through the center of the village , serving four lightly developed residential blocks before crossing the Mohawk , Adirondack and Northern Railroad at the northeastern edge of the community . At the rail crossing , the highway passes south of what was once the New York Central Railroad 's Castorland passenger station . 
 Outside of Castorland , the road runs across a half @-@ mile ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) stretch of undeveloped land prior to crossing the Black River , which serves as the boundary between the towns of Denmark and Croghan . On the opposite riverbank , NY 410 continues across another open stretch to reach the small hamlet of Naumburg . Here , the route passes a handful of homes and intersects the north end of CR 33 ( Van Amber Road ) before ending at an intersection with NY 126 on the northeastern fringe of the hamlet . While NY 410 terminates at this junction , its right @-@ of @-@ way continues past NY 126 as Cross Road , a local highway connecting Naumburg to CR 8 ( Second Road ) . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1925 , the state of New York approved plans to establish a state highway between Kitts Corners — a point just south of the modern junction of NY 26 and NY 410 — and Naumburg . The existing road between the two points via Castorland was designated as NY 410 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York ; however , it remained an unimproved , locally maintained highway through the mid @-@ 1930s . In early 1934 , the Kiwanis Club of nearby Lowville began to petition the state to follow through on its plans to rebuild the road as the organization considered the proposed Kitts Corners – Naumburg state highway to be " of the greatest importance to the business interests of the villages of Beaver Falls , Castorland , and Lowville " . 
 The Lowville Kiwanis Club took action again in early 1935 , sending a representative to a hearing in Lake Placid to meet with State Senator George R. Fearon , the chairman of a committee tasked with developing a long @-@ term plan for state highway construction in New York . At the meeting , Kiwanis member Arthur W. Mattson noted that the village of Castorland had paved every street in the village limits save for Main Street , which was left as a dirt road due to the state 's long @-@ standing intention to take it over and rebuild it . In October 1935 , the state unveiled plans to reconstruct the portion of NY 410 leading west from the center of Castorland as a concrete road . The survey and design work for the segment was already complete , which would allow construction to begin in 1936 if funding was made available by that time . 
 Work on the project was finally underway by July 1936 . While most of the existing road west of Castorland was improved in place , the westernmost part ( now known as <unk> Road ) was bypassed in favor of a new alignment to the north . The change in NY 410 's course took the highway around a steep grade that existed along the original route at Kitts Corners . The scope of the project ended at the New York Central Railroad tracks in Castorland as the part of NY 410 leading to Naumburg had been contracted out as part of a different project , which had already been completed by this time . The reconstruction of the rest of NY 410 was finished in the late 1930s . The original bridge carrying NY 410 over the Black River was replaced with a 640 @-@ foot ( 195 m ) structure in 1955 . It was reconstructed nine years later .

 C @-@ SPAN ( / <unk> / ) , an acronym for Cable @-@ Satellite Public Affairs Network , is an American cable and satellite television network that was created in 1979 by the cable television industry as a public service . C @-@ SPAN televises many proceedings of the United States federal government , as well as other public affairs programming . The C @-@ SPAN network includes three television channels ( C @-@ SPAN , C @-@ SPAN2 and C @-@ SPAN3 ) , one radio station ( WCSP @-@ FM ) and a group of websites that provide streaming media and archives of C @-@ SPAN programs . C @-@ SPAN 's television channels are available to approximately 100 million cable and satellite households within the United States , while WCSP @-@ FM , also called C @-@ SPAN Radio , is broadcast on FM radio in Washington , D.C. , and is available throughout the U.S. on XM Satellite Radio , via Internet streaming , and through apps for iOS , BlackBerry and Android devices . 
 The network televises U.S. political events , particularly live and " gavel @-@ to @-@ gavel " coverage of the U.S. Congress as well as occasional proceedings of the Canadian , Australian and British Parliaments and major events worldwide . Its coverage of political and policy events is unedited , thereby providing viewers ( or listeners ) with unfiltered information about politics and government . Non @-@ political coverage includes historical programming , programs dedicated to non @-@ fiction books , and interview programs with noteworthy individuals associated with public policy . C @-@ SPAN is a private , nonprofit organization , funded by a 6 ¢ per subscriber affiliate fee paid by its cable and satellite affiliates , and does not have advertisements on any of its networks , radio stations , or websites , nor does it ever solicit donations or pledges . The network operates independently , and neither the cable industry nor Congress has control of the content of its programming .

 Brian Lamb , C @-@ SPAN 's chairman and former chief executive officer , first conceived the concept of C @-@ SPAN in 1975 while working as the Washington , D.C. bureau chief of the cable industry trade magazine Cablevision . It was a time of rapid growth in the number of cable television channels available in the United States , and Lamb envisioned a cable @-@ industry financed nonprofit network for televising sessions of the U.S. Congress and other public affairs event and policy discussions . Lamb shared his idea with several cable executives , who helped him launch the network . Among them were Bob <unk> who provided $ 25 @,@ 000 of initial funding in 1979 and John D. Evans who provided the wiring and access to the <unk> needed for the distribution of the C @-@ SPAN signal . 
 C @-@ SPAN was launched on March 19 , 1979 , in time for the first televised session made available by the House of Representatives , beginning with a speech by then @-@ Tennessee representative Al Gore . Upon its debut , only 3 @.@ 5 million homes were wired for C @-@ SPAN , and the network had just three employees . The second C @-@ SPAN channel , C @-@ SPAN2 , followed on June 2 , 1986 when the U.S. Senate permitted itself to be televised . C @-@ SPAN3 , the most recent expansion channel , began full @-@ time operations on January 22 , 2001 , and shows other public policy and government @-@ related live events on weekdays along with weekend historical programming . C @-@ SPAN3 is the successor of a digital channel called C @-@ SPAN Extra , which was launched in the Washington D.C. area in 1997 , and televised live and recorded political events from 9 : 00 a.m. to 6 : 00 p.m. Eastern Time Monday through Friday . 
 C @-@ SPAN Radio began operations on October 9 , 1997 , covering similar events as the television networks and often simulcasting their programming . The station broadcasts on WCSP ( 90 @.@ 1 FM ) in Washington , D.C. , is also available on XM Satellite Radio channel 120 and is streamed live at c @-@ <unk> It was formerly available on Sirius Satellite Radio from 2002 to 2006 . 
 Lamb semi @-@ retired in March 2012 , coinciding with the channel 's 33rd anniversary , and gave executive control of the network to his two lieutenants , Rob Kennedy and Susan Swain . 
 = = = Anniversaries = = = 
 C @-@ SPAN celebrated its 10th anniversary in 1989 with a three @-@ hour retrospective , featuring Lamb recalling the development of the network . The 15th anniversary was commemorated in an unconventional manner as the network facilitated a series of re @-@ enactments of the seven historic Lincoln @-@ Douglas debates of 1858 , which were televised from August to October 1994 , and have been rebroadcast from time to time ever since . Five years later , the series American Presidents : Life Portraits , which won a Peabody Award , served as a year @-@ long observation of C @-@ SPAN 's 20th anniversary . 
 In 2004 , C @-@ SPAN celebrated its 25th anniversary , by which time the flagship network was viewed in 86 million homes , C @-@ SPAN2 was in 70 million homes and C @-@ SPAN3 was in eight million homes . On the anniversary date , C @-@ SPAN repeated the first televised hour of floor debate in the House of Representatives from 1979 and , throughout the month , 25th anniversary features included " then and now " segments with journalists who had appeared on C @-@ SPAN during its early years . Also included in the 25th anniversary was an essay contest for viewers to write in about how C @-@ SPAN has influenced their life regarding community service . For example , one essay contest winner wrote about how C @-@ SPAN 's non @-@ fiction book programming serves as a resource in his charitable mission to record non @-@ fiction audio books for people who are blind . 
 To commemorate 25 years of taking viewer telephone calls , in 2005 , C @-@ SPAN had a 25 @-@ hour " call @-@ in marathon " , from 8 : 00 p.m. Eastern Time on Friday , October 7 , concluding at 9 : 00 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday , October 8 . The network also had a viewer essay contest , the winner of which was invited to host an hour of the broadcast from C @-@ SPAN 's Capitol Hill studios . 
 = = = Scope and limitations of coverage = = = 
 C @-@ SPAN continues to expand its coverage of government proceedings , with a history of requests to government officials for greater access , especially to the U.S. Supreme Court . In December 2009 , Lamb wrote to leaders in the House and Senate , requesting that negotiations for health care reform be televised by C @-@ SPAN . Committee meetings on health care were broadcast subsequently by C @-@ SPAN and may be viewed on the C @-@ SPAN website . In November 2010 , Lamb wrote to incoming House Speaker John Boehner requesting changes to restrictions on cameras in the House . In particular , C @-@ SPAN asked to add some of its own robotically operated cameras to the existing government @-@ controlled cameras in the House chamber . In February 2011 , Boehner denied the request . A previous request to Speaker Designate Nancy Pelosi in 2006 , to add C @-@ SPAN 's cameras in the House chamber to record floor proceedings , was also denied . Although C @-@ SPAN uses the congressional chamber feed cables , the cameras are owned and controlled by each respective body of Congress . Requests by C @-@ SPAN for camera access to non @-@ government events such as the annual dinner by the Gridiron Club have also been denied . 
 On June 22 and into June 23 , 2016 , C @-@ SPAN took video footage of the House floor from individual House representatives via streaming services Periscope and Facebook Live during a sit @-@ in by House Democrats asking for a vote on gun control measures after the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting . This needed to be done because — as the sit @-@ in was done out of formal session and while the House was in official recess — the existing House cameras could not be utilized for coverage of the event by rule . Although the use of electronic devices to create the Periscope feeds by House Democrats violated House rules that prohibit their use on the floor , C @-@ SPAN did not state why it chose to broadcast those feeds . The network ran disclaimers on @-@ air and on their official social media feeds noting the restrictions . 
 = = = Expansion and technology = = = 
 Since the late 1990s , C @-@ SPAN has significantly expanded its online presence . In January 1997 , C @-@ SPAN began real @-@ time streaming of C @-@ SPAN and C @-@ SPAN2 on its website , the first time that Congress had been live streamed online . To cover the Democratic and Republican conventions and the presidential debates of 2008 , C @-@ SPAN created two standalone websites : the Convention Hub and the Debate Hub . In addition to real @-@ time streams of C @-@ SPAN 's television networks online , c @-@ span.org features further live programming such as committee hearings and speeches that are broadcast later in the day , after the House and Senate have left . 
 C @-@ SPAN began promoting audience interaction early in its history , by the regular incorporation of viewer telephone calls in its programming . It has since expanded into social media . In March 2009 , viewers began submitting questions live via Twitter to guests on C @-@ SPAN 's morning call @-@ in show Washington Journal . The network also has a Facebook page to which it added occasional live streaming in January 2011 . The live stream is intended to show selected well @-@ publicized events of Congress . In June 2010 , C @-@ SPAN joined with the website Foursquare to provide users of the application with access to <unk> C @-@ SPAN content at various locations in Washington , D.C. 
 In 2010 , C @-@ SPAN began a transition to high definition telecasts , planned to take place over an 18 @-@ month period . The network provided C @-@ SPAN and C @-@ SPAN2 in high definition on June 1 , 2010 , and C @-@ SPAN3 in July 2010 .

 = = = Senate and House of Representatives = = = 
 The C @-@ SPAN network 's core programming is live coverage of the U.S. House and Senate , with the C @-@ SPAN channel emphasizing the United States House of Representatives . Between 1979 and May 2011 , the network televised more than 24 @,@ 246 hours of floor action . C @-@ SPAN2 , the first of the C @-@ SPAN spin @-@ off networks , provides uninterrupted live coverage of the United States Senate . With coverage of the House and Senate , viewers can track legislation as it moves through both bodies of Congress . Important debates in Congress that C @-@ SPAN has covered live include the Persian Gulf conflict during 1991 , and the House impeachment vote and Senate trial of President Bill Clinton in 1998 and 1999 . When the House or Senate are not in session , C @-@ SPAN channels broadcast other public affairs programming . 
 = = = Public affairs = = = 
 The public affairs coverage on the C @-@ SPAN networks other than the House and Senate floor debates is wide @-@ ranging . C @-@ SPAN is considered a useful source of information for journalists , lobbyists , educators and government officials as well as casual viewers interested in politics , due to its unedited coverage of political events . C @-@ SPAN has been described by media observers as a " window into the world of Washington politics " and it characterizes its own mission as being " to provide public access to the political process " . The networks cover U.S. political campaigns , including the Republican , Democratic , and Libertarian presidential nominating conventions in their entirety . Coverage of presidential campaign events are provided during the duration of the campaign , both by a weekly television program , Road to the White House , and at its dedicated politics website . C @-@ SPAN also covers midterm elections . 
 All three channels televise events such as congressional hearings , White House press briefings and presidential speeches , as well as other government meetings including Federal Communications Commission hearings and Pentagon press conferences . Other U.S. political coverage includes State of the Union speeches , and presidential press conferences . According to the results of a survey after the 1992 presidential election , 85 % of C @-@ SPAN viewers voted in that election . The results of a similar survey in 2013 found that 89 % of C @-@ SPAN viewers voted in the 2012 presidential election . In addition to this political coverage , the network broadcasts press conferences and meetings of various news media and nonprofit organizations , including those at the National Press Club , public policy seminars and the White House Correspondents ' Dinner . While C @-@ SPAN does not have video access to the Supreme Court , the network has used the Court 's audio recordings accompanied by still photographs of the justices and lawyers to cover the Court in session on significant cases , and has covered individual Supreme Court justices ' speaking engagements . 
 Occasionally , proceedings of the Parliament of Australia , Parliament of Canada , Parliament of the United Kingdom ( usually Prime Minister 's Questions and the State Opening of Parliament ) and other governments are shown on C @-@ SPAN when they discuss matters of importance to viewers in the U.S. Similarly , the networks will sometimes broadcast news reports from around the world when major events occur – for instance , C @-@ SPAN broadcast CBC Television coverage of the September 11 attacks . C @-@ SPAN also covers lying in state in the Capitol Rotunda and funerals of former presidents and other notable individuals . In 2005 , C @-@ SPAN covered Hurricane Katrina through NBC affiliate WDSU in New Orleans , as well as coverage of Hurricane Ike via CBS affiliate KHOU in Houston . C @-@ SPAN also carries CBC coverage during events that affect Canadians , such as the Canadian federal elections , the death and state funeral of Pierre Trudeau , and the 2003 North America blackout . During early 2011 , C @-@ SPAN carried broadcasts by Al Jazeera to cover the events in Egypt , Tunisia , and other Arab nations . Additionally , C @-@ SPAN simulcasts NASA Space Shuttle mission launches and landings live , using video footage and audio sourced from NASA TV . 
 With its public affairs programming , C @-@ SPAN intends to offer different points of view , by allowing time for multiple opinions to be discussed on a given topic . For example , in 2004 C @-@ SPAN intended to televise a speech by Holocaust historian Deborah Lipstadt adjacent to a speech by Holocaust denier David Irving , who had unsuccessfully sued Lipstadt for libel in the United Kingdom four years earlier ; C @-@ SPAN was criticized for its use of the word " balance " to describe the plan to cover both Lipstadt and Irving . When Lipstadt ended media access to her speech , C @-@ SPAN canceled coverage of both . 
 The network strives for neutrality and a lack of bias ; in all programming when on @-@ camera hosts are present their role is simply to facilitate and explain proceedings to the viewer . Due to this policy , no C @-@ SPAN host has said his or her own name on television .

 While many hours of programming on C @-@ SPAN are dedicated to coverage of the House , the network 's daily programming begins with the political telephone call @-@ in and interview program Washington Journal every morning from 7 : 00 to 10 : 00 a.m. Eastern Time . Washington Journal premiered on January 4 , 1995 and has been broadcast every weekday morning since then , with guests including elected officials , government administrators , and journalists . The program covers current events , with guests answering questions on topics provided by the hosts as well as from members of the general public . On the weekend schedule , C @-@ SPAN 's main programs are : America and the Courts , which is shown each Saturday at 7 : 00 p.m. Eastern Time , <unk> , a Sunday morning interview program with newsworthy guests ; Q & A , a Sunday evening interview program hosted by Brian Lamb , with guests including journalists , politicians , authors , and other public figures ; and The Communicators , which features interviews with journalists , government officials , and businesspeople involved with the communications industry and related legislation . 
 On weekends C @-@ SPAN2 dedicates its schedule to Book TV , which is 48 hours of programming about non @-@ fiction books , book events , and authors . Book TV was first launched in September 1998 . Booknotes was originally broadcast from 1989 to 2004 , as a one @-@ hour one @-@ on @-@ one interview of a non @-@ fiction author . Repeats of the interviews remain a regular part of the Book TV schedule with the title Encore Booknotes . Other Book TV programs feature political and historical books and biographies of public figures . These include In Depth , a live , monthly , three @-@ hour interview with a single author , and After Words , an author interview program featuring guest hosts interviewing authors on topics with which both are familiar . After Words was developed as a new type of author interview program after the end of production of Booknotes . Weekend programming on Book TV also includes coverage of book events such as panel discussions , book fairs , book signings , readings by authors and tours of bookstores around the U.S.

 C @-@ SPAN has occasionally produced spinoff programs from Booknotes focusing on specific topics . In 1994 , Booknotes collaborated with Lincoln scholar Harold Holzer to produce re @-@ creations of the seven Lincoln – Douglas debates . Several years later , a similar series retraced the journey of Alexis de Tocqueville described in Democracy in America . Another special series was American Writers , a 38 @-@ week tour of the U.S. based on the works of 40 famous American writers . 
 During 2008 and 2009 , as part of programming specially commissioned for the 200th anniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln , C @-@ SPAN produced a series titled Lincoln 200 Years , which featured episodes on a variety of topics relating to the life of Lincoln including his career , his homes and his opinions of slavery . 
 The network has also produced special feature documentaries of American institutions and historical landmarks , exploring their history to the present day . These programs include : The Capitol emphasizing the history , art , and architecture of the U.S. Capitol Building ; The White House , featuring film footage inside the White House and exploring the history of the building and its occupants ; The Supreme Court , focusing on the history and personalities of the court ; and Inside Blair House , an examination of the president 's guest house .

 C @-@ SPAN archival video is available through the C @-@ SPAN Video Library , maintained at the Purdue Research Park in West Lafayette , Indiana . First unveiled in August 2007 , the C @-@ SPAN Video Library contains all of the network 's programming since 1987 , totaling more than 160 @,@ 000 hours at its completion of digitization and public debut in March 2010 . Older C @-@ SPAN programming continues to be added to the library , dating back to the beginning of the network in 1979 , and some limited earlier footage from the National Archives , such as film clips of Richard Nixon 's 1972 trip to China , is available as well . Most of the recordings before 1987 ( when the C @-@ SPAN Archive was established ) were not saved , except for approximately 10 @,@ 000 hours of video which are slated to be made available online . As of June 2013 , the C @-@ SPAN Video Library held approximately 200 @,@ 000 hours of programming . Described by media commentators as a major educational service and a valuable resource for researchers of politics and history , the C @-@ SPAN Video Library has also had a major role in media and opposition research in several U.S. political campaigns . It won a Peabody Award in 2010 " for creating an enduring archive of the history of American policymaking , and for providing it as a free , user @-@ friendly public service . " 
 Prior to the initiation of the C @-@ SPAN Video Library , websites such as Metavid and <unk> hosted House and Senate video records , however C @-@ SPAN contested Metavid 's usage of C @-@ SPAN copyrighted footage . The result was Metavid 's removal of portions of the archive produced with C @-@ SPAN 's cameras , while preserving its archive of government @-@ produced content . C @-@ SPAN also engaged in actions to stop parties from making unauthorized uses of its content online , including its video of House and Senate proceedings . Most notably , in May 2006 , C @-@ SPAN requested the removal of Stephen Colbert 's performance at the White House Correspondents ' Association Dinner from YouTube . After concerns by some <unk> , C @-@ SPAN gave permission for Google Video to host the full event . On March 7 , 2007 C @-@ SPAN liberalized its copyright policy for current , future , and past coverage of any official events sponsored by Congress and any federal agency and now allows for attributed non @-@ commercial copying , sharing , and posting of C @-@ SPAN video on the Internet , excluding re @-@ syndication of live video streams . The new policy did not affect the public 's right to use the public domain video coverage of the floor proceedings of the U.S. House and Senate . 
 In 2008 , C @-@ SPAN 's online political coverage was expanded just prior to the elections , with the introduction of three special pages on the C @-@ SPAN website : the C @-@ SPAN Convention Hubs and C @-@ SPAN Debate Hub , which offered video of major events as well as discussion from <unk> and social media about the major party conventions and candidate debates . C @-@ SPAN brought back the Convention Hub for the 2012 presidential election . 
 In addition to the programming available in the C @-@ SPAN Video Library , all C @-@ SPAN programming is available as a live feed streamed on its website in Flash Video format . 
 On July 29 , 2014 , C @-@ SPAN announced that it would begin restricting access to the live feeds of the main channel , C @-@ SPAN2 and C @-@ SPAN3 to subscribers of cable or satellite providers later that summer , citing concerns with the slow shift in viewing habits from cable television to the internet due to its reliance on carriage fees from cable and satellite providers . However , it will continue to allow all government meetings , hearings and conferences to be streamed live online and via archived on the C @-@ SPAN Video Library without requiring an authenticated login by a provider . The decision drew some criticism from public interest and government transparency advocates , citing the fact that C @-@ SPAN was designed as a public service .

There are not any official viewing statistics for C @-@ SPAN because the network , which has no commercials or underwriting advertisements , does not use the Nielsen ratings . However , there have been a number of surveys providing estimates : 
 A 1994 survey found that 8 @.@ 6 % of the U.S. population regularly watched C @-@ SPAN . 
 In 2004 this figure increased to 12 % of the U.S. population , according to a Pew Research Center survey , while 31 % of the population was categorized as occasional viewers . More than 28 million people said they watched C @-@ SPAN programming each week . 
 A March 2009 Hart Research survey found that 20 % of homes with cable television watch C @-@ SPAN at least once a week , for an estimated 39 million Americans . 
 A 2010 poll conducted by C @-@ SPAN and Penn Schoen Berland estimates that 79 million adults in the U.S. watched C @-@ SPAN at some time from 2009 to 2010 . 
 In January 2013 , Hart Research conducted another survey which showed that 47 million adults , or 24 % of adults with access to cable television , watch C @-@ SPAN weekly . Of the 47 million regular C @-@ SPAN viewers , 51 % are male and 49 % female ; 26 % are liberal , 31 % conservative , and 39 % moderate . About half are college graduates . 28 % of 18 @-@ to @-@ 49 @-@ year @-@ olds report watching at least once a week , as do 19 % of 50- to 64 @-@ year @-@ olds , and 22 % of those over age 65 .

 A 2009 C @-@ SPAN survey of viewers found that the network 's most @-@ valued attribute was its balanced programming . The survey 's respondents were a mixed group , with 31 % describing themselves as " liberal , " while 28 % described themselves as " conservative " , and the survey found that C @-@ SPAN viewers are an equal mixture of men and women of all age groups . 
 C @-@ SPAN 's public service nature has been praised as an enduring contribution to national knowledge . In 1987 , Andrew Rosenthal wrote for The New York Times about C @-@ SPAN 's influence in political elections , arguing that C @-@ SPAN 's " blanket coverage " had expanded television journalism " into areas once shielded from general view " . The network has received positive media coverage for providing public access to proceedings such as the Goldman Sachs Senate hearings , and the U.S. 2010 Healthcare Summit , while its everyday programming has been credited with providing the media and the general public with an intimate knowledge of U.S. political proceedings and people . The ability of C @-@ SPAN to provide this service without federal funding , advertising or soliciting viewer contributions has been remarked by local newspapers and online news services , with the Daily Beast terming C @-@ SPAN 's $ 55 million annual budget ( in 2009 ) , " an astounding bargain . " In an article on the 25th anniversary of the network , The Washington Post noted that C @-@ SPAN 's programming has been copied by television networks worldwide and credits the network with providing information about foreign politics to American viewers . According to The New York Times , C @-@ SPAN 's mission to record official events in Washington , D.C. makes it " one of a kind " , particularly in the creation of the C @-@ SPAN Video Library , which received significant press coverage . 
 Despite its stated commitment to providing politically balanced programming , C @-@ SPAN and its shows such as Washington Journal , Booknotes , Q & A , and After Words have been accused by some liberal organizations of having a conservative bias . In 2005 , the media criticism organization Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting ( FAIR ) released a study of C @-@ SPAN 's morning telephone call @-@ in show Washington Journal , showing that Republicans were favored as guests over Democrats by a two @-@ to @-@ one margin during a six @-@ month period that year , and that people of color are underrepresented . A 2007 survey released by the Center for Economic and Policy Research reported that C @-@ SPAN covered conservative think tanks more than left @-@ of @-@ center think tanks .

 In 1992 , Congress passed must @-@ carry regulations , which required cable carriers to allocate spectrum to local broadcasters . This affected the availability of C @-@ SPAN in some areas , in particular C @-@ SPAN2 , as some providers chose to discontinue carriage of the channel altogether . Between 1993 and 1994 , cable systems in 95 U.S. cities dropped or reduced broadcasts of C @-@ SPAN and C @-@ SPAN2 , following the implementation of the must @-@ carry regulations . Viewers protested these decisions , especially when the changes coincided with matters of local interest occurring in the House or Senate . Some communities , such as Eugene , Oregon and Alexandria , Virginia , were successful in restoring C @-@ SPAN availability . C @-@ SPAN availability was later restored as technological developments that resulted in the expansion of channel capacity on cable providers allowed for mandatory stations and the C @-@ SPAN networks both to be broadcast .

 = Robert Henry Cain = 
 Major Robert Henry Cain VC TD ( 2 January 1909 – 2 May 1974 ) was a Manx recipient of the Victoria Cross , the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces . 
 Cain grew up on the Isle of Man and joined the Honourable Artillery Company in 1928 . After working overseas he was given an emergency commission into the Army in 1940 . He transferred to the South Staffordshire Regiment in 1942 , and joined their 2nd Battalion , part of the British 1st Airborne Division . He saw action during the Invasion of Sicily in 1943 and again during the Battle of Arnhem the following year . During the battle Major Cain 's company was closely engaged with enemy tanks , self @-@ propelled guns and infantry . Cain continually exposed himself to danger while leading his men and personally dispatched as much enemy armour as possible . Despite sustaining several injuries he refused medical attention and for his gallantry he was awarded the Victoria Cross . 
 Later in the war he took part in Operation Doomsday , where the 1st Airborne Division oversaw the German surrender in Norway . He left the army in late 1945 and returned to his pre @-@ war job at Royal Dutch Shell . He died of cancer in 1974 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Robert Cain was born in Shanghai on 2 January 1909 . His parents were Manx and returned to the Isle of Man when he was young , where he was educated at King William 's College . In 1928 Cain joined the Honourable Artillery Company , a unit of the Territorial Army ( TA ) . The TA was the volunteer reserve force of the British Army and members continued in civilian work ; Cain worked in Thailand and Malaya for Shell . He was placed on the supplementary reserve list on 12 February 1931 . 
 = = Second World War = = 
 In April 1940 , shortly after the start of the Second World War , Cain was given an emergency commission into the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers as a Second Lieutenant . In 1942 , he was seconded to 2nd Battalion South Staffordshire Regiment before being temporarily promoted to the rank of Major in April 1943 — a position he would keep until being honourably granted the rank in 1945 . The 2nd Battalion South Staffordshire Regiment was part of 1st Airlanding Brigade which landed in Sicily in July 1943 as part of Operation Ladbroke . In the same month , Cain took command of the battalion 's B Company . 
 = = = Battle of Arnhem = = = 
 The Battle of Arnhem was part of Operation Market Garden , an attempt to secure a string of bridges through the Netherlands . At Arnhem the British 1st Airborne Division and Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade were tasked with securing bridges across the Lower Rhine , the final objectives of the operation . However , the airborne forces that dropped on 17 September were not aware that the 9th SS and 10th SS Panzer divisions were also near Arnhem for rest and refit . Their presence added a substantial number of Panzergrenadiers , tanks and self @-@ propelled guns to the German defenses and the Allies suffered heavily in the ensuing battle . Only a small force managed to hold one end of the Arnhem road bridge before being overrun on the 21st . The rest of the division became trapped in a small pocket west of the bridge and had to be evacuated on the 25th . The Allies failed to cross the Rhine , which remained under German control until Allied offensives in March 1945 . 
 = = = = Advance into Arnhem = = = = 
 The Allies planned to fly the British and Polish to Arnhem in three separate lifts over three days . Major General Roy Urquhart decided to deploy the 1st Airlanding Brigade first , as glider troops could assemble more quickly than parachute infantry and secure the landing areas . Cain took off with the first lift along with two companies of the South Staffords but only five minutes after departing from RAF Manston the tow rope connecting the Albemarle tug to his Horsa glider pulled out of the leading aircraft . After landing safely the glider 's occupants were able to fly out the following day with the second lift . 
 In Arnhem the Allied plan quickly unravelled . Only a small group of the 1st Parachute Brigade , mainly elements of Lieutenant Colonel John Frost 's 2nd Battalion , were able to reach the bridge . The 1st and 3rd Battalions were unable to penetrate the outer suburbs of the city and their advance stalled , so in order to support them the first lift of the South Staffords were sent forward on the morning of the 18th . When Cain arrived with the second lift they too were sent forward , arriving at the outskirts of Arnhem on the night of the 18th . Lieutenant Colonel David Dobie of the 1st Battalion proposed a concentrated attack on a narrow front between the Lower Rhine and the Arnhem railway line . The South Staffords would advance toward the bridge , with the remnants of the 1st and 3rd Battalions on their right flank , while the 11th Parachute Battalion , remained in reserve . The Staffords moved forward at <unk> with D Company in the lead , followed by B and A Companies with C Company in reserve . In the area around St Elizabeth Hospital , the lead company met heavy resistance clearing houses and B Company took the lead , getting as far as a dell near the Arnhem City Museum . Here Cain and his men encountered enemy armour for the first time . The company was only armed with PIATs and mortars and although Cain and several of his company opened fire on the tanks and guns , they did not manage to disable any . By 11 : 30 they had run out of PIAT ammunition and the tanks now dominated the area . Their position was clearly hopeless and so Lieutenant Colonel McCardie , the commanding officer ( CO ) of 2nd Battalion , The South Staffordshire Regiment , ordered them to withdraw from the dell . Cain fell back with several of his men but few of them were able to escape , while the men of the other companies were forced to surrender in their droves . Cain was the only senior officer of the battalion to escape in what he later described as the " South Staff 's Waterloo " . 
 As the surviving men fell back through the 11th Battalion 's positions , Major Gilchrist ( A Company , 11th Battalion ) met Cain , who told him that " The tanks are coming , give me a PIAT " . Gilchrist was unable to oblige and so the Staffords regrouped behind the 11th Battalion 's positions ; roughly 100 surviving men forming into five small platoons under Cain 's command . Lieutenant Colonel George Lea , commander of the 11th Battalion , ordered them to capture a piece of wooded high ground known as Den Brink to cover a fresh advance , and a bayonet charge quickly cleared the enemy there . However , the thick tree roots on the hill made it impossible to dig in , and after suffering severe casualties , Cain took the decision to withdraw back to Oosterbeek . 
 = = = = Oosterbeek perimeter = = = = 
 The remnants of the four battalions fell back in disarray to the main divisional positions at Oosterbeek . Here they were gathered into defensive units by Lieutenant Colonel Sheriff Thompson , CO 1st Airlanding Light Artillery Regiment , who forcibly stopped many of the panicked troops . Alarmed that the many retreating units would soon leave his own 75 <unk> Howitzers undefended , he sought out Cain , the most senior officer , and ordered him to form the men into a defensive screen ahead of the gun positions . Thompson later sent Major Richard Lonsdale to take command of these outlying troops , and throughout Wednesday 20 they weathered strong German attacks before falling back to the main divisional perimeter . The sector was designated " Thompson Force " , but was renamed " Lonsdale Force " when Thompson was wounded the following day . To the north and west of Oosterbeek other units fell back in the face of strong German resistance and over the next few days a thumb shaped perimeter formed around the town , with the Rhine at its base . 
 Lonsdale Force 's sector covered the southern end of the eastern perimeter , and Cain was one of three Majors defending this sector of the line . As the battle progressed he became determined to destroy as much enemy armour as possible and sited himself in a laundry 's garden , much to the chagrin of the Dutch owner . Over the coming days Cain was everywhere , dealing with armour and snipers and encouraging his men . On the afternoon of Thursday 21st two tanks approached Cain 's position . Guided by a colleague in a building above him , Cain waited in a trench until the first tank — actually a StuG III self @-@ propelled gun ( SPG ) — was close enough to engage . The SPG fired at the building , killing Cain 's colleague and showering him with masonry but despite this , Cain kept his position . Staff Sergeant Richard Long of the Glider Pilot Regiment remembered that through the clouds of dust , Cain fired round after round from his PIAT until the SPG was disabled , but whilst engaging the second tank a round exploded in the PIAT with a bright flash and Cain was thrown backwards . Cain recalled thinking he was blind and " shouting like a hooligan . I shouted to somebody to get onto the PIAT because there was another tank behind . I <unk> and yelled and used some very colourful language . They dragged me off to the aid post . " The British brought forward one of the Light Regiment 's 75mm guns which blew the tank apart . 
 Witnesses believed that Cain was incapacitated , but within half an hour his sight returned . He refused morphia and against all advice returned to the front lines , deciding that he " wasn 't wounded enough to stay where [ he ] was " . On the following day his eardrums burst from the constant firing and barrage , but he was content to stuff his ears with bandages and continue fighting . On Sunday 24th , shortly after a truce to allow the evacuation of casualties , Cain was alerted to the approach of a Tiger tank . Together with a Royal Artillery gunner he raced for a 6 pounder anti @-@ tank gun , manoeuvred it into position , fired and disabled the tank . He wanted to continue using the gun , but the recoil mechanism was destroyed . 
 By 25 September , the area occupied by the Lonsdale Force saw heavy fighting against self @-@ propelled guns , flamethrower tanks , and infantry . There were no PIATs available to the force by now ; instead Cain armed himself with a two @-@ inch mortar . Mortars are muzzle @-@ loading indirect fire weapons but Cain was forced to fire it on an almost horizontal plane due to the enemy 's proximity . His citation states that his leadership ensured that the South Staffordshire gave no ground and drove the enemy off in complete disorder . By the end of the battle , Cain had been reportedly responsible for the destruction or disabling of six tanks , four of which were Tigers , as well as a number of self @-@ propelled guns . 
 That night the Division began to withdraw in Operation Berlin . Many men shaved and blackened their faces and Cain removed a week 's growth of beard from his face , drying himself on his dirty , blood @-@ soaked Denison smock . After successfully crossing the Rhine , this led Brigadier ' Pip ' Hicks to comment " there 's one officer , at least , who 's shaved " . Cain 's reply was " I was well brought up , sir . " Cain made sure all of his men were over the river by dawn , before he himself crossed in an old boat . 
 = = Victoria Cross = = 
 Fifty @-@ nine decorations were published for the small group of men who successfully escaped Arnhem and these were awarded in an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 6 December 1944 . As well as being the only survivor of the battle to receive the Victoria Cross , Cain was also the first ( and currently only ) <unk> to be awarded the medal . Posthumous VCs were announced later , including one for Lance Sergeant John Baskeyfield of the 2nd South Staffordshire Battalion 's anti tank platoon . The 2nd Battalion thus became the only British battalion to receive two VCs in one engagement during the Second World War . 
 War Office , 2nd November , 1944 . 
 The KING has been graciously pleased to approve awards of the VICTORIA CROSS to : — 
 Captain ( temporary Major ) Robert Henry Cain ( <unk> ) , The Royal Northumberland Fusiliers , ( attd . The South Staffordshire Regiment ) ( I Airborne Division ) ( Salcombe , Devon ) . 
 In Holland on 19th September , 1944 , Major Cain was commanding a rifle company of the South Staffordshire Regiment during the Battle of Arnhem when his company was cut off from the rest of the battalion and during the next six days was closely engaged with enemy tanks , self @-@ propelled guns and infantry . The Germans made repeated attempts to break into the company position by infiltration and had they succeeded in doing so the whole situation of the Airborne Troops would have been jeopardised . 
 Major Cain , by his outstanding devotion to duty and remarkable powers of leadership , was to a large extent personally responsible for saving a vital sector from falling into the hands of the enemy . 
 On 20th September a Tiger tank approached the area held by his company and Major Cain went out alone to deal with it armed with a Piat . Taking up a position he held his fire until the tank was only 20 yards away when he opened up . The tank immediately halted and turned its guns on him , shooting away a corner of the house near where this officer was lying . Although wounded by machine gun bullets and falling masonry , Major Cain continued firing until he had scored several direct hits , immobilised the tank and supervised the bringing up of a 75 mm. howitzer which completely destroyed it . Only then would he consent to have his wounds dressed . 
 In the next morning this officer drove off three more tanks by the fearless use of his Piat , on each occasion leaving cover and taking up position in open ground with complete disregard for his personal safety . 
 During the following days , Major Cain was everywhere where danger threatened , moving amongst his men and encouraging them by his fearless example to hold out . He refused rest and medical attention in spite of the fact that his hearing had been seriously impaired because of a perforated eardrum and he was suffering from multiple wounds . 
 On 25 September the enemy made a concerted attack on Major Cain 's position , using self @-@ propelled guns , flame throwers and infantry . By this time the last Piat had been put out of action and Major Cain was armed with only a light 2 " mortar . However , by a skilful use of this weapon and his daring leadership of the few men still under his command , he completely demoralized the enemy who , after an engagement lasting more than three hours , withdrew in disorder . 
 Throughout the whole course of the Battle of Arnhem , Major Cain showed superb gallantry . His powers of endurance and leadership were the admiration of all his fellow officers and stories of his valour were being constantly exchanged amongst the troops . His coolness and courage under incessant fire could not be surpassed . 
 There are some errors in Cain 's citation . The action described as occurring on the 20th actually took place on the 21st ( indeed this is the day on which Lieutenant Meikle — his spotter in the building above — was killed ) , and the Tiger tank he engaged was in fact a StuG III . 
 = = Later life = = 
 The hostilities in Europe officially ended on 8 May 1945 , when the Allies accepted the unconditional surrender of German forces . There were however a large number of German units in Norway — one of the few places in Europe still under German control — and the Allies feared the German commander there might attempt to fight on . In Operation Doomsday , Cain travelled to Oslo , Norway , with the 1st Airlanding Brigade on 11 May 1945 . Working with Milorg ( the Norwegian resistance ) , the British took the surrender of German troops in Norway without incident , before returning to the UK on 25 August 1945 . Having remained in the service of the South Staffordshire Regiment , Cain officially relinquished his wartime commission on 28 December 1945 and was granted the honorary rank of Major . Upon leaving the army he went back to his pre @-@ war occupation with Shell , living in East Asia and then West Africa . In 1951 he was elected to the Nigerian House of Representatives while working there . He returned to Britain in 1965 and settled in the Isle of Man upon his retirement . 
 Cain died of cancer on 2 May 1974 in Crowborough , Sussex . He was cremated at Worth Crematorium and buried in the family grave at <unk> Cemetery on the Isle of Man . There are several memorials in Cain 's honour . King William 's College has a memorial scholarship in his name and the chapel in the Hospice at Douglas is dedicated in his name . An oak tree in <unk> Arboretum , planted with acorns gathered from Arnhem , has been christened the Arnhem Oak in memory of his bravery . His medal , Denison smock and the maroon beret he wore during the Battle of Arnhem are all held at the Staffordshire Regiment Museum . His daughter , Frances Catherine Cain , unveiled a set of commemorative coins honouring her father on the Isle of Man in 2006 . She is also married to , and acts as the agent for , British television and motoring journalist Jeremy Clarkson who presented a BBC documentary , " The Victoria Cross : For Valour " on Cain and other VC winners in 2003 . Frances Cain was unaware of her father 's VC until after he died because , according to Clarkson , " he 'd never thought to mention it " .

 Michael Patrick Barrett ( born October 22 , 1976 ) is a former Major League catcher and current manager of the rookie @-@ level Gulf Coast Nationals . He started his professional career with the Montreal Expos at age 18 . Barrett spent three years playing in Minor League Baseball as a shortstop and catcher . He played with the Honolulu Sharks , West Palm Beach Expos , and Delmarva Shorebirds , and was elected to two Minor League All @-@ Star games . Barrett made his Major League debut in 1998 as a third baseman , but was shortly outrighted to the minor leagues to play with the Harrisburg Senators for a season . 
 Upon Barrett 's return to the Major Leagues in 1999 , he ranked among the top offensive rookies in various statistical categories . Barrett failed to stay healthy during the 2003 season , which prompted the Expos to trade him to the Oakland Athletics , who in turn , traded him to the Chicago Cubs . During his tenure with the Cubs , Barrett won a Silver Slugger Award in 2005 , and recorded near career @-@ high statistics in 2004 season . The Cubs traded Barrett to the San Diego Padres in June of 2007 . Barrett sustained two major injuries , which caused him to miss 115 games with the Padres , and was subsequently released after the 2008 season . Barrett attempted to make a comeback with the Toronto Blue Jays in 2009 , but continued to struggle with injury issues , which led to his release in the subsequent offseason . He spent the second half of the 2010 season in the New York Mets minor league system , and has not played professional baseball since , but has not officially announced his retirement . Barrett was also a volunteer assistant coach for the baseball team at the University of North Georgia .

 Barrett was born in Atlanta . He attended Pace Academy , where he excelled in baseball . During his senior year , Barrett won Atlanta 's Gatorade 's Player of the Year , and was named to the All @-@ USA High School and First Team High School All @-@ Americans All @-@ star teams . He was considered to be one of the top draft prospects that year , and declared eligibility for the upcoming Major League Baseball Draft shortly after graduating from high school . The Montreal Expos selected Barrett as the 28th overall selection in the 1995 draft . He spent the next three years in the minors , playing in the Gulf Coast , South Atlantic , Hawaii Winter Baseball , and Florida State Leagues , during which he was converted from a shortstop to a catcher . His Minor League Baseball career was highlighted in 1996 , when he scored 57 runs and recorded 113 hits as a member of the Delmarva Shorebirds .

 The Expos called Barrett to the Major Leagues on September 19 , 1998 , in a game against the Cincinnati Reds as a third baseman . He managed to hit a home run and a single in the game . After only playing eight games as an Expo , Barrett was sent to play for the Harrisburg Senators , a Class AA team from the Eastern League . He recorded 145 hits , and seventy @-@ eight runs , nineteen home runs , and eighty @-@ seven RBI en route to winning the Double @-@ A All @-@ Star Catcher and Montreal Expos Minor League Player of the Year awards . His performance allowed him to claim a spot on the Expos ’ starting roster during the 1999 . During his first full season , Barrett had fifty @-@ nine starts as a catcher , sixty @-@ two as a third @-@ baseman , and six as shortstop . He also led all National League rookies with thirty @-@ two doubles , while ranking as one of top statistical tiers in runs , hits , and run batted in among all other rookies . 
 Barrett struggled to perform consistently in the 2000 season . He committed fifteen errors during the course of the season , while earning .891 fielding percentage as a catcher . In addition , he hit for only a .214 batting average , with only a .288 slugging percentage . These difficulties combined to prompt the Expos to send him to the minors again . After playing thirty games with the Ottawa Lynx of the International League , Barrett returned to the major leagues before 2001 . He was named onto the team 's opening day lineup , and eventually earned a full @-@ time spot on the team . He was one the Expos ' most consistent hitters , and posted career high statistics that season ; leading all National League catchers with thirty @-@ three doubles . Barrett also managed to improve his defensive performance by raising his fielding percentage to <unk> , while only committing seven errors . 
 He also saw success during the 2002 season . Barrett started the season by hitting home runs in the first two games of the season . He would go on to have one of his best months in the Majors , scoring with four home runs , seventeen RBI , eight doubles , and scored ten runs . The League recognized his efforts , and named Barrett the " National League co @-@ Player of the Week " for the second week of April after he recorded a franchise record eleven RBI within two games . Barrett finished the season with mixed results . While increasing his number of stolen bases and batting and slugging percentage , he failed to record as many runs , hits , and RBI , as he did in the previous season . He committed nine errors , which resulted in a lower fielding percentage , but excelled in throwing out base runners . 
 Barrett missed almost half of the 2003 on account of three injuries . He suffered the first during a game against the Colorado Rockies , during which one of Steve Reed 's pitches accidentally hit and bruised Barrett 's index finger . Barrett was able to continue playing , but claimed the injury had hindered his playing performance . He eventually managed to overcome the injury in July . He recorded a batting average of .333 and fifteen RBI . During this period , Barrett began to complain about tightness in his right hip flexor . This ailment took its toll on Barrett during a game against the Atlanta Braves , when he strained the muscles while taking a checked swing . The Expos sent Barrett on a rehabilitation assignment to play with the Edmonton Trappers , a AAA team from the Pacific Coast League . He only managed to play two games with team before fracturing his index finger on August 9 . Barrett returned to the major leagues on September 12 , although the Expos were already out of playoff contention .

 Barrett 's long tenure with the Expos ended in December 2003 . The team traded Barrett to the Oakland Athletics in exchange for Minor League pitcher Brett Price . The Athletics then traded Barrett to the Chicago Cubs for Damian Miller , only days after the initial transaction . Barrett , who had just spent six days with three teams , shortly signed a one @-@ year contract with the Cubs , which was worth nearly $ 1 @,@ 550 @,@ 000 . He first practiced with Cubs during their annual spring training sessions , and reported receiving a cold reception from teammates . Barrett went on to become one of their top hitters during the 2004 season . He played a crucial role in their wild card chase ; Barrett maintained a .287 batting average and hit sixteen home runs and sixty @-@ five RBI during the 2004 season . He finished the season as one the league 's top defensive catchers ( fielding at .994 with six errors ) , and led the Cubs in triples and sacrifice flies . 
 Barrett continued to be one of the Cubs ’ most consistent hitters in the 2005 season . He batted over .300 in three months of the season , and finished with 16 home runs , 32 doubles , and 61 RBI . Although he failed to meet and surpass the same statistical figures in the previous season , Barrett received a Silver Slugger Award for his efforts . Additionally , Barrett was selected to represent the United States in the 2006 World Baseball Classic . He played in four games , and recorded one run batted in . 
 Barrett sought to improve his numbers in the 2006 season , but ran into several obstacles . During the team 's annual series against the Chicago White Sox at U.S. Cellular Field , Barrett was involved in a major altercation with A. J. Pierzynski , which eventually led to a bench @-@ clearing brawl . He received a ten @-@ game suspension , which he served near the middle of June . Barrett rebounded after the incident , and batted over .300 in the final four months of the season . He suffered an <unk> hematoma in early September , and was forced to miss the rest of the season . The injury and suspension caused Barrett to miss a significant portion of the season . In his shortened season , Barrett hit sixteen home runs , which matched his previous career high , and nearly surpassed his hit total from 2005 . 
 Barrett was unable to live up to expectations in the 2007 season . He was unable to replicate his statistical figures from the previous season , and finished May with a .244 batting average and only seven home runs . Barrett infamously made headlines when he was involved in a nationally televised dugout altercation with pitcher Carlos Zambrano . Lou Piniella dismissed both players for the afternoon , while the League proceeded to fine both players . Nearly two weeks later , a television camera caught Barrett engaging in a heated argument with Rich Hill over a pitch that resulted in an RBI . The tensions caused Barrett to lose his role as the Cubs ' everyday starting catcher . While Barrett increased his batting average over the next few games , his career with the Cubs began to come to a close near the middle of June .

 Various news sources reported that the Cubs had traded Barrett to the San Diego Padres on the morning of June 20 . The Cubs officially confirmed these details in the afternoon , and revealed that Barrett was traded in exchange for Rob Bowen and <unk> Burke . Despite stating he had no knowledge of the trade until hearing rumors in the morning , Barrett expressed his appreciation and well wishes to the Cubs organization on his homepage . He received a one @-@ game suspension on July 22 , after arguing with an umpire over a third strike . Barrett sustained a concussion on August 5 , after a base @-@ running accident against the San Francisco Giants . The Padres placed Barrett on the fifteen @-@ day disabled list . After returning from the injury , Barrett 's performance declined . His batting average dropped from .266 to .244 , while he produced near career low statistics . 
 Barrett became a free agent after the end of the season , but was offered arbitration from the Padres . The Tampa Bay Rays expressed interest in signing Barrett , even though the signing would involve trading the Padres a future second round draft pick as compensation . Barrett accepted the Padres ' arbitration offer on December 7 . The Padres placed Barrett on the disabled list on April 8 , 2008 , after he sustained an elbow injury . The team later activated him on May 25 , after he had recovered , and completed a minor league rehabilitation assignment . On July 2 , 2008 , Barrett was rushed to the hospital after fouling a pitch off his face . He required surgery to repair the damage , and had been placed on the disabled list for the second time in 2008 . The Padres waived Barrett on October 11 , after he previously expressed interest in testing the free @-@ agent market .

 On December 29 , 2008 , Barrett signed a Minor League deal with the Toronto Blue Jays , and attended spring training as a non @-@ roster invitee . He earned the back @-@ up catcher role for the Toronto Blue Jays during spring training . He was scheduled to back up Rod Barajas , but Barrett tore a muscle in his right shoulder while attempting to retrieve a wild pitch on April 17 , 2009 . Barrett was placed on the 15 @-@ day disabled list on April 18 , and was expected to return within the two weeks . Prior to the injury , Barrett had made seven appearances with a .167 batting average . The Blue Jays activated Barrett from the disabled list on July 6 , 2009 , and designated to Triple @-@ A for a rehab assignment , where he sustained a season @-@ ending injury . The Jays never recalled Barrett to their roster after the designation , and released him in the following offseason .

 While playing for the Chicago Cubs , Barrett was involved in two incidents with Houston Astros pitcher Roy Oswalt during the 2004 season . On August 22 , 2004 , Oswalt struck Barrett . Barrett , believing the pitch was a reaction to a three @-@ run home run that Aramis Ramírez had previously hit , confronted Oswalt , and prompted both teams to take the field . Oswalt was ejected from the game , as the Astros went on to lose 11 @-@ 6 . Five days later , during another Cubs @-@ Astros game , Barrett mouthed off to Oswalt and attempted to confront him . The game 's umpires restrained the two before a fight could break out , but not before both benches cleared out . Oswalt remained in the game , and defeated the Cubs 15 @-@ 7 .

Pierzynski collided with Barrett en route to home plate , causing Barrett to fall down . Pierzynski showed his enthusiasm by slapping home plate . As Pierzynski got up , he bumped into Barrett , who proceeded to punch him . Scott <unk> came to Pierzynski 's aid and subdued Barrett . Anderson and John Mabry eventually joined the brawl before both teams emptied their dugouts and stormed the field . 
 The game 's umpires ejected Barrett , Pierzynski , Anderson , and Mabry . Barrett later received a ten @-@ game suspension , while Pierzynski was fined .

The Braves recorded 20 hits , en route to winning 8 @-@ 5 . However , their productivity became overshadowed by the scuffle between Zambrano and Barrett . As the two returned to the dugout , they had an exchange of words , which escalated into a small fight . After Lou Piniella dismissed the two from the game , another fight ensued within the Cubs ’ clubhouse , and Zambrano punched Barrett 's lip . The wound required Barrett to go to the hospital immediately and receive stitches . Zambrano remorsefully admitted he was at fault after the ordeal , and Barrett later stated they had resolved their differences . Both players received fines for undisclosed amounts of money .

 = Cabin Fever ( Lost ) = 
 " Cabin Fever " is the 11th episode of the American Broadcasting Company 's fourth season of the serial drama television series Lost and 83rd episode overall . It was aired on May 8 , 2008 , on ABC in the United States and on CTV in Canada . The episode was written by supervising producer Elizabeth Sarnoff and Kyle Pennington and directed by Paul Edwards . According to a press release , " John Locke ( Terry O 'Quinn ) is enlightened as to the whereabouts of Jacob 's cabin , and life aboard the freighter becomes perilous . " The episode was written alongside " The Shape of Things to Come " and " Something Nice Back Home " . " Cabin Fever " was watched by 11 million American viewers . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The episode begins with a flashback to 1956 , when 16 @-@ year @-@ old Emily Locke ( Holland Roden ) is preparing for a date with a man twice her age . Her mother tries to stop her from going out , but Emily escapes and is struck by a car . The trauma triggers the premature birth of John ( as an adult portrayed by Terry O 'Quinn ) . John 's life is monitored by Richard Alpert ( Nestor Carbonell ) , who at John 's birth and throughout his childhood looks the same age as he does in present day , and Matthew Abaddon ( Lance Reddick ) , each of whom attempts to influence his life . The existence of <unk> Bioscience is revealed when John is invited to spend the summer there as a highly gifted high @-@ school student . 
 In the present day , Locke , Hugo " Hurley " Reyes ( Jorge Garcia ) and Benjamin Linus ( Michael Emerson ) are attempting to find a cabin inhabited by Jacob , the de facto leader of the Others . They are initially unsuccessful , but an apparition of deceased DHARMA Initiative member Horace Goodspeed ( Doug Hutchison ) assists Locke by pointing him to the Initiative 's mass grave . There , Locke extracts a set of blueprints from Horace 's jacket , and uses it to locate the cabin . 
 On the freighter Kahana , mercenary Martin Keamy ( Kevin Durand ) returns from his unsuccessful attack on the Barracks , the former home of the Others . Enraged that his mission was unsuccessful and several of his colleagues were killed , he accuses Gault ( Grant Bowler ) of giving him up to Ben , but Gault tells Keamy that Michael is the actual spy . He tries to kill Michael by shooting him , but just as in " Meet Kevin Johnson " when Michael tries to commit suicide , the gun jams . Gault ( Grant Bowler ) then tells Keamy that Michael is vital to repairing the engines , because he is the one that sabotaged them initially . Sayid Jarrah ( Naveen Andrews ) , fearing Keamy 's intentions , uses a Zodiac boat to return to the island , hoping to save as many people as possible . Desmond refuses to accompany him , saying that he would never return to the island after he left . 
 Several hours after Sayid leaves , Keamy stages a mutiny . A soldier receives a message from the island saying they found the body of ship doctor Ray ( Marc Vann ) ( as shown in " The Shape of Things to Come " ) , but the doctor protests that it 's impossible since he 's alive on the boat . Keamy orders Frank Lapidus ( Jeff Fahey ) at gunpoint to prepare the freighter 's helicopter ; Lapidus refuses , and Keamy kills the doctor and Gault in response . Lapidus acquiesces and Keamy leaves the freighter with a group of mercenaries , intending to " torch the Island " . When the helicopter passes over the survivors ' beach camp , Frank drops a bag containing a satellite phone onto the beach . 
 At the end of the episode , Locke enters the cabin alone and meets the figure of the deceased Christian Shephard ( John Terry ) , who claims he is speaking on Jacob 's behalf and is accompanied by his daughter Claire Littleton ( Emilie de Ravin ) . Christian warns Locke that Keamy 's mercenaries from the Kahana are already en route to the Island , and that the Island must be moved .

 " Cabin Fever " was the fifth episode to be directed by Paul Edwards . It was the first installment to be written by Kyle Pennington , the eleventh by Elizabeth Sarnoff , and was the first that the two wrote together . Recurring guest star Nestor Carbonell appeared in seven episodes of Lost 's third season as Richard Alpert and the mysteries surrounding his ageless character were heavily discussed among the fan community . While producing the final episodes of the third season , Carbonell was cast in a starring role on the new CBS series Cane . The writers modified their original story plan for the third season in anticipation for Carbonell 's potential unavailability . Despite Carbonell 's willingness to return to Lost , CBS president Nina Tassler ruled out another Lost guest appearance . Cane was canceled during the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike , freeing Carbonell from his contract with CBS . Executive producer Carlton Cuse cited this as an unintended positive consequence of the strike .

" However , she thought that the scene did not use its full potential in emphasizing Hurley 's empathy and Ben 's reaction . However , Kristin Dos Santos of E ! , who gave the episode a mostly positive review , was critical of the scene ; she thought that the scene wasted time and was " cruel and unusual punishment " to air before the cliffhanger ending .

 = LGBT = 
 LGBT or GLBT is an initialism that stands for lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender . In use since the 1990s , the term is an adaptation of the initialism LGB , which was used to replace the term gay in reference to the LGBT community beginning in the mid @-@ to @-@ late 1980s . Activists believed that the term gay community did not accurately represent all those to whom it referred . 
 The initialism has become mainstream as a self @-@ designation ; it has been adopted by the majority of sexuality and gender identity @-@ based community centers and media in the United States , as well as some other English @-@ speaking countries . The term is used also in some other countries , particularly those which languages use the initialism , such as Argentina , France and Turkey . 
 The initialism LGBT is intended to emphasize a diversity of sexuality and gender identity @-@ based cultures . It may be used to refer to anyone who is non @-@ heterosexual or non @-@ cisgender , instead of exclusively to people who are lesbian , gay , bisexual , or transgender . To recognize this inclusion , a popular variant adds the letter Q for those who identify as queer or are questioning their sexual identity ; LGBTQ has been recorded since 1996 . Those who wish to include intersex people in LGBT groups suggest an extended initialism LGBTI . This initialism is used in all parts of " The Activist 's Guide " of the Yogyakarta Principles in Action . Some people combine the two acronyms and use the term LGBTIQ . 
 Whether or not LGBT people openly identify themselves may depend on local political concerns and whether they live in a discriminatory environment , as well as on the status of LGBT rights where they live . 
 = = History = = 
 Before the sexual revolution of the 1960s , there was no common non @-@ derogatory vocabulary for non @-@ heterosexuality ; the closest such term , third gender , traces back to the 1860s but never gained wide acceptance in the United States . 
 The first widely used term , homosexual , originally carried negative connotations . It was replaced by homophile in the 1950s and 1960s , and subsequently gay in the 1970s ; the latter term was adopted first by the homosexual community . Lars <unk> promoted use of the term sexual minority in the 1960s , ( <unk> ) as an analogy to the term ethnic minority for non @-@ whites . 
 As lesbians forged more public identities , the phrase " gay and lesbian " became more common . The Daughters of Bilitis folded in 1970 due to disputes over their direction : whether to focus on feminism or gay rights issues . As equality was a priority for lesbian feminists , disparity of roles between men and women or butch and femme were viewed as patriarchal . Lesbian feminists eschewed gender role play that had been pervasive in bars , as well as the perceived chauvinism of gay men ; many lesbian feminists refused to work with gay men , or take up their causes . 
 Lesbians who held a more essentialist view , that they had been born homosexual and used the descriptor " lesbian " to define sexual attraction , often considered the separatist , angry opinions of lesbian @-@ feminists to be detrimental to the cause of gay rights . Bisexual and transgender people also sought recognition as legitimate categories within the larger minority community . 
 After the elation of change following group action in the Stonewall riots in New York , in the late 1970s and the early 1980s , some gays and lesbians became less accepting of bisexual or transgender people . Critics said that transgender people were acting out stereotypes and bisexuals were simply gay men or lesbian women who were afraid to come out and be honest about their identity . Each community has struggled to develop its own identity including whether , and how , to align with other gender and sexuality @-@ based communities , at times excluding other subgroups ; these conflicts continue to this day . 
 From about 1988 , activists began to use the initialism LGBT in the United States . Not until the 1990s within the movement did gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender people gain equal respect . Although the LGBT community has seen much controversy regarding universal acceptance of different member groups ( bisexual and transgender individuals , in particular , have sometimes been marginalized by the larger LGBT community ) , the term LGBT has been a positive symbol of inclusion . Despite the fact that LGBT does not nominally encompass all individuals in smaller communities ( see Variants below ) , the term is generally accepted to include those not specifically identified in the four @-@ letter initialism . Overall , the use of the term LGBT has , over time , largely aided in bringing otherwise marginalized individuals into the general community . Transgender actress <unk> Cayne in 2009 described the LGBT community " the last great minority " , noting that " We can still be harassed openly " and be " called out on television . " 
 In response to years of lobbying from users and LGBT groups to eliminate discrimination , the online social networking service Facebook , in February 2014 , widened its choice of gender variants for users . In June 2015 , after the US Supreme Court verdict granting equal marriage rights , Facebook introduced a filter allowing users to color their profile pictures rainbow in celebration of LGBT equality . 
 = = Variants = = 
 Many variants exist including variations that change the order of the letters ; LGBT or GLBT are the most common terms and the ones most frequently seen . Although identical in meaning , LGBT may have a more feminist connotation than GLBT as it places the " L " ( for " lesbian " ) first . When not inclusive of transgender people , it is sometimes shortened to LGB . LGBT may also include additional " Q " s for " queer " or " questioning " ( sometimes abbreviated with a question mark and sometimes used to mean anybody not literally L , G , B or T ) producing the variants " LGBTQ " and " <unk> " " . In the United Kingdom , it is sometimes stylized as LGB & T , whilst the Green Party of England and Wales uses the term LGBTIQ in its manifesto and official publications . 
 The order of the letters has not been standardized ; in addition to the variations between the positions of the initial " L " or " G " , the mentioned , less common letters , if used , may appear in almost any order . <unk> related to LGBTQ people are sometimes referred to as " alphabet soup . " Variant terms do not typically represent political differences within the community , but arise simply from the preferences of individuals and groups . 
 The terms pansexual , omnisexual , fluid and queer @-@ identified are regarded as falling under the umbrella term bisexual ( and therefore are considered a part of the bisexual community ) . Likewise , the terms transsexual and intersex are regarded by some people as falling under the umbrella term transgender , though many transsexual and intersex people object to this . Some intersex people prefer the initialism LGBTI , while others insist that they are not a part of the LGBT community and would rather that they not be included as part of the term . In Australia , where LGBTI is increasingly used , and organizations representing cross @-@ community interests have a history of collaboration including through a National LGBTI Health Alliance , anti @-@ discrimination legislation recognizes that intersex is a biological attribute distinct from both gender identity and sexual orientation . 
 <unk> ( " same gender loving " ) is sometimes favored among gay male African Americans as a way of distinguishing themselves from what they regard as white @-@ dominated LGBT communities . MSM ( " men who have sex with men " ) is clinically used to describe men who have sex with other men without referring to their sexual orientation . 
 The gender identity " transgender " has been recategorized to trans * by some groups , where trans ( without the asterisk ) has been used to describe trans men and trans women , while trans * covers all non @-@ cisgender ( genderqueer ) identities , including transgender , transsexual , transvestite , genderqueer , genderfluid , non @-@ binary , <unk> , genderless , <unk> , non @-@ gendered , third gender , two @-@ spirit , <unk> , and trans man and trans woman . 
 Other variants may have a " U " for " unsure " ; a " C " for " curious " ; another " T " for " transvestite " ; a " TS " , or " 2 " for " two @-@ spirit " persons ; or an " SA " for " straight allies " . However , the inclusion of straight allies in the LGBT acronym has proven controversial as many straight allies have been accused of using LGBT advocacy to gain popularity and status in recent years , and various LGBT activists have criticised the heteronormative worldview of certain straight allies . Some may also add a " P " for " polyamorous " , an " H " for " HIV @-@ affected " , or an " O " for " other " . Furthermore , the initialism <unk> has seen use in India to encompass the hijra third gender identity and the related subculture . 
 The initialism <unk> ( lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender , transsexual , queer , questioning , intersex , asexual , ally , pansexual ) has also resulted , although such initialisms are sometimes criticized for being confusing and leaving some people out , as well as issues of placement of the letters within the new title . However , adding the term " allies " to the initialism has sparked controversy , with some seeing the inclusion of " ally " as opposed to " asexual " a form of asexual erasure . There is also the acronym <unk> ( queer and questioning , intersex , lesbian , transgender and two @-@ spirit , bisexual , asexual and ally , and gay and genderqueer ) . 
 The magazine Anything That Moves coined the acronym <unk> from fetish ( such as the BDSM community ) , allies or poly @-@ amorous ( as in polyamorous relationships ) , bisexual , gay , lesbian , intersex , transgender , transsexual engendering revolution or inter @-@ racial attraction ; however , this term has not made its way into common usage . 
 Wesleyan University used the initialism <unk> for " lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender , transsexual , queer , questioning , <unk> , asexual , gender @-@ fuck , polyamorous , bondage / discipline , dominance / submission , and sadism / masochism " . Some use the much shorter style LGBT + to mean " LGBT and related communities " . 
 Some research , conducted anonymously and online and including the ' Q ' category , found that more adolescents and young adults identified as ' Q ' ( questioning ) compared with other LGBTQ categories . This may reflect the uncertainty and external pressures surrounding human sexuality . 
 = = Criticism of the term = = 
 The initialisms LGBT or GLBT are not agreeable to everyone that they encompass . For example , some argue that transgender and transsexual causes are not the same as that of lesbian , gay , and bisexual ( LGB ) people . This argument centers on the idea that transgender and transsexuality have to do with gender identity , or a person 's understanding of being or not being a man or a woman irrespective of their sexual orientation . LGB issues can be seen as a matter of sexual orientation or attraction . These distinctions have been made in the context of political action in which LGB goals , such as same @-@ sex marriage legislation and human rights work ( which may not include transgender and intersex people ) , may be perceived to differ from transgender and transsexual goals . 
 Many people have looked for a generic term to replace the numerous existing initialisms . Words such as queer ( an umbrella term for sexual and gender minorities that are not heterosexual , or gender @-@ binary ) and rainbow have been tried , but most have not been widely adopted . Queer has many negative connotations to older people who remember the word as a taunt and insult and such ( negative ) usage of the term continues . Many younger people also understand queer to be more politically charged than LGBT . " Rainbow " has connotations that recall hippies , New Age movements , and groups such as the Rainbow Family or Jesse Jackson 's Rainbow / PUSH Coalition . 
 Some people advocate the term " minority sexual and gender identities " ( <unk> , coined in 2000 ) , or gender and sexual / sexuality minorities ( GSM ) so as to explicitly include all people who are not cisgender and heterosexual , or gender , sexual , and romantic minorities ( <unk> ) which is more explicitly inclusive of minority romantic orientations and polyamory , but those have not been widely adopted either . Other rare umbrella terms are Gender and Sexual <unk> ( GSD ) , <unk> ( Marginalized Orientations , Gender Identities , and Intersex ) and <unk> ( Marginalized Orientations , Gender Alignments and Intersex ) . 
 A reverse to the above situations is evident in the belief of " lesbian & gay separatism " ( not to be confused with the related " lesbian separatism " ) , which holds that lesbians and gay men form ( or should form ) a community distinct and separate from other groups normally included in the LGBTQ sphere . While not always appearing of sufficient number or organization to be called a movement , separatists are a significant , vocal , and active element within many parts of the LGBT community . In some cases separatists will deny the existence or right to equality of <unk> orientations and of transsexuality . This can extend to public <unk> and transphobia . In contrasts to separatists , Peter Tatchell of the LGBT human rights group OutRage ! argues that to separate the transgender movement from the LGB would be " political madness " , stating that " Queers are , like transgender people , gender deviant . We don ’ t conform to traditional heterosexist assumptions of male and female behaviour , in that we have sexual and emotional relationships with the same sex . We should celebrate our discordance with mainstream straight norms . " 
 The portrayal of an all @-@ encompassing " LGBT community " or " LGB community " is also disliked by some lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender people . Some do not subscribe to or approve of the political and social solidarity , and visibility and human rights campaigning that normally goes with it including gay pride marches and events . Some of them believe that grouping together people with non @-@ heterosexual orientations perpetuates the myth that being gay / lesbian / bi / asexual / pansexual / etc. makes a person <unk> different from other people . These people are often less visible compared to more mainstream gay or LGBT activists . Since this faction is difficult to distinguish from the heterosexual majority , it is common for people to assume all LGBT people support LGBT liberation and the visibility of LGBT people in society , including the right to live one 's life in a different way from the majority . In the 1996 book Anti @-@ Gay , a collection of essays edited by Mark Simpson , the concept of a ' one @-@ size @-@ fits @-@ all ' identity based on LGBT stereotypes is criticized for suppressing the individuality of LGBT people . 
 Writing in the BBC News Magazine in 2014 , Julie Bindel questions whether the various gender groupings now , " bracketed together " . . . " share the same issues , values and goals ? " Bindel refers to a number of possible new initialisms for differing combinations and concludes that it may be time for the alliances to be reformed or finally we go , " our separate ways " . 
 = The Punisher ( 1993 video game ) = 
 The Punisher ( Japanese : <unk> , Hepburn : <unk> ) is a 1993 beat ' em up arcade game developed and released by Capcom . It stars the Marvel Comics ' anti @-@ hero the Punisher and co @-@ stars S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury as the second player 's character as they embark on a mission to kill the crime lord the Kingpin and bring down his organization . Whilst following the same general formula as Capcom 's previous beat ' em ups , the game has a range of usable weapons and a comics @-@ style presentation . 
 The Punisher gained significant popularity in arcades and is widely regarded as one of the best titles in the beat ' em up genre as well as one of the best video game adaptations of comic books . A Mega Drive / Genesis port was developed by Sculptured Software and published by Capcom USA and Marvel Entertainment in 1994 to mixed reviews . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The Punisher follows the same side @-@ scrolling beat 'em up formula Capcom established in Final Fight and Captain Commando as the protagonists engage foes and stage bosses . As in most beat 'em up games of this kind , progression through the game is achieved by systematically eliminating all common enemies and proceeding to the right ( or left ) , and defeating the bosses met at the end of each stage . Unlike in Final Fight , the player characters Punisher and Nick Fury 's size , abilities and tactics are essentially interchangeable ; they both use the same basic moves , such as punches , kicks and throws , which can be chained chained into combos , as well as similar special attacks . Basic attacks can be combined to cause extra damage to enemies . The game is presented in a comic book @-@ like style , including featuring on @-@ screen <unk> such as " <unk> ! " for gunshots . 
 Various melee ( including baseball bats and Japanese swords ) and thrown weapons ( including knives and shuriken ) as well as improvised weapons ( such as lead pipes , car tires and a crude flamethrower ) can be picked up during regular combat . Weapons can be dropped by enemies or obtained from smashing various containers throughout the stages . When the player is armed with a weapon , its durability will be displayed alongside the player 's health , showing how much it can be used until it breaks apart . Treasure can also be found in containers , awarding the player with bonus score points once collected ( jewelry also appears after defeating female enemies ) . Health can be replenished by picking up food , which can also give bonus points . The game distinguishes itself by the frequent use of firearms , including an Ingram and a M16 . There are several sections of the game when gun @-@ wielding enemies appear to which the characters draw their handguns , enabling the player to shoot them . Player characters can also pick up and collect hand grenades that can be deployed at a moment of choice .

 The game begins in an illegal casino and the streets of the New York City , with Frank " the Punisher " Castle ( optionally partnered with Nick Fury ) in pursuit of the Mafia enforcer Bruno Costa ; the chase ends with a fight against Chester Scully ( a minor villain from the comics ) .

 The Punisher for the arcades was released in April 1993 , marking the beginning of the partnership between Marvel Comics and Capcom , which led to the series Marvel vs. Capcom .

 A console port of The Punisher was released for the Genesis in North America in 1994 and for the PAL region Mega Drive in April 1995 . This version , while published by Capcom , was developed by an independent American company Sculptured Software . In addition to the worse graphics and sound , lesser variety of enemies , and a smaller amount of objects on screen than in the original , many of the previously breakable background objects were rendered unbreakable due to the limitations of the Genesis ' hardware . 
 This version also contains some content censorship , including removing the most explicit violence as well as the animation of Fury smoking his cigar , and female ninja enemies with skimpy outfits becoming fully clothed . The port also comes with three difficulty settings , but the Easy setting ends after only three stages and the game can be properly completed only on Normal or Hard . The PlayStation version was reported in works by Crystal Dynamics , but was never completed .

 Upon its release , GamePower gave the arcade version of The Punisher a 10 out of 10 partial score for the game 's " fun factor " . Its action was praised by GamePro , who remarked that " this game 's outstanding feature is its gorgeous graphics , which capture the dark , somber mood of the Punisher comic books . " 
 = = = Genesis = = = 
 Reviewing the Genesis conversion , VideoGames called it " a decent exercise in vigilante mayhem " that is " surprisingly fun , yet fairly standard game . " A preview by Mean Machines Sega opined it " looks good " and features " fantastic weaponry " , but EGM criticized the characters for being too small on the screen , also stating that there was little to no skill involved in defeating the bosses . EGM praised the number of weapons and moves available but nonetheless concluded that " the whole game comes across as routine and bland . " 
 GamePro outright panned the port , commenting that the special moves are too difficult to pull off , the sound effects are weak , the gameplay is generic and unimaginative beat ' em up fare , and " the graphics never come close to the coin @-@ op game that this cart is based on . " It was also lambasted by Next Generation , who stated that " not much good can be found " in the game and " the person responsible for putting out The Punisher deserves a good spanking . " The May 1995 issue of Hyper even had The Punisher as the worst rated game of the month .

 Notwithstanding the flawed home port and limited commercial success , the arcade original has achieved a cult game status . Official Sega Saturn Magazine and Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine both wished for The Punisher to be included in Capcom 's arcade compilation releases for the Sega Saturn and the PlayStation , respectively . According to <unk> in 2005 , " Capcom 's The Punisher was a brutally violent fighter that perfectly captured the anti @-@ hero it was based on . Featuring buckets of blood , some nasty moves and hordes of enemies , action came thick and fast , and so did the excitement . " The magazine too expressed a wish for it to be included in a compilation re @-@ release for a more modern gaming system , in this case the PlayStation Portable , but noted that the chances of this are slim due to a long @-@ expired license . 
 Retro Gamer called it " a forgotten gem in Capcom 's back catalogue " that " is bursting with character and is extremely enjoyable , " surmising the game did not sell well because the market was already flooded with beat ' em up games . GamesTM <unk> described it and the arcade Alien vs. Predator as old " gaming nuggets " that provided a " nirvana for fight fans " as " back in the mid @-@ Nineties , no @-@ one made scrolling beat- ' em @-@ ups like Capcom . " Some media outlets also singled out for a special praise the game 's particular elements , such as with Complex regarding its arcade cabinet and Cracked.com regarding its game over sequence . Crunchyroll 's Patrick Macias wrote : " I 'll confess my heart skipped a beat when I read The Punisher arcade game , the legacy of a misspent youth and countless tokens whittled away at Chuck E. Cheese . " 
 Some critics regard The Punisher as among the best of the beat ' em up genre , as well as among the best video game adaptations of comic books , especially of Marvel titles . In 2010 , it was ranked as the tenth top greatest superhero game by IGN 's News & Features Team , who noted it " was pretty brutal for its time , " and as the fifth top Marvel arcade game by iFanboy 's Josh Richardson . Nerdist Industries included it among the top ten most iconic Marvel video games in 2013 , calling it " one of the few games that benefits from its cheesiness " and stating that in 1993 the two @-@ player experience " was pretty much what Army of Two wishes it was today . " That same year , it was also listed as one of top beat ' em up games of all time by <unk> 's Elton Jones , as well as being included amongst the best looking beat ' em up games from the 16 @-@ bit era by Kotaku Australia 's Gergo Vas . David Hawkins of WhatCulture ! declared it number one best comics @-@ based arcade game in a 2011 ranking , being " above and beyond all other arcade adaptations of comic books and their heroes , " and Jon Ledford of Arcade Sushi opined that " in terms of pure enjoyment , ingenuity , control , and graphics , The Punisher is the Best Retro Beat ' Em Up of all time .

 Air Commodore Raymond James Brownell , CBE , MC , MM ( 17 May 1894 – 12 April 1974 ) was a senior officer in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) and a First World War flying ace . Born in Hobart , Tasmania , Brownell was working as a clerk with a firm of accountants when he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on the outbreak of the First World War . He served during the Gallipoli Campaign before transferring to the Western Front . Awarded the Military Medal for his actions during the Battle of Pozières , he was accepted for a transfer to the Royal Flying Corps in 1917 . Brownell undertook flight training in the United Kingdom . Commissioned as a second lieutenant , he was posted for operational service over the Western Front in September 1917 . Moving with his squadron to Italy , he was awarded the Military Cross and credited with shooting down 12 aircraft by war 's end . Taking his discharge in 1919 , Brownell returned to Australia . 
 Commissioned in the Royal Australian Air Force during 1921 , Brownell had risen to the rank of group captain by the beginning of the Second World War . Establishing the Royal Australian Air Force base in Singapore , he returned to Australia in 1941 as an air commodore and was appointed to lead No. 1 Training Group . He was Air Officer Commanding Western Area from January 1943 until July 1945 , when he took charge of the recently formed No. 11 Group on Morotai . Retiring from the Air Force in 1947 , Brownell assumed a partnership in a stockbroking firm . He died in 1974 at the age of 79 ; his autobiography , From Khaki to Blue , was published posthumously .

 Brownell was born in the Hobart suburb of New Town , Tasmania , on 17 May 1894 to William Percival Brownell , a draper , and his wife Julie Ann James ( née Scott ) . Initially educated at Leslie House School , Brownell later attended Scotch College , Melbourne where he was an active sportsman . On graduation , he was apprenticed to a firm of public accountants and auditors in Hobart . In 1912 , Brownell enlisted in the Citizens Military Force and was posted to the 41st Battery , Australian Field Artillery .

 On 12 September 1914 , Brownell transferred to the Australian Imperial Force for service during the First World War . Allotted to the 9th Battery , 3rd Field Artillery Brigade with the rank of gunner , Brownell embarked from Hobart aboard HMAT Geelong on 20 October , bound for Egypt . On arrival , the unit spent several months training in the desert , before it was posted for service during the Gallipoli Campaign . Instead of landing on the peninsula with the battery , Brownell was transferred to Alexandria where the Army required his administrative abilities as an accountant . 
 During July 1915 , Brownell was shipped to Gallipoli and rejoined the 9th Battery . Promoted to bombardier on 12 November , he was among one of the final Australian waves to be evacuated from the peninsula in December during the Allied withdrawal . Returning to Egypt , he was advanced to provisional sergeant on 24 February 1916 . Embarking with his unit from Alexandria , Brownell arrived in France for service on the Western Front on 29 March , following a six @-@ day voyage . 
 On 21 – 22 July 1916 , Brownell was in action with his battery at Pozières , during which the unit was subject to severe German shellfire . Throughout the engagement , Brownell established and maintained communications between the battery and firing line , despite fatigue or personal risk to himself . Commended for his " particularly meritorious service ... and ... gallantry in this work " , Brownell was subsequently recommended for the Military Medal . The notification for the award was published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 16 November 1916 . 
 = = = Royal Flying Corps = = = 
 In October 1916 , Brownell applied for a transfer to the Royal Flying Corps . One of 5 @,@ 000 applicants , Brownell was accepted on 1 January 1917 along with a further 200 Australians . Posted for pilot training , he proceeding to England and was posted to No. 3 School of Military Aeronautics at Exeter College , Oxford from 26 January . On graduating from the course , Brownell was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 16 March and commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Flying Corps the following day . 
 Allotted to No. 45 Squadron RFC flying Sopwith Camels , Brownell moved to France for operational service over the Western Front during September 1917 . On 10 September , he took part in his first patrol , during which he shot down a two @-@ seater German aircraft . In his time flying over the Western Front , Brownell accumulated a total of five victories and achieved ' ace ' status before his squadron was transferred to Italy in December . Later that month , Brownell and his observer , Lieutenant Henry Moody , shot down German ace <unk> Thurm over Asolo . 
 Appointed a flight commander in No. 45 Squadron , Brownell was promoted to temporary captain on 11 February 1918 . During aerial engagements against Central aircraft over the Italian front , he was accredited with the destruction of a further seven aircraft , bringing his total to 12 with an additional nine probables . Brownell 's aerial victories were composed of five aircraft and one shared destroyed , two and one shared out of control , one shared captured , and one balloon . For his success in bringing six of these aircraft down over a three @-@ month period , Brownell was awarded the Military Cross . The announcement of the decoration was published in a supplement of the London Gazette on 4 March 1918 , with the citation for the award being published in a later issue on 16 August 1918 , reading : 
 War Office , 16th August , 1918 . 
 With reference to the awards conferred as announced in the London Gazette dated 4th March , 1918 , the following are the statements of service for which the decorations were conferred : — 
 Awarded the Military Cross . 
 2nd Lt. Raymond James Brownell , M.M. , R.F.C. , Spec . Res. 
 For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty . Within the last three months he has brought down six enemy aeroplanes , four of which were seen to come down in flames , the other two falling completely out of control . The dash , gallantry and offensive spirit displayed on all occasions by this officer are worthy of the highest praise . 
 In April 1918 , Brownell was granted compassionate leave to visit his seriously ill mother . Leaving No. 45 Squadron , he travelled to Tasmania . At the end of his leave in September , he commenced his return journey to the United Kingdom . During the voyage , he became grievously ill with pneumonic influenza . On arrival , Brownell accepted a commission in the newly formed Royal Air Force ( RAF ) . However , Brownell 's mother again suffered a deterioration in health , so he sought to resign from the RAF and was placed on the unemployed list on 14 August 1919 . Embarking for Tasmania , he arrived during September . 
 = = Inter @-@ war years = = 
 On his return to Australia , Brownell was employed as a sub @-@ accountant for a firm of merchants in Melbourne , and later with the Hobart City Council as a clerk . On 22 April 1920 , Brownell acted as one of the pallbearers at the military funeral of his friend and fellow No. 45 Squadron officer , Captain Cedric Howell , who had been killed in an aeroplane crash while participating in the England to Australia air race . Seeking a position in the newly formed Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) , Brownell was commissioned as a flying officer on 12 September 1921 and posted to RAAF Point Cook in Victoria , training Air Force cadets . In a ceremony at St Andrew 's Presbyterian Church , Hobart , on 26 August 1925 , Brownell married <unk> Jean Birchall ; the couple would later have two daughters . The following year , Brownell assumed command of No. 1 Squadron . He led the squadron until 1928 , when he was appointed to the RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne as Director of Personnel Services . 
 During 1934 , Brownell was posted to England for exchange service with the RAF . Made second @-@ in @-@ command of No. 3 Flying Training School at Grantham , he was promoted to wing commander on 1 April 1936 . While still serving in the United Kingdom , Brownell was appointed commanding officer of No. 23 ( City of Perth ) Squadron ( later No. 25 Squadron ) , which had been formed earlier in 1937 . The squadron moved to RAAF Base Pearce in Western Australia during March 1938 , at which time Brownell returned to Australia and assumed command of the unit along with the base . Brownell was the first Commanding Officer of Pearce , which was not only the first RAAF establishment to be located in Western Australia , but also the first permanent air force unit to be established in the state . 
 = = Second World War = = 
 On the outbreak of the Second World War , additional units were placed under Brownell 's purview at RAAF Base Pearce and he was consequently promoted to temporary group captain in December 1939 . With the introduction of Lockheed Hudson aircraft to the RAAF in February 1940 , several units were re @-@ equipped , including No. 14 Squadron at RAAF Base Pearce . The Hudsons replaced the squadron 's Avro Ansons , which were to be ferried back to the eastern coast of Australia in order to be used as training aircraft . On one occasion , Brownell took part in ferrying an Anson to RAAF Point Cook with No. 14 Squadron pilot Charles Learmonth . Arriving with the aircraft , the pair piloted a de Havilland Moth Minor — a two @-@ seated , open @-@ cockpit , monoplane — back to Pearce . The return journey took Brownell and Learmonth seven days to complete , and involved a total of twenty @-@ one refuelling stops along the way . 
 In August 1940 , Brownell was ordered to Singapore in order to establish and command an RAAF station on the island , as well as administer the RAAF squadrons located in Malaya . Embarking aboard the SS Strathallan in mid @-@ August , Brownell and his staff formed the RAAF station within two weeks of arrival at Sembawang . Under the control of RAF Far East Command , the station was established as RAF Sembawang . During this time , Brownell frequently visited the Malaya peninsula . 
 Promoted to acting air commodore , Brownell returned to Australia in August 1941 and was appointed Air Officer Commanding No. 1 Training Group in Melbourne . With this position , Brownell was in command of approximately thirty establishments located in southern Australia . On 1 January 1943 , he was posted as Air Officer Commanding Western Area . Based at RAAF Base Pearce , Brownell 's responsibilities involved coordinating training and directing long @-@ range bombing operations . Following intelligence reports that a Japanese force was en route to raid Western Australia , the Australian Government ordered a build @-@ up of the defences in the area . In response to this , Brownell organised air defences around Perth and the Exmouth Gulf during March 1944 . With the use of Army transports , he also reinforced Cunderdin with supplies and bombs for the use of the heavy bombers in the area . The attack from the Japanese , however , did not occur . For his service as Air Officer Commanding Western Area , Brownell was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) in the 1945 New Years Honours . 
 Relinquishing command of Western Area in July 1945 , Brownell was appointed commander of the recently formed No. 11 Group . No. 11 Group was established as a static organisation that was to take administrative control of all RAAF units based on Morotai . The group assumed its role on 30 July , and had the initial jurisdiction of all Dutch territory in the area , along with British North Borneo and Sarawak . In addition to this , the unit held the three main responsibilities of local air defence and sea lane protection , support of adjacent formations and offensive operations against Japanese targets within range , as well as line @-@ of @-@ communication duties . The unit , however , was formed too late in the war to assume all of its responsibilities before the Second World War drew to an end . Brownell was present at the Japanese surrenders in Manila , Tokyo , and on Morotai . He was selected by the Australian government to attend the ceremony aboard the USS Missouri on 2 September 1945 , but was replaced by the Chief of the Air Staff , Air Vice Marshal George Jones , when Jones became available to make the trip to Japan . 
 = = Later life = = 
 Returning to Western Australia after the war , Brownell attended an investiture ceremony at Government House , Perth on 3 January 1947 , where he was presented with his CBE by the Lieutenant @-@ Governor of Western Australia . On 24 March that year , Brownell retired from the RAAF on medical grounds . He had in any case been slated for early retirement , along with other senior officers and veterans of the First World War , to make way for the advancement of younger and equally capable officers . 
 Following his retirement from the Air Force , Brownell was made a partner of S. G. Brearley & Co . , a stockbroking firm located in Perth . In 1951 , he became chairman of the associated sporting committee of the National Fitness Council of Western Australia ; he served in this role until 1967 . Aged 79 , Brownell died at Subiaco , Western Australia , on 12 April 1974 and was accorded a funeral with full Air Force honours . Brownell 's autobiography , From Khaki to Blue , was posthumously published by the Military Historical Society of Australia in 1978 . 
 = St Thomas the Martyr 's Church , Oxford = 
 St Thomas the Martyr 's is a Church of England parish church of the Anglo @-@ Catholic tradition , in Oxford , England , near Oxford railway station in Osney . It is located between Becket Street to the west and <unk> Row to the east , with St Thomas Street opposite . 
 = = Overview = = 
 The church was founded in the 12th century , dedicated to St Thomas Becket . The building still retains some of its original architecture , although substantial expansions and repairs have been made , particularly in the 17th century ( under the curacy of Robert Burton ) and in the 19th century . 
 The church played a significant role in the early stages of the Oxford Movement , being the site of daily services as well as such <unk> practices as altar candles and the wearing of Eucharistic vestments . The leaders of the Movement preached at the church , and the early Tractarians were closely associated with St Thomas 's . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = To the Restoration = = = 
 It has traditionally been held in Osney that the church was founded in the reign of Stephen , but this is unlikely to be true , as Thomas Becket was not martyred until some fifteen years after Stephen 's death . It is known that in the 1180s , the site was granted to the canons of the nearby Osney Abbey , and a chapel was erected on the site around 1190 . From the mid @-@ 13th century the Osney area was referred to as the parish of St Thomas ' , but it remained nominally a chapel of the abbey until the dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII , when it was placed under Christ Church , Oxford . Christ Church treated it as a conventional parish church with a curate , and from the mid @-@ 19th century the incumbent was styled a vicar . 
 After the curacy was placed under the patronage of Christ Church , the incumbents were mostly scholars or members of the college ; from 1616 to 1640 the curacy was held by Robert Burton , author of The Anatomy of Melancholy , who enlarged the church . In the English Civil War the medieval stained glass in the church was destroyed , partly due to the vandalism of Parliamentarian troops captured at Cirencester in 1642 and imprisoned in the church . Following the Restoration the holders of the curacy changed rapidly , often remaining in the position for only a few years at a time . From at least 1713 Christ Church leased a house in High Street to parish trustees and the profits were used for repairing the church . This continued until 1923 , when the house was sold . 
 = = = 19th and 20th centuries = = = 
 By the early 19th century , the church and its parish were showing signs of neglect . In 1802 only ten communicants are recorded , and in 1814 some 90 % of the parish was thought to be non @-@ churchgoing . The church was further reduced by the creation of the parishes of St Paul 's in 1837 , St Barnabas ' in 1869 , and St Frideswide 's in 1873 . 
 The curate from 1823 to 1842 , one John Jones , brought a significant turnaround in attendance ; perhaps the most unusual innovation was a houseboat – the " <unk> ' Floating Chapel " – acquired in 1839 , for use as a chapel serving the families working on the river and the Oxford Canal . This boat was St Thomas ' first chapel of ease ; it was donated by H. Ward , a local coal merchant , and used until it sank in 1868 . It was replaced by a chapel dedicated to St Nicholas that remained in use until 1892 . A second chapel was built in 1860 , dedicated to St Frideswide , later replaced by the new parish church of St Frideswide 's , which took on the parish of New Osney in 1873 . 
 Major repairs were carried out beginning in 1825 . The floor @-@ level was raised above flood @-@ level , a full three feet . The roof was rebuilt , the south wall was rebuilt using the original materials , and the main features of the 12th @-@ century chancel arch were discarded . 
 The vicar from 1842 to 1892 was Thomas Chamberlain ( later founder of St Edward 's School ) , a firm believer in the Tractarian movement , who introduced daily services as well as such <unk> practices as altar candles and the wearing of Eucharistic vestments – the latter causing him to be rebuked by Bishop Wilberforce in 1855 . Many of the leaders of the Oxford Movement , including Edward Bouverie Pusey , Henry Parry Liddon , John Mason Neale , Charles <unk> Lowder and Edward King preached at the church . In the early days of the movement , Anglo @-@ Catholicism was closely associated with St Thomas ' . In 1847 Chamberlain founded the Community of St Thomas Martyr , which was devoted to the assistance of the poor of the parish , by now heavily <unk> ; this sisterhood remained active until 1958 . The convent buildings for it were built in 1886 , but have since been demolished . In 1846 the north aisle and vestry were demolished and a new aisle of five bays with a vestry at its west end was built in its place . The blocked tower arch and two blocked windows in the chancel were opened and a new chancel arch was built . 
 The vicar from 1896 to 1908 was T.H. Birley , later Bishop of Zanzibar . In 1897 the building was again re @-@ roofed and a vestry built against the north wall of the tower . St Thomas ' was declared an ancient parish in 1948 . 
 In 1994 the Church of England introduced women priests . Like several other parishes , the people of St Thomas ' decided not to accept the Ordination of women . Under the terms of the resolutions passed by General Synod , the Archbishop of Canterbury placed the church under the care of the Bishop of Ebbsfleet . He is a Provincial episcopal visitor who oversees the parish even though it is in the Diocese of Oxford . At present , the congregation maintains Anglo @-@ Catholic traditions . The building has been added to the English Heritage ' Heritage at Risk ' register . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The church has a nave with a north aisle and vestry , a Perpendicular Gothic west tower , a chancel and a south porch . The nave was rebuilt in the late 15th or early 16th century to meet a tower of approximately the same age ; it is often dated to 1521 , but appears to be built on older foundations . The southern side of the nave contains what are probably thirteenth @-@ century buttresses and a pair of Perpendicular Gothic windows . The north aisle was originally built in the 13th century , and rebuilt by H.J. Underwood in 1890 ; the vestry was built in the 17th century and rebuilt in 1846 to designs by Chamberlain , through the generosity of the curate , Alexander Penrose Forbes . The church has been reroofed at least twice , in 1825 and 1897 . 
 The chancel , which has a ceiling decorated by C. E. Kempe , has three windows in the style of the late 12th century , and a priest 's door built into the south side circa 1250 . A south porch was built in 1621 at the behest of Dr Robert Burton , whose arms are carved in the gable above the date . A candelabrum given by Ann Kendall in 1705 hangs in the chancel . The chancel ceiling was decorated with a pattern of gold stars on a blue background in 1914 . Two years later , an altar was erected at the east end of the north aisle , and an aumbry placed in the north wall of the chancel . The royal arms of William IV are displayed in the tower . 
 St Thomas ' church has been a Grade II listed building since 1954 . 
 The churchyard contains Combe House , a 1702 building originally built as a school , as well as a vicarage designed in 1893 by C. C. Rolfe . The remains of an earlier Rolfe building , the 1886 Sisterhood of St Thomas , are also present ; in 1974 , these amounted to a single cottage and a sculptured brick gateway . 
 = James Bond in film = 
 The James Bond film series is a British series of spy films based on the fictional character of MI6 agent James Bond , " 007 " , who originally appeared in a series of books by Ian Fleming . It is one of the longest continually @-@ running film series in history , having been in on @-@ going production from 1962 to the present ( with a six @-@ year hiatus between 1989 and 1995 ) . In that time Eon Productions has produced 24 films , most of them at Pinewood Studios . With a combined gross of over $ 7 billion to date , the films produced by Eon constitute the third @-@ highest @-@ grossing film series , behind the Harry Potter and Marvel Cinematic Universe films ( accounting for the effects of inflation the Bond films are the highest @-@ grossing series amassing over $ 13 billion at 2011 / 2012 prices ) . Six actors have portrayed 007 in the Eon series , the latest being Daniel Craig . 
 Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman co @-@ produced most of the Eon films until 1975 , when Broccoli became the sole producer . The single exception during this period was Thunderball , on which Broccoli and Saltzman became executive producers while Kevin McClory produced . From 1984 to 1989 Broccoli was joined by his stepson Michael G. Wilson as producer until 1995 , when Albert Broccoli stepped aside from Eon and was replaced by his daughter Barbara , who has co @-@ produced with Wilson since . Broccoli 's ( and until 1975 , Saltzman 's ) family company , Danjaq , has held ownership of the series through Eon , and maintained co @-@ ownership with United Artists since the mid @-@ 1970s . The Eon series has seen continuity both in the main actors and in the production crews , with directors , writers , composers , production designers , and others employed through a number of films . 
 From the release of Dr. No ( 1962 ) to For Your Eyes Only ( 1981 ) , the films were distributed solely by United Artists . When Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer absorbed United Artists in 1981 , MGM / UA Entertainment Co. was formed and distributed the films until 1995 . MGM solely distributed three films from 1997 to 2002 after United Artists was retired as a mainstream studio . From 2006 to present , MGM and Columbia Pictures have co @-@ distributed the film series , following the 2005 acquisition of MGM by a consortium led by Columbia 's parent company , Sony Pictures Entertainment . In November 2010 ; MGM filed for bankruptcy ; following its emergence from insolvency , Columbia has been co @-@ production partner of the series with Danjaq until Sony 's distribution rights to the franchise comes to the end with the release of Spectre . 
 Independently of the Eon series , there have been three additional productions with the character of James Bond : a 1954 American television adaptation , Casino Royale , produced by CBS ; a 1967 spoof , Casino Royale , produced by Charles K. Feldman ; and a 1983 remake of Thunderball entitled Never Say Never Again , produced by Jack Schwartzman , who had obtained the rights to the film from McClory .

It was adapted for the screen by Anthony Ellis and Charles Bennett ; Bennett was well known for his collaborations with Alfred Hitchcock , including The 39 Steps and Sabotage . Due to the restriction of a one @-@ hour play , the adapted version lost many of the details found in the book , although it retained its violence , particularly in Act III . The hour @-@ long " Casino Royale " episode , which starred American actor Barry Nelson as Bond and Peter Lorre as the villain Le Chiffre , aired on 21 October 1954 as a live production .

 In 1959 producer Albert R. " Cubby " Broccoli at Warwick Films expressed interest in adapting the Bond novels , but his colleague Irving Allen was unenthusiastic . In June 1961 Fleming sold a six @-@ month option on the film rights to his published and future James Bond novels and short stories to Harry Saltzman , with the exception of Casino Royale , which he had previously sold . Towards the end of Saltzman 's option period , screenwriter Wolf Mankowitz introduced him to Broccoli , and Saltzman and Broccoli formed Eon Productions with the intention of making the first Bond film . A number of Hollywood studios did not want to fund the films , finding them " too British " or " too blatantly sexual " . Eventually the two signed a deal with United Artists for 100 per cent financial backing and distribution of seven films , with financing of $ 1 million for the first feature . Saltzman and Broccoli also created the company Danjaq , which was to hold the rights to the films which Eon Productions was to produce . 
 Eon had originally intended to film Fleming 's novel Thunderball first , but Kevin McClory took Fleming to the High Court in London for breach of copyright over the book , and so Eon decided to film Dr. No first . 
 = = = = = Dr. No ( 1962 ) = = = = = 
 Eon asked several directors — Bryan Forbes , Guy Green , Val Guest and Guy Hamilton — to helm the film , but all declined , before Terence Young agreed . Eon had originally hired Wolf Mankowitz and Richard Maibaum to write Dr. No 's screenplay , partly because of Mankowitz 's help in brokering the deal between Broccoli and Saltzman . An initial draft of the screenplay was rejected because the scriptwriters had made the villain , Dr. No , a monkey , and Mankowitz left the film . Maibaum then undertook a second version , more closely in line with the novel ; Johanna Harwood and Berkely Mather then worked on Maibaum 's script , with Harwood in particular being described as a script doctor credited with improving the British characterisations . 
 To play the lead role of Bond , Sean Connery was not Broccoli or Fleming 's first choice , but he was selected after Patrick McGoohan had turned down the role , and Eon had rejected Richard Johnson . After Connery was chosen , Terence Young took the actor to his tailor and hairdresser and introduced him to the high life , restaurants , casinos and women of London . In the words of Bond writer Raymond Benson , Young educated the actor " in the ways of being dapper , witty , and above all , cool " . 
 Filming took place on location in Jamaica between 16 January and 21 February 1962 ; five days later filming began at Pinewood Studios in England with sets designed by Ken Adam , who had previously worked with Broccoli on the 1960 film The Trials of Oscar Wilde . Maurice Binder created the title sequence and introduced the gun barrel motif that appears in all the Eon Bond films . Monty Norman wrote the accompanying soundtrack , which included the " James Bond Theme " , heard in the gun barrel sequence and in a calypso medley over the title credits ; the theme was described by another Bond film composer , David Arnold , as " bebop @-@ swing vibe coupled with that vicious , dark , distorted electric guitar , definitely an instrument of rock ' n ' roll ... it represented everything about the character you would want : It was cocky , swaggering , confident , dark , dangerous , suggestive , sexy , unstoppable . And he did it in two minutes " . The theme was arranged by John Barry , who was uncredited for the arrangement but credited for his performance . 
 = = = = = From Russia with Love ( 1963 ) = = = = = 
 After the financial success of Dr. No , United Artists doubled the budget offered to Eon Productions to $ 2 million for the company 's next film , From Russia with Love . The film was shot in locations in Europe , which had turned out to be the more profitable market for Dr. No . Most of the crew from the first film returned , with major exceptions being production designer Ken Adam — who went to work on Dr. Strangelove and was replaced by Dr. No 's art director Syd Cain — and title designer Maurice Binder , who was replaced by Robert Brownjohn . 
 The original screenwriter for the film was Len Deighton , but he was replaced because of his slow progress . Two of the writers from Dr. No , Richard Maibaum and Johanna Harwood , were brought in , with Maibaum being given the sole writing credit and Harwood being credited for " adaptation " . From Russia with Love is the first Bond film in the series with John Barry as the primary soundtrack composer , although Lionel Bart wrote the title song " From Russia with Love " , sung by Matt Monro . Principal photography began on 1 April 1963 and concluded on 23 August . Filming took place in Turkey , Pinewood Studios and Venice , with Scotland and Switzerland doubling for the Orient Express journey through Eastern Europe . 
 = = = = = Goldfinger ( 1964 ) = = = = = 
 While the previous two films had concentrated on the Caribbean and Europe , Goldfinger was chosen by Eon for the third film , with the American cinema market in mind . Because Terence Young was refused a share of the profits , he declined to direct Goldfinger and worked on The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders instead , although he had done some pre @-@ production work before he left . In his place , Eon turned to Guy Hamilton to direct ; he was keen to inject elements of humour into the series , have more gadgets and build bigger and more elegant sets . 
 Eon again turned to Richard Maibaum for the script , although Paul Dehn was later introduced for rewrites . After missing From Russia with Love , Ken Adam returned as production designer . Adam 's imagination provided the idea of gold stacked upon gold behind iron bars for the scenes in the United States Bullion Depository . Saltzman disliked the design 's resemblance to a prison , but Hamilton liked it enough that it was built . 
 Robert Brownjohn returned to develop the opening credit sequence , which featured clips of all three Bond films projected on actress Margaret Nolan 's body . Its design was inspired by seeing light projecting on people 's bodies as they got up and left a cinema . Principal photography on Goldfinger started on 20 January 1964 in Miami , at the Fontainebleau Hotel ; the crew was small , consisting only of Hamilton , Broccoli , Adam and cinematographer Ted Moore . After five days in Florida , production moved to England . The primary location was Pinewood Studios , home to sets including a recreation of the Fontainebleau , the South American city of the pre @-@ title sequence , and both Goldfinger 's estate and factory . Ian Fleming visited the set of Goldfinger in April 1964 ; he died in August , shortly before the film 's release . The second unit filmed in Kentucky , and these shots were edited into scenes filmed at Pinewood . Principal photography then moved to Switzerland for the car chase and additional footage for Goldfinger 's factory sequence . Filming wrapped on 11 July at Andermatt , after nineteen weeks of shooting . 
 = = = = Kevin McClory ( 1965 ) = = = = 
 When writing his novels , Ian Fleming had always considered that they could be adapted for the cinema , and he approached producer Sir Alexander Korda to make a film adaptation of either Live and Let Die or Moonraker . Although Korda was initially interested , he later withdrew . On 1 October 1959 , it was announced that Fleming would write an original film script featuring Bond for producer Kevin McClory . Jack Whittingham also worked on the script , culminating in a screenplay entitled James Bond , Secret Agent . However , Alfred Hitchcock and Richard Burton turned down roles as director and star , respectively . McClory was unable to secure the financing for the film , and the deal fell through . Fleming subsequently used the story for his novel Thunderball ( 1961 ) , and McClory failed to have its publication stopped . On 19 November 1963 he took the matter to the Chancery Division of the High Court in the case of McClory v Fleming , but settled on 9 December 1963 , after nine days in court . McClory gained the literary and film rights for the screenplay , while Fleming was given the rights to the novel , although it had to be recognised as being " based on a screen treatment by Kevin McClory , Jack Whittingham and the Author " . 
 = = = = = Thunderball ( 1965 ) = = = = = 
 After From Russia with Love , Eon had considered undertaking an adaptation of either On Her Majesty 's Secret Service or Casino Royale . They entered into negotiations with Charles K. Feldman , who held the rights to the latter , but a deal proved too difficult to achieve . Instead , Eon turned to the Thunderball novel . Although Eon had wanted to adapt the book in 1962 , it had not been possible until the legal obstacles had been cleared . As a result of the settlement of the copyright infringement lawsuit brought by Kevin McClory , Eon negotiated with McClory to make Thunderball . McClory received the sole producer credit on the film , while Broccoli and Saltzman took the title Executive Producer , although " in reality all three men would essentially act as producers " . Broccoli later said of the three @-@ way partnership that " We didn 't want anyone else to make Thunderball ... We had the feeling that if anyone else came in and made their own Bond film , it would have been bad for our series " . 
 Guy Hamilton was asked to direct again , but declined feeling that he was " drained of ideas ... I had nothing to contribute until I 'd recharged batteries " ; Terence Young returned to direct after the hiatus of Goldfinger . Richard Maibaum 's original script from 1961 was used as the basis of the script , which he then re @-@ drafted , with further revisions by John Hopkins . Principal filming began in Paris on 16 February 1965 , and moved to Nassau on 22 March , before concluding at Pinewood Studios in May . 
 With worldwide box office earnings of $ 141 @.@ 2 million Thunderball became the highest @-@ grossing instalment and retained the record until it was surpassed by The Spy Who Loved Me twelve years later ; adjusted for inflation it remained the most successful entry until Skyfall was released in 2012 . As part of the contract with Eon , McClory received 20 % of the film 's profits and undertook not to produce any other films based on the Thunderball story for a period of ten years following the release of the Eon @-@ produced version in 1965 . 
 = = = = Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman ( 1967 – 75 ) = = = = 
 = = = = = You Only Live Twice ( 1967 ) = = = = = 
 After the interruption of McClory as producer , Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman returned to produce once again . The first four Bond films had been popular in Japan , and Eon decided to take advantage of the market by producing You Only Live Twice . The film included progressive elements of Japanese culture as part of the background . 
 Lewis Gilbert was appointed director and Ken Adam returned as production designer ; Adam built a volcano hideaway set for the main antagonist , Ernst Stavro Blofeld , at Pinewood for $ 1 <unk> ( $ 7 @,@ 096 @,@ 806 in 2016 dollars ) ; at the time it was the biggest film set in Europe . Gilbert , Broccoli , Saltzman , Ken Adam and director of photography Freddie Young then went to Japan , spending three weeks searching for locations . While in Tokyo , the crew crossed paths with Peter R. Hunt , who was on holiday . Hunt had edited the first four Bond films , and he was invited to direct the second unit . The total budget for the film was $ 10 @.@ 3 million ( $ 59 @.@ 9 million in 2005 dollars ) . 
 Initially the screenwriter was to be Harold Jack Bloom , although he was later replaced by Roald Dahl , who had little previous screenwriting experience . You Only Live Twice was the first Bond film to jettison the plot premise of the Fleming source material , although the film retains the title , the Japanese setting , the use of Blofeld as the main villain and a Bond girl named Kissy Suzuki from the novel . 
 Filming commenced at Pinewood on 4 July 1966 before moving out to Japan on 27 July for six weeks ' filming . Local Japanese interest in the filming was high , and the crew had to contend with large crowds throughout the process . Connery , however , was somewhat resigned to the project , lacking the enthusiasm he sported for Thunderball . A press conference on his arrival had been tense , " soured by aggressive questioning of Connery 's crumpled , jet @-@ lagged appearance " . Primary and secondary photography finished in December ; the special effects filming for the space scenes were undertaken between January and March 1967 , prior to the film 's release on 12 June . 
 The cinema posters for the film stated " Sean Connery IS James Bond " , to distance the Eon @-@ produced picture from the independent Casino Royale , which had been released two months earlier . However , during the production , Connery announced that it would be his last film as Bond , leaving Broccoli to tell Alan <unk> , " it won 't be the last Bond under any circumstances — with all due respect to Sean , who I think has been certainly the best man to play this part . We will , in our own way , try to continue the Bond series for the audience because it 's too important " . 
 = = = = = On Her Majesty 's Secret Service ( 1969 ) = = = = = 
 George Lazenby was signed on to play Bond for OHMSS . Between Sean Connery giving his notice at the beginning of filming You Only Live Twice and its release , Saltzman had planned to adapt The Man with the Golden Gun in Cambodia and use Roger Moore as the next Bond , but political instability meant the location was ruled out and Moore signed up for another series of the television programme The Saint . After You Only Live Twice was released in 1967 , the producers once again picked the often @-@ delayed On Her Majesty 's Secret Service , which had previously been considered to follow both Goldfinger and then Thunderball . 
 Peter Hunt , who had worked on the five preceding films had impressed Broccoli and Saltzman enough to earn his directorial debut as they believed his quick cutting had set the style for the series ; it was also the result of a long @-@ standing promise from Broccoli and Saltzman for the opportunity to direct . Hunt also asked for the position during the production of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang , and he brought along with him many crew members , including cinematographer Michael Reed . Hunt was focused on putting his mark , saying , " I wanted it to be different than any other Bond film would be . It was my film , not anyone else 's " . On Her Majesty 's Secret Service was the last film on which Hunt worked in the series . 
 Screenwriter Richard Maibaum , who worked on the first four Bond films , returned as script writer . Saltzman and Broccoli decided to drop the science fiction gadgets from the earlier films and focus more on plot as in From Russia With Love . Peter Hunt asked Simon Raven to write some of the dialogue between Contessa Teresa " Tracy " di Vicenzo and Blofeld in Piz Gloria , which was to be " sharper , better and more intellectual " ; Raven 's additions included rewriting the proposal scene and having Tracy quote James Elroy Flecker . Syd Cain took over from Ken Adam as production designer as Eon decided not to have Adam 's larger sets to reduce the film 's budget to $ 7 million , from the $ 10 @.@ 3 million it took to make You Only Live Twice . 
 Principal photography began in the Canton of Bern , Switzerland , on 21 October 1968 , with the first scene shot being an aerial view of Bond climbing the stairs of Blofeld 's mountain retreat . The scenes were shot atop the now @-@ famous revolving restaurant Piz Gloria , located atop the Schilthorn near the village of Mürren . The location was found by production manager Hubert Fröhlich after three weeks of location scouting in France and Switzerland . The Swiss filming ended up running 56 days over schedule . In March 1969 production moved to England , with London 's Pinewood Studios being used for interior shooting , and M 's house being shot in Marlow , Buckinghamshire . In April the filmmakers went to Portugal , where principal photography wrapped in May . Filming finished on 23 June , two months later than planned , which was largely due to the warm Swiss winter , which had hampered shooting . 
 Midway through production , acting on advice from his agent Ronan O 'Rahilly , George Lazenby announced that he was not going to continue as Bond in future films , and he left the role before the December 1969 release of On Her Majesty 's Secret Service . 
 = = = = = Diamonds Are Forever ( 1971 ) = = = = = 
 Although Eon secured the services of John Gavin to play the role of Bond , United Artists ' chief David Picker was unhappy with this decision and instructed associate producer Stanley Sopel to broker a deal with Connery which saw the actor being paid $ 1 @.@ 25 million ( $ 9 million in 2016 dollars ) and 12 @.@ 5 % of the gross . Connery 's salary took a significant part of the $ 7 @.@ 2 million budget . 
 The producers had originally intended to have Diamonds Are Forever re @-@ create commercially successful aspects of Goldfinger , so they hired director Guy Hamilton as a result . Richard Maibaum also returned to write the script ; the first draft envisaged the return of Auric Goldfinger portrayer Gert Fröbe , this time in the role of Goldfinger 's twin brother . Maibaum also wrote a climax to the film that consisted of the new Goldfinger being chased across Lake Mead by the people of Las Vegas , all being co @-@ ordinated by Bond . In the autumn of 1970 Tom Mankiewicz was hired to undertake re @-@ writes , which included removing Goldfinger 's brother and the Lake Mead finale . 
 Filming began on 5 April 1971 with the desert near Las Vegas doubling for the South African scenes , followed by filming in the Great Basin Desert , Nevada in May for scenes in which Bond drives a moon buggy . On 7 June production moved to Pinewood Studios for filming at sets of the returning Ken Adams ; his sets spread through four of Pinewood 's stages . Filming also took place in London , Dover , Southampton , Amsterdam and the south of France ; principal photography finished 13 August 1971 . 
 = = = = = Live and Let Die ( 1973 ) = = = = = 
 While filming Diamonds Are Forever , Live and Let Die was chosen as the next Ian Fleming novel to be adapted because screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz thought it would be daring to use black villains , as the Black Panthers and other racial movements were active at that time . The new Bond actor selected by Eon was Roger Moore , and he tried not to imitate either his predecessor Sean Connery or his own performance as Simon Templar in The Saint ; Mankiewicz adapted the screenplay to emphasise Moore 's persona by giving him more comedy scenes and creating a light @-@ hearted feel to Bond . Guy Hamilton was again chosen to direct , and Mankiewicz suggested they film in New Orleans , as he knew Hamilton was a jazz fan . Hamilton didn 't want to use Mardi Gras , as Thunderball featured Junkanoo , a similar festival , so after more discussions with the writer and further scouting , he decided to use two well @-@ known features of the city , the jazz funerals and the canals . While searching for locations in Jamaica , the crew discovered a crocodile farm owned by Ross Kananga , after passing a sign warning that " trespassers will be eaten " . The farm was put into the script and also inspired Mankiewicz to name the film 's villain after Kananga . With the rise of the popularity of Blaxploitation films in the early 1970s , it was decided to borrow elements of the genre for Live and Let Die . 
 Syd Cain returned as art director and was involved searching for locations with Guy Hamilton in March 1972 . Principal photography began on 13 October 1972 in the Irish Bayou in Louisiana for a boat chase scene . On 29 November production moved to Jamaica , which doubled for the fictional island San Monique , the home of antagonist Kananga . In December , production was divided between interiors in Pinewood Studios , while a separate unit also shot in Harlem . 
 John Barry , who had worked on the previous five films , was unavailable during production . Broccoli and Saltzman instead asked Paul McCartney to write the theme song . Since McCartney 's salary of $ 15 @,@ 000 ( plus royalties ) was high and another composer of Barry 's stature could not be hired with the remainder of the music budget , George Martin , who had little experience of film scoring , was hired . 
 = = = = = The Man with the Golden Gun ( 1974 ) = = = = = 
 The film of The Man with the Golden Gun saw a change in location from the novel of the same name to put Bond in the Far East for the second time . After considering Beirut , where part of the film is set ; Iran , where the location scouting was done but eventually discarded because of the Yom Kippur War ; and the Hạ Long Bay in Vietnam , the production team chose Thailand as a primary location , following a suggestion of production designer Peter Murton after he saw pictures of the Phuket bay in a magazine . Saltzman was happy with the choice of the Far East for the setting as he had always wanted to go on location in Thailand and Hong Kong . During the reconnaissance of locations in Hong Kong , Broccoli saw the partially submerged wreckage of the former RMS Queen Elizabeth and came up with the idea of using it as the base for MI6 's Far East operations . 
 Tom Mankiewicz wrote a first draft for the script in 1973 , delivering a script that was a battle of wills between Bond and the primary villain Francisco Scaramanga , whom he saw as Bond 's alter ego , " a super @-@ villain of the stature of Bond himself " . Tensions between Mankiewicz and Guy Hamilton led to Richard Maibaum taking over scripting duties . Maibaum , who had worked on six Bond films previously , delivered his own draft based on Mankiewicz 's work . Broccoli 's stepson Michael G. Wilson researched solar power to create the MacGuffin of the " Solex Agitator " . While Live and Let Die had borrowed heavily from the blaxploitation genre , The Man with the Golden Gun borrowed from the martial arts genre that was popular in the 1970s . 
 On 6 November 1973 filming commenced at the RMS Queen Elizabeth , which acted as a top @-@ secret MI6 base grounded in Victoria Harbour in Hong Kong . The major part of principal photography started in April 1974 in Thailand . Thai locations included Bangkok , Thonburi , Phuket and the nearby Phang Nga Province , on the islands of Ko Khao Phing Kan ( Thai : <unk> ) and Ko Tapu ( Thai : เกาะตะปู ) . In late April production returned to Hong Kong and also shot in Macau . Production had to move to studio work in Pinewood Studios — which included sets such as Scaramanga 's solar energy plant and island interior . 
 John Barry returned to compose the score , but had only three weeks to complete the work , and the theme tune and score are generally considered by critics to be among the weakest of Barry 's contributions to the series — an opinion shared by Barry himself : " It 's the one I hate most ... it just never happened for me " . 
 = = = = Albert R. Broccoli ( 1975 – 84 ) = = = = 
 Following The Man with the Golden Gun , producer Harry Saltzman sold his 50 % stake in Eon Productions ' parent company , Danjaq , to United Artists to alleviate his financial problems , brought about by financial constraints following a downturn in the fortunes of Technicolor , in which he had invested heavily . The resulting legalities over the Bond property delayed production of the next Bond film , The Spy Who Loved Me . 
 = = = = = The Spy Who Loved Me ( 1977 ) = = = = = 
 Guy Hamilton was initially scheduled to follow on from The Man with the Golden Gun with The Spy Who Loved Me , but instead turned down Eon Productions during pre @-@ production after being offered the opportunity to direct the 1978 film Superman , although he was ultimately passed up for Richard Donner . Eon then turned to Lewis Gilbert , who had directed the earlier Bond film You Only Live Twice . Broccoli commissioned a number of writers to work on the script , including Stirling Silliphant , John Landis , Ronald Hardy , Anthony Burgess and Derek Marlowe , but Richard Maibaum drew up the first draft script , with some inclusions from the previous writers . When Lewis Gilbert was hired to direct , he brought with him Christopher Wood to revise Maibaum 's draft . The draft Wood prepared was challenged in court by Kevin McClory , who alleged infringement based on the use of what he claimed were his rights in SPECTRE and the Blofeld character . Eon disputed McClory 's claim but had Wood remove the organisation and character from the script . 
 Ken Adam returned as production designer . As no studio stages were big enough for the interior of the villain Karl Stromberg 's supertanker , in March 1976 construction began of a new sound stage at Pinewood , the 007 Stage , which cost $ 1 @.@ 8 million and became the largest stage in the world . In contrast to the volcano crater set Adam had built for You Only Live Twice in 1966 — which Adam had called " a workable but ultimately wasteful set " — the 007 Stage would be a permanent structure that could be rented out to other productions . Secondary filming began in July 1976 at Baffin Island , where the ski jump for the opening credits was filmed . Principal filming commenced in Sardinia in August 1976 , moving on to Egypt shortly afterwards . Further filming took place in Sardinia , Malta , Japan , Switzerland and the Faslane submarine base . On 5 December 1976 , with principal photography finished , the 007 Stage was formally opened by the former Prime Minister Harold Wilson . 
 John Barry could not work in the United Kingdom due to tax problems and suggested Marvin Hamlisch to score the film . Hamlisch composed " Nobody Does It Better " as the theme song ; the score and the song were both nominated for Academy and Golden Globe Awards . 
 = = = = = Moonraker ( 1979 ) = = = = = 
 Eon Productions had originally planned to follow The Spy Who Loved Me with an adaptation of For Your Eyes Only , although this plan changed within weeks of the 1977 release , following the box office success of the 1977 space @-@ themed film Star Wars . With a budget of $ 34 million Moonraker cost more than double any of the previous Bond films , although both Broccoli and United Artists agreed to the costs because of the profits from The Spy Who Loved Me . 
 Lewis Gilbert was again appointed as director , and a number of the crew from The Spy Who Loved Me also joined the production . Gilbert and Tom Mankiewicz wrote the initial story , but Christopher Wood turned this into the final screenplay . Many of the script ideas came about as a result of location scouting , with Iguazu Falls being identified as a filming location while Broccoli was in Brazil for the release of The Spy Who Loved Me . 
 Unlike previous Bond films , the production of Moonraker was not based at Pinewood , as Broccoli moved it to Paris for financial reasons , although the scenes for the cable car interiors and space battle exteriors were filmed at Pinewood , with the special effects team of Derek Meddings active in the UK throughout production . Principal photography began on 11 August 1978 in Paris . The sets designed by returning production designer Ken Adam were the largest ever constructed in France and required more than 222 @,@ 000 man @-@ hours to construct ( approximately 1 @,@ 000 hours by each of the crew on average ) . Much of the film was shot in the cities of London , Paris , Venice , Palmdale , California , Port St. Lucie , Florida and Rio de Janeiro . Principal filming finished back in Paris on 27 February 1979 , a 28 @-@ week schedule that had allowed Roger Moore only three days off . John Barry was again asked to score an Eon film . 
 = = = = = For Your Eyes Only ( 1981 ) = = = = = 
 For Your Eyes Only marked a change in the production crew : John Glen was promoted from his duties as a film editor to director , a position he would occupy for the next four films . Since Ken Adam was busy with the film Pennies from Heaven , Peter Lamont , who had worked in the art department since Goldfinger , was promoted to production designer . Following a suggestion from Glen , Lamont created realistic sets , instead of the elaborate scenery for which the series had been known . 
 Richard Maibaum was once again the scriptwriter for the story , assisted by Michael G. Wilson . According to Wilson , the ideas could have come from anyone as a committee that could include Broccoli , Maibaum , Wilson , Glen and stunt coordinators worked on the outlines . Much of the inspiration for the stories for the film came from two Fleming short stories from the collection For Your Eyes Only : " Risico " and " For Your Eyes Only " . Another set @-@ piece from the novel of Live and Let Die — the <unk> — which was unused in that novel 's adaptation , was inserted into the plot . 
 Production of For Your Eyes Only began on 2 September 1980 in the North Sea , with three days shooting exterior scenes for the scenes involving the St Georges <unk> . The interiors were shot later in Pinewood Studios , as well as the ship 's explosion , which was done with a miniature in Pinewood 's tank on the 007 Stage . On 15 September principal photography started in Corfu at the Villa Sylva at <unk> , above Corfu Town , which acted as the location of the Spanish villa . 
 In October filming moved to other Greek locations , including Meteora and the <unk> . In November the main unit moved to England , which included interior work in Pinewood , while the second unit shot underwater scenes in the Bahamas . On 1 January 1981 production moved to Cortina d 'Ampezzo in Italy , where filming wrapped in February . Many of the underwater scenes , especially involving close @-@ ups of Bond and Melina , were shot on a dry soundstage . A combination of lighting effects , slow @-@ motion photography , wind , and bubbles added in post @-@ production , gave the illusion of the actors being underwater . The pre @-@ credits sequence used a church in Stoke Poges as a cemetery , while scenes involving a helicopter were filmed at the abandoned Beckton Gas Works in London . 
 The score of For Your Eyes Only was written by Bill Conti , who retained a number of John Barry @-@ influenced brass elements in the score but also added elements of dance and funk music . 
 = = = = = Octopussy ( 1983 ) = = = = = 
 In 1980 United Artists , which had provided much of the funding for the Bond films , fell into financial difficulties following the box office failure of Heaven 's Gate ( 1980 ) , bringing uncertainty to the future of the funding . The situation was resolved in May 1981 , when Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer acquired United Artists . 
 Following For Your Eyes Only , Roger Moore had expressed a desire to stop playing James Bond . His original contract had been for three films , a requirement fulfilled with The Spy Who Loved Me . Subsequent films had been negotiated on a film @-@ by @-@ film basis . The producers engaged in a semi @-@ public quest for the next actor to play Bond , which would be for Octopussy . However , when Kevin McClory announced his re @-@ working of Thunderball as Never Say Never Again , the producers re @-@ contracted Moore in the belief that an established actor in the role would fare better against McClory 's choice of Bond , Sean Connery . Before For Your Eyes Only had been released , Albert Broccoli had asked John Glen to return and direct Octopussy . George MacDonald Fraser wrote an initial treatment that was extensively revised by Michael G. Wilson and Richard Maibaum . 
 First unit filming began on 10 August 1982 at the Berlin Wall crossing point Checkpoint Charlie , although the second unit had already been at work for a few weeks , filming scenes for a mid @-@ air fight sequence . The Monsoon Palace served as the exterior of villain Kamal Khan 's palace , while scenes set at the palace of titular character Octopussy were filmed at the Lake Palace and Jag Mandir . Bond 's hotel was the Shiv Niwas Palace . In England RAF Northolt , RAF Upper Heyford and RAF Oakley were the main locations . Scenes set at the Karl @-@ Marx @-@ Stadt railways scenes were shot at the Nene Valley Railway , while studio work was undertaken at Pinewood Studios and 007 Stage . Filming finished on 21 January 1983 . John Barry returned to score , having passed on For Your Eyes Only for tax reasons . While Barry wrote the title song , " All Time High " , Tim Rice wrote the lyrics and the song was performed by Rita Coolidge . 
 Octopussy had its premiere on 6 June 1983 , four months before the October release of Never Say Never Again . From its budget of $ 27 @.@ 5 million , Octopussy took $ 183 @.@ 7 million at the box office , a figure which saw it surpass the takings of its Connery @-@ led rival , which took $ 160 million . 
 = = = = Albert R. Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson ( 1984 – 89 ) = = = = 
 In 1984 Michael G Wilson joined Albert R Broccoli as co @-@ producer at Eon . Wilson had first worked on a Bond production in February 1964 with the filming of Goldfinger . He had worked on every production since The Spy Who Loved Me , and had been executive producer on Moonraker , For Your Eyes Only and Octopussy . 
 = = = = = A View to a Kill ( 1985 ) = = = = = 
 The day before the UK premiere of the non @-@ Eon rival Bond film , Never Say Never Again , Eon announced that Roger Moore would return as Bond for the seventh time . John Glen also returned as director , while Peter Lamont and John Barry also signed up as they had for Octopussy . Michael G. Wilson co @-@ wrote the screenplay with Richard Maibaum . 
 On 27 June 1984 the 007 Stage was almost entirely destroyed by fire . It was rebuilt in time for production and reopened in January 1985 , when it was renamed the " Albert Broccoli 007 Stage " . The second unit started filming in Iceland in July 1984 , while principal photography with Moore commenced on 1 August at Pinewood . Also in August , the second unit filmed in Paris , including scenes involving a parachute jump from the Eiffel Tower . 
 The Amberley Museum & Heritage Centre doubled as the exterior of villain Max Zorin 's mine , while the scenes in the complex under Zorin 's stables were filmed in a Renault plant off the M4 , before primary filming moved to San Francisco . Filming finished in January 1985 at the 007 Stage , with the filming of the interior of Zorin 's mine , designed by Peter Lamont . 
 = = = = = The Living Daylights ( 1987 ) = = = = = 
 With the retirement of Roger Moore following A View to a Kill , the producers searched for a new Bond and eventually cast Timothy Dalton in the lead role in August 1986 . Much of the senior production crew from the previous film worked on The Living Daylights , with John Glen directing , John Barry providing the score and Peter Lamont acting as production designer . Michael G. Wilson and Richard Maibaum again provided the script and initially proposed a prequel , showing Bond 's first mission , although this was turned down by Broccoli . Script work continued while the producers searched for Moore 's successor . 
 The film was shot at the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios , with principal photography starting on 29 September 1986 , before moving to Vienna on 5 October , where the crew filmed for two weeks . Meanwhile , the second unit had started work on the pre @-@ credits sequence on Gibraltar on 17 September before moving to Morocco . Filming finished on 13 February 1987 . 
 The Living Daylights was the twelfth and final Bond film to be scored by composer John Barry . The title song of the film , " The Living Daylights " , was co @-@ written with Paul Waaktaar @-@ Savoy of the Norwegian pop @-@ music group A @-@ ha and recorded by them . The group and Barry did not collaborate well , resulting in two versions of the theme song . 
 The production costs of The Living Daylights were $ 40 million , and the film posted box office results of $ 191 @.@ 2 million .

 Shortly after the release of The Living Daylights , producers Albert R. Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson and writer Richard Maibaum started discussing its successor . They decided that the film would retain a realistic style , as well as showing the " darker edge " of the Bond character . For the primary location , the producers wanted a place where the series had not yet visited . While China was visited after an invitation by its government , the idea fell through partly because the 1987 film The Last Emperor had removed some of the novelty from filming in China . By this stage the writers had already talked about a chase sequence along the Great Wall , as well as a fight scene amongst the Terracotta Army . Wilson also wrote two plot outlines about a drug lord in the Golden Triangle before the plans fell through . The writers eventually decided on a setting in a tropical country while Broccoli negotiated to film in Mexico , at the Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City . In 1985 the Films Act was passed , removing the Eady Levy , which resulted in foreign artists being taxed more heavily . The associated rising costs to Eon Productions meant no part of Licence to Kill was filmed in the UK , the first Bond film not to do so . Pinewood Studios , used in every Bond film that far , housed only the post @-@ production and sound re @-@ recording . 
 The initial outline of what would become Licence to Kill was drawn up by Wilson and Maibaum . Before the pair could develop the script , the Writers Guild of America ( WGA ) went on strike and Maibaum was unable to continue writing , leaving Wilson to work on the script on his own . The script — initially called Licence Revoked — was written with Dalton 's characterisation of Bond in mind ; the obsession with which Bond pursues the drug lord villain Franz Sanchez on behalf of Bond 's friend , the CIA / DEA agent Felix Leiter and his dead wife is seen as being because of Bond 's own " brutally cut @-@ short marriage " . 
 John Glen returned once again to direct , teaming up once more with production designer Peter Lamont . Principal photography ran from 18 July to 18 November 1988 . Shooting began in Mexico , which mostly doubled for the fictional Republic of Isthmus . Other underwater sequences were shot at the Isla Mujeres near Cancún . In August 1988 production moved to the Florida Keys , notably Key West . Seven Mile Bridge towards Pigeon Key was used for the sequence in which the armoured truck transporting Sanchez following his arrest is driven off the edge . Other locations there included the Ernest Hemingway House , Key West International Airport , Mallory Square , St. Mary 's Star of the Sea Church for Leiter 's wedding and Stephano 's House 707 South Street for his house and patio . The US Coast Guard Pier was used to film Isthmus City harbour . 
 John Barry was not available to score the film because of throat surgery , so the soundtrack 's score was composed and conducted by Michael Kamen , who was known for scoring many action films at the time , such as Lethal Weapon and Die Hard . The film 's darker and more violent plot elicited calls for cuts by the British Board of Film Classification . 
 Licence to Kill marked the end of the involvement for a number of long @-@ term crew members , including John Glen , Maurice Binder , Richard Maibaum and cinematographer Alec Mills . It was also the final film which was produced by the partnership of Albert Broccoli and Michael Wilson . 
 = = = = Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli ( 1990 – present ) = = = = 
 The relatively disappointing box office returns for Licence to Kill led to Albert Broccoli questioning his own leadership of the series , and he put Danjaq , holders of the Bond film copyright , up for sale . Timothy Dalton was quoted at the time as saying " My feeling is this will be the last one . I don 't mean my last one , I mean the end of the whole lot . I don 't speak with any real authority , but it 's sort of a feeling I have " . 
 In 1990 the situation was further complicated when MGM / UA was sold to <unk> , which wanted to then merge with Pathé Communications ; the Bond back catalogue was leased to Pathé at a lower @-@ than @-@ market value , without consulting Danjaq - who sued MGM / UA Communications , which was itself the target of a failed takeover bid by Pathé . In August 1990 Albert Broccoli appointed his daughter Barbara Broccoli alongside Michael G. Wilson as producers at Eon , while he concentrated on matters at Danjaq . The dispute between Danjaq and MGM / UA was protracted and delayed production of Bond 17 , but was finally settled in 1993 . 
 The new producers changed the policy of behind @-@ the @-@ scenes continuity prevalent in the series up to that point and , from the 1990s onwards , there were more changes in key production roles , including employing directors " on a ' guest director ' footing " . 
 = = = = = GoldenEye ( 1995 ) = = = = = 
 Despite the legal action , pre @-@ production towards Bond 17 still progressed , with some early details unveiled at the Cannes Film Festival which took place in May 1990 . However , delays occurred because of the ongoing legal action with MGM / UA and , in an August 1993 interview , Dalton revealed that Michael France was involved in writing a script for the next Bond film , with Anthony Hopkins as a potential villain , adding that Hopkins had been in discussions with Eon for a number of weeks . Dalton also stated that the earliest production could begin would be in January or February 1994 . Dalton 's six @-@ year contract expired in 1993 , and after reading France 's script for what would become GoldenEye , he announced on 12 April 1994 that he would not be returning to play Bond ; he was replaced by Pierce Brosnan . After Michael France delivered the original screenplay , Jeffrey Caine was brought in to rework much of the material . Kevin Wade was also brought into the process before Bruce Feirstein gave the final polish to the script . 
 With Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson as co @-@ producers , Albert Broccoli oversaw the production of GoldenEye as consulting producer but is credited as " presenter " . John Woo was approached to direct the film , but he turned down the opportunity , saying he was honoured by the offer . The producers then chose Martin Campbell to lead the film . 
 Principal photography started on 16 January 1995 and continued until 6 June . The producers were unable to use Pinewood Studios , the usual location for Bond films , because it had been reserved for First Knight , so an old Rolls @-@ Royce factory at the Leavesden Aerodrome in Hertfordshire was converted into a new studio . In February the crew moved to Monaco and Monte Carlo for scenes in a casino and a demonstration of a Tiger helicopter . The pre @-@ credits sequence involved a bungee jump , which was filmed at the Contra Dam near Locarno , Switzerland . Reference footage for a scene consisting of a tank chase was shot on location in St. Petersburg and matched to sets built at the Leavesden studio by production designer Peter Lamont . Scenes on a satellite dish were shot at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico , while in the UK , Epsom Downs Racecourse and the Nene Valley Railway were both used . For the scenes of the fictional Russian location of Severnaya , and other effects , Derek Meddings built a number of miniature sets at Leavesden . Meddings had worked on the Bond films since Live and Let Die and died before the film 's release ; GoldenEye was dedicated to his memory . 
 The soundtrack to GoldenEye was composed and performed by Éric Serra . Prolific Bond composer John Barry turned down an offer by Barbara Broccoli to score the film . The theme song , " GoldenEye " , was written by Bono and The Edge , and was performed by Tina Turner . As Serra did not collaborate with Bono or The Edge , orchestral versions of the song did not appear throughout GoldenEye , as had been the case in previous James Bond films . 
 = = = = = Tomorrow Never Dies ( 1997 ) = = = = = 
 Before GoldenEye had been released in November 1995 , MGM / UA started their preparations for Bond 18 , intending for a release in early December 1997 , leaving Eon Productions little time for pre @-@ production . The producers were unable to convince Martin Campbell to return ; his agent said that " Martin just didn 't want to do two Bond films in a row " . Instead , Roger Spottiswoode was chosen in September 1996 . With Peter Lamont unavailable because he was committed to Titanic , Spottiswoode chose Allan Cameron in his place to provide sets ; Spottiswoode and Cameron had previously worked together on Air America . 
 The story was based on a previously discarded treatment by Donald E. Westlake , which had been written before GoldenEye . The script was given a re @-@ working by Bruce Feirstein , based on the return of Hong Kong to the Chinese . Feirstein 's script was then contributed to by Nicholas Meyer before being reworked by Dan Petrie , Jr. and David Campbell Wilson before Feirstein , who retained the sole writing credit , was brought in for a final polish . The script was finished a week before principal photography started , although Feirstein had to re @-@ write sequences throughout production . The process was further hampered by poor relations between Feirstein and Spottiswoode . 
 With the Leavesden studios unavailable , and Pinewood not having sufficient capacity , Eon converted an abandoned grocery warehouse in Hertfordshire into a filming location . With the principal crew about to fly to location in Vietnam , the Vietnamese authorities revoked permission to film at the last minute , and alternative locations were quickly found in Thailand . 
 Second unit filming began on 18 January 1997 with Vic Armstrong directing ; they filmed the pre @-@ credits sequence at Peyresourde Airport in the French Pyrenees , before moving on to Portsmouth to film the scenes where the Royal Navy prepares to engage the Chinese . The main unit began filming on 1 April 1997 at the new studios , before filming at other UK locations ; production then moved to Thailand in May . Filming completed three weeks over schedule in September 1997 . Eon initially approached John Barry to score the film , but the two sides could not come to terms ; the producers then approached David Arnold , whom Barry endorsed . 
 The delays in the production process and the rush to deliver the film by the MGM / UA @-@ imposed deadline of December 1997 drove the costs upwards to $ 110 million , although the film recouped $ 338 @.@ 9 million at the box office . 
 = = = = = The World Is Not Enough ( 1999 ) = = = = = 
 Joe Dante and then Peter Jackson were considered as directors for The World Is Not Enough . Barbara Broccoli enjoyed Jackson 's Heavenly Creatures , and a screening of The Frighteners was arranged for her . She disliked the latter film , however , and showed no further interest in Jackson . Michael Apted was then selected to lead the film . Writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade were hired after their work in Plunkett & Macleane , before Michael Apted and his wife , screenwriter Dana Stevens , undertook an uncredited rewrite . Pierce Brosnan was unhappy with some of Stevens ' changes to his character , so Michael G Wilson — who was also uncredited as screenwriter — and Bruce Feirstein undertook further revisions . 
 Production was centred at Pinewood Studios and principal photography began there on 11 January 1999 with scenes from inside the MI6 offices , designed by Peter Lamont . The pre @-@ title sequence was shot in Bilbao , Spain , in February , with production moving to Chamonix , France , which doubled for the Caucasus scenes . The exterior of a Kazakh nuclear facility was shot at the Bardenas Reales , in Navarre , Spain , while the exterior of an oil refinery control centre was doubled by the Motorola building in <unk> , Swindon . The exterior of the oil pipeline was filmed in Cwm Dyli , Snowdonia , Wales , while the production teams shot the oil pipeline explosion in Hankley Common , <unk> , Surrey . The production also visited Istanbul , Turkey ; the scenes of villain Elektra King 's Baku villa were filmed in the city , and the famous Maiden 's Tower was used for the hideout of the second villain Renard . The underwater submarine scenes were filmed in the Bahamas . 
 David Arnold returned to score the music for The World Is Not Enough — the second Bond soundtrack he composed ; Garbage sang the title song . For his work on the film , Arnold won an Ivor Novello Award . 
 = = = = = Die Another Day ( 2002 ) = = = = = 
 Lee Tamahori was hired to direct Die Another Day ; Barbara Broccoli admired his film Once Were Warriors , calling it " a phenomenal piece of filmmaking " . Broccoli noted that she and Wilson " sensed his genuine enthusiasm for Bond . It was simply great chemistry . Lee was the right guy and we were very , very lucky to get him " . Screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade returned and began work in the summer of 2000 with the producers . They used a premise from Fleming 's novel Moonraker as a basis , that of an industrialist villain who had two identities . With the planned release of the film being in the 40th anniversary year of the Bond film series , Tamahori named the Hong Kong hotel seen in the film the " <unk> Royale " , for Eon 's ruby anniversary , as well as Fleming 's first novel , Casino Royale . 
 Second unit filming started on Christmas Day 2001 with Laird Hamilton , Dave Kalama and Darrick <unk> performing the surfing scene at the surf break known as Jaws in <unk> , Maui ; the shore shots were later taken near Cádiz , Spain and Newquay , Cornwall . Principal photography of Die Another Day began on 11 January 2002 at Pinewood studios . The film was shot primarily in the United Kingdom , Iceland , and Cádiz . Filming in the UK took place at the Eden Project , the Reform Club and Pinewood Studios ' 007 Stage , with the sets by production designer Peter Lamont , which included the ice palace . During June seven separate units were filming , including underwater , aerial and miniature ; principal photography finished on 9 July , in time for the premiere in London on 20 November 2002 . 
 The soundtrack was composed by David Arnold , while the title song " Die Another Day " was written and performed by Madonna , who also had a cameo appearance in the film as a fencing instructor . Die Another Day had a budget of $ 142 million and earned $ 431 @.@ 9 million at the box office . 
 = = = = = Casino Royale ( 2006 ) = = = = = 
 In 1999 Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer obtained the rights to the 1967 film Casino Royale from Sony Pictures Entertainment for $ 10 million in the out @-@ of @-@ court settlement of a lawsuit . The case was brought by MGM after Sony had announced a deal with Kevin McClory to produce a third version of the Thunderball novel , for which McClory held the film rights . McClory had previously acted as producer with Eon on Thunderball and had licensed his rights for the production of Never Say Never Again in 1983 . In 2004 , following severe financial troubles , MGM was itself acquired by a consortium backed by Sony for $ 5 billion . 
 Casino Royale reboots the series , establishing a new timeline and narrative framework not meant to precede or succeed any previous Bond film . Barbara Broccoli stated that " For years , my father wanted to make Casino Royale — it 's the Holy Grail ... We wanted to make a tougher film , the way it should have been made years ago " . Fellow producer Michael G. Wilson agreed , commenting " We felt the last film was too fantastical , so we decided to go back to the basics and update " . Neal Purvis and Robert Wade began writing a screenplay at the end of February 2004 , while Pierce Brosnan was still Bond . Paul Haggis was brought in later , and his main contribution included rewriting the climax of the film . He explained that " the draft that was there was very faithful to the book and there was a confession , so in the original draft the character confessed and killed herself . She then sent Bond to chase after the villains ; Bond chased the villains into the house . I don 't know why but I thought that Vesper [ Lynd ] had to be in the sinking house and Bond has to want to kill her and then try and save her " . In February 2005 Martin Campbell was announced as the film 's director and the next Bond film was revealed to be Casino Royale , although the identity of the new Bond was still unknown ; the producers had chosen not to renew Pierce Brosnan 's contract , and in October Eon announced that the part of Bond would be taken by Daniel Craig . 
 Principal photography for Casino Royale commenced on 3 January 2006 . The film was primarily shot at Barrandov Studios in Prague , with additional location shooting in the Bahamas , Italy and the United Kingdom . The shoot concluded at Pinewood Studios on 20 July 2006 . In the Bahamas filming took place at Paradise Island and Albany House , an estate owned by golfers Ernie Els and Tiger Woods . Footage set in <unk> , Uganda , was filmed at Black Park , a Country Park in Buckinghamshire , with further UK location shooting taking place at the Dunsfold Aerodrome in Surrey and the Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground in Bedfordshire . 
 For many of the effects in the film , Special Effects and Miniature Effects Supervisor Chris Corbould used a more realistic style of film making and significantly reduced digital effects compared with previous Bond films . Corbould noted that , " CGI is a great tool and can be very useful , but I will fight to the tooth and nail to do something for real . It 's the best way to go " . Corbould used the 007 stage at Pinewood for the sinking of the Venetian house at the climax of the film , which featured the largest rig ever built for a Bond film . Casino Royale featured music composed by David Arnold , his fourth soundtrack for the Bond film series . Producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli announced on 26 July 2006 that Chris Cornell would perform the title song , entitled " You Know My Name " , which he co @-@ wrote with Arnold . 
 = = = = = Quantum of Solace ( 2008 ) = = = = = 
 In July 2006 , as Casino Royale entered post @-@ production , Eon Productions announced that the next film would be based on an original idea by producer Michael G. Wilson . In June 2007 Marc Forster was confirmed as director . He was surprised that he was approached for the job , stating he was not a big Bond film fan through the years , and that he would not have accepted the project had he not seen Casino Royale prior to making his decision : he felt Bond had been humanised in that film , arguing that because travelling the world had become less exotic since the series ' advent , it made sense to focus more on Bond as a character . Forster found Casino Royale 's 144 @-@ minute running time too long , and wanted his follow @-@ up to be " tight and fast ... like a bullet " . 
 Neal Purvis and Robert Wade returned as screenwriters and completed a draft of the script by April 2007 ; Paul Haggis also worked on the script , completing it two hours before the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike officially began . Further work on the script had to be undertaken by Forster and Daniel Craig , who said later , " We had the bare bones of a script and then there was a writers ' strike and there was nothing we could do . We couldn 't employ a writer to finish it . I say to myself , ' Never again ' , but who knows ? There was me trying to rewrite scenes – and a writer I am not " . Craig also admitted that the film was not initially meant to be a sequel , but it became one because of the re @-@ writes undertaken by him and Forster . Haggis located his draft 's climax in the Swiss Alps , but Forster wanted the action sequences to allude to the four classical elements of earth , water , air and fire . Michael G. Wilson decided on the film 's title Quantum of Solace only " a few days " before its announcement on 24 January 2008 . Forster hired Dennis Gassner as production designer , replacing Peter Lamont . 
 Quantum of Solace was shot in six countries , including Italy ( Talamone and Siena ) , Chile ( the Paranal Observatory ) , Austria ( Bregenz ) , Mexico , Panama and the UK . In the UK interior and exterior airport scenes were filmed at Farnborough Airfield and the snowy closing scenes were filmed at the Bruneval Barracks in Aldershot , as well as ten stages at Pinewood and two theatres for ADR work . David Arnold , who composed the scores for the previous four Bond films , returned for Quantum of Solace . He said that Forster likes to work very closely with his composers and that , in comparison to the accelerated schedule he was tied to on Casino Royale , the intention was to spend a long time scoring the film to " really work it out " . He also said he would be " taking a different approach " with the score . Jack White of The White Stripes and Alicia Keys collaborated on " Another Way to Die " , the first Bond music duet . 
 = = = = = Skyfall ( 2012 ) = = = = = 
 The production of Skyfall was suspended throughout 2010 because of MGM 's financial troubles . Eon resumed pre @-@ production following MGM 's exit from bankruptcy on 21 December 2010 and in January 2011 the film was given official approval , with production scheduled to start in late 2011 . The film 's budget is estimated to be between $ 150 million and $ 200 million , compared to the $ 200 million spent on Quantum of Solace . 
 Skyfall was directed by Sam Mendes , who first signed on to the project shortly after Quantum of Solace was released , and remained on board as a consultant during the period of uncertainty surrounding MGM 's financial situation . Speculation in the media suggested that Mendes had commissioned rewrites of the script to " [ remove ] action scenes in favour of ' characterful performances ' " , with the intention of bidding for an Academy Award . Mendes denied the reports , stating that the film 's planned action scenes were an important part of the overall film . 
 The script was written by Bond screenwriting regulars Neal Purvis and Robert Wade , as well as John Logan . Roger Deakins signed on as cinematographer , while Dennis Gassner returned as production designer . Thomas Newman , who worked with Sam Mendes as composer for American Beauty , Road to Perdition , Jarhead and Revolutionary Road , replaced David Arnold as composer ; British singer @-@ songwriter Adele co @-@ wrote and recorded the film 's theme song with her regular songwriter , Paul Epworth . 
 Principal photography was scheduled to take 133 days and began on 7 November 2011 in and around London . Production moved to Turkey in April 2012 , with parts of Istanbul — including the Spice Bazaar , Yeni Camii , the Main Post Office , Sultanahmet Square and the Grand Bazaar — closed for filming in April . Filming also took place in Shanghai . Although set in Scotland , Bond 's family home of Skyfall was constructed on Hankley Common in Surrey using plywood and plaster to build a full @-@ scale model of the building , with some exterior scenes shot in Glen Etive and Glencoe .

 In September 2012 it was announced that Daniel Craig had signed to the role of Bond for the following two films , the first of which was Spectre , funded by MGM and Sony . In March 2013 Mendes announced he would not return to direct the next film in the series , although he later decided to return . In July 2013 it was revealed that John Logan would also return as writer , while in October 2014 it was announced that Léa Seydoux would play a Bond girl in the film . Filming started in December 2014 and the film was released into cinemas on 26 October 2015 .

 = = = = = Casino Royale ( 1967 ) = = = = = 
 Production on Casino Royale was troubled and chaotic , with five different directors being credited for helming different segments of the film : Ken Hughes , John Huston , Joseph McGrath , Robert Parrish and Val Guest . In addition , stunt director Richard Talmadge was uncredited as co @-@ director of the final sequence . Ben Hecht was originally commissioned by Feldman as writer , and he provided a serious interpretation of Fleming 's source novel , before it was decided to turn the film into a comedy . Three main screenwriters then worked on the project — Wolf Mankowitz , John Law and Michael Sayers — and a further nine people provided uncredited additional material . Problems arose on set between Peter Sellers and director Joseph McGrath and between Sellers and Orson Welles . Sellers eventually demanded that he and Welles should not share the same set . Sellers left the film before his part was complete . A further agent 's part was then written for Terence Cooper , to cover Sellers ' departure , while re @-@ writes , additional filming and post @-@ production cutting compensated for the missing actor . Principal photography started on 11 January 1966 and was scheduled to take up to 26 weeks . Because of the delays and chaotic nature of the filming process , it finally finished ten months later in November . 
 Feldman asked Burt Bacharach and Hal David to provide the music for the film ; David worked for a few months completing his part , while Bacharach took nearly two years . The pair produced the song " The Look of Love " , which was sung by Dusty Springfield . Columbia Pictures approved a production budget of $ 6 million for the film , although this rose to $ 12 million at the end of production . The film performed well , with box office returns of $ 41 @.@ 7 million . 
 = = = = Jack Schwartzman ( 1983 ) = = = = 
 Never Say Never Again had its origins in the early 1960s following the controversy over the 1961 Thunderball novel , which led to Kevin McClory becoming producer of the Eon Productions film of the same name . Part of the agreement between McClory and Eon was that McClory would not make any further version of the novel for a period of ten years following the release of the 1965 Thunderball . 
 In the mid @-@ 1970s McClory again started working on a project to bring a Thunderball adaptation to production and , with the working title Warhead ( a.k.a. James Bond of the Secret Service ) he brought writer Len Deighton together with Sean Connery to work on a script . The script ran into difficulties after accusations from Eon Productions that the project had gone beyond copyright restrictions , which confined McClory to a film based on the Thunderball novel only , and once again the project was deferred . Towards the end of the 1970s developments were reported on the project under the name James Bond of the Secret Service , but then producer Jack Schwartzman became involved and cleared a number of the legal issues that still surrounded the project and licensed the rights from McClory . 
 = = = = = Never Say Never Again ( 1983 ) = = = = = 
 With Connery still committed to the project , producer Jack Schwartzman asked him to play Bond : Connery accepted , asking for and receiving a fee of $ 3 million ( $ 7 million in 2016 dollars ) , a percentage of the profits , as well as casting , script and director approval . Schwartzman then brought on board scriptwriter Lorenzo Semple , Jr. to work on the screenplay . Connery was unhappy with some aspects of the work and asked British television writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais to undertake re @-@ writes , although they went uncredited for their efforts because of a restriction by the Writers Guild of America . 
 The former Eon Productions editor and director of On Her Majesty 's Secret Service , Peter Hunt , was approached to direct the film but declined due to his previous work with Eon . Irvin Kershner , who had achieved success in 1980 with The Empire Strikes Back , was then hired . A number of the crew from the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark were also appointed , including first assistant director David Tomblin ; director of photography Douglas Slocombe and production designers Philip Harrison and Stephen Grimes . 
 Filming for Never Say Never Again began on 27 September 1982 on the French Riviera for two months before moving to Nassau , the Bahamas in mid @-@ November where filming took place at Clifton Pier , which was also one of the locations used in Thunderball . The Spanish city of Almería was also used as a location . Villain Maximillian Largo 's Palmyran fortress was actually historic Fort Carré in Antibes . Principal photography finished at Elstree Studios where interior shots were filmed . Elstree also housed the " Tears of Allah " underwater cavern , which took three months to construct . Most of the filming was completed in the spring of 1983 , although there was some additional shooting during the summer of 1983 . 
 Production on the film was troubled with Connery taking on many of the production duties with assistant director David Tomblin . Director Irvin Kershner was critical of producer Jack Schwartzman , saying that whilst he was a good businessman " he didn 't have the experience of a film producer " . After the production ran out of money , Schwartzman had to fund further production out of his own pocket and later admitted he had underestimated the amount the film would cost to make . 
 The music for Never Say Never Again was written by Michel Legrand . Legrand also wrote the main theme " Never Say Never Again " , which featured lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman — who had also worked with Legrand in the Academy Award winning song " The Windmills of Your Mind " — and was performed by Lani Hall . 
 Fleming 's estate , financially backed by Eon Productions and MGM , made a final attempt to block the film in the High Courts in London in the spring of 1983 , but these were thrown out by the court and Never Say Never Again was permitted to proceed . When Never Say Never Again was released , it grossed $ 9 @.@ 72 million ( $ 23 million in 2016 dollars ) on its first weekend , which was reported to be " the best opening record of any James Bond film " up to that point and surpassing Octopussy 's $ 8 @.@ 9 million ( $ 21 million in 2016 dollars ) from June that year . From its budget of $ 36 million , Never Say Never Again grossed $ 160 million . 
 McClory attempted to produce another Thunderball adaptation as Warhead 2000 AD following the success of GoldenEye in 1995 . Liam Neeson and Timothy Dalton were considered for 007 , while Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin were developing the film at Columbia Pictures . MGM launched a $ 25 million lawsuit against Sony , and McClory claimed a portion of the $ 3 billion profits from the Bond series . After a prolonged lawsuit , Sony backed down , and McClory eventually exhausted all legal avenues to pursue . As part of the settlement , MGM paid $ 10 million for the rights to Casino Royale , which had come into Sony 's possession .

 Daniel Craig played Bond in a short film , Happy and Glorious , produced by Lisa Osborne for the BBC and directed by Danny Boyle as part of the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London . In the film Bond is summoned to Buckingham Palace by Queen Elizabeth II — played by herself — and escorts her by helicopter to the Olympic Stadium . Bond and Her Majesty jump from the helicopter into the stadium with Union Flag parachutes . 
 For the parachute jump , Bond and the Queen were played respectively by BASE jumpers and stuntmen Mark Sutton and Gary Connery . After the film was shown , the Queen entered the stadium via conventional means and formally opened the Games . 
 = Wiesbaden @-@ class cruiser = 
 The Wiesbaden class of light cruisers was a class of ships built by the German Kaiserliche Marine ( Imperial Navy ) shortly before the outbreak of World War I. Two ships were built in this class , Wiesbaden and Frankfurt . They were very similar to the preceding design , the Graudenz class , though they were armed with eight 15 cm SK L / 45 guns instead of the twelve 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 45 guns on the earlier vessels . The ships had a top speed of 27 @.@ 5 knots ( 50 @.@ 9 km / h ; 31 @.@ 6 mph ) . 
 Wiesbaden saw only one major action , the Battle of Jutland , on 31 May – 1 June 1916 . She was badly damaged and immobilized during the battle and became the center of a melee as both sides fought over the crippled ship . She eventually sank in the early morning hours of 1 June , with only one survivor . Frankfurt was only lightly damaged at Jutland and saw extensive service with the II Scouting Group , including during Operation Albion against the Russians in the Baltic and at the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight , both in 1917 . She was interned with the rest of the fleet at the end of the war and scuttled at Scapa Flow , though British sailors prevented her from sinking . Frankfurt was ceded to the US Navy as a war prize and eventually expended as a target in July 1921 .

 The ships were 141 @.@ 7 meters ( 465 ft ) long at the waterline and 145 @.@ 3 m ( 477 ft ) long overall . They had a beam of 13 @.@ 9 m ( 46 ft ) and a draft of 5 @.@ 76 m ( 18 @.@ 9 ft ) forward and 6 @.@ 06 m ( 19 @.@ 9 ft ) aft . They displaced 5 @,@ 180 metric tons ( 5 @,@ 100 long tons ; 5 @,@ 710 short tons ) at designed displacement and 6 @,@ 601 t ( 6 @,@ 497 long tons ; 7 @,@ 276 short tons ) at full combat load . The hulls were built with longitudinal steel frames and contained seventeen watertight compartments and a double bottom that extended for forty @-@ seven percent of the length of the keel . Steering was controlled by a single rudder . Wiesbaden and Frankfurt had a crew of 17 officers and 457 enlisted men . They carried a number of smaller craft , including one picket boat , one barge , one cutter , two yawls , and two dinghies . 
 Their propulsion systems consisted of two sets of Marine steam turbines driving two 3 @.@ 5 @-@ meter ( 11 ft ) propellers . They were designed to give 31 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 23 @,@ 000 kW ) . These were powered by twelve coal @-@ fired Marine @-@ type water @-@ tube boilers and two oil @-@ fired double @-@ ended boilers . These gave the ship a top speed of 27 @.@ 5 knots ( 50 @.@ 9 km / h ; 31 @.@ 6 mph ) . The ships of the class carried 1 @,@ 280 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 260 long tons ) of coal , and an additional 470 tonnes ( 460 long tons ) of oil that gave them a range of 4 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 8 @,@ 900 km ; 5 @,@ 500 mi ) at 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . At 25 knots ( 46 km / h ; 29 mph ) , the cruising radius dropped significantly , to 1 @,@ 200 nmi ( 2 @,@ 200 km ; 1 @,@ 400 mi ) . Wiesbaden was equipped with a pair of turbo generators and one diesel generator rated at a combined 300 kilowatts ( 400 hp ) at 220 Volts . Frankfurt only had the two turbo generators , which provided 240 kW ( 320 hp ) .

The guns could engage targets out to 17 @,@ 600 m ( 57 @,@ 700 ft ) . They were supplied with 1 @,@ 024 rounds of ammunition , for 128 shells per gun . The ships ' antiaircraft armament initially consisted of four 5 @.@ 2 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) L / 55 guns , though these were replaced with a pair of 8 @.@ 8 cm SK L / 45 anti @-@ aircraft guns . The ships were also equipped with four 50 cm ( 19 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes with eight torpedoes . Two were submerged in the hull on the broadside and two were mounted on the deck amidships . They could also carry 120 mines . 
 Wiesbaden and Frankfurt were protected by a waterline armored belt that was 60 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) thick amidships ; the belt was reduced to 18 mm ( 0 @.@ 71 in ) forward . The stern was not armored . The conning tower had 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick sides and a 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) thick roof . The rangefinder atop the conning tower had 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) worth of armor protection . The deck was covered with 60 mm thick armor plate forward , 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) amidships , and 20 mm aft . Sloped armor 40 mm thick connected the deck to the belt armor . The main battery gun shields were 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick .

 Wiesbaden was ordered under the contract name " Ersatz Gefion " and was laid down at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin in 1913 and launched on 20 January 1915 , after which fitting @-@ out work commenced . She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 23 August 1915 , after being rushed through trials . The ship saw only one major action , the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916 . The ship was badly damaged by gunfire from the battlecruiser HMS Invincible . <unk> between the two battle fleets , Wiesbaden became the center of a hard @-@ fought action that saw the destruction of two British armored cruisers . Heavy fire from the British fleet prevented evacuation of the ship 's crew . Wiesbaden remained afloat until the early hours of 1 June and sank sometime between 01 : 45 and 02 : 45 . Only one crew member survived the sinking ; the wreck was located by German Navy divers in 1983 .

 Frankfurt was ordered under the contract name " Ersatz Hela " and was laid down at the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Kiel in 1913 and launched on 20 March 1915 . The ships was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 20 August 1915 . Frankfurt saw extensive action with the High Seas Fleet during World War I. She served primarily in the North Sea , and participated in the Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft and the battles of Jutland and Second Heligoland . At Jutland , she was lightly damaged by a British cruiser and her crew suffered minor casualties . The ship was also present during Operation Albion in the Baltic Sea in October 1917 . At the end of the war , she was interned with the bulk of the German fleet in Scapa Flow . When the fleet was scuttled in June 1919 , Frankfurt was one of the few ships that were not successfully sunk . She was ceded to the US Navy as a war prize and ultimately expended as a bomb target in tests conducted by the US Navy and Army Air Force in July 1921 . 
 = Japanese aircraft carrier Zuihō = 
 Zuihō ( <unk> , " Auspicious Phoenix " or " Fortunate Phoenix " ) was a light aircraft carrier of the Imperial Japanese Navy . Originally laid down as the submarine support ship Takasaki , she was renamed and converted while under construction into an aircraft carrier . The ship was completed during the first year of World War II and participated in many operations . Zuihō played a secondary role in the Battle of Midway in mid @-@ 1942 and did not engage any American aircraft or ships during the battle . The ship participated in the Guadalcanal Campaign during the rest of 1942 . She was lightly damaged during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands during this campaign and covered the evacuation of Japanese forces from the island in early 1943 after repairs . 
 Afterwards , her aircraft were disembarked several times in mid- to late @-@ 1943 and used from land bases in a number of battles in the South West Pacific . Zuihō participated in the Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf battles in mid @-@ 1944 . In this last battle , Zuihō mainly served as a decoy for the main striking forces and she was finally sunk by American aircraft fulfilling her task . In between engagements , the ship served as a ferry carrier and a training ship . 
 = = Design and conversion = = 
 The submarine support ship Takasaki was laid down on 20 June 1935 at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal and was designed to be converted to either a fleet oiler or a light aircraft carrier as needed . She was launched on 19 June 1936 and began a lengthy conversion into a carrier while fitting @-@ out . The ship was renamed Zuihō during the process which was not completed until 27 December 1940 when she was commissioned . 
 After her conversion , Zuihō had a length of 205 @.@ 49 meters ( 674 ft 2 in ) overall . She had a beam of 18 @.@ 19 meters ( 59 ft 8 in ) and a draft of 6 @.@ 58 meters ( 21 ft 7 in ) . She displaced 11 @,@ 443 tonnes ( 11 @,@ 262 long tons ) at standard load . As part of her conversion , her original diesel engines , which had given her a top speed of 29 knots ( 54 km / h ; 33 mph ) , were replaced by a pair of destroyer @-@ type geared steam turbine sets with a total of 52 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 39 @,@ 000 kW ) , each driving one propeller . Steam was provided by four water @-@ tube boilers and Zuihō now had a maximum speed of 28 knots ( 52 km / h ; 32 mph ) . The boilers exhausted through a single downturned starboard funnel and she carried 2 @,@ 600 tonnes ( 2 @,@ 600 long tons ) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 7 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 14 @,@ 400 km ; 9 @,@ 000 mi ) at a speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . Her crew numbered 785 officers and men . 
 Zuihō 's flight deck was 179 @.@ 98 meters ( 590 ft 6 in ) long and had a maximum width of 23 @.@ 01 meters ( 75 ft 6 in ) . The ship was designed with a single hangar 124 @.@ 00 meters ( 406 ft 10 in ) long and 17 @.@ 98 meters ( 59 ft 0 in ) wide . The hangar was served by two octagonal centerline aircraft elevators . The forward elevator was 13 @.@ 01 by 11 @.@ 99 meters ( 42 @.@ 67 by 39 @.@ 33 ft ) in size and the smaller rear elevator measured 11 @.@ 99 by 10 @.@ 79 meters ( 39 @.@ 33 by 35 @.@ 4 ft ) . She had arresting gear with six cables , but she was not fitted with an aircraft catapult . Zuihō was a flush @-@ deck design and lacked an island superstructure . She was designed to operate 30 aircraft . 
 The ship 's primary armament consisted of eight 40 @-@ caliber 12 @.@ 7 cm Type 89 anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns in twin mounts on sponsons along the sides of the hull . Zuihō was also initially equipped with four twin 25 mm Type 96 light AA guns , also in sponsons along the sides of the hull . In 1943 , her light AA armament was increased to 48 twenty @-@ five mm guns . The following year , an additional twenty 25 mm guns were added in addition to six 28 @-@ round AA rocket launchers .

 After commissioning , Zuihō remained in Japanese waters until late 1941 . Captain <unk> <unk> assumed command on 20 September and Zuihō became flagship of the Third Carrier Division ten days later . On 13 October she was briefly assigned to the 11th Air Fleet in Formosa and arrived in Takao the following day . The ship returned to Japan in early November and was given a brief refit later in the month . Together with the carrier Hōshō and six battleships , Zuihō covered the return of the ships of the 1st Air Fleet as they returned from the Attack on Pearl Harbor in mid @-@ December . 
 On February 1942 , the ship ferried Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters to Davao City , Philippines . Zuihō remained in Japanese waters until June when she participated in the Battle of Midway . She led the Support Fleet and did not engage American carriers directly . Her aircraft complement consisted of six Mitsubishi A5M " Claude " and six Mitsubishi A6M2 " Zero " fighters , and twelve Nakajima B5N2 " Kate " torpedo bombers . After a brief refit in July – August , the ship was assigned to First Carrier Division with Shōkaku and Zuikaku on 12 August . 
 The division sailed to Truk on 1 October to support Japanese forces in the Guadalcanal Campaign and left Truk on 11 October based on the promise of the Japanese Army to capture Henderson Field on Guadalcanal . At this time , Zuihō carried 18 A6Ms and 6 B5Ns . The Japanese and American carrier forces discovered each other in the early morning of 26 October during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands and each side launched air strikes . The aircraft passed each other en route and 9 of Zuihō 's Zeros attacked the aircraft launched by the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise . They shot down 3 each Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters and Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers and damaged one more of each type while losing four of their own . Two of Enterprise 's Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers hit Zuihō with 500 @-@ pound ( 230 kg ) bombs and damaged her flight deck enough that she could not conduct flight operations although she was not seriously damaged otherwise . Together with the damaged Shōkaku , the ship withdrew from the battle and reached Truk two days later . After temporary repairs , the two carriers returned to Japan in early November and Zuihō 's repairs were completed on 16 December . In the meantime , Captain <unk> Yamaguchi assumed command . 
 The ship left Kure on 17 January 1943 and sailed for Truk with a load of aircraft . Upon arrival she was assigned to the Second Carrier Division to provide cover for the evacuation of Guadalcanal , along with Jun 'yō and Zuikaku , later in the month and in early February . Zuihō 's fighters were transferred to Wewak , New Guinea in mid @-@ February and then to Kavieng in early March . They were transferred to Rabaul on mid @-@ March to participate in Operation I @-@ Go , a land @-@ based aerial offensive against Allied bases in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea . The fighters returned to Truk on 18 March after claiming 18 Allied aircraft shot down . Zuihō arrived at Sasebo on 9 May and received a brief refit in mid @-@ June . She returned to Truk on 15 July and remained in the area until 5 November when she returned to Yokosuka . Her air group , 18 Zeros and eight D3As , was briefly deployed to Kavieng in late August – early September before returning to Truk . By this time , Zuihō was assigned to the First Carrier Division with Shōkaku and Zuikaku and they sailed for Eniwetok Atoll on 18 September for training and to be in position to intercept any attacks by American carriers in the vicinity of Wake Island and the Marshall Islands area . That day the American carriers raided the Gilbert Islands and were gone by the time the Japanese reached Eniwetok on 20 September . Japanese intelligence reports pointed to another American attack in the Wake @-@ Marshall Islands area in mid @-@ October and Admiral Mineichi Koga sortied the Combined Fleet , including the First Carrier Division , on 17 October . They arrived at Eniwetok two days later and waited for reports of American activity until 23 October . They then sailed for Wake Island and then returned to Truk on 26 October without encountering any American ships . 
 Zuihō 's air group was transferred to Rabaul at the beginning of November , just in time to participate in the raid on Rabaul a few days later . The fighters claimed to have shot down 25 American aircraft at the cost of 8 of their own ; the survivors flew back to Truk where they remained . On 30 November , Zuihō , together with the escort carriers Chūyō and Unyō , departed Truk for Japan , escorted by four destroyers . The Americans had cracked the Japanese naval codes and positioned several submarines along their route to Yokosuka . Skate unsuccessfully attacked Zuihō on 30 November , while Sailfish torpedoed and sank Chūyō five days later with heavy loss of life . From December to May 1944 , Zuihō ferried aircraft and supplies to Truk and Guam although she was reassigned to the Third Carrier Division on 29 January , together with the converted carriers Chitose and Chiyoda . Each of the three carriers was intended to be equipped with 21 fighters and 9 torpedo bombers , but this plan was changed on 15 February to a consolidated air group , the 653rd , that controlled the aircraft of all three carriers . While fully equipped by May with 18 Zero fighters , 45 Zero fighter @-@ bombers , 18 B5Ns , and 9 Nakajima B6N " Jill " torpedo bombers , the air group 's pilots were largely drawn from the two most recent classes and lacked experience . The ship sailed for Tawi @-@ Tawi on 11 May in the Philippines . The new base was closer to the oil wells in Borneo on which the Navy relied and also to the Palau and western Caroline Islands where the Japanese expected the next American attack . However , the location lacked an airfield on which to train the green pilots and American submarines were very active in the vicinity which restricted the ships to the anchorage . 
 = = = Battle of the Philippine Sea = = = 
 The 1st Mobile Fleet was en route to Guimares Island in the central Philippines on 13 June , where they intended to practice carrier operations in an area better protected from submarines , when Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa learned of the American attack on the Mariana Islands the previous day . Upon reaching Guimares , the fleet refueled and sortied into the Philippine Sea where they spotted Task Force 58 on 18 June . The Americans failed to locate Ozawa 's ships that day and the Japanese turned south to maintain a constant distance between them and the American carriers as Ozawa had decided on launching his air strikes early the following morning . He had deployed his forces in a " T " - shaped formation with the 3rd Carrier Division at the end of the stem , 115 nautical miles ( 213 km ; 132 mi ) ahead of the 1st and 2nd Carrier Divisions that formed the crossbar of the " T " . Zuihō and her consorts were intended to draw the attentions of the Americans while the other carriers conducted their air strikes without disruption . Sixteen Aichi E13A floatplanes were launched by the heavy cruisers accompanying the carriers at 04 : 30 to search for the Americans ; the three carriers launched a follow up wave of 13 B5Ns at 05 : 20 . The first wave spotted one group of four carriers from Task Force 58 at 07 : 34 and the Japanese carriers launched their aircraft an hour later . This consisted of 43 Zero fighter @-@ bombers and 7 B6Ns , escorted by 14 A6M5 fighters ; the carriers retained only 3 fighters , 2 fighter @-@ bombers , 2 B6Ns and 2 B5Ns for self @-@ defense and later searches . While the air strike was still forming up , the second wave of searchers located Task Force 58 's battleships and the air strike was diverted to attack them . The Americans detected the incoming Japanese aircraft at 09 : 59 and had a total of 199 Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters in the air by the time the Japanese aircraft were in range of the American ships . The defending fighters decimated the Japanese aircraft and only 21 survived . The only damage inflicted was from one A6M2 that hit the battleship South Dakota in her superstructure with a single 250 @-@ kilogram ( 550 lb ) bomb that wounded 50 crewmen , but did little other damage . Only 3 Hellcats were lost in the affair , one to a B6N , although the Japanese claimed four victories . Some of the surviving Japanese aircraft landed at Guam while others , including the five surviving B6Ns , returned to their carriers where they claimed one carrier definitely damaged and another probably hit . 
 At dusk , the Japanese turned away to the northwest to regroup and to refuel and the Americans turned west to close the distance . Both sides launched aircraft the next day to locate each other ; Zuihō launched three aircraft at 12 : 00 to search east of the fleet , but they did not discover the Americans . The Americans discovered the retiring Japanese fleet during the afternoon and Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher ordered an air strike launched . While they sank the carrier Hiyō and damaged two others , Zuihō was not attacked and successfully disengaged that evening . By the end of the battle , Air Group 653 was reduced to 2 Zero fighters , 3 Zero fighter @-@ bombers and 6 torpedo bombers . After reaching Japan on 1 July , the ship remained in Japanese waters until October , training replacements for her air group . 
 = = = Battle of Leyte Gulf = = = 
 After the Battle of the Philippine Sea , the commander of the Combined Fleet , Admiral Soemu Toyoda , prepared four " victory " plans : Shō @-@ Gō 1 ( <unk> Shō <unk> <unk> ) was a major naval operation in the Philippines , while Shō @-@ Gō 2 was intended to defend Formosa , the Ryukyu Islands and southern Kyushu . Shō @-@ Gō 3 and Shō @-@ Gō 4 were responses to attacks on Kyushu @-@ Shikoku @-@ Honshu and Hokkaido respectively . He activated Shō @-@ Gō 2 after the Americans attacked the Philippines , Formosa and the Ryukyu Islands beginning on 10 October . This required the transfer of most of Air Group 652 to Formosa and Luzon to attack the American forces , with only a few aircraft retained for carrier operations . Most of these aircraft were lost for little gain as the Americans suppressed Japanese defenses in the Philippines , preparatory to the actual invasion . 
 On 17 October , Admiral Toyoda alerted the fleet that Shō @-@ Gō 1 was imminent and activated the plan the following day after receiving reports of the landings on Leyte . Zuihō 's role in Shō @-@ Gō 1 , together with Chiyoda , Chitose and Zuikaku and the rest of the Main Body of the 1st Mobile Fleet , approaching Leyte Gulf from the north , was to serve as decoys to attract attention away from the two other forces approaching from the south and west . All forces were to converge on Leyte Gulf on 25 October and the Main Body left Japan on 20 October . As decoys , the carriers were only provided with a total of 116 aircraft : 52 Zero fighters , 28 Zero fighter @-@ bombers , 7 Yokosuka D4Y " Judy " dive bombers , 26 B6N and 4 B5N torpedo bombers . By the morning of 24 October , the Main Body was within range of the northernmost American carriers of Task Force 38 and Admiral Ozawa ordered an air strike launched to attract the attention of the Americans . This accomplished little else as the Japanese aircraft failed to penetrate past the defending fighters ; the survivors landed at airfields on Luzon . The Americans were preoccupied dealing with the other Japanese naval forces and defending themselves from air attacks launched from Luzon and Leyte and could not spare any aircraft to search for the Japanese carriers until the afternoon . They finally found them at 16 : 05 , but Admiral William Halsey , Jr . , commander of Task Force 38 , decided that it was too late in the day to mount an effective strike . He did , however , turn all of his ships north to position himself for a dawn attack on the Japanese carriers the next day in what came to be called the Battle of Cape Engaño . 
 Aircraft from the light carrier Independence were able to track the Japanese ships for most of the night and Halsey ordered an air strike of 60 Hellcat fighters , 65 Helldiver dive bombers and 55 Avenger torpedo bombers launched shortly after dawn in anticipation of locating the Japanese fleet . They spotted them at 07 : 35 and brushed aside the 13 Zeros that the Japanese had retained for self @-@ defense . Zuihō attempted to launch her few remaining aircraft , but was hit by a single bomb on her aft flight deck after a number of torpedo @-@ carrying Avengers missed . The 500 @-@ pound ( 230 kg ) bomb started several small fires , lifted the rear elevator , bulged the flight deck , knocked out steering and gave the ship a small list to port . Twenty minutes later , the fires were put out , steering repaired and the list corrected . A second attack an hour later focused on Chiyoda and ignored Zuihō . The third wave arrived around 1300 and badly damaged the ship . She was hit once by a torpedo and twice by small bombs , although fragments from as many as 67 near misses cut steam pipes and caused flooding of both engine rooms and one boiler room . Zuihō was forced to reduce speed to 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) and flooding increased so that all available hands were ordered to man the pumps at 14 : 10 . The ship took on a 13 ° list to starboard and went dead in the water at 14 : 45 when the port engine room fully flooded . A fourth wave of American aircraft attacked ten minutes later , but only damaged her with splinters from another ten near misses . This was enough to increase her list to 23 ° and she was ordered abandoned at 15 : 10 . Zuihō sank at 15 : 26 at position 19 ° 20 ′ N 125 ° 15 ′ E with the loss of 7 officers and 208 men . The destroyer Kuwa and the battleship Ise rescued 58 officers and 701 men between them . 
 = Thurisind = 
 Thurisind ( Latin : <unk> , died c . 560 ) was king of the Gepids , an East Germanic Gothic people , from c . 548 to 560 . He was the penultimate Gepid king , and succeeded King Elemund by staging a coup d 'état and forcing the king 's son into exile . Thurisind 's kingdom , known as Gepidia , was located in Central Europe and had its centre in Sirmium , a former Roman city on the Sava River ( now the town of Sremska Mitrovica , Serbia ) . 
 His reign was marked by multiple wars with the Lombards , a Germanic people who had arrived in the former Roman province of Pannonia under the leadership of their king , Audoin . Thurisind also had to face the hostility of the Byzantine Empire , which was resentful of the Gepid takeover of Sirmium and anxious to diminish Gepid power in the Pannonian Basin , a plain covering most of modern Hungary and partly including the bordering states . The Byzantines ' plans to reduce the Gepids ' power took effect when Audoin decisively defeated Thurisind in 551 or 552 . The Byzantine Emperor Justinian forced a peace accord on both leaders so that equilibrium in the Pannonian Basin could be sustained . 
 Thurisind lost his eldest son , Turismod , in the Battle of Asfeld , during which the prince was killed by Alboin , son of Audoin . In about 560 , Thurisind died and was succeeded by his remaining son Cunimund , who was killed by Alboin in 567 . Cunimund 's death marked the end of the Gepid Kingdom and the beginning of the conquest of their territories by the Lombards ' allies , the Avars , a nomadic people migrating from the Eurasian Steppe . 
 = = Early sources = = 
 Of the four early medieval sources relevant to Thurisind that survive , the only one providing independent evidence of the king , accounts of Justinian 's wars , and a detailed account of the relations between Gepids and Lombards and their kings is De Bellis ( 550s ) , the most important work of Procopius . Considered the greatest historian of the 6th century , Procopius was a Greek writer born in Caesarea in Palestine in 527 . The Lombard – Gepid wars are well described in Procopius ' work , as the conflict played an important part in the Byzantine plans to invade Italy by a land route . 
 Less relevant is the other 6th @-@ century source , Jordanes ' Romana . Of Gothic ancestry , Jordanes served as a <unk> for a Byzantine Master of the Soldiers before entering into the ranks of the Catholic clergy and writing his two surviving books , the Romana and the Getica . The latter is a summary of Gothic history , while the lesser known Romana is an abridged account of Roman history written in 551 or 552 . According to James O 'Donnell , the two works share a pessimistic view of human life in which all secular accomplishments are insignificant compared to religious goals . Jordanes does not explicitly mention Thurisind in the Romana , but speaks of the third Lombard – Gepid War , in which Thurisind participated , in the last passages of the work . 
 Paul the Deacon was the most important Italian writer of the 8th century . Born in the 720s or 730s , he came from a noble Lombard family from Friuli . He entered the clergy early , and eventually became a monk of the monastery of Monte Cassino . His most famous work is the Historia Langobardorum , a history of the Lombard nation . Written after 787 , it is a continuation of his previous major historical work , the Historia Romana , which was based on the Breviarium of Eutropius , with six books added describing historical events up to Justinian 's empire . Both of these works mention Thurisind and the third Lombard – Gepid War , which represent the only overlap between the Historia Langobardorum and the Historia Romana . Both books also mention the duel between the kings ' sons , an event which is absent in Procopius ' writing and is thought to have originated through oral tradition . Similarly , the meeting between Thurisind and Audoin 's son at the former 's court derives from an oral source . 
 = = Rise to power = = 
 The Gepids were a major Germanic people in what is now eastern Hungary , western Romania , and northern Serbia . Although the details of his early life are not known , Thurisind is believed to have risen to power in about 548 . After the death of Elemund , the previous king , he seized the throne in a coup d 'état and forced Elemund 's son Ostrogotha into exile . Ostrogotha and his followers found refuge among the Gepids ' neighbours and enemies , the Lombards , another Germanic people who had just settled in the western part of the Pannonian Basin . The Gepids had inhabited parts of the basin since the 3rd century . They reached prominence in the 5th century when , under King Ardaric , they played a key role in destroying the Hunnic Empire . Ardaric and his people benefited more than anybody else from this victory , gaining the former Roman province of Dacia . 
 In 504 the Gepids ' power was significantly reduced by the Ostrogoths , who cut short their expansion into the Danubian plains . The Gepids restricted themselves to the eastern part of the Pannonian Basin ; this was to form the core of Thurisind 's dominions , just as it had under the previous Gepid kings . By the early 6th century , the Gepid nobility converted to Arian Christianity , while most of the Gepids remained pagans . 
 According to the scholar István Boná , Thurisind 's rise to power is a typical example of the conflicts among the leading families for the kingship that plagued Gepidia in the 6th century and made it difficult to maintain the succession within the king 's family . To contain these obstacles Thurisind made Turismod , his oldest son , commander of the Gepid forces in Sirmium , an important position that made Turismod the king 's heir apparent ( in early Germanic custom the eldest son was not necessarily the first in line of succession ) . After Turismod died , his younger brother Cunimund became commander in Sirmium and thus heir apparent . 
 = = First war with the Lombards = = 
 On becoming king in 548 , Thurisind immediately found himself in a difficult situation . Sometime during 546 – 548 , the Byzantine Empire had conspired to convince the Lombards under Audoin to move into Pannonia ( modern Hungary ) , a former Roman province bordering the Danube river . Justinian hoped this would keep open the land route from the Balkans to Italy while containing the Gepids , who he considered a serious menace to Byzantine interests on the Balkan frontier . The Gothic War between the Ostrogoths and the Byzantines had been raging on the Italian peninsula since 535 ; Justinian wanted to be able to rush troops to Italy if they were needed . 
 According to the contemporary Procopius in the De Bello <unk> ( the section of the De Bellis regarding the Gothic War ) , Justinian resented the takeover by the Gepids of the formerly Roman city of Sirmium in 537 , which may have been voluntarily surrendered by the Ostrogoths to create difficulties for the Byzantines . The Ostrogoths were also occupied with the war in Italy and sought to retain their possessions in the peninsula . Sirmium 's takeover was followed in 539 by a bloody confrontation between the Gepids and the Byzantines that had cost the latter the life of <unk> , their Master of the Soldiers , and also the loss to the Gepids of Dacia <unk> ( Serbia ) and Singidunum ( Belgrade ) . Because of this , Justinian ended the alliance that had bonded the Gepids and Byzantines , and had ceased paying tributes to the Gepids , finding an enemy to set them against in the Lombards . 
 The build @-@ up towards a war involving Lombards , Gepids , and Byzantines started possibly in 548 or 549 , with Audoin and Thurisind each sending an embassy to Justinian 's court at Constantinople , in attempts to obtain military support from Justinian or at least , in the case of Thurisind , to get a pledge of neutrality . To sway Justinian , Thurisind 's envoys reminded him of their long tradition of alliance and promised to fight against Byzantium 's enemies . However , the emperor sided with the Lombards ; he made them formal allies and promised to provide troops against the Gepids . From Justinian 's perspective , this war was of major importance in the larger context of the Gothic War , because possession of Pannonia was strategically necessary to keep open land communications between Italy and the Balkans . 
 Historians debate as to when the conflict started . Proposed dates for the first war are either 547 or 549 . At the same time as the two peoples took the field , a 10 @,@ 000 @-@ strong Byzantine horse army under the command of John , the magister militum of Illyricum , marched against the Gepids . Before John 's arrival , Thurisind offered a truce to Audoin that was accepted . As a result , when the Byzantines arrived , the war had already ended , but not before they had clashed with the Gepids ' <unk> allies . To seal the truce , Audoin demanded that Thurisind should give up Ildigis , a pretender to the Lombard crown who lived as a guest at his court . Thurisind refused , but he did force Ildigis to leave the Gepids and search for another refuge . 
 = = Second Lombard – Gepid War and tensions with Justinian = = 
 In either 549 or 550 , the Gepids and Lombards again marched against each other but , according to Procopius , both armies panicked and no battle took place . As a result , a new war was avoided and Thurisind accepted Audoin 's request for a two @-@ year truce . According to István Boná , the panic may be linked to a natural phenomenon : a lunar eclipse took place on June 25 / 26 , 549 . 
 Confronted by an openly hostile Byzantine Empire , and faced with the eventuality that the war with the Lombards would be renewed at the truce 's expiration , Thurisind searched for new allies as a way to pressure Justinian . He found assistance from the Kutrigurs , who he ferried across the Danube into the Byzantine Illyricum in 550 or 551 , before the truce expired and probably before the Gepids were ready to precipitate a new conflict . In retrospect , it may be they arrived too late instead of too early , if the agreement had been made with the Second Lombard – Gepid War in mind . 
 Faced with the Kutrigur invasion , Justinian activated his alliance against the invaders , mobilizing the neighbouring <unk> , who in turn asked for help from the allied Crimean <unk> . The latter invaded the Kutrigur homeland , taking advantage of the fact that many warriors were employed at that moment in the Balkans . Informed of the attack , the Kutrigurs were forced to leave the Balkans to defend their homeland on the north @-@ western shore of the Black Sea . 
 Thurisind protected and promoted another enemy of Byzantium , the Sclaveni . As with the Kutrigurs , Thurisind used his control of the Danube to ferry Slavic raiders to and from Byzantine territory , and obtained payment from them in the process . 
 = = Third Lombard – Gepid War = = 
 Justinian 's plans to send expeditionary forces against the Ostrogoths in Italy were repeatedly hampered by Thurisind 's initiatives . For example , Narses ' army left Constantinople in April 551 for Salona , with hopes of finally defeating the Goths , but found itself blocked at Philippopolis ( Plovdiv ) by the Kutrigurs . 
 This brought Justinian to search for an accord with Thurisind to stop the trans @-@ Danubian raids , and the latter was more than happy to accept . Thurisind 's envoys asked for an alliance like the one bonding Byzantines and Lombards . In addition to strengthening the alliance , they demanded , and got , 12 senators to swear to uphold the treaty . After this , in 551 , 400 Gepids were sent to fight in Narses ' army , which was sent to Italy — a modest army compared to the 5 @,@ 500 Lombards sent by Audoin and the thousands of Heruli . 
 When the truce expired in 552 , Thurisind and Audoin again took to the field , and this time the clash was unavoidable . Audoin had reached an agreement with Justinian by which the Byzantines promised to send him military support in exchange for the 5 @,@ 500 Lombards sent to help the Byzantine general Narses in the Emperor 's war in Italy . 
 The two @-@ year truce was now close to expiry and the Lombards asked the Byzantines to respect the alliance which had been established between them . The Emperor found an excuse to break the new alliance with the Gepids by claiming they had again ferried Slav raiders . He put together an army with renowned commanders in its ranks such as Germanus ' sons Justin and Justinian , <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , and Amalafrid , brother @-@ in @-@ law of Audoin . A revolt that erupted in <unk> diverted the bulk of the army ; only a force under Amalafrid reached the battlefield . 
 Scholars debate when the third Lombard – Gepid War started ; it is agreed that it took place two years after the second war . The possible dates are either 551 or 552 . The 551 date is upheld by those who argue that since in 552 Audoin had already dispatched 5 @,@ 500 of his warriors to Narses ' Italian campaign , the third Lombard – Gepid War must have already ended by then ; against this scholars such as Walter Pohl protest that this is in contradiction with Audoin 's reproaches to Justinian on the few troops sent against the Gepids , despite his massive support to Narses . 
 When the treaty expired , Audoin attacked the Gepids and Thurisind was crushed in the decisive battle of the Asfeld held west of Sirmium . The battle was mentioned by Jordanes in the Romana as one of the most bloody ever fought in the region , with no fewer than 60 @,@ 000 warriors killed . The king 's son Turismod also died , killed by Audoin 's son Alboin in a duel that according to Paul the Deacon decided both the battle and the war . After the battle , the Gepids were never again able to play a formative role in the shaping of events . 
 = = Peace = = 
 The Gepids ' defeat caused a geopolitical shift in the Pannonian Basin , as it ended the danger represented by the Gepids to the Empire . The Gepids ' utter defeat could have meant the end of their kingdom and its conquest by the Lombards , but Justinian , wanting to maintain an equilibrium in the region , imposed an " eternal peace " that saved the Gepids ; it was observed for ten years , surviving both Thurisind and Audoin . It may be on this occasion , and not before the war , that Lombards and Gepids sent troops to Narses as part of the peace treaty imposed by the Byzantines . In this interpretation , the small number of Gepid warriors sent could be explained with the heavy losses taken in the war and the resentment felt towards Justinian . The Emperor also imposed some territorial concessions on Thurisind , obligating him to return Dacia <unk> and the territory of Singidunum . 
 To reach a complete peace Thurisind had first to deal with Ildigis who had found hospitality at Thurisind 's court . Audoin demanded yet again to have him turned in , and Justinian joined in the request . Thurisind , despite his reluctance to resume the war with both Audoin and Justinian , did not want to openly breach the rules of hospitality and thus tried to evade the request by demanding in his turn to have Ostrogotha given to him ; in the end , to avoid both openly giving in and at the same time renewing the war , both kings murdered their respective guests but kept secret their involvement in the act . 
 Thurisind features prominently in a tale told by Paul the Deacon set in 552 , just after the death of the king 's son Turismod and the end of the war . The story , generally thought to track its origins to an heroic poem dedicated to Alboin , revolves around the characters of Alboin and Thurisind : in accordance with a custom of the Lombards , to obtain the right to sit at his father 's table , Alboin must ask for hospitality from a foreign king and have the latter arm him . To submit himself to this initiation , Alboin went with 40 companions to Thurisind 's court . 
 Thurisind , in observance of the laws of hospitality , received Alboin and his companions and organized a banquet in their honour , offering Alboin the place where his dead son habitually sat . Following a mockery by Turismod 's brother Cunimund and Alboin 's rejoinder , a clash was avoided by Thurisind 's intervention , who restored the peace and sent Alboin away with Turismod 's arms . According to István Boná , who believes in the veracity of the story , the event may have taken place as described by Paul , but it also could reflect a secret peace condition imposed by Audoin on Thurisind under which the Gepid king had to arm his son 's killer . 
 Thurisind died around 560 and was succeeded by his son Cunimund , last king of the Gepids ; under him Thurisind 's people were annihilated in 567 by a joint coalition of the Lombards and the Avars , a Turkic nomad people that in 558 had migrated to Central Europe . Cunimund was killed on the battlefield by the new Lombard King Alboin , and his daughter Rosamund was taken captive . 
 = <unk> sand tiger = 
 The smalltooth sand tiger or <unk> ragged @-@ tooth ( Odontaspis ferox ) is a species of mackerel shark in the family Odontaspididae , with a patchy but worldwide distribution in tropical and warm temperate waters . They usually inhabit deepwater rocky habitats , though they are occasionally encountered in shallow water , and have been known to return to the same location year after year . This rare species is often mistaken for the much more common grey nurse shark ( Carcharias taurus ) , from which it can be distinguished by its first dorsal fin , which is larger than the second and placed further forward . It grows to at least 4 @.@ 1 m ( 13 @.@ 5 ft ) in length . 
 Very little is known of the biology and behavior of the smalltooth sand tiger . It is an active predator of benthic bony fishes , invertebrates , and cartilaginous fishes . This species is thought to be ovoviviparous with oophagous embryos like other mackerel sharks . In contrast to its formidable size and appearance , this shark is harmless , having never been known to behave aggressively towards humans . There is concern that its numbers are declining due to human activities in the Mediterranean and elsewhere , though existing data is inadequate for a full assessment of its conservation status . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The smalltooth sand tiger was originally described as Squalus ferox by Italian @-@ French naturalist Antoine Risso in 1810 , based on a specimen from Nice , France . In 1950 , Gilbert Percy Whitley described O. <unk> from Australian specimens , separating them from O. ferox on the basis of dentition and the absence of spots . Leonard Compagno synonymized the two species in 1984 , as subsequently discovered Pacific specimens had blurred Whitley 's distinguishing characters . The specific epithet ferox is Latin for " fierce " . Other common names for this shark include blue nurse shark , fierce shark , Herbst 's nurse shark , and sand tiger shark . 
 A phylogenetic study based on mitochondrial DNA , performed by Naylor et al. in 1997 , suggests that the smalltooth sand tiger and its relative , the bigeye sand tiger ( O. noronhai ) , are more closely related to the thresher sharks than to the grey nurse shark , to which it bears a strong resemblance . If true , this would indicate that the similarities between this species and the grey nurse shark arose as the result of convergent evolution . Fossil teeth belonging to the smalltooth sand tiger have been found from Lower Pliocene ( 5 @.@ 3 – 3 @.@ 6 Ma ) deposits in Italy and Venezuela . 
 = = Description = = 
 The smalltooth sand tiger has a bulky body with a long , bulbous , slightly flattened snout . The eyes are medium @-@ sized , with large round pupils ( as opposed to slit @-@ like in the grey nurse shark ) , and lack nictitating membranes . 
 The mouth is large and filled with projecting teeth . Each tooth has a narrow , tall central cusp flanked by 2 @-@ 3 pairs of lateral cusplets . There are 48 – 56 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 36 – 46 tooth rows in the lower jaw ; the front large teeth in the upper jaw are separated from the lateral teeth by 2 – 5 intermediate teeth . 
 The fins are broad @-@ based and angular in shape . The first dorsal fin is larger than the second and placed closer to the pectoral fins than the pelvic fins . The caudal fin is strongly asymmetrical with the upper lobe much longer than the lower . The coloration is gray to gray @-@ brown above and lighter below . Juveniles are uniform in color with darker fin margins , while adults often exhibit dark spots or blotches that vary widely in pattern , size , and density . Coloration also appears to vary by region , with some individuals from the Mediterranean displaying a patchy , " piebald " pattern . The smalltooth sand tiger attains a maximum length of 4 @.@ 1 m ( 13 @.@ 5 ft ) and a maximum weight of 289 kg ( 637 lbs ) . There are unconfirmed reports of much larger individuals from <unk> Island off Colombia . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 <unk> sand tigers have been caught at widely scattered locations throughout the world , indicating a possibly circumtropical distribution . In the eastern Atlantic Ocean , it is known from the Bay of Biscay south to Morocco , including the Mediterranean Sea , the Azores , and the Canary Islands . In the western Atlantic , it has been reported from off North Carolina and Florida ( USA ) , the Yucatan Peninsula ( Mexico ) , and Fernando de Noronha ( Brazil ) . It occurs throughout the Indian Ocean , from South Africa , Madagascar , and Tanzania in the west to the Maldives and the Southwest Indian Ridge in the east . In the northern Pacific it is known from off Japan , Hawaii , California , and Colombia , and in the southern Pacific it is known from New Caledonia , eastern Australia , and New Zealand . 
 Typically regarded as a deepwater species , the smalltooth sand tiger has been caught down to a depth of 880 m ( 2 @,@ 900 ft ) . They are usually found near the bottom in rocky , boulder @-@ strewn regions on continental shelves and the upper continental slope , as well as around submarine ridges and mountains . There are also reports of this species near the drop @-@ offs of rocky or coral reefs and in the upper layers of the open ocean . In the Mediterranean , smalltooth sand tigers occur at depths less than 250 m ( 820 ft ) , including at depths accessible to divers . They have been seen swimming over sandy flats at Cocos Island and Fernando de Noronha . The temperature range favored by this species is 6 – 20 ° C ( 43 – 63 ° F ) ; in hot climates they are found below the thermocline in cooler water . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 The smalltooth sand tiger is a strong @-@ swimming shark that may be encountered singly or in aggregations of up to five individuals . Catch records suggest that this species may cover long distances in oceanic waters along underwater ridges or " hopping " between seamounts . It has a very large , oily liver , which allows it to maintain neutral buoyancy in the water column with minimal effort . At a location called " Shark Point " off Beirut , Lebanon , small groups of smalltooth sand tigers appear every summer on rocky reefs at a depth of 30 – 45 m ( 100 – 150 ft ) . The same individuals have been documented returning to this site year after year . Their purpose there is unknown , being speculated to relate to mating . When confronted , these sharks have been observed to stall , gape their mouths , turn around , and shake their tails towards the perceived threat . 
 Adult smalltooth sand tigers have no known predators , though they are bitten by cookiecutter sharks ( Isistius brasiliensis ) . A known parasite is the tapeworm <unk> gracile , which infests the shark 's spiral valve intestine . The carcass of a 3 @.@ 7 m ( 12 @.@ 1 ft ) long female found off Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands contained a number of snubnosed eels ( <unk> parasitica ) inside her heart , body cavity , and back muscles . It is unknown whether the eels contributed to the shark 's death . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 Compared to the grey nurse shark , the dentition of the smalltooth sand tiger is less robust and lacks specialized cutting and crushing teeth , suggesting that it tends to tackle smaller prey . The diet of the smalltooth sand tiger consists of bottom @-@ dwelling bony fishes such as rockfish ( Sebastes spp . ) , invertebrates such as squid , shrimp , and possibly marine isopods , and cartilaginous fishes including rays and chimaeras . The largest known prey item taken by this species was a 1 @.@ 3 m ( 4 @.@ 3 ft ) long kitefin shark ( Dalatias licha ) , found inside the stomach of a 2 @.@ 9 m ( 9 @.@ 5 ft ) long male from New Caledonia . 
 = = = Life history = = = 
 No pregnant smalltooth sand tigers have ever been found ; this species is presumed to be ovoviviparous as in other mackerel sharks . <unk> @-@ <unk> ( 1996 ) described a 3 @.@ 6 m ( 11 @.@ 8 ft ) female from the Gulf of California that contained " hundreds of ova " in her right ovary , which would support the embryos being oophagous . Whether the embryos also cannibalize each other as in the grey nurse shark is unknown . The size at birth is estimated to be 1 @.@ 0 – 1 @.@ 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 – 3 @.@ 6 ft ) . With a few recorded exceptions , juveniles are found in deep water and only adults are present above a depth of 200 m ( 660 ft ) ; this may serve to reduce predation on young individuals by large , shallow @-@ water predators such as the great white shark ( Carcharodon carcharias ) . Males mature at a length of 2 @.@ 0 – 2 @.@ 5 m ( 6 @.@ 6 – 8 @.@ 2 ft ) and females at a length of 3 @.@ 0 – 3 @.@ 5 m ( 9 @.@ 4 – 11 @.@ 5 ft ) . Faint scars seen on some individuals may be related to courtship . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 Encounters with divers have shown that , despite their size , smalltooth sand tigers are docile and do not react aggressively even when closely approached . This species is taken as bycatch in gillnets , bottom trawls , and on longlines ; most captures occur in the Mediterranean and off Japan . It is usually discarded when caught , except in Japan where the meat is consumed ( though considered very inferior to the grey nurse shark ) and the liver oil is utilized . The fins , jaws , and cartilage are also of value . 
 Discoveries , beginning in the 1970s , of smalltooth sand tigers in shallow water have raised urgent conservation concerns , as this species is apparently more vulnerable to human activity than previously believed . There is at present insufficient data for the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) to assess the worldwide conservation status of this species . It has been assessed as Vulnerable in Australian waters , due to a decline of over 50 % in catches off New South Wales since the 1970s . Populations of this species in the Mediterranean are also believed to have declined , due to a combination of habitat degradation , overfishing , pollution , and human disturbance . The smalltooth sand tiger has been protected by the Australian government since 1984 ; this came about concurrently with protection for the grey nurse shark , which had been decimated in Australian waters , so as to prevent any claims of confusing one species for the other . However , these regulations have proven difficult to enforce .
