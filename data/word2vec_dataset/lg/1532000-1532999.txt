 Argon is used for thermal insulation in energy efficient windows . Argon is also used in technical scuba diving to inflate a dry suit because it is inert and has low thermal conductivity . 
 Argon is used as a propellant in the development of the Variable Specific Impulse <unk> Rocket ( <unk> ) .

The gas is stored at high pressure . 
 Argon @-@ 39 , with a half @-@ life of 269 years , has been used for a number of applications , primarily ice core and ground water dating . Also , potassium @-@ argon dating is used to date igneous rocks . 
 Argon has been used by athletes as a doping agent to simulate hypoxic conditions . On August 31 , 2014 the World Anti Doping Agency ( WADA ) added argon and xenon to the list of prohibited substances and methods , although at this time there is no reliable test for abuse .

 = New York State Route 31E = 
 New York State Route 31E ( NY 31E ) is a 5 @.@ 29 @-@ mile ( 8 @.@ 51 km ) state highway located in western New York in the United States . It serves as a northerly alternate route of NY 31 between the village of Middleport in eastern Niagara County and the nearby village of Medina in Orleans County . NY 31E connects to NY 31 at each end by way of a short overlap with NY 271 in Middleport . Most of NY 31E parallels the Erie Canal , and parts of the route run adjacent to the waterway . Outside of the two villages at each end , NY 31E traverses mostly rural areas of the towns of Royalton and Ridgeway . 
 The origins of the route date back to 1914 when its routing was included as part of a spur route of Route 30 , a cross @-@ state , unsigned legislative route . The spur route was eliminated in 1921 , and the road went unnumbered until 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York when it became part of NY 3 . Most of NY 3 west of Rochester was replaced by NY 31 in the mid @-@ 1930s , and NY 31 was realigned onto its present , more southerly alignment between Middleport and Medina in 1949 . Its former canalside alignment became NY 31E at this time . Most of NY 31E is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation ( NYSDOT ) ; however , two sections in Niagara County and Medina are locally maintained . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 31E begins at an intersection with NY 31 in the village of Middleport in eastern Niagara County . The route heads north as Main Street , overlapping with NY 271 ( which also begins at NY 31 ) through the mostly residential village . Just south of the Erie Canal , NY 31E and NY 271 enter Middleport 's small business district , centered on the junction of Main and State Streets . Here , NY 31E and NY 271 split , with NY 31E following State Street eastward through the eastern portion of the community . Along this stretch , the route serves Royalton – Hartland High School and Royalton @-@ Hartland Middle School before exiting Middleport and entering a slightly more open area of the town of Royalton . NY 31E runs past undeveloped land to the north and a smattering of homes to the south on its way into the Orleans County town of Shelby New York | Ridgeway ] ] . 
 East of the county line , NY 31E becomes Telegraph Road and continues across increasingly less developed areas of Ridgeway . The Erie Canal is visible from most of this section of NY 31E , and about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) of the highway runs directly alongside the waterway , which curves several times between Middleport and Medina . The two separate at the small hamlet of Shelby Basin , where the route follows a more southerly alignment into a more populated area . Not far to the east is the village of Medina , where NY 31E changes names to West Center Street . The route heads east across the residential western half of the village , passing Prospect Avenue ( former NY 63 ) on its way into Medina 's business district . NY 31E passes the village 's post office and enter the Main Street Historic District , where NY 31E terminates at NY 31 and NY 63 . 
 Maintenance along the route varies by location . From the Niagara – Orleans county line to the Medina village line , NY 31E is maintained by NYSDOT . All of the route within Niagara County , excluding the state @-@ maintained overlap with NY 271 in Middleport , is county @-@ maintained as the unsigned County Route 143 ( CR 143 ) . In Medina , NY 31E is entirely maintained by the village , though between the village line and Prospect Avenue ( former NY 63 ) , it was NYSDOT @-@ maintained for 0 @.@ 25 miles ( 0 @.@ 40 km ) to its terminus at NY 31 until 2010 . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1914 , the New York State Legislature added two spur routes to Route 30 , an unsigned legislative route extending from Niagara Falls in western Niagara County to Rouses Point in Clinton County via Medina . The first of these began at Route 30 ( modern NY 63 ) and followed what is now NY 31E west to Middleport , from where it continued toward Lockport on current NY 31 . On March 1 , 1921 , most of Route 30 's Medina – Lockport spur route was supplanted by an extended Route 20 . The lone exception was from Medina to Middleport , where Route 20 utilized modern NY 31 instead . When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924 , all of legislative Route 20 west of Rochester became part of NY 3 . 
 NY 3 remained on what is now NY 31 between Middleport and Medina until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York when it was realigned between the two villages to use what is now NY 31E . U.S. Route 104 was assigned to all of Ridge Road c . 1935 , replacing then @-@ NY 31 west of Rochester . As a result , NY 31 was shifted southward onto most of NY 3 from Niagara Falls to Rochester , including between Middleport and Medina . NY 31 was realigned on January 1 , 1949 , to follow its current alignment between the two villages . The former routing of NY 31 was redesignated as NY 31E , a northerly alternate route of NY 31 . 
 The alignment of NY 31E has not changed since that time ; however , ownership of parts of the route has changed hands over the years . Until 1998 , NY 31E was state @-@ maintained from its western terminus in Middleport to the Medina village line . On October 1 , 1998 , ownership and maintenance of NY 31E between NY 271 in Middleport and the Niagara – Orleans county line was transferred from the state to Niagara County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government . This section of the route was subsequently co @-@ designated , but not signed , as CR 143 by Niagara County .

When he was two years old , he and his family were involved in a car accident in his hometown , colliding with a lorry . Ribéry suffered serious facial injuries that resulted in more than one hundred stitches and which left two long scars down the right side of his face , and another across his brows . Prior to joining Stade <unk> in 2003 , he worked as a construction worker with his father , which Ribéry referred to as a " learning experience " .

 Ribéry began his football career at age six playing in the youth section of amateur club FC Conti de Boulogne @-@ sur @-@ Mer . After a seven @-@ year stay , in 1996 , he joined professional outfit Lille , who were playing in the second division . While at Lille , Ribéry excelled athletically , but developed academic and behavioural problems , which led to Lille releasing him . In 2012 , during a press conference ahead of Bayern Munich 's Champions League tie against his former club Lille , Ribéry explained that he was released from the Lille academy after suffering a broken elbow and that Lille officials had previously wanted to drop him from the academy for being " too small " . 
 After leaving Lille , Ribéry returned to his hometown joining the biggest club in the city , US Boulogne . After spending a year in the reserves , he was promoted to the senior team . Ribéry only made four appearances in his debut season as Boulogne , who were playing in the CFA , the fourth division of French football , earned promotion to third @-@ tier Championnat National . In his second season with the club , Ribéry appeared in 25 league matches converting five goals . Although Boulogne finished 17th , which meant a return to the fourth division , Ribéry 's solid performances earned him a move to fellow National club Olympique Alès . In his only season at the club , Ribéry made 18 appearances scoring only one goal . 
 Following the season , despite finishing safe , Alès were relegated to the Division d 'Honneur , the sixth division of French football , by the <unk> after the club declared bankruptcy . The resulting news led to Ribéry signing with Stade Brest , another Championnat National club . At Brest , Ribéry established himself as a premier player in the league appearing in 35 league matches scoring three goals . Ribéry 's performance and the team as a whole led to the club finishing second in the league , thus earning promotion to Ligue 2 . 
 Despite his success with Brest , Ribéry sought to play in Ligue 1 , the top division of French football . His dream came to fruition when Metz 's manager Jean Fernandez took a liking to him and recruited him on a free transfer . Ribéry only spent half a season at Metz , but impressed earning the UNFP Player of the Month in August 2004 . He scored his only league goal for Metz on 6 November in the team 's 1 – 1 draw with Toulouse . His stellar play on the right side of midfield led to Metz supporters comparing him to Robert Pirès , a former Metz legend . After negotiations on an extension ended in a stalemate , in January 2005 , Ribéry relocated to Turkey . There he joined Galatasaray on an initial loan deal ; the Istanbul @-@ based outfit had the right to pay Metz € 2 million to make the move permanent . 
 = = = Galatasaray = = = 
 At Galatasaray , Ribéry was brought in by manager Gheorghe Hagi and appeared in 14 league matches as the club finished in third @-@ place position . While playing for the club , Galatasaray supporters nicknamed him " <unk> " , in reference to his quick acceleration with the ball at his feet and also " Scarface " due to a large scar located on the right side of his face . In the Turkish Cup , Ribéry was instrumental in the club 's 5 – 1 thrashing of rivals Fenerbahçe in the competition 's ultimate match . He scored the opening goal in the 16th minute and also assisted on another goal . Ribéry was later substituted in the 52nd minute with Galatasaray leading 3 – 1 .

 = = = Move to Marseille and CAS ruling = = = 
 On 15 June 2005 , Ribéry announced that he would be returning to France joining Ligue 1 club Marseille on a five @-@ year contract , plus reuniting with former manager Jean Fernandez . The move was considered surprising to Galatasaray as Ribéry had three years remaining on his contract after the club paid Metz € 2 million to make the loan move permanent on 30 March . Ribéry argued that he had not been paid his wages by the club and asked FIFA , the sport 's governing body , to invalidate his contract . He also confirmed that , at one point during the season , he was threatened with a baseball bat by his former agent and a Galatasaray director . A day after announcing his move , Galatasaray officials and manager Eric Gerets blasted the player for betraying the club and also announced their intent to ask FIFA to probe the situation . 
 In July 2005 , FIFA ruled in favour of Ribéry and dismissed Galatasaray 's claims of the player being at fault . In response , the Turkish club announced their decision to challenge FIFA 's ruling by appealing to the international Court of Arbitration for Sport . On 25 April 2007 , their appeal was dismissed by the court , who declared in a statement that Ribéry had terminated his contract with the Turkish club at the end of the 2004 – 05 season on just grounds , and that Galatasaray was therefore not entitled to any compensation . Galatasaray had sought € 10 million in compensation from Marseille .

 In the Coupe de France , Ribéry performed well scoring a double against Le Havre and scoring the opening goal in Marseille 's 3 – 1 semi @-@ final victory over Rennes . The win pushed Marseille through to the 2006 final , where they faced Le Classique rivals Paris Saint @-@ Germain , which merited Ribéry his second consecutive cup final appearance . Unfortunately , Marseille faltered losing 2 – 1 to the Parisian club . In Europe , Ribéry scored two goals in the UEFA Intertoto Cup against Italian club Lazio and Spanish outfit Deportivo de La Coruña . In the UEFA Cup , he scored one goal converting it in the second leg of Marseille 's Round of 32 tie with Premier League club Bolton Wanderers . Ribéry was later named the National Union of Professional Footballers ( UNFP ) Young Player of the Year .

 Following Ribéry 's success internationally at the 2006 FIFA World Cup , a bidding war occurred in order to obtain his services with English club Arsenal initially offering € 15 million for the player . However , Arsenal would be trumped by Spanish club Real Madrid , who offered € 30 million for the Frenchman , according to Marseille directors . Rivals Olympique Lyonnais also sought Ribéry 's services , with president Pape Diouf accusing Jean @-@ Michel Aulas of tapping @-@ up Ribéry after it was discovered that the Lyon chairman visited the France national team and Ribéry himself during the 2006 FIFA World Cup . Diouf later threatened to report Aulas to the Ligue de Football Professionnel ( LFP ) for his actions . He went as far as to accuse Ribéry 's former agent , Bruno <unk> , of badly advising the player . Marseille continued to declare him off @-@ limits with nearly four years remaining on Ribéry 's contract . On 11 August 2006 , Ribéry confirmed his intention to remain with the club for the 2006 – 07 season . 
 Ribéry 's now heightened popularity saw increased speculation from writers and supporters that Marseille would finally win their first league title since the 1991 – 92 season . He began the 2006 – 07 campaign on a high note , scoring in the club 's second match of the season against Auxerre in a 3 – 0 victory . On 11 November 2006 , Ribéry suffered a serious groin injury in Marseille 's 1 – 0 loss to Lille . The resulting injury meant Ribéry was out for a number of weeks , returning following the winter break . On his return in January , Ribéry netted two goals in another win over Auxerre . The following month , Ribéry suffered a fractured foot in a match against Toulouse . The injury required him to miss four league matches , as well as a Coupe de France match . In April 2007 , Ribéry finished the league season by scoring in back @-@ to @-@ back weeks against Sochaux in a 4 – 2 win and Monaco in another victory . 
 In the Coupe de France , Marseille again reached the final with Ribéry , for the second straight season , putting them there scoring the game @-@ winning goal in a 3 – 0 semi @-@ final win over Nantes . In the final , Marseille were heavy favourites over Sochaux , a team they had completely dominated just 12 days prior . However , Sochaux recorded an upset victory defeating Marseille 5 – 4 on penalties after the match ended 2 – 2 following extra time . Ribéry 's final match with Marseille was a 1 – 0 win over Sedan on the final match day of the season . The victory secured second place for Marseille and was their best finish since finishing runner @-@ up to Bordeaux during the 1998 – 99 season .

 Following the 2008 – 09 season , constant speculation began to surface regarding Ribéry 's availability on the transfer market . Despite Bayern president Uli Hoeneß , executive Karl @-@ Heinz Rummenigge and new manager Louis van Gaal declaring that Ribéry would not be sold , numerous media outlets declared that English clubs Chelsea and Manchester United , Spanish clubs Barcelona and Real Madrid , and Italian outfit Inter Milan had strong interest in the player , with many of the clubs willing to offer as much as € 65 million for his services .

 Ribéry began the 2009 – 10 season struggling with tendonitis in his left knee , but was healthy enough to start the season scoring his first goal in a 5 – 1 victory against rivals Borussia Dortmund , converting a free kick . The goal was notable in part due to Ribéry 's celebration afterward ; following his conversion , Ribéry ran across the field eluding several celebratory teammates and enthusiastically jumped into his manager Louis van Gaal 's awaiting arms . The mutual show of admiration ended speculation by the media of the two having a poor relationship . In early October , the tendinitis began to affect his play , which resulted in Ribéry missing the rest of the year , as well as France 's World Cup playoff tie with the Republic of Ireland . 
 On 23 January 2010 , Ribéry returned to the team , making an appearance as a substitute in the club 's 3 – 2 league win over Werder Bremen .

On 28 April , Ribéry was handed a three @-@ match suspension by UEFA 's Control and Disciplinary Body for assault . The suspension meant that Ribéry would miss the final . Following the ruling , Bayern Munich announced their intent to appeal the suspension . On 5 May , the club 's appeal was heard by the UEFA Appeals Body , which upheld Ribéry 's ban meaning he would not only miss the final on 22 May , but also the next UEFA club competition fixture for which he is eligible . Immediately after the ruling , however , Bayern responded by announcing their intention of appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport . 
 On 15 May , Ribéry scored the third goal in Bayern 's 4 – 0 win over Werder Bremen in the 2009 – 10 edition of the DFB @-@ Pokal final .

In total with the under @-@ 21s , Ribéry made 13 appearances scoring two goals . 
 Ribéry earned his first cap with the senior team in a 1 – 0 victory over Mexico on 27 May 2006 appearing as a substitute in the 74th minute for striker David Trezeguet . His solid performances in the friendly matches ahead of the 2006 FIFA World Cup led to his inclusion in the team for the competition . Ribéry appeared in all seven matches France contested , starting six . On 27 June , he scored France 's opening goal in the team 's 3 – 1 Round of 16 win over Spain after receiving a through ball from Patrick Vieira , which allowed the winger to dribble past an oncoming Iker Casillas and shoot into the empty net . He played in the final where France lost to Italy on penalties . Ribéry 's only shot on goal came in extra time and he was later replaced by Trezeguet . 
 Following the retirement of Zinedine Zidane , it was expected that Ribéry would succeed him and become the national team 's talisman . He went scoreless for almost a year and a half before converting a penalty shot against England on 26 March 2008 at the Stade de France . Following the goal , Ribéry paid tribute to legendary French commentator Thierry <unk> , who had died a day earlier . At Euro 2008 , France performed below expectations , with Ribéry appearing in all three group stage matches as France suffered early elimination . On 17 June 2008 , in the team 's final group stage match against Italy , Ribéry ruptured a ligament in his left ankle in just the 8th minute of play . Ribéry returned to the team on 11 October 2008 in a FIFA World Cup qualification match against Romania , scoring the team 's opening goal in a 2 – 2 draw . On 28 March 2009 , Ribéry scored the lone goal away to Lithuania . Three days later , he completed this feat again , this time at the Stade de France , netting the winner in the 75th minute following service from André @-@ Pierre Gignac . 
 On 11 May 2010 , Ribéry was named to Domenech 's 30 @-@ man preliminary squad to participate in the 2010 World Cup and his second World Cup overall . He was later named to the 23 @-@ man team to compete in the competition . Ribéry appeared in all three group stage matches . Following the team 's opening match against Uruguay , Ribéry was criticised for his performance by former international Just Fontaine , who questioned Ribéry 's leadership ability . It was later reported by the media that Ribéry and striker Nicolas Anelka purposely " froze @-@ out " midfielder Yoann Gourcuff . Anelka was later dismissed from the team after reportedly having a dispute in which obscenities were passed , with Domenech during half @-@ time of the team 's 2 – 0 loss to Mexico . 
 On 20 June , an emotional Ribéry appeared alongside Domenech on TF1 's football show <unk> to dispel rumors associated with the team and to also apologize to supporters for the national team 's performance over the past two years , stating , " We [ France ] are suffering at the moment , " and , " I would like to say sorry to the whole country . " The following day , the team boycotted a training session in response to Anelka 's expulsion and , on 21 June , returned to training without incident . In the team 's final group stage match against the hosts South Africa , Ribéry assisted on the team 's only goal of the competition , scored by Florent Malouda . France , however , lost the match 2 – 1 , which resulted in the team 's elimination from the competition . On 6 August , Ribéry was one of five players summoned to attend a hearing held by the Disciplinary Committee of the French Football Federation ( <unk> ) in response to the team 's strike held at the World Cup . On 17 August , he received a three @-@ match international ban for his part in the incident . Ribéry did not attend the hearing due to his parent club 's objection . 
 On 17 March 2011 , Ribéry was called up to the national team by new manager Laurent Blanc for the first time since the 2010 World Cup . He had been eligible to return to the team since October 2010 after serving his three @-@ match suspension , but due to injuries , Ribéry missed three call @-@ ups . On 21 March , after arriving to Clairefontaine ahead of the team 's matches against Luxembourg and Croatia , Ribéry attended a personal press conference in which he apologized for his behavior overall during the 2010 calendar year . He made his return to the team on 25 March in the team 's match against Luxembourg and responded by assisting on the team 's second goal , scored by Yoann Gourcuff , in its 2 – 0 win . In his first match at the Stade de France since his participation at the World Cup , against Croatia , Ribéry appeared as a substitute and was subject to jeers from some section of supporters , though other parts of the stadium chanted his name . 
 After appearing regularly in qualifying for UEFA Euro 2012 , on 29 May 2012 , Ribéry was named to the squad to participate in the competition . Two days prior , he scored his first goal for France in over three years in a 3 – 2 friendly comeback win over Iceland . On 31 May , Ribéry scored the game @-@ winning goal in a 2 – 0 win against Serbia . Four days later , he capped off the trio of lead @-@ in friendly matches ahead of the European Championship by scoring the opening goal in a 4 – 0 shutout win over Estonia . 
 Ribéry was included in France 's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup , but on 6 June , coach Didier Deschamps confirmed that he would miss the tournament through injury . Shortly afterwards , in August 2014 Ribéry retired from international football . He cited the reasons for his retirement as " purely personal " . 
 = = Style of play and personality = = 
 Ribéry primarily plays as a winger and is described as a player who is " fast , tricky , and an excellent dribbler who has great control with the ball at his feet " . Despite being predominantly right @-@ footed and utilized as a right @-@ sided midfielder during his development years in France , since establishing himself as an international and at Bayern Munich , Ribéry has personally admitted that his preference is to play on the left wing , even going as far as to state , " My place is on the left " when asked at a February 2010 media session while on international duty . Although he is often played on the left wing domestically , Ribéry has struggled to establish himself as a left winger at the international level with France due to the presence of left @-@ footed dominant players such as Florent Malouda . Ribéry has declared that he is best utilized on the left side because " that is where I am most free and I am the best in my head " . Playing on the left also allows Ribéry to use his " bursts of acceleration and weaving runs " to effectively cut inside , which gives him the options of either shooting or delivering a decisive pass . Ribéry is also capable of playing in the center of the field as an attacking midfielder , where his vision and playmaking skills are best exhibited . Despite predominantly playing on the wing , he has averaged double @-@ digits in assists every year beginning with his final season at Marseille . 
 Ribéry has been described as a provocateur on the field of play , with UEFA describing him as " a crowd @-@ pleaser – one of those rare breed of footballer capable of enjoying his talents while expressing them " . During the 2006 World Cup , he was mentored by national team playmaker Zinedine Zidane . While boasting him as " the jewel of French football " , Zidane has also praised Ribéry as a person , declaring , " Franck just loves life . He 's the kind of player that makes an impression every time he plays . He ’ s bound to become an important figure in the world of football . " 
 Ribéry 's on @-@ field personality is often matched off @-@ field as he is often referred to as a " joker " and " prankster " by club and international teammates . The midfielder has stated that humour is very important , admitting , " It 's important to always be smiling , to wake up and feel good . We ( footballers ) have a great job , we like what we do and we have fun . " His more notable stunts include driving a tractor on field during one of his last matches with Marseille ; in his debut season with Bayern , emptying a bucket of water over former club goalkeeper Oliver Kahn from the roof of the club 's training centre ; and , during the 2008 – 09 winter break , commandeering the team bus while in Dubai and crashing it . 
 Ribéry , however , has struggled with injuries . Since his first season at Bayern in which he appeared in 46 of the club 's 54 competitive matches , Ribéry has struggled with minor and serious injuries that has resulted in the player failing to appear in over 40 matches in subsequent seasons ; the midfielder passed the 40 @-@ match barrier in the 2011 – 12 season after failing to in the previous three seasons . Ahead of the 2008 – 09 season , he tore ligaments in one of his ankles while on international duty and , during the 2009 – 10 season , struggled with tendinitis in his left knee . In the next season , Ribéry suffered an ankle injury , which resulted in the midfielder missing two months , despite the initial diagnosis ruling him out for four weeks . He later suffered a similar ankle injury at the start of the 2011 – 12 season . Ribéry , himself , has admitted that injuries have led to most of his five @-@ year career at Bayern being difficult , stating in July 2011 , " The last two years ( 2009 – 10 and 2010 – 11 seasons ) have been more difficult , partly because I kept picking up injuries . The important thing for me now is to avoid any more injuries " . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Ribéry 's younger brothers François and Steven are also football players . François played for many amateur clubs in France , among others for Bayonne in the Championnat National . Steven plays for Bayern reserves team . 
 Ribéry 's wife , <unk> , is a French national of Algerian descent and the couple have two daughters named <unk> and <unk> and two sons named Salif and Mohammed . Ribéry is a convert to Islam and , following his conversion , adopted the name Bilal Yusuf Mohammed . 
 = = = Commercial promotions = = = 
 Since establishing himself as an international , Ribéry has been involved in numerous promotional campaigns . He is sponsored by American sportswear company Nike and regularly wears Nike Mercurial Vapors . He appeared in several television advertisements for Nike and , during the 2007 – 08 Bundesliga season , starred in a one @-@ off television show called The Franck Ribéry Show , which aired on Direct 8 in France . The show , sponsored by Nike , acted as a variety show with Ribéry appearing in several sketches . Ribéry features in EA Sports ' FIFA video game series . For the 2008 – 09 season , he appeared on the French cover of FIFA 09 alongside international teammate Karim Benzema , and was the ninth @-@ highest rated player in FIFA 15 . 
 On 25 May 2010 , a 27 by 30 metres ( 89 ft × 98 ft ) billboard of Ribéry was officially unveiled in his home city of Boulogne @-@ sur @-@ Mer ahead of the 2010 World Cup . The billboard paid tribute to a similar billboard that was erected for Zinedine Zidane in his home city of Marseille during his career . The construction of the billboard was initially suspended due to possible image ramifications associated with Ribéry 's alleged relationship with an underage prostitute . 
 However , the Regional Council of the Nord @-@ Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais region , which initially opposed the billboard , agreed to allow construction of the billboard . The billboard was a project of Ribéry 's sponsor Nike and was on display for the duration of the 2010 World Cup . More recently , he was one of several international superstars featured in Nike 's " The Last Game " , a five @-@ minute animated ad made during the run @-@ up to the 2014 World Cup that went viral . 
 He appeared in the music video for " <unk> pas <unk> ! ! ! " by Magic System and Khaled . The single released in 2009 stayed seven weeks at number one in SNEP French Singles Chart . 
 = = = Controversies = = = 
 On 18 April 2010 , it was first reported by French television service M6 that four members of the French national team were being investigated for their roles as clients of a prostitution ring that was being operated inside of a Paris nightclub , with some of the women possibly being underage . The report also stated that two of the players were already questioned as witnesses by judge André Dando and a group of magistrates . The report described the two players as being one who " is a major player in a big foreign club " and that the other " plays in the championship of France Ligue 1 " . Later that day , the players were discovered to be Ribéry and Sidney Govou . During his interview with Dando , Ribéry reportedly admitted to having had a relationship with a prostitute , but did not know that she was a minor at the time the relationship began . 
 On 29 April 2010 , the country 's Secretary of State for Sports Rama <unk> , after refusing to publicly comment on the case in its infancy , declared that any player placed under investigation should not represent the France national team . The following day , a judicial source confirmed that Ribéry would not be placed under official investigation , if at all , before the start of the 2010 World Cup . On 20 July , Ribéry was questioned by Paris police and , following questioning , was indicted by judge Dando on the charge of " solicitation of a minor prostitute " . In November 2011 , prosecutors asked for the cases against Ribéry and Benzema to be dropped , saying that the players were not aware that the escort , identified as <unk> <unk> , was 16 years old when they had paid to have sex with her .

 = Jimmy McAleer = 
 James Robert " <unk> " McAleer ( July 10 , 1864 – April 29 , 1931 ) was an American center fielder , manager , and stockholder in Major League Baseball who assisted in establishing the American League . He spent most of his 13 @-@ season playing career with the Cleveland Spiders , and went on to manage the Cleveland Blues , St. Louis Browns , and Washington Senators . Shortly before his retirement , he became a major shareholder in the Boston Red Sox . 
 His career ended abruptly . During his brief tenure as co @-@ owner of the Red Sox , McAleer quarreled with longtime friend and colleague Ban Johnson , president of the American League . In the wake of this disagreement , he sold off his shares in the Red Sox and broke off his relationship with Major League Baseball . 
 McAleer 's rift with Johnson , along with his sudden retirement , damaged his professional reputation , and he received little recognition for his contributions to baseball . Today , he is most often remembered for initiating the customary request that the President of the United States throw out the first ball of the season . 
 = = Early years = = 
 McAleer was born in Youngstown , Ohio , an industrial center located near the border of western Pennsylvania . His father , Owen McAleer , died at a young age , leaving McAleer 's mother , Mary , to support three children . The family lived on the city 's west side , where the McAleer children were raised to value the concept of formal education . McAleer attended local public schools and graduated from Rayen High School . In later years , all three of the McAleer brothers moved on to successful careers , and the oldest , Owen McAleer , Jr . , served for a time as mayor of Los Angeles . 
 A " strapping six @-@ foot 175 @-@ pound outfielder , " McAleer won early recognition for his physical speed . He became involved with a Youngstown minor league baseball club in 1882 , remaining with the team until 1884 . In 1885 , McAleer joined another minor league organization in Charleston , South Carolina ; and in 1887 , he played for a team based in Memphis , Tennessee . His skill as a center fielder was recognized in 1888 , while he was playing for a club in Milwaukee , Wisconsin . 
 Although his primary focus was organized sports , McAleer was also drawn to the field of entertainment . During one season of his minor league career , he became part @-@ owner of the <unk> Comedy Company , a theatrical road troupe that was organized in Youngstown . His interest in show business remained a constant , and in later years McAleer developed a strong friendship with Broadway composer and performer George M. Cohan . 
 = = Playing career = = 
 On April 24 , 1889 , McAleer broke into the Major Leagues in Cleveland , Ohio , where he established a reputation as a graceful outfielder . In 1891 , when Patsy Tebeau became manager of the Cleveland Spiders , the club became known for its aggressive tactics . Tebeau encouraged players to block and hold runners , while he himself openly challenged and harassed officials . In 1896 , the Cleveland manager was jailed for attacking an umpire who " decided it was too dark to continue a game " . On June 27 , 1896 , McAleer was among several Cleveland players to be fined by a Louisville ( Kentucky ) judge for their role in the incident . Later that year , the club 's notoriety prompted other National League teams to propose a boycott of Cleveland , " until the Spiders mended their ways . " McAleer 's periodic displays of temper were in keeping with this rowdy environment . During an August 18 , 1891 game with the Cincinnati Reds , Reds player Arlie Latham tripped McAleer as he rounded third base ; McAleer responded by chasing Latham around the field , while brandishing his bat . 
 At the same time , McAleer proved a strong performer . A later newspaper account described him as an outstanding outfielder who was " blessed with excellent speed " . The article noted that McAleer 's skills as a sprinter helped him steal 51 bases in one year and 41 in another . According to some accounts , he was " the first centerfielder to take his eyes off a fly ball , run to the spot where it fell to earth , and catch it " . Less proficient as a hitter , McAleer accumulated a lifetime batting average of .253 . During his career , the league 's batting ( pitchers removed ) average for players with the same home field was .284 . On April 24 , 1894 , he assisted in Cleveland 's 1 – 0 victory over Cincinnati with a single in the ninth that drove home Buck Ewing , who had doubled . Along with teammates Cy Young , Jesse Burkett , John Clarkson , and Charles Zimmer , McAleer also participated in the Spiders ' victory over the Baltimore Orioles in the 1895 Temple Cup , a post @-@ season series between first and second @-@ place teams of the National League . The Spiders placed second to the Orioles at the close of both the 1895 and 1896 seasons . McAleer 's performance came in spite of a serious injury he received during a game held in Philadelphia on August 24 , 1895 , when he collided with a fence . Furthermore , he balanced his achievements in sports with a foray into politics in his hometown of Youngstown . During the summer of 1895 , McAleer was promoted in the local media as a mayoral candidate , first as a Republican , and then as an independent . Further research is required to determine the depth of his involvement in politics . 
 In 1898 , when the Spiders ' owners purchased the St. Louis Browns franchise , McAleer opted to stay in Cleveland , taking a brief hiatus from baseball until the Cleveland Blues franchise joined the newly formed American League ( AL ) . During his two @-@ year absence , the Spiders lost many of their more experienced players . In 1899 , the team won 20 games and lost 134 , which is still percentage @-@ wise the worst season record in Major League history . As baseball historian Bill James noted , the Spiders were forced to cancel home games due to poor attendance and " turned the last two months of the season into a long road trip " . After a full year out of baseball in 1899 , McAleer was back in a Cleveland uniform in 1900 , in a new league , as player @-@ manager of the Cleveland Lake Shores of the fledgling American League , then a minor league . McAleer 's subsequent career as a major league manager ( 1901 – 11 ) overlapped with his playing career ( 1882 – 1907 ) . Although he did not play professionally between 1903 and 1906 , McAleer played in his last Major League game on July 8 , 1907 . 
 = = Managing career = = 
 = = = Cleveland Lake Shores / Blues = = = 
 In 1900 , McAleer became player @-@ manager of the Cleveland Lake Shores ( a predecessor of the Cleveland Indians ) and continued with the franchise in 1901 , when the American League became a major league and the club was renamed as the Blues , a name borrowed from a team that had participated in the National League during the 1870s and 1880s . The Blues made their major league debut on April 24 , 1901 , with an 8 – 2 loss to the Chicago White Sox . Two other league games were canceled due to inclement weather , and the contest between the Blues and White Sox served as the inaugural game of the AL . 
 In July of that year , McAleer presided over the Blues ' upset 6 – 1 loss to the Detroit Tigers . Although the Tigers ' manager , Tommy Burns , agreed to forfeit the game for fear that the umpire , Joe Cantillon , would be injured by an angry crowd , McAleer agreed to play the Tigers using a reserve umpire . The Blues eventually closed the season with a 54 – 82 record , placing seventh in the eight @-@ team American League . 
 McAleer , however , contributed little to this outcome . In 1901 , he played in only three games with the Blues . The AL , established in 1900 by Ban Johnson , former president of the Western League , was by this time in direct competition with the well @-@ established National League ( NL ) . McAleer , a close friend of Johnson and his associate , Charles Comiskey , played a significant role in the new league 's development , recruiting scores of experienced players from the NL . 
 = = = St. Louis Browns = = = 
 As manager of the Browns , McAleer lured players such as Hall of Famers Jesse Burkett and Bobby Wallace . In 1902 , the Browns took second place in the league , with a record of 78 wins and 58 losses . Between 1903 and 1907 , however , the team never ranked higher than fifth or sixth place in the AL . Then , in 1908 , the club rebounded , finishing just six @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half games out of first place , with a record of 83 wins and 69 losses , landing at fourth in the AL . The Browns ended the 1909 season , however , with a record of 61 – 89 , earning seventh place . McAleer was fired at the close of the season . Browns owner Robert L. Hedges , a Cincinnati carriage maker , replaced the " affable " McAleer with the " <unk> " Jack O 'Connor , who was expelled from the league in 1910 for seeking to influence the outcome of the annual batting championship . 
 = = = Washington Senators = = = 
 On September 22 , 1909 , McAleer went on to manage the Washington Senators ( popularly known as the " Nationals " ) , a team that had ceased to be competitive since the death of star hitter Ed Delahanty six years earlier . The team fared little better under McAleer 's management , finishing with a lackluster 66 – 85 record ( seventh place ) at the close of the 1910 season . The high point of the season was a game in which McAleer initiated what became a baseball tradition . On April 14 , 1910 , he asked visiting President William Howard Taft to throw out the first ball of a season opener . President Taft , an ardent fan of the game , readily agreed . Baseball historians Donald Dewey and Nicholas Acocella noted that the game " almost put an end to the career " of U.S. Vice President James S. Sherman , who " took a foul ball off the bat of Frank Baker directly in the head " . This contest also featured a one @-@ hit performance by pitcher Walter Johnson , who led the Senators to a 3 – 0 victory over the Philadelphia Athletics .

 = = = Boston Red Sox = = = 
 Toward the close of the 1911 season , McAleer announced his resignation as manager of the Senators . In 1912 , he became a major stockholder in the Boston Red Sox , purchasing a half @-@ interest in the team . That year , the Red Sox " cruised to the pennant with 105 victories " . 
 By the time the Red Sox entered the sixth game of the 1912 World Series , the team had secured a 3 – 1 lead over the New York Giants . ( The second game of the Series ended in a tie . ) Then , McAleer pressured the team 's manager , Jake Stahl , to hand the ball to unseasoned pitcher Buck O 'Brien for the " clincher " . McAleer 's recommendation was apparently part of a strategy to ensure that the seventh game of the Series would be played at Boston 's new Fenway Park . Although the Red Sox 's loss to the Giants ( at 5 – 2 ) guaranteed that the Series would conclude in Boston , the incident created conflict between McAleer and Stahl . Subsequent press releases suggesting that Stahl would replace McAleer as club president exacerbated these tensions . 
 In the seventh game of the Series , the Red Sox opened Fenway Park with a 7 – 6 victory over the Giants . The team suffered a public relations fiasco , however , when a Red Sox shareholder sold seats at the stadium that had been reserved for the club 's most ardent fans , the " Royal Rooters " . Finding themselves without seats , the Royal Rooters , led by Boston Mayor John " Honey Fitz " Fitzgerald , marched around the stadium in protest . A riot ensued , and in the aftermath of the disturbance , only 17 @,@ 000 Boston residents showed up for the final game . Nevertheless , the Red Sox emerged as victors , with a final score of 4 – 3 and one tied game . 
 Following the Series victory over the Giants , McAleer returned to his hometown to celebrate the event . A brass band met him at Youngstown 's train depot , and a parade and fireworks display were held in his honor . The Youngstown Daily Vindicator reported : " As the auto bearing Mr. McAleer turned into West Federal Street , hundreds of sticks of red fire were burning at Central Square , while the quiet atmosphere was occasionally punctured by the explosion of a bomb " . This was the last time he would publicly greet residents of his hometown as a figure in professional baseball . 
 = = = Downfall = = = 
 McAleer 's tenure as part @-@ owner of the Red Sox came to a swift end . On July 15 , 1913 , McAleer became involved in a dispute with the AL president , Ban Johnson , when McAleer forced the resignation of Red Sox manager Jake Stahl , one of Johnson 's closest friends . While McAleer claimed that he released Stahl because of a foot injury preventing Stahl from serving as a player @-@ manager , rumors suggested that the two men had strong personal differences . Following a bitter quarrel with Johnson , McAleer sold his holdings in the Red Sox . His feud with Johnson turned out to be a lifelong affair , despite efforts taken by their mutual friend , Charles Comiskey , to smooth over the rift . While McAleer never publicly discussed the disagreement that spurred his retirement , he supposedly relayed his version of events to Frank B. Ward , a sports reporter with The Youngstown Daily Vindicator , with the understanding that the details remain confidential until McAleer 's death . 
 Although other sources tell a different story , Ward wrote that McAleer termed his " break " with Johnson as the result of a " betrayal " of trust . McAleer indicated that his controlling interest in the Red Sox entitled him to make all major decisions regarding the organization , Ward wrote . This view of McAleer 's powers , however , was not shared by the club 's manager , Stahl , the article added . To further complicate matters , Stahl 's father @-@ in @-@ law , a Chicago @-@ based banker , was reportedly a shareholder in the Red Sox . After one particularly heated exchange between Stahl and McAleer at the close of the 1912 season , Stahl went to Chicago to confer with Johnson . The article indicated that , after this meeting , Johnson sent McAleer a " sternly worded " letter , which may have been designed to preserve his relationship with Stahl and Stahl 's father @-@ in @-@ law . According to the article , Johnson later confided to McAleer that he owed Stahl 's father @-@ in @-@ law money and therefore felt obliged to take Stahl 's side in the dispute . McAleer , however , took the admonition from Johnson as a betrayal of their friendship , refused to accept Johnson 's explanations , and promptly retired , Ward wrote . This version of events is largely corroborated by the early research of baseball historian David Fleitz . 
 Baseball historians Dewey and Acocella , however , described a markedly different scenario in which Johnson secretly sold off McAleer 's shares while McAleer was away on a 1913 world tour with Comiskey , New York Giants manager John McGraw , and members of the Red Sox team . According to this account , McAleer 's conflict with Stahl was followed up by his involvement in a feud between two pairs of players – Tris Speaker and Joe " Smoky Joe " Wood , on one side , and Heinie Wagner and Bill Carrigan , on the other . The conflict had a " religious dimension " and was described in the press as " pitting Masons against members of the Knights of Columbus " . McAleer evidently supported Wagner and Carrigan , the Catholic players in the dispute . These back @-@ to @-@ back incidents involving individuals associated with the Red Sox team " reinforced Johnson 's belief that the club president was the source of all the trouble " , Dewey and Acocella wrote . In his recent book , The Irish in Baseball , David Fleitz observed that McAleer 's abrupt dismissal was typical of Johnson , " who had a history of ending relationships when they no longer benefited him personally " . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Relatively little is known about McAleer 's private life . Research suggests that he was married three times , with his first marriage ( to Hannah McAleer ) taking place in the early 20th century . At some point , he married the former Anna Durbin , a native of Trenton , New Jersey . The couple had no children . According to her obituary , Anna McAleer was her husband 's " constant companion " during his " active career as a baseball magnate " . When the couple settled in Youngstown in 1913 , she participated in charity work and joined the Altar and Rosary Society at St. Columba 's Church , where she attended religious services . In 1930 , Anna McAleer died suddenly at an apartment the couple shared on the north side of Youngstown . James McAleer , who discovered his wife 's body after returning from a walk , was " overcome " . McAleer had recently been released from a local hospital following an <unk> ; he was quickly readmitted following his wife 's death . 
 A few months later , McAleer married a Youngstown woman , Georgianna Rudge , a graduate of the Juilliard School of Music who was almost 23 years her husband 's junior . Ultimately , Georgianna McAleer survived her husband by more than five decades . By the time of James McAleer 's second marriage , his health was in decline . He was hospitalized within a few months of the wedding . 
 = = Final years = = 
 McAleer returned to Youngstown , where he spent his last years . Active in the community , McAleer served on the city 's original draft board , which had been authorized under Ohio Governor James M. Cox during World War I. In retirement , the former baseball manager maintained friendships with celebrities including George M. Cohan and King Alfonso XIII of Spain . McAleer became acquainted with the Spanish monarch during a European tour with the Red Sox in the winter of 1912 – 13 . 
 His final years were marked by poor health . Several weeks before his death , McAleer was admitted to a local hospital , where his health reportedly improved . This account , however , differs from that of baseball historian David Fleitz , who suggested that McAleer had been diagnosed with cancer in the early 1930s . In any event , McAleer died suddenly on April 29 , 1931 , shortly after being released from the hospital . He was 66 years old . After private funeral services at Orr 's funeral home , McAleer 's remains were interred at Oak Hill Cemetery , on Youngstown 's near south side . Apart from his widow , he left behind two brothers , J.C. McAleer of Austintown , Ohio , and Owen McAleer of Los Angeles . Other survivors included two nephews , Captain Charlies McAleer , an officer in the U.S. Army , and James McAleer of Los Angeles . 
 Rumors persist that McAleer 's death was the result of a self @-@ inflicted gunshot wound to the head . While his name is included on some lists of Major League Baseball players who committed suicide , contemporary newspaper accounts indicated that McAleer died of natural causes . 
 New research by the baseball historian , David Fleitz , has provided a copy of McAleer 's death certificate where a " self @-@ inflicted gunshot wound " is listed as the cause of death . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 McAleer 's hometown newspaper , The Youngstown Daily Vindicator , eulogized the ex @-@ Major Leaguer in the following terms : " <unk> and resourceful , but always retiring when there was talk of his share in the development of baseball , James R. McAleer died within a matter of weeks after the passing of Byron Bancroft Johnson , his chief partner in the forming of the American League , and the man with whom he ' broke ' , which break brought about his retirement " . 
 The article praised McAleer for assisting the careers of other baseball figures . In 1905 , during his tenure as manager of the St. Louis Browns , McAleer helped future Hall of Fame umpire Billy Evans secure a position with the American League , writing a personal letter to Johnson on Evans ' behalf . Meanwhile , McAleer served as a contact for another Youngstown resident , John " <unk> " Reese , the Welsh @-@ born " baseball doctor " who worked with players such as Cy Young , Ty Cobb , Rogers Hornsby , Walter Johnson , and John McGraw . 
 McAleer 's contributions to the game failed to win him a place in the Baseball Hall of Fame , however . In 1936 , during the first elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame , he received just one vote in the balloting for 19th @-@ century figures . Nevertheless , McAleer received an unofficial endorsement from Hall of Fame second baseman Nap Lajoie , who described McAleer as " one of the best ever " . McAleer 's obituary in The New York Times suggested that he was " one of the fastest outfielders the major leagues ever produced " . In 2003 , Bill James described McAleer as " the best defensive outfielder of the 1890s " . More recently , baseball historian David Fleitz observed , " this brilliant defensive outfielder was a smart , clever , and ambitious man who helped to create two of the original eight franchises of the American League " . 
 = Gott ist mein König , BWV 71 = 
 Gott ist mein König ( God is my King ) , BWV 71 , is a cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach written in Mühlhausen when the composer was 23 years old . Unusually for an early cantata by Bach , the date of first performance is known : at the inauguration of a new town council on 4 February 1708 . 
 The text is compiled mainly from biblical sources , three different sections from Psalm 74 and several other verses . In addition , one stanza from Johann Heermann 's hymn " O Gott , du <unk> Gott " is sung simultaneously with corresponding biblical text , and free poetry by an unknown poet of Bach 's time which relates to the political occasion . The cantata in seven movements is scored festively with a Baroque instrumental ensemble including trumpets and timpani , " four separate instrumental ' choirs ' , set against a vocal consort of four singers , an optional Capelle of ripienists and an organ " . Stylistically it shares features with Bach 's other early cantatas . 
 Bach , then organist in Mühlhausen 's church Divi Blasii , led the performance on 4 February 1708 in the town 's main church , the Marienkirche . Although the cantata was planned to be performed only twice , it was printed the same year , the first of his works to be printed and the only cantata extant in print that was printed in Bach 's lifetime . 
 = = History and words = = 
 From 1707 to 1708 , Bach was the organist at one of Mühlhausen 's principal churches , Divi Blasii , dedicated to St Blaise , where he composed some of his earliest surviving cantatas . One or two early cantatas , for example Nach dir , Herr , verlanget mich , BWV 150 , may have been written at Arnstadt , his previous residence , for a performance at Mühlhausen . He composed Gott ist mein König for a church service that was held annually to celebrate the inauguration of a new town council . 
 The librettist is unknown ; it has been speculated that the text was written by Georg Christian Eilmar , minister of Marienkirche , who had earlier prompted the composition of Bach 's cantata Aus der Tiefen rufe ich , Herr , zu dir , BWV 131 . It has also been thought that Bach himself may have assembled the text , although the suggestion is unlikely since Bach 's musical setting of the final part of the text departs from its bi @-@ strophic form . There is no evidence either way to indicate the authorship of the cantata 's text . Along with other early cantatas , Gott ist mein König is of a pre @-@ Neumeister character , not featuring the combination of recitative and arias found in later cantatas . 
 The service was held on 4 February 1708 in the Marienkirche , the town 's largest church . The score indicates that Bach deployed his musicians in different locations in the building . He composed another cantata for the occasion the following year , but it is lost . 
 = = = Theme = = = 
 The text centres on Psalm 74 , with additional material drawn from the 2 Samuel , Genesis , and Deuteronomy . Unusual for Bach 's early cantatas , some contemporary unknown poet added free text that makes reference to the " new regiment " of office bearers and the Holy Roman Emperor and King of Germany , Joseph I , as Mühlhausen was an Imperial free city , thus subject immediately to the emperor . 
 There are three quotations from Psalm 74 ( Psalms 74 ) : 
 Verse 12 : " Gott ist mein König von Alters her , der alle <unk> <unk> , so auf Erden <unk> . " ( " God is my Sovereign since ancient days , who all salvation brings which on earth may be found . " – ASV version : " Yet God is my King of old , Working salvation in the midst of the earth . " ) 
 Verses 16 – 17 : " Tag und Nacht ist dein . Du <unk> , daß <unk> <unk> und <unk> ihren <unk> Lauf haben . Du <unk> einem <unk> Lande seine <unk> . " ( " Day and night are Yours . You have seen to it that both sun and planets have their certain courses . You set borders to every land . " – ASV : " The day is thine , the night also is thine : Thou hast prepared the light and the sun . Thou hast set all the borders of the earth . " ) 
 Verse 19 : " Du <unk> dem Feinde nicht geben die Seele deiner <unk> . " ( " You would not give the soul of Your turtledove to the enemy . " – ASV : " Oh deliver not the soul of thy turtle @-@ dove unto the wild beast . " ) 
 It has been suggested that these themes include a number of distinct allusions of relevance to the inhabitants of Mühlhausen . First , the reference to Psalm 74 in general , and the inclusion of verse 19 in the cantata may be making an oblique reference , accessible to contemporary audiences , to the fire of May 1707 which had destroyed parts of the city . The importance of " borders " may be an allusion to the threat to the city 's independence posed by the military campaigns of Charles XII . 
 Movement 2 combines three texts , two biblical verses and stanza 6 from Johann Heermann 's hymn " O Gott , du <unk> Gott " , which all make reference to old age . An older view suggested this was likely a reference to the septuagenarian Conrad <unk> , a member of the city council who was connected to Bach . More recent research lead to thinking that it likely refers to Adolf Strecker , the former mayor who had just left office aged 83 years , since " details of his public and private life match extremely well with the texts chosen for the cantata , and it seems likely that hearers would have recognized Strecker in them " . 
 = = Structure and scoring = = 
 Bach structured the cantata in seven movements . He scored the vocal parts for four soloists : soprano , alto , tenor and bass . The choral writing is in four parts , and the work can be sung with just four singers , the so @-@ called OVPP approach . Some performances deploy more singers in the choral sections . The use of a larger choir is partly a question of balance with the relatively large instrumental forces , but there is also supporting evidence for the use of more than four singers in the score , where a marking implies that Bach envisaged the option of a vocal ensemble that is separate from the four soloists . 
 This was Bach 's first cantata for festive orchestra , including trumpets and timpani . The instruments are divided into four spatially separated " choirs " , placing the work in the polychoral tradition associated with composers such as Heinrich Schütz . The instruments required for the Baroque instrumental ensemble are three trumpets ( Tr ) , timpani ( Ti ) , two recorders ( Fl ) , two oboes ( Ob ) , bassoon ( Fg ) , organ obbligato ( Org ) , two violins ( Vl ) , viola ( Va ) , viola da gamba ( Vg ) and basso continuo . 
 In the following table of the movements , the scoring follows the Neue Bach @-@ Ausgabe . The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred Dürr , using the symbol for common time ( 4 / 4 ) . The continuo , playing throughout , is not shown . 
 = = Music = = 
 With short movements that flow into each other , the cantata shows typical characteristics of traditional 17th @-@ century cantatas . Unlike other early cantatas , it has no instrumental introduction . John Eliot Gardiner , who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000 and performed this cantata in the Mühlhausen church where Bach was organist , notes : 
 No other work of his is laid out on such a grand scale in terms of its deployment of four separate instrumental ' choirs ' , set against a vocal consort of four singers , an optional Capelle of ripienists and an organ . 
 A model for such " theatrical splendour " were oratorios by Dieterich Buxtehude , performed in Bach 's presence at the Lübeck in 1705 .

 The opening chorus , Gott ist mein König von <unk> ( God is my King from long ago ) , is based on Psalm 74 : 12 . It begins with a chord in C major from the instruments . The first line is repeated <unk> sections and as a summary at the end , accompanied always by a trumpet fanfare . 
 = = = 2 = = = 
 An aria for tenor , Ich bin nun <unk> Jahr , warum soll dein Knecht sich mehr <unk> ?

All texts deal with old age . The section begins with the image of a descending continuo line . The tenor melody expresses sadness about the condition of old age . The chorale tune , sung with embellishments is not the most usual one for the hymn , possibly chosen to match the theme . 
 = = = 3 = = = 
 Another choral movement , Dein Alter sei wie deine Jugend , und Gott ist mit dir in allem , das du <unk> ( May your old age be like your youth , and God is with you in everything that you do ) sets more biblical passages , assuring that God is with people both old and young .

 A bass arioso sets two more verses from the psalm , Tag und Nacht ist dein ( Day and night are Yours ) .

 Another psalm verse is again set as a chorus , Du <unk> dem Feinde nicht geben die Seele deiner <unk> ( You would not give the soul of Your turtledove to the enemy ) .

 Gott ist mein König is a significant early work of Bach . It differs from the other extant cantatas from Bach 's time in Mühlhausen by its elaborate instrumentation . It was so positively received that it was the first of Bach 's works to be printed ( paid for by the city council ) ; it is the only cantata to have been printed in his lifetime , at least in a version which has survived to this day . The printing is all the more remarkable as Gott ist mein König appears to have been intended for not more than one repeat performance , and a new piece was commissioned the following year . Bach was commissioned to compose another cantata for the following year 's council inauguration ; there is evidence that the piece was composed and even printed , but no copies are known to survive .

 = Ashley Smith inquest = 
 The Ashley Smith inquest was an Ontario coroner 's inquest into the death of Ashley Smith , a teenager who died by self @-@ inflicted strangulation on 19 October 2007 while under suicide watch in custody at the Grand Valley Institution for Women . Despite guards watching her on video monitors , Smith was able to strangle herself with a strip of cloth , and it was 45 minutes before guards or supervisors entered her cell and confirmed her death . The warden and deputy warden were fired after the incident ; although the four guards and supervisors in immediate contact with Smith were initially charged with negligent homicide , those charges were withdrawn a year later . Smith 's family brought a lawsuit against the Correctional Service of Canada ( CSC ) for negligence ; this lawsuit was settled out of court in May 2011 . 
 The CBC documentary news program The Fifth Estate produced two separate episodes on the life and death of Ashley Smith . The documentaries describe the circumstances leading up to her death , as well as some disagreement inside the Correctional Service of Canada . The Fifth Estate claims " Corrections Canada filed an unprecedented publication ban on all exhibits presented at the coroner 's inquest into her death . " 
 The inquest was frequently interrupted by multiple legal challenges and a change of coroner , before finally being terminated as a mistrial on 30 September 2011 ; a new inquest into Smith 's death began on 19 September 2012 . On 2 December 2013 , the presiding coroner instructed the jury to begin their deliberations with respect to a verdict on Smith 's death . 
 On 19 December 2013 , the coroner 's jury returned a verdict of homicide in the case of Ashley Smith , and provided dozens of recommendations to the presiding judge . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Ashley Smith ( born 29 January 1988 , New Brunswick , Canada ) was adopted when she was 5 days old , and according to her adoptive parents , <unk> Smith and Herbert <unk> , had a normal childhood in Moncton , New Brunswick . Between the ages of 13 @-@ 14 , her parents noted distinct behavioural changes in the child ; by age 15 she had been before juvenile court 14 times for various minor offences such as throwing <unk> at a mailman , trespassing , and causing a disturbance . In March 2002 , Smith was assessed by a psychologist who found no evidence of mental illness . However , her behavioural problems continued and she was suspended from school multiple times in the fall of 2002 . In March 2003 , after multiple court appearances , Smith was admitted to the Pierre <unk> Centre for assessment . She was diagnosed with ADHD , learning disorder , borderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality traits . She was discharged several days early from the Centre for unruly and disruptive behaviour and returned to the New Brunswick Youth Centre ( <unk> ) . Smith was remanded to the <unk> multiple times over the next 3 years ; during this time she was involved in more than 800 reported incidents and at least 150 attempts to physically harm herself . 
 On 29 January 2006 , Ashley Smith turned 18 ; on 29 July a motion was made under the Youth Criminal Justice Act to transfer her to an adult facility . Smith hired a lawyer to fight the transfer , but was unsuccessful . On 5 October 2006 , Smith was transferred to the Saint John Regional Correctional Centre ( <unk> ) . Due to her behaviour at <unk> , Smith spent most of her time there in segregation ; she was tasered twice and pepper @-@ sprayed once . On 31 October 2006 , Smith was transferred to the Nova Institution for Women in Nova Scotia ( a federal institution ) . Through 2007 , Smith was transferred a total of 17 times among the following 8 institutions during 11 months in federal custody : 
 Nova Institution for Women , Truro , Nova Scotia 
 Joliette Institution , Joliette , Quebec 
 Regional Psychiatric Centre , Prairies , Saskatoon , Saskatchewan 
 L 'Institut Philippe @-@ Pinel de Montréal , Montreal , Quebec

 While at Grand Valley Institution for Women in Kitchener , Ontario , on 16 October 2007 , Smith requested to be transferred to a psychiatric facility ; she was placed on a formal suicide watch on 18 October . In the early hours of 19 October , Smith was videotaped placing a ligature around her neck , an act of self @-@ harm she had committed several times before . Guards did not enter her cell to intervene , and 45 minutes passed before she was examined and pronounced dead . 
 On 25 October 2007 , three guards and a supervisor at the Grand Valley Institution for Women were charged with criminal negligence causing death in relation to Smith 's suicide ; the warden and deputy warden were fired . The criminal charges were later dropped . On 8 October 2009 , Smith 's family launched a wrongful death lawsuit against the Correctional Service of Canada , demanding C $ 11 million in damages ; the suit was eventually settled out of court in May 2011 for an undisclosed amount . 
 = = Documentaries by The Fifth Estate = = 
 = = = Out of Control = = = 
 On 8 January 2010 , CBC News Network 's The Fifth Estate broadcast a documentary about the case titled Out of Control . In the documentary , reporter Hana Gartner describes Smith as a fourteen @-@ year @-@ old placed in a youth facility for one month in 2003 after throwing <unk> at the mailman . Smith was placed in solitary confinement after disruptive behaviour on her first day . Her initial one @-@ month sentence would last almost four years , entirely in isolation , until her death in 2007 . Often violent and unpredictable , her behaviours and the force required to intervene were always filmed and recorded , then listed on daily logs . Behaviour that Smith exhibited included many attempts at choking herself into unconsciousness ; guards responding were often attacked by Smith , sometimes with weapons she had manufactured and concealed . 
 The frequent " use of force " reports required to document responses became a source of concern for facility officials . According to an internal document obtained and partially read aloud by Gartner , eventually Corrections Canada administrators instructed guards and supervisors not to respond to self @-@ strangling attempts by Smith , " to ignore her , even if she was choking herself " . CSC officials kept transferring her to other facilities , preventing the implementation of a Canadian law requiring mandatory review of prisoners kept in isolation for more than sixty days . 
 After Smith 's death , and the firing of both wardens and four directly involved officers , the four officers were charged with negligent homicide . The spokesman for the union for the four guards alleged the guards were " scapegoated " by senior management : " There was daily direction given right from the highest levels of management all the way to the front line staff , and we 're not talking once or twice , we 're talking everyday , repeatedly , ' you are not to go in the cell ; this is your orders ' [ sic ] " . The union 's spokesman relayed his organization 's stance that the guards ' prosecution was part of a cover @-@ up by those in CSC management . 
 At the conclusion of the documentary , Smith 's mother raised the question of responsibility : " Who gave that order , Hana ? ... Who gave the order to keep that child , we 're talking about a child in the youth centre , segregated that length of time ? Who gave the order ' don 't intervene ' if she 's still breathing ? " The four guards saw the charges against them dropped and were reinstated to their positions ; they declined to talk to The Fifth Estate . The Corrections Service of Canada viewed the case as closed , and while the current minister did talk to Hana Gartner , CSC refused any interviews with the reporter , while a lawsuit was pending .

 = = = 2011 inquest = = = 
 The first coroner 's inquest into Smith 's suicide began in May 2011 . The inquest , initially led by deputy chief coroner Dr. Bonita Porter , was controversial ; it was originally scheduled to begin in November 2010 , but was delayed by a legal challenge by the Smith family . As a result of this challenge , the scope of the inquest was broadened to cover the entire 11 @-@ month period of Smith 's incarceration under the federal Correctional Service . Further , a panel of judges with the Ontario Divisional Court ruled in May 2011 that Dr. Porter should not have excluded video evidence of Smith 's forced sedation at the Joliette Institution in Quebec . On 21 June 2011 , the proceedings of the inquest were suspended until 12 September ; the reason for the delay was apparently to allow the proceedings to be webcast . In late June 2011 , Dr. Porter was replaced as the presiding coroner , apparently due to her impending retirement in November 2011 ; the replacement presiding coroner was Dr. John R. Carlisle . The sudden and unexpected replacement led Smith 's family to formally accuse the chief coroner of interfering in the inquest with no legal basis ; Dr. Porter had apparently indicated that she would deliver three outstanding rulings in July , days before the announcement of her replacement . The inquest resumed briefly on 12 September , only to be suspended once again until 19 September , when the Smith family lawyer challenged the right of the new coroner to continue the inquest , and called for a mistrial . On 30 September 2011 , the Ontario Coroner 's Office formally terminated the inquest and dismissed the jury . 
 = = = 2012 inquest = = = 
 A second inquest began on 20 September 2012 , opening with a hearing for those who wished to apply for standing at the proceedings . Dr. John Carlisle continued as presiding coroner , and in a lengthy ruling released on 25 September 2012 , granted standing at the inquest to Smith 's family , prison authorities , inmate advocacy groups , and a group of current and former mental @-@ health patients known as the Empowerment Council . Dr. Carlisle further widened the scope of the inquest to include the effects of long @-@ term solitary confinement , repeated transfers between institutions across the country , the role of mental health care and the management of Smith as an inmate by prison authorities , and all youth @-@ custody issues arising from Smith 's death . 
 Motion hearings for the inquest took place on 23 – 24 October 2012 . Lawyers for the Correctional Service of Canada filed a motion to seal video materials and documents related to Smith 's forced restraint and sedation while incarcerated in the Quebec prison facility ; when the motion was denied by the presiding coroner , the government lawyers requested a temporary injunction to stay the inquest proceedings through Ontario Divisional Court . This motion was also denied and the video and documentary material were made available to the inquest , which subsequently proceeded as planned . 
 Additionally , three doctors involved in Smith 's treatment during her incarceration challenged the expansion of the inquest to include events that took place outside the province of Ontario . Presiding Coroner Dr. Carlisle dismissed this motion at the same time as that of the Correctional Service of Canada motion , but subsequently granted the out @-@ of @-@ province doctors standing at the inquest when they agreed to testify voluntarily at the inquest proceedings . 
 Formal hearings for the inquest began on 13 January 2013 , and were expected to last between 6 months and a year . The jury of five women were expected to be presented with over 100 witnesses and 8000 documents in the course of the inquest . 
 On 22 January 2013 , the jurors were shown prison guard Valentino Burnett 's 45 @-@ minute video of Smith tying her neck , asphyxiating , and the guards discovery and response . When questioned about their response , Valentino admitted that " in a perfect world " , the guards would have intervened to save Smith . 
 On 2 December 2013 , after more than a year of testimony and over 12 @,@ 000 pages of evidence , the presiding coroner instructed the jury to begin their deliberations , and requested they come back with a verdict in Smith 's death and recommendations on means to prevent a recurrence of such an event . 
 On 19 December 2013 , the coroner 's jury returned a verdict of homicide in the Ashley Smith case , indicating the actions of others contributed to her death but stopping short of a finding of criminal or civil liability . The jury additionally provided 104 recommendations to the presiding coroner , most of which were intended to suggest ways in which the Canadian Correctional System could better serve female inmates and inmates suffering from mental illness . The jury specifically recommended that indefinite solitary confinement should be banned . 
 = = Political impact = = 
 In November 2012 , the Ashley Smith case began to have a visible impact on Canadian federal politics . After the public release of video material depicting Smith 's treatment while incarcerated , interim leader of the federal Liberal Party Bob Rae raised the matter in Parliament during Question Period , asking why the government was attempting to restrict the scope of the inquiry through the Corrections Canada legal challenge . Prime Minister Stephen Harper responded that the government would not interfere with the inquest , and Public Safety Minister Vic Toews later indicated that Corrections Canada officials had been directed to cooperate with the inquest . However , Toews later appeared to contradict the official government stance and drew significant criticism from the opposition Liberal and NDP Members of Parliament when he suggested that Smith was " not the victim " in the case . On 8 November , Rae called for a formal public inquiry into Smith 's treatment while incarcerated , and additionally into the treatment of mentally ill offenders by the Canadian prison system , after concluding publicly that the government would not release all the information it held relating to the Smith case . 
 Subsequent to the release of the inquest verdict on 19 December 2013 , the current Minister of Public Safety , Steven Blaney , stated that he had asked his officials to carefully review the jury 's recommendations . 
 = 1918 flu pandemic = 
 The 1918 flu pandemic ( January 1918 – December 1920 ) was an unusually deadly influenza pandemic , the first of the two pandemics involving H1N1 influenza virus . It infected 500 million people across the world , including remote Pacific islands and the Arctic , and resulted in the deaths of 50 to 100 million ( three to five percent of the world 's population ) , making it one of the deadliest natural disasters in human history . 
 Disease had already greatly limited life expectancy in the early twentieth century . A considerable spike occurred at the time of the pandemic , specifically the year 1918 . Life expectancy dropped by about 12 years . 
 Most influenza outbreaks disproportionately kill juvenile , elderly , or already weakened patients ; in contrast , the 1918 pandemic predominantly killed previously healthy young adults . Modern research , using virus taken from the bodies of frozen victims , has concluded that the virus kills through a cytokine storm ( overreaction of the body 's immune system ) . The strong immune reactions of young adults ravaged the body , whereas the weaker immune systems of children and middle @-@ aged adults resulted in fewer deaths among those groups . 
 Historical and epidemiological data are inadequate to identify the pandemic 's geographic origin . It was implicated in the outbreak of encephalitis lethargica in the 1920s . 
 To maintain morale , wartime censors minimized early reports of illness and mortality in Germany , Britain , France , and the United States ; but papers were free to report the epidemic 's effects in neutral Spain ( such as the grave illness of King Alfonso XIII ) , creating a false impression of Spain as especially hard hit — thus the pandemic 's nickname Spanish flu . In Spain , a different nickname was adopted , the Naples Soldier ( Soldado de Nápoles ) , which came from a musical operetta ( zarzuela ) titled La canción del olvido ( The Song of Forgetting ) , which premiered in Madrid during the first epidemic wave . Federico Romero , one of the librettists , quipped that the play 's most popular musical number , Naples Soldier , was as catchy as the flu .

 = = = Hypotheses about source = = = 
 Investigative work by a British team led by virologist John Oxford of St Bartholomew 's Hospital and the Royal London Hospital identified a major troop staging and hospital camp in Étaples , France , as almost certainly being the center of the 1918 flu pandemic . A significant precursor virus , harbored in birds , mutated to pigs that were kept near the front . 
 Earlier hypotheses of the epidemic 's origin have varied . Some hypothesized the flu originated in East Asia . Dr. C. <unk> , leading expert of the 1918 flu for the Institut Pasteur , asserted the former virus was likely to have come from China , mutating in the United States near Boston and spreading to Brest , France , Europe 's battlefields , Europe , and the world using Allied soldiers and sailors as main spreaders . He considered several other hypotheses of origin , such as Spain , Kansas , and Brest , as being possible , but not likely . Historian Alfred W. Crosby speculated the flu originated in Kansas . Popular writer John Barry echoed Crosby in describing Haskell County , Kansas , as the likely point of origin . 
 Political scientist Andrew Price @-@ Smith published data from the Austrian archives suggesting the influenza had earlier origins , beginning in Austria in the spring of 1917 . 
 Historian Mark Humphries of Canada 's Memorial University of Newfoundland states that newly unearthed records confirm that one of the side stories of the war , the mobilization of 96 @,@ 000 Chinese laborers to work behind the British and French lines on World War I 's western front , may have been the source of the pandemic . In the new report , Humphries finds archival evidence that a respiratory illness that struck northern China in November 1917 was identified a year later by Chinese health officials as identical to the Spanish flu . 
 A scientific investigation published in 2016 found no evidence that the 1918 virus was imported to Europe from Chinese and Southeast Asian soldiers and workers . In fact , there is evidence that the virus had been circulating in the European armies for months and potentially years before the 1918 pandemic . 
 = = = Spread = = = 
 When an infected person sneezes or coughs more than half a million virus particles can be spread to those close by . The close quarters and massive troop movements of World War I hastened the pandemic and probably both increased transmission and augmented mutation ; the war may also have increased the lethality of the virus . Some speculate the soldiers ' immune systems were weakened by malnourishment , as well as the stresses of combat and chemical attacks , increasing their susceptibility . 
 A large factor in the worldwide occurrence of this flu was increased travel . Modern transportation systems made it easier for soldiers , sailors , and civilian travelers to spread the disease . 
 In the United States , the disease was first observed in Haskell County , Kansas , in January 1918 , prompting local doctor Loring Miner to warn the U.S. Public Health Service 's academic journal . On 4 March 1918 , company cook Albert <unk> reported sick at Fort Riley , Kansas . By noon on 11 March 1918 , over 100 soldiers were in the hospital . Within days , 522 men at the camp had reported sick . By 11 March 1918 the virus had reached Queens , New York . Failure to take preventative measures in March / April was later criticised . 
 In August 1918 , a more virulent strain appeared simultaneously in Brest , France ; in Freetown , Sierra Leone ; and in the U.S. in Boston , Massachusetts . The Allies of World War I came to call it the Spanish flu , primarily because the pandemic received greater press attention after it moved from France to Spain in November 1918 . Spain was not involved in the war and had not imposed wartime censorship . 
 = = Mortality = = 
 = = = Around the globe = = = 
 The global mortality rate from the 1918 / 1919 pandemic is not known , but an estimated 10 % to 20 % of those who were infected died . With about a third of the world population infected , this case @-@ fatality ratio means 3 % to 6 % of the entire global population died . Influenza may have killed as many as 25 million people in its first 25 weeks . Older estimates say it killed 40 – 50 million people , while current estimates say 50 @-@ 100 million people worldwide were killed . 
 This pandemic has been described as " the greatest medical holocaust in history " and may have killed more people than the Black Death . It is said that this flu killed more people in 24 weeks than AIDS has killed in 24 years , more in a year than the Black Death killed in a century . 
 The disease killed in every corner of the globe . As many as 17 million died in India , about 5 % of the population . The death toll in India 's British @-@ ruled districts alone was 13 @.@ 88 million . 
 In Japan , of the 23 million people who were affected , 390 @,@ 000 died . In the Dutch East Indies ( now Indonesia ) , 1 @.@ 5 million were assumed to have died among 30 million inhabitants . In Tahiti 13 % of the population died during only a month . Similarly , in Samoa 22 % of the population of 38 @,@ 000 died within two months . 
 In the U.S. about 28 % of the population suffered , and 500 @,@ 000 to 675 @,@ 000 died . Native American tribes were particularly hard hit . In the Four Corners area alone , 3 @,@ 293 deaths were registered among Native Americans . Entire village communities perished in Alaska . In Canada 50 @,@ 000 died . In Brazil 300 @,@ 000 died , including president Rodrigues Alves . In Britain , as many as 250 @,@ 000 died ; in France , more than 400 @,@ 000 . In West Africa an influenza epidemic killed at least 100 @,@ 000 people in Ghana . Tafari <unk> ( the future Haile Selassie , Emperor of Ethiopia ) was one of the first Ethiopians who contracted influenza but survived , although many of his family 's subjects did not ; estimates for the fatalities in the capital city , Addis Ababa , range from 5 @,@ 000 to 10 @,@ 000 , or higher . In British Somaliland one official estimated that 7 % of the native population died . 
 This huge death toll was caused by an extremely high infection rate of up to 50 % and the extreme severity of the symptoms , suspected to be caused by cytokine storms . Symptoms in 1918 were so unusual that initially influenza was misdiagnosed as dengue , cholera , or typhoid . One observer wrote , " One of the most striking of the complications was hemorrhage from mucous membranes , especially from the nose , stomach , and intestine . Bleeding from the ears and petechial hemorrhages in the skin also occurred " . The majority of deaths were from bacterial pneumonia , a secondary infection caused by influenza , but the virus also killed people directly , by causing massive hemorrhages and edema in the lung . 
 The unusually severe disease killed up to 20 % of those infected , as opposed to the usual flu epidemic mortality rate of 0 @.@ 1 % . 
 = = = Patterns of fatality = = = 
 An unusual feature of this pandemic was that it mostly killed young adults . In 1918 – 1919 , 99 % of pandemic influenza deaths in the US occurred in people under 65 , and nearly half in young adults 20 to 40 years old . In 1920 the mortality rate among people under 65 had decreased six @-@ fold to half the mortality rate of people over 65 , but still 92 % of deaths occurred in people under 65 . This is noteworthy , since influenza is normally most deadly to weak individuals , such as infants ( under age two ) , the very old ( over age 70 ) , and the immunocompromised . In 1918 , older adults may have had partial protection caused by exposure to the 1889 – 1890 flu pandemic , known as the Russian flu . According to historian John M. Barry , the most vulnerable of all – " those most likely , of the most likely " , to die – were pregnant women . He reported that in thirteen studies of hospitalized women in the pandemic , the death rate ranged from 23 % to 71 % . Of the pregnant women who survived childbirth , over one @-@ quarter ( 26 % ) lost the child . 
 Another oddity was that the outbreak was widespread in the summer and autumn ( in the Northern Hemisphere ) ; influenza is usually worse in winter . 
 Modern analysis has shown the virus to be particularly deadly because it triggers a cytokine storm , which ravages the stronger immune system of young adults . 
 In fast @-@ progressing cases , mortality was primarily from pneumonia , by virus @-@ induced pulmonary consolidation . Slower @-@ progressing cases featured secondary bacterial pneumonias , and there may have been neural involvement that led to mental disorders in some cases . Some deaths resulted from malnourishment . 
 A study conducted by He et al. used a mechanistic modelling approach to study the three waves of the 1918 influenza pandemic . They tried to study the factors that underlie variability in temporal patterns , and the patterns of mortality and morbidity . Their analysis suggests that temporal variations in transmission rate provide the best explanation and the variation in transmission required to generate these three waves is within biologically plausible values . 
 Another study by He et al. used a simple epidemic model , to incorporate three factors including : school opening and closing , temperature changes over the course of the outbreak , and human behavioral changes in response to the outbreak to infer the cause of the three waves of the 1918 influenza pandemic . Their modelling results showed that all three factors are important but human behavioral responses showed the largest effects . 
 = = = Deadly second wave = = = 
 The second wave of the 1918 pandemic was much deadlier than the first . The first wave had resembled typical flu epidemics ; those most at risk were the sick and elderly , while younger , healthier people recovered easily . But in August , when the second wave began in France , Sierra Leone and the United States , the virus had mutated to a much deadlier form . 
 This increased severity has been attributed to the circumstances of the First World War . In civilian life , natural selection favours a mild strain . Those who get very ill stay home , and those mildly ill continue with their lives , preferentially spreading the mild strain . In the trenches , natural selection was reversed . Soldiers with a mild strain stayed where they were , while the severely ill were sent on crowded trains to crowded field hospitals , spreading the deadlier virus . The second wave began and the flu quickly spread around the world again . Consequently , during modern pandemics health officials pay attention when the virus reaches places with social upheaval ( looking for deadlier strains of the virus ) . 
 The fact that most of those who recovered from first @-@ wave infections were now immune showed that it must have been the same strain of flu . This was most dramatically illustrated in Copenhagen , which escaped with a combined mortality rate of just 0 @.@ 29 % ( 0 @.@ 02 % in the first wave and 0 @.@ 27 % in the second wave ) because of exposure to the less @-@ lethal first wave . On the rest of the population it was far more deadly now ; the most vulnerable people were those like the soldiers in the trenches – young previously healthy adults . 
 = = = Devastated communities = = = 
 Even in areas where mortality was low , so many were incapacitated that much of everyday life was hampered . Some communities closed all stores or required customers to leave orders outside . There were reports that the health @-@ care workers could not tend the sick nor the gravediggers bury the dead because they too were ill . Mass graves were dug by steam shovel and bodies buried without coffins in many places . 
 Several Pacific island territories were particularly hard @-@ hit . The pandemic reached them from New Zealand , which was too slow to implement measures to prevent ships carrying the flu from leaving its ports . From New Zealand , the flu reached Tonga ( killing 8 % of the population ) , Nauru ( 16 % ) and Fiji ( 5 % , 9 @,@ 000 people ) . 
 Worst affected was German Samoa , today the independent state of Samoa , which had been occupied by New Zealand in 1914 . A crippling 90 % of the population was infected ; 30 % of adult men , 22 % of adult women and 10 % of children died . By contrast , the flu was kept away from American Samoa when Governor John Martin Poyer imposed a blockade . In New Zealand itself , 8 @,@ 573 deaths were attributed to the 1918 pandemic influenza , resulting in a total population fatality rate of 0 @.@ 74 % . 
 = = = Less @-@ affected areas = = = 
 In Japan , 257 @,@ 363 deaths were attributed to influenza by July 1919 , giving an estimated 0 @.@ 425 % mortality rate , much lower than nearly all other Asian countries for which data are available . The Japanese government severely restricted maritime travel to and from the home islands when the pandemic struck . 
 In the Pacific , American Samoa and the French colony of New Caledonia also succeeded in preventing even a single death from influenza through effective quarantines . In Australia , nearly 12 @,@ 000 perished . 
 By the end of the pandemic , only one major region on Earth had not reported an outbreak : the isolated island of Marajó , in Brazil 's Amazon River Delta . 
 = = = Aspirin poisoning = = = 
 In a 2009 paper published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases , Karen Starko proposed that aspirin poisoning had contributed substantially to the fatalities . She based this on the reported symptoms in those dying from the flu , as reported in the post mortem reports still available , and also the timing of the big " death spike " in October 1918 which happened right after the Surgeon General of the United States Army , and the Journal of the American Medical Association both recommended very large doses of 8 @.@ 0 @-@ 31 @.@ 2 g of aspirin per day . Starko also suggests that the wave of aspirin poisonings was due to a " perfect storm " of events : Bayer 's patent on aspirin expired , so that many companies rushed in to make a profit and greatly increased the supply ; this coincided with the flu pandemic ; and the symptoms of aspirin poisoning were not known at the time . 
 As an explanation for the universally high mortality rate , this hypothesis was questioned in a letter to the journal published in April 2010 by Andrew <unk> and Daisy <unk> of the University of California , Irvine , and Niall Johnson of the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care . They questioned this universal applicability given the high mortality rate in countries such as India , where there was little or no access to aspirin at the time . They concluded that " the salicylate [ aspirin ] poisoning hypothesis [ was ] difficult to sustain as the primary explanation for the unusual virulence of the 1918 – 1919 <unk> pandemic " . 
 But they overlooked that inexpensive aspirin had become available in India and other places after October 1918 , when the Bayer patent expired . In responding , Starko pointed to anecdotal evidence of aspirin over @-@ prescription in India and argued that even if aspirin over @-@ prescription had not contributed to the high Indian mortality rate , it could still have been a major factor for other high rates in areas where other exacerbating factors present in India played less of a role . 
 = = = End of the pandemic = = = 
 After the lethal second wave struck in late 1918 , new cases dropped abruptly – almost to nothing after the peak in the second wave . In Philadelphia , for example , 4 @,@ 597 people died in the week ending 16 October , but by 11 November , influenza had almost disappeared from the city . One explanation for the rapid decline of the lethality of the disease is that doctors simply got better at preventing and treating the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus , although John Barry stated in his book that researchers have found no evidence to support this . 
 Another theory holds that the 1918 virus mutated extremely rapidly to a less lethal strain . This is a common occurrence with influenza viruses : there is a tendency for pathogenic viruses to become less lethal with time , as the hosts of more dangerous strains tend to die out . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Academic Andrew Price @-@ Smith has made the argument that the virus helped tip the balance of power in the later days of the war towards the Allied cause . He provides data that the viral waves hit the Central Powers before they hit the Allied powers , and that both morbidity and mortality in Germany and Austria were considerably higher than in Britain and France . 
 In the United States , Britain and other countries , despite the relatively high morbidity and mortality rates that resulted from the epidemic in 1918 – 1919 , the Spanish flu began to fade from public awareness over the decades until the arrival of news about bird flu and other pandemics in the 1990s and 2000s . This has led some historians to label the Spanish flu a " forgotten pandemic " . 
 Various theories of why the Spanish flu was " forgotten " include the rapid pace of the pandemic , which killed most of its victims in the United States , for example , within a period of less than nine months , resulting in limited media coverage . The general population was familiar with patterns of pandemic disease in the late 19th and early 20th centuries : typhoid , yellow fever , diphtheria , and cholera all occurred near the same time . These outbreaks probably lessened the significance of the influenza pandemic for the public . In some areas , the flu was not reported on , the only mention being that of advertisements for medicines claiming to cure it . 
 In addition , the outbreak coincided with the deaths and media focus on the First World War . Another explanation involves the age group affected by the disease . The majority of fatalities , from both the war and the epidemic , were among young adults . The deaths caused by the flu may have been overlooked due to the large numbers of deaths of young men in the war or as a result of injuries . When people read the obituaries , they saw the war or postwar deaths and the deaths from the influenza side by side . Particularly in Europe , where the war 's toll was extremely high , the flu may not have had a great , separate , psychological impact , or may have seemed a mere extension of the war 's tragedies . 
 The duration of the pandemic and the war could have also played a role . The disease would usually only affect a certain area for a month before leaving , while the war , which most had initially expected to end quickly , had lasted for four years by the time the pandemic struck . This left little time for the disease to have a significant impact on the economy . 
 One final issue that the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak had on the world was the effects on the global economy . Many businesses in the entertainment and service industries suffered losses in revenue , but the health care industry reported profit gains . 
 Historian Nancy Bristow has argued that the pandemic , when combined with the increasing number of women attending college , contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing . This was due in part to the failure of medical doctors , who were predominantly men , to contain and prevent the illness . Nursing staff , who were predominantly women , felt more inclined to celebrate the success of their patient care and less inclined to identify the spread of the disease with their own work . 
 In Spain , sources from the period explicitly linked the Spanish flu to the cultural figure of Don Juan . The nickname for the flu , the " Naples Soldier , " was adopted from Federico Romero and Guillermo Fernández Shaw 's operetta , The Song of Forgetting ( La canción del olvido ) , the protagonist of which is a stock Don Juan type . Davis has argued the Spanish flu @-@ Don Juan connection served a cognitive function , allowing Spaniards to make sense of their epidemic experience by interpreting it through a familiar template — the Don Juan story . 
 = = Spanish flu research = = 
 The origin of the Spanish flu pandemic , and the relationship between the near @-@ simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine , have been controversial . One hypothesis is that the virus strain originated at Fort Riley , Kansas , in viruses in poultry and swine which the fort bred for food ; the soldiers were then sent from Fort Riley around the world , where they spread the disease . Similarities between a reconstruction of the virus and avian viruses , combined with the human pandemic preceding the first reports of influenza in swine , led researchers to conclude the influenza virus jumped directly from birds to humans , and swine caught the disease from humans . 
 Others have disagreed , and more recent research has suggested the strain may have originated in a nonhuman , mammalian species . An estimated date for its appearance in mammalian hosts has been put at the period 1882 – 1913 . This ancestor virus diverged about 1913 – 1915 into two clades ( or biological groups ) , which gave rise to the classical swine and human H1N1 influenza lineages . The last common ancestor of human strains dates to between February 1917 and April 1918 . Because pigs are more readily infected with avian influenza viruses than are humans , they were suggested as the original recipients of the virus , passing the virus to humans sometime between 1913 and 1918 . 
 An effort to recreate the 1918 flu strain ( a subtype of avian strain H1N1 ) was a collaboration among the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology , Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory and Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City . The effort resulted in the announcement ( on 5 October 2005 ) that the group had successfully determined the virus 's genetic sequence , using historic tissue samples recovered by pathologist Johan <unk> from a female flu victim buried in the Alaskan permafrost and samples preserved from American soldiers . 
 On 18 January 2007 , <unk> & et al . ( 2007 ) reported that monkeys ( Macaca fascicularis ) infected with the recreated strain exhibited classic symptoms of the 1918 pandemic , and died from a cytokine storm — an overreaction of the immune system . This may explain why the 1918 flu had its surprising effect on younger , healthier people , as a person with a stronger immune system would potentially have a stronger overreaction . 
 On 16 September 2008 , the body of British politician and diplomat Sir Mark Sykes was exhumed to study the RNA of the flu virus in efforts to understand the genetic structure of modern H5N1 bird flu . Sykes had been buried in 1919 in a lead coffin which scientists hoped to have helped preserve the virus . However , the coffin was found to be split because of the weight of soil over it , and the cadaver was badly decomposed . Nonetheless , samples of lung and brain tissue were taken through the split , with the coffin remaining in situ in the grave during this process . 
 In December 2008 , research by Yoshihiro <unk> of the University of Wisconsin linked the presence of three specific genes ( termed PA , PB1 , and PB2 ) and a nucleoprotein derived from 1918 flu samples to the ability of the flu virus to invade the lungs and cause pneumonia . The combination triggered similar symptoms in animal testing . 
 In June 2010 , a team at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine reported the 2009 flu pandemic vaccine provided some cross @-@ protection against the 1918 flu pandemic strain . 
 One of the few things known for certain about the influenza in 1918 and for some years after was that it was , out of the laboratory , exclusively a disease of human beings . 
 In 2013 , AIR 's Research and Modeling Group " characterizes the historic 1918 pandemic and estimates the effects of a similar pandemic occurring today using the AIR Pandemic Flu Model " .

 The television show Resurrection uses the pandemic , in the episode " Afflictions " that aired on November 2 , 2014 , as the explanation for why many of the Returned were getting sick and disappearing . 
 In season four of British drama Upstairs , Downstairs , Hazel Bellamy dies of Spanish flu in 1918 , after her husband James Bellamy survives injuries in the " Great War " ( World War I ) . Her funeral takes place on 11 November , the day the war ends . 
 In season two of British drama Downton Abbey , Lavinia Swire dies of the Spanish flu in April 1919 , after her fiancé Matthew Crawley recovers from injuries and temporary paralysis from the Great War . 
 Twentieth @-@ century fiction includes at least three novels with the flu pandemic as a major theme : Katherine Anne Porter 's Pale Horse , Pale Rider , Thomas Mullen 's The Last Town on Earth , and Thomas Wolfe 's Look Homeward , Angel . 
 In the play 1918 by Horton Foote , the presence and threat of the flu ( and the tragedy it ultimately causes ) is a major element of the plot . The 1979 play was made into a film ( 1918 flu pandemic at the Internet Movie Database ) , released in 1985 , which was subsequently edited for broadcast by PBS as the last part of the miniseries " The Story of A Marriage " .

 The Fifth Ward Wardroom was constructed and used as a polling place and meeting hall in a critical time when Pawtucket was incorporated as a city before later being used as a school and eventually a legion post . At the time it was nominated to the National Historic Register , the house was undergoing renovations to become a private single family residence . Prior to its conversion it was the Henrietta I. Drummond Post No. 50 of the American Legion . According to public records , the house remains a private residence .

 The Fifth Ward Wardroom is historically significant as a historical reminder of the pivotal time in which Pawtucket was incorporated as a city and gave up its town @-@ meeting form of governance . The building is also architecturally significant as a rare type of building , wardrooms , and is one of three extant examples in Rhode Island . William R. Walker & Son constructed three such structures in Pawtucket with the First Ward Wardroom being extant and the third example having been demolished . Though both constructed by William R. Walker & Son , the two Pawtucket wardrooms are related , but not identical in construction and show variations by the firm . Another wardroom , with a bungalow style , is located in the Cato Hill Historic District in Woonsocket , Rhode Island . The Fifth Ward Wardroom was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 . 
 = Musca = 
 Musca ( Latin : fly ) is a small constellation in the deep southern sky . It was one of twelve constellations created by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman and it first appeared on a 35 @-@ cm ( 14 in ) diameter celestial globe published in 1597 ( or 1598 ) in Amsterdam by Plancius and Jodocus Hondius . The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in Johann Bayer 's Uranometria of 1603 . It was also known as Apis ( Latin : bee ) for two hundred years . Musca remains below the horizon for most Northern Hemisphere observers . 
 Many of the constellation 's brighter stars are members of the Scorpius – Centaurus Association , a loose group of hot blue @-@ white stars that appear to share a common origin and motion across the Milky Way . These include Alpha , Beta , Gamma , Zeta2 and ( likely ) Eta Muscae , as well as HD <unk> , a blue @-@ white Herbig Ae / Be star that is surrounded by a complex debris disk containing a large planet or brown dwarf and possible protoplanet . Two further star systems have been found to have planets . The constellation also contains two Cepheid variables visible to the naked eye . Theta Muscae is a triple star system , the brightest member of which is a Wolf – Rayet star . 
 = = History = = 
 Musca was one of the twelve constellations established by the Dutch astronomer Petrus Plancius from the observations of the southern sky by the Dutch explorers Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman , who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition , known as the Eerste Schipvaart , to the East Indies . De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue in 1598 under the Dutch name De <unk> , " The Fly " . They assigned four stars to the constellation , with a star that would be later designated as Beta Muscae marking the head , Gamma the body , and Alpha and Delta the left and right wings respectively . It first appeared on a 35 @-@ cm ( 14 in ) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius , though was unnamed . The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in the German cartographer Johann Bayer 's Uranometria of 1603 , though Bayer termed it Apis — the Bee , a name by which it was known for the next two centuries . A 1603 celestial globe by Willem Blaeu depicts it as providing nourishment for the nearby constellation <unk> — its tongue trying to catch the insect . 
 The French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille called it la Mouche on the 1756 version of his planisphere of the southern skies . Jean Fortin retained the French name in 1776 for his Atlas Céleste , while Lacaille Latinised the name for his revised Coelum Australe <unk> in 1763 . Lacaille renamed it to Musca Australis , the Southern Fly — Australis , since it <unk> the now discarded constellation of Musca Borealis composed of a few stars in Aries , and to avoid confusion with Apus . Today the name is simply Musca . It is the only official constellation depicting an insect . 
 The <unk> people of Mato Grosso state in Brazil called Alpha and Beta Muscae ( along with Beta and Kappa Crucis ) <unk> <unk> " Ornate Hawk @-@ Eagle 's double flutes " . The Wardaman people of the Northern Territory in Australia perceived the main stars of Musca as a ceremonial boomerang , part of the Central Arena — a sacred area surrounding the constellation Crux that depicts the lightning creation beings and where they teach Wardaman customs ; Alpha and Beta also signified a ceremonial headband , while Gamma and Delta represented two armbands . In Central Australia , the Arrernte and Luritja people living in on a mission in Hermannsburg viewed the sky as divided between them , east of the Milky Way representing Arrernte camps and west denoting Luritja camps . The stars of Musca , along with Fomalhaut , Alpha Pavonis , and Alpha and Beta Gruis were all claimed by the Arrernte .

 Musca is bordered by Crux to the north , Carina to the west , <unk> to the south , Apus and Circinus to the east and Centaurus to the northeast . Covering 138 square degrees and 0 @.@ 335 % of the night sky , it ranks 77th of the 88 constellations in size . The three @-@ letter abbreviation for the constellation , as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922 , is ' Mus ' . The official constellation boundaries , as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930 , are defined by a polygon of six segments . In the equatorial coordinate system , the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between 11h <unk> and 13h <unk> , while the declination coordinates are between − 64 @.@ 64 ° and − 75 @.@ 68 ° . The whole constellation is visible to observers south of latitude 14 ° N.

 Lacaille charted and designated ten stars with the Bayer designations Alpha through to Kappa in 1756 . He catalogued stars that became Lambda and Mu but did not designate them as he considered them <unk> as they lay outside the asterism proper . Baily considered them part of Musca , and Gould gave them their Bayer designations . Francis Baily also dropped Kappa , which he felt was too faint to warrant a name , and designated two adjacent stars as Zeta1 and Zeta2 . These last two stars are 1 ° apart , quite far to be sharing a Bayer designation . Lacaille had originally labelled the fainter one as Zeta , while Baily presupposed he 'd meant to label the brighter one . Reluctant to remove Lacaille 's designation , he gave them both the Zeta designation . Altogether there are 62 stars brighter than magnitude 6 @.@ 5 in the constellation . 
 The pattern of the brightest stars resembles that of Ursa Minor , in that the stars form a pattern reminiscent of a bowl with a handle .

Yet another member of the Lower Centaurus Crux subgroup , HD <unk> is a young blue @-@ white Herbig Ae / Be star of spectral type B9V that has yet to settle on the main sequence — the closest of these stars to Earth at around 320 light @-@ years distant . It is surrounded by a circumstellar debris disk from a distance of 0 @.@ 2 to 4 AU , and again from 13 AU out to a few hundred AU , with evidence for a protoplanet forming at a distance of around 47 AU . There is a gap between 4 and 13 AU , which appears to contain a large planet around 20 times the mass of Jupiter , although further examination of the disk profile indicates it might be a more massive object such as a brown dwarf or more than one planet . LP 145 @-@ 141 is a white dwarf located 15 light @-@ years distant — the fourth @-@ closest to the Solar System .

 = Staffa = 
 Staffa ( Scottish Gaelic : <unk> , pronounced [ s ̪ t ̪ <unk> ] ) from the Old Norse for stave or pillar island , is an island of the Inner Hebrides in Argyll and Bute , Scotland . The Vikings gave it this name as its columnar basalt reminded them of their houses , which were built from vertically placed tree @-@ logs . 
 Staffa lies about 10 kilometres ( 6 mi ) west of the Isle of Mull . The area is 33 hectares ( 82 acres ) and the highest point is 42 metres ( 138 ft ) above sea level . 
 The island came to prominence in the late 18th century after a visit by Sir Joseph Banks . He and his fellow @-@ travellers extolled the natural beauty of the basalt columns in general and of the island 's main sea cavern , which Banks renamed ' Fingal 's Cave ' . Their visit was followed by those of many other prominent personalities throughout the next two centuries , including Queen Victoria and Felix Mendelssohn . The latter 's Hebrides Overture brought further fame to the island , which was by then uninhabited . It is now in the care of the National Trust for Scotland . 
 = = Geology and pre @-@ history = = 
 In prehistoric times Staffa was covered by the ice sheets which spread from Scotland out into the Atlantic Ocean beyond the Outer Hebrides . After the last retreat of the ice around 20 @,@ 000 years ago , sea levels were up to 125 metres ( 410 ft ) lower than at present . Although the isostatic rise of land makes estimating post @-@ glacial coastlines a complex task , around 14 @,@ 000 years ago it is likely that Staffa was part of a larger island , just off the coast of mainland Scotland , which would have included what are now Mull , Iona and the Treshnish Isles . 
 Steadily rising sea levels then further isolated this little island , which is entirely of volcanic origin . It consists of a basement of tuff , underneath colonnades of a black fine @-@ grained Tertiary basalt , overlying which is a third layer of basaltic lava without a crystalline structure . By contrast , slow cooling of the second layer of basalt resulted in an extraordinary pattern of predominantly hexagonal columns which form the faces and walls of the principal caves . The lava contracted towards each of a series of equally spaced centres as it cooled and solidified into prismatic columns , a process known as columnar jointing . The columns typically have three to eight sides , six being most common . The columns are also divided horizontally by cross joints . These columnar jointed sections represent the tops and bottoms of individual lava flows . Between these sections lie regions of much more chaotic jointing , known as the entablature . The origin of the entablature is unknown , but could be due to flooding of the lava flow , causing much more rapid cooling , or the interaction of stress fields from the two regions of columnar jointing as they approach one another . 
 Similar formations are found at the Giant 's Causeway in Northern Ireland , on the island of Ulva and at <unk> on the Isle of Mull . Grooves in the roof of MacKinnon 's cave indicate either a pyroclastic flow or a series of eroded ash falls in the rock above the columnar basalt . The ' Staffa Group ' is the name given to the series of olivine <unk> basalts found in the vicinity of Mull which erupted 55 – 58 million years ago . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Staffa lies about 10 kilometres ( 6 mi ) west of Mull , and 9 km northeast of Iona . It is longitudinally oriented north @-@ south , and is a kilometre long by about half a kilometre wide . The circumference is about 3 @.@ 8 km in extent . In the northeast the isle shelves to a shore , but otherwise the coast is rugged and much indented ; numerous caves have been carved out by rain , streams and sea . There is enough grass to feed a few cattle , and the island has a spring . 
 On the east coast are Goat Cave and Clamshell Cave . The latter is 10 m high , about 6 m wide at the entrance , and some 45 m long , and on one side of it the ridges of basalt stand out like the ribs of a ship . Near this cave is the pyramidal rock islet of Am <unk> ( ' The Herdsman ' ) , a pile of basalt columns seen fully only at low tide . Other outlying rocks include Eilean Dubh to the north @-@ west and a series of skerries stretching for half a kilometre to the south @-@ west . On the southwest shore are Boat Cave and Mackinnon 's Cave ( named after a 15th @-@ century abbot of Iona ) , which has a tunnel connecting it to Cormorant Cave . These caves lie to the south @-@ west and can be accessed from the bay of Port an <unk> at low tide . In 1945 a mine exploded near Boat Cave , causing damage to the cliff face which is still visible . Mackinnon 's Cave is 107 metres long . 
 Staffa 's most famous feature is Fingal 's Cave , a large sea cave located near the southern tip of the island some 20 m high and 75 m long formed in cliffs of hexagonal basalt columns . This cliff face is called the Colonnade or The Great Face and it was these cliffs and their caves that inspired Felix Mendelssohn 's Die <unk> ( English : Hebrides Overture opus 26 ) , which was premiered in London in 1832 . The original Gaelic name for Fingal 's Cave is An Uamh <unk> – " the melodious cave " – but it was subsequently renamed after the 3rd @-@ century Irish warrior Fionn MacCool . Mendelssohn was nonetheless inspired by the sound of the waves in the cave and waxed lyrical about his visit , claiming that he arrived in Scotland " with a rake for folk @-@ songs , an ear for the lovely , fragrant countryside , and a heart for the bare legs of the natives . " 
 Staffa is part of the Loch Na Keal National Scenic Area , one of 40 in Scotland .

 = = = 18th century = = = 
 Little is known of the early history of Staffa , although the Swiss town of <unk> on Lake Zurich was named after the island by a monk from nearby Iona . Part of the Ulva estate of the <unk> from an early date until 1777 , it was brought to the English @-@ speaking world 's attention after a visit by Sir Joseph Banks in August 1772 . En route to Iceland in the company of the painter Johann Zoffany , the Bishop of Linköping , and a Dr. Solander , Banks ( later a president of the Royal Society ) was entertained by Maclean of <unk> , on the Isle of Mull . Hearing about Staffa he resolved to visit and set out from Tobermory the next day . The winds were light and they did not arrive until darkness had fallen . Banks wrote : 
 It was too dark to see anything , so we carried our tent and baggage near the only house on the island , and began to cook our suppers , in order to be prepared for the earliest dawn , and to enjoy that which , from the conversation of the gentlemen we had , now raised the highest expectations of . 
 They were not disappointed . Despite becoming infested with lice during his short stay on the island , he provided glowing reports of his visit . He confessed that he was : 
 forced to acknowledge that this piece of architecture , formed by nature , far surpasses that of the Louvre , that of St. Peter at Rome , all that remains of Palmyra and <unk> , and all that the genius , the taste and the luxury of the Greeks were capable of inventing . 
 Samuel Johnson and his protege James Boswell visited clan MacQuarrie on Ulva in 1773 , the year after Banks ' visit . Perhaps aware that Banks considered that the columnar basalt cliff formations on Ulva called " The Castles " rivalled Staffa 's Johnson wrote : 
 When the islanders were reproached with their ignorance or insensibility of the wonders of Staffa , they had not much to reply . They had indeed considered it little , because they had always seen it ; and none but philosophers , nor they always , are struck with wonder otherwise than by novelty . 
 Amongst the first eminent overseas visitors to Staffa were Barthélemy Faujas de Saint @-@ Fond , a wealthy French zoologist and mineralogist and the American architect and naturalist William Thornton . Visiting in 1784 , they were suitably impressed , <unk> writing : " this superb monument of nature , which in regard to its form bears so strong a resemblance to a work of art , though art can certainly claim no share in it . " 
 = = = 19th and 20th centuries = = = 
 Subsequently a stream of famous visitors came to view Staffa 's wonders including Robert Adam , Sir Walter Scott ( 1810 ) , John Keats ( 1818 ) , J. M. W. Turner , whose 1830 visit yielded an oil painting exhibited in 1832 , William Wordsworth ( 1833 ) , Jules Verne ( 1839 ) , Alice Liddell ( the inspiration for Alice in Wonderland ) in 1878 , David Livingstone ( 1864 ) , Robert Louis Stevenson ( 1870 ) and Mendelssohn himself in 1829 . Wordsworth , however , found the volume of tourism disappointing . 
 Writing more than a century later the writer W. H. Murray agreed , complaining that the visitors spoiled the " character and atmosphere " , and rather stand @-@ <unk> suggesting that " to know Staffa one must go alone " . 
 Others were more enthusiastic , despite the presence of numerous others . Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were rowed into the cave in the royal barge in 1847 , and The Times correspondent recorded : 
 As the Royal Squadron cleared out of the Sound of Mull , and round the northern extremity of the island , a noble prospect lay before it , the steep and barren headlands of Ardnamurchan stretching away into the Atlantic on the right , on the left the precipitous cliffs of the Mull coast , and far away and <unk> in the ocean , the fantastic and varied forms of the adjacent islands . The horizon toward the north was a good deal obscured by haze , but , notwithstanding , Skye was distinctly visible ... The deserted and solitary aspect of the island was brought out with a strange and startling effect by the presence of so many steamers ; and as Her Majesty 's barge with the Royal Standard floated into the cave , the crew dipping their oars with the greatest precision , nothing could be more animated and grand than the appearance which the vast basaltic entrance , so solemn in its proportions , presented . 
 Keats complained about the expense of the ferry , but was captivated by what he saw nonetheless . Displeased with his first efforts to describe this " cathedral of the sea " he finally settled on : 
 Not Aladdin <unk> / Ever such a work began , Not the wizard of the Dee , Ever such a dream could see ; Not St John , in Patmos Isle , In the passion of his toil , When he saw the churches seven , Golden <unk> 'd , built up in heaven , <unk> at such a rugged wonder . <unk> Keats , Staffa

 However inspiring the scenery , it was not an easy place in which to live . In 1772 there was only a single family , living on a diet of barley oats , flax and potatoes , and whatever their grazing animals could provide . By the end of the 18th century they had deserted Staffa , apparently terrified by the severity of winter storms . Signs of " rig and furrow " agriculture can still be seen on the island but the only surviving building is the ruin of a 19th @-@ century shelter for travellers . By 1800 the island was under the ownership of Colin MacDonald of <unk> . In 1816 it was sold by his son Ranald MacDonald into the care of Trustees . In 1821 these Trustees sold to Alexander Forman as Trustee , the purchase money being paid by his brother John Forman WS . It remained in the Forman family until sold by Bernard Gilpin Vincent " Pat " Forman in 1968 . There were several private owners after that , including Alastair de <unk> , a descendant of Colin MacDonald who wrote a book about the island , until finally it was gifted to the National Trust for Scotland by Jock Elliott Jr. of New York in 1986 to honour the 60th birthday of his wife , Eleanor . A grateful National Trust bestowed upon her the honorific " Steward of Staffa " . In a 2005 poll of Radio Times readers , Staffa was named as the 8th greatest natural wonder in Britain . 
 During the 20th century there were issues of bogus postage stamps bearing Staffa 's name . 
 = = Wildlife = = 
 In 1800 there were three red deer on the island , later replaced by goats and then by a small herd of black cattle . Subsequently the summer grazing was used for sheep by crofters from Iona , but in 1997 all livestock was removed . This has led to a regeneration of the island 's vegetation . 
 Puffins , black @-@ legged kittiwakes common shags and gulls nest on the island , and the surrounding waters provide a livelihood for numerous seabirds , gray seals , dolphins , basking sharks , minke , and pilot whales .

 Boat trips from Oban , Ulva Ferry and <unk> on Mull , and Iona allow visitors to view the caves and the puffins that nest on the island between May and September . 
 There is a landing place used by the tourist boats just north of Am <unk> , but disembarkation is only possible in calm conditions . The island lacks a genuine anchorage . 
 = Sphecius grandis = 
 Sphecius grandis , also called the western cicada killer , is a species of cicada killer wasp ( Sphecius ) . The western species shares the same nesting biology as its fellow species , the eastern cicada killer ( S. speciosus ) . S. grandis , like all other species of the genus Sphecius , mainly provides cicadas for its offspring . It forms nest aggregations and mates and broods once in a year , in July and early August . The wasp is on average 3 cm ( 1 in ) to 5 cm ( 2 in ) in length and is amber @-@ yellow with yellow rings on its abdomen . 
 Wasps in the genus Sphecius are not habitually aggressive and use their venom mainly to paralyse cicadas which they take back to their nests to feed their young . The females catch around four or more cicadas for provisioning , place them in brood cells and lay eggs in the cells . S. grandis is endemic to Central America , Mexico and the Western United States , and is found at a higher mean altitude than other species of Sphecius . The western cicada killer males emerge earlier than females , but generally die after only a couple of days . 
 Sphecius grandis can be distinguished from S. convallis ( the Pacific cicada killer wasp ) by the coloration pattern of the gastral tergites . Formerly , the two species were distinguished on the basis of the number of tergites with yellow markings ( five in S. grandis and three in S. convallis ) , but a more recent study showed that this character was insufficient to distinguish the two species . However , they can be distinguished by the density of the <unk> on the first and second tergites . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The western cicada killer was first described by American naturalist Thomas Say in 1824 in Madera Canyon , Arizona , as <unk> grandis . Its species name is the Latin adjective grandis meaning " large " . It is one of five species of the genus Sphecius in North America . 
 More recently , it has been suspected that the western cicada killer represents more than one species . It co @-@ occurs with the eastern cicada killer ( S. speciosus ) and Pacific cicada killer ( S. convallis ) at Big Bend National Park in Texas . There the three wasps hunt and nest in the same locales , and the eastern and western cicada killers hunt the same cicada species . Analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed that the western cicada killer contains two divergent clades , which may represent distinct species . The two clades appeared to be split by the Rocky Mountains , with one occurring mainly to the south and east , the other to the west . 
 = = Description = = 
 Ranging in size from 3 to 5 cm ( 1 to 2 in ) in length , the western cicada killer is very similar to its eastern cousin , Sphecius speciosus , with a rufous black hue to the body , amber stripes and a yellow abdomen . The western cicada killer has rufous spots on its first to second tergites and yellow markings can generally be found from first to fifth , although there is some variation . On average , female forewing length lies between 2 @.@ 5 and 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 98 and 1 @.@ 18 in ) . Females are larger than males and live for a year , a time just long enough to produce a brood , whereas the males die in only a few days , just enough time to impregnate a female . In Steven J. Phillips ' book A Natural History of the Sonoran Desert , he referred to them as superficially resembling " huge yellowjackets or hornets " and stated that they are " powerful fliers with compound eyes " . On average , males weigh 95 mg and females are far heavier , at 256 mg , probably because of the additional weight of the ovaries , developing eggs and nutritional reserves . Nevertheless , the ratio between flight muscle mass and body mass is the same for both sexes . 
 = = = Identification = = = 
 Distinguishing S. grandis from the other four New World species of Sphecius ( S. convallis , S. <unk> , S. speciosus , S. spectabilis ) is difficult . The female S. convallis was originally distinguished from the female S. grandis by the yellow marks from the first to third gastral tergites on S. convallis and yellow marks on all tergites for S. grandis . However , this was found to be insufficient for correct identification because the positions of the markings can vary among different wasps of the same species . 
 Charles W. Holliday and Joseph R. Coelho devised a new key in 2004 to identify the Sphecius species , examining 4 @,@ 451 wasps among the five New World species , and noting that 98 % of the female S. convallis wasps examined had yellow markings on gastral tergites one to four ( or fewer ) and S. grandis had 98 % yellow markings from tergites one to five ( or more ) . The 2 % percent of S. grandis that overlapped with S. convallis were determined by density of the <unk> in colour of the first tergum against the second . The markings on S. grandis males were found to be the same as on females . 
 = = = Thermoregulation = = = 
 It has been found that the western cicada killer wasp is capable of thermoregulation which enables them to maintain territories during the day . A study by Joseph R. Coelho showed that during territorial patrolling the species had a high and regulated thorax temperature . Experiments found that the wasp has the ability to shift heat from its thorax to its abdomen and that the abdomen is generally kept colder than the thorax . Dead wasps that were placed in the sun reached abnormally high temperatures when compared to those on nearby plants .

 After hatching , the offspring feed on the tissue of the cicadas provided by their mother . Males emerge before females and both genders are sexually receptive from emergence in July to early August , when they mate and brood . English naturalist Charles Darwin postulated that the pattern of male emergence before females evolved by natural selection to improve the chances of the male mating . The timing of the emergence of females has evolved to correspond with the similar emergence of the cicada species of the area , Tibicen <unk> and T. <unk> , which they hunt for the provisioning of their nests . Many have yellow markings located on their tergites ( dorsal portion ) , although some have been found only from the first to fifth tergites . 
 Because males emerge earlier than females , the males compete for mating territories surrounding the nests in which the females are located . During a fight , the males risk damaging their wings or appendages by butting and grappling . Another defense technique is to grab another male and carry it high into the air , which is thought to be a demonstration of strength . As a general rule , the larger the male the more predominant he is in battles . Age influences the success in the defense and security of territory ; the younger the wasp the greater the chance of a successful takeover of territory . Some small males even engage in non @-@ territorial mating tactics , and delay their emergence so as to have a fairer chance of survival . 
 On emergence from the nest , the female is sexually receptive but does not choose her mate , but instead copulates with the first male of her species that finds her . Once the female has mated , she rebuffs all advances by other wasps . 
 = = = Nesting and perching = = = 
 Males perch after emerging from their nest . They pick out an area close to a nest with females inside and guard the territory around it so as to have a better chance of mating . They tend to perch on many different substrates such as stumps , pebbles , wood , weeds , grass blades and low tree branches . Males assume an alert posture , ready for a challenge from another male , or from a predator . One study by a behavioral ecologist , John Alcock , showed that a large majority of the marked wasps returned to the same perch day after day , and two males swapped between two different sites . The species rarely perches on the ground . 
 It shares the same nesting biology as S. speciosus . All cicada killers are ground @-@ nesting insects and nest aggregations can contain up to hundreds of nests , each with a single provisioning female . Their tunnel is mainly made in well @-@ drained , bare sandy soil , frequently under sidewalks , but is generally in full sunlight . Approximately 90 % of its life is spent underground as a larva . It rarely infests grounds that are rich in vegetation in order for them to get more sun . Mounds are easily recognizable by their distinctive U @-@ shaped digging entrance . 
 = = = Feeding and hunting habits = = = 
 Sphecius grandis has very similar nesting and feeding habits to other members of its genus , most notably Sphecius speciosus . As with S. speciosus , the female hunts for cicadas in low tree trunks , helped by the calls of the cicada males , and paralyses the insect by piercing the central nervous system with her stinger . She drags the cicadas back to her nest to place them in brood cells in which she eventually lays one egg per cell . Females carry cicadas that are on average 88 % heavier than their own body mass . It has been hypothesised that cicada killers may also have the ability to capture cicadas mid @-@ flight . There are approximately two or more cicadas to each brood cell . When the larvae hatch , the cicada provides nutrition for the offspring to feed on . 
 The wasps preferentially hunt for female cicadas because they have more consumable tissue , but male cicadas are easier to locate , which explains the systemic bias towards male kills . They chiefly hunt for Tibicen <unk> , Tibicen dealbata and Tibicen <unk> . Cicada killers are capable of thermoregulation , which allows them to hunt for cicadas during the day , when the cicadas are most prominent . The species is mostly harmless to humans . Some males when emerging early fly into the trees to feed on sap , and the species has been known to feed on nectar . 
 Stings of this species received a lethality rating of 46 LC measured by LC = μg ⁄ LD50 ( LC = " lethal capacity " , μg = " venom in the insect " , LD50 = " μg ⁄ g of the venom " , g = " size of mammal receiving the dose " and LD = " lethal dose " ) . 
 = = Geographical distribution = = 
 Western cicada killers are found at a higher altitude than most other Sphecius species and are sympatric with the species S. convallis and S. speciosus , even though S. grandis are on average found at higher altitudes than S. convallis . A study showed that the mean elevation for S. grandis was 755 m ± 23 @.@ 3 m , compared with the lower results of S. speciosus ( 219 m ± 4 @.@ 7 m ) , S. convallis ( 582 m ± 30 @.@ 9 m ) and S. <unk> ( 18 m ± 5 m ) . The species is Nearctic and Neotropic , found from Central America to the Western United States , in New Mexico , California and every state west of the Rocky Mountains , except Wyoming , as well as Kansas , Oklahoma and Nebraska . S. grandis is most commonly found in riparian zones . It has been observed in such places in Mexico as Baja California Norte , Baja California Sur , Coahuila , Nuevo Leon , Tamaulipas and Yucatán and also in Granada ( Nicaragua ) , Guanacaste ( Costa Rica ) and Honduras . 
 = = Interaction with humans = = 
 Sphecius grandis wasps frequently interact with humans because of their tendency to make their nests in backyards , gardens and sidewalks . Pest control is mostly unneeded as they nest in areas with little to no vegetation , usually ignore people , and females are not aggressive , tending to save their venom for their cicada prey , but will sting if they are grabbed or stepped on . Despite their large size , being the largest wasp to inhabit California , their sting has been reported as being between merely numbing and sharp to moderate . Males , while smaller , are naturally more aggressive and less tolerant of disturbance . 
 = Lolita Lebrón = 
 Lolita Lebrón ( November 19 , 1919 – August 1 , 2010 ) was a Puerto Rican nationalist who was convicted of attempted murder and other crimes after leading an assault on the United States House of Representatives in 1954 , resulting in the wounding of five members of the United States Congress . She was freed from prison in 1979 after being granted clemency by President Jimmy Carter . 
 Lebrón was born and raised in Lares , Puerto Rico , where she joined the Liberal Party . In her youth she met Francisco Matos Paoli , a Puerto Rican poet , with whom she had a relationship . In 1941 , Lebrón migrated to New York City , where she joined the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party , gaining influence within the party 's leadership . Within the organization she advocated socialist and feminist ideas . 
 In 1952 , after the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico was promulgated , the Nationalist Party began a series of revolutionary actions , including the Jayuya Uprising . As part of this initiative , Pedro Albizu Campos ordered her to organize attacks in the United States , focusing on locations that were " the most strategic to the enemy " . She became the leader of a group of nationalists , who attacked the United States House of Representatives in 1954 . She was incarcerated as a result . Lebrón remained imprisoned 25 years , when President Carter issued pardons to the group involved . After their release in 1981 , the nationalists returned to Puerto Rico , where independence movements received them with a celebration . During the following years she continued her involvement in pro @-@ independence activities , including the Navy @-@ Vieques protests . Her life would be subsequently detailed in books and a documentary . On August 1 , 2010 , Lebrón died from complications of a cardiorespiratory infection . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Lebrón ( birth name : Dolores Lebrón Sotomayor ) was one of five siblings born in Lares , Puerto Rico to Gonzalo Lebrón Bernal and Rafaela Soto Luciano , the other four were Aurea , Augusto , Gonzalo Jr. and Julio . Lebrón was raised in Hacienda Pezuelas in Pezuelas , a barrio in Lares . Gonzalo Lebrón worked as the hacienda 's foreman earning a salary of $ 30 a month and was allowed to live in a " small house " where he was also allowed to plant produce for his family . 
 In Pezuelas Lebrón began her education in a small community school . Early in her life , Lebrón contracted pneumonia when she accidentally fell into a gutter that was full of water , as a consequence she grew with a frail body and was unable to keep up with the constant activities of her brothers without feeling fatigue . She developed an introverted and contemplative personality , often spending her time admiring nature around the hacienda . 
 From Pezuelas the family moved to <unk> , also in Lares , where Gonzalo Lebrón administered an hacienda owned by Emilio <unk> . There she received a better education , attending a local public school . When Lebrón completed the sixth grade she attended the Segunda Unidad Rural , a middle school located in Bartolo , an adjacent barrio . She concluded her formal public school education in the eighth grade . 
 Lebrón had uncommonly good looks and when she was a teenager won the first place in the annual " Queen of the Flowers of May " beauty contest held in Lares . Although her father was an atheist , Lebrón was baptized in the Catholic faith when she was fourteen years old along with her other siblings . During the baptism celebration she met Francisco Matos Paoli , who became her first boyfriend . Paoli and Lebron wrote letters to each other where they exchanged the poetry which they wrote . According to <unk> Arroyo , Lolita wrote " more mystical poetry , centered on what she called “ visions ” filled with religious symbolism . " Paoli 's family opposed their relationship because they considered Lebrón a <unk> ( peasant ) . Her father also opposed this relationship and ordered her to stop writing to Paoli . However , they both continued to write to each other until he moved out of the city . 
 Lebrón eventually moved to San Juan , where she studied sewing and continued her correspondence with Paoli . She felt obligated to return to Lares because her father was severely affected by tuberculosis . The family was forced to abandon the house in the hacienda , but was later received by Ramón Santiago who provided them with a new house . 
 Lebrón took upon herself the responsibility of taking care of her father . She would travel to a nearby town to buy medicines for her father which she gave him every seventy minutes . For seven days she didn 't sleep or eat while attending him . Following his death Lebrón began working by weaving clothes . 
 = = Political activism = = 
 Although Lebrón was a member of the Liberal Party from a young age , she didn 't display any interest in politics . However , her posture changed after March 21 , 1937 , when a group of militants from the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party were killed during a peaceful protest which became known as the Ponce massacre . Lebrón who was eighteen years old at the time , developed a nationalistic ideology following this event . During this timeframe , Lebrón had a relationship with a local engineer , following the advice of her family . When she was twenty @-@ one years old she gave birth to her first daughter Gladys , who was left in Rafaela Luciano 's custody after Lebrón was separated from her husband and moved to New York City . After she arrived in New York City , she started to experience problems finding employment , mostly because she did not fully understand English . Lebrón worked as a seamstress in several factories . She was fired from some of her jobs because she was considered a " rebel by her bosses " after she protested against the discrimination which she witnessed against Puerto Rican workers . This influenced her nationalistic views even further and she eventually established contact with members of the Puerto Rican Liberation Movement . She enrolled at George Washington College , where she studied for two years during her free time from work . She married again when she was twenty @-@ two years old and gave birth to her second child , whom she would send to Puerto Rico to live with her mother , a year later . Lebrón decided to divorce her husband because she felt that he was oppressing her . In 1943 , there was a massive migration of Puerto Ricans from Puerto Rico to New York , composed mostly of <unk> seeking employment . Lebrón grew increasingly frustrated when she observed how they were forced to live in poverty and under social decadence and she increased her work within nationalist circles . In 1946 , she formally became a member of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party , following the advice of a friend . During this time she developed an admiration for the Party 's president Pedro Albizu Campos , studying and memorizing his biography and ideals . After joining the party , Lebrón inadvertently included some of her own initiatives within the organization 's ideals , these were influenced by socialist and feminist ideals . Seeking more involvement in society and politics for women , new economic systems and social reforms that would protect women and children . Her constant involvement in the party 's affairs earned her several high @-@ ranking positions , among them those of secretary , vice @-@ president , and executive delegate of its delegation in New York . 
 On May 21 , 1948 , a bill was introduced before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the independence and nationalist movements in the island . The Senate at the time was controlled by the PPD and presided by Luis Muñoz Marín approved the Bill . The Bill , also known as the " Ley de la Mordaza " ( gag Law ) , made it illegal to display a Puerto Rican flag , to sing a patriotic tune , to talk of independence , and to fight for the independence of the island . The Bill which resembled the anti @-@ communist Smith Law passed in the United States , was signed and made into law on June 10 , 1948 , by the <unk> governor of Puerto Rico , Jesús T. Piñero and became known as " Ley 53 " ( Law 53 ) . In accordance to the new law , it would be a crime to print , publish , sale , to exhibit or organize or to help anyone organize any society , group or assembly of people whose intentions are to paralyze or destroy the insular government . Anyone accused and found guilty of disobeying the law could be sentenced to ten years of prison , be fined $ 10 @,@ 000 ( US ) or both . According to Dr. Leopoldo Figueroa , a member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives , the law was repressive and was in violation of the First Amendment of the US Constitution which guarantees Freedom of Speech . He pointed out that the law as such was a violation of the civil rights of the people of Puerto Rico . 
 On November 1 , 1950 , following a series of uprisings in Puerto Rico which included the Jayuya Uprising and the Utuado Uprising which culminated in a massacre , Oscar Collazo and Griselio Torresola invaded Harry S. Truman 's residence , carrying a letter written by Albizu Campos and addressed to Truman . A shootout erupted between the duo and the guard stationed there , killing Torresola . Collazo was badly injured but survived and was sentenced to death by an American jury . The Puerto Rican Nationalist Party claimed that their goal was to " draw attention to the fact of Puerto Rico 's continued colonial status " , while the American government and media treated it as an assassination attempt . Following the sentence , Lebrón quickly joined the " Committee for Oscar Collazo 's defense " , participating in numerous public manifestations which eventually led to a presidential pardon . On July 25 , 1952 , the official name of Puerto Rico was changed to Estado Libre Associado ( commonwealth of the United States ) as a constitution was promulgated by Luis Muñoz Marín , the islands ' first elected governor . In 1954 , Lebrón received a letter from Albizu Campos , in which he declared his intention to order attacks on " three locations , the most strategic to the enemy " . 
 = = Assault on the House of Representatives = = 
 = = = Attack preparations = = = 
 Albizu Campos had been corresponding with 34 @-@ year @-@ old Lebrón from prison and chose a group of nationalists who included Rafael Cancel Miranda , Irving Flores and Andrés Figueroa Cordero to attack locations in Washington , D.C. Upon receiving the order she communicated it to the leadership of the Nationalist party in New York and , although two members unexpectedly disagreed , the plan continued . Lebrón decided to lead the group , even though Albizu Campos did not order her to directly take part in the assault . She studied the plan , determining the possible weaknesses , concluding that a single attack on the House of Representatives would be more effective . The date for the attack on the House of Representatives was to be March 1 , 1954 . This date was chosen because it coincided with the inauguration of the <unk> Interamericana ( Interamerican Conference ) in Caracas . Lebrón intended to call attention to Puerto Rico 's independence cause , particularly among the Latin American countries participating in the conference . 
 = = = The attack = = = 
 On the morning of March 1 , Lebrón traveled to Grand Central Terminal , where she rendezvoused with the rest of the group . Once they arrived at the United States Capitol , Rafael Cancel Miranda suggested that the attack should be postponed because it was late and rainy . Lebrón responded , " I am alone " and continued towards the building 's interior . The group followed , considering the attack a coup d 'état , the most important revolutionary act in the history of the Puerto Rican independence movement , the fourth uprising after the Grito de Lares , the Intentona de Yauco and the Jayuya Uprising . The other members of the group seemed serene and optimistic while rushing towards the legislative chamber . ( p . 136 ) 
 When Lebrón 's group reached the visitor 's gallery above the chamber in the House , they sat while the representatives discussed Mexico 's economy . Shortly thereafter , Lebrón gave the order to the other members , the group quickly recited the Lord 's Prayer ; then Lebrón stood up and shouted " ¡ Viva Puerto Rico Libre ! " ( " Long live a Free Puerto Rico ! " ) and unfurled the flag of Puerto Rico . The group opened fire with semi @-@ automatic pistols . Lebrón claimed that she fired her shots at the ceiling , while Figueroa 's pistol jammed . Some 30 shots were fired ( mostly by Cancel , according to his account ) , wounding five lawmakers ; one representative , Alvin Bentley from Michigan , was seriously wounded in the chest . Upon being arrested , Lebrón yelled " I did not come to kill anyone , I came to die for Puerto Rico ! " . 
 = = = Trial and imprisonment = = = 
 Lebrón and her comrades were charged with attempted murder and other crimes . She was imprisoned in the Federal Correctional Institution for Women in Alderson , West Virginia . The trial began on June 4 , 1954 , with judge Alexander <unk> presiding over the case , under strict security measures . A jury composed of seven men and five women was assembled , their identities were kept secret from the media . 
 The prosecution was led by Leo A. Rover , as part of this process 33 witnesses testified . Ruth Mary Reynolds , the " American Nationalist " and the organization which she founded " American League for Puerto Rico 's Independence " came to the defense of Lebrón and the three other Nationalists . Lebrón and the other members of the group were the only defense witnesses , as part of her testimony she reaffirmed that they " came to die for the liberty of her homeland " . 
 During the early part of their trial she remained calm , complaining through her lawyers alleged disrespect for the flag while it was being produced as evidence . She loudly protested when the defense suggested that the group might have suffered from mental instability while committing the deed . On June 16 , 1954 , the jury found all four defendants guilty . On the morning of July 8 , 1954 , Lebrón learned of her son 's death minutes before the sentence was to be announced . She was quiet at the beginning of the hearing , but at one point , unable to contain herself , she became hysterical . Rover demanded the death penalty , but <unk> chose to sentence them to the longest terms of imprisonment possible . In Lebrón 's case this was between sixteen and fifty years , depending on her behavior . 
 Back at the prison , she went into shock upon receiving official notice of her son 's death and did not speak for three days . On July 13 , 1954 , the four nationalists were taken to New York , where they pleaded not guilty to the charges of " trying to overthrow the government of the United States " . One of the witnesses for the prosecution was Gonzalo Lebrón Jr . , who testified against his sister . On October 26 , 1954 , judge Lawrence E. Walsh found all the defendants guilty of conspiracy and sentenced them to six additional years in prison . 
 Lebrón has stated that the first two years in prison were the most difficult , having to deal with the deaths of her son and mother . Communication with her siblings was non @-@ existent . Lebrón refused to accept letters from her sister because only letters written in English were permitted in the prison . Communication with the outside world was not allowed then . Later it was granted after several inmates went on a hunger strike that lasted three and a half days . Due to her participation , Lebrón was not allowed to perform work outside of her cell for some time , although she was eventually allowed to work at the infirmary . While in prison , a group of judges offered her parole in exchange for a public apology , which she indignantly rejected . 
 After completing the first 15 years of the sentence , Lebrón 's social worker told her that she could ask for parole , but she did not display interest in the proposal , never signing the required documentation . Due to this lack of interest , she was mandated to attend a meeting before a penitentiary committee , where she presented a written deposition expressing her position about the parole proposal as well as other subjects including terrorism , politics and the United States ' use of the atomic bomb . Following this the other inmates reacted with skepticism over her intentions to refuse the offer , which made her distance herself from them and focus her attention in studying as well as writing poetry . During this timeframe , Lebrón 's interest in religion grew . Lebrón 's daughter Gladys died in 1977 , while her mother was in prison . 
 = = Later years , death and legacy = = 
 In 1979 President Jimmy Carter pardoned Lolita Lebrón , Irving Flores , and Rafael Cancel Miranda after they had served 25 years in prison . Andrés Figueroa Cordero was released from prison earlier because of a terminal illness . Governor of Puerto Rico Carlos Romero Barceló publicly opposed the pardons granted by Carter , stating that it would encourage terrorism and undermine public safety . Lebrón received a heroine 's welcome by her supporters upon her return to her motherland . Lebrón married Sergio Irizarry Rivera and continued to participate in pro @-@ independence activities . The couple had met while she was in prison , when the Nationalist Party ordered him to monitor her health . Their marriage took place eight years after they had met . They moved into a small house in Loiza . The house possessed few distinctive traits , mostly composed of religious iconography and a large flag of Puerto Rico in the living room . On September 4 , 2005 , the couple was transported to a hospital , after a fire affected part of their house , causing $ 14 @,@ 000 in material losses . On May 22 , 2000 , she erroneously filed charges of verbal assault against <unk> Hernández , the mother of then @-@ Puerto Rico Senator Kenneth McClintock who subsequently served as Minority Leader , and later President , of the Senate of Puerto Rico and now serves as Secretary of State , after a discussion ensued between her and an unidentified woman at a pharmacy in San Juan . The case was reported after an employee of the establishment identified the instigator as Hernández , who was recuperating from surgery at the moment and died two months later . 
 She continued to be active in the independence cause and participated in the protests against the United States Navy 's presence in Vieques . Lebrón appeared as a witness at the " International Tribunal on Violations of Human Rights in Puerto Rico and Vieques " held on November 17 – 21 , 2000 , on the island of Vieques . According to the local newspaper El <unk> , her audience applauded when Lebrón said at the end of her deposition " I had the honor of leading the act against the U.S. Congress on March 1 , 1954 , when we demanded freedom for Puerto Rico and we told the world that we are an invaded nation , occupied and abused by the United States of America . I feel very proud of having performed that day , of having answered the call of the motherland " . On June 26 , 2001 , Lebrón was among a group of protesters that were arrested for trespassing in the restricted area in Vieques . On July 19 , 2001 , she was sentenced to 60 days of prison on the charge that she was trespassing on Navy property . Lebrón had already served 23 days in jail since her June arrest , leaving her to serve 37 additional days . Less than two years after Lebron 's Vieques protest , on May 1 , 2003 , the U.S. Navy left Vieques and turned over its facilities to the government of Puerto Rico . Following this , she continued her participation in other pro independence activities . Lebrón was among the political leaders that opposed the Democratic Party 's primary that took place on June 1 , 2008 . The group anticipated a low voter turnout in the event , while declaring that Puerto Rico " deserves sovereignty " . On June 10 , 2008 , Lebrón suffered a fracture in her hip and a wrist after accidentally falling in her house . She underwent corrective surgery at a San Juan hospital . A film inspired by Lebrón 's life is currently in the works , with actress Eva Longoria being involved . 
 Between 2008 and 2010 , Lebrón was hospitalized multiple times , the first being due to a fall that fractured her hip and an arm , requiring surgery . On September 18 , 2009 , she suffered a notable relapse due to a cardio respiratory affection . Lebrón recovered in a satisfactory manner and issued a press release in appreciation for the public 's support . Complications from this episode of bronchitis , however , persisted throughout 2010 , leading to her death on August 1 , 2010 . Multiple public figures , who support independence or free association for Puerto Rico , immediately lamented Lebrón 's death , praising her activism . Her life was eulogized even in European papers .

 Among the homages received by Lebrón are paintings , books and a documentary . Mexican artist Octavio Ocampo created a poster of Lebrón , which was exhibited at the Galería de la Raza in San Francisco , California . In Chicago 's Humboldt Park , there is a mural depicting Lebrón among other well known Puerto Ricans . Writer , director and film producer Judith Escalona is planning to make a film about Lebrón 's life . Federico Ribes Tovar published a book titled Lolita la <unk> . 
 There is a plaque , located at the monument to the Jayuya Uprising participants in Mayagüez , Puerto Rico , honoring the women of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party . Lebron 's name is on the first line of the third plate . 
 Among the books that include the story of Lebrón are The Ladies ' Gallery : A Memoir of Family Secrets by Irene Vilar ( Lebrón 's granddaughter ) , translated by Gregory Rabassa ( formerly published as A Message from God in the Atomic Age ) . The author criticizes her grandmother as a distant , gun @-@ toting , larger @-@ than @-@ life figure who cast a veil of pain and secrecy over her family so vast that Ms. Vilar is still untangling herself from it . It also documents the death of Lebrón 's only daughter ( Vilar 's mother ) as suicide . 
 = Haflinger = 
 The Haflinger , also known as the Avelignese , is a breed of horse developed in Austria and northern Italy ( namely the South Tyrol region ) during the late nineteenth century . Haflinger horses are relatively small , are always chestnut in color , have distinctive gaits described as energetic but smooth , and are well @-@ muscled yet elegant . The breed traces its ancestry to the Middle Ages ; there are several theories for its origin . Haflingers , developed for use in mountainous terrain , are known for their hardiness . Their current conformation and appearance are the result of infusions of bloodlines from Arabian and various European breeds into the original native Tyrolean ponies . The foundation sire , 249 Folie , was born in 1874 ; by 1904 the first breeders ' cooperative was formed . All Haflingers can trace their lineage back to Folie through one of seven bloodlines . World Wars I and II , as well as the Great Depression , had a detrimental effect on the breed , and lower @-@ quality animals were used at times to save the breed from extinction . During World War II , breeders focused on horses that were shorter and more draft @-@ like , favored by the military for use as packhorses . The emphasis after the war shifted toward animals of increased refinement and height . 
 In the postwar era , the Haflinger was indiscriminately crossed with other breeds and some observers feared the breed was in renewed danger of extinction . However , starting in 1946 , breeders focused on producing purebred Haflingers and a closed stud book was created . Interest in the breed increased in other countries and between 1950 and 1974 the population grew , even while the overall European horse population decreased . Population numbers continued to increase steadily and as of 2005 , almost 250 @,@ 000 Haflingers existed worldwide . There are breeding farms in several countries , although most of the breeding stock still comes from Austria . In 2003 , a Haflinger became the first horse to be cloned , resulting in a filly named Prometea . 
 Haflingers have many uses including light draft , harness work and various under @-@ saddle disciplines such as endurance riding , dressage , equestrian vaulting and therapeutic riding . They are also still used by the Austrian and German armies for work in rough terrain . The World Haflinger Federation ( WHF ) , the international governing body that controls breed standards for the Haflinger , is made up of a confederation of 22 national registries , and helps set breeding objectives , guidelines and rules for its member organizations . 
 = = Breed characteristics = = 
 The name " Haflinger " comes from the village of Hafling , which today is in northern Italy . The breed is also called the Avelignese , from the Italian word for Hafling , which is <unk> or previously <unk> . Haflingers are always chestnut in color and come in shades ranging from a light gold to a rich golden chestnut or liver hue . The mane and tail are white or flaxen . The height of the breed has increased since the end of World War II , when it stood an average of 13 @.@ 3 hands ( 55 inches , 140 cm ) . The desired height today is between 13 @.@ 2 and 15 hands ( 54 and 60 inches , 137 and 152 cm ) . Breeders are discouraged from breeding horses under the minimum size , but taller individuals may pass inspection if they otherwise meet requirements of the breed registry . The breed has a refined head and light poll . The neck is of medium length , the withers are pronounced , the shoulders sloping and the chest deep . The back is medium @-@ long and muscular , the croup is long , slightly sloping and well @-@ muscled . The legs are clean , with broad , flat knees and powerful hocks showing clear definition of tendons and ligaments . The Haflinger has rhythmic , ground @-@ covering gaits . The walk is relaxed but energetic . The trot and canter are elastic , energetic , and athletic with a natural tendency to be light on the forehand and balanced . There is some knee action , and the canter has a very distinct motion forwards and upwards . One important consideration in breeding during the second half of the 20th century was temperament . A requirement for a quiet , kind nature has become part of official breed standards and is checked during official inspections . Some sources recognize two types of Haflinger , a shorter , heavier type used for draft work and a taller , lighter type used for pleasure riding , light driving and under @-@ saddle competition . The Food and Agriculture Organization recognizes both an " Avelignese " and an " Avelignese <unk> " as existing in Italy , although , as of 2007 , only 13 of the latter existed , including only one breeding stallion . However , all breed organizations recognize and register only one type . 
 = = = Stallion lines = = = 
 All Haflingers today trace their lineage through one of seven stallion lines to Folie , the foundation stallion of the breed . Usually , colts are given a name beginning with the letter or letters denoting their stallion line , and fillies are given a name beginning with the first letter of their dam 's name . The exceptions are France , where foals are given a name beginning with a letter of the alphabet designated to be used for that year ; and Italy , where colts ' names must begin with the letter or letters designating the stallion line , while fillies ' names begin with the letter designated for a given year . The seven stallion lines are : 
 A @-@ line . Founded by Anselmo , born 1926 . One of the most prevalent lines today , descendants include the second @-@ largest number of stallions at stud . Anselmo was brought back to stud at the age of 21 , when a lack of stallions after World War II led to concerns that the line would not survive , and produced several stallions now represented in all Haflinger breeding populations worldwide . 
 B @-@ line . Founded by Bolzano , born 1915 . Bolzano 's less common line , although strong in Austria , is not prevalent elsewhere . The line is spreading nevertheless ; the U.S. and several European countries including Great Britain are establishing Bolzano lines . 
 M @-@ line . Founded by Massimo , born 1927 . An Italian stallion , Massimo founded a line that is prevalent in Austria and Italy . 
 N @-@ line . Founded by <unk> , born 1920 . Early in its history , the <unk> line split into two branches , one in Italy and one in Austria . The N @-@ line is populous , with the greatest number of stallions at stud . It is one of two ( the other being the A @-@ line ) with a presence in all Haflinger breeding countries . The line is most prolific in Austria and Italy . 
 S @-@ line . Founded by Stelvio , born 1923 . Stelvio is the least numerous of the lines , threatened with extinction after non @-@ Haflinger blood was introduced in Germany . Currently most populous in Italy , Austrian authorities are working to re @-@ establish it . 
 ST @-@ line . Founded by Student , born 1927 . Although the ST @-@ line has a large number of stallions , its geographic spread is limited because of unselective breeding in some countries . Germany and the U.S. hold the most horses of this line outside Austria . 
 W @-@ line . Founded by Willi , born 1921 . The W @-@ line , threatened by crossbreeding early in its history , maintains a strong presence in the Netherlands , Canada and the U.S. , with a smaller population in Austria . 
 Bolzano and Willi were great @-@ great grandsons of Folie , while the rest were great @-@ great @-@ great grandsons . Especially in the early years of the breed 's history , some inbreeding occurred , both by accident and design , which served to reinforce the breed 's dominant characteristics . During the 1980s and 1990s , several studies were conducted to examine morphological differences among the breed lines . Significant differences were found in some characteristics , including height and proportions ; these have been used to help achieve breeding objectives , especially in Italy during the 1990s . 
 = = History = = 
 The history of the Haflinger horse traces to the Middle Ages . Origins of the breed are uncertain , but there are two main theories . The first is that Haflingers descend from horses abandoned in the Tyrolean valleys in central Europe by East Goths fleeing from Byzantine troops after the fall of <unk> in 555 AD . These abandoned horses are believed to have been influenced by Oriental bloodlines and may help explain the Arabian physical characteristics seen in the Haflinger . A type of light mountain pony was first recorded in the <unk> Valley in 1282 , and was probably the ancestor of the modern Haflinger . The second theory is that they descended from a stallion from the Kingdom of Burgundy sent to Margrave Louis of Brandenburg by his father , Louis IV , Holy Roman Emperor , when the Margrave married Princess Margarete <unk> of the Tyrol in 1342 . It has also been suggested that they descend from the prehistoric Forest horse . Haflingers have close connections to the Noriker , a result of the overlapping geographic areas where the two breeds were developed . Whatever its origins , the breed developed in a mountainous climate and was well able to thrive in harsh conditions with minimal maintenance . 
 The breed as it is known today was officially established in the village of Hafling in the <unk> Mountains , then located in Austria @-@ Hungary . The Arabian influence was strongly reinforced in the modern Haflinger by the introduction of the stallion El Bedavi , imported to Austria in the 19th century . El @-@ Bedavi 's half @-@ Arabian great @-@ grandson , El @-@ Bedavi XXII , was bred at the Austro @-@ Hungarian stud at <unk> and was sire of the breed 's foundation stallion , 249 Folie , born in 1874 in the Vinschgau . Folie 's dam was a native Tyrolean mare of refined type . All Haflingers today must trace their ancestry to Folie through one of seven stallion lines ( A , B , M , N , S , ST , and W ) to be considered purebred . The small original gene pool , and the mountain environment in which most original members of the breed were raised , has resulted in a very fixed physical type and appearance . In the early years of the breed 's development Oriental stallions such as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> were also used as studs , but foals of these stallions lacked many key Haflinger traits and breeding to these sires was discontinued . After the birth of Folie in 1874 , several Austrian noblemen became interested in the breed and petitioned the government for support and direction of organized breeding procedures . It was 1899 before the Austrian government responded , deciding to support breeding programs through establishment of subsidies ; high @-@ quality Haflinger fillies were among those chosen for the government @-@ subsidized breeding program . Since then the best Haflinger fillies and colts have been chosen and selectively bred to maintain the breed 's quality . Horses not considered to meet quality standards were used by the army as pack animals . By the end of the 19th century Haflingers were common in both South and North Tyrol , and stud farms had been established in Styria , Salzburg and Lower Austria . In 1904 , the Haflinger Breeders ' Cooperative was founded in <unk> , in South Tyrol , with the aim of improving breeding procedures , encouraging pure @-@ breeding and establishing a studbook and stallion registry . 
 = = = World Wars = = = 
 World War I resulted in many Haflingers being taken into military service and the interruption of breeding programs . After the war , under the terms of the Treaty of Saint Germain , South Tyrol ( including Hafling ) was ceded to Italy , while North Tyrol remained in Austria . This split was extremely detrimental to the Haflinger breed , as most of the brood mares were in South Tyrol in what was now Italy , while the high @-@ quality breeding stallions had been kept at studs in North Tyrol and so were still in Austria . Little effort at cooperation was made between breeders in North and South Tyrol , and in the 1920s a new Horse Breeders ' Commission was established in Bolzano in Italy , which was given governmental authority to inspect state @-@ owned breeding stallions , register privately owned stallions belonging to Commission members , and give prize money for horse show competition . The Commission governed the breeding of the Italian population of both the Haflinger and the Noriker horse . In 1921 , because of the lack of breeding stallions in Italy , a crossbred Sardinian @-@ Arabian stallion was used for the Haflinger breeding program , as well as many lower @-@ quality purebred Haflingers . 
 If not for the presence of Haflinger stallions at a stud farm in <unk> @-@ <unk> in Upper Austria after World War I , the Haflinger might well not exist in Austria today . Despite these stallions , the Haflinger breeding programs were not on solid footing in Austria , with governmental focus on other Austrian breeds and private breeding programs not large enough to influence national breeding practices . During this time , the breed was kept alive through crosses to the <unk> , Bosnian , Konik and Noriker breeds . In 1919 and 1920 , the remaining stallions were assigned throughout Austria , many to areas that had hosted private breeding farms before the war . In 1921 , the North Tyrolean Horse Breeders ' Cooperative was formed in <unk> , and in 1922 , the first Haflinger Breeders ' Show was held in the same location . Many extant Austrian Haflinger mares were considered to be of too low quality to be used as brood mares , and every effort was made to import higher @-@ quality brood mares from the South Tyrol herds now in Italy . In 1926 , the first studbook was established in North Tyrol . In the late 1920s , other cooperatives were established for Haflinger breeders in <unk> and <unk> , and were able to gain government permission to purchase 100 Haflinger mares from South Tyrol and split them between North Tyrol , Upper Austria and Styria . This single transaction represented one third of all registered mares in South Tyrol , and many others were sold through private treaty , leaving the two regions comparable in terms of breeding @-@ stock populations . In 1931 , another breeders ' cooperative was established in East Tyrol in Austria , and Haflinger breeding spread throughout the entire Tyrolean province . 
 The Great Depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s dampened horse prices and had an unfavorable effect on Haflinger breeding , but from 1938 onwards markets improved as a result of the buildup for World War II . All crossbred horses and colts not of breeding quality could be sold to the army , and higher subsidies were given by the government to Haflinger breeders . However , the demands of the war also meant that many unregistered mares of Haflinger type were covered by registered stallions , and the resulting progeny were registered , resulting in a degradation of breeding stock . In 1935 and 1936 , a breeding program was begun in Bavaria through the cooperation of the German agricultural authorities , military authorities and existing stud farms . The first government @-@ run German Haflinger stud farm was established in <unk> with brood mares from North and South Tyrol , and several private stud farms were established elsewhere in the country . The combination of a high demand for pack horses and variable amounts of breed knowledge of the purchasers led to the purchase of both high- and low @-@ quality horses , which had mixed results on breed quality . Purchases by Bavarians also resulted in a further depletion of Austrian and Italian stock , already low from the population <unk> of both world wars . However , the German Armed Forces were ready purchasers , and the purchasing and breeding continued . Despite some claims that only purebred horses were registered , many well @-@ known Bavarian studs had crossbred maternal lines . During World War II , Haflingers were bred to produce horses that were shorter and more draft @-@ like for use as packhorses by the military . After the war , breeding emphasis changed to promote refinement and height . 
 = = = Postwar period = = = 
 After World War II , Haflinger breeding programs almost collapsed as the military stopped buying horses and government @-@ run breeding centers were closed . Breeders continued to emphasize those features necessary for pack horses ( the largest use by the military ) , but neglected other key Haflinger characteristics . Haflinger breeding had to change to create a horse that better fit modern trends toward recreational use . Around this time , all small breed cooperatives were combined into the Haflinger Breeders ' Association of Tyrol . Post @-@ World War II Tyrol , including the breeding center at <unk> , was under the control of American forces , who slaughtered many horses to provide meat for hospitals . However , the troops did allow the breeding director to choose 30 stallions to be kept for breeding purposes . Those horses were relocated to the French @-@ occupied Kops <unk> high pasture in Vorarlberg , but they were subsequently stolen and never seen again . In other areas of Tyrol , all one- to three @-@ year @-@ old colts had been requisitioned by military breeding centers , and therefore it was necessary to treat colts not even a year old as potential breeding stallions . In the years after World War II , some observers feared that the breed was dying out because of indiscriminate crossing with other breeds . 
 At conferences in 1946 and 1947 , the decision was made to breed Haflinger horses from pure bloodlines , creating a closed stud book with no new blood being introduced . The Tyrolean Haflinger Breeders ' Association established its own stallion center and prohibited private breeders from keeping stallions , thus ensuring that the association maintained 100 percent control of breeding stallions . In Bavaria , several young stallions had been saved and breeders could privately own stallions . Bavarian and Tyrolean breeders maintained close ties and cooperated extensively . North Tyrolean breeders were also able to acquire several high @-@ quality older stallions and lower @-@ quality young stallions from South Tyrol . In 1947 , the Federation of Austrian Haflinger Breeders was established as a governing organization for the provincial associations . At this time a large @-@ scale breed show was held , attended by visitors from Switzerland , who soon after their return home sent a purchasing commission to Austria and were instrumental in founding the Haflinger population in Switzerland . Southern Tyrol had no difficulty in selling its horses , as all of Italy was in the market to purchase horses , and breeding populations spread as far south as Sicily . 
 Between 1950 and 1974 , even as the overall European equine population was dropping due to increased mechanization , the Haflinger population was increasing . In that time period , the population of registered Haflinger brood mares rose from 1 @,@ 562 to 2 @,@ 043 . This was mainly a result of the increased marketing of the breed , and happened even as Norwegian Fjord horses were exported to Germany , reducing the resources available for Haflinger breeding programs . Through well @-@ planned marketing campaigns , the Haflinger became the dominant small @-@ horse breed in the region . In 1954 , Yugoslavia and Italy purchased breeding stock from North Tyrol to establish their own Haflinger programs and in 1956 the German Democratic Republic followed suit . The first Haflingers were exported to the United States from Austria in 1958 by Tempel Smith of Tempel Farms in Illinois and into Czechoslovakia in 1959 . Tyrolean Haflingers were purchased by the Netherlands and Turkey in 1961 . In Turkey they were both bred pure and crossed with the <unk> breed . In 1963 , the first Haflinger was exported to Great Britain , in 1969 two Haflinger mares were presented to Queen Elizabeth II upon her official visit to Austria , and in 1970 , the Haflinger Society of Great Britain was established . The first Haflinger was exported to France in 1964 , and they continued to be transferred to that country until 1975 , when the breeding population became stable . Between 1980 and 2000 , the population of Haflingers in France tripled . In 1965 , the first international Haflinger show was held at Innsbruck , with horses from East and West Germany , the Netherlands , Italy , Switzerland and Austria participating . Haflingers were first exported to Belgium in 1966 , to Bhutan in 1968 , and to Poland , Hungary and Albania in subsequent years . The importations to Bhutan encouraged interest in the breed in other parts of Asia . In 1974 , the first Haflinger was imported to Australia . The first Canadian Haflinger was registered with the United States breed association in 1977 , and a Canadian registry was formed in 1980 . Between 1970 and 1975 , Haflingers were also imported into Luxemburg , Denmark , Thailand , Columbia , Brazil , southwest Africa , Sweden and Ireland . They have also been imported into Japan . Haflingers maintained a population on every populated continent by the end of the 1970s . Worldwide breeding continued through the 1980s and 1990s , and population numbers increased steadily . 
 = = = 21st century = = = 
 Although the Haflinger is now found all over the world , the majority of breeding stock still comes from Austria , where state studs own the stallions and carefully maintain the quality of the breed . However , there are breeding farms located in the United States , Canada , Germany , the Netherlands , and England . As of 2007 , Italian Haflingers had the largest population of any breed in that country . Due to selective breeding during the 1990s aiming to increase height , some breed lines became favored over others in Italy . A 2007 study found little inbreeding within the Italian Haflinger population as a whole , although certain less popular lines had a higher incidence due to the existence of fewer breeding stallions . Haflingers are bred throughout France , especially in the provinces of Brittany , Burgundy and Picardy , with between 350 and 400 foals born each year . Slovenia also has a small Haflinger population , with around 307 breeding mares and 30 breeding stallions as of 2008 . A 2009 study found that although there was a very small amount of inbreeding in the population , it was increasing slightly over the years . As of 2005 there were almost 250 @,@ 000 Haflingers in the world . 
 On May 28 , 2003 , a Haflinger filly named Prometea became the first horse clone born . Bred by Italian scientists , she was cloned from a mare skin cell , and was a healthy foal . In 2008 , Prometea herself gave birth to the first offspring of an equine clone , a colt named Pegaso sired by a Haflinger stallion through artificial insemination . The American Haflinger Registry does not allow horses born as a result of cloning to be registered , although as of 2010 other nations ' registries have not yet entered a decision on the topic . In January 2012 , Breyer Horses created a model horse of the Haflinger . 
 = = Uses = = 
 Haflingers were bred to be versatile enough for many under @-@ saddle disciplines , but still solid enough for draft and driving work . The Haflinger was originally developed to work in the mountainous regions of its native land , where it was used as a packhorse and for forestry and agricultural work . In the late 20th century Haflingers were used by the Indian Army in an attempt to breed pack animals for mountainous terrain , but the program was unsuccessful because of the Haflinger 's inability to withstand the desert heat . The Austrian Army still uses Haflingers as packhorses in rough terrain . They are used most often in high Alpine terrain , with slopes up to 40 percent and steps of up to 40 centimetres ( 16 in ) . There are around 70 horses in use , held by the 6th Infantry Brigade and based in Hochfilzen . The Haflinger is also used by the German army for rough terrain work and demonstration purposes . 
 Today the breed is used in many activities that include draft and pack work , light harness and combined driving , and many under @-@ saddle events , including western @-@ style horse @-@ show classes , trail and endurance riding , dressage , show jumping , vaulting , and therapeutic riding programs . They are used extensively as dressage horses for children , but are tall and sturdy enough to be suitable riding horses for adults . In the 1970s , British Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh competed with a driving team of four Haflingers . There are several national shows for Haflingers worldwide , including those in Germany , Great Britain and the United States . Despite the Austrian prohibitions against crossbreeding , other countries have practiced this to some extent . Good quality animals have been produced out of crosses between Haflingers and both Arabians and Andalusians . British enthusiasts maintain a partbred registry for Haflinger crosses . In Germany , horses that are 75 percent Haflinger and 25 percent Arabian are popular and are called Arabo @-@ Haflingers . In Italy , where horse meat consumption is at the highest among all European Community members , Haflingers provide a large percentage of national production . Most are either bred specifically for meat production and slaughtered between the ages of 10 and 18 months , or as a result of health problems , or age . The Haflinger also produces the majority of the horse milk consumed in Germany . 
 = = Registration = = 
 Breed organizations exist in many countries to provide accurate documentation of Haflinger pedigrees and ownership , and to promote the Haflinger breed . Most are linked to each other through membership in the World Haflinger Federation ( WHF ) , established in 1976 . The WHF establishes international breeding guidelines , objectives and rules for studbook selection and performance tests . They also authorize European and World Shows and compile an annual list of Haflinger experts , or adjudicators . The WHF is the international umbrella organization , with 21 member organizations in 22 countries . Membership organizations include the Haflinger Horse Society of Australia , the Australian Haflinger Horse Breeders Association , the Canadian Haflinger Association , the Haflinger <unk> Tirol ( Tyrolean Haflinger Breeding Association ) , the Italian Associazione Nazionale <unk> Cavalli di <unk> Haflinger Italia and the American Haflinger Registry , as well as a division for breeders in countries that are not already members . National organizations are allowed to become members of the WHF through agreeing to promote pure breeding and maintain the hereditary characteristics of the Haflinger breed . Member organizations must maintain both a purebred studbook and a separate part @-@ bred studbook for animals with Arabian or other bloodlines . 
 A strict system of inspection , started in Austria , has evolved to ensure that only good quality stock meeting high standards is used for breeding . This is coupled with close maintenance of the studbook to maintain inspection validity . Mares must be inspected and registered with the stud book before they can be covered , and multiple forms are needed to prove covering and birth of a purebred Haflinger foal . Within six months of birth , foals are inspected , and those considered to have potential as breeding stock are given certificates of pedigree and branded . Horses are <unk> at three years old , checked against written association standards , and if they pass , are then entered into the studbook . After their final inspection Haflingers from Austria and Italy are branded with a firebrand in the shape of an <unk> . Horses from Austria and from South Tyrol have the letter " H " in the center of the brand , while horses from all other parts of Italy have the letters " HI " . Horses are graded based on conformation , action , bone , height , temperament and color . Mares must have a fully registered purebred pedigree extending six generations back to be considered for stud book acceptance . Stallions are registered separately . Colts must have a dam with a fully purebred pedigree , and are inspected based on hereditary reliability and likely breeding strength as well as the other qualifications . Each stallion 's registration certification must show a fully purebred pedigree extending back four generations , as well as records of mares covered , percentages of pregnancies aborted , still @-@ born and live @-@ born , and numbers and genders of foals born . This information is used to match stallions and mares for breeding . Tyrolean colts undergo an initial assessment , and those not chosen must be either gelded or sold out of the Tyrolean breeding area . The chosen colts are reassessed every six months until a final inspection at the age of three , when the best stallions are chosen for Tyrolean breeding , after which they are purchased by the Austrian Ministry of Agriculture and made available for breeding throughout the region . The others are either gelded or sold out of the region . Other countries base their registration and selection practices on Tyrolean ones , as is required by the WHF .

 Lawrence Sullivan " Sul " Ross ( September 27 , 1838 – January 3 , 1898 ) was the 19th Governor of Texas ( USA ) , a Confederate States Army general during the American Civil War , and a president of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas , now called Texas A & M University . 
 Ross was raised in the Republic of Texas , which was later annexed to the United States . Much of his childhood was spent on the frontier , where his family founded the town of Waco . As a teenager , Ross attended Baylor University . On one of his summer breaks , he suffered severe injuries while fighting Comanches . After graduation , Ross joined the Texas Rangers , and in 1860 , led troops in the Battle of Pease River , where he rescued Cynthia Ann Parker , who had been captured by the Comanches as a child . 
 When Texas seceded from the United States and joined the Confederacy , Ross joined the Confederate States Army . He participated in 135 battles and skirmishes and became one of the youngest Confederate generals . Following the Civil War , Ross briefly served as sheriff of McLennan County before resigning to participate in the 1875 Texas Constitutional Convention . With the exception of a two @-@ year term as a state senator , Ross spent the next decade focused on his farm and ranch concerns . In 1887 , he became the 19th governor of Texas . During his two terms , he oversaw the dedication of the new Texas State Capitol , resolved the Jaybird @-@ Woodpecker War , and became the only Texas governor to call a special session to deal with a treasury surplus . 
 Despite his popularity , Ross refused to run for a third term as governor . Days after leaving office , he became president of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas ( now Texas A & M University ) . He is credited with saving the school from closure , and his tenure saw a large expansion in college facilities and the birth of many school traditions . After his death , the Texas legislature created Sul Ross State University in his honor . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Lawrence Sullivan Ross was born on September 27 , 1838 in <unk> , Iowa Territory . He was the fourth child and second son of Shapley Prince Ross and Catherine Fulkerson , the daughter of Missouri legislator Isaac Fulkerson . Ross was jointly named for his paternal uncle , Giles O. Sullivan , and his father 's grandfather and brother , both named Lawrence Ross . The senior Lawrence Ross had been captured by Native Americans as a child , and lived with them from the time he was six years old until he was rescued at 23 . To differentiate Ross from his uncle and great @-@ grandfather , he was called " Little Sul " when he was a child , and later " Sul " . 
 Shortly after Ross 's birth , his parents sold their Iowa property and returned to Missouri to escape Iowa 's cold weather . In 1839 , the family moved to the Republic of Texas , where they settled in the Robertson Colony on the lower Brazos River . Two years later , they joined seven other families under Captain Daniel Monroe and settled near present @-@ day Cameron , where they received 640 acres ( 260 ha ) of land along the Little River . Their land adjoined Comanche territory and was raided several times . 
 In 1845 , the family moved to Austin so Ross and his older siblings could attend school . Four years later , they relocated again . By this time , Shapley Ross was well known as a frontiersman , and to coax him to settle in the newly formed community of Waco , the family was given four city lots , exclusive rights to operate a ferry across the Brazos River , and the right to buy 80 acres ( 32 ha ) of farmland at US $ 1 per acre . In March 1849 , the Ross family built the first house in Waco , a double @-@ log cabin on a bluff overlooking the springs . Ross 's sister Kate soon became the first Caucasian child born in Waco . 
 Eager to further his education , Ross entered the Preparatory Department at Baylor University ( then in Independence , Texas ) in 1856 , despite the fact that he was several years older than most of the other students . He completed the two @-@ year study course in one year . Following his graduation , he enrolled at Wesleyan University in Florence , Alabama . The Wesleyan faculty originally deemed his mathematics knowledge so lacking , they refused his admittance ; the decision was rescinded after a professor agreed to tutor Ross privately in the subject . At Wesleyan , students lived with prominent families instead of congregating in dormitories , thus giving them " daily exposure to good manners and refinement " . Ross lived with the family of his tutor . 
 = = Wichita Village fight = = 
 During the summer of 1858 , Ross returned to Texas and journeyed to the Brazos Indian Reserve , where his father served as Indian Agent . The United States Army had conscripted Indians from the reserve to help the " Wichita Expedition " of 2nd Cavalry in a search for Buffalo Hump , a <unk> Comanche chief who had led several deadly raids on Texas settlements . Fearing that Shapley Ross was too ill to command them on the expedition , the Indians named Sul Ross their new war chief . With his father 's approval , the younger Ross led the 135 warriors to accompany 225 troops led by brevet Major Earl Van Dorn . Ross was given the courtesy title of " Captain " during his command . 
 Native scouts found about 500 Comanches , including Buffalo Hump , camped outside a Wichita village in Indian Territory . Early in the battle , Ross and his men successfully stampeded the Comanche horses , leaving the Comanche warriors at a disadvantage when facing the mounted troops . When many Comanche tried to flee the area , Ross , one of his scouts , Lieutenant Cornelius Van Camp of the 2nd Cavalry and one of his troopers chased a party of noncombatants that appeared to contain a white child . On Ross 's orders , his man grabbed the child ; as the four turned to rejoin the battle , they were confronted by 25 Comanche warriors . Van Camp and the private were killed with arrows , and Ross received an arrow through his shoulder . A Comanche picked up the trooper 's carbine and fired a 0 @.@ 58 @-@ caliber bullet through Ross 's chest . His attacker , Mohee , was a Comanche brave Ross had known since childhood . Mohee was killed by buckshot fired by Lieutenant James Majors of the 2nd Cavalry as the warrior approached the temporarily paralyzed Ross with a scalping knife . 
 After five hours of fighting , the troops subdued the Comanche resistance . Buffalo Hump escaped , but 70 Comanches were killed or mortally wounded , only two of them noncombatants . Ross 's injuries were severe , and for five days he lay under a tree on the battlefield , unable to be moved . His wounds became infected , and Ross begged the others to kill him to end his pain . When he was able to travel , he was first carried on a litter suspended between two mules , and then on the shoulders of his men . He recovered fully , but experienced some pain for much of the rest of the year . 
 In his written report , Van Dorn praised Ross highly . The Dallas Herald printed the report on October 10 , and other state newspapers also praised Ross 's bravery . General Winfield Scott learned of Ross 's role and offered him a direct commission in the Army . Eager to finish his education , Ross declined Scott 's offer and returned to school in Alabama . 
 The following year , Ross graduated from Wesleyan with a Bachelor of Arts and returned to Texas . Once there , he discovered no one had been able to trace the family of the young Caucasian girl rescued during the Wichita Village fight . He adopted the child and named her Lizzie Ross , in honor of his new fiancée , Lizzie Tinsley .

 In early 1860 , Ross enlisted in Captain J. M. Smith 's Waco company of Texas Rangers , which formed to fight the renegade Native Americans . Smith appointed Ross his second lieutenant . When Smith was promoted , the other men in the company unanimously voted to make Ross the new captain . In conjunction with several other Ranger companies , Ross led his men to retaliate against a Kickapoo tribe which had murdered two white families . The tribe had been warned of the Rangers ' approach and set the prairie ablaze . The Rangers were forced to abandon their mission when confronted with the massive wildfire . 
 Smith disbanded Ross 's company in early September 1860 . Within a week , Governor Sam Houston authorized Ross to raise his own company of 60 mounted volunteers to protect the settlements near Belknap from Native American attacks . Ross and his men arrived at Fort Belknap on October 17 , 1860 to find the local citizens they were sworn to protect had passed a resolution asking Ross to resign his commission and leave the frontier . The citizens erroneously believed the raiding was committed by Native Americans from the reservations , and they feared Ross 's friendship with those on the reservations would make him ineffective . 
 = = = Battle of Pease River = = = 
 In late October and November 1860 , Comanches led by Peta Nocona conducted numerous raids on various settlements , culminating in the brutal killing of a pregnant woman . On hearing of these incidents , Houston sent several 25 @-@ man companies to assist Ross . A citizen 's posse had tracked the raiders to their winter village along the Pease River . As the village contained at least 500 warriors and many women and children , the posse returned to the settlements to recruit additional fighters . Ross requested help from the U.S. Army at Camp Cooper , which sent 21 troops . 
 Immediately after the soldiers arrived on December 11 , Ross and 39 Rangers departed for the Comanche village . On December 13 , they met the civilian posse , which had grown to 69 members . After several days of travel , the fast pace and poor foraging forced the civilians to stop and rest their horses . The Rangers and soldiers continued on . When they neared the village , Ross personally scouted ahead . Hidden from view by a dust storm , he was able to get within 200 yd ( 180 m ) of the village and saw signs that the tribe was preparing to move on . Realizing his own horses were too tired for a long pursuit , Ross resolved to attack immediately , before the civilians were able to rejoin the group . Ross lead the Rangers down the ridge , while the soldiers circled around to cut off the Comanche retreat . 
 After fierce fighting , the Comanches fled . Ross and several of his men pursued the chief and a second , unknown , rider . As the Rangers neared , the second rider slowed and held a child over her head ; the men did not shoot , but instead surrounded and stopped her . Ross continued to follow the chief , eventually shooting him three times . The chief refused to surrender , even after falling from his horse . Ross 's cook , Anton Martinez , who had been a captive in Nocona 's band , identified the fallen chief as Nocona . With Ross 's permission , Martinez fired the shot that took Nocona 's life . Nocona was the only Comanche male to die in the fighting ; 13 Comanche women were also killed . Ross 's men suffered no casualties . 
 The civilian posse arrived at the battleground as the fighting finished . Although they initially congratulated Ross for winning the battle , some of them later complained that Ross had pushed ahead without them so he would not have to share the glory or the spoils of war . 
 When Ross arrived back at the campground , he realized the captured woman had blue eyes . The woman could not speak English and did not remember her birth name or details of her life prior to joining the Comanche . After much questioning , she was able to provide a few details of her capture as a child . The details matched what Ross knew of the 1836 Fort Parker Massacre , so he summoned Colonel Isaac Parker to identify her . When Parker mentioned his kidnapped niece had been named Cynthia Ann Parker , the woman slapped her chest and said " Me <unk> Ann . " Parker never returned to the Comanche people , but was not happy to have been rescued by Ross . 
 In contrast , Ross 's intervention was welcomed by a nine @-@ year @-@ old Indian boy found hiding alone in the tall grass . Ross took the child with him , naming him Pease . Though Pease was later given the choice to return to his people , he refused and was raised by Ross . 
 The Battle of Pease River cemented Ross 's fame . His " aggressive tactics of carrying the war to the Comanche fireside , ( as it had long been carried to that of the white ) ended charges of softness in dealing with the Indians . " After Ross 's death , however , Nocona 's son Quanah Parker maintained his father was not present at the battle , and instead died three or four years later . Quanah Parker identified the man Martinez shot as a Mexican captive who was the personal servant of Nocona 's wife , Cynthia Ann Parker . 
 = = = Resignation = = = 
 When Ross returned home , Houston asked him to disband the company and form a new company of 83 men , promising to send written directives soon . While Ross was in the process of supervising this reorganization , Houston appointed Captain William C. Dalrymple as his new aide @-@ de @-@ camp with overall command of the Texas Rangers . Dalrymple , unaware of Houston 's verbal orders , castigated Ross for disbanding his company . Ross completed the reorganization of the company , then returned to Waco and resigned his commission . In his letter of resignation , effective February 1861 , Ross informed Houston of his encounter with Dalrymple , and noted he did not believe a Ranger company could be effective if the captain did not report solely to the Governor . Houston offered to appoint Ross as an aide @-@ de @-@ camp with the rank of colonel , but Ross refused .

Shortly after Ross enlisted in his brother 's company as a private , Governor Edward Clark requested he instead proceed immediately to the Indian Territory to negotiate treaties with the Five Civilized Tribes so they would not help the Union Army . One week after his May 28 wedding to Lizzie Tinsley , Ross set out for the Indian Territory . Upon reaching the Washita Agency , he discovered the Confederate commissioners had already signed a preliminary treaty with the tribes . 
 Ross returned home for several months . In the middle of August , he departed , with his company , for Missouri , leaving his wife with her parents . On September 7 , his group became Company G of Stone 's Regiment , later known as the Sixth Texas Cavalry . The other men elected Ross as the major for the regiment . Twice in November 1861 , Ross was chosen by General McCulloch , with whom he had served in the Texas Rangers , to lead a scouting force near Springfield , Missouri . Both times , Ross successfully slipped behind the Union Army lines , gathered information , and retreated before being caught . After completing the missions , he was granted a 60 @-@ day leave and returned home to visit his wife .

 In early 1862 , Ross returned to duty . By late February , he and 500 troops were assigned to raid the Union Army . He led the group 70 mi ( 110 km ) behind the enemy lines , where they gathered intelligence , destroyed several wagonloads of commissary supplies , captured 60 horses and mules , and took 11 prisoners . The following month , the regiment was assigned to Earl Van Dorn , now a Major General , with whom Ross had served during the battle at the Wichita Village . Under Van Dorn , the group suffered a defeat at the Battle of Pea Ridge ; Ross attributed their loss solely to Van Dorn , and blamed him for <unk> and <unk> his troops , and for failing to properly coordinate the plan of attack . In April , the group was sent to Des Arc , Arkansas . Because of the scarcity of forage , Ross 's cavalry troop was ordered to dismount and send their horses back to Texas . The unit , now on foot , traveled to Memphis , Tennessee , arriving two weeks after the Battle of Shiloh . Ross soon caught a bad cold accompanied by a lingering fever , and was extremely ill for eight weeks . By the time he considered himself cured , his weight had dwindled to only 125 lb ( 57 kg ) . 
 Over Ross 's protests , the men of the Sixth Regiment elected him colonel in 1862 . He did not want the responsibility of the position and had not wanted to embarrass a friend who wanted the job . Their brigade commander , General Charles W. Phifer , was often absent , leaving Ross in charge . Ross 's actions impressed other officers , and several times during the summer of 1862 , he was nominated for promotion to brigadier general . Although he was not promoted at that time , his unit was the only one of the 8 – 10 dismounted cavalry units in the area to be promised the return of their horses . 
 While still afoot , Ross and his men participated in the Battle of Corinth . Under Ross 's command , his Texans twice captured Union guns at Battery Robinett . They were forced to retreat from their position each time as reinforcements failed to arrive . During the battle , Ross , who had acquired a horse , was bucked off , leading his men to believe he had been killed . He was actually unharmed . The Confederate Army retreated from the battle and found themselves facing more Union troops at Hatchie 's Bridge . Ross led 700 riflemen to engage the Union troops . For three hours , his men held off 7 @,@ 000 Union troops , repulsing three major enemy assaults . 
 The Sixth Cavalry 's horses arrived soon after the battle , and the regiment was transferred to the cavalry brigade of Colonel William H. " Red " Jackson . Ross was permitted to take a few weeks leave in November 1862 to visit his wife , and returned to his regiment in mid @-@ January 1863 . Several months later , his unit participated in the Battle of Thompson 's Station . In July , Major General Stephen D. Lee joined the Sixth Texas Cavalry with Colonel R.A. Pinson 's First Mississippi Cavalry , creating a new brigade with Ross at the helm . Near the same time , Ross received word that his first child had died , possibly stillborn . 
 Ross fell ill again in September 1863 . From September 27 through March 1864 , he suffered recurring attacks of fever and chills every three days , symptomatic of tertian malaria . Despite his illness , Ross never missed a day of duty , and in early 1864 he was promoted to brigadier general , becoming the ninth @-@ youngest general officer of the Confederate Army . Following his promotion , unit morale improved , and every one of his men re @-@ enlisted . 
 In March 1864 , Ross 's brigade fought against African American soldiers for the first time at Yazoo City , Mississippi . After bitter fighting , the Confederates were victorious . During the surrender negotiations , the Union officer accused the Texans of murdering several captured African American soldiers . Ross claimed two of his men had likewise been killed after surrendering to Union troops . 
 Beginning in May , the brigade endured 112 consecutive days of skirmishes , comprising 86 separate clashes with the enemy . Though most of the skirmishes were small , by the end of the period , injuries and desertion had cut the regiment 's strength by 25 % . Ross was captured in late July at the Battle of Brown 's Mill , but was quickly rescued by a successful Confederate cavalry counterattack . 
 Their last major military campaign was the Franklin @-@ Nashville Campaign of November and December 1864 . Ross and his men led the Confederate advance into Tennessee . Between the beginning of November and December 27 , his men captured 550 prisoners , several hundred horses , and enough overcoats and blankets to survive the winter chill . Only 12 of Ross 's men were killed , with 70 wounded and five captured . 
 = = = Surrender = = = 
 By the time Ross began a 90 @-@ day furlough on March 13 , 1865 , he had participated in 135 engagements with the enemy and his horse had been shot out from under him five times , yet he had escaped serious injury . With his leave approved , Ross hurried home to Texas to visit the wife he had not seen in two years . While at home , the Confederate Army began its surrender . He had not rejoined his regiment when it surrendered in Jackson , Mississippi , on May 14 , 1865 . Because he was not present at the surrender , Ross did not receive a parole protecting him from arrest . As a Confederate Army officer over the rank of colonel , Ross was also exempted from President Andrew Johnson 's amnesty proclamation of May 29 , 1865 . To prevent his arrest and the confiscation of his property , on August 4 , 1865 , Ross applied for a special pardon for his treason against the United States . Johnson personally approved Ross 's application on October 22 , 1866 , but Ross did not receive and formally accept the pardon until July 1867 . 
 = = Farming and early public service = = 
 When the Civil War ended , Ross was just 26 years old . He owned 160 acres ( 65 ha ) of farmland along the South Bosque River west of Waco , and 5 @.@ 41 acres ( 2 @.@ 19 ha ) in town . For the first time , he and his wife were able to establish their own home . They expanded their family , having eight children over the next 17 years . 
 Despite his federal pardon for being a Confederate general , Ross was disqualified from voting and serving as a juror by the first Reconstruction Act of March 2 , 1867 . This act , and the Supplementary Reconstruction Act passed three weeks later , disenfranchised anyone who had held a federal or state office before supporting the Confederacy . 
 Reconstruction did not harm Ross 's fortune , and with hard work , he soon prospered . Shortly after the war ended , he bought 20 acres ( 8 @.@ 1 ha ) of land in town from his parents for $ 1 @,@ 500 . By May 1869 , he had purchased an additional 40 acres ( 16 ha ) of farmland for $ 400 , and the following year his wife inherited 186 acres ( 75 ha ) of farmland from the estate of her father . Ross continued to buy land , and by the end of 1875 , he owned over 1 @,@ 000 acres ( 400 ha ) of farmland . Besides farming , Ross and his brother Peter also raised Shorthorn cattle . The two led several trail drives to New Orleans . The combined farming and ranching incomes left Ross wealthy enough to build a house in the Waco city limits and to send his children to private school . 
 By 1873 , Reconstruction in Texas was coming to an end . In December , Ross was elected sheriff of McLennan County , " without campaigning or other solicitation " . Ross promptly named his brother Peter a deputy , and within two years , they had arrested over 700 outlaws . In 1874 , Ross helped establish the Sheriff 's Association of Texas . After various state newspapers publicized the event , sheriffs representing 65 Texas counties met in Corsicana in August 1874 . Ross became one of a committee of three assigned to draft resolutions for the convention . They asked for greater pay for sheriffs in certain circumstances , condemned the spirit of mob law , and proposed that state law be modified so arresting officers could use force if necessary to " compel the criminal to obey the mandates of the law . " 
 Ross resigned as sheriff in 1875 and was soon elected as a delegate to the 1875 Texas Constitutional Convention . One of three members appointed to wait upon convention president @-@ elect E.B. Pickett , Ross was also named to a committee that would determine what officers and employees were needed by the convention . He sat on many other committees , including Revenue and Taxation , the Select Committee on Frontier Affairs , the Select Committee on Education , and the Standing Committee on the Legislative Department . Of the 68 days of the convention , Ross attended 63 , voted 343 times , and missed or abstained from voting only 66 times . 
 When the convention concluded , Ross returned home and spent the next four years focusing on his farm . In 1880 , he became an accidental candidate for Texas State Senator from the 22nd District . The nominating convention deadlocked between two candidates , with neither receiving a two @-@ thirds majority . As a compromise , one of the delegates suggested the group nominate Ross . Although no one asked Ross whether he wanted to run for office , the delegates elected him as their candidate . He agreed to the nomination to spare the trouble and expense of another convention . 
 Ross won the election with a large majority . Shortly after his arrival in Austin , his youngest son died . Ross returned home for a week to attend the funeral and help care for another son who was seriously ill . On returning to the state capital , he was assigned to the committees for Educational Affairs , Internal Improvements , Finance , <unk> , Military Affairs ( where he served as chairman ) , State Affairs , Contingent Expenses , Stock and Stock Raising , Agricultural Affairs , and Enrolled Bills . Ross introduced a petition on behalf of 500 citizens of McLennan County , requesting a prohibition amendment to be placed on the next statewide ballot ; the legislature did agree to place this on the next ballot . 
 Although the Texas Legislature typically meets once every two years , a fire destroyed the state capitol building in November 1881 , and Ross was called to serve in a special session in April 1882 . The session agreed to build a new capitol building . Near the end of the special session , the Senate passed a reapportionment bill , which reduced Ross 's four @-@ year term to only two years . He declined to run again .

 As early as 1884 , Ross 's friends , including Victor M. Rose , the editor of the newspaper in Victoria , had encouraged Ross to run for governor . He declined and asked his friend George Clark to attend the 1884 state Democratic convention to prevent Ross from being named the gubernatorial candidate . Clark had to produce written authorization from Ross to convince the delegates to nominate someone else . Ross changed his mind in late 1885 , announcing his candidacy for governor on February 25 , 1886 . During the campaign , he was variously accused of pandering to the Greenbackers , the Republicans , and the Knights . Ross spent no money on his campaign other than traveling expenses , but still handily won the Democratic nomination . He won the general election with 228 @,@ 776 votes , compared with 65 @,@ 236 for the Republican candidate and 19 @,@ 186 from the Prohibitionist candidate . Much of his support came from Confederate veterans . 
 Ross became the 19th governor of Texas . His inauguration ball was held at the newly opened <unk> Hotel , a tradition followed by every subsequent Texas governor . Under the 1876 Texas Constitution , which he had helped write , the governor was granted the power to be commander @-@ in @-@ chief , to convene the legislature , to act as executor of the laws , to direct trade with other states , to grant pardons , and to veto bills . His campaign had focused on land use reform , as most of the frontier issues now resulted from disagreements over the use of public land , especially between farmers and ranchers concerned with water rights and grazing issues . At Ross 's urging , the legislature passed laws to restore the power of the Land Office Commissioner , provide punishments for those using state lands illegally , and to catalog existing public lands . 
 = = = Second term = = = 
 In May 1888 , Ross presided over the dedication of the new Texas State Capitol building . Later that year , Ross ran relatively unopposed for a second term . His platform included abolishing the national banking system , regulating monopolies , reducing tariffs , and allowing the railroads to regulate themselves through competition . No other Democrats placed their names in contention at the nominating convention , and the Republicans chose not to select a candidate , as they were happy with Ross 's performance . His sole competition was a Prohibitionist whom Ross defeated by over 151 @,@ 000 votes . In his second inaugural address , Ross , a true Jeffersonian Democrat , maintained , " a plain , simple government , with severe limitations upon delegated powers , honestly and frugally administered , as the noblest and truest outgrowth of the wisdom taught by its founders . " 
 During his second term , Ross was forced to intervene in the Jaybird @-@ Woodpecker War in Fort Bend County . Sheriff Jim Garvey feared there would be armed battles between the white supremacist Democrats ( the <unk> ) and the black men who had retained political power ( who , with their white supporters , were known as Woodpeckers ) . At Garvey 's request , Ross sent two militia companies , which managed to impose a four @-@ month peace . In August 1889 , Ross sent four Texas Rangers , including Sergeant Ira Aten , to quell the unrest . Violence erupted , leaving four people dead and injuring six , including a Ranger . Aten wired Ross for help . The following morning , the Houston Light Guard arrived and instituted martial law ; that evening , Ross arrived with an Assistant Attorney General and another militia company . Ross fired all the local civil officials and called together representatives from both factions . On his suggestion , the two groups agreed to choose a mutually acceptable sheriff to replace Garvey , who had been killed in the firefight . When they could not agree on a candidate , Ross suggested Aten ; both groups finally agreed , thus halting the conflict . 
 In March 1890 , the U.S. Attorney General launched a suit in the Supreme Court against Texas to determine ownership of a disputed 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 6 @,@ 100 km2 ) plot of land in Greer County . Determined to meet personally with the Attorney General , Ross and his wife traveled to Washington , D.C. , where they visited President Benjamin Harrison at the White House . Following that visit , they traveled to New York , where they met with former president Grover Cleveland . While in New York , Ross was extremely popular with journalists . He was interviewed by several large northeastern newspapers , which recounted in detail many of his exploits along the frontier . According to his biographer Judith Brenner , the trip and the resulting exposure for Ross , " excited much interest in Texas among easterners , an interest that would eventually bear fruit in increased investment , tourism , and immigration " . 
 Ross declined to become the first Texas governor to run for a third term , and left office on January 20 , 1891 . During his four years in office , he vetoed only ten bills , and pardoned 861 people . Compared to other Texas governors , these are small numbers ; Governor Miriam A. Ferguson granted 1161 pardons in just two years . 
 = = = Major legislation = = = 
 During his time in office , Ross proposed tax reform laws intended to provide for more equitable assessments of property — at that time , people were allowed to assess their own belongings with little oversight . The legislature passed his recommendations , and approved his plan to exert more control over school funds and to require local taxation to support the public schools . He also encouraged the legislature to enact antitrust laws . These were passed March 30 , 1889 , a full year before the federal government enacted the Sherman Antitrust Act . His reform acts were beneficial for the state , leading Ross to become the only Texas governor to call a special session of the legislature to deal with a treasury surplus . 
 During his term , the legislature agreed to allow the public to vote on a state constitutional amendment for the prohibition of alcohol . Ross vehemently opposed the measure , saying , " No government ever succeeded in changing the moral convictions of its subjects by force . " The amendment was defeated by over 90 @,@ 000 votes . 
 When Ross took the governor 's oath of office , Texas had only four charitable institutions — two insane asylums , an institute for the blind , and an institute for the deaf and dumb . By the time he left office , Ross had supervised the opening of a state orphan 's home , a state institute for deaf , dumb , and blind black children , and a branch asylum for the insane . He also convinced the legislature to set aside 696 acres ( 282 ha ) near Gatesville for a future open farm reformatory for juvenile offenders . 
 Ross was the first governor to set aside a day for civic improvements , declaring the third Friday in January to be Arbor Day , when schoolchildren should endeavor to plant trees . He also supported the legislature 's efforts to purchase the Huddle portrait gallery , a collection of paintings of each governor of Texas . These paintings continue to hang in the rotunda of the Texas State Capitol . 
 Ross felt strongly that the state should adequately care for its veterans . During his first term , the first Confederate home in Texas was dedicated in Austin . Within two years , the facility had run out of room , so Ross served as chairman of a committee to finance a relocation to a larger facility . By August 1890 , the home had collected enough money to move to a larger location . 
 Samuel Willis Tucker Lanham was the last governor of Texas who also served as a Confederate soldier in the Civil War , January 20 , 1903 to January 15 , 1907 .

 By the late 1880s , rumors abounded of " poor management , student discontent , professorial dissatisfaction , faculty factionalism , disciplinary problems , and campus scandals " at the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas ( now Texas A & M University ) . The public was skeptical of the idea of scientific agriculture and the legislature declined to appropriate money for improvements to the campus because it had little confidence in the school 's administrators . The board of directors decided the school , known as Texas AMC , needed to be run by an independent administrative chief rather than the faculty chairman . On July 1 , 1890 , the board unanimously agreed to offer the new job to the sitting governor and asked Ross to resign his office immediately . Ross agreed to consider the offer , as well as several others he had received . An unknown person informed several newspapers that Ross had been asked to become Texas AMC 's president , and each of the newspapers editorialized that Ross would be a perfect fit . The college had been founded to teach military and agricultural knowledge , and Ross had demonstrated excellence in the army and as a farmer . His gubernatorial service had honed his administrative skills , and he had always expressed an interest in education . 
 Though Ross was concerned about the appearance of a conflict of interest , as he had appointed many of the board members who had elected him , he announced he would accept the position . As the news of his acceptance spread throughout the state , prospective students flocked to Texas AMC . Many of the men Ross had supervised during the Civil War wanted their sons to study under their former commander , and 500 students attempted to enroll at the beginning of the 1890 – 1891 school year . Three hundred and sixteen students were admitted , though the facilities were only designed for 250 scholars . When Ross officially took charge of the school on February 2 , the campus had no running water , faced a housing shortage , was taught by disgruntled faculty , and many students were running wild . 
 = = = Improvements = = = 
 The board of directors named Ross the treasurer of the school , and he posted a $ 20 @,@ 000 personal bond " for the faithful performance of his duty " . In the break between school years , Ross instituted a number of changes . When students returned for the 1891 – 1892 school year , they found a new three @-@ story dormitory with 41 rooms ( named Ross Hall ) , the beginning of construction on a new home for the president , and a new building to house the machine and blacksmith shops . The minimum age for enrollment decreased from 16 to 15 , and Ross now personally interviewed all prospective students to determine if they should be admitted . Fees and expenses rose by $ 10 per session , and the number of hours required for graduation increased , including additional hours in English grammar , sciences , mathematics , and history . Additionally , Ross would now appoint the officers for the Corps of Cadets , and the name of the company of best @-@ drilled cadets in the Corps would change to the Ross Volunteers ( from Scott Volunteers ) . Finally , Ross enacted an official prohibition against hazing , vowing to expel any student found guilty of the practice . Although Ross professed to enjoy his new position , he wrote to several people that directing the college " made me turn gray very fast . " 
 Enrollment continued to rise , and by the end of his tenure , Ross requested that parents first communicate with his office before sending their sons to the school . The increase in students necessitated an improvement in facilities , and from late 1891 until September 1898 , the college spent over $ 97 @,@ 000 on improvements and new buildings . This included construction of a mess hall , which could seat 500 diners at once , an infirmary , which included the first indoor toilets on campus , an artesian well , a natatorium , four faculty residences , an electric light plant , an ice works , a laundry , a cold storage room , a slaughterhouse , a gymnasium , a warehouse , and an artillery shed . Despite the expenditures on facilities , the school treasury held a surplus in 1893 and 1894 . The 1894 financial report credited the surplus to Ross 's leadership , and Ross ensured the money was returned to the students in the form of lower fees . 
 = = = Impact on students = = = 
 Ross made himself accessible to students and participated in school activities whenever possible . Those around him found him " slow to condemn but ready to encourage ... [ and they ] could not recall hearing Ross use profanity or seeing him visibly angry . " Every month , he prepared grade sheets for each student and would often call poorly performing students into his office for a discussion of their difficulties . Under his leadership , the military aspect of the college was emphasized . However , he eliminated many practices he considered unnecessary , including marching to and from class , and he reduced the amount of guard time and the number of drills the students were expected to perform . 
 Although enrollment had always been limited to men , Ross favored coeducation , as he thought the male cadets " would be improved by the elevating influence of the good girls " . In 1893 , Ethel Hudson , the daughter of a Texas AMC professor , became the first woman to attend classes at the school and helped edit the annual yearbook . She was made an honorary member of the class of 1895 . Several years later , her twin sisters became honorary members of the class of 1903 , and slowly other daughters of professors were allowed to attend classes . 
 During Ross 's seven @-@ and @-@ one @-@ half year tenure , many enduring Texas A & M traditions formed . These include the first Aggie Ring and the formation of the Aggie Band . Ross 's tenure also saw the school 's first intercollegiate football game , played against the University of Texas . Many student organizations were founded in this time period , including the Fat Man 's Club , the <unk> Men 's Club , the Glee Club ( now known as the Singing Cadets ) , the Bicycle Club , and the College Dramatic Club . In 1893 , students began publishing a monthly newspaper , The Battalion , and two years later , they began publishing an annual yearbook , known as The Olio .

 Ross was an active freemason having become a master mason at the lodge his father helped create in 1851 , Waco Masonic Lodge # 92 , and as a member there , Ross was involved with the development of the new city with the same name . 
 Ross continued to be active in veteran 's organizations , and in 1893 , he became the first commander of the Texas Division of the United Confederate Veterans . He was re @-@ elected president several times and served one term as commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the entire United Confederate Veterans organization . During that time , a Daughters of the Confederacy chapter established in Bryan was named the L.S. Ross Chapter . 
 In 1894 , Ross was appointed to a seat on the Railroad Commission of Texas . While he pondered whether to resign his position and accept the appointment , letters and petitions poured into his office begging him to remain at Texas AMC . He declined the appointment and remained president of the college . 
 Ross had always been an avid hunter , and he embarked on a hunting trip along the Navasota River with his son Neville and several family friends during Christmas vacation in 1897 . While hunting , he suffered acute indigestion and a severe chill and decided to go home early while the others continued their sport . He arrived in College Station on December 30 and consulted a doctor . Ross remained in pain for several days , and in the early evening of January 3 , 1898 , he died , aged 59 years and 3 months . Although no death certificate was filed , " evidence points to a coronary heart attack as the probable cause of death . " The entire Texas AMC student body accompanied Ross 's body back to Waco , where Confederate veterans in gray uniforms formed an honor guard . Several thousand people attended Ross 's burial at Oakwood Cemetery . To further memorialize him , students at Texas AMC held the first Silver Taps ceremony , a tradition still followed when a current student at Texas A & M dies .

 The morning after Ross 's death , the Dallas Morning News published an editorial , quoted in several biographies of Ross : 
 It has been the lot of few men to be of such great service to Texas as Sul Ross . ... Throughout his life he has been closely connected with the public welfare and ... discharged every duty imposed upon him with diligence , ability , honesty and patriotism . ... He was not a brilliant chieftain in the field , nor was he masterful in the art of politics , but , better than either , he was a well @-@ balanced , well @-@ rounded man from whatever standpoint one might estimate him . In his public relations he exhibited sterling common sense , lofty patriotism , inflexible honesty and withal a character so exalted that he commanded at all times not only the confidence but the affection of the people . ... He leaves a name that will be honored as long as chivalry , devotion to duty and spotless integrity are standards of our civilization and an example which ought to be an inspiration to all young men of Texas who aspire to careers of public usefulness and honorable renown . 
 Within weeks of Ross 's death , former cadets at Texas AMC began gathering funds for a monument . In 1917 , the state appropriated $ 10 @,@ 000 for the monument , and two years later , a 10 @-@ ft ( 3 m ) bronze statue of Ross , sculpted by Pompeo Coppini , was unveiled at the center of the Texas AMC campus . In more recent years , students began the tradition of placing pennies at the feet of statue before exams for good luck . School legend states that Ross would often tutor students , and as payment would accept only a penny for their thoughts . At exam time , his statue , located in Academic Plaza , is often covered in pennies . 
 At the same time they appropriated money for the statue , the legislature established the Sul Ross Normal College , now Sul Ross State University in Alpine , Texas . The college opened for classes in June 1920 . 
 In 1998 , a few activists on the Texas A & M campus objected to his statue on the basis that Ross might have been friends with some members of the Ku Klux Klan . As stated above , after an exhaustive search , no documented evidence has ever been found to show that Ross had any association with the Klan . The previously mentioned activists wanted to create a " diversity plaza " , with a statue of African @-@ American politician Matthew Gaines . The project was abandoned in 1999 in the wake of the Aggie Bonfire tragedy .

 1979 Revolution : Black Friday is an adventure interactive drama video game developed and published by <unk> Studios , with assistance from by N @-@ Fusion Interactive . It was released on April 5 , 2016 for Microsoft Windows and OS X , and on June 10 , 2016 for iOS devices . Players control Reza Shirazi , an aspiring photojournalist , who returns to Iran amidst the Iranian Revolution . As he becomes more involved in the events of the Revolution , Reza is forced to make decisions in order to survive . Players make timed responses throughout the game , determining the outcome of the plot . They are tasked with taking in @-@ game photographs of their surroundings , and given historical background of the events . 
 The game was in development for four years , and was created to combine elements from video games and documentaries with an engaging narrative . Game director Navid Khonsari , who was a child in Iran at the time of the Revolution , developed the game with the intention of making players understand the moral ambiguity of the situation . The development team conducted extensive research for the game , interviewing historical scholars and Iranians who lived in Tehran during the Revolution , as well as gathering numerous archival photos and historical speeches . The game 's performances were recorded using motion capture , and each of the characters was developed with ambiguous attitudes and morals . 
 At release , 1979 Revolution was well received by critics , with praise particularly directed at the narrative , characters and performances , and historical representations , though some criticism was directed at the quick @-@ time sequences and visual quality . The game was also criticized by an Iranian journalist who declared it as propaganda . Khonsari felt afraid to reenter Iran as a result , and other members of the development team adopted aliases for protection .

 1979 Revolution : Black Friday is an adventure interactive drama video game . Players control Reza Shirazi — an aspiring photojournalist who returns to Iran amidst the Iranian Revolution . Throughout the game , players are presented with the ability to interact with their surroundings , including crowds of people on strike , and a homeless mother and her infant child . Upon interaction , players are frequently prompted to take photographs of the selected person or event using Reza 's camera . Menus appear on screen , comparing the in @-@ game photograph to real images of the event taken by photographer Michel <unk> . Players also collect tapes throughout the game , featuring the speeches of revolutionary leader Ayatollah Khomeini . 
 Some parts of the game require timed responses from players , often leading to significant decisions that impact the game 's story . Some conversation trees require players to select a response within a limited time , otherwise Reza remains silent . The game also requires action choices , wherein players must decide what to do in specific circumstances ; for example , one sequences tasks players with choosing whether to take aggression during a protest , or to take photographs . Other characters will respond to the decisions accordingly , and a notification feature indicates that a character will remember the selected response . In action @-@ based sequences , players follow on @-@ screen prompts for quick time events in order to stay alive . Should players fail to follow the prompts in the allocated time , the game restarts from prior to the quick time event .

 The game opens in 1980 , as 18 @-@ year @-@ old aspiring photojournalist Reza Shirazi ( Bobby <unk> ) is ambushed at his hideout by police , and taken to <unk> Prison , where he is interrogated by <unk> <unk> ( Navid Negahban ) . Reza , who was part of the Iranian Revolution in an attempt to overthrow the Shah , chooses whether to cooperate to <unk> , who goes by the name of Hajj Agha . The game cuts to September 1978 , as Reza and his friend Babak Azadi ( Omid Abtahi ) watch crowds chanting about the revolution from a rooftop , and Reza takes photographs . The two then walk the streets , and arrive at a protest where revolution leaders are giving speeches . Reza 's cousin Ali Shirazi ( Nicholas <unk> ) arrives and , when the protest is interrupted by soldiers and the crowd begins to disperse , he tries to convince Reza to throw rocks at the soldiers . Babak opposes , and Reza is left to decide whether to act aggressively and throw rocks , or act passively and voice his concerns instead . When the soldiers start threatening the crowds by firing , Reza and Babak flee into an alley , shortly followed by Ali and an injured Abbas ( Ray <unk> ) , one of the revolution leaders who was stabbed in the commotion . After briefly being tended to , Abbas is escorted away by Ali and Bibi <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) . 
 In a flashforward at the prison , Hajj brings out Reza 's brother Hossein Shirazi ( Farshad Farahat ) , and harms him if Reza does not cooperate in providing information about Bibi . The game returns to Reza and Babak , who arrive at the rebellion hideout . Reza meets with Abbas , who is convinced that one of the revolution leaders betrayed and stabbed him , and tasks Reza with discovering the culprit . As he is investigating , Reza is approached by some of the leaders and accused of stabbing Abbas . A brief argument ensues , but is shortly ended as police begin to ambush the hideout .

 1979 Revolution : Black Friday was in development for four years ; the first two years consisted of seeking money from financiers , and the game was developed over the following two years . The game is based on events that occurred during the Iranian Revolution , namely Black Friday . The development team chose this setting shortly after the founding of development studio <unk> Stories in 2010 , as they felt the chaotic environment would make players wary of which characters to trust . The team coined the term " vérité game " to describe 1979 Revolution , based on the cinéma vérité style of documentary filmmaking . They consider it an interactive storytelling technique that combines elements from video games and documentaries , blending them with a flexible narrative . The team wanted to avoid the game being considered strictly educational , ensuring player entertainment and engagement was the highest priority . Director Navid Khonsari said that the game 's development was the result of " a culmination of doing games , falling in love with narrative storytelling and ... fascination with documentary " . 
 Khonsari first discussed the game in February 2011 , announcing it as 1979 : The Game . It was initially intended to be episodic , consisting of three or nine episodes , but was later reduced to one game . A crowdfunding campaign for the game was launched on Kickstarter in 2013 with a goal of US $ 395 @,@ 000 , but failed to reach its goal , with a total of US $ 304 @,@ 741 raised . Additional fundraising was set up on the game 's website . Following the failed campaign , the team partnered with the New Frontier Story Lab at Sundance in 2014 and 2015 , the Museum of the Moving Image in New York , and the Doris Duke Foundation . 1979 Revolution was approved through Steam Greenlight in July 2015 , and was released for Microsoft Windows and OS X on April 5 , 2016 , and for iOS devices on June 10 , 2016 . A release for Android is planned in 2016 , with console versions also in development . The game is also planned to have Oculus Rift support ; the team rewrote one of the interrogation scenes to fit with the experience . 1979 Revolution runs on the Unity game engine . Khonsari has expressed interest in a sequel , stating that it depends on the commercial success of the first game . He is also interested in developing additional games about other historical events .

 Khonsari was a child in Iran at the time of the Revolution , and left the country shortly after it ended . Khonsari developed the game with the intention of making players understand the moral ambiguity of the situation , due to the different beliefs in Iran , and to " feel the passion and the elation of being in the revolution " . When the initial game concept was conceived , the location of Iran had not been decided ; the development team was attracted to the idea of a game set during a revolution , ultimately settling on the Iranian Revolution . When representing the concept of a revolution , the development team wished to demonstrate the multiple definitions of the term . Khonsari stated that they " wanted to embrace that spirit of revolution , but we also show the trajectory of a revolution " , regarding the true negative and complicated results of real revolutions . 
 The team interviewed a group of 40 Iranians who lived in Tehran during the Iranian Revolution . The game 's setting and environments are based on photographs taken by real photojournalists during the era , such as Michel <unk> , and graffiti on the streets of Tehran at the time . The team also studied many documentaries , films , journals and documents regarding Iran , and sought feedback from academic , political , religious and cultural advisers . They interviewed over fifty history scholars , including sociologist and political scientist Jack Goldstone , gathered about 1 @,@ 500 archival photos , and collected many of Ayatollah Khomeini 's speeches during their research for the game . The home video footage featured in the game is that of Khonsari 's grandfather , recorded in Super 8 film from the 1950s to 1979 . Producer Navid Negahban , who portrayed Hajj Agha in the game , was a high school student at the time of the Revolution . He said that the script " brought back memories " , and he provided information to the writers based on his personal experiences of the time .

 The game 's performances were mostly recorded using motion capture technology , with remaining audio elements recorded later in a studio . The motion capture studio — House of Moves , in Los Angeles — uses over 70 cameras , synchronized to capture the full @-@ body motion of each actor . The 90 @-@ page script for the game was recorded in three days of shooting on April 13 – 15 , 2015 . Khonsari , who directed the performances , shot full " master " takes in which the actors performed the entire scene without cutting ; this was done to save time during production . 
 The game was initially set to follow the stories of 8 – 10 playable characters , beginning with an American @-@ Iranian State Department translator trying to free American hostages . This was later reduced to a single character : an aspiring Iranian photojournalist . Khonsari 's goal was to allow players to " see the world is a lot more gray than black and white " , achieving this by having a protagonist who experienced the Revolution . The game 's characters are based on the interviews conducted with Iranians who experienced the Revolution . Executive producer <unk> Khonsari said the characters " do not fall into the typical good guy / bad guy , but everyone is a shade of gray ... to show the complexity of history " . The team featured a variety of characters from different families , beliefs and social classes . 
 Farshad Farahat , who portrayed Hossein Shirazi in the game , was present during the 2009 Iranian protests . He appreciated the game 's interactivity , and the choices that players are forced to make . The development team felt that allowing player choice for some of the game 's dialogue and actions allowed for a more personable experience , and for players to connect with the story and characters . Khonsari felt that it allows for a better understanding of the events and experiences of the revolution . The team also ensured that most choices had some effect , stating " a subtle or significant decision has repercussions " .

 1979 Revolution : Black Friday was well received by critics . Review aggregator Metacritic calculated an average score of 81 out of 100 based on 22 reviews . Reviewers liked the game 's narrative , characters , and historical representations , though some criticism was directed at its quick @-@ time sequences , and visual quality . 
 IGN 's <unk> Rad commended the game 's blend of drama and action , as well as the realistic depiction of violence , and felt that the game 's setting and period helped demonstrate the spirit of the revolution . Andrew Todd of Gameplanet praised the game 's manner of dealing with issues like inequality , theocracy , and causes of anti @-@ Americanism , and noted that they help create the atmosphere of the story and setting . Eurogamer 's Jeffrey Matulef found the narrative 's moral ambiguity refreshing , particularly the depiction of corrupting good people . He felt that the development team being primarily Iranian added to the game 's authenticity . Kotaku 's Evan Narcisse similarly appreciated the ambiguity , noting its close imitation to the era . The choices presented in the game split reviewers ; some found them important and scary , while others found them ultimately inconsequential . 
 Eurogamer 's Matulef declared the game 's characters superior and more sympathetic over those in other games , which would depict them " as cardboard henchmen or stormtroopers " . IGN 's Rad found the character of Reza to be likable , and Game Informer 's Javy Gwaltney considered his story fascinating . The game 's acting also received high praise ; IGN 's Rad called the performances " powerful " , and Kotaku 's Narcisse felt that they have the ability to " pull players into the drama " . Gameplanet 's Todd felt that the characters often " speak in exposition rather than emotion " , but that " when the drama works , it really works " . 
 Alexander Kriss of Kill Screen found the game 's historical information to be " both genuinely educational but also tantalizing in their brevity " , noting their reinforcement of the story 's themes . IGN 's Rad commended the game 's ability to deliver enriching information " without bombarding " players . Gameplanet 's Todd deemed the setting of Iran " convincing and real " , praising its complexity and detail , although found the density of the history somewhat overwhelming . Eurogamer 's Matulef felt that the information may provide too much backstory for the characters and events , but attributed this to personal preferences . 
 Criticism was directed at the game 's quick @-@ time sequences . Kotaku 's Narcisse considered them clunky , and Eurogamer 's Matulef found them to be " poorly constructed " . Game Informer 's Gwaltney similarly felt them to be " shoehorned " in between dialogue encounters . Kill Screen 's Kriss wrote that such sequences are featured in games like The Walking Dead ( 2012 ) to reinforce a sense of urgency in players , but felt that this is unnecessary in 1979 Revolution , as " the tension already feels real enough " . The game 's visuals also received mixed responses . Game Informer 's Gwaltney considered the art and environments " impeccable " , but criticized the character models ; Eurogamer 's Matulef likewise condemned the models and textures , describing the graphics as " competent at best and an eyesore at worst " . IGN 's Rad echoed similar remarks , identifying awkward animations of background characters , and Gameplanet 's Todd felt that 1979 Revolution " lacks the polish " of works by Telltale Games .
