 By the 1990s the temple 's condition had deteriorated again and it had suffered heavy vandalism . The Richmond and Twickenham Times reported in 1994 that it was in a state of " dangerous disrepair " and had suffered from " the theft of lead from the roof and graffiti spray @-@ painted on the walls of the Georgian folly . " Vandals had also hacked away one of the wooden columns supporting the portico . In 1995 a campaign was launched to restore the temple and the garden and put them back into use for cultural purposes . The Heritage Lottery Fund provided £ 70 @,@ 000 in 1998 – 99 . Other local groups and a campaign led by the actor Sir John Gielgud provided additional funding to carry out restoration work . The restoration fund was also supported by the actors Sir Peter Hall , Sir Donald Sinden and Richard Briers , and Dame Judi Dench , Jeremy Irons and others have subsequently made donations . 
 The restoration work was undertaken by Donald Insall Associates . The temple was reopened to the public in late 1998 , and in early 1999 the garden was replanted to replicate its original Georgian appearance . The British Museum provided a copy of Roubiliac 's statue of Shakespeare to occupy the vacant niche where the original had once stood . The temple was populated with an exhibition on Garrick 's life and career , including copies of portraits by Gainsborough , Reynolds and Zoffany . The project was completed by April 1999 . 
 Today the temple is managed by Garrick 's Temple Partnership , which brings together the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames , the Garrick 's Temple to Shakespeare Trust , the Temple Trust , the Thames Landscape Strategy and Hampton Riverside Trust . The Garrick 's Temple to Shakespeare Trust is chaired by the actor Clive Francis , and Liz Crowther is a member of the Temple Management Committee . The temple is open to the public on Sunday afternoons between April and September . It is used for concerts , annual general meetings and private events , and runs an educational programme for local schoolchildren in conjunction with the nearby Orleans House .

 " Crash " is a song by American singer and songwriter Gwen Stefani from her debut solo studio album , Love . Angel . Music . Baby . ( 2004 ) . Written by Stefani and No Doubt bandmate Tony Kanal , the song uses automobile metaphors to describe a relationship , and it received mixed to positive reviews from critics .

 Stefani had been working on her solo project with Linda Perry . The two penned several songs , including lead single " What You Waiting For ? " , but Stefani found the process difficult , commenting , " It 's humiliating and intimidating even if they 're sweet and excited , because you 're drowning in their creativity . " When the two began working on a song about a deceased friend of Stefani 's , Perry began writing the lyrics and Stefani , feeling that Perry was encroaching on her territory , broke down and left . 
 Stefani 's No Doubt bandmate Tony Kanal invited her to his house so that the two could go out with friends . When she arrived , however , Kanal surprised her by playing some tracks on which he had been working and revealed that he had prepared some for Stefani . Though Stefani had wanted to work with Kanal , she was concerned that his work would not fit with her dance @-@ oriented album ; however , she called it her " favorite track that [ she had ] written so far " , and the two worked on the track , modeling it after hip hop trio Salt @-@ n @-@ Pepa .

 " Crash " received mixed reviews from critics . In a review for The New York Times , Kelefa Sanneh noted that the track " successfully conjure [ s ] up the infectious spirit of early Madonna . " David Browne of Entertainment Weekly called the song " a pricey retro fashion blurb " on which Stefani appears as " an old @-@ school , gold @-@ chained rapper " . Krissi Murison of the NME disagreed , calling it one of " the best bits of the decade of decadence " and referring to it as " Salt @-@ N @-@ Pepa 's cartoon rap " . Jason Shawhan of About.com stated that the song 's " great Narada Michael Walden bleepy synth noises [ ... ] pop out of the mix like the car stereo just decided to sing along " , and Jennifer Nine of Yahoo ! Music commented that the track had " icy @-@ cool schoolyard sass " . Eric Greenwood of Drawer B argued that the track " carelessly revisits Stefani 's blatant fondness for 80 's pop , but not even [ ... ] Tony Kanal can save her from lifeless retreads like these . " The Washington Post reviewer Sean Daly compared it to Salt @-@ n @-@ Pepa 's 1987 single " Push It " and added that Stefani " pushes it real good " . PopMatters 's Jason Damas gave it a very strong review , stating that " Stefani nails all the vocal mannerisms " and that Kanal " reveals a major mainstream pop <unk> here , especially in the way he layers the cut [ ... ] with dozens of orchestra hits [ ... ] which have been absent from almost all pop albums for a decade or more now .

 " Crash " had originally not been planned as a major single release from Love . Angel . Music . Baby . In late 2005 Stefani announced that she was pregnant ( while performing the song on tour in Fort Lauderdale , Florida ) and would be delaying her second solo album , and the song was announced as the sixth single in January 2006 . The song impacted US contemporary hit radio and rhythmic contemporary radio stations in the US on January 24 , 2006 . Because " Crash " was released as the sixth single , success was very limited since many consumers had already purchased the album , which at the time had been certified triple platinum in both the US and Canada . It debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 on February 11 , 2006 at number 95 . It reached number 45 for two weeks and remained on the chart for a total of eight weeks . The single was somewhat more successful on the pop charts , reaching number 20 on the Top 40 Mainstream and number 28 on the Pop 100 , and had some crossover success , reaching number 38 on the Rhythmic Top 40 . 
 " Crash " was the only single from Love . Angel . Music . Baby. that did not receive a CD single solicitation in Canada ; in addition , the track experienced minimal radio success , peaking at number 87 on the BDS Airplay Chart in March 2006 . 
 Due to Stefani 's pregnancy , a live music video was released instead of a narrative video . The video was directed by Sophie Muller at a performance in Anaheim , California during Stefani 's Harajuku Lovers Tour .

 = Hamurabi = 
 Hamurabi is a text @-@ based strategy video game of land and resource management first developed by Doug Dyment in 1968 . It was developed by Dyment at Digital Equipment Corporation as The Sumer Game before the rise of the commercial video game industry in the early history of video games as a computer game for fellow employee Richard Merrill 's newly invented FOCAL programming language . The game consists of ten rounds wherein the player , as the ancient Babylonian king Hammurabi , manages how much of their grain to spend on crops for the next round , feeding their people , and purchasing additional land , while dealing with random variations in crop yields and plagues . The Sumer Game was possibly inspired by the 1966 The Sumerian Game , a much more in @-@ depth text @-@ based economic simulation intended for children . 
 Multiple versions of the game were created for the FOCAL and FOCAL @-@ 69 languages , but in 1973 David H. Ahl released BASIC Computer Games , a book of games written in the BASIC programming language and the first million @-@ selling computer book , which included his version of The Sumer Game . This expanded version of the game , titled Hamurabi , quickly became the more prominent version due to the popularity of both the book and the programming language . Hamurabi influenced many later strategy and simulation games and is also an antecedent to the city @-@ building genre . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Hamurabi is a text @-@ based strategy video game centered on resource management in which the player , identified in the text as the ancient Babylonian king Hammurabi , enters numbers in response to questions posed by the game . The resources that the player must manage are people , acres of land , and bushels of grain . These are managed over the course of ten rounds , each of which represents a year . Each person can farm a set amount of land , which produces grain . Grain , in turn , can be used to feed people , who otherwise die the following round , or planted for the following year 's crop . The player may also buy or sell land to their neighbors each turn in exchange for grain . Each round begins with an adviser stating " Hamurabi : I beg to report to you " the current status of the city , including the prior year 's harvest and change in population , followed by a series of questions as to how many bushels of grain to spend on land , seeds , and feeding the people . 
 The game 's variations are driven by random numbers : the price of land is randomly decided each round from between 17 and 26 bushels per acre , the amount of bushels generated each round is randomly decided , random amounts of bushels are eaten by rats , and new people come to the city each year in random amounts . Each year also presents the possibility of a plague reducing the population by half . The game ends after ten rounds , or earlier if the entire population of the city dies or at least 45 percent of the people starve in a single round . The end @-@ game appraisal , added in the 1973 version of the game , compares the player to historical rulers — such as " Your heavy @-@ handed performance smacks of Nero and Ivan IV . " 
 = = Development = = 
 In 1968 , Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) employee Richard Merrill invented the FOCAL programming language . As an early program for the language , fellow employee Doug Dyment developed The Sumer Game , programming it for a DEC PDP @-@ 8 minicomputer . The game is sometimes erroneously attributed to Merrill in 1969 , but a 1973 program catalog by the Digital Equipment Computer Users Society ( DECUS ) lists Dyment as the original developer . The game was originally described as : " This is a simulation program / game which will run on a minimal PDP @-@ 8 system . The economy of a Sumerian city in the year 3000 B. C. is simulated in the fashion of a modern @-@ day ' business game . ' " " Business games " were text @-@ based business management simulation games , such as The Management Game , which was used in business schools such as at Carnegie Mellon University since at least 1958 . By 1961 , there were over 89 different business and economic simulation games in use , with various graphical capabilities . In 1966 , IBM employee William McKay developed a business simulation called The Sumerian Game for the Board of Cooperative Educational Services in Northern Westchester County , New York . It is not known whether The Sumer Game was inspired by the prior Sumerian game , which was a much more in @-@ depth text @-@ based economic simulation intended for children , developed in consultation with ancient Middle East history experts . 
 Multiple versions of the The Sumer Game were created ; the 1973 DECUS catalog additionally lists a French @-@ language version by Belgians J. F. <unk> and F. H. <unk> for the FOCAL @-@ 69 version of the language , and a 1978 catalog adds Ruben by James R. B. Howard II and Jimmie B. Fletcher , " a modification of the " King of Sumeria " game " with additional features . The French version of the game , however , despite being listed as " Sumer ( French ) " , described itself not as a translation of the original game , but as a translation of " Hamurabi ( The Sumer Game ) " , due to another version of the game which was already released by then . 
 Around 1971 , DEC employee David H. Ahl had written a version of The Sumer Game in the BASIC programming language . Unlike FOCAL , BASIC was run not just on mainframe computers and minicomputers , but also on personal computers , then termed microcomputers , making it a much more popular language . In 1973 , Ahl published BASIC Computer Games , a best @-@ selling book of games written in BASIC whose 1978 edition was the first million @-@ selling computer book , which included his version of The Sumer Game . The expanded version was renamed Hamurabi and added an end @-@ of @-@ game performance appraisal . The popularity of both the book and the programming language itself meant that Ahl 's version of the game became the more widely known version over the relatively obscure original , as evidenced by the 1973 French FOCAL version considering " Hamurabi " to be the more prominent name . BASIC Computer Games noted that the game was a modification of a game " written in FOCAL at DEC " , but listed the author as " unknown . " The 1978 edition of the book noted that the game 's name was intended to be " Hammurabi " , the correct spelling of the Babylonian king , but not only was one " m " dropped in the file name to fit in an eight @-@ character limit , but Ahl consistently misspelled the name inside of the game , leading to the generally accepted name of the game to be Hamurabi . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 In addition to the multiple versions of Hamurabi , several simulation games have been created as expansions of the core game . These include Kingdom ( 1974 ) by Lee Schneider and Todd <unk> , which was then expanded to Dukedom ( 1976 ) . Other derivations include King ( 1978 ) by James A. Storer , and Santa <unk> en <unk> ( 1978 ) by George Blank ; Santa <unk> added the concept of city building management to the basic structure of Hamurabi , making it an antecedent to the city @-@ building genre as well as an early strategy game . Hamurabi held the status as the forerunner of economic simulation games even after the creation of its more complicated descendants ; as late as 1983 's <unk> , critics described games with similar systems in terms of being similar to Hamurabi .

 Walter Woon Cheong Ming ( simplified Chinese : <unk> ; traditional Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> <unk> <unk> ; born 12 September 1956 ) is a Singaporean lawyer , academic , diplomat and politician . He is currently professor of law at the National University of Singapore Faculty of Law and the Dean of the Singapore Institute of Legal Education . His expertise is in company law and securities regulation . Educated at NUS and St. John 's College , Cambridge , he joined the teaching staff of the NUS Faculty of Law in 1981 and later served as Sub @-@ Dean and Vice @-@ Dean . He was Legal Adviser to the President of Singapore and Council of Presidential Advisors from 1995 to 1997 , and was appointed as professor of law in 1999 . 
 Woon was a Nominated Member of Parliament between 1992 and 1996 . He became the first Member of Parliament since 1965 to have a Private Member 's Bill become a public law in Singapore – the Maintenance of Parents Act , which was passed in 1995 . Between 1997 and 2006 , Woon served in a number of diplomatic capacities , including Ambassador to Germany ( 1998 – 2003 ) with an accreditation to Greece ( 2000 – 2003 ) , and Ambassador to Belgium with concurrent accreditation to the European Union , the Netherlands , Luxembourg and the Holy See . Woon was appointed Second Solicitor @-@ General in 2006 and Solicitor @-@ General the following year . He served as Attorney @-@ General between 2008 and 2010 , and then returned to academia .

 Woon , a Peranakan , was born on 12 September 1956 in Singapore to schoolteachers . He was a head prefect at Pasir Panjang Primary School ( which his father became principal of years later ) and a prefect while at Raffles Institution . Following his A @-@ levels he was considering business administration , but ended up accepting a scholarship from DBS Bank to study law instead . According to Woon in an April 2008 interview , " When I went for the scholarship interview , the interviewer said , ' We looked at your results and you look like you might be a lawyer ; would you like to do law ? ' I said , ' Fine , if you want to give me the scholarship to do law , I 'll do law ' . I didn 't plan to do law . " 
 He earned his Bachelor of Laws ( LL.B. ) from the National University of Singapore ( NUS ) , graduating in 1981 with first class honours . That same year , he also topped the postgraduate practice law course , winning the Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par Memorial Prize . He joined the teaching staff of the NUS Faculty of Law that year , focusing his teaching and research on company law and securities regulation . In 1983 he graduated with a Master of Laws ( LL.M. ) degree with first class honours from St. John 's College , Cambridge , which he completed on a Commonwealth Academic Staff scholarship .

 Woon was called to the Singapore Bar in 1985 . The first edition of his book Company Law was published in 1988 . The same year he became a Sub @-@ Dean of the NUS Faculty of Law , then served as Vice @-@ Dean from 1991 to 1995 . On 1 February 1999 Woon was appointed a professor of law . In November 1990 , Woon appeared before the Parliamentary Select Committee on the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore ( Amendment No. 3 ) Bill ( Bill No. 23 / 90 ) to make representations on the proposed introduction of an elected President for Singapore . He took the view that since the elected President should be politically neutral , Cabinet members should only be eligible to stand for election five years after leaving politics . 
 Never afraid to speak his mind , in July 1991 in an interview by The Straits Times Woon commented : " We effectively don 't have a Constitution . We have a law that can be easily changed by Parliament , and by the party in power because the party is Parliament . The changes themselves might not be controversial , but it is unsettling how flexible the Constitution is , unlike , say , in the United States . " In reply , Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong pointed out that past changes to the Constitution had been made only with a two @-@ thirds parliamentary majority and not done lightheartedly , as the intensive discussions and the two @-@ year gestation period of the Elected President Bill proved . He affirmed that the Constitution had to evolve to reflect the changing needs of the people , and that it could not be assumed that the Constitution , drafted in 1965 , would be the best Constitution for always and should be frozen in time . " So to say that because the Government in power changes the Constitution there is no Constitution is ridiculous , to put it mildly . " 
 = = = Nominated Member of Parliament = = = 
 Woon was a Nominated Member of Parliament ( NMP ) for three terms , from 7 September 1992 to 6 September 1994 , from 7 September 1994 to 6 September 1996 , and from 7 September 1996 till 15 December 1996 when Parliament was dissolved for the 1997 general election . 
 In 1992 at the start of the Government 's annual Speak Mandarin Campaign , the Minister for Information and the Arts George Yeo said in a newspaper article that the rising use of English by Chinese Singaporeans was a " disturbing trend " as " [ w ] e become very exposed to Western cultural influences via books , magazines and films . Some influences are good . Others are harmful , especially to the structure of the family . " This provoked Woon to respond that " [ t ] he subliminal message being sent is that those who speak English are dangerous to society and that the wider use of English threatens the social fabric of Singapore " . He deplored this view because good values were neither Asian nor Western : " Why should we confine ourselves to one or the other ? Singapore isn 't a Western society . It isn 't an Asian society . It is a cosmopolitan society . " He noted that " [ t ] he emancipation of women , the rule of law , the equality of citizens irrespective of race , language or religion , the right to representative government : These are values we have adopted from the ' decadent ' West . " 
 In September 1992 , Woon was appointed to the select committee to review the Companies ( Amendment ) Bill ( Bill No. 33 / 92 ) which proposed , among other things , that <unk> trading in securities listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore be authorised so that share transfers can be made through computerised book entries . He was a director of <unk> Ltd . ( 1989 – 2000 ) and <unk> Ltd . ( 1997 – 2001 ) , both listed on the Stock Exchange . 
 On 23 May 1994 , Woon moved a Private Member 's Bill which was eventually passed by Parliament on 2 November 1995 as the Maintenance of Parents Act . The Act , which entitles parents at least 60 years old and unable to maintain themselves adequately to apply to a tribunal for their children to be ordered to pay maintenance to them , was the first public law that originated from a private member 's bill since Singapore 's independence in 1965 . In its 5 December 1994 issue , Time magazine picked Woon as one of 100 young world leaders , the only Singaporean to make the list . 
 From 1995 to 1997 , Woon was Legal Adviser to the President of Singapore and Council of Presidential Advisors . During this time , he represented the President as junior counsel before the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal in Constitutional Reference No. 1 of 1995 , which involved the interpretation of provisions of the Constitution of Singapore touching on the ability of Parliament to curtail the President 's discretionary powers .

 Between September 1997 and September 2006 , Woon was seconded to the Foreign Service .

He then served as Ambassador to Belgium ( from 22 August 2003 ) with concurrent accreditation to the European Union , the Netherlands ( from 22 October 2003 ) , Luxembourg and the Holy See . In this capacity , he represented Singapore together with Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Law S. Jayakumar at the funeral mass of Pope John Paul II in the Vatican City on 8 April 2005 , believed to be the largest gathering of heads of state in history . In 2006 , the Vatican made Woon a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St. Gregory the Great , which is conferred on Roman Catholic men and women in recognition of their service to the Church , unusual labours , support of the Holy See , and the good example set in their communities and country .

 Woon was appointed to the post of Second Solicitor @-@ General on 3 October 2006 , and Solicitor @-@ General on 2 July 2007 . In 2007 , he was also made a Senior Counsel . Between January 2007 and 31 March 2010 , he was a member of the Advisory Board of the School of Law of the Singapore Management University . In February 2008 , Woon was appointed by the Ministry of Finance to chair a steering committee to review the Companies Act . 
 Woon became Attorney @-@ General on 11 April 2008 . Three months into the job , he created some controversy when delivering an off @-@ the @-@ cuff speech at the launch of the Law Society of Singapore 's Public and International Law Committee . He said : 
 [ W ] hen it comes to implementation [ of human rights ] , there will be arguments about where the lines are to be drawn . And when there are new so @-@ called rights , then there has to be debate – is it really a right ? ... Just because some Western societies have accepted it , doesn 't make it a human right . ... Many of these fanatics think : ' We 've decided that this is human rights , therefore when Singapore does something , we 're entitled to criticise them . ' I say rubbish . You want to do it in your society , do it in your society . Don 't come and tell us you draw the line for the rest of the world . " 
 In mid @-@ May , Woon commented that an acquitted person may not be guilty in law , but guilty in fact . Two months later , without referring directly to these remarks , Judge of Appeal V.K. Rajah wrote in a judgment that such comments could undermine confidence in the courts ' verdicts and the criminal justice system , which was based on the doctrine of the presumption of innocence . The Minister for Law K. Shanmugam was asked in Parliament on 25 August 2008 to clarify the Attorney @-@ General 's comments . Shanmugam described the presumption of innocence as an " important and fundamental principle " which the Government was " absolutely committed to upholding " . Nonetheless , it was " entirely possible for a person to have committed acts which amount to a crime and yet , there may be no conviction " , as the trial process was designed to prove guilt and not innocence . He added : " It is for the courts , and the courts alone , to exercise judicial power and decide the question of guilt , in a trial . " 
 With effect from 20 May 2008 , Woon was appointed a director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore . He also served on the Presidential Council for Minority Rights between 2008 and 2010 . 
 Woon was the first Attorney @-@ General in more than ten years to personally appear in court . On 28 July 2008 , he argued before the Court of Appeal that a woman who had manipulated her teenage lover into killing her husband should be given a life sentence . The Court held that a life sentence was inappropriate due to the defendant 's psychiatric condition , and affirmed the nine @-@ year jail term imposed by the High Court . Woon elected to take proceedings against Tang Wee Sung , chairman of the company C.K. Tang which owns <unk> department store , for the illegal purchase of a human organ – a kidney – in the first case of its kind in Singapore . The decision to do so was criticised by Dr. Lee Wei Ling , Director of the National Neuroscience Institute and daughter of Minister Mentor and former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew , in an article published in The Straits Times on 5 September 2008 . Woon replied , pointing out a number of misconceptions she held as to the facts and the law , and emphasising that the prosecution had been brought as no one was above the law . Subsequently , in response to further comments by Dr. Lee , he wrote an extended article entitled " Wrong Facts and Faulty Logic " that appeared in The Straits Times on 18 September 2008 . 
 He also prosecuted a number of contempt of court cases , including suits against Dow Jones Publishing Company ( Asia ) , Inc. for material published in The Wall Street Journal Asia ; against US @-@ based lawyer Gopalan Nair for comments on his blog ; and against three Singapore Democratic Party supporters , John Tan Liang Joo , <unk> bin Mohamed Isa and Muhammad { { { 2 } } } <unk> bin <unk> , who wore T @-@ shirts bearing the image of a kangaroo dressed in a judge 's gown outside the Supreme Court Building . On 15 March 2010 , in one of his last cases before his term of office ended , he defended the constitutionality of capital punishment in Singapore before the Court of Appeal in an appeal by a man sentenced to death for drug trafficking . 
 At the third annual Singapore Children 's Society Lecture entitled " Changing Social Mores : Protecting Children from Themselves ? " on 31 October 2009 , Woon expressed the view that prosecuting teenagers from having underage sex with each other served little purpose . " It 's basically kids having sex ... What do you do if the couple think they 're in love ? It 's less easy if the girl consents . ... The judges cannot do very much by themselves . Sending them [ the teenagers ] to jail per se will not make them reflect on their lives . That is the last thing that is going to happen . But good or ill , this is the framework that we have . " 
 Woon established a new division in the Attorney @-@ General 's Chambers for the prosecution of cases in the Subordinate Courts of Singapore to enhance the development of criminal litigation skills , and recruited a number of young and talented lawyers into the Singapore Legal Service . In 2008 he hosted the International Association of Prosecutors Conference in Singapore . He also assisted in the setting up of the Centre for International Law at NUS to improve international law expertise in Singapore and the region . He was Singapore 's alternate representative on the High Level Task Force for the Drafting of the ASEAN Charter , a key constitutional document for ASEAN , which was signed in November 2007 . Subsequently , he co @-@ authored a book entitled The Making of the ASEAN Charter ( 2009 ) . 
 Woon stepped down as Attorney @-@ General on 10 April 2010 after a two @-@ year term . In a media interview , he said that the post " was not a job I really wanted or enjoyed . I did it because I was asked to do the job . So I did my best under the circumstances with what I had . " When asked whether he had " annoyed the powers that be " , he said : 
 It 's not unlikely that I have . Look , to be fair , nobody called me in the middle of the night to say you must do this , you must do that . ... Whether or not they 're happy with me – this one you 've got to ask PM [ Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong ] . This is a mutual parting of the ways . Best to leave before you outstay your welcome , although I think amongst some people , I 've already outstayed my welcome . 
 He subsequently clarified that when he said he had outstayed his welcome he had been " thinking more about the people I prosecuted rather than anything else " , and that " I was kidding , I was being facetious " .

 Woon returned to academia at NUS , and was appointed the first Dean of the Singapore Institute of Legal Education ( <unk> ) , a company incorporated by the Singapore Academy of Law on 18 January 2010 to manage the postgraduate practical training of graduates from local and overseas universities seeking admission to the Singapore Bar , training contracts , and continuing legal education for practising lawyers . He has denied any intention to enter politics – " Why would I leave one hot seat to jump into another hot seat ? I 've said for years that I would want to go back to my natural habitat eventually . Why wouldn 't anyone believe me ? " – although when asked if he had forever ruled out a political career , he said : " Forever is a long time but definitely not now . " Subsequently , he reiterated in a Today interview : " I am not a politician and I am not interested in politics and have no desire to go into politics . I do not know why people do not believe me when I say so . I have said it a thousand times but people do not seem to believe me . " 
 Woon is currently Chairman of the Singapore International Law Society ( since 2006 ) , Judge Advocate General ( since 2007 ) , and President of the Goethe Institute Singapore ( since 2010 ) .

 Woon won a consolation prize for a short story called The Body in Question which he submitted for the 1985 National Short Story Writing Competition . In 2002 , he published his first novel , The Advocate 's Devil . This was followed three years later by The Devil to Pay ( 2005 ) . Both books are crime novels set in 1930s Singapore with Dennis Chiang , an English @-@ educated Peranakan lawyer , as the protagonist . Woon has said that fiction writing was " something I did on the side when I got tired of writing non @-@ fiction " . A reviewer of The Advocate 's Devil commented : " That the author is a lawyer first and promising novelist second is most glaring in the language used in Devil . ... This must be the first made @-@ in @-@ Singapore whodunnit that needs to be read with a dictionary at hand . " Although the protagonist Chiang 's " view of human beings other than himself is patronising at best " and might leave readers with a " rather sour aftertaste " , the novel 's " light touches of romance and compassion do much to lift the storyline " and had " masterful pacing " .

 = Joseph Barbera = 
 Joseph Roland " Joe " Barbera ( / <unk> / bar @-@ <unk> @-@ ə or / <unk> / BAR @-@ <unk> @-@ ə ; Italian pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ; March 24 , 1911 – December 18 , 2006 ) was an American animator , director , producer , storyboard artist , and cartoon artist , whose film and television cartoon characters entertained millions of fans worldwide for much of the 20th century . 
 Through his young adult years , Barbera lived , attended college , and began his career in New York City . After working odd jobs and as a banker , Barbera joined Van Beuren Studios in 1932 and subsequently Terrytoons in 1936 . In 1937 , he moved to California and while working at Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer ( MGM ) , Barbera met William Hanna . The two men began a collaboration that was at first best known for producing Tom and Jerry and live action / animated hybrid films . In 1957 , after MGM dissolved their animation department , they co @-@ founded Hanna @-@ Barbera , which became the most successful television animation studio in the business , producing programs such as The Flintstones , Yogi Bear , Scooby @-@ Doo , Top Cat , The Smurfs , Huckleberry Hound and The Jetsons . In 1967 , Hanna @-@ Barbera was sold to Taft Broadcasting for $ 12 million , but Hanna and Barbera remained head of the company until 1991 . At that time , the studio was sold to Turner Broadcasting System , which in turn was merged with Time Warner , owners of Warner Bros. , in 1996 ; Hanna and Barbera stayed on as advisors . 
 Hanna and Barbera won seven Academy Awards and eight Emmy Awards . Their cartoon shows have become cultural icons , and their cartoon characters have appeared in other media such as films , books , and toys . Hanna @-@ Barbera 's shows had a worldwide audience of over 300 million people in the 1960s and have been translated into more than 20 languages . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Joseph Barbera was born at 10 Delancey Street in the Little Italy ( Lower East Side ) section of Manhattan , New York , to immigrants Vincent Barbera ( Italian from Lebanese origin ) and Francesca <unk> , born in <unk> , Agrigento , Sicily , Italy , and he grew up speaking Italian . His family moved to Flatbush , Brooklyn , New York when he was four months old . He had two younger brothers , Larry and Ted , both of whom served in World War II . As a member of the United States Army , Larry participated in the invasion of Sicily . Ted was a fighter pilot with the United States Army Air Forces and served in the Aleutian Islands Campaign . Barbera 's father , Vincent , was the prosperous owner of three <unk> who squandered the family fortunes on gambling . By the time Barbera was 15 , his father had abandoned the family and his maternal uncle Jim became a father figure to him . 
 Barbera displayed a talent for drawing as early as the first grade . He graduated from Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn in 1928 . While in high school , Barbera won several boxing titles . He was briefly managed by World Lightweight Boxing Champion Al Singer 's manager but soon lost interest in boxing . In 1935 , Barbera married his high school sweetheart , Dorothy Earl . In school , they had been known as " Romeo and Juliet " . 
 Barbera and his wife briefly separated when he went to California . They reunited but were on the verge of another separation when they discovered that Dorothy was pregnant with their first child . They had 4 children : two sons ( Neal and an infant boy who died two days after his birth ) and two daughters ( Lynn and Jayne ) . The marriage officially ended in 1963 . Shortly after his divorce , Barbera met his second wife , Sheila Holden , at Musso & Frank 's restaurant , where she worked as bookkeeper and cashier . Unlike Dorothy , who had preferred to stay at home with the children , Sheila enjoyed the Hollywood social scene that Barbera often frequented .

 = = = Early career = = = 
 During high school , Barbera worked as a tailor 's delivery boy . During the Great Depression , he tried unsuccessfully to become a cartoonist for a magazine called The NY Hits Magazine . He supported himself with a job at a bank , and continued to pursue publication for his cartoons . His magazine drawings of single cartoons , not comic strips , began to be published in Redbook , Saturday Evening Post , and Collier 's — the magazine with which he had the most success . Barbera also wrote to Walt Disney for advice on getting started in the animation industry . Disney wrote back , saying he would call Barbera during an upcoming trip to New York , but the call never took place . 
 Barbera took art classes at the Art Students League of New York and the Pratt Institute and was hired to work in the ink and paint department of Fleischer Studios . In 1932 , he joined the Van Beuren Studios as an animator and storyboard artist . He worked on cartoon series such as Cubby Bear and Rainbow Parades , and Tom and Jerry . This Tom and Jerry series starred two humans ; it was unrelated to Barbera 's later cat @-@ and @-@ mouse series . When Van Beuren closed down in 1936 , Barbera moved over to Paul Terry 's Terrytoons studio . 
 In 1935 , Barbera created his first solo @-@ effort storyboard about a character named <unk> the Kangaroo . The storyline was of Kiko in an airplane race with another character called Dirty Dog . Terry declined to produce the story . In his autobiography , Barbera said of his efforts ... 
 " I was , quite honestly , not in the least disappointed . I had proven to myself that I could do a storyboard , and that I had gained the experience of presenting it . For now , that was enough . " 
 The original storyboard , which had been passed down through the Barbera family , went on sale at auction in November 2013 .

 Lured by a substantial salary increase , Barbera left Terrytoons and New York for the new Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer ( MGM ) cartoon unit in California in 1937 . He found that Los Angeles was suffering just as much from the Great Depression as Brooklyn and almost returned to Brooklyn . 
 Barbera 's desk was opposite that of William Hanna . The two quickly realized they would make a good team . By 1939 , they had solidified a partnership that would last over 60 years . Barbera and Hanna worked alongside animator Tex Avery , who had created Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny for Warner Bros. and directed Droopy cartoons at MGM . 
 In 1940 , Hanna and Barbera jointly directed Puss Gets the Boot , which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best ( Cartoon ) Short Subject . The studio wanted a diversified cartoon portfolio , so despite the success of Puss Gets the Boot , Barbera and Hanna 's supervisor , Fred Quimby , did not want to produce more cat and mouse cartoons believing that there were already enough cartoons of those in existence . Surprised by the success of Puss Gets the Boot , Barbera and Hanna ignored Quimby 's resistance and continued developing the cat @-@ and @-@ mouse theme . By this time , however , Hanna wanted to return to working for Ising , to whom he felt very loyal . Barbera and Hanna met with Quimby , who discovered that although Ising had taken sole credit for producing Puss Gets the Boot , he never actually worked on it . Quimby then gave Hanna and Barbera permission to pursue their cat @-@ and @-@ mouse idea . The result was their most famous creation , Tom and Jerry . 
 Modeled after the Puss Gets the Boot characters with slight differences , the series followed Jerry , the pesky rodent who continuously outwitted his feline foe , Tom . Hanna said they settled on the cat and mouse theme for this cartoon because " we knew we needed two characters . We thought we needed conflict , and chase and action . And a cat after a mouse seemed like a good , basic thought . " The revamped characters first appeared in 1941 's The Midnight Snack . Over the next 17 years , Barbera and Hanna worked exclusively on Tom and Jerry , directing more than 114 popular cartoon shorts . During World War II , they also made animated training films . Tom and Jerry relied mostly on motion instead of dialog . Despite its popularity , Tom and Jerry has often been criticized as excessively violent . Nonetheless , the series won its first Academy Award for the 11th short , The Yankee Doodle Mouse ( 1943 ) — a war @-@ time adventure . Tom and Jerry was ultimately nominated for 14 Academy Awards , winning 7 . No other character @-@ based theatrical animated series has won more awards , nor has any other series featuring the same characters . Tom and Jerry also made guest appearances in several of MGM 's live @-@ action films , including Anchors Aweigh ( 1945 ) and Invitation to the Dance ( 1956 ) with Gene Kelly , and Dangerous When Wet ( 1953 ) with Esther Williams . 
 In addition to his work in animated cartoons , Barbera and Tom and Jerry layout artist Harvey Eisenberg moonlit to run a comic book company named <unk> Publishing . Active from 1946 to 1951 , <unk> 's titles included " Red " Rabbit Comics , Foxy Fagan , and Junie Prom . 
 Quimby accepted each Academy Award for Tom and Jerry without inviting Barbera and Hanna onstage . The cartoons were also released with Quimby listed as the sole producer , following the same practice for which he had condemned Ising . Quimby once delayed a promised raise to Barbera by six months . When Quimby retired in late 1955 , Hanna and Barbera were placed in charge of MGM 's animation division . As MGM began to lose more revenue on animated cartoons due to television , the studio soon realized that re @-@ releasing old cartoons was far more profitable than producing new ones . In 1957 , MGM ordered Barbera and Hanna 's business manager to close the cartoon division and lay off everyone by a phone call . Barbera and Hanna found the no @-@ notice closing puzzling because Tom and Jerry had been so successful . 
 = = = Television = = = 
 Barbera 's first foray into television was a 1957 collaboration with Robert D. Buchanan , Colonel Bleep . The series , the first ever cartoon produced specifically for color television , would feature some of the futuristic designs and limited animation Barbera would later carry over to his other television productions . Barbera 's involvement in Colonel Bleep ( and with Buchanan ) was apparently short @-@ lived ; his only known credited involvement was a creator credit . 
 In 1957 , Barbera reteamed with his former partner Hanna to produce cartoon films for television and theatrical release . As they had at MGM , the two brought their different skills to the company ; Barbera was a skilled gag writer and sketch artist , while Hanna had a gift for timing , story construction , and recruiting top artists . Major business decisions would be made together , though each year the title of president alternated between them . A coin toss determined that Hanna would have precedence in the naming of the new company , first called H @-@ B Enterprises but soon changed to Hanna @-@ Barbera Productions . Barbera and Hanna 's MGM colleague George Sidney , the director of Anchors Aweigh , became the third partner and business manager in the company , and arranged a deal for distribution and working capital with Screen Gems , the television division of Columbia Pictures , who took part ownership of the new studio . 
 The first offering from the new company was The Ruff & Reddy Show , a series which detailed the friendship between a dog and cat . Despite a lukewarm response for their first theatrical venture , Loopy De Loop , Hanna @-@ Barbera soon established themselves with two successful television series : The Huckleberry Hound Show and The Yogi Bear Show . A 1960 survey showed that half of the viewers of Huckleberry Hound were adults . This prompted the company to create a new animated series , The Flintstones . A parody of The Honeymooners , the new show followed a typical Stone Age family with home appliances , talking animals , and celebrity guests . With an audience of both children and adults , The Flintstones became the first animated prime @-@ time show to be a hit . Fred Flintstone 's signature exclamation " <unk> <unk> doo " soon entered everyday usage , and the show boosted the studio to the top of the TV cartoon field . The company later produced a futuristic version of The Flintstones , known as The Jetsons . Although both shows reappeared in the 1970s and 1980s , The Flintstones was far more popular . 
 By the late 1960s , Hanna @-@ Barbera Productions was the most successful television animation studio in the business . The Hanna @-@ Barbera studio produced over 3000 animated half @-@ hour television shows . Among the more than 100 cartoon series they produced were The Quick Draw McGraw Show , Top Cat , Jonny Quest , The <unk> Gorilla Show , The Atom Ant / Secret Squirrel Show , Scooby @-@ Doo , Super Friends , and The Smurfs . The company also produced animated specials based on Alice in Wonderland , Jack and the Beanstalk , and Cyrano de Bergerac , as well as the feature @-@ length films Charlotte 's Web and Heidi 's Song . 
 As popular as their cartoons were with 1960s audiences , they were disliked by artists . Television programs had lower budgets than theatrical animation , and this economic reality caused many animation studios to go out of business in the 1950s and 1960s , putting many people in the industry out of work . Hanna @-@ Barbera was key in the development of an animation technique known as limited animation , which allowed television animation to be more cost @-@ effective , but often reduced quality . Hanna and Barbera had first experimented with these techniques in the early days of Tom and Jerry . To reduce the cost of each episode , shows often focused more on character dialogue than detailed animation . The number of drawings for a seven @-@ minute cartoon decreased from 14 @,@ 000 to nearly 2 @,@ 000 , and the company implemented innovative techniques such as rapid background changes to improve viewing . Critics criticized the change from detailed animation to repetitive movements by two @-@ dimensional characters . Barbera once said that their choice was to adapt to the television budgets or change careers . The new style did not limit the success of their animated shows , enabling Hanna @-@ Barbera to stay in business , providing employment to many who would otherwise have been out of work . Limited animation paved the way for future animated series such as The Simpsons , SpongeBob SquarePants , and South Park . 
 In December 1966 , Hanna @-@ Barbera Productions was sold to Taft Broadcasting ( renamed Great American Communications in 1987 ) for $ 12 million . Barbera and Hanna remained at the head of the company until 1991 . At that point , the company was sold to the Turner Broadcasting System for an estimated $ 320 million . Turner began using Hanna @-@ Barbera 's television catalog as material for its new Cartoon Network cable channel in 1992 , and by the mid @-@ 1990s Hanna @-@ Barbera was producing several original series for Cartoon Network , among them Dexter 's Laboratory and The Powerpuff Girls . In 1996 , Turner merged with Time Warner , owners of Warner Bros. , who would eventually absorb Hanna @-@ Barbera into Warner Bros. Animation . 
 Barbera and Hanna continued to advise their former company and periodically worked on new Hanna @-@ Barbera shows , including shorts for the series The Cartoon Cartoon Show and feature film versions of The Flintstones ( 1994 ) and Scooby @-@ Doo ( 2002 ) . In a new Tom and Jerry cartoon produced in 2000 , The Mansion Cat , Barbera voiced the <unk> . 
 After Hanna 's death from throat cancer in March 2001 , Hanna @-@ Barbera was absorbed into Warner Bros. Animation , with the unit dedicated to the Cartoon Network original series spun off into Cartoon Network Studios . Barbera remained active as an executive producer for Warner Bros. on direct @-@ to @-@ video cartoon features as well as television series such as What 's New , Scooby @-@ Doo ? and Tom and Jerry Tales . He also wrote , co @-@ storyboarded , co @-@ directed and co @-@ produced The Karate Guard ( 2005 ) , the return of Tom and Jerry to the big screen . His final animated project was the direct @-@ to @-@ video feature Tom and Jerry : A Nutcracker Tale ( 2007 ) . 
 = = Death = = 
 He died from natural causes at age 95 at his home in Studio City , Los Angeles on December 18 , 2006 , ending a 70 @-@ year career in animation . His wife Sheila was at his side . He was also survived by two grandchildren and five great @-@ grandchildren . He was also survived by three children from his first marriage , Jayne ( who worked for Hanna – Barbera ) , Lynn , and Neal . He is buried in a private section of the Great Mausoleum in Glendale 's Forest Lawn Memorial Park . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Most of the cartoons Barbera and Hanna created revolved around close friendship or partnership ; this theme is evident with Fred and Barney , Tom & Jerry , Scooby and Shaggy , The Jetson family and Yogi & Boo @-@ Boo . These may have been a reflection of the close business friendship and partnership that Barbera and Hanna shared for over 60 years . Professionally , they balanced each other 's strengths and weaknesses very well , but Barbera and Hanna travelled in completely different social circles . Hanna 's circle of personal friends primarily included other animators ; Barbera socialized with Hollywood celebrities — Zsa Zsa Gabor was a frequent visitor to his house . Their division of work roles complemented each other but they rarely talked outside of work since Hanna was interested in the outdoors and Barbera liked beaches and good food and drink . Nevertheless , in their long partnership , in which they worked with over 2000 animated characters , Barbera and Hanna rarely exchanged a cross word . Barbera said : " We understood each other perfectly , and each of us had deep respect for the other 's work . " Hanna once said that Barbera could " capture mood and expression in a quick sketch better than anyone I 've ever known . " 
 Barbera and Hanna were also among the first animators to realize the enormous potential of television . Leonard Maltin says the Hanna – Barbera team " held a record for producing consistently superior cartoons using the same characters year after year — without a break or change in routine their characters are not only animated superstars , but also a very beloved part of American pop culture " . They are often considered Walt Disney 's only rivals in cartoon animation . 
 Barbera and Hanna had a lasting impact on television animation . Cartoons they created often make greatest lists . Many of their characters have appeared in film , books , toys , and other media . Their shows had a worldwide audience of over 300 million people in the 1960s and have been translated into more than 20 languages . The works of Barbera and Hanna have been praised not only for their animation , but for their music . The Cat Concerto ( 1946 ) and Johann Mouse ( 1952 ) have both been called " masterpieces of animation " largely because of their classical music . 
 In all , the Hanna – Barbera team won seven Academy Awards and eight Emmy Awards , including the 1960 award for The Huckleberry Hound Show , which was the first Emmy awarded to an animated series . They also won these awards : Golden Globe for Television Achievement ( 1960 ) , Golden <unk> Award – Pacific Pioneers in Broadcasting ( 1983 ) , Pioneer Award – Broadcast Music Incorporated ( 1987 ) , Iris Award – <unk> Men of the Year ( 1988 ) , Licensing Industry Merchandisers ' Association award for Lifetime Achievement ( 1988 ) , Governors Award of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences ( 1988 ) , Jackie Coogan Award for Outstanding Contribution to Youth through Entertainment Youth in Film ( 1988 ) , Frederic W. Ziv Award for Outstanding Achievement in Telecommunications – Broadcasting Division College – Conservatory of Music University of Cincinnati ( 1989 ) , stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame ( 1976 ) , several Annie Awards , several environmental awards , and were recipients of numerous other accolades prior to their induction into the Television Hall of Fame in 1994 . In March 2005 the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences and Warner Bros. Animation dedicated a wall sculpture at the Television Academy 's Hall of Fame Plaza in North Hollywood to Hanna and Barbera . 
 In 1992 , Barbera met with pop musician Michael Jackson , an avid cartoon fan , in an unsuccessful attempt to arrange for him to sing in Tom and Jerry : The Movie . Barbera drew five quick sketches of Tom and Jerry for Jackson and autographed them . Jackson autographed a picture of himself and his niece Nicole for Barbera with the words : " To my hero of yesterday , today , and tomorrow , with many thanks for all the many cartoon friends you gave me as a child . They were all I had . – Michael " 
 = Bill Johnston ( cricketer ) = 
 William Arras Johnston ( 26 February 1922 – 25 May 2007 ) was an Australian cricketer who played in forty Test matches from 1947 to 1955 . A left arm pace bowler , as well as a left arm orthodox spinner , Johnston was best known as a spearhead of Don Bradman 's undefeated 1948 touring team , well known as " The Invincibles " . Johnston headed the wicket @-@ taking lists in both Test and first @-@ class matches on the tour , and was the last Australian to take over 100 wickets on a tour of England . In recognition of his performances , he was named by Wisden as one of its Cricketers of the Year in 1949 . The publication stated that " no Australian made a greater personal contribution to the playing success of the 1948 side " . Regarded by Bradman as Australia 's greatest @-@ ever left @-@ arm bowler , Johnston was noted for his endurance in bowling pace with the new ball and spin when the ball had worn . He became the fastest bowler to reach 100 Test wickets in 1951 – 52 , at the time averaging less than nineteen with the ball . By the end of the season , he had played 24 Tests and contributed 111 wickets . Australia won nineteen and lost only two of these Tests . In 1953 , a knee injury forced him to remodel his bowling action , and he became less effective before retiring after aggravating the injury in 1955 . In retirement , he worked in sales and marketing , and later ran his own businesses . He had two sons , one of whom became a cricket administrator . Johnston died at the age of 85 on 25 May 2007 . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Johnston took up cricket from an early age , playing with his elder brother Allan throughout the year on a backyard pitch on the family 's dairy farm , owned by his father . Beeac 's local team , which competed in the Colac District Association , occasionally had difficulty in assembling a full side . As a result , Johnston made his debut aged only twelve alongside his brother after an invitation from his schoolteacher . On debut , when a draw became a foregone conclusion , Johnston was allowed to bowl the final over , taking a wicket maiden . The following season , the brothers led Beeac 's attack , continuing to do so after moving to Colac High School , where Bill became captain of the cricket and football teams and a prefect . Johnston left school at sixteen , working in Colac , before following Allan to Melbourne in 1939 . He joined Richmond Cricket Club in the Third XI and took 6 / 16 . After five games he was promoted to the Second XI , and made his first grade debut in the last game of the 1939 – 40 season . The following season , when nineteen , he was selected for Victoria 's Sheffield Shield match against Queensland , but the Pearl Harbor attacks forced the cancellation of competitive cricket and the match did not go ahead . Johnston joined the Royal Australian Air Force along with his brother , serving for four years as a radar technician in northern Australia . It was at training camp that he first met Keith Miller . Johnston was not posted overseas , unlike his brother , who died in a plane crash in Ireland . 
 = = First @-@ class and Test debut = = 
 Prior to the Second World War , Johnston was a slow @-@ medium and left @-@ arm orthodox spin bowler , but during a practice session , he bowled a quicker ball to Jack Ryder a former Australian captain and Test batsman , who was now a Victorian and national selector . This prompted Ryder to wage a personal campaign to induce Johnston to become a pace bowler . At the same time , Richmond captain Jack Ledward wanted him to bowl spin . Upon the resumption of first @-@ class cricket in 1945 – 46 , Johnston made his first @-@ class debut against Queensland and was entrusted with the responsibility of opening the attack . His maiden wicket was that of leading Test batsman Bill Brown . Johnston took a total of 1 / 84 in a ten @-@ wicket win . He felt that the fast bowling was only for short periods with the new ball , and that he would be allowed to revert to spin bowling as the ball became older . He played a total of seven matches for the season and took 12 wickets at 35 @.@ 08 , with his best performance being 4 / 43 against arch @-@ rivals New South Wales . As a result , he missed the national selection for the tour to New Zealand . 
 As opportunities for slow bowling became infrequent , he contemplated retirement . Although he dismissed Cyril Washbrook in the first over of Victoria 's match against Wally Hammond 's touring England team of 1946 – 47 , he was skeptical about his pace bowling . After that match he did not take a wicket for the next two months . It took further encouragement from Australian captain Don Bradman after he played against Bradman 's South Australians . Bradman told Johnston that the selectors thought highly of his potential as a medium @-@ fast bowler to reinforce the short bursts of pace spearheads Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller and that pace bowlers were in short supply , whereas spinners were plentiful . In the same season , Colin McCool , Ian Johnson , Bruce Dooland and George Tribe had all played in Tests as specialist spinners . Johnston ended the season with only 12 wickets at 33 @.@ 16 from six matches .

 Johnston practised his pace bowling with new vigour , and at the start of the 1947 – 48 season , the fruits of his labour provided immediate dividends . In the opening match of the season , he delivered an opening burst of 3 / 0 for Victoria against the touring Indian team , removing Vinoo Mankad , <unk> <unk> and leading batsman Vijay Hazare , all for ducks . He took three more wickets in the second innings , to end with a match total of 6 / 96 , including Hazare for the second time . Johnston was then called into an Australian XI that played the Indians before the Tests , in what was effectively a dress rehearsal . Although the hosts lost , Johnston took 6 / 141 , all of his victims being frontline batsmen . In the last outing before the Tests , Johnston took 3 / 40 and 5 / 37 to set up a nine @-@ wicket win over New South Wales , including the wickets of Test openers Sid Barnes and Arthur Morris with the new ball at the start of the match . 
 He was rewarded with selection for four of the five Tests against India , making his debut on a sticky wicket in the First Test in <unk> taking 2 / 17 as India fell for 58 in the first innings and 1 / 11 in the second as India fell for 98 following on , resulting in an innings defeat . Johnston 's first Test wicket was Hemu Adhikari and he was not required to bat . 
 He took match figures of 5 / 48 in the Second Test in a drawn match . He batted for the first time , and remained unbeaten without scoring as Australia collapsed to be all out for 107 on sticky wicket . It was the only time that they conceded a first innings lead in the series , and persistent rain forced a draw . 
 The Third Test was Johnston 's first Test in front of his home crowd of the Melbourne Cricket Ground . In the first innings , he scored his first runs at Test level , adding five before being run out . He removed both of India 's openers , Chandu Sarwate and Mankad , and ended with 2 / 33 as Australia took a 103 @-@ run first innings lead . In the second innings , he did the same , bowling both players , and ended with 4 / 44 as Australia won by 233 runs . Johnston missed the Fourth Test in Adelaide due to injury but returned for the Fifth Test in Melbourne where he scored 23 not out and took match figures of 2 / 29 in another innings victory and Australia ended the summer with a 4 – 0 win . He headed the series averages with 16 wickets at 11 @.@ 37 . This ensured his selection for the 1948 tour of England as part of Bradman 's Invincibles . However , Johnston was less successful outside the Tests , ending the summer with 20 wickets at 21 @.@ 08 . 
 = = Invincibles tour = = 
 During the Ashes tour , Johnston roomed with Doug Ring who was a team @-@ mate in the Richmond and Victorian cricket teams . As Ring was a leg @-@ spin bowler , he and Johnston were in direct competition for a place in the eleven . Australia had traditionally fielded its first @-@ choice team in the tour opener , which was customarily against Worcestershire . When Johnston was omitted in favour of Ring , it appeared he would not be in Bradman 's Test plans . Bradman changed his mind on the morning of the First Test in Trent Bridge when rain was forecast . Johnston was played in the hope of exploiting a wet wicket . He showed his credentials by bowling a total of 84 overs to help Australia to grind out a victory . England batted first and with strike bowler Ray Lindwall breaking down on the first day , Johnston removed Bill Edrich and Joe Hardstaff junior in one over to leave England at 4 / 46 . He returned later in the innings to take 5 / 36 from 25 overs as England were bowled out for 165 . After scoring an unbeaten 17 in a last @-@ wicket partnership of 33 , Johnston bowled 59 overs in the second innings to take 4 / 147 in Lindwall 's absence . Johnston bowled the most overs of any player and was the leading wicket @-@ taker for the match as Australia took a 1 – 0 lead . 
 He scored his career Test best of 29 in another tail @-@ wagging performance before taking match figures of 4 / 105 as Australia took a 2 – 0 lead in the Second Test at Lord 's . Johnston removed Denis Compton , England 's leading run @-@ scorer for the series , in both innings . In an effective containing performance , Johnston took 3 / 67 in the first innings of the Third Test at Old Trafford in 45 @.@ 5 overs , before the match ended in a rain @-@ affected draw . After supporting Lindwall in a 48 @-@ run partnership in the first innings of the Fourth Test , Johnston took 4 / 95 in the second innings , including three in the space of 16 runs . Australia went on to break the world record Test run @-@ chases record to take a 3 – 0 lead . Johnston rounded off the series with match figures of 6 / 60 in the Fifth Test at The Oval from 43 @.@ 3 overs . Johnston took the last three wickets in the match as Australia completed a 4 – 0 series result with an innings victory . In all , Johnston finished with 27 Test wickets at an average of 23 @.@ 33 , equal to Lindwall . 
 In both the Test and county matches during the 1948 tour , Johnston carried the heaviest workload , bowling nearly 200 overs more than any other member of the squad . He was the leading wicket @-@ taker with 102 wickets at 16 @.@ 42 , and the last Australian to take a century of wickets on an Ashes tour . His best performances in the tour games included a match haul of 10 / 40 against Yorkshire at Bradford , bowling finger spin on a wet pitch , 8 / 68 against Somerset and 11 / 117 against Hampshire . After carrying a heavy workload in the early stages of the tour , he was used more sparingly in the latter stages . As the tour progressed Johnston improved his control as he restrained England 's batsmen between the new ball bursts of Lindwall and Miller . Johnston finished the season at the top of the first @-@ class bowling averages and was chosen as one of Wisden 's Five Cricketers of the Year . Wisden opined that " no Australian made a greater personal contribution to the playing success of the 1948 side " . Jack Fingleton wrote that Australia had never sent a greater left @-@ hander to England . 
 = = Later career = = 
 Upon returning to Australia , Johnston played in the 1948 – 49 Australian season , which was purely domestic with no visiting international teams . He took a total of 32 wickets at 31 @.@ 84 in nine matches . He saved his best performance for New South Wales . He took 3 / 47 and 5 / 62 and his wickets included future Test batsmen Jim Burke , Jimmy de Courcy and Jack Moroney , but was unable to stave off defeat . Apart from a 5 / 65 against Queensland he never took more than three wickets in an innings for the season . He also managed his highest first @-@ class score , recording 38 against South Australia . 
 = = = 1949 – 50 tour of South Africa = = = 
 Johnston 's next international assignment was the 1949 – 50 tour to South Africa . The tour started badly ; after taking a total of 5 / 28 in an innings win over Zululand in a non @-@ first @-@ class match , he fell asleep at the wheel outside Durban following a team function . He missed a turn , skidded across gravel and flipped and crashed his car . After a few hours , medical help arrived and Johnston was hospitalised . The team manager Chappie Dwyer was mistakenly informed that Johnston had died , and the bowler later described his injury as a " nine @-@ iron divot in the top of my skull " . Johnston started coughing up blood , and he and Dwyer sought to have the accident private . However , news was leaked back to Australia , and Johnston 's mother fainted ; her husband and other son had already died and she was fearful that her lone remaining relative had joined them . After complaining of chest pain , it was later discovered that Johnston had two broken ribs and he had to rest further . 
 Keith Miller was called to South Africa as emergency cover , but luckily for the <unk> , there were almost two months of warm @-@ up matches before the Tests started . Johnston recovered in time for the final tour match before the Tests , a match against a South African XI , effectively a full @-@ strength Test team . Johnston took 2 / 81 in his only innings but it was enough for captain Lindsay Hassett to put him in the Test team . 
 Johnston took 2 / 21 in the first innings of the First Test against South Africa at Johannesburg and the hosts were forced to follow on . He took 6 / 44 including the last three wickets in the second innings , his career best innings figures in Test cricket , helping Australia take an innings victory and a 1 – 0 series lead . He removed Owen Wynne and Jack Cheetham in both innings . After going wicketless in the first innings , he took three wickets in the Second Test victory at Cape Town . He then took 11 wickets in the next two tour games , including 6 / 20 against Border . Johnston was more prominent in the Third Test at Durban with match figures of 8 / 114 as Australia took the series 3 – 0 . South Africa had reached 2 / 242 in their first innings when Johnston removed their captain Dudley Nourse , precipitating a loss of 8 / 69 on a sticky wicket as the hosts were bowled out for 311 . He ended with 4 / 75 . Australia then collapsed for 75 on a sticky wicket and South Africa had a lead of 321 when they had reached 2 / 85 in their second innings . Johnston then removed John Nel and Billy Wade without further addition to the score , sparking a collapse of 8 / 14 that saw the home team all out for 99 . Johnston ended with 4 / 39 and Australia went on to reach the victory target . On an erratic surface , six of his victims were bowled or lbw . 
 After taking 5 / 18 in an innings win over North Eastern Transvaal , Johnston was ineffective in the high @-@ scoring drawn Fourth Test , taking 1 / 68 . He took a total of 6 / 52 and scored 24 not out against Griqualand West , and finished the Test campaign with 3 / 22 in the Fifth Test in Port Elizabeth , taking all his wickets in the second innings as Australia completed an innings victory and took the series 4 – 0 . It was a successful tour for Johnston , with 23 wickets at 17 @.@ 04 , taking the most wickets at the lowest average among the Australian pacemen among those who took more than three wickets . The entire first @-@ class campaign was even more successful ; Johnston took a total of 7 / 37 as the Australians ended their tour with an innings victory over a South African XI . Johnston ended the African summer with 53 wickets at 14 @.@ 09 . 
 = = = 1950 – 51 season = = = 
 The 1950 – 51 Ashes series was Australia 's first home series in three years . In the opening match of the season for Victoria against the touring Englishmen , Johnston warmed up by scoring 30 and taking a total of 3 / 89 , including the wickets of leading batsmen Compton and Hutton . In the First Test at Brisbane , England were caught on a sticky wicket and Johnston took 5 / 35 , removing Reg Simpson , Washbrook , Evans , Compton and Arthur McIntyre , as England declared at 7 / 68 . He then took 2 / 30 in the second innings , removing Evans and Compton for a second time as Australia won the match to take a 1 – 0 lead . In the Second Test at the MCG , Johnston took 2 / 28 and 4 / 26 as Australia scraped home by 28 runs , defending a target of only 179 on a cracked pitch . Johnston had quiet Third Test with only a total of 1 / 82 in an innings victory , but he returned to form in the Fourth Test in Adelaide with 3 / 58 and 4 / 73 in a 274 @-@ run win . He did much of the heavy lifting in the second innings , removing the top four English batsmen , Hutton , Simpson , Washbrook and Compton . Johnston struggled in the final Test with match figures of 1 / 91 as England won their only Test of the series . Johnston led the wicket takers list , with 22 at 19 @.@ 18 , as Australia took a 4 – 1 series triumph . Johnston had saved his best performances for the Tests ; he managed only 19 wickets at 40 @.@ 37 in eight matches for Victoria during the season , and never took more than two wickets in an innings . He was particularly unsuccessful against New South Wales , taking a total of 3 / 190 in two matches . Overall , he took 41 wickets at 29 @.@ 00 for the season . 
 = = = 1951 – 52 season = = = 
 The 1951 – 52 home series was the first tour by the West Indies for two decades , and Johnston again led the wicket takers with 23 at 22 @.@ 08 , as Australia won the series 4 – 1 . Johnston started the series steadily with match figures of 3 / 90 in the First Test , removing vice @-@ captain Jeff Stollmeyer and leading batsmen Frank Worrell and Everton Weekes as Australia scraped home by three wickets . 
 He then took 3 / 80 and 2 / 61 and scored 28 in the Second Test , which Australia won by seven wickets . The Tests were interrupted by two consecutive matches between Victoria and New South Wales . In the first match , Johnston took 6 / 159 in the only innings of a high @-@ scoring draw , including four Test batsmen . In the following match , he scored 32 before taking career best innings figures of 7 / 114 . He removed Barnes , Morris , Moroney and Miller , before returning to dismiss future Test teammates Richie Benaud and Alan Davidson . Nevertheless , New South Wales took a 159 @-@ run lead , and after Victoria replied with 416 , Johnston struck three times with the new ball , removing Barnes , Morris and Burke . He ended with 3 / 33 as New South Wales hung on for a draw at 7 / 166 . 
 Johnston 's best match performance came in the only loss in the Third Test at Adelaide . This happened when captain Lindsay Hassett was a late withdrawal due to injury , leaving Australia with an unbalanced team with only four specialist batsmen who could not consolidate the work done by the five specialist bowlers . It was in this match that Johnston passed 100 Test wickets , the fastest player to do so . Exploiting a wet patch at the striker 's end , Johnston took 6 / 62 in the first innings as 22 wickets fell on the first day in treacherous batting conditions ; however he was unable to stop an Australian defeat , taking only 1 / 50 in the second innings as the tourists reached their target of 233 with six wickets in hand . 
 At this stage Johnston was at the peak of his career in terms of bowling average and wickets taken per match . In his 24 Tests to the end of the series , he had taken 111 wickets at 19 @.@ 22 , with Australia winning 19 and losing two . In the Fourth Test in Melbourne , Johnston took match figures of 5 / 110 , removing Weekes in both innings , before coming to the crease in the second innings to partner Doug Ring . Australia were 9 / 222 in pursuit of 260 for victory , with the series finely poised 2 – 1 . The crowd of 30 @,@ 000 and the constabulary were resigned to an Australian defeat , with the police officers moving into position to stop the customary pitch invasion at the end of the match . However , the Richmond teammates had other ideas and put together a last wicket partnership of 38 , which sealed an Australian victory by one wicket . Ring thought that playing for a draw was impractical , so he decided to attack , while Johnston attempted to hold up his end with a series of defensive shots . The West Indian captain John Goddard placed his fielders halfway to the boundary , allowing Johnston to easily take singles , while Ring was able to clear the infield easily . The Richmond pair thought that Goddard 's captaincy was poor . Johnston eventually brought up the winning run by turning Frank Worrell for a single behind square leg , 35 minutes after he came to the crease . 
 As a result , the mayor of Richmond granted the pair the freedom of the city . The scoreboard at Punt Road Oval , Richmond 's home ground was named the Ring @-@ Johnston scoreboard in honour of their feat . Johnston took match figures of 3 / 55 in the Fifth Test as Australia completed the series with a win . Johnston ended the season by taking a total of 7 / 86 in Victoria 's innings win over South Australia . He ended the entire first @-@ class season with 54 wickets at 20 @.@ 63 . 
 = = Decline = = 
 = = = 1952 – 53 series = = = 
 Johnston could not maintain his form in the 1952 – 53 home series against South Africa . In the three matches leading up the Tests , he took only six wickets at 44 @.@ 83 for Victoria . Johnston took match figures of 3 / 83 , 2 / 114 and 2 / 97 as the first three Tests were won , lost and won , respectively . In the meantime , he took his career @-@ best performance at first @-@ class level , taking 8 / 52 in the first innings of a match against Queensland , which remained his best first @-@ class innings analysis . He added 2 / 59 in the second innings to help set up a nine @-@ wicket win . In the return match , he took 4 / 92 and 6 / 54 to set up a seven @-@ wicket win , with six of his victims being Test players . 
 In the Fourth Test at Adelaide , both Lindwall and Miller broke down in the middle of match , leaving Australia two bowlers short . In their absence , Johnston took 5 / 110 and 2 / 67 but Australia were unable to force a win . He sent down 587 balls for the entire match . Lindwall and Miller were unable to play in the Fifth Test , and in their absence , the South Africans were able to score heavily . Johnston had a large workload , taking 6 / 152 and 1 / 114 as the tourists won by six wickets to level the series 2 – 2 . On this occasion , Johnston sent down 662 balls for the match . In the last two Tests , Johnston conceded more than 100 runs in three of the four innings with the increased burden in his colleagues ' absence ; the only previous occasion when he had conceded a century of runs in an innings was in the First Test against England in 1948 when Lindwall broke down mid @-@ match . Johnston was again Australia 's leading wicket @-@ taker with 21 wickets , but his average of 35 @.@ 10 was substantially higher than in previous seasons , as Australia struggled to a 2 – 2 series result . It was the first time Australia had not won a Test series since the 1938 Ashes tour . His best effort against the South Africans was in the second tour match between Victoria and the tourists , in which he totalled 7 / 122 . Aided by his two ten @-@ wicket match hauls against Queensland , Johnston totalled 59 wickets at 26 @.@ 47 for the season . 
 = = = 1953 Ashes = = = 
 After injuring his knee in a festival match at the beginning of the tour at East Molesey , Johnston attributed the injury to a lack of attention to detail . His new boots had spikes that were longer than usual , and the physiotherapist had failed to strap his ankle before the match . His knee soon failed . Johnston missed the first six first @-@ class matches , and with it a month of cricket . He returned against the Minor Counties in late May and took 3 / 20 in an innings win . He staked his claim for selection in the final two tour matches before the Tests ; he took 4 / 65 and 3 / 49 against Sussex and then led the way in a win over Hampshire , much as he did five years earlier , taking 5 / 75 and 4 / 21 . He had taken 20 wickets at 13 @.@ 35 in his four tour matches and was duly selected to play in the First Test at Trent Bridge . He was economical but unpenetrative , conceding 36 runs in 36 overs without taking a wicket in a rain @-@ affected draw . Between Tests , he removed Hutton in both innings of a match against Yorkshire , but it came at a cost ; he ended with 4 / 186 . He took match figures of 4 / 161 in the Second Test but England held on for a draw with three wickets in hand , as a recurrence of the knee injury while fielding intervened again . He then had an operation to remove cartilage in his right knee ; this allowed him more leg movement but also destabilised his knee . The same surgeon had operated on Compton 's knee . After missing another month of cricket , Johnston returned with a remodelled action , and hauls of 4 / 51 , 6 / 63 and 6 / 39 against Surrey , Glamorgan and Essex respectively , saw Johnston return for the Fifth Test at The Oval . Although the pitch was helpful for spin , a total of 74 overs in the match yielded 3 / 146 , as Johnston was unable rekindle the form of 1948 following his knee injury . Compton and Edrich batted cautiously to ensure the victory that saw England reclaim the Ashes 1 – 0 . He managed only seven Test wickets at 49 @.@ 00 , but his first @-@ class form remained strong . After the Tests , Johnston took match figures of 11 / 73 and 9 / 124 in consecutive matches against Kent and the South of England ; Australia won both by an innings . He ended with 75 wickets at 20 @.@ 54 for the entire tour . His injuries were considered a major factor in Australia 's loss of the series . 
 = = = 1953 – 54 season = = = 
 Johnston returned to Australia and participated in the 1953 – 54 season , which was purely domestic . He continued his recent strong form against Queensland in the first match , taking 4 / 56 and 5 / 61 to set up a 254 @-@ run win . However , the rest of the season was not so productive ; Johnston managed only 20 more wickets in the remaining seven matches at an average of almost 50 . He ended the season with 29 wickets at 38 @.@ 24 . 
 = = = 1954 – 55 Ashes = = = 
 The 1954 – 55 series against England was to be Johnston 's last Test success . He took 19 wickets at 22 @.@ 26 in the first four Tests before missing the last as England took the low @-@ scoring series 3 – 1 . After going wicketless in the opening season 's tour match against the Englishmen , Johnston took a total of 7 / 122 against South Australia and retained his place in the team . He took 3 / 106 as Australia won the First Test by an innings . 
 In the Second Test at Sydney , Johnston took 3 / 56 and 3 / 70 in a low @-@ scoring match , removing Hutton in both innings . He had another notable innings when he joined Neil Harvey with 78 runs needed for victory on a difficult batting surface against the hostile pace of Frank Tyson and Brian Statham . In particular , Tyson was bowling with a strong tailwind and a slips cordon standing around 40 yards behind the bat . They put together a stubborn 39 run tenth @-@ wicket partnership in 40 minutes , which gave Australia hope of an unlikely victory with Harvey still attacking . Harvey felt that Tyson was almost out of energy after a spell of extreme pace , and that the remaining bowlers were not beyond Johnston . However , a Tyson ball that was aimed at the ribcage saw Johnston fend at the ball ; he was caught behind for 11 , giving England a dramatic victory . After taking 1 / 26 in the first innings , Johnston took 5 / 85 in the second innings of his last Test performance in front of his home crowd at the MCG , with some tight spin on a dry surface . He removed Edrich for 13 and Peter May for 91 before cleaning up the tail with three quick wickets . This left Australia 240 to win but there was to be no fairytale as England won by 128 runs . Johnston then took match figures of 4 / 80 in the Fourth Test at Adelaide , in what was to be the his last Test on Australian soil . Australia lost the match and England retained the Ashes ; it was Australia 's third consecutive Test defeat , the first time they had suffered a hat @-@ trick of defeats since the infamous Bodyline series of 1932 – 33 . Johnston had less success outside the Tests , which were played on bowler @-@ friendly surfaces . He managed only 13 wickets at 30 @.@ 38 in five matches . 
 = = = 1954 – 55 tour of the West Indies = = = 
 His career ended unhappily on Australia 's first ever tour to the West Indies . He took match figures of 2 / 126 in the First Test in Kingston , Jamaica in a high @-@ scoring win . These were to be his last Test wickets as he took a total of 0 / 60 in the Second Test in Trinidad . He was retained for the Third Test but injured himself early in the match while fielding and neither batted nor bowled . He was injured for the next month and missed the Fourth Test but returned for the Fifth . Early on the first day he suffered yet another knee injury as he changed direction while attempting to catch a Clyde Walcott pull shot . His teammates Alan Davidson and Peter Burge removed a bench from the dressing room wall and used it as an improvised stretcher to carry Johnston from the ground ; his Test career ended without bowling or batting in either of his last two matches . His final Test wicket had been that of Glendon Gibbs in the second innings of the First Test . In six first @-@ class matches for the tour , he managed only nine wickets at 51 @.@ 00 . 
 Johnston retired from first @-@ class cricket after the tour , but played grade cricket for Richmond until the end of 1958 – 59 , taking 452 wickets at 16 @.@ 61 in his grade career . 
 = = Style = = 
 Standing 188 cm , Johnston had a smooth ten @-@ pace approach to the wicket , with an idiosyncratic dip of his head before the instant of delivery . He had success on moist English pitches , with deliveries from over the wicket because of the increased chances of leg before wicket decisions and to induce edges from balls angling across the batsmen . His stock ball swung into the right @-@ hander , but he mixed this with an away swinger . The late swing in flight which generated the batsman 's uncertainty over the direction in which the ball would move was responsible for the majority of Johnston 's wickets in England . Although his pace was lower than that generated by Lindwall or Miller , he was noted for his accuracy and ability to revert to spin bowling on sticky wickets . Nevertheless , his casual run @-@ up belied a deceptive pace . He possessed strong hands , attributed to his milking of the family 's cattle herd . Johnston was an economical bowler , conceding only 2 @.@ 07 runs per over . He was known for his elbow movement and flailing arms during his delivery action , with one commentator noting " one of these days an umpire will get a poke in the eye " . Johnston also had a reputation of visibly enjoying himself on field , putting his hand on his hips and grinning , regardless of the result of his delivery . According to teammate Alan Walker , Johnston bowled at least as many bouncers as his colleagues , but because of his happy nature , observers thought that he eschewed the short ball . 
 His feet position were peculiar in that his front foot was parallel to the crease and his back foot perpendicular , the opposite of the conventional posture . This inhibited his follow through and put more stress on his ankles and shins . As a result , his right ankle had to be bound tightly in order to prevent jarring from his awkward delivery . He also followed the recommendation of Bill O 'Reilly and tied a towel around his shins to cut off the circulation and to dull the pain . After the knee injury , he altered his action into a more conventional one so that his front foot pointed towards the batsman . This eased the pressure on his body , but his ability to move the ball diminished . Johnston was a keen student of the game , and although he did not see a state match until his debut , and watched only one Test before his debut , he supplemented his knowledge by reading cricket books . During his early first @-@ class career , upon returning from matches , he would read articles by Bradman , Bert Oldfield and Arthur Mailey from a book given to him by his schoolteacher when he was a schoolboy . 
 Bradman rated him as " Australia 's greatest left @-@ hand bowler " . As a result of his ability to bowl spin and pace , teammate Neil Harvey noted that the team effectively had 13 players : " we reckoned Bradman was worth two and Bill Johnston was worth two " . Harvey felt that Johnston was the best team man , and Bill Brown noted Johnston 's work ethic in bowling for long periods after Lindwall and Miller were given the best opportunities with the new ball . Ian Johnson described him as " the finest team man and tourist " in cricket and valued his personality , while Miller described him as " the most popular man in cricket " . He sometimes amused others by demonstrating his double <unk> , wrapping his feet around the back of his neck . He is reputed to have nearly drowned when he attempted this in the bath at Lord 's . 
 Johnston had a reputation as a poor batsman , averaging less than 13 in Tests and first @-@ class matches without making a half century . He headed the averages in England in 1953 , being not out 16 times out of 17 and averaging 102 @.@ 00 . He attributed this to " a lot of application , concentration and dedication " , stating that " class always tells " . When Hassett realised that Johnston was atop the batting averages , he told Johnston to tell the opposing captain of this fact and ask them to refrain from dismissing him . In the last match against T. N. Pearce 's XI at Scarborough , English Test paceman Alec Bedser bowled wide of the stumps and advised Johnston not to do anything that would lose him his wicket . In 1954 – 55 he made 39 for the last wicket with Neil Harvey as they chased 78 for victory before he edged Frank Tyson to the wicket @-@ keeper Godfrey Evans . 
 " Bill Johnston did his bit for his team with true Aussie grit . His speciality stroke was a right @-@ handed , one @-@ handed , back @-@ handed , glancing scoop off the line of his bum – cricket 's equivalent of tennis ' back @-@ handed retrieve . It bought him a dozen runs – plus a considerable amount of pain when he failed to make contact and the ball clipped his maximus gluteus ! " – Frank Tyson , In the Eye of the Typhoon . 
 = = Life after cricket = = 
 Johnston had a varied career after cricket , holding a variety of jobs . These included acting as a sales representative for Dunlop sports goods and shoes , a publican and an apartment building manager . In his later working career , he ran a post office on the Gold Coast of Queensland after he and his wife moved there . Outside cricket , Johnston also played baseball to a high standard . He won the world 's junior championship for throwing a distance of 125 yards ( 114 m ) , and he broke the national baseball long distance record with a 132 @-@ yard ( 121 m ) throw in September 1945 . 
 He was married to Judy and they had two sons , David and Peter . David played 10 matches for South Australia at first @-@ class level ; he later became an administrator and was the Chief Executive of the Tasmanian Cricket Association at the time of his father 's death . After the death of his wife in 2004 , Johnston moved from the Gold Coast to a Sydney nursing home to be close to his son Peter . He died peacefully in a Sydney nursing home on 25 May 2007 . Also , he is survived by a younger brother , Bruce .

 The Westland WS @-@ 61 Sea King is a British licence @-@ built version of the American Sikorsky S @-@ 61 helicopter of the same name , built by Westland Helicopters . The aircraft differs considerably from the American version , with Rolls @-@ Royce Gnome engines ( derived from the US General Electric <unk> ) , British @-@ made anti @-@ submarine warfare systems and a fully computerised flight control system . The Sea King was primarily designed for performing anti @-@ submarine warfare ( ASW ) missions . A Sea King variant was adapted by Westland as troop transport known as the Commando . 
 In British service , the Westland Sea King provided a wide range of services in both the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force . As well as wartime roles in the Falklands War , the Gulf War , the Balkans conflict , the Iraq War and the Afghanistan War , the Sea King is perhaps most well known in its capacity as a Royal Navy Search and Rescue ( red and grey livery ) and RAF Search and Rescue Force ( yellow livery ) helicopter . The Sea King was also adapted to meet the Royal Navy 's requirement for a ship @-@ based airborne early warning platform . 
 As of 2014 , the WS @-@ 61 Sea King remains in operation in Britain , as well as several export customers : Germany , Norway , Egypt and India . Some operators have replaced , or are planning to replace , the Sea King with more modern helicopters , such as the NHIndustries NH90 and the AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin .

 Westland Helicopters , which had a long @-@ standing licence agreement with Sikorsky Aircraft to allow it to build Sikorsky 's helicopters , extended the agreement to cover the Sikorsky SH @-@ 3 Sea King soon after the Sea King 's first flight in 1959 . Westland proceeded to independently develop the Sea King , integrating a significant proportion of components from British suppliers ; key changes include the use of a pair of Rolls @-@ Royce Gnome turboshaft engines and the implementation of an automatic flight control system . On this matter , authors Jim Thorn and Gerald Frawley stated that : " Despite appearances , Westland 's Sea King [ is a ] very different aircraft from Sikorsky 's " . Many of the differences between the Westland @-@ built Sea King and the original helicopter were as a result of differing operational doctrine . While the U.S. Navy Sea Kings were intended to be under tactical control of the carrier from which they operated , the Royal Navy intended its helicopters to be much more autonomous , capable of operating alone , or coordinating with other aircraft or surface vessels . This resulted in a different crew arrangement , with operations being controlled by an observer rather than the pilot , as well as fitting a search radar . 
 The Royal Navy selected the Sea King to meet a requirement for an anti @-@ submarine warfare ( ASW ) helicopter to replace the Westland Wessex , placing an order with Westland for 60 SH @-@ 3D Sea Kings in June 1966 . The prototype and three pre @-@ production aircraft were built by Sikorsky at Stratford , Connecticut and shipped to the United Kingdom to act as trials and pattern aircraft . The first of the SH @-@ 3Ds was initially fitted with General Electric <unk> and , after being shipped from the United States , was flown in October 1966 from the dockside at Avonmouth to Yeovil airfield . The other three were delivered from the docks , by road to Yeovil , for completion with British systems and Rolls @-@ Royce Gnome engines . The first Westland @-@ built helicopter , designated Sea King <unk> , flew on 7 May 1969 at Yeovil . The first two helicopters were used for trials and evaluation by Westland and the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment ; subsequent production Sea Kings were delivered to the Royal Navy 's 700 Naval Air Squadron from August 1969 onwards . 
 By 1979 , the Royal Navy had ordered 56 <unk> and 21 HAS2s to meet the anti @-@ submarine requirements , these were also configured for the secondary anti @-@ ship role . The Westland Sea King was updated and adapted for numerous roles , subsequent variants include the <unk> , HAS5 and <unk> . Changes from initial production aircraft included an expansion of the cabin and upgraded engines . 
 = = = Commando and further developments = = = 
 One of the most extensively modified variants was the Westland Commando , operated by the Royal Navy as the HC4 . The Commando had capacity for up to 28 fully equipped troops and had originally been developed to meet an Egyptian Air Force requirement . Due to the deletion of the amphibious capability , not required in the Egyptian desert , the most noticeable change from the Sea King was the deletion of the side floats , the main undercarriage being carried on stub sponsons . An improved variant of the Egyptian Commando , with changes including the fitting of folding blades common to the ASW variants , was designated as the Sea King HC4 by the Royal Navy and all the aircraft were new build . First flying on 26 September 1979 , due to its operational range of up to 600 nautical miles without refuelling , the HC4 ' Commando ' became an important asset for amphibious warfare and troop transport duties , in particular . Several Royal Naval Air Squadrons have operated the Commando variant , such as 845 Naval Air Squadron , 846 Naval Air Squadron and 848 Naval Air Squadron . In British service , the Sea King HC4 was deployed on operations in the Falklands , the Balkans , both Gulf Wars , Sierra Leone , Lebanon and Afghanistan . Towards the end of the Sea King 's operational life , several <unk> were repurposed by the removal of the ASW equipment , as troop transports . In 2010 , the last of the UK 's converted ASW Sea Kings to troop transports were retired . 
 In the 1970s , Westland 's experience with the Sea King led the company to conduct the British Experimental Rotor Program ( BERP ) , in coordination with the Royal Aircraft Establishment , which applied innovations in composite materials and new design principles to the helicopter rotor . Initial trials carried out with active Sea Kings found several advantages to the BERP rotor , including a longer fatigue life and improved aerodynamic characteristics . Subsequent Westland helicopters , such as the record @-@ breaking Lynx and the AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin , took advantage of BERP rotors for greater performance . Westland equipped later @-@ built Sea Kings with the new composite rotors as well . 
 Westland has produced a total of 330 Sea Kings ; export customers include the Indian Naval Air Arm , the German Navy , the Royal Australian Navy , and the Royal Norwegian Air Force . The last of the Royal Navy 's Sea Kings in the ASW role was retired in 2003 , being replaced by the AgustaWestland Merlin HM1 . The Sea King Airborne Surveillance and Control ( ASaC ) variant is expected to be replaced around the introduction of the two Queen Elizabeth @-@ class aircraft carriers . The UK has also planned to retire the HC4 and search and rescue variants in March 2016 . 
 = = = Search and rescue = = = 
 A dedicated search and rescue ( SAR ) version , the <unk> , was developed for the RAF Search and Rescue Force . The type entered service in 1978 to replace the Westland Whirlwind <unk> A 16th helicopter was ordered shortly after , and following the Falklands War of 1982 , three more examples were purchased to enable operation of a SAR flight in the islands , initially from Navy Point on the north side of Stanley harbour , and later from RAF Mount Pleasant . In 1992 , six further helicopters were ordered to replace the last remaining Westland Wessex helicopters in the SAR role , entering service in 1996 . The six Sea King <unk> featured updated systems , including a digital navigation system and more modern avionics . 
 Westland also manufactured SAR versions of the Sea King for the Royal Norwegian Air Force , the German Navy and the Belgian Air Force . On SAR variants , the cabin was enlarged by a stretch of the fuselage behind the door ; another key feature , used for additional flotation in the unusual event of a water landing , inflatable buoyancy bags were housed inside the aircraft 's sponsons . Upgrades and changes made to SAR Sea Kings include the addition of radar warning receivers , a cargo hook for the underslung carriage of goods , and the redesigning of the cockpit for compatibility with night vision goggles . 
 As of 2006 , up to 12 <unk> / 3As were dispersed across the UK , a further two <unk> were attached to the Falkland Islands , providing 24 @-@ hour rescue coverage . Some Royal Navy HAS5 ASW variants were adapted for the SAR role and served with 771 Naval Air Squadron , Culdrose and HMS Gannet SAR Flight at Prestwick Airport in Scotland . As of 2009 , they are expected to remain in service until 2016 , being replaced with civilian operated SAR rotorcraft . Both Prince Andrew , Duke of York and Prince William , Duke of Cambridge have flown SAR Sea Kings in front @-@ line roles . 
 = = = Airborne early warning = = = 
 The Royal Navy 's airborne early warning ( AEW ) capability had been lost when the Fairey Gannet aeroplane was withdrawn after the last of the RN 's fleet carriers was decommissioned in 1978 . During the Falklands War , a number of warships were lost and casualties suffered due to the lack of an AEW platform . The proposed fleet cover by the RAF Shackleton <unk> was too unresponsive and at too great a distance to be practical . Consequently , two Sea King HAS2s were modified in 1982 with the addition of the Thorn @-@ EMI ARI <unk> / 3 Searchwater LAST radar attached to the fuselage on a swivel arm and protected by an inflatable dome . This allowed the radar to be lowered below the fuselage during flight and for it to be raised for landing . These prototypes , designated <unk> ( AEW ) , were both flying within 11 weeks and deployed with 824 " D " Flight on HMS Illustrious , serving in the Falklands after the cessation of hostilities . A further eight HAS2s were modified to a production standard , known as the AEW2 . Two remained " fitted for but not with " . These entered operational service in 1985 , being deployed by 849 Naval Air Squadron . Three Sea King HAS5 / 6s were later converted as part of the ASaC Mk7 programme , bringing the Mk7 fleet to 13 ; still 3 below the requirement . 
 The upgrade programme resulted in the Sea King AEW fleet being upgraded with a new mission system , <unk> , <unk> , JTIDS , Active Noise Reduction and <unk> recording . The Mission System Upgrade ( MSU ) component ( Radar and partial JTIDS integration ) was based around the improved Searchwater <unk> radar , with an all @-@ new man Machine Interface . This MSU component was later termed " Project Cerberus " by Thales , after successful integration was conducted by Westland and GEC @-@ Marconi . This variant was initially referred to as the Sea King <unk> , but renamed ASaC7 just before In Service Date . ( Airborne Surveillance and Control <unk> ) . The main role of the Sea King ASaC7 is detection of low @-@ flying attack aircraft ; it also provides interception / attack control and over @-@ the @-@ horizon targeting for surface @-@ launched weapon systems . In comparison to older versions , the new radar enables the ASaC7 to simultaneously track up to 400 targets , instead of an earlier limit of 250 targets . The effectiveness of the <unk> was greatly increased via the addition of a Link 16 data link , allowing gathered radar information to be analysed and rapidly put to use by multiple allied platforms in range . 
 The <unk> will remain in service until they are replaced under the " Crowsnest " programme ; intended as a podded capability onboard Merlins . Previous proposed replacement programmes , Future Organic Airborne Early Warning ( <unk> ) and MASC ( Maritime Airborne Surveillance and Control ) were initiated and then cancelled , due largely to the erroneous assumption that the entire ASaC Mk7 system could simply be lifted and plugged into another aircraft type . However , as a result of the time gap between the planned out of service date of the Sea King in 2016 , and the introduction of " Crowsnest " seven Sea King ASaC.7 helicopters will remain in service with the RN through to the second half of 2018 .

 A number of Sea Kings were deployed during the Falklands War . They were transported to the combat zone and operated from the decks of various ships of the Royal Navy , such as the landing platform dock HMS Fearless . In the theatre , they performed a wide range of missions , from anti @-@ submarine patrols and reconnaissance flights to replenishment operations and the insertion of special forces . Support provided by the Sea Kings in the form of transport for men and supplies has been viewed as vital to the success of the British operation . Sea Kings also protected the fleet by acting as decoys against incoming Exocet missiles , with some missions being flown by Prince Andrew , Duke of York . 
 Anti @-@ Submarine Sea Kings of 820 Naval Air Squadron was embarked on HMS Invincible . With 11 HAS.5s , the squadron operated anti @-@ submarine and search and rescue sorties with one helicopter always airborne on surface search duties . On 14 June , an 820 NAS Sea King HAS.5 was used to transport Major General Jeremy Moore to Port Stanley to accept the surrender of Argentine troops on the island . The squadron flew 1 @,@ 650 sorties during the war . A Flight of 824 Naval Air Squadron embarked two Sea King <unk> aboard RFA <unk> and were used to move supplies to other ships on the way south and later anti @-@ submarine patrols . C Flight had three Sea King <unk> on board RFA Fort Grange which were used for replenishment duties , supplying over 2 @,@ 000 tons of stores . 
 825 Naval Air Squadron was formed for the war with 10 Sea King <unk> modified as utility variants to support ground forces . The anti @-@ submarine equipment was removed and the helicopters fitted with troop seats . Two aircraft embarked on Queen Elizabeth 2 and were later used for moving troops from QE2 to other ships , the remainder embarked on Atlantic Causeway and were used for troop movements around the islands . Embarked on HMS Hermes was 826 Naval Air Squadron with nine HAS.5s , which carried out continuous anti @-@ submarine sorties . From the departure of Hermes from Ascension in April until the Argentine surrender , the squadron operated at least three helicopters airborne continuously for fleet protection . 
 On 23 April 1982 , a Sea King HC4 was ditched while performing a risky transfer of supplies to a ship at night , operating from the flagship HMS Hermes . On 12 May , a Sea King operating from Hermes crashed into the sea due to an altimeter problem ; all crew were rescued . On 19 May 1982 a Sea King , in the process of transporting SAS troops to HMS Intrepid from Hermes , crashed into the sea while attempting to land on Intrepid . Twenty @-@ two men were killed and nine survived . Bird feathers were found in the debris , suggesting a bird strike , although the accident 's cause is inconclusive . The SAS lost 18 men in the crash , their highest number of casualties on one day since the Second World War . The Royal Signals lost one man and the RAF one man . 
 = = = = First Gulf War = = = = 
 During the 1991 Gulf War Sea Kings from several nations , including Canada , Britain , and the U.S. , were present in the coalition forces against Saddam Hussain 's Iraq regime . Due to the threat of potential use of any Iraqi weapons of mass destruction , it was standard practice for Sea King crews to wear fully enclosed NBC ( nuclear , biological , chemical ) protective suits . Britain 's Sea Kings primarily engaged in inter @-@ ship transport duties , including ferrying troops between the fleet and land . Six Sea King Mk4 helicopters from 845 Naval Air Squadron and six of 848 Squadron , which had been reformed to meet this operational demand , worked in support of the ground advance . There was thorough radar coverage by U.S. airborne early warning and control ( AWACS ) aircraft ; British AEW Sea Kings were not deployed . 
 Following the end of hostilities , the available Sea Kings remained on deployment in the region to conduct transport missions to relocate people displaced by the conflict to refugee camps and repatriate citizens to their home countries . 
 = = = = Balkans = = = = 
 The Sea King participated in the UN 's intervention in Bosnia . 845 Naval Air Squadron and their Sea Kings had been dispatched to the region in late 1992 in response to escalating tensions in the region . They performed various logistical and transport missions , such as the repositioning of Royal Artillery <unk> Light Guns in the region and in the evacuation of casualties . In one incident on 24 March 1993 , during an attempt to establish an air evacuation route to a UN @-@ declared safe zone , a flight of French Aérospatiale Pumas and Sea King HC4 helicopters were shelled while taking off from an improvised landing zone . Two further Sea Kings arrived to evacuate several UN casualties , managing to fly the wounded to the Bosnian city of Tuzla , where they came under further enemy fire while unloading . 
 During NATO 's intervention in Kosovo , Sea Kings of 814 Naval Air Squadron , operating from numerous Royal Navy vessels in the Adriatic , including the aircraft carrier HMS Invincible , maintained a patrol of the Balkans ' coast . The Sea Kings were also heavily used in the transport role during the preparations for a ground invasion of Kosovo . 
 = = = = 2000s = = = = 
 In 2000 , Sea King <unk> of 846 NAS participated in Operation Palliser in Sierra Leone . 
 During the 2003 invasion of Iraq , multiple Sea King ASaC7 from 849 NAS were operated from HMS Ark Royal . On 22 March 2003 , two AEW Sea Kings from 849 NAS operating from Ark Royal collided over the Persian Gulf , resulting in the death of seven personnel . A report into the collision called for Sea Kings to be outfitted with night vision goggles , as well as better onboard safety equipment , and recommended changes to procedure regarding the use of radar at night . 
 In July 2006 , Sea King HC.4 helicopters based at RNAS Yeovilton were temporarily deployed to Cyprus to assist in Operation <unk> , the evacuation of British citizens from Lebanon . 
 In October 2011 , following several years of service in Afghanistan as troop transports for the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) forces stationed there , the Sea King <unk> returned to the UK ; their replacement is the AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin . Between April 2009 and July 2011 , the Royal Navy 's Sea Kings stationed at Camp Bastion conducted over 1000 operational missions . The initial Afghan deployment had been criticised as the Sea Kings had not been fitted with protective Kevlar armour . 
 = = = Australia = = = 
 In 1974 , Australia purchased 12 Westland Sea King Mk 50s as the Royal Australian Navy 's new ASW helicopter ; the Sea Kings replaced the aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne 's complement of Westland Wessex <unk> in the following year . Early operations were troubled by a series of accidents . Between October 1975 to May 1979 , four aircraft were lost in accidents , the primary causes were the loss of oil from the main gearbox . 
 The Australian Sea Kings had similar avionics to that of the Sea King HAS.1 , with the same ARI <unk> search radar in a dorsal radome , but had American Bendix AN / ASQ @-@ 13A dipping sonar instead of the Plessey sonar of the Royal Navy Sea Kings . They also had more powerful engines giving improved high temperature hover performance . Australia 's Sea Kings were flown by 817 Squadron RAN from HMAS Melbourne until the carrier was retired from service , without replacement . As the Sea King was too large to operate from the Adelaide @-@ class frigates , 817 Squadron was then forced to operate from land bases , in both ASW and utility roles , with the Sea King relinquishing the anti @-@ submarine mission in 1990 . 
 During the 2003 Iraq War , Sea Kings were heavily used in logistical roles , such as the first delivery of humanitarian aid to the Iraqi capital , Baghdad . In the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami , Australian Sea Kings played a major role in disaster relief efforts in Indonesia 's Aceh province , delivering medical teams and supplies from Royal Australian Navy ships . Prior to retirement , the last major missions were flown during the 2010 – 2011 Queensland floods , in which Sea Kings provided SAR coverage of the region and delivered aid relief to citizens in the flooded areas . 
 The replacement of the Fleet Air Arm 's Sea King fleet commenced faster than initially planned following the loss of a Sea King during a humanitarian aid mission in Indonesia in April 2005 , resulting in nine deaths . Investigators uncovered serious faults in the condition of the Sea King 's mechanical flight control system , resulting from maintenance deficiencies . In May 2007 , the six remaining Sea Kings were grounded for two months following the discovery of a number of missing parts . 
 On 1 September 2011 , the Australian Minister for Defence Materiel , Jason Clare , announced that the Sea Kings would be withdrawn from service in December 2011 ; having flown in excess of 60 @,@ 000 hours in operations in Australia and overseas in that time . The farewell flight was conducted on 15 December 2011 , three Sea Kings flew over Sydney Harbour and across to Canberra , passing Lake Burley Griffin and the Australian War Memorial before landing at Nowra . On 16 December 2011 , the Chief of Navy presided over the ceremonial decommissioning of 817 Squadron RAN at NAS Nowra . Five of the withdrawn helicopters have been made available for sale . The replacement for the Sea King is the MRH 90 . 
 = = = India = = = 
 Following the Indo @-@ Pakistani War of 1965 , Pakistan invested heavily in modern submarines and long @-@ range torpedoes . In response , India opted to procure six Westland Sea Kings from Britain in 1969 , for ASW duties , designated as <unk> . The purchase also included the provision of air @-@ <unk> homing torpedoes for use against submarines . The delivery of the aircraft began a few months before the Indo @-@ Pakistani War of 1971 . Due to training shortfalls on the new helicopters , Sea King operations were considerably restricted during the 1971 war ; by November 1971 , increased aircrew experience had enabled offensive anti @-@ submarine operations to be conducted . The Majestic class aircraft carrier INS Vikrant was also refitted in 1972 – 1974 to enable extensive Sea King operations , becoming the carrier 's primary anti @-@ submarine aircraft . 
 During the early 1960s , India and Britain agreed upon the domestic production of the Leander @-@ class frigate . The initial helicopter deployed aboard India 's Leanders , known as the Nilgiri @-@ class , was the Aérospatiale Alouette III , however , this offered much less capability in the anti @-@ submarine role compared with the Sea King and the need for design changes was realised to allow the Sea King to be deployed upon the flight deck of the Nilgiri @-@ class , a practice pioneered by the Royal Canadian Navy using their Sikorsky CH @-@ 124 Sea Kings on similar @-@ sized frigates . It proved unfeasible to operate the Sea King from the unmodified Nilgiri @-@ class , with the last two ships of the class being fitted with an enlarged flight deck and hangar . This required removal of the ship 's Limbo anti @-@ submarine mortar . Beyond the original 1971 procurement , India chose to acquire a further six <unk> in 1974 , and three more in 1980 ; these three had been specifically modified to operate from the flight deck of the last two Nilgiris and designated as <unk> . As a follow @-@ on to the Nilgiris , India commenced development of a new frigate , based on the Leander / Nilgiri , but larger . The resultant Godavari @-@ class , also known as Project 16 , could operate two Sea Kings simultaneously . 
 In 1982 , India signed a contract to purchase several Mk42B Sea Kings , an upgraded variant to perform dual @-@ purpose : anti @-@ shipping and anti @-@ submarine missions , following a competition for the order against the Aérospatiale Super Puma . These helicopters would operate from the Godavari @-@ class frigates as well as replace the existing Sea Kings . A team of Indian engineers was sent to Britain to help develop the Mk42B 's avionics , especially the onboard software . Changes from the older Sea Kings included a brand new avionics suite , the use of composite materials throughout the fuselage and in the rotor blades , as well as the integration of the Sea Eagle missile , which had been procured from Britain in 1983 . Between 1988 and 1992 , a total of 20 Mk42B Sea Kings were delivered to the Indian Navy . 
 Six Sea Kings in troop @-@ carrying capacity , designated <unk> , were also procured in 1987 . Although the Indian Navy considered the AEW Sea King , expected to be designated as <unk> , it was judged to be too expensive , consequently , in 2003 , the Russian Kamov Ka @-@ 31 was procured instead . The indigenous HAL Dhruv was the intended replacement for the Sea King in the ASW role , however , in 2000 , it was deemed unsuited , as the Indian Navy were dissatisfied with the design 's folding blade mechanism and by the Dhruv 's maintenance record . 
 In May 1998 , the United States enacted sanctions upon India as a part of the international response to a series of nuclear weapons tests by India . As of 1999 , these sanctions effectively grounded India 's Sea Kings because India could not purchase any US @-@ supplied spare parts for the fleet . Westland also complied with the sanctions by refusing to maintain any US @-@ made components . A limited number of Sea Kings were kept operational by <unk> other aircraft and the manufacture of some components by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited ( HAL ) . In December 2000 , President Bill Clinton permitted a relaxation of the sanctions . In the late 2000s , HAL and AgustaWestland signed an agreement to jointly maintain and perform upgrades to India 's fleet of Sea Kings . 
 = = = Norway = = = 
 The Norwegian Ministry of Justice owns 12 <unk> Sea Kings which are operated by the Royal Norwegian Air Forces 's 330 Squadron . The aircraft are used for SAR and air ambulance missions and are under the command of the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Southern Norway and Northern Norway . Introduced in May 1973 , they were originally stationed at Bodø Main Air Station , Ørland Main Air Station , Sola Air Station and Station Group Banak . In 1997 , the squadron conducted 237 SAR and 747 air ambulance missions . From 1995 to 1998 , one helicopter was stationed at Ålesund Airport , Vigra , and since 1999 , one has been stationed at Rygge Air Station . Florø Airport became a station for one helicopter from 2009 . 
 The helicopters are to be replaced by AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin under the Norwegian All @-@ Weather Search and Rescue Helicopter ( NAWSARH ) programme . The candidates for the NAWSARH contract of 10 – 12 helicopters was the AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin , NHIndustries NH @-@ 90 , Eurocopter EC225 and Sikorsky S @-@ 92 . July 2013 , AgustaWestland ( AW101 Merlin ) and Eurocopter ( EC225 ) was short @-@ listed to conduct further discussions for the NAWSARH programme for up to 16 helicopters . 
 = = = Germany = = = 
 The German Navy placed an order for 22 Sea King <unk> on 20 June 1969 as a replacement for the Grumman Albatross flying boat in the Search and Rescue Role . This was the first export sale for the Westland Sea King , and was the first dedicated Search and Rescue Sea King variant , with an enlarged cabin and more fuel . The German Sea Kings had similar radar and navigation equipment to the HAS.1 , but was not fitted with sonar . The 22 Sea Kings were delivered between April 1973 and September 1974 , equipping <unk> 5 ( MFG 5 ) ( Naval Air Wing 5 ) . An additional Sea King was delivered in April 1975 to replace one destroyed in a gale . The surviving Sea Kings were upgraded between 1986 and 1988 , adding the capability to carry Sea Skua anti @-@ ship missiles , which required the addition of a Ferranti <unk> radar in a nose radome . 
 The 21 remaining Sea Kings are tasked to a variety of roles including SAR , transport , disaster relief , tactical land – sea transport , evacuation , surveillance , reconnaissance and naval support . The main base is Nordholz , although units are always stationed at Heligoland Airport and Warnemünde , and sometimes at Borkum Airfield . The helicopters are scheduled to be replaced by the NH @-@ 90 . 
 = = = Others = = = 
 Egypt is a prolific operator of the Sea King , using many different variants for a wide variety of purposes . In addition to operating ASW Sea Kings for coastal patrols , Egypt procured a land @-@ based transport adapted from the basic Sea King , marketed by Westland as the Commando , including a VIP <unk> . An electronic warfare version was also deployed by the Egyptian Air Force , featuring sophisticated onboard jamming systems . As of 2011 , 23 Sea Kings / Commandos remain in service with Egypt . 
 The Qatar Emiri Air Force also operates Westland 's Commando variant , as a standard utility transport for ground forces , a single one was also equipped specially to perform VIP transport duties . A few Qatari Sea Kings serve in an anti @-@ shipping capacity and have been outfitted to carry , and deploy if required , two Exocet anti @-@ ship missiles . 
 Pakistan 's Navy took delivery of six <unk> Sea Kings , a variant based on the Royal Navy 's Sea King HAS.1 from 1975 . It served in an combined anti @-@ submarine and anti @-@ ship role , carrying the Exocet missile as an alternative to the normal anti @-@ submarine weapon load of four Mark 44 or Mark 46 torpedoes . One of Pakistan 's Sea Kings was lost in an accident in February 1986 , and was replaced by an ex @-@ Royal Navy HAS.5 , redesignated <unk> , in January 1989 . Pakistan 's Sea Kings remained in service in December 2011 . 
 The Belgian Air Force purchased five Sea Kings to perform Search and rescue missions , they were introduced to service in 1976 . As of 2013 , they are gradually being replaced by the NH90 .

 = Operation Lüttich = 
 Operation Lüttich was a codename given to a German counter @-@ attack during the Battle of Normandy , which took place around the American positions near Mortain from 7 August to 13 August 1944 . ( Lüttich is the German name for the city of Liège in Belgium , where the Germans had won a victory in the early days of August 1914 during World War I. ) The offensive is also referred to in American and British histories of the Battle of Normandy as the Mortain counter @-@ offensive . 
 The assault was ordered by Adolf Hitler , to eliminate the gains made by the First United States Army during Operation Cobra and the subsequent weeks , and by reaching the coast in the region of Avranches at the base of the Cotentin peninsula , cut off the units of the Third United States Army which had advanced into Brittany . 
 The main German striking force was the XLVII Panzer Corps , with one and a half SS Panzer Divisions and two Wehrmacht Panzer Divisions . Although they made initial gains against the defending U.S. VII Corps , they were soon halted and Allied aircraft inflicted severe losses on the attacking troops , eventually destroying nearly half of the German tanks involved in the attack . Although fighting continued around Mortain for six days , the American forces had regained the initiative within a day of the opening of the German attack . 
 As the German commanders on the spot had warned Hitler in vain , there was little chance of the attack succeeding , and the concentration of their armoured reserves at the western end of the front in Normandy soon led to disaster , as they were outflanked to their south and the front to their east collapsed , resulting in many of the German troops in Normandy being trapped in the Falaise Pocket . 
 = = Background = = 
 On 25 July 1944 , following six weeks of attritional warfare along a stalemated front , American forces under Lieutenant General Omar Bradley mounted an attack code @-@ named Operation Cobra , which broke through the German defenses near Saint @-@ Lô . Almost the entire western half of the German front in Normandy collapsed , and on 1 August , American forces captured Avranches . With the capture of this town at the base of the Cotentin peninsula , and an intact bridge at Pontaubault nearby , the American forces had " turned the corner " ; the German front could no longer be anchored against the sea at its western end and American forces could advance west and south into Brittany . The U.S. Third Army , commanded by Lieutenant General George S. Patton , was activated the same day . Despite German air attacks against the bridge at Pontaubault , Patton pushed no less than seven divisions across it during the next three days , and units of his army began advancing almost unopposed towards the Brittany ports . 
 Beginning on 30 July , the British Second Army , under Lieutenant @-@ General Miles C. Dempsey , mounted a supporting attack ( code @-@ named Operation Bluecoat ) on the eastern flank of the American armies . Much of the German armored reserves being rushed west to halt the American breakthrough were diverted to face this new threat . Meanwhile , the U.S. continued its attacks to widen the corridor around Avranches . Although the Germans held the vital road junction of Vire , U.S. VII Corps , under Major General J. Lawton Collins , captured Mortain , 19 miles ( 31 km ) east of Avranches , on 3 August . 
 The next day , although U.S. VIII Corps continued to advance west through Brittany toward the ports of Brest and Lorient , Bradley ordered Patton to drive eastward with the main body of the U.S. Third Army , around the open German flank and into the German rear areas . U.S. XV Corps advanced no less than 75 mi ( 121 km ) during the next three days , and by 7 August they were approaching Le Mans , formerly the location of the headquarters of the German 7th Army , and still an important logistic center . 
 = = German command and decisions = = 
 Generalfeldmarshall Günther von Kluge was the German supreme commander in the West . After Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel was injured by Allied aircraft on 17 July , Kluge also took over direct command of Army Group B , the formation conducting the battle in Normandy . He had warned Hitler on 22 July that the collapse of the front was imminent , but Hitler continued to order him to stand fast . 
 On 2 August , Hitler sent a directive to Kluge ordering " an immediate counter @-@ attack between Mortain and Avranches " . General Walter Warlimont — the Deputy Chief of Staff at OKW , the German armed forces headquarters — was also sent to Kluge 's headquarters to ensure these orders were complied with . Kluge suggested that there was no chance of success , and the German forces in Normandy should retire to the Seine River , pivoting on the intact defences south of Caen , but on 4 August , Hitler categorically ordered the attack to be launched . He demanded that eight of the nine Panzer Divisions in Normandy be used in the attack , and that the Luftwaffe commit its entire reserve , including 1 @,@ 000 fighters . According to Hitler , three qualifications had to be met for the attack to proceed . " Von Kluge must believe in it . He must be able to detach enough armour from the main front in Normandy to create an effective striking force , and he must achieve surprise " . 
 Although ordered to wait " until every tank , gun and plane was assembled " , Kluge and SS General Paul Hausser ( commanding the German 7th Army , which held the western part of the front ) decided to attack as soon as possible , before the overall situation deteriorated further . The main striking force assigned was the XLVII Panzer Corps , commanded by General Hans Freiherr von Funck . Instead of eight Panzer Divisions , only four — one of them incomplete — could be relieved from their defensive tasks and assembled in time ; the 2nd Panzer Division , 116th Panzer Division , the 2nd SS Panzer Division and part of the 1st SS Panzer Division , with a total of about 300 tanks . The Panzer Corps was supported by two Infantry Divisions and five Kampfgruppen , formed from the remnants of the Panzer Lehr Division and four equally battered infantry divisions . 
 Kluge ordered the attack to be mounted on the night of 6 / 7 August . To avoid alerting American forces to the attack , there would be no preparatory artillery bombardments . The intention was to hit the U.S. 30th Infantry Division , commanded by Major @-@ General Leland Hobbs , east of Mortain , then cut through American defenses to reach the coast . Had surprise been achieved , the attack might well have succeeded , but Allied decoders at Ultra had intercepted and decrypted the orders for Operation Lüttich by August 4 . As a result , Bradley was able to obtain air support from both the US 9th Air Force and the RAF . 
 = = German attacks = = 
 At 22 : 00 on 6 August , Funck reported that his troops were still not concentrated , and the commander of the 116th Panzer Division " had made a mess of things " . In fact , this officer ( Gerhard von Schwerin ) had been so pessimistic about the operation that he had not even ordered his tank units to take part . This delay disjointed the German attack , but on the German left flank , the SS Panzer troops attacked the positions of the American 30th Infantry Division east of Mortain shortly after midnight . The Germans achieved temporary surprise , as the Ultra documents had arrived at U.S. First Army Headquarters too late to alert the troops to the immediate assault . They briefly captured Mortain but were unable to breach the lines of the 30th Division , as the 2nd Battalion of the 120th Infantry Regiment commanded Hill 314 , the dominant feature around Mortain . Although cut off , they were supplied by parachute drops . Of the 700 men who defended the position until 12 August , over 300 were killed . 
 To the north , the 2nd Panzer Division attacked several hours later , aiming south @-@ west toward Avranches . It managed to penetrate several miles into the American lines , before being stopped by the 35th Infantry Division and a combat command of the 3rd Armored Division only 2 mi ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) short of Avranches . The German High Command ordered the attacks to be renewed before the afternoon , so that Avranches could be taken . 
 = = = Allied air strikes — the offensive stalls = = = 
 By noon of 7 August , the early morning fog had dispersed , and large numbers of Allied aircraft appeared over the battlefield . With the advance knowledge of the attack provided by Ultra , the U.S. 9th Air Force had been reinforced by the RAF Second Tactical Air Force . Despite assurances by the Luftwaffe that German forces would have adequate air support , the Allied aircraft quickly achieved complete control of the airspace over Mortain . The Luftwaffe reported that its fighters were engaged by Allied aircraft from the moment they took off , and were unable even to reach the battlefield . In the open ground east of Mortain , the German Panzers became exposed targets , especially for rocket @-@ firing Hawker Typhoon fighter bombers of the RAF . 
 Traditional accounts of the Allied fighter bomber attacks in the Battle of Mortain accepted the claims of the pilots of over two hundred destroyed German tanks . However , subsequent detailed studies of the battlefield showed that most of the destroyed German armor were knocked out by gunfire from ground forces and that the main effect of the Allied air attacks had been to destroy the unarmored vehicles and troops in the German offensive , as well as forcing the German armor to disperse to cover . The accuracy of the rockets and bombs of the Allied fighter @-@ bombers was simply too poor to destroy more than a few of the German tanks , although fear of being incinerated inside a tank should a rocket or bomb actually strike a tank did cause some of the inexperienced German tank crews to abandon their tanks intact while under air attack . In one British study , it was found that the average Typhoon pilot firing a barrage of all eight rockets had only a four percent chance of striking a target the size of a tank . 
 = = American counter @-@ moves = = 
 Through 7 August , American troops had continued to press south near Vire , on the right flank of the German attack . The 116th Panzer Division — which was supposed to advance in this sector — was actually driven back . In the afternoon , the 1st SS and 116th Panzer Divisions made renewed attacks , but the flanks of the Mortain positions had been sealed off , allowing the American VII Corps to contain the German advance . 
 Meanwhile , Bradley had sent two armoured combat commands against the German southern ( left ) flank . On 8 August , one of these ( from the U.S. 2nd Armored Division ) was attacking the rear of the two SS Panzer Divisions . Although fighting would continue around Mortain for several more days , there was no further prospect of any German success . The Germans issued orders to go on to the defensive along the entire front , but poorly communicated orders resulted in this being impossible to achieve , with some German forces retreating , and others preparing to hold their ground . 
 As the U.S. First Army counter @-@ attacked German units near Mortain , units of Patton 's 3rd Army were advancing unchecked through the open country to the south of the German armies , and had taken Le Mans on 8 August . The same day , the 1st Canadian Army attacked the weakened German positions south of Caen in Operation Totalize and threatened to break through to Falaise , although this attack stalled after two days . In desperation , Hitler ordered the attacks against Mortain to be renewed with greater intensity , demanding that the 9th Panzer Division , almost the only formation opposing Patton 's advance east from Le Mans , be transferred to Mortain to take part in the attack . General Heinrich Eberbach — commander of Panzergruppe West — was ordered to form a new headquarters , named " Panzer Group Eberbach " , to command the renewed offensive . Kluge — who feared he was about to be implicated by the Gestapo in the July 20 Plot — acquiesced in this apparently suicidal order . Eberbach 's proposed counter @-@ attack was soon overtaken by events , and was never mounted . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 By 13 August , the offensive had fully halted , with German forces being driven out of Mortain . The Panzer Divisions involved lost half of their 150 tanks to Allied counter @-@ attacks and air strikes . As Hitler ordered German forces in Normandy to hold their positions , the U.S. VII and XV Corps were swinging east and north toward Argentan . The German attack west left the 7th Army and Panzergruppe West in danger of being encircled by Allied forces . As American forces advanced on Argentan , British and Canadian forces advanced on Falaise , threatening to cut off both armies in the newly formed Falaise Pocket . 
 Although American casualties in Operation Lüttich were significantly lighter than in previous operations , certain sectors of the front , notably the positions held by the 30th Division around Mortain , took severe casualties . By the end of 7 August alone , nearly 1 @,@ 000 men of the 30th Division had been killed . Estimates for American casualties from 6 – 13 August vary from 2 @,@ 000 @-@ 3 @,@ 000 fatalities , with an unknown number of wounded . 
 On 14 August , Canadian forces launched Operation Tractable , in conjunction with American movements northwards to Chambois . On 19 August , a brigade of the Polish 1st Armoured Division linked up with forces of the 90th U.S. Infantry Division , sealing off some 50 @,@ 000 German troops in the pocket . By 21 August , German attempts to reopen the gap had been thwarted , and all German troops trapped in the pocket surrendered to Allied forces , effectively putting an end to the German 7th Army .

 The 43rd Boat Race took place on 3 April 1886 . The Boat Race is an annual side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . Repairs to Hammersmith Bridge restricted the crews to pass through a single arch . Umpired by Robert Lewis @-@ Lloyd , Cambridge won the race by two @-@ thirds of a length in a time of 22 minutes 30 seconds , becoming the first crew to come from behind at Barnes Bridge to win . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . First held in 1829 , the race takes place on the 4 @.@ 2 miles ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities ; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and as of 2014 , broadcast worldwide . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions having won the previous year 's race by two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths and held the overall lead , with 23 victories to Cambridge 's 18 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . 
 Oxford 's coach was F. P. Bully . Cambridge were coached by Thomas Edmund Hockin ( who rowed for the Light Blues four times in the 1876 , 1877 , 1878 and 1879 races ) , Charles William Moore ( who represented Cambridge in the 1881 , 1882 , 1883 and 1884 races ) , and Herbert Edward Rhodes ( who rowed in the 1873 , 1874 , 1875 and 1876 races ) . 
 The umpire for the race was Robert Lewis @-@ Lloyd ( who had rowed for Cambridge four times between 1856 and 1859 ) . Hammersmith Bridge was undergoing repair and during practice , the crews struggled to negotiate side @-@ by @-@ side rowing through the same arch without fouling . It was agreed that should such a foul occur during the race , a restart above the bridge would take place , with a new finishing line near Kew . Two sets of oars were taken on the umpire 's launch should such an eventuality arise and a clash result in irreparable damage .

 The Oxford crew weighed an average of 12 st 3 @.@ 75 lb ( 77 @.@ 7 kg ) , 4 pounds ( 1 @.@ 8 kg ) more than their opponents . Cambridge 's crew contained three former Blues , including their boat club president Frederick Islay Pitman and Steve Fairbairn , both of whom were rowing in their third Boat Race . Oxford saw six rowers return to the crew , including the boat club president Douglas McLean who was making his fourth appearance in the event , and rowing with his brother Hector for the second consecutive year . There were two non @-@ British registered participants in the race : Australians Fairbairn ( for Cambridge ) and W. St L. Robertson ( for Oxford ) .

 Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station , handing the Middlesex station to Cambridge . Commencing at <unk> , the Light Blues made the better start and by the time the crews passed Craven Cottage , they held just less than a half @-@ length lead . Oxford began to close the gap , and by the soap works , the boats were level . On the approach to Hammersmith Bridge , the coxes " steered with such accuracy and nerve as they had never shown in practice " and both crews were able to shoot the bridge safely , with only a " few inches to spare " . Rowing into rough water , Oxford started to pull away and between Chiswick and Barnes Bridge , the lead increased to more than two lengths . At the bridge , Cambridge made a push and increased their rating to 40 strokes per minute , sustaining the drive for three minutes and overtaking Oxford , passing the finishing post by a margin of two @-@ thirds of a length . The winning time was 22 minutes 30 seconds and the win was Cambridge 's second victory in three years , taking the overall record to 23 – 19 in Oxford 's favour . 
 It was the first time the winning crew had come from behind at Barnes Bridge to win . According to author and former Oxford rower George Drinkwater , " never in the whole history of the <unk> ( sic ) has there been a contest more thrilling to watch or more sensational in its result . " 
 = Joe Kelley = 
 Joseph James Kelley ( December 9 , 1871 – August 14 , 1943 ) was an American left fielder in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) who starred in the outfield of the Baltimore Orioles teams of the 1890s . Making up the nucleus of the Orioles along with John McGraw , Willie Keeler , and Hughie Jennings , Kelley received the nickname " Kingpin of the Orioles " . 
 In his MLB career , Kelley played in the National League ( NL ) for the Boston Beaneaters ( 1891 ) , Pittsburgh Pirates ( 1892 ) , Baltimore Orioles ( 1892 – 1898 ) , and Brooklyn Superbas ( 1899 – 1901 ) , before he jumped to the upstart American League to play for the Baltimore Orioles ( 1902 ) . He returned to the NL with Cincinnati Reds ( 1902 – 1906 ) and Boston Doves ( 1908 ) . Kelley served as player @-@ manager of the Reds ( 1902 – 1905 ) and Doves ( 1908 ) . After extending his career in the minor leagues , he coached the Brooklyn Robins ( 1926 ) , and scouted for the New York Yankees ( 1915 – 1916 ) . 
 Kelley was regarded as an excellent batter , a good base runner , and a great leader . Over his seventeen season MLB career , Kelley had a .317 batting average , and batted over .300 in eleven consecutive seasons . Kelley stole a career @-@ high 87 bases in the 1896 season , which led MLB . He finished in the league 's top ten in categories such as batting average , home runs , runs batted in ( RBI ) , and stolen bases numerous times . He served as team captain of the Orioles and the Superbas . In recognition of his career achievements , Kelley was elected a member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1971 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Kelley was born to Patrick Kelly and Ann Kelly ( née Carney ) in Cambridge , Massachusetts on December 9 , 1871 . Kelley 's parents emigrated to the United States from Ireland , and he had five siblings . According to the 1880 United States Census , Patrick worked as a marble cutter . 
 As a child , Kelley was educated at a parochial grammar school and St. Thomas Aquinas College in Cambridge , where he starred for the school 's baseball team as a pitcher . He worked for a local piano manufacturer and the John P. Lowell Arms Company . He practiced with the Harvard Crimson , the college baseball team of Harvard University , and played semi @-@ professional baseball for the Lowell Arms Company .

 Kelley made his professional debut with the Lowell Indians of the New England League ( <unk> ) in 1891 , at age 19 . During games he did not pitch , Lowell 's manager put him in the lineup as an infielder . Kelley had a 10 – 3 win – loss record and a <unk> @-@ leading .323 batting average with Lowell . 
 Lowell folded in July . Three days later , Kelley signed with the Boston Beaneaters of the National League ( NL ) . Kelley made his major league debut in August 1891 with the Beaneaters . After batting .244 in twelve games played , the Beaneaters released Kelley after the season . Kelley began the 1892 season with the Omaha <unk> of the Class – A Western League , turning down a $ 1 @,@ 200 salary ( $ 31 @,@ 604 in current dollar terms ) from the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League . With Omaha , Kelley batted .316 with 19 stolen bases in 58 games .

 The Pittsburgh Pirates of the NL purchased Kelley 's contract from Omaha for $ 500 ( $ 13 @,@ 169 in current dollar terms ) on July 2 , 1892 . Ned Hanlon , new manager of the Baltimore Orioles , traded George Van Haltren to the Pirates for Kelley and $ 2 @,@ 000 ( $ 52 @,@ 674 in current dollar terms ) in September 1892 . Hanlon had succeeded Van Haltren as Orioles ' manager during the season ; remaining with the Orioles as a player , Van Haltren openly criticized Hanlon . Hanlon mentioned that he " had [ his ] eye on Kelley for a long time . " 
 Hanlon taught Kelley how to play center field . During the 1893 season , Kelley batted .305 , with 120 runs scored , and stole 33 bases . He finished ninth in the NL with a .476 slugging percentage ( SLG ) , and tied Eddie Burke for ninth in home runs with 9 . The Orioles won the NL pennant in 1894 , 1895 , and 1896 . Kelley moved to left field in 1894 with the acquisition of Steve Brodie , who played center . That year , he batted .393 with 111 runs batted in ( RBI ) , 199 hits , and 165 runs scored , tying teammate Willie Keeler for second in runs and finishing sixth in batting average and eighth in hits . Combined with 107 walks , which were tied for second most in the NL with Cupid Childs and behind only Billy Hamilton , Kelley posted a .502 on @-@ base percentage ( OBP ) , finishing second in the NL to Hamilton , and hit 48 doubles , good for second in the NL , behind only Hugh Duffy . His <unk> SLG was the fourth best in the NL . 
 These Orioles teams , led by John McGraw , were known to break the rules in order to win , including tampering with their bats and the playing field . Kelley hid baseballs in the outfield , using the closest hidden ball instead of finding the ball batted into the outfield . Kelley hit ten home runs in 1895 , a then @-@ franchise record , tying him for fifth in the NL with five other players . He also tied Brodie for second with 134 RBI , finished fourth with 54 stolen bases , fifth with a <unk> SLG , and sixth with a .456 OBP . In 1896 , Kelley finished seventh in the NL in batting average ( .364 ) , fourth in runs scored ( 148 ) , fourth in SLG ( <unk> ) , fifth in OBP ( .469 ) , ninth in hits ( 189 ) , and tied Gene DeMontreville for eighth in home runs ( 8 ) . 
 In 1897 , Kelley agreed to serve as the coach of the Georgetown Hoyas , the college baseball team of Georgetown University . That year , he finished fifth in the NL in batting average ( .362 ) and RBI ( 118 ) , seventh in OBP ( .447 ) , and eighth in SLG ( .489 ) . 
 By 1898 , Kelley earned an annual salary of $ 2 @,@ 500 ( $ 71 @,@ 110 in current dollar terms ) , plus a $ 200 ( $ 5 @,@ 689 in current dollar terms ) bonus for serving as team captain . He finished third in the league with 110 RBI and ninth with a .438 SLG . Due to insolvency , the Brooklyn Superbas purchased the Orioles after the 1898 season and transferred Kelley , Hanlon , Keeler , Joe McGinnity , and Hughie Jennings to Brooklyn . Wanting an opportunity to manage , and to remain near Baltimore , Kelley requested a transfer to the Washington Senators , but Washington did not have enough talent to send to Brooklyn to make a trade . 
 = = = Brooklyn Superbas and AL 's Baltimore Orioles ( 1899 – 1902 ) = = = 
 With McGraw remaining in Baltimore , Hanlon named Kelley team captain . The Superbas won the NL pennant in 1899 and 1900 , as Kelley finished tenth in RBI ( 93 ) , OBP ( <unk> ) , and tied several players for tenth in home runs ( 6 ) in 1899 and led the team with a .319 batting average in 1900 , while finishing fourth in the league in SLG ( .485 ) , tying Hickman for seventh in RBI ( 91 ) , and tying Jimmy Collins and Buck Freeman for tenth in home runs ( 6 ) . 
 Kelley moved back to the infield , becoming the regular first baseman in 1901 . After the 1901 season , Kelley denied reports that he would jump from the Superbas to the Detroit Tigers of the American League ( AL ) , the former Western League which had decided to compete with the NL by creating franchises in east coast cities that housed NL franchises . However , the opportunity to return to Baltimore proved irresistible to Kelley , and after the AL 's successful 1901 season , he jumped from the Superbas to the Baltimore Orioles AL . Kelley 's father @-@ in @-@ law , John Mahon , was president and principal share holder of the AL 's Orioles . 
 Kelley was named Orioles ' captain and received some stock in the team . McGraw , player @-@ manager of the Orioles , resigned from the team to take over as manager of the New York Giants on July 7 , 1902 . In his absence , Kelley and Wilbert Robinson took over in the interim . Under indefinite suspension by Ban Johnson by July 1902 for fighting with umpires , Kelley entertained the idea of leaving the Orioles with McGraw , who was becoming frustrated with Johnson , and had begun negotiating to join the New York Giants of the NL . With the team in financial straits , Kelley sold his shares of the Orioles to Mahon , who had purchased McGraw 's shares when he left for New York , becoming principal shareholder of the Orioles . Mahon then sold controlling interest in the Orioles to Andrew Freedman , principal owner of the Giants , and John T. Brush , principal owner of the Cincinnati Reds , on July 17 . On the day they owned the franchise , they released the best players on the Orioles from their contracts so that they could be signed by National League teams : Kelley and Cy Seymour signed with the Reds , while McGinnity , Roger Bresnahan , Dan McGann , and Jack Cronin signed with the Giants . Johnson , along with Orioles minority owners , took control of the Orioles franchise , which had to forfeit their game that day as they did not have enough players . Kelley stated that the Orioles owed $ 12 @,@ 000 ( $ 328 @,@ 200 in current dollar terms ) , and that selling his shares was the only way Mahon could pay the team 's debts . 
 = = = Cincinnati Reds , Toronto Maple Leafs , and Boston Doves ( 1902 – 1908 ) = = = 
 The Superbas lodged a complaint against the Reds , claiming that Kelley was still under their control , seeking compensation from the Reds . However , the other NL owners saw the situation as a coup for their league , and compelled Hanlon to drop his complaint . Kelley did not immediately report to Cincinnati , instead traveling to Boston to attempt to convince members of the Boston Americans to join him in the NL . Kelley joined the Reds on July 31 . 
 With rumors that Kelley was negotiating to become the Reds ' manager , incumbent manager Bid McPhee resigned , and Kelley succeeded him . Kelley served as manager of the Reds from 1902 until 1905 . In 1903 , Kelley finished ninth in the NL in OBP ( .402 ) . He was dismissed as manager after the 1905 season , and replaced by Hanlon . He remained as a Reds player for the 1906 season . He batted .228 during the 1906 season , and the Reds released him . 
 Kelley signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the Class – AA International League ( IL ) in 1907 , receiving a $ 5 @,@ 000 salary ( $ 126 @,@ 982 in current dollar terms ) , the highest for a minor league player to date . Kelley batted .322 for the Maple Leafs as a part @-@ time player , spending time in left field and first base . The Maple Leafs won the IL pennant that season . 
 With Fred Tenney set to leave the Boston Doves of the NL for the Giants , the Doves claimed Kelley from the Maple Leafs , signing Kelley to a two @-@ year contract with an annual salary of $ 5 @,@ 500 ( $ 144 @,@ 854 in current dollar terms ) . Kelley announced that he would play left field . Kelley feuded with Doves ' owner George Dovey , as Dovey wanted George Browne fined for " indifferent play " , which Kelley refused to do . Dovey fired Kelley in December 1908 . Kelley threatened legal action against Dovey , stating in the press that Dovey was releasing him to cut salary . Kelley and Dovey settled their case , freeing Kelley from the second year of his Doves contract .

 Maple Leafs president James <unk> secured Kelley 's return to the club in 1909 . He played with the Maple Leafs through 1910 , managing the Maple Leafs from 1912 to 1914 , winning a second pennant in 1912 . 
 After the 1914 season , the Maple Leafs released Kelley . The New York Yankees considered hiring Kelley as their manager after the 1914 season . Kelley scouted for the Yankees in 1915 and 1916 . Former teammate Wilbert Robinson , then manager of the Brooklyn Robins , hired Kelley and McGinnity to join his coaching staff for the 1926 MLB season . Kelley and McGinnity were not retained after the season .

Kelley tied Fred Carroll 's MLB record with nine hits in a doubleheader , which he presently shares with eight other players . 
 Additionally , he was known as a great leader . He compiled a 338 – 321 win – loss record as a MLB manager . 
 Kelley was considered by the Veterans Committee for induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1964 , but was not selected . He was voted into the Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1971 .

 = Marsileaceae = 
 The Marsileaceae / <unk> / are a small family of heterosporous aquatic and semi @-@ aquatic ferns , though at first sight they do not physically resemble other ferns . The group is commonly known as the " <unk> family " or as the " water @-@ clover family " because the leaves of the genus Marsilea superficially resemble the leaves of a four @-@ leaf clover ( a flowering plant ) . Leaves of this fern have sometimes been used to substitute for clover leaves on Saint Patrick 's Day . In all , the family contains 3 genera and 50 to 80 species with most of those belonging to Marsilea . 
 = = Natural history = = 
 Members of the Marsileaceae are aquatic or semi @-@ aquatic . Plants often grow in dense clumps in mud along the shores of ponds or streams , or they may grow submerged in shallow water with some of the leaves extending to float on the water surface . They grow in seasonally wet habitats , but survive the winter or dry season by losing their leaves and producing hard , desiccation @-@ resistant reproductive structures . 
 There are only three living genera in the family Marsileaceae . The majority of species ( about 45 to 70 ) belong to the genus Marsilea , which grows worldwide in warm @-@ temperate and tropical regions . Marsilea can be distinguished from the other two genera by the presence of four leaflets on each leaf , although some species occasionally produce six leaflets per leaf . A second genus Regnellidium includes a single living species that grows only in southern Brazil and neighboring parts of Argentina ; it has only two leaflets per leaf . The third genus Pilularia grows widely in temperate regions of both the northern and southern hemispheres . Its leaves do not subdivide into leaflets but are slender and tapered to a point , so that it is often overlooked and mistaken for a grass . There are only about five species known . 
 The closest relatives of the Marsileaceae are the <unk> , which are also aquatic and heterosporous . However , both of these other fern families float freely on the surface of ponds or lakes instead of rooting in soil or mud . The close relationship of these groups to the Marsileaceae is supported by both morphologic and molecular analysis , as well as by the discovery of an intermediate fossil named <unk> . In general , the <unk> and <unk> have a much better fossil record than the Marsileaceae . Until recently , <unk> <unk> was the oldest fossil member known ; it is a preserved sporocarp containing spores , found in Tertiary chert of India . In 2000 , the discovery of fossilized sporocarps from the Cretaceous of eastern North America was announced . These fossils were assigned to the species Regnellidium <unk> , and pushed the known history of the Marsileaceae back into the Mesozoic . The oldest fossil known for the Marsileaceae is <unk> <unk> from the Upper Jurassic or Lower Cretaceous of Japan . The fossils include leaves with visible veins , as well as sporocarps . 
 = = Morphology = = 
 The Marsileaceae share many of the basic structural characteristics common to most ferns , but the differences are more noticeable than the similarities . Species of this family have long , slender rhizomes that creep along or beneath the ground . Their fronds ( leaves ) grow in distinct clusters at nodes along the rhizome , with wide spacing between leaf clusters . As a result , the plants appear to be more stem than leaf , unlike other ferns . 
 Roots grow primarily from the same nodes as the leaves , but may also grow from other locations along the rhizome . The roots of Marsilea and Regnellidium are noteworthy for containing vessel elements . Vessels have also been found in the rhizome of two species of Marsilea . These vessels have evolved independently of vessels in other groups of plants . 
 The leaves are the most easily observed characteristic for the Marsileaceae ; they have a long slender leaf stalk ending in zero , two , or four ( occasionally six ) leaflets . The number of leaflets differs among the three genera and can therefore be used for identification . In Pilularia , the leaves are narrowly cylindrical and taper to a point . Leaves of Regnellidium bear two broad leaflets , while leaves of Marsilea bear four leaflets at the tip . The four leaflets on the leaf of Marsilea are not borne equally . Instead , they are borne in pairs with one pair of leaflets attached slightly higher than the other . Thus in the developing leaf , the leaflets are folded more like the wings of a butterfly than like the leaflets of a clover . 
 As with other ferns , the leaves develop in a circinate pattern . They begin as small , tight spirals which unroll as the leaf matures . At full maturity they are held erect with the leaflets unfolded , except in Pilularia whose leaves have no blade . Temperate species are deciduous , losing their vegetative leaves in winter . Tropical species may also lose their leaves during the dry season . These leaves are photosynthetic , and produce most of the food used by the plant . 
 Some aquatic species of Marsilea , especially those growing with their rhizome submerged , may have vegetative leaves that are dimorphic . Some of their leaves grow up to the surface of the water , and look just like leaves of species growing out of water . These plants also produce other leaves with shorter leaf stalks that are not long enough to reach the surface , and so the leaflets remain underwater . These leaves have different anatomical and cellular characteristics better suited to their submerged environment . 
 In addition to their vegetative ( sterile ) leaflets , all species of Marsileaceae produce fertile ( spore @-@ producing ) leaflets at or near the base of the photosynthetic leaves . This reproductive portion looks and functions very differently from the vegetative portion of the leaves . 
 = = Life cycle = = 
 Like other ferns , members of the Marsileaceae produce spores , but not seeds when they reproduce . Unlike other ferns , the spores in this family are produced inside sporocarps . These are hairy , short @-@ stalked , bean @-@ shaped structures usually 3 to 8 mm in diameter with a hardened outer covering . This outer covering is tough and resistant to drying out , allowing the spores inside to survive unfavorable conditions such as winter frost or summer desiccation . Despite this toughness , the sporocarps will open readily in water if conditions are favorable , and specimens have been successfully germinated after being stored for more than 130 years . Each growing season , only one sporocarp typically develops per node along the rhizome near the base of the other leaf @-@ stalks , though in some species of Marsilea there may be two or occasionally as many as twenty . The resemblance of the sporocarps to <unk> gives the family its common name of <unk> . 
 The sporocarps are functionally and developmentally modified leaflets , although they have much shorter stalks than the vegetative leaflets . Inside the sporocarp , the modified leaflets bear several sori , each of which consists of several sporangia covered by a thin hood of tissue ( the indusium ) . Each sorus includes a mix of two types of sporangium , each type producing only one of two kinds of spores . Toward the center of each sorus and developing first are the <unk> , each of which will produce a single large female <unk> . Surrounding them at the edge of the sorus and developing later are the <unk> , each of which will produce many small male microspores . 
 Because the Marsileaceae produce two kinds of spore ( and thus two kinds of gametophyte ) , they are called heterosporous . While <unk> is the norm among all plants with seeds , such as the flowering plants and conifers , it is very rare among other groups of plants . Also , most heterosporous plants produce their two kinds of sporangia in different places on the plant . Since the Marsileaceae grow both kinds together in a single cluster , they differ from other plants in this regard as well . 
 The spores remain dormant inside the sporocarp through unfavorable conditions , but when conditions are suitable and wet , the sporocarp will germinate . It splits into halves , allowing the tissue coiled inside to become hydrated . As this internal tissue swells with water , it pushes the halves of the hard outer covering apart , and emerges as a long gelatinous worm @-@ like sorophore . The sorophore is a sorus @-@ bearing structure unique to the Marsileaceae ; it may extend to more than ten times the length of the sporocarp inside which it was coiled . This extension carries the numerous spore @-@ producing sori attached along each side of the sorophore out into the water . 
 = = Human uses = = 
 Some species of Marsilea are cultivated in garden pools or aquaria . The Indigenous Australians once made a porridge of pulverized Marsilea sporocarps called <unk> . However , the sporocarps contain toxic levels of <unk> , so careful preparation methods must be used in order for the <unk> to be safe for consumption . 
 = Endtroducing ..... = 
 Endtroducing ..... is the debut studio album by American music producer DJ Shadow , released on November 19 , 1996 by Mo ' Wax Recordings and A & M Records . The album is known for being composed almost entirely of sampled content , most of which originated from various vinyl records obtained by DJ Shadow during trips to record shops . This is further reflected on the album sleeve . Endtroducing ..... was produced by Shadow in the span of two years using minimal amounts of equipment , most notably the Akai MPC60 sampler . In creating the album 's overall atmosphere , he strived to capture the downbeat nature of his previous releases for the Mo ' Wax label . The album 's content features both moody , slow @-@ paced tracks and upbeat jams reminiscent of DJ Shadow 's early hip hop influences . 
 Endtroducing ..... received universal acclaim from critics , who praised DJ Shadow 's approach to sampling and the beats he created from samples . It ranked highly on various year @-@ end lists of the best albums of 1996 . The album is considered to be a landmark work in the instrumental hip hop movement , with DJ Shadow 's innovative sampling techniques and arrangements influencing other producers to create similar sample @-@ based works . Endtroducing ..... has since appeared in several publications ' lists of the decade 's greatest albums . The album was released to positive reception in the United Kingdom , where DJ Shadow had already established himself as a rising act . It reached the top twenty of the UK Albums Chart and was later certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) . Mo ' Wax issued four singles to promote the album , including the chart hits " Midnight in a Perfect World " and " Stem " . However , it would take considerably longer for Endtroducing ..... to find success in the United States . Upon completing promotion of the album and returning to his hometown of Davis , California , DJ Shadow devoted his time to creating new music . Endtroducing ..... later peaked at number 37 on the American Billboard Top Heatseekers albums chart . 
 = = Background = = 
 DJ Shadow began his music career in 1989 as a disc jockey for the University of California , Davis campus radio station <unk> . He had previously experimented with a four @-@ track recorder in his high school years to create music utilizing samples , having been inspired by other sample @-@ based music such as It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back ( 1988 ) by American hip hop group Public Enemy . His <unk> work impressed A & R representative Dave " <unk> " Klein , leading him to sign DJ Shadow to the Hollywood BASIC label to produce music and remixes . DJ Shadow 's output during this period – including the 17 @-@ minute long " Entropy " and his work with the <unk> crew – brought him to the attention of British musician James Lavelle , who then signed DJ Shadow to his Mo ' Wax label . 
 DJ Shadow 's singles for Mo ' Wax – including " In / Flux " and " Lost and Found ( <unk> ) " – were , as Sean Cooper of AllMusic wrote , hailed as " genre @-@ bending works of art that merged elements of funk , rock , hip hop , ambient , jazz , soul , and used @-@ bin found records . " Andy Pemberton , a music journalist writing for Mixmag , coined the term " trip hop " in June 1994 to describe " In / Flux " and similar tracks being spun in London clubs at the time . DJ Shadow 's follow @-@ up single " What Does Your Soul Look Like " topped the British independent music charts . Following this period , he began work on his debut album , intent on capturing the downbeat mood that characterized his aforementioned three singles . The album was aptly titled Endtroducing ..... , as according to DJ Shadow , " it signified the fourth and final chapter in a series of pieces that I was doing for Mo ' Wax with a certain sound , a certain tone , a certain atmosphere . " 
 = = Production = = 
 DJ Shadow started production of the album in 1994 , assembling initial work in his California apartment and later using The Glue Factory – the home studio of music producer and colleague Dan the Automator – as his work station . In making Endtroducing ..... , DJ Shadow strived to create an " entirely 100 % sample @-@ based album . " His studio set @-@ up was minimal , with only three primary pieces of equipment being utilized in making the album : an Akai MPC60 sampler , a <unk> SL @-@ 1200 turntable and an Alesis ADAT tape recorder . The Akai MPC60 was particularly instrumental in the production of Endtroducing ..... , with the sampler being used for almost all composition . DJ Shadow has referred to the device as " the instrument I took seriously in terms of becoming the best at it , or one of the best . " He sampled from various vinyl albums and singles accumulated from his trips to Rare Records , a record shop located in his native Sacramento , where he would spend several hours each day searching for music . His routine is depicted in the documentary film Scratch ( 2001 ) , directed by Doug Pray . 
 The sampled content on Endtroducing ..... originates from various sources , including music of genres ranging from hip hop , jazz , funk , psychedelia , and heavy metal as well as films and interviews . DJ Shadow layered , programmed , and cut samples into smaller fragments to create new tracks . He opted to sample from more obscure selections , making it a personal rule of his to lean away from using more popular material , saying : " I 've always pushed myself to use obscure things , and if I use something obvious , it 's usually only to break my own rules . " Samples of more prominent artists such as Björk and Metallica are , however , present throughout the record . Minor vocal contributions were provided by American rappers Lyrics Born and Gift of <unk> , both personal friends of DJ Shadow . 
 = = Composition = = 
 DJ Shadow has said that his albums " have always been really varied . " Speaking of the variation on Endtroducing ..... , he explained : " Even on an album like Endtroducing [ ... ] I feel like ' Organ Donor ' sounds nothing like ' The Number Song ' which sounds nothing like ' Midnight ' and on and on . " DJ Shadow has also said that he was " in despair " and often depressed during the production of the album and that " [ his ] feelings of self @-@ doubt and self @-@ esteem come through in the music . " 
 Endtroducing ..... is opened by " Best Foot Forward " , a brief 48 @-@ second collage of various hip hop vocal samples , along with instances of scratching . " Building Steam with a Grain of Salt " is built around a looped piano melody , with various other musical elements entering throughout the song 's duration : interview samples , a women 's choir , bass fills , electronically altered drum kicks , and a funk guitar . " The Number Song " is characterized by its usage of various breakbeats and vocal samples of count @-@ offs . " Changeling " is reminiscent of new @-@ age music and differs from the fast @-@ paced nature of the album 's previous tracks , slowly building up as more samples are mixed in before finally ending with a " sublimely spacey " coda . It segues into the first of three " transmissions " placed throughout the album , each featuring a recurring sample from the film Prince of Darkness ( 1987 ) . " What Does Your Soul Look Like ( Part 4 ) " evokes " uneasy futurism and techno @-@ anxiety " and fuses a " rolling bass groan " with wordless , robotic chants . Track six is an untitled interlude featuring a man reciting a monologue about " Maureen and her five sisters " over a funk sample . 
 The album 's second half is opened by the two @-@ part " Stem / Long Stem " , which recalls genres such as ambient and jungle . DJ Shadow 's trademark drum chopping is juxtaposed with several other diverse sampled parts , including string movements , comedy routines , film soundtracks , and blues music . Andy Kellman of AllMusic describes it as a " suite of often melancholy music , a piece that consistently refuses to be pigeonholed into any musical style . " " Transmission 2 " plays before the album proceeds with " Mutual Slump " , a " sedate funk " track featuring female spoken narration and prominent samples of Björk 's " Possibly Maybe " . " Organ Donor " is structured around a chopped @-@ up organ solo from Giorgio Moroder 's " Tears " , backed by a funk breakbeat . " Why Hip @-@ Hop Sucks in ' 96 " – DJ Shadow 's commentary on the state of hip hop music at the time – is a brief interlude featuring a looping G @-@ funk @-@ esque beat and a lone voice proclaiming : " It 's the money ! " 
 " Midnight in a Perfect World " layers a soulful vocal line and a slow drum beat . It is based around mournful piano sampled from David Axelrod 's 1969 song " The Human Abstract " . " Napalm Brain / Scatter Brain " builds slowly , starting with a bassline and a looped drum break before its tempo speeds and additional instrumentation enters ; the track eventually reaches its climax and deconstructs itself , leaving a single string sample playing by its conclusion . Endtroducing ..... concludes on a somber note with " What Does Your Soul Look Like ( Part 1 – Blue Sky <unk> ) " , a wistful track that blends a warm saxophone hook with a keyboard refrain . The track eventually transitions into a third and final " transmission " , which closes the album with the words " It is happening again . " being spoken by an " enigmatic " voice , that of The Giant from the television series Twin Peaks .

 DJ Shadow promoted the album during various interviews and press appearances . The album performed well in the United Kingdom , spending three weeks on the UK Albums Chart and peaking at # 17 . It also managed to chart in the Netherlands , where it peaked at # 75 . " Midnight in a Perfect World " had previously been released as the album 's first single in September , and released to American college and modern rock stations in January 1997 . The single 's music video , directed by B Plus , received prominent airtime on the MTV program Amp ; the single itself peaked at number 54 on the UK Singles Chart . " Stem " was released as the album 's second single on October 28 , 1996 , peaking at number 74 in the United Kingdom and at number 14 in Ireland – DJ Shadow 's first top twenty hit on a singles chart . A remix single of " What Does Your Soul Look Like ( Part 1 – Blue Sky <unk> ) " followed in 1997 , reaching a peak position of 54 in the UK . A fourth and final single – a double A @-@ side release featuring American music producer Cut Chemist 's remix of " The Number Song " and DJ Shadow 's own remix of English electronic music band Depeche Mode 's " Painkiller " – was issued on February 23 , 1998 . 
 Describing the time spent promoting the album as " some weird roller coaster ride " , DJ Shadow was dismayed by the lack of reaction he received upon returning to his hometown of Davis , compared to the thriving attention he had received within the British music scene . He felt that he had been manipulated by the press and his record label and " went from being angry to being depressed about the perceived lack of control [ he ] had in [ his ] life . " DJ Shadow found himself compelled to produce new tracks such as " High Noon " as a way of expressing his feelings at the time . It was following this period that an interest in DJ Shadow 's work began to generate in the United States , with newspapers running stories on Endtroducing ..... and DJ Shadow receiving several phone calls a day , enough to convince him to hire his own manager . The album later debuted on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart , where it eventually peaked at number 37 . A deluxe edition of Endtroducing ..... was released on June 7 , 2005 . The re @-@ issue includes a second disc of B @-@ sides , remixes , and demo material entitled Excessive Ephemera as well as liner notes by DJ Shadow discussing the album 's making .

 Endtroducing ..... received widespread acclaim from critics when it was first released . Alternative Press called it " an undeniable hip @-@ hop masterpiece " showing " DJ Shadow remembers that sampling is an art form " , while David <unk> from The Guardian said the record was " not only one of the most daring and original albums of recent times , but also one of the loveliest . " In Playboy , Robert Christgau claimed that while listeners unfamiliar with its style of music would not find the tracks as powerful , " they are so rich and eclectic , and spun out with such a sense of flow , that this album establishes the kind of convincing aural reality other British techno experimenters only fantasize about . " Tom Wilkes of Melody Maker wrote : " The album flips hip hop inside out all over again like a reversible glove , and again , and again , and each time it 's sudden and new . I am , I confess , totally confounded by it . I hear a lot of good records , but very few impossible ones ... You need this record . You are incomplete without it . " Author and rock critic Greil Marcus published a glowing review of the album in his " Real Life Rock Top Ten " column for Interview , where he called it " absolutely modern – which is to say ambient @-@ dreamy and techno @-@ abstract " and " quite brilliant throughout " . 
 Jon Wiederhorn of Entertainment Weekly likened Endtroducing ..... to " a surreal film soundtrack on which jazz , classical , and jungle fragments are artfully blended with turntable tricks and dialogue snippets " and commended that it " takes hip @-@ hop into the next dimension " , while Simon Williams of NME called DJ Shadow " both slyly knowing and brilliantly naive , fusing the dramatic and the deranged to his own sweet end . " Sia Michel of Spin said that the album " practically folds you into its symphonic fantasia , the coming @-@ of @-@ age story of a 24 @-@ year @-@ old bunk @-@ bed dreamer . " Tony Green of JazzTimes commended DJ Shadow 's " unerring ear for motif and texture " . Jon Wiederhorn of Q magazine also responded favorably , writing : " Shadow 's brief is to develop a totally sample @-@ based idiom , weaving a cinematically broad spectrum so deftly layered that the sampling @-@ is @-@ stealing argument falls flat . " 
 Endtroducing ..... appeared in numerous critics ' lists of the best albums of 1996 . The album topped the year @-@ end polls of Muzik and OOR , while placing second in Melody Maker 's . It was voted fourth place on The Village Voice 's annual Pazz & Jop critics ' poll for 1996 . In his dean 's list , poll creator Robert Christgau named Endtroducing ..... the best album of the year . The album also ranked in the top ten of year @-@ end lists by the The Face , the Los Angeles Times , Mojo , NME , and Vox .

 Endtroducing ..... has been frequently ranked in professional lists of the all @-@ time greatest albums .

" A decade on , " wrote Mojo , " DJ Shadow 's <unk> essay on record collecting as a creative endeavour has lost none of its grandeur . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said of the album : " ... it 's innovative , but it builds on a solid historical foundation , giving it a rich , multi @-@ faceted sound . It 's not only a major breakthrough for hip @-@ hop and electronica , but for pop music . " Will Hermes , writing in Spin , called it " trip @-@ hop 's crowning achievement " . The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die . 
 The almost entirely sampled nature of Endtroducing ..... was considered groundbreaking at the time of its release , and Guinness World Records has cited the album as being the first to be created entirely from sampled sources ( although this isn 't quite true , since the album does in fact contain some spoken @-@ word elements recorded in the studio ) . The album was a driving force in the development of instrumental hip hop music , inspiring several other disc jockeys and producers to create sample @-@ based works . Tim Stelloh of PopMatters cited it as the " benchmark " for the genre . Guitarist Jonny Greenwood of English alternative rock band Radiohead has cited Endtroducing ..... as an influence on his band 's critically acclaimed album OK Computer ( 1997 ) , saying : " We liked how he was cutting up beats quite minutely . " Several of the artists sampled on Endtroducing ..... – including British progressive rock band Nirvana and American musician David Axelrod – have praised the album . DJ Shadow has expressed his surprise at the album 's influence and high regard amongst other musicians , saying : " After the record , I 'd always bump into these world @-@ class producers who 'd say , ' Yeah , Endtroducing ..... – what a great piece of production . ' I just did it on one sampler in a tiny little studio . " 
 Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club suggested that the influence of Endtroducing ..... may have had a negative effect on the album itself , saying that it " has been partially diluted by the symphonic beat @-@ collage culture it helped spawn . " The album 's acclaim set considerably high standards for future releases by DJ Shadow , and he has expressed his dissatisfaction with being expected to " repeat Endtroducing ..... over and over again " . Despite this , DJ Shadow has made it clear that he views the album in a positive light and denies any pressure that may have come about as a result of the album 's praise : " ... people always seem to suggest that there 's this pressure , and that Endtroducing ..... is some kind of albatross , and I 've just honestly never felt that way . I think that I have a healthy enough respect for the lineage of the music and how rare it is that you can connect with an audience . If that will always be ' the record ' then so be it , that 's cool . " As of April 26 , 2005 , Endtroducing ..... has sold upwards of 290 @,@ 000 copies in the United States alone .

 Thunder Run is a wooden roller coaster at the Kentucky Kingdom amusement park in Louisville , Kentucky . The ride originally operated from August 1990 through to October 2009 , when then @-@ operators Six Flags abandoned the park . After remaining standing but not operating since 2009 , Thunder Run reopened in May 2014 when Kentucky Kingdom reopened under new operators . 
 The ride was manufactured by Dinn Corporation and designed by Curtis D. Summers and John Fetterman . With 2 @,@ 850 feet ( 870 m ) of track , Thunder Run stands 90 feet ( 27 m ) tall and features a top speed of 53 miles per hour ( 85 km / h ) . 
 = = History = = 
 Kentucky Kingdom opened on May 23 , 1987 , leasing 10 acres ( 4 @.@ 0 ha ) at the Kentucky Exposition Center property . The Texas investors who operated the park filed it for bankruptcy after only one season of operation . The Ed Hart @-@ led <unk> LLC firm purchased the rights to operate the park in 1989 , reopening the park the following year . As part of the reopening the new operators added a collection of new rides including Thunder Run , which opened in August 1990 . Early in Thunder Run 's operating life , its train had derailed from the lift hill and the ride 's lap bars were found to be unsafe . No injuries were reported from either incident . The original ride was <unk> by Martin & Vleminckx prior to its closure in 2009 . 
 Thunder Run operated until the end of the 2009 season on November 1 . Amid a corporate bankruptcy , on February 4 , 2010 , Six Flags announced the park would cease operations immediately due to the rejection of an amended lease by the Kentucky State Fair Board . Many attempts were made to reopen the park under new operators . Eventually , on June 27 , 2013 , a group of investors led by Ed Hart negotiated an agreement to reopen the park . The group would spend $ 36 million to reopen the park in May 2014 . Thunder Run would be part of the opening day lineup of attractions . Rocky Mountain Construction was hired to refurbish the ride , resulting in the existing wooden track to be replaced . On October 10 , 2013 , Kentucky Kingdom invited members of the media and amusement industry to ride the refurbished Thunder Run . The ride reopened to the public on May 24 , 2014 .

The American Coaster Enthusiasts ' Inside Track magazine ranked Thunder Run as the " fourth best of its kind in the nation " . In 2007 , the Lexington Herald @-@ Leader described the ride as having " a few nice drops and that jerky , clicking wooden coaster feel that some people love , but it never gets too wild " . Tim O 'Brien , formerly of Amusement Business , rode the inaugural run of the ride in 1990 , as well as the first cycle of the refurbished ride in 2013 . O 'Brien describes the updated ride as " a better ride today than it was back then " , commending the ride 's ability to give a classic wooden roller coaster feel , yet run smoothly . He states Thunder Run " is one of the top wooden roller coasters in the world " . 
 In Amusement Today 's annual Golden Ticket Awards , Thunder Run has appeared four times from 2001 through to 2004 . It debuted at position 34 in 2001 before dropping to 49 in 2004 . 
 Mitch Hawker 's worldwide Best Roller Coaster Poll is an annual survey of roller coasters from around the world . It is widely regarded as the best and most accurate of any roller coaster poll available due to its ranking algorithm which prevents the poll from becoming a popularity contest . In the poll , Thunder Run entered at position 30 in 1994 , maintaining an average of 54 for the 17 years that followed . The ride 's ranking in subsequent polls is shown in the table below . 
 = Pilot ( Friday Night Lights ) = 
 " Pilot " is the first episode of the sports drama television series Friday Night Lights . The episode premiered on the NBC network on October 3 , 2006 . It introduces the men and women involved with the Dillon Panthers , a Texas high school football team . In the pilot episode , the team is preparing for the first game of the season , which will be the first game under new head coach Eric Taylor . 
 The show is based on the 2004 film Friday Night Lights , which was in turn based on the 1990 non @-@ fiction book Friday Night Lights : A Town , a Team , and a Dream by H. G. Bissinger . Peter Berg , who is Bissinger 's cousin and who directed the film , wrote and directed the pilot episode , and served as executive producer for the series . While some of the actors from the movie returned to act on the show , most of the actors were cast specifically for the television series . 
 Critical reception of the show was good to average , with a general appreciation for the realistic portrayal of Middle America . Generally speaking , however , there were serious doubts about whether the show would be able to stay on the air very long , though it has since gone on to complete five seasons . The episode 's viewership of just over seven million was characterized as disappointing , though it did relatively well among men aged 18 to 34 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 It is Monday morning , and five days until the first game of the season for high school football team Dillon Panthers . While coach Eric Taylor is surveying the field , some of the players are getting ready for practice . Fullback Tim Riggins is recovering from a hangover , and his brother Billy warns him that he could be kicked off the team if he does not show . Meanwhile , second @-@ string quarterback Matt Saracen is preparing lunch for his grandmother , before his friend Landry Clarke drives him to practice . At the stadium , a television crew is conducting interviews . It is revealed that coach Taylor , who has recently been made head coach , used to coach the exceptionally gifted quarterback Jason Street . It also becomes clear that there is a deep @-@ seated conflict between Tim Riggins and the brash and loud @-@ mouthed running back Brian " Smash " Williams . Later , at the local fast food restaurant where the players regularly hang out , Landry and Matt try to approach the coach 's daughter Julie . She insists that she does not associate with football players . They assure her that Landry is not on the team and Matt gets virtually no playing time because of Street , but she still rebuffs them both . 
 On Tuesday night a pep rally is held at the local car dealership . The owner and host is Buddy Garrity , who is also the father of Jason Street 's girlfriend Lyla . Coach Taylor is surrounded by members of the local community questioning him about the game . It is gradually emerging how important football is to the town , and the great responsibility that rests on Taylor 's shoulders . His wife Tami , meanwhile , is reluctantly recruited by the society wives to join their book club . Riggins ' girlfriend Tyra Collette tries to stoke up trouble by flirting with both Street and Smash . Wednesday goes by with a team visit to a group of elementary school football players who idolize the older boys . The two teams recite the Lord 's Prayer together . On Thursday night , the night before the game , Street and Riggins are at a party . Riggins lays out his plan of Street going to the National Football League and Riggins living off one percent of Street 's salary . Then they can retire to a ranch where Riggins will act as Street 's caretaker . They make a toast to " Texas Forever " . 
 On game night , coach Taylor gives a pep talk where he warns the players against taking the opponents – <unk> High School – too lightly . They say their rallying cry , " Clear Eyes , Full Hearts , Can 't Lose ! " and enter the field . The first half is problematic for the Panthers , and at the end of the second half , the visitors make a potentially game @-@ winning interception . Street is the only one left to make a tackle . He succeeds , but the tackle is so hard that he remains prone on the ground . The crowd is left in silence as the starting quarterback does not move , and has to be taken off on a stretcher to a waiting ambulance . Coach Taylor now has to put in the highly unprepared Saracen , who initially makes several silly mistakes . The coach tells him to relax and focus , and Saracen manages to connect with Smash , who scores a touchdown . Riggins recovers the ensuing onside kick for the Panthers . In the final seconds of the game , Saracen throws a long pass to a receiver , who makes it to the end zone for another touchdown . As the Panthers win the game , both teams gather at mid @-@ field to pray for Jason Street . Team members then head over to the hospital , where Street 's condition is still unclear . Riggins and Smash reconcile , while Julie tries to comfort Lyla . In a voice @-@ over , coach Taylor is heard saying that " We are all vulnerable , and we will all at some point in our lives fall .

 The television series Friday Night Lights was based on the 2004 movie Friday Night Lights , which was in turn based on the 1990 non @-@ fiction book Friday Night Lights : A Town , a Team , and a Dream by H. G. Bissinger . The book describes the 1988 season of the Permian Panthers , a high school football team in Odessa , Texas . While the movie was set in 1988 , the television series takes place in the present . Peter Berg – who is Bissinger 's cousin – co @-@ wrote and directed the movie , and also wrote and directed the Friday Night Lights pilot . In addition to writing the script of the pilot , he also executively produced the entire project together with Sarah Aubrey and John Cameron . 
 Berg expressed regret in interviews about having to sacrifice certain story lines in the movie , due to time restraints . The television series allowed interpersonal issues to be addressed more in depth . " The idea was to create a television show that exists as much more of a soap opera , or an exploration of human beings , " said Berg in an interview , " than as a chronicle of a football team 's pursuit of glory . " The series was filmed partly in Austin , and a call went out for local football players to play part roles in the show . In an attempt to maintain an authentic Texas environment , elements were incorporated from local society . Football scenes were filmed at the local Pflugerville High School 's <unk> Stadium and at the <unk> Complex , while uniforms were based on those of real @-@ life Pflugerville Panthers .

 Casting of the show included using some of the actors who had already appeared in the movie , including Brad Leland as Buddy Garrity , a character similar to the one he had played in the movie , and Connie Britton as Tami Taylor , wife of coach Eric Taylor . Britton had felt that the female story lines were underplayed in the movie , but was promised by Berg that these topics would be given more attention in the television series . Kyle Chandler , playing the role of head coach Eric Taylor , said he had played some high school football , " but I was no good " . He recalled showing up to an early meeting with Berg after a friend 's party where he " had too much to drink , smoked too many cigarettes " and was generally quite tired . Berg liked that look , since he wanted the coach to appear old and weary . " You need to drink a lot of scotch and smoke a lot of cigarettes , " he advised . 
 Scott Porter , playing the role of quarterback Jason Street , knew that his character would be paralyzed from the first episode on , and said that this was a big part of the reason why he took the role . Porter played high school football as a wide receiver . He also played on a highly successful team in high school , and described himself as huge fan of the Friday Night Lights movie . Meanwhile Taylor Kitsch , the show 's Tim Riggins , said in an interview that he was able to relate to his character based on his own personal experiences : " my father is out of my life , more or less " , he revealed in an interview , " So I discover stuff that maybe I wasn 't even dealing with as a person . " 
 Zach Gilford said about his character Matt Saracen that " there are different parts of it from people I know growing up or people I 'm tight with now " . He credited Peter Berg with coming up with the Saracen character , and said he was grateful to " have some of the most realistic and heartfelt storylines . " When asked which of the actors would have been drafted highest by the NFL , he replied " Probably Taylor [ Kitsch ] . He 's a good athlete , but Scott will kill me for saying that . Scott played football growing up and he has a good arm , but Taylor is faster and I think that would help his draft status . " Gaius Charles , who plays " Smash " Williams , graduated from the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama in 2005 , determined to find a job within a year , which he did with Friday Night Lights . He describes himself as " all right " at football , but says that he was taken aback by the intensity of the plays on the set . 
 Mack Brown , the head coach of the University of Texas at Austin Longhorn football team , plays a cameo in the episodes . He appears in the pep rally scene , where he is a member of the local community questioning coach Taylor . Brown played without a script because , according to Berg , " you 've heard fathers for 33 years , so you ought to know what to say . " Kyle Chandler , as coach Taylor , was reportedly surprised by Brown 's intensity .

 Lisa de Moraes , in her " TV Column " for The Washington Post , pointed out that in spite of critical praise , the show 's premiere did poorly with viewers . With 7 @.@ 17 million viewers , it had " the worst ratings performance for any series premiere in the official 2006 @-@ 07 TV season . " On the other hand , Cynthia Fuchs of PopMatters wrote that the episode 's good performance among the coveted demographic of men aged 18 to 34 could be a saving grace . The episode was nominated for an Artios Award for " Best Dramatic Pilot Casting " . Casting director Linda Lowy was the nominee for the award , which was won by the series Brothers & Sisters for the episode " Patriarchy " . 
 The pilot of Friday Night Lights received good to middling reviews . Virginia Heffernan of The New York Times gave the episode a very good review , and suggested the series could be good enough to transcend the medium of television . She praised the " intelligent performances " of the actors , and though she found the " Smash " Williams character less convincing than the others , she thought it improved towards the end . She also appreciated the use of audio to tell the story : the buzz of a surgeon 's saw or the sound of skin stuck to leather . Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club , wrote " I appreciate the feel for the high stakes attached to small @-@ market school sports , the knowing take on the high @-@ school caste system , and the details of family life . " Still , he worried that America was " failing to fall in love with " the show , and expressed doubts as to whether it would be allowed to survive . 
 Henry Goldblatt , writing for Entertainment Weekly , gave the episode a grade B. He accused the show of abandoning the " racial diversity and the gritty poverty " of the film , but still allowed that Peter Berg had " kept the thrust " . The Matt Saracen character was singled out as particularly promising . While positively contrasting the show with other teen @-@ age dramas like One Tree Hill , Goldblatt also had doubts about its staying power . Variety 's Brian Lowry called the show " Earnest , beautifully shot and perhaps more organically religious than anything else in primetime " . Still , he felt the show was " like one of those family programs middle America and conservatives pine for that too few of them actually bother to watch " . He pointed out that the show had to compete with both House and Dancing With the Stars , among women as well as men , in order to survive . The Washington Post critic Tom Shales called the show " Extraordinary in just about every conceivable way , " particularly emphasising the quality of the cast . Shales did have issues with the documentary style of show 's camera movements , but still thought it could be the " best new drama series of the season " . 
 = Laid Back ( album ) = 
 Laid Back is the debut studio album by American singer @-@ songwriter Gregg Allman , released in October 1973 by Capricorn Records . Allman , best known as the vocalist / lyricist of the Allman Brothers Band , first began considering a solo career after internal disagreements with that group . He developed the album as a small creative outlet wherein he would assume full control , and he co @-@ produced the album alongside Johnny Sandlin . Laid Back was largely recorded in March 1973 at Capricorn Sound Studios in Macon , Georgia , with additional recording taking place at the Record Plant in New York City . 
 The album explores Allman 's varying influences , including rhythm and blues and soul music . It consists of several cover songs , originals , and a traditional hymn , and contains performances from a host of musicians , most notably Scott Boyer and Tommy Talton on guitars , Bill Stewart on drums , and Charlie Hayward on bass guitar . The album was created while Allman also worked on Brothers and Sisters , the fourth Allman Brothers album . The album title was a studio term Allman coined for relaxing a song 's tempo , while its cover was painted by Abdul Mati Klarwein . 
 Upon its release , Laid Back received positive reviews from music critics , and it peaked at number 13 on Billboard 's Top LPs & Tape chart . To support the album , Allman embarked on an ambitious tour , consisting of a full band and an entire string orchestra . Two singles were released to promote the record , with lead single " Midnight Rider " becoming a top 20 hit in the U.S. and Canada . It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) in 1974 for shipping 500 @,@ 000 copies in the U.S. , making it one of Allman 's best @-@ selling albums . 
 = = Background = = 
 Gregg Allman first began exploring music during his teen years in Daytona Beach , Florida . He and his brother , Duane Allman , founded their first band , the Allman Joys , in the mid @-@ 1960s . That group evolved into the Hour Glass , which recorded two albums for Liberty Records between 1967 and 1968 . Subsequently , the duo founded the Allman Brothers Band , which grew in fame in the early 1970s due to their live shows , which combined traditional electric blues , jazz @-@ style improvisation and self @-@ penned instrumentals . Their 1971 live album At Fillmore East represented a commercial and artistic breakthrough . Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle crash later that year , but the band continued on , recording 1972 's Eat a Peach , a hybrid live / studio album that became an even greater success , shipping gold and peaking at number four on Billboard 's Top 200 Pop Albums chart . 
 By that summer , the group began rehearsals for what would become their fourth studio album , Brothers and Sisters . Allman brought the band the song " Queen of Hearts " , which he had worked on for , by that point , a year and a half . He was inebriated at the time , and the members would not consider the song . Later that night he returned to Capricorn Studios alone to work on his own songs . He worked for forty @-@ two hours , slept for six , and returned for a final session that wound up lasting a further twenty @-@ eight hours . " Mentally and physically exhausted , " he was unhappy with his output , and discarded the tape reels in a trash can , hoping to set them aflame . Producer Johnny Sandlin walked in and convinced Allman to start over . Together , they worked on a cover of the Jackson Browne song " These Days " , enlisting Scott Boyer to play pedal steel guitar on the track . Later in the year , he worked on several demos for the album at Criteria Studios in Miami , Florida alongside friend Deering Howe and bassist Berry Oakley ( who was killed in a motorcycle crash not long afterward ) . 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 Work stalled on Laid Back as production commenced on Brothers and Sisters , though the two were worked on roughly concurrently . Sandlin , a former Hour Glass bassist and longtime Allman friend , helped hire various session musicians to work on the album , including Boyer and Tommy Talton on guitars , Bill Stewart on drums , and Charlie Hayward on bass guitar . Allman likened the album 's presence to a mistress , noting that the rest of the band were not thrilled . It slowed down progress on their own album , and it created tension between the group , particularly between Allman and guitarist Dickey Betts . Nevertheless , several Allman Brothers members made appearances on Laid Back , including Jaimoe , who provided congas , and Chuck Leavell , a new addition to the Brothers , who added piano . Leavell stayed in Macon after leaving Dr. John 's band , and found himself contributing to both albums . Allman felt Leavell 's style of playing fit the album perfectly : " He 'd give you exactly what you wanted , without any questions , and if he embellished on a song , he made it even better . " 
 Opening the album is a version of " Midnight Rider " , which Allman first composed and recorded for the Allman Brothers Band 's second album , Idlewild South ( 1970 ) . For the new recording , Allman aimed for a " swamp " -like atmosphere , " with the image of moss hanging off the trees , alligators and fog , darkness , [ and ] witches , " he later wrote . Boyer wrote the song " All My Friends " , which Allman provides harmonies on . " I 've always loved the Everly Brothers style of harmony , but I didn 't want it to just follow the traditional 1 – 3 – 5 pattern , " he recalled . 
 The album cover was painted by Abdul Mati Klarwein , best known for creating the artwork to Miles Davis 's Bitches Brew ( 1971 ) . Allman was introduced to him through a friend . Allman did not have the time to come sit for the painting , so Klarwein worked with a photograph . In Allman 's book , My Cross to Bear he said " I loved that cover ; I thought it turned out perfect . It cost me $ 1 @,@ 500 back then , but today it would like $ 50 @,@ 000 , maybe even $ 150 @,@ 000 . " Allman 's girlfriend at the time ( and later wife ) Janice Blair appears on the album 's sleeve , riding a horse . The album 's title was an inside reference to a studio term Allman coined for when a song had too much energy and needed to be more relaxed , or " laid back . " He spoke more on the term in his later autobiography , My Cross to Bear : 
 = = Reception = = 
 Laid Back received glowing reviews from music critics at the time of its release . Rolling Stone reviewer Tony Glover said " Laid Back isn 't quite what you 'd expect from Gregg 's work with the Brothers Band . Instead , it 's a moody LP , often tinged with grandeur , and maybe just a little too rich and one @-@ colored in spots . But on the whole , a moving look at another side of a finely charismatic singer / writer . " Billboard named it a " Spotlight " pick among its Top Album Picks in November 1973 , with the reviewer deeming it " a masterpiece of a set ... featuring exceptional displays of vocal and instrumental talent in many musical areas . " 
 The album has continued to receive positive attention in the years since its release . Allmusic stated : " Recorded in the same year as the Brothers and Sisters album , this solo debut release is a beautiful amalgam of R & B , folk , and gospel sounds , with the best singing on any of Gregg Allman 's solo releases . " In 2006 , Tom Moon of NPR reviewed the album as a part of his " Shadow Classics " series , calling it " amazing stuff , deep and intense yet nowhere near the decibel levels of his work with the [ Allman Brothers ] band . ... But he 's equally compelling — maybe even more so — in a quieter space , when he 's less fired up . " 
 = = Tour = = 
 To promote the album , Allman embarked on a nationwide tour with the musicians who helped record the album as his band . Long inspired by Joe Cocker 's Mad Dogs & Englishmen ( 1970 ) , Allman hired a string orchestra to accompany the group . Drawn from the New York Philharmonic , it consisted of three cellos , six violins , and seven violas . The tour lasted one month and performed exclusively in upscale theaters , which Allman requested for the best sound quality possible . He found performing with the orchestra strikingly different than singing with the Allman Brothers Band , having to adjust his normal singing volume to blend better . A live album of material from the tour was released as The Gregg Allman Tour later that year , to help recoup costs for the tour . " I was really pleased with how the tour went . Some nights were better than others , but they were all good , " Allman would later recall .

 = Walter Nowotny = 
 Major Walter " <unk> " Nowotny ( 7 December 1920 – 8 November 1944 ) was an Austrian @-@ born German fighter ace of World War II . He is credited with 258 aerial victories — that is , 258 aerial combat encounters resulting in the destruction of the enemy aircraft — in 442 combat missions . Nowotny achieved 255 of these victories on the Eastern Front and three while flying one of the first jet fighters , the Messerschmitt Me 262 , in the Defense of the Reich . He scored most of his victories in the Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 190 , and approximately 50 in the Messerschmitt Bf 109 . 
 Nowotny joined the Luftwaffe in 1939 and completed his fighter pilot training in 1941 , after which he was posted to Jagdgeschwader 54 " <unk> " ( JG 54 ) on the Eastern Front . Nowotny was the first pilot to achieve 250 victories – 194 in 1943 alone – earning him the coveted Ritterkreuz mit Eichenlaub , Schwertern und Brillanten ( Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves , Swords and Diamonds ) on 19 October 1943 . For propaganda reasons , he was ordered to cease operational flying . 
 Reinstated to front @-@ line service in September 1944 , Nowotny tested and developed tactics for the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter . He was credited with three victories in this aircraft type before being killed in a crash following combat with United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) fighters on 8 November 1944 . After his death , the first operational jet fighter wing , Jagdgeschwader 7 " Nowotny " , was named in his honour .

 Walter Nowotny was born in <unk> , a small town in Lower Austria . His father , Rudolf Nowotny , was a railway official ; his two brothers , Rudolf and Hubert , became officers in the Wehrmacht . Hubert Nowotny was killed in action in the Battle of Stalingrad . From 1925 to 1935 , his family lived in Schwarzenau until his father was relocated to <unk> , north of Vienna . Walter attended the primary school ( Volksschule ) in Schwarzenau before graduating to the <unk> in <unk> an der <unk> . During these years , he also sang in the Cistercian convent choir in the Zwettl Abbey . 
 Due to his father 's relocation , Nowotny transferred to the secondary school ( Oberschule ) in <unk> an der <unk> , where he received his diploma ( Abitur ) in May 1938 . In his teens , Nowotny was interested in all kinds of sports . In 1935 , he played football for the school team in <unk> , and in 1937 , took first place in the javelin throw and third place in the lower Austrian 1 @,@ 000 metres ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) track and field championships . Nowotny also visited the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin . For his then mandatory Labour Service ( Reichsarbeitsdienst ) , he joined the Luftwaffe on 1 October 1939 .

 Nowotny 's military basic training began at the 2 .

He was promoted to Fahnenjunker @-@ <unk> on 1 March 1940 and shortly afterwards , on 1 April 1940 , to Fahnenjunker @-@ Unteroffizier . On 1 July 1940 , <unk> was promoted again , to the rank of Fähnrich . He completed his pilot training and received the Pilot Badge on 19 August 1940 . Nowotny also trained as a fighter pilot at the Jagdfliegerschule 5 in Wien @-@ Schwechat ( 1 August 1940 – 15 November 1940 ) , the same school that Hans @-@ Joachim Marseille had attended one year earlier . One of his teachers at the Jagdfliegerschule 5 was the Austro @-@ Hungarian World War I ace Julius <unk> . Here Nowotny befriended Karl Schnörrer and Paul Galland , the younger brother of General der Jagdflieger Adolf Galland . Paul Galland claimed 17 aerial victories with Jagdgeschwader 26 ( JG 26 ) on the channel front before he was shot down and killed by a Royal Air Force ( RAF ) Supermarine Spitfire on 31 October 1942 . After graduation from the Jagdfliegerschule 5 , Nowotny was transferred to the I. / Ergänzungs @-@ Jagdgruppe Merseburg on 16 November 1940 , flying fighter cover for the Leuna industrial works .

 Nowotny was posted to the Ergänzungsstaffel ( Training / Supplement Squadron ) of Jagdgeschwader 54 ( JG 54 ) on 1 December 1940 . JG 54 at the time was under the command of Major Hannes Trautloft . Nowotny was transferred again , this time to the 9th Staffel of JG 54 ( 9 . / JG 54 ) , the so @-@ called <unk> ( Devils ' Squadron ) where he was further trained by veterans from the front line ( 23 February 1941 – 25 March 1941 ) . From 25 March 1941 to 10 March 1942 , <unk> flew with the <unk> of the Ergänzungs @-@ Jagdgruppe JG 54 where he was promoted to Leutnant on 1 April 1941 , effective as of 1 February 1941 . 
 Nowotny flew a Messerschmitt Bf 109 E @-@ 7 " White 2 " on his 24th operational mission on 19 July 1941 and claimed his first two enemy aircraft , both Polikarpov I @-@ 153 biplanes of <unk> @-@ Vozdushnye Sily ( VVS — Military Air Forces ) <unk> 's 12 <unk> / 61 <unk> , over Saaremaa . He was shot down in the same engagement by Alexandr <unk> , also in a Polikarpov I @-@ 153 . According to Soviet archives , no Soviet aircraft was lost in the engagement . Nowotny spent three days in a dinghy in the Gulf of Riga – on one occasion almost being run down by a Soviet destroyer – until finally being washed ashore on the Latvian coast . 
 For the rest of his combat career , Nowotny always wore the trousers ( German : <unk> roughly " shoot down pants " sometimes also referred to as " victory pants " ) that he had worn during those three days in the Gulf of Riga – with one exception , his last sortie , at Achmer on 8 November 1944 , when he was killed flying the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter . Nowotny quickly recovered from his ordeal and on 31 July claimed a <unk> MBR @-@ 2 flying boat north @-@ west of Saaremaa and an Ilyushin DB @-@ 3 bomber south of the island . 
 In 1942 , Nowotny increased his tally of victories and claimed his 30th and 31st kills on 11 July over the <unk> bridgehead , which earned him the Luftwaffe Honor Goblet on 14 July 1942 . Nowotny shot down a further five aircraft on a single day ( 32nd – 36th victories ) on 20 July and seven ( 48th – 54th victories ) on 2 August . After having downed three enemy aircraft on 11 August , Leutnant Nowotny carried out three victory passes over the airfield , despite having sustained combat damage to his own Bf 109 " Black 1 " . In the subsequent landing , his aircraft <unk> and he sustained moderate injuries . Walter Nowotny was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes ) on 4 September , after 56 aerial victories . The Ritterkreuz earned him a home leave to Vienna . Here , the brothers Hubert and Walter met for the last time before Hubert was killed at Stalingrad . Leutnant Nowotny was made Staffelkapitän of 1 . / JG 54 on 25 October , replacing Oberleutnant Heinz Lange . 
 In January 1943 , JG 54 started converting to the agile Focke @-@ Wulf 190 fighter . With the new aircraft , Nowotny scored at an unprecedented " kill " rate , often averaging more than two planes a day for weeks on end . As of 1 February 1943 , Nowotny , Karl Schnörrer , – Nowotny 's wingman since late 1942 – Anton <unk> and Rudolf Rademacher , formed a team known as the " chain of devils " ( <unk> ) or the Nowotny Schwarm , which during the course of the war was credited with 524 combined kills , making them the most successful team in the Luftwaffe . 
 Nowotny scored his 69th to 72nd victory on 16 March . He reached the century mark on 5 June 1943 , on his 344th combat mission . He was the 42nd Luftwaffe pilot to achieve the century mark . By 24 June , he would accumulate a further 24 victories increasing his total to 124 . On 21 August , Nowotny was made Gruppenkommandeur of I. / JG 54 . In August alone , he shot down 49 aircraft – a number matched exactly by Jagdgeschwader 52 's ( JG 52 ) Erich Hartmann – bringing Nowotny 's total to 161 victories . On 1 September , he scored ten victories in two sorties , which took his tally to 183 . Seventy @-@ two hours later , that number had risen to 189 , earning him the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub ) on 8 September . The award was to be personally presented by the Führer , Adolf Hitler , on 22 September 1943 . However , by this date Nowotny had claimed his double century ( 200 ) on 8 September , and , on 15 September , his 215th victory , making him the highest @-@ scoring pilot in the Luftwaffe to that time . Two Lavochkin La @-@ 5s and a Yakovlev Yak @-@ 9 on 17 September brought his score to 218 victories , earning him Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern ) on 22 September 1943 . The planned " Oakleaves " ( Eichenlaub ) presentation thus became a Swords ( Schwerter ) ceremony . 
 = = = Diamonds = = = 
 Nowotny was promoted to Hauptmann on 21 September 1943 , effective as of 1 October , following his 225th victory . On 14 October 1943 , he became the first pilot to reach 250 victories , following his 442 combat missions . Nowotny was celebrating this feat in the Ria Bar in Vilna when he received a phone call from Hitler himself , announcing that he had been awarded the Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub , Schwertern und Brillanten ( Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves , Swords and Diamonds ) , making him the eighth of 27 men to be so honored . 
 The Brillanten ( Diamonds ) were presented by Hitler at the Wolfsschanze , near Kętrzyn ( German : Rastenburg ) on 19 October 1943 . Nowotny immediately went on a short vacation to Vienna before returning to his front @-@ line unit . On 29 October 1943 , Nowotny presented the Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes ( Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross ) to Oberfeldwebel Otto Kittel . In the days following , Nowotny flew as wingman to Karl Schnörrer , helping him accumulate further victories . On 11 November , Anton <unk> was killed when he rammed an Il @-@ 2 Sturmovik . The next day , 12 November 1943 , Schnörrer was severely injured after bailing out at low altitude . Schnörrer was replaced as Nowotny 's wingman by Unteroffizier Ernst Richter . With Richter , Nowotny claimed his final two aerial victories on the Eastern Front on 15 November 1943 . In total , Nowotny had claimed 255 confirmed kills plus a further 50 unconfirmed , before he was taken off combat duty . 
 Nowotny was sent on a propaganda tour in Germany , which included the presentation of the Ritterkreuz des <unk> ( Knight 's Cross of the War Merit Cross ) to the railroad engineer August <unk> on 7 December 1943 – Nowotny 's 23rd birthday . Shortly before Christmas , he visited the Focke @-@ Wulf production site at Bad <unk> , where he was met by Professor Kurt Tank . The mayor of Vienna , <unk> Hanns Blaschke awarded Nowotny the city 's ring of honor on 11 January 1944 , the presentation taking place a week later . It was a token that Nowotny accepted reluctantly , feeling that he did not deserve it . His next official visit was the <unk> ( office machinery factory ) at Zella @-@ <unk> , before he briefly returned to Jagdgeschwader 54 . Nowotny was made Geschwaderkommodore of Jagdgeschwader 101 ( JG 101 ) and commander of the Jagdfliegerschule 1 , a Luftwaffe fighter pilot training school at Pau in southern France , in April 1944 . 
 = = = Kommando Nowotny and death = = = 
 In September 1944 , Nowotny was made commander of a specialist unit dubbed Kommando Nowotny , flying the newly developed Messerschmitt Me 262 out of airfields near Osnabrück . The unit not only had to contend with the enemy , but also with working through the ' teething ' phase of the Me 262 and developing the tactics appropriate for a jet unit . On 7 October , Nowotny downed a B @-@ 24 Liberator bomber , his first aerial victory on the Western Front . 
 Generals Alfred Keller and Adolf Galland had scheduled an inspection at Achmer for the afternoon of 7 November 1944 . Galland had already visited Kommando Nowotny several times and was deeply concerned over the high attrition rate and meager success achieved by the Me 262 . After inspecting the two airfields at Achmer and Hesepe , he stayed in the <unk> barracks discussing the problems of the past few weeks . Several pilots openly expressed their doubts as to the readiness of the Me 262 for combat operations . 
 The next morning , 8 November 1944 , the Generals arrived again at Nowotny 's command post and Keller declared that the aces of the past years had become cowards and that the Luftwaffe had lost its fighting spirit . Shortly after , news reached the command post of a large bomber formation approaching . Two Rotten of Me 262 were prepared for take @-@ off , Erich <unk> and Franz Schall at Hesepe , and Nowotny and Günther Wegmann at Achmer . At first only Schall and Wegmann managed to take off because <unk> had a punctured tire during taxiing and Nowotny 's turbines initially refused to start . With some delay , Nowotny took off and engaged the enemy on his own , Schall and Wegmann having since retired from the action after sustaining battle damage . Nowotny radioed that he had downed a B @-@ 24 Liberator and a P @-@ 51 Mustang before he reported one engine failing and made one final garbled transmission containing the word " burning " . Helmut Lennartz recalled : 
 " I remember Nowotny 's crash very well . Feldwebel Gossler , a radio operator with our unit , had set up a radio on the airfield . Over this set I and many others listened to the radio communications with Nowotny 's aircraft . His last words were , " I 'm on fire " or " it 's on fire " . The words were slightly garbled . 
 It remains unclear whether Nowotny was killed due to engine failure or whether he was shot down by United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) Captain Ernest <unk> ( 20th Fighter Group ) and 1st Lieutenant Edward " Buddy " Haydon ( 357th Fighter Group ) east of Hesepe . In recent years , United States military historians proposed that Nowotny 's victor may have been P @-@ 51D pilot Lieutenant Richard W. Stevens of the <unk> Fighter Group . Many witnesses observed Nowotny 's Me 262 A @-@ 1a Werk Nummer 110 400 ( factory number ) " White 8 " dive vertically out of the clouds and crash at Epe , 2 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 6 mi ) east of Hesepe . The Wehrmacht announced his death on 9 November 1944 in the daily Wehrmachtbericht . 
 Nowotny was given a state funeral in Vienna . The guard of honor was composed of his friend Karl Schnörrer , Oberst Gordon Gollob , Major Rudolf Schoenert , Hauptmann Heinz <unk> , Major Josef <unk> and Major Georg <unk> . The eulogy was delivered by General der Jagdflieger Adolf Galland and Generaloberst Otto <unk> . Nowotny was buried at the Zentralfriedhof in Vienna in a grave of honor sponsored by the city of Vienna , which was still part of Nazi Germany . Following an initiative by the Austrian Green Party and debates in the Vienna Landtag , a resolution supported by Social Democrats and Greens was passed to remove the status of honor in 2003 .
