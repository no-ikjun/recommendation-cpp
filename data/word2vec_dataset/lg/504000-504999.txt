 Other companies assisted in distributing the console to various countries worldwide . <unk> handled the Mega Drive 's launch and marketing in Australia , as it had done before with the Master System . In Brazil , the Mega Drive was released by Tec Toy in 1990 , only a year after the Brazilian release of the Master System . Tec Toy produced games exclusively for the Brazilian market and began a network service for the system called Sega Meganet in 1995 . In India , Sega entered a distribution deal with Shaw Wallace in Spring 1995 in order to circumvent an 80 % import tariff , with each unit selling for INR ₹ 18 @,@ 000 . Samsung handled sales and distribution in Korea , where it was renamed the " Super Gam * Boy " and retained the Mega Drive logo alongside the Samsung name . It was later renamed " Super Aladdin Boy . " 
 = = = North American sales and marketing = = = 
 For the North American market , former Atari Corporation Entertainment Electronics Division president and new Sega of America CEO Michael Katz instituted a two @-@ part approach to build sales in the region . The first part involved a marketing campaign to challenge Nintendo head @-@ on and emphasize the more arcade @-@ like experience available on the Genesis , summarized by slogans including " Genesis does what <unk> 't " . Since Nintendo owned the console rights to most arcade games of the time , the second part involved creating a library of instantly @-@ recognizable titles which used the names and likenesses of celebrities and athletes such as Pat Riley Basketball , Arnold Palmer Tournament Golf , James ' Buster ' Douglas Knockout Boxing , Joe Montana Football , Tommy Lasorda Baseball , Mario Lemieux Hockey , and Michael Jackson 's Moonwalker . Nonetheless , it had a hard time overcoming Nintendo 's ubiquitous presence in consumers ' homes . Tasked by Nakayama to sell one million units within the first year , Katz and Sega of America managed to sell only 500 @,@ 000 units . 
 In mid @-@ 1990 , Nakayama hired Tom Kalinske to replace Katz as CEO of Sega of America . Although Kalinske initially knew little about the video game market , he surrounded himself with industry @-@ savvy advisors . A believer in the razor and blades business model , he developed a four @-@ point plan : cut the price of the console , create a U.S.-based team to develop games targeted at the American market , continue and expand the aggressive advertising campaigns , and replace the bundled game Altered Beast with a new title , Sonic the Hedgehog . The Japanese board of directors initially disapproved of the plan , but all four points were approved by Nakayama , who told Kalinske , " I hired you to make the decisions for Europe and the Americas , so go ahead and do it . " Magazines praised Sonic as one of the greatest games yet made , and Sega 's console finally took off as customers who had been waiting for the release of the international version of Nintendo 's Super Famicom — dubbed the Super Nintendo Entertainment System or SNES — decided to purchase a Genesis instead . Nintendo 's console debuted against an established competitor , while NEC 's TurboGrafx @-@ 16 failed to gain traction , and NEC soon pulled out of the market . In large part due to the popularity of this game , the Sega Genesis outsold the SNES in the United States nearly two to one during the 1991 holiday season . This success led to Sega having control of 65 % of the 16 @-@ bit console market in January 1992 , making it the first time Nintendo was not the console leader since December 1985 . 
 To compete with Nintendo , Sega was more open to new types of games than its rival , but still tightly controlled the approval process for third @-@ party games and charged high prices for cartridge manufacturing . Technicians from American third @-@ party video game publisher Electronic Arts ( EA ) reverse engineered the Genesis in 1989 , following nearly one year of negotiations with Sega in which EA requested a more liberal licensing agreement than was standard in the industry before releasing its games for the system . The clean room reverse engineering was led by Steve Hayes and Jim <unk> , lasting several months before EA secretly began game development . EA founder Trip Hawkins confronted Nakayama with this information one day prior to the 1990 Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) , noting that EA had the ability to run its own licensing program if Sega refused to meet its demands . Sega relented , and the next day EA 's upcoming Genesis games were showcased at CES . EA signed what Hawkins described as " a very unusual and much more enlightened license agreement " with Sega in June 1990 : " Among other things , we had the right to make as many titles as we wanted . We could approve our own titles ... the royalty rates were a lot more reasonable . We also had more direct control over manufacturing . " After the deal was in place , EA chief creative officer Bing Gordon learned that " we hadn 't figured out all the workarounds " and " Sega still had the ability to lock us out , " noting " It just would have been a public relations fiasco . " EA released its first two Genesis games , Populous and Budokan : The Martial Spirit , within the month . The first Genesis version of EA 's John Madden Football arrived before the end of 1990 , and became what Gordon called a " killer app " for the system . Taking advantage of the licensing agreement , Gordon and EA 's vice president of marketing services Nancy Fong created a visual identifier for EA 's Genesis cartridges : A yellow stripe on their left side added during manufacturing . 
 Sega was able to outsell Nintendo four Christmas seasons in a row due to the Genesis ' head start , a lower price point , and a larger library of games when compared to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System ( SNES ) at its release . Sega had ten games for every game on SNES , and while the SNES had an exclusive version of Final Fight , one of Sega 's internal development teams created Streets of Rage , which had bigger levels , tougher enemies , and a well @-@ regarded soundtrack . ASCII Entertainment reported in spring 1993 that Genesis had 250 titles versus 75 for Super Nintendo , but limited shelf space meant that stores typically offered 100 Genesis and 50 Super Nintendo titles . The NES was still the leader , with 300 titles and 100 on shelves . 
 Sega 's advertising positioned the Genesis as the cooler console , and as its advertising evolved , the company coined the term " blast processing " ( the origin of which is an obscure programming trick on the graphics hardware ) to suggest that its processing capabilities were far greater than those of the SNES . A Sony focus group found that teenage boys would not admit to owning a SNES rather than a Genesis . With the Genesis often outselling the SNES at a ratio of 2 : 1 , Nintendo and Sega both focused heavily on impression management of the market , even going to the point of deception , with Nintendo claiming they had sold more consoles in 1991 than they actually had , and forecasting they would sell 6 million consoles by the end of 1992 , while their actual U.S. install base at the end of 1992 was only just more than 4 million units . Due to these tactics , it was difficult to ascertain a clear leader in market share for several years at a time , with Nintendo 's dollar share of the U.S. 16 @-@ bit market dipping down from 60 % at the end of 1992 to 37 % at the end of 1993 , Sega claiming 55 % of all 16 @-@ bit hardware sales during 1994 , and Donkey Kong Country helping the SNES to outsell the Genesis from 1995 through 1997 . According to a 2004 study of NPD sales data that presents year by year charts through 2001 , the Sega Genesis was able to maintain its lead over the Super NES in the American 16 @-@ bit console market . According to a 2014 Wedbush Securities report based on revised NPD sales data , the SNES outsold the Genesis in the U.S. market . 
 = = = Sonic the Hedgehog = = = 
 While Sega was seeking a flagship series to compete with Nintendo 's Mario series along with a character to serve as a company mascot , several character designs were submitted as part of a company @-@ wide contest , including " an anime @-@ inspired egg and a teal hedgehog with red shoes created by Naoto Oshima that he called Mr. <unk> . " " Mr. <unk> " won the contest and was renamed Sonic the Hedgehog , spawning one of the best @-@ selling video game franchises in history . The gameplay of Sonic the Hedgehog originated with a tech demo created by Yuji Naka , who had developed an algorithm that allowed a sprite to move smoothly on a curve by determining its position with a dot matrix . Naka 's original prototype was a platform game that involved a fast @-@ moving character rolling in a ball through a long winding tube , and this concept was subsequently fleshed out with Oshima 's character design and levels conceived by designer Hirokazu Yasuhara . Sonic 's blue pigmentation was chosen to match Sega 's cobalt blue logo , and his shoes were a concept evolved from a design inspired by Michael Jackson 's boots with the addition of the color red , which was inspired by both Santa Claus and the contrast of those colors on Jackson 's 1987 album Bad ; his personality was based on Bill Clinton 's " can do " attitude . 
 Although Katz and Sega of America 's marketing experts disliked the idea of Sonic , certain that it would not catch on with most American kids , Kalinske 's strategy to place Sonic the Hedgehog as the pack @-@ in title paid off . Featuring speedy gameplay , Sonic the Hedgehog greatly increased the popularity of the Sega Genesis in North America . Bundling Sonic the Hedgehog with the Sega Genesis is credited with helping Sega gain 65 % of the market share against Nintendo . 
 = = = Trademark Security System and Sega v. Accolade = = = 
 After the release of the Sega Genesis in 1989 , video game publisher Accolade began exploring options to release some of their PC game titles onto the console . At the time , Sega had a licensing deal in place for third @-@ party developers that increased the costs to the developer . According to Accolade co @-@ founder Alan Miller , " One pays them between $ 10 and $ 15 per cartridge on top of the real hardware manufacturing costs , so it about doubles the cost of goods to the independent publisher . " To get around licensing , Accolade chose to seek an alternative way to bring their games to the Genesis . They did so by purchasing one in order to <unk> the executable code of three Genesis games . Such information was used to program their new Genesis cartridges in a way that would allow them to disable the security lockouts on the Genesis that prevented unlicensed games from being able to be played . This strategy was used successfully to bring Ishido : The Way of Stones to the Genesis in 1990 . To do so , Accolade had copied Sega 's copyrighted game code multiple times in order to reverse engineer the software of Sega 's licensed Genesis games . 
 As a result of piracy from foreign countries and unlicensed development issues , Sega incorporated a technical protection mechanism into a new edition of the Genesis released in 1990 , referred to as the Genesis III . This new variation of the Genesis included a code known as the Trademark Security System ( TMSS ) , which , when a game cartridge was inserted , would check for the presence of the string " SEGA " at a particular point in the memory contained in the cartridge . If the string was present , the console would run the game , and would briefly display the message : " Produced by or under license from Sega Enterprises , Ltd . " This system had a twofold effect : it added extra protection against unlicensed developers and software piracy , and forced the Sega trademark to display when the game was powered up , making a lawsuit for trademark infringement possible if unlicensed software were to be developed . Accolade learned of this development at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1991 , where Sega showed the new Genesis III and demonstrated it screening and rejecting an Ishido game cartridge . With more games planned for the following year , Accolade successfully identified the TMSS file . They later added this file to the games <unk> ! , Star Control , Mike Ditka Power Football , and Turrican . 
 In response to the creation of these unlicensed games , Sega filed suit against Accolade in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California , on charges of trademark infringement , unfair competition , and copyright infringement . In response , Accolade filed a counterclaim for falsifying the source of its games by displaying the Sega trademark when the game was powered up . Although the district court initially ruled for Sega and issued an injunction preventing Accolade from continuing to reverse engineer the Genesis , Accolade appealed the verdict to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit . 
 As a result of the appeal , the Ninth Circuit overturned the district court 's verdict and ruled that Accolade 's <unk> of the Sega software constituted fair use . The court 's written opinion followed on October 20 , 1992 , and noted that the use of the software was non @-@ exploitative , although commercial . Further , the court found that the trademark infringement , being required by the TMSS for a Genesis game to run on the system , had been inadvertently triggered by a fair use act and the fault of Sega for having caused false labeling . Ultimately , Sega and Accolade settled the case on April 30 , 1993 . As a part of this settlement , Accolade became an official licensee of Sega , and later developed and released Barkley Shut Up and Jam ! while under license . The terms of the licensing , including whether or not any special arrangements or discounts were made to Accolade , were not released to the public . The financial terms of the settlement were also not disclosed , although both companies agreed to pay their own legal costs . 
 = = = Videogame Rating Council and Congressional hearings on video game violence = = = 
 In 1993 , American media began to focus on the mature content of certain video games . Games such as Night Trap for the Sega CD , an add @-@ on , received unprecedented scrutiny . Issues about Night Trap were brought up in the United Kingdom , with former Sega of Europe development director Mike Brogan noting that " Night Trap got Sega an awful lot of publicity ... it was also cited in UK Parliament for being classified as " 15 " due to its use of real actors . This came at a time when Sega was capitalizing on its image as an edgy company with attitude , and this only reinforced that image . The most controversial title of the year by far was Midway 's Mortal Kombat , ported to the Genesis and SNES by Acclaim . In response to public outcry over the game 's graphic violence , Nintendo decided to replace the blood in the game with " sweat " and the arcade 's gruesome " fatalities " with less violent finishing moves . Sega took a different approach , instituting America 's first video game ratings system , the Videogame Rating Council ( VRC ) , for all its current systems . Ratings ranged from the family friendly GA rating to the more mature rating of MA @-@ 13 , and the adults @-@ only rating of MA @-@ 17 . With the rating system in place , Sega released its version of Mortal Kombat , appearing to have removed all the blood and sweat effects and toning down the finishing moves even more than in the SNES version . However , all the arcade 's blood and uncensored finishing moves could be enabled by entering a " Blood Code " . This technicality allowed Sega to release the game with a relatively low MA @-@ 13 rating . Meanwhile , the tamer SNES version shipped without a rating . 
 The Genesis version of Mortal Kombat was well received by gaming press , as well as fans , outselling the SNES version three- or four @-@ to @-@ one , while Nintendo was criticized for censoring the SNES version of the game . Executive vice president of Nintendo of America Howard Lincoln was quick to point out at the hearings that Night Trap had no such rating , saying to Senator Joe Lieberman : 
 In response , Sega of America vice president Bill White showed a videotape of violent video games on the SNES and stressed the importance of rating video games . At the end of the hearing , Lieberman called for another hearing in February 1994 to check on progress toward a rating system for video game violence . 
 As a result of the Congressional hearings , Night Trap started to generate more sales and released ports to the PC , Sega 32X , and 3DO . According to Digital Pictures founder Tom Zito , " You know , I sold 50 @,@ 000 units of Night Trap a week after those hearings . " Although experiencing increased sales , Sega decided to recall Night Trap and rerelease it with revisions in 1994 due to the Congressional hearings . After the close of these hearings , video game manufacturers came together to establish the rating system that Lieberman had called for . Initially , Sega proposed the universal adoption of its system , but after objections by Nintendo and others , Sega took a role in forming a new one . This became the Entertainment Software Rating Board , an independent organization that received praise from Lieberman . With this new rating system in place , Nintendo decided its censorship policies were no longer needed , and the SNES port of Mortal Kombat II was released uncensored . 
 = = = 32 @-@ bit era and beyond = = = 
 In order to extend the life of the Genesis , Sega released two add @-@ ons to increase its capabilities : a CD @-@ based peripheral known as the Sega CD ( Mega @-@ CD outside North America ) , and a 32 @-@ bit peripheral known as the Sega 32X . 2 @.@ 24 million Sega CD units were sold worldwide , and an estimated 665 @,@ 000 32X units were sold by the end of 1994 . 
 Following the launch of the next @-@ generation 32 @-@ bit Sony PlayStation and the Sega Saturn , sales of 16 @-@ bit hardware and software continued to account for 64 % of the video game market in 1995 . Sega underestimated the continued popularity of the Genesis and did not have the inventory to meet demand for the product . Sega was able to capture 43 % of the dollar share of the U.S. video game market and claimed to have sold more than 2 million Genesis units in 1995 , while Genesis software such as <unk> remained highly successful , but Kalinske estimated that " we could have sold another 300 @,@ 000 Genesis systems in the November / December timeframe . " Nakayama 's decision to focus on the Saturn over the Genesis , based on the systems ' relative performance in Japan , has been cited as the major contributing factor in this miscalculation . By contrast , Nintendo concentrated on the 16 @-@ bit home console market , as well as its successful handheld , the Game Boy . As a result , Nintendo took in 42 % of the video game market dollar share , without launching a 32 @-@ bit console to compete directly with the PlayStation or the Saturn . Following tensions with Sega Enterprises , Ltd. over its focus on the Saturn , Kalinske , who oversaw the rise of the Genesis in 1991 , grew uninterested in the business and resigned in mid @-@ 1996 . 
 Sega sold 30 @.@ 75 million Genesis units worldwide . Of these , 3 @.@ 58 million were sold in Japan , and sales in Europe and the U.S. are roughly estimated at 8 million and 18 million as of June 1997 ( at which time Sega was no longer manufacturing the system ) respectively . In 1998 , Sega licensed the Genesis to Majesco in North America so it could rerelease the console . Majesco began reselling millions of formerly unsold cartridges at a budget price , together with 150 @,@ 000 units of the second model of the Genesis . It released the Sega Genesis 3 , projecting to sell 1 @.@ 5 million units of the console by the end of 1998 . An estimated 3 million Genesis units were sold by Tec Toy in Brazil .

 The main microprocessor is a 16 / 32 @-@ bit Motorola 68000 CPU clocked at 7 @.@ 6 MHz . The console uses a Zilog Z80 sub @-@ processor , mainly used to control the sound hardware and provide backwards compatibility with the Master System . The system has 72 kB of RAM , 64 kB of video RAM , and can display up to 61 colors at once from a palette of 512 . The games are in ROM cartridge format and inserted in the top . 
 The system produces sound using a Yamaha <unk> FM synthesizer and a Texas Instruments SN76489 PSG ; the latter is integrated with the Video Display Processor ( VDP ) . The Z80 processor is primarily used to control both sound chips to produce stereo music and sound effects . Most revisions of the original system contain a discrete <unk> and a separate <unk> VDP ; the functionality of these two chips was later integrated into a single custom ASIC ( <unk> ) for the model 2 and later revisions . 
 The back of the model 1 console provides a radio frequency output port ( designed for use with antenna and cable systems ) and a specialized 8 @-@ pin DIN port , both of which provide video and audio output . Both outputs produce monophonic sound ; a headphone jack on the front of the console produces stereo sound . On the model 2 , the DIN port , radio frequency output port , and headphone jack are replaced by a 9 @-@ pin mini @-@ DIN port on the back for composite video , RGB and stereo sound , and the standard RF switch . Earlier model 1 consoles have a 9 @-@ pin extension port , although this was removed in later production runs and is absent in the model 2 . An edge connector on the bottom @-@ right of the console allows it to be connected to a peripheral . 
 = = = Peripherals = = = 
 The standard controller features a rounded shape , a directional pad , three main buttons , and a " start " button . Sega later released a six @-@ button version in 1993 . This pad is slightly smaller and features three additional face buttons , similar to the design of buttons on some popular arcade fighting games such as Street Fighter II . Sega released a wireless revision of the six @-@ button controller , the Remote Arcade Pad . 
 The system is backwards compatible with the Master System . The first peripheral released , the Power Base Converter ( Master System Converter in Europe ) , allows Master System games to be played . A second model , the Master System Converter 2 , was released only in Europe for use with the Mega Drive II . 
 Other peripherals were released to add functionality . The Menacer is a wireless , infrared light gun peripheral used with compatible games . Other third parties created light gun peripherals for the Genesis , such as the American Laser Games Pistol and the Konami Justifier . Released for art creation software , the Sega Mega Mouse features three buttons and is only compatible with a few games , such as Eye of the Beholder . A foam @-@ covered bat called the <unk> and the <unk> golf club were released for both the Genesis and SNES . 
 In November 1993 , Sega released the Sega Activator , an octagonal device that lies flat on the floor and translates the player 's physical movements into game inputs . Several high @-@ profile games , including Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter II : Special Champion Edition , were adapted to support the peripheral . The device was a commercial failure , due mainly to its inaccuracy and its high price point . IGN editor Craig Harris ranked the Sega Activator the third worst video game controller ever made . 
 Both EA and Sega released <unk> to allow more than the standard two players to play at once . Initially , EA 's version , the 4 Way Play , and Sega 's adapter , the Team Player , only supported each publisher 's titles . In response to complaints about this , Sega publicly stated that " We have been working hard to resolve this problem since we learned of it " and that a new Team Player which would work with all multitap games for the console would be released shortly . Later games were created to work on both the 4 Way Play and Team Player . Codemasters also developed the J @-@ Cart system , providing two extra ports on the cartridge itself , although the technology came late in the console 's life and is only featured on a few games . Sega planned to release a steering wheel peripheral in 1994 , and the Genesis version of Virtua Racing was advertised as being " steering wheel compatible , " but the peripheral was cancelled . 
 = = = Network services = = = 
 In its first foray into online gaming , Sega created Sega Meganet , which debuted in Japan on November 3 , 1990 . Operating through a cartridge and a peripheral called the " Mega Modem , " this allowed Mega Drive players to play seventeen games online . A North American version dubbed " Tele @-@ Genesis , " was announced but never released . Another phone @-@ based system , the Mega Anser , turned the Japanese Mega Drive into an online banking terminal . 
 In 1994 , Sega started the Sega Channel , a game distribution system using cable television services Time Warner Cable and TCI . Using a special peripheral , Genesis players could download a title from a library of fifty each month , and demos for upcoming games . Games were downloaded to internal memory and deleted when the console was powered off . The Sega Channel reached 250 @,@ 000 subscribers at its peak and ran until July 31 , 1998 , well past the release of the Sega Saturn . 
 In an effort to compete with Sega , third @-@ party developer Catapult Entertainment created the XBAND , a peripheral which allowed Genesis players to engage in online competitive gaming . Using telephone services to share data , XBAND was initially offered in five U.S. cities in November 1994 . The following year , the service was extended to the SNES , and Catapult teamed up with Blockbuster Video to market the service , but as interest in the service waned , it was discontinued in April 1997 . 
 = = Game library = = 
 The Genesis library was initially modest , but eventually grew to contain games to appeal to all types of players . The initial pack @-@ in title was Altered Beast , which was later replaced with Sonic the Hedgehog in 1991 . Top sellers included Sonic the Hedgehog , its sequel Sonic the Hedgehog 2 , and Disney 's Aladdin . During development for the console , Sega Enterprises focused on developing action games , while Sega of America was tasked with developing sports games . A large part of the appeal of the Genesis library during the console 's lifetime was the arcade @-@ based experience of its games , as well as more difficult entries such as Ecco the Dolphin , and sports games such as Joe Montana Football . Compared to its competition , Sega advertised to an older audience by hosting more mature games , including the uncensored version of Mortal Kombat . 
 As Sega was a prolific arcade developer in the 1980s , early Genesis games included arcade ports such as Altered Beast , Golden Axe , and Super Hang @-@ On . Console teams would develop titles in acclaimed series such as Castle of Illusion , Phantasy Star , Shinobi , and Streets of Rage . Alex Kidd was the mascot of Sega 's previous console , but he would not receive any Mega Drive sequels after Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle due to Sega of America wanting to replace him with the titular character from Sonic the Hedgehog as mascot . The Sonic the Hedgehog series was a big hit both commercially and critically , with the original game being the best selling game on the system . Sega of America would also help set up Sega Technical Institute and Sega Interactive , who worked on titles such as Comix Zone and Eternal Champions respectively in an attempt to appeal more to western audiences . 
 In addition to games developed by Sega 's internal studios , Sega would collaborate with various other developers to publish more games for the system . These developers include Ancient ( Beyond Oasis ) , BlueSky Software ( <unk> ) , Camelot ( Shining Force ) , Climax Entertainment ( Landstalker ) , Johnson Voorsanger Productions ( ToeJam & Earl ) , <unk> International ( Ecco the Dolphin ) , Technopop ( Zero Tolerance ) , Treasure ( Gunstar Heroes ) , Vic Tokai ( <unk> Attack ) , and Virgin Games ( Disney 's Aladdin ) . 
 Initially , the Genesis suffered from limited third @-@ party support due to its low market share and Nintendo 's monopolizes practices . Notably , the arcade hit Street Fighter II by Capcom initially skipped the Genesis , instead only being released on the SNES . However , as the Genesis continued to grow in popularity , Capcom eventually ported a version of Street Fighter II to the system known as Street Fighter II ′ : Champion Edition , that would go on to sell over a million copies . One of the biggest third @-@ party companies to support the Genesis early on was Electronic Arts . Trip Hawkins , founder and then president of EA , believed the Genesis faster drawing speed made it more suitable for sport games than the SNES , and credits EA 's success on the Genesis for helping catapult the EA Sports brand . Another third @-@ party blockbuster for the system was the port of the original Mortal Kombat game . Although the arcade game was released on the SNES and Genesis simultaneously , the two ports were not identical . The SNES version looked more identical to the arcade game , but the Genesis version allowed players to bypass censorship , helping make it the more popular port . Ed Boon , co @-@ creator of the Mortal Kombat franchise , compared the two versions , stating that the SNES version did not play as well the Genesis version . 
 = = = Sega Virtua Processor = = = 
 In order to produce more visually appealing graphics , companies began adding special processing chips to their cartridges to effectively increase the console 's capabilities . On the SNES , these are several DSP chips and RISC processors , which allows the console to produce faster and more accurate 3D and pseudo @-@ 3D graphics . In particular , the Super FX chip was designed to offload complex rendering tasks from the main CPU , enabling it to produce visual effects that the console cannot produce on its own . The chip was first used in Star Fox , which renders 3D polygons in real time , and Super Mario World 2 : Yoshi 's Island demonstrated the ability to rotate , scale , and stretch individual sprites and manipulate large areas of the screen . 
 As these enhancements became more commonplace on the Super NES , the stock of existing Genesis games began to look outdated in comparison . Sega began work on an enhancement chip to compete with the Super FX , resulting in the Sega Virtua Processor . This chip enables the Genesis to render polygons in real time and provides an " Axis Transformation " unit that handles scaling and rotation . Virtua Racing , the only game released with this chip , runs at a significantly higher and more stable frame rate than similar games on the SNES . The chip was expensive to produce , and increased the cost of the games that used it . At US $ 100 , Virtua Racing was the most expensive Genesis cartridge ever produced . Two other games , Virtua Fighter and Daytona USA , were planned for the SVP chip , but were instead moved into the Saturn 's launch line @-@ up . There were plans to sell the SVP chip as a separate upgrade module for the Genesis , but this module was never released .

 In addition to accessories such as the Power Base Converter , the Sega Genesis supports two add @-@ ons that each support their own game libraries . The first is the Sega CD ( known as the Mega @-@ CD in all regions except for North America ) , a compact disc @-@ based peripheral that can play its library of games in CD @-@ ROM format . The second is the Sega 32X , a 32 @-@ bit peripheral which uses ROM cartridges and serves as a pass @-@ through for Genesis games . Sega produced a custom power strip to fit the peripherals ' large AC adapters . Both add @-@ ons were officially discontinued in 1996 . 
 = = = Sega CD = = = 
 By 1991 , compact discs had gained in popularity as a data storage device for music and software . PCs and video game companies had started to make use of this technology . NEC had been the first to include CD technology in a game console with the release of the TurboGrafx @-@ CD add @-@ on , and Nintendo was making plans to develop its own CD peripheral as well . Seeing the opportunity to gain an advantage over its rivals , Sega partnered with JVC to develop a CD @-@ ROM add @-@ on for the Genesis . Sega launched the Mega @-@ CD in Japan on December 1 , 1991 , initially retailing at JP ¥ 49 @,@ 800 . The CD add @-@ on was launched in North America on October 15 , 1992 , as the Sega CD , with a retail price of US $ 299 ; it was released in Europe as the Mega @-@ CD in 1993 . 
 In addition to greatly expanding the potential size of its games , this add @-@ on unit upgraded the graphics and sound capabilities by adding a second , more powerful processor , more system memory , and hardware @-@ based scaling and rotation similar to that found in Sega 's arcade games . It provided battery @-@ backed storage RAM to allow games to save high scores , configuration data , and game progress ; an additional data storage cartridge was sold separately . 
 Shortly after its launch in North America , Sega began shipping the Sega CD with the pack @-@ in game Sewer Shark , a full motion video ( FMV ) game developed by Digital Pictures , a company that became an important partner for Sega . <unk> the benefits of the CD 's comparatively vast storage space , Sega and its third @-@ party developers produced a number of games for the add @-@ on that include digital video in their gameplay or as bonus content , as well as <unk> several cartridge @-@ based games with high @-@ fidelity audio tracks . In 1993 , Sega released the Sega CD 2 , a smaller and lighter version of the add @-@ on designed for the Genesis II , at a reduced price compared to the original . A limited number of games were later developed that use both the Sega CD and the Sega 32X add @-@ ons . 
 The Mega @-@ CD sold only 100 @,@ 000 units during its first year in Japan , falling well below expectations . Although many consumers blamed the add @-@ on 's high launch price , it also suffered from a tiny software library ; only two titles being available at launch . This was due in part to the long delay before Sega made its software development kit available to third @-@ party developers . Sales were more successful in North America and Europe , although the novelty of FMV and CD @-@ enhanced games quickly wore off as many of the system 's later games were met with lukewarm or negative reviews . In 1995 , Sega announced a shift in focus to its new console , the Saturn , and discontinued all advertising for Genesis hardware , including the Sega CD . The add @-@ on sold 2 @.@ 24 million units worldwide .

 With the release of the Sega Saturn slated for 1995 , Sega began to develop a stop @-@ gap solution that would bridge the gap between the Genesis and the Saturn , and would serve as a less expensive entry into the 32 @-@ bit era . 
 At the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1994 , Sega of America research and development head Joe Miller took a phone call from Nakayama , in which Nakayama stressed the importance of coming up with a quick response to the Atari Jaguar . One potential idea for this came from a concept from Sega Enterprises , later known as " Project Jupiter , " an entirely new independent console . Project Jupiter was initially slated to be a new version of the Genesis , with an upgraded color palette and a lower cost than the upcoming Saturn , as well as with some limited 3D capabilities thanks to integration of ideas from the development of the Sega Virtua Processor chip . Miller suggested an alternative strategy , citing concerns with releasing a new console with no previous design specifications within six to nine months . At the suggestion from Miller and his team , Sega designed the 32X as a peripheral for the existing Genesis , expanding its power with two 32 @-@ bit SuperH @-@ 2 processors . The SH @-@ 2 had been developed in 1993 as a joint venture between Sega and Japanese electronics company Hitachi . At the end of the Consumer Electronics show , with the basic design of the 32X in place , Sega Enterprises invited Sega of America to assist in development of the new add @-@ on . 
 Although the new unit was a stronger console than originally proposed , it was not compatible with Saturn games . Before the 32X could be launched , the release date of the Saturn was announced for November 1994 in Japan , coinciding with the 32X 's target launch date in North America . Sega of America now was faced with trying to market the 32X with the Saturn 's Japan release occurring simultaneously . Their answer was to call the 32X a " transitional device " between the Genesis and the Saturn . This was justified by Sega 's statement that both platforms would run at the same time , and that the 32X would be aimed at players who could not afford the more expensive Saturn . 
 The 32X was released in November 1994 , in time for the holiday season . Demand among retailers was high , and Sega could not keep up orders for the system . More than 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 orders had been placed for 32X units , but Sega had only managed to ship 600 @,@ 000 units by January 1995 . Launching at about the same price as a Genesis console , the price of the 32X was less than half of what the Saturn 's price would be at launch . Notwithstanding the lower priced console 's positioning as an inexpensive entry into 32 @-@ bit gaming , Sega had a difficult time convincing third @-@ party developers to create games for the new system . After an early run on the peripheral , news soon spread to the public of the upcoming release of the Sega Saturn , which would not support the 32X 's games . The Saturn was released early on May 11 , 1995 , four months earlier than its originally intended release date of September 2 , 1995 . The Saturn , in turn , caused developers to further shy away from the console and created doubt about the library for the 32X , even with Sega 's assurances that there would be a large number of games developed for the system . In early 1996 , Sega conceded that they had promised too much out of the 32X and decided to stop producing the system in order to focus on the Saturn . Prices for the 32X dropped to $ 99 and cleared out of stores at $ 19 @.@ 95 .

 More than a dozen licensed variations of the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive have been released .

 In 1993 , Sega introduced a smaller , lighter version of the console , naming it the Genesis II in North America and the Mega Drive II everywhere else . This version omits the headphone jack in the front , replaces the A / V @-@ Out connector with a smaller version that supports stereo sound , and provides a simpler , less expensive <unk> that requires less power . 
 Sega released a combined , semi @-@ portable Genesis / Sega CD unit called the Genesis CDX ( marketed as the Multi @-@ Mega in Europe ) . This unit retailed at $ 399 @.@ 95 in the US ( roughly $ 100 more than the individual Genesis and Sega CD units put together , since the Sega CD dropped its price to $ 229 half a year before ) , and was bundled with Sonic the Hedgehog CD , Sega Classics Arcade Collection , and the Sega CD version of Ecco the Dolphin . It is incompatible with some games and cannot work with the Sega 32X due to overheating and electrical shock issues . The CDX features a small LCD screen that , when the unit is used to play audio CDs , displays the current track being played . With this feature and the system 's lightweight build ( weighing two pounds ) , Sega marketed it in part as a portable CD player . 
 Late in the 16 @-@ bit era , Sega released a handheld version of the Genesis called the Genesis Nomad . Its design was based on the Mega Jet , a Mega Drive portable unit featured on airplane flights in Japan . As the only successor to the Game Gear , the Nomad operates on 6 AA batteries , displaying its graphics on a 3 @.@ 25 @-@ inch ( 8 @.@ 25 @-@ mm ) LCD screen . The Nomad supports the entire Genesis library , but cannot be used with the Sega 32X , the Sega CD , or the Power Base Converter . 
 Exclusive to the Japanese market was the <unk> , a Mega Drive combined with a computer . Sega produced three arcade system boards based on the Mega Drive : the System C @-@ 2 , the MegaTech , and the <unk> , which support approximately 80 games combined .

 Working with Sega Enterprises , JVC released the Wondermega on April 1 , 1992 , in Japan . The system was later redesigned by JVC and released as the X <unk> in North America in September 1994 . Designed by JVC to be a Genesis and Sega CD combination with high quality audio , the Wondermega 's high price ( $ 500 at launch ) kept it out of the hands of average consumers . The same was true of the Pioneer LaserActive , which requires an add @-@ on known as the Mega @-@ LD pack , developed by Sega , in order to play Genesis and Sega CD games . Although the LaserActive was lined up to compete with the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer , the combined price of the system and the Mega @-@ LD pack made it a prohibitively expensive option for Sega players . Aiwa released the CSD @-@ GM1 , a combination Genesis / Sega CD unit built into a boombox . Several companies added the Mega Drive to personal computers , mimicking the design of Sega 's <unk> ; these include the MSX models AX @-@ 330 and AX @-@ 990 , distributed in Kuwait and Yemen , and the Amstrad Mega PC , distributed in Europe and Australia . 
 After the Genesis was discontinued , Majesco Entertainment released the Genesis 3 as a budget version in 1998 . In 2009 , AtGames began producing two new variations : the <unk> , which can play original Genesis cartridges as well as preloaded games , and a handheld console preloaded with 20 Genesis games . Companies such as Radica Games have released various compilations of Genesis and Mega Drive games in " plug @-@ and @-@ play " packages resembling the system 's controller .

 A number of Genesis and Mega Drive emulators have been produced , including <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and Gens . The GameTap subscription gaming service included a Sega Genesis emulator and had several dozen licensed Genesis games in its catalog . The Console <unk> subscription gaming service includes an emulator and has several hundred Sega Genesis games in its catalog . In addition to emulation , a number of Sega Genesis games have been released on compilation discs for other video game consoles . These include Sonic Mega Collection and Sonic Gems Collection for PS2 , Xbox , and Nintendo GameCube ; Sega Genesis Collection for PS2 and PSP , and most recently Sonic 's Ultimate Genesis Collection ( known as the Sega Mega Drive Ultimate Collection in PAL territories ) for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 . 
 During his keynote speech at the 2006 Game Developers Conference , Nintendo president Satoru Iwata announced that Sega was going to make a number of Genesis / Mega Drive titles available to download on the Wii 's Virtual Console . These games are available along with other systems ' titles under the Wii 's Virtual Console . There are select Sega Genesis titles available on the Xbox 360 through Xbox Live Arcade , such as Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic 2 , as well as games available via the PlayStation Network and Steam .

 The Sega Genesis has often been considered among the best video game consoles ever produced . In 2009 , IGN named it the fifth best video game console , citing its edge in sports games and better home version of Mortal Kombat , and lauding " what some consider to be the greatest controller ever created : the six button . " In 2007 , GameTrailers named the Sega Genesis as the sixth best console of all time in their list of top ten consoles that " left their mark on the history of gaming , " noting its great games and solid controller , and writing of the " glory days " of Sonic the Hedgehog . In January 2008 , technology columnist Don <unk> proclaimed that the Sega Genesis " created the industry 's best console war to date , " citing Sonic the Hedgehog , superior sports games , and backwards compatibility with the Sega Master System . <unk> also gave the Sega Genesis sixth place in 2008 , declaring " one can truly see the Genesis for the gaming milestone it was . " At the same time , GameDaily rated it ninth of ten for its memorable games . In 2014 , USgamer 's Jeremy Parish wrote that " If the Atari generation introduced video games as a short @-@ lived ' 70s fad ... and the NES generation established it into an enduring obsession for the young , Sega 's Genesis began pushing the medium toward something resembling its contemporary form " , expounding that the system served as " the key incubator for modern sports franchises " , made " consoles truly international " by providing Western third @-@ parties previously put at a disadvantage by Nintendo 's restrictive licensing policies with a more profitable alternative , created " an online subscription service " that foreshadowed " PlayStation Plus more than 15 years early " with the Sega Channel , and " played a key role in ensuring the vitality and future of the games industry by breaking Nintendo 's near @-@ monopolistic hold on the U.S. and awakening the U.K. to the merits of television gaming . " For his part , Kalinske highlighted Sega 's role in developing games for an older demographic and pioneering " the concept of the ' street date ' " with the simultaneous North American and European release of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 . John <unk> of Retro Gamer noted " It was a system where the allure was born not only of the hardware and games , but the magazines , playground arguments , climate , and politics of the time . " 
 = Shivers ( song ) = 
 " Shivers " is a song by the Australian post @-@ punk band the Boys Next Door , who would later become the Birthday Party . It is the tenth and final track from the band 's debut studio album Door , Door , released in 1979 on Mushroom Records . It was released as the album 's only single in May 1979 , backed with the B @-@ side " Dive Position " . 
 Written by guitarist Rowland S Howard at age 16 , " Shivers " is a post @-@ punk and new wave ballad featuring ironic lyrics regarding teenage relationships and suicide . Originally intended as humorous by Howard , he felt later it had been misinterpreted due to frontman Nick Cave 's vocal delivery on the Boys Next Door version . Despite later distancing himself from the song , " Shivers " remained Howard 's most requested song during his lifetime and was met with critical acclaim . It has since been cited as one of the most popular cult hits in Australian music . 
 Several versions of " Shivers " have been released — including demo and solo recordings by Howard — and it has been covered by a variety of artists , including Marie Hoy , Laura Jane Grace , the Screaming Jets , Courtney Barnett and Divine Fits . 
 = = Origin and recording = = 
 In 1976 , at age 16 and as a member of the Melbourne punk rock band Young Charlatans , Howard wrote " Shivers " . Discussing the song 's origins , Howard said that " Shivers " was " intended as an ironic comment on the way that I felt that people I knew were making hysterical things out of what were essentially high school crushes " . He further explained that the emotional responses of people he knew who were in relationships seemed " incredibly insincere and blown out of proportion " and inspired the cynical lyrics of the song . 
 Howard composed " Shivers " on an Ibanez Gibson Firebird copy , an electric guitar on which he performed on the first known recording of the song . Recorded as part of a series of demos for the Young Charlatans in 1978 , it featured Howard on vocals and guitar , Ollie Olsen on guitar , Janine Hall on bass and Jeff Wegener on drums . 
 During sessions for Door , Door at Richmond Recorders in Melbourne in January 1979 , the Boys Next Door recorded " Shivers " . Engineer Tony Cohen suggested that Howard perform the vocals for the track , arguing that his voice was best fitted for his own songs . However , the band 's regular vocalist , Nick Cave , insisted on singing on the recording . Howard said later that as a result of Cave 's vocals , " Shivers " was " interpreted completely differently and now the song , to most peoples ' minds , is something completely different from what I intended it to be " . In hindsight , Cave noted that Howard 's vocals should have been recorded , as Cave was " never able to do that song justice " . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 " Shivers " is a post @-@ punk ballad featuring new wave elements , with a length of four minutes and thirty @-@ seven seconds . It is set in common time ( 44 ) and has a slow tempo of 60 beats per minute . The song is composed in the key of A major and on the Boys Next Door version , Nick Cave 's vocal range spans one octave from D4 to E5 . 
 Howard wrote intentionally cynical lyrics to " Shivers " regarding relationships and suicide . According to Kelsey Munro of the Sydney Morning Herald , the song " exhibits Howard 's enduring gallows humour in its wry treatment of the overwrought protagonist " . The first lyrics " I 've been contemplating suicide / but it really doesn 't suit my style " have been also branded by the Sydney Morning Herald 's Jake Wilson as " famous opening lines " and typical of Howard 's " wry , guarded romanticism " . 
 According to members of the Boys Next Door , Howard 's songwriting was " more precious and stolid " than Cave 's or guitarist – keyboardist Mick Harvey 's attempts , with " Shivers " and his other songs generally being centred " around a bassline " . The final version of " Shivers " featured on Door , Door reflected this , and included only a two @-@ chord progression and four musical instruments : guitar , bass , piano and violin . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 " Shivers " was originally released by the Young Charlatans as part of a Fast Forward cassette compilation , which was issued in April 1981 after the band 's dissolution . It was rereleased on CD on the various artists compilation album Inner City Sound : Australian Punk & Post @-@ Punk ( 2006 ) . The Boys Next Door version was released as Door , Door 's only single in May 1979 on Mushroom Records . It was issued as a 7 @-@ inch single , backed with " Dive Position " . The single soon went out of print , and a second pressing was issued later the same year . The band changed their name to the Birthday Party after relocating to London , England in 1980 and all of their recordings of " Shivers " are credited to the Boys Next Door . 
 " Shivers " received critical acclaim and became a major underground success in Australia , bringing more national attention to the band . Nick Cave cited it in hindsight as the main reason for the Boys Next Door 's eminence . In a retrospective review for AllMusic , critic Will Lerner wrote that " it 's impressive how , even at this early stage , Nick Cave was a confident and unique singer , perfectly aware of the strengths and limitations of his voice … he knows how to come across in a scary and theatrical manner that perfectly complements the music . Nowhere is this more apparent than on … ' Shivers ' , an unashamedly melodramatic example of post @-@ adolescent anguish " . " Shivers " , along with other songs Howard composed , were " crucial to guiding the band in the darker , wilder direction " that defined the Birthday Party 's music , according to Dan Lawrence of Stereogum . The song has since been considered an Australian classic and labelled by ABC Television as " possibly Australia 's most enduring cult hit " . 
 A music video for " Shivers " was directed by Paul Goldman in 1979 . It is featured on Pleasure Heads Must Burn ( 1984 ) , a video album released by the Birthday Party . 
 = = Live performances = = 
 " Shivers " was first performed at Young Charlatans concerts in the late 1970s , of which there were only 13 during the band 's career . In 1978 , prior to the recording of Door , Door , the Boys Next Door performed " Shivers " with Howard on vocals and Cave on guitar . After the song 's release , and changing their name to the Birthday Party , the band performed " Shivers " with their standard line @-@ up of Cave on vocals , Howard and Mick Harvey on guitar , Tracy Pew on bass and Phill Calvert on drums . Cave commented that he " used to dread ' Shivers ' coming up in the set " due to the fact " it required a certain amount of efficiency [ and ] certain amount of talent to sing " because it was one of the band 's only melodic songs . 
 During Howard 's solo concerts from 1983 to 1999 , " Shivers " was the song most requested by audience members . However , by the time of his final tour in 2009 — the year he died — he had stopped receiving requests for it . In an October 2009 interview , Howard commented on his relationship with the song , and its position in his setlists , stating : " I have just tried , perhaps finally successfully , to divorce myself from the song . It 's impossible for me to recreate what I was trying to do when I wrote that song so whilst I can see that people have an attachment to it , I don 't . I feel like , when I did use to do it in shows , I was doing a cover of some song that had been around forever . That 's how it felt . And I guess that is a strange way to feel about a song you wrote , so yeah , I am happy to not have to do it these days " .

 Since its original release , " Shivers " has been covered by several artists . A live version recorded in Melbourne in 1982 by the Big Bang Combo was issued on volume 13 of the cassette magazine Fast Forward in October of that year .

In 1992 pub rock band the Screaming Jets featured a cover version of " Shivers " on their second studio album , Tear of Thought . It was subsequently released as a single in February 1993 and spent 15 weeks on the Australian Singles Chart , peaking at number 19 in its fourth week .

 = Lytes Cary = 
 Lytes Cary is a manor house with associated chapel and gardens near Charlton Mackrell and Somerton in Somerset , England . The property , owned by the National Trust , has parts dating to the 14th century , with other sections dating to the 15th , 16th , 18th , and 20th centuries . " Yet all parts blend to perfection with one another and with the gentle sunny landscape that surrounds them , " comments Nikolaus Pevsner . The House is listed as Grade I by English Heritage . 
 The chapel predates the existing house , having been built around 1343 , and functioned as a chantry chapel , where masses could be said for the souls of the family , both living and dead . The great hall was added in the 15th century and the Oriel Room in the 16th . Various renovations were undertaken during the 16th and 17th centuries after which the house fell into disrepair with the north range being demolished by the early 19th century . In 1907 Sir Walter Jenner of the Jenner baronets bought the house and restored it in a period style , furnishing it with fine 17th century and 18th century oak furniture , antique tapestries and fabrics modelled after medieval textiles , along with historic and period paintings . On his death in 1948 he left the house to the National Trust . 
 The gardens are listed as Grade II on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England . The original 17th @-@ century gardens have disappeared . However , the Jenners laid them out in an Arts and Crafts style with a series of ' rooms ' , which are separated from each other by high , neatly clipped box and yew hedges . These are complemented by ponds and walks in and between each of the ' rooms ' . 
 = = History = = 
 The parkland surrounding the house includes the site of a deserted medieval settlement which is a scheduled monument . 
 The unusual name derives from the Lyte family who lived at Lytes Cary for over four centuries , and the River Cary which flows nearby . The first documentary evidence is from 1285 when it was known as Kari . William le Lyte was a feudal tenant of the estate in 1286 , and the Lyte family occupied and added to the house until the mid 18th century . The earliest surviving part of the manor and associated buildings is the chapel , which dates to the mid @-@ 14th century . 
 The Great Hall was built in the mid @-@ 15th century , and in the early 16th century the entrance porch and oriel room was added to the eastern side of the hall , and the great parlour and little parlour to the south of the hall , with bedrooms above . Sometime after the Lyte family sold the Manor in 1755 , tenants moved in and the house gradually fell into disrepair . In 1810 it was reported by a neighbour that the north range ' had lately been destroyed and a farm house built on the site ' , ( this north range is dated by architectural historians to the late 18th century ) and by the time John Buckler came to draw the house in 1835 the west range had also disappeared . 
 In 1907 Sir Walter Jenner of the Jenner baronets and son of the late Sir William Jenner , physician to Queen Victoria , bought Lytes Cary . At that time the Great Hall was being used as a cider store and the Great Parlour was full of farm equipment . Jenner 's brother Leopold had just bought and started to restore Avebury Manor in Wiltshire , and Jenner was inspired by his brother 's work there . He set about restoring Lytes Cary and decorating the interiors in period style , including fine 17th century and 18th century oak furniture , antique tapestries and fabrics modelled after medieval textiles . He had the west range rebuilt in a plain William and Mary style by the architect C.E. Ponting , but left the historic core of the house mostly untouched . It incorporates carvings believed to be from the demolished St Benet <unk> . 
 Jenner left the manor to the National Trust after he died in 1948 . The house was designated as a Grade I listed building in 1959 . The National Trust opened the west range as a holiday rental property in 2006 . Only the older parts of the house are open to the public .

 The two @-@ storey house and the chapel are built of the local Blue Lias stone .

 = = = Chapel = = = 
 The chapel predates the existing house , and functioned as a chantry chapel , where masses could be said for the souls of the family , both living and dead . It was built by Peter Lyte in about 1343 , and was completed by 1358 , and would have served both the original manor which now no longer survives and later the existing house . It has a small window , or squint , that permitted servants and others to observe communion from the house . 
 The chapel was thoroughly renovated in 1631 by Thomas Lyte , who installed the arch @-@ braced @-@ collar truss roof , the communion rail , a rear screen and a frieze below the roof painted with the arms of the Lytes and their relations . A monument to the south of the altar records Thomas ' work on the chapel . In 1912 Sir Walter Jenner added the stained glass , including medieval glass said to have come from Charlton Mackrell church which William Le Lyte had commissioned before his death in 1316 . 
 = = = Great Hall = = = 
 This structure was built in the mid @-@ 15th century . At the southern end is a shallow raised dais on which the Lytes and favoured guests would have sat at a long table , facing the rest of the hall where the servants would have dined . The roof has arch @-@ braced @-@ collar trusses , with double purlins , and cusped curved <unk> . Typical of West Country design , these carved <unk> are both decorative and practical . Beneath is a cornice of pierced quatrefoils , and at the base of each main rafter is a carved wooden angel with a shield with the Lyte arms . The fireplace is 15th century , while the windows and the stained glass in them date from the early 16th century . The hall is entered from the east front porch via the screens passage , which would have divided the Hall from the kitchen and servants quarters ' which would have lain to the left of the hall . The screen and gallery are not original , having been inserted by Sir Walter Jenner in 1907 . He based the decoration on that of the arch from the Great Hall through to the Oriel Room . At the time of Jenner 's arrival in 1907 the Great Hall was being used as a cider store . 
 The Great Hall is furnished with mostly 17th century oak furniture , including tables , coffers and wainscot chairs , and a great dining table , on which stand two blue and white late 17th century Delftware pyramidal tulip vases . One treasure of the home is the Lytes Herbal , a 16th @-@ century botanical volume by noted horticulturist Henry Lyte , who was born and resided at the manor . Lyte 's Niewe Herball was published in 1578 and was a translation and elaboration of the <unk> of Flemish herbalist Rembert Dodoens . The herbal was dedicated to Queen Elizabeth . A copy is displayed in the Great Hall . 
 = = = Oriel Room = = = 
 This was added to the south of the Great Hall in the early 16th century to provide a small intimate room where the family could eat in private away from the servants . Above it is the small Oriel Bedroom , probably originally a dressing room for the Great Chamber as its only entrance is via that room . At the same time that the oriel room and bedroom were added , rooms were added or remodeled to the south of the Great Hall : the Great Parlour with Great Chamber above , and the Little Parlour with Little Parlour above . John Lyte , the builder , placed his coat of arms on the outside of the building . 
 = = = Great Parlour = = = 
 This was the main family sitting room on the ground floor , with the south @-@ facing grand window giving views to the gardens , and was remodelled by John Lyte in 1533 . In the early 17th century Thomas Lyte added the wood paneling ( including Ionic pilasters ) and the internal porch : these decorative features also had the practical benefit of keeping out the drafts . In the 20th century the room was being used as a store for farm equipment . Sir Walter Jenner had the paint stripped from the panelling to reveal the original warm @-@ coloured oak . 
 Above is the Great Chamber , an impressive room with a barrel ceiling with geometrical plaster decoration featuring John Lyte 's arms and those of his wife , Edith Horsey . This ceiling is a rare survival . The wall above the bed displays the royal coat of arms and Tudor roses , signifying Lyte 's loyalty to King Henry VIII ( whose government Lyte represented in Somerset ) . The panelling is 17th century , as are the great four poster bed and the tapestries on the walls . Some of the original oak panelling of the room may have been used in the construction of the canopy of the bed .

 This smaller room may have been used by Henry and Thomas Lyte for their studies . It too has later paneling and an alcove in which are displayed a collection of early glassware . Above this room is the Little Chamber , used by Sir Walter Jenner as his bedroom . The bed came from Burton Pynsent House in Somerset , a house given to William Pitt the Elder by an admirer of his achievements as prime minister . 
 = = = Paintings = = = 
 Sir Walter Jenner furnished the rooms with furniture and included historic and newly commissioned paintings . The paintings include : portraits of Lady Catherine Neville by Robert Peake James Scott , 1st Duke of Monmouth and Mary II of England by Sir Peter Lely and William III of England by Godfrey Kneller , along with landscapes by Jan Wyck and Jack Green . Oil paintings of horses by George Denholm Armour and George Richard Pain are also included in the extensive collection .

 All trace of Henry Lyte 's garden has disappeared .

Grapes , 3 severall <unk> . Cherries , 1 . Walnuts , 3 . Peaches , 1 . " By the Victorian period the garden had run to seed , and so the Jenners had to start from scratch on their arrival in 1907 . They had the gardens designed and constructed to include a series of hedged and walled " rooms " with topiary , specimen trees , a pool , statuary , croquet lawn , walkways , an Elizabethan orchard , and a herbal border that includes plants described in the Lytes Herbal . The gate piers at the east and west entrances are listed buildings . 
 The gardens were constructed in a series of ' rooms ' , which are separated from each other by high , neatly clipped box and yew hedges . The gardens were influenced by the Arts and Crafts style popular at the time . The Jenners had a garden staff of four . 
 In 1965 Graham Stuart Thomas , the National Trust 's first Gardens Adviser designed the Main Border . From 1955 @-@ 1997 the Trust 's tenants at the Manor , Biddy and Jeremy Chittenden , transformed the garden , and Biddy rethought and replanted the main border in 1996 , using new plants but following Stuart Thomas 's colour scheme . 
 The gardens are listed as Grade II on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England . A barn and other outbuildings north west of the house are listed buildings . 
 The Apostle garden is aligned on the front door in the East front of the house and a building which has been described as a water tower , built by the Jenners in imitation of the dovecote at Avebury Manor , which was wrongly identified as a Dovecote by English Heritage . The garden is a severe , formal approach , flanked by <unk> yews , and is " deliberately low @-@ key and simple so as not to distract from the beauty of the building " . The main border is 35 metres ( 114 @.@ 8 ft ) long and at its best in midsummer . The flowers grade from blues and yellows , through creams and apricots to pinks , <unk> and reds .

 The song 's music video was directed by Joseph Kahn . Kahn , who also directed the video for Brown and Ester Dean 's " Drop It Low " , said that Brown played him tracks from his album on the set , and had a clear idea of what he wanted for the " I Can Transform Ya " video . Kahn said , 
 " ... obviously , him going in there and dancing and turning into cars and trucks is right up my alley . His interests , in terms of kung fu and special effects and science fiction and all the boy @-@ culture stuff , it falls directly in line with what I like . " His talent is phenomenal . I 'm still struggling to try and capture that talent on film , and it 's a challenge . Here 's a guy who can literally do anything .

I would say it 's like a pure aesthetic dance video from the very fiber of it . Everything dances onscreen . Everything has movement . Everything has a certain mechanical rhythm . He actually created a dance style for this that is mechanical . It 's sort of a hyper @-@ intense version of the robot . Even the transformations go directly in line with the movements . " 
 Kahn also said that instead of taking the song 's lyrics and being " pretentious " about it , he wanted to show the audience exactly what Brown was singing about , commenting , " What if we just got ambitious and demonstrated the lyrics ? The trick is to do it in a creative way . Let 's try to display the lyrics and the feeling of the dance at the same time . " On October 2009 , Brown released <unk> for the video , coincidentally the same day Rihanna released her video for " Russian Roulette " .

 The Time Machine is a steel roller coaster which is currently in @-@ storage at Ocean Park in Vietnam . Previously located at Freestyle Music Park in Myrtle Beach , South Carolina , the ride was manufactured by the Swiss company Bolliger & Mabillard , opened to the public on April 15 , 2008 under the name Led Zeppelin – The Ride as part of Hard Rock Park . Due to financial problems , Hard Rock Park was sold and renamed after one year . The new owners closed the park in 2009 , and it is still closed to this day . 
 = = History = = 
 Plans for a Hard Rock @-@ themed amusement park were released in 2003 ; at the time , however , funding and licensing agreements had yet to be finalized . By 2006 , a licensing agreement with the Hard Rock franchise was reached . Hard Rock Park was announced in early 2007 . The park 's flagship attraction , " Led Zeppelin – The Ride " , would be a Bolliger & Mabillard sit @-@ down roller coaster themed for the English rock band of the same name . By July 2007 construction for the ride was underway , with the lift hill completed . 
 " Led Zeppelin – The Ride " soft @-@ opened to the public on April 15 , 2008 , with the first seats auctioned for charity . The ride 's official opening was on May 9 , 2008 . During operation , the coaster would play Led Zeppelin 's " Whole Lotta Love " through an on @-@ board audio system . In September 2008 , Hard Rock Park filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy due to the inability to pay its debts . Its owners later filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 , allowing them to sell the park . 
 In February 2009 , FPI MB Entertainment purchased the park . As part of the acquisition it was renamed Freestyle Music Park , with all licensed themes removed . " Led Zeppelin – The Ride " was renamed " The Time Machine " , with the on @-@ board audio a selection of songs from the 1960s to the 2000s . The new park officially opened on May 23 , 2009 ; however , the fate of Freestyle Music Park was similar to that of its predecessor and the park closed in September 2009 . As of 2013 the park and its rides remain standing , but not operating . 
 According to Screamscape , on August 21 , 2014 , cranes had been set up next to the Time Machine to begin the process of dismantling , and elements of the finale had already been removed . 
 In 2016 , the ride will operate at Ocean Park in Vietnam .

 = The Deal ( Seinfeld ) = 
 " The Deal " is the ninth episode of the second season of NBC 's Seinfeld , and the show 's 14th episode overall . The episode centers on protagonists Jerry ( Jerry Seinfeld ) and Elaine Benes ( Julia Louis @-@ Dreyfus ) who decide to have a purely physical relationship , with a set of ground rules . However , as their " relationship " progresses , they experience difficulties maintaining their original friendship . 
 Series co @-@ creator Larry David wrote the episode in a response to NBC 's continued efforts to get the two characters back together . The main inspiration behind the episode was a similar agreement David once made with a woman . The episode , which introduced the character of Tina , Elaine 's roommate , first aired on May 2 , 1991 and was watched by approximately 22 @.@ 6 million viewers . Critics reacted positively to the episode , and David received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series . 
 = = Plot = = 
 As they are watching TV in Jerry 's apartment , Jerry and Elaine flip through the channels , stumbling upon the soft @-@ core pornography channel . Upon the realization that neither of them has had sexual relations in a while , they start toying with the idea of sleeping together . They refer to their friendship as " this " and sexual intercourse as " that " . However , as they do not wish to ruin their friendship , they establish a set of ground rules . Happy with their agreement , they make their way to the bedroom . The next day Jerry has lunch with his friend George Costanza ( Jason Alexander ) , and makes him aware of his situation with Elaine . George remains skeptical , even after Jerry explains the rules system to him . He is proven right when Jerry and Elaine get into an argument over the second rule : " Spending the night is optional " . Jerry eventually does not spend the night , leaving their agreement on shaky terms . 
 With Elaine 's birthday coming up Jerry has to decide on what to get her . Since they are not in a relationship but they are still having sex he feels that the symbolism of the gift needs to be carefully thought out . He looks for a gift with George but is unable to think of anything , though he vaguely remembers her saying " something about a bench " . Elaine is unhappy with the eventual gift : $ 182 cash . When Jerry 's neighbor Kramer ( Michael Richards ) gives Elaine the bench she was looking for , for which she is much more grateful , she and Jerry talk over their agreement . They decide to start dating . When Kramer sees them again and asks what they are up to , Jerry notes that they now do " this , that and the other , " " the other " being their romantic relationship as a couple .

 Series co @-@ creator Larry David wrote the episode , which was directed by Tom Cherones . Since the start of the show , NBC executives , especially Warren Littlefield , had been pressuring the writing staff to get Jerry and Elaine back together . Larry David had been against this idea from the start . However , brainstorming for an episode idea , he remembered he had once made a deal with a woman to have a purely physical relationship , which he thought " would make a really funny show , even if they had never [ told us to get Jerry and Elaine back together ] " . Though Jerry and Elaine are still in a relationship at the end of the episode , they are no longer together by the end of the season . Seinfeld and David decided that they had satisfied the NBC executives and went back to the original format . Seinfeld and David have also noted that " The Deal " is the only Seinfeld episode ever to contain sincere emotions , during the scene in which Jerry and Elaine discuss the ending of their physical relationship . 
 On February 25 , 1991 , the table @-@ read of the episode was held , subsequent filming occurred at CBS Studio Center in Studio City , Los Angeles , California three days later . " The Deal " is the first episode in which Elaine 's apartment is shown . During rehearsals controversy arose over how Jerry and Elaine would sit during their " this and that " conversation . Several producers believed that , as the scene was intimate , the two should sit close together . David , however , believed the discussion was more of a transaction than an intimate scene and felt that Jerry and Elaine should sit further apart . On audio commentary recorded for the Seinfeld : Volume 1 DVD set , David commented that when he showed his idea of the scene , " I remember everybody saying ' there 's no heat , there 's no heat ' , and I said , that 's the point , there 's not supposed to be any " . David and producer Andrew Scheinman got into a big argument over the issue , which David eventually won . 
 Aside from showing Elaine 's apartment for the first time , " The Deal " also marks the first appearance of Elaine 's roommate Tina , who had been mentioned in earlier episodes . Siobhan Fallon was cast in the role ; she would reprise the character two more times , in season three 's " The Truth " and in the season five finale " The Opposite " . Norman Brenner , who worked as Richards ' stand @-@ in on the show for all its nine seasons , appears as an extra , working in the store George and Jerry visit to look for a gift for Elaine .

David received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series , but lost the award to Gary <unk> and Steven Peterman , writers of the Murphy Brown episode " Jingle Hell , Jingle Hell , Jingle All the Way " . 
 Critics reacted positively to the episode . Eric Kohanik of The Hamilton Spectator called " The Deal " a " hilarious episode " . Entertainment Weekly critics Mike Flaherty and Mary Kaye Schilling commented " Jerry and Elaine 's circuitous verbal dance pondering the relative worth of that [ sex ] versus this [ the friendship ] is sublime . The show 's ability to be both explicit and vague will become a hallmark . " 
 = Siege of Varaždin Barracks = 
 The Siege of Varaždin Barracks , also referred to locally as Varaždin 's Days of War ( Croatian : <unk> dani rata ) , was the blockade and capture of the Yugoslav People 's Army ( JNA ) barracks and other facilities in and around the city of Varaždin during the Croatian War of Independence . The blockade began on 14 September 1991 , quickly escalated into fighting , and ended on 22 September with the surrender of the JNA garrison . It was part of the Battle of the Barracks — an effort by Croatian armed forces to isolate JNA units based at barracks in Croatia , or capture the barracks to provide arms for Croatia 's nascent army . 
 The besieging force outnumbered the JNA garrison in Varaždin , which was divided among several barracks , storage depots and other facilities , but the JNA possessed substantially greater firepower . The balance shifted in favour of the Croatian forces after smaller JNA posts were captured in the first few days of the siege , until only one barracks along with the headquarters of the JNA 32nd Corps remained under JNA control . At that point , the commander of the 32nd Corps , Major General Vladimir Trifunović , and the civilian authorities in Varaždin agreed that the remaining JNA forces in the city would surrender , but all those wishing to leave would be permitted to do so , leaving their weapons behind . 
 The capture of the 32nd Corps ' weapons was the most significant achievement of the Battle of the Barracks , and greatly augmented the capabilities of the Croatian military . After he left Croatia , Trifunović was indicted for war crimes by Croatia , tried in absentia and convicted for the combat deaths of six Croatian soldiers and the wounding of dozens of Croatian citizens before and during the siege . He was also prosecuted by Yugoslav authorities for treason , but subsequently pardoned . In 2013 , he requested a re @-@ trial on his Croatian war crimes conviction .

 In 1990 , ethnic tensions between Serbs and Croats worsened after the electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia by the Croatian Democratic Union ( Croatian : Hrvatska demokratska zajednica – HDZ ) . The Yugoslav People 's Army ( Serbian : Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA ) confiscated Croatia 's Territorial Defence ( Croatian : Teritorijalna obrana – TO ) weapons to minimize resistance . On 17 August , the tensions escalated into an open revolt of the Croatian Serbs , centred on the predominantly Serb @-@ populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin ( approximately 60 kilometres ( 37 miles ) north @-@ east of Split ) , parts of the Lika , Kordun , Banovina and eastern Croatia . In January 1991 , Serbia , supported by Montenegro and Serbia 's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo , unsuccessfully tried to obtain the Yugoslav Presidency 's approval for a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces . The request was denied and a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March prompted the JNA itself to ask the Federal Presidency to give it wartime authority and declare a state of emergency . Even though the request was backed by Serbia and its allies , the JNA request was refused on 15 March . Serbian President Slobodan Milošević , preferring a campaign to expand Serbia rather than to preserve Yugoslavia with Croatia as a federal unit , publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the federal Presidency . The threat caused the JNA to abandon plans to preserve Yugoslavia in favour of expansion of Serbia as the JNA came under Milošević 's control . By the end of March , the conflict had escalated with the first fatalities . In early April , leaders of the Serb revolt in Croatia declared their intention to amalgamate the areas under their control with Serbia . These were viewed by the Government of Croatia as breakaway regions . 
 At the beginning of 1991 , Croatia had no regular army . To bolster its defence , Croatia doubled its police numbers to about 20 @,@ 000 . The most effective part of the Croatian police force was 3 @,@ 000 @-@ strong special police comprising twelve battalions organised along military lines . There were also 9 @,@ 000 – 10 @,@ 000 regionally organised reserve police in 16 battalions and 10 companies , but they lacked weapons . In response to the deteriorating situation , the Croatian government established the Croatian National Guard ( Croatian : Zbor narodne garde – ZNG ) in May by expanding the special police battalions into four all @-@ professional guards brigades . Under Ministry of Defence control and commanded by retired JNA General Martin Špegelj , the four guards brigades comprised approximately 8 @,@ 000 troops . The reserve police , also expanded to 40 @,@ 000 , was attached to the ZNG and reorganised into 19 brigades and 14 independent battalions . The guards brigades were the only units of the ZNG that were fully equipped with small arms ; throughout the ZNG there was a lack of heavier weapons and there was poor command and control structure above the brigade level . The shortage of heavy weapons was so severe that the ZNG resorted to using World War II weapons taken from museums and film studios . At the time , the Croatian weapon stockpile consisted of 30 @,@ 000 small arms purchased abroad and 15 @,@ 000 previously owned by the police . To replace the personnel lost to the guards brigades , a new 10 @,@ 000 @-@ strong special police was established . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 The views of the Croatian leadership on how to deal with the JNA 's role in the Croatian Serb revolt gradually evolved between January and September 1991 . Croatian President Franjo Tuđman 's initial plan was to win European Community ( EC ) and United States support ; so he dismissed advice to seize JNA barracks and storage facilities in the country . This course of action was first advocated by Špegelj in late 1990 ; he again urged Tuđman to act while the JNA fought Slovenia 's TO in the Ten @-@ Day War in June – July 1991 . Špegelj 's calls were echoed by Šime Đodan , who succeeded Špegelj as Defence Minister in July . Špegelj remained in command of the ZNG . 
 Tuđman 's initial stance was based on his belief that Croatia could not win a war against the JNA . The ZNG was therefore limited to defensive operations , even though the actions of the JNA appeared to be coordinated with Croatian Serb forces . This impression was reinforced by buffer zones established by the JNA after fighting between Croatian Serb militia and the ZNG . The JNA often intervened after the ZNG had lost territory , leaving the Croatian Serbs in control of areas they had captured before the JNA stepped in . The JNA provided some weapons to the Croatian Serbs , although most of their weaponry was sourced from Serbia 's TO and the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs . 
 In July 1991 , Špegelj and Đodan 's advice was supported by a number of Croatian Parliament members . In response , Tuđman dismissed Đodan the same month he was appointed Defence Minister , and Špegelj resigned his command of the ZNG on 3 August . The deteriorating situation in eastern Croatia , including the JNA expulsion of ZNG troops from Baranja , intermittent fighting around Osijek , Vukovar and Vinkovci , increasing losses and the growing conviction that the JNA were actively supporting the Croatian Serb revolt , forced Tuđman to act . On 22 August , he issued an ultimatum to the federal Yugoslav authorities demanding the withdrawal of the JNA to its barracks by the end of the month . The ultimatum stated that if the JNA failed to comply , Croatia would consider it an army of occupation and take corresponding action . On 1 September , the EC proposed a ceasefire and a peace conference was accepted by the Yugoslav Presidency and by Tuđman , despite his earlier ultimatum . The conference started on 7 September , but only four days later , the Croatian member and chair of the presidency , Stjepan Mesić , ordered the JNA to return to its barracks within 48 hours . This order was motivated by Tuđman 's concern that the conference would drag on while the ZNG lost territory . Even though the order was opposed by other members of the presidency , it gave Croatia justification to openly confront the JNA . 
 Prime Minister Franjo Gregurić advised Tuđman to implement Špegelj 's plan . According to General Anton Tus , Tuđman ordered the ZNG to capture JNA barracks on 12 September , but rescinded the order the next day . The order was reinstated on 14 September after Tus pleaded with Tuđman to re @-@ authorize action , arguing that the ZNG was running out of time . The same day , the ZNG and the Croatian police blockaded and cut utilities to all JNA facilities it had access to , beginning the Battle of the Barracks . This action comprised blockades of 33 large JNA garrisons in Croatia , and numerous smaller facilities , including border posts , and weapons and ammunition storage depots .

 Varaždin was the garrison of the JNA 32nd Corps commanded by Major General Vladimir Trifunović . In addition to the Corps headquarters there were several other JNA facilities in and around the city . The most substantial of these were located in Varaždin itself – the <unk> <unk> barracks where Colonel <unk> Popov 's 32nd Mechanised Brigade was based , and the Jalkovečke žrtve barracks of the 32nd Mixed Artillery Regiment , commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Vladimir <unk> . The Corps ' area of responsibility extended beyond Varaždin and its immediate surroundings , where further significant combat units were based . The most significant among them were the 32nd Engineer Regiment in Čakovec , the 411th Mixed Antitank Artillery Regiment based in Križevci , the 73rd Motorised Brigade headquartered in Koprivnica , the 265th Mechanised Brigade based in Bjelovar , and the 288th Mixed Antitank Artillery Brigade in Virovitica . In Varaždin itself , the JNA units included approximately 1 @,@ 000 troops , making the JNA garrison of Varaždin the second largest in Croatia . Despite this , the JNA did not have sufficient number of troops in the area to secure all its facilities . 
 Croatian forces in and around Varaždin and nearby Čakovec consisted of 640 ZNG troops ( including 60 who had been deployed from Zagreb ) , 100 police , 300 People 's Protection ( Narodna <unk> ) troops and several hundred armed civilians . The ZNG troops were subordinated to the 104th Brigade and to the 5th Battalion of the 1st Guards Brigade – but were lightly armed . Besides small arms , they had only 17 mortars , two <unk> Malyutka anti @-@ tank guided missile systems , two 12 @.@ 7 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 50 in ) anti @-@ aircraft machine guns and four armoured personnel carriers . Initially , command of Croatian forces in the city was not unified and Colonel Želimir Škarec of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia only had a coordination role .

 A blockade of the JNA facilities in and around Varaždin was ordered on 13 September 1991 , which took effect the next day when utilities and access to the barracks were cut . In response , the Corps command informed Croatian forces that they could no longer guarantee peace unless utilities were restored and JNA military vehicles were allowed to move freely . On 15 September , the Corps began preparing for the demolition of all minor military facilities which could not be defended . At the same time , negotiations began between the Corps command and civilian authorities in Varaždin . At 15 : 30 , the Yugoslav Air Force attacked the Varaždin Airfield . The strike was intended to disrupt flights of Antonov An @-@ 2 agricultural aircraft converted to carry 1 @.@ 5 tonnes ( 1 @.@ 5 long tons ; 1 @.@ 7 short tons ) of cargo — transporting weapons from the Hungarian town of Nagykanizsa . The attacking force comprised two planes sortied from Željava Air Base , which broke the sound barrier above Varaždin to produce a sonic boom and bombed the airfield . One bomb destroyed an An @-@ 2 on the ground and damaged the runway , while the second landed in a nearby field . 
 Between 16 : 50 and 17 : 07 , there was an exchange of small arms fire between the JNA troops in the Corps headquarters and a nearby police checkpoint , and at 17 : 35 a mortar attack was launched by the 32nd Mechanised Brigade . The mortar fire targeted the police station and surrounding buildings , and an electrical substation in the nearby village of <unk> . The civilian authorities in Varaždin promptly notified the European Community Monitoring Mission of damage to the city . By 16 September , the JNA artillery bombardment of the city had extended to various street intersections and approaches to the Drava bridge on the Varaždin – Čakovec road . The latter was counter @-@ battery fire , targeting ZNG mortars which fired approximately 150 bombs against the JNA during the entire operation . By the end of 16 September , 42 JNA officers and soldiers had deserted from the 32nd Mechanised Brigade . The JNA ordered its border guards posted along the Hungarian border from Čakovec to Ludbreg to lay land mines around their facilities , then cross into Hungary and surrender to that country 's authorities . 
 = = = Peak of the fighting = = = 
 On 17 September , the commander of the 104th Brigade , Colonel Ivan <unk> , took command of all Croatian forces in Varaždin . The Yugoslav Air Force attacked an airfield in Čakovec , mimicking the strike carried out in Varaždin a few days earlier . That evening , the heaviest fighting of the siege erupted in Varaždin , and the 104th Brigade reported it was uncertain how long it would be able to maintain the blockades . Croatian forces received additional weapons that day , after the JNA garrisons in Čakovec , Križevci and Virovitica surrendered to the ZNG . In Varaždin itself , corps @-@ level units of the JNA 32nd Corps based at the 15 @.@ <unk> barracks also surrendered to the ZNG that day . The following day , fighting intensified again , as Croatian forces captured several minor JNA facilities in Varaždin itself — leaving the Corps headquarters , the <unk> <unk> barracks and the Jalkovečke žrtve barracks as the only JNA @-@ held military bases in the city . In the course of this fighting , the ZNG suffered one fatality and captured nine JNA officers and 30 soldiers . 
 On 19 September , Croatian forces managed to interdict radio communications between the 32nd Mechanised Brigade artillery and its artillery observers , and set up their own transmitter to direct JNA artillery fire against the Jalkovečke žrtve barracks . This deception was designed to deceive <unk> into thinking that the ZNG had much greater firepower than it did . The plan worked and when ZNG troops entered the barracks compound that day , the 32nd Mixed Artillery Regiment ( four officers and 196 soldiers ) surrendered . Late in the evening of 19 September , Croatian police and elements of the 3rd Battalion of the 104th Brigade secured the <unk> weapons storage facility located in the village of <unk> near Varaždin , after its JNA commander surrendered the facility and its garrison of 60 without resistance . The capture of JNA weapons greatly improved the Croatian position in negotiations when trying to convince JNA commanding officers of the 32nd Corps to surrender . 
 = = = Surrender of the JNA garrison = = = 
 The blockade continued for two more days , with continuing clashes between Croatian and JNA troops . On 21 September , the 32nd Corps found itself in a difficult position . It reported that it could not continue to resist as its weapons and ammunition storage facilities had been lost , and all the barracks had been captured except the base of the 32nd Mechanised Brigade . Furthermore , it noted that there was a possibility that the remaining troops might desert en masse . According to Trifunović , he notified Colonel General Života Avramović , his immediate superior and commander of the 5th Military District , of his intention to surrender . Avramović then told Trifunović to do as he saw fit . A Croatian ultimatum was issued early on 22 September , demanding the surrender of JNA troops in the city , and offering its personnel the chance to leave Croatia " honourably " . Trifunović accepted the Croatian terms at 11 : 00 . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 One JNA officer and one non @-@ commissioned officer were killed during the fighting , and 15 JNA troops were wounded . Croatian forces sustained losses of two killed and 24 wounded . Two civilians were also killed . Approximately 1 @,@ 000 JNA officers and soldiers surrendered to the ZNG . The officers and their families living in Varaždin , as well as approximately 450 soldiers who wanted to leave Croatia were transported to Serbia in a convoy comprising twelve buses and several passenger cars . The convoy was provided with a police escort and two representatives of the civilian authorities in Varaždin accompanied the convoy as hostages to guarantee its safe passage . One of the hostages was Radimir Čačić , who became Deputy Prime Minister of Croatia 20 years later . 
 The ZNG captured 74 T @-@ 55 tanks , approximately ten special @-@ purpose vehicles ( such as PT @-@ 76 amphibious light tanks ) , armoured recovery vehicles , and armoured vehicle @-@ launched bridges , 48 BVP M @-@ 80 infantry fighting vehicles , 18 self @-@ propelled anti @-@ aircraft weapons , six <unk> <unk> self @-@ propelled howitzers , six M @-@ 63 Plamen and four M @-@ 77 <unk> multiple rocket launchers , eighteen 155 @-@ millimetre ( 6 @.@ 1 in ) and twelve 152 @-@ millimetre ( 6 @.@ 0 in ) guns with towing vehicles , approximately 180 artillery pieces below 100 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) calibre , several batteries of 60 @-@ millimetre ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) , 82 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 2 in ) and 120 @-@ millimetre ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) mortars , 25 @,@ 000 small arms , 250 vehicles and pieces of engineering equipment , a large stock of communication equipment and several hundred thousand tonnes of ammunition . Some of the weapons had been disabled on Trifunović 's orders shortly before the surrender . The captured weapons were distributed to units deployed in eastern Slavonia , Lika and Dalmatia , and were also used to equip new ZNG units . 
 When the last JNA @-@ held barracks and the 32nd Corps headquarters surrendered , only two major JNA bases remained in the area of responsibility of the Corps — Bjelovar and Koprivnica . The JNA 's Bjelovar garrison was captured by the ZNG a week later , while its barracks in Koprivnica surrendered a day after that . The capture of the JNA barracks in and around Varaždin , and particularly the storage facilities of the 32nd Corps was very significant for development of Croatian military . The capture of the barracks is celebrated annually in Varaždin , and is locally referred to as " Varaždin 's Days of War " ( <unk> dani rata ) . 
 War crimes charges were brought against Trifunović in Croatia , where he was indicted for the combat deaths of six Croatian soldiers in and around Varaždin , and the wounding of a further 37 individuals ( both soldiers and civilians ) . After a trial in absentia , he was found guilty and in 1991 he was sentenced to 15 years in prison . In 1994 , Trifunović was charged with treason by Yugoslav authorities for surrendering the entire JNA 32nd Corps to the ZNG . He was convicted and sentenced to 11 years in prison . In early 1996 , he was pardoned and released , and the Yugoslav authorities paid him € 62 @,@ 000 compensation for spending nearly two years in prison . In 2013 , Trifunović formally requested re @-@ trial in Croatia . 
 = Happy Chandler = 
 Albert Benjamin " Happy " Chandler , Sr. ( July 14 , 1898 – June 15 , 1991 ) was an American politician from the U.S. state of Kentucky . He represented the state in the U.S. Senate and served as its 44th and 49th governor . Aside from his political positions , he also served as the second Commissioner of Baseball from 1945 to 1951 and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982 . His grandson , Ben Chandler , later served as congressman for Kentucky 's Sixth District . 
 A multi @-@ sport athlete during his college days at Transylvania College , Chandler briefly considered a career in professional baseball before deciding to pursue a law degree . After graduation , he entered politics and was elected as a Democrat to the Kentucky Senate in 1928 . Two years , later , he was elected lieutenant governor , serving under Governor Ruby Laffoon . Chandler and Laffoon disagreed on the issue of instituting a state sales tax and when Chandler , the presiding officer in the state senate , worked to block the legislation , Laffoon 's allies in the General Assembly stripped him of many of his statutory powers . The tax then passed by a narrow margin . Knowing that Laffoon would try to select his own successor at the Democratic nominating convention , Chandler waited until Laffoon left the state — leaving Chandler as acting governor — and called the legislature into session to enact a mandatory primary election bill . The bill passed , and in the ensuing primary , Chandler defeated Laffoon 's choice , Thomas Rhea . He then went on to defeat Republican King Swope by the largest margin of victory for a Kentucky gubernatorial race to that time . As governor , Chandler oversaw the repeal of the sales tax , replacing the lost revenue with new excise taxes and the state 's first income tax . He also enacted a major reorganization of state government , realizing significant savings for the state . He used these savings to pay off the state debt and improve the state 's education and transportation systems . 
 Convinced that he was destined to become President of the United States , Chandler challenged Senate Majority Leader Alben Barkley for his U.S. Senate seat in 1938 . During the campaign , President Franklin D. Roosevelt came to the state to campaign for Barkley , and Chandler lost a close race . The following year , Kentucky 's other senator , Marvel Mills Logan , died in office , and Chandler resigned as governor so his successor could appoint him to the vacant seat . A fiscal conservative and disciple of Virginia 's Harry F. Byrd , Chandler opposed parts of Roosevelt 's New Deal and openly disagreed with the president 's decision to prioritize European operations in World War II over the war in the Pacific . In 1945 , Chandler resigned his senate seat to succeed the late Kenesaw Mountain Landis as commissioner of baseball . His most significant action as commissioner was the approval of Jackie Robinson 's contract with the Brooklyn Dodgers , effectively integrating Major League Baseball . He also established the first pension fund for Major League players , earning him the title " the players ' commissioner " . Baseball owners were upset with Chandler 's governance , however , and did not renew his contract in 1951 . 
 Following his term as commissioner , Chandler returned to Kentucky and won a second term as governor in 1955 . The major accomplishments of his second term were enforcing the integration of the state 's public schools and establishing a medical school at the University of Kentucky which was later named the Chandler Medical Center in his honor . Following his second term as governor , his political influence began to wane as he made three more unsuccessful runs for governor in 1963 , 1967 , and 1971 . His endorsement of dark @-@ horse candidate Wallace G. Wilkinson was seen as critical to Wilkinson 's successful gubernatorial campaign in 1988 . Wilkinson later resisted calls to remove Chandler from the University of Kentucky board of trustees following Chandler 's use of a racial epithet during a board meeting in 1988 . Chandler died June 15 , 1991 , a month before his ninety @-@ third birthday . At the time of his death , he was the oldest living former Kentucky governor . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Albert Benjamin Chandler was born in the farming community of Corydon , Kentucky in 1898 . He was the eldest child of Joseph <unk> and Callie ( Saunders ) Chandler . Chandler 's father allegedly rescued his mother from an orphanage and married her when she was fifteen , though no record of their marriage has ever been found . In 1899 , Chandler 's brother Robert was born . Two years later , their mother , still in her teens and unable to cope with raising two young children , abandoned the family . She fled the state and left her sons with their father . In his autobiography , Chandler said his mother leaving them was his earliest memory . Years later , he sought his mother and found her living in Jacksonville , Florida . She had married again and he had three half @-@ siblings . His full brother , Robert Chandler , died when he fell from a cherry tree when he was 13 years old . 
 Chandler was raised by his father and relatives , and by age eight virtually supported himself financially from his paper route and doing odd jobs in his community . In 1917 he graduated from Corydon High School , where he had been captain of the baseball and football teams . His father wanted him to study for the ministry , but Chandler instead entered Transylvania College ( now Transylvania University ) in Lexington , Kentucky . It was there that he received his lifelong nickname " Happy " because of his jovial nature . He paid for his education by doing chores for the local citizens . Chandler was captain of Transylvania 's basketball and baseball teams and the quarterback of the football team . He was a teammate of Dutch Meyer , a future member of the College Football Hall of Fame . He also joined the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity and the Omicron Delta Kappa honor society . In 1918 , during World War I , the United States Army started a Student Officers ' Training Corps at Transylvania , and Chandler began training to be an officer ; the war ended before he was called to active duty . 
 In 1920 , Chandler pitched a no @-@ hitter for Grafton , North Dakota 's team in the Red River Valley League . He attended a professional baseball tryout in Saskatoon , but did not make the team . He returned to Transylvania and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in June 1921 . He then signed with the Class D baseball team the Lexington Reds , where he was a teammate of future Hall of Famer Earle Combs . Briefly considering a career in baseball , he finally decided to study law . He entered Harvard Law School that same year , paying his way by coaching high school sports in Wellesley , Massachusetts . His former teammate Charlie Moran , then coaching the Centre College Praying Colonels football team in Danville , Kentucky , asked him to scout the national powerhouse Harvard Crimson , an upcoming opponent for Centre . Chandler took copious notes for Moran , and Centre defeated Harvard 6 – 0 in what is considered one of the greatest college football upsets of all time . 
 After a year , Chandler was not able to afford Harvard . He returned to Kentucky and continued at the University of Kentucky College of Law , coaching high school sports in Versailles and served as the head coach of the women 's basketball at the University of Kentucky in 1923 . He was an assistant coach and scout for Charlie Moran at Centre , and coached the freshman football team there . A member of the Order of the Coif , he received his Bachelor of Laws degree in 1924 . He was admitted to the bar the following year and opened his law practice in Versailles . 
 On November 12 , 1925 , Chandler married Mildred Watkins , a teacher at the Margaret Hall School for Girls . They would have four children : Marcella , Mildred ( " Mimi " ) , Albert , Jr . , and Joseph Daniel . Mimi Chandler played one of the four singing sisters in the 1944 film And the Angels Sing , appearing with Dorothy Lamour , Betty Hutton , and Diana Lynn before abandoning acting and working for the Kentucky Department of Tourism . 
 For the next five years , Chandler simultaneously practiced law , coached high school sports , and served as a scout for Centre . He joined numerous fraternal organizations including the Freemasons , Shriners , Knights Templar , Forty and Eight , and Optimist International . 
 = = Early political career = = 
 Chandler entered politics when he was named chairman of the Woodford County Democratic Committee . In 1928 , he was appointed master commissioner of the Woodford County circuit court . The following year , he was elected as a Democrat to represent the Twenty @-@ second district in the Kentucky Senate . As a member of the Senate , he was part of a Democratic coalition that passed legislation to strip Republican Governor Flem D. Sampson of many of his statutory powers . 
 As the 1931 gubernatorial election approached , Chandler and Prestonsburg native Jack Howard were mentioned as candidates for lieutenant governor . Congressman Fred M. Vinson backed Howard , a fellow Eastern Kentuckian , while political bosses Billy <unk> , Johnson N. Camden , Jr . , and Ben Johnson supported Chandler . The support of another political boss , Mickey Brennan , gave Chandler the edge at the party 's nominating convention . Democratic gubernatorial nominee Ruby Laffoon also owed his selection to the machinations of the state 's political bosses , notably his uncle , Congressman Polk Laffoon . Problematically , Chandler was an ally of former Governor J. C. W. Beckham , Louisville Courier @-@ Journal publisher Robert Worth Bingham , and political boss Percy Haly , which put him at odds with Laffoon , a member of a Democratic faction headed by Russellville political boss Thomas Rhea and opposed to Beckham , Worth , and Haly . Despite disharmony within the ticket , the worsening of the Great Depression under Republican President Herbert Hoover and Governor Sampson ensured a Democratic victory . Chandler was elected over John C. <unk> by a vote of 426 @,@ 247 to 353 @,@ 573 . In a break with precedent , Chandler set up an office on the executive floor of the state capitol and worked there full @-@ time ; previous lieutenant governors had stayed in Frankfort only during legislative sessions , when they were charged with presiding over the state senate . 
 Shortly after their election , the divide between Chandler and Laffoon widened over the issue of implementing a state sales tax . Laffoon favored the tax ; Chandler opposed it . As presiding officer of the state senate , Chandler worked with Speaker of the House John Y. Brown , Sr. to block passage of the tax . In retaliation , Laffoon 's allies in the General Assembly stripped Chandler of some of his statutory power as lieutenant governor , after which they were able to pass the tax by a single vote in each house of the legislature . 
 Free from any constitutional duties during the time between sessions , Chandler had begun laying the groundwork to succeed Laffoon as governor almost from the beginning of his term as lieutenant governor . Laffoon , however , had made it clear that he favored Thomas Rhea to be his successor . Rhea secured the services of rising political boss Earle C. Clements as his campaign manager . Hailing from Morganfield , only a short distance from Chandler 's hometown of Corydon , Clements later said that if Chandler had asked him first , he might have managed Chandler 's campaign instead of Rhea 's . Instead , by virtue of managing the opposing campaign , Clements became the leader of a Democratic faction that opposed Chandler for the next three decades . 
 Chandler feared Laffoon , who controlled the State Democratic Central Committee , would attempt to hand @-@ select the Democratic gubernatorial nominee by calling a nominating convention instead of holding a primary election , and he used a bold move to circumvent Laffoon 's ability to carry out such an action . Under the Kentucky Constitution , Chandler became acting governor any time Laffoon left the state . When Laffoon traveled to meet with President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Washington , D. C. on February 6 , 1935 , Chandler used his authority to call the legislature into session to consider a bill requiring that each party 's gubernatorial candidates be chosen by a primary rather than a nominating convention . Laffoon returned to the state the next day and challenged Chandler 's authority to make the call , but Chandler 's actions were validated by the Kentucky Court of Appeals on February 26 . 
 Laffoon knew the primary bill would be widely supported in the General Assembly , since both legislators and their constituents had grown to distrust party nominating conventions . Accordingly , he proposed a bill enacting a mandatory two @-@ stage primary in which a runoff election would be held between the top two candidates in the first round . Historian Lowell H. Harrison maintained that Laffoon expected his rival faction to nominate the aging Beckham to oppose Rhea , and that he hoped a two @-@ stage primary would wear Beckham down . Journalist John Ed Pearce , however , contends that Beckham had already declined to become a candidate — citing his own ill health and that of his son — before the special session convened . Whatever the case , the legislature passed the bill that Laffoon proposed . 
 = = First term as governor = = 
 After Beckham declined to run for governor , the anti @-@ Laffoon faction supported Chandler against Rhea . During the primary campaign , Chandler seized upon the unpopular sales tax , labeling Rhea " Sales Tax Tom " and calling on the electorate to redeem the state from " Ruby , Rhea , and Ruin " . In the first round of the primary , Rhea garnered 203 @,@ 010 votes to Chandler 's 189 @,@ 575 . Frederick A. Wallis received 38 @,@ 410 votes and Elam Huddleston received 15 @,@ 501 . The votes for Wallis and Huddleston meant that neither Rhea nor Chandler had achieved a majority , triggering the runoff primary . Both Wallis and Huddleston backed Chandler in the runoff , and Chandler defeated Rhea by a vote of 260 @,@ 573 to 234 @,@ 124 to secure the nomination . 
 Chandler promised to repeal the unpopular sales tax , lower the gasoline tax , oppose any increase in property taxes , and end the common practice of assessing state employees a percentage of their salaries to be used for campaign activities . Infuriated by their loss , Laffoon and his allies abandoned the party and supported Republican nominee King Swope . Policy @-@ wise , there were few differences between the two , and personal attacks were employed by both sides . Swope 's reputation as a stern judge contrasted sharply with Chandler 's charisma , and Chandler used this to his advantage by dubbing Swope " his majesty " . When Chandler touted his service during World War I , Laffoon 's adjutant general Henry Denhardt countered by pointing out that Chandler had only been a cadet in training and never engaged in active service in the war . Ultimately , the campaign turned on the failed presidential administration of Republican Herbert Hoover versus that of the sitting president , Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt . Chandler defeated Swope by a vote of 556 @,@ 262 to 461 @,@ 104 in the general election . The 95 @,@ 000 @-@ vote margin of victory was , at the time , the largest ever recorded in a Kentucky gubernatorial election , and at age 37 , Chandler was the youngest governor of any U.S. state . 
 One of Chandler 's first acts as governor was to secure the repeal of the sales tax passed under Laffoon . He also successfully lobbied the legislature to abolish the two @-@ round primary in favor of a single primary for future elections . Knowing that he would need to raise revenue to offset the repeal of the sales tax and bring the state 's expenditures in line with its income , Chandler appointed a commission headed by former Governor Beckham to draft suggested budgetary legislation . Knowing that lobbyists hostile to the suggestions would likely try to encourage legislative gridlock until the constitutionally @-@ mandated end of the sixty @-@ day session , Chandler asked his allies in the General Assembly to adjourn after thirty @-@ nine days and allow him to call a special legislative session that would not be time @-@ limited and could only entertain the agenda he specified . Legislators obliged this request . 
 Acting on recommendations from Beckham 's commission , legislators helped offset the lost revenue from the sales tax by raising excise taxes ; of particular import was the tax on whiskey , which was made possible by the repeal of Prohibition in 1935 . Legislators also enacted the state 's first income tax during the session . Chandler further proposed to achieve savings through the Governmental Reorganization Act of 1936 . The bill realized significant cost savings by restructuring the state government , reducing the number of boards and commissions in the executive branch from 133 to 22 . Critics pointed out that the act also centralized more power in the hands of the governor and accused Chandler of ulterior motives in supporting it . 
 Chandler used the savings realized from his reorganization of government to eliminate the state 's budget deficit and pay off most of the state 's debt . This brought about further savings by eliminating debt service costs ; these were applied to improvements in the state 's infrastructure and educational institutions . Chandler allocated funds for free textbooks for the state 's school children , created a teacher 's pension fund , and provided extensive funding for the state 's colleges and universities . Because segregation prevented blacks from attending graduate school in the state , Chandler secured an allocation of $ 5 @,@ 000 annually to help blacks attend out @-@ of @-@ state graduate schools . He stopped short of desegregating the state 's universities , however , telling a group of black and white educators that " it is not wise to educate the white and colored in the same school in the South . It is not prepared for it yet . " 
 In 1939 , Governor Chandler appointed the first woman trustee on the University of Kentucky Board of Trustees , Georgia M. Blazer of Ashland . She served from 1939 to 1960 . 
 In 1936 , Chandler urged implementation of the state 's first rural roads program and development of electrical infrastructure with assistance from the federal Rural Electrification Act . He implemented an old @-@ age assistance program authorized by an earlier constitutional amendment and in 1938 , proposed another amendment that would add dependent children and needy blind people to the state 's assistance rolls . He increased funding to the state 's hospitals and asylums , and personally aided with the evacuation of the Frankfort Penitentiary during the Ohio River flood of 1937 . Following the flood , Chandler convinced the legislature to construct a new reformatory at La Grange . 
 Generally a friend of organized labor , Chandler supported miners ' efforts to unionize , organized the state Department of Industrial Relations , and prohibited mine operators from being appointed as deputy sheriffs . He also endorsed the proposed Child Labor Amendment to the federal constitution and secured passage of a state anti @-@ child @-@ labor law that had previously been defeated twice in the state legislature by overwhelming margins . However , he opposed closed shops and <unk> strikes , and utilized the Kentucky National Guard to quell labor @-@ related violence in Harlan County . 
 In the 1936 senatorial contest in Kentucky , incumbent Democrat Marvel Mills Logan was seen as vulnerable , and Chandler backed Democratic challenger J. C. W. Beckham in the Democratic primary . This endorsement drew the ire of Chandler 's former ally , Democratic Congressman John Y. Brown , Sr. , who believed that , in exchange for his support of Chandler in the 1935 gubernatorial race , Chandler would support him in the U.S. Senate contest . An embittered Brown entered the race anyway , and the votes he pulled from Beckham likely allowed Logan to retain the seat . Brown remained Chandler 's political enemy for the rest of his political career . 
 In 1936 , Chandler was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Kentucky ; the following year , Harvard University awarded him the same degree . 
 = = U.S. Senator = = 
 = = = Aspirations = = = 
 Both Robert Bingham and Percy Haly died in 1937 ; with J. C. W. Beckham aging — he would die in 1940 — Chandler moved to fill the leadership void in the faction . He soon came to believe he was destined to become President of the United States . In mid @-@ 1937 , he began advocating for Marvel Mills Logan , Kentucky 's junior senator , to be appointed to the Supreme Court , creating a Senate vacancy to which Chandler , as governor , could appoint himself . The death of Justice George Sutherland in January 1938 gave President Franklin D. Roosevelt the opportunity to accommodate Chandler 's wishes , but Roosevelt preferred younger justices — Logan was 63 — and Kentucky 's senior Senator , Alben Barkley , recommended Solicitor General Stanley Forman Reed for the appointment . Roosevelt heeded Barkley 's advice and appointed Reed instead of Logan . 
 Eager to augment his power and angered by Roosevelt 's and Barkley 's refusal to accept his suggestion of appointing Logan to the Supreme Court , Chandler did not attend a long @-@ planned dinner in Barkley 's honor on January 22 , 1938 ; instead , he held an event of his own at Louisville 's exclusive Pendennis Club at which he alluded to his intentions of challenging Barkley during the upcoming Democratic senatorial primary . Barkley officially announced his re @-@ election bid the following day . The death of another federal judge on January 26 provided a second opportunity for Roosevelt to appoint Senator Logan to a judgeship and appease Chandler , but Logan refused to consider the appointment . Following a January 31 meeting in Washington , D.C. between Roosevelt and Chandler , during which Roosevelt urged Chandler to put his senatorial ambitions on hold , Chandler was encouraged by his political mentor , Virginia 's Harry F. Byrd to challenge Barkley . Chandler heeded Byrd 's advice , making an official announcement of his candidacy on February 23 , 1938 , in Newport , Kentucky . 
 Barkley , recently chosen as Senate Majority Leader by a single vote , was a strong supporter of President Roosevelt and the New Deal . Chandler identified with the more conservative southern Democrats who , wary of Roosevelt and his New Deal , sought to gain control of the party ahead of the 1940 presidential election . Because Roosevelt was very popular in Kentucky , Chandler was put in the awkward position of expressing personal support of the president while opposing his hand @-@ picked leader in the Senate and his New Deal legislation . In April , polls showed Barkley ahead of Chandler by a 2 @-@ to @-@ 1 margin , and the May 3 primary victory of New Deal Florida Senator Claude Pepper finally persuaded Chandler to abandon his attacks of the program . 
 In late May 1938 , Chandler 's campaign manager publicly claimed that federal relief agencies — especially the Works Progress Administration — were openly working for Barkley 's re @-@ election . Although the WPA administrator in Kentucky denied the charges , veteran reporter Thomas Lunsford Stokes launched an investigation of the agency 's activities in the state and eventually raised twenty @-@ two charges of political corruption in a series of eight articles covering the Barkley @-@ Chandler campaign . Federal WPA administrator Harry Hopkins claimed an internal investigation of the agency refuted all but two of Stokes ' charges , but Stokes was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Reporting in 1939 for his investigation . In the wake of the investigation . Congress passed the Hatch Act of 1939 to limit the WPA 's involvement in future elections . 
 The negative effects of the investigation on Barkley 's campaign were minimal because of Chandler 's own use of his gubernatorial power and patronage on behalf of his own campaign . Dan Talbott , one of Chandler 's chief political advisors , encouraged supervisors of state workers to take punitive action against employees who made " pessimistic expressions " concerning Chandler 's chances in the primary . Furthermore , Chandler initiated a rural road building project in the state , employing loyal supporters to construct and maintain the new roads . State workers who supported Chandler were employed to deliver pension checks to the state 's elderly citizens , and Talbott did not deny charges that these workers threatened to withhold the checks if the recipients did not pledge their support to Chandler . 
 President Roosevelt personally visited Kentucky to campaign on Barkley 's behalf on July 8 , 1938 . As governor of the state , Chandler was on hand to greet Roosevelt on his arrival in Covington . Seeking to benefit from being nearest to the president , Chandler sat between Roosevelt and Barkley in the back seat of the open @-@ topped vehicle that transported them to <unk> Race Track , the site of Roosevelt 's first speech . Throughout his tour of the state , Roosevelt endorsed Barkley while remaining friendly with Chandler ; after Roosevelt 's departure , Chandler played up Roosevelt 's complimentary remarks about him while downplaying or ignoring critical remarks . 
 Late in the campaign , Chandler fell ill with chills , stomach pains , and a high fever . After first claiming the symptoms were similar to those he experienced a year earlier , Chandler later described his malady as " intestinal poisoning " . His doctor announced that Chandler , Dan Talbott , and a state police officer had all been sickened after drinking " poisoned water " provided to Chandler for a radio address . Chandler maintained that someone from the Barkley campaign had tried to poison him , but the charge never gained much credence with the press or the electorate . Barkley frequently mocked it on the campaign trail by first accepting a glass of water offered to him , then shuddering and rejecting it . He pointed out to audiences that it was the young Chandler , and not he , who had broken down first under the strain of the grueling campaign . 
 With Chandler ally Robert Bingham no longer at its helm , The Courier @-@ Journal supported Barkley , and organized labor , a key Chandler supporter in 1935 , also threw their support to Barkley . Former Chandler ally John Y. Brown , Sr. also took an active part in the Barkley campaign . Ultimately , Barkley defeated Chandler by a vote of 294 @,@ 391 ( 56 % ) to 223 @,@ 149 ( 42 @.@ 6 % ) . The remaining 1 @.@ 4 % of the vote was dividing among minor candidates . Chandler 's 70 @,@ 872 @-@ vote loss was the worst loss for a primary candidate in state history . 
 = = = Appointment = = = 
 On October 9 , 1939 , following the death of Senator Logan , Chandler resigned as governor , elevating Lieutenant Governor Keen Johnson to the governorship ; the following day , Johnson appointed Chandler to Logan 's vacated seat in the Senate . In a subsequent special election to fill the remainder of the unexpired term , Chandler first defeated Charles R. <unk> in the Democratic primary , then bested Republican Walter B. Smith by a vote of 561 @,@ 151 to 401 @,@ 812 in the November 5 , 1940 , general election . Although he never forgave President Roosevelt for backing Barkley in the 1938 senatorial primary , he generally supported his administration , although he opposed parts of the New Deal . 
 Chandler 's mentor Harry F. Byrd led a group of Southern conservatives in the Senate , and through Byrd 's influence , Chandler was appointed to the Committee on Military Affairs . In 1943 , he was part of a five @-@ person delegation from the Military Affairs Committee that traveled the world , inspecting U.S. military bases . He vociferously disagreed with Roosevelt 's decision to prioritize European operations in World War II over the war in the Pacific . 
 Chandler upset many in the black community by voting against an anti @-@ lynching bill soon after taking office . The bill levied fines against local governments and individual government officials in counties where illegal lynchings occurred . Of his vote against the bill , Chandler remarked , " I am against lynching by anybody and of anybody , black or white , but the present bill carries penalties on local officials and local subdivisions which I think are too severe . " The bill passed in the House of Representatives , but died in the Senate . Later , Chandler joined with senators from other southern states in opposing the repeal of poll taxes , long used as a mechanism to prevent blacks from voting . 
 At the expiration of his partial term in 1942 , Chandler faced a challenge from former ally John Y. Brown , Sr. in the Democratic primary . As a result of his votes on the anti @-@ lynching bill and the poll tax repeal , the Louisville chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People worked against his re @-@ election effort . During the campaign , Brown accused Chandler of abusing his power , including having a swimming pool installed at his home in violation of the federal rationing provisions implemented during World War II . Chandler invited the Truman Committee to investigate the installation of the pool ; the committee found no violations of the federal rationing provisions . Chandler went on to defeat Brown and was easily re @-@ elected in the general election over Republican Richard J. Colbert . 
 Chandler believed that he had enough support at the 1944 Democratic National Convention to be nominated as President Roosevelt 's running mate for the upcoming presidential election . That support failed to materialize , however , after the Kentucky delegation and Earle C. Clements in particular , refused to back his nomination . The convention nominated Harry S Truman as Roosevelt 's running mate . Truman became president upon Roosevelt 's death in 1945 , and Chandler never forgave Clements for costing him the chance to be president .

 Following the death of Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis in November 1944 , John O. Gottlieb , a friend of Chandler 's in the War Department , suggested Chandler as a successor . Baseball owners who had been afraid that their players would be made eligible for the draft during the war had decided that their new commissioner needed to have the skills and influence to represent baseball 's interests in Washington , D. C. As a senator , Chandler had advocated on behalf of baseball during the war , endearing him to the owners . Furthermore , the commissioner 's $ 50 @,@ 000 annual salary — about five times that of a US senator at the time — proved a significant enticement , and Chandler agreed to be considered for the job . 
 Other candidates being considered for the position included National League president Ford Frick , Democratic National Committee chairman Robert E. Hannegan , former Postmaster General James Farley , US Senator John W. Bricker , FBI director J. Edgar Hoover , former federal judge Fred M. Vinson , Ohio Governor Frank Lausche , and Undersecretary of War Robert P. Patterson . After Cincinnati Reds owner Warren Giles and Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley raised strong opposition to Frick , formerly the front runner , New York Yankees co @-@ owner Larry MacPhail began to advocate for Chandler . When the owners met in Cleveland , Ohio on April 24 , 1945 to vote for a new commissioner , Chandler 's name was not on the short list ; the candidates were Frick , Farley , Hannegan , Vinson , Lausche , and Patterson . None of the candidates received the required two @-@ thirds majority , and after lobbying by MacPhail and New York Giants owner Horace Stoneham , the owners took an informal vote to see if anyone had the potential to be elected . Chandler 's name appeared in the top three on each of the sixteen ballots . Encouraged , the owners then held another formal vote . After two ballots , Chandler received the necessary majority ; a third vote was taken to make the choice unanimous . 
 Chandler remained in the Senate for several months after his election as commissioner because he wanted to cast his vote on the Bretton Woods Monetary Agreement and the Charter of the United Nations . He received only his Senate salary until his resignation on November 1 , 1945 , despite claims to the contrary by the press . Nevertheless , his delay in assuming the commissioner 's job upset many team owners , as did his late arrival to Game 3 of the 1945 World Series , which rendered him unavailable to rule on whether the weather was clement enough to begin the game . Many owners believed Chandler had been attending a political meeting ; the actual cause of his delay was his attendance at a Detroit Athletic Club luncheon , where he was representing Major League Baseball . 
 Chandler 's election was also met with disdain from much of the press in the Eastern United States , where most of baseball 's teams resided at that time . His southern drawl and willingness to sing " My Old Kentucky Home " with very little encouragement led some sportswriters to opine that he was too undignified for the office . Others resented his folksy , political style , calling him " a preening politician " , " the Kentucky <unk> " , and " a hand @-@ shaking baby @-@ kissing practitioner of the arts " . Chandler further alienated the press by moving the commissioner 's office to Cincinnati from Chicago in 1946 . 
 In early 1946 , Jorge <unk> and his four brothers , owners of the Mexican baseball league , siphoned campaign funds from the upcoming Mexican presidential election and used them to offer large salaries and signing bonuses to American baseball players . In some cases , the offers were triple the salaries being paid in the Major Leagues . Chandler deterred players from considering Mexican League offers by imposing a five @-@ year ban from Major League Baseball to anyone who played in the Mexican League and did not return by April 1 , 1946 . In all , eighteen players played for the Mexican league despite the ban , including Mickey Owen , Max Lanier , and Sal Maglie . Vern Stephens initially agreed to play in Mexico as well , but returned before Chandler 's April 1 deadline . Ted Williams , Stan Musial , and Phil Rizzuto were also offered lucrative contracts and incentives , but all eventually declined to play in Mexico . 
 Shortly after the Mexican league incident , Robert Murphy , a former negotiator for the National Labor Relations Board , attempted to organize the Pittsburgh Pirates into a guild for purposes of collective bargaining . Murphy decried the reserve clause in player contracts that gave team owners unlimited control over the player 's services , and demanded more rights for players , including the right of contract and the right of salary arbitration . Chandler worked with Pirates officials to avoid a threatened strike by the players . Part of Chandler 's intervention included organizing a team of replacement players as a contingency plan ; the team would have included Honus Wagner , who was 72 years old at the time . 
 The defections to the Mexican league and the threat of a strike by the Pirates prompted owners to form an advisory committee , chaired by Larry MacPhail , to suggest needed changes that would calm the discontent among the players . On August 27 , 1946 , the committee presented a draft a document outlining the changes . Language in the original draft admitted that baseball was operating as a monopoly and that racial bias was the sole reason for segregation in baseball . Baseball 's attorneys stripped this controversial language from the version eventually adopted by the owners . 
 = = = Breaking baseball 's color line = = = 
 Days prior to Chandler 's assumption of the commissionership , Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey had announced the signing of Jackie Robinson to a minor league contract with the Montreal Royals , making him the first African @-@ American to play for a Major League Baseball affiliate . The following year , Rickey transferred Robinson 's contract from Montreal to Brooklyn , effectively breaking baseball 's color line . In a speech at Wilberforce University in February 1948 , Rickey recounted a secret meeting allegedly held by baseball officials at the Blackstone Hotel in Chicago on August 28 , 1946 . At the meeting , Rickey claimed that Ford Frick disseminated a report which stated that " However well @-@ intentioned , the use of Negro players would hazard all physical properties of baseball . " According to Rickey , the other fifteen team owners voted to endorse the report ; he was the lone dissent . Rickey claimed Frick meticulously collected all copies of the report at the end of the meeting to prevent them from being disseminated . Baseball historian Bill Marshall later wrote that the document and subsequent vote to which Rickey was referring was the advisory committee 's initial draft of recommended reforms . Marshall further records that Rickey identified the meeting and the report shortly after his speech at Wilberforce and retracted his claim of 15 @-@ to @-@ 1 opposition to Robinson 's entry into Major League Baseball . 
 Chandler , who was also allegedly at the meeting , made no public mention of it until a 1972 interview . In the interview , Chandler then corroborated the essentials of Rickey 's story , although he placed the meeting at the Waldorf @-@ Astoria Hotel in January 1947 . He also recounted that later in 1947 , Rickey came to his home in Kentucky to discuss the matter further . According to Chandler , Rickey professed that he would not move forward with Robinson 's transfer unless he had Chandler 's full support , which Chandler subsequently pledged . Aside from Chandler 's anecdote , which he frequently repeated after the 1972 interview , there is no evidence that his meeting with Rickey ever took place . Nevertheless , future baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn and Washington Post sportswriter Bob Addie maintained that Robinson would not have played had it not been for Chandler 's intervention . 
 That Chandler supported Robinson and the integration of baseball is evidenced by his actions during the 1947 season . First and foremost , as commissioner , Chandler had the power to void Robinson 's contract , but he chose to approve it . Further , following extreme , race @-@ based jeering at Robinson by the Philadelphia Phillies and their manager , Ben Chapman , Chandler threatened both the team and Chapman personally with disciplinary action for any future incidents of race @-@ based taunting . Later that season , he decisively supported Ford Frick 's decision to indefinitely suspend any members of the St. Louis Cardinals who followed through on a threat to strike in protest of integration . 
 = = = Other matters of Chandler 's term = = = 
 During the 1946 postseason , rumors began to swirl that Yankees owner Larry MacPhail was lobbying Brooklyn Dodgers manager Leo Durocher to leave the Dodgers and manage the Yankees . The move angered Dodgers owner Branch Rickey , who encouraged Chandler to begin an investigation into the gambling habits of Durocher and his associate , actor George Raft . In the offseason , Chandler and Durocher had a meeting wherein Chandler counseled Durocher to abandon his gambling . Branch Rickey charged Chandler with maintaining a double standard , however , when the commissioner took no action after seeing MacPhail with two known gamblers at a Yankees – Dodgers preseason exhibition in Havana , Cuba . MacPhail then signed two Dodgers assistant coaches — Chuck Dressen and John Corriden — as aides to Yankee manager Bucky Harris while they were still employed by the Dodgers . Chandler suspended Dressen for 30 days and levied $ 2 @,@ 000 fines against MacPhail and the Yankees . 
 The Yankees – Dodgers feud continued in the New York newspapers throughout the offseason . Charges were levelled by both sides , including accusations that Durocher was a philanderer because of his alleged involvement with married actress Laraine Day , which ultimately resulted in Day 's divorce . When Durocher subsequently married Day , a local Catholic priest declared that attending Dodgers games was a venial sin . Prompted in part by this declaration , Chandler suspended Durocher from baseball for a year just days before Opening Day , citing " conduct detrimental to baseball " . 
 Also in 1947 , Chandler sold the rights to broadcast the World Series on the radio for $ 475 @,@ 000 ; he used the money from the contract to establish a pension fund for baseball players . In 1949 , Chandler negotiated a seven @-@ year contract with Gillette and the Mutual Broadcasting System to broadcast the Series . Proceeds from the $ 4 @,@ 370 @,@ 000 deal went directly into the pension fund . The same two companies negotiated a six @-@ year , $ 6 million contract to broadcast the Series on television in 1950 . Again , Chandler directed the proceeds into the pension fund . 
 In 1949 , Danny Gardella , who had left the New York Giants for the Mexican League in 1946 , filed suit against Major League Baseball , claiming Chandler 's ban on players who went to the Mexican League had denied him a means of pursuing his livelihood . Gardella demanded $ 100 @,@ 000 in damages from the suspension , and claimed that the award should be tripled because baseball was subject to federal antitrust laws . Similar suits were filed by Max Lanier and Fred Martin , both of whom also played in Mexico . On June 2 , 1949 , a federal court refused to reinstate the three players pending their trials , but urged that the antitrust issues be adjudicated as soon as possible . Attempting to alleviate the legal pressure on Major League Baseball , Chandler lifted the bans on players who had gone to Mexico , reinstating them almost two years early . Lanier and Martin dropped their suits , but Gardella pursued his . After Gardella 's lawyer publicly questioned Chandler in court about baseball 's antitrust exemption for a day and a half in September 1949 , baseball executives , including Chandler , agreed to settle Gardella 's case for $ 60 @,@ 000 . 
 Chandler 's contract as baseball commissioner was not due to expire until April 1952 , but he asked for the owners to extend it in December 1949 . The owners voted against offering the extension at that time , but promised to consider the request again in December 1950 . The vote in 1950 was nine votes for Chandler and seven against , leaving him three votes short of the necessary three @-@ fourths majority . Chandler asked that the extension be considered again at the owners ' meeting on March 12 , 1951 , but the vote was again 9 – 7 . Upset that his contract was not extended , Chandler resigned effective July 15 , 1951 . 
 In an interview with The Sporting News in August 1951 , Chandler cited his decision to void a trade between the New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox for outfielder Dick Wakefield as a major factor in his inability to secure a new contract . The Yankees traded Wakefield to the White Sox for cash , but Wakefield refused to report to the White Sox after a salary dispute , leading to a disagreement between the teams over who was responsible for his salary . Chandler voided the trade , making Wakefield 's contract the Yankees ' responsibility and angering their owner , Del Webb . It was not until the 1970s that Chandler began to cite his involvement in the integration of baseball as a reason for his contract not being renewed . Historian John Paul Hill considers this unlikely , however , because two of Chandler 's strongest allies , Connie Mack and Walter Briggs , Sr. , were ardently opposed to integration while William DeWitt , the second owner in the American League to integrate , voted against him . Hill points to the Dick Wakefield dispute , as well as Chandler 's investigations of Del Webb and Cardinals owner Fred <unk> involving their rumored connections to gambling interests , as more compelling reasons for Chandler 's dismissal . 
 Following his tenure as baseball commissioner , Chandler returned to his law practice . He also engaged in farming and published The Woodford Sun newspaper . The Kentucky Press Association and the Kentucky Broadcasting Association both named him Man of the Year . He continued his involvement in sports , presiding over the International Baseball Conference from 1952 to 1955 .

 Chandler remained involved in politics throughout his tenure as baseball commissioner . In 1948 , he became the leader of the Dixiecrat movement in Kentucky . He hosted Dixiecrat presidential candidate Strom Thurmond at his home when he visited the state , but did not officially endorse Thurmond 's campaign . By the time he had permanently returned to the state in mid @-@ 1951 , it was too late to influence the gubernatorial contest . He spent the next four years rebuilding his political base in preparation for another run at the office .

 Twenty years after first holding the governorship , Chandler again entered the gubernatorial race in 1955 using the slogan " Be like your Pappy and vote for Happy " . His opponents in the Democratic Party , led by senator and former governor Earle C. Clements and sitting governor Lawrence Wetherby , had difficulty finding a candidate to oppose him . The most likely choice , Lieutenant Governor Emerson " Doc " Beauchamp , was handicapped by his connections to political bosses in Logan County . Clements virtually hand @-@ picked a relatively unknown candidate in Kentucky Court of Appeals Judge Bert T. Combs . Because Combs — whom Chandler nicknamed " The Little Judge " — had no record for Chandler to campaign against , Chandler portrayed him as a pawn of Clements and Wetherby — who he derisively referred to as " Clementine " and " Wetherbine " . 
 The inexperienced Combs did little to help his campaign . His first campaign speech , which he dryly read verbatim from his notes , included the candid admission that it might be necessary to re @-@ institute the state sales tax to balance the budget . Following the speech , a disappointed observer remarked that " Combs opened and closed [ his campaign ] on the same night . " The speech also gave Chandler his main issue for the campaign . He charged that Combs would raise taxes while promising that he would lower them as he had in his first term . 
 Chandler 's strategy in the campaign was to launch an attack upon the Wetherby administration and , before the Clements @-@ Wetherby @-@ Combs faction could react to it , to launch a new one . He claimed Wetherby had used the state 's money frivolously by installing air conditioning in the state capitol and installing a $ 20 @,@ 000 rug in his office . ( An invoice showing that carpeting for the entire first floor of the capitol had cost one @-@ tenth that amount did not stop Chandler from repeating the claim , which he said " didn 't hurt anybody , and people liked to hear it " . ) After a Wetherby administration official approved the purchase of African mahogany paneling for the governor 's office , Chandler charged that Wetherby had gone " clear to Africa " to find paneling for his office and promised that , if elected , he would use good , honest Kentucky wood for decoration . He also denounced the construction of a turnpike connecting Elizabethtown and Louisville , the state fairgrounds , and Freedom Hall as unnecessary . 
 Chandler won the Democratic primary by 18 @,@ 000 votes over Combs . In the general election , he defeated Republican Edwin R. Denney by a vote of 451 @,@ 647 to 322 @,@ 671 , the largest margin of victory for a gubernatorial candidate to that point in the state 's history . 
 = = = Governorship = = = 
 Soon after Chandler took office , it became clear that he could not fund the social programs initiated by Clements and Wetherby , plus Chandler 's own proposed programs , with the revenue presently being brought into the state treasury . He cut the popular Youth Authority , initiated by Wetherby to unify the state 's children 's welfare programs , but the savings were not enough to balance the budget . In order to deliver on his campaign promises , Chandler ignored the budget during the regular legislative session in 1956 , then called a special session during which he presented his budget proposal . The proposal called for spending in excess of $ 46 million more than officials estimated would be brought into the state 's coffers over the two @-@ year budget . Chandler convinced legislators to pass the budget , promising to propose a tax plan to pay for the expenditures in a subsequent special session . The promised package added 150 @,@ 000 citizens to the state 's tax rolls , put a surtax on income taxes , and cut tax credits . It created a new 5 percent production tax on whisky , and added taxes to deeds and life insurance premiums . It increased the state gasoline tax for trucks by two cents per gallon and raised corporate taxes by half a percent . In addition , it transferred the assessment and collection of taxes on certain intangibles from local to state government . The plan also called for a $ 100 million bond issue , allowing the allocation of generous budgets for state universities and colleges and improvements to the state highway system . 
 Although Democrats held a majority in both houses of the General Assembly , they were divided by factionalism , which made it difficult for Chandler to find sufficient support for his programs . Some of the factionalism came from Clements and Combs supporters who were not willing to cooperate with Chandler , their chief political enemy . Still other resistance to Chandler came from a group of more liberal lawmakers like John B. Breckinridge who simply had philosophical differences with the governor . Near the end of the 1958 legislative session , this group demanded a special session to deal with the need for more money for schools and welfare programs , but Chandler refused to call the session when the liberals would not agree to pass only the measures he put before them . Because of the factionalism , Chandler had to ally with Republican legislators throughout his term in order to pass many of his proposals , including his tax plan . Frequently , this meant promising to build or repair roads in Republican districts in return for their support of his programs . 
 During his campaign , Chandler had promised that he would fund a medical school at the University of Kentucky , despite the fact that the University of Louisville already had a medical school and a poll of state physicians showed overwhelming opposition to the plan because of this . Nevertheless , Chandler delivered on his promise , allocating $ 5 million to the establishment of what became known as the Albert B. Chandler Medical Center . Chandler said the establishment of the school was his proudest achievement as governor . 
 Just as he had as baseball commissioner , Chandler faced the issue of racial integration during his second term as governor . Among his first actions upon his election was to issue an executive order ensuring that blacks and whites would have equal access to the state park system . He publicly acknowledged the U.S. Supreme Court 's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education as the law of the land and promised to enforce it . The Kentucky Court of Appeals struck down Kentucky 's Day Law — the law proscribing integration — the following year . Some areas of the state resisted the change . Notably , in 1956 , when nine black students in Sturgis , Kentucky attempted to enter previously all @-@ white Sturgis High School , they were blocked by 500 opponents of integration . On September 4 , 1956 , Chandler called out the National Guard — including a force of over 900 guardsmen and several M47 Patton tanks — to disperse the crowd . The confrontation lasted a total of 18 days before the protesters peacefully dispersed . Shortly thereafter , Chandler took similar actions in response to a protest in the town of Clay , which was also resolved without violence . Of his actions , Chandler remarked " We regret it is necessary to use this means of guaranteeing equal rights to our citizens , but that we must do . " 
 Still convinced he was destined to become president , Chandler attended the 1956 Democratic National Convention with hopes of securing the party 's presidential nomination . Despite being told by his advisors that the convention would nominate Adlai Stevenson , Chandler continued to seek the nomination , but received only 36 1 / 2 votes . Following Stevenson 's nomination , Chandler returned to Kentucky bitterly disappointed . Due to the death of Senator Alben Barkley and the expiration of Senator Clements ' term , Kentucky would also elect two senators in November 1956 . Clements was seeking re @-@ election , and the state Democratic committee chose Wetherby as the nominee for Barkley 's seat . Chandler refused to use his office to support Stevenson , Clements , or Wetherby , and Republicans Dwight D. Eisenhower , John Sherman Cooper , and Thruston Ballard Morton won the presidential and senatorial races in the state . 
 In the 1959 gubernatorial primary , Chandler threw his support to Lieutenant Governor Harry Lee Waterfield . The anti @-@ Chandler forces eventually put forth Bert Combs as their nominee again . Having learned from his previous campaign , Combs now attacked Chandler for allegedly requiring state employees to donate 2 % of their salaries to his campaign . According to Combs , Chandler had deposited the money in a Cuban bank , but the money was lost when Fidel Castro overthrew the government in the Cuban Revolution . Ultimately , Combs prevailed in the primary by a vote of 292 @,@ 462 to 259 @,@ 461 . Republicans nominated John M. Robsion , Jr. to oppose Combs , and when Democratic President Harry S. Truman came to Paducah to campaign for Combs , Chandler refused to welcome him to the state , a customary duty of the sitting governor . Instead , in a letter to Truman , Chandler launched a blistering attack on his party 's nominees , calling Combs a liar and alleging that his running mate , Wilson W. Wyatt , who had previously served in Truman 's administration , had actually tried to undermine Truman by helping found Americans for Democratic Action . Combs ultimately won the general election by a wide margin . 
 = = Later life and death = = 
 In 1957 , Chandler was one of ten inaugural members of the Kentucky Sports Hall of Fame . A vestryman at St. John 's Church in Versailles , he was awarded the Bishop 's Medal of the Episcopal Church in 1959 . That same year , he received the Cross of Military Service from the United Daughters of the Confederacy . He served as a trustee of the Ty Cobb Foundation and Transylvania University . At the 1960 Democratic National Convention , he again sought the party 's presidential nomination , opining that the front @-@ runner , John F. Kennedy , was " a nice young fellow ... ( but ) too young for the nomination . " Chandler proposed that he be the presidential nominee with Kennedy as the nominee for vice @-@ president , but the convention chose Kennedy for president instead . 
 On January 3 , 1962 , Chandler opened a campaign headquarters in Frankfort , announcing his bid for an unprecedented third term as governor with the slogan " ABC [ Albert Benjamin Chandler ] in ' 63 " . His opponent in the primary was Edward T. " Ned " Breathitt , Jr . , the choice of outgoing Governor Bert Combs . Chandler reverted to his familiar campaign themes , charging the Combs administration with wasting state funds in the construction of a floral clock at the state capitol and denouncing Combs for re @-@ instituting the state sales tax . However , he found it very difficult to adapt to campaigning via television , an increasingly important medium , and his attacks mostly fell flat . 
 Breathitt enraged Chandler by charging that , when Chandler was a senator , he had voted in favor of declaring World War II , but soon after resigned his commission as a reserve army captain . According to Chandler 's version of events , after he voted in favor of the war declaration , he called Secretary of War Henry Stimson and asked to be put on active duty . Chandler said Stimson told him he would rather have a senator than a captain , after which Chandler resigned his commission . Chandler 's explanation did not stop Breathitt from repeating the charge often on the campaign trail . 
 Chandler lost to Breathitt in the primary by more than 60 @,@ 000 votes , although his running mate , Harry Lee Waterfield , won the nomination for lieutenant governor . Journalist John Ed Pearce opined that the loss marked the demise of the Chandler wing of the Democratic Party in Kentucky , although Chandler himself remained somewhat influential . 
 In 1965 , Chandler was named to the University of Kentucky Hall of Distinguished Alumni and became commissioner of the Continental Football League ( CFL ) . Chandler resigned from his CFL position in 1966 after league trustees supported a proposal to allow players from the major professional American football leagues , which he had been told would not happen . He served as Democratic National Committeeman from Kentucky . Becoming somewhat of a perennial candidate , he unsuccessfully ran for governor in 1967 and 1971 . After his loss in the 1967 Democratic primary , he endorsed Republican Louie B. Nunn . After his election , Nunn appointed Chandler to the first of his three terms on the University of Kentucky 's board of trustees . 
 In 1968 , Chandler was given serious consideration as the vice @-@ presidential running mate of Alabama 's former Governor George Wallace in the latter 's American Independent Party bid for the U.S. presidency . Wallace instead turned to Air Force General Curtis LeMay . The ticket lost to Richard M. Nixon and Spiro T. Agnew . Chandler said that he and Wallace were unable to come to an agreement regarding their positions on racial matters . 
 In 1971 , Chandler again entered the gubernatorial race , this time as an independent , but he garnered only 39 @,@ 493 votes , compared to 470 @,@ 720 for eventual Democratic victor Wendell H. Ford , and 412 @,@ 653 for Republican challenger Tom Emberton . Ford 's successor , Julian Carroll , again appointed Chandler to the University of Kentucky 's board of trustees . 
 The Major League Baseball Veterans Committee chose Chandler for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982 . In 1987 , filmmaker Robby Henson profiled Chandler in a 30 @-@ minute documentary entitled Roads Home : The Life and Times of A.B. ' Happy ' Chandler . 
 Chandler endorsed dark horse candidate Wallace G. Wilkinson in the 1987 Democratic primary , and his endorsement was considered crucial to Wilkinson 's victory in the race . After Wilkinson 's election as governor , he restored Chandler 's voting rights on the University of Kentucky 's board of trustees . ( In 1981 , then @-@ governor John Y. Brown , Jr. had designated Chandler an " honorary " , non @-@ voting member of the board . ) While discussing the University of Kentucky 's decision to dispose of its investments in South Africa at a meeting of the university 's board of trustees on April 5 , 1988 , Chandler remarked " You know Zimbabwe 's all nigger now . There aren 't any whites . " The comment immediately drew calls for Chandler 's resignation from the University Senate Council and the Student Government Association , and approximately 50 students marched on university president David Roselle 's office demanding that Chandler apologize or resign . Commenting on the controversy the next day , Chandler said " I was raised in a small town in Western Kentucky . There were 400 whites and 400 blacks , and we called them niggers and they didn 't mind . And I reverted temporarily , at least , to that expression , and of course , I wish I hadn 't . " That apology did not satisfy many , and 200 protesters marched on the state capitol , demanding that Governor Wilkinson remove Chandler from the board . Wilkinson refused to remove Chandler and urged the crowd to forgive him . 
 Chandler published his autobiography , Heroes , Plain Folks , and <unk> , in 1989 . In an interview with The Kentucky Kernel , the University of Kentucky 's student newspaper , Chandler was asked about his controversial comments the previous year , which were addressed in the book . Chandler reportedly told the paper " I said most of the Zimbabweans were niggers and they are niggers . " The comment sparked fresh protests and calls for Chandler 's resignation . In response to the controversy , Chandler 's personal assistant said " He used the word again in explaining that it was not intended by him to be a racial slur " , and called the Kernel 's story " a complete and total distortion . " 
 Chandler died in Versailles on June 15 , 1991 and was buried in the churchyard of Pisgah Presbyterian Church near Versailles . Prior to his death , he had been the oldest living member of the Baseball Hall of Fame and was the longest @-@ living former Kentucky governor .

 John Russell Baird , PC ( born May 26 , 1969 ) is a Canadian former politician . Baird served from 2011 to 2015 as Canada 's Minister of Foreign Affairs in the cabinet of Prime Minister Stephen Harper . He had been a member of the federal cabinet , in various positions , since 2006 . Previously he was a provincial cabinet minister in Ontario during the governments of Premiers Mike Harris and Ernie Eves . Baird resigned from cabinet on February 3 , 2015 , and as a Member of Parliament on March 16 , 2015 .

 A long @-@ time resident of the former city of Nepean , where he attended Bell High School , and a graduate of Kingston 's Queen 's University , he was until recently the member of the House of Commons of Canada for the riding of Ottawa West — Nepean . Baird was elected there as a candidate for the Conservative Party of Canada in the 2006 federal election , when his party defeated Paul Martin 's Liberal Party and established a minority government . Baird was sworn in as Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , replacing Jay Hill , on August 6 , 2010 . Prior to this , Baird served as Transport Minister starting October 30 , 2008 , Environment Minister starting January 2007 , and President of the Treasury Board during the Conservatives ' first year in power . 
 Baird served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2005 for the riding of Nepean — Carleton ( part of Nepean until 1999 ) , and was a cabinet minister in the Progressive Conservative governments of Mike Harris and Ernie Eves . He served as the Minister for Children , Community and Social Services , Energy and Francophone Affairs in addition to being the Government 's Chief Whip . After the Conservatives ' defeat by Dalton McGuinty 's Ontario Liberal Party , he was the party 's critic for key portfolios including finance , culture and health . Baird had been a member of the Conservatives since 1985 , when he was the youngest delegate at that time and was also a political aide for the federal Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in the late 1980s . 
 Directly upon his entry into politics , Baird became well known for being vocal on many subjects in the provincial and federal levels of government . During his tenure in the Harris Cabinet he adopted several cost @-@ saving measures , including reductions in discretionary government spending and an attempt to sell Hydro One , the government @-@ owned utility firm . As the federal President of the Treasury Board in the Harper Cabinet , he adopted the Federal Accountability Act , which was put in place after the Gomery Commission which investigated the federal sponsorship scandal in the late 1990s and early 2000s .

 He was later president of the youth wing of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario , and aligned himself with Dennis Timbrell during the latter 's abortive campaign for the PC leadership in 1989 – 90 . He backed Mike Harris when Timbrell withdrew from the contest . Baird has also indicated that he was charged with trespassing during the 1988 federal election , after he tried to question Ontario Premier David Peterson about free trade with the United States during a Liberal Party campaign stop in a Kingston shopping mall . He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Studies from Queen 's University in 1992 . 
 Baird worked on the political staff of Perrin Beatty when Beatty was federal Minister of National Defence in the early 1990s , and followed Beatty through subsequent cabinet shifts , culminating in his becoming Secretary of State for External Affairs in the short @-@ lived 1993 government of Kim Campbell . After the defeat of the federal Progressive Conservatives in the 1993 federal election , Baird worked as a lobbyist in Ottawa . 
 Baird says he has been a vegetarian since 1997 . However , he admits to eating fish , and he reportedly ate seal meat on a trip to the Arctic in 2009 . 
 He had a pet grey tabby cat named Thatcher ; when the cat died on November 10 , 2009 , a message sent by Baird using his Blackberry which said " Thatcher has died " resulted in a false rumour to the effect that Margaret Thatcher had died . In June 2008 , he was selected by the Ottawa Business Journal as a recipient of the " Forty Under 40 " award .

 While Baird had been associated with red tories such as Timbrell and Beatty , he became associated with the conservative ideology of the Mike Harris @-@ led Ontario PC party upon entering provincial politics . He was first elected to the Ontario legislature in 1995 , defeating Liberal incumbent Hans <unk> in the Ottawa @-@ area riding of Nepean . The youngest member of the legislature , Baird was appointed parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Labour on July 13 , 1995 . 
 He became parliamentary assistant to the Chair of the Management Board of Cabinet in April 1997 , and was promoted to parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Finance in November of the same year . As a backbencher , Baird proposed a bill naming Highway 416 as the " Veterans ' Memorial Highway " and successfully steered its passage through the legislature . He was easily re @-@ elected in 1999 , defeating longtime Ottawa councillor Gord Hunter by a margin of almost 15 @,@ 000 votes . 
 = = = Community and Social Services minister = = = 
 Baird joined Premier Harris 's cabinet on June 17 , 1999 as Minister of Community and Social Services , where he became responsible for implementing and expanding Ontario 's workfare program . As one of Harris 's few bilingual ministers , he was also named as Minister responsible for Francophone Affairs . 
 = = = = 1999 = = = = 
 Baird 's first press conference as a cabinet minister was held in July 1999 , and was intended to highlight the Harris government 's record in reducing the provincial welfare rolls . Baird told reporters that 15 @,@ 000 people had left the system since the introduction of workfare , and used this figure to argue that the government 's policy was a success . At the time , he lacked information on the number of workfare recipients who actually found jobs , and he also did not account for 40 % of the welfare recipients who had been cut from the list . A number of media reports subsequently criticized both the principle and the implementation of workfare in Ontario . 
 A September 1999 report from Baird 's ministry showed that 10 @,@ 600 workfare placements had been created in the first six months of 1999 , a figure which the Toronto Star observed was significantly lower than that which had been predicted by the government . Baird indicated that he would continue with the workfare program , and that the proportion of welfare recipients on workfare would be increased from 15 % to 30 % . 
 Baird was criticized in late 1999 for refusing to cancel a five @-@ year contract that had been signed between his department and the Bermuda @-@ based private firm Andersen Consulting ( later Accenture ) , worth up to $ 180 million . The contract , signed when Janet <unk> was Community and Social Services minister , entrusted Andersen with providing technological upgrades to the province 's welfare management system . The arrangement was criticized by Auditor General Erik Peters , who observed that there was nothing in the contract to prevent Andersen from increasing its hourly rates . A published report in early 2000 indicated that Andersen was charging an average of $ 257 per hour for work that had previously been done by ministry staff at $ 51 per hour . Another report indicated that the firm had charged a total of $ 55 million to find roughly $ 66 million worth of savings . In response to opposition questions , Baird said that he would not terminate the contract but would endeavour to negotiate a lower rate . Baird opposed the Harris government 's plan to amalgamate the city of Ottawa with neighboring municipalities , which was approved by the legislature in 1999 . 
 = = = = 2000 = = = = 
 In January 2000 , Baird unveiled a series of initiatives designed to reduce fraud and misuse in the welfare system . This was highlighted by the establishment of a welfare fraud hotline and a complementary conditionality three months later , in which anyone convicted of welfare fraud would run the risk of being given a lifetime ban from the program . The investigations Baird initiated during the fiscal year of 2000 uncovered $ 58 @.@ 2 million in social assistance that people were not entitled to receive , and $ 16 @.@ 6 million in avoided future costs , but critics of this approach , including opposition members , poverty advocates , and scholars , suggested that the Harris government was overstating the extent of fraud in order to undermine public confidence in welfare programs . In mid @-@ year , Baird announced that workfare placements had reached departmental quotas for most of the province . 
 Baird revealed a $ 50 million program in May 2000 to help people with developmental disabilities become integrated into their communities . He later affirmed that the province was considering closing its remaining three institutions for the mentally handicapped as part of a larger strategy focusing on home care . Baird expressed concern about the physical condition of these institutions , saying that their residents " deserve better " . Later that same year , he stated that his department would spend $ 26 million on shelters and other funding for the homeless . 
 Baird supported mandatory drug @-@ testing for welfare recipients and argued that those who refused such tests should be at risk of have their assistance cut off . He introduced a policy initiative to this effect at a press conference in late 2000 , in which he dramatically cast a box of syringes onto the floor and said that his department planned to " stop people from shooting their welfare cheque up their arm , and to help them shoot up the ladder of success " . Baird acknowledged that his department did not have reliable figures on the number of welfare recipients abusing drugs , although he cited estimates of between 4 % and 10 % . The proposal was criticized by several people , including Ontario Human Rights Commissioner Keith Norton , a former Progressive Conservative cabinet minister , who expressed concern that it could violate Ontario 's human rights code , but officials including Baird justified the measures as , " necessary in order to push people still receiving assistance toward independence . " 
 Shortly after Baird 's announcement , a government website operated by the Ministry of Community and Social Services launched an attack against Liberal Party leader Dalton McGuinty for opposing the drug testing plan . The site claimed that McGuinty was " opposed to helping welfare recipients who are addicted to drugs " . Baird denied that the message was partisan and initially refused to apologize . The Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario subsequently ruled that the site content was inappropriate and it was removed by the government , with an apology . 
 = = = = 2001 – 02 = = = = 
 In early 2001 , Baird announced that his government 's proposed drug @-@ testing plan would be extended to identify welfare recipients addicted to prescription drugs and alcohol . He later announced that provincial welfare applicants would be required to pass a literacy test . The Harris government 's welfare policies were put under scrutiny in August 2001 after a pregnant woman in Sudbury , Kimberly Rogers , died while serving a house arrest for welfare fraud . The woman had been confined to her apartment for three months and reports indicated that her pregnancy was " exacerbated by sweltering conditions in her apartment " . Responding to criticism , Baird said that he could not comment on the specifics of the case until a coroner 's inquest was completed . He defended his government 's general policy on welfare issues . A subsequent inquest did not assign blame to the government for the woman 's death , but recommended that lifetime bans for fraud be eliminated , and that adequate food , housing and medication be provided to anyone under house arrest . 
 Baird was given additional responsibilities as Minister responsible for Children on February 8 , 2001 . His department increased funding for child services early in the year , amid a significant increase in provincial demand . In November 2001 , the provincial media obtained a confidential government report recommending 40 – 45 % cuts in provincial child @-@ care programs . Baird initially declined to comment on the document 's contents , but rejected its proposals in early 2002 . 
 Baird was the first cabinet minister to support Jim Flaherty 's campaign to succeed Mike Harris as Progressive Conservative Party leader in the party 's 2002 leadership election . The election was won by Flaherty 's rival Ernie Eves , and early media reports suggested that Baird might be dropped from the new premier 's cabinet in April 2002 . He was not , but was demoted to the position of Chief Government Whip while remaining associate minister for Francophone Affairs . His replacement in Social Services was Brenda Elliott , who was from the more centrist wing of the Progressive Conservative Party . 
 = = = Energy Minister and Government House Leader = = = 
 Baird was returned to a more prominent cabinet position in August 2002 after Eves separated the ministries of Environment and Energy and appointed Baird to head the latter department . Baird was given additional responsibilities as Government House Leader in June 2003 after Chris Stockwell was forced to resign following allegations that he had used government funds for a family vacation . 
 As Energy Minister , Baird was entrusted with implementing the government 's plan to sell off part of Ontario 's Hydro One . A few months later , he became unexpectedly involved in two major and interrelated policy reversals . The Energy ministry came under intense media scrutiny in late 2002 after hydro rates increased significantly in many parts of the province . Critics argued that the Progressive Conservative government 's price deregulation policy ( implemented before Baird became Energy Minister ) was responsible . Baird suggested that the rate increases resulted from an unusually hot summer . Rates remained high through the autumn , and the Eves government was forced to re @-@ regulate the market in November by introducing a price cap . The government continued to support deregulation in principle , but maintained the cap for the remainder of its term in office . The second and more fundamental reversal occurred in late January 2003 , when Premier Eves announced that Hydro One would remain under public control . 
 Baird was regarded as less combative as Energy Minister than he had been in Community and Social Services . The energy policies of the Eves government were controversial , but opposition criticism was often directed at the premier rather than at Baird . Eves took a prominent interest in the Energy portfolio , and sometimes relegated Baird to a secondary role in policy announcements . In November 2002 , however , he was followed around the province by " <unk> " , a man in a giant lizard suit sent by the Ontario New Democratic Party as a stunt to show that <unk> electricity rates would create an ' economic monster ' for consumers . In early March 2003 , Baird announced that the government might be forced to implement rolling blackouts as a response to energy shortages . He encouraged conservation in late summer 2003 , following a province @-@ wide blackout caused by a generator failure in the United States . 
 = = = Opposition member = = = 
 The Ontario Liberal Party won a majority government in the 2003 election , although Baird was comfortably re @-@ elected in his own seat . Between 2003 and 2005 he served as Official Opposition critic for Finance , Culture , Francophone Affairs , Intergovernmental Affairs and Health . He opposed the imposition of a health premium by Dalton McGuinty 's government in 2004 , charging that the Liberals broke an election pledge not the raise taxes . Baird and New Democrat Peter <unk> were vocal critics of Speaker Alvin Curling for allegedly favouring his Liberal colleagues , saying that he sanctioned Conservative and NDP members for behaviour he would allow from Liberals . At one stage , Baird described Curling 's job performance as an " absolute disgrace " . 
 Baird co @-@ chaired Jim Flaherty 's second campaign to lead the Progressive Conservative party in 2004 . Flaherty was again unsuccessful , losing on the second ballot to the more centrist John Tory . Baird and Flaherty left provincial politics in 2005 to campaign for the federal House of Commons . Although Baird was generally on the right wing of the provincial Progressive Conservative Party , he expressed liberal views on some social issues . He supported same @-@ sex marriage during the 2003 provincial election , and in 2005 helped the McGuinty government achieve quick passage of a provincial bill granting legal recognition to same @-@ sex couples . 
 = = Federal politics = = 
 Baird supported a Canadian Alliance candidate in the 2000 federal election , and later endorsed Stephen Harper 's bid to lead the newly formed Conservative Party of Canada in its 2004 leadership election . He was appointed as the Conservative Party 's Ontario co @-@ chair for the 2004 federal election . There were rumours that Baird would leave provincial politics to contest the 2004 election , but this did not happen . In 2005 he resigned his provincial seat to campaign federally for the Conservative Party . 
 Baird won a contested nomination battle for Ottawa West — Nepean Conservative nomination on May 5 , 2005 , defeating challengers Ed <unk> , Margret <unk> and Ade <unk> . John Pacheco , a leader in the social conservative movement against same @-@ sex marriage , had sought the nomination but was disqualified due to past comments he had made alleging that homosexual practices posed a health risk . Pacheco later campaigned in the election as an " Independent conservative " , with the specific intent of being a spoiler against Baird . He argued that if his campaign caused Baird to lose , the Conservatives would " get the message that social conservatives are serious about their politics . " Baird chose to ignore Pacheco entirely in at least one all @-@ candidates debate . 
 Baird was elected , defeating Liberal candidate Lee Farnworth by about 5 @,@ 000 votes . The Ottawa Citizen endorsed Baird in this campaign , and argued that his political judgment had improved considerably since his tenure as a Harris cabinet minister . In December 2006 Baird was one of thirteen Conservative MPs who voted against reopening the national debate on same @-@ sex marriage . 
 Baird has played an aggressive role in Question Period since his appointment to cabinet , leading MP Garth Turner to describe him as Stephen Harper 's " Commons pit bull " . 
 = = = President of the Treasury Board = = = 
 Baird was appointed President of the Treasury Board on February 6 , 2006 . Following his appointment , he said that one of his priorities would be to prevent government jobs from being relocated from Ottawa to other regions for political purposes . Baird also indicated that his government was not planning to introduce job cuts or initiate a radical reduction in the size of government . In June 2006 he announced the creation of a three @-@ member panel to advise the federal government on grant and contribution programs and accountability issues . One of the members was Frances <unk> , a former Ontario New Democratic Party cabinet minister . 
 = = = = Accountability Act = = = = 
 Baird introduced the Conservative government 's first piece of legislation in April 2006 . The Accountability Act promised significant reform to the structure of Canadian politics and government . Prime Minister Harper said that it would " put an end to the influence of money " in the Canadian government . The Accountability Act restricted the ability of former politicians and bureaucrats to become lobbyists , provided protection to whistle @-@ blowers in the civil service and gave the Auditor General of Canada new powers of oversight . It limited individual donations to political parties and candidates to $ 1 @,@ 100 per year ( down from $ 5 @,@ 200 ) , created nine new or revised positions to oversee the activities of public officials and placed crown corporations such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation under access @-@ to @-@ information legislation . 
 Opposition MPs complained that several recommendations for access @-@ to @-@ information reform were left out of the bill , and were instead sent to committee for further review . New Democratic Party MP Pat Martin suggested that this deferral could delay meaningful reform for the foreseeable future . Martin later made a deal with Baird to give the bill an easy passage through committee , in return for the Conservatives accepting some NDP amendments . 
 Information Commissioner John Reid has criticized the new proposed powers for his department under the legislation , arguing that they will create unnecessary bureaucracy . Shortly after the Accountability Act was introduced to parliament , Reid issued an emergency report saying that the legislation would " increase the government 's ability to cover up wrongdoing , shield itself from embarrassment and control the flow of information to Canadians " . He added that no government had ever put forward " a more retrograde and dangerous " set of proposals for dealing with access to information laws . Baird described Reid 's criticisms as " excessive " , stating that most of the commissioner 's specific concerns were minor in nature . Representatives of Canada 's business community also expressed concern about changes to disclosure laws , arguing that their commercial secrets could be exposed to competitors . 
 The bill passed the House of Commons on division in June 2006 . The Canadian Senate approved it in December 2006 , with several amendments , and sent it back to the Commons for further consideration . The amended act was approved by the Commons without debate on December 8 , and was signed into law four days later . 
 Shortly after the bill first passed the Commons , Baird acknowledged that the Conservatives might have unintentionally broken political financing laws by failing to report convention fees collected in 2005 . He told a Senate committee that $ 1 @.@ 7 million was left unreported and that he did not realize it was an issue at the time . The matter is under review by the Chief Electoral Officer . The Conservatives quietly tabled an amendment to the Accountability Act in November 2006 , stipulating that convention fees will not be counted as political contributions . 
 = = = = Program cuts = = = = 
 In May 2006 , Baird was asked to find $ 1 billion in cuts for 2006 and 2007 . On September 25 , on the same day that the government announced a $ 13 @.@ 2 billion surplus , Baird announced cuts to sixty @-@ six federal programs , including Status of Women , medicinal marijuana research , Canadian museums , adult literacy , youth employment and social development and the British Columbia pine beetle program . One of the most controversial cuts was to the federal Court Challenges Program , which provided funding for Canadians to pursue rights cases in the Canadian court system . Baird argued that government funding would be redirected in a way that " reflects the priorities of working families " and that he " just [ didn 't ] think it made sense for the government to subsidize lawyers to challenge the government 's own laws in court . " In justifying cuts to adult literacy programs , Baird referenced his government 's support for youth literacy and said , " We 've got to fix the ground level problem and not be trying to do repair work after the fact . " 
 = = = = 2006 Ottawa municipal election = = = = 
 In early October 2006 , Baird 's department reviewed a promised $ 200 million grant to the City of Ottawa 's light @-@ rail expansion project for the O @-@ Train . Baird indicated that the government would keep the funding at least until the November election , but added that the Council elected in November would have the final say on the issue . He also leaked details of the city 's contact with the German firm Siemens . As a result , the rail program became a focal issue in the 2006 Ottawa mayoral election and Baird 's opponents accused him of trying to influence the outcome . Baird and Ottawa Mayor Bob Chiarelli accused one another of lying about details of the project , and Liberal MP Navdeep Bains asked the Federal Ethics Commissioner to investigate Baird 's decision to release details of the private contract . Chiarelli was defeated in the election and the light @-@ rail expansion was stopped by the new council . 
 An Ottawa Citizen report in January 2007 revealed that federal officials had not posed any objections to the light @-@ rail project before Baird 's intervention , and suggested that his involvement was political in nature . Green Party leader Elizabeth May speculated that Ottawa may have been deprived of light @-@ rail service because of an apparent " personal vendetta " from Baird against Chiarelli . Baird denied this charge , saying that his intervention was not political . 
 Opponents of the light @-@ rail project have argued that it was undertaken without sufficient consultation with the public . In February 2008 , it was reported that the House of Commons committee on government operations would be looking into his involvement over the case . MP and committee member Mark Holland voiced a concern that Baird leaked information on the contract . Baird replied that he made the right decision and dismissed the investigation saying " there is no evidence of anything " . Speaking to reporters he added following the announcement of the investigation : " If you want to avert a billion @-@ dollar boondoggle , you have to make some difficult decisions " .

 Baird held ministerial responsibilities for the Toronto <unk> Centre and the Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Corporation . He developed a working relationship with Toronto Mayor David Miller soon after his appointment , and was present for the announcement of a comprehensive new waterfront strategy in June 2006 . Ontario cabinet minister David Caplan described Baird as a champion of waterfront renewal and Miller described him as an ally of the city . Baird spent Christmas 2006 meeting with Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan . 
 = = = Environment Minister 2007 – 08 = = = 
 On January 4 , 2007 , Baird was appointed as Environment Minister in a cabinet shuffle , replacing Rona Ambrose . In making the appointment , Prime Minister Stephen Harper acknowledged that his government needed to do more to make the environment a priority . Some commentators remarked favourably on Baird 's appointment , describing him as a strong communicator and negotiator . Columnist Andrew Coyne , however , described Baird as " the man sent to kill the issue , " suggesting that Baird 's appointment was meant to neutralize the environment as an election issue rather than to initiate any meaningful reforms . Baird is a vocal opponent of the Kyoto Protocol , which he argues will bring about an " economic collapse " . Later in 2007 , he added that any new environmental agreements must include reduction targets for major greenhouse emitters such as China , India and the United States who have not signed the Protocol or does not have any mandatory reductions set by the Protocol . Baird met with renowned Canadian environmentalist David Suzuki following his appointment . At the time Suzuki said he was encouraged by Baird 's approach , but remained skeptical of the Harper government 's environmental plans . However , when Baird unveiled the Conservative government 's plan in April 2007 , Suzuki confronted him , calling the plan " a disappointment " . 
 = = = = Approach to the Kyoto Protocol = = = = 
 In February 2007 , the Liberal opposition brought forward a non @-@ binding motion for Canada to renew its commitment to the Kyoto Protocol . All Conservative MPs who were present in the House , including Baird , voted against the motion , which passed with the support of the three opposition parties . The following month , opposition members on a special Commons committee used their majority to bring forward sweeping changes to the government 's Clean Air Act . Among other things , the revised act called for participation in international carbon markets and the fulfillment of Kyoto targets . 
 Baird indicated that the opposition 's changes would not be included in federal targets or regulations . 
 In April 2007 , Baird produced a federal study supported by five independent economists to support his approach to the Kyoto Protocol . Among the five economists was Toronto @-@ Dominion Bank chief economist Don Drummond , who also wrote a private letter to Baird arguing that the " economic cost [ of implementing Kyoto ] would be at least as deep as the recession in the early 1980s . " Opposition parliamentarians dismissed the report as a scare tactic , while Liberal Environment critic David McGuinty argued that the study was misleading , saying that it did not properly examine international emission trading and ignored jobs to be created through the " green economy " . The report claimed that Canada 's ability to invest in developing nations to meet emissions targets through CDM by misquoting the amount of credit to be $ 85 million instead of the real approximation of $ 3 billion . Soon afterward , a United Nations report also contradicted the study mentioning that " steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions can be accomplished at a cost of only 0 @.@ 12 per cent of the world 's annual economic output " but Baird responded that Canada 's gas emission levels would peak in 2012 , three years before the UN 's set target of 2015 . 
 = = = = Environmental strategy = = = = 
 Baird was the Harper government 's representative at the release of a major United Nations report on climate change in Paris in February 2007 . He described the report as a " turning point in the battle against climate change , " while indicating his surprise that human activity was found to be a major cause of the phenomenon . 
 Baird released his government 's targets for greenhouse gas emissions in late April 2007 . The plan calls for Canada to begin cutting its existing rate of greenhouse gas emissions by 2010 and for cuts to reach 20 % by 2020 . Under this plan , Canada will reach its Kyoto targets between 2020 and 2025 , taking an additional eight to thirteen years longer than Kyoto . The government plan uses production intensity targets instead of hard caps . Baird said that the " plan strikes a balance between the perfection some environmentalists may be seeking and the status quo that some in industry seek to protect . " In December 2007 , Baird revealed in a plan that over 700 big @-@ <unk> companies , including oil and gas , pulp and paper , electricity and iron and steel companies , must cut greenhouse emissions by six percent between 2008 and 2010 . The companies would also have to produce an annual report every May 31 that would include data regarding the level of greenhouses emissions produced each year . Baird 's proposal has been met with approval from Canada 's <unk> executives , who described them as the toughest emission regulations in the world , and who feared that more stringent standards would stifle oil sands exploration . Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty had been considerably less critical than his brother , federal Liberal Member of Parliament David McGuinty , having written to Prime Minister Harper on the environmental policy . The Premier had stressed the importance of a policy that considered the North American market as a whole , due to the automotive industry 's importance to his province . McGuinty said the Conservatives ' environmental plan could have gone further but described the auto emissions part of the plan as " very sensible " . 
 Members of opposition parties have criticized the government 's abandonment of the Kyoto goals , while David Suzuki described the proposal as a " sham " with " weak targets " . Former US vice president Al Gore said Baird 's plan was a " complete and total fraud " that was " designed to mislead the Canadian people " . Baird responded by defending his plan and by criticizing Gore 's environmental record , noting that no similarly stringent measures were passed during Gore 's tenure in office and that the Kyoto Treaty was never submitted to the US Senate for ratification . Liberal Party MP Pablo Rodriguez introduced to the House of Commons a private bill that would have forced Canada to comply with the Kyoto Treaty in response to the government 's plan . While the bill passed , Baird mentioned that , even though that the government wouldn 't dismiss the idea , there were no new environmental measures planned . All three opposition parties demanded that the environment become one of the main points of the government 's Throne Speech in the 2007 fall session . 
 = = = = Environmental record = = = = 
 Shortly after his appointment , Baird , Stephen Harper and Natural Resources Minister Gary Lunn announced $ 1 @.@ 5 billion for clean @-@ energy initiatives over the next decade . Baird and Lunn also announced a $ 230 million program for clean energy technology . Lunn said that " there were literally hundreds of programs but there was no focus " when the Conservatives took office . Critics argued that the new Conservative measures were similar to measures introduced by the Liberals in their 2005 budget . Former Liberal leader Stéphane Dion has argued that the Conservative Party 's strategy is too strongly focused on nuclear energy . 
 On February 12 , 2007 , Baird appeared at a press conference with Stephen Harper and Quebec Premier Jean Charest to announce a $ 1 @.@ 5 billion environmental fund for the provinces . Journalist Frances Russell criticized that as a reduction from the $ 3 billion promised by the previous Liberal government . 
 Canada is a signatory to the Kyoto protocol which legally requires signatory countries to set up compatible carbon trading markets . In direct defiance of this international legal obligation , in March 2007 , Baird indicated that he wanted Canadian companies to be banned , or at least severely restricted , from participating in the international carbon market . Several European countries had already set up a trading system to allow companies that reduce their emission levels below government targets to sell " credits " on an international market . Many industry leaders argued that Canada should adopt a similar policy . Then @-@ opposition leader Stéphane Dion argued that participation will allow Canadian firms to make " <unk> of money " . Baird however described some carbon markets as " shaky , " and argued that trade should be restricted to within Canada , or perhaps within North America . In April he indicated that Canadian businesses would soon gain the right to earn credits by investing in overseas environmental projects . 
 Baird defended another Conservative government decision to cut funds for climate science research , arguing that further studies are largely superfluous in light of recent United Nations reports . Gordon McBean of the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences has disagreed , claiming that further research is the best way to adapt to a changing climate . 
 Baird said in a House of Commons Committee that his government would not consider the implementation of a carbon tax . He told that the government 's approach " will be to provide regulation for industry to ensure we reduce both greenhouse gas emissions and reduce air pollutants " 
 = = = = Bali = = = = 
 While participating at the United Nations Summit On Climate Changes in Bali , Indonesia , Baird announced a $ 86 million funding to help Canadian communities notably coping with the loss of forests due to pine beetles in the west and of infrastructures in the north due to softer soil . The four @-@ year plan included $ 56 million on several projects and $ 29 million for research . 
 Baird was criticized by some parties and observers for obstructing progress on what was to become ' the Bali Action Plan ' . Baird showed up for the Bali Conference at which it was intended he explain Canada 's position at a meeting with non @-@ governmental activists , but instead quickly left , with one of the activists alleging that Baird left because he " probably did not want to confront young activists critical of Canada 's stand . " 
 = = = Draft Baird Movement = = = 
 In late November and early December 2008 , a website went online allegedly representing a movement to draft Baird for leader of the Conservative Party , in the face of Stephen Harper facing possible defeat by an opposition coalition . 
 The draft group allegedly comprised over 100 party members from across the country — including two MPs and one Senator ( who , reportedly , had requested anonymity ) . In its only contact with the media , the campaign claimed it had nearly 3 @,@ 000 visitors and 237 new supporters in less than ten hours . 
 Baird has since indicated not only that he is loyal to Harper , but that he is uninterested in ever becoming party leader . In 2011 he told a newspaper , " Some people may have when growing up , always harboured leadership ambitions . I 've never harboured leadership ambitions . It is the honest @-@ to @-@ God truth . "

 Activists on board a Canadian boat taking supplies to Gaza ( which had been blockaded by the Israeli government to ensure that weapons and other contraband did not enter Gaza ) in November 2011 urged Baird to resign as foreign minister for " failing to do his job " . They said they had been roughed up and <unk> by Israeli forces and that " If minister Baird wants to put the interests of a far @-@ right Israeli government before Canadians , he should apply for the job of Israel 's ambassador " . Baird affirmed Canada 's support for Likud 's opposition to Palestinian statehood while visiting Israel in February 2012 . On September 7 , 2012 he announced the sudden closure of Canada 's embassy in Tehran and the expulsion of all Iranian diplomats from Canada . Baird made the announcement at an Asia @-@ Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Russia . He said Canada 's decision was not linked to growing speculation of an imminent attack by Israel on Iran 's nuclear facilities . Baird said " Canada views the government of Iran as the most significant threat to global peace and security in the world today .

 = Tom & Gerri = 
 " Tom & Gerri " is the third episode of British dark comedy anthology series Inside No. 9 . It premiered on BBC2 on 19 February 2014 . The episode was based on a play that Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith had written while living together prior to the development of their series The League of Gentlemen . While the play had originally been around two hours in length , the episode was only half an hour . " Tom & Gerri " follows a difficult period in the life of Tom ( Shearsmith ) , a primary school teacher and aspiring writer , and his partner Gerri ( Gemma Arterton ) , a struggling actress , after Tom invites the homeless Migg ( Pemberton ) into his home . Conleth Hill stars as Stevie , a man worried about the mental health of his friend Tom . The entire episode takes place inside Tom 's flat . 
 Reviewers generally agreed that " Tom & Gerri " was significantly darker but less funny than previous episodes of Inside No. 9 . Nonetheless , the response to the episode as a whole was very positive . Critics disagreed about the presentation of Tom 's mental illness in the episode , with one journalist suggesting that the episode 's ending " set back public awareness of mental health at least half an hour " , but another saying that the story presented " a fine – if cartoonish – take on mental illness " . 
 = = Production = = 
 Writers Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith , who had previously worked together on The League of Gentlemen and Psychoville , took inspiration for Inside No. 9 from " David and Maureen " , episode 4 of the first series of Psychoville . This episode , in turn , was inspired by Alfred Hitchcock 's Rope . " David and Maureen " took place entirely in a single room , and was filmed in only two shots . At the same time , the concept of Inside No. 9 was a " reaction " to Psychoville , with Shearsmith saying that " We 'd been so involved with labyrinthine over @-@ arcing , we thought it would be nice to do six different stories with a complete new house of people each week . That 's appealing , because as a viewer you might not like this story , but you 've got a different one next week . " As an anthology series with horror themes , Inside No. 9 also pays homage to Tales of the Unexpected , The Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock Presents . 
 The " loose story " of " Tom and Gerri " was written originally as a two @-@ hour play while Shearsmith and Pemberton were on the dole and sharing a flat , prior to the production of League of Gentlemen . The story was inspired by their experiences in this environment . The character of Tom has his " life energy " drained in the same way that , the writers suggest , is experienced by <unk> . The " sinister " atmosphere of the episode is meant to evoke the feeling that a person has when they " can 't quite manage to leave the flat " and they " can 't be bothered to tidy up " . " Tom & Gerri " ended up " quite different " from the play , which featured a character much like Pauline from The League of Gentlemen . Pemberton described the feel of the episode as Pinteresque , comparing it to Harold Pinter 's A Slight Ache . This sentiment was echoed by critic Gareth Lightfoot , writing in Teesside 's Evening Gazzette . 
 As the format of Inside No. 9 requires new characters each week , the writers were able to attract actors who may have been unwilling to commit to an entire series . In addition to the writers , " Tom & Gerri " starred Gemma Arterton and Conleth Hill . The flat in which the episode was filmed , with its boardgames and " misery " , was , for Shearsmith , similar to the flat once shared by the writers . The episode was filmed in winter , and Pemberton described a " grim " atmosphere during filming . He also said that he hated the wig and beard he wore to play Migg , which irritated his skin . David Chater , writing in The Times , said that the hair meant Migg " has an eerie resemblance to the Cowardly Lion from the Wizard of Oz - only not nearly as benign " . 
 Considering the title of " Tom & Gerri " , critic Bruce Dessau suggested that it was likely not a reference to the Tom and Jerry of 1970s sitcom The Good Life , as the life of Tom and Gerri is " anything but good " . Instead , he suggested , the reference was more likely to cartoon characters Tom and Jerry , saying that there " is definitely a hint of cat and mouse " in the plot . Metro critics Larushka Ivan @-@ Zadeh and Carol Carter concurred , saying that the plot consisted of " a game of cat and mouse " . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The episode begins with Tom ( Shearsmith ) , a primary school teacher , apathetically marking work while chatting to Gerri ( Arterton ) , who is going to audition for a part in a play . Tom complains about a tramp begging outside their house . Later in the evening , Tom is home alone and Migg ( Pemberton ) , the tramp , comes to his door , to return Tom 's wallet . Tom rewards him with £ 40 . Migg comes back later with a bottle of whiskey for Tom . Reluctantly , Tom invites Migg inside for a drink . Migg says he knows Charles Bukowski , a writer Tom idolises , and Tom warms to Migg as they drink . 
 Tom awakes the next morning on his sofa . Gerri is alarmed to see him there , as he should be at work , and then gets angry that Migg was invited in . Migg emerges from the bathroom as Gerri leaves the house , and encourages Tom to call in sick . It is revealed that Tom had promised Migg some of his clothes , and Migg makes breakfast . Later , Migg and Tom play Risk and drink wine . Tom is concerned that Gerri has not called . When Tom heads out to buy cigarettes and wine , Migg hides Tom 's mobile and deletes an <unk> message left by Tom 's colleague Stevie ( Hill ) . 
 A week later , Tom lies in bed , smoking and writing . Gerri enters the room , and it is revealed that Tom has left his job . She has been rehearsing in Portsmouth and says she left him dozens of messages , but Tom thinks he lost his phone . The pair fight over Migg , who is still living with Tom . Later still , the flat is a mess , and Tom is unkempt and drinking heavily . He has no messages on his phone and no post . He sits down to play Scrabble with Migg , and it is revealed that it is Tom 's birthday . The two argue about washing up , and Migg says that Tom has " no right " to judge him . Tom storms out of the room , and Migg flicks through birthday cards he has hidden from Tom , saying " Thank you , Grandma ! " and taking the £ 10 that Tom 's grandmother sent . The house and Tom have deteriorated further when Stevie comes to visit . He has brought Tom vouchers for The Body Shop . Stevie invites Tom out for dinner , but he declines . Stevie leaves , and Tom settles down with Migg on the sofa . 
 Tom 's electricity is cut off , and he weeps . A shaven Migg , wearing clean clothes , enters the house . He has started a job , working with children , and gives Tom £ 40 because Tom has " done so much " for Migg . Migg wants to take over the tenancy on the flat until Tom 's benefits come in . He walks into the bathroom to get into the bath as Gerri walks in and comforts Tom , who asks her not to leave . Gerri tells Tom that he has invented Migg to cope with what has been happening . She says Tom is depressed and has had a nervous breakdown . The pair head into the bathroom , but there is no Migg . Gerri tells Tom to " get this Migg out of [ his ] head once and for all " . She leaves , and Migg emerges from a hiding place ; he asks if everything is alright . 
 Things apparently get better : the flat is tidy , Tom is smartly dressed and clean @-@ shaven . Gerri is happily chatting to him . Tom answers the door to Stevie , who asks Tom to come back to work . He is alarmed to see Tom call Gerri ; Stevie says that Gerri was killed in a car accident , and that Tom went back to work too soon . Stevie heads to the bathroom to get Tom 's medication , but freezes when he sees the corpse of Migg in the bath . Tom tells him not to worry , and that Migg is not real . He invites Stevie to stay for coffee , saying Gerri is just boiling the kettle .

 Reviewers generally agreed that the episode was darker than previous episodes , but not as funny . However , Will Dean , writing in The Independent , said that his observation that the episode " wasn 't really in the slightest bit funny " was " no complaint " . The critical response to " Tom & Gerri " was overwhelmingly positive ; Dean was " moved by its sad brilliance " , while Gerald Gilbert , also writing in The Independent , called it " another finely worked playlet " . Bruce Dessau said viewers would be " totally immersed from start to finish " . 
 Critics disagreed on how " Tom & Gerri " compared to previous episodes of Inside No. 9 . Writing in The Guardian , Mark Jones said that " Tom & Gerri " was the " highlight of the series so far , with Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton on top form " . Pat Stacey , of the Evening Herald , agreed , though considered the previous episodes weak . By contrast , an anonymous reviewer in the Liverpool Echo thought " Sardines " was stronger , but said " Tom & Gerri " was " definitely the creepiest " of the first three , and Chater also disagreed with Jones and Stacey ; while he praised the episode as " a sinister tale about the fragile nature of sanity performed by actors who are frighteningly good " , he felt that it was not as strong as earlier installments . Like Chater , Dessau stressed the quality of the acting , praising the performances of both Shearsmith and Pemberton , especially the latter . 
 There was further disagreement on the episode 's approach to mental illness . Andrew Billen , writing in The Times , said he initially thought Mind may be able to use " Tom & Gerri " as a teaching aid , but he said that the ending " set back public awareness of mental health at least half an hour " . By contrast , Dean considered the character of Tom to be " a fine – if cartoonish – take on mental illness " . 
 Billen called the episode " distressing comedy to watch " , but said that " the acting , the scripting , the satisfactions of one @-@ act resolution and the laughter it generated " were redeeming qualities , and gave the episode four out of a possible five stars . Dessau felt that parts of the script were <unk> , but some twists " catch you completely unaware " , while the ending " may haunt [ viewers ] for days " . Jack Seale , of the Radio Times , suggested that viewers will believe that they have guessed the plot by the half @-@ way point in the episode . However , he said that the writers " give their story of how we 're all one slip away from the gutter a chilling sense of rising dread " which counteracts this . " Nobody " , he said , " plays wicked games with the audience more skilfully . " Larushka Ivan @-@ Zadeh and Carol Carter , writing in Metro , suggested that viewers would want to rewatch the episode in an attempt to pick up clues to the plot twists that they originally missed . 
 = Dilek Peninsula @-@ Büyük Menderes Delta National Park = 
 Dilek Peninsula @-@ Büyük Menderes Delta National Park ( Turkish : Dilek <unk> @-@ Büyük Menderes <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , established on May 19 , 1966 , is a national park in western Turkey . It contains within its borders the entirety of the Dilek Peninsula as well as the large delta of the Büyük Menderes River . It is located in the Kuşadası district of Aydın Province , and as such it is also within the bounds of Turkey 's Aegean Region . Directly west of the national park is the small coastal town of Güzelçamlı , where several shuttle buses and ferries operate to and from the district 's center of Kuşadası , approximately 30 km ( 19 mi ) from the park . 
 The park is among the most biologically diverse of Turkey 's national parks . It is the native and migratory habitat of hundreds of species of birds , mammals , plants , and marine life , some of which are entirely endemic to the park and cannot be observed anywhere else in the world . For these reasons , it is protected by numerous wildlife and wetland conventions , and is of great national and international importance in these areas . 
 It is separated from the Greek island of Samos ( Greek : <unk> ) by a very narrow strait , known as the Mycale Strait ( Greek : <unk> της <unk> ) . The strait is named after Mount Mycale , the highest and most prominent mountain of the peninsula , and is one of the narrowest straits in the Aegean Sea . 
 = = History = = 
 For most of the area 's existence , the lands from the Dilek Peninsula southwards to the end of the Büyük Menderes River 's large delta were uninhabited by people or very sparsely settled , and were otherwise untouched by human influence . As a result of this isolation , the area was considerably populated with numerous species of plants and wildlife , most of which still remain within the park today . Eventually , under Ancient Greek and especially Ionian influence , several settlements near Mount Mycale and the Büyük Menderes Delta were built , such as Priene and Miletus . Nearby , Panionium was erected as the meeting place of the Ionian League . During modern times , and despite a significant increase in population and density in areas near the port town of Kuşadası , it was not until May 19 , 1966 that the Turkish Ministry of Forest and Water Management declared Dilek Peninsula a government @-@ protected national park . Several decades later , in 1994 , the Büyük Menderes river delta adjacent to the peninsula in the south was also promoted to national park status . 
 = = = Events = = = 
 In early 2005 , a severely wounded Mediterranean monk seal ( Monachus <unk> ) was found within the Büyük Menderes Delta . It was treated immediately , but due to complications died shortly afterwards . The Mediterranean monk seal is critically endangered , with only about 600 remaining in the world , and over 100 of which are within the maritime borders of Turkey . 
 Controversy surrounded the park in April 2010 after the chairman of the Aydın Beekeepers Association , Kadir Kılıç , claimed that beekeepers would be dispatched at the national park , which had been banned since its establishment in 1966 . Debate continued for a short period of time , but the dispute was soon settled , as a representative of the Governor 's Office of Aydın publicly asserted the provincial government 's position on the matter . They denied the claims and confirmed that beekeepers would not be introduced to the park . Beekeepers are currently not allowed as a means of conserving the abundant flora of the park , many of which rely on bees for pollination . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The national park is 27 @,@ 598 ha ( 68 @,@ 200 acres ) in total land area , with the peninsula itself having an area of about 110 km2 ( 42 sq mi ) , with a width of around 6 km ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) from north to south and a length of 20 km ( 20 @,@ 000 m ) east to west . It is located approximately 8 km ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) from <unk> , about 26 km ( 16 mi ) from the district 's seat of Kuşadası ( estimates range from 23 @-@ 30 kilometres ) , and is directly adjacent to the town of Güzelçamlı . Other nearby cities in Aydın Province have access roads to the park , including Aydın , <unk> and , to a lesser extent , <unk> . 
 The Mycale Strait separates the peninsula from the nearby island of Samos . Named after Mount Mycale , the strait is only about 1 @.@ 6 km ( 0 @.@ 99 mi ) long at its narrowest point , making it one of the smallest straits within the region of the Aegean Sea . 
 = = = Popular features = = = 
 The mountainous terrain of the peninsula and its numerous caverns , canyons , and valleys result in the area being of high interest to both visitors and researchers . There are several coves along the shore that have been named in order to identify them easily . Upon entering the park from the east , the first and easternmost beach available to the public is known as <unk> Cove ( Turkish : <unk> Koyu ) . This cove 's waters are shallower than any other in the park , and its beaches are sandy , unlike some of the coves farther out . Therefore , it appears to be more popular amongst tourists than most of the remaining beaches and parts of Kuşadası that are visible along the horizon from it . <unk> Cove is situated about 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) further to the west , and has pebbly shores and deeper waters . It marks the transition point where the waters of the peninsula 's beaches become more challenging . As a result , these beaches tend to attract more experienced swimmers and locals rather than tourists . After passing the <unk> ( public safety patrol ) checkpoint , a turn onto a road leads to a nearby canyon , immediately to the left . From this point on , there are several trails through the forests of the peninsula . One of them leads to the village of <unk> , and if followed further , leads to the nearby ancient Hellenistic port city of Karine . However , this path 's final 9 km ( 5 @.@ 6 mi ) are limited in access , and a permit or an accompanying tour guide is required to proceed . The third cove along the peninsula , <unk> <unk> Cove , and the final , westernmost cove accessible to the public , Karasu Cove , both provide close views of the island of Samos , and are significantly less visited than the former coves of the peninsula . At the very end of the peninsula appears its tallest mountain , Mycale ( Turkish : Dilek Dağı ) , which looms over Samos and the strait of its namesake . 
 = = = = Cave of Zeus = = = = 
 Immediately upon entry into the national park , a fork in the main path begins a trail running through the inner peninsula leading to a local cavern known as the Cave of Zeus ( Turkish : Zeus <unk> ) . The entrance is dense in vegetation , covering parts of it . There is also a wishing tree to which people usually tie objects and belongings , hoping for their wishes to be granted . The Cave of Zeus is filled with clear subterranean spring water , making it another common tourist attraction near the national park . Visits to the cave typically increase as the waters of the nearby beaches become rougher , thereby making them less inviting . The cave 's name invokes the many legends that concern the cave and its origins , including one holding that Zeus bathed in the cave . 
 = = = = Büyük Menderes Delta = = = = 
 The wide mouth of the Büyük Menderes River ( English : Great Meander ) empties at the Aegean Sea , with an area of 16 @,@ 613 ha ( 41 @,@ 050 acres ) ; larger than the entire Dilek Peninsula directly to the north , at only 10 @,@ 985 ha ( 27 @,@ 140 acres ) . The Büyük Menderes Delta is one of the most diverse wetlands in Turkey in terms of both vegetation and marine life , and is protected by several wetland agreements such as the Ramsar Convention . Its biodiversity is derived in part from the fertile lands and fresh waters of the delta , attracting numerous species to the area , including several migratory birds . The nearby mountains of the peninsula cause a marked temperature difference between the northern and southern faces of the peninsula , producing a corollary variance in the types of species found in the delta region . The area features a trail for visitors and options for canoeing and picnicking . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Dilek Peninsula @-@ Büyük Menderes Delta National Park has a Mediterranean climate ( Köppen climate classification Csa ) , and as such , it is dry and mild throughout most of the year , except during the winters , when most of the yearly precipitation occurs . The average temperature year @-@ round is about 18 ° C ( 64 ° F ) , ranging from average lows of 8 ° C ( 46 ° F ) in the winter to highs of around 27 ° C ( 81 ° F ) in the summer . However , on the mountaintops , as altitude increases , temperatures are usually much lower , with the annual mean temperature usually being no higher than 13 ° C ( 55 ° F ) . There are additional precipitation differences depending on elevation , and also between the north and south sides of the peninsula . Such precipitation amounts range from 900 – 1 @,@ 500 mm ( 35 – 59 in ) annually . Therefore , different species of foliage and plants live at higher altitudes than those at ground level , and the same is true when comparing the southern face of the peninsula and areas of the river delta with those to the north . 
 = = Geology = = 
 The terrain of the peninsula has much to do with the geology of the Aegean Region in general . The peninsula was shaped into its current form over several geological eras with the tectonic merging of Paleozoic schist formations , Mesozoic limestone and marble deposits , and finally the accretion of large clays and other sediments during the Neogene period . This is partly because of Turkey 's unstable fault block terrain , and because of the close proximity of the Anatolian @-@ Aegean plate boundary , which generates massifs of mountains all across western Turkey . This includes the peninsula and the mountains surrounding the Büyük Menderes River , known collectively as the Menderes Massif . 
 The peninsula is highly mountainous , with most of its mountains having elevations close to 1 @,@ 200 m ( 3 @,@ 900 ft ) above mean sea level . Its highest mountain , Mount Mycale , is approximately 1 @,@ 237 metres ( 4 @,@ 058 ft ) high . 
 = = Biology = = 
 The national park is quite diverse in its wildlife and vegetation , hosting approximately 804 distinct species of plants , 256 bird species , and an otherwise considerable variety of mammals , reptiles , and marine life . The entirety of the national park , including both Dilek Peninsula National Park and Büyük Menderes Delta National Park , is currently protected under the Ramsar Convention , the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats , the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity , and the Barcelona Convention . 
 = = = Flora = = = 
 The park has a large diversity of vegetation . Due to the temperature and climate differences between different areas and elevations of the park , not only is the typical Aegean flora present , but also many specimens normally only found in separate coastal areas of Turkey , such as in the Mediterranean , Marmara , and Black Sea regions . 
 Out of the 804 species of flora distributed throughout the park , six are endemic , completely exclusive to the park area , and cannot be observed anywhere else on earth , while another 30 are indigenous . The most common and widely distributed plant species throughout the national park are Mediterranean maquis shrubs such as the Phoenician juniper ( Juniperus phoenicea ) . Other common vegetative species within the area include the <unk> @-@ leafed pear ( <unk> <unk> ) , Turkish pine ( Pinus <unk> ) , and elm @-@ leaved <unk> ( Rhus <unk> ) . 
 = = = Fauna = = = 
 In total , 28 species of mammals , 42 species of reptiles , and 45 fish species have been documented within the park . Several wild boars ( Sus scrofa ) are native to the park . They are often found near the beaches where they feed on scraps and trash dropped by visitors . Further within the forests of the peninsula , other mammals can be spotted , such as golden jackals ( Canis aureus ) , Eurasian lynx ( Lynx lynx ) , and even several striped hyenas ( Hyaena hyaena ) and caracals ( Caracal caracal ) , among many others usually not native to such areas . 
 Along the southern shores of the peninsula , and within the river delta , exist a range of bird and marine life . Many of these species are endangered , which was one of the primary factors considered when placing the delta under national protection . Some of the more common bird species observed here include pygmy cormorants ( <unk> <unk> ) , little egrets ( Egretta garzetta ) , lesser kestrels ( Falco <unk> ) , Kentish plovers ( Charadrius <unk> ) , white @-@ tailed eagles ( Haliaeetus albicilla ) , and the Dalmatian pelicans ( Pelecanus crispus ) , for which the park is a key nesting place . Marine life consists of species typical of the Aegean Sea , as well as some species usually found elsewhere . 
 The biodiversity of local oceanic fauna is not well understood . Sea turtles and mammals , including monk seals , fin whales ( only 1 sighting and 5 strandings have been documented in Turkish waters ) , and dolphins are considered to reside in the park area , although regularity of occurrences are unclear .

 Nature photography is a common activity in the park due to the large variety of flora and fauna , as well as landscape photography due to the mountainous terrain and views .

 The park is the most visited during the spring and summer months , when it is open between 8 : 00 and 19 : 00 ( 7 : 00 pm ) local time .

Camping , lighting fires , or setting up overnight shelters are strictly forbidden within the limits of the national park in order to protect the surrounding ecosystem . The park can be reached from the city center of Kuşadası via several <unk> ( share taxis ) that regularly shuttle the route to the closest town of Güzelçamlı . Recently , there have also been ferry boat services operating back and forth between Kuşadası and Güzelçamlı , in turn providing easier access to the park for visitors .

 Moonlight Madness received negative and mediocre ratings from reviewers , who either criticized the game overall or different aspects of it . Direct comparisons with Booty feature in many reviews . The game 's price was in particular a common complaint among reviewers , who stated that it should have been a budget @-@ priced title . One reviewer stated that it would have been better received as a budget title , another stated " Like Booty , Moonlight Madness would be all right at budget price " .

" Computer Gamer 's reviewer stated " Had it been released on a budget label , Moonlight Madness would have been fair value for money . As it is , it is grossly overpriced . " 
 Reviewers highlighted technical issues in the game . The eight door maze room was thought to be a bug , a software error , by two people at ZX Computing magazine . Because the game contains no reset feature they reloaded the game from cassette in order to continue playing . The player character 's movements were criticised for being jerky and prone to stopping at infrequent intervals . One of Crash magazine 's staff stated that the boy scout 's movement to the left was quick ; " as if there 's a force ten gale blowing to the left . " They added " When any attempt is made to move right , all the moving characters on the screen slow right down . " In @-@ game objects are removed from view when either the player character or one of the mansion staff move in front of them . When the player redefines the game 's keyboard controls , allowing them to choose which keys move the boy scout during play , the pause key and music toggle key are not included . As a result it is possible to double @-@ up movement controls with these two functions , effectively causing the game to pause and <unk> or for the music to toggle constantly as the player moves in that direction . 
 Reviewers ' opinions on the graphics and gameplay were largely negative , while opinion 's on the title 's music varied . The background music was described as " ... the only thing that is remotely interesting about this appallingly tedious game ... " by Popular Computing Weekly 's reviewer . He followed this by stating " At first it sounds all right , if a little monotonous , then it begins to grate the nerves . After a while it begins to take on all the appeal of the Chinese water torture . " Crash magazine 's three reviewers were more positive about the music , stating " The sound is fairly well done ...

 = Monkey Gone to Heaven = 
 " Monkey Gone to Heaven " is a song by the American alternative rock band Pixies and is the seventh track on their 1989 album Doolittle . The song was written and sung by frontman Black Francis and was produced by Gil Norton . Referencing environmentalism and biblical numerology , the song 's lyrics mirrored themes that were explored in Doolittle . " Monkey Gone to Heaven " was the first Pixies song to feature guest musicians : two cellists , Arthur Fiacco and Ann Rorich , and two violinists , Karen Karlsrud and <unk> Metter . 
 " Monkey Gone to Heaven " was released as the first single from Doolittle in the United States and United Kingdom . As the band had signed to Elektra Records shortly before , the single also marked their first American and major label release . It was critically well @-@ received ; Rolling Stone 's David Fricke said " Monkey Gone to Heaven " was " a corrosive , compelling meditation on God and garbage " . In the years since its release , the song has received several accolades from music publications . 
 = = Lyrics and meaning = = 
 " Monkey Gone to Heaven " ' s main theme is environmentalism . The song mainly deals with man 's destruction of the ocean and " confusion of man 's place in the universe " . " On one hand , it 's [ the ocean ] this big organic toilet . Things get flushed and <unk> or decomposed and it 's this big , dark , mysterious place " , Black later said , " It 's also a very mythological place where there are octopus 's gardens , the Bermuda Triangle , Atlantis , and mermaids . " Francis came up with the song 's hook , " this monkey 's gone to heaven " , long before the song itself was written . The line itself forms a basis for the song , which revolves around man 's relationship with the divine and environmentalism . After Francis set the developing lyrics to music , he rushed to lead guitarist Joey Santiago 's apartment to play it to him . Santiago later commented on the nascent performance : " It was early in the morning , I was still so tired . [ Francis said ] ' Hey Joe , I need to come over . I need to show you something . ' [ ... ] It was awesome , really good . He had the ' If man is five ' part there , and he was laughing . [ ... ] It was hilarious " . 
 " Monkey Gone to Heaven " includes references to numerology in the lyrics " If man is five / then the Devil is six / and God is seven " . Francis later expanded on the significance of the lyrics in an interview to Alternative Press , saying " It 's a reference from what I understand to be Hebrew numerology , and I don 't know a lot about it or any of it really . I just remember someone telling me of the supposed fact that in the Hebrew language , especially in the Bible , you can find lots of references to man in the 5th and Satan in the 6th and God in the 7th . [ ... ] I didn 't go to the library and figure it out " . The song 's numerology is alluded to on the single 's cover , which features figures of five , six and seven , and also a monkey with a halo . 
 Ben Sisario , author of Doolittle 33 ⅓ , offers a slightly different interpretation of the song : " Neptune , the god of this realm [ in reference to Francis ' ocean comment ] , the ' underwater guy who controlled the sea , ' hung out down there , the personification of man 's relationship with the earth . And what happens to Neptune ? He gets ' killed by ten million pounds of sludge from New York to New Jersey . ' Same thing with the " creature in the sky , " who gets stuck up there in a hole in the ozone layer . Man the divine manifestation effectively dies , and what remains is his degraded animal nature ; the chintzy halo stuck on the primate 's head is the symbol of that unhappy fall " . 
 = = Structure = = 
 " Monkey Gone to Heaven " is written in the key of D major , and opens with Francis ' rhythm guitar playing a short chord progression backed by the bass guitar of Kim Deal and drums of David Lovering . The guitar intensity fades as Francis begins to sing , leaving Deal 's bassline and Lovering 's steady drum @-@ beat . Between each line of the verse , Francis pauses , leaving the drums and bass playing . Joey Santiago 's lead guitar does not feature at all during the verses . By the end of the second line of each verse , the cello part joins in , following the bassline closely . 
 As the first verse finishes , the opening chord progression is repeated . This leads into the chorus ( where Francis and Deal repeat " This monkey 's gone to heaven " ) with the lead guitar of Santiago playing two notes repeatedly . The two violins play a melody throughout , accompanied by a piano in the background . There is then a short solo by Santiago , who repeats the melody three times , to bridge the chorus and second verse . The second verse and chorus follow the same format . At the end of the second chorus , Francis shouts " Rock me Joe ! " ; Santiago then begins a guitar solo lasting seventeen seconds , with backing violins for the second half of the solo . 
 After the solo , Francis sings " If man is five " several times . There is no backing , apart from the lead guitar , for several seconds , but then the song 's chord progression is heard again . This is repeated for " If the devil is six " . At the end of the second chord progression , the song 's main backing restarts again , with Francis screaming " Then God is seven " as the chorus approaches . The final repeated chorus of " This monkey 's gone to heaven " ends the song as the string section becomes more prominent . 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 The band 's parts were recorded at Downtown Recorders in Boston , Massachusetts . The string section of " Monkey Gone to Heaven " was recorded while Doolittle was being mixed at Carriage House Studios in Stamford , Connecticut . Gil Norton , the album 's producer , was inspired to add a string section to the song after seeing Deal plucking the strings of a grand piano during recording . The production team , led by Norton , asked the studio owner John <unk> to bring in string players for one evening session . The studio was often used for recording orchestral scores for B @-@ movies such as Missing in Action and Silver Bullet . <unk> hired four classical musicians from a local orchestra for the recording , with the session taking place on the afternoon of December 4 , 1988 . 
 Arthur Fiacco , a cellist , arrived at Carriage House first . He was dressed in formal black and white attire , having traveled from an afternoon concert . Fiacco was surprised to find there were no scores written for the musicians to play ; he then wrote a part based on riffs Francis had shown him . The violinists , Corinne Metter and Karen Karlsrud , also followed the directions of Francis and Norton . Another cellist , Ann Rorich , credited on the album and single , was sent home ; according to Fiacco he doubled her parts .

 In general , " Monkey Gone to Heaven " received a positive critical reaction . British magazine NME , reviewing the UK 7 " single in March 1989 , said : " All the smart bastards are mixing strings with grunge guitars nowadays and the Pixies are no exception . <unk> vocals , sci @-@ fi lyrics , and the usual molten lava flow of guitars burn another crater where your ears used to be . ' Monkey Gone to Heaven ' pukes acid and poetry into America 's AOR heartland before being splattered by the faster and more direct sting of the second track ' Manta Ray ' . " Upon the release of Doolittle in April 1989 , NME 's Edwin Pouncey added : " the wonderful ' Monkey Gone to Heaven ' is laced with lush but unobtrusive strings which nibble round the edge of the song and push it into a new realm of arrangement for the band . The opportunity to give ' Monkey ' the full Philharmonic treatment , complete with heavenly harp , must have been a temptation to them . Wisely such a folly has been resisted . " 
 Q , in their review of Doolittle , described " Monkey Gone to Heaven " : " It 's not pretty , but its carefully structured noise and straight forward rhythmic insistence makes perfect sense : a gut feeling that is doubled when it gets within sniffing distance of a tune , as on ' Monkey Gone to Heaven ' or ' Debaser ' . " Rolling Stone 's David Fricke , reviewing Doolittle , said " Monkey Gone to Heaven " was " a corrosive , compelling meditation on God and garbage . " The critical success of " Monkey Gone to Heaven " was also reflected commercially ; the song reached number five on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart , marking the Pixies ' debut in the American charts . However , the song did not perform as well in the British charts , reaching a peak position of number 60 and falling off the charts after three weeks .

 = A.M. ( Wilco album ) = 
 A.M. is the debut album of Chicago @-@ based alternative rock band Wilco , released on March 28 , 1995 . The album was released only months after the breakup of Uncle Tupelo , an alternative country band that was the predecessor of Wilco . Prior to the release of the album , there was debate about whether the album would be better than the debut album of Son Volt , the new band of former Uncle Tupelo lead singer Jay Farrar . 
 Although A.M. was released before Son Volt 's Trace , critical reviews were modest and initial sales were low . The album was later regarded as a " failure " by band members , as Trace became a greater commercial success . It was the band 's last album to be recorded in a purely alternative country style , as following the record the band began to expand their sound across multiple genres . It is also the only Wilco album to feature Brian Henneman of The Bottle Rockets as a lead guitarist . 
 = = Context and recording = = 
 Uncle Tupelo 's last album , Anodyne , featured a new lineup for the band — a five @-@ piece outfit with drummer Ken Coomer , bassist John Stirratt , and multi @-@ instrumentalist Max Johnston . Tensions mounted between singers Jay Farrar and Jeff Tweedy , and Uncle Tupelo played its last concert on May 1 , 1994 at Mississippi Nights in St. Louis , Missouri . 
 Only days after the breakup , Tweedy decided to form a new group . He was able to retain the lineup of Uncle Tupelo sans Farrar , and rechristened the band Wilco . In mid @-@ May , the band began to rehearse songs in the office of band manager Tony Margherita , and hired producer Brian Paulson , who produced Anodyne . Wilco first recorded demo tracks for the album at Easley studio in Memphis , Tennessee in June . Stirratt recommended the studio based on previous experience as a member of The <unk> , and Tweedy had heard of the studio through a Jon Spencer Blues Explosion recording . Reprise Records , a subsidiary of Warner Brothers , signed Jeff Tweedy after hearing the tapes , and recording for the album continued through August . 
 Jeff Tweedy was preoccupied with trying to establish Wilco as a viable band on the Reprise label and decided to add another guitarist to the band . Brian Henneman , the lead singer for The Bottle Rockets , was brought into the recording sessions as a lead guitarist . Steel guitarist Lloyd Maines and bassist Daniel Corrigan also contributed to the album . Corrigan also photographed the band for the liner booklet . Howie Weinberg mastered the album , while Barbara Longo provided graphic design . Brian Henneman had to leave the band shortly after recording the album , and was replaced by former Titanic Love Affair guitarist Jay Bennett . Tweedy also attempted to create a more collaborative environment than Uncle Tupelo , requesting songwriting contributions from other members . John Stirratt submitted three songs , hoping to become a secondary songwriter for Wilco . However , although the songs were recorded as demos , only one ( " It 's Just That Simple " ) was selected to appear on the album , and was the only Stirratt song and the only song by Wilco song not to have lyrics by Tweedy to appear on any Wilco album . 
 The album 's title is intended to reference Top 40 radio stations , and the tracks reflect a straightforward country @-@ rock sound . The band members felt that they needed to establish themselves outside of the Tupelo fanbase . However , Tweedy later stated that in actuality , they were " trying to tread some water with a perceived audience . " Tweedy wrote a song about the Uncle Tupelo breakup , but decided that he didn 't want any material on that subject matter to appear on the album . ( It can be argued , however , that first single " Box Full of Letters " , as well as " Too Far Apart " allude to the dissolution of Farrar and Tweedy 's friendship and working relationship . ) Critic and author Greg Kot wrote in Wilco : Learning How to Die that " Tweedy 's voice and personality are as modest as the arrangements ; there 's little sense of drama , and virtually no hint of risk . Tweedy attributes some of the straightforwardness of the album to his abuse of marijuana at the time . Shortly after the album , Tweedy stopped smoking pot , to which he credits the <unk> of further albums . 
 While Wilco was recording tracks , Jay Farrar formed a band of his own , Son Volt . Son Volt signed to Warner Bros. Records and began recording their first album ( also produced by Paulson ) , Trace , in November 1994 . The fact that both Wilco and Son Volt began working on album almost immediately after the Uncle Tupelo breakup caused debate among critics , fans , and Warner Brothers about which would be the better band . Joe McEwen , who originally signed Uncle Tupelo to a Warner subsidiary , felt that Wilco was taking a step backwards from the material on Anodyne . McEwen urged Richard Dodd , who had recently mixed Tom Petty 's Wildflowers , to remix the album . Dodd emphasized Tweedy 's vocals to increase the chances of success on radio . 
 Wilco began touring before the album was released . Their live debut was on November 27 , 1994 at Cicero 's Basement Bar in St. Louis , a venue where Uncle Tupelo had first received significant media attention . The band was billed for that concert as Black Shampoo , a reference to a 1970s B @-@ movie , and the show sold out . Wilco continued to tour for two hundred shows , culminating in show at the South by Southwest Music Conference in Austin , Texas in March 1995 . A.M. was released on Reprise Records on March 28 , 1995 . 
 = = Commercial and critical reception = = 
 A.M. received modest reviews from critics . Holly George @-@ Warren of Rolling Stone called the album " one hell of a country @-@ guts debut " , praising the influence of Gram Parsons and Neil Young on the music . However , the album still received a moderate three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half star rating . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic enjoyed " I Must Be High " , noting that Wilco can " subvert the [ alternative country ] genre without losing its accessibility " , but felt that the following songs were disappointing . However , fellow Allmusic critic Matthew Greenwald found the album to be " brilliant and underrated . " Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave the album a three @-@ star honorable mention , but called it " realist defiance grinding sadly down into realist bathos . " The Village Voice placed the album at position 34 on the 1995 Pazz & Jop critics poll . The band was disappointed by the critical reception , since Trace was met with better reviews . According to Henneman : 
 A.M. only hit number 27 on Billboard 's Heatseekers chart , whereas Trace peaked at number 116 on the Billboard 200 ; by 1997 , Trace had outsold A.M. two @-@ to @-@ one . Wilco released " Box Full of Letters " as a single , but it received little airplay . For the only time in Wilco 's career , ticket sales failed to meet expectations . As of 2003 , the album had sold about 150 @,@ 000 copies .

 = Typhoon Isa = 
 Typhoon Isa was the first of eleven super @-@ typhoons to occur during the 1997 Pacific typhoon season . The second tropical cyclone of the season , Isa developed from a disturbance in the monsoon trough near the Caroline Islands on April 12 . It moved erratically at first , though after attaining tropical storm status it curved westward due to the subtropical ridge to its north . Isa very gradually intensified , and on April 20 the typhoon reached peak 1 @-@ min winds of 270 km / h ( 165 mph ) , as reported by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ; Japan Meteorological Agency reported maximum 10 @-@ min winds of 155 km / h ( 100 mph ) . After turning northward , it accelerated to the northeast , and merged with a larger extratropical cyclone on April 24 . 
 Early in its duration , Isa caused light rainfall and moderate winds on Pohnpei . Later , a stationary rainband from the typhoon dropped heavy precipitation on Guam during its dry season . Damage in the Guam National Weather Service area of responsibility totaled $ 1 million ( 1997 USD , $ 1 @.@ 3 million 2006 USD ) , the majority of it from crop damage . No deaths were reported . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 In early April , the monsoon trough established itself across Micronesia near the equator . An area of convection within the trough developed in the Caroline Islands on April 9 , and resembled the characteristics of a monsoon depression . Shortly thereafter , a large , yet weak low @-@ level circulation formed within the system . The system drifted erratically for several days as it slowly organized ; the system underwent several cycles of developing and losing convection . On April 11 , the system maintained a persistent area of well @-@ organized deep convection , and subsequent to an increase in upper @-@ level outflow , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) classified the system as Tropical Depression 02W at 1800 UTC on April 11 . Strong influence from the monsoonal westerlies left the depression drifting and slowly executing a loop to the northwest . Based on sufficient satellite classifications , JTWC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Isa early on April 12 while it was located 105 km ( 65 mi ) of Pohnpei . The Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) simultaneously classified the system as a tropical depression , and upgraded it to a tropical storm early on April 13 . 
 With the subtropical ridge to its north , Isa tracked to the north and gradually curved to the west . It slowly intensified , due to it being a large tropical cyclone , and late on April 13 JTWC upgraded the storm to typhoon status ; at the same time , JMA continued to assess Isa as a minimal tropical storm , and did not upgrade it to a typhoon until April 16 . Isa maintained a nearly due @-@ westward movement , although tropical cyclone prediction models anticipated a quick turn to the north . The JTWC recognized the northward model bias , which was described as under @-@ analyzing the strength of the subtropical ridge . By April 16 , the typhoon attained the equivalence of a Category 3 tropical cyclone on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale , and despite a potential threat to Guam the typhoon remained 260 km ( 160 mi ) south of the island . It gradually curved to the north , and on April 20 JTWC classified Super Typhoon Isa as reaching peak 1 @-@ min winds of 270 km / h ( 165 mph ) . At this point , Isa became an annular typhoon , with a large eye and a lack of <unk> rainbands , while moving nearly due northward , through a weakness in the subtropical ridge . Simultaneously , JMA assessed the typhoon as attaining peak 10 @-@ min winds of 155 km / h ( 100 mph ) . 
 Shortly after peaking in intensity , Isa began to weaken , and by April 21 it dropped below " super typhoon " status . It accelerated to the northeast under the flow of the mid @-@ latitudes , and the typhoon weakened more rapidly ; JMA downgraded Isa to a tropical storm on April 22 , which was followed suit by the JTWC the next day as upper @-@ level wind shear increased . At 0600 UTC on April 23 , the JTWC issued the last advisory on the system , and the next day JMA classified Isa dissipated as it became absorbed by a cloud band from a large extratropical cyclone to the east of Japan . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Isa first affected Pohnpei as a tropical storm on April 12 . While passing near the island , the storm produced moderate winds across the island , peaking at 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) . The winds downed several trees and tree limbs which destroyed 40 % of the island 's power lines . A few buildings reported roof damage . About 15 % of the crops on Pohnpei were damaged , including losses to the banana and breadfruit crops . After the passage of the typhoon , President of the Federated States of Micronesia Jacob Nena declared Pohnpei as a major disaster area due to the damage from Typhoon Isa and subsequent flooding ; on April 20 heavy rainfall caused widespread mudslides and 19 fatalities on the island , though they were not related to Isa . 
 In Guam , the threat of Typhoon Isa postponed a flight from Guam to Honolulu , Hawaii for 48 hours . The flight was the last in Operation Pacific Haven , which was a multimillion @-@ dollar humanitarian effort to transport more than 6 @,@ 600 Kurds in a political asylum to the mainland of the United States . The threat of the typhoon also canceled the first round of the Omega Tour golf event , which was the second professional golf tournament in the island 's history . Though Typhoon Isa passed well to the south of Guam , one of its outer rainbands stalled across the island , which dropped heavy rainfall of 15 – 25 cm ( 6 – 10 in ) across the island . The rainfall was welcome as it occurred during the dry season , and largely contributed to rainfall at the Guam International Airport being 45 % above normal from the period between January through April . The rainband also produced wind gusts that reached 86 km / h ( 53 mph ) at the island 's Naval Air Station ; the winds resulted in sporadic power outages across the island . The typhoon caused some light damage to buildings , particularly on the south side of the island . The combination of winds and sea salt caused damage to the island 's tomato , okra , cucumber , and soy bean crops . 
 Typhoon Isa later dropped light rainfall on the island of Rota . Across its path , damage from the storm totaled over $ 1 million ( 1997 USD , $ 1 @.@ 3 million 2006 USD ) . No deaths or injuries were reported .

 The Lesser Antillean macaw or Guadeloupe macaw ( Ara guadeloupensis ) is a hypothetical extinct species of macaw that is thought to have been endemic to the Lesser Antillean island region of Guadeloupe . In spite of the absence of conserved specimens , many details about the Lesser Antillean macaw are known from several contemporary accounts , and the bird is the subject of some illustrations . Austin Hobart Clark described the species on the basis of these accounts in 1905 . Due to the lack of physical remains , and the possibility that sightings were of macaws from the South American mainland , doubts have been raised about the existence of this species . A phalanx bone from the island of Marie @-@ Galante confirmed the existence of a similar @-@ sized macaw inhabiting the region prior to the arrival of humans , and was correlated with the Lesser Antillean macaw in 2015 . Later that year , historical sources distinguishing between the red macaws of Guadeloupe and the scarlet macaw ( A. macao ) of the mainland were identified , further supporting its validity . 
 According to contemporary descriptions , the body of the Lesser Antillean macaw was red and the wings were red , blue and yellow . The tail feathers were between 38 and 51 cm ( 15 and 20 in ) long . Apart from the smaller size and the all @-@ red coloration of the tail feathers , it resembled the scarlet macaw and may therefore have been a close relative of that species . The bird ate fruit – including the poisonous manchineel , was monogamous , nested in trees and laid two eggs once or twice a year . Early writers described it as being abundant in Guadeloupe , but it was becoming rare by 1760 , and only survived in uninhabited areas . Disease and hunting by humans are thought to have eradicated it shortly afterwards . The Lesser Antillean macaw is one of 13 extinct macaw species that have been proposed to have lived in the Caribbean islands . Many of these species are now considered dubious because only three are known from physical remains , and there are no extant endemic macaws on the islands today . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The Lesser Antillean macaw is well @-@ documented compared to most other extinct Caribbean macaws , since it was mentioned and described by several contemporary writers . Parrots thought to be the Lesser Antillean macaw were first mentioned by the Spanish historian Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés in 1553 , referring to a 1496 account by the Spanish bibliographer Ferdinand Columbus , who mentioned chicken @-@ sized parrots — which the Island Caribs called " Guacamayas " — in Guadeloupe . In 1774 , the French naturalist Comte de Buffon stated that the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus had found macaws in Guadeloupe . The French botanist Jean @-@ Baptiste Du Tertre gave the first detailed descriptions in 1654 and 1676 , and illustrated the bird and other animals found in Guadeloupe . The French clergyman Jean @-@ Baptiste Labat also described the bird in 1742 . Writers such as George Edwards and John Latham also mentioned the presence of red and blue macaws on the islands off America . 
 The American zoologist Austin Hobart Clark gave the Lesser Antillean macaw its scientific name , Ara guadeloupensis , in 1905 , based on the contemporary accounts , and he also cited a 1765 color plate as possibly depicting this species . He wrote that it was different in several ways from the superficially similar scarlet macaw ( A. macao ) , as well as the green @-@ winged macaw ( A. <unk> ) and the Cuban macaw ( A. tricolor ) . Clark suggested the species might have existed on the islands of Dominica and Martinique , based on accounts of red macaws there , as well as on Guadeloupe . In his 1907 book Extinct Birds , the British zoologist Walter Rothschild instead claimed each island had its own species , and that the Lesser Antillean macaw was confined to Guadeloupe . In 1967 , the American ornithologist James Greenway wrote that the macaws reported from Guadeloupe could have been imported to the region from elsewhere by the native population , but this is difficult to prove . Greenway also suggested that the scarlet macaw and the Cuban macaw formed a superspecies with the Lesser Antillean macaw and other hypothetical extinct species suggested for Jamaica and Hispaniola . According to the English paleontologist Julian Hume , the similarity between the Lesser Antillean macaw and the scarlet macaw indicates that they were close relatives , and that the Guadeloupe species may have descended from the mainland macaw . 
 A small parrot ulna found on the Folle Anse archaeological site on Marie @-@ Galante , an island in the Guadeloupe region , was assigned to the Lesser Antillean macaw by the ornithologists Matthew Williams and David Steadman in 2001 . In 2008 , the ornithologists Storrs Olson and Edgar Maíz López cast doubt upon this identification , and proposed that the bone instead belonged to the extant imperial amazon ( Amazona imperialis ) . The size and robustness of the bone was similar to ulnae of the imperial amazon , and though it was worn , the authors identified what appeared to be a notch , which is also present on ulnae of the genus Amazona , but not in the genus Ara . Subfossil remains from the island of Montserrat have also been suggested to belong to the Lesser Antillean macaw . The species was recognized by Birdlife International and the IUCN Red List until 2013 , but was not considered valid thereafter . 
 In 2015 , a terminal phalanx bone ( ungual claw bone ) attributable to the genus Ara from south @-@ western Marie @-@ Galante was described by ecologists Monica Gala and Arnaud Lenoble . It was discovered in the Blanchard Cave during excavations in 2013 @-@ 2014 , in a fossil @-@ bearing deposit dating to the late Pleistocene epoch . The deposit was radiocarbon dated to about 10 @,@ 690 years ago ; the earliest evidence of human settlement in the area has been dated to 5 @,@ 300 years ago . This confirmed that the Guadeloupe region once had an endemic macaw which could not have been brought there by humans . All other macaw bones from the Lesser Antillean islands have been recovered from archaeological sites , and could therefore have been the remains of birds brought there by Amerindians . The size of the phalanx bone matched what was described for the Lesser Antillean macaw by contemporary writers , and the authors therefore correlated the two . They conceded that this connection could only be tentative , as there were no remains of the Lesser Antillean macaw to compare with . 
 Later in 2015 , Lenoble reviewed overlooked historical Spanish and French sources , finding references to mainly red macaws consistent with the Lesser Antillean macaw . The writings of the French missionary Raymond Breton ( on Guadeloupe from 1635 to 1654 ) were especially illuminating , as they showed that both he and the native Island Caribs clearly distinguished between the red macaws of Guadeloupe and the scarlet macaws from the mainland , which supports the idea that the Lesser Antillean macaw represents an independent species . As the Lesser Antillean Carib language had different words reserved for men and women , Breton gave the name of the bird as Kínoulou ( <unk> ) and Caarou ( ♀ ) . Lenoble furthermore concluded that the supposed violet macaw ( named Anodorhynchus purpurascens based on accounts of blue parrots from Guadeloupe ) was based on misidentified references to the also @-@ extinct Guadeloupe amazon ( Amazona violacea ) , and therefore never existed . 
 As many as 13 now @-@ extinct species of macaw have variously been suggested to have lived on the Caribbean islands , but many of these were based on old descriptions or drawings and only represent hypothetical species . In addition to the Lesser Antillean macaw , only two endemic Caribbean macaw species are known from physical remains ; the Cuban macaw is known from 19 museum skins and subfossils , and the Saint Croix macaw ( A. autochthones ) is known only from subfossils . Macaws are known to have been transported between the Caribbean islands and from mainland South America to the Caribbean both in historic times by Europeans and native peoples , and in prehistoric times by Paleoamericans . Parrots were important in the culture of native Caribbeans , and were among the gifts offered to Christopher Columbus when he reached the Bahamas in 1492 . Historical records of macaws on these islands , therefore , may not have represented distinct , endemic species ; it is also possible that these macaws were escaped or feral birds that had been transported to the islands from elsewhere . All the endemic Caribbean macaws were likely driven to extinction by humans in historic and prehistoric times . The identity and distribution of indigenous macaws in the Caribbean is only likely to be further resolved through paleontological discoveries and examination of contemporary reports and artwork . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Lesser Antillean macaw was described as having similar coloration to the scarlet macaw , but with shorter tail feathers between 38 and 51 cm ( 15 and 20 in ) long . In contrast , the tail feathers of the scarlet macaw are 61 cm ( 2 ft ) long and have blue tips , and the outer feathers are almost entirely blue . In spite of the tail feathers being shorter , it is not certain whether the Lesser Antillean macaw was smaller than the scarlet macaw overall , as the relative proportions of body parts vary between macaw species . The tail feathers were longer than those of the Cuban macaw , which were 30 cm ( 12 in ) long . The morphology of the fossil phalanx bone from Marie @-@ Galante was most similar to the second or third ungual of the scarlet macaw , though the bone is slightly smaller at 15 @.@ 3 mm ( 0 @.@ 60 in ) compared to 15 – 17 mm ( 0 @.@ 59 – 0 @.@ 67 in ) . 
 Du Tertre described the Lesser Antillean macaw as follows in 1654 : 
 The Macaw is the largest of all the parrot tribe ; for although the parrots of Guadeloupe are larger than all other parrots , both of the islands and of the main land , the Macaws are a third larger than they ... The head , neck , underparts , and back are flame color . The wings are a mixture of yellow , azure , and scarlet . The tail is wholly red , and a foot and a half long . 
 Though Clark converted Du Tertre 's tail measurement to 18 in ( 45 @.@ 7 cm ) , Lenoble pointed out that a 17th @-@ century French foot unit was slightly larger than the English equivalent , and the measurement should rather be converted to 19 @.@ 3 in ( 49 cm ) , indicating a smaller size difference between the Lesser Antillean macaw and the scarlet macaw . 
 In 1742 , Labat described the macaw in much the same way as Du Tertre , while adding several details : 
 It is the size of a full grown fowl . The feathers of the head , neck , back and underparts are flame color ; the wings are of a mixture of blue , yellow and red ; the tail , which is from fifteen to twenty inches in length is wholly red . The head and the beak are very large , and it walks gravely ; it talks very well , if it is taught when young ; its voice is strong and distinct ; it is amiable and kind , and allows itself to be caressed ... 
 Both authors wrote that the macaws were the largest parrots of Guadeloupe , and stressed that the parrots of each Caribbean island were distinct , and could be differentiated both based on their morphology and their vocalizations . According to Hume , this means that the birds described could not simply have been escaped South American macaws . Furthermore , the docile and amiable nature described by Du Tertre and Labat does not match the behavior of South American macaws . 
 Breton 's mid @-@ 1600s accounts of the macaw confirmed it as distinct from mainland scarlet macaws : 
 Macaws are larger than parrots , with a very beautiful red plumage mixed with purple in the tail and wings ... Macaws found on islands are called Kínoulou , f . Caarou . <unk> is found on the continent , and is redder and more elegant than the island variety . 
 Apart from Du Tertre 's crude 1667 drawing and Labat 's 1722 derivative , a few contemporary paintings depict red macaws that may be the Lesser Antillean macaw . A color plate accompanying a 1765 volume of Buffon 's encyclopaedia Histoire Naturelle ( no . 12 in Planches <unk> , entitled L 'Ara Rouge ) shows a red macaw with entirely red tail feathers and more red on the tertial and scapular feathers of the wing than are present on the scarlet macaw . Copies of the plate differ in the nuances used , but are identical in pattern . The painting suggests that a specimen may have been present in Europe at the time . The Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus cited the plate in his 1766 description of the scarlet macaw , but his description does not match the bird shown . A 1626 painting by the Dutch artist Roelant Savery , which also includes a dodo , shows a red macaw that agrees with the descriptions of the Lesser Antillean macaw . A second macaw in the painting may be the hypothetical extinct Martinique macaw ( A. martinicus ) , but though many parrots were imported into Europe at the time from all over the world , it is impossible to determine the accuracy of such paintings today .
