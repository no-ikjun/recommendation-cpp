 = Rogers Hornsby = 
 Rogers Hornsby , Sr. ( April 27 , 1896 – January 5 , 1963 ) , nicknamed " The Rajah " , was an American baseball infielder , manager , and coach who played 23 seasons in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) . He played for the St. Louis Cardinals ( 1915 – 1926 , 1933 ) , New York Giants ( 1927 ) , Boston Braves ( 1928 ) , Chicago Cubs ( 1929 – 1932 ) , and St. Louis Browns ( 1933 – 1937 ) . Hornsby had 2 @,@ 930 hits and 301 home runs in his career ; his career .358 batting average is second only to Ty Cobb 's average . He was named the National League ( NL ) ' s Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) twice , and was a member of one World Series championship team . 
 Born and raised in Texas , Hornsby played for several semi @-@ professional and minor league teams . In 1915 , he began his major league career with the St. Louis Cardinals and remained with the team for 12 seasons ; during this period , Hornsby won his first MVP Award and the Cardinals won the 1926 World Series . After that season , he spent one season with the New York Giants and another with the Boston Braves before being traded to the Chicago Cubs . He played with the Cubs for four years and won his second MVP Award before the team released him in 1932 . Hornsby re @-@ signed with the Cardinals in 1933 , but was released partway through the season and was picked up by the St. Louis Browns . He remained there until his final season in 1937 . From 1925 to 1937 , Hornsby was intermittently his own manager . After retiring as a player , he managed the Browns in 1952 and the Cincinnati Reds from 1952 to 1953 . 
 Hornsby is one of the best hitters of all time . His career batting average of .358 is second only to Ty Cobb , at .367 , in MLB history . He also won two Triple Crowns and batted .400 or more three times during his career . He is the only player to hit 40 home runs and bat .400 in the same year ( 1922 ) . His batting average for the 1924 season was .424 , a mark that no player has matched since . He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1942 and the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame in 2014 . 
 Hornsby married three times , in 1918 , 1924 , and 1957 , and had two children , one from each of his first two marriages . 
 Known as someone difficult to get along with , he was not at all well @-@ liked by his fellow players . He never smoked , drank , or went to the movies , but frequently gambled on horse races during his career . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Hornsby was born in Winters , Texas , the last of Ed and Mary ( Rogers ) Hornsby 's six children . When Hornsby was two years old , his father died of unknown causes . Four years later , the surviving <unk> moved to Fort Worth , Texas , so Hornsby 's brothers could get jobs in the meat packing industry to support the family . 
 Hornsby started playing baseball at a very young age ; he once said , " I can 't remember anything that happened before I had a baseball in my hand . " He took a job with the Swift and Company meat industry plant as a messenger boy when he was 10 years old , and he also served as a substitute infielder on its baseball team . By the age of 15 , Hornsby was already playing for several semi @-@ professional teams . He also played baseball for North Side High School until 10th grade , when he dropped out to take a full @-@ time job at Swift and Company . While he was in high school , Hornsby also played on the football team , alongside future College Football Hall of Famer Bo McMillin . 
 = = Minor league career = = 
 In 1914 , Hornsby 's older brother Everett , a minor league baseball player for many years , arranged for Rogers to get a tryout with the Texas League 's Dallas Steers . He made the team , but did not play in any games for the Steers ; he was released after only two weeks . Following his dismissal , he signed with the Hugo Scouts of the Class D Texas – Oklahoma League as their shortstop for $ 75 per month ( $ 1 @,@ 772 today ) . The Scouts went out of business a third of the way through the season , and Hornsby 's contract was sold to the Denison Champions of the same league for $ 125 ( $ 2 @,@ 953 today ) . With both teams in 1914 , Hornsby batted .232 and committed 45 errors in 113 games . 
 The Denison team changed its name to the Denison Railroaders and joined the Western Association in 1915 . They raised Hornsby 's salary to $ 90 per month ( $ 2 @,@ 105 today ) . Hornsby 's average improved that season to .277 in 119 games , but he made 58 errors . Nonetheless , his contributions helped the Railroaders win the Western Association pennant . At the end of the season , a writer from The Sporting News said that Hornsby was one of about a dozen Western Association players to show any major league potential . 
 = = St. Louis Cardinals = = 
 = = = 1915 – 1919 = = = 
 Hornsby came to the attention of the St. Louis Cardinals during an exhibition series between that team and the Railroaders in spring training in 1915 . Cardinals ' manager Miller Huggins told his only scout , Bob Connery , to look for minor league players to fill the roster of their financially struggling team . In September , the Cardinals purchased Hornsby 's contract from Denison and added him to their major league roster , although his only professional baseball experience had been in Class D. Hornsby 's first game came on September 10 , when he relieved Art Butler at shortstop in a 7 – 1 loss to the Cincinnati Reds . Three days later he started a game , and he got his first hit the next day against Rube Marquard of the Brooklyn Robins . Hornsby finished the season with a .246 average in 57 at @-@ bats while the Cardinals finished in sixth place in the National League ( NL ) . At only 19 years old , Hornsby was the fourth @-@ youngest player in the NL that year . 
 The Cardinals picked up Roy Corhan from the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League to play at shortstop in 1916 , making Hornsby one of three candidates for the position . Hornsby 's great performance in spring training , a shoulder injury to Corhan , and poor hitting by Butler meant Hornsby was the starting shortstop on Opening Day . He had both runs batted in ( RBIs ) in the Cardinals ' 2 – 1 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates that day . On May 14 , he hit his first major league home run against Jeff Pfeffer of Brooklyn . He rotated among infield positions before finally settling in at third base for much of the second half of the year . Late in the season , he missed 11 games with a sprained ankle . He finished 1916 with a .313 average , fourth in the NL , and he was one short of the league lead in triples with 15 . 
 Hornsby returned to the shortstop position in 1917 after Corhan returned to San Francisco and Butler was released . After playing nearly every game throughout the first month of the season , Hornsby was called away from the team on May 29 after his brother William was shot and killed in a saloon . Rogers attended the funeral on June 1 and returned to the Cardinals on June 3 , finishing the season without missing any more playing time . His batting statistics improved from the previous season ; his .327 batting average was second in the league , and he led the league in triples ( 17 ) , total bases ( 253 ) , and slugging percentage ( .484 ) . 
 Many baseball players were drafted to fight in World War I in 1918 , but Hornsby was given a draft deferment because he was supporting his family . During the offseason , Miller Huggins , unhappy with the Cardinals ' management , left the team to manage the New York Yankees . He was replaced by Jack Hendricks , who had managed the Indianapolis Indians to a pennant in the American Association the previous year . Hornsby lacked confidence in Hendricks 's ability to run the Cardinals , and the two men developed animosity towards each other as a result of Hornsby 's growing egotism and fondness for former manager Huggins . Under Hendricks , Hornsby 's batting average dipped to .281 . He had problems off the field too ; on June 17 , Hornsby hit St. Louis resident Frank G. Rowe with his Buick when Rowe stepped out in front of traffic to cross an intersection . Rowe sued Hornsby for $ 15 @,@ 000 ( $ 235 @,@ 985 today ) , but Hornsby eventually settled for a smaller , undisclosed amount , and the case was dismissed . He was still among the league leaders in triples and slugging percentage in 1918 , but after the season ended with the Cardinals in last place , he announced that he would never play under Hendricks again . Partially due to Hornsby 's complaints , Hendricks was fired after the season and replaced by Branch Rickey , then president of the Cardinals . 
 In 1919 , after the Cardinals acquired shortstop Doc <unk> , Rickey tried converting Hornsby into a second baseman in spring training . Hornsby played third base for most of the year . His batting average was low at the beginning of the season but improved by June . At season 's end , his average of .318 was second @-@ highest in the league , and he also finished second in total bases and runs batted in . 
 = = = 1920 – 1926 = = = 
 In 1920 , Rickey moved Hornsby to second base , where he remained for the rest of his career . He started the year with a 14 @-@ game hitting streak . On June 4 , he had two triples and two RBIs as the Cardinals defeated the Chicago Cubs 5 – 1 , a game that ended future Hall of Famer Grover Cleveland Alexander 's 11 @-@ game winning streak . Hornsby finished the season with the first of seven batting titles by hitting .370 , and he also led the league in on @-@ base percentage ( .431 ) , slugging percentage ( .559 ) , hits ( 218 ) , total bases ( 329 ) , doubles ( 44 ) , and RBIs ( 94 ) . 
 The beginning of the live @-@ ball era led to a spike in hitting productivity throughout the majors , which helped Hornsby to hit with increased power during the 1921 season . He hit .397 in 1921 , and his 21 home runs were second in the league , more than twice his total in any previous season . He also led the league in on @-@ base percentage ( .458 ) , slugging percentage ( .639 ) , runs scored ( 131 ) , RBIs ( 126 ) , doubles ( 44 ) , and triples ( 18 ) . The Cardinals held a special day in Hornsby 's honor on September 30 before a home game against the Pittsburgh Pirates , and they presented Hornsby with multiple awards before the game , including a baseball autographed by President of the United States Warren G. Harding . The Cardinals beat the Pirates 12 – 4 that day as Hornsby hit a home run and had two doubles . 
 By the 1922 season , Hornsby was considered a big star , having led the league in batting average , hits , doubles , and runs batted in multiple times . As a result , he sought a three @-@ year contract for $ 25 @,@ 000 per season . After negotiating with Cardinals management , he settled for a three @-@ year , $ 18 @,@ 500 contract ( $ 261 @,@ 538 today ) , which made him the highest @-@ paid player in league history to that point . He then became the only player in history to hit over 40 home runs and bat over .400 in the same season . On August 5 , Hornsby set a new NL record when he hit his 28th home run of the season off of Jimmy Ring of the Philadelphia Phillies . From August 13 through September 19 , he had a 33 @-@ game hitting streak . He finished the year with a new record of 42 home runs , and he also set NL records in hits ( 250 ) and slugging percentage ( <unk> , the highest ever for 600 + at @-@ bat players ) . He won the first of his two Triple Crowns that year , and he led the league in batting average ( <unk> ) , RBIs ( 152 ) , on @-@ base percentage ( .459 ) , doubles ( 46 ) , and runs scored ( 141 ) . His 450 total bases was the highest mark for any NL player ever . On defense , Hornsby led all second basemen in putouts , double plays , and fielding percentage . His batting performance that year was , and still is , one of the finest in MLB history , and his 42 home runs are still the most ever for a .400 hitter . 
 On May 8 , 1923 , Hornsby suffered an injury to his left knee in a game against the Phillies when he turned to make a throw . He returned 10 days later , but the injury lingered , and he was removed from a game against the Pirates on May 26 to be examined by Robert Hyland , the Cardinals ' physician . Hyland had Hornsby 's knee placed in a cast for two weeks , after which he returned to the Cardinals . During a game in August , Hornsby was on third base late in the game and threw up his hands in disgust in response to a sign flashed by Rickey ; he had given the current batter the take sign , and Hornsby felt the batter should have hit the ball . After the game , he and Rickey fought in the clubhouse , but teammates quickly broke it up . Hornsby missed several games late in the year with injuries that the Cardinals ( and Hyland ) did not believe to be serious ; as a result he was fined $ 500 ( $ 6 @,@ 944 today ) and suspended for the last five games of the year . However , Hornsby still won his fourth consecutive NL batting title with a batting average of .384 . He also repeated as the leader in on @-@ base percentage ( .459 ) and slugging percentage ( <unk> ) . 
 Hornsby raised his average to .424 in 1924 , which is the sixth @-@ highest batting average in a single season in MLB history , and the live @-@ ball era batting average record . He led the league with 89 walks , producing a <unk> on @-@ base percentage . His slugging percentage of <unk> again led the league , as did his 121 runs scored , 227 hits , and 43 doubles ; he hit 25 home runs as well . That year , the NL reintroduced its Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) award . Although Hornsby was expected to win the award , it went to <unk> Vance instead . Cincinnati voter Jack Ryder left Hornsby 's name off his ballot altogether because he believed Hornsby was an MVP on the stat sheet , but was not a team player . In 1962 , the Baseball Writers ' Association of America presented Hornsby with an award retroactively recognizing him as the 1924 MVP . 
 In 1925 , Sam Breadon , the owner of the Cardinals , wished to replace Rickey as manager . Hornsby initially declined the job . After discovering that Rickey planned to sell his stock in the Cardinals if he was replaced as field manager , Hornsby agreed to take the job as long as Breadon would help him purchase the stock . Breadon agreed , and Hornsby became the Cardinals ' manager . Hornsby finished the year with his second Triple Crown , when he combined a .403 batting average with 39 home runs and 143 RBIs . He bested teammate Jim Bottomley in the batting title race by nearly 40 points . That year , he won the MVP Award , receiving 73 out of 80 possible votes . His <unk> slugging percentage set an NL record . The Cardinals finished in fourth place in 1925 , finishing one game over .500 , though the team won 64 games and lost 51 under Hornsby . During the year , his wife Jeanette had a son , Billy . 
 Hornsby had an off @-@ year offensively in 1926 , as he hit only .317 with 11 home runs . Nonetheless , St. Louis won its first NL pennant . In the 1926 World Series , the Cardinals defeated the Yankees in a seven @-@ game series ; Hornsby tagged out Babe Ruth on a stolen base attempt , ending the Series and giving St. Louis its first undisputed world championship . During post @-@ season negotiations for a new contract , Hornsby demanded $ 50 @,@ 000 per year for three years . Breadon agreed to a one @-@ year contract for $ 50 @,@ 000 ( $ 668 @,@ 327 today ) . When Hornsby refused to give way , the Cardinals traded him to the New York Giants for Frankie Frisch and Jimmy Ring on December 20 , 1926 . The trade was briefly postponed as NL president John Heydler stated that Hornsby could not play for the Giants while he held stock in the Cardinals . Hornsby wanted $ 105 per share for his stock , a price Breadon was unwilling to pay . In early 1927 , Hornsby was able to sell his shares at $ 105 each , enabling him to officially become a Giant . 
 = = New York Giants = = 
 Hornsby enjoyed a better season in 1927 , as he hit .361 and led the league in runs scored ( 133 ) , walks ( 86 ) , and on @-@ base percentage ( .448 ) . He managed the Giants for part of the year as well , as manager John McGraw dealt with health problems . Hornsby 's performance helped guide the Giants to a 92 – 62 win – loss record during the season , which was good enough for third place in the NL . However , Hornsby 's gambling problems at the racetrack and distrust of Giants ' management annoyed team owner Charles Stoneham . During the offseason he was traded to the Boston Braves for Jimmy Welsh and Shanty Hogan . 
 = = Boston Braves = = 
 With the Braves in 1928 , Hornsby was again the league 's most productive hitter ; he won his seventh batting title with a .387 average , also leading the league in on @-@ base percentage ( <unk> ) , slugging percentage ( <unk> ) , and walks ( 107 ) . One month into the season , manager Jack Slattery resigned , and the Braves hired Hornsby to be his replacement . The Braves , however , lost 103 games and finished in seventh place out of eight teams in the NL . They were struggling financially as well , and when the Chicago Cubs offered $ 200 @,@ 000 ( $ 2 @,@ 756 @,@ 202 today ) and five players for Hornsby , the Braves found the offer too good to pass up . 
 = = Chicago Cubs = = 
 Hornsby hit .380 in 1929 for Chicago while recording 39 home runs and leading the league with a <unk> slugging percentage and 156 runs scored ; the .380 batting average set a Cubs team record . He also collected another MVP award , and the Cubs won the NL pennant . However , they lost in the 1929 World Series to the Philadelphia Athletics in five games , as Hornsby batted .238 with one RBI . He also set a World Series record for strikeouts with eight . 
 After the first two months of the 1930 season , Hornsby was batting .325 with two home runs . In the first game of a doubleheader against the Cardinals , Hornsby broke his ankle while advancing to third base . He did not return until August 19 , and he was used mostly as a pinch @-@ hitter for the rest of the season . When Joe McCarthy was fired with four games remaining in the season Hornsby became the team 's manager . Hornsby finished the year with a .308 batting average and two home runs . 
 On April 24 , 1931 , Hornsby hit three home runs and drove in eight runs in a 10 – 6 victory over Pittsburgh . Hornsby played in 44 of the first 48 games , but after a disappointing performance he only played himself about half the time for the rest of the year . In 100 games , he had 90 RBIs , 37 doubles , and a batting average of .331 . He also led the league in on @-@ base percentage ( .421 ) for the ninth time in his career . The team finished 84 – 70 , 17 games back of the pennant @-@ winning Cardinals , and four games back of the Giants . 
 The 1931 season was Hornsby 's last as a full @-@ time player . <unk> on his feet bothered him during the start of the 1932 season , and he did not play his first game until May 29 . Hornsby played right field from May 29 to June 10 , appeared in two games as a pinch hitter , played third base from July 14 through July 18 , and played one last game as a Cub when he pinch @-@ hit on July 31 . 
 William Veeck , Sr. , who was running the team , was unhappy with Hornsby 's management of the team . Hornsby maintained strict rules , and Veeck thought his managing style hurt team morale . Veeck believed Hornsby broke a cardinal rule of baseball in one particular incident . Hornsby disagreed with a call made by the umpire . Instead of disputing the call himself , as was the manager 's job , Hornsby sent another player to argue with the umpire . That player was ejected from the game . On August 2 , although the Cubs were in second place , Hornsby was released , and Charlie Grimm replaced him as manager . Hornsby had played 19 games , batting .224 with one home run and seven RBIs . Although the Cubs advanced to the 1932 World Series , the players voted not to give Hornsby any of the World Series money . 
 = = St. Louis Cardinals and Browns = = 
 Hornsby did not play for the rest of 1932 , but the Cardinals signed him as a player on October 24 for the 1933 season . He played regularly at second base from April 25 through May 5 , but he was used mostly as a pinch hitter with the Cardinals . On July 22 , he had his final NL hit in a 9 – 5 loss to the Braves . Through July 23 , Hornsby was batting .325 with two home runs and 21 RBIs . However , the Cardinals chose to place him on waivers . 
 Hornsby was claimed by the last @-@ place St. Louis Browns of the American League ( AL ) on July 26 as player @-@ manager . Bill Killefer had just resigned as Browns manager , and Browns owner Phil Ball wanted Hornsby as a replacement . Hornsby appeared in 11 games for the Browns . He had three hits , including a home run , in nine at @-@ bats . The Browns finished in last place in the AL . That year , Hornsby began operating a baseball school in Hot Springs , Texas , which he ran on and off between 1933 and 1951 with various associates . 
 In 1934 , Hornsby started only two games , one at third base , and the other in right field . In all of his other appearances , he was a pinch hitter . For the season , he batted .304 with one home run and 11 RBIs . The Browns improved on their previous season , finishing in sixth place out of eight teams in the AL . 
 Hornsby played in 10 games in the 1935 season , starting in 4 . From April 16 through April 21 , he started at first base , and he started at third base on May 22 . He finished the year with five hits and a .208 average , while the Browns slipped to seventh place . 
 Hornsby only appeared in two games with the team during the 1936 season . On May 31 , his pinch @-@ hit single in the ninth inning gave the Browns an 11 – 10 win over the Detroit Tigers . In his other appearance on June 9 , he played first base in a 5 – 3 win over the Yankees . The Browns again finished in seventh place . 
 In 1937 , Hornsby played in 20 games . On April 21 , in his first game of the year , Hornsby hit the final home run of his career in a 15 – 10 victory over the Chicago White Sox . On July 5 , he had the final hit of his career in a 15 – 4 loss in the second game of a doubleheader with the Cleveland Indians . 
 On July 20 , Hornsby appeared in what would be his final game , a 5 – 4 loss to the Yankees . A day later , Hornsby was fired as manager and released as a player by the Browns , who were in last place at the time of his release . His release was partly due to an incident with Browns owner Donald Barnes . On July 15 , Hornsby won $ 35 @,@ 000 ( $ 576 @,@ 123 today ) from betting on a horse race . When he tried to use $ 4 @,@ 000 of this money to pay off a debt to Barnes , Barnes refused it , since it had come from a bookmaker . Hornsby protested to Barnes , " The money is as good as the money you take from people in the loan @-@ shark business . It 's better than taking interest from widows and orphans ... " ; that made his release five days later an easy decision for Barnes . Hornsby finished the 1937 season with a .321 batting average and 18 hits in 20 games , and was the oldest player in the AL that season .

 Before opening his own baseball school , Hornsby was an instructor at the " Roy Doan Baseball School " , which operated from 1934 @-@ 38 at Ban Johnson Park , Fogel Field and Majestic Park in Hot Springs , Arkansas , the site of many early Spring training facilities . Then , in 1939 , Hornsby , started the " Rogers Hornsby Baseball College " in Hot Springs after Doan moved his School elsewhere . Hornsby ran the six @-@ week event annually until 1952 , usually attracting 100 @-@ 200 prospects .

 Following his release from the Browns , Hornsby was unable to retire because he had lost so much money gambling over the years . He signed as a player @-@ coach with the Baltimore Orioles of the International League in 1938 before leaving them to play for and manage the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Southern Association for the rest of the season . Hornsby then returned to the Orioles to manage them for 1939 , but he did not return to the club following the season . Halfway through 1940 , he signed to manage the Oklahoma City Indians of the Texas League . He led them from last place to the Texas League playoffs , where they fell to the Houston Buffaloes in four games . Hornsby began 1941 managing the Indians once again , but he resigned in the middle of the season . In November , he became the general and field manager of the Fort Worth Cats , also of the Texas league . Fort Worth finished in third place and made the playoffs in 1942 , but they were eliminated in the first round by the Shreveport Sports . 
 Hornsby went unsigned by any team in 1943 , but he signed as a player @-@ manager with the Vera Cruz Blues of La Liga Mexicana in Mexico in 1944 . After hitting a game @-@ winning grand slam for the second win of a series in March , he resigned when the team owner complained that the win would diminish the crowd for the third game of the series . Following his release , he did some commentary for radio station <unk> , assisted the Cleveland Indians in spring training in 1947 , and became a TV announcer for Chicago Cubs games in 1949 . 
 Hornsby did not become a manager or coach again until 1950 , when he was hired to manage the Texas League 's Beaumont Roughnecks . Beaumont won the pennant , but they were swept in the first round of the playoffs by the San Antonio Missions . The next year , in 1951 , Hornsby managed the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League . Under Hornsby 's leadership , the Rainiers won the pennant . 
 In 1952 , Hornsby was again hired to manage the St. Louis Browns , his first major league job in 16 years . The Browns ' owner , Bill Veeck , was the son of former Cubs president and general manager William Veeck , Sr. Hornsby was not well received by the players , however . On June 9 , he was fired due to a disagreement with Veeck over an incident against the Yankees the day before . During the game , a fan prevented Gil McDougald of the Yankees from catching a fly ball , and the umpire ruled that it was fan interference . Hornsby did not initially argue the call , and a few minutes later Veeck forced him to do it ( when it was already too late to do anything about it ) . This led to Hornsby and the Browns parting ways . The Browns players were so happy about Hornsby 's firing that they gave Veeck an engraved trophy to thank him . 
 A little over a month later , on July 26 , Hornsby was hired to replace Luke Sewell as manager of the Cincinnati Reds . After Hornsby completed two mediocre seasons with the club , the Reds announced that he would not return for 1954 . He finished his MLB managerial career with a record of 701 – 812 . Following his dismissal , Hornsby worked as a coach for the Chicago Cubs from 1958 to 1960 before becoming a scout and third base coach for the New York Mets in 1962 . In 1963 , Hornsby died of a heart attack . He was buried in Hornsby Bend Cemetery near Austin , Texas .

 Baseball experts and sportswriters consider Hornsby to be one of the greatest hitters of all time . His lifetime batting average of .358 is only exceeded by Ty Cobb 's career mark of .367 . He won seven batting titles in total , a feat tied or exceeded by only five players ( Cobb ( 11 or 12 , depending on the source ) , Tony Gwynn ( 8 ) , Honus Wagner ( 8 ) , Rod Carew ( 7 ) , and Stan Musial ( 7 ) ) . Hornsby led the National League in slugging percentage nine times , a record that still stands . He also hit more home runs , drove in more runs , and had a higher batting average than any other National League player during the 1920s , which makes him one of four players in baseball history ( along with Honus Wagner , Ted Williams , and Albert Pujols ) to win a decade " triple crown " . He hit a career total of 301 home runs and was the first National League player to hit 300 . His 264 home runs as a second baseman was a major league record for that position until Joe Morgan surpassed him in 1984 . Hornsby was also a very consistent hitter whether he was playing at home or on the road . His lifetime home batting average was .359 , and his lifetime away batting average was .358 . Ted Williams , who had the highest career batting average since Hornsby , said that Hornsby was the greatest hitter for power and average in baseball , and Frankie Frisch said of him , " He 's the only guy I know who could hit .350 in the dark . " Hornsby also holds second place on the unofficial major league record list of " consecutive games with two or more hits " with 13 games , first place honors going to Count <unk> 's 15 @-@ game streak . Hornsby is only the second right @-@ handed batter in history to hit over .400 three times and is considered , according to the Los Angeles Times , to be the greatest right @-@ handed hitter in history . He led the National League in batting average , on @-@ base percentage , slugging percentage , and total bases every year from 1920 to 1925 . He is one of only two players ( the other being Ted Williams ) to win the batting Triple Crown more than once , but only Hornsby batted .400 on both occasions . 
 Rogers Hornsby was so respected as a hitter that once , when a rookie pitcher complained to umpire Bill Klem that he thought he had thrown Rogers a strike , Klem replied , " Son , when you pitch a strike , Mr. Hornsby will let you know . " 
 Hornsby was also renowned for his speed , and was considered to be the fastest player in the National League in his prime . He did not try to steal very often but used his speed to take extra bases . Between 1916 and 1927 Hornsby had 30 inside @-@ the @-@ park home runs , and he led the league with 17 triples in 1917 and 18 triples in 1921 ; he had 20 triples in 1920 . 
 However , Hornsby was often hard to get along with , a major reason he changed teams so frequently in the last decade of his career . He usually left due to falling out with the front office . Most of the players he managed did not like him due to his insistence that others follow his lifestyle , although some ( like Woody English and Clint Courtney ) did . Hornsby never played cards , but he did bet frequently on horse races , and he lost more than he won . His gambling was often a factor in his dismissal from a team . By most contemporary accounts , he was at least as mean and nasty as Cobb , who was known in his time for his aggressive attitude and dirty play . He never went to movies or read books , convinced that it would harm a batter 's eyesight , and he never smoked or drank . 
 Hornsby was elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1942 . In 1999 , Hornsby was ranked ninth on The Sporting News list of Baseball 's Greatest Players . Later that year , he was named to the Major League Baseball All @-@ Century Team . In 2001 , writer Bill James ranked him as the 22nd @-@ greatest player and the third @-@ greatest second baseman in baseball history , while at the same time documenting his unpopularity and his difficult personality . He is also tied for eighth overall with Stan Musial in wins above replacement for position players . Hornsby has also been recognized on the St. Louis Walk of Fame In January , 2014 , the Cardinals announced Hornsby among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014 . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 On September 23 , 1918 , Hornsby married Sarah Elizabeth Martin , whom he had known since he played for the Denison Railroaders , in Philadelphia . They had a son , Rogers Hornsby , Jr . , on November 15 , 1920 . Rogers Jr. died in a plane crash on December 23 , 1949 near Savannah , Georgia . 
 During 1922 he began seeing Jeanette Pennington Hine , who was married to an automobile @-@ supply salesman named John Hine . On June 12 , 1923 , Hornsby divorced Sarah , and Hine divorced her spouse in 1923 as well ; the two were married on February 28 , 1924 . As a result of the divorce , Sarah took custody of Rogers Jr . 
 Hornsby and Jeanette had a son , Billy , on June 2 , 1925 . Billy played baseball for several years in the minor leagues , but never reached the majors . Hornsby and Jeanette became estranged in December 1944 , and Hornsby began seeing a woman named Bernadette Harris , whom he called his " personal good friend and secretary " , in 1945 . They lived together after 1948 , until Harris committed suicide by jumping out of a third @-@ story window on September 7 , 1953 . The suicide was attributed to depression . Following Jeanette 's death on June 1 , 1956 , Hornsby married Marjorie Bernice Frederick Porter on January 27 , 1957 . They remained together until Hornsby 's death in 1963 . 
 = The Great Milenko = 
 The Great Milenko is the fourth studio album by American hip hop group Insane Clown Posse , released on August 12 , 1997 , by Hollywood Records , in association with Psychopathic Records . As the fourth Joker 's Card in the group 's Dark Carnival mythology , the album 's lyrics focus on the titular Great Milenko , an illusionist who tries to trick individuals into greed and other such sins . 
 The album was recorded and initially released by the Disney @-@ owned record label Hollywood Records . The album was taken off shelves by Hollywood hours after its release , in response to criticism from the Southern Baptist Church of decisions that the church believed did not reflect Disney 's family @-@ friendly image , although Disney claimed that the album was released due to an oversight by its review board . After Hollywood terminated the group 's contract , Insane Clown Posse signed a new contract with Island Records ( whose parent at the time , PolyGram , distributed Hollywood releases in North America ) , which agreed to release the album as it was originally intended . 
 The music of The Great Milenko features a rock sound and features guest appearances by popular rock stars Alice Cooper , Steve Jones and Slash . Although the album was poorly received by critics , it debuted at number 63 on the Billboard charts , and was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) . It is the group 's 10th overall release .

 Following the 1994 release of the album Ringmaster , Insane Clown Posse started to attract a strong local following in Detroit , Michigan . The group began selling out large clubs such as St. Andrew 's Hall and the State Theater , and drew the attention of major record label Jive Records . The next year , Insane Clown Posse signed with the label Battery , a subsidiary Jive Records . Battery / Jive released the duo 's third studio album , Riddle Box ( 1995 ) , but showed little interest in promoting the album . The group 's manager Alex Abbiss negotiated a contract with the Disney 's Hollywood Records label , which reportedly paid $ 1 million to purchase the Insane Clown Posse contract from Battery / Jive Records . 
 The expansion of the Juggalo fanbase into its own culture inspired Insane Clown Posse to write the songs " What Is A Juggalo ? " and " Down With The Clown " for this album . 
 = = = Recording = = = 
 The group started recording The Great Milenko in 1996 , and Violent J began thinking of a title for the album shortly after . Bruce later came up with the title The Great Milenko . Bruce also admitted that he had always liked the ring name of professional wrestler Dean Simon ( " Dean Malenko " ) , because he felt that the name Malenko had a " carnival " sound to it . Believing that he had created the name himself , Bruce later realized that he had unwittingly used the nickname of Dean 's father , Boris " The Great " Malenko . 
 The band wanted to include famous rock stars on the album . Julian Raymond , the artists and repertoire representative for Hollywood Records contacted Slash , Steve Jones , and Alice Cooper . Slash , who was a self @-@ professed fan of the band 's music , reportedly only asked for Wild Irish Rose as payment for his contributions . Bruce , who knew very little about the Sex Pistols or Steve Jones , declined to show up at the studio when Jones played his guitar part for " Piggy Pie " . Although not knowing much about Alice Cooper either , Bruce decided to fly to Arizona and coach Cooper on his parts . Bruce and Clark also met George Clinton , who was staying in the same hotel , and recorded his voice in his room , but it did not fit anywhere on the album . 
 After the recording sessions were finished , executives at Hollywood Records — and the label 's parent company , Disney — expressed dissatisfaction with several tracks . Disney requested that the tracks " The Neden Game , " " Under the Moon , " and " Boogie Woogie Wu " be removed because of lyrics referencing abuse of women , rape and murder , and the slaughter of children , respectively . Disney also asked that the lyrics of " Piggy Pie " be changed , due to lyrics about murdering police officers . Disney threatened not to release the album if their requests were not met . <unk> , Bruce and Utsler complied with Disney 's requests . The uncensored version of " Piggy Pie " was later released on Forgotten Freshness Volumes 1 & 2 . After recording was finalized , the duo planned to go on a national tour with House of Krazees and Myzery as its opening acts . Several songs were recorded with the intention of releasing them on The Great Milenko . One such song , " House of Wonders " was recorded but was later released on Mutilation Mix ( 1997 ) and Forgotten Freshness Volumes 1 & 2 ( 1998 ) . 
 = = = Joker 's Cards = = = 
 The Great Milenko is the fourth Joker 's Card in Insane Clown Posse 's Dark Carnival concept album series . The Dark Carnival is a concept of the afterlife in which souls are sent to a form of limbo while waiting to be sent to heaven or hell based on their individual actions . These concepts are related by Insane Clown Posse in a series of albums called the six Joker 's Cards . Each of the six Joker 's Cards relate to a specific character — an entity of the Dark Carnival — that tries to " save the human soul " by showing the wickedness inside of one 's self . 
 This Joker 's Card is a necromancer and illusionist who tries to trick individuals into acts of greed , envy , and lust . The Card ultimately issues a warning against such acts of sin , and enlightens listeners that The Great Milenko is a part of every individual , and that they have the power to fall under his illusions or cast his hoaxes aside .

 The Great Milenko featured more rock influences than previous Insane Clown Posse albums , including an introduction performed by Alice Cooper and guitar tracks performed by Steve Jones ( on " <unk> Pie " ) , and Slash ( on " Halls of Illusions " ) . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic wrote , in his review of The Amazing Jeckel Brothers ( 1999 ) that , " The Great Milenko [ ... ] was targeted at white @-@ boy , adolescent metalheads -- really , how could any album that contained guest spots from Alice Cooper , Slash , Steve Jones and Legs Diamond be anything else ? " 
 Insane Clown Posse hired renowned Detroit record producer and DJ Mike E. Clark to produce the record . Clark made the album sound more rock @-@ oriented , as opposed to the duo 's earlier material , which featured a more prominent hip @-@ hop sound . To create the record , Clark utilized standard hip hop techniques such as record scratching , and mixed them with elements of rock and heavy metal .

 According to the group 's mythology , The Great Milenko is a necromancer and illusionist who tries to trick individuals into greed and other such sins . He takes out the worst in an individual and creates powerful illusions in an attempt to cause them to become hedonistic and greedy . An honorable individual must fight his magic in order to make it to Shangri @-@ La ( as revealed in the track " Pass Me By " ) . 
 The album 's themes mostly revolve around those of death , morality , and everyday decisions . For instance , " How Many Times ? " talks about annoying traffic jams and other everyday @-@ life inconveniences . " Piggy Pie " references the Three Little Pigs and tells Violent J 's story of murdering three kinds of people : an incest @-@ prone redneck , cops who wrongly arrest and harass people , and stuck @-@ up wealthy people . " Under the Moon " tells the tale of a man convicted after killing a man who tried to rape his girlfriend . " Boogie Woogie Wu " is told from the perspective of the boogie man and talks about the slaughter of children . The " Neden Game " takes the form of a Dating Game @-@ esque show , albeit with added misogynistic banter for humor . Finally , the lyrics to " <unk> " target money @-@ hungry preachers .

 Two singles were released from the album : " Halls of Illusions " and " Hokus Pokus . " " Halls of Illusions " was the first single released in 1997 .

 Initially , Hollywood Records shipped 100 @,@ 000 copies of The Great Milenko to various record stores . During a music @-@ store autograph signing , Insane Clown Posse was notified that Hollywood Records had deleted the album within hours of its release , despite having sold 18 @,@ 000 copies and reaching number 63 on the Billboard 200 . The group was also informed that its in @-@ store signings and 25 @-@ city nationwide tour had been canceled , commercials for the album and the music video for " Halls of Illusions " ( which had reached number one on The Box video request channel ) were pulled from television , and that the group was dropped from the label . It was later revealed that Disney was being criticized by the Southern Baptist Church at the time because of Disney 's promotion of Gay Days at Disneyland , in addition to producing and distributing the gay @-@ themed television sitcom Ellen . The church claimed Disney was turning its back on family values . Although Abbiss told the press that Disney had stopped production of The Great Milenko to avoid further controversy , Disney claimed instead that the release of the album was an oversight by their review board , and that the album " did not fit the Disney image " because of its " inappropriate " lyrics , which they claimed were offensive to women . Although Hollywood Records had ordered record stores to return shipments of the now @-@ deleted album , many record stores refused , including the Michigan @-@ based Harmony House where 1 @,@ 700 CDs were sold in 36 stores after the termination order . 
 After the termination of the Hollywood Records contract , labels such as Interscope and Geffen Records wanted to sign the group , but Island Records ' Chris Blackwell came to the group 's rescue and agreed to release The Great Milenko as it was originally intended . As part of the deal , Island also agreed to rerelease the group 's first two Joker 's Card albums . Milenko was released in four colors : red , green , purple , and gold . Each color had a different secret message that would help reveal the title of the fifth Joker 's Card , The Amazing Jeckel Brothers . Music videos were filmed for " Halls of Illusions , " " How Many Times , " and " Piggy Pie . " An unofficial music video for " Down with the Clown " was featured on the home @-@ video release Juggalo <unk> Wrestling Volume 1 . A music video for the <unk> Remix of " Hokus Pokus " was produced after the release of the album . The video featured appearances by Twiztid and Myzery . Blackwell left Island Records shortly after the group released Forgotten Freshness Volumes 1 & 2 , and the merger of PolyGram into Universal Music Group ( which owned Interscope and Geffen ) affected the way the label handled its next Joker 's Card release . Despite the rough start , The Great Milenko has sold well over the years . On May 5 , 1998 , the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) . A year later , on April 21 , 1999 , the album was certified platinum for shipments of over one million copies . As of 2007 , the album has sold over 1 @.@ 7 million copies in the United States .

 Reviews for The Great Milenko were generally very mixed reviews . Entertainment Weekly music critic David Browne gave the record a C @-@ minus rating : " [ With ] its puerile humor and intentionally ugly metal @-@ rap tunes , the album feels oddly dated . " Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that The Great Milenko is " the sort of record you wish they would take off the stereo at excruciating frat parties . " In The Great Rock Discography , Martin Charles Strong gave the album five out of ten stars . The album received two out of five stars in The New Rolling Stone Album Guide , in which Ben Sisario identified it as the album in which " the group came into its own " . 
 Although the reviews were mostly negative , some critics complimented the album 's improved sound over its precursors . Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that the album was " a better record than [ its ] predecessors , boasting a tougher sound and some actual hooks , without losing the juvenile vulgarity that pleased their following , " and added that " it is better than the rest of ICP 's work . " David Browne said that " Milenko is better produced than the duo 's earlier output ( Slash grinds out metal chords on Halls of Illusions ) , and Pass Me By is a genuinely melodic song . " In 2009 , Fangoria named The Great Milenko an iconic horrorcore album .

 Kerala ( / <unk> / ) , historically known as <unk> , is an Indian state in South India on the Malabar coast . It was formed on 1 November 1956 following the States Reorganisation Act by combining Malayalam @-@ speaking regions . Spread over 38 @,@ 863 km2 ( 15 @,@ 005 sq mi ) , it is bordered by Karnataka to the north and northeast , Tamil Nadu to the east and south , and the Lakshadweep Sea to the west . With 33 @,@ 387 @,@ 677 inhabitants as per the 2011 Census , Kerala is the thirteenth largest state by population and is divided into 14 districts with the capital being Thiruvananthapuram . Malayalam is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state . 
 The region has been a prominent spice exporter since 3000 BCE . The Chera Dynasty was the first prominent kingdom based in Kerala , though it frequently struggled against attacks by the neighbouring Cholas and Pandyas . In the 15th century , the spice trade attracted Portuguese traders to Kerala , and paved the way for the European colonisation of India . After independence , Travancore and Cochin joined the Republic of India and Travancore @-@ Cochin was given the status of a state in 1949 . In 1956 , Kerala state was formed by merging Malabar district , Travancore @-@ Cochin ( excluding four southern taluks ) , and the taluk of Kasargod , South Kanara . 
 Kerala has the lowest positive population growth rate in India , 3 @.@ 44 % ; highest Human Development Index ( HDI ) , 0 @.@ 790 in 2011 ; the highest literacy rate , 93 @.@ 91 % in the 2011 census ; the highest life expectancy , 77 years ; and the highest sex ratio , 1 @,@ 084 women per 1000 men . The state has witnessed significant emigration , especially to Arab states of the Persian Gulf during the Gulf Boom of the 1970s and early 1980s , and its economy depends significantly on remittances from a large Malayali expatriate community . Hinduism is practised by more than half of the population , followed by Islam and Christianity . The culture is a synthesis of Aryan and Dravidian cultures , developed over millennia , under influences from other parts of India and abroad . 
 The production of pepper and natural rubber contributes significantly to the total national output . In the agricultural sector , coconut , tea , coffee , cashew and spices are important . The state 's coastline extends for 595 kilometres ( 370 mi ) , and around 1 @.@ 1 million people in the state are dependent on the fishery industry which contributes 3 % to the state 's income . The state has the highest media exposure in India with newspapers publishing in nine languages , mainly English and Malayalam . Kerala is one of the prominent tourist destinations of India , with backwaters , beaches , Ayurvedic tourism and tropical greenery as its major attractions . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The name Kerala has an uncertain etymology . " <unk> " may stem from the Classical Tamil <unk> @-@ alam ( " declivity of a hill or a mountain slope " ) or <unk> alam ( " Land of the Cheras " ) . While " Kerala " may represent an imperfect Malayalam portmanteau fusing kera ( " coconut palm tree " ) and alam ( " land " or " location " ) . " Kerala " can also be derived from the word " Cheral " that refers to the oldest known dynasty of Kerala kings . The word " Cheral " is derived from the Proto @-@ Tamil @-@ Malayalam word for " lake " . 
 The earliest Sanskrit text to mention Kerala is the Aitareya Aranyaka of the Rigveda . It is also mentioned in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata , the two Hindu epics . The word Kerala is first recorded ( as Keralaputra , meaning <unk> <unk> or Cheraman ) in a 3rd @-@ century BCE rock inscription ( Rock Edict 2 ) left by the Maurya emperor Ashoka ( 274 – 237 BCE ) . The inscription refers to the local ruler as Keralaputra ( Sanskrit for " son of Kerala " ) ; or " son of Chera [ s ] " . This contradicts a popular theory that its etymology derives " Kerala " from " Kera " ( coconut tree in Malayalam ) . At that time , one of three states in the region was called <unk> in Classical Tamil : Chera and Kera are variants of the same word . The Greco @-@ Roman trade map Periplus Maris <unk> refers to Keralaputra as <unk> . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Mythology = = = 
 According to Hindu mythology , the lands of Kerala were recovered from the sea by the axe @-@ wielding warrior sage Parasurama , the sixth avatar of Vishnu , hence Kerala is also called Parasurama Kshetram ( " The Land of Parasurama " ) . Parasurama threw his axe across the sea , and the water receded as far as it reached . According to legend , this new area of land extended from Gokarna to Kanyakumari . The land which rose from sea was filled with salt and unsuitable for habitation ; so Parasurama invoked the Snake King Vasuki , who spat holy poison and converted the soil into fertile lush green land . Out of respect , Vasuki and all snakes were appointed as protectors and guardians of the land . The legend was later expanded , and found literary expression in the 17th or 18th century with <unk> , which traces the origin of aspects of early Kerala society , such as land tenure and administration , to the story of Parasurama . In medieval times Kuttuvan may have emulated the Parasurama tradition by throwing his spear into the sea to symbolise his lordship over it . 
 Another much earlier Puranic character associated with Kerala is Mahabali , an Asura and a prototypical just king , who ruled the earth from Kerala . He won the war against the Devas , driving them into exile . The Devas pleaded before Lord Vishnu , who took his fifth incarnation as Vamana and pushed Mahabali down to Patala ( the netherworld ) to placate the Devas . There is a belief that , once a year during the Onam festival , Mahabali returns to Kerala . The Matsya Purana , among the oldest of the 18 Puranas , uses the Malaya Mountains of Kerala ( and Tamil Nadu ) as the setting for the story of Matsya , the first incarnation of Vishnu , and Manu , the first man and the king of the region . 
 = = = Pre @-@ history = = = 
 A substantial portion of Kerala may have been under the sea in ancient times . Marine fossils have been found in an area near Changanacherry , thus supporting the hypothesis . Pre @-@ historical archaeological findings include dolmens of the Neolithic era in the <unk> area of the Idukki district . They are locally known as " <unk> " , derived from muni ( hermit or sage ) and ara ( dolmen ) . Rock engravings in the <unk> Caves , in Wayanad date back to the Neolithic era around 6000 BCE . Archaeological studies have identified Mesolithic , Neolithic and Megalithic sites in Kerala . The studies point to the development of ancient Kerala society and its culture beginning from the Paleolithic Age , through the Mesolithic , Neolithic and Megalithic Ages . Foreign cultural contacts have assisted this cultural formation ; historians suggest a possible relationship with Indus Valley Civilization during the late Bronze Age and early Iron Age . 
 = = = Ancient period = = = 
 Kerala has been a major spice exporter since 3000 BCE , according to Sumerian records and it is still referred to as the " Garden of Spices " or as the " Spice Garden of India " . Kerala 's spices attracted ancient Babylonians , Assyrians and Egyptians to the Malabar Coast in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE . Arabs and Phoenicians established trade with Kerala during this period . The Land of Keralaputra was one of the four independent kingdoms in southern India during Ashoka 's time , the others being Chola , Pandya , and <unk> . Scholars hold that Keralaputra is an alternate name of the Cheras , the first dominant dynasty based in Kerala . These territories once shared a common language and culture , within an area known as Tamilakam . While the Cheras ruled most of modern Kerala , its southern tip was in the kingdom of Pandyas , which had a trading port sometimes identified in ancient Western sources as Nelcynda ( or <unk> ) in Quilon . Later , the region fell under the control of the Pandyas , Cheras , and Cholas . <unk> and <unk> were two other dynasties of ancient Kerala , whose kingdoms lay to the south and north of Cheras respectively . 
 In the last centuries BCE the coast became important to the Greeks and Romans for its spices , especially black pepper . The Cheras had trading links with China , West Asia , Egypt , Greece , and the Roman Empire . In foreign @-@ trade circles the region was known as Male or Malabar . Muziris , <unk> , and Nelcynda were among the principal ports at that time . The value of Rome 's annual trade with the region was estimated at around 50 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 sesterces ; contemporary Sangam literature describes Roman ships coming to Muziris in Kerala , laden with gold to exchange for pepper . One of the earliest western traders to use the monsoon winds to reach Kerala was Eudoxus of Cyzicus , around 118 or 166 BCE , under the patronage of Ptolemy VIII , king of the Hellenistic Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt . Roman establishments in the port cities of the region , such as a temple of Augustus and barracks for garrisoned Roman soldiers , are marked in the Tabula <unk> ; the only surviving map of the Roman cursus publicus . 
 Merchants from West Asia and Southern Europe established coastal posts and settlements in Kerala . The Jewish connection with Kerala started in 573 BCE . Arabs also had trade links with Kerala , starting before the 4th century BCE , as Herodotus ( 484 – 413 BCE ) noted that goods brought by Arabs from Kerala were sold to the Jews at Eden . They intermarried with local people , resulting in formation of the Muslim Mappila community . In the 4th century , some Christians also migrated from Persia and joined the early Syrian Christian community who trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century . Mappila was an honorific title that had been assigned to respected visitors from abroad ; Jewish , Syrian Christian , and Muslim immigration account for later names of the respective communities : Juda Mappilas , <unk> Mappilas , and Muslim Mappilas . The earliest Saint Thomas Christian Churches , Cheraman Juma Masjid ( 629 CE ) — the first mosque of India — and <unk> Synagogue ( 1568 CE ) — the oldest active synagogue in the Commonwealth of Nations — were built in Kerala . 
 = = = Early medieval period = = = 
 A second Chera Kingdom ( c . 800 – 1102 ) , also known as Kulasekhara dynasty of <unk> , was established by Kulasekhara Varman , which ruled over a territory comprising the whole of modern Kerala and a smaller part of modern Tamil Nadu . During the early part of the Kulasekara period , the southern region from <unk> to <unk> was ruled by Ay kings , who lost their power in the 10th century , making the region a part of the Kulasekara empire . Under Kulasekhara rule , Kerala witnessed a developing period of art , literature , trade and the Bhakti movement of Hinduism . A Keralite identity , distinct from the Tamils , became linguistically separate during this period . For local administration , the empire was divided into provinces under the rule of <unk> , with each province comprising a number of Desams under the control of chieftains , called as <unk> . 
 The inhibitions , caused by a series of Chera @-@ Chola wars in the 11th century , resulted in the decline of foreign trade in Kerala ports . Buddhism and Jainism disappeared from the land . The social system became fractured with divisions on caste lines . Finally , the Kulasekhara dynasty was subjugated in 1102 by the combined attack of Later Pandyas and Later Cholas . However , in the 14th century , Ravi Varma <unk> ( 1299 – 1314 ) of the southern Venad kingdom was able to establish a short @-@ lived supremacy over southern India . After his death , in the absence of a strong central power , the state was divided into thirty small warring principalities ; the most powerful of them were the kingdom of <unk> in the north , Venad in the south and Kochi in the middle . In the 18th Century , Travancore King Sree <unk> Thirunal Marthanda Varma annexed all the kingdoms up to Northern Kerala through military conquests , resulting in the rise of Travancore to pre @-@ eminence in Kerala . The Kochi ruler sued for peace with <unk> Thirunal and Malabar came under direct British rule until India became independent . 
 = = = Colonial era = = = 
 The maritime spice trade monopoly in the Indian Ocean stayed with Arabs during the High and Late Middle Ages . However , the dominance of Middle East traders was challenged in the European Age of Discovery during which the spice trade , particularly in black pepper , became an influential activity for European traders . Around the 15th century , the Portuguese began to dominate eastern shipping , and the spice @-@ trade in particular , culminating in Vasco Da Gama 's arrival in <unk> Kozhikode in 1498 . The Zamorin of Kozhikode permitted the new visitors to trade with his subjects such that Portuguese trade in Kozhikode prospered with the establishment of a factory and a fort . However , Portuguese attacks on Arab properties in his jurisdiction provoked the Zamorin and led to conflicts between them . The Portuguese took advantage of the rivalry between the Zamorin and the King of Kochi allied with Kochi . When Francisco de Almeida was appointed as Viceroy of Portuguese India in 1505 , his headquarters was established at Fort Kochi ( Fort Emmanuel ) rather than in Kozhikode . During his reign , the Portuguese managed to dominate relations with Kochi and established a few fortresses on the Malabar coast . However , the Portuguese suffered setbacks from attacks by Zamorin forces ; especially from naval attacks under the leadership Kozhikode admirals known as <unk> <unk> , which compelled them to seek a treaty . In 1571 , the Portuguese were defeated by the Zamorin forces in the battle at <unk> fort . 
 The Portuguese were ousted by the Dutch East India Company , who during the conflicts between the Kozhikode and the Kochi , gained control of the trade . The Dutch in turn were weakened by constant battles with Marthanda Varma of the Travancore Royal Family , and were defeated at the Battle of <unk> in 1741 . An agreement , known as " Treaty of <unk> " , was signed by the Dutch and Travancore in 1753 , according to which the Dutch were compelled to detach from all political involvement in the region . Marthanda Varma annexed northern kingdoms through military conquests , resulting in the rise of Travancore to a position of preeminence in Kerala . 
 In 1766 , Hyder Ali , the ruler of Mysore invaded northern Kerala . His son and successor , Tipu Sultan , launched campaigns against the expanding British East India Company , resulting in two of the four Anglo @-@ Mysore Wars . Tipu ultimately ceded the Malabar District and South Kanara to the Company in the 1790s ; both were annexed to the Madras Presidency of British India in 1792 . The Company forged tributary alliances with Kochi in 1791 and Travancore in 1795 . By the end of 18th century , the whole of Kerala fell under the control of the British , either administered directly or under suzerainty . There were major revolts in Kerala during the independence movement in the 20th century ; most notable among them is the 1921 Malabar Rebellion and the social struggles in Travancore . In the Malabar Rebellion , Mappila Muslims of Malabar rioted against Hindu zamindars and the British Raj . Some social struggles against caste inequalities also erupted in the early decades of 20th century , leading to the 1936 Temple Entry Proclamation that opened Hindu temples in Travancore to all castes . 
 = = = Post colonial period = = = 
 After British India was partitioned in 1947 into India and Pakistan , Travancore and Kochi , part of the Union of India were merged on 1 July 1949 to form Travancore @-@ Cochin . On 1 November 1956 , the taluk of Kasargod in the South Kanara district of Madras , the Malabar district of Madras , and Travancore @-@ Cochin , without four southern taluks ( which joined Tamil Nadu ) , merged to form the state of Kerala under the States Reorganisation Act . A Communist @-@ led government under E. M. S. Namboodiripad resulted from the first elections for the new Kerala Legislative Assembly in 1957 . It was one of the earliest elected Communist governments , after Communist success in the 1945 elections in the Republic of San Marino . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The state is wedged between the Lakshadweep Sea and the Western Ghats . Lying between northern latitudes 8 ° 18 ' and 12 ° 48 ' and eastern longitudes 74 ° 52 ' and 77 ° 22 ' , Kerala experiences the humid equatorial tropic climate . The state has a coast of 590 km ( 370 mi ) and the width of the state varies between 11 and 121 kilometres ( 7 and 75 mi ) . Geographically , Kerala can be divided into three climatically distinct regions : the eastern highlands ; rugged and cool mountainous terrain , the central mid @-@ lands ; rolling hills , and the western lowlands ; coastal plains . Pre @-@ Cambrian and Pleistocene geological formations compose the bulk of Kerala 's terrain . A catastrophic flood in Kerala in 1341 CE drastically modified its terrain and consequently affected its history ; it also created a natural harbour for spice transport . The eastern region of Kerala consists of high mountains , gorges and deep @-@ cut valleys immediately west of the Western Ghats ' rain shadow . 41 of Kerala 's west @-@ flowing rivers , and 3 of its east @-@ flowing ones originate in this region . The Western Ghats form a wall of mountains interrupted only near Palakkad ; hence also known Palghat , where the Palakkad Gap breaks . The Western Ghats rise on average to 1 @,@ 500 m ( <unk> ft ) above sea level , while the highest peaks reach around 2 @,@ 500 m ( 8200 ft ) . <unk> , the highest peak in south India , is at an elevation of 2 @,@ 695 metres ( 8 @,@ 842 ft ) . 
 Kerala 's western coastal belt is relatively flat compared to the eastern region , and is criss @-@ crossed by a network of interconnected brackish canals , lakes , estuaries , and rivers known as the Kerala <unk> . The state 's largest lake Vembanad , dominates the backwaters ; it lies between Alappuzha and Kochi and is about 200 km2 ( 77 sq mi ) in area . Around eight percent of India 's waterways are found in Kerala . Kerala 's 44 rivers include the Periyar ; 244 kilometres ( 152 mi ) , <unk> ; 209 kilometres ( 130 mi ) , <unk> ; 176 kilometres ( 109 mi ) , <unk> ; 169 kilometres ( 105 mi ) , <unk> ; 130 kilometres ( 81 mi ) , <unk> ; 130 kilometres ( 81 mi ) , <unk> ; 129 kilometres ( 80 mi ) and the <unk> River ; 128 kilometres ( 80 mi ) . The average length of the rivers is 64 kilometres ( 40 mi ) . Many of the rivers are small and entirely fed by monsoon rain . As Kerala 's rivers are small and lacking in delta , they are more prone to environmental effects . The rivers face problems such as sand mining and pollution . The state experiences several natural hazards like landslides , floods and droughts . The state was also affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 With around 120 – 140 rainy days per year , Kerala has a wet and maritime tropical climate influenced by the seasonal heavy rains of the southwest summer monsoon and northeast winter monsoon . Around 65 % of the rainfall occurs from June to August corresponding to the Southwest monsoon , and the rest from September to December corresponding to Northeast monsoon . The moisture @-@ laden winds of the Southwest monsoon , on reaching the southernmost point of the Indian Peninsula , because of its topography , divides into two branches ; the " Arabian Sea Branch " and the " Bay of Bengal Branch " . The " Arabian Sea Branch " of the Southwest monsoon first hits the Western Ghats , making Kerala the first state in India to receive rain from the Southwest monsoon . The distribution of pressure patterns is reversed in the Northeast monsoon , during this season the cold winds from North India pick up moisture from the Bay of Bengal and precipitate it on the east coast of peninsular India . In Kerala , the influence of the Northeast monsoon is seen in southern districts only . Kerala 's rainfall averages 2 @,@ 923 mm ( 115 in ) annually . Some of Kerala 's drier lowland regions average only 1 @,@ 250 mm ( 49 in ) ; the mountains of the eastern Idukki district receive more than 5 @,@ 000 mm ( 197 in ) of orographic precipitation : the highest in the state . In eastern Kerala , a drier tropical wet and dry climate prevails . During the summer , the state is prone to gale force winds , storm surges , cyclone @-@ related torrential downpours , occasional droughts , and rises in sea level . The mean daily temperature ranges from 19 @.@ 8 ° C to 36 @.@ 7 ° C. Mean annual temperatures range from 25 @.@ 0 – 27 @.@ 5 ° C in the coastal lowlands to 20 @.@ 0 – 22 @.@ 5 ° C in the eastern highlands . 
 = = Flora and fauna = = 
 Most of the biodiversity is concentrated and protected in the Western Ghats . Three quarters of the land area of Kerala was under thick forest up to 18th century . As of 2004 , over 25 % of India 's 15 @,@ 000 plant species are in Kerala . Out of the 4 @,@ 000 flowering plant species ; 1 @,@ 272 of which are endemic to Kerala , 900 are medicinal , and 159 are threatened . Its 9 @,@ 400 km2 of forests include tropical wet evergreen and semi @-@ evergreen forests ( lower and middle elevations — 3 @,@ 470 km2 ) , tropical moist and dry deciduous forests ( mid @-@ elevations — 4 @,@ 100 km2 and 100 km2 , respectively ) , and montane subtropical and temperate ( shola ) forests ( highest elevations — 100 km2 ) . Altogether , 24 % of Kerala is forested . Three of the world 's Ramsar Convention listed wetlands — Lake <unk> , <unk> Lake and the Vembanad @-@ Kol wetlands — are in Kerala , as well as 1455 @.@ 4 km2 of the vast Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve . Subjected to extensive clearing for cultivation in the 20th century , much of the remaining forest cover is now protected from clearfelling . Eastern Kerala 's windward mountains shelter tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests , which are common in the Western Ghats . The world 's oldest teak plantation ' Conolly 's Plot ' is in Nilambur . 
 Kerala 's fauna are notable for their diversity and high rates of endemism : it includes 102 species of mammals ( 56 of which are endemic ) , 476 species of birds , 202 species of freshwater fish , 169 species of reptiles ( 139 of them endemic ) , and 89 species of amphibians ( 86 endemic ) . These are threatened by extensive habitat destruction , including soil erosion , landslides , salinisation , and resource extraction . In the forests , <unk> , Dalbergia latifolia , <unk> , <unk> , Erythrina , and Cassia number among the more than 1 @,@ 000 species of trees in Kerala . Other plants include bamboo , wild black pepper , wild cardamom , the calamus rattan palm , and aromatic vetiver grass , Vetiveria <unk> . Indian elephant , Bengal tiger , Indian leopard , Nilgiri tahr , common palm civet , and grizzled giant squirrels are also found in the forests . Reptiles include the king cobra , viper , python , and mugger crocodile . Kerala 's birds include the Malabar <unk> , the great hornbill , Kerala <unk> , darter and southern hill myna . In the lakes , wetlands , and waterways , fish such as <unk> ; stinging catfish and <unk> ; orange <unk> — Etroplus maculatus are found . 
 = = Subdivisions = = 
 The state 's 14 districts are distributed among six regions : North Malabar ( far @-@ north Kerala ) , South Malabar ( northern Kerala ) , Kochi ( central Kerala ) , Northern Travancore , Central Travancore ( southern Kerala ) and Southern Travancore ( far @-@ south Kerala ) . The districts which serve as administrative regions for taxation purposes are further subdivided into 75 taluks , which have fiscal and administrative powers over settlements within their borders , including maintenance of local land records . Kerala 's taluks are further sub @-@ divided into 1 @,@ 453 revenue villages . Since the 73rd and 74th amendments to the Constitution of India , the local government institutions function as the third tier of government , which constitutes 14 District Panchayats , 152 Block Panchayats , 978 Grama Panchayats , 60 Municipalities , six Corporations and one Township . Mahé , a part of the Indian union territory of Puducherry , though 647 kilometres ( 402 mi ) away from it , is a coastal exclave surrounded by Kerala on all of its landward approaches . The Kannur District surrounds Mahé on three sides with the Kozhikode District on the fourth . 
 There are six Municipal corporations in Kerala that govern Thiruvananthapuram , Kollam , Kochi , Thrissur , Kozhikode and Kannur . The Thiruvananthapuram Municipal Corporation is the largest corporation in Kerala while Kochi metropolitan area named Kochi UA is the largest urban agglomeration . According to a survey by economics research firm <unk> <unk> in 2007 , Thiruvananthapuram , Kozhikode , Thrissur , Kochi and Kannur are among the " best cities in India to live " ; the survey used parameters such as health , education , environment , safety , public facilities and entertainment to rank the cities . 
 = = Government and administration = = 
 Kerala hosts two major political alliances : the United Democratic Front ( UDF ) , led by the Indian National Congress ; and the Left Democratic Front ( <unk> ) , led by the Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) ( CPI ( M ) ) . As of 2016 , the <unk> is the ruling coalition ; <unk> Vijayan of the Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) is the Chief Minister , while Ramesh <unk> of the UDF is the Leader of Opposition . Strikes , protests and marches are ubiquitous in Kerala because of the comparatively strong presence of labour unions . According to the Constitution of India , Kerala has a parliamentary system of representative democracy ; universal suffrage is granted to residents . The government is organised into the three branches : 
 Legislature : The unicameral legislature , the Kerala Legislative Assembly popularly known as <unk> , comprises elected members and special office bearers ; the Speaker and Deputy Speaker elected by the members from among themselves . Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker and in the Speaker 's absence , by the Deputy Speaker . The state has 140 assembly constituencies . The state elects 20 and 9 members for representation in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha respectively . 
 Executive : The Governor of Kerala is the constitutional head of state , and is appointed by the President of India . P <unk> is the Governor of Kerala . The executive authority is headed by the Chief Minister of Kerala , who is the head of government and is vested with extensive executive powers ; the head of the majority party in the Legislative Assembly is appointed to the post by the Governor . The Council of Ministers has its members appointed by the Governor , taking the advice of the Chief Minister . The executive administration is based in Thiruvananthapuram at State Secretariat complex . Each district has a district administrator appointed by government called District collector for executive administration . Auxiliary authorities known as panchayats , for which local body elections are regularly held , govern local affairs . 
 Judiciary : The judiciary consists of the Kerala High Court and a system of lower courts . The High Court , located in Kochi , has a Chief Justice along with 23 permanent and seven additional pro tempore justices as of 2012 . The high court also hears cases from the Union Territory of Lakshadweep . 
 The local government bodies ; Panchayat , Municipalities and Corporations have existed in Kerala since 1959 , however , the major initiative to decentralise the governance was started in 1993 , conforming to the constitutional amendments of central government in this direction . With the enactment of Kerala Panchayati Raj Act and Kerala Municipality Act in 1994 , the state implemented reforms in local self @-@ governance . The Kerala Panchayati Raj Act envisages a 3 @-@ tier system of local government with Gram panchayat , Block panchayat and District Panchayat forming a hierarchy . The acts ensure a clear demarcation of power among these institutions . However , the Kerala Municipality Act envisages a single @-@ tier system for urban areas , with the institution of municipality designed to par with the Gram panchayat of the former system . Substantial administrative , legal and financial powers are delegated to these bodies to ensure efficient decentralisation . As per the present norms , the state government devolves about 40 per cent of the state plan outlay to the local government . 
 = = Economy = = 
 After independence , the state was managed as a democratic socialist welfare economy . From the 1990s , liberalisation of the mixed economy allowed onerous Licence Raj restrictions against capitalism and foreign direct investment to be lightened , leading to economic expansion and an increase in employment . In the fiscal year 2007 – 2008 , the nominal gross state domestic product ( GSDP ) was ₹ 1 @,@ 624 billion ( US $ 24 billion ) . GSDP growth ; 9 @.@ 2 % in 2004 – 2005 and 7 @.@ 4 % in 2003 – 2004 had been high compared to an average of 2 @.@ 3 % annually in the 1980s and between 5 @.@ 1 % and 5 @.@ 99 % in the 1990s . The state recorded 8 @.@ 93 % growth in enterprises from 1998 to 2005 , higher than the national rate of 4 @.@ 80 % . The Human Development Index rating of Kerala is the highest in India at 0 @.@ 790 . The " Kerala phenomenon " or " Kerala model of development " of very high human development and in comparison low economic development has resulted from a strong service sector . 
 Kerala 's economy depends on emigrants working in foreign countries , mainly in Arab states of the Persian Gulf , and remittances annually contribute more than a fifth of GSDP . In 2008 , the Persian Gulf countries together had a Keralite population of more than 2 @.@ 5 million , who sent home annually a sum of US $ 6 @.@ 81 billion , which is the highest among Indian states and more than 15 @.@ 13 % of remittances to India in 2008 . In 2012 , Kerala still received the highest remittances of all states : US $ 11 @.@ 3 billion , which was nearly 16 % of the US $ 71 billion remittances to the country . In 2015 , NRI deposits in Kerala have soared to over ₹ 1 lakh crore ( US $ 15 billion ) , amounting to one @-@ sixth of all the money deposited in NRI accounts , which comes to about ₹ 7 lakh crore ( US $ 100 billion ) . However , a study commissioned by the Kerala State Planning Board , suggested that the state look for other reliable sources of income , instead of relying on remittances to finance its expenditure . According to a study done in 2013 , Kerala loses about ₹ 17 @,@ 500 crore ( US $ 2 @.@ 6 billion ) every year , through the sizeable population of migrant labourers in Kerala . 
 The tertiary sector comprises services such as transport , storage , communications , tourism , banking , insurance and real estate . In 2011 – 2012 , it contributed 63 @.@ 22 % of the state 's GDP , agriculture and allied sectors contributed 15 @.@ 73 % , while manufacturing , construction and utilities contributed 21 @.@ 05 % . Nearly half of Kerala 's people depend on agriculture alone for income . Around 600 varieties of rice , which is Kerala 's most used staple and cereal crop , are harvested from <unk> @.@ 21 km2 ; a decline from <unk> @.@ 4 km2 in 1990 . 688 @,@ 859 tonnes of rice are produced per year . Other key crops include coconut ; 899 @,@ 198 ha , tea , coffee ; 23 % of Indian production , or 57 @,@ 000 tonnes , rubber , cashews , and spices — including pepper , cardamom , vanilla , cinnamon , and nutmeg . 
 Traditional industries manufacturing items ; coir , handlooms , and handicrafts employ around one million people . Kerala supplies 60 % of the total global produce of white coir fibre . India 's first coir factory was set up in Alleppey in 1859 – 60 . The Central <unk> Research Institute was established there in 1959 . As per the 2006 – 2007 census by <unk> , there are 1 @,@ 468 @,@ 104 micro , small and medium enterprises in Kerala employing 3 @,@ 031 @,@ 272 people . The <unk> has promoted more than 650 medium and large manufacturing firms in Kerala , creating employment for 72 @,@ 500 people . A mining sector of 0 @.@ 3 % of GSDP involves extraction of ilmenite , kaolin , bauxite , silica , quartz , rutile , zircon , and <unk> . Other major sectors are tourism , manufacturing , home gardens , animal husbandry and business process outsourcing . 
 As of March 2002 , Kerala 's banking sector comprised <unk> local branches : each branch served 10 @,@ 000 people , lower than the national average of 16 @,@ 000 ; the state has the third @-@ highest bank penetration among Indian states . On 1 October 2011 , Kerala became the first state in the country to have at least one banking facility in every village . Unemployment in 2007 was estimated at 9 @.@ 4 % ; chronic issues are underemployment , low employability of youth , and a low female labour participation rate of only 13 @.@ 5 % , as is the practice of <unk> <unk> , " wages for looking on " . By 1999 – 2000 , the rural and urban poverty rates dropped to 10 @.@ 0 % and 9 @.@ 6 % respectively . 
 Kerala has focused more attention towards growth of Information Technology sector with formation of <unk> , Thiruvananthapuram which is one of the largest IT employer in Kerala . It was the first technology park in India and with the inauguration of the <unk> complex on 22 February 2007 , <unk> became the largest IT Park in India . Software giants like Infosys , Oracle , Tata Consultancy Services , Capgemini , HCL , UST Global , Nest and Suntec have offices in the state . The state has a second major IT hub , the <unk> centred in Kochi with " spokes " ( it acts as the " hub " ) in Thrissur and <unk> . As of 2014 , <unk> generates one @-@ third of total IT Revenues of the state with key offices of IT majors like Tata Consultancy Services , Cognizant , Wipro , UST Global , IBS Software Services etc. and Multinational corporations like KPMG , Ernst & Young , <unk> Services , Etisalat DB Telecom , Nielsen Audio , Xerox ACS , Tata <unk> etc . Kochi also has another major project SmartCity under construction , built in partnership with Dubai Government . A third major IT Hub is under construction centred around Kozhikode known as <unk> . 
 The Grand Kerala Shopping Festival ( <unk> ) was started in 2007 , covering more than 3000 outlets across the nine cities of Kerala with huge tax discounts , VAT refunds and huge array of prizes . 
 The state 's budget of 2012 – 2013 was ₹ 481 @.@ 42 billion ( US $ 7 @.@ 2 billion ) . The state government 's tax revenues ( excluding the shares from Union tax pool ) amounted to ₹ 217 @.@ 22 billion ( US $ 3 @.@ 2 billion ) in 2010 – 2011 ; up from ₹ 176 @.@ 25 billion ( US $ 2 @.@ 6 billion ) in 2009 – 2010 . Its non @-@ tax revenues ( excluding the shares from Union tax pool ) of the Government of Kerala reached ₹ 19 @,@ 308 million ( US $ 290 million ) in 2010 – 2011 . However , Kerala 's high ratio of taxation to GSDP has not alleviated chronic budget deficits and unsustainable levels of government debt , which have impacted social services . A record total of 223 <unk> were observed in 2006 , resulting in a revenue loss of over ₹ 20 billion ( US $ 300 million ) . Kerala 's 10 % rise in GDP is 3 % more than the national GDP . In 2013 , capital expenditure rose 30 % compared to the national average of 5 % , owners of two @-@ wheelers rose by 35 % compared to the national rate of 15 % , and the teacher @-@ pupil ratio rose 50 % from 2 : 100 to 4 : 100 . 
 In November 2015 , the Ministry of Urban Development selected seven cities of Kerala for a comprehensive development program known as the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation ( <unk> ) . A package of ₹ 25 lakh ( US $ 37 @,@ 000 ) was declared for each of the cities to develop service level improvement plan ( SLIP ) , a plan for better functioning of the local urban bodies in the cities of Thiruvananthapuram , Kollam , Alappuzha , Kochi , Thrissur , Kozhikode , and Palakkad . 
 = = = Agriculture = = = 
 The major change in agriculture in Kerala occurred in the 1970s when production of rice fell due to increased availability of rice all over India and decreased availability of labour . Consequently , investment in rice production decreased and a major portion of the land shifted to the cultivation of perennial tree crops and seasonal crops . Profitability of crops fell due to a shortage of farm labour , the high price of land , and the uneconomic size of operational holdings . 
 Kerala produces 97 % of the national output of black pepper and accounts for 85 % of the natural rubber in the country . Coconut , tea , coffee , cashew , and spices — including cardamom , vanilla , cinnamon , and nutmeg are the main agricultural products . 80 % of India 's export quality cashew kernels are prepared in Kollam . The key agricultural staple is rice , with varieties grown in extensive paddy fields . Home gardens made up a significant portion of the agricultural sector . Related animal husbandry is touted by proponents as a means of alleviating rural poverty and unemployment among women , the marginalised , and the landless . The state government promotes these activities via educational campaigns and the development of new cattle breeds such as the <unk> . 
 Though the contribution of agricultural sector to the state economy was on the decline in 2012 – 13 , through the strength of the allied livestock sector , it has picked up from 7 @.@ 03 % ( 2011 – 12 ) to 7 @.@ 2 % . In the 2013 – 14 fiscal period , the contribution has been estimated at a high of 7 @.@ 75 % . The total growth of the farm sector has recorded a 4 @.@ 39 % increase in 2012 – 13 , over a paltry 1 @.@ 3 % growth in the previous fiscal year . The agricultural sector has a share of 9 @.@ 34 % in the sectoral distribution of Gross State Domestic Product at Constant Price , while the secondary and tertiary sectors has contributed 23 @.@ 94 % and 66 @.@ 72 % respectively . 
 There is a preference for organic products and home farming compared to synthetic fertilizers and pesticides . <unk> is Kerala 's first online open market for consumers / farmers to connect directly with each other . It provides a platform or rather a virtual market for farmers and end consumers where the farmers can display their crops , mention the quantity , specify the method of cultivation , expected price for the commodity and contact details . Farmers can post their products in any quantity ranging from 1 kilogram ( 2 @.@ 2 lb ) to 1 @,@ 000 kilograms ( 2 @,@ 200 lb ) which means even a person having a kitchen farm may find a buyer . 
 = = = Fisheries = = = 
 With a 590 km of coastal belt , 400 @,@ 000 hectares of inland water resources and approximately 220 @,@ 000 active fishermen , Kerala is one of the leading producers of fish in India . According to 2003 – 04 reports , about 1 @.@ 1 million people earn their livelihood from fishing and allied activities such as drying , processing , packaging , exporting and transporting fisheries . The annual yield of the sector was estimated as 608 @,@ 000 tons in 2003 – 04 . This contributes to about 3 % of the total economy of the state . In 2006 , around 22 % of the total Indian marine fishery yield was from Kerala . During the southwest monsoon , a suspended mud bank develops along the shore , which in turn leads to calm ocean water , peaking the output of the fishing industry . This phenomenon is locally called <unk> . The waters provide a large variety of fish : pelagic species ; 59 % , demersal species ; 23 % , crustaceans , molluscs and others for 18 % . Around 1 @.@ 050 million fishermen haul an annual catch of 668 @,@ 000 tonnes as of a 1999 – 2000 estimate ; 222 fishing villages are strung along the 590 km coast . Another 113 fishing villages dot the hinterland . Kerala 's coastal belt of <unk> is known for high background radiation from thorium @-@ containing monazite sand . In some coastal panchayats , median outdoor radiation levels are more than 4 mGy / yr and , in certain locations on the coast , it is as high as 70 mGy / yr .

Most of Kerala 's west coast is accessible through two national highways , NH 47 and NH 17 ; and the eastern side is accessible through state highways . There is also a hill highway proposed , to provide access to the eastern hills . National Highway 17 , with the longest stretch of road ( 421 kilometres ( 262 mi ) ) connects <unk> to Panvel ; it starts from Kochi and passes through Kozhikode , Kannur , <unk> , Kasaragod and <unk> before entering Karnataka . NH 47 runs from Salem to <unk> via Coimbatore , Palakkad , Thrissur , Ernakulam , Kochi , <unk> , Kollam , Thiruvananthapuram , and Nagercoil , connecting Kerala 's political capital ( Thiruvananthapuram ) to its commercial capital ( Kochi ) . Palakkad district is generally referred to as the Gateway of Kerala , due to the presence of the Palakkad Gap , in the Western Ghats , through which the northern ( Malabar ) and southern ( Travancore ) parts of Kerala are connected to the rest of India via road and rail . There is the state 's largest checkpoint , <unk> , the border town between Kerala and Tamilnadu , through which a large amount of public and commercial transportation reaches the northern and central districts of Kerala . 
 The Department of Public Works is responsible for maintaining and expanding the state highways system and major district roads . The Kerala State Transport Project ( KSTP ) , which includes the GIS @-@ based Road Information and Management Project ( <unk> ) , is responsible for maintaining and expanding the state highways in Kerala ; it also oversees a few major district roads . Traffic in Kerala has been growing at a rate of 10 – 11 % every year , resulting in high traffic and pressure on the roads . Traffic density is nearly four times the national average , reflecting the state 's high population . Kerala 's annual total of road accidents is among the nation 's highest . The accidents are mainly the result of the narrow roads and irresponsible driving . National Highways in Kerala are among the narrowest in the country and will remain so for the foreseeable future , as the state government has received an exemption that allows narrow national highways . In Kerala , highways are 45 meters wide . In other states National Highways are grade separated highways 60 meters wide with a minimum of four lanes , as well as 6 or 8 lane access @-@ controlled expressways . National Highways Authority of India ( <unk> ) has threatened the Kerala state government that it will give high priority to other states in highway development as political commitment to better highways has been lacking . As of 2013 , the state had the highest road accident rate in the country , with most fatal accidents taking place along the state 's National Highways .

 = = = Airports = = = 
 Kerala has three international airports : Trivandrum International Airport , Cochin International Airport and Calicut International Airport . All civilian airports functioning in the state are international airports , a feature which is unique to Kerala . Upon completion of the Kannur International Airport , Kerala will join Tamil Nadu as the state with the most international airports . Unlike in other states where the capital city has the highest air traffic , in Kerala , air traffic is distributed evenly over Kochi , Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode . Despite this , all these three airports are among the top 15 busiest airports in India . 
 Kollam Airport , established under the Madras Presidency and closed before the inauguration of Trivandrum International Airport in the capital , was the first airport in Kerala . Trivandrum International Airport , managed by the Airport Authority of India , is among the oldest existing airports in South India . Cochin International Airport is the busiest in the state and the seventh @-@ busiest in the country . It was the first Indian airport to be incorporated as a public limited company ; it was funded by nearly 10 @,@ 000 non @-@ resident Indians from 30 countries . Cochin Airport is the primary hub of Air India Express and the secondary hub of Air Asia India . 
 Other than civilian airports , Kochi has a naval airport named INS Garuda . Thiruvananthapuram airport shares civilian facilities with the Southern Air Command of the Indian Air Force . These facilities are used mostly by Central Government VIPs visiting Kerala . 
 = = = Water transport = = = 
 Kerala has one major port , 17 minor ports and a few mini ports . The state has numerous backwaters , which are used for commercial inland navigation . Transport services are mainly provided by country craft and passenger vessels . There are 67 navigable rivers in the state while the total length of inland waterways is 1 @,@ 687 kilometres ( 1 @,@ 048 mi ) . The main constraints to the expansion of inland navigation are ; lack of depth in waterways caused by silting , lack of maintenance of navigation systems and bank protection , accelerated growth of the water hyacinth , lack of modern inland craft terminals , and lack of a cargo handling system . A canal 205 kilometres ( 127 mi ) long , National Waterway 3 , runs between <unk> and Kollam , which is included in the East @-@ Coast Canal .

 The democratic rise of the Communist Party of India in the state , culminating in the chief ministership of EMS Namboodiripad and his government , helped to distribute land and implement educational reforms . There is the tradition of matrilineal inheritance in Kerala , where the mother is the head of the household . As a result , women in Kerala have had a much higher standing and influence in the society . This was common among certain influential castes and is a factor in the value placed on daughters . Christian missionaries also influenced Malayali women in that they started schools for girls from poor families . Opportunities for women such as education and gainful employment often translate into a lower birth rate , which in turn , make education and employment more likely to be accessible and more beneficial for women . This creates an upward spiral for both the women and children of the community that is passed on to future generations . According to the Human Development Report of 1996 , Kerala 's Gender Development Index was 597 ; higher than any other state of India . Factors , such as high rates of female literacy , education , work participation and life expectancy , along with favourable sex ratio , contributed to it . 
 Kerala 's sex ratio of 1 @.@ 084 is higher than that of the rest of India and is the only state where women outnumber men . While having the opportunities that education affords them , such as political participation , keeping up to date with current events , reading religious texts etc . , these tools have still not translated into full , equal rights for the women of Kerala . There is a general attitude that women must be restricted for their own benefit . In the state , despite the social progress , gender still influences social mobility . 
 = = = Human Development Index = = = 
 As of 2014 , Kerala has a Human Development Index ( HDI ) of 0 @.@ 790 which comes under the " high " category and it is the highest in the country and a consumption @-@ based HDI of 0 @.@ 920 , which is better than that of many developed countries . Comparatively higher spending by the government on primary level education , health care and the elimination of poverty from the 19th century onward has helped the state maintain an exceptionally high HDI ; the report was prepared by the central government 's Institute of Applied Manpower Research . However , the Human Development Report 2005 , prepared by Centre for Development Studies envisages a virtuous phase of inclusive development for the state since the advancement in human development had already started aiding the economic development of the state . Kerala is also widely regarded as the cleanest and healthiest state in India . 
 According to the 2011 census , Kerala has the highest literacy rate ( 93 @.@ 91 ) among Indian states . The life expectancy in Kerala is 74 years , among the highest in India as of 2011 . Kerala 's rural poverty rate fell from 59 % ( 1973 – 1974 ) to 12 % ( 1999 – 2010 ) ; the overall ( urban and rural ) rate fell 47 % between the 1970s and 2000s against the 29 % fall in overall poverty rate in India . By 1999 – 2000 , the rural and urban poverty rates dropped to 10 @.@ 0 % and 9 @.@ 6 % respectively . These changes stem largely from efforts begun in the late 19th century by the kingdoms of Cochin and Travancore to boost social welfare . This focus was maintained by Kerala 's post @-@ independence government . 
 Kerala has undergone a " demographic transition " characteristic of such developed nations as Canada , Japan , and Norway ; . as 11 @.@ 2 % of people are over the age of 60 , and due to the low birthrate of 18 per 1 @,@ 000 . In 1991 , Kerala 's total fertility rate ( TFR ) was the lowest in India . Hindus had a TFR of 1 @.@ 66 , Christians ; 1 @.@ 78 , and Muslims ; 2 @.@ 97 . The state also is regarded as the " least corrupt Indian state " according to the surveys conducted by Transparency International ( 2005 ) and India Today ( 1997 ) . Kerala has the lowest homicide rate among Indian states , with 1 @.@ 1 per 100 @,@ 000 in 2011 . In respect of female empowerment , some negative factors such as higher suicide rate , lower share of earned income , child marriage , complaints of sexual harassment and limited freedom are reported . 
 In 2015 , Kerala had the highest conviction rate of any state , over 77 % . Kerala has the lowest proportion of homeless people in rural India - 0 @.@ 04 % , and the state is attempting to reach the goal of becoming the first " Zero Homeless State " , in addition to its acclaimed " Zero landless project " , with private organisations and the expatriate Malayali community funding projects for building homes for the homeless . The state was also among the lowest in the India State Hunger Index next only to Punjab . In 2015 Kerala became the first " complete digital state " by implementing e @-@ governance initiatives . 
 = = = Healthcare = = = 
 Kerala , considered as being healthier than many states of the United States , is a pioneer in implementing the Universal health care programme . The sub @-@ replacement fertility level and infant mortality rate are lower compared to those of other states ; estimated from 12 to 14 deaths per 1 @,@ 000 live births . However , Kerala 's morbidity rate is higher than that of any other Indian state — 118 ( rural ) and 88 ( urban ) per 1 @,@ 000 people . The corresponding figures for all India were 55 and 54 per 1 @,@ 000 respectively as of 2005 . Kerala 's 13 @.@ 3 % prevalence of low birth weight is higher than that of many first world nations . Outbreaks of water @-@ borne diseases such as diarrhoea , dysentery , hepatitis , and typhoid among the more than 50 % of people who rely on 3 million water wells is an issue worsened by the lack of sewers . According to a study commissioned by Lien Foundation , a Singapore @-@ based philanthropic organisation , Kerala is considered to be the best place to die in India based on the state 's provision of palliative care for patients with serious illnesses . 
 The United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) and the World Health Organisation designated Kerala the world 's first " baby @-@ friendly state " because of its effective promotion of breast @-@ feeding over formulas . Over 95 % of Keralite births are hospital delivered and the state also has the lowest Infant mortality rate in the country . The third National Family Health Survey ranks Kerala first in " Institutional Delivery " with 100 % births in medical facilities . Ayurveda , siddha , and endangered and endemic modes of traditional medicine , including <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , are practised . Some occupational communities such as <unk> were known as native medicine men in relation to the practice of such streams of medical systems , apart from their traditional vocation . These propagate via <unk> discipleship , and comprise a fusion of both medicinal and alternative treatments . 
 In 2014 , Kerala became the first state in India to offer free cancer treatment to the poor , via a program called <unk> . People in Kerala experience elevated incidence of cancers , liver and kidney diseases . In April 2016 , the Economic Times reported that 250 @,@ 000 residents undergo treatment for cancer . It also reported that approximately 150 to 200 liver transplants are conducted in the region 's hospitals annually . Approximately 42 @,@ 000 cancer cases are reported in the region annually . This is believed to be an underestimate due as private hospitals may not be reporting their figures . Long waiting lists for kidney donations has stimulated illegal trade in human kidneys , and prompted the establishment of the Kidney Federation of India which aims to support financially disadvantaged patients .

 In comparison with the rest of India , Kerala experiences relatively little sectarianism . According to 2011 Census of India figures , 54 @.@ 73 % of Kerala 's residents are Hindus , 26 @.@ 56 % are Muslims , 18 @.@ 38 % are Christians , and the remaining 0 @.@ 32 % follow another or have no religious affiliation .

He was instrumental in establishing four mathas at Sringeri , Dwarka , Puri and Jyotirmath . <unk> Narayana <unk> was another religious figure who composed <unk> , a collection of verses in praise of the Hindu God Krishna . 
 Islam arrived in Kerala through Arab traders in the seventh century CE . Muslims of Kerala , generally referred to as Mappila , mostly follow the Shafi 'i Madh 'hab under Sunni Islam . The major Muslim organisations are Sunni , Mujahid and Jama 'at @-@ e @-@ Islami . 
 Ancient Christian tradition says that Christianity reached the shores of Kerala in AD 52 with the arrival of Thomas the Apostle , one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ . Saint Thomas Christians include Syro @-@ Malabar Catholic , Syro @-@ Malankara Catholic , Malankara Orthodox Syrian , Jacobite Syrian , <unk> Syrian , the Syrian Anglicans in the CSI and several Pentecostal and evangelical denominations . The origin of the Latin Catholic Christians in Kerala is the result of the missionary endeavours of the Portuguese Padroado in the 16th century . Judaism reached Kerala in the 10th century BC during the time of King Solomon . They are called Cochin Jews or Malabar Jews and are the oldest group of Jews in India . There was a significant Jewish community which existed in Kerala until the 20th century , when most of them migrated to Israel . The <unk> Synagogue at Kochi is the oldest synagogue in the Commonwealth . Jainism has a considerable following in the Wayanad district . 
 Buddhism was popular in the time of Ashoka the Great but vanished by the 12th century CE . Certain Hindu communities such as the Kshatriyas , Nairs , <unk> and the Muslims around North Malabar used to follow a traditional matrilineal system known as <unk> , although this practice ended in the years after Indian independence . Other Muslims , Christians , and some Hindu castes such as the <unk> and the <unk> followed <unk> , a patrilineal system . Owing to the former matrilineal system , women in Kerala enjoy a high social status . However , gender inequality among low caste men and women is reportedly higher compared to that in other castes . 
 = = Education = = 
 The Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries . In attempting to solve astronomical problems , the Kerala school independently created a number of important mathematics concepts , including series expansion for trigonometric functions . Following the instructions of the Wood 's despatch of 1854 , both the princely states , Travancore and Cochin , launched mass education drives with support from agencies , mainly based on castes and communities and introduced a system of grant @-@ in @-@ aid to attract more private initiatives . The efforts by leaders , <unk> Swami , Narayana Guru and <unk> , towards aiding the socially discriminated castes in the state , with the help of community @-@ based organisations like Nair Service Society , <unk> , Muslim Mahajana Sabha , Yoga <unk> Sabha ( of <unk> ) and congregations of Christian churches , led to the development of mass education in Kerala . 
 In 1991 , Kerala became the first state in India to be recognised as a completely literate state , though the effective literacy rate at that time was only 90 % . As of 2007 , the net enrolment in elementary education was almost 100 % and was almost balanced among sexes , social groups and regions , unlike other states in India . The state topped the Education Development Index ( EDI ) among 21 major states in India in the year 2006 – 2007 . According to the first Economic Census , conducted in 1977 , 99 @.@ 7 % of the villages in Kerala had a primary school within 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) , 98 @.@ 6 % had a middle school within 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) and 96 @.@ 7 % had a high school or higher secondary school within 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) .

Though the cost of education is generally considered low in Kerala , according to the 61st round of the National Sample Survey ( 2004 – 2005 ) , per capita spending on education by the rural households was reported to be ₹ 41 ( 61 ¢ US ) for Kerala , more than twice the national average . The survey also revealed that the rural @-@ urban difference in household expenditure on education was much less in Kerala than in the rest of India .

 " Run to You " was released as the debut single from Reckless on 18 October 1984 in Canada and the U.S. and became one of the most successful songs from the album on the American rock charts ; it would become arguably one of Adams ' most recognizable and popular songs . The song was Adams ' first number one hit on the Mainstream Rock Tracks and reached number six on the Billboard Hot 100 . It reached the top 20 on the Canadian singles chart and remained in the top 20 for seven weeks . With " Run to You " , Adams reached the highest Canadian chart position in his career to that time ; it was his second top 20 hit single in Canada . " Run to You " was released in November 1984 in Europe where it peaked at the top ten in Ireland at number 8 and reached number 11 on the UK Singles Chart ; it was his second single to chart in Europe . 
 " Somebody " was released in the winter of 1985 and became one of the most successful songs from Reckless on the American rock charts . The song was Adams ' second number one hit on the Mainstream Rock Tracks . It reached number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was in the top 20 on the Canadian singles chart where it remained for six weeks . " Somebody " was Adams ' third top 20 hit on the Canadian chart . " Somebody " was released the following month in Europe and peaked at the top 20 in Ireland at number 20 and reached the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart at 35 ; it was his third single to chart in Europe . 
 " Heaven " was the third single from Reckless . The single topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart . The song previously peaked at number nine on the Billboard Top Tracks chart from the A Night in Heaven soundtrack album . The song has appeared on all of Adams ' compilation albums with the exception of The Best of Me . The single was certified Gold in Canada in 1985 . 
 " Summer of ' 69 " was officially released to US radio in 1984 and it appeared on the Billboard magazine 's Hot 100 chart at 5 and 40 on the mainstream rock tracks . In Canada , " Summer of ' 69 " was officially released to radio on November 1984 . The song reached the top twenty on the Canadian Singles Chart and remained in the top 20 for another month . " Summer of ' 69 " was the highest charting single from Reckless with " Heaven " . 
 The song was released in Australia , Europe and New Zealand in 1985 . " Heaven " reached the UK top 40 , while " Summer of ' 69 " peaked at the top 40 . " Summer of ' 69 " continued the trend of higher @-@ charting singles when it debuted and peaked at top 20 in most of the European countries it charted . Adams ' previous singles had charted much weaker in Europe and " Summer of ' 69 " would be Adams ' second single to chart in mainland Europe . 
 Although " Summer of ' 69 " reached the top ten in Norway and then the top 20 in the Austria , Ireland and Sweden , it was a moderate top 100 success in Germany where it peaked at 62 . 
 In 2008 , Adams was quoted as saying : 
 " ' Summer of ' 69 ' - I think it 's timeless because it 's about making love in the summertime . There is a slight misconception it 's about a year , but it 's not . ' 69 ' has nothing to do about a year , it has to do with a sexual position ... At the end of the song the lyric says that it 's me and my baby in a 69 . You 'd have to be pretty thick in the ears if you couldn 't get that lyric . " 
 Co @-@ writer Jim Vallance has always gone for the more conventional interpretation of the title being a reference to a year . He notes Jackson Browne 's " Running on Empty " , which contains references to 1965 and 1969 , as his own influence , and recalls that Adams cited the film Summer of ' 42 as his . 
 Although " One Night Love Affair " was officially released to US radio in 1985 , it appeared on the Billboard magazine 's Hot 100 chart at 13 and 7 on the mainstream rock tracks . In Canada , " One Night Love Affair " was officially released to radio in February 1985 . The song reached the top 20 on the Canadian Singles Chart and remained in the top twenty for another month . " One Night Love Affair " was the lowest charting single from Reckless .

 Soon after its release , Reckless peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 in January 1985 before dropping out of the top ten . The success of the singles " Heaven " and " Summer of ' 69 " renewed interest in the album and it began climbing back up the chart , eventually reaching number one in August 1985 . 
 Reckless included the hit singles " Run to You " , " Heaven " , " Summer of ' 69 " , " One Night Love Affair " , " Somebody " , and " It 's Only Love " . All the singles had accompanying music videos , and each one charted on the Billboard Hot 100 , with " Run to You " , " Summer of ' 69 " , and " Heaven " peaking in the top ten . " Heaven " would become the most successful single from Reckless at the time of its release on the US music charts , reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and number nine on the mainstream rock chart . 
 The single " It 's Only Love " was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group . In 1986 , the song won an MTV Video Music Award for Best Stage Performance . The album is Adams best @-@ selling album in the United States and was certified five times platinum .

 Aerosmith is an American rock band , sometimes referred to as " the Bad Boys from Boston " and " America 's Greatest Rock and Roll Band " . Their style , which is rooted in blues @-@ based hard rock , has come to also incorporate elements of pop , heavy metal , and rhythm and blues , and has inspired many subsequent rock artists . They were formed in Boston , Massachusetts in 1970 . Guitarist Joe Perry and bassist Tom Hamilton , originally in a band together called the Jam Band , met up with vocalist / pianist / harmonicist Steven Tyler , drummer Joey Kramer , and guitarist Ray Tabano , and formed Aerosmith . In 1971 , Tabano was replaced by Brad Whitford , and the band began developing a following in Boston . 
 They were signed to Columbia Records in 1972 , and released a string of gold and platinum albums , beginning with their 1973 eponymous debut album , followed by Get Your Wings in 1974 . In 1975 , the band broke into the mainstream with the album Toys in the Attic , and their 1976 follow @-@ up Rocks cemented their status as hard rock superstars . Two additional albums followed in 1977 and 1979 . Their first five albums have since attained multi @-@ platinum status . Throughout the 1970s , the band toured extensively and charted a dozen Hot 100 singles . By the end of the decade , they were among the most popular hard rock bands in the world and developed a loyal following of fans , often referred to as the " Blue Army " . However , drug addiction and internal conflict took their toll on the band , which led to the departures of Perry and Whitford in 1979 and 1981 , respectively ; they were replaced by Jimmy Crespo and Rick Dufay . The band did not fare well between 1980 and 1984 , releasing the album Rock in a Hard Place , which was certified gold but failed to match their previous successes . 
 Perry and Whitford returned to Aerosmith in 1984 and the band signed a new deal with Geffen Records . After a comeback tour , the band recorded Done with Mirrors ( 1985 ) , which won some critical praise but failed to come close to commercial expectations . It was not until the band 's collaboration with rap group Run – D.M.C. in 1986 , and the 1987 multi @-@ platinum release Permanent Vacation , that they regained the level of popularity they had experienced in the 1970s . In the late 1980s and 1990s , the band scored several hits and won numerous awards for music from the multi @-@ platinum albums Pump ( 1989 ) , Get a Grip ( 1993 ) , and Nine Lives ( 1997 ) , and embarked on their most extensive concert tours to date . The band also became a pop culture phenomenon with popular music videos and notable appearances in television , film , and video games . Their comeback has been described as one of the most remarkable and spectacular in rock ' n ' roll history . Additional albums followed in 2001 , 2004 , and 2012 . Since 2001 , the band has toured every year except 2008 . After 46 years of performing , the band continues to tour and record music , but is contemplating a farewell tour slated to begin in 2017 . 
 Aerosmith is the best @-@ selling American hard rock band of all time , having sold more than 150 million records worldwide , including over 70 million records in the United States alone . With 25 gold albums , 18 platinum albums , and 12 multi @-@ platinum albums , they hold the record for the most total certifications by an American group and are tied for the most multi @-@ platinum albums by an American group . The band has scored 21 Top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 , nine number @-@ one Mainstream Rock hits , four Grammy Awards , six American Music Awards , and ten MTV Video Music Awards . They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001 , and were included among both Rolling Stone 's and VH1 's lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time . In 2013 , the band 's principal songwriters , Tyler and Perry , were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame .

 In 1964 , Steven Tyler formed his own band called the <unk> — later Chain Reaction — in New Hampshire . Meanwhile , Perry and Hamilton formed the Jam Band ( commonly known as " Joe Perry 's Jam Band " ) , which was based on free @-@ form and blues . Hamilton and Perry moved to Boston , Massachusetts in September 1969 . There they met Joey Kramer , a drummer from Yonkers , New York . Kramer knew Tyler and had always hoped to play in a band with him . Kramer , a Berklee College of Music student , decided to quit school to join Jam Band . 
 In 1970 , Chain Reaction and Jam Band played at the same gig . Tyler immediately loved Jam Band 's sound , and wanted to combine the two bands . In October 1970 , the bands met up again and considered the proposition . Tyler , who had been a drummer and backup singer in Chain Reaction , adamantly refused to play drums in this new band , insisting he would only take part if he could be frontman and lead vocalist . The others agreed , and a new band was born . The band moved into a home together at 1325 Commonwealth Avenue in Boston , where they wrote and rehearsed music together and relaxed in between shows . 
 The members of the band reportedly spent afternoons getting stoned and watching Three Stooges reruns . One day , they had a post @-@ Stooges meeting to try to come up with a name . Kramer said when he was in school he would write the word <unk> all over his notebooks . The name had popped into his head after listening to Harry Nilsson 's album Aerial Ballet , which featured jacket art of a circus performer jumping out of a biplane . Initially , Kramer 's bandmates were unimpressed ; they all thought he was referring to the Sinclair Lewis novel they were required to read in high school English class . " No , not Arrowsmith , " Kramer explained . " A @-@ E @-@ R @-@ O ... Aerosmith . " The band settled upon this name after also considering " the Hookers " and " Spike Jones . " 
 Soon , the band hired Ray Tabano , a childhood friend of Tyler , as rhythm guitarist and began playing local shows . Aerosmith played their first gig in Mendon , Massachusetts at Nipmuc Regional High School ( now <unk> Hill Middle School ) on November 6 , 1970 . In 1971 , Tabano was replaced by Brad Whitford , who also attended the Berklee School of Music and was formerly of the band Earth Inc . Whitford , from Reading , Massachusetts , had already played at Reading 's AW Coolidge Middle School . Other than a period from July 1979 to April 1984 , the line @-@ up of Tyler , Perry , Hamilton , Kramer , and Whitford has stayed the same .

 After forming the band and finalizing the lineup in 1971 , the band started to garner some local success doing live shows . Originally booked through the Ed <unk> Agency , the band signed a promotion deal with Frank Connelly and eventually secured a management deal with David Krebs and Steve Leber in 1972 . Krebs and Leber invited Columbia Records President Clive Davis to see the band at Max 's Kansas City in New York City . Aerosmith was not originally scheduled to play that night at the club , but they paid from their own pockets to secure a place on the bill , reportedly the only band ever to do so at Max 's . " No Surprize " from their Night in the Ruts album celebrates the moment their fame began . 
 Aerosmith signed with Columbia in mid @-@ 1972 for a reported $ 125 @,@ 000 and issued their debut album , Aerosmith . Released in January 1973 , the album peaked at number 166 . The album was straightforward rock and roll with well @-@ defined blues influences , laying the groundwork for Aerosmith 's signature blues rock sound . Although the highest @-@ charting single from the album was " Dream On " at number 59 , several tracks ( such as " Mama Kin " and " Walkin ' the Dog " ) would become staples of the band 's live shows and receive airplay on rock radio . The album reached gold status initially , eventually went on to sell two million copies , and was certified double platinum after the band reached mainstream success over a decade later . After constant touring , the band released their second album Get Your Wings in 1974 , the first of a string of multi @-@ platinum albums produced by Jack Douglas . This album included the rock radio hits " Same Old Song and Dance " and " Train Kept A @-@ Rollin ' " , a cover done previously by the Yardbirds . The album also contained several fan favorites including " Lord of the Thighs " , " Seasons of Wither " , and " S.O.S. ( Too Bad ) " , darker songs which have become staples in the band 's live shows . To date , Get Your Wings has sold three million copies . 
 It was 1975 's Toys in the Attic , however , that established Aerosmith as international stars competing with the likes of Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones . Originally derided as Rolling Stones knockoffs in part due to the physical resemblance between lead singers Steven Tyler and Mick Jagger , Toys in the Attic showed that Aerosmith was a unique and talented band in their own right . Toys in the Attic was an immediate success , starting with the single " Sweet Emotion " , which became the band 's first Top 40 hit . This was followed by a successful re @-@ release of " Dream On " which hit number 6 , becoming their best charting single of the 1970s . " Walk This Way " , re @-@ released in 1976 , reached the Top 10 in early 1977 . 
 In addition , " Toys in the Attic " and " Big Ten Inch Record " ( a song originally recorded by Bull Moose Jackson ) became concert staples . As a result of this success , both of the band 's previous albums re @-@ charted . Toys in the Attic has gone on to become the band 's bestselling studio album in the States , with certified U.S. sales of eight million copies . The band toured in support of Toys in the Attic , where they started to get more recognition . Also around this time , the band established their home base as " the Wherehouse " in Waltham , Massachusetts , where they would record and rehearse music , as well as conduct business . 
 = = = Rocks , Draw the Line and Live ! Bootleg ( 1976 – 1978 ) = = = 
 Aerosmith 's next album was 1976 's Rocks , which " captured Aerosmith at their most raw and rocking " . It went platinum swiftly and featured two FM hits , " Last Child " and " Back in the Saddle " , as well as the ballad " Home Tonight " , which also charted . Rocks has sold four million copies to date . Both Toys in the Attic and Rocks are highly regarded , especially in the hard rock genre , and appear on such lists as Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time , and are cited by members of Guns N ' Roses , Metallica , and Mötley Crüe as having large influences on their music . Kurt Cobain listed Rocks as one of the albums he thought were most influential to Nirvana 's sound in his journal in 1993 . Soon after Rocks was released , the band continued to tour heavily , this time headlining their own shows and playing to several large stadiums and rock festivals . 
 Aerosmith 's next album was 1977 's Draw the Line . The album 's recording was affected by the excesses of the band members , but the record still had memorable moments . The title track charted just shy of the Top 40 and remains a live staple , and " Kings and Queens " also charted . The album went on to sell 2 million copies . The band toured extensively in support of the album , however drug abuse and the fast @-@ paced life of touring and recording began affecting their performances . Lead singer Steven Tyler and lead guitarist Joe Perry became known as " the Toxic Twins " because of their notorious abuse of drugs on and off the stage . While continuing to tour and record into the late 1970s , Aerosmith acted in the movie version of Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band . Their cover of the Beatles hit " Come Together " was included in the album 's soundtrack and would be the band 's last Top 40 hit for nearly 10 years . The live release Live ! Bootleg , originally released as a double album , was put out in 1978 and captured the band 's rawness during the heyday of the Draw the Line tour . The stand @-@ alone single " Chip Away the Stone " was also released in 1978 and charted at number 77 . 
 = = = Departures of Perry and Whitford , Night in the Ruts and Rock in a Hard Place ( 1979 – 1984 ) = = = 
 In 1979 , the band started work on their next album , Night in the Ruts . Aerosmith decided to go on tour during a break in the recording schedule but tensions within the band were slowly coming to a head . The band 's touring schedule brought them to Cleveland Stadium on July 28 , 1979 , where they headlined the World Series of Rock festival . In a heated argument backstage , Joe Perry 's wife , Elissa , threw a glass of milk at Tom Hamilton 's wife , Terry . Following the show , Tyler and Perry got into a heated argument when Tyler confronted Perry about his wife 's antics , and after the course of the argument Perry quit the band and left ( while Tyler claims in his autobiography that he fired Perry from the band ) . In leaving , Perry took some of the music that he had written with him . Shortly after his departure Perry formed a new band called the Joe Perry Project . 
 Since there was still work to be done on Night in the Ruts , Aerosmith needed fill @-@ in musicians to take Perry 's place on the songs that needed to be recorded to complete the album . Rhythm guitarist Brad Whitford took over some of the lead parts and Richie Supa , the band 's longtime writing partner , filled in where needed until the band was able to hire Jimmy Crespo to take over as the full @-@ time guitarist . Night in the Ruts was released in November 1979 , but only managed to sell enough records to be certified Gold at the time ( it would eventually sell enough to be Platinum certified in 1994 ) . The only single the album spawned , a cover of " Remember ( Walking in the Sand ) " by the Shangri @-@ Las , peaked at # 67 on the Billboard Hot 100 . 
 The tour for Night in the Ruts commenced shortly thereafter but the band found themselves playing in smaller and smaller venues than they were before due to their popularity beginning to wane . Steven Tyler 's drug issues were starting to affect his performance and songwriting , and he reached bottom when he collapsed on stage during a show in Portland , Maine in 1980 and did not get up for the remainder of the set . Also in 1980 , Aerosmith released its Greatest Hits album . While the compilation didn 't chart very high initially , it gained popularity later and has gone on to become the band 's bestselling album in the United States , with sales of 11 million copies . In the fall of 1980 , Tyler was injured in a serious motorcycle accident , which left him hospitalized for two months , and unable to tour or record well into 1981 . 
 In 1981 , Aerosmith began work on their next album , which was titled Rock in a Hard Place and saw them reunite with producer Jack Douglas . Once again , though , they would be forced to deal with another departure . After the first song for the album , " Lightning Strikes " , was recorded Brad Whitford departed the band and decided to form a duo with Derek St. Holmes , with whom he recorded a self @-@ titled album that failed to garner much interest . Whitford later joined up with the Joe Perry Project and played with them in 1984 . 
 With Rick Dufay taking Whitford 's place , Rock in a Hard Place was released on August 1 , 1982 . The album reached # 32 on the Billboard 200 album chart . Only one single charted , the aforementioned " Lightning Strikes " , which peaked at number 21 on the Billboard Top Tracks chart . As with the tour for Night in the Ruts , Aerosmith was unable to book larger venues and instead had to rely on filling clubs and theaters , which they struggled to do . At a show in Worcester , Massachusetts , Tyler and Perry reunited and got high backstage before the show . Tyler was so intoxicated that he collapsed on stage again and , like before , could not get up . 
 On February 14 , 1984 , Perry and Whitford saw Aerosmith perform at Boston 's Orpheum Theater . Shortly thereafter , discussions began to reintegrate the two into the band and several months later , the original members of Aerosmith reunited . Steven Tyler recalls : 
 = = = Back in the Saddle reunion tour , Done with Mirrors and drug rehab ( 1984 – 1986 ) = = = 
 In 1984 , Aerosmith embarked on a reunion tour called the Back in the Saddle Tour , which led to the live album Classics Live II . While concerts on the tour were well @-@ attended , it was plagued with several incidents , mostly attributed to drug abuse by band members . Their problems still not behind them , the group was signed to Geffen Records and began working on a comeback . Despite the band signing on to a new record company , the band 's old label Columbia continued to reap the benefits of Aerosmith 's comeback , releasing the live companion albums Classics Live I and II and the collection Gems . 
 In 1985 , the band released the album Done with Mirrors , their first studio album since reuniting . While the album did receive some positive reviews , it only went gold and failed to produce a hit single or generate any widespread interest . The album 's most notable track , " Let the Music Do the Talking " , was in fact a cover of a song originally recorded by the Joe Perry Project and released on that band 's album of the same name . Nevertheless , the band became a popular concert attraction once again , touring in support of Done With Mirrors , well into 1986 . In 1986 , Tyler and Perry appeared on Run – D.M.C. ' s cover of " Walk This Way " , a track blending rock and roll with hip hop . In reaching number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 , the song and its frequently @-@ aired video confirmed rap 's mainstream appeal and resurrected Aerosmith 's career by introducing the band 's music to a new generation . 
 Yet the band members ' drug problems still stood in their way . In 1986 , Tyler completed a successful drug rehabilitation program , after an intervention by his fellow band members , a doctor , and manager Tim Collins , who believed that the band 's future would not be bright if Tyler did not get treated . The rest of the band members also completed drug rehab programs over the course of the next couple of years . According to the band 's tell @-@ all autobiography , Collins pledged in September 1986 he could make Aerosmith the biggest band in the world by 1990 if they all completed drug rehab . Their next album was crucial because of the commercial disappointment of Done With Mirrors , and as the band members became clean , they worked hard to make their next album a success . 
 = = = Permanent Vacation and Pump ( 1987 – 1991 ) = = = 
 Permanent Vacation was released in September 1987 , becoming a major hit and the band 's bestselling album in over a decade ( selling 5 million copies in the U.S. ) , with all three of its singles ( " Dude ( Looks Like a Lady ) " , " Rag Doll " , and " Angel " ) reaching the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 . Steven Tyler reveals in his autobiography that the album was " ... the first one we ever did sober . " Part of Permanent Vacation 's commercial success involved producer Bruce Fairbairn whose production touches ( such as sound effects and high @-@ quality recording ) added interest to the album and the use of outside songwriters such as Desmond Child , Jim Vallance , and Holly Knight who assisted the band with lyrics . While the group was initially hesitant to using outside songwriters , including Tyler being furious for Knight getting songwriting credits for changing one word ( " Rag Time " became " Rag Doll " ) , the method paid off , as Permanent Vacation became the band 's most successful album in a decade . The group went on a subsequent tour with labelmates Guns N ' Roses ( who have cited Aerosmith as a major influence ) , which was intense at times because of Aerosmith 's new struggle to stay clean amidst Guns N ' Roses ' well @-@ publicized , rampant drug use . 
 Aerosmith 's next album was even more successful . Pump , released in September 1989 , featured three Top Ten singles : " What It Takes " , " Janie 's Got a Gun " , and " Love in an Elevator " , as well as the Top 30 " The Other Side " , re @-@ establishing the band as a serious musical force . Pump was a critical and commercial success , eventually selling 7 million copies , spawning several music videos that were in regular rotation on MTV , and achieving four @-@ star ratings from major music magazines . Pump ranked as the fourth @-@ bestselling album of 1990 . The band also won its first Grammy in the category of Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal , for " Janie 's Got a Gun " . In addition , the video for " Janie 's Got a Gun " won two Video Music Awards and was ranked as one of the 100 greatest videos of all time by Rolling Stone , MTV , and VH1 . Like Permanent Vacation , Pump was produced by Bruce Fairbairn , who added production touches such as instrumental interludes that provided transitions between songs to give the album a more complete sound , as well as the Margarita Horns , who added horns to tracks such as " Love in an Elevator " and " The Other Side " . Rock critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine claimed that Pump " revels in [ pop concessions ] without ever losing sight of Aerosmith 's dirty hard rock core " , going on to say that , " such ambition and successful musical <unk> make Pump rank with Toys in the Attic and Rocks . " The recording process for Pump was documented in the video The Making of Pump , which has since been re @-@ released as a DVD . The music videos for the album 's singles were featured on the release Things That Go Pump in the Night , which quickly went platinum . 
 In support of Pump , the band embarked on the 12 @-@ month Pump Tour , which lasted for most of 1990 . On February 21 , 1990 , the band appeared in a " Wayne 's World " sketch on Saturday Night Live , debating the fall of communism and the Soviet Union , and performed their recent hits " Janie 's Got a Gun " and " Monkey on My Back " . The appearance of the band in the " Wayne 's World " sketch was later ranked by E ! as the number @-@ one moment in the history of the program . On August 11 , 1990 , the band 's performance on MTV 's Unplugged aired . In October 1990 , the Pump Tour ended , with the band 's first ever performances in Australia . That same year , the band was also inducted to the Hollywood Rock Walk . In November 1991 , the band appeared on The Simpsons episode " Flaming Moe 's " and released a box set titled Pandora 's Box . In coordination with the release of Pandora 's Box , the band 's 1975 hit " Sweet Emotion " was re @-@ mixed and re @-@ released as a single , and a music video was created to promote the single . Also in 1991 , the band performed their 1973 single " Dream On " with Michael Kamen 's orchestra for MTV 's 10th Anniversary special ; this performance was used as the official music video for the song . In 1992 , Tyler and Perry appeared live as guests of Guns N ' Roses during the latter 's 1992 worldwide pay @-@ per @-@ view show in Paris , performing a medley of " Mama Kin " ( which GN <unk> covered in 1986 ) and " Train Kept @-@ A Rollin " . 
 = = = Get a Grip and Big Ones ( 1992 – 1995 ) = = = 
 The band took a brief break before recording their follow @-@ up to Pump in 1992 . Despite significant shifts in mainstream music at the beginning of the 1990s , 1993 's Get a Grip was just as successful commercially , becoming their first album to debut at number 1 and racking up sales of 7 million copies in a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year timespan . The first singles were the hard rocking " Livin ' on the Edge " and " Eat the Rich " . Though many critics were unimpressed by the focus on the subsequent interchangeable power @-@ ballads in promoting the album , all three ( " Cryin ' " , " Crazy " and " Amazing " ) proved to be huge successes on radio and MTV . The music videos featured then up @-@ and @-@ coming actress Alicia Silverstone ; her provocative performances earned her the title of " the Aerosmith chick " for the first half of the decade . Steven Tyler 's daughter Liv Tyler was also featured in the " Crazy " video . Get a Grip would go on to sell more than 7 million copies in the U.S. alone , and over 20 million copies worldwide . The band won two Grammy Awards for songs from this album in the category of Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal : for " Livin ' on the Edge " in 1994 and " Crazy " in 1995 . 
 During the making of Get a Grip , the management and record company brought in a variety of professional songwriting collaborators to help give nearly all the songs on the album more commercial appeal , a trend which would continue until the early 2000s . However , this led to accusations of selling out that would continue throughout the 1990s . In addition to Aerosmith 's grueling 18 month world tour in support of Get a Grip , the band also did a number of things to help promote themselves and their album and appeal to youth culture , including the appearance of the band in the movie Wayne 's World 2 where they performed two songs , the appearance of the band and their music in the video games Revolution X and Quest for Fame , performing at Woodstock ' 94 , using their song " Deuces Are Wild " in The Beavis and Butt @-@ head Experience , and opening their own club , The Mama Kin Music Hall , in Boston , MA in 1994 . That same year saw the release of the band 's compilation for Geffen Records , entitled Big Ones featuring their biggest hits from Permanent Vacation , Pump , and Get a Grip , " Deuces Are Wild " from the Beavis and Butt @-@ head Experience , as well as two new songs , " Blind Man " and " Walk on Water " , both of which experienced great success on the rock charts . 
 = = = Nine Lives and " I Don 't Want to Miss a Thing " ( 1996 – 2000 ) = = = 
 Aerosmith had signed a $ 30 million contract for four records with Columbia Records / Sony Music in 1991 , but had only recorded three of their six contractual albums with Geffen Records at that point ( Done with Mirrors , Permanent Vacation , and Pump ) . Between 1991 and 1996 , they released two more albums with Geffen ( Get a Grip and Big Ones ) , which meant they now had five albums with Geffen under their belt ( along with a planned live compilation ) , which meant they could now begin recording for their new contract with Columbia . The band took time off with their families before working on their next album , Nine Lives , which was plagued with personnel problems , including the firing of manager Tim Collins , who , according to band members , had nearly caused the band to break up . The album 's producer was also changed from Glen Ballard to Kevin Shirley . Nine Lives was released in March 1997 . Reviews were mixed , and Nine Lives initially fell down the charts , although it had a long chart life and sold double platinum in the United States alone , fueled by its singles , " Falling in Love ( Is Hard on the Knees ) " , the ballad " Hole in My Soul " , and the crossover @-@ pop smash " Pink " ( which won the band their fourth Grammy Award in 1999 in the Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal category ) . It was followed by the over two @-@ year @-@ long Nine Lives Tour , which was plagued by problems including lead singer Steven Tyler injuring his leg at a concert , and Joey Kramer suffering second degree burns when his car caught fire at a gas station . 
 In 1998 , in the midst of setbacks during the Nine Lives Tour , the band released the single " I Don 't Want to Miss a Thing " , the love theme , written by Diane Warren for the 1998 film Armageddon , starring Steven Tyler 's daughter Liv . The song became Aerosmith 's first and only number 1 single when it debuted at the top position on the Billboard Hot 100 and stayed on top of the charts for four weeks . The song was nominated for an Academy Award in 1999 . The song helped open Aerosmith up to a new generation and remains a slow @-@ dance staple . 1998 also saw the release of the double @-@ live album , A Little South of Sanity , which was assembled from performances on the Get a Grip and Nine Lives tours . The album went platinum shortly after its release . The band continued with their seemingly neverending world tours promoting Nine Lives and the " I Don 't Want to Miss a Thing " single well into 1999 . 
 In 1999 , Aerosmith was featured in the Disney Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World ( and later in 2001 at Disneyland Paris in the Walt Disney Studios Park ) ride , Rock ' n ' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith , providing the ride 's soundtrack and theme .

They were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame soon after their album was released , in late March 2001 . Aerosmith is the only band to be inducted to the Hall of Fame with a song active in the charts ( " Jaded " ) . Later that year , the band performed as part of the United We Stand : What More Can I Give benefit concert in Washington D.C. for 9 / 11 victims and their families . The band flew back to Indianapolis for a show the same night , as part of their Just Push Play Tour . 
 The band started 2002 by ending the Just Push Play tour , and simultaneously recording segments for their Behind the Music special on VH1 , which not only chronicled the band 's history but also the band 's current activities and touring . The special was one of the few Behind the Musics to run two hours in length . In May , Aerosmith covered the " Theme from Spider @-@ Man " for the soundtrack of the 2002 film of the same name .

 Aerosmith 's long @-@ promised blues album Honkin ' on Bobo was released in 2004 . This was a return to the band 's roots , including recording the album in live sessions , working with former producer Jack Douglas , and laying down their blues rock grit . It was followed by a live DVD , You Gotta Move , in December 2004 , culled from performances on the Honkin ' on Bobo Tour . " Dream On " was also featured in an advertising campaign for Buick in 2004 , targeting that marque 's market which is now composed largely of people who were teenagers when the song first charted . 
 2005 saw Steven Tyler appear in the film Be Cool . Joe Perry released his self @-@ titled solo album that same year . At the 2006 Grammy Awards , he was nominated for Best Rock Instrumental Performance for the track " Mercy " , but lost to Les Paul . In October 2005 , Aerosmith released a CD / DVD Rockin ' the Joint . The band hit the road for the Rockin ' the Joint Tour on October 30 with Lenny Kravitz for a fall / winter tour of arenas in the largest U.S. markets . The band planned to tour with Cheap Trick in the spring , hitting secondary markets in the U.S. Almost all of this leg of the tour was canceled , however . Dates were initially canceled one by one until March 22 , 2006 , when it was announced that lead singer Steven Tyler needed throat surgery , and the remaining dates on the tour were subsequently canceled . 
 Aerosmith commenced recording a new album on Armed Forces Day 2006 . Tyler and Perry performed with the Boston Pops Orchestra for their annual July 4 concert on the Esplanade in 2006 , a milestone as it was the first major event or performance since Steven Tyler 's throat surgery .

In the spring , the band toured Latin America to sold @-@ out stadium crowds .

Additionally , the band played in Middle East countries such as the United Arab Emirates and India for the first time . The band also played a few select dates in California and Canada in late July . One such date , a July 21 concert in Prince Edward Island , was the largest in that province 's history . In September , the band performed eight dates in major markets in Northeastern North America . These shows were opened by Joan Jett . The band also played a private gig in Hawaii . A public show in Maui was canceled for logistical reasons , which spurred a class action lawsuit against the band . In April 2009 , Aerosmith agreed to compensate all ticket buyers of the canceled show with a free ticket to a rescheduled Maui show to be held on October 20 , 2009 , along with reimbursements of all out @-@ of @-@ pocket expenses related to the show . 
 On November 1 , 2007 , the band entered the studio to work on the final studio album of their current contract with Sony . At the time , it was believed that the album would include both re @-@ recorded tracks left off previous albums as well as brand new material . In an interview , guitarist Joe Perry revealed that in addition to creating a new album , the band was working closely with the makers of the Guitar Hero series to develop Guitar Hero : Aerosmith , a video game dedicated to the band 's music . The game was released on June 29 , 2008 and contains many of their most popular songs . Steven Tyler announced on VH1 Classic Radio on September 4 , 2008 that Aerosmith intends to enter the studio at the end of September 2008 to complete the band 's 15th studio album . Tyler also confirmed that the band plans to begin a new U.S. tour in June 2009 , in support of the as @-@ yet @-@ untitled album . This tour was supposed to be preceded by a concert in Venezuela on February 1 , 2009 . However , on January 15 , 2009 , Tyler said the band would be unable to play the gig because of a second knee injury of guitarist Joe Perry . In mid @-@ February 2009 , it was announced that the album would be produced by the famed Brendan O 'Brien and that the album would likely be recorded live , like their earlier records . Although the band had hoped to finish the album before the tour started in June 2009 , Perry said that the group " realized there wasn 't any chance of getting [ the album ] finished before we hit the road for the summer . " The tour featured ZZ Top as the opening act for most of the tour . The Aerosmith / ZZ Top Tour , presented by Guitar Hero : Aerosmith , was officially announced and the first dates released on April 8 , 2009 . 
 The tour was slated to take the band across North America from June to September 2009 . The tour featured the band perform nearly all of the songs on the band 's 1975 album Toys in the Attic during the first seven dates of the tour and also featured Joe Perry sing lead vocals on the 1976 deep cut " Combination " . The tour was plagued with several health problems , however . Guitarist Brad Whitford had to sit out the first seven dates of the tour in order to recover from head surgery , after injuring his head getting out of his car . On June 28 , 2009 , at the band 's seventh show of the tour at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville , Connecticut , lead singer Steven Tyler injured his leg , which required seven shows to be postponed . As soon as the band resumed the tour on July 15 , Whitford returned to the fold . However , Tom Hamilton had to depart the tour in order to recover from non @-@ invasive surgery . On August 5 , 2009 , Tyler was rushed to the hospital after falling from the stage at a concert in Sturgis , South Dakota . He was helped up by security staff and taken backstage , before guitarist Joe Perry told the audience the show was over . Tyler was airlifted to Rapid City Regional Hospital , where he received treatment for head and neck injuries and a broken shoulder . In the wake of Tyler 's injuries , the band was forced to postpone five shows in Western Canada . On August 14 , 2009 , Aerosmith announced that they had decided to cancel the rest of their U.S. tour dates with ZZ Top , due to Tyler 's injuries . 
 In the midst of the tour , Perry completed work on his fifth solo album , Have Guitar , Will Travel and drummer Joey Kramer released his autobiography , Hit Hard . Perry 's solo album was released on October 6 , 2009 .

 Tyler pulled out of a planned South American tour at the end of 2009 and seemed intent on pursuing solo projects , including his autobiography Does the Noise in My Head Bother You ? . Tyler told Classic Rock magazine , " I don 't know what I 'm doing yet , but it 's definitely going to be something Steven Tyler : working on the brand of myself – Brand Tyler . " Meanwhile , guitarist Joe Perry toured the United States at the end of 2009 , and Japan and the UK early in 2010 . 
 In November 2009 , Joe Perry stated that Tyler had not been in contact with the band and could be on the verge of quitting Aerosmith . Perry stated that the rest of the group was " looking for a new singer to work with . " It was reported that singer Lenny Kravitz had been approached for Steven Tyler 's position , which he then declined . 
 However , despite the rumors of him leaving the band , Tyler joined the Joe Perry Project onstage on November 10 , 2009 at the Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza , and Tyler and Perry performed the Aerosmith single " Walk This Way " together . According to sources at the event , Tyler assured the crowd that he was " not quitting Aerosmith " . 
 On December 22 , People magazine reported that Tyler had entered a rehabilitation facility to manage his addiction to painkillers , brought on by injuries to his knees , legs , and feet , that resulted from years of performing . In his statement , Tyler said he is grateful for the support he is receiving , is committed to getting things taken care of , and is eager to get back on stage and in the recording studio with his bandmates . 
 On January 20 , 2010 , Perry confirmed the band were about to audition for a new singer to replace Tyler . Perry said Tyler 's surgery to his legs would " take him out of the picture " for up to a year and a half , and in the meantime , the rest of the band wanted to continue performing . Perry also said that the band would be willing to continue working with Tyler in the future if the singer wanted to .

Many of the concerts were in locations the band canceled on in 2009 . As part of the tour , the band played Fenway Park in Boston with fellow Bostonians the J. Geils Band . 
 Problems on the band 's Cocked , Locked , and Ready to Rock Tour arose in August 2010 , including Tyler accidentally hitting Joe Perry in the head with his microphone stand at a show in Wantagh , New York and Perry bumping into Tyler at the Toronto show , which caused Tyler to tumble off the stage . Perry suffered a minor head injury at the Wantagh show and Tyler was helped back up by fans and Perry at the Toronto show , and both shows went on . Around the same time as these incidents , tension flared again between Perry and Tyler due to Tyler 's plans to become a talent judge on American Idol . Perry criticized Tyler for not consulting the rest of the band , saying that he " found out on the internet , like the rest of the world " and that nobody else in the band knew anything about it . 
 On August 18 , it was reported that Tyler officially signed on with the show . When asked about this in October , Perry declared he understood Tyler 's reasons and wished him luck , but stated that he would seek different projects – " I 'm tired of waiting around , so I 'm not passing up anything right now " . 
 While announcing the Cocked , Locked , and Ready to Rock Tour in 2009 , Tyler and Perry said that the next item on the agenda was a new Aerosmith album , the group 's first since 2004 's Honkin ' on Bobo . The group did some recording with producer Brendan O 'Brien in 2008 but halted because of Tyler 's health problems . Aerosmith bassist Tom Hamilton told the Boston Herald in September 2010 that Tyler believes he has the time and energy to continue fronting the band while also being a judge on American Idol . 
 Hamilton explained , " Steven 's been very emphatic in saying that the way his time is arranged on the show leaves room to work on a record . He 's been taking great pains to remind everybody of that , so hopefully that 's the way it will come out . " On November 5 , 2010 , Brad Whitford said the recording sessions will probably be in Los Angeles , where American Idol is headquartered , and a world tour would follow .

Perry has suggested the tour could last for two years and Tyler said it could potentially last " forever " ; Whitford and Tyler also discussed the potential of doing one last studio album . 
 On July 10 , 2016 , Perry collapsed onstage at a concert he was performing with the Hollywood Vampires on Coney Island in Brooklyn , New York . It is believed he suffered cardiac arrest , was revived , and rushed to the hospital , but was quickly upgraded to stable condition later that night . The Vampires continued the show without Perry that evening and will continue their tour , but canceled an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert . Perry is resting and expected to make a full recovery ; he is expected to return onstage soon . 
 From September through October 2016 , Aerosmith will embark on a 10 @-@ date tour of Latin America preceded by a September 16 performance at the <unk> Festival in San Diego , California . 
 = = Influence and legacy = = 
 Influenced by bands such as the Beatles , the Rolling Stones , the Yardbirds , Led Zeppelin and the New York Dolls , Aerosmith proved to be a major influence themselves on subsequently massively successful bands and musicians ; according to Perry , Eddie Van Halen once told him that his band Van Halen " started out on the suburban L.A. club circuit , playing Aerosmith songs " . Aerosmith 's influence was evident on the next generation of hard rock and heavy metal bands , namely Mötley Crüe , Ratt , Guns N ' Roses , Tesla , L.A. Guns , Cinderella , Faster Pussycat , Skid Row , Extreme ( themselves Boston natives ) , Warrant , the Black Crowes and the <unk> , as well as Metallica , Metal Church and Testament . Especially , Guns N ' Roses and Velvet Revolver guitarist Slash has stated that Aerosmith is his favorite band , and Mötley Crüe 's Nikki Sixx has expressed massive admiration for the band and its early records in both The Dirt and The Heroin Diaries . Members of Nirvana , Pearl Jam , Stone Temple Pilots and Godsmack were also self @-@ professed early Aerosmith fans . 
 The interplay between Joe Perry and Brad Whitford has been inspiring to many bands , especially Guns N ' Roses . Joe Perry has received wide recognition and praise as a lead guitarist , and has shared the stage many times with Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck , who Perry cites as primary influences . He and Tyler were asked by Page to induct Led Zeppelin into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ; during the ceremony , which took place in 1995 , Tyler and Perry delivered their speech and joined the band onstage for a brief set . During Beck 's and Metallica 's induction in 2009 , they invited Perry and Page to play the Yardbirds / Zeppelin / Aerosmith classic " Train Kept A @-@ Rollin ' " . Other collaborations , either by individual members of the band or by Aerosmith as a whole , have included Alice Cooper on his Trash album , Guns N ' Roses ( who opened for Aerosmith during their 1988 tour and had covered " Mama Kin " on their first release ) and B 'z . As a testimony to their importance in American popular culture as a whole , Aerosmith have also collaborated with popular non @-@ rock artists , such as Run @-@ DMC , Eminem ( " Sing for the Moment " ) , and Carrie Underwood , and performed with ' N Sync , Britney Spears , Mary J. Blige , and Nelly for the Super Bowl XXXV halftime show . Country artists Garth Brooks and Mark Chesnutt both scored hit singles with covers of Aerosmith songs ; Brooks in 1995 with " The Fever " , a reworking of Aerosmith 's 1993 song , and Chesnutt in 1999 with a cover of Aerosmith 's 1998 song " I Don 't Want to Miss a Thing " . 
 Like many of their 1970s contemporaries including Led Zeppelin and Alice Cooper , the members of Aerosmith were prone to excess and debauchery . Drug consumption was rampant ; the recording sessions for 1976 's Rocks and 1977 's Draw the Line were especially noted for their substance indulgence , including heroin . In the words of Bebe Buell , " They [ Aerosmith ] were like a gang of kids with their own planes , Porsches , millions of dollars , limitless resources . [ ... ] Mick Jagger and Jimmy Page had control , but these boys did not care . They won the prize , hands down , for the <unk> rock ' n ' roll band in that era . No question . " 
 In the mid- to late @-@ 1970s , the band enjoyed tremendous popularity in the United States and in Japan , though they failed to make a big impression in Britain . Still , they were among the most popular hard rock acts in America in the late 1970s , along with Heart , Kiss , Ted Nugent , ZZ Top and Boston . Their massive popularity waned , however , following Joe Perry and Brad Whitford 's departures . Following both guitarists ' return to the band and its complete drug cleanup , Aerosmith made a prodigious return to success , once described as " the single most successful comeback in the history of heavy metal , if not all of popular music . " During both the 1970s and the 1987 – 1995 era , Aerosmith undertook grueling world tours that numbered in the triple digits numbers of dates , headlining or co @-@ headlining festivals along the way , such as the <unk> Jam in 1978 and 1987 , the Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington in 1990 and 1994 , and Woodstock ' 94 . 
 Initially resistant to this medium , the band later became renowned and received numerous awards for pioneering expansive , conceptual music videos , such as those for " Janie 's Got A Gun " ( directed by future Fight Club director David Fincher ) , " Livin ' on the Edge " , " Cryin ' " , " Amazing " , " Crazy " , " Falling in Love ( Is Hard on the Knees ) " , and " Pink " . 
 The band 's music has also been featured in several video games , such as episodes of the Dead or Alive and Grand Theft Auto series , and some video games are centered on the band , like Quest for Fame and Revolution X. Aerosmith was the first band to have its band @-@ centered Guitar Hero title , Guitar Hero : Aerosmith , which is considered to be the best @-@ selling band @-@ centric video game across both the Guitar Hero and Rock Band platforms .

 = Typhoon Pongsona = 
 Typhoon Pongsona was the last typhoon of the 2002 Pacific typhoon season , and was the second costliest United States disaster in 2002 , only behind Hurricane Lili . The name " Pongsona " was contributed by North Korea for the Pacific tropical cyclone list and is the Korean name for the garden balsam . Pongsona developed out of an area of disturbed weather on December 2 , and steadily intensified to reach typhoon status on December 5 . On December 8 it passed through Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands while near its peak winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph 10 @-@ min ) . It ultimately turned to the northeast , weakened , and became extratropical on December 11 . 
 Typhoon Pongsona produced strong wind gusts peaking at 278 km / h ( 173 mph 1 @-@ min ) , which left the entire island of Guam without power and destroyed about 1 @,@ 300 houses . With strong building standards and experience from repeated typhoon strikes , there were no fatalities directly related to Pongsona , although there was one indirect death from flying glass . Damage on the island totaled over $ 700 million ( 2002 USD , $ 921 million 2016 USD ) , making Pongsona among the five costliest typhoons on the island . The typhoon also caused heavy damage on Rota and elsewhere in the Northern Mariana Islands , and as a result of its impact the name was retired . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 During late November , an area of convection persisted about 625 kilometers ( 390 mi ) east @-@ southeast of Pohnpei . Satellite imagery indicated broad cyclonic turning in the lower levels of the atmosphere , and a trough was located near the surface . The disturbance developed rainbands and gradually became better organized . By December 2 , the system had an elongated low @-@ level circulation , located to the south of the convection . At 0600 UTC that day , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) classified the system as a tropical depression about 735 km ( 450 mi ) east @-@ northeast of Pohnpei . Shortly thereafter , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert , and at 1800 UTC on December 2 the agency classified the system as Tropical Depression 31W . Initially the depression moved to the west @-@ northwest , and early on December 3 the JTWC classified the system as a tropical storm . 
 Initially , the circulation was exposed from the convection , although it was able to intensify into Tropical Storm Pongsona at 1200 UTC on December 3 while located 375 km ( 230 mi ) northeast of Pohnpei . It turned to the west on December 4 , due to a ridge to the north . It slowly intensified , developing an eye feature on December 5 . That day , both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded Pongsona to a typhoon about 1150 km ( 715 mi ) southeast of Guam . 
 While continuing generally to the west , the eye of Pongsona gradually became better organized . A baroclinic cyclone east of Japan weakened the ridge , which caused the typhoon to turn more to the northwest . By late on December 7 , Pongsona developed a well @-@ defined 55 km ( 35 mi ) wide eye as it approached Guam . After the typhoon underwent rapid deepening , the JTWC estimated that Pongsona reached peak winds of 240 km / h ( 150 mph 1 @-@ min sustained ) , making it a <unk> . At 0500 UTC on December 8 , the eyewall made landfall on Guam , and two hours later the northern portion of the eyewall crossed over nearby Rota . Around that time , the JMA estimated Pongsona attained a peak intensity of 175 km / h ( 110 mph 10 @-@ min winds ) just to the north of Guam . The typhoon turned to the north @-@ northwest through a weakness in the subtropical ridge a short distance west of the Northern Mariana Islands . On December 9 , convection began to weaken as Pongsona began interacting with a mid @-@ latitude system to its north . Dry air became entrained in the southwestern portion of the circulation , and the circulation became exposed from the diminishing convection . As a result , both the JTWC and the JMA declared Pongsona as an extratropical cyclone on December 11 about 1400 km ( 865 mi ) northwest of Wake Island . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 The Guam National Weather Service office issued a tropical storm watch for the Marshall Islands shortly after Pongsona developed into a tropical storm , and a day later watches were issued for Chuuk . On December 5 , the service issued tropical storm warnings for parts of the Federated States of Micronesia . As Pongsona became a typhoon , the Guam National Weather Service office issued a typhoon watch for Guam , Rota , Saipan , and Tinian , which was upgraded to a typhoon warning about 23 hours prior to the onset of tropical storm @-@ force winds ; typhoon warnings were also issued for the unpopulated island of Agrihan . By one day before the typhoon moved through the Mariana Islands , JTWC predicted Pongsona to pass well east of the area . Despite a more westward track than anticipated , forecasts remained stagnant until the morning of December 8 , when forecasters reluctantly predicted much greater threat to the Mariana Islands . As a result , many citizens felt they were unprepared and insufficiently warned for the typhoon . 
 Nine shelters throughout the Northern Mariana Islands were opened to accommodate families needing assistance . Several schools opened classrooms as evacuation centers . On Guam , ten schools were used as shelters , and on the day of impact 2 @,@ 271 people were in shelters . On Rota , 159 people sought shelter , and in Saipan , 549 were in shelters by the day of impact . The Guam Memorial Hospital officials advised all pregnant women within 32 weeks of their delivery date to check in . The Guam Office of Civil Defense filed the paperwork for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to declare the island a disaster area . Governor Carl T.C. Gutierrez took similar measures to declare a state of emergency for the area . Following experience from previous typhoons , Guam newspaper Pacific Daily News underwent preparations to provide internet updates for the storm , including reinforcing the building , maintaining sufficient food supplies for the staff , and stationing two reporters elsewhere on the island ; the paper was the only immediate source of information about the typhoon outside of Guam .

 Early in its duration , Pongsona first affected Pohnpei as a tropical storm . There , it produced heavy rains and gusty winds , though little damage was reported . Later , it brought tropical storm force winds to Chuuk . High waves from the storm washed over and covered some atolls . 
 = = = Guam = = = 
 Typhoon Pongsona maintained a 65 km ( 40 mi ) wide eye upon crossing the northern portion of the island of Guam ; the Andersen Air Force Base was in the eye for two hours . Sustained winds from the typhoon peaked at 232 km / h ( 144 mph ) with gusts peaking at 278 km / h ( 173 mph ) ; gusts of at least 160 km / h ( 100 mph ) affected the entire island . The lowest pressure on the island was 935 millibars ( 27 @.@ 61 inHg ) , making Pongsona the third most intense typhoon to strike Guam ; it is behind only a typhoon in 1900 ( 926 mbar , 27 @.@ 34 inHg ) and Typhoon Karen of 1962 ( 932 mbar , 27 @.@ 52 inHg ) . 
 Communications on the island failed due to the winds ; the entire island was left without power and phone service . The winds greatly damaged 715 power poles and 513 transformers , leaving about $ 52 million in electrical damage reported ( 2002 USD , $ 68 @.@ 4 million 2016 USD ) . The local weather office 's communication link was cut off after flooding damaged a telecommunication facility , causing the National Weather Service in Honolulu , Hawaii , to provide backup support by temporarily issuing warnings and advisories . Many anemometers near the northern coastline failed from the winds . The winds collapsed several walls at the Guam Memorial Hospital , resulting in major damage throughout the northern two @-@ thirds of the facility and several units being shut down . Several hotels , churches , and schools received moderate damage , and the Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport received damage to navigation equipment . Typhoon Pongsona also left 65 % of the island 's water wells inoperable , with most of Guam left without water service following the storm . Officials estimate the typhoon destroyed 1 @,@ 300 homes , severely damaged 1 @,@ 825 , and lightly damaged 4 @,@ 800 . 
 Tracking slowly across the center of the island , the intense inner rainbands dropped heavy rainfall which peaked at 650 mm ( 25 @.@ 61 in ) at the University of Guam . The precipitation led to record river flow on the Pago and Asan Rivers ; overflown rivers caused damage to some roads and bridges . The rainfall also caused extensive flooding in several villages . Pongsona produced a storm surge of up to 6 m ( 20 ft ) at some locations , with 3 – 4 m ( 9 – 13 ft ) recorded near the eyewall . Considerable storm surge flooding occurred from Tumon southward to Piti , leaving some buildings on the west coast of the island flooded with 1 m ( 4 ft ) of water . The combination of strong storm surge and rough waves caused considerable beach erosion and severe coastal damage . 
 Across Guam , damage totaled over $ 700 million ( 2002 USD , $ 921 million 2016 USD ) , placing it among the five costliest typhoons on the island . The typhoon injured 193 people , as reported by the Guam Department of Health ; most were lacerations and fractures caused by flying glass and other debris . There was one indirect death attributed to the storm , when a 71 @-@ year @-@ old woman was cut by flying glass and subsequently suffered a fatal heart attack ; medical help could not reach her due to the intensity of the storm . As six typhoons had passed directly over the island during the previous ten years , officials in Guam enacted strong building standards , keeping deaths and injuries to a minimum . The typhoon was considered by the public the worst typhoon to ever strike the island due to the large eye affecting most of the population . 
 = = = Northern Mariana Islands = = = 
 Pongsona produced sustained winds of 126 km / h ( 78 mph ) with a gust to 137 km / h ( 85 mph ) on Rota . The combination of winds and other effects from the typhoon destroyed 114 houses , severely damaged 154 , and caused minor damage to 306 ; on the island , about 200 families were left homeless . The typhoon produced a storm surge of 6 @.@ 7 m ( 22 ft ) at the village of <unk> , which crossed about 80 % of the southwestern peninsula on Rota . The surge caused moderate beach erosion on the island , and destroyed a fuel pier and a loading pipeline . Additionally , the typhoon caused severe crop damage on the island . In all , the typhoon caused ten minor injuries on Rota , and resulted in over $ 30 million in damage ( 2002 USD , $ 39 @.@ 5 million 2016 USD ) . 
 On Tinian , the passage of Pongsona destroyed two homes ; seven received major damage and another eight sustained minor damage . The winds damaged power lines , causing two island @-@ wide power outages . Major crop damage was reported . 
 On Saipan , two houses were destroyed and fifteen were damaged , seven severely . Sustained winds on the island peaked at 71 km / h ( 44 mph ) , which caused scattered power outages . Six minor injuries were reported , and damage totaled about $ 100 @,@ 000 ( 2002 USD , $ 132 thousand 2016 USD ) . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 On the same day that Typhoon Pongsona struck Guam , President George W. Bush declared the island a major disaster area . Around the time of the cyclone passing over the island , 2 @,@ 271 residents were in shelters , and by the next day it increased to 3 @,@ 467 after people discovered their homes were uninhabitable . With thirteen Red Cross shelters across Guam , most remained in shelters for about three weeks before disaster tents were distributed . The American Red Cross worked with the United States Department of Agriculture to provide meals for shelter attendees for a two @-@ week period following the typhoon . Through the collaboration of federal and other agencies , disaster assistance on Guam totaled over $ 300 million ( 2003 USD , $ 335 million 2007 USD ) by 100 days after the typhoon struck , including $ 60 million ( 2002 USD , $ 78 @.@ 9 million 2016 USD ) in initial disaster response . Nearly 29 @,@ 000 individuals registered for disaster assistance , with the first assistance check arrived ten days after the disaster declaration . By three months after the storm , the United States Small Business Administration approved $ 130 million ( 2003 USD , $ 167 million 2016 USD ) in low @-@ interest loans . 
 During the height of the typhoon at Cabras Island on Guam , a gasoline tank caught fire , believed to be from friction caused by extremely high winds running through its ventilation system . The tank exploded , sending its lid airborne and spreading the fire to other nearby tanks . The proximity of the tanks as well as low water pressure hampered firefighting efforts , and the fire was extinguished five days later ; it resulted in three destroyed gasoline tanks with two more caught on fire . While the fire was burning , transportation of gasoline from the port to the rest of Guam was suspended resulting in a halt in gasoline sales for the general public . 
 On December 11 , 2002 , President Bush extended the disaster declaration to include the Northern Mariana Islands , which allocated emergency disaster aid for the territory . The declaration provided funding for 75 % of the budget for debris removal and emergency protective measures . Immediately following the typhoon , FEMA assigned various federal agencies to respond to the island of Rota . Officials airlifted about 3 @,@ 600 kg ( 8 @,@ 000 lbs ) of emergency supplies including tents , tarps , water containers , coolers , cooking kits and electrical equipment . Military personnel were transported to assist in recovery efforts . By four months after the typhoon , 749 individuals on the island registered through FEMA 's <unk> number . The United States Small Business Administration approved 147 low – interest loans for $ 9 @.@ 1 million ( 2003 USD , $ 11 @.@ 7 million 2016 USD ) to individuals and businesses and for economic injury on Rota . In all , disaster aid to Rota totaled $ 17 @.@ 4 million ( 2003 USD , $ 22 @.@ 4 million . Additionally , President Bush authorized disaster assistance for the Federated States of Micronesia . 
 Due to the damage resulted from the storm , the name Pongsona was retired during the 38th session of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and World Meteorological Organization typhoon committee in November 2005 ; it was replaced with the name Noul . 
 = Hurricane Kate ( 1985 ) = 
 Hurricane Kate was the final in a series of tropical cyclones to impact the United States during 1985 and the latest in any calendar year to strike the country at hurricane intensity on record . The eleventh named storm , seventh hurricane , and third major hurricane of the annual hurricane season , Kate originated from the interaction of an upper @-@ level trough and tropical wave northeast of Puerto Rico on November 15 . Though the system tracked erratically during the first hours of its existence , the intensification of a region of high pressure to the cyclone 's north caused Kate to turn westward . A favorable atmospheric pattern allowed the newly developed system to intensify to hurricane intensity on November 16 , and further to Category 2 intensity three days later . Kate made its first landfall on the northern coast of Cuba at this intensity prior to emerging as a slightly weaker storm during the evening hours of November 19 . Once clear of land , it began to strengthen quickly , becoming a Category 3 and reaching its peak intensity of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) the following day . On November 21 , a cold front moving across the Mississippi Valley resulted in a north and eventual northeast turn of the cyclone , and Kate came ashore near Mexico Beach , Florida , as a minimal Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) . Gradual weakening ensued as the cyclone moved along the Southeast United States coastline , and Kate transitioned to an extratropical cyclone on November 23 , a day after exiting the coastline of North Carolina . 
 The threat of Hurricane Kate in Cuba prompted the evacuation of 360 @,@ 000 people . Heavy rainfall in Cuba caused numerous mudslides and flooding , killing 10 people and leading to severe agriculture damage . Wind gusts over hurricane intensity resulted in widespread power outages , significant building damage , and major crop damage . Damage totaled roughly $ 400 million , making it the most damaging hurricane to strike the island in many decades . In preparation of the system , many hurricane watches and warnings were put into effect . Hundreds of thousands of residents were evacuated , and the governor of Florida declared a state of emergency for six counties in Florida ; this was later relinquished following the relatively minor impacts of Kate . In addition , many shelters were opened . When Kate struck the Florida Panhandle , it became the first hurricane to make landfall in that location since Hurricane Eloise in 1975 . Storm surge and flooding rains destroyed much of the oyster industry , causing many people to lose their jobs in the weeks after the storm . Gusts over 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) contributed to downed trees and building damage , while a combination of the wind and rain led to downed power poles . Across the remainder of the Southeast United States , several inches of rainfall led to flash flooding , damage to roadways , and major tree damage . Overall , Kate resulted in 15 fatalities and $ 700 million in damage . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Before the formation of Hurricane Kate , a ridge was located across the southeastern United States for much of the autumn of 1985 ; concurrently , a major trough persisted across the western portion of the country . As a result , weather conditions across the Gulf of Mexico and western Atlantic Ocean in November were more typical of the pattern in late September , including sea surface temperatures of 81 ° F ( 27 ° C ) . On November 13 , a weak tropical wave began interacting with a trough to the northeast of the Lesser Antilles . It gradually organized due to the favorable conditions , and on November 15 , a Hurricane Hunters flight into the area indicated the development of a tropical cyclone . As gale force winds were already present , the system was immediately declared Tropical Storm Kate , about 240 miles ( 385 km ) northeast of San Juan , Puerto Rico . 
 With a ridge to its north , Kate tracked westward after developing , and an upper @-@ level low developed to the southwest of the storm . The combination of the two provided favorable outflow , allowing Kate to quickly intensify . On November 16 , the storm attained hurricane status while moving through the southeastern Bahamas . After continued strengthening , Kate made landfall at 0600 UTC on November 19 over north @-@ central Cuba with a well @-@ defined eye . When it moved ashore , Kate had a pressure of 967 mbar ( 28 @.@ 6 inHg ) and winds of about 110 mph ( 180 km / h ) . The hurricane maintained its well @-@ defined eye while moving across northern Cuba , and about 12 hours after making landfall , it emerged into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico just east of Havana . Over the next 24 hours , Kate re @-@ intensified off the southwest coast of Florida as it passed about 85 mi ( 135 km ) southwest of Key West . On November 20 , the Hurricane Hunters observed winds as strong as 125 mph ( 200 km / h ) , and a buoy recorded a gust of 136 mph ( 219 km / h ) ; this was the highest recorded wind gust from a buoy in the Gulf of Mexico until Hurricane Lili in 2002 . Based on these observations , it was estimated that Kate attained peak winds of about 120 mph ( 190 km / h ) around 1200 UTC on November 20 . 
 Hurricane Kate maintained peak intensity for about 18 hours . On November 21 , a cold front moving through the Mississippi Valley deflected the hurricane to the north and northeast . The combination of cooler waters and wind shear from the front weakened Kate to an intensity of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) by the time the hurricane struck Crooked Island near Mexico Beach , Florida late on November 21 . After landfall , Kate continued to the northeast , crossing into Georgia and weakened into a tropical storm . Kate emerged from North Carolina into the Atlantic Ocean late on November 22 . Encountering even colder waters and continued shear , the storm weakened further while turning to the east @-@ southeast . On November 23 , Kate transitioned into an extratropical cyclone to the west of Bermuda , terminating at 1800 UTC that day . 
 Until 2011 , Kate 's was considered the second @-@ latest hurricane landfall in the United States , behind only a cyclone in 1925 that struck on December 1 ; however , a systematic reanalysis indicated the 1925 system was only a tropical storm . In turn , Kate took the record . With Kate 's landfall , the 1985 season had six hurricanes that struck the United States , only one short of the record seven in 1886 .

 By November 18 , a hurricane warning was in effect for the southeast and central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands . Flood warnings were issued for northern Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic . In preparation for the hurricane 's arrival , officials forced 360 @,@ 000 people to evacuate in north @-@ central Cuba . 
 While Kate was moving through the Bahamas , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) issued a hurricane warning from Jupiter to Fort Myers , Florida , including the Florida Keys . Then @-@ Governor of Florida Bob Graham declared a state of emergency for six counties in South Florida . However , it was reversed following the relatively minor effects in South Florida . Officials recommended evacuation of the Florida Keys , leading to heavy traffic on the Overseas Highway and prompting the Red Cross to open 12 shelters . Three shelters were opened in Key West , but only 500 sought individuals utilized them during the storm . Most residents chose to endure the storm in their homes . In Fort Lauderdale , schools were closed and residents of mobile homes were required to leave . 
 Shortly after the storm reached its peak intensity on November 20 , the NHC issued a hurricane watch from Grand Isle , Louisiana , to Cedar Key , Florida . Later that day , a portion of the watch area was upgraded to a warning from Bay St. Louis , Mississippi to St. Marks , Florida . About 20 @,@ 000 employees on oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico were evacuated , many by helicopter . The USS Lexington left port from Naval Air Station Pensacola to ride out the storm in open waters , and aircraft in the region were flown inland . About 100 @,@ 000 people along the Florida Panhandle were told to leave their houses after Governor Bob Graham issued evacuation orders in 13 counties . About 2 @,@ 000 people stayed in 34 shelters in Panama City . Roads in the region suffered traffic jams from the large volume of evacuees . Portions of the Florida Gulf Coast were threatened by Hurricane Elena earlier in the season , and some evacuees of that storm intended not to leave during Kate due to the poor shelter conditions they had experienced . Governor Graham activated 300 members of the Florida National Guard to prevent looting and to assist in evacuations . One person died from a stress @-@ induced heart attack in Chipley after evacuating . Outside of Florida , about 2 @,@ 200 people fled Grand Isle , Louisiana . 
 After Kate moved ashore , the NHC issued gale warnings along the East Coast of the United States from St. Augustine , Florida to Chincoteague , Virginia .

 Early in its duration , Hurricane Kate sank one boat near Puerto Rico and disabled three others . The crew of five on the sunken boat were rescued after 17 hours . Several homes in northern Puerto Rico were damaged , forcing hundreds to evacuate . Flooding was also reported in Dominican Republic , including around the capital Santo Domingo . 
 Heavy rainfall and winds up to 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) were reported in the Turks and Caicos Islands . In Jamaica , heavy precipitation caused mudslides , which in turn blocked 23 major and minor roads and destroyed many bridges , culverts , and drains . Flooding in general caused severe damage to agriculture , especially in Clarendon , Manchester , Saint Ann , Saint Elizabeth , and Trelawny Parishes . Seven fatalities were reported , while the cost to repair damage was approximately $ 3 million ( 1985 USD ) . 
 As Kate moved across northern Cuba , it produced strong winds that peaked at 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) in Sagua La Grande . Wind gusts peaked at 104 mph ( 167 km / h ) in Varadero , and winds in the capital of Havana reached 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) . In Havana , high winds caused power outages and destroyed buildings . Waves of 9 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) affected the city 's waterfront . Outside of Havana , the hurricane damaged sugar mills and much of the sugar cane crop ; throughout the island , the winds destroyed 3 @,@ 653 <unk> ( 9461 km2 ) of sugar cane and 34 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 37 @,@ 000 tons ) of sugar . The storm also destroyed 141 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 139 @,@ 000 long tons ; 155 @,@ 000 short tons ) of bananas and 87 @,@ 078 tonnes ( 85 @,@ 703 long tons ; 95 @,@ 987 short tons ) of other fruits and vegetables . Across the island , Kate damaged 88 @,@ 207 houses and destroyed 4 @,@ 382 others , affecting 476 @,@ 891 people . Many public buildings , including schools , were damaged . Throughout the country , Kate killed 10 people and injured about 50 people . Damage was estimated at $ 400 million , which was the highest total from all landfalling hurricanes from 1903 to 1998 , unadjusted for inflation .

 As Kate passed to the southwest of Key West , the storm produced winds of 47 mph ( 76 km / h ) there , with unofficial wind gusts of 104 mph ( 167 km / h ) . Rainfall totals in southwest Florida were generally around 1 in ( 25 mm ) , although Key West reported 2 @.@ 08 in ( 53 mm ) of precipitation . High winds downed trees and power lines , leaving areas between Key West and Big Pine Key without power . Electrical outages contributed to a mobile home being destroyed by fire , and one person died through electrocution . Above @-@ normal tides caused minor flooding and erosion along the Florida Keys . Two people died after their boat capsized in the lower Keys . 
 Kate was the first hurricane to make landfall in the Florida Panhandle since Hurricane Eloise in 1975 . In the region , the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall along its path , peaking at 8 @.@ 32 in ( 211 mm ) in Panama City . While Kate moved ashore , it produced an 11 feet ( 3 @.@ 4 m ) storm surge at Cape San Blas , causing beach and dune erosion in Gulf County . Storm surge flooding left 150 houses uninhabitable in Wakulla County . The hurricane damaged a bridge to St. George Island that had been rebuilt after Hurricane Elena , and large portions of U.S. Routes 90 and 98 were washed out or damaged . Just two months after Elena ravaged the Apalachicola Bay shellfish harvesting industry , Hurricane Kate destroyed remaining oyster beds , leaving many oystermen in the area without jobs . 
 Strong winds buffeted the Florida Panhandle , accompanied by one tornado and several funnel clouds . In Panama City , wind gusts reached 78 mph ( 126 km / h ) , damaging two houses , a motel , and a fishing pier . The winds were strong enough to remove the roof of a two @-@ story federal building . Sustained winds blew 74 mph ( 119 km / h ) at Cape San Blas , with gusts up to 108 mph ( 174 km / h ) . Across the area , Kate severely damaged 242 buildings , mostly in Franklin County , where the storm ranked as the most devastating of the late 1900s . The storm compromised about 5 @.@ 4 mi ( 8 @.@ 7 km ) of roads in the county , and throughout the region many roads were washed out . The intense winds brought down numerous trees , some of them onto adjacent structures . One fallen tree struck a car , killing one person and injuring another . The winds also downed power poles and lines . About 90 percent of Florida 's capital city Tallahassee , or about 80 @,@ 000 people , lost power , and along the coast from Panama City to Apalachicola , the storm left about 30 @,@ 000 homes and businesses without electricity . Overall , the hurricane destroyed 325 homes along the panhandle , and about 500 buildings were severely damaged .

 Light rainfall of around 1 in ( 25 mm ) from the hurricane extended into southeastern Alabama . Rainfall was much heavier in Georgia , peaking at 7 @.@ 73 in ( 196 mm ) in Bainbridge . Portions of southwestern Georgia experienced heavy damage from flash flooding and winds , and several secondary roads were washed out . Gusts of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) downed thousands of trees , and one fallen tree killed a man west of Thomasville . The cotton , soybean , and pecan crops suffered heavy losses , estimated at around $ 50 million . Property and utility damage was also assessed at $ 50 million , and damage from flash flooding was estimated at $ 1 million . There were scattered power outages in southern Georgia , affecting fewer than 3 @,@ 000 customers by Georgia Power Company 's estimation . While Kate was moving across southeastern Georgia , it produced a 62 mph ( 100 km / h ) wind gust in Savannah . The city also reported 1 @.@ 73 in ( 44 mm ) of rainfall . 
 Further northeast , Charleston , South Carolina reported a wind gust of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) . The highest rainfall total in the state was 6 @.@ 56 in ( 167 mm ) in Hampton . The rains caused flash flooding that washed out secondary roads and a bridge . The storm knocked tree limbs onto power lines , which left about 48 @,@ 000 people without power . In Beaufort , trees fell onto four cars and a mobile home , and high waves sunk a boat . In Wilmington , North Carolina , the storm dropped 1 @.@ 99 in ( 51 mm ) of precipitation . Rains across the state caused generally minor flooding , although several cars were swept off roadways . Rising floodwaters prompted the evacuation of a nursing home in <unk> . Rainfall extended northward into Virginia . Damage throughout the United States was estimated at $ 300 million . 
 As an extratropical cyclone , Kate moved north of Bermuda and produced wind gusts of 26 mph ( 42 km / h ) on the island .

 In the month after Hurricane Kate struck the island , the government of Cuba issued a request to the United Nations ( UN ) World Food Council for international assistance . In response , various UN member nations collectively provided $ 60 @,@ 000 for pesticides ; $ 250 @,@ 000 for herbicides , fungicides , and potato seeds ; and $ 1 @.@ 381 million in cooking oils and beans to fulfill the dietary needs of over 475 @,@ 000 people for 60 days . The Soviet Union also donated about $ 15 million worth of rice and wheat flour . 
 Hurricane Kate delayed a runoff mayoral election in Key West by two weeks . Shortly after the storm , the police departments of both Leon and Jackson Counties ordered a nightly curfew . Two disaster relief centers were opened in Franklin County , one in Apalachicola and the other in Eastpoint . On December 3 , 1985 , then @-@ President of the United States Ronald Reagan declared seven Florida counties as disaster areas , making them eligible to receive federal aid . 
 Due to the widespread power outages along the Florida Panhandle , electrical companies enlisted extra workers to repair downed lines . Officials had put a curfew in place for Tallahassee due to power outages created by the hurricane , and the curfew was lifted on November 24 after power was gradually restored and roads were cleared of debris . Police officers in the city arrested 20 people for violating curfew or creating unrest . 
 Some sections of coastline already suffering from severe erosion lost additional swaths of beach to a 10 @-@ foot ( 3 m ) storm surge and strong waves . Many fishermen before and after the storm encountered diminished fish catches after the hurricane . 
 = Music of the SaGa series = 
 SaGa is a series of science fiction role @-@ playing video games produced by Square , now Square Enix . The series originated on the Game Boy in 1989 as the creation of Akitoshi Kawazu . It has since continued across multiple platforms , from the Super Nintendo Entertainment System to the PlayStation 2 , and like the Final Fantasy series , the story in each SaGa game is independent of its counterparts . The music of the SaGa series consists of musical scores and arranged albums from various composers . Some of these composers have created soundtracks and pieces for other Square Enix franchises including the Final Fantasy series and Mana series . The SaGa series is divided up between the original series , released as the Final Fantasy Legend series in North America , the Romancing SaGa series , the SaGa Frontier series , and Unlimited SaGa . 
 The music of the original series was composed by Nobuo Uematsu , Kenji Ito , Ryuji Sasai , and Chihiro Fujioka . Ito went on to be the composer for the Romancing SaGa series , with each arranged album from the series arranged by a different artist off of Ito 's work . Ito composed the soundtrack for the first game of the SaGa Frontier series , but was replaced by Masashi Hamauzu for the second game of the series and Unlimited SaGa . Music from the original soundtracks of the SaGa games has been arranged as sheet music for the piano and published by DOREMI Music Publishing , while tracks from Romancing SaGa Minstrel Song were played at the Press Start -Symphony of Games- 2006 concert and Extra : Hyper Game Music Event 2007 concert in Tokyo and a piece from SaGa Frontier 2 was played at the fifth Symphonic Game Music Concert , held in Leipzig , Germany on August 22 , 2007 .

The three games were published in North America as The Final Fantasy Legend , Final Fantasy Legend II , and Final Fantasy Legend III . The original releases spawned only one album to date , a combined soundtrack album for all three games . Another album was released in Japan on September 9 , 2009 , SaGa 2 Hihou Densetsu Goddess of Destiny Original Soundtrack , which is the soundtrack album for the Nintendo DS remake of SaGa 2 , SaGa 2 Hihou Densetsu Goddess of Destiny . The soundtrack for the DS remake of SaGa 3 , SaGa 3 Jikuu no Hasha Shadow or Light Original Soundtrack , was released on January 12 , 2011 . 
 The music of SaGa 1 was composed by Nobuo Uematsu , and that of SaGa 2 by Uematsu and Kenji Ito , while the music of SaGa 3 was composed by Ryuji Sasai and Chihiro Fujioka . Uematsu has stated that while SaGa 1 's music could be made of better quality , the emphasis was on enjoying the game , and not solely its appearance or sound . The Game Boy 's sound hardware was different from that of the Famicom , which Uematsu was used to composing for at the time , with new stereo and waveforms and only three notes ; as a result , Uematsu struggled with deciding how to work with these , developing new themes for the music in the process despite SaGa 1 's director Akitoshi Kawazu 's desire to have the music be in the same vein as Square 's preceding Final Fantasy titles . Uematsu has stated that the Game Boy was a system he would like to compose for again . SaGa 2 was the first soundtrack or album that Kenji Ito worked on .

The album has a total length of 1 : 28 : 18 and 55 tracks . 
 The soundtrack was well received by reviewers such as Patrick Gann of RPGFan , who held that it contained some of the " best composition [ s ] " in any video game soundtrack . He credited the excellence of the soundtrack to the limited audio resources the composers had to work with on the Game Boy , which in his opinion forced them to be more creative in their compositions . He did note , however , that he felt that the extra arranged medley , while good , was not " anything special " . Kero Hazel from Square Enix Music Online had similar comments on the album , praising the composition of the album and its ability to " push the Game Boy sound hardware to its limit " , and also felt the arranged medley was lacking . Hazel added that in their opinion the sound quality of the recording equipment used was not as high @-@ quality as would be expected .

Hamauzu has stated that his intention for the soundtrack was to " compose outside the field of conventional ' game music ' , " and that to do this he " took a lot of chances in every possible way " . In the liner notes for the soundtrack album , Hamauzu explained that when he began the project he felt pressured to compose music in the same vein as the previous soundtracks in the series , but in the final months before finishing he decided to abandon any preconceived notions of what the music should sound like and instead to " express [ his ] own unique character " .

 Unlimited Saga is the newest SaGa game , first published on the PlayStation 2 in 2002 and was composed for by Masashi Hamauzu ; it has not yet received any sequels . Unlimited Saga has sparked two albums , a soundtrack album and a promotional single . In the liner notes for the soundtrack album , Hamauzu estimated that he had completed the tunes for the soundtrack at a rate of one per day . He also noted that the game was Square Enix 's first " all streaming audio RPG " , which meant that the composer and synthesizer operator could use live recordings of each instrument in the final composition rather than using approximations created in a synthesizer . Despite this , some tracks , including " Judy 's Theme " , use only synthesized sounds as the synthesizer demo created prior to recording a live version sounded so real as to not need to be re @-@ recorded . Hamauzu said that the tracks that used live instruments almost exclusively were the ones that were " Latin " in style , such as " Anxiety towards a Wonder " and " Battle Theme IV " . Hamauzu also stated that for the soundtrack he reused several older pieces , with the oldest being " Mysterious Plan " which had been composed 10 years prior , though he said that amount of work that needed to be done to update the pieces required more effort than if he had composed a new piece instead . 
 = = = Unlimited Saga Original Soundtrack = = = 
 Unlimited Saga Original Soundtrack is an arranged album of music from Unlimited Saga . The tracks were composed by Masashi Hamauzu , with some tracks arranged for orchestral performance by Shiro Hamaguchi . Hamauzu described the major differences between this soundtrack and his previous works as being the result of changes in technology , which allowed him to include a wider variety of musical genres as well as " ample " acoustic instruments . He has said that his favorite tune from the soundtrack is " Soaring Wings " , the theme song for the game , particularly given the short amount of time he had to compose the soundtrack . When Hamauzu thought to use a song in the soundtrack , he decided to cast Mio Kashiwabara as the singer , despite having only met her once at the Tokyo University of Art festival two years before and never working with her . Despite her having never sung a non @-@ classical work before , he was very satisfied with how the song came out . The album 's 58 tracks cover a duration of 2 : 07 : 03 across two discs . The final four tracks of the album are arrangements of other pieces on the soundtrack . It was published by DigiCube on January 22 , 2003 with the catalog numbers SSCX @-@ <unk> ~ 9 . 
 The album reached # 115 on the Japan Oricon charts . It was well received by critics such as Jeff <unk> of RPGFan , who applauded its variety , saying that each track had a " distinct feel " even as the album as a whole felt " cohesive " . He also noted that each disc had its own feel , with the first disc containing more mellow and emotional pieces , while the second held " harder " rock , techno and jazz pieces , a dichotomy that he felt strengthened the album as a whole . James McCawley of RPGFan agreed ; while he preferred the sound of the second disc , he felt that together they created a stronger album which reflected " the split sides of Hamauzu 's musical character " . Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online also enjoyed the album , calling it " an accomplished piece of experimentation that is also often satisfying on an emotional and melodic level " , though he added a caveat that if the listener did not enjoy electronic music , they would find the album " often wonderful but also hugely inconsistent " .

 = World Chess Championship 1972 = 
 The World Chess Championship 1972 was a match for the World Chess Championship between challenger Bobby Fischer of the United States and defending champion Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union . The match took place in the <unk> arena in Reykjavík , Iceland and has been dubbed the Match of the Century . Fischer became the first American born in the United States to win the world title , and the second American overall ( Wilhelm Steinitz , the first world champion , became a naturalized American citizen in 1888 ) . Fischer 's win also ended , for a short time , 24 years of Soviet domination of the World Championship . 
 The first game was played on July 11 , 1972 . The last game began on August 31 , was adjourned after 40 moves , and Spassky resigned the next day without resuming play . Fischer won the match 12 ½ – 8 ½ , becoming the eleventh undisputed World Champion . 
 In 2016 , former World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov commented on the global significance of the match , saying : 
 I think the reason you look at these matches probably was not so much the chess factor but to the political element , which was inevitable because in the Soviet Union , chess was treated by the Soviet authorities as a very important and useful ideological tool to demonstrate the intellectual superiority of the Soviet communist regime over the decadent West . That ’ s why the Spassky defeat [ ... ] was treated by people on both sides of the Atlantic as a crushing moment in the midst of the Cold War . 
 = = Background = = 
 The match was played during the Cold War , but during a period of increasing détente . The Soviet Chess School had long held a monopoly on the game at the highest level . Spassky was the latest in an uninterrupted chain of Soviet world chess champions , stretching back to the 1948 championship . 
 Fischer , an eccentric 29 @-@ year @-@ old American , was a vocal critic of the Soviet domination of chess , because he believed that Soviet players gained an unfair advantage by agreeing to short draws among themselves in tournaments . In August 1962 Sports Illustrated , and then in October the German magazine Der Spiegel , published a famous article by Fischer " The Russians Have Fixed World Chess " in which he expounded this view . Fischer himself rarely agreed to early draws in unclear positions . 
 The expectations on Spassky were enormous because for the Soviets , chess was part of the political system . While Fischer was often famously critical of his home country ( " Americans want to plunk in front of a TV and don 't want to open a book ... " ) , he too carried the burden of expectation because of the political significance of the match . No American had achieved the world championship since the first champion , Wilhelm Steinitz , became a naturalized American citizen in 1888 . The excitement surrounding the match was such that it was called the " Match of the Century " , even though the same term had been applied to the USSR vs. Rest of the World match just two years before . 
 Spassky , the champion , had lost the world championship match against Tigran Petrosian in 1966 . In 1968 , he won matches against Efim Geller , Bent Larsen , and Viktor Korchnoi to again win the right to challenge Petrosian for the title . This time Spassky triumphed , winning 12 ½ – 10 ½ . He is often said to have ( had ) a " universal style " , " involving an ability to play the most varied types of positions " . However , Garry Kasparov notes that " from childhood he clearly had a leaning toward sharp , attacking play , and possessed a splendid feel for the initiative . " Before the match , Fischer had played five games against Spassky , with two draws and Spassky winning three . 
 However , in the Candidates matches en route to becoming the challenger , Fischer had demolished world @-@ class grandmasters Mark Taimanov and Bent Larsen , each by a perfect score of 6 – 0 , a feat no one else had ever accomplished in any Candidates match . After that , Fischer had split the first five games of his match against former World Champion Tigran Petrosian , then closed out the match by winning the last four games . " No bare statement conveys the magnitude and impact of these results . ... Fischer sowed devastation . " From the last seven rounds of the Interzonal until the first game against Petrosian , Fischer won 20 consecutive games , nearly all of which were against top grandmasters . 
 Fischer also had a much higher Elo rating than Spassky . On the July 1972 FIDE rating list , Fischer 's 2785 was a record 125 points ahead of the number two player – Spassky , whose rating was 2660 . Fischer 's recent results and record Elo rating made him the pre @-@ match favorite . Other observers , however , noted that Fischer had never won a game against Spassky . 
 Spassky 's seconds for the match were Efim Geller , Nikolai <unk> and <unk> Nei . Fischer 's second was William Lombardy . His entourage also included lawyer Paul Marshall , who would play a significant role in the events surrounding the match , and USCF representative Fred Cramer . The match referee was Lothar Schmid . 
 For some time , it was doubtful that the match would be played at all . Shortly before the match , Fischer demanded that the players receive , in addition to the agreed @-@ upon prize fund of $ 125 @,@ 000 ( 5 / 8 to the winner , 3 / 8 to the loser ) and 30 % of the proceeds from television and film rights , 30 % of the box @-@ office receipts . He failed to arrive in Iceland for the opening ceremony on July 1 . Fischer 's behavior was seemingly full of contradictions , as it had been throughout his career . He finally flew to Iceland and agreed to play after a two @-@ day postponement of the match by FIDE President Max Euwe , a surprise doubling of the prize fund by British investment banker Jim Slater , and much persuasion , including a phone call by Henry Kissinger to Fischer . Many commentators , particularly from the USSR , have suggested that all this ( and his continuing demands and unreasonableness ) was part of Fischer 's plan to " psych out " Spassky . Fischer 's supporters say that winning the World Championship was the mission of his life , that he simply wanted the setting to be perfect for it when he took the stage , and that his behavior was the same as it had always been . 
 World @-@ class match play ( i.e. , a series of games between the same two opponents ) often involves one or both players preparing one or two openings very deeply , and playing them repeatedly during the match . Preparation for such a match also involves analysis of those opening lines known to be played by the opponent . Fischer had been famous for his unusually narrow opening repertoire : for example , almost invariably playing 1.e4 as White , and almost always playing the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defence as Black against <unk> He surprised Spassky by repeatedly switching openings , and by playing openings that he had never , or only rarely , played before ( such as 1.c4 as White , and Alekhine 's Defence , the Pirc Defence , and the Paulsen Sicilian as Black ) . Even in openings that Fischer had played before in the match , he continually deviated from the variations he had previously played , almost never repeating the same line twice in the match .

 The Interzonal tournament was held in Palma de Mallorca , Spain , in November and December 1970 . The top six players of the <unk> ( shown in bold in the table below ) qualified for the Candidates Tournament . Bobby Fischer was originally unqualified to play in this event , as he had not participated in the 1969 US Championship ( Zonal ) . However , Benko ( and the reserve Lombardy ) gave up his spot , and FIDE President Max Euwe controversially allowed Fischer to participate instead . A compensation of US $ 1 @,@ 500 was paid to Benko for this to occur . 
 Portisch and Smyslov contested a six @-@ game playoff in Portorož , Yugoslavia in early 1971 for the reserve position for the Candidates Tournament . The match ended 3 – 3 ; Portisch was declared the winner because of a better tie @-@ break score in the main tournament .

 The match was played as the best of 24 games , with wins counting 1 point and draws counting ½ point , and would end when one of the players scored 12 ½ points . If the match ended in a 12 – 12 tie , the defending champion ( Spassky ) would retain the title . The first time control was 40 moves in 2 ½ hours . Three games per week were scheduled . Each player was entitled to three postponements for medical reasons during the match . Games were scheduled to start on Sunday , Tuesday , and Thursday . If a game was adjourned , it was to be continued the next day . Saturday was a rest day . 
 Fischer insisted that a Staunton chess set from Jaques of London be used . The chessboard had to be remade at Fischer 's request . The match was covered throughout the world . Fischer became a worldwide celebrity , described as the Einstein or Hitler of chess . His hotel received dozens of calls each day from women attracted to him , and Fischer enjoyed reading the numerous letters and telegrams that arrived with compliments or criticisms . Excitement grew as the match was postponed and people questioned whether Fischer would appear . Previously , he had come to the airport and , surrounded by reporters , left . The combination of " Will he play ? " and " American versus Russian " created excitement throughout the world .

Gligorić , Kasparov and other commentators have suggested that Fischer may have miscalculated , having planned 30 ... h5 <unk> h4 <unk> h3 <unk> <unk> , but overlooking that <unk> Bxf2 <unk> keeps the bishop trapped . Anatoly Karpov suggested that Spassky was afraid of Fischer and wanted to show that he could draw with the white pieces , while Fischer wanted to disprove that as the game headed for a stale draw . Owing to unusual features in the position , Fischer had good drawing chances despite having only two pawns for the bishop . However , the position became hopeless after he made at least one more bad move before the adjournment , which took place after move 40 . Fischer could still have drawn the game with the correct 39th or 40th move . He resigned on move 56 .

 Following his loss Fischer made further demands on the organizers , including that all cameras be removed . When they were not , he refused to appear for game 2 , giving a default win to Spassky . His appeal was rejected . Karpov speculates that this forfeited game was actually a masterstroke on Fischer 's part , a move designed specifically to upset Spassky 's equanimity . 
 With the score now 2 – 0 in favor of Spassky , many observers believed that the match was over and Fischer would leave Iceland , and , indeed , Fischer looked to board the next plane out of Iceland , only to be dissuaded by his second , William Lombardy . His decision to stay in the match was attributed by some to another phone call from Kissinger and a deluge of <unk> to Fischer . Spassky , owing to his sporting spirit and respect and sympathy for Fischer , agreed to play the third game in a small room backstage , out of sight of the spectators . According to Pal Benko and Burt Hochberg , this concession was a psychological mistake by Spassky .

 This game proved to be the turning point of the match . After <unk> ( diagram ) , Fischer demonstrated his acute intuitive feel for the position with 11 ...

 Thus Fischer had drawn level ( the score was now 2 ½ – 2 ½ ) , although FIDE rules stipulated that the champion retained the title if after 24 games the match ended in a tie .

 Before the match began , the Soviet team that had been training Spassky debated about whether Fischer might play an opening move different from his usual <unk> " But when the question was raised as to whether 1 d4 or 1 c4 could be expected of Fischer , Spassky replied : ' Let 's not bother with such nonsense – I 'll play the [ Tartakower ] Defence . What can he achieve ? ... ' " 
 Fischer played 1.c4 ( instead of 1.e4 ) for only the third time in a serious game . With 3.d4 the game transposed to the Queen 's Gambit , surprising many who had never seen Fischer play the White side of that opening . In fact , he had previously openly condemned it . 
 Spassky played Tartakower 's Defense ( 7 ... b6 ) , his favorite choice in many tournaments and a line with which he had never lost . After <unk> ! ? ( introduced in Furman – Geller , Moscow 1970 ) , Spassky responded with 14 ... a6 ? ! .

 After this game , Spassky joined the audience in applauding Fischer 's win . This astounded Fischer , who called his opponent " a true sportsman " . 
 " Lombardy was ecstatic : ' " Bobby has played a steady , fluent game , and just watched Spassky make horrendous moves . Spassky has not met a player of Bobby 's genius and caliber before , who fights for every piece on the board ; he doesn 't give in and agree to draws like the Russian grandmasters . This is a shock to Spassky ' " . 
 According to C.H.O 'D . Alexander : 
 This game was notable for two things . First , Fischer played the Queen 's Gambit for the first time in his life in a serious game ; second , he played it to perfection , the game indeed casting doubt on Black 's whole opening system . 
 The win gave Fischer the lead ( 3 ½ – 2 ½ ) for the first time in the match . 
 = = = = Game 7 : Spassky ½ Fischer ½ ( Sicilian Najdorf ) = = = = 
 Spassky played 1.e4 for the first time in the match . Fischer defended aggressively with his favorite Poisoned Pawn Variation of the Najdorf Sicilian , and after 17 ... Nc6 had the upper hand ( Gipslis ) . He consolidated his extra pawn and reached a winning endgame , but then played carelessly , allowing Spassky to salvage a draw . In the final position , Fischer had two extra pawns but had to execute a draw by perpetual check in order to escape being checkmated by Spassky 's two rooks and knight .

 Fischer again played 1.c4 ; the game remained an English Opening rather than transposing to another opening as in game 6 . After 14 ... a6 the game was even . Spassky gave up an exchange with 15 ... b5 ? for little compensation in the way of a positional advantage , and it is unclear whether it was a sacrifice or a blunder . Fischer won , putting him ahead 5 – 3 .

 = = = = Game 10 : Fischer 1 Spassky 0 ( Ruy Lopez Breyer ) = = = = 
 Fischer played the Ruy Lopez , an opening on which he was a great expert . After 25 ... <unk> ? ! ( 25 ... axb5 ! ? <unk> Ba6 gives Spassky a better chance ; Gligorić ) , Fischer obtained the upper hand by initiating a dangerous attack on Spassky 's king with <unk> ! ( Matanović ) , suddenly placing Black in a critical situation . Spassky sacrificed the exchange for a pawn , reaching a sharp endgame where his two connected passed pawns gave almost sufficient compensation for Fischer 's small material advantage . Spassky had drawing chances , but played <unk> , and Fischer won the game with precise play .
