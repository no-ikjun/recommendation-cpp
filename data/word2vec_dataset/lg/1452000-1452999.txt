 The author Sir Walter Scott is famous for the Waverley series of novels , including Rob Roy and Ivanhoe . Scott is known to have visited Arbroath three times , and his personal favourite in the series , The Antiquary ( 1816 ) features affectionately fictionalised versions of both Arbroath ( " Fairport " ) and Auchmithie ( " <unk> " ) . 
 Arbroath has one museum , the former Bell Rock Lighthouse Signal Tower . In 1807 Arbroath became the base of operations for the building of the Bell Rock Lighthouse . The shore station for the lighthouse – the Bell Rock Signal Tower – was completed in 1813 and acted as a lifeline for the keepers offshore . The Signal Tower Museum was opened in 1974 as a visitor centre detailing the history of the lighthouse and the town of Arbroath . 
 = = = Arbroath smokies = = = 
 Arbroath smokies , for which Arbroath is well @-@ known nationally and internationally , are made solely in Arbroath following the award of Protected Geographical Indication in 2004 , which limits Arbroath <unk> production to within 4 km of Arbroath . Smokies are made from haddock using traditional methods dating back to the late 19th century where the fish are first salted overnight to preserve them , before being left tied in pairs to dry . Next , the dried fish are hung in a special barrel containing a hardwood fire and covered with a lid . After around an hour of smoking , the fish are golden brown and ready to eat . The preparation of smokies remains a cottage industry in Arbroath , centred almost exclusively at the harbour area . However , one larger processor , RR Spink , supplied Arbroath smokies to several UK supermarket chains . It appears that , nowadays , the firm concentrates on smoking other fish such as salmon or trout and no longer supplies the Arbroath Smokie .. They have a royal warrant as a fishmonger to HM Queen Elizabeth II for which the company holds the Royal Warrant .

 Arbroath has one professional football team , Arbroath , who play in the Second Division of the Scottish Football League after promotion from the Third Division in the 2010 / 11 season . Arbroath play their home matches at <unk> Park , which holds the record for being the closest stadium to the sea in European football ( around five metres from the high tide line ) . Arbroath F.C. holds the world record for the largest winning margin in a senior football match , 36 @-@ 0 , in their Scottish Cup match against Bon Accord ( a scratch team from Aberdeen ) on 12 September 1885 . Further goals were disallowed either for offside , or because it was not clear whether the ball had gone into the goal . For this reason the AFC supporters ' club is called the 36 @-@ 0 club in memory of this event . Arbroath F.C. are nicknamed The Red <unk> , owing to the red light that used to guide fishing boats back from the North Sea to the harbour ( <unk> being a Scots word for light ) .

 = SMS Schlesien = 
 SMS Schlesien was one of the five Deutschland @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleships built for the Kaiserliche Marine between 1904 and 1906 . Named after the German province of Schlesien , she was built at the Schichau @-@ Werke shipyard in Danzig , where she was launched on 28 May 1906 . She was commissioned into the navy on 5 May 1908 . The ships of her class were already outdated by the time they entered service , being inferior in size , armor , firepower and speed to the revolutionary new battleship HMS Dreadnought . 
 After commissioning , Schlesien was assigned to the I Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet . She served with the fleet throughout the first two years of World War I ; by this time she had been transferred to the II Battle Squadron alongside her four sister ships . Schlesien was present at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916 , where she was actively engaged only briefly . After Jutland , she was relegated to guard duties before being withdrawn altogether in 1917 , when she became a training ship . The Treaty of Versailles permitted the German navy to retain eight obsolete battleships , which included Schlesien , to defend the German coast . She saw extensive service with the reorganized Reichsmarine ; in the 1920s and 1930s the ship was rebuilt and eventually converted back into a training ship . 
 Schlesien saw limited combat during World War II , including the invasion of Norway in 1940 . After the conclusion of the operation , the ship was again given secondary duties . She ended her career as an anti @-@ aircraft ship in the Baltic ; in April 1945 Schlesien steamed to Swinemünde to restock her ammunition and evacuate wounded soldiers when she struck a mine on 3 May . She sank in shallow water , though much of her superstructure , including her main battery , remained above water . In the remaining days of the war , Schlesien used her heavy artillery to provide support for retreating German ground troops . After the end of the war , she was broken up , though some parts of the ship remained until the 1970s . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Schlesien was intended to fight in the line of battle with the other battleships of the High Seas Fleet . She was laid down on 19 November 1904 at the Schichau dockyard in Danzig . She was launched on 28 May 1906 , and in March 1908 was sent to Kiel , where her fitting out work was completed . She was commissioned for trials on 5 May , though these were interrupted from 6 July to 5 September when the ship was temporarily used as a torpedo trials vessel . Schlesien joined the fleet after the torpedo trials were completed in September . The British battleship HMS Dreadnought — armed with ten 12 inch ( 30 @.@ 5 cm ) guns — had already been commissioned nearly two years prior , in December 1906 . Dreadnought 's revolutionary design rendered obsolete every ship of the German navy , including the newer Schlesien . 
 Schlesien was 127 @.@ 60 m ( 418 @.@ 6 ft ) long , had a beam of 22 @.@ 20 m ( 72 @.@ 8 ft ) , and a draft of 8 @.@ 21 m ( 26 @.@ 9 ft ) . She had a full @-@ load displacement of 14 @,@ 218 metric tons ( 13 @,@ 993 long tons ; 15 @,@ 673 short tons ) . She was equipped with three @-@ shaft triple expansion engines and twelve coal @-@ fired water @-@ tube boilers that produced a rated 18 @,@ 664 indicated horsepower ( 13 @,@ 918 kW ) and a top speed of 18 @.@ 5 knots ( 34 @.@ 3 km / h ; 21 @.@ 3 mph ) . In addition to being the fastest ship of her class , Schlesien was the most fuel efficient . At a cruising speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) , she could steam for 4 @,@ 770 nautical miles ( 8 @,@ 830 km ; 5 @,@ 490 mi ) . She had a standard crew of 35 officers and 708 enlisted men . 
 The ship 's primary armament consisted of four 28 cm SK L / 40 guns in two twin turrets ; one turret was placed forward and the other aft . She was also equipped with fourteen 17 cm ( 6 @.@ 7 in ) guns mounted in casemates and twenty 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) guns in pivot mounts . The ship was fitted with six 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes , all submerged in the hull . One was in the bow , one in the stern , and four on the broadside . Her armored belt was 240 mm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) thick amidships and she had a 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) thick armored deck . The main battery turrets had 280 mm ( 11 in ) thick sides . 
 = = Service history = = 
 After commissioning , Schlesien was assigned to the I Battle Squadron . Her first year of service , 1909 , saw a pattern of fleet maneuvers in the North and Baltic Seas as well as the Atlantic Ocean . Her first cruise into the Atlantic was conducted from 7 July to 1 August . Another round of exercises followed in the autumn . The I Battle Squadron was transferred from Kiel to Wilhelmshaven in April 1910 . The following month , in May 1910 , the fleet conducted training maneuvers in the Kattegat , between Norway and Denmark . For the first time , the annual summer cruise went to Norway . Fleet training followed , and a training cruise into the Baltic took place at the end of the year . 
 On 3 November 1911 , Schlesien was transferred to the II Battle Squadron with the rest of her sister ships . Training maneuvers in 1911 and 1912 followed the same pattern as in 1910 , with the exception of the summer cruise in 1912 ; owing to the Agadir Crisis that year , the cruise only went into the Baltic , rather than to Norway . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 Schlesien remained with the High Seas Fleet throughout the first two years of the war . At the outbreak of war , the ship was deployed to guard the German Bight . She then rejoined the High Seas Fleet as part of the battleship support for the battlecruisers that bombarded Scarborough , Hartlepool , and Whitby on 15 – 16 December 1914 . During the operation , the German battle fleet of some 12 dreadnoughts and 8 pre @-@ dreadnoughts came to within 10 nmi ( 19 km ; 12 mi ) of an isolated squadron of six British battleships . However , skirmishes between the rival destroyer screens convinced Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl that he was confronted with the entire Grand Fleet , and so he broke off the engagement and turned for home . Two <unk> fleet advances followed on 17 – 18 and 21 – 23 April 1915 . Another followed on 17 – 18 May , and another on 23 – 24 October . 
 On 24 – 25 April 1916 , Schlesien and her sisters joined the dreadnoughts of the High Seas Fleet to support the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group on a raid of the English coast . While en route to the target , the battlecruiser Seydlitz was damaged by a mine . The battlecruisers conducted a short bombardment of the ports of Yarmouth and Lowestoft . Visibility was poor , so the operation was soon called off before the British fleet could intervene . 
 = = = = Battle of Jutland = = = = 
 Admiral Scheer immediately planned another foray into the North Sea , but the damage to Seydlitz delayed the operation until the end of May . Schlesien was the second ship in the IV Division of the II Battle Squadron under the command of Rear Admiral Franz Mauve , positioned at the rear of the German line . Schlesien was the second to last ship in the German line , followed only by Schleswig @-@ Holstein . During the " Run to the North , " Admiral Reinhard Scheer , the commander of the fleet , ordered the fleet to pursue the British V Battle Squadron at top speed . The slower Deutschland @-@ class ships could not keep up with the faster dreadnoughts and quickly fell behind . 
 Later on the first day of the battle , the hard @-@ pressed battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group were being pursued by their British opponents . Schlesien and the other so @-@ called " five @-@ minute ships " came to their aid by steaming in between the opposing battlecruiser squadrons . Schlesien and her sisters could barely make out a target in the darkness . Due to the poor visibility their shooting was ineffective . The British battlecruisers scored several hits on the German ships ; in the brief melee a near miss from a large @-@ caliber gun sprayed shell splinters onto Schlesien 's decks , killing one man and wounding another . Admiral Mauve ordered an 8 @-@ point turn to the south , and the British did not follow . 
 Late on the 31st , the fleet organized for the night march back to Germany ; Schlesien and Schleswig @-@ Holstein fell in behind the mauled battlecruisers Von der Tann and Derfflinger at the rear of the line . British destroyers conducted a series of attacks against the fleet , some of which targeted Schlesien . Regardless , the High Seas Fleet punched through the British destroyer forces and reached Horns Reef by 4 : 00 on 1 June . The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later , where the undamaged dreadnoughts of the Nassau and Helgoland classes took up defensive positions .

 Following the German defeat in World War I , the German navy , reorganized as the Reichsmarine , was permitted to retain three of the Deutschland @-@ class battleships : Hannover , Schleswig @-@ Holstein and Schlesien , along with several of the Braunschweig @-@ class battleships . Deutschland , the oldest and least advanced ship of the class , was instead scrapped in 1922 . Schlesien and Schleswig @-@ Holstein were modernized in the 1920s , a process that included replacement of the ships ' 17 cm guns with 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) pieces . Schlesien and Schleswig @-@ Holstein continued in their battleship configuration with the active fleet , while Hannover was intended to be rebuilt as a target ship , although this never occurred . 
 Schleswig @-@ Holstein was the flagship of the fleet until 1932 when she was taken in for another reconstruction that converted her into a training vessel . As a result , Schlesien held the position of fleet flagship afterward . In 1932 , Wilhelm Canaris took command of the ship , a post he held for two years . In May 1935 , the Reichsmarine was again reorganized as the Kriegsmarine . Shortly after , Schlesien took part in extensive fleet maneuvers with the new heavy cruiser Deutschland . Later that year , Schlesien was converted into a training ship . Among the modifications were the installation of additional anti @-@ aircraft guns and replacement of the ship 's boilers . The newer boilers were more efficient , which allowed fewer of them to be used ; the additional space this created was used as crew compartments for the cadets and an instruction room . The crew was also altered ; the standard crew had been 35 officers and 708 enlisted men ; after the conversion , this was reduced to 29 officers and 559 sailors , supplemented by 214 cadets . The following year , Schlesien toured the Americas ; in March 1937 the ship stopped in Halifax , Nova Scotia . Later that year in December , she stopped in Mar del Plata , Argentina . In 1938 , the ship visited Samaná Bay in the Dominican Republic . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 During the invasion of Poland in September 1939 , Schlesien initially remained in her training ship role , though she briefly acted as an icebreaker for U @-@ boats . Later in the month , Schlesien joined her sister Schleswig @-@ Holstein to bombard Polish positions along the Baltic coast ; the bombardments lasted from 25 – 27 September . After the operation , Schlesien had six of her 15 cm guns removed to arm the new surface raider Pinguin . In 1940 , Schlesien took part in Operation Weserübung , the German invasion of Denmark and Norway . Schlesien operated in Danish waters throughout the operation . After the occupations were complete , Schlesien resumed her ice @-@ breaking duties . In March 1941 , Schlesien escorted mine @-@ layers in the Baltic . After returning from this operation , she was to be converted into a barracks ship in Gotenhafen . On 4 April 1942 , Schlesien departed for Gotenhafen in company with the battleship Gneisenau and the icebreaker Castor . 
 In mid 1944 , Schlesien 's and Schleswig @-@ Holstein 's anti @-@ aircraft armaments were considerably strengthened so they could used as air defense ships in the port of Gotenhafen . In April 1945 , Schlesien was moved to Swinemünde to restock her ammunition supply as well as evacuate 1 @,@ 000 wounded soldiers from the front . On 3 May she struck a mine at <unk> outside Swinemünde and beached in shallow water . Much of the ship remained above water , including her main armament ; she was able to provide artillery support for retreating German units . Between 1949 and 1956 , the wreck was demolished and then scrapped in situ by an East German company . However , some remains from the ship were still visible in 1970 .

 The unit was first constituted on 29 October 1965 in the Regular Army as the 16th General Support Group . It was then activated on 10 December 1965 in the Dominican Republic . The group returned to the continental United States and was subsequently inactivated on 19 September 1968 at Fort Benning , Georgia . 
 The group was redesignated on 16 September 1987 as the 16th Support Group and activated in Germany . Through the 1990s , the 16th CSG also participated in operations in Kuwait , Saudi Arabia and Kosovo . It received its distinctive unit insignia on 14 April 1988 . 
 On 1 May 2002 , the group was re @-@ aligned to include the 181st Transportation Battalion located at Turley Barracks in Manheim , Germany , and the <unk> Corps Support Battalion , located on <unk> Kaserne , to increase their combat service support capabilities . In March 2003 , the 16th Corps Support Group and its battalions deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom . The group provided logistical support to include direct support maintenance , transportation and supply support to all units in the operation . 
 The group saw a second deployment to Iraq in October 2005 . During this deployment , soldiers of the group executed over 1 @,@ 500 sustainment convoys which provided over 250 million US gallons ( 950 @,@ 000 m3 ) of fuel , 1 million cases of bottled water and 60 million US gallons ( 230 @,@ 000 m3 ) of purified water to allied forces . On 19 September 2006 , the group rotated out of Iraq and back to Germany , replaced by the 82nd Sustainment Brigade . 
 = = = Activation = = = 
 In January 2007 , the lineage and honors were designated to be transferred to the 16th Sustainment Brigade . On 16 July 2007 the group was reorganized as part of an effort to reform support groups into larger , more versatile sustainment brigades . It became the 16th Sustainment Brigade and was subsequently activated at Warner Barracks in Bamberg , Germany . The 16th Corps Support Group and the 7th Corps Support Group had been deactivated and combined to form the new formation . Their subordinate units had been moved and redesignated as well . This move made the 16th Sustainment Brigade the only brigade @-@ sized logistics unit supporting United States Army Europe . It was put under the command of the 21st Theater Sustainment Command . The move was part of an overall streamlining of the Command 's logistics element , as all major logistics formations were redesigned to be modular and more efficient . The sustainment brigade not only retained all previous logistics functions and responsibilities , but also assumed additional services , like finance , medical and signal capabilities . The brigade was composed of the 16th Special Troops Battalion headquartered at Bamberg , the 391st Combat Sustainment Support Battalion at Bamberg , and the 18th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion in Grafenwoehr . It also received its shoulder sleeve insignia . 
 On 29 November 2007 , it was announced that the 16th Sustainment Brigade would be deployed to Iraq in summer of 2008 . It would be part of a force of 8 @,@ 000 soldiers from US Army Europe to deploy . The brigade was just one of over 20 major units from Europe to deploy to the Middle East in 2008 ; most of these units came from the 21st Theater Sustainment Command and V Corps . Throughout the Spring of 2008 , the unit prepared for the deployment by conducting training exercises in Germany . 
 In July 2008 , the brigade deployed to Iraq for its first tour in Operation Iraqi Freedom as a sustainment brigade . Its mission in the country was to provide sustainment and force protection operations in support of Multi @-@ National Division North with life support and logistical operations . On 22 July 2008 , the brigade 's soldiers underwent final preparations before departing Rammstein Air Base for northern Iraq . The brigade operated out of Contingency Operating Base Q @-@ West , which was supported by a dozen Iraqi small businesses . 
 In October 2008 , the brigade 's leaders attended a conference at Joint Base Balad . Hosted by the 3rd Sustainment Command ( Expeditionary ) , the conference was attended by the 1st , 7th , 16th , 55th , and 371st Sustainment Brigades , as well as the 76th Infantry Brigade Combat Team . They discussed streamlining and coordinating sustainment throughout the region . Among the brigade 's operations was a water project in the <unk> province . The brigade operated with US Air Force and Iraqi Army engineers to repair infrastructure that brought water from the Tigris River to the entire province , including the base . The brigade has also undertaken several other support duties for units operating throughout northern Iraq . 
 The brigade participated in joint exercises with the 18th Military Police Brigade and other elements of the 21st Theater Support Command in Spring of 2009 . The exercises involved extensive battle simulations and role play missions to test the overall effectiveness of the units . 
 In October 2010 , the brigade served as the command and control element for Saber Strike 11 , a cooperative training effort aimed at improving interoperability and preparing Latvian , Estonian , Lithuanian and U.S. troops for upcoming deployments in support of the International Security Assistance Forces in Afghanistan .

 The Madras Presidency ( Tamil : <unk> ் <unk> ் <unk> ் ) ( Telugu : <unk> ్ <unk> ్ <unk> ్ <unk> ్ <unk> ) , officially ) ( Malayalam : <unk> ് <unk> ് <unk> ് <unk> ് <unk> ) ( Kannada : <unk> ್ <unk> ್ <unk> ್ <unk> ್ <unk> ) , or the Presidency of Fort St. George and also known as Madras Province , was an administrative subdivision ( presidency ) of British India . At its greatest extent , the presidency included most of southern India , including the whole of the Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh and parts of Odisha , Kerala , Karnataka , Telangana , and the union territory of Lakshadweep . The city of Madras was the winter capital of the Presidency and Ootacamund or Ooty , the summer capital . The island of Ceylon was a part of Madras Presidency from 1793 to 1798 when it was created a Crown colony . 
 In 1639 , the English East India Company purchased the village of Madraspatnam and one year later it established the Agency of Fort St George , precursor of the Madras Presidency , although there had been Company factories at Machilipatnam and <unk> since the very early 1600s . The agency was upgraded to a Presidency in 1652 before once more reverting to its previous status in 1655 . In 1684 , it was re @-@ elevated to a Presidency and Elihu Yale was appointed as president . In 1785 , under the provisions of Pitt 's India Act , Madras became one of three provinces established by the East India Company . Thereafter , the head of the area was styled " Governor " rather than " President " and became subordinate to the Governor @-@ General in Calcutta , a title that would persist until 1947 . Judicial , legislative and executive powers rested with the Governor who was assisted by a Council whose constitution was modified by reforms enacted in 1861 , 1909 , 1919 and 1935 . Regular elections were conducted in Madras up to the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 . By 1908 , the province comprised twenty @-@ two districts , each under a District Collector , and it was further sub @-@ divided into taluks and <unk> with villages making up the smallest unit of administration . 
 Following the Montague @-@ Chelmsford reforms of 1919 , Madras was the first province of British India to implement a system of dyarchy , and thereafter its Governor ruled alongside a prime minister . In the early decades of the 20th century , many significant contributors to the Indian independence movement came from Madras . With the advent of Indian independence on 15 August 1947 , the Presidency became the Madras Province . Madras was later admitted as Madras State , a state of the Indian Union at the inauguration of the Republic of India on 26 January 1950 , and was reorganised in 1956 .

 The discovery of dolmens from this portion of the subcontinent shows inhabitation as early as the Stone Age . The first prominent rulers of the northern part of the future Presidency were The Telugu Satavahana dynasty ( 230 BC - AD 102 ) . Following the decline of the Satavahanas of Andhra and the Cholas in Tamil Nadu , the country was conquered by a little known race of people called the <unk> . The country recovered under the subsequent Pallava dynasty and its civilisation attained a peak under the later Cholas and the Pandyas . Following the conquest of Madurai by Malik Kafur in 1311 , there was a brief lull when both culture and civilisation began to deteriorate . The Tamil and Telugu territories recovered under the Vijayanagar Empire , founded in 1336 . Following the empire 's demise , the country was split amongst numerous sultans , polygars and European trading companies . Between 1685 and 1947 , a number of kings ruled the areas that became part of the Madras Presidency . 
 = = = Early English trading posts = = = 
 On 31 December 1600 , Queen Elizabeth I of England ( 1533 – 1603 ) granted a group of English merchants a charter to establish a joint @-@ stock company which became known as the East India Company . Subsequently , during the reign of King James I ( 1567 – 1625 ) , Sir William Hawkins and Sir Thomas Roe were sent to negotiate with the Mughal Emperor Jahangir ( 1569 – 1627 ) to permit the establishment of trading factories in India on behalf of the Company . The first of these were built at Surat on the west coast and at Masulipatam on the country 's eastern seaboard . Masulipatam is thus the oldest English trading post on India 's east coast , dating back to 1611 . In 1625 , another factory was established at <unk> , a few miles to the south , whereupon both the factories came under the supervision of an agency based at <unk> . The English authorities decided to relocate these factories farther south , due to a shortage of cotton cloth , the main trade item of the east coast at the time . The problem was compounded when the Sultan of Golconda started harassing the local officers . The East India Company 's administrator Francis Day ( 1605 – 73 ) was sent south , and after negotiations with the Raja of Chandragiri he obtained a land grant to set up a factory in the village of Madraspatnam , where the new Fort St George was built . An agency was created to govern the new settlement , and the factor Andrew Cogan of Masulipatnam was appointed as its first Agent . All the agencies along India 's east coast were subordinated to the East India Company presidency of Bantam in Java . By 1641 , Fort St George became the Company 's headquarters on the Coromandel Coast . 
 = = = Agency of Fort St George = = = 
 Andrew Cogan was succeeded by Francis Day ( 1643 – 1644 ) , Thomas Ivie ( 1644 – 1648 ) and Thomas Greenhill ( 1648 – 52 and 1655 – 58 ) . At the end of Greenhill 's term in 1652 , Fort St George was elevated to a Presidency , independent of Bantam and under the leadership of the first president , Aaron Baker ( 1652 – 1655 ) . However , in 1655 the status of the fort was downgraded to an Agency and made subject to the factory at Surat , until 1684 . In 1658 , control of all the factories in Bengal was given to Madras , when the English occupied the nearby village of Triplicane .

 In 1684 , Fort St George was again elevated in rank to become the Madras Presidency , with William <unk> as its first president . During this period , the Presidency was significantly expanded and reached an extent which continued into the early 19th century . During the early years of the Madras Presidency , the English were repeatedly attacked by the Mughals , the Marathas and the Nawabs of Golkonda and the Carnatic region . In September 1774 , by Pitt 's India Act , passed by the Parliament of Great Britain to unify and regulate the administration of the territories of the East India Company , the President of Madras was made subordinate to the Governor @-@ General of India based in Calcutta . In September 1746 , Fort St George was captured by the French , who ruled Madras as a part of French India until 1749 , when Madras was handed back to the British under the terms of the Treaty of Aix @-@ la @-@ Chappelle of the previous year . 
 = = = During the Company Raj = = = 
 From 1774 until 1858 , Madras was a part of British India and was ruled by the British East India Company . The last quarter of the 18th century was a period of rapid expansion . Successful wars against Tipu Sultan ( 1782 – 99 ) , Velu Thambi , <unk> and Ceylon added vast areas of land and contributed to the exponential growth of the Presidency . Newly conquered Ceylon formed part of the Madras Presidency between 1793 and 1798 . The system of subsidiary alliances originated by Lord Wellesley as Governor @-@ General of India ( 1798 – 1805 ) also brought many princely states into the area militarily subordinate to the Governor of Fort St George . The hill tracts of Ganjam and Visakhapatnam were the last places to be annexed by the British . 
 The period also witnessed a number of rebellions starting with the 1806 Vellore Mutiny . The rebellion of Velu Thambi and <unk> <unk> and the Poligar Wars were other notable insurrections against the British rule , but the Madras Presidency remained relatively undisturbed by the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 . 
 The Madras Presidency annexed the kingdom of Mysore in 1831 on allegations of maladministration and restored it to Chamaraja Wodeyar ( 1881 – 94 ) , the grandson and heir of the deposed <unk> Krishnaraja Wodeyar ( 1799 – 1868 ) in 1881 . Thanjavur was annexed in 1855 , following the death of Shivaji II ( 1832 – 1855 ) who left no male heir . 
 = = = The Victorian era = = = 
 In 1858 , under the terms of Queen 's Proclamation issued by Queen Victoria , the Madras Presidency , along with the rest of British India , came under the direct rule of the British crown . During the period of governor Lord Harris ( 1854 – 1859 ) , measures were taken to improve education and increase representation of Indians in the administration . Legislative powers were given to the Governor 's council under the Indian Councils Act 1861 . The council was reformed and expanded under the Indian Councils Act 1892 , the Indian Councils Act 1909 , the Government of India Act 1919 , and the Government of India Act 1935 . V. <unk> ( 1861 – 63 ) was the first Indian to be appointed to the council . The legal profession was specially prized by the newly emerging corpus of educated Indians . In 1877 , T. <unk> Iyer became the first Indian judge of the Madras High Court despite strong opposition from the Anglo @-@ Indian media . He also acted as the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court for a few months in 1893 , thereby becoming the first Indian to hold the post . In 1906 , C. Sankaran Nair became the first Indian to be appointed Advocate @-@ General of the Madras Presidency . A number of roads , railways , dams and canals were constructed during this period . 
 Two large famines occurred in Madras during this period , the Great Famine of 1876 – 78 and the Indian famine of 1896 – 97 . As a result , the population of the Presidency fell for the first time from 31 @.@ 2 million in 1871 to 30 @.@ 8 million in 1881 . These famines and alleged partiality shown by the government in handling the Chingleput <unk> ' Case and the Salem riots trial caused discontent among the population .

 A strong sense of national awakening emerged in the Madras Presidency in the later half of the 19th century . The first political organisation in the province , the Madras Native Association , was established by <unk> Lakshminarasu Chetty on 26 February 1852 . However , the organisation did not last long . The Madras Native Association was followed by the Madras Mahajana Sabha which was started on 16 May 1884 . Of the 72 delegates who participated in the first session of the Indian National Congress at Bombay in December 1885 , 22 hailed from the Madras Presidency . Most of the delegates were members of the Madras Mahajana Sabha . The third session of the Indian National Congress was held in Madras in December 1887 and was a huge success attended by 362 delegates from the province . Subsequent sessions of the Indian National Congress took place in Madras in 1894 , 1898 , 1903 1908 , 1914 and 1927 . 
 Madam Blavatsky and Colonel H. S. Olcott moved the headquarters of the Theosophical Society to Adyar in 1882 . The society 's most prominent figure was Annie Besant , who founded the Home Rule League in 1916 . The Home Rule Movement was organised from Madras and found extensive support in the Province . Nationalistic newspapers such as The Hindu , the Swadesamitran and the Mathrubhumi actively endorsed the campaign for independence . India 's first trade union was established in Madras in 1918 by V. Kalyanasundaram and B. P. Wadia .

 A dyarchy was created in Madras Presidency in 1920 as per the Montagu @-@ Chelmsford reforms with provisions made for elections in the presidency . Democratically elected governments would henceforth share power with the Governor 's autocratic establishment . Following the first elections held in November 1920 , the Justice Party , an organisation established in 1916 to campaign for increased representation of non @-@ Brahmins in the administration , came to power . A. Subbarayalu Reddiar became the first Chief Minister of the Madras Presidency but resigned soon after due to declining health and was replaced by P. Ramarayaningar , Minister of Local Self @-@ Government and Public Health , popularly known as the Raja of Panagal . The party split in late 1923 when C. R. Reddy resigned from primary membership and formed a splinter group allied with the opposition Swarajists . A motion of no @-@ confidence was proposed against Ramarayaningar 's government on 27 November 1923 , but was defeated 65 – 44 . Ramarayaningar remained in power until November 1926 . The enactment in August 1921 of the first communal Government Order ( G.O. No. 613 ) , which introduced caste @-@ based communal reservations in government jobs , remains one of the high points of his rule . In the following elections of 1926 the Justice Party lost . However , as no party was able to obtain a clear majority , the Governor , Lord Goschen , set up a cross @-@ party government under the leadership of P. Subbarayan and nominated its supporting members . In the election of 1930 , the Justice Party was victorious , and P. Munuswamy Naidu became Chief Minister . The exclusion of Zamindars from the Ministry split the Justice Party once again . Fearing a no @-@ confidence motion against him , Munuswamy Naidu resigned in November 1932 and the Raja of Bobbili was appointed Chief Minister in his place . The Justice Party eventually lost the 1937 elections to the Indian National Congress , and Chakravarti Rajagopalachari became Chief Minister of Madras Presidency . 
 During the 1920s and 1930s , an Anti @-@ Brahmin movement emerged in the Madras Presidency . It was launched by E. V. Ramaswamy Naicker who , unhappy with the principles and policies of the Brahmin leadership of the provincial Congress , left the party to form the Self @-@ Respect Movement . Periyar , as he was alternatively known , criticised Brahmins , Hinduism , and Hindu superstitions in periodicals and newspapers such as Viduthalai and Justice . He also participated in the Vaikom satyagraha , which campaigned for the right of untouchables in Travancore to enter temples .

 In 1937 , the Indian National Congress was elected to power in the Presidency of Madras for the first time . Chakravarti Rajagopalachari was the first Chief Minister of the Presidency to come from the Congress party . He successfully enacted the Temple Entry Authorization and Indemnity Act and introduced both prohibition and sales taxes in the Madras Presidency . His rule is largely remembered for the use of Hindi being made compulsory in educational institutions , a measure which made him highly unpopular as a politician and sparked widespread Anti @-@ Hindi agitations , which led to violence in some places . Over 1 @,@ 200 men , women , and children were jailed for their participation in such Anti @-@ Hindi agitations while <unk> and <unk> died during the protests . In 1940 , Congressional ministers resigned in protest over the Government of India 's declaration of war on Germany without their consent . The Governor of Madras , Sir Arthur Hope , took over the administration and the unpopular law was eventually repealed by him on 21 February 1940 . 
 Most Congressional leadership and erstwhile ministers were arrested in 1942 , as a result of their participation in the Quit India movement . In 1944 , Periyar renamed the Justice Party as Dravidar Kazhagam and withdrew it from electoral politics . After the end of the Second World War , the Indian National Congress re @-@ entered politics , and in the absence of any serious opposition it easily won the 1946 election . <unk> Prakasam was then elected as Chief Minister with the support of Kamaraj and served for eleven months . He was succeeded by O. P. Ramaswamy <unk> , who became the first Chief Minister of Madras state when India gained independence on 15 August 1947 . The Madras Presidency became the Madras State in independent India .

 Hinduism was the predominant religion in the presidency and practised by around 88 % of the population . The main Hindu denominations were Saivite , Vaishnavite and Lingayat . Among the Brahmins , the Smartha doctrine was quite popular . Worship of village gods was strong in the southern districts of the presidency while the mathas at Kanchi , Sringeri and Ahobilam were regarded as the centres of the Hindu faith . Of the Hindu temples , the largest and most important were the Venkateswara temple at Thirupathi , the Brihadeeswarar temple at Tanjore , the Meenakshi Amman temple at Madurai , the Ranganathaswamy temple at Srirangam , the Krishna temple at Udupi and the <unk> temple in the princely state of Travancore . Islam was brought to the southern part of India by Arab traders although most converts were made from the 14th century onwards , when Malik Kafur conquered Madurai . Nagore was the holiest city for the Muslims of the Madras Presidency . The presidency also had one of the oldest Christian populations in India . Branches of the Syrian church , contrary to historical evidence , are popularly believed to have been instituted by St. Thomas , an apostle of Jesus Christ who visited the Malabar coast in 52 AD Christians were mainly concentrated in the Tinnevely and Malabar districts of Madras Presidency with native Christians forming over one – quarter of the total population of the princely state of Travancore . Hill tribes of the Nilgiris , Palani and Ganjam regions such as the Todas , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and the <unk> , worshipped tribal gods and were often classified as Hindus . Until the early years of the 20th century , the Pallar , Paraiyar , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> Hindu communities were regarded as untouchable and were not allowed inside Hindu temples . However , along with the emancipation of Indian women and removal of social evils , untouchability was slowly eradicated through legislation and social reform . The Raja of Bobbili who served the Premier from 1932 to 1936 , appointed untouchables to temple administration boards all over the presidency . In 1939 , the Congress government of C. Rajagopalachari introduced the Temple Entry Authorization and Indemnity Act which removed all restrictions on untouchables entering Hindu temples . <unk> Thirunal of Travancore had issued a similar had earlier introduced similar legislation , the Temple Entry Proclamation at the advice of his Diwan , Sir C.

 In 1921 the Raja of Panagal 's government passed the Hindu Religious Endowments Bill that established government @-@ controlled trusts in the Madras Presidency to manage Hindu temples and prevent potential misuse of their funds . The Raja of Bobbili also introduced reforms in the administration of the Tirumala Tirupathi <unk> , the trust which manages the Hindu temple at Tirupathi .

 The Pitt 's India Act of 1784 created an executive council with legislative powers to assist the Governor . The council initially consisted of four members , two of whom were from the Indian civil service or covenanted civil service and the third , an Indian of distinction . The fourth was the Commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Madras Army . The council was reduced to three members when the Madras Army was abolished in 1895 . The legislative powers of this council were withdrawn as per the Government of India Act 1833 and it was reduced to the status of a mere advisory body . However , these powers were restored as per Indian Councils Act 1861 . The council was expanded from time to time through the inclusion of official and non @-@ official members and served as the main legislative body till 1935 , when a legislative assembly of a more representative nature was created and legislative powers were transferred to the assembly . On India 's independence on 15 August 1947 , the three @-@ member Governor 's executive council was abolished . 
 The origins of Madras Presidency lay in the village of Madraspatnam which was obtained in 1640 . This was followed by Fort St David which was acquired in 1690 . Chingleput district , known as the " <unk> " of Chingleput , obtained in 1763 , was the first district in the Madras Presidency . Salem and Malabar districts were obtained from Tipu Sultan in 1792 as per the Treaty of Seringapatam and Coimbatore and Kanara districts after the Fourth Mysore War in 1799 . The territories of the Thanjavur Maratha kingdom were constituted as a separate district in 1799 . In 1800 , the districts of Bellary and Cuddapah were created out of the territory ceded by the Nizam of Hyderabad . In 1801 , the districts of North Arcot , South Arcot , Nellore , Trichinopoly , Madura and Tinnevely were created out of the territories of the erstwhile Carnatic kingdom . Trichinopoly district was made a sub @-@ division of Tanjore district in June 1805 and remained so till August 1808 when its status as a separate district was restored . The districts of Rajahmundry ( <unk> ) , Masulipatnam and Guntur were created in 1823 . These three districts were reorganised in 1859 into two – the Godavari and Kistna districts . Godavari district was further bifurcated into East and West Godavari districts in 1925 . The Kurnool kingdom was annexed in 1839 and was constituted as a separate district of the Madras Presidency . For administrative convenience , the district of Kanara was split into North and South Kanara in 1859 . North Kanara was transferred to Bombay Presidency in 1862 . Between 1859 – 60 and 1870 , the districts of Madras and Chingleput were put together into a single district . A separate Nilgiris district was carved out of Coimbatore district in 1868 . As of 1908 , Madras Presidency was made up of 24 districts each administered by a District Collector who was from the Indian Civil Service . The districts were sometimes sub @-@ divided into divisions each under a Deputy Collector . The divisions were further sub @-@ divided into taluks and union panchayats or village committees . Agencies were sometimes created in British India out of volatile , rebellion @-@ prone areas of the Presidency . The two important agencies in the Madras Presidency were the Vizagapatam Hill Tracts Agency which was subject to the District Collector of Vizagapatam and the Ganjam Hill Tracts Agency subject to the District Collector of Ganjam . In 1936 , the districts of Ganjam and Vizagapatam ( including the Vizagapatam and the Ganjam agencies ) were partitioned between Madras and the newly created province of Orissa . 
 There were five princely states subordinate to the Madras government . They were <unk> , Cochin , Pudukkottai , Sandur , and Travancore . All these states had a considerable degree of internal autonomy . However , their foreign policy was completely controlled by a Resident who represented the Governor of Fort St George . In case of <unk> , the Resident was the District Collector of Kurnool , while the District Collector of Bellary was the Resident of Sandur . The Resident of Pudukkottai from 1800 to 1840 and 1865 to 1873 , was the District Collector of Tanjore , from 1840 to 1865 , the District Collector of Madura and from 1873 to 1947 , the District Collector of Trichinopoly . 
 = = Army = = 
 The English East India Company was first permitted to set up its own garrison in 1665 to guard its settlements . Notable amongst the early operations of the Company 's forces were the defence of the city from Mughal and Maratha invaders and from the incursions of the Nawab of Carnatic . In 1713 , the Madras forces under Lieutenant John de Morgan distinguished themselves in the siege of Fort St David and in putting down Richard <unk> 's Rebellion . 
 When Joseph François Dupleix , the Governor of French India , began to raise native battalions in 1748 , the British of Madras followed suit and established the Madras Regiment . Though native regiments were subsequently established by the British in other parts of India , the distances that separated the three presidencies resulted in each force developing divergent principles and organisations . The first reorganisation of the army took place in 1795 , when the Madras army was reconstituted into the following units : 
 European Infantry – Two battalions of ten companies 
 Artillery – Two European battalions of five companies each , with fifteen companies of lascars 
 Native Cavalry – Four regiments 
 Native Infantry – Eleven regiments of two battalions 
 In 1824 , a second reorganisation took place , whereupon the double battalions were abolished and the existing battalions were renumbered . The Madras Army at the time consisted of one European and one native brigade of horse artillery , three battalions of foot artillery of four companies each , with four companies of lascars attached , three regiments of light cavalry , two corps of pioneers , two battalions of European infantry , 52 battalions of native infantry and three local battalions . 
 Between 1748 and 1895 , as with the Bengal and Bombay armies , the Madras Army had its own Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief who was subordinate to the president , and later to the Governor of Madras . By custom the Commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Madras Army was a member of the Governor 's Executive Council . The army 's troops participated in the conquest of Manila in 1762 , the 1795 expeditions against Ceylon and the Dutch as well as the conquest of the Spice Islands in the same year . They also took part in expeditions against Mauritius ( 1810 ) , Java ( 1811 ) , the wars against Tipu Sultan and the Carnatic Wars of the 18th century , the British attack on Cuttack <unk> the Second Anglo @-@ Maratha War , the Siege of Lucknow during the Indian Mutiny , and the invasion of Upper Burma during the Third Anglo @-@ Burmese War . 
 The 1857 Mutiny , which quickly led to drastic changes in the Bengal and Bombay armies , had no effect on the Madras Army . In 1895 , the presidency armies were finally merged and the Madras regiments came under the direct control of the Commander @-@ in @-@ chief of British India . 
 The Madras Army relied heavily on the Moplahs of Malabar and on soldiers from Kodagu , at that time known as Coorg . 
 = = Land tenure = = 
 Revenue from land rental as well as an income tax based on the tenant 's net profits from their land was the presidency 's main source of income . 
 In ancient times , land appears to have been held in common with an individual unable to sell it without the consent of the other owners , who in most cases were members of the same community . Prior to the arrival of the British , the concept of individual proprietorship of land had already emerged along India 's west coast such that the new administration 's land revenue system was not markedly different from that of its predecessor . Nevertheless , landlords never sold land without the consent of other members of the community . This communistic property rights system was known as <unk> among the <unk> , <unk> among the Brahmins and <unk> among Muslims and Christians . In the Tanjore district , all <unk> in the village were vested in a single individual who was called the <unk> . The <unk> were required to donate a certain amount of money known as <unk> to the village administration . They also paid a specified sum to the Government . In return , the <unk> demanded non @-@ interference by the government in the internal affairs of the villages . 
 The proprietary system was entirely different in the district of Malabar and the states of Cochin and Travancore where communal ownership of land did not exist . Instead , land was individual property mostly owned by the landowning gentry , to wit the <unk> and Nair people , who did not have to pay land @-@ tax and held extensive <unk> of land rented to tenants for agricultural <unk> . In return the Nairs supplied the king with fighting men in times of war while the <unk> managed the upkeep of Hindu temples . These landlords were somewhat self @-@ sufficient and had their own police and judicial systems such that the personal expenses of the Raja were minimal . However , landlords lost their exemption from the taxes on land if they disposed of it meaning that mortgage of land was more common than sale . Individual <unk> of land was also common in the Telugu @-@ speaking areas of the Presidency . The chieftains of the Telugu @-@ speaking districts had more or less maintained an independent existence for a long time , furnishing the sovereign with armies and equipment in times of war . In return , their right to revenues from land remained unmolested . During the time of the British , most of land in the northern districts of the Presidency were parcelled out among these petty " Rajahs " . 
 Islamic invasions caused minor changes in the land proprietorship system when taxes on Hindu land owners were raised and private ownership of property came down . 
 When the British took over administration , the centuries @-@ old system of land proprietorship was left intact . The new rulers appointed middlemen to collect revenue for lands which were not under the control of local zamindars . In most cases , these go @-@ betweens ignored the welfare of the farmers and exploited them to the full . A Board of Revenue was established in 1786 to solve the issue but to no avail . At the same time , the <unk> settlement established in Bengal by Lord Cornwallis proved highly successful and was later implemented in the Madras Presidency from 1799 onwards . 
 However , the Permanent Settlement was not as successful as it had been in Bengal . When the Company did not reach the expected profit levels , a new system known as the " Village Settlement " was implemented between 1804 and 1814 in the districts of Tinnevely , Trichinopoly , Coimbatore , North Arcot and South Arcot . This involved the leasing of land to the principal cultivators , who in turn leased the land to ryots , or peasant farmers . However , as a village settlement had few differences compared to a permanent settlement , it was eventually discarded . In its place came the " <unk> Settlement " implemented by Sir Thomas Munro between 1820 and 1827 . According to the new system , land was handed over directly to the ryots who paid their rent directly to the government . The land was assessed and paid revenue fixed by the Government This system had a number of advantages as well as disadvantages for the ryots . In 1833 , Lord William Bentinck implemented a new system called the " <unk> " or village system under which landlords as well as ryots entered into a contract with the Government . 
 In 1911 , the greater part of the land was held by ryots who paid rent directly to the Government . Zamindari estates occupied about 26 million acres ( 110 @,@ 000 km2 ) , more than one @-@ quarter of the whole presidency . The <unk> , or tribute , payable to the government in perpetuity was about £ 330 @,@ 000 a year . <unk> , revenue @-@ free or quit @-@ rent grants of lands made for religious endowments or for services rendered to the state , occupied an aggregate area of nearly 8 million acres ( 32 @,@ 000 km2 ) . In 1945 – 46 , there were 20 @,@ 945 @,@ 456 acres ( 84 @,@ 763 @.@ 25 km2 ) of Zamindari estates yielding revenues of ₹ 9 @,@ 783 @,@ 167 and 58 @,@ 904 @,@ 798 acres ( 238 @,@ 379 @.@ 26 km2 ) of <unk> lands which produced ₹ 72 @,@ 665 @,@ 330 . Madras had forest coverage of 15 @,@ 782 square miles ( 40 @,@ 880 km2 ) . 
 The Land Estates Act of 1908 was passed by the Madras Government in order to protect cultivators in <unk> from exploitation . Under the act , ryots were made permanent occupants of the land . However , far from protecting the ryots , the legislation proved to be detrimental to the interests of the cultivators in the Oriya @-@ speaking northern districts of the presidency who were the intended beneficiaries , as it tied the cultivator to his land and landlord with the chains of eternal serfdom . In 1933 , an amendment to the Act was introduced by the Raja of Bobbili to curb the rights of Zamindars and safeguard the cultivators from exploitation . This act was passed in the legislative council despite strong opposition from the Zamindars . 
 = = Agriculture and irrigation = = 
 Almost 71 % of the population of Madras Presidency was engaged in agriculture with the agricultural year usually commencing on 1 July . Crops cultivated in the Madras Presidency included cereals such as rice , corn , <unk> ( Indian millet ) and ragi as well as vegetables including <unk> , sweet potato , ladies ' fingers , beans , onions , garlic and spices such as chilli , pepper and ginger along with vegetable oils made from castor beans and peanuts . Fruits cultivated included lime , banana jackfruit , cashew nuts , mangos , custard apples and papayas . In addition , cabbages , cauliflowers , <unk> , peaches , betel pepper , niger seed and millet were introduced from Asia , Africa or Europe , while grapes were introduced from Australia . The total cultivated area used for food crops was 80 % and for cash crops , 15 % . Of the gross area , rice occupied 26 @.@ 4 percent ; <unk> , 10 percent ; ragi , 5 @.@ 4 percent and <unk> , 13 @.@ 8 percent . Cotton occupied 1 @,@ 740 @,@ 000 acres ( 7 @,@ 000 km2 ) , oilseeds , 2 @.@ 08 million , spices , 0 @.@ 4 million and indigo , 0 @.@ 2 million . In 1898 , Madras produced 7 @.@ 47 million tons of food grains from 21 @,@ 570 @,@ 000 acres ( 87 @,@ 300 km2 ) of crops grown on 19 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 acres ( 78 @,@ 000 km2 ) of <unk> and <unk> lands , which supported a population of 28 million . The rice yield was 7 to 10 cwt. per acre , the <unk> yields were 3 @.@ 5 to 6 @.@ 25 cwt. per acre , <unk> , 3 @.@ 25 to 5 cwt. per acre and ragi , 4 @.@ 25 to 5 cwt. per acre . The average gross turnout for food crops was 6 @.@ 93 cwt. per acre . 
 Irrigation along the east coast is carried out mostly by means of dams across rivers , lakes and irrigation tanks . The main source of water for agriculture in the Coimbatore district were tanks . 
 The Land Improvement and <unk> Loan Act passed in 1884 provided funds for the construction of wells and their utilisation in reclamation projects . In the early part of the 20th century , the Madras government established the Pumping and Boring Department to drill boreholes with electric pumps . The Mettur Dam , the Periyar Project , the Cudappah @-@ Kurnool canal and the Rushikulya Project were the biggest irrigation projects launched by the Madras Government . Constructed below the <unk> Falls on the Madras @-@ Mysore border in 1934 , the Mettur Dam supplied water to the western districts of the Presidency . The Periyar Dam ( now known as the <unk> Dam ) was constructed across the Periyar river in Travancore , near the border . This project diverted the waters of the Periyar river to the Vaigai River basin in order to irrigate the arid lands to the east of the Western Ghats . Similarly , the Rushikulya Project was launched to utilise the waters of the Rushikulya river in Ganjam . Under the scheme over 142 @,@ 000 acres ( 570 km2 ) of land were brought under irrigation . The British also constructed a number of dams and canals for irrigation . An upper dam was constructed across the Kollidam river near Srirangam island . The <unk> dam across the Godavari river , the <unk> aqueduct across the <unk> Godavari , the Kurnool @-@ Cuddapah canal and the Krishna dam are examples of major irrigation works carried out by the British . In 1946 – 47 , the total area under irrigation was 9 @,@ 736 @,@ 974 acres ( 39 @,@ 404 @.@ 14 km2 ) acres which yielded a return of 6 @.@ 94 % on capital outlay . 
 = = Trade , industry and commerce = = 
 The trade of the Madras Presidency comprised that of both the Presidency with other Provinces and its overseas trade . External trade made up 93 percent of the total with internal trade making up the remainder . Foreign trade accounted for 70 percent of the total while 23 percent was inter @-@ provincial . In 1900 – 01 , imports from other provinces of British India amounted to ₹ 13 @.@ 43 crores while exports to other provinces amounted to ₹ 11 @.@ 52 crores . During the same year , exports to other countries reached ₹ 11 @.@ 74 crores while imports were valued at ₹ 66 @.@ 2 million . At the time of India 's independence , imports of the Presidency amounted to ₹ 71 @.@ 32 crores a year while exports were valued at ₹ 645 @.@ 1 million . Trade with the United Kingdom made up 31 @.@ 54 % of the total trade of the Presidency with Madras the chief port accounting for 49 % of the total trade . 
 Cotton piece @-@ goods , cotton twist and yarn , metals and kerosene oil were the main items of import while animal hides and skins , raw cotton , coffee and piece @-@ goods were the chief exports . Raw cotton , animal hides , oil seeds , grains , pulses , coffee , tea and cotton manufactures were the main items of sea trade . Most of the sea trade was carried through the presidency 's principal port of Madras . Other important ports were Gopalpur , Kalingapatnam , <unk> , Visakhapatnam , Masulipatnam , Cocanada , Madras , Cuddalore , Negapatam , Pamban and Tuticorin on the east coast along with Mangalore , Cannanore , Calicut , Tellicherry , Cochin , Alleppey , Quilon ( <unk> ) and <unk> on the western seaboard . The port of Cochin was taken over by the Government of India on 1 August 1936 , and that of Madras on 1 April 1937 . There were Chambers of Commerce in Madras , Cochin and Cocanada . These chambers each nominated a member to the Madras Legislative Council . 
 Cotton @-@ <unk> and weaving were two of the main industries in the Madras Presidency . Cotton was produced in large quantities in the Bellary district and was pressed in Georgetown , Madras . The scarcity of cotton in Lancashire caused by a decline in trade due to the American Civil War gave an impetus to cotton and textile production and led to cotton presses being established all over the Presidency . In the early years of the 20th century , Coimbatore emerged as an important centre for cotton textiles and earned the epithet " Manchester of South India " . The northern districts of Godavari , Vizagapatam and Kistna were well @-@ known cotton @-@ weaving centres . There was a sugar factory at Aska in Ganjam run by F. J. V. Minchin and another at <unk> in South Arcot district run by the East India Distilleries and Sugar Factories Company . In the Telugu @-@ speaking northern districts of the presidency large quantities of tobacco were cultivated to be subsequently rolled into <unk> . Trichinopoly , Madras and Dindigul were the main cheroot @-@ producing areas . Until the discovery of artificial aniline and <unk> dyes , Madras possessed a thriving vegetable dye manufacturing industry . The city also imported large quantities of aluminium for the manufacture of aluminium utensils . In the early 20th century , the government established the Chrome Tanning Factory which manufactured high @-@ quality leather . The first brewery in the Presidency was founded in the Nilgiri Hills in 1826 . Coffee was cultivated in the region of Wynad and the kingdoms of Coorg and Mysore while tea was grown on the slopes of the Nilgiri Hills . Coffee plantations were also established in Travancore but a severe blight at the end of the 19th century destroyed coffee cultivation in the kingdom and almost wiped out coffee plantations in neighbouring Wynad . Coffee @-@ curing works were located at Calicut , Tellicherry , Mangalore and Coimbatore . In 1947 , Madras had 3 @,@ 761 factories with 276 @,@ 586 operatives . 
 The presidency 's fishing industry thrived , with Shark 's fins , fish maws and fish curing @-@ operations the main sources of income for fishermen . The southern port of Tuticorin was a centre of conch @-@ fishing but Madras , along with Ceylon , was mainly known for its pearl fisheries . Pearl fisheries were harvested by the <unk> and was a lucrative profession . 
 The total revenue of the Presidency was ₹ 57 crores in 1946 – 47 made as follows : Land revenue , ₹ 8 @.@ 53 crores ; Excise , ₹ 14 @.@ 68 crores ; Income tax , ₹ 4 @.@ 48 crores ; Stamp revenue , ₹ 4 @.@ 38 crores ; forests , ₹ 1 @.@ 61 crores ; other taxes , ₹ 8 @.@ 45 crores ; Extraordinary receipts , ₹ 2 @.@ 36 crores and revenue fund , <unk> crores . Total expenditure for 1946 – 47 was ₹ 569 @.@ 9 million . 208 @,@ 675 <unk> of electricity was generated at the end of 1948 of which 98 % was under government ownership . The total amount of power generated was 467 million units . 
 The Madras Stock Exchange was established in Madras city in 1920 with a strength of 100 members but gradually faded away and membership had reduced to three by 1923 when it had to be closed down . Nevertheless , the Madras Stock Exchange was successfully revived in September 1937 and was incorporated as the Madras Stock Exchange Association Limited . <unk> Parry , Binny and Co. and Arbuthnot Bank were the largest private @-@ owned business corporations at the turn of the 20th century . <unk> Parry manufactured and sold chemical fertilizers and sugar while the <unk> marketed cotton garments and uniforms manufactured at its spinning and weaving facility , the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills in <unk> . Arbuthnot , owned by the Arbuthnot family , was the largest bank in the Presidency until its crash in 1906 . Reduced to penury , disillusioned former Indian investors established the Indian Bank with funds donated by <unk> <unk> . 
 Between 1913 and 1914 , Madras had 247 companies . In 1947 , the city led in the establishment of registered factories but employed only 62 % of the total productive capital . 
 The first Western @-@ style banking institution in India was the Madras Bank which was established on 21 June 1683 , with a capital of one hundred thousand pounds sterling . This was followed by the opening of the Carnatic Bank in 1788 , the Bank of Madras in 1795 and the Asiatic Bank in 1804 . In 1843 , all the banks were merged to form the Bank of Madras . The Bank of Madras had branches in all the presidency 's major cities and princely states including Coimbatore , Mangalore , Calicut , Tellicherry , <unk> , Cocanada , Guntur , Masulipatnam , Ootacamund , <unk> , Tuticorin , Bangalore , Cochin and Colombo in Ceylon . In 1921 , the Bank of Madras merged with the Bank of Bombay and the Bank of Bengal to form the Imperial Bank of India . In the 19th century , the Arbuthnot Bank was one of the largest privately owned banks in the Presidency . The City Union Bank , the Indian Bank , Canara Bank , Corporation Bank , Nadar Bank , Karur Vysya Bank , Catholic Syrian Bank , Karnataka Bank , Bank of Chettinad , Andhra Bank , Vysya Bank , Vijaya Bank , Indian Overseas Bank and the Bank of Madura were some of the leading banks headquartered in the Presidency . 
 = = Transport and communication = = 
 In the early days of the agency , the only means of transportation were bullock @-@ carts known as <unk> along with palanquins . The roads connecting Madras to Calcutta in the north and the kingdom of Travancore in the south served as lines of communication during wars . From the early 20th century onwards , bullock @-@ carts and horses were gradually replaced by bicycles and motor vehicles , while motor buses were the main means of private road transportation . Presidency Transport and the City Motor Service were pioneers , operating buses manufactured by Simpson and Co. as early as 1910 . The first organised bus system in Madras city was operated by Madras Tramways Corporation between 1925 and 1928 . The 1939 Motor Vehicles Act imposed restrictions on public @-@ owned bus and motor services . Most of the early bus services were operated by private agencies . 
 The first organised initiative for the construction of new roads and maintenance of existing roads in the Presidency was initiated in 1845 with the appointment of a special officer for the maintenance of main roads . The principal roads under the aegis of the officer were the Madras @-@ Bangalore road , Madras @-@ Trichinopoly road , Madras @-@ Calcutta road , Madras @-@ Cuddapah road and the <unk> Ghaut road . A Public Works Department was initiated by Lord Dalhousie in 1852 and subsequently in 1855 an East coast canal was constructed for the purpose of easy navigation . Roadways were handled by the Public Works Secretariat which was under the control of the member of the Governor 's Executive Council . The principal highways of the Presidency were the Madras @-@ Calcutta road , the Madras @-@ Travancore road and the Madras @-@ Calicut road . By 1946 – 47 , the Madras Presidency had 26 @,@ 201 miles ( 42 @,@ 166 km ) of metalled roads and 14 @,@ 406 miles ( 23 @,@ 184 km ) of <unk> roads , and 1 @,@ 403 miles ( 2 @,@ 258 km ) of navigable canals . 
 The first railway line in South India was laid between Madras and Arcot , which was opened for traffic on 1 July 1856 . The line was constructed by the Madras Railway Company formed in 1845 . The railway station at <unk> , the first in South India , was built in 1853 and served as the headquarters of the Madras Railway Company . The Great Southern Indian Railway Company was set up in the United Kingdom in 1853 @.@ and had its headquarters at Trichinopoly where it constructed its first railway line between Trichinopoly and Negapatam in 1859 . The Madras Railway Company operated standard or broad @-@ gauge railway lines while the Great South Indian Railway Company operated metre @-@ gauge railway lines . In 1874 , The Great Southern Indian Railway Company merged with the Carnatic Railway Company ( established in 1864 ) and was renamed the Southern Indian Railway Company . The Southern Indian Railway Company merged with the Pondicherry Railway Company in 1891 while the Madras Railway Company merged with the Southern Mahratta Railway Company in 1908 to form the Madras and South Mahratta Railway Company . A new terminus was built at Egmore for the Madras and South Mahratta Railway Company . In 1927 , the South Indian Railway Company shifted its headquarters from Madurai to Chennai Central . The company operated a suburban electric train service for Madras city from May 1931 onwards . In April 1944 , the Madras and South Mahratta Railway Company was taken over by the Madras Government . In 1947 , there were 4 @,@ 961 miles ( 7 @,@ 984 km ) of railway in the Presidency , in addition to 136 miles ( 219 km ) of district board lines . Madras was well @-@ connected with other Indian cities like Bombay and Calcutta and with Ceylon . The 6 @,@ 776 @-@ foot ( 2 @,@ 065 m ) Pamban railway bridge connecting Mandapam on the Indian mainland with Pamban island was opened for traffic in 1914 . The Nilgiri Mountain Railway was inaugurated between Mettupalayam and Ootacamund in 1899 . 
 The Madras Tramways Corporation was promoted in Madras city in 1892 by Hutchinsons and Co. and began operating in 1895 , before even London had its own tramway system . It plied six routes in Madras linking distant parts of Madras city and covered a total of 17 miles ( 27 km ) . 
 The chief navigable waterways in the presidency were the canals in the Godavari and the Kistna deltas . The Buckingham canal was cut in 1806 at a cost of 90 lakhs of silver to connect the city of Madras with the delta of the Kistna river at <unk> . Ships of the British India Steam Navigation Company frequently docked at Madras and provided frequent services to Bombay , Calcutta , Colombo and Rangoon . 
 In 1917 , Simpson and Co. arranged for a test flight by the first aeroplane in Madras while a flying club was established at the Mount Golf Club grounds near St Thomas Mount by a pilot named G. Vlasto in October 1929 . This site was later used as the Madras aerodrome . One of the early members of the club , Rajah Sir Annamalai Chettiar went on to establish an aerodrome in his native Chettinad . On 15 October 1932 , Royal Air Force pilot Nevill Vintcent piloted J. R. D. Tata 's plane carrying air @-@ mail from Bombay to Madras via Bellary . This was the beginning of Tata Sons ' regular domestic passenger and airmail service from Karachi to Madras . The flight was later re @-@ routed through Hyderabad and became bi @-@ weekly . On 26 November 1935 , Tata Sons started an experimental weekly service from Bombay to Trivandrum via Goa and Cannanore . From 28 February 1938 , onwards , Tata Sons ' Aviation division , now renamed Tata Airlines , began a Karachi to Colombo airmail service via Madras and Trichinopoly . On 2 March 1938 , the Bombay @-@ Trivandrum air service was extended to Trichinopoly . 
 The first organised postal service was established between Madras and Calcutta by Governor Edward Harrison in 1712 . After reform and regularisation , a new postal system was started by Sir Archibald Campbell and was introduced on 1 June 1786 . The Presidency was divided into three postal divisions : Madras North up to Ganjam , Madras South @-@ West to <unk> ( erstwhile Travancore ) and Madras West , up to Vellore . In the same year , a link with Bombay was established then in 1837 , the Madras , Bombay and Calcutta mail services were integrated to form the All @-@ India Service . On 1 October 1854 , the first stamps were issued by the Imperial Postal Service . The General Post Office ( GPO ) , Madras , was established by Sir Archibald Campbell in 1786 . In 1872 – 73 , a bimonthly sea @-@ mail service began between Madras and Rangoon . This was followed by the commencement of a fortnightly sea @-@ mail service between Madras and ports on the eastern coast . 
 Madras was linked to the rest of the world through telegraphs in 1853 and a civilian telegraph service was introduced on 1 February 1855 . Soon afterwards , telegraph lines linked Madras and Ootacamund with other cities in India . A Telegraph department was set up in 1854 , with a Deputy Superintendent stationed in Madras city . The Colombo @-@ Talaimannar telegraph line established in 1858 , was extended to Madras in 1882 , thereby connecting the city with Ceylon . Telephones were introduced in the presidency in 1881 and on 19 November 1881 , the first telephone exchange with 17 connections was established at <unk> Street in Madras . A wireless <unk> service was established between Madras and Port Blair in 1920 and in 1936 , the Indo @-@ Burma radio telephone service was established between Madras and Rangoon . 
 = = Education = = 
 The first schools offering Western @-@ style education in the presidency were established in Madras during the 18th century . In 1822 , a Board of Public Instruction was created based on the recommendations of Sir Thomas Munro , after which schools teaching students in vernacular language was established . A central training school was set up in Madras as per Munro 's scheme . However , this system appeared to be a failure and the policy was altered in 1836 in order to promote European literature and science . The Board of Public Instruction was superseded by a Committee for Native Education . In January 1840 , during the viceroyalty of Lord Ellenborough , a University Board was established with Alexander J. Arbuthnot as the Joint Director of Public Instruction . The central school was converted to a high school in April 1841 with 67 students and in 1853 became the Presidency College with the addition of a college department . On 5 September 1857 , the University of Madras was established as an examining body using the University of London as a model with the first examinations held in February 1858 . C. W. <unk> Pillai and Caroll V. <unk> Pillai of Ceylon were the first to graduate from the University . Sir S. <unk> Iyer was the first Indian Vice @-@ Chancellor of the University . 
 Similarly , Andhra University was established by the Andhra University Act of 1925 and in 1937 , the University of Travancore was established in the princely state of Travancore . 
 The Government Arts College , established in Kumbakonam in 1867 , was one of the first educational institutions outside Madras . The oldest engineering college in the presidency , College of Engineering , Guindy , was established as a Government Survey School in 1794 before being upgraded to an Engineering College in 1861 . Initially , only Civil Engineering was taught , with the further disciplines of Mechanical Engineering added in 1894 , Electrical Engineering in 1930 and Telecommunication and Highways in 1945 . The AC College , with its emphasis on textiles and leather technology , was founded by <unk> Chettiar in 1944 . The Madras Institute of Technology , which introduced courses such as aeronautical and automobile engineering was established in 1949 . In 1827 , the first medical school in the Presidency was established then followed by the Madras Medical College in 1835 . The Government Teacher 's College was established at <unk> in 1856 . 
 Among the private institutions , the Pachaiyappa 's College , established in 1842 , is the oldest Hindu educational institution in the presidency . The Annamalai University , established by Rajah Sir Annamalai Chettiar in Chidambaram in 1929 , was the first university in the presidency to have hostel facilities Christian missionaries were pioneers in promoting education in the region . The Madras Christian College , St. Aloysius College at Mangalore , Loyola College in Madras and the St. Peter 's College at Tanjore were some of the educational institutions established by Christian missionaries . 
 The Madras Presidency had the highest literacy rate of all the provinces in British India . In 1901 , Madras had a male literacy rate of 11 @.@ 9 percent and a female literacy rate of 0 @.@ 9 percent . In 1950 , when the Madras Presidency became Madras State , the literacy rate was slightly higher than the national average of 18 percent . In 1901 , there were 26 @,@ 771 public and private institutions with 923 @,@ 760 scholars of whom 784 @,@ 621 were male and 139 @,@ 139 female . By 1947 , the number of educational institutions had increased to 37 @,@ 811 and the number of scholars to 3 @,@ 989 @,@ 686 . Apart from colleges , in 1947 there were 31 @,@ 975 public and elementary schools , 720 secondary schools for boys and 4 @,@ 173 elementary and 181 secondary schools for girls . Most of the early graduates were Brahmins . The preponderance of Brahmins in the universities and in the civic administration was one of the main causes for the growth of the Anti @-@ Brahmin movement in the presidency . Madras was also the first province in British India where caste @-@ based communal reservations were introduced . 
 In 1923 , the Madras University Act was passed after its introduction by Education Minister A. P. Patro . Under the bill 's provisions , the governing body of Madras University was completely reorganised on democratic lines . The bill asserted that the governing body would henceforth be headed by a Chancellor who would be assisted by a pro @-@ Chancellor , usually the Minister of Education . Apart from the Chancellor and the pro @-@ Chancellor who were elected , there was to be a Vice @-@ Chancellor appointed by the Chancellor . 
 = = Culture and society = = 
 Hindus , Muslims and Christians generally followed a joint family system . The society was largely patriarchal with the eldest male member the leader of the family . Most of the presidency followed a patrilineal system of inheritance . The only exceptions were the district of Malabar and the princely states of Travancore and Cochin which practised the <unk> system . 
 Women were expected to confine themselves to indoor activities and the maintenance of the household . Muslims and high @-@ caste Hindu women observed purdah . The daughter in the family rarely received an education and usually helped her mother with household chores . Upon marrying , she moved to the house of her in @-@ laws where she was expected to serve her husband and the elder members of his family . There have been recorded instances of torture and ill treatment of daughter @-@ in @-@ laws . A Brahmin widow was expected to shave her head and was subjected to numerous indignities . 
 Rural society comprised villages where people of different communities lived together . Brahmins lived in separate streets called <unk> . Untouchables lived outside village limits in small hamlets called <unk> and were strictly forbidden from having houses in the village . They were also forbidden from entering important Hindu temples or approaching high @-@ caste Hindus . 
 Serfdom was practised in almost all castes from Brahmins to non @-@ Brahmins subjecting agricultural labourers to bondage for non @-@ payment of debt . The Law Commission report on slavery in 1841 contains the indicative figures on the number of slaves , computed based on the population of specific castes of Pallar and Paraiyar . There were proposed regulations in 1811 and 1823 to prevent child labour . In 1833 , the British Crown and the House of Commons proposed immediate <unk> of slavery in India , but East India Company decreed otherwise . All legal recognition to permit the civil status of slavery were withdrawn with the Act V of 1843 and selling of slaves became a criminal offence in 1862 under the new Indian Penal Code . In spite of these regulations , serfdom continued and the slave population formed 12 @.@ 2 % – 20 % of the total population in 1930 across various districts of the Presidency . 
 With the influx of Western education starting from the middle of the 19th century , social reforms were introduced to remove the problems of traditional Indian society . The Malabar Marriage Act of 1896 recognised <unk> contracts as legal marriages while the <unk> system was abolished by the <unk> Law of 1933 . Numerous measures were taken to improve the lot of Dalit outcasts . The <unk> Tirupathi <unk> Act ( 1933 ) , included Dalits in the <unk> administration . The <unk> 's Temple Entry Authorization Act ( 1939 ) and its Temple Entry Proclamation ( 1936 ) of Travancore were aimed at elevating the status of Dalit and other low castes to a position equal to that of high @-@ caste Hindus . In 1872 , T. <unk> Iyer established the Widow Remarriage Association in Madras and advocated the remarriage of Brahmin widows . The devadasi system was regulated in 1927 and completely abolished on 26 November 1947 . The Widow Remarriage movement was spearheaded in the Godavari district by <unk> <unk> . Most of the pioneers of social reform were Indian nationalists . 
 Traditional pastimes and forms of recreation in rural areas were cock @-@ fighting , bull @-@ fighting , village fairs and plays . Men in urban areas indulged in social and communistic activities at recreational clubs , music concerts or <unk> , dramas and welfare organisations . Carnatic music and <unk> were especially patronised by the upper and upper @-@ middle class Madras society . Of the sports introduced by the British in the presidency , cricket , tennis , football and hockey were the most popular . An annual cricket tournament , known as the Madras Presidency Matches , was held between Indians and Europeans during Pongal . 
 The presidency 's first newspaper , the Madras Courier , was started on 12 October 1785 , by Richard Johnston , a printer employed by the British East India Company . The first Indian @-@ owned English @-@ language newspaper was The Madras Crescent which was established by freedom @-@ fighter <unk> Lakshminarasu Chetty in October 1844 . Lakshminarasu Chetty is also credited with the foundation of the Madras Presidency Association which was a forerunner of the Indian National Congress . The number of newspapers and periodicals published in the presidency totalled 821 in 1948 . The two most popular English @-@ language newspapers were The Hindu established by G. Subramania Iyer in 1878 , and The Mail , established as the Madras Times by the Gantz family in 1868 . 
 Regular radio service in the presidency commenced in 1938 when All India Radio established a station in Madras . Cinemas became popular in the 1930s and 1940s with the first film in a South Indian language , R. Nataraja Mudaliar 's Tamil film Keechaka Vadham , released in 1916 . The first sound films in Tamil and Telugu were made in 1931 while the first Kannada talkie Sati Sulochana was made in 1934 and the first Malayalam talkie Balan in 1938 . There were film studios at Coimbatore , Salem , Madras and Karaikudi . Most early films were made in Coimbatore and Salem but from the 1940s onwards , Madras began to emerge as the principal centre of film production . Until the 1950s , most films in Telugu , Kannada and Malayalam were made in Madras .

 The iPad 2 is a tablet designed , developed and marketed by Apple Inc . Compared to the first iPad , as the second device in the iPad line it gained a faster dual core A5 processor , a lighter build structure , and was the first iPad to feature VGA front @-@ facing and 720p rear @-@ facing cameras designed for FaceTime video calling . 
 The device was available initially with three storage sizes , 16 , 32 and 64 GB and two varying connectivity options , Wi @-@ Fi only or Wi @-@ Fi and cellular . Each variation of the device is available with either a black or white front glass panel . However , upon the release of the 3rd generation iPad , only the 16 GB variation with two connectivity options and two front color options was available . 
 Apple unveiled the device on March 2 , 2011 . Upon the announcement of the iPad 2 , the original model of the iPad was discontinued . Sales of the iPad 2 online and at retail stores began in the United States on March 11 . It was then released in 25 other Oceanian , North American and Western European countries on March 25 and released in eleven Asian countries as well as one African country on April 29 . Subsequently on May 6 and 27 , the device was released in three South American , six Eastern European and three Asian countries . 
 The device received mixed to positive reception from various blogs and publications . Although it was praised for its hardware improvement , such as the new Apple A5 chip , the software restriction on the iPad 2 and iOS in general drew criticism from various technology commentators . The device sold well in its first month of sales with 2 @.@ 4 – 2 @.@ 6 million units sold and 11 @.@ 12 million units were sold in the third quarter of 2011 . 
 A popular product , with a lower screen resolution and performance than the two Retina models that followed it but a lighter build and longer battery life , it remained in the Apple line @-@ up as an entry @-@ level iPad model for three years until March 2014 , latterly with a silent upgrade to a die @-@ shrunk version of the A5 processor . Its basic design formed the core of the first iPad mini , which had the same screen pixel count and similar features at a smaller size . The iPad 2 has been able to run six major versions of iOS , from 4 to 9 , the first and only iOS device to be able to do so .

 Apple sent invitations to journalists on February 23 , 2011 , for a media event on March 2 . On March 2 , 2011 , CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the device at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts , despite being on medical leave . Upon the announcement of the iPad 2 , the original iPad was discontinued from sales online and at Apple authorized retail stores . 
 Apple began selling the iPad 2 on its website on March 11 , and in its U.S. retail stores at 5 pm local time on that date . Many stores in major cities , such as New York , sold out within hours . Online shipping delays had increased to three to four weeks on Sunday and four to five weeks by Tuesday . 
 The iPad 2 was released internationally in 25 other countries on March 25 , 2011 . The countries included Australia , Austria , Belgium , Canada , Czech Republic , Denmark , Finland , France , Germany , Greece , Iceland , Italy , Ireland , Hungary , Luxembourg , Mexico , Netherlands , New Zealand , Norway , Poland , Portugal , Spain , Sweden , Switzerland and the United Kingdom . 
 The April 29 , 2011 release date for Japan was postponed due to the earthquake and tsunami which struck the nation on March 11 , 2011 . The iPads were delayed due to the NAND flash storage chip used in the iPads being created by Toshiba , which was affected by the earthquake and tsunami thus resulting in the suspension of operations for an indefinite period of time . The slowdown caused analysts to downgrade Apple 's stock . 
 The iPad 2 was later released in Hong Kong , South Korea , Singapore , Malaysia and other countries including Japan on April 29 , 2011 . It was then released in numerous other nations which include China , Estonia , Thailand , Brazil , Russia and Taiwan on two major release dates , May 6 and 27 . 
 The 32 and 64 GB models were discontinued on March 7 , 2012 , upon the introduction of the third generation iPad . The 16 GB Wi @-@ Fi and 16 GB Wi @-@ Fi + 3G models were discontinued on March 18 , 2014 .

 In late March 2011 , the iPad 2 was released alongside iOS 4 @.@ 2 @.@ 1 , which primarily introduced FaceTime , Personal Hotspots and AirPlay support among other features . The iPad 2 is compatible with iOS 4 @.@ 3 , which introduced Airplay Mirroring and Home Sharing among other features . On October 12 , 2011 , upon the release of the iPhone 4S , the iPad was upgradable to the iOS 5 firmware which brought over 200 new user features to iOS compatible devices including Notification Center , iMessage , <unk> , and an updated notifications system , using a new " banner " style instead of the previously used pop @-@ up " alert " style . 
 The iPad 2 comes with several applications by default , including Safari , Mail , Photos , Video , Music , iTunes ( store ) , Maps , Notes , Calendar , Photo Booth , and Contacts . The App Store is also available as a default application , it enables users to download from a database of 800 @,@ 000 applications , the price of these applications is set by the developers . Like all iOS devices , the iPad 2 can sync music , videos , apps and photos with a Mac or PC using iTunes , although when using iOS 5 and later , the user does not have to connect the iPad to the <unk> iCloud also allows users to backup and sync their data with other compatible iOS devices via the internet . Game Center is available as a native social gaming platform on iOS , games downloaded via the App Store that have this feature enabled are able to integrate their achievement points , high @-@ scores and bonus system across all iOS devices into a single accumulative points and social platform . Although the tablet is not designed to make phone calls over a cellular network , a user can use a wired headset or the built @-@ in speaker and microphone and place phone calls over Wi @-@ Fi or cellular using a VoIP application . 
 The iPad 2 also adds the capability to support GarageBand , iMovie , and the iWork apps Pages , Keynote , and Numbers . These applications do not come with the iPad but are instead official applications from Apple sold within the App Store . On March 7 , 2012 , after the unveiling of the third generation iPad , the firmware of the iPad 2 was upgradable to iOS 5 @.@ 1 . Scott Rohde , a senior Sony executive described the iPad as " a game console disguised as a device that can be appropriated in the business workplace . " 
 On September 19 , 2012 , almost a week after the announcement of the iPhone 5 , iOS 6 was released for numerous iOS devices , including the iPad 2 . However , on iOS 6 , not all features are available on the iPad 2 . The software upgrade was downloadable as an over the air ( OTA ) update package and contains two @-@ hundred new features , including a mapping software designed by Apple dubbed Apple Maps , a " Clock " app , which features a timer , stopwatch and alarm , and Facebook integration among other new features and tweaks . 
 The iPad 2 is compatible with iOS 7 , which was released on September 18 , 2013 . However , some features are not supported . For example , like the iPhone 4 , the Notification Center and the Control Center use the transparent style instead of the translucent style in later iOS models . 
 The iPad 2 supports iOS 8 which was released September 17 , 2014 , making it the first iOS device to support 5 major versions of iOS ( including iOS 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 ) . While the device is still supported , most of the new features of the software are not supported due to relatively aged hardware and therefore , is limited in terms of performance . Users have also reported numerous problems after receiving the update including the accessibility features and battery @-@ related issues . Many users predicted that the iPad 2 was going to be dropped from updating to iOS 8 along with the iPhone 4 , the same process that happened with the iPhone 3GS and the iPod Touch ( fourth generation ) and earlier models , considering that it has been supported for more than 3 years . 
 It was confirmed on June 8 , 2015 , at Apple 's WWDC that the iPad 2 would support iOS 9 . This makes the iPad 2 the first iPad and only iOS device to support six major versions of iOS . As with previous releases , though , many headline features are unavailable on the iPad 2 , including predictive Siri , translucency effects , split @-@ view , slide @-@ over and picture @-@ in @-@ picture multitasking , Low Power Mode and the Health <unk> iOS 9 is said to feature performance improvements that may help the aging device function more smoothly , and initial tests suggest that it did not significantly impact available space . Other A5 @-@ based devices will also support iOS 9 including the iPhone 4S ( five major iOS versions ) , the iPad Mini ( four major iOS versions ) and iPod Touch 5G ( four major iOS versions ) . 
 It was confirmed that iPad 2 and iPad ( 3rd Generation ) will not support iOS 10 .

Other features include front and rear cameras , a three @-@ axis gyroscope , headset controls , proximity and ambient light sensors , microphone , magnetometer , accelerometer and a 9 @.@ 7 inch multi @-@ touch screen with a maximum resolution of 1024 × 768 hence resulting in 132 ppi . The iPad 2 has four physical switches , including a home button near the display that returns the user to the home screen , and three plastic physical switches on the sides : wake / sleep , volume up / down , and a third switch for either screen rotation lock or mute . The home button on the iPad 2 is " easier to double tap " than the previous generation of the iPad . Apple reduced the size of the iPad by eliminating the stamped sheet metal frame from the display , integrating new thinner glass technology for the touch screen overlay , and slightly reducing the space between the display and battery . The iPad 2 's screen is thinner , lighter , and yet stronger than the original iPad 's . The iPad 2 also supports screen mirroring via the digital AV adapter and through AirPlay as of iOS 5 . 
 The iPad 2 has a 25 W · h rechargeable lithium @-@ ion polymer battery that lasts 10 hours , like the original iPad . It is charged via USB or included 10 W , 2 A power adapter . The battery is 2 @.@ 5 mm thick , 59 % smaller than the original and has three cells instead of two . The improvements allowed the injection @-@ molded plastic support frame to be omitted . The 10 W USB power adapter provides 4x the power of a conventional USB port . The tablet has an audio frequency response of 20 Hz to 20 kHz . Without third @-@ party software it can play the following audio formats : HE @-@ AAC , AAC , Protected AAC , MP3 , MP3 VBR , Audible formats ( 2 , 3 , 4 , AEA , AAX , and AAX + ) , ALAC , AIFF , and WAV . 
 The revised tablet adds <unk> and rear @-@ facing cameras , which allow FaceTime video calls with other iPad 2s , the third generation iPad , iPhone 4 and 4S , fourth @-@ generation iPod Touch and Macintosh computers ( running Mac OS X 10 @.@ 6 @.@ 6 or later with a webcam ) . The 0 @.@ 3 MP front camera shoots VGA @-@ quality 30 frame / s video and VGA @-@ quality still photos . The 0 @.@ 7 MP back camera can shoot 720p HD video at 30 frame / s and has a 5 × times digital zoom . Both shoot photo in a 4 : 3 fullscreen aspect ratio . The rear camera shoots video in 16 : 9 widescreen to match the 720p standard , although only the central 4 : 3 part of the recording is shown on the screen during recording . The forward @-@ facing camera shoots in 4 : 3 . 
 The Apple A5 chip doubles processing speed and has graphics processing that is up to nine times faster than the previous iPad . However , <unk> and hardware assessments performed by various third party news sources and technology blogs indicate that those claims are exaggerated , the benchmark assessment conducted by Anandtech showed that the GPU of the iPad 2 is only 3 times faster than that of the original iPad . CPU benchmarks conducted on the iPad 2 by <unk> indicate a 66 % performance increase compared to the original iPad . 
 3G versions of the iPad 2 offer <unk> support for customers using the device on a CDMA network or GSM / UMTS support for customers using the device on a GSM / UMTS network . The iPad Wi @-@ Fi + 3G model includes an A @-@ GPS receiver for tracking the user 's location given permission . Also , the iPad 2 3G model includes a plastic cap @-@ like band at the top on the back for the 3G antenna . The metallic grille for the microphone is replaced with a matching plastic black grille on the 3G model . GSM models of iPad 2 use a SIM card while CDMA models use an <unk> to connect to the cellular network . 
 The device is 15 % lighter and 33 % thinner than the original iPad ; it is thinner than the iPhone 4 by 0 @.@ 5 mm . The Wi @-@ Fi version is 1 @.@ 33 lb ( 600 g ) . Both the GSM and CDMA versions ( known respectively as the AT & T and Verizon versions in the US ) differ in weight slightly due to the mass difference between the GSM and CDMA cellular radios , with the GSM model at 1 @.@ 35 lb ( 612 g ) and the CDMA model at 1 @.@ 34 lb ( 608 g ) . The size of the iPad 2 is also less than the original iPad at only 9 @.@ 50 × 7 @.@ 31 × 0 @.@ 34 in ( 241 @.@ 2 × 185 @.@ 7 × 8 @.@ 8 mm ) , compared to the original iPad 's size at 9 @.@ 56 × 7 @.@ 47 × 0 @.@ 5 in ( 242 @.@ 8 × 189 @.@ 7 × 13 @.@ 4 mm ) . 
 After the announcement and release of the third generation iPad , the iPad 2 , which continued to be available for purchase , received a hardware upgrade . The upgraded variant of the iPad 2 features a smaller version of the Apple A5 SoC , which is able to reduce battery consumption . Benchmark tests conducted by Anandtech concluded that the upgraded variant is able to last longer by at least an hour and a half , depending on the task that is conducted on the device . The maximum temperature that the device heated up to was also less than original iPad 2 , tests conducted by the same organisation revealed that the upgraded variant was able to operate at 1 degree lower when performing intensive tasks . Performance difference between the two variants , according to Anandtech is negligible .

 The Smart Cover , first introduced with the iPad 2 , is a screen protector that magnetically attaches to the face of the iPad . The cover has three folds which allow it to convert into a stand , which is also held together by magnets . While original iPad owners could purchase a black case that included a similarly folding cover , the Smart Cover is meant to be more minimal , easily detachable , and protects only the screen . Smart Covers have a microfiber bottom that cleans the front of the iPad , and wakes up the iPad when the cover is removed . There are five different colors of both polyurethane and leather , with leather being more expensive than the polyurethane version . 
 Apple offers several more accessories for the iPad 2 , most of which are adapters for the proprietary 30 @-@ pin dock connector , the iPad 's only port besides the headphone jack . A dock holds the iPad upright at an angle , and has a dock connector and audio line out port . The iPad can use Bluetooth keyboards that also work with Macs and PCs . The iPad can be charged by a standalone power adapter ( " wall charger " ) also used for iPods and iPhones , and a 10 W charger is included with the iPad .

 The iPad 2 received mixed to positive reviews , praising its Apple A5 processor and 720p camera . Joshua Topolsky of Engadget said that " for those of you who haven 't yet made the leap , feel free to take a deep breath and dive in -- the iPad 2 is as good as it gets right now . And it 's really quite good . " Jason Snell of Macworld said the following : 
 " Though the iPad 2 is an improvement on the original iPad in numerous ways , it ’ s still an evolutionary product , not a revolutionary one . If you ’ re happy with your current iPad , there ’ s no reason to dump it just because there ’ s a shinier , newer one . ( This is not to say that millions of people won ’ t do just that . I mean : shiny ! ) If you ’ ve invested in iPad accessories such as a dock or case , keep in mind that you probably won ’ t be able to use them with the new iPad . " 
 TechCrunch 's MG Siegler stated : " Let me sum all of this up in a simple way : the iPad 2 , should you buy one ? Maybe — it depends on a few factors . Will you want to buy one ? Yes . Use that information wisely . "

 At issue are restrictions imposed by the design of iOS , namely DRM intended to lock purchased media to Apple 's platform , the development model ( requiring a yearly subscription to distribute apps developed for the iOS ) , the centralized approval process for apps , as well as Apple 's general control and lockdown of the platform itself . Particularly at issue is the ability for Apple to remotely disable or delete apps at will . Some in the tech community have expressed concern that the locked @-@ down iOS represents a growing trend in Apple 's approach to computing , particularly Apple 's shift away from machines that hobbyists can " tinker with " and note the potential for such restrictions to stifle software innovation . 
 Some iPad 2 users reported performance issues when running iOS 8 . Apple improved performance on the iPad 2 and the iPhone 4S on the iOS 8 @.@ 1 @.@ 1 update . However , those 2 devices still don 't run as fast as the later models .

 = New York State Route 8 = 
 New York State Route 8 ( NY 8 ) is a north @-@ south state highway in the central part of New York in the United States . It runs in a southwest @-@ to @-@ northeast direction from the Southern Tier to the northern part of Lake George . The southern terminus of the route is at an interchange with NY 17 in the town of Deposit , where it begins concurrent with NY 10 . Its northern terminus is at a junction with NY 9N in the town of Hague . Roughly midway between the two endpoints , NY 8 passes through Utica , where it overlaps NY 5 , NY 12 , and Interstate 790 ( I @-@ 790 ) along one segment of the North – South Arterial . 
 NY 8 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and originally extended north to a ferry across Lake Champlain at Putnam Station , where it connected to Vermont Route F @-@ 10 ( VT F @-@ 10 ) . The route was realigned slightly on its northern end by 1933 to connect to another ferry leading to VT F @-@ 9 east of Ticonderoga . By the following year , it was altered again to use the new Champlain Bridge at Crown Point to connect to VT 17 . This was made possible by way of a long concurrency with NY 9N and NY 22 . NY 8 was truncated to its current northern terminus c . 1968 . In the 1960s and 1970s , NY 8 was moved onto new freeways around and through the city of Utica .

 NY 8 begins at an interchange with NY 17 in Deposit that also serves as the southern terminus of NY 10 . NY 8 and NY 10 form a brief concurrency north along the West Branch of the Delaware River before separating at the southeastern edge of the Cannonsville Reservoir northeast of Deposit . While NY 10 follows the southern edge of the reservoir to the east , NY 8 continues north , passing to the east of Oquaga Creek State Park ( and connecting to the park via a pair of local roads ) before meeting NY 206 in Masonville . From Masonville , NY 8 heads north to Sidney , where it meets I @-@ 88 at an interchange , crosses the Susquehanna River , and intersects NY 7 before leaving the village adjacent to the Unadilla River , a tributary of the Susquehanna . 
 NY 8 parallels the Unadilla River northward through Mount Upton to New Berlin , where it meets NY 80 . The routes overlap for a short distance to the north before NY 80 separates to the northwest toward Sherburne . NY 8 , however , continues along the Unadilla River through several small communities before separating from the river just south of the Madison @-@ Oneida County line .

 Shortly after crossing into Oneida County , NY 8 intersects U.S. Route 20 ( US 20 ) in Bridgewater . The route continues northward , passing through <unk> and Clayville before becoming a limited @-@ access highway just north of Clayville . Near <unk> , NY 8 has exits for Pinnacle Road and Elm Street prior to entering the Utica suburbs . In New Hartford , the route has an exit with Genesee Street prior to meeting NY 5 and NY 12 at a cloverleaf interchange southwest of downtown Utica . While the right @-@ of @-@ way of NY 8 continues to the northeast through the cloverleaf as NY 840 , NY 8 joins NY 5 and NY 12 as the three routes enter downtown on the North – South Arterial . 
 Near the northern edge of downtown , NY 5 , NY 8 , and NY 12 interchange with NY 5A and NY 5S on the southern bank of the Mohawk River . At the exit , the three state routes are joined on the arterial by I @-@ 790 , which follows NY 5 , NY 8 , and NY 12 across the Mohawk River and the neighboring Erie Canal to a large interchange north of the canal . Here , I @-@ 790 and NY 5 separate from the concurrency while NY 8 and NY 12 remain concurrent into Deerfield as a limited @-@ access highway . After an interchange with a former routing of NY 12 , NY 8 separates from the highway and returns to an at @-@ grade roadway as it heads northeast to Poland . Near the Oneida @-@ Herkimer County line ( here delimited by West Canada Creek ) , NY 8 merges with NY 28 and follows the route across the county line ( as well as the creek ) into Poland . In the center of the village , NY 8 splits from NY 28 and heads northeast into Adirondack Park .

 Within Adirondack Park , NY 8 follows a northeast – southwest routing as it crosses the lower half of the park . Near Ohio , NY 8 intersects NY 365 due north of where it enters the park . Past NY 365 , NY 8 becomes signed as an east – west highway as it heads east to Higgins Bay , where it intersects the northern terminus of NY 10 . The route continues northeast to Speculator , where it meets NY 30 . NY 30 turns east onto NY 8 , forming an overlap southeast to Wells , where NY 8 separates from NY 30 and heads to the northeast into Warren County . 
 In Wevertown , NY 8 intersects NY 28 for the final time prior to meeting US 9 at Loon Lake . The two routes merge , forming an overlap east to Chestertown , where US 9 splits from NY 8 and continues south . NY 8 , however , heads east , meeting I @-@ 87 shortly after departing US 9 . Past I @-@ 87 , NY 8 follows the southern edge of Brant Lake to the northeast before turning to the east toward Hague , where it terminates at NY 9N .

 In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , NY 8 was assigned to most of its current alignment from Deposit to Hague . The route also extended eastward to Wright ( southeast of Ticonderoga ) on modern NY 9N , NY 22 , and County Route 2 ( CR 2 ) , where it connected to VT F @-@ 10 by way of a ferry across Lake Champlain . From Clayville to Utica , NY 8 was originally routed along Oneida Street before overlapping with NY 5 and NY 12 along Genesee Street in downtown Utica . After crossing the Mohawk River and the Erie Canal , the three routes separated at the intersection of Herkimer Road , Trenton Road , and Coventry Avenue northeast of downtown . NY 8 then followed Coventry Avenue and Walker Road northeast to Deerfield , where NY 8 joined its modern alignment . 
 Prior to 1930 , what became NY 8 in the renumbering carried multiple designations along its routing . In 1924 , the segment of Genesee Street in Utica that became NY 8 was designated as part of NY 5 and NY 12 . Additionally , the portion of NY 8 from Wevertown to Chestertown became part of NY 10 . The segment from the modern intersection of US 9 and NY 8 to Chestertown was also designated as part of NY 6 . By 1926 , what became NY 8 from Sidney to New Berlin and from Bridgewater to downtown Utica was designated as NY 44 . Between New Berlin and Bridgewater , NY 44 followed what is now NY 80 through <unk> to West Burlington and NY 51 from West Burlington to US 20 . It continued west to Bridgewater by way of an overlap with US 20 . From Utica to Wells , the 1930 routing of NY 8 was part of NY 54 , which continued south from Wells to Fonda via modern NY 30 and NY 30A . Between Chestertown and Ticonderoga , NY 8 was designated NY 47 . Until the renumbering , what became NY 8 was unbuilt from Deposit to Masonville and unnumbered from Masonville to Sidney . Additionally , the segments from New Berlin to Bridgewater and from Wells to Wevertown were unnumbered . 
 NY 8 was rerouted by 1933 to exit Ticonderoga to the east , using what is now NY 74 to reach Lake Champlain instead . At the lake , NY 8 connected to VT F @-@ 9 via the Fort Ticonderoga – Larrabees Point Ferry . The route was realigned again c . 1934 to follow NY 9N and NY 22 north from Ticonderoga to south of Port Henry , where NY 8 turned northeast to follow what is now NY 185 to the Champlain Bridge . The route became VT 17 on the opposite lakeshore . NY 8 was truncated to Hague c . 1968 , eliminating its overlaps with NY 9N and NY 22 . 
 = = = Relocation onto expressways = = = 
 In the early 1950s , construction began on a new arterial highway — known as the North – South Arterial — through downtown Utica . The first portion of the highway to open was the segment between River Road and Trenton Road , which was completed by 1956 . It was extended southward to Oriskany Street ( NY 5A ) by 1961 and completed entirely by 1964 ; however , NY 8 was not initially realigned to follow the highway . In the mid @-@ 1960s , plans were made to construct a new limited @-@ access highway along the NY 8 corridor from Clayville north to New Hartford , where it would connect with the North – South Arterial . 
 The freeway was constructed and completed in the early 1970s . NY 8 was realigned to follow the highway to New Hartford , from where it continued through Utica on the Arterial and I @-@ 790 . It rejoined its previous alignment at I @-@ 790 's interchange with Genesee Street . During this same period , the section of NY 12 between Deerfield and South Trenton was moved onto a new freeway built adjacent to NY 12 's original alignment . A connector between NY 12 and NY 8 by way of the Miller Road corridor was built at this time . NY 8 was rerouted in the mid @-@ 1970s to follow NY 12 north to its exit with the connector . Here , NY 8 left NY 12 and continued east on the connector to rejoin its original alignment at Walker Road . Ownership and maintenance of NY 8 's former routing north of the Utica city limits was transferred to Oneida County , which designated the highway as CR 92 .

He did not feature in matchday squads for the rest of the season , and was transfer listed in May 2012 . The door to the first team remained open though , after Burge had an encouraging and injury @-@ free pre @-@ season . 
 He came off the bench on 14 August 2012 – his first competitive game for twelve months – and " pulled the strings to help Vale control the second half " in a League Cup defeat to Championship side Burnley .

 = Moberly – Jourdain incident = 
 The Moberly – Jourdain incident , or the Ghosts of Petit Trianon or Versailles ( French : les <unk> du Trianon / les <unk> de Versailles ) , refers to claims of time travel and hauntings made by Charlotte Anne Moberly ( 1846 – 1937 ) and Eleanor Jourdain ( 1863 – 1924 ) . 
 In 1911 , Moberly and Jourdain published a book entitled An Adventure under the names of " Elizabeth Morison " and " Frances Lamont " . Their book describes a visit they made to the Petit Trianon , a small château in the grounds of the Palace of Versailles where they claimed to have seen the gardens as they had been in the late eighteenth century as well as ghosts , including Marie Antoinette and others . Their story caused a sensation and was subject to much ridicule . 
 = = Background = = 
 Moberly , born in 1846 , was the tenth of fifteen children . She came from a professional background ; her father , George Moberly , was the headmaster of Winchester College and later Bishop of Salisbury . In 1886 Moberly became the first Principal of a hall of residence for young women , St. Hugh 's College in Oxford . It became apparent that Moberly needed someone to help run the college , and Jourdain was asked to become Moberly 's assistant . 
 Jourdain , born in 1863 , was the eldest of ten children . Her father , the Reverend Francis Jourdain , was the vicar of Ashbourne in Derbyshire . She was the sister of art historian Margaret Jourdain and mathematician Philip Jourdain . She went to school in Manchester , unlike most girls of the time who were educated at home . 
 Jourdain was also the author of several textbooks , ran a school of her own , and after the incident became the vice @-@ Principal of St. Hugh 's College . Before Jourdain was appointed , it was decided that the two women should get to know one another better ; Jourdain owned an apartment in Paris where she tutored English children , and so Moberly went to stay with her . 
 = = Claims = = 
 According to Moberly and Jourdain , the two women decided to visit the Palace of Versailles as part of several trips . On 10 August 1901 , they travelled by train to Versailles . They did not think much of the palace after touring it , so they decided to walk through the gardens to the Petit Trianon . On the way , they reached the Grand Trianon and found it was closed to the public . 
 They travelled with a Baedeker guidebook , but the two women soon became lost after missing the turn for the main avenue , Allée des Deux <unk> . They passed this road , and entered a lane , where unknown to them they passed their destination . Moberly noticed a woman shaking a white cloth out of a window and Jourdain noticed an old deserted farmhouse , outside of which was an old plough . 
 At this point they claimed that a feeling of oppression and dreariness came over them . They then saw some men who looked like palace gardeners , who told them to go straight on . Moberly later described the men as " very dignified officials , dressed in long greyish green coats with small three @-@ cornered hats . " Jourdain noticed a cottage with a woman and a girl in the doorway . The woman was holding out a jug to the girl . Jourdain described it as a " tableau vivant " , a living picture , much like Madame Tussauds waxworks . Moberly did not observe the cottage , but felt the atmosphere change . She wrote : " Everything suddenly looked unnatural , therefore unpleasant ; even the trees seemed to become flat and lifeless , like wood worked in tapestry . There were no effects of light and shade , and no wind stirred the trees . " 
 They reached the edge of a wood , close to the Temple de l 'Amour , and came across a man seated beside a garden kiosk , wearing a cloak and large shady hat . According to Moberly , his appearance was " most repulsive ... its expression odious . His complexion was dark and rough . " Jourdain noted " The man slowly turned his face , which was marked by smallpox ; his complexion was very dark . The expression was evil and yet <unk> , and though I did not feel that he was looking particularly at us , I felt a repugnance to going past him . A man later described as " tall ... with large dark eyes , and crisp curling black hair under a large sombrero hat " came up to them , and showed them the way to the Petit Trianon . 
 After crossing a bridge , they reached the gardens in front of the palace , and Moberly noticed a lady sketching on the grass who looked at them . She later described what she saw in great detail : the lady was wearing a light summer dress , on her head was a shady white hat , and she had lots of fair hair . Moberly thought she was a tourist at first , but the dress appeared to be old @-@ fashioned . Moberly came to believe that the lady was Marie Antoinette . Jourdain , however , did not see the lady . 
 After this , they were directed round to the entrance and joined a party of other visitors . After touring the house , they had tea at the Hotel des Reservoirs before returning to Jourdain 's apartment . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 After leaving Versailles , neither Jourdain nor Moberly mentioned the incident to one another until a week later . Moberly wrote a letter about the trip to her sister and when she got to the afternoon of the Versailles incident , she asked Jourdain if she thought the Petit Trianon was haunted . Jourdain told her that she thought it was . Three months later in Oxford , they compared their notes , then decided to write separate accounts of what happened and research the history of the Trianon . In doing so , they found that on 10 August 1792 , the Tuileries palace in Paris was besieged , the king 's Swiss guards were massacred and the monarchy itself was abolished six weeks later . 
 They visited the Trianon gardens again on several occasions , but were unable to trace the path they took . Various landmarks , such as the kiosk and the bridge , were missing and the grounds were full of people . Trying to come up with an explanation , they wondered if they had stumbled across a private party or an event booked that day . However , they found that nothing had been booked that afternoon . During their research , they thought they recognised the man by the kiosk as the Comte de Vaudreuil , a friend of Marie Antoinette , who herself had been thought to have been seen by Moberly . 
 Convinced that the grounds were haunted , they decided to publish their findings in a book An Adventure ( 1911 ) under the pseudonyms of Elizabeth Morison and Frances Lamont . The book , containing the claim that Marie Antoinette had been encountered in 1901 , caused a sensation . However , many critics did not take it seriously on the grounds of the implausibilities and inconsistencies that it was thought to contain . A review of the book in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research suggested that the women had misinterpreted normal events that they had experienced . In 1903 , an old map of the Trianon gardens was found and showed a bridge that the two women had claimed to have crossed that had not been on any other map . The identity of the authors of An Adventure was not made public until 1931 . 
 Both women are reported to have had many paranormal experiences before and after their adventure . In one of them , Moberly claimed to have seen in the Louvre in 1914 an apparition of the Roman emperor Constantine , a man of unusual height wearing a gold crown and a toga ; he was not observed by anybody else . During the First World War , Jourdain , the dominant personality of the pair who had succeeded as Principal of St. Hugh 's , became convinced that a German spy was hiding in the college . After developing increasingly autocratic behaviour , she died suddenly in 1924 in the middle of an academic scandal over her leadership of the college , her conduct having provoked mass resignations of academic staff . Moberly died in 1937 . 
 The story of the adventure was made into a TV movie , Miss Morison 's Ghosts , in 1981 . The BBC broadcast a 90 @-@ minute radio dramatization in 2004 and 2015 . 
 = = Some explanations = = 
 In addition to the explanation by the women that they had been caught up in what is now called a time slip and had observed ghosts from the past , a non @-@ supernatural explanation of the events was proposed by Philippe Jullian in his 1965 biography of the aristocratic decadent French poet Robert de Montesquiou . At the time of Moberly and Jourdain 's excursion to Versailles , Montesquiou lived nearby and reportedly gave parties in the grounds where his friends dressed in period costume and performed tableaux vivants as part of the party entertainments . Moberly and Jourdain may have inadvertently gatecrashed a gay fancy dress party . The Marie @-@ Antoinette figure could have been a society lady or a cross @-@ dresser , the pockmarked man Montesquiou himself . It was suggested that a gathering of the French decadent avant @-@ garde of the time could have made a sinister impression on the two middle @-@ class Edwardian spinsters who would have been little used to such company . 
 In a review of the history of the Moberly @-@ Jourdain adventure and the extensive public reaction to it , Terry Castle noted with skepticism the claim that a shared delusion may have arisen out of a lesbian folie à deux between the two women . Castle concludes that , when all proposed explanations have been considered , a core of mystery remains as much in relation to the psychological dynamics of the pair as to any aspects of the paranormal associated with their story . 
 Without fully endorsing the de Montesquiou explanation , Michael Coleman carefully examined the story and , in particular , the two published versions of the ladies ' accounts ( the earlier @-@ written of which , from November 1901 , had only previously been published in the second , small print @-@ run , edition of An Adventure in 1913 ) . Coleman concluded that the more widely available texts , as published in the 1911 and later editions , had been considerably embroidered well after the events described and after the ladies had begun their investigations , while the original accounts had little or nothing to suggest a supernatural experience . He also questioned the rigour and reliability of the ladies ' subsequent researches , pointing out that few , if any , of their informants are named and that most of their literary and historical references were taken from unreliable sources . 
 Brian Dunning of <unk> researched much of the evidence and concluded that " Moberly and Jourdain were simply human " and were mistaken . He notes that in the second edition of An Adventure , it is revealed that Moberly did not mention the sketching woman until three months after their visit to Versailles , while Jourdain did not remember such a thing , and that Moberly did not remember much of what Jourdain described . " It was only after much discussion , note @-@ sharing , and historical research that Moberly and Jourdain came up with the time period as 1789 and assigned identities to a few of the characters they saw , including Marie Antoinette herself as the lady sketching on the lawn . " 
 Dame Joan Evans , who owned the copyright to An Adventure , accepted the Jullian explanation and forbade any further editions . However , after the work came out of copyright , it was republished in 1988 as The Ghosts of Trianon : The Complete ' An Adventure ' by Thoth Publication and again in 2008 by CreateSpace , both times crediting Moberly and Jourdain as the authors . 
 = Stephens City , Virginia = 
 Stephens City ( / <unk> / STEE @-@ <unk> ) is an incorporated town in the southern part of Frederick County , Virginia , United States , with a population of 1 @,@ 829 at the time of the 2010 Census . In 2014 , it was estimated that the population of Stephens City had risen to 1 @,@ 921 . 
 Founded by Peter Stephens in the 1730s , the colonial town was chartered and named for Lewis Stephens in October 1758 . It was originally settled by German Protestants from Heidelberg . Stephens City is the second @-@ oldest municipality in the Shenandoah Valley after nearby Winchester , which is about 5 miles ( 8 km ) to the north . " Crossroads " , the first free black community in the Valley in the pre @-@ Civil War years , was founded east of town in the 1850s . Crossroads remained until the beginning of the Civil War when the freed blacks either escaped or were recaptured . Stephens City was saved from intentional burning in 1864 by Union Major Joseph K. Stearns . The town has gone through several name changes in its history , starting as Stephensburg , then Newtown , and finally winding up as Stephens City , though it nearly became Pantops . Interstate 81 and U.S. Route 11 pass close to and through the town , respectively . 
 A large section of the center of the town , including buildings and homes , covering 65 acres ( 26 ha ) , is part of the Newtown @-@ Stephensburg Historic District and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992 . Stephens City celebrated its 250th anniversary on October 12 , 2008 . The town is a part of the Winchester , Virginia @-@ West Virginia Metropolitan Statistical Area , an offshoot of the Washington – Baltimore – Northern Virginia , DC – MD – VA – WV Combined Statistical Area . It is a member of the Winchester – Frederick County Metropolitan Planning Organization .

 Jost Hite , a German immigrant , purchased a large land grant in the northern Shenandoah Valley in 1731 . Peter Stephens and a small party of German Protestants from Heidelberg , in the Palatinate , arrived about 1732 to buy and settle that land , including the site of what became Stephens City , named for the Stephens family . Although Hite 's title to the land was challenged by Thomas Fairfax , 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron , the land baron of the area , the matter was settled amicably . 
 Town lots were laid out beginning in 1754 , and on September 21 , 1758 , Lewis Stephens petitioned the colonial government of Virginia in Williamsburg for a town charter . The Virginia General Assembly approved the charter for the town of " <unk> " on October 12 , 1758 . The mostly German @-@ speaking residents soon left off the " h " ; the town was usually spelled " Stephensburg " . By the start of the Revolutionary War , Stephensburg was often called simply " New Town " or " Newtown " , as the new settlement on the Great Wagon Road south of Winchester . 
 Shenandoah Valley and Newtown 's central location attracted heavy traffic through the region , and wagon @-@ making emerged as an important industry for the town ; Newtown artisans supplied wagons throughout the state . By 1830 , the town 's population had reached 800 . In the late 1850s , free blacks began a settlement about a mile east of town which became known as Crossroads or Freetown , which lasted until the time of the American Civil War . After the January 1 , 1863 , Emancipation Proclamation , most of the newly freed slaves and many of the already free blacks left the area . 
 When the American Civil War broke out in 1861 , the majority of Newtown 's young men joined Confederate forces . During the war , the town was " between the lines " , nominally controlled by the Union but with much Confederate partisan activity . On May 24 , 1862 , Stonewall Jackson 's Confederate forces advanced northward on the Valley Pike and attacked Union troops . At Newtown , General George Henry Gordon of the Second Massachusetts Infantry ordered his Federal troops to make a stand . The skirmishing involved heavy artillery fire , but Gordon 's men retreated without loss of the important supply wagons . When Gordon left the town to Jackson 's forces , both sides claimed a victory . 
 In June 1864 , Major Joseph K. Stearns of the 1st New York Cavalry arrived under orders to burn the town down to help stop Confederate ambushes on the wagon road . Because the remaining population mostly consisted of women , children and the elderly , Stearns allowed the town to stand . He required the adult residents to take the " Ironclad oath " , in which they swore that they had not voluntarily provided aid to the Confederacy . The government required the oath , effectively excluding ex @-@ Confederates from the political arena during Reconstruction Era . 
 In April 1867 , the Virginia General Assembly granted a charter to the Winchester and Strasburg Railroad Company . The company was authorized to construct a rail line between Winchester and Strasburg , linking Newtown to the rest of the nation by railroad for the first time . Though the railroad improved the local economy , which had lagged after the end of the war , it decimated the wagon @-@ building trade . In 1880 , the United States Post Office Department , faced with nearly a dozen <unk> in Virginia , announced that the local post office would be renamed Pantops . Dissatisfied with the name , the townsfolk chose " Stephens City " .

 The 20th century brought improvements to energy and domestic systems : electrical service was introduced in 1915 ; and in 1941 , just before World War II , the town installed a water system . The construction of Interstate 81 ( I @-@ 81 ) during the early 1960s depressed business development in the town . The wagon road , which had been made part of U.S. Route 11 , had led traffic through the center of town , but the interstate passed less than a tenth of a mile to the east , drawing off development , retail trade and ultimately , businesses . This caused downtown to decline . Developers constructed new residential subdivisions both within and outside the town boundaries to the east for access to I @-@ 81 . 
 The town surveyed its older buildings to establish architectural significance and to determine those that contributed to the town 's historic center . The Newtown @-@ Stephensburg Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in August 1992 . Renovation of the town center has attracted heritage tourism . Anticipating more growth , the town annexed 360 acres ( 1 @.@ 5 km2 ) of unincorporated Frederick County in 2005 , another 100 acres ( 0 @.@ 4 km2 ) in 2006 , and 175 acres ( 0 @.@ 7 km2 ) in 2007 . The town celebrated its 250th anniversary on October 12 , 2008 . 
 Virginia school systems had practiced resistance following the United States Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education ( 1954 ) that segregated public schools were unconstitutional . The United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia ordered Frederick County schools desegregated ( including those serving Stephens City ) in Brown v. County School Board ( 1964 ) . In 1994 , Virgil E. Watson was elected as the first African American to serve on the Stephens City Town Council . Watson served for one term from 1994 until 1998 . 
 On September 17 , 2004 , remnants of Hurricane Ivan spawned an F1 tornado that touched down just south of the town along Interstate 81 . It caused approximately $ 1 million in damage and injured two people . It was one of a record 40 tornadoes to hit northern Virginia that day .

 Stephens City is located in the humid subtropical climate zone ( Köppen climate classification : Cfa ) , exhibiting four distinct seasons . Its climate is typical of Mid @-@ Atlantic U.S. areas removed from bodies of water . The town is located in plant hardiness zone 7 throughout the town and surrounding Frederick County , indicating a temperate climate . Spring and fall are warm , with low humidity , while winter is cool , with annual snowfall averaging 15 @.@ 0 inches ( 38 cm ) . Average winter lows tend to be around 30 ° F ( − 1 ° C ) from mid @-@ December to mid @-@ February . Blizzards affect Stephens City on average once every four to six years . The most violent nor 'easters typically feature high winds , heavy rains , and occasional snow . These storms often affect large sections of the U.S. East Coast . 
 Summers are hot and humid ; during this season , highs average in the upper 80s ° F ( lower 30s ° C ) and lows average in the upper 60s ° F ( lower 20s ° C ) . The combination of heat and humidity in the summer brings very frequent thunderstorms , some of which occasionally produce tornadoes in the area . While hurricanes ( or their remnants ) occasionally track through the area in late summer and early fall , they have often weakened by the time they reach Stephens City , partly due to the city 's far inland location . 
 The highest recorded temperature was 107 ° F ( 42 ° C ) in 1988 , while the lowest recorded temperature was − 18 ° F ( − 28 ° C ) in 1983 .

 Town residents have access to two parks within town limits : Newtown Commons and Bel Air Street Park . Newtown Commons , sometimes called Newtown Park , is located along Main Street , and the other is on Bel Air Street . At Newtown Commons , residents can hold outdoor events such as picnics , fundraisers or small concerts . The Bel Air Street Park is a playground for children with standard <unk> and other activities . 
 Just outside Stephens City is Sherando Park . The park houses several trails , ponds , a pool , sports fields and more . Sherando Park is also home of the Virginia Tech Memorial Garden , planted in memory of the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre , which took place approximately 175 miles ( 282 km ) from the park . It has " a winding sidewalk shaped in the college 's trademark ' VT ' " and " a flagpole surrounded by 32 Hokie Stones " , one for each of the 32 victims of the shooting . The Memorial Garden was dedicated and opened on April 16 , 2009 , the second anniversary of the shooting . The park was built by the Shenandoah Chapter of Virginia Tech Alumni Association , which is based in nearby Winchester , Virginia .

 In 2010 , the head of Stephens City 's government was Mayor Joy B. Shull , a former member of the Town Council , who was elected in an unopposed May 4 election , and served four years as mayor . Shull succeeded Ray E. Ewing , who had served since 1994 , and retired at the end of his term . The representative body of Stephens City is known as the Town Council , whose members ( as of November 2012 ) include Ronald Bowers , Linden A. <unk> , Jr . , James H. Harter , Joseph Hollis , Joseph Grayson and Martha W. Dilg . Dilg was elected in a May 4 , 2010 , election to succeed Michael Grim , who left the Town Council at the end of his term . Shull 's replacement on Town Council was originally to be decided at a May 5 , 2010 , Town Council meeting but was not announced until June 29 , 2010 , when Joseph Grayson was officially named to fill Shull 's seat . On November 6 , 2012 , Joseph Hollis , Joseph Grayson and Ronald Bowers were all reelected to the Stephens City Town Council . Council member James Harter resigned on December 31 , 2013 , as he had moved outside of the town limits . 
 The town council voted to appoint Jason Nauman to fill Harter 's position on February 4 , 2014 .

 The earliest organized religious services in Stephens City began in 1790s when a Methodist Episcopal church was created in the town . The first church structure , the " Methodist Episcopal Church in Stephensburg " , dates from 1791 . The current Stephens City United Methodist Church was constructed near that historic site . 
 The oldest surviving church building in the town is Orrick Chapel , built between 1866 and 1869 as the home of an African Methodist Episcopal congregation . Missionaries from this first independent black denomination came South after the war to aid freedmen and plant new congregations ; they attracted hundreds of thousands of new members . This church replaced an earlier Methodist chapel constructed in the late 1850s ; it was razed by Union troops during the winter months of 1864 – 1865 near the end of the Civil War . 
 As of 2010 , within the town limits are congregations of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and United Methodist Church as well as those of the Baptist , Mennonite , Pentecostal , Charismatic Episcopal and Full Gospel denominations of Christianity . Just south of the town limits is a Unitarian Universalist church .

 = Huia = 
 The huia ( Māori : [ <unk> ] ; Heteralocha acutirostris ) was the largest species of New Zealand wattlebird , endemic to the North Island of New Zealand . Its extinction in the early 20th century had two primary causes . The first was rampant overhunting to procure huia skins for mounted specimens , which were in worldwide demand by museums and wealthy private collectors . Huia were also hunted to obtain their long , striking tail feathers for locally fashionable hat decorations . The second major cause of extinction was the widespread deforestation of the lowlands of the North Island by European settlers to create pasture for agriculture . Most of these forests were ancient , ecologically complex primary forests , and huia were unable to survive in regenerating secondary forests . The last confirmed sighting of a huia was on 28 December 1907 in the Tararua Ranges . Further credible sightings near Wellington were reported until 1922 , and in Te Urewera National Park in the early 1960s . 
 The huia belonged to a family found only in New Zealand . Before the arrival of Europeans it was already a rare bird , confined to the Ruahine , Tararua , Rimutaka and Kaimanawa mountain ranges in the south east of the North Island . It was remarkable for having the most pronounced sexual dimorphism in bill shape of any bird species in the world . The female 's beak was long , thin and arched downward , while the male 's was short and stout , like that of a crow . Males were 45 cm ( 18 in ) long , while females were larger at 48 cm ( 19 in ) . The sexes were otherwise similar , with orange wattles and predominantly black plumage with a green sheen . The birds lived in forests at both montane and lowland elevations – they are thought to have moved seasonally , living at higher elevation in summer and descending to lower elevation in winter . Huia were omnivorous and ate adult insects , grubs and spiders , as well as the fruits of a small number of native plants . Males and females used their beaks to feed in different ways : the male used his bill to chisel away at rotting wood , while the female 's longer , more flexible bill was able to probe deeper areas . 
 Even though the huia is frequently mentioned in biology and ornithology textbooks because of this striking dimorphism , not much is known about its biology ; it was little studied before it was driven to extinction . The huia is one of New Zealand 's best @-@ known extinct birds because of its bill shape , its sheer beauty and special place in Māori culture and oral tradition . The bird was regarded by Māori as tapu ( sacred ) , and the wearing of its skin or feathers was reserved for people of high status . The huia was a bird of deep metallic , bluish @-@ black plumage with a greenish iridescence on the upper surface , especially about the head . The tail feathers were unique among endemic birds in having a broad white band across the tips . 
 = = Taxonomy and etymology = = 
 The genus name , Heteralocha , derives from Ancient Greek <unk> " different " and <unk> " wife " . It refers to the striking difference in bill shape between male and female . The specific name , acutirostris , derives from Latin acutus , meaning " sharp pointed " , and rostrum , meaning " beak " , and refers to the beak of the female . 
 John Gould described the huia in 1836 as two species : Neomorpha acutirostris based on a female specimen , and N. crassirostris based on a male specimen — the epithet crassirostris derives from the Latin <unk> , meaning " thick " or " heavy " , and refers to the male 's short bill . In 1840 , George Robert Gray proposed the name N. gouldii , arguing that neither of Gould 's names was applicable to the species . In 1850 , Jean Cabanis replaced the name Neomorpha , which had been previously used for a cuckoo genus , with Heteralocha . In 1888 Sir Walter Buller wrote : " I have deemed it more in accordance with the accepted rules of zoological nomenclature to adopt the first of the two names applied to the species by Mr Gould ; and the name Neomorpha having been previously used in ornithology , it becomes necessary to adopt that of Heteralocha , proposed by Dr Cabanis for this form . " 
 The huia appears to be a remnant of an early expansion of passerines in the country of New Zealand , and is the largest of the three members of the family <unk> , the New Zealand wattlebirds ; the others are the saddleback and the kōkako . The only close relative to the family is the <unk> ; their taxonomic relationships to other birds remain to be determined . A molecular study of the nuclear RAG @-@ 1 and c @-@ mos genes of the three species within the family proved inconclusive , the data providing most support for either a basally diverging kōkako or huia . 
 = = Description = = 
 The huia had black plumage with a green metallic tinge and distinctive rounded bright orange wattles at the gape . In both sexes , the eyes were brown ; the beak was ivory white , greyish at the base ; the legs and feet were long and bluish grey while the claws were light brown . Huia had twelve long glossy black tail feathers , each tipped for 2 @.@ 5 – 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 98 – 1 @.@ 18 in ) with a broad band of white . Immature huia had small pale wattles , duller plumage flecked with brown , and a reddish @-@ buff tinge to the white tips of the tail feathers . The beak of the young female was only slightly curved . Māori referred to certain huia as huia @-@ ariki , " chiefly huia " . The huia @-@ ariki had brownish plumage streaked with grey , and the feathers on the neck and head were darker . This variant may have been a partial albino , or perhaps such birds were simply of great age . Several true albino huia were recorded . A white specimen painted by John Gerrard Keulemans around 1900 may have been the result of progressive greying , leucism or <unk> , rather than albinism ; the current whereabouts of this specimen are unknown . 
 Although sexual dimorphism in bill shape is found in other birds , such as the <unk> , <unk> and other wood @-@ excavating birds including some species of woodpecker , it was most pronounced in the huia . The beak of the male was short at approximately 60 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) and slightly arched downwards and robust , very similar to that of the closely related saddleback , while the female 's beak was finer , longer at around 104 mm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) , and decurved ( curved downward ) like that of a hummingbird or honeyeater . The difference was not only in the bone ; the rhamphotheca grew way past the end of the bony maxilla and mandible to produce a pliable implement able to deeply penetrate holes made by wood @-@ boring beetle larvae . The skulls and mandibles of the huia and saddleback are very similar , the latter essentially miniatures of the former . 
 There are two possible explanations for the evolution of this sexual difference in bill shape . The most widely supported is that it allowed birds of different sexes to utilise different food sources . This divergence may have arisen because of a lack of competitors in these foraging niches in the North Island forest ecosystems . The other idea is that the ivory @-@ coloured bill , which contrasted sharply with the bird 's black plumage , may have been used to attract a mate . In animals that use sexually dimorphic physical traits to attract a mate , the dimorphic feature is often brightly coloured or contrasts with the rest of the body , as with the huia . It has been suggested that as the female was the main provider of food for the chicks by regurgitation , this sex evolved the longer bill to obtain the protein @-@ rich invertebrate diet required for the chicks . 
 Another , less obvious aspect of the huia 's sexual dimorphism was the minor size difference between the sexes . Males were 45 cm ( 18 in ) long , while females were larger at 48 cm ( 19 in ) . Additionally , the tail of the male was about 20 cm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) in length and the wingspan was between 21 and 22 cm ( 8 @.@ 3 and 8 @.@ 7 in ) , while the female 's tail was 19 @.@ 5 to 20 cm ( 7 @.@ 7 to 7 @.@ 9 in ) and the female 's wingspan was 20 to 20 @.@ 5 cm ( 7 @.@ 9 to 8 @.@ 1 in ) . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Subfossil deposits and midden remains suggest that the huia was once widespread in both lowland and montane native forest throughout the North Island , extending from the northernmost tip at Cape <unk> to Wellington and the Aorangi Range in the far south . Only a few huia are known from the extensive pitfall deposits in the karst of the <unk> Caves area and they are also rare or absent in fossil deposits in the central North Island and Hawke 's Bay ; it seems to have preferred habitats that are not well sampled by the deposits known at present . Its range appears to have contracted following Māori settlement in the middle 12th century . By the time of European settlement in the 1840s , the bird was found only in the forests of the southern North Island , south of a line from the <unk> Range in the east , across the Kaimanawa Range , to the Turakina River in the <unk> in the west . In the south , its range extended to the Wairarapa and the Rimutaka Range east of Wellington . Reports collected by Walter Buller and a single <unk> ( Māori song ) suggest that the huia was once also found in the Marlborough and Nelson districts of the South Island ; however , it has never been identified in the rich fossil deposits south of Cook Strait , and there is no other evidence of the species ' presence . 
 The huia inhabited both of the two principal forest types in New Zealand . They were primarily found in broadleaf @-@ podocarp forests where there was a dense understorey , but occasionally also in southern beech ( Nothofagus ) forest . The species was observed in native vegetation including <unk> ( <unk> taxifolia ) , rimu ( Dacrydium <unk> ) , kahikatea ( <unk> <unk> ) , northern rātā ( Metrosideros robusta ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( Elaeocarpus dentatus ) , totara ( Podocarpus totara ) , <unk> ( <unk> excelsa ) , <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , and <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , and at sea level in <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) trees at Cape <unk> . It was never seen in burnt forest or land cleared for farming . 
 = = Ecology and behaviour = = 
 = = = Movements = = = 
 The huia 's movements are little known , but it was most likely sedentary . The huia is thought to have undertaken seasonal movements , living in montane forests in the summer and moving down into lowland forests in the winter to avoid the harsher weather and cold temperatures of higher altitudes . Like the surviving New Zealand wattlebirds , the saddleback and the kōkako , the huia was a weak flier and could only fly for short distances , and seldom above tree height . More often it would use its powerful legs to propel it in long leaps and bounds through the canopy or across the forest floor , or it would cling vertically to tree trunks with its tail spread for balance . 
 = = = Feeding and ecology = = = 
 The huia , with the previously endangered saddleback , were the two species of classic bark and wood <unk> in the arboreal insectivore guild in the New Zealand avifauna . Woodpeckers do not occur east of Wallace 's line ; their ecological niche is filled by other groups of birds that feed on wood @-@ boring beetle larvae , albeit in rotting wood . The woodpecker @-@ like role was taken on by two species in two different families in the New Zealand mixed @-@ podocarp and Nothofagus forests ; one was the huia and the other was the kaka . 
 The huia foraged mainly on decaying wood . Although it was considered a specialist predator of the larvae of the nocturnal <unk> beetle ( <unk> reticularis ) , it also ate other insects — including weta — insect larvae , spiders , and fruit . 
 Insects and spiders were taken from decaying wood , from under bark , mosses and lichens , and from the ground . Huia foraged either alone , in pairs , or in small flocks of up to five , which were probably family groups . The sexual dimorphism of the bill structure gave rise to feeding strategies that differed radically between the sexes . The male used its adze @-@ like bill to chisel and rip into the outer layers of decaying wood , while the female probed areas inaccessible to the male , such as the burrows of insect larvae in living wood . The male had well @-@ developed cranial musculature allowing rotten wood to be chiselled and pried apart by " gaping " motions . There are corresponding differences in the structure and musculature of the head and neck between males and females . Huia had very well developed depressor jaw muscles , and an occipital crest that provided extra surface for muscle attachment , allowing the jaw to be opened with considerable force . Once the bird had secured a meal , it flew to a perch with the insect in its feet . The huia stripped its meal of any hard parts , then tossed the remainder up , caught , and swallowed it . 
 Pairs did not cooperate in feeding , at least not in a strict sense . All such reports are based on misunderstanding of an account by ornithologist Walter Buller of a pair kept in captivity obtaining wood @-@ boring beetle larvae . According to this misunderstanding , which has become part of ecological folklore , the male would tear at the wood and open larval tunnels , thus allowing the female to probe deeply into the tunnels with her long , pliant bill . Rather , the divergent bills represent an extreme example of niche differentiation , reducing intraspecific competition between the sexes . This allowed the species to exploit a wide range of food sources in different microhabitats . 
 The New Zealand forest relies heavily on frugivorous birds for seed dispersal : about 70 % of the woody plants have fruits that are probably dispersed by birds , which included the huia . The range of fruits eaten by the huia is difficult to establish : <unk> ( Elaeocarpus dentatus ) , <unk> ( <unk> arborea ) and various species of Coprosma are recorded by Buller , and they were also recorded as eating the fruits of kahikatea ( <unk> <unk> ) . The extinction of the huia and other frugivorous New Zealand bird species including the moa and piopio , and the diminishing range of many others , including the kiwi , weka , and kōkako , has left few effective seed dispersers in the New Zealand forest . For plants with fruit greater than 1 cm in diameter , <unk> are the sole remaining dispersers in the ecosystem , and they are rare or extinct in some areas . This depletion of avifauna in the forest ecosystem may be having major impacts on processes such as forest regeneration and seed dispersal .

 Like so many other aspects of its biology , the vocalisations of the huia are not well known , and present knowledge is based on very few accounts . The calls were mostly a varied array of whistles , " peculiar and strange " , but also " soft , melodious and flute @-@ like " . An imitation of the bird 's call survives as a recording of 1909 huia search team member Henare <unk> whistling the call ( see External links ) . Huia were often silent . When they did vocalise , their calls could carry considerable distances – some were audible from up to 400 m ( 1 @,@ 300 ft ) away through dense forest . The calls were said to differ between sexes , though there are no details . Calls were given with the bird 's head and neck stretched outward and its bill pointing 30 to 45 degrees from the vertical . Most references describe huia calls as heard in the early morning ; one records it as the first bird to sing in the dawn chorus , and captive birds were known to " wake the household " . Like the whitehead , huia behaved unusually before the onset of wet weather , being " happy and in full song " . The bird 's name is onomatopoeic : it was named by Māori for its loud distress call , a smooth , <unk> whistle rendered as uia , uia , uia or where are you ? . This call was said to be given when the bird was excited or hungry . Chicks had a " plaintive cry , pleasant to the ear " , would feebly answer imitations by people , and were very noisy when kept in tents . 
 = = = Commensals and parasites = = = 
 A species of parasitic <unk> louse , <unk> extinctus , was only known to live on the huia , and apparently became extinct with its host . In 2008 , a new species of feather mite , <unk> <unk> , was described from dried corpses found in the feathers of a huia skin held by a European museum . While the genus <unk> has a wide range of hosts globally , the presence of a representative of the genus on a passerine bird was an " enigmatic phenomenon " . The discoverers suggested the mite could have been horizontally transferred from one of the two native , migratory species of cuckoo ( <unk> ) . 
 = = Social behaviour and reproduction = = 
 A quiet , social bird , the huia was monogamous , and pairs probably paired for life . The bird was usually found in breeding pairs , although sometimes groups of four or more were encountered . Walter Buller records that a tame pair would always keep close to each other , constantly uttering a " low affectionate twitter " , even when in captivity . There are records of this same pair and a further , wild pair " hopping from branch to branch and fanning their tails , then meeting to caress each other with their bills " and uttering these noises . The male is said to have fed the female in courtship . It is thought that these behaviours may have been a sexual display . The claim that the male fed the female while she was incubating and on the nest " lacks evidence " . When the male of this captive pair was accidentally killed , the female " manifesting the utmost distress pined for her mate and died 10 days afterwards " . A Māori man in the 19th century recalled : " I was always told by my old people that a pair of huia lived on most affectionate terms ... If the male died first , the female died soon after of grief " . The huia had no fear of people ; females allowed themselves to be handled on the nest , and birds could easily be captured by hand . 
 Little is known about the huia 's reproduction , as only two eggs and four nests were ever described . The only known huia egg to still exist is in the collection of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa . The breeding season for mating , building nests , laying eggs and raising young is thought to have been late spring ( October – November ) . It is thought they nested solitarily ; pairs are said to have been territorial and the birds would remain on their territories for life . Huia appear to have raised just one brood per season ; the number of eggs in a clutch is variously described as being 3 – 5 @,@ 4 @,@ 2 – 4 and 1 – 4 . These eggs were greyish with purple and brown speckles , and measured 45 by 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 8 by 1 @.@ 2 in ) . Incubation was mostly by the female , though there is evidence that the male also had a small role , as rubbed @-@ bare brooding patches that were smaller than those of females were discovered on some males in November . The incubation period is unknown . <unk> were apparently removed from the nest by adults . The brood size was usually one or two , though there was the odd record of up to three chicks in a single nest . Nests were constructed in varying places : in dead trees , the crooks of large branches , tree hollows , on branches , or " on or near the ground " , and some nests were covered with hanging vegetation or vines . The nest itself was a large saucer @-@ shaped structure , up to 350 mm in diameter and 70 mm deep , with thick walls of dry grass , leaves and " withered stems of herbaceous plants " . A central small , shallow cup of soft materials such as grass and fine twigs cushioned and insulated the eggs . After hatching , young remained in the family group and were fed by the adults for three months , by which time they appeared adult .

 = = = In culture = = = 
 In Māori culture , the " white heron and the Huia were not normally eaten but were rare birds treasured for their precious plumes , worn by people of high rank " . The bold and inquisitive nature of the huia made it particularly easy to capture . Māori attracted the huia by imitating its call and then captured it with a tari ( a carved pole with a noose at the end ) or snare , or killed it with clubs or long spears . Often they exploited the strong pair bond by capturing one of a pair , which would then call out , attracting its mate , which could be easily captured . Opinion on the quality of huia meat as food varied wildly ; although not usually hunted for this purpose , the huia was considered " good eating " in pies or curried stew by some , but a " tough morsel " and " unfit to eat " by others . 
 Although the huia 's range was restricted to the southern North Island , its tail feathers were valued highly and were exchanged among tribes for other valuable goods such as <unk> and shark teeth , or given as tokens of friendship and respect . Through this trade , the feathers reached the far north and the far south of New Zealand . They were stored in intricately carved boxes called waka huia , which were hung from the ceilings of chiefs ' houses . Huia feathers were worn at funerals and used to decorate the heads of the deceased . The <unk> , described by Edward Robert <unk> as an " ancient war @-@ plume " , consisted of twelve huia feathers . The highly valued <unk> was an ornament made from the skin of the huia : the bird was skinned with the beak , skull and wattles attached and the legs and wings removed , carefully dried , and the resulting ornament worn from the neck or ears . Dried huia heads were also worn as pendants called <unk> huia . A captured huia would be kept in a small cage so that its tail feathers could be plucked as they grew to full size . 
 The bird was also kept by Māori as a pet , and like the tui , it could be trained to say a few words . There is also a record of a tame huia kept by European settlers in a small village in the Forty @-@ Mile Bush in the 19th century . 
 New Zealand has released several postage stamps portraying the huia , and the New Zealand sixpence circulated from 1933 to 1966 featured a female huia on the reverse . 
 The degree to which the huia was known and admired in New Zealand is reflected in the large number of suburban and geographical features which are named after the species . There are several roads and streets named after the huia in the North Island , with several in Wellington ( including Huia Road in Days Bay – not far from where one of the last sightings of this species occurred in the early 1920s in the forests of East Harbour Regional Park ) and also in Auckland , where there is even a Huia suburb in <unk> . A river on the west coast of the South Island and the <unk> Ranges in the central North Island are also named after the bird . The species was once found living in great abundance in the forests of these mountains : <unk> means " a hundred huia " . Businesses include the public swimming pool in Lower Hutt , a Marlborough winery , and Huia Publishers , which specialises in Māori writing and perspectives . The name was first given to a child in the late 19th century , to the son of members of a lower North Island iwi concerned about the bird 's rapid decline , and although uncommon , it is still used today in New Zealand as a name for girls and more rarely for boys ( e.g. Huia Edmonds ) , of both European and Māori descent . 
 Tail feathers of the extinct huia are very rare and they have become a collectors ' item . In June 2010 a single huia tail feather sold at auction in Auckland for NZ $ 8 @,@ 000 , much higher than the $ 500 the auctioneers had expected , making it the most expensive feather ever . The previous record price for a single feather was $ <unk> ( NZ $ 4 @,@ 000 ) achieved by a bald eagle feather at auction in the United States . 
 In the 2016 New Zealand film Hunt for the <unk> two of the characters encounter a huia , and eventually set out to obtain proof of their siting . 
 = = = Extinction = = = 
 The huia was found throughout the North Island before humans arrived in New Zealand . The Māori are estimated to have arrived around 800 years ago , and by the arrival of European settlers in the 1840s , habitat destruction and hunting had reduced the bird 's range to the southern North Island . However , Māori hunting pressures on the huia were limited to some extent by traditional protocols . The hunting season was from May to July when the bird 's plumage was in prime condition , while a <unk> ( hunting ban ) was enforced in spring and summer . It was not until European settlement that the huia 's numbers began to decline severely , due mainly to two well @-@ documented factors : widespread deforestation and over hunting . 
 Like the extinctions of other New Zealand birds such as the piopio in the 19th century , the decline of the huia was poorly studied . Massive deforestation occurred in the North Island at this time , particularly in the lowlands of southern Hawkes Bay , the Manawatu and the Wairarapa , as land was cleared by European settlers for agriculture . The huia was particularly vulnerable to this as it could only live in old @-@ growth forest where there were abundant rotting trees filled with wood @-@ boring insect larvae . It seems it could not survive in regenerating , secondary forests . Although the mountainous part of its former range was not deforested , the lowland forests of the valleys below were systematically destroyed . The destruction of this part of its habitat would have undoubtedly had a severe impact on huia populations , but its removal would have been particularly dire if they did in fact descend to the lowlands as a winter refuge to escape snow at higher altitudes as some researchers including Oliver have surmised . 
 It appears that predation by invasive mammalian species including ship rats , cats , and mustelids was an additional factor in the decline in huia numbers – introduction of these animals by New Zealand acclimatisation societies peaked in the 1880s and coincided with a particularly sharp decline in huia populations . Because it spent a lot of time on the ground , the huia would have been particularly vulnerable to mammalian predators . Another hypothetical cause of extinction is exotic parasites and disease introduced from Asia with the common myna . 
 Habitat destruction and the predations of introduced species were problems faced by all New Zealand birds , but in addition the huia faced massive pressure from hunting . Due to its pronounced sexual dimorphism and its beauty , huia were sought after as mounted specimens by wealthy collectors in Europe and by museums all over the world . These individuals and institutions were willing to pay large sums of money for good specimens , and the overseas demand created a strong financial incentive for hunters in New Zealand . This hunting was initially by naturalists . Austrian taxidermist Andreas <unk> took 212 pairs as specimens for the natural history museum in Vienna over a period of 10 years , while New Zealand ornithologist Walter Buller collected 18 on just one of several expeditions to the Rimutaka Ranges in 1883 . Others keen to profit soon joined in . Buller records that also in 1883 , a party of 11 Māori obtained 646 huia skins from the forest between the Manawatu Gorge and <unk> . Several thousand huia were exported overseas as part of this trade . Infrastructure development within lowland forest did not help the situation : hundreds of huia were shot around road and rail construction camps . 
 While we were looking at and admiring this little picture of bird @-@ life , a pair of Huia , without uttering a sound , appeared in a tree overhead , and as they were caressing each other with their beautiful bills , a charge of No. 6 brought them both to the ground together . The incident was rather touching and I felt almost glad that the shot was not mine , although by no means loth to appropriate 2 fine specimens . 
 The rampant and unsustainable hunting was not just financially motivated : it also had a more philosophical , fatalistic aspect . The conventional wisdom among New Zealand Europeans in the 19th century was that things colonial , whether they were plants , animals or people , were inferior to things European . It was widely assumed that the plants and animals of New Zealand 's forest ecosystems would be quickly replaced by more vigorous and competitive European species . This assumption of inevitable doom led to a conclusion that the conservation of native biota was pointless and futile ; Victorian collectors instead focused their efforts on acquiring a good range of specimens before the rare species disappeared altogether . 
 There were some attempts to conserve the huia , but they were few , poorly organised and poorly enforced legally : the conservation movement in New Zealand was still very much in its infancy . There were successive sharp declines in numbers of huia in the 1860s and in the late 1880s , prompting the chiefs of the Manawatu and the Wairarapa to place a <unk> on the Tararua Range . In February 1892 , the Wild Birds Protection Act was amended to include the huia , making it illegal to kill the bird , but enforcement was not taken seriously . Island sanctuaries were set up for endangered native birds after this act , but the new bird sanctuaries , including Kapiti Island , Little Barrier Island and Resolution Island , were never stocked with huia . Although attempts were made to capture birds for transfer , no huia were ever transferred . The Kapiti Island attempt is documented as being particularly poorly managed . A live pair destined to be transferred to the island in 1893 was instead appropriated by Buller , who bent the law to take them back to England as a present for Lord Rothschild , along with the last collected live pair of laughing owls . 
 The Duke and Duchess of York ( later George V and Queen Mary ) visited New Zealand in 1901 . At an official Māori welcome in Rotorua , a guide took a huia tail feather from her hair and placed it in the band of the Duke 's hat as a token of respect . Many people in England and New Zealand wanted to emulate this royal fashion and wear huia feathers in their hats . The price of tail feathers was soon pushed to £ 1 , making each bird worth £ 12 , and some feathers sold for as much as £ 5 . Female huia beaks were also set in gold as jewellery . Shooting season notices ceased listing the huia as a protected species in 1901 , and a last @-@ ditch attempt to reinforce government protection failed when the solicitor general ruled that there was no law to protect feathers . 
 The decline of the huia over the southern half of the North Island occurred at markedly different rates in different locations . Areas where dramatic declines were observed in the 1880s included the <unk> Range , the Hutt Valley and <unk> , and the <unk> @-@ Dannevirke area . The species was abundant in a few places in the early 20th century between Hawke 's Bay and the Wairarapa ; a flock of 100 – 150 birds was reported at the summit of the <unk> @-@ Waikane track in 1905 ; they were still " fairly plentiful " in the upper reaches of the <unk> River in 1906 – and yet , the last confirmed sighting came just one year later . 
 The last official , confirmed huia sighting was made on 28 December 1907 when W. W. Smith saw three birds in the forests of the Tararua Ranges . Unconfirmed , " quite credible " reports suggest that extinction for the species came a little later . A man familiar with the species reported seeing three huia in <unk> Valley behind York Bay ( between <unk> and Eastbourne on Wellington Harbour ) , an area of mixed beech and podocarp forest well within the bird 's former range , on 28 December 1922 . Sightings of the huia were also reported there in 1912 and 1913 . Despite this , naturalists from the Dominion Museum in Wellington did not investigate the reports . The last credible reports of huia come from the forests of Te Urewera National Park , with one from near Mt <unk> in 1952 and final sightings near Lake <unk> in 1961 and 1963 . The possibility of a small huia population still surviving in the Urewera ranges has been proposed by some researchers , but is considered highly unlikely . No recent expeditions have been mounted to find a living specimen . 
 Students at Hastings Boys ' High School organised a conference in 1999 to consider cloning the huia , their school emblem . The tribe Ngāti Huia agreed in principle to support the endeavour , which would be carried out at the University of Otago , and a California @-@ based Internet start @-@ up volunteered $ 100 @,@ 000 of funding . However , Sandy Bartle , curator of birds at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa , said that the complete huia genome could not be derived from museum skins because of the poor state of the DNA , and cloning was therefore unlikely to succeed . 
 = Margaret Murray = 
 Margaret Alice Murray ( 13 July 1863 – 13 November 1963 ) was an Anglo @-@ Indian Egyptologist , archaeologist , anthropologist , historian , and folklorist . The first woman to be appointed as a lecturer in archaeology in the United Kingdom , she worked at University College London ( UCL ) from 1898 to 1935 . She served as President of the Folklore Society from 1953 to 1955 , and published widely over the course of her career . 
 Born to a wealthy middle @-@ class English family in Calcutta , British India , Murray divided her youth between India , Britain , and Germany , training as both a nurse and a social worker . Moving to London , in 1894 she began studying Egyptology at UCL , developing a friendship with department head Flinders Petrie , who encouraged her early academic publications and appointed her Junior Professor in 1898 . In 1902 – 03 she took part in Petrie 's excavations at Abydos , Egypt , there discovering the Osireion temple and the following season investigated the Saqqara cemetery , both of which established her reputation in Egyptology . Supplementing her UCL wage by giving public classes and lectures at the British Museum and Manchester Museum , it was at the latter in 1908 that she led the unwrapping of Khnum @-@ nakht , one of the mummies recovered from the Tomb of the Two Brothers – the first time that a woman had publicly unwrapped a mummy . Recognising that British Egyptomania reflected the existence of a widespread public interest in Ancient Egypt , Murray wrote several books on Egyptology targeted at a general audience . 
 Murray also became closely involved in the first @-@ wave feminist movement , joining the Women 's Social and Political Union and devoting much time to improving women 's status at UCL . Unable to return to Egypt due to the First World War , she focused her research on the witch @-@ cult hypothesis , the theory that the witch trials of Early Modern Christendom were an attempt to extinguish a surviving pre @-@ Christian , pagan religion devoted to a Horned God . Although later academically discredited , the theory gained widespread attention and proved a significant influence on the emerging new religious movement of Wicca . From 1921 to 1931 Murray undertook excavations of prehistoric sites on Malta and Minorca and developed her interest in folkloristics . Awarded an honorary doctorate in 1927 , she was appointed assistant professor in 1928 and retired from UCL in 1935 . That year she visited Palestine to aid Petrie 's excavation of Tall al @-@ Ajjul and in 1937 she led a small excavation at Petra in Jordan . Taking on the presidency of the Folklore Society in later life , she lectured at such institutions as the University of Cambridge and City Literary Institute , and continued to publish in an independent capacity until her death . 
 Murray 's work in Egyptology and archaeology was widely acclaimed and earned her the moniker of " The Grand Old Woman of Egyptology " , although after her death many of her contributions to the field were overshadowed by those of Petrie . Conversely , Murray 's work in folkloristics and the history of witchcraft has been academically discredited and her methods in these areas heavily criticised . The influence of her witch @-@ cult theory in both religion and literature has been examined by various scholars , and she herself has been dubbed the " Grandmother of Wicca " .

 Margaret Murray was born on 13 July 1863 in Calcutta , Bengal Presidency , then a major military city in British India . A member of the wealthy British imperial elite , she lived in the city with her family : parents James and Margaret Murray , an older sister named Mary , and her paternal grandmother and great @-@ grandmother . James Murray , born in India of English descent , was a businessman and manager of the Serampore paper mills who was thrice elected President of the Calcutta Chamber of Commerce . His wife , Margaret ( née Carr ) , had moved to India from Britain in 1857 to work as a missionary , preaching Christianity and educating Indian women . She continued with this work after marrying James and giving birth to her two daughters . Although most of their lives were spent in the European area of Calcutta , which was walled off from the indigenous sectors of the city , Murray encountered members of indigenous society through her family 's employment of 10 Indian servants and through childhood holidays to Mussoorie . The historian Amara Thornton has suggested that Murray 's Indian childhood continued to exert an influence over her throughout her life , expressing the view that Murray could be seen as having a hybrid transnational identity that was both British and Indian . During her childhood , Murray never received a formal education , and in later life expressed pride in the fact that she had never had to sit an exam before entering university . 
 In 1870 , Margaret and her sister Mary were sent to Britain , there moving in with their uncle John , a vicar , and his wife Harriet at their home in Lambourn , Berkshire . Although John provided them with a strongly Christian education and a belief in the inferiority of women , both of which she would reject , he awakened Murray 's interest in archaeology through taking her to see local monuments . In 1873 , the girls ' mother arrived in Europe and took them with her to Bonn in Germany , where they both became fluent in German . In 1875 they returned to Calcutta , staying there till 1877 . They then moved with their parents back to England , where they settled in Sydenham , South London . There , they spent much time visiting The Crystal Palace , while their father worked at his firm 's London office . In 1880 , they returned to Calcutta , where Margaret remained for the next seven years . She became a nurse at the Calcutta General Hospital , which was run by the Sisters of the Anglican Sisterhood of Clower , and there was involved with the hospital 's attempts to deal with a cholera outbreak . In 1887 , she returned to England , moving to Rugby , Warwickshire , where her uncle John had moved , now widowed . Here she took up employment as a social worker dealing with local underprivileged people . When her father retired and moved to England , she moved into his house in Bushey Heath , Hertfordshire , living with him until his death in 1891 . In 1893 she then travelled to Madras , Tamil Nadu , where her sister had moved to with her new husband .

 Encouraged by her mother and sister , Murray decided to enroll at the newly opened department of Egyptology at University College London ( UCL ) in Bloomsbury , Central London . Having been founded by an endowment from Amelia Blanford Edwards , one of the co @-@ founders of the Egypt Exploration Fund ( EEF ) , the department was run by the pioneering early archaeologist Sir William Flinders Petrie , and based in the Edwards Library of UCL 's South Cloisters . Murray began her studies at UCL at age 30 in January 1894 , as part of a class composed largely of other women and older men . There , she took courses in the Ancient Egyptian and Coptic languages which were taught by Francis Llewellyn Griffith and Walter Ewing Crum respectively . 
 Murray soon got to know Petrie , becoming his copyist and illustrator and producing the drawings for the published report on his excavations at <unk> , <unk> . In turn , he aided and encouraged her to write her first research paper , " The Descent of Property in the Early Periods of Egyptian History " , which was published in the Proceedings of the Society for Biblical Archaeology in 1895 . Becoming Petrie 's de facto though unofficial assistant , Murray began to give some of the linguistic lessons in Griffith 's absence . In 1898 she was appointed to the position of Junior Lecturer , responsible for teaching the linguistic courses at the Egyptology department ; this made her the first female lecturer in archaeology in the United Kingdom . In this capacity , she spent two days a week at UCL , devoting the other days to caring for her ailing mother . As time went on , she came to teach courses on Ancient Egyptian history , religion , and language . Among Murray 's students — to whom she referred as " the Gang " — were several who went on to produce noted contributions to Egyptology , including Reginald <unk> , Georgina Aitken , Guy Brunton , and Myrtle Broome . She supplemented her UCL salary by teaching evening classes in Egyptology at the British Museum . 
 At this point , Murray had no experience in field archaeology , and so during the 1902 – 03 field season , she travelled to Egypt to join Petrie 's excavations at Abydos . Petrie and his wife , Hilda Petrie , had been excavating at the site since 1899 , having taken over the archaeological investigation from French Coptic scholar Émile Amélineau . Murray at first joined as site nurse , but was subsequently taught how to excavate by Petrie and given a senior position . This led to some issues with some of the male excavators , who disliked the idea of taking orders from a woman . This experience , coupled with discussions with other female excavators ( some of whom were active in the feminist movement ) led Murray to adopt openly feminist viewpoints . While excavating at Abydos , Murray uncovered the Osireion , a temple devoted to the god Osiris which had been constructed by order of Pharaoh Seti I during the period of the New Kingdom . She published her site report as The Osireion at Abydos in 1904 ; in the report , she examined the inscriptions that had been discovered at the site to discern the purpose and use of the building . 
 During the 1903 – 04 field season , Murray returned to Egypt , and at Petrie 's instruction began her investigations at the Saqqara cemetery near to Cairo , which dated from the period of the Old Kingdom . Murray did not have legal permission to excavate the site , and instead spent her time transcribing the inscriptions from ten of the tombs that had been excavated during the 1860s by Auguste Mariette . She published her findings in 1905 as Saqqara Mastabas I , although would not publish translations of the inscriptions until 1937 as Saqqara Mastabas II . Both The Osireion at Abydos and Saqqara Mastabas I proved to be very influential in the Egyptological community , with Petrie recognising Murray 's contribution to his own career . 
 = = = Feminism , the First World War , and folklore : 1905 – 20 = = = 
 On returning to London , Murray took an active role in the feminist movement , volunteering and financially donating to the cause and taking part in feminist demonstrations , protests , and marches . Joining the Women 's Social and Political Union , she was present at large marches like the Mud March of 1907 and the Women 's Coronation Procession of June 1911 . She concealed the militancy of her actions in order to retain the image of respectability within academia . Murray also pushed the professional boundaries for women throughout her own career , and mentored other women in archaeology and throughout academia . As women could not use the men 's common room , she successfully campaigned for UCL to open a common room for women , and later ensured that a larger , better @-@ equipped room was converted for the purpose ; it was later renamed the Margaret Murray Room . At UCL , she became a friend of fellow female lecturer Winifred Smith , and together they campaigned to improve the status and recognition of women in the university , with Murray becoming particularly annoyed at female staff who were afraid of upsetting or offending the male university establishment with their demands . Feeling that students should get nutritious yet affordable lunches , for many years she sat on the UCL Refectory Committee . 
 Various museums around the United Kingdom invited Murray to advise them on their Egyptological collections , resulting in her cataloguing the Egyptian artefacts owned by the Dublin National Museum , the National Museum of Antiquities in Edinburgh , and the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland , being elected a Fellow of the latter in thanks . Petrie had established connections with the Egyptological wing of Manchester Museum in Manchester , and it was there that many of his finds had been housed . Murray thus often travelled to the museum to catalogue these artefacts , and during the 1906 – 07 school year regularly lectured there . In 1907 , Petrie excavated the Tomb of the Two Brothers , a Middle Kingdom burial of two Egyptian priests , <unk> @-@ ankh and Khnum @-@ nakht , and it was decided that Murray would carry out the public unwrapping of the latter 's mummified body . Taking place at the museum in May 1908 , it represented the first time that a woman had led a public mummy unwrapping and was attended by over 500 onlookers , attracting press attention . Murray was particularly keen to emphasise the importance that the unwrapping would have for the scholarly understanding of the Middle Kingdom and its burial practices , and lashed out against members of the public who saw it as immoral ; she declared that " every vestige of ancient remains must be carefully studied and recorded without sentimentality and without fear of the outcry of the ignorant " . She subsequently published a book about her analysis of the two bodies , The Tomb of the Two Brothers , which remained a key publication on Middle Kingdom mummification practices into the 21st century . 
 Murray was dedicated to public education , hoping to infuse Egyptomania with solid scholarship about Ancient Egypt , and to this end authored a series of books aimed at a general audience . In 1905 she published Elementary Egyptian Grammar which was followed in 1911 by Elementary Coptic ( Sahidic ) Grammar . In 1913 , she published Ancient Egyptian Legends for John Murray 's " The Wisdom of the East " series . She was particularly pleased with the increased public interest in Egyptology that followed Howard Carter 's discovery of the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun in 1922 . From at least 1911 until his death in 1940 , Murray was a close friend of the anthropologist Charles Gabriel Seligman of the London School of Economics , and together they co @-@ authored a variety of papers on Egyptology that were aimed at an anthropological audience . Many of these dealt with subjects that Egyptological journals would not publish , such as the " Sa " sign for the uterus , and thus were published in Man , the journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute . It was at Seligman 's recommendation that she was invited to become a member of the Institute in 1916 . 
 In 1914 , Petrie launched the academic journal Ancient Egypt , published through his own British School of Archaeology in Egypt ( <unk> ) , which was based at UCL . Given that he was often away from London excavating in Egypt , Murray was left to operate as de facto editor much of the time . She also published many research articles in the journal and authored many of its book reviews , particularly of the German @-@ language publications which Petrie could not read . 
 The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 , in which the United Kingdom went to war against Germany and the Ottoman Empire , meant that Petrie and other staff members were unable to return to Egypt for excavation . Instead , Petrie and Murray spent much of the time reorganising the artefact collections that they had attained over the past decades . To aid Britain 's war effort , Murray enrolled as a volunteer nurse in the Volunteer Air Detachment of the College Women 's Union Society , and for several weeks was posted to Saint @-@ Malo in France . After being taken ill herself , she was sent to recuperate in Glastonbury , Somerset , where she became interested in Glastonbury Abbey and the folklore surrounding it which connected it to the legendary figure of King Arthur and to the idea that the Holy Grail had been brought there by Joseph of <unk> . Pursuing this interest , she published the paper " Egyptian Elements in the Grail Romance " in the journal Ancient Egypt , although few agreed with her conclusions and it was criticised for making unsubstantiated leaps with the evidence by the likes of Jessie Weston .

 Murray 's interest in folklore led her to develop an interest in the witch trials of Early Modern Europe . In 1917 , she published a paper in Folklore , the journal of the Folklore Society , in which she first articulated her version of the witch @-@ cult theory , arguing that the witches persecuted in European history were actually followers of " a definite religion with beliefs , ritual , and organization as highly developed as that of any cult in the end " . She followed this up with papers on the subject in the journals Man and the Scottish Historical Review . She articulated these views more fully in her 1921 book The Witch @-@ Cult in Western Europe , published by Oxford University Press after receiving a positive peer review by Henry Balfour , and which received both criticism and support on publication . Many reviews in academic journals were critical , with historians claiming that she had distorted and misinterpreted the contemporary records that she was using , but the book was nevertheless influential . 
 As a result of her work in this area , she was invited to provide the entry on " witchcraft " for the fourteenth edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica in 1929 . She used the opportunity to propagate her own witch @-@ cult theory , failing to mention the alternate theories proposed by other academics . Her entry would be included in the encyclopedia until 1969 , becoming readily accessible to the public , and it was for this reason that her ideas on the subject had such a significant impact . It received a particularly enthusiastic reception by occultists such as Dion Fortune , Lewis Spence , Ralph Shirley , and J. W. Brodie Innes , perhaps because its claims regarding an ancient secret society chimed with similar claims common among various occult groups . Murray joined the Folklore Society in February 1927 , and was elected to the society 's council a month later , although stood down in 1929 . Murray reiterated her witch @-@ cult theory in her 1933 book , The God of the Witches , which was aimed at a wider , non @-@ academic audience . In this book , she cut out or toned down what she saw as the more unpleasant aspects of the witch @-@ cult , such as animal and child sacrifice , and began describing the religion in more positive terms as " the Old Religion " . 
 From 1921 to 1927 , Murray led archaeological excavations on Malta , assisted by Edith Guest and Gertrude Caton Thompson . She excavated the Bronze Age megalithic monuments of Santa Sofia , Santa Maria tal @-@ <unk> , <unk> Dalam , and Borġ in @-@ Nadur , all of which were threatened by the construction of a new aerodrome . In this she was funded by the Percy Sladen Memorial Fund . Her resulting three @-@ volume excavation report came to be seen as an important publication within the field of Maltese archaeology . During the excavations , she had taken an interest in the island 's folklore , resulting in the 1932 publication of her book Maltese Folktales , much of which was a translation of earlier stories collected by Father <unk> and her friend Liza Galea . In 1932 Murray returned to Malta to aid in the cataloguing of the Bronze Age pottery collection held in Malta Museum , resulting in another publication , Corpus of the Bronze Age Pottery of Malta . 
 On the basis of her work in Malta , Louis C. G. Clarke , the curator of the Cambridge Museum of Ethnology and Anthropology , invited her to lead excavations on the island of Minorca from 1930 to 1931 . With the aid of Guest , she excavated the megalithic sites of <unk> and Sa <unk> , resulting in the publication of Cambridge Excavations in Minorca . Murray also continued to publish works on Egyptology for a general audience , such as Egyptian Sculpture ( 1930 ) and Egyptian Temples ( 1931 ) , which received largely positive reviews . In the summer of 1925 she led a team of volunteers to excavate Homestead Moat in <unk> Wood near to Stevenage , Hertfordshire ; she did not publish an excavation report and did not mention the event in her autobiography , with her motives for carrying out the excavation remaining unclear . 
 In 1924 , UCL promoted Murray – then aged sixty @-@ two – to the position of assistant professor , and in 1927 she was awarded an honorary doctorate for her career in Egyptology . That year , Murray was tasked with guiding Mary of Teck , the Queen consort , around the Egyptology department during the latter 's visit to UCL . The pressures of teaching had eased by this point , allowing Murray to spend more time travelling internationally ; in 1920 she returned to Egypt and in 1929 visited South Africa , where she attended the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science , whose theme was the prehistory of southern Africa . In the early 1930s she travelled to the Soviet Union , where she visited museums in Leningrad , Moscow , Kharkov , and Kiev , and then in late 1935 she undertook a lecture tour of Norway , Sweden , Finland , and Estonia . Although having reached legal retirement age in 1927 , and thus unable to be offered another five @-@ year contract , Murray was reappointed on an annual basis each year until 1935 . At this point , she retired , expressing the opinion that she was glad to leave UCL , for reasons that she did not make clear . In 1933 , Petrie had retired from UCL and moved to Jerusalem in Mandatory Palestine with his wife ; Murray therefore took over as editor of the Ancient Egypt journal , renaming it Ancient Egypt and the East to reflect its increasing research interest in the ancient societies that surrounded and interacted with Egypt . The journal folded in 1935 , perhaps due to Murray 's retirement . Murray then spent some time in Jerusalem , where she aided the Petries in their excavation at Tall al @-@ Ajjul , a Bronze Age mound south of Gaza . 
 = = = Petra , Cambridge , and London : 1935 – 53 = = = 
 During Murray 's 1935 trip to Palestine , she had taken the opportunity to visit Petra in neighbouring Jordan . Intrigued by the site , in March and April 1937 she returned in order to carry out a small excavation in several cave dwellings at the site , subsequently writing both an excavation report and a guidebook on Petra . Back in England , from 1934 to 1940 , Murray aided the cataloguing of Egyptian antiquities at Girton College , Cambridge , and also gave lectures in Egyptology at the university until 1942 . During the Second World War , Murray evaded the Blitz of London by moving to Cambridge , where she volunteered for a group ( probably the Army Bureau of Current Affairs or The British Way and Purpose ) who educated military personnel to prepare them for post @-@ war life . Based in the city , she embarked on research into the town 's Early Modern history , examining documents stored in local parish churches , Downing College , and Ely Cathedral ; she never published her findings . 
 After the war ended she returned to London , settling into a bedsit room in <unk> Street , which was close to University College London ( UCL ) and the Institute of Archaeology ( then an independent institution , now part of UCL ) ; she continued her involvement with the former and made use of the latter 's library . On most days she visited the British Museum in order to consult their library , and twice a week she taught adult education classes on Ancient Egyptian history and religion at the City Literary Institute ; upon her retirement from this position she nominated her former pupil , Veronica Seton @-@ Williams , to replace her . 
 Murray 's interest in popularising Egyptology among the wider public continued ; in 1949 she published Ancient Egyptian Religious Poetry , her second work for John Murray 's " The Wisdom of the East " series . That same year she also published The Splendour That Was Egypt , in which she collated many of her UCL lectures . The book adopted a diffusionist perspective that argued that Egypt influenced Greco @-@ Roman society and thus modern Western society . This was seen as a compromise between Petrie 's belief that other societies influenced the emergence of Egyptian civilisation and Grafton Elliot Smith 's highly unorthodox and heavily criticised hyperdiffusionist view that Egypt was the source of all global civilisation . The book received a mixed reception from the archaeological community .

 In 1953 , Murray was appointed to the presidency of the Folklore Society following the resignation of former president Allan Gomme . The Society had initially approached John <unk> for the post , but he had declined , with Murray accepting the nomination several months later . Murray remained President for two terms , until 1955 . In her 1954 presidential address , " England as a Field for Folklore Research " , she lamented what she saw as the English people 's disinterest in their own folklore in favour of that from other nations . For the autumn 1961 issue of Folklore , the society published a festschrift to Murray to commemorate her 98th birthday . The issue contained contributions from various scholars paying tribute to her – with papers dealing with archaeology , fairies , Near Eastern religious symbols , Greek folk songs – but notably not about witchcraft , potentially because no other folklorists were willing to defend her witch @-@ cult theory . 
 In May 1957 , Murray had championed the archaeologist Thomas Charles Lethbridge 's controversial claims that he had discovered three pre @-@ Christian chalk hill figures on Wandlebury Hill in the Gog Magog Downs , Cambridgeshire . Privately she expressed concern about the reality of the figures . Lethbridge subsequently authored a book championing her witch @-@ cult theory in which he sought the cult 's origins in pre @-@ Christian culture . In 1960 , she donated her collection of papers – including correspondences with a wide range of individuals across the country – to the Folklore Society Archive , where it is now known as " the Murray Collection " . 
 Crippled with arthritis , Murray had moved into a home in North Finchley , north London , where she was cared for by a retired couple who were trained nurses ; from here she occasionally took taxis into central London to visit the UCL library . Amid failing health , in 1962 Murray moved into the Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital in Welwyn , Hertfordshire , where she could receive 24 @-@ hour care ; she lived here for the final 18 months of her life . To mark her hundredth birthday , on 13 July 1963 a group of her friends , former students , and doctors gathered for a party at nearby Ayot St. Lawrence . Two days later , her doctor drove her to UCL for a second birthday party , again attended by many of her friends , colleagues , and former students ; it was the last time that she visited the university . In Man , the journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute , it was noted that Murray was " the only Fellow of the Institute to [ reach their centenary ] within living memory , if not in its whole history " . That year she published two books ; one was The Genesis of Religion , in which she argued that humanity 's first deities had been goddesses rather than male gods . The second was her autobiography , My First Hundred Years , which received predominantly positive reviews . She died on 13 November 1963 , and her body was cremated .

 The later folklorists Caroline Oates and Juliette Wood have suggested that Murray was best known for her witch @-@ cult theory , with biographer Margaret S. Drower expressing the view that it was her work on this subject which " perhaps more than any other , made her known to the general public " . It has been claimed that Murray 's was the " first feminist study of the witch trials " , as well as being the first to have actually " empowered the witches " by giving the ( largely female ) accused both free will and a voice distinct from that of their interrogators . The theory was faulty , in part because all of her academic training was in Egyptology , with no background knowledge in European history , but also because she exhibited a " tendency to generalize wildly on the basis of very slender evidence " . Oates and Wood , however , noted that Murray 's interpretations of the evidence fitted within wider perspectives on the past that existed at the time , stating that " Murray was far from isolated in her method of reading ancient ritual origins into later myths " . In particular , her approach was influenced by the work of the anthropologist James Frazer , who had argued for the existence of a pervasive dying @-@ and @-@ resurrecting god myth , and she was also influenced by the interpretative approaches of E. O. James , Karl Pearson , Herbert Fleure , and Harold Peake . 
 = = = Argument = = = 
 In The Witch @-@ Cult in Western Europe , Murray stated that she had restricted her research to Great Britain , although made some recourse to sources from France , Flanders , and New England . She drew a division between what she termed " Operative Witchcraft " , which referred to the performance of charms and spells with any purpose , and " Ritual Witchcraft " , by which she meant " the ancient religion of Western Europe " , a fertility @-@ based faith that she also termed " the Dianic cult " . She claimed that the cult had " very probably " once been devoted to the worship of both a male deity and a " Mother Goddess " but that " at the time when the cult is recorded the worship of the male deity appears to have superseded that of the female " . In her argument , Murray claimed that the figure referred to as the Devil in the trial accounts was the witches ' god , " manifest and incarnate " , to whom the witches ' offered their prayers . She claimed that at the witches ' meetings , the god would be personified , usually by a man or at times by a woman or an animal ; when a human personified this entity , Murray claimed that they were usually dressed plainly , though they appeared in full costume for the witches ' Sabbaths . 
 Members joined the cult either as children or adults through what Murray called " admission ceremonies " ; Murray asserted that applicants had to agree to join of their own free will , and agree to devote themselves to the service of their deity . She also claimed that in some cases , these individuals had to sign a covenant or were baptised into the faith . At the same time , she claimed that the religion was largely passed down hereditary lines . Murray described the religion as being divided into covens containing thirteen members , led by a coven officer who was often termed the " Devil " in the trial accounts , but who was accountable to a " Grand Master " . According to Murray , the records of the coven were kept in a secret book , with the coven also disciplining its members , to the extent of executing those deemed traitors . 
 Describing this witch @-@ cult as " a joyous religion " , she claimed that the two primary festivals that it celebrated were on May Eve and November Eve , although that other dates of religious observation were 1 February and 1 August , the winter and summer solstices , and Easter . She asserted that the " General Meeting of all members of the religion " were known as Sabbaths , while the more private ritual meetings were known as Esbats . The Esbats , Murray claimed , were nocturnal rites that began at midnight , and were " primarily for business , whereas the Sabbath was purely religious " . At the former , magical rites were performed both for malevolent and benevolent ends . She also asserted that the Sabbath ceremonies involved the witches paying homage to the deity , renewing their " vows of fidelity and obedience " to him , and providing him with accounts of all the magical actions that they have conducted since the previous Sabbath . Once this business had been concluded , admissions to the cult or marriages were conducted , ceremonies and fertility rites took place , and then the Sabbath ended with feasting and dancing . 
 Deeming Ritual Witchcraft to be " a fertility cult " , she asserted that many of its rites were designed to ensure fertility and rain @-@ making . She claimed that there were four types of sacrifice performed by the witches : blood @-@ sacrifice , in which the neophyte writes their name in blood , the sacrifice of animals , the sacrifice of a non @-@ Christian child to procure magical powers , and the sacrifice of the witches ' god by fire to ensure fertility . She interpreted accounts of witches ' shapeshifting into various animals as being representative of a rite in which the witches dressed as specific animals which they took to be sacred . She asserted that accounts of familiars were based on the witches ' use of animals , which she divided into " divining familiars " used in divination and " domestic familiars " used in other magic rites . 
 Murray asserted that a pre @-@ Christian fertility @-@ based religion had survived the Christianization process in Britain , although that it came to be " practised only in certain places and among certain classes of the community " . She believed that folkloric stories of fairies in Britain were based on a surviving race of dwarfs , who continued to live on the island up until the Early Modern period . She asserted that this race followed the same pagan religion as the witches , thus explaining the folkloric connection between the two . In the appendices to the book , she also alleged that Joan of Arc and Gilles de Rais were members of the witch @-@ cult and were executed for it , a claim which has been refuted by historians , especially in the case of Joan of Arc . 
 The later historian Ronald Hutton commented that The Witch @-@ Cult in Western Europe " rested upon a small amount of archival research , with extensive use of printed trial records in 19th @-@ century editions , plus early modern pamphlets and works of demonology " . He also noted that the book 's tone was generally " dry and clinical , and every assertion was meticulously footnoted to a source , with lavish quotation " . It was not a bestseller ; in its first thirty years , only 2 @,@ 020 copies were sold . However , it led many people to treat Murray as an authority on the subject ; in 1929 , she was invited to provide the entry on " Witchcraft " for the Encyclopædia Britannica , and used it to present her interpretation of the subject as if it were universally accepted in scholarship . It remained in the encyclopedia until being replaced in 1968 . 
 Murray followed The Witch @-@ Cult in Western Europe with The God of the Witches , published by the popular press Sampson Low in 1931 ; although similar in content , unlike her previous volume it was aimed at a mass market audience . The tone of the book also differed strongly from its predecessor , containing " emotionally inflated [ language ] and coloured with religious phraseology " and repeatedly referring to the witch @-@ cult as " the Old Religion " . In this book she also " cut out or toned down " many of the claims made in her previous volume which would have painted the cult in a bad light , such as those which discussed sex and the sacrifice of animals and children . 
 In this book she began to refer to the witches ' deity as the Horned God , and asserted that it was an entity who had been worshipped in Europe since the Palaeolithic . She further asserted that in the Bronze Age , the worship of the deity could be found throughout Europe , Asia , and parts of Africa , claiming that the depiction of various horned figures from these societies proved that . Among the evidence cited were the horned figures found at Mohenjo @-@ Daro , which are often interpreted as depictions of Pashupati , as well as the deities Osiris and Amon in Egypt and the Minotaur of Minoan Crete . Within continental Europe , she claimed that the Horned God was represented by Pan in Greece , Cernunnos in Gaul , and in various Scandinavian rock carvings . Claiming that this divinity had been declared the Devil by the Christian authorities , she nevertheless asserted that his worship was testified in officially Christian societies right through to the Modern period , citing folkloric practices such as the Dorset Ooser and the Puck Fair as evidence of his veneration . 
 In 1954 , she published The Divine King in England , in which she greatly extended on the theory , taking in an influence from Frazer 's The Golden Bough , an anthropological book that made the claim that societies all over the world sacrificed their kings to the deities of nature . In her book , she claimed that this practice had continued into medieval England , and that , for instance , the death of William II was really a ritual sacrifice . No academic took the book seriously , and it was ignored by many of her supporters .

 Upon initial publication , Murray 's thesis gained a favourable reception from many readers , including some significant scholars , albeit none who were experts in the witch trials . Historians of Early Modern Britain like George Norman Clark and Christopher Hill incorporated her theories into their work , although the latter subsequently distanced himself from the theory . For the 1961 reprint of The Witch @-@ Cult in Western Europe , the Medieval historian Steven Runciman provided a foreword in which he accepted that some of Murray 's " minor details may be open to criticism " , but in which he was otherwise supportive of her thesis . Her theories were recapitulated by Arno Runeberg in his 1947 book Witches , Demons and Fertility Magic as well as Pennethorne Hughes in his 1952 book Witches . As a result , a commentator writing in 1962 could claim that the Murrayite interpretations of the witch trials " seem to hold , at the time of writing , an almost undisputed sway at the higher intellectual levels " , being widely accepted among " educated people " . 
 The Canadian historian Elliot Rose suggested that the reason that Murray 's theory gained such support was partly because of her " imposing credentials " as a member of staff at UCL , a position that lent her theory greater legitimacy in the eyes of many readers . He further suggested that the Murrayite view was attractive to many as it confirmed " the general picture of pre @-@ Christian Europe a reader of Frazer or [ Robert ] Graves would be familiar with " . Similarly , Hutton suggested that the cause of the Murrayite theory 's popularity was because it " appealed to so many of the emotional impulses of the age " , including " the notion of the English countryside as a timeless place full of ancient secrets " , the literary popularity of Pan , the widespread belief that the majority of British had remained pagan long after the process of Christianisation , and the idea that folk customs represented pagan survivals . At the same time , Hutton suggested , it seemed more plausible to many than the previously dominant rationalist idea that the witch trials were the result of mass delusion . Related to this , the folklorist Jacqueline Simpson suggested that part of the Murrayite theory 's appeal was that it appeared to give a " sensible , demystifying , liberating approach to a longstanding but sterile argument " between the rationalists who denied that there had been any witches and those , like Montague Summers , who insisted that there had been a real Satanic conspiracy against Christendom in the Early Modern period replete with witches with supernatural powers . " How refreshing " , noted the historian Hilda Ellis Davidson , " and exciting her first book was at that period . A new approach , and such a surprising one . " 
 = = = = Early criticism = = = = 
 Murray 's theories never received support from experts in the Early Modern witch trials , and from her early publications onward many of her ideas were challenged by those who highlighted her " factual errors and methodological failings " . Indeed , the majority of scholarly reviews of her work produced during the 1920s and 1930s were largely critical . George L. Burr reviewed both of her initial books on the witch @-@ cult for the American Historical Review . He stated that she was not acquainted with the " careful general histories by modern scholars " and criticised her for assuming that the trial accounts accurately reflected the accused witches ' genuine experiences of witchcraft , regardless of whether those confessions had been obtained through torture and coercion . He also charged her with selectively using the evidence to serve her interpretation , for instance by omitting any supernatural or miraculous events that appear in the trial accounts . W. R. Halliday was highly critical in his review for Folklore , as was E. M. Loeb in his review for American Anthropologist . 
 Soon after , one of the foremost specialists of the trial records , L 'Estrange Ewen , brought out a series of books which rejected Murray 's interpretation . Rose suggested that Murray 's books on the witch @-@ cult " contain an incredible number of minor errors of fact or of calculation and several inconsistencies of reasoning " . He accepted that her case " could , perhaps , still be proved by somebody else , though I very much doubt it " . Highlighting that there is a gap of about a thousand years between the Christianisation of Britain and the start of the witch trials there , he argues that there is no evidence for the existence of the witch @-@ cult anywhere in the intervening period . He further criticises Murray for treating pre @-@ Christian Britain as a socially and culturally monolithic entity , whereas in reality , it contained a diverse array of societies and religious beliefs . He also challenges Murray 's claim that the majority of Britons in the Middle Ages remained pagan as " a view grounded on ignorance alone " . 
 Murray did not respond directly to the criticisms of her work , but reacted to her critics in a hostile manner ; in later life she asserted that she eventually ceased reading reviews of her work , and believed that her critics were simply acting out of their own Christian prejudices to non @-@ Christian religion . Simpson noted that despite these critical reviews , within the field of British folkloristics Murray 's theories were permitted " to pass unapproved but unchallenged , either out of politeness or because nobody was really interested enough to research the topic " . As evidence , she noted that no substantial research articles on the subject of witchcraft were published in Folklore between Murray 's in 1917 and Rossell Hope Robbins ' in 1963 . She also highlighted that when regional studies of British folklore were published in this period by folklorists like Theo Brown , Ruth Tongue , or Enid Porter , none adopted the Murrayite framework for interpreting witchcraft beliefs , thus evidencing her claim that Murray 's theories were widely ignored by scholars of folkloristics . 
 = = = = Academic rejection = = = = 
 Murray 's work was increasingly criticised following her death in 1963 , with the definitive academic rejection of the Murrayite witch @-@ cult theory occurring during the 1970s . During these decades , a variety of scholars across Europe and North America – such as Alan Macfarlane , Erik <unk> , William Monter , Robert <unk> , Gerhard <unk> , Bente <unk> and Bengt <unk> – published in @-@ depth studies of the archival records from the witch trials , leaving no doubt that those tried for witchcraft were not practitioners of a surviving pre @-@ Christian religion . In 1971 , the English historian Keith Thomas stated that on the basis of this research , there was " very little evidence to suggest that the accused witches were either devil @-@ worshippers or members of a pagan fertility cult " . He stated that Murray 's conclusions were " almost totally groundless " because she ignored the systematic study of the trial accounts provided by Ewen and instead used sources very selectively to argue her point . 
 In 1975 , the historian Norman Cohn commented that Murray 's " knowledge of European history , even of English history , was superficial and her grasp of historical method was non @-@ existent " , adding that her ideas were " firmly set in an exaggerated and distorted version of the <unk> mould " . That same year , the historian of religion Mircea Eliade described Murray 's work as " hopelessly inadequate " , containing " numberless and appalling errors " . In 1996 , the feminist historian Diane Purkiss stated that although Murray 's thesis was " intrinsically improbable " and commanded " little or no allegiance within the modern academy " , she felt that male scholars like Thomas , Cohn , and Macfarlane had unfairly adopted an androcentric approach by which they contrasted their own , male and methodologically sound interpretation against Murray 's " feminised belief " about the witch @-@ cult . 
 Hutton stated that Murray had treated her source material with " reckless abandon " , in that she had taken " vivid details of alleged witch practices " from " sources scattered across a great extent of space and time " and then declared them to be normative of the cult as a whole . Simpson outlined how Murray had selected her use of evidence very specifically , particularly by ignoring and / or rationalising any accounts of supernatural or miraculous events in the trial records , thereby distorting the events that she was describing . Thus , Simpson pointed out , Murray rationalised claims that the cloven @-@ hoofed Devil appeared at the witches ' Sabbath by stating that he was a man with a special kind of shoe , and similarly asserted that witches ' claims to have flown through the air on broomsticks were actually based on their practice of either hopping along on broomsticks or smearing hallucinogenic salves onto themselves . Concurring with this assessment , the historian Jeffrey Burton Russell , writing with the independent author Brooks Alexander , stated that " Murray 's use of sources , in general , is appalling " . The pair went on to claim that " today , scholars are agreed that Murray was more than just wrong – she was completely and embarrassingly wrong on nearly all of her basic premises " . 
 The Italian historian Carlo Ginzburg has been cited as being willing to give " some slight support " to Murray 's theory . Ginzburg stated that although her thesis had been " formulated in a wholly uncritical way " and contained " serious defects " , it did contain " a kernel of truth " . He stated his opinion that she was right in claiming that European witchcraft had " roots in an ancient fertility cult " , something that he argued was vindicated by his work researching the benandanti , an agrarian visionary tradition recorded in the Friuli district of Northeastern Italy during the 16th and 17th centuries . Several historians and folklorists have pointed out that Ginzburg 's arguments are very different to Murray 's : whereas Murray argued for the existence of a pre @-@ Christian witches ' cult whose members physically met during the witches ' Sabbaths , Ginzburg argued that some of the European visionary traditions that were conflated with witchcraft in the Early Modern period had their origins in pre @-@ Christian fertility religions . Moreover , other historians have expressed criticism of Ginzburg 's interpretation of the benandanti ; Cohn stated that that there was " nothing whatsoever " in the source material to justify the idea that the benandanti were the " survival of an age @-@ old fertility cult " . Echoing these views , Hutton commented that Ginzburg 's claim that the benandanti 's visionary traditions were a survival from pre @-@ Christian practices was an idea resting on " imperfect material and conceptual foundations " . He added that Ginzburg 's " assumption " that " what was being dreamed about in the sixteenth century had in fact been acted out in religious ceremonies " dating to " pagan times " , was entire " an inference of his own " and not one supported by the documentary evidence .

 On researching the history of UCL 's Egyptology department , the historian Rosalind M. Janssen stated that Murray was " remembered with gratitude and immense affection by all her former students . A wise and witty teacher , two generations of Egyptologists have forever been in her debt . " Alongside teaching them , Murray was known to socialise with her UCL students outside of class hours . The archaeologist Ralph Merrifield , who knew Murray through the Folklore Society , described her as a " diminutive and kindly scholar , who radiated intelligence and strength of character into extreme old age " . Davidson , who also knew Murray through the Society , noted that at their meetings " she would sit near the front , a bent and seemingly guileless old lady dozing peacefully , and then in the middle of a discussion would suddenly intervene with a relevant and penetrating comment which showed that she had missed not one word of the argument " . The later folklorist Juliette Wood noted that many members of the Folklore Society " remember her fondly " , adding that Murray had been " especially keen to encourage younger researchers , even those who disagreed with her ideas " . 
 One of Murray 's friends in the Society , E. O. James , described her as a " mine of information and a perpetual inspiration ever ready to impart her vast and varied stores of specialised knowledge without reserve , or , be it said , much if any regard for the generally accepted opinions and conclusions of the experts ! " Davidson described her as being " not at all assertive ... [ she ] never thrust her ideas on anyone . [ In relation to her witch @-@ cult theory , ] she behaved in fact rather like someone who was a fully convinced member of some unusual religious sect , or perhaps , of the Freemasons , but never on any account got into arguments about it in public . " The archaeologist Glyn Daniel observed that Murray remained mentally alert into her old age , commenting that " her vigour and forthrightness and ruthless energy never deserted her " . 
 Murray never married , instead devoting her life to her work , and for this reason , Hutton drew comparisons between her and two other prominent female British scholars of the period , Jane Harrison and Jessie Weston . Murray 's biographer Kathleen L. Sheppard stated that she was deeply committed to public outreach , particularly when it came to Egyptology , and that as such she " wanted to change the means by which the public obtained knowledge about Egypt 's history : she wished to throw open the doors to the scientific laboratory and invite the public in " . She considered travel to be one of her favourite activities , although due to restraints on her time and finances she was unable to do this regularly ; her salary remained small and the revenue from her books was meagre . 
 Raised a devout Christian by her mother , Murray had initially become a Sunday School teacher to preach the faith , but after entering the academic profession she rejected religion , gaining a reputation among other members of the Folklore Society as a noted sceptic and a rationalist . She was openly critical of organised religion , although continued to maintain a personal belief in a God of some sort , relating in her autobiography that she believed in " an unseen over @-@ ruling Power " , " which science calls Nature and religion calls God " . She was also a believer and a practitioner of magic , performing curses against those whom she felt deserved it : in one case she cursed a fellow academic , Jaroslav Černý , when she felt that his promotion to the position of Professor of Egyptology over her friend Walter Bryan Emery was unworthy . Her curse entailed mixing up ingredients in a frying pan , and was undertaken in the presence of two colleagues . In another instance , she was claimed to have created a wax image of Kaiser Wilhelm II and then melted it during the First World War .

 Hutton noted that Murray was one of the earliest women to " make a serious impact upon the world of professional scholarship " , and the archaeologist Niall Finneran described her as " one of the greatest characters of post @-@ war British archaeology " . Upon her death , Daniel referred to her as " the Grand Old Woman of Egyptology " , with Hutton noting that Egyptology represented " the core of her academic career " . In 2014 , Thornton referred to her as " one of Britain 's most famous Egyptologists " . However , according to the archaeologist Ruth Whitehouse , Murray 's contributions to archaeology and Egyptology were often overlooked as her work was overshadowed by that of Petrie , to the extent that she was often thought of primarily as one of Petrie 's assistants rather than as a scholar in her own right . By her retirement she had come to be highly regarded within the discipline , although , according to Whitehouse , Murray 's reputation declined following her death , something that Whitehouse attributed to the rejection of her witch @-@ cult theory and the general erasure of women archaeologists from the discipline 's male @-@ dominated history . 
 In his obituary for Murray in Folklore , James noted that her death was " an event of unusual interest and importance in the annals of the Folk @-@ Lore Society in particular as well as in the wider sphere in which her influence was felt in so many directions and disciplines " . However , later academic folklorists , such as Simpson and Wood , have cited Murray and her witch @-@ cult theory as an embarrassment to their field , and to the Folklore Society specifically . Simpson suggested that Murray 's position as President of the Society was a causal factor in the mistrustful attitude that many historians held toward folkloristics as an academic discipline , as they erroneously came to believe that all folklorists endorsed Murray 's ideas . Similarly , Catherine Noble stated that " Murray caused considerable damage to the study of witchcraft " . 
 In 1935 , UCL introduced the Margaret Murray Prize , awarded to the student who is deemed to have produced the best dissertation in Egyptology ; it continued to be presented annually into the 21st century . In 1969 , UCL named one of their common rooms in her honour , but it was converted into an office in 1989 . In June 1983 , Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother visited the room and there was gifted a copy of Murray 's My First Hundred Years . UCL also hold two busts of Murray , one kept in the Petrie Museum and the other in the library of the UCL Institute of Archaeology . This sculpture was commissioned by one of her students , Violet MacDermot , and produced by the artist Stephen Rickard . UCL also possess a watercolour painting of Murray by Winifred Brunton ; formerly exhibited in the Petrie Gallery , it was later placed into the Art Collection stores . In 2013 , on the 150th anniversary of Murray 's birth and the 50th of her death , the UCL Institute of Archaeology 's Ruth Whitehouse described Murray as " a remarkable woman " whose life was " well worth celebrating , both in the archaeological world at large and especially in UCL " . 
 The historian of archaeology Rosalind M. Janssen titled her study of Egyptology at UCL The First Hundred Years " as a tribute " to Murray . Murray 's friend Margaret <unk> Drower authored a short biography of her , which was included as a chapter in the 2004 edited volume on Breaking Ground : Pioneering Women Archaeologists . In 2013 , Lexington Books published The Life of Margaret Alice Murray : A Woman 's Work in Archaeology , a biography of Murray authored by Kathleen L. Sheppard , then an assistant professor at Missouri University of Science and Technology ; the book was based upon Sheppard 's doctoral dissertation produced at the University of Oklahoma . Although characterising it as being " written in a clear and engaging manner " , one reviewer noted that Sheppard 's book focuses on Murray the " scientist " and as such neglects to discuss Murray 's involvement in magical practices and her relationship with Wicca . 
 = = = In Wicca = = = 
 Murray 's witch @-@ cult theories provided the blueprint for the contemporary Pagan religion of Wicca , with Murray being referred to as the " Grandmother of Wicca " . The Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White stated that it was the theory which " formed the historical narrative around which Wicca built itself " , for on its emergence in England during the 1940s and 1950s , Wicca claimed to be the survival of this witch @-@ cult . Wicca 's theological structure , revolving around a Horned God and Mother Goddess , was adopted from Murray 's ideas about the ancient witch @-@ cult , and Wiccan groups were named covens and their meetings termed <unk> , both words that Murray had popularised . As with Murray 's witch @-@ cult , Wicca 's practitioners entered via an initiation ceremony ; Murray 's claims that witches wrote down their spells in a book may have been an influence on Wicca 's Book of Shadows . Wicca 's early system of seasonal festivities were also based on Murray 's framework . 
 Noting that there is no evidence of Wicca existing before the publication of Murray 's books , Merrifield commented that for those in 20th century Britain who wished to form their own witches ' covens , " Murray may have seemed the ideal fairy godmother , and her theory became the pumpkin coach that could transport them into the realm of fantasy for which they longed " . The historian Philip Heselton suggested that the New Forest coven – the oldest alleged Wiccan group – was founded circa 1935 by esotericists aware of Murray 's theory and who may have believed themselves to be reincarnated witch @-@ cult members . It was Gerald Gardner , who claimed to be an initiate of the New Forest coven , who established the tradition of Gardnerian Wicca and popularised the religion ; according to Simpson , Gardner was the only member of the Folklore Society to " wholeheartedly " accept Murray 's witch @-@ cult hypothesis . The duo knew each other , with Murray writing the foreword to Gardner 's 1954 book Witchcraft Today , although in that foreword she did not explicitly specify whether she believed Gardner 's claim that he had discovered a survival of her witch @-@ cult . In 2005 , Noble suggested that " Murray 's name might be all but forgotten today if it were not for Gerald Gardner " . 
 Murray 's witch @-@ cult theories were likely also a core influence on the non @-@ Gardnerian Wiccan traditions that were established in Britain and Australia between 1930 and 1970 by the likes of Bob Clay @-@ Egerton , Robert Cochrane , Charles Cardell , and Rosaleen Norton . The prominent Wiccan Doreen Valiente eagerly searched for what she believed were other surviving remnants of the Murrayite witch @-@ cult around Britain . Valiente remained committed to a belief in Murray 's witch @-@ cult after its academic rejection , and she described Murray as " a remarkable woman " . In San Francisco during the late 1960s , Murray 's writings were among the sources used by Aidan A. Kelly in the creation of his Wiccan tradition , the New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn . In Los Angeles during the early 1970s , they were used by Zsuzsanna Budapest when she was establishing her feminist @-@ oriented tradition of Dianic Wicca . The Murrayite witch @-@ cult theory also provided the basis for the ideas espoused in Witchcraft and the Gay Counterculture , a 1978 book written by the American gay liberation activist Arthur Evans . 
 Members of the Wiccan community gradually became aware of academia 's rejection of the witch @-@ cult theory . Accordingly , belief in its literal truth declined during the 1980s and 1990s , with many Wiccans instead coming to view it as a myth that conveyed metaphorical or symbolic truths . Others insisted that the historical origins of the religion did not matter and that instead Wicca was legitimated by the spiritual experiences it gave to its participants . In response , Hutton authored The Triumph of the Moon , a historical study exploring Wicca 's early development ; on publication in 1999 the book exerted a strong impact on the British Pagan community , further eroding belief in the Murrayite theory among Wiccans . Conversely , other practitioners clung on to the theory , treating it as an important article of faith and rejecting post @-@ Murrayite scholarship on European witchcraft . Several prominent practitioners continued to insist that Wicca was a religion with origins stretching back to the Palaeolithic , but others rejected the validity of historical scholarship and emphasised intuition and emotion as the arbiter of truth . A few " counter @-@ revisionist " Wiccans – among them Donald H. Frew , Jani Farrell @-@ Roberts , and Ben Whitmore – published critiques in which they attacked post @-@ Murrayite scholarship on matters of detail , but none defended Murray 's original hypothesis completely . 
 = = = In literature = = = 
 Simpson noted that the publication of the Murray thesis in the Encyclopaedia Britannica made it accessible to " journalists , film @-@ makers popular novelists and thriller writers " , who adopted it " enthusiastically " . It influenced the work of Aldous Huxley and Robert Graves . It was also an influence on the American horror author H. P. Lovecraft , who cited The Witch @-@ Cult in Western Europe in his writings about the fictional cult of Cthulhu . 
 The author Sylvia Townsend Warner cited Murray 's work on the witch @-@ cult as an influence on her 1926 novel Lolly <unk> , and sent a copy of her book to Murray in appreciation , with the two meeting for lunch shortly after . There was nevertheless some difference in their depictions of the witch @-@ cult ; whereas Murray had depicted an organised pre @-@ Christian cult , Warner depicted a vague family tradition that was explicitly Satanic . In 1927 , Warner lectured on the subject of witchcraft , exhibiting a strong influence from Murray 's work . Analysing the relationship between Murray and Warner , the English literature scholar Mimi Winick characterised both as being " engaged in imagining new possibilities for women in modernity " .

The duo starred in the Channel 4 sitcom Peep Show in which Mitchell plays Mark Corrigan . Mitchell won the British Academy Television Award for Best Comedy Performance in 2009 for his performance in the show . The duo have written and starred in several sketch shows including Bruiser , The Mitchell and Webb Situation , That Mitchell and Webb Sound and also That Mitchell and Webb Look .

He also hosts the television panel game Was It Something I Said ? , the radio show The Unbelievable Truth and the comedy news programme 10 O 'Clock Live . As a writer , Mitchell regularly contributes comment articles to The Observer and The Guardian . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Mitchell 's ancestry can in part be traced back to the Highland Clearances . He was born in Salisbury , Wiltshire , England , to Ian Douglas Mitchell and Kathy Grey Mitchell ( née Hughes ) , who were then hotel managers . In 1977 , his parents gave up their jobs to lecture and to look after a then two @-@ year @-@ old Mitchell . He attended Napier House primary school . He is the elder of two boys ; when David was seven and a half years old his parents had another son , Daniel . The family moved to Oxford where Mitchell 's parents became lecturers on hotel management at Oxford Polytechnic and he attended New College School which was an independent preparatory school in the city . In a 2006 interview with The Independent , Mitchell stated his childhood dreams : 
 When I was at school I either wanted to be a comedian @-@ stroke @-@ actor or prime minister . But I didn 't admit that to other people , I said I wanted to be a barrister and that made my parents very happy . I didn 't admit I wanted to be a comedian until I came to university , met a lot of other people who wanted to be comedians , and realised it was an okay thing to say . 
 From the age of 13 Mitchell was educated at Abingdon School , a public school in Oxfordshire . Having always been top of the class at primary school and prep school , once he moved to Abingdon , he realised that there were plenty of people more intelligent than he was and so turned his attention to debating and drama , " where [ he ] had a chance of being the best " . There , Mitchell often took part in plays , " largely because you got to play cards backstage . " His roles mainly consisted of small minute @-@ long parts , until he won the role of Rabbit in Winnie @-@ the @-@ Pooh . This was the first time that he was " consciously aware I was doing a performance " and that that " was better , even , than playing cards . " Mitchell had been " obsessed " with comedy writing since his school days , as he " always felt that doing a joke was the cleverest thing " , and " would intrinsically prefer a parody of something to the actual thing itself " . 
 = = = Education = = = 
 Rejected by Merton College , University of Oxford , in 1993 , Mitchell went up to Peterhouse , Cambridge where he read History . There , he began performing with the Cambridge Footlights , of which he became president for the 1995 – 96 academic year . 
 Mitchell was in his first year at university when he met Robert Webb during rehearsals for a 1993 Footlights production of Cinderella , and the two men soon set up a comedy partnership . According to Mitchell these factors had a detrimental effect on his studies at university and he attained a 2 : 2 in his final exams .

 Before his break into comedy , Mitchell worked as an usher at the Lyric Hammersmith theatre , and in the cloakroom of TFI Friday among other jobs . 
 Mitchell 's first project with Webb was in January 1995 , a show about a nuclear apocalypse entitled Innocent Millions Dead or Dying : A Wry Look at the Post @-@ Apocalyptic Age . Webb later described it as being " fucking terrible " . After leaving university he and Webb began performing a number of two @-@ man shows at the Edinburgh Fringe . 
 As a result of their performances at the Edinburgh Fringe , the duo were given the chance to write for Alexander Armstrong and Ben Miller and for series two of Big Train . After minor work on The Jack Docherty Show and Comedy Nation , their first break into television acting was in 2000 , on the short @-@ lived BBC sketch show Bruiser , which they primarily wrote , and starred in . The show also featured three time BAFTA winner Olivia Colman , who would become a regular cast member of Mitchell and Webb projects , and Martin Freeman , later of The Office fame . Other cast members included Matthew Holness and Charlotte Hudson . Additional material for the show was provided by various people , including Ricky Gervais and James Bachman . 
 In 2001 the two men were commissioned for a sketch show of their own , entitled The Mitchell and Webb Situation , which ran for six episodes on the now defunct channel Play UK . Despite the show running for a mere series , it was reasonably well received . Wessex Scene 's Darren Richman said " what the series lacked in budget , it made up for in magnificent material " and went on to call it " far superior to the vastly overrated Little Britain " and " perhaps the greatest forgotten sketch show of modern times . " Eureka ! TV said that the show " gushes forth an hilarious stream of surreal and quirkily inventive sketches " , as well as calling it a " cult success " . Eureka ! TV released The Mitchell and Webb Situation on DVD in 2005 . In the interview with Wessex Scene , Mitchell stated that he was " more proud of the way it turned out than annoyed that it was only aired on a small channel . " 
 Mitchell and Webb 's next project came in 2003 , with starring roles in the Channel 4 sitcom Peep Show , as flatmates Mark Corrigan and Jeremy <unk> respectively . The show originated from writers Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain 's failed attempt to complete a team @-@ written sitcom for the BBC ; they had an old script that they wanted to revive and Mitchell and Webb helped out , with it eventually evolving into Peep Show . Despite low viewing figures ( which almost got the show cancelled after series three ) the show was received to wide critical acclaim . The British Sitcom Guide called it " without a doubt one of the best sitcoms of the decade . " Ricky Gervais has been cited as saying " the last thing I got genuinely excited about on British TV was Peep Show , which I thought was the best sitcom since Father Ted " . The BBC hailed Mitchell 's performance in the series , citing that " As Mark Corrigan , David reached out to all those middle @-@ aged men in a twentysomething 's body , who believe drugs are boring and systems are necessary if society is to function at all . " Mitchell has stated that he empathises with Mark and enjoys playing him and that he " agrees with many of [ Mark 's ] opinions . " Peep Show has aired nine series , making it the longest @-@ running sitcom in Channel 4 history . 
 In 2009 , Mitchell won the British Academy Television Award for Best Comedy Performance for his work on Peep Show , after having lost in the same category the year before . He was nominated again in 2010 . He won the award " Best Television Comedy Actor " at the 2007 British Comedy Awards , and the pair shared the 2007 Royal Television Society Award for " Comedy Performance " . They were also jointly nominated for " Best Television Comedy Actor " at the 2006 British Comedy Awards . Peep Show itself has also won the BAFTA for " Best situation comedy " in 2008 , and the British Comedy Award for " Best TV comedy " in 2006 , and retained it the following year . It also won " Best TV Comedy " at the South Bank Show Awards , and claimed a Golden Rose in 2004 .

 After the success of Peep Show Mitchell and Webb returned to sketch comedy with their BBC Radio 4 sketch show That Mitchell and Webb Sound , which ran for four series . The show was adapted for television and became That Mitchell and Webb Look . Producer Gareth Edwards described it as " the shortest pitch [ he had ] ever written " . The show has run for four series . Towards the end of 2006 the pair made their first tour , with a show called The Two Faces of Mitchell and Webb . The tour was criticised as just " a succession of largely unrelated scenes " by The Guardian 's Brian Logan , who gave it a rating of two stars . 
 That Mitchell and Webb Look won them the BAFTA for Best Comedy Programme or Series at the 2007 awards , and they earned a further nomination for it in 2009 . It was nominated for two British Comedy Awards in 2006 : Britain 's Best New TV Comedy and the Highland Spring People 's Choice . Their stage tour The Two Faces of Mitchell and Webb was nominated for the British Comedy Award for Best Stage Comedy , and That Mitchell and Webb Sound won a Sony Silver Award . 
 Their first film , Magicians was released on 18 May 2007 . It was directed by Andrew O 'Connor and written by Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain . Mitchell played the role of a magician named Harry . Later in 2007 , the pair recorded a pilot BBC Radio 2 sitcom entitled Daydream Believers , in which Mitchell played Ray , a science @-@ fiction writer . The show was previously a one @-@ off television pilot from Channel 4 's Comedy Lab , and also starred Mitchell and Webb . 
 Mitchell and Webb 's first comedy book , This Mitchell and Webb Book , was published in 2009 . A second book is in preparation . They also wrote and filmed Playing Shop , a comedy television pilot for BBC2 about two men who operate a business out of their shed . Although the BBC commissioners were happy with it , Mitchell and Webb scrapped it themselves , as they felt it was too similar to Peep Show . A new pilot had been commissioned , but the plan was later shelved . Mitchell and Webb voiced a robotic duo in the Doctor Who episode " Dinosaurs on a Spaceship " in 2012 . 
 In 2007 the duo fronted the UK version of Apple Inc . ' s " Get a Mac " adverts , with Mitchell playing PC . The adverts received much criticism . Writing in The Guardian , Charlie Brooker claimed that the use of Mitchell and Webb in the adverts was a curious choice . He compared the characters of PC and Mac in the adverts to those of Mark and Jeremy in Peep Show , stating that " when you see the ads , you think , ' PCs are a bit rubbish yet ultimately lovable , whereas Macs are just smug , preening <unk> . ' " The British Sitcom Guide also criticised the pair for " selling their souls " . One journalist called the adverts " worse than not funny " , and accused Mitchell and Webb of " an act of grave betrayal " for taking corporate work . In an interview with The Telegraph , Robert Webb responded to the duo 's critics , stating that " when someone asks , ' Do you want to do some funny ads for not many days in the year and be paid more than you would be for an entire series of Peep Show ? ' the answer , obviously , is , ' Yeah , that 's fine . ' " In the same interview , Mitchell also said : " I don 't see what is morally inconsistent with a comedian doing an advert . It 's all right to sell computers , isn 't it ? Unless you think that capitalism is evil – which I don 't . It 's not like we 're helping to flog a baby @-@ killing machine . " 
 In 2005 , the duo were placed ninth on a list of the United Kingdom 's best television talent , and were named twelfth in a Radio Times list of the most powerful people in television comedy .

In 2005 he played Kate 's hapless secretary Tim in the BBC 's updating of The Taming of The Shrew in its <unk> @-@ Told series . Mitchell appeared as various roles on the Channel 4 sketch programme Blunder .

He portrayed the recurring character of Dr. James Vine in the BBC sitcom Jam and Jerusalem . Mitchell had a small part in the film I Could Never Be Your Woman , playing an English writer , also named David .

 He wrote for series five of the BBC2 impressionist sketch show Dead Ringers , and voiced Mitch in the Disney animated series Phineas and Ferb . He also narrated the reality show Beauty and the Geek . Following the success of Channel 4 's Alternative Election Night in 2010 , which Mitchell hosted with Jimmy Carr , Charlie Brooker and Lauren Laverne , the four presented 10 O 'Clock Live , a series of live shows looking at the week 's affairs . Mitchell has a solo segment entitled Listen to Mitchell . The show has run for three series . 
 Mitchell has presented four series of the online video show David Mitchell 's Soapbox , a series of short monologues co @-@ written with John <unk> for <unk> . In these monologues Mitchell has criticised a variety of subjects , including the BBC show Doctor Who and 3D television . Matt Warman of the Daily Telegraph suggested that the series could be a sign that new comedy will increasingly become available online , rather than on television . The series has been released on DVD . 
 He provided the voiceover for a £ 1 million government advert for <unk> , warning of the dangers of cocaine , as " Pablo the Drug Mule Dog " ; and also for the Driving Standards Agency 's " The Highway Code " . He writes columns for The Observer and The Guardian . He also took part in Channel 4 's Comedy Gala , a benefit show held in aid of Great Ormond Street Children 's Hospital at the O2 Arena .

 Mitchell has become a regular participant on many panel shows , leading The Independent 's James Rampton to christen him " if not king , then certainly prince regent of the panel games . " Mitchell is a team captain on the BBC panel show Would I Lie To You ? , opposite Lee Mack . The show has run since 2007 , airing nine series . Since 2006 , he has hosted fourteen series of The Unbelievable Truth , a panel game on BBC Radio 4 . The inaugural episode of Was It Something I Said ? , a panel comedy show that Mitchell hosts , was broadcast on Channel 4 in October 2013 .

 In a 2007 interview with Digital Spy , Mitchell stated that he enjoyed panel shows , as they are " a game worth playing " . He then further explained his appreciation of the panel format in response to criticism from Fast Show co @-@ creator Charlie Higson , who stated in September 2013 that panel comedies were overtaking television programming at the expense of sketch shows and sitcoms : 
 There was a quote from Catherine Zeta @-@ Jones about playing golf with her husband Michael Douglas . We essentially all started to imagine the scene of the two of them playing golf and that was very enjoyable and turned into a really fun bit of TV . It is moments like that which , for me , justify the existence of panel shows because no @-@ one would ever have written those words . It purely came out of that combination of people which proves panel shows can produce funny TV in a way you could never write into a sitcom or a sketch show and thereby justifies its place on screen . I think it is a great form of entertainment and we shouldn 't lose sight of that . 
 The Radio Times named him " The Best Comedy Panel Show Guest " in the world , stating that " he 's incredibly , disgustingly witty " and " even starting to make Paul Merton look slow on the uptake " . 
 Following his BAFTA win , Mitchell was ranked at No. 53 in the 2009 MediaGuardian 100 , an annual ranking of media people in The Guardian . In reference to his ubiquitous presence in broadcast and print media , The Guardian 's writer called him " the go @-@ to <unk> of the moment " . In their entry for Peep Show on their list of " The top 50 TV shows of the Noughties " , The Times labelled Mitchell " a national institution " .

 Mitchell 's favourite actor is Sir Alec Guinness , and he lists Spike Milligan , Peter Sellers and Peter Cook as his comedy idols . Additionally , following the death of British actor Richard Briers in February 2013 , Mitchell revealed that whenever he has acted he " always hoped to be something like him [ Briers ] " . Mitchell has also identified Morecambe and Wise , Monty Python and The Two Ronnies as highly influential on his career .

 Mitchell 's father was born in Liverpool of Scottish ancestry , and his mother is Welsh — Mitchell considers himself British rather than English . On 7 August 2014 , Mitchell 's name appeared — as part of a list of 200 signatories — in support of an open letter to The Guardian opposing Scottish independence prior to the September 2014 referendum on the issue . Mitchell 's participation in the open letter follows a May 2011 Observer column , in which he concludes that " the British will have lost their country " if Scotland ever achieves independence . 
 Mitchell has often joked about his personal life in interviews . In 2005 he stated he had " been in so many situations when I 've just said nothing to someone I 've fancied . " He later added that " I 'm sort of all right on my own . I don 't want it to be forever , but the fundamental thing is I 'm all right alone . " For many years he lived in Kilburn , London , as the flatmate of novelist Robert Hudson . In 2007 , he was best man at Robert Webb 's wedding to Abigail <unk> . 
 He first met broadcaster Victoria Coren at a showbusiness party in 2007 and was " completely smitten " , and although she decided to pursue someone else , he continued to pine for her . In December 2010 they began dating . In March 2012 their engagement was announced in The Times , and they married on 17 November 2012 . In May 2015 , Coren announced the birth of their daughter . 
 He remains interested in history and said in an interview with The Observer that " I can see myself in a few years ' time joining the National Trust and going round the odd castle . I think I might find that restful as the anger of middle age sets in . " In his interview on Parkinson he stated that if he could go back in time to do one thing , it would be to go to the building of Stonehenge , to ask them " why they were bothering " . He is a cricket and snooker fan , and also plays the occasional game of squash and tennis . He is a user of Twitter , and does not drive . He is an agnostic . 
 Mitchell walks for an hour each day to counter a bad back , and as a result lost weight , but he " probably [ has ] quite a bad diet " and " probably drinks too much .

 Fernando de la Rúa ( born September 15 , 1937 ) is an Argentine retired politician of the Radical Civic Union ( UCR ) who served as President of Argentina from December 10 , 1999 , to December 21 , 2001 . De la Rúa was born in Córdoba ; he entered politics after graduating with a degree in law . He was elected senator in 1973 and unsuccessfully ran for the office of Vice President as Ricardo Balbín 's running mate the same year . In 1993 , he was re @-@ elected senator in 1983 and 1993 , and as deputy in 1991 . He unsuccessfully opposed the pact of Olivos between President Carlos Menem and party leader Raúl Alfonsín , which enabled the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution and the re @-@ election of Menem in 1995 . 
 De la Rúa was the first chief of government of Buenos Aires to be elected by popular vote , a change introduced by the amendment of the Constitution . He expanded the Buenos Aires Underground , adding new stations to Line D , starting the expansion of Line B , and establishing Line H. He established Roberto Goyeneche Avenue and the city 's first bicycle path . 
 In 1999 , De la Rúa was elected President after running on the Alliance ticket , a political coalition of the UCR and the Frepaso . He was opposed by the Peronist unions and his Vice President Carlos Álvarez resigned after denouncing bribes in the Senate . The economic crisis that began during Menem 's administration worsened and by the end of 2001 led to a banking panic . The government established the <unk> to limit bank withdrawals . De la Rúa called a state of emergency during the December 2001 riots . He resigned on December 20 , and the Congress appointed a new President . As of April 2016 , he is retired from politics and facing legal proceedings . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Fernando de la Rúa is the son of Eleonora Bruno and Antonio De la Rúa ; he was born in the city of Córdoba and attended the local Military Lyceum before entering the National University of Córdoba , from which he graduated with a law degree at the age of 21 . He married a Buenos Aires socialite , Inés <unk> , in 1970 ; they had three children , including Antonio de la Rúa . De la Rúa became involved in politics at a young age ; he entered public service in 1963 as an advisor to President Arturo Illia 's minister Juan <unk> . 
 He was elected senator in the March 1973 general elections , defeating the Peronist Marcelo Sánchez <unk> . He was the only politician from the Radical Civic Union ( UCR ) who could defeat the Peronist candidate in his administrative division . The elected president Héctor José Cámpora and his vice president resigned a few months later , leading to the call to new elections . Ricardo Balbín ran for president in the September general elections , with De la Rúa as his running mate for the post of vice president . The UCR was defeated by Juan Perón by a landslide . De la Rúa was removed from the Congress during the 1976 Argentine coup d 'état . He left politics and worked as a lawyer for the firm Bunge y Born . 
 The National Reorganization Process ended in 1983 . De la Rúa intended to run for president but lost in the primary elections of the UCR to Raúl Alfonsín , who was elected in the general election . De la Rúa ran for the post of senator instead , defeating the Peronist Carlos Ruckauf . He ran for re @-@ election as senator in 1989 but , despite of his electoral victory , the electoral college voted for the Peronist Eduardo Vaca . De la Rúa was elected deputy in 1991 and returned to the senate in 1993 . President Carlos Menem , elected in 1989 , wanted to amend the constitution to allow him to run for re @-@ election in 1995 , which was opposed by the UCR . Alfonsín signed the Pact of Olivos with Menem , negotiating terms to support the proposal . De la Rúa led the opposition to the pact within the UCR , but Alfonsín prevailed in the internal dispute . This damaged the relationship between both leaders , but helped the party to retain a number of radicals who were against the pact . De la Rúa could not prevent the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution . As a result , Menem was re @-@ elected in 1995 . The UCR finished third in the elections for the first time , being surpassed by the Frepaso , a new party composed by former Peronists .

 The constitutional amendment gave autonomy to the city of Buenos Aires , allowing it to sanction local laws and elect its own mayor , who was previously appointed by the president of the nation . De la Rúa was the first mayor elected in this manner , defeating the previous mayor Jorge Domínguez . During his term of office he created or reformulated several institutions to fit the new status of the city , as required by the national constitution and the recently approved Constitution of Buenos Aires . 
 De la Rúa worked on the expansion of the Buenos Aires Underground . The first stations of the extended Line D , <unk> and José Hernández , were opened in 1997 , Juramento was opened in 1999 , and Congreso de Tucumán in 2000 . He also started the works to extend the Line B. Carlos Menem started to transfer the control and financing of the underground system to the city , but the 2001 economic crisis halted the process . 
 The former mayor Domínguez intended to expand the Pan @-@ American Highway into Saavedra , but the project met widespread opposition . De la Rúa reformulated the project and built an avenue instead of a highway , which was accepted . The avenue was named Roberto Goyeneche . He also restarted a project to build the Cámpora Highway linking <unk> Avenue with the Riachuelo , and established the first non @-@ recreational bikeway in Buenos Aires at Avenida del Libertador .

 The Pact of Olivos diminished the electoral strength of the UCR , leading to the rise of the Frepaso . Both parties united in a political coalition , the Alliance , which defeated the PJ in the 1997 midterm elections . It was the PJ 's first national defeat since 1985 . The parties held open primary elections for the 1999 presidential elections . De la Rúa stood for the UCR ; the whole party , including Alfonsín , supported him . The Frepaso candidate was Graciela Fernández Meijide , who had defeated Peronism in the populous Buenos Aires province . De la Rúa won the primary elections by a wide margin . In the primaries , De la Rúa was voted for by more people than those who voted for the UCR in 1995 . Despite his victory , Alfonsín was still the president of the UCR . They disagreed on the vice president for De la Rúa 's ticket ; he thought that it should be Meijide because she took part in the primary elections and came from a different district than him . Alfonsín preferred the popular Carlos Álvarez , leader of the Frepaso , saying he could attract more voters and had more political expertise . It was also a result of the internal politics of the Alliance : except for Meijide , the Frepaso did not have a political figure who may run with good chances for governor of the Buenos Aires province . Had she run for <unk> , Frepaso would have had to resign that candidacy to a radical candidate . 
 Carlos Menem dismissed De la Rúa as a " boring " candidate . De la Rúa exploited that description in television advertisements , embracing it and setting a comparison with the glitzy style of Menem and the perceived political corruption of his administration . He also compared himself with the Peronist candidate Eduardo Duhalde . He promised to solve the economic crisis with fiscal austerity and higher tax controls , hoping it would lower interest rates , bring more foreign investments , and reduce unemployment . He also promised to keep the Convertibility plan established by Menem that pegged the Argentine Peso one @-@ to @-@ one with the United States dollar . 
 The 1999 presidential election was held on October 24 . De la Rúa defeated Duhalde by 48 @.@ 4 % to 38 @.@ 3 % , well ahead of the threshold to avoid a ballotage election . Domingo Cavallo , Menem 's former minister of economy , finished the race in third place . De la Rúa was inaugurated President of Argentina on December 10 , 1999 . He took office with a favorability rating of 75 % . Unlike Menem , whose initial cabinet was composed by trusted friends , De la Rúa 's cabinet included five people with international degrees , and four economists .

 In the first days of his presidency , De la Rúa sent a bill to the Congress to request a federal intervention in Corrientes Province . The province had a high level of debt , and organizations of piqueteros blocked roads to make demonstrations . There were two interim governors disputing power . The bill was immediately approved . The <unk> selected for the work was Ramón Mestre . 
 The Peronist unions opposed De la Rúa and held seven general strikes against him . He sent a bill known as the labour flexibility law to deregulate labor conditions , attempting to reduce the political influence of unions , to the Congress . This project was opposed by the PJ and was changed from the original draft . It was finally approved but Álvarez said several legislators were bribed to support the bill . Álvarez asked for the removal of the labor minister Alberto <unk> , but De la Rúa instead promoted him to be his personal secretary . Álvarez resigned the following day and the political scandal divided the coalition . Several <unk> who initially supported De la Rúa switched to the opposition . Alfonsín tried to prevent a breakup of the UCR . Some months later , it was proposed that Álvarez returned as Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers ; he initially supported the idea but De la Rúa opposed it . Cavallo was also proposed for the office before he was appointed Minister of Economy . De la Rúa intended to include the Frepaso in the new cabinet but to exclude Álvarez himself because he still resented the latter 's resignation . The negotiations failed and the new cabinet included no Frepaso politicians , but the Alliance was still working as a coalition in the Congress . It also included several radical politicians from Alfonsín 's internal faction . The new Chief of Cabinet was <unk> Colombo , who mediated between Alfonsín and the president . 
 The PJ won the 2001 midterm election by 40 % to 24 % , giving it a majority in both chambers of the Congress . However , the abstention rate and several forms of protest votes combined reached 41 % , the highest in Argentine history , as a consequence of the popular discontent with the two main parties . Even the few candidates of the Alliance who won at their districts , such as the radical Rodolfo Terragno in Buenos Aires , did so with political platforms against De la Rúa 's administration . 
 = = = Foreign policy = = = 
 The first year of De la Rúa 's presidency coincided with the last year of Bill Clinton 's presidency of the United States . Ricardo Lopez Murphy , Minister of Defense at the time , met William Cohen , U.S. Secretary of Defense , in a summit of ministers that took place in Brazil in 2000 . Both countries agreed to share classified information and to hold joint operations against terrorism . 
 George W. Bush took office in January 2001 , and changed the American policy towards countries in financial crises . The Treasury Secretary Paul H. O 'Neill , a critic of financial aids , said , " We 're working to find a way to create a sustainable Argentina , not just one that continues to consume the money of the plumbers and carpenters in the United States who make $ 50 @,@ 000 a year and wonder what in the world we 're doing with their money " . The September 11 attacks occurred a few months later , and the U.S. focused its foreign policy on the War on Terror against countries suspected of harboring terrorist organizations . As a result , the U.S. gave no further financial aid to Argentina . This policy was confirmed after an interview of Bush with the Brazilian president , Fernando Henrique Cardoso , who confirmed Brazil would not be affected by the Argentine crisis . 
 = = = Economic policy = = = 
 De la Rúa 's first Minister of Economy was the <unk> José Luis Machinea , who was proposed by Alfonsín and Álvarez . Menem had left a deficit of 5 Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) points that Machinea tried to compensate with higher taxes to people with the highest incomes , and a reduction of the highest retirement pensions . The deficit was reduced but the crisis continued . The scandal over the labor law and the resignation of Álvarez increased the country risk , and made Argentina 's access to international credit more difficult . The government negotiated a US $ 38 billion International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) line of credit to prevent a default and allow the economy to grow again . Machinea also proposed to appoint the former minister Cavallo as the new president of the Central Bank of Argentina . However , Machinea was unable to achieve the levels of austerity negotiated with the IMF and resigned a few days later . The Minister of Defense Ricardo López Murphy became the new Minister of Economy . During the election <unk> , De la Rúa had promised not to appoint him to that ministry , but with the ongoing crisis he did not want to risk problems caused by a temporary lack of minister . López Murphy announced a stricter austerity plan , with reduction to the health and education budgets . His plan was rejected by street demonstrations and the Frepaso , so De la Rúa declined it . Murphy resigned after being minister for 16 days . 
 De la Rúa appointed Cavallo , who had served under Menem and had established the convertibility plan . He was supported by the PJ , Carlos Álvarez , and the financial groups , but he was rejected by the rest of the UCR . The government announced it would retain the convertibility plan and that there would be no devaluation or sovereign default . Cavallo proposed several bills ; De la Rúa sent them to the Congress and they were approved . The " superpowers law " authorized the chief of government to modify the national budget without the intervention of the Congress . There was a new tax on bank operations and more products attracted value @-@ added tax . The wages of national customs workers were increased and some industries benefited from tax exemptions . The <unk> was a negotiation to delay the payment of foreign debt in exchange for higher interest rates . However , internal debt was still a problem because the provinces , especially Buenos Aires Province , were nearing default . This led to conflicts between Cavallo and the provincial governors . The Congress approved a bill for a " Zero deficit " policy to prevent further increases of debt and to work only with money from tax revenue . There was a banking panic in November ; the government reacted by introducing the " <unk> " , which prevented people from withdrawing cash from banks . It was initially a temporary measure . The IMF refused to send the monthly payment for the line of credit approved at the beginning of the year because the government had not stuck to the " zero deficit " policy . 
 = = = Riots and resignation = = = 
 The crisis worsened and by December 19 , 2001 , riots and looting broke out at several points in the country . De la Rúa announced in a <unk> nacional ( national network broadcast ) that he established a state of emergency . The riots continued ; his speech was followed by increased protests , the cacerolazos , which caused 27 deaths and thousands of injuries . Cavallo resigned at midnight the same day , and the rest of the cabinet followed suit . 
 There was increased looting on December 20 , both in Buenos Aires and the <unk> . The cacerolazos continued ; large groups of people started demonstrations calling for the government 's resignation . The unions — first the CTA and then the CGT — began general strikes against the state of emergency . Most of the UCR withdrew their support to De la Rúa , so he asked the PJ to create a government coalition . The PJ refused , and De la Rúa resigned from government . His last administrative action was to lift the state of emergency . He gave his resignation to the Congress at 19 : 45 local time on December 20 , 2001 , and left the Casa Rosada in a helicopter . He had ruled for two years , half of his term of office . 
 Because Vice president Carlos Álvarez had already resigned , the Congress convened to appoint a new president . Adolfo Rodríguez Saá , governor of the San Luis Province , was in office for two months while calling for new presidential elections . Renewed demonstrations forced him to resign as well , and Eduardo Duhalde was appointed as the new president . He was able to complete De la Rúa 's term of office . 
 = = Later life = = 
 De la Rúa retired from political life after his resignation . The scandal over the labor flexibility law was renewed in 2003 when a former Senate worker , Mario <unk> , claimed to be a witness of the case who delivered $ 5 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 to the legislators . De la Rúa was indicted alongside seven politicians from both the UCR and the PJ . In 2013 , they were all cleared of charges by a unanimous resolution , and <unk> was removed from the witness protection program . 
 De la Rúa was also indicted for the police repression that took place during the crisis ; he was tried by judge <unk> <unk> , who declared him innocent in 2009 . The Supreme Court overturned <unk> 's ruling and ordered him to further investigate the matter . De la Rúa and Cavallo were indicted for illegally benefiting the banks that took part in the <unk> . They were declared innocent on October 6 , 2014 . 
 = = Public image = = 
 De la Rúa started to work in politics from a very young age . He was nicknamed " <unk> " ( Spanish : " Pacifier " ) because of this ; the nickname was still used when he grew up . During Carlos Menem 's administration he was perceived as a serious and formal politician , in stark contrast with Menem 's style . De la Rúa took advantage of this perception during the electoral campaign of 1999 . When he became president and the economic crisis worsened , he was perceived as a weak and tired man who was unable to react to the crisis . He was perceived as a man without leadership who could not make use of his presidential authority . De la Rúa considers that the parody of the television comedian Freddy Villarreal helped to establish that image . He sought to change his image by appearing on the television comedy show El show de <unk> , but it backfired . He confused the names of the show and that of the host Marcelo Tinelli 's wife . After De la Rúa 's participation ended , Tinelli began to close the program ; De la Rúa could be seen seeking an exit from the set in the background . The popular image was further strengthened when he was hospitalized for peripheral artery disease caused by high blood cholesterol . Although it is a standard , simple medical intervention , the medic told the press De la Rúa suffered from arteriosclerosis , which is usually linked with a lack of speed and reflexes .
