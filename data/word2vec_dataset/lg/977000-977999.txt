 In 2009 , Sesame Street celebrated its 40th anniversary . It was the fifteenth @-@ highest rated children 's television show in the United States and had won 8 Grammy Awards and over 100 Emmy Awards — more than any other children 's show . By 2006 , there were independently produced versions , or " co @-@ productions " , of Sesame Street broadcast in twenty countries . In 2001 there were over 120 million viewers of these international versions , and by 2009 , it was broadcast in more than 140 countries . A 1996 survey found that 95 % of all American preschoolers had watched the show by the time they were three years old . In 2008 , it was estimated that 77 million Americans had watched the series as children .

 Prologue : A description of the funeral of Muppet creator Jim Henson in New York City in 1990 , from the viewpoint of Joan Ganz Cooney , one of the creators of Sesame Street . 
 Chapters 1 — 12 : The origins and development of the show and the creation of the Children 's Television Workshop ( CTW ) . Sesame Street was created after a dinner party hosted by Cooney and her husband in early 1966 , attended by Carnegie Foundation vice @-@ president Lloyd Morrisett and Cooney 's boss at New York City educational television station WNDT , Lewis Freedman . The discussion inspired them to create a children 's television program , different than what was offered at the time , that could " master the addictive qualities of television " and help young children , especially from low @-@ income families , learn and prepare for school . Davis includes the biographies of key players in the show 's development : Cooney , Morrisett , Jon Stone , Sam Gibbon , Tom Whedon , Jim Henson , Caroll Spinney , Gerald S. Lesser , Edward Palmer , Joe Raposo , Loretta Long , Bob McGrath , Will Lee , and Matt Robinson . There is also a discussion of the history of early children 's television ; specifically , Captain Kangaroo and The Howdy Doody Show . Davis emphasizes the coincidence that many involved with the show had first names that started with the letter J : Joan Cooney , Jon Stone , Jim Henson , Jerry Nelson , and Joe Raposo . 
 Chapter 13 ( " Intermission " ) : A description of the first episode of Sesame Street , which debuted on PBS on November 10 , 1969 . As Davis states , " To see that first episode today — and the four succeeding ones in Sesame 's first week — is to be transported back to 1969 " . The first show was sponsored by the letters W , S , and E and by the numbers 2 and 3 . 
 Chapter 14 : The influence of Sesame Street during its first season , and a description of its success and critics . 
 Chapter 15 — 16 : The 1970s . These chapters include a description of the production team , the cast who joined the show , and the Muppets that were created during this time . The biographies that Davis depicts are of producer Dulcy Singer , Christopher Cerf , Sonia Manzano , Northern Calloway , Emilio Delgado , Linda Bove , Richard Hunt , and Fran Brill . The Muppet characters Cookie Monster and Roosevelt Franklin were also created during these years . Davis describes the music of Sesame Street , Jim Henson 's struggle with fame , the end of Cooney 's marriage , and CTW 's funding difficulties . 
 Chapter 17 : The late 70s and 1980s . Davis describes the production of the show 's first special ( Christmas Eve on Sesame Street ) , the <unk> and death of Calloway , the death of Lee and the groundbreaking way Sesame Street dealt with it , the creation of Elmo and biography of his portrayer , Kevin Clash , and the wedding of Maria and Luis . Davis calls the show 's depiction of Mr. Hooper 's death and the wedding " the poles that held up the canvas tent that was Sesame Street in the 1980s , a reflection of the sometimes silly , sometimes sad , always surprising , relentlessly spinning cyclical circus of life " . The biography of Alison Bartlett @-@ O 'Reilly is also described . 
 Chapter 18 : The 1990s and 2000s . This chapter describes the cast 's responses to the deaths of Calloway , Henson , Raposo , Connell , and Stone . It discusses Henson 's business dealings with Disney in 1990 , a few months before Henson 's death , and Sesame Street 's ratings decrease . In 1993 , the show went through substantial changes in response to the show 's decline ( " Around the Corner " ) ; the only thing that ultimately survived this restructuring of the show was the Muppet character Zoe , performed by Brill . There were also attempts to include more female Muppet characters . Davis discusses the " Tickle Me Elmo " phenomenon of Christmas 1996 , Avenue Q , " Elmo 's World " , and the character Mr. Noodle . 
 Epilogue : Davis ends his book as he begins it , focusing on Joan Ganz Cooney , during her retirement years . He also discusses the development of Sesame Street 's newest character , Abby Cadabby , and the show 's international influence . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Judith Fitzgerald of The Philadelphia Inquirer , who predicts that Street Gang will become the definitive source of the show , calls " a compulsively readable compendium of all things Sesame Street " , as well as informative , heartbreaking , hilarious , and eye @-@ opening " . She credits its complicated and often funny story with the cooperation Davis received from Cooney when writing his book . Fitzgerald also praises Davis , calling him " a sensitive and subtly brilliant writer who conveys the soul of the program " . Reviewer Drew Toal calls Street Gang a " swift narrative " and " a sensitive , honest account " , and credits the large amount of cast stories and controversy recounted in the book with the hundreds of interviews Davis conducted . Frazier Moore of the Associated Press states that the book is a fascinating account of the creation of Sesame Street , and that Davis writes thoroughly and with affection . 
 James Panero , reviewer for The New York Times , called Street Gang a " behind the lens story " and the " first comprehensive account " of Sesame Street . Panero found Davis ' history tireless , but objected to Davis ' emphasis on unimportant details . As a result , and due to Davis ' inclusion of every anecdote and biography of everyone involved with its creation and history , Panero considers the book an oral history rather than a tightly organized narrative . Other reviewers note that Street Gang is too much like its subject , episodic and unfocused . Diana Wagman of The L.A. Times states that Davis choice of what to focus on is odd ; for example , there is a great deal of focus in the book on things like the licensing and merchandising agreement of the Muppets , but very little attention on Mississippi 's 1970 ban of the show . Wagman states , " Yes , we get a little past @-@ tense womanizing , a lot of drinking and a psychotic breakdown later in the book , but it all seems sad , not salacious , and not germane to the basic story " . Nick Gillespie of The Washington Post agrees . He calls Jim Henson , who is mentioned often in the book , " an almost completely enigmatic character " . 
 Wagman takes issue with the way Davis moves from topic to topic and time period to time period . Davis gives long personal histories of the principal players in his history , but fails to explain the reason they are important , and is compelled to repeat every positive claim made about Sesame Street . In spite of this , Wagman states , Davis demonstrates the love and respect Cooney and the show 's cast and crew had for each another . For example , when Calloway was diagnosed with a mental illness , the show never fired him , and Wagman calls Henson 's funeral " heartbreaking " . Gillespie finds the " nasty backstage wrangling " and behind @-@ the @-@ scenes stories compelling . Alex Altman of Time Magazine agrees , and calls Davis " an unabashed fan of the show 's charms rather than a dispassionate historian " . He also considers Davis ' use of language breathless and his portrayals of the show 's creators overly flattering . 
 Reviewer Molly O 'Donnell states that the book is " broad in scope yet exercises a meticulous attention to detail " . O 'Donnell views Davis as balanced in his account because although Davis praises Sesame Street , he describes the public criticism the show has received and relates the personality flaws of the people who helped create it . Even with the book 's lulls , which O 'Donnell attributes to the large amount of personal histories Davis has to tell to give a complete picture of the show 's creation , she says that the book is interesting . The reviewer from Publishers Weekly agrees , praising Street Gang as continuously interesting , honest , and well @-@ researched . The reviewer goes on to state , " Any grown @-@ up fan will relish this account , gaining an even greater appreciation for the cultural contributions of Kermit , Big Bird , Oscar the Grouch and all their neighbors " .

 The publication of the book was announced in 2006 by the television industry trade magazine Broadcasting and Cable , which anticipated a buzz about the project . The magazine stated , " A dozen of New York ’ s top publishers are eager to get their hands this week on the story of how Sesame Street emerged as the iconic program that shaped the minds of countless kiddies around the globe " . 
 The audio version of Street Gang was released at the same time as the book , narrated by Caroll Spinney . 
 = It Came from the Nightosphere = 
 " It Came from the Nightosphere " is the first episode of the second season of the American animated television series Adventure Time . The episode was written and storyboarded by Adam Muto and Rebecca Sugar , from a story by Merriwether Williams , Steve Little , Patrick McHale , Pendleton Ward , and Thurop Van Orman . It originally aired on Cartoon Network on October 11 , 2010 . The episode guest stars Martin Olson as Marceline the Vampire Queen 's father Hunson Abadeer . Olson would reprise his role in the series ' third and fourth seasons . 
 The series follows the adventures of Finn ( voiced by Jeremy Shada ) , a human boy , and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake ( voiced by John DiMaggio ) , a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will . In this episode , Finn releases Marceline 's dad from the Nightosphere after Marceline ( voiced by Olivia Olson ) sings a song about the relationship between her and her estranged father . However , Finn — who is begrudgingly aided by an emotionally enraged Marceline — is forced to stop him from stealing all the souls in Ooo . 
 " It Came from the Nightosphere " was the first episode written and storyboarded by Sugar ; she would go on to be highly praised for her work on the series . The episode was watched by 2 @.@ 001 million people and received largely positive critical attention . In addition , the episode was nominated for a 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short @-@ format Animated Program , although the episode did not win . 
 = = Plot = = 
 After Finn agrees to help Marceline record one of her musical compositions , she begins to sing a song — " The Fry Song " — about the rift between herself and her father , Hunson Abadeer . Finn , feeling sorry for her , decides to summon her father from the hellish Nightosphere , failing to realize that her father is the domain 's dark leader and that he consumes souls . He materializes before Marceline and Finn , attempts to kill Finn , and successfully steals Marceline 's axe bass . Finn and Marceline give chase . 
 Marceline 's father moves throughout Ooo , consuming the souls of all living creatures that he can find . Finn and Marceline first try to crush him with a rock , but the resulting skirmish between father and daughter merely infuriates Hunson Abadeer . He assumes that Marceline is trying to kill him to take over the Nightosphere , but she merely wants her bass guitar back . 
 Finn and Marceline attempt one last time to stop Hunson Abadeer , who has now grown huge . Due to his size , Finn is easily defeated . Marceline , infuriated by her father 's lack of understanding , storms off . Finn , in a last @-@ ditch effort to save the day , plays back the recording of " The Fry Song " . Suddenly , Marceline 's father understands why she is upset , and the two reconnect . Finn uses this beat as an opportunity to cut all of the souls free from Hunson Abadeer 's " soul sack " , and banishes him back to the Nightosphere .

 " It Came from the Nightosphere " was written and storyboarded by Adam Muto and Rebecca Sugar , from a story by Merriwether Williams , Steve Little , Patrick McHale , Pendleton Ward , and Thurop Van Orman . The episode was the first episode storyboarded by Sugar ; according to her , she " did all the monster stuff at the end " , whereas Muto " did all the meat in the middle " . She later joked that " anything that is actually witty was done by Adam . I ’ m usually responsible for sex jokes and violence . " During the storyboarding process , Sugar and Muto were running low on time , As such , Muto asked fellow series artist Jesse Moynihan if he could help storyboard the initial fight between Marceline and her father . The final scene with Abadeer , which featured Finn cutting open his " soul sack " was added by Sugar based on a drawing by Ward that featured Finn flying through the air with two swords . However , she was not sure if the scene would make it into the final product due to its graphic nature . A scene that features Marceline 's dad confronting Gunter the penguin inspired the writers to pen the fourth season episode " Reign of <unk> " . 
 The song features " The Fry Song " , co @-@ written by Ward and Sugar . This was her first song written for the series , and would go on to become popular with the fanbase of Adventure Time . Sugar 's original version was inspired by Broadway theatre and was more sombre . Ward helped Sugar add more jokes to the final version . During the network pitch of the episode , Ward beatboxed and Sugar played ukulele and the two performed " The Fry Song " . Sugar later called the experience " super terrifying " , although the network did green @-@ light the episode . The episode was the third episode of the season produced , but was chosen to be the first aired . When the network announced the start of season two , the episode was not finished . On his personal website , executive producer Fred Seibert noted that he would " prefer [ that the series ] stock up on a few episodes before jumping into season two , but it ain ’ t my network " . Seibert also felt that the episode was rather frightening and warned potential watchers that it might not be suitable for younger children . 
 Martin Olson , the father of Olivia Olson who voices Marceline , provides the voice for Marceline 's demonic father Hunson Abadeer . A year after the series had been cast , Ward approached Olson and asked him if he wanted to voice a character on the show . Olson was apprehensive at first , arguing that he was not an actor but a writer , instead . Ward insisted and Olson eventually relented . Olson later joked that he was " in heaven " during the recording of the dialogue because the episode featured him " fighting to the death with [ his ] daughter . " Olson later noted that the opportunity to voice act with her father was " pretty cool ” . Olson would make a cameo in the third season episode " Memory of a Memory " , and would be featured in a major role in the fourth season two @-@ part episode " Return to the Nightosphere " / " Daddy 's Little Monster " . 
 The design for Abadeer 's monster form caused issues with the series ' standards and practices department . The initial designs were deemed " too vagina @-@ like " , and the network made the show redesign the character again . However , during the second submission , the network felt that it looked " too much like a penis " . Ward later said , " We were just like , ' What is happening ? This is a monster , with just a crazy , weird face . ' " " It Came from the Nightosphere " does not reveal Abadeer 's name , with characters merely referring to him as " Marceline 's Dad " . His full name would not be revealed until in the two @-@ part fourth season episode . According to Moynihan , the name was inspired by the name that his brother had given their family 's car when they were growing up . The two later used it for a band that only recorded one song .

 " It Came from the Nightosphere " first aired on Cartoon Network on October 11 , 2010 . The episode was viewed by 2 @.@ 001 million viewers and scored a Nielsen rating of 1 @.@ 3 / 2 percent . This means it was seen by 1 @.@ 3 percent of all households and 2 percent of all households watching television at the time of the episode 's airing . This marked a decline from the first season premiere , which had been viewed by 2 @.@ 5 million viewers , but it marked an increase from the first season finale , which was watched by only 1 @.@ 77 million viewers . " It Came from the Nightosphere " also marked gains when compared to the same timeslot a year prior ; for instance , 732 @,@ 000 kids aged 6 – 11 watched the episode , an increase by 35 percent when compared to the previous year . 
 " It Came from the Nightosphere " was highly praised by critics . Tyler Foster of DVD Talk called it " a pretty decent example of all the notes the show can hit . " He was particularly pleased with the way " the rift between Marceline and her dad is handled with a nice seriousness that fits right in alongside absurd gags about penguins " . He also noted that " any episode that includes a song is a plus in my book . " It was also called the " real highlight " of the eponymous DVD release by Charles Webb of MTV Geek . IGN writer Matt Fowler later referred to the episode as a " classic " . In a separate review , he later wrote that the episode " has come to represent the best of Adventure Time , and Marceline 's [ sic ] , with her angst @-@ y anti @-@ daddy song and her Freddy Krueger @-@ esque sweater has launched a thousand cosplays . " Writers of Spin ranked " The Fry Song " as the forty @-@ fourth best original song performed by fictional characters in any medium . James Grebey called its subject matter deep and from a place of uncontrolled emotion , mature but also eccentric . 
 Ward was very happy with the episode . He complimented storyboard artists Muto and Sugar , saying that the former " has a hilarious slapstick set @-@ up @-@ the @-@ punchline kind of style of comedy " and the latter " is amazing at executing these super romantic , emotional goosebump @-@ kind of feelings " . He was particularly pleased with the ending , noting that " I love that goose @-@ bumps feeling in a climactic scene with music rising . In that episode you 're talking about , there is that rising action toward the end , and then <unk> [ … ] cuts in and says ' drama bomb ! ' in the middle of it to sort of , like , cut its legs out .

 = L 'Enfant Plaza Hotel = 
 The L 'Enfant Plaza Hotel is a hotel located in downtown Washington , D.C. , in the United States . It was designed by architect Vlastimil Koubek , and named after Pierre Charles L 'Enfant , the first surveyor and designer of the street layout of the city . It was inaugurated on May 31 , 1973 . The hotel is listed as a Mobile 4 @-@ star and AAA 4 @-@ Diamond Luxury Hotel . 
 The L 'Enfant Plaza Hotel sits atop L 'Enfant Plaza , an esplanade and plaza structure erected above a highway and a parking garage in the Southwest quadrant of the District of Colombia . The plaza and hotel were approved in 1955 , but construction did not begin on the plaza ( on which the hotel sits ) until 1965 . The plaza and esplanade were completed in 1968 . The start of construction on the hotel was delayed three years , and was completed in May 1973 . The construction led to a lawsuit after it was found that the foundation of an adjoining structure had encroached on the hotel 's property . The hotel suffered a serious fire in 1975 that claimed the lives of two people . 
 L 'Enfant Plaza Corp. , which owned the hotel , sold the structure to Sarakreek Holdings in 1998 , which in turn sold it to the JBG Companies in 2003 . A legal battle ensued over the hotel 's ownership . The hotel 's long @-@ time operator , Loews Hotels , was replaced by Crestline Hotels & Resorts in 2005 , which was in turn replaced by the Davidson Hotel Company in 2010 . The L 'Enfant Plaza Hotel features 372 guest rooms , 36 larger " Executive Rooms " , and several suites on the top four floors of a 12 @-@ story mixed @-@ use building . The hotel has two main restaurants and two bars among its many amenities . 
 The L 'Enfant Plaza Hotel closed on December 3 , 2013 , for what was to be a year @-@ long overhaul and upgrade of the entire property . In January 2014 , the reopening date was moved to some time in 2015 .

 In 1946 , the United States Congress passed the District of Columbia Redevelopment Act , which established the District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency and provided for clearance of land and redevelopment funds in the capital . After a decade of discussion , public comment , legal battles , and negotiations with landowners and developers , the Southwest Urban Renewal Plan was approved in November 1956 . New York City developer William Zeckendorf proposed a grand mall along 10th Street SW , extending from Independence Avenue SW to end at a traffic circle at G Street SW . Zeckendorf named this mall L 'Enfant Plaza after Pierre Charles L 'Enfant , an architect responsible for planning the city of Washington . L 'Enfant Plaza was approved for construction in April 1955 . In December 1959 , Zeckendorf won approval to build a 1 @,@ 000 @-@ room hotel and five privately owned office buildings on L 'Enfant Plaza . The Redevelopment Land Agency also approved the condemnation and razing of 14 city blocks for construction of the plaza , hotel , and office buildings . Construction was to have begun on January 1 , 1961 , but was delayed due to unresolved design issues with L 'Enfant Promenade , the short time @-@ frame to prepare detailed construction plans , and because Congress had not granted air rights above 9th Street SW to the developers . 
 Construction of L 'Enfant Plaza and the hotel were then delayed another decade . Zeckendorf agreed to build the promenade , plaza , and all surrounding buildings as a single project in April 1961 and to pay $ 20 per 1 square foot ( 0 @.@ 093 m2 ) . These pledges led the Redevelopment Land Agency to award the 14 @-@ block area to Zeckendorf in October 1961 for $ 7 million . By this time , although the hotel had retained its size , the number of office buildings had shrunk from eight to three . Zeckendorf added an underground shopping mall of shops and restaurants to the project in November 1962 , and construction on the promenade and plaza was to have begun in April 1963 . But Zeckendorf 's vast real estate empire began to suffer severe financial difficulties in 1964 , eventually going bankrupt the following year . With Zeckendorf unable to make good on his construction pledges , the Redevelopment Land Agency forced him to withdraw and sell his interest in L 'Enfant Plaza in November 1964 . 
 The buyer of Zeckendorf 's property and leases was the L 'Enfant Plaza Corp. ( also known as L 'Enfant Properties ) . L 'Enfant Plaza Corp. was a syndicate led by former United States Air Force Lieutenant General Elwood R. Quesada , and included Chase Manhattan Bank president David Rockefeller , D.C. businessman David A. Garrett , investment banker André Meyer , and the real estate investment firm Gerry Brothers & Co . Quesada said that if the Redevelopment Land Agency approved the sale , it would begin immediate construction of the promenade , the 1 @,@ 400 @-@ car parking garage beneath it , and the plaza . The agency gave its approval on January 21 , 1965 . The sale was final on August 30 . 
 Site preparation for L 'Enfant promenade and plaza began in November 1965 . Air rights over 9th Street SW were granted for a rent of $ 500 per year for 99 years on November 23 , 1965 . The actual groundbreaking for L 'Enfant Plaza occurred on December 9 but the project was still hindered by delays . The federal government was building the James V. Forrestal Building at the northern end of L 'Enfant promenade , and the whole northern end of the promenade and the associated roadway was a year behind its construction schedule by June 1967 . Meanwhile , over @-@ optimistic construction schedules and labor shortages meant L 'Enfant Plaza Corp 's building of the North and South buildings were six months behind projected schedules . The $ 23 million complex neared completion in January 1968 , and the office buildings , plaza , and promenade opened to the public and businesses in June 1968 . The plaza was formally dedicated on Saturday , November 16 , 1968 . 
 The west office building and the hotel remained to be built , at a cost of $ 40 million . Construction on the 640 @,@ 000 square feet ( 59 @,@ 000 m2 ) West Building and 730 @-@ car parking garage ( designed by D.C. architect Vlastimil Koubek ) began on February 18 , 1969 . 
 = = = Building the hotel = = = 
 Construction on the Modernist hotel was to have started in the spring of 1970 . However , construction on the 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 square feet ( 93 @,@ 000 m2 ) , $ 23 million hotel and office building did not begin until June 1971 . The Loews Hotels chain agreed to co @-@ finance construction of the property with L 'Enfant Plaza Corp. , although details of the agreement were not provided . The hotel would occupy the top four floors and lobby of the 12 @-@ story building , with separate elevators for office tenants and hotel guests . The 378 @-@ room hotel , designed by Koubek , had a rooftop swimming pool , two restaurants , a cocktail lounge , and meeting rooms . The general contractor for the building was George Hyman Construction Co . ( now Clark Construction Group ) . 
 A major problem emerged during the hotel 's construction . The Robert C. Weaver Federal Building , headquarters of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) , had been constructed on a Redevelopment Land Agency site in November 1965 . John <unk> , Inc . , one of the largest federal building contractors in the Washington metro area , was the lead construction contractor . During the HUD building 's construction , the footings for the western portion of the building were accidentally built 1 @.@ 5 to 3 @.@ 5 feet ( 0 @.@ 46 to 1 @.@ 07 m ) over the property line . The 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) -thick footings for the HUD building were 23 feet ( 7 @.@ 0 m ) underground . L 'Enfant Plaza Corp. sued John <unk> , Inc. and the Redevelopment Land Agency for removal of the footings , stabilization of the HUD structure , and associated costs . The action spawned several lengthy court battles which lasted through the 1970s . 
 The L 'Enfant Plaza Hotel opened with a three @-@ day gala ending with its dedication on May 31 , 1973 . The festivities began on May 29 with a birthday party for author Anita Loos attended by 260 Loews ' executives , celebrities , and press — including actress Carol Channing singing " Diamonds Are A Girl 's Best Friend " while seated on top of a 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) tall cake . More than 1 @,@ 500 people including Senator J. William Fulbright , Senator Jacob Javits , former Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford , and numerous business people , bankers , merchants , and construction company executives attended a reception at the hotel on May 30 , and were permitted to roam freely throughout the facility throughout the evening . On May 31 , Mayor of the District of Columbia Walter Washington , flanked by the Thomas Jefferson High School marching band and 40 high @-@ kicking high school <unk> , cut the ribbon formally opening the hotel . The finished hotel had 372 rooms and occupied the bottom two " lobby floors " and the top four floors of the building . The building 's final cost was $ 30 million .

 Quesada and the Rockefeller family each owned about 39 percent of L 'Enfant Plaza Corp. Major Rockefeller investors included David Rockefeller , David Rockefeller , Jr . , and Abby Rockefeller <unk> . 
 The hotel suffered a serious fire in 1975 . On February 10 , a fire broke out in a 12th floor storeroom which killed a hotel maid and injured three others . A hotel waiter died the following day . An important national conference was also held at the hotel by the American government in 1980 . In the late 1980s a supposed secret meeting was held at the hotel by three Republicans — Richard V. Allen , Laurence H. Silberman and Robert McFarlane — with an Iranian emissary . From its opening until May 2005 , the hotel was managed by Loews Hotels . For the next five years , it was managed by Crestline Hotels & Resorts , but the Davidson Hotel Company assumed control of its operations in July 2010 . 
 In September 1996 , the Dutch Company Sarakreek Holdings NV ( a real estate investment firm ) , Sarakreek Holding N.V. ( itself a subsidiary of the Tiger / Westbrook Real Estate Fund of New York City ) , purchased the hotel and all but the West Building at L 'Enfant Plaza for $ 185 million . 
 In November 2003 , the JBG Companies purchased L 'Enfant Plaza , the L 'Enfant Plaza Hotel , and the North and South office buildings from the Sarakreek Holdings for $ 200 million . The following year , the JBG Companies upgraded the hotel 's physical plant , and added a Louvre Pyramid @-@ like structure to the plaza in front of the hotel . This was designed by the architect I.M. Pei .

 As part of Sarakreek 's 1997 purchase of most of the L 'Enfant Plaza complex , Sarakreek put the L 'Enfant Plaza Hotel up for sale . Stanford Hotels Corporation , a privately owned firm , successfully bid $ 48 million for the structure . After a definitive sale agreement was reached in 1998 , Sarakreek backed out of the deal . Hotels Stanford sued in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia . In Stanford Hotels Corporation v. Potomac Creek Associates ( CAB @-@ 1413 @-@ 99 , 1999 ) , Superior Court Judge Leonard Braman ruled that Sarakreek was not in breach of contract . Stanford Hotels appealed . Various motions delayed the appellate hearing until 2009 . 
 In 2011 , the District of Columbia Court of Appeals overturned the ruling of the Superior Court . The case was remanded to the Superior Court with orders to determine whether specific performance was warranted . 
 Subsequently , after a second trial , Judge Braman ruled on July 31 , 2013 , that Sarakreek was in violation of its preliminary 1998 agreement to sell . The JBG Cos. was ordered to sell the L 'Enfant Plaza Hotel to Stanford Corp. Stanford submitted its offer to buy to the court on August 9 .

 Stanford Corp. announced on October 18 , 2013 , that it expected to close on the sale of the hotel on December 3 , 2013 . The company said it would immediately shut down the hotel , and engage in a year @-@ long renovation . The hotel was not accepting any reservations that extended past December 2 , 2013 . Hotel industry experts told the Washington Business Journal that the hotel had many years ' worth of deferred maintenance . The JBG Cos. had spent only about $ 2 million in maintenance from 2005 to 2013 , and Stanford Corp. estimated the property needed at least $ 28 million in modernizations . 
 Stanford also agreed to the honor the collective bargaining agreement which The JBG Cos. had with UNITE HERE Local 25 . About 125 to 135 people , most of them with 20 years of job tenure at the L 'Enfant Plaza Hotel , were affected by the closure . The labor union said it was in discussion with Stanford Corp. to win the company 's guarantee that the workers would be rehired and that the company would honor the workers ' collective bargaining agreement when the hotel reopened . 
 In January 2014 , Stanford Corp. said it would spend $ 30 million beginning in the spring of 2014 to renovate all meeting space and the fitness facility , lobby , pool , and restaurants at the facility . The company said the hotel might lose a few rooms if expansion of the concierge space or fitness facility warranted it . The goal is to bring the facility up to a four @-@ diamond status . The company also said it might lease the facility to Hilton , Marriott , or Starwood , and had not yet decided whether to retain " L 'Enfant Plaza " as part of the name or seek a new moniker relevant to some other part of the nearby National Mall .

 When Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) hears Oscar Martinez ( Oscar Nunez ) complaining about Angela Martin 's ( Angela Kinsey ) baby poster to Toby Flenderson ( Paul Lieberstein ) , he intervenes and resolves the conflict himself by forcing his " solution " onto all parties . Inspired , Michael wrests the file outlining other unresolved office complaints from Toby , determined to resolve them all . Meanwhile , when photos for identification badges are being taken in the break room , Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) uses the situation as a way to prank Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) . 
 Michael publicly reads all the outstanding complaints against everyone , even though they were supposed to be anonymous , which only serves to further increase office tensions . Pam Beesly ( Jenna Fischer ) is particularly troubled by a nameless complaint that she plans her wedding during office hours , a complaint she concludes was filed by Angela . Enraged at Jim 's latest prank ( Jim made Dwight 's new ID which was <unk> inches , labeled Dwight as a security threat , and changed his middle name from Kurt to " Fart " ) , Dwight becomes even more furious that his voluminous complaints against Jim have gone ignored , and tells Michael that either Jim gets fired or Dwight will quit . When Michael reads all of Jim 's pranks on Dwight , Jim begins to regret how much time he has wasted at the office . Dwight taunts Jim with a notice of a Dunder @-@ Mifflin position in Stamford , saying that Jim should look into it because Dwight will still be working in Scranton by next week . Michael surveys the angry , divided office and silently nods to a watching Toby , acknowledging his efforts were a disaster . He then defuses Dwight 's anger by saying he will make his decision but needs indeterminate time to do so , which placates Dwight . 
 As everyone prepares to leave , Michael pays the photographer ( Scott Adsit ) to take a special group photo , but goes through a lot of money before he , albeit poorly , <unk> one himself . During the procedure , Jim admits to Pam that he had registered the complaint about her wedding planning , and Pam looks shocked . The next day , Jim secretly sees Vice President Jan Levenson ( Melora Hardin ) for an interview about a transfer .

 Cubzac @-@ les @-@ Ponts , also referred to as Cubzac , is a commune of the Gironde department in Aquitaine , a region in southwestern France . Located 20 km southwest of Bordeaux , it is a crossing point of the river Dordogne . Cubzac has three bridges , one designed by Gustave Eiffel . 
 During the Middle Ages , Cubzac served as a watchtower through the Four Sons of Amon castle . Different means of crossing the river in Cubzac have historically been used , from pontoon bridges and horse @-@ powered ferries to steel and concrete bridges . Part of a vibrant wine region , Cubzac has several wine castles , including the Terrefort castle . It has developed its own sparkling wine , in what is now called the Café de Paris . The limestone quarries of Cubzac supplied for the typical white constructions found in Bordeaux and its region . Cubzac has two Monuments Historiques ; the first is a painting in a church , the other is the ruins of the Four Sons of Amon castle . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Cubzac is located about 20 km northeast of Bordeaux , on the north riverbank of the Dordogne . Several transport networks converge in Cubzac to cross the river . These include the A10 motorway , the N10 trunk road and the Bordeaux @-@ Nantes railroad . The LGV Sud @-@ Ouest , a high @-@ speed railway line running between Tours and Bordeaux , is in the process of being build . Cubzac has an elevation ranging from 1 m to 42 m , the highest points being limestone cliffs dating from the Oligocene epoch , some of which have been used as source of stone . In <unk> terms , Cubzac is near the appellations d 'origine contrôlée ( AOC ) <unk> de Bourg and <unk> , with its own wine castles .

 Cubzac 's climate is oceanic , part of the Dfb group in the Köppen climate classification . Periodically , the river Dordogne causes flooding . Nowadays Cubzac is protected by a dam , but is still vulnerable to flooding during high tides and strong winds . Flooding occurred last in the 1999 Martin and 2010 <unk> storms . The 1999 storm destroyed many trees from the Terrefort castle park . In 1708 , a temperature extremum of -15 ° C caused the river and vineyards to freeze .

Of the 310 jobs available in Cubzac , only 34 @,@ 9 % were given to its inhabitants . On January 1 , 2010 there were no hotels and no camping sites in Cubzac . Agriculture in Cubzac is mostly dedicated to vine , corn and hay . In 2000 , 244 ha of Cubzac 's land was farmland , representing 25 % of the total 987 ha . 
 = = History = = 
 The first traces of settlements in Cubzac date back to the Magdalenian epoch . Those were discovered in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , with scrapers , chisels , nuclei , and harpoons found . Cut and polished axes , arrowheads , scrapers , awls and flint strikers , and a few fragments of pottery from the Neolithic epoch are plentiful in Cubzac , especially on the mound of the " Four Sons of Amon " . A very large bronze deposit for making weapons was found from the time of the Bronze and Iron Ages . The town was mentioned in the Roman epoch as a surveillance post . Already , crossing the river Dordogne was done at Cubzac . The town has been reconverted through the centuries . The territory was occupied from the 6th century BC by a <unk> <unk> tribe . The village was occupied in 1250 by Simon de Montfort , 6th Earl of Leicester . The centre of Cubzac is built on a small hill that dominates the Dordogne valley . 
 The village has developed from the domain of <unk> , a wealthy landowner of the Gallo @-@ Roman era , from which the name Cubzac derives . 
 = = = Ancient crossing methods = = = 
 The first ferries crossing the Dordogne were flat @-@ bottomed boats driven by oars or keelboats driven by a sail . The passage was very risky and accidents occurred , especially during high tides and storms . From 1754 , a cable ferry crossed the 550 m wide river . The cable lay above the waters and stretched obliquely to the current . In 1821 , the cable ferry was replaced by a two @-@ part ferry powered by a carousel of twelve horses . The horses set in motion gears which in turn powered a large paddle wheel . In good weather , the crossing time was improved to 30 – 45 minutes , but in bad weather the trip remained uncertain . 
 The decision to establish a bridge in Cubzac is taken by Napoleon Bonaparte on 30 January 1812 and February 3 , 1813 . The bridge was originally to be completed in 1820 . However , Cubzac 's first bridge was a suspension bridge for which construction works started in 1834 , under Louis @-@ Philippe I. Works lasted four years , and public inauguration occurred on August 17 , 1839 by the Duc and Duchesse of Orleans . The bridge had cost an estimated 3 million gold francs , was 545 m long and had 5 bays . Shortly after its construction , the pillars sank about one metre . During its 30 years of existence , it withstood storms despite the large amplitude oscillations caused . However , on March 2 , 1869 a large storm , causing oscillations of more than two metres , partially destroyed the bridge and rendered it useless . Ancient methods to cross the Dordogne where reinstated . At first , barges and steamboats were used . Then , starting from October 1870 , a large steam tub was used , measuring 21 m by 13 m . To cover the expensive construction costs , a toll was levied for the first 27 years . 
 = = Current bridges = = 
 = = = Eiffel bridge = = = 
 When the suspension bridge fell in 1869 , the idea of a new bridge was discussed at length . The initial project dates from 1875 , which proposed that the new bridge had accompanying rail tracks , and that it be built on the remaining foundations of the suspension bridge , using scaffolding . Actually , given the height of the bridge and the river 's depth and current , scaffolding is almost technically impossible to implement . In the final project from 1878 , a jetting alternative was offered , despite very few companies mastering the technique at the time . The problem of fitting rail tracks , which was later abandoned , delayed the project . 
 In 1873 , masonry works had started on the right bank . In 1879 , Gustave Eiffel , who had waited more than ten years for a positive response to his project , took in hand the large undertaking in Cubzac , which finished in 1883 . The Cubzac bridge is the most important roadwork by the Eiffel company . It necessitated <unk> tonnes of metal , measures 552 m , and is divided in eight bays . The parapet consists of iron braces rather than solid walls , alleviating the structure . The company manufacturing the iron pieces later provided those used for the Eiffel Tower . 
 As the Allies landed in Normandy , the German troupes , in their escape , partially destroyed the Eiffel bridge using explosives . Starting from August 21 , 1944 , all traffic on the bridge was restricted for the retirement of the German troupes . On 28 August 1944 , as the last soldiers passed , German engineers arrived in bicycles and fitted explosives which detonated at 9 : 20pm . Three of the eight bays had fallen in the waters and the North abutment was seriously damaged . The delicate repair works where operated by the company <unk> <unk> Eiffel with the help of the <unk> Générale Industrielle du Sud @-@ Ouest , which coincidentally was directed by Jacques Eiffel , the grand son of Gustave Eiffel . For this reason , the bridge is sometimes called " the twice Eiffel bridge " . 
 The bridge is now part of the Route nationale 10 which runs between <unk> and Paris . Both viaducts to the bridge date from 1839 and each measures approximately 250 m . Over time , large settlements occurred , causing serious disturbances in the masonry and requiring the replacement of many vaults in 1880 , 1903 and 1934 . 
 = = = Railway bridge = = = 
 The rail bridge was constructed by Lebrun , <unk> and Pile by the <unk> <unk> et Pillet . Its style resembles that of the adjacent Eiffel bridge . It was commissioned by the Chemins de Fer de l 'État for the Chartres @-@ Bordeaux line , and the construction lasted from 1884 to 1885 . Inaugurated in 1886 , it is 561 @,@ 60 m long above the Dordogne are divided in eight bays . The rails are 21 @.@ 80 m above the highest waters . The bridge is made of iron pillars fitted in braces . Despite being younger than the Eiffel bridge , the construction necessitated more funds and effort . The constructions hidden under water and earth make up the bulk of the value and volume of materials used . Foundations only total to 57 @,@ 800 cubic meters . Even though less damaged than the Eiffel bridge , it also sustained damage from German bombing on the same day . The reconstruction works ended June 15 , 1946 , taking less than two years to complete . 
 = = = Motorway bridge = = = 
 In 1957 it was decided to study the implementation of a bridge to relieve the old Eiffel bridge which allowed only one lane per direction , and cutback on traffic jams . From 1957 to 1963 various solutions where studies . In 1971 the construction works were tendered and given to the company Campenon @-@ Bernard @-@ Europe . The works should have lasted only two years but where completed in 1974 . The new motorway bridge made of reinforced concrete , having relieved the traffic jams , was celebrated on radio , and by the song " Ne <unk> pas en <unk> , ne <unk> pas ! " ( Do not , do not go on holiday ! ) by Pierre Perret . In 2000 , the bridge was doubled to <unk> lanes .

 The Saint @-@ Julien church is named after Julian the Hospitaller , patron of Cubzac . Julian is a legendary saint destined to kill his parents , and informed about his destiny by a stag . He fled to escape his fate , but the prophecy realized nonetheless , and he became a hermit , helping people cross a river . One day , the Christ arrived to announce his pardon . From the Middle Ages to the French Revolution , the town would have been called Saint @-@ Julien @-@ de @-@ Cubzac . The church is made of limestone and underwent important modifications in the 19th century , when in particular the steeple was rebuilt . The façade , however , still contains Roman remains . The church holds an 18th @-@ century painting of the Baptism of Christ , classified Monument historique in 1913 . The church is surrounded by a cemetery which was excavated in August 1978 by archaeologists under the direction of Richard Boudet . Coins dating from the time of Francis I , Henry III , Henry IV , Louis XIII , Napoleon III and Victor Emmanuel were uncovered . A gold Merovingian signet ring bearing the Christian symbol <unk> was also discovered under many potsherds . 
 = = = Four Sons of Amon castle = = = 
 At Cubzac , on the high rocky shoreline overlooking the Dordogne , and in the town centre , are the ruins of the castle " des Quatre fils Aymon " within ordinary houses . The entrance of the fortress is flanked by the remains of two towers . These few stones are however extraordinarily rich in history and legend . First off , the castle did not belong to the four sons of Aymon who lived , perhaps , the time of Charlemagne . It was built and rebuilt in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries . It was the seat of the lordship of <unk> . In 1206 , John Lackland , the king of England and youngest son of Eleanor of Aquitaine , took revenge of the king of France Philippe Auguste , who accused him of treason and deprived him of his fiefs , by engaging in miscellaneous abuses . He stormed the castle of Cubzac , and destroyed it . It is a brief English victory . The lordship returns to the French , and is attributed to Simon de Montfort , 6th Earl of Leicester , son of the terrible and bloody winner of the Albigensian Crusade . He built a new castle deemed impregnable , on behalf of the King of England , with double walls , and yet it is the one for which ruins remain . He was sacked by the Gascon barons revolted against Simon de Montfort . Half sacked , it served as a stately home , until moving to the lordship <unk> . The legions days that the two mediaeval castles have erected on the site of a building dating from the Carolingian period , which nothing remains . The Four Sons of Amon castle was registered as a historic monument in 1938 . 
 = = = Terrefort @-@ Quancard castle = = = 
 Positioned atop a hill dominating Cubzac @-@ les @-@ Ponts and Saint @-@ André @-@ de @-@ Cubzac , the Terrefort @-@ Quancard castle is a wine property and family house . The main building is a limestone rectangular body of living area , covered with slate for the roof . The surrounding grape wines , most of which are Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot , span approximately 70 hectares of land . Various vestiges remain , including a wash for linen and horses , and a wind @-@ will for flour . 
 During its history spanning seven centuries , the castle was owned by a succession of seven families . One of the owners , the count <unk> of <unk> , peer of France , was a catalyst to the construction of the Eiffel bridge . In March 1891 , the Quancard brothers Jean and Eugène bought the property for 110 000 francs , and the Quancard family remains the last owners . The purchase came after a severe phylloxera outbreak , causing the death of over half of French vineyards , devalued the property . The land area was covered mostly with rock until the Quancard brothers used explosives to remove it , and large amounts of clay @-@ limestone soil , known to be beneficial for the wine produce , was brought to replace it . 
 The Quancard family has played a role in the life and history of Cubzac @-@ les @-@ Ponts . Firstly , Jean Quancard was elected by absolute majority as mayor of Cubzac on May 15 , 1892 and remained in office for 27 years . Also , a fair , organised annually from 1936 to 1939 for its success , supported restoration work for the Saint @-@ Julien steeple and provided financial help to the priest . Finally , the owners periodically host events , including expositions , family weddings and family reunions . The last family reunion , from May 2006 , saw approximately 200 members of the Quancard family . 
 = = = Wine caves = = = 
 During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , the mound of Cubzac was slashed all around to provide stone for Bordeaux 's construction and the ballast of some river banks , creating deep excavations in the limestone . In 1898 , André Cousteau , uncle of the researcher and ecologist Jacques Cousteau , started using the caves to make a sparkling wine based on traditional Champagne @-@ making techniques . The wine , treated in a closed tank , bottled , and kept neck down many months at constant temperature , became bubbly and had its impurities accumulate near the cap . Once this deposit was removed , the bottles were resealed by force , and the corks muzzled . In 1920 , the Cousteau property was sold to the Société Anonyme Gay @-@ Mousse . In 1966 , the caves where entrusted to Monsieur <unk> who , one year later , created the Café de Paris .

She was designed for a crew of 17 officers and men . 
 U @-@ 17 was equipped with two 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes located in the front and carried a complement of two torpedoes . In October 1916 , U @-@ 17 's armament was supplemented with a 37 mm / 23 ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) quick @-@ firing ( QF ) gun . This gun was replaced by a 47 mm / 23 ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) QF gun in November 1917 . 
 U @-@ 17 was ordered by the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy on 1 April 1915 and laid down at AG Weser in Bremen later that month . When completed , the submarine was broken down into sections , loaded onto railcars , and shipped to the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy 's main base at Pola on 30 August . After completing the four @-@ day journey , the sections were riveted together .

On 9 December , <unk> was succeeded as U @-@ 17 's commanding officer by Linienschiffsleutnant Zdenko Hudecek . 
 By the end of December , U @-@ 17 was operating from Cattaro and patrolling off the Albanian and Montenegrin coasts . Hudecek and U @-@ 17 made two unsuccessful attacks on enemy destroyers in January . On 23 February , Hudecek attempted an attack on a cargo ship off Durazzo , but was discovered and depth charged . Two days later the submarine put in to Cattaro to replace a broken gyrocompass with a new magnetic compass . In mid @-@ March , U @-@ 17 shifted to patrol off the Italian coast once again and was attacked by air on 15 March off Brindisi . The Italian patrols continued until late May , when U @-@ 17 was sent to patrol in the Ionian Sea . Duty in the Straits of Otranto followed in June , as part of the plan to disrupt the Otranto Barrage . On 12 June , the submarine attempted an attack on an Italian Orfeo @-@ class torpedo boat ; the torpedo boat survived and repaid U @-@ 17 by dropping several depth charges nearby .

Two days later , a failed attack on a steamer resulted in another depth charging of U @-@ 17 , this time by an Orfeo @-@ class torpedo boat . In early October , an air attack by two airplanes damaged U @-@ 17 . 
 The year 1917 was uneventful for U @-@ 17 . The submarine resumed patrols off Albania in January . In May , the U @-@ boat had to crash dive near Valona when a bomber appeared overhead and dropped its payload . A foray to Bari in July provided another opportunity to attack a steamer , but the torpedoes missed their mark . On 16 August , U @-@ 17 , by now under the command of Linienschiffsleutnant Hermann Rigele , attempted a torpedo attack on a cargo ship off <unk> . At the end of October , U @-@ 17 escaped damage from a torpedo attack by an enemy submarine near Cape <unk> , Albania . A month later , the submarine was once again attacked by air , surviving two bombs dropped from a single airplane . 
 In the first part of June 1918 , U @-@ 17 patrolled off the coast of Italy , but had returned to Cattaro on 12 June . Two weeks later , the boat set out for Pola to undergo repairs . At the end of the war , the ship 's repairs remained unfinished . U @-@ 17 , at Pola with six other Austro @-@ Hungarian submarines , was ceded to Italy as a war reparation . U @-@ 17 was broken up at Pola by the Italians in 1920 .

Widely distributed , it is common in Europe and North America , and has also been collected in North Africa , Central America , and Japan . The fungus is saprobic , and produces fruit bodies ( mushrooms ) that grow on the floor of coniferous forests . The mushrooms have a bell @-@ shaped to conical cap up to 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) in diameter , set atop a slender stipe up to 6 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) long with yellow to orange hairs at the base . The fungus is named after its characteristic bright orange gill edges . A microscopic characteristic is the club @-@ shaped cystidia that are covered with numerous spiky projections , resembling a mace . The edibility of the mushroom has not been determined . M. aurantiomarginata can be distinguished from similar Mycena species by differences in size , color , and substrate . A 2010 publication reported the discovery and characterization of a novel pigment named mycenaaurin A , isolated from the mushroom . The pigment is responsible for its color , and it has antibiotic activity that may function to prevent certain bacteria from growing on the mushroom .

 The species , originally named Agaricus marginatus by the Danish naturalist Heinrich Christian Friedrich Schumacher in 1803 , has several synonyms . Elias Magnus Fries renamed it Agaricus <unk> @-@ marginatus in his 1821 Systema Mycologicum , while Christiaan Hendrik Persoon called it Agaricus <unk> in 1828 . Although Schumacher had the earliest publication date , Fries 's name is sanctioned , and so the specific epithet he used is given nomenclatural precedence . French mycologist Lucien Quélet transferred the species to the genus Mycena in 1872 . In 1930 Karel Cejp considered it to be a variety of Mycena elegans . 
 According to Alexander H. Smith 's organization of the genus Mycena , M. aurantiomarginata is classified in section Calodontes , subsection <unk> , which contains species with roughened cheilocystidia ( cystidia on gill edges ) , such as M. rosella , M. flavescens , M. elegans , and M. strobilinoides . In his 1992 study of Mycena , Dutch mycologist Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus put M. aurantiomarginata in the section <unk> , characterized by species with an olive to yellowish @-@ olive and moist cap , pallid to gray @-@ olive gills with bright orange margins , brownish to grayish @-@ olive stipes , white spore deposit , and spiny cystidia . M. aurantiomarginata was included in a 2010 molecular analysis focused on clarifying the phylogenetic relationships between Northern European species in the section Calodontes . The results suggested that , based on the similarity of nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences , the fungus is closely related to M. <unk> and M. <unk> . This conclusion was previously corroborated by research that used molecular analysis to demonstrate that several Mycena species can be mycorrhizal partners of the orchid <unk> confusa . 
 The specific epithet aurantiomarginata is Latin , and refers to the orange edges of its gills ( <unk> , " orange " ; marginata , " bordered " ) . In the United Kingdom , the mushroom is commonly known as the " golden @-@ edge bonnet " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap of M. aurantiomarginata ranges in shape from obtusely conic to bell @-@ shaped , and becomes flat in maturity , reaching diameters of 0 @.@ 8 – 2 @.@ 0 cm ( 0 @.@ 3 – 0 @.@ 8 in ) . The cap color is variable , ranging from dark olive fuscous ( dark brownish @-@ gray ) to yellowish @-@ olive in the center , while the margin is orangish . Alexander H. Smith , in his 1947 monograph of North American Mycena species , stated that the caps are not hygrophanous ( changing color depending on the level of hydration ) , while Mycena specialist Arne <unk> says they are . The overall color fades as the mushroom ages . The surface is moist , and young individuals are covered with fine whitish powder , but this soon sloughs off to leave a polished surface that develops radial grooves in maturity . The flesh is thin ( about 1 mm thick in the center of the cap ) and flexible . 
 Gills are adnate with a decurrent tooth ( where the gills curve up to join the stipe but then , close to the stipe , the margin turns down again ) , and initially narrow but broaden when old . They are pallid to grayish @-@ olive with bright orange edges . Smith noted that the edge color may spread to the gill faces in some specimens , because the pigment , rather than being encrusted on the walls of the cystidia , is found in the cytosol and therefore more readily <unk> . The gills are spaced close together , with between 16 and 26 gills reaching the stipe , and there are up to three tiers of interspersed lamellulae ( short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stipe ) . The cylindrical stipe is 3 – 6 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 2 @.@ 4 in ) long by 0 @.@ 1 – 0 @.@ 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 04 – 0 @.@ 08 in ) thick , hollow , and stiff but flexible ; it is somewhat thicker at the base . It has a brownish to grayish @-@ olive color that is sometimes tinged with shades of orange . The surface is smooth except for orange powder near the top , while the base is covered with stiff orange hairs . Smith reports the mushroom tissue to have no distinctive taste or odor , while <unk> says the odor is " very conspicuous ; sweet , fruity , often experienced as farinaceous or faintly of anise " . Like many small Mycena species , the edibility of the mushroom is unknown , as it is too insubstantial to consider collecting for the table . 
 The spores are elliptic , smooth , and amyloid , with dimensions of 7 – 9 by 4 – 5 μm . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells of the hymenium ) are club @-@ shaped , four @-@ spored , and measure 25 – 32 by 5 @.@ 5 – 7 μm . Pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the gill faces and edges , respectively ) are abundant and similar in morphology : club @-@ shaped to somewhat capitate ( with a head ) , the tops sparsely to densely covered with small spines ( said to resemble a mace ) , filled with a bright orange pigment , and measuring 28 – 36 by 7 – 12 μm . The flesh of the cap is covered with a cuticle , on the surface of which are found scattered cystidia similar to those on the gills . Directly beneath the cuticle is a layer of enlarged cells , and beneath this are filamentous hyphae . Clamp connections are present in the hyphae . 
 Mycena aurantiomarginata uses a <unk> mating system , whereby genes at two different locations on the chromosomes regulate sexual compatibility , or mating type . This system prevents self @-@ fertilization and ensures a high degree of genotypic diversity . When the fungal mycelia is grown in culture on a petri dish , the colonies are white , odorless , and typically have a central patch of congested aerial hyphae that grow upward from the colony surface , which abruptly become flattened to submerged , and occasionally form faint zone lines . The hyphae commonly form deposits of tiny amorphous crystals where they contact other mycelial fronts , especially where the hyphae are vegetatively incompatible and destroy each other by lysis .

 Mycena aurantiomarginata is generally recognizable in the field by its olive @-@ brown to orangish cap , bright orange gill edges , and yellowish hairs at the base of the stipe . M. elegans is similar in appearance to M. aurantiomarginata , and some have considered them synonymous . M. elegans is larger , with a cap diameter up to 3 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 4 in ) and stipe length up to 12 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) , darker , and has pale greenish @-@ yellow colors on the gill edges and stipes that stain dull reddish @-@ brown in age . M. <unk> is readily distinguished from M. aurantiomarginata by the bright orange color of its fruit bodies , its clustered growth on rotting wood , and the presence of a gelatinous layer on its stipe . M. strobilinoides closely resembles M. aurantiomarginata in shape , size , spore morphology , and the presence of hairs at the stipe base . It has a cap color that ranges from scarlet to yellow , and features scarlet edges on widely spaced , pale pinkish @-@ orange to yellow gills . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Mycena aurantiomarginata is a saprobic fungus , deriving nutrients from decomposing organic matter found on the forest floor , such as needle carpets . Fruit bodies of the fungus grow scattered , in groups , or in tufts under conifers ( usually spruce and fir ) , and are often found on moss . In North America , it is found in California , Washington , Oregon , and British Columbia , and the species is widely distributed in western and northern Europe . In Central America , the mushroom has been collected on the summit of Cerro de la Muerte in the Cordillera de Talamanca , Costa Rica , on leaf litter of <unk> <unk> ( a highly branched evergreen shrub or tree in the heath family ) . In 2010 , it was reported from Hokkaido in northern Japan , where it was found growing on Picea <unk> forest litter in early winter . It has also been recorded from North Africa .

 In 2010 , a pigment compound isolated and characterized from fruit bodies of Mycena aurantiomarginata was reported as new to science by Robert Jaeger and Peter <unk> in the Journal of Natural Products . The chemical , mycenaaurin A , is a <unk> compound that consists of a <unk> ( i.e. , 13 adjacent methylene bridge and carbonyl functional groups with two amino acid moieties on either end of the molecule ) . The authors posit that the flanking amino acid groups are probably derived biosynthetically from S @-@ <unk> methionine . The <unk> itself contains an alpha @-@ <unk> , a conjugated <unk> , and a single alkenyl moiety . Jaeger and <unk> suggest that mycenaaurin A might function as a defense compound , since it exhibits antibacterial activity against the Gram @-@ positive bacterium Bacillus <unk> . The chemical is only present in the fruit bodies , and not in the colorless mycelia . An earlier screening for antimicrobial activity in the fruit bodies revealed a weak ability to inhibit the growth of the fungi Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus . 
 = California Gold Rush = 
 The California Gold Rush ( 1848 – 1855 ) began on January 24 , 1848 , when gold was found by James W. Marshall at Sutter 's Mill in Coloma , California . The first to hear confirmed information of the gold rush were the people in Oregon , the Sandwich Islands ( Hawaii ) , and Latin America , and they were the first to start flocking to the state in late 1848 . All in all , the news of gold brought some 300 @,@ 000 people to California from the rest of the United States and abroad . Of the 300 @,@ 000 , approximately half arrived by sea and half came overland on the California Trail and the Gila River trail . 
 The gold @-@ seekers , called " forty @-@ niners " ( as a reference to 1849 ) , often faced substantial hardships on the trip . While most of the newly arrived were Americans , the Gold Rush attracted tens of thousands from Latin America , Europe , Australia , and China . At first , the prospectors retrieved the gold from streams and riverbeds using simple techniques , such as panning . More sophisticated methods of gold recovery were developed and later adopted around the world . At its peak , technological advances reached a point where significant financing was required , increasing the proportion of gold companies to individual miners . Gold worth tens of billions of today 's dollars was recovered , which led to great wealth for a few . However , many returned home with little more than they had started with . 
 The effects of the Gold Rush were substantial . San Francisco grew from a small settlement of about 200 residents in 1846 to a boomtown of about 36 @,@ 000 by 1852 . Roads , churches , schools and other towns were built throughout California . In 1849 a state constitution was written , a governor and legislature chosen and California became a state in 1850 as part of the Compromise of 1850 . 
 New methods of transportation developed as steamships came into regular service . By 1869 railroads were built across the country from California to the eastern United States . Agriculture and ranching expanded throughout the state to meet the needs of the settlers . At the beginning of the Gold Rush , there was no law regarding property rights in the goldfields and a system of " staking claims " was developed . The Gold Rush also had negative effects : Native Americans were attacked and pushed off their lands and the mining has caused environmental harm . An estimated 100 @,@ 000 California Indians died between 1848 and 1868 as a result of American immigration . 
 = = History = = 
 The California Gold Rush began at Sutter 's Mill , near Coloma . On January 24 , 1848 , James W. Marshall , a foreman working for Sacramento pioneer John Sutter , found shiny metal in the tailrace of a lumber mill Marshall was building for Sutter on the American River . Marshall brought what he found to John Sutter , and the two privately tested the metal . After the tests showed that it was gold , Sutter expressed dismay : he wanted to keep the news quiet because he feared what would happen to his plans for an agricultural empire if there were a mass search for gold . 
 However , rumors soon started to spread and were confirmed in March 1848 by San Francisco newspaper publisher and merchant Samuel Brannan . The most famous quote of the California Gold Rush was by Brannan ; after he had hurriedly set up a store to sell gold prospecting supplies , Brannan strode through the streets of San Francisco , holding aloft a vial of gold , shouting " Gold ! Gold ! Gold from the American River ! " 
 On August 19 , 1848 , the New York Herald was the first major newspaper on the East Coast to report the discovery of gold . On December 5 , 1848 , President James Polk confirmed the discovery of gold in an address to Congress . Soon , waves of immigrants from around the world , later called the " forty @-@ niners , " invaded the Gold Country of California or " Mother Lode " . As Sutter had feared , he was ruined ; his workers left in search of gold , and squatters took over his land and stole his crops and cattle . 
 San Francisco had been a tiny settlement before the rush began . When residents learned about the discovery , it at first became a ghost town of abandoned ships and businesses , but then boomed as merchants and new people arrived . The population of San Francisco exploded from perhaps about 1 @,@ 000 in 1848 to 25 @,@ 000 full @-@ time residents by 1850 . Miners lived in tents , wood shanties , or deck cabins removed from abandoned ships . 
 In what has been referred to as the " first world @-@ class gold rush , " there was no easy way to get to California ; forty @-@ niners faced hardship and often death on the way . At first , most Argonauts , as they were also known , traveled by sea . From the East Coast , a sailing voyage around the tip of South America would take five to eight months , and cover some 18 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 33 @,@ 000 kilometres ) . An alternative was to sail to the Atlantic side of the Isthmus of Panama , take canoes and mules for a week through the jungle , and then on the Pacific side , wait for a ship sailing for San Francisco . There was also a route across Mexico starting at Veracruz . Many gold @-@ seekers took the overland route across the continental United States , particularly along the California Trail . Each of these routes had its own deadly hazards , from shipwreck to typhoid fever and cholera . 
 To meet the demands of the arrivals , ships bearing goods from around the world came to San Francisco as well . Ships ' captains found that their crews deserted to go to the goldfields . The wharves and docks of San Francisco became a forest of masts , as hundreds of ships were abandoned . Enterprising San Franciscans turned the abandoned ships into warehouses , stores , taverns , hotels , and one into a jail . Many of these ships were later destroyed and used for landfill to create more buildable land in the boomtown . 
 Within a few years , there was an important but lesser @-@ known surge of prospectors into far Northern California , specifically into present @-@ day Siskiyou , Shasta and Trinity Counties . Discovery of gold nuggets at the site of present @-@ day Yreka in 1851 brought thousands of gold @-@ seekers up the Siskiyou Trail and throughout California 's northern counties . Settlements of the Gold Rush era , such as Portuguese Flat on the Sacramento River , sprang into existence and then faded . The Gold Rush town of Weaverville on the Trinity River today retains the oldest continuously used Taoist temple in California , a legacy of Chinese miners who came . While there are not many Gold Rush era ghost towns still in existence , the remains of the once @-@ bustling town of Shasta have been preserved in a California State Historic Park in Northern California . 
 Gold was also discovered in Southern California but on a much smaller scale . The first discovery of gold , at Rancho San Francisco in the mountains north of present @-@ day Los Angeles , had been in 1842 , six years before Marshall 's discovery , while California was still part of Mexico . However , these first deposits , and later discoveries in Southern California mountains , attracted little notice and were of limited consequence economically . 
 By 1850 , most of the easily accessible gold had been collected , and attention turned to extracting gold from more difficult locations . Faced with gold increasingly difficult to retrieve , Americans began to drive out foreigners to get at the most accessible gold that remained . The new California State Legislature passed a foreign miners tax of twenty dollars per month ( $ 570 per month as of 2016 ) , and American prospectors began organized attacks on foreign miners , particularly Latin Americans and Chinese . 
 In addition , the huge numbers of newcomers were driving Native Americans out of their traditional hunting , fishing and food @-@ gathering areas . To protect their homes and livelihood , some Native Americans responded by attacking the miners . This provoked counter @-@ attacks on native villages . The Native Americans , out @-@ gunned , were often slaughtered . Those who escaped massacres were many times unable to survive without access to their food @-@ gathering areas , and they starved to death . Novelist and poet Joaquin Miller vividly captured one such attack in his semi @-@ autobiographical work , Life Amongst the Modocs . 
 = = Forty @-@ niners = = 
 The first people to rush to the goldfields , beginning in the spring of 1848 , were the residents of California themselves — primarily agriculturally oriented Americans and Europeans living in Northern California , along with Native Americans and some Californios ( Spanish @-@ speaking Californians ) . These first miners tended to be families in which everyone helped in the effort . Women and children of all ethnicities were often found panning next to the men . Some enterprising families set up boarding houses to accommodate the influx of men ; in such cases , the women often brought in steady income while their husbands searched for gold . 
 Word of the Gold Rush spread slowly at first . The earliest gold @-@ seekers were people who lived near California or people who heard the news from ships on the fastest sailing routes from California . The first large group of Americans to arrive were several thousand Oregonians who came down the Siskiyou Trail . Next came people from the Sandwich Islands , and several thousand Latin Americans , including people from Mexico , from Peru and from as far away as Chile , both by ship and overland . By the end of 1848 , some 6 @,@ 000 Argonauts had come to California . 
 Only a small number ( probably fewer than 500 ) traveled overland from the United States that year . Some of these " forty @-@ <unk> " , as the earliest gold @-@ seekers were sometimes called , were able to collect large amounts of easily accessible gold — in some cases , thousands of dollars worth each day . Even ordinary prospectors averaged daily gold finds worth 10 to 15 times the daily wage of a laborer on the East Coast . A person could work for six months in the goldfields and find the equivalent of six years ' wages back home . Some hoped to get rich quick and return home , and others wished to start businesses in California . 
 By the beginning of 1849 , word of the Gold Rush had spread around the world , and an overwhelming number of gold @-@ seekers and merchants began to arrive from virtually every continent . The largest group of forty @-@ niners in 1849 were Americans , arriving by the tens of thousands overland across the continent and along various sailing routes ( the name " forty @-@ niner " was derived from the year 1849 ) . Many from the East Coast negotiated a crossing of the Appalachian Mountains , taking to riverboats in Pennsylvania , poling the keelboats to Missouri River wagon train assembly ports , and then travelling in a wagon train along the California Trail . Many others came by way of the Isthmus of Panama and the steamships of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company . Australians and New Zealanders picked up the news from ships carrying Hawaiian newspapers , and thousands , infected with " gold fever " , boarded ships for California . 
 Forty @-@ niners came from Latin America , particularly from the Mexican mining districts near Sonora and Chile . Gold @-@ seekers and merchants from Asia , primarily from China , began arriving in 1849 , at first in modest numbers to Gum San ( " Gold Mountain " ) , the name given to California in Chinese . The first immigrants from Europe , reeling from the effects of the Revolutions of 1848 and with a longer distance to travel , began arriving in late 1849 , mostly from France , with some Germans , Italians , and Britons . 
 It is estimated that approximately 90 @,@ 000 people arrived in California in 1849 — about half by land and half by sea . Of these , perhaps 50 @,@ 000 to 60 @,@ 000 were Americans , and the rest were from other countries . By 1855 , it is estimated at least 300 @,@ 000 gold @-@ seekers , merchants , and other immigrants had arrived in California from around the world . The largest group continued to be Americans , but there were tens of thousands each of Mexicans , Chinese , Britons , Australians French , and Latin Americans , together with many smaller groups of miners , such as African Americans , Filipinos , Basques and Turks . 
 People from small villages in the hills near Genova , Italy were among the first to settle permanently in the Sierra Nevada foothills ; they brought with them traditional agricultural skills , developed to survive cold winters . A modest number of miners of African ancestry ( probably less than 4 @,@ 000 ) had come from the Southern States , the Caribbean and Brazil . 
 A number of immigrants were from China . Several hundred Chinese arrived in California in 1849 and 1850 , and in 1852 more than 20 @,@ 000 landed in San Francisco . Their distinctive dress and appearance was highly recognizable in the goldfields , and created a degree of animosity towards the Chinese . 
 There were also women in the Gold Rush . They held various roles including prostitutes , single entrepreneurs , married women , poor and wealthy women . They were of various ethnicities including Anglo @-@ American , Hispanic , Native , European , Chinese , and Jewish . The reasons they came varied : some came with their husbands , refusing to be left behind to fend for themselves , some came because their husbands sent for them , and others came ( singles and widows ) for the adventure and economic opportunities . On the trail many people died from accidents , cholera , fever , and myriad other causes , and many women became widows before even setting eyes on California . While in California , women became widows quite frequently due to mining accidents , disease , or mining disputes of their husbands . Life in the goldfields offered opportunities for women to break from their traditional work . 
 = = Legal rights = = 
 When the Gold Rush began , the California goldfields were peculiarly lawless places . When gold was discovered at Sutter 's Mill , California was still technically part of Mexico , under American military occupation as the result of the Mexican – American War . With the signing of the treaty ending the war on February 2 , 1848 , California became a possession of the United States , but it was not a formal " territory " and did not become a state until September 9 , 1850 . California existed in the unusual condition of a region under military control . There was no civil legislature , executive or judicial body for the entire region . Local residents operated under a confusing and changing mixture of Mexican rules , American principles , and personal dictates . Lax enforcement of federal laws , such as the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 , encouraged the arrival of free blacks and escaped slaves . 
 While the treaty ending the Mexican – American War obliged the United States to honor Mexican land grants , almost all the goldfields were outside those grants . Instead , the goldfields were primarily on " public land " , meaning land formally owned by the United States government . However , there were no legal rules yet in place , and no practical enforcement mechanisms . 
 The benefit to the forty @-@ niners was that the gold was simply " free for the taking " at first . In the goldfields at the beginning , there was no private property , no licensing fees , and no taxes . The miners informally adapted Mexican mining law that had existed in California . For example , the rules attempted to balance the rights of early arrivers at a site with later arrivers ; a " claim " could be " staked " by a prospector , but that claim was valid only as long as it was being actively worked . 
 Miners worked at a claim only long enough to determine its potential . If a claim was deemed as low @-@ value — as most were — miners would abandon the site in search for a better one . In the case where a claim was abandoned or not worked upon , other miners would " claim @-@ jump " the land . " Claim @-@ jumping " meant that a miner began work on a previously claimed site . Disputes were often handled personally and violently , and were sometimes addressed by groups of prospectors acting as arbitrators . This often led to heightened ethnic tensions . In some areas the influx of many prospectors could lead to a reduction of the existing claim size by simple pressure . 
 = = Development of gold @-@ recovery techniques = = 
 Four hundred million years ago , California lay at the bottom of a large sea ; underwater volcanoes deposited lava and minerals ( including gold ) onto the sea floor . By tectonic forces these minerals and rocks came to the surface of the Sierra Nevada , and eroded . Water carried the exposed gold downstream and deposited it in quiet gravel beds along the sides of old rivers and streams . The forty @-@ niners first focused their efforts on these deposits of gold . 
 Because the gold in the California gravel beds was so richly concentrated , early forty @-@ niners were able to retrieve loose gold flakes and nuggets with their hands , or simply " pan " for gold in rivers and streams . However , panning cannot take place on a large scale , and industrious miners and groups of miners graduated to placer mining , using " cradles " and " rockers " or " long @-@ toms " to process larger volumes of gravel . Miners would also engage in " <unk> " , a method that involved digging a shaft 6 to 13 meters ( 20 to 43 ft ) deep into placer deposits along a stream . Tunnels were then dug in all directions to reach the richest veins of pay dirt . 
 In the most complex placer mining , groups of prospectors would divert the water from an entire river into a sluice alongside the river , and then dig for gold in the newly exposed river bottom . Modern estimates by the U.S. Geological Survey are that some 12 million ounces ( 370 t ) of gold were removed in the first five years of the Gold Rush ( worth over US $ 16 billion at December 2010 prices ) . 
 In the next stage , by 1853 , hydraulic mining was used on ancient gold @-@ bearing gravel beds on hillsides and bluffs in the goldfields . In a modern style of hydraulic mining first developed in California , and later used around the world , a high @-@ pressure hose directed a powerful stream or jet of water at gold @-@ bearing gravel beds . The loosened gravel and gold would then pass over sluices , with the gold settling to the bottom where it was collected . By the mid @-@ 1880s , it is estimated that 11 million ounces ( 340 t ) of gold ( worth approximately US $ 15 billion at December 2010 prices ) had been recovered by " <unk> " . 
 A byproduct of these extraction methods was that large amounts of gravel , silt , heavy metals , and other pollutants went into streams and rivers . As of 1999 many areas still bear the scars of hydraulic mining , since the resulting exposed earth and downstream gravel deposits do not support plant life . 
 After the Gold Rush had concluded , gold recovery operations continued . The final stage to recover loose gold was to prospect for gold that had slowly washed down into the flat river bottoms and sandbars of California 's Central Valley and other gold @-@ bearing areas of California ( such as Scott Valley in Siskiyou County ) . By the late 1890s , dredging technology ( also invented in California ) had become economical , and it is estimated that more than 20 million ounces ( 620 t ) were recovered by dredging ( worth approximately US $ 28 billion at December 2010 prices ) . 
 Both during the Gold Rush and in the decades that followed , gold @-@ seekers also engaged in " hard @-@ rock " mining , that is , extracting the gold directly from the rock that contained it ( typically quartz ) , usually by digging and blasting to follow and remove veins of the gold @-@ bearing quartz . By 1851 , quartz mining had become the major industry of Coloma . Once the gold @-@ bearing rocks were brought to surface , the rocks were crushed and the gold separated , either using separation in water , using its density difference from quartz sand , or by washing the sand over copper plates coated with mercury ( with which gold forms an amalgam ) . Loss of mercury in the amalgamation process was a source of environmental contamination . Eventually , hard @-@ rock mining wound up becoming the single largest source of gold produced in the Gold Country . The total production of gold in California from then till now is estimated at 118 million ounces ( 3700 t ) . 
 = = Profits = = 
 Recent scholarship confirms that merchants made far more money than miners during the Gold Rush . The wealthiest man in California during the early years of the rush was Samuel Brannan , a tireless self @-@ promoter , shopkeeper and newspaper publisher . Brannan opened the first supply stores in Sacramento , Coloma , and other spots in the goldfields . Just as the rush began he purchased all the prospecting supplies available in San Francisco and re @-@ sold them at a substantial profit . 
 Some gold @-@ seekers made a significant amount of money . On average , half the gold @-@ seekers made a modest profit , after taking all expenses into account ; economic historians have suggested that white miners were more successful than black , Indian , or Chinese miners . Most late arrivals made little or wound up losing money . Similarly , many unlucky merchants set up in settlements which disappeared , or which succumbed to one of the calamitous fires that swept the towns that sprang up . By contrast , a businessman who went on to great success was Levi Strauss , who first began selling denim overalls in San Francisco in 1853 . 
 Other businessmen , through good fortune and hard work , reaped great rewards in retail , shipping , entertainment , lodging , or transportation . <unk> , food preparation , sewing , and laundry were highly profitable businesses often run by women ( married , single , or widowed ) who realized men would pay well for a service done by a woman . <unk> also brought in large profits , especially when combined with saloons and gaming houses . 
 By 1855 , the economic climate had changed dramatically . Gold could be retrieved profitably from the goldfields only by medium to large groups of workers , either in partnerships or as employees . By the mid @-@ 1850s , it was the owners of these gold @-@ mining companies who made the money . Also , the population and economy of California had become large and diverse enough that money could be made in a wide variety of conventional businesses . 
 = = = Path of the gold = = = 
 Once extracted , the gold itself took many paths . First , much of the gold was used locally to purchase food , supplies and lodging for the miners . It also went towards entertainment , which consisted of anything from a traveling theater to alcohol , gambling , and prostitutes . These transactions often took place using the recently recovered gold , carefully weighed out . These merchants and vendors in turn used the gold to purchase supplies from ship captains or packers bringing goods to California . 
 The gold then left California aboard ships or mules to go to the makers of the goods from around the world . A second path was the Argonauts themselves who , having personally acquired a sufficient amount , sent the gold home , or returned home taking with them their hard @-@ earned " diggings " . For example , one estimate is that some US $ 80 million worth of California gold was sent to France by French prospectors and merchants . 
 As the Gold Rush progressed , local banks and gold dealers issued " banknotes " or " drafts " — locally accepted paper currency — in exchange for gold , and private mints created private gold coins . With the building of the San Francisco Mint in 1854 , gold bullion was turned into official United States gold coins for circulation . The gold was also later sent by California banks to U.S. national banks in exchange for national paper currency to be used in the booming California economy .

 The Gold Rush propelled California from a sleepy , little @-@ known backwater to a center of the global imagination and the destination of hundreds of thousands of people .

 Large @-@ scale agriculture ( California 's second " Gold Rush " ) began during this time . Roads , schools , churches , and civic organizations quickly came into existence . The vast majority of the immigrants were Americans . Pressure grew for better communications and political connections to the rest of the United States , leading to statehood for California on September 9 , 1850 , in the Compromise of 1850 as the 31st state of the United States . 
 Between 1847 and 1870 , the population of San Francisco increased from 500 to 150 @,@ 000 . The Gold Rush wealth and population increase led to significantly improved transportation between California and the East Coast . The Panama Railway , spanning the Isthmus of Panama , was finished in 1855 . Steamships , including those owned by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company , began regular service from San Francisco to Panama , where passengers , goods and mail would take the train across the Isthmus and board steamships headed to the East Coast . One ill @-@ fated journey , that of the S.S. Central America , ended in disaster as the ship sank in a hurricane off the coast of the Carolinas in 1857 , with approximately three tons of California gold aboard . 
 = = = Impact on Native Americans = = = 
 The human and environmental costs of the Gold Rush were substantial . Native Americans , dependent on traditional hunting , gathering and agriculture , became the victims of starvation , as gravel , silt and toxic chemicals from prospecting operations killed fish and destroyed habitats . The surge in the mining population also resulted in the disappearance of game and food gathering locales as gold camps and other settlements were built amidst them . Later farming spread to supply the settlers ' camps , taking more land away from the Native Americans . 
 Miners often saw Native Americans as impediments to their mining activities . Ed Allen , interpretive lead for Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park , reported that there were times when miners would kill up to 50 or more Natives in one day . Retribution attacks on solitary miners could result in larger scale attacks against Native populations , at times tribes or villages not involved in the original act . During the 1852 Bridge Gulch Massacre , a group of settlers attacked a band of Wintu Indians in response to the killing of a citizen named J. R. Anderson . After his killing , the sheriff led a group of men to track down the Indians , whom the men then attacked . Only three children survived the massacre that was against a different band of Wintu than the one that had killed Anderson . 
 The Act for the Government and Protection of Indians , passed on April 22 , 1850 by the California Legislature , allowed settlers to capture and use Native people as bonded workers . 
 In some areas , systematic attacks against tribespeople in or near mining districts occurred . Various conflicts were fought between natives and settlers . The factors of disease , however do not minimize the tone of racial violence directed towards California Indians . Peter Burnett , California 's first governor declared that California was a battleground between the races and that there were only two options towards California Indians , extermination or removal . According to demographer Russell Thornton , between 1849 and 1890 , the Indigenous population of California fell below 20 @,@ 000 – primarily because of the killings . In contrast , according to the government of California , only some 4 @,@ 500 Native Americans suffered violent deaths between 1849 and 1870 . Furthermore , California stood in opposition of ratifying the eighteen treaties signed between tribal leaders and federal agents in 1851 . 
 After the initial boom had ended , explicitly anti @-@ foreign and racist attacks , laws and <unk> taxes sought to drive out foreigners — not just Native Americans — from the mines , especially the Chinese and Latin American immigrants mostly from Sonora , Mexico and Chile . The toll on the American immigrants was severe as well : one in twelve forty @-@ niners perished , as the death and crime rates during the Gold Rush were extraordinarily high , and the resulting vigilantism also took its toll . 
 = = = World @-@ wide economic stimulation = = = 
 The Gold Rush stimulated economies around the world as well . Farmers in Chile , Australia , and Hawaii found a huge new market for their food ; British manufactured goods were in high demand ; clothing and even prefabricated houses arrived from China . The return of large amounts of California gold to pay for these goods raised prices and stimulated investment and the creation of jobs around the world . Australian prospector Edward Hargraves , noting similarities between the geography of California and his home country , returned to Australia to discover gold and spark the Australian gold rushes . Preceding the Gold Rush , the United States was on a bi @-@ metallic standard , but the sudden increase in physical gold supply increased the relative value of physical silver and drove silver money from circulation . The increase in gold supply also created a monetary supply shock . 
 Within a few years after the end of the Gold Rush , in 1863 , the groundbreaking ceremony for the western leg of the First Transcontinental Railroad was held in Sacramento . The line 's completion , some six years later , financed in part with Gold Rush money , united California with the central and eastern United States . Travel that had taken weeks or even months could now be accomplished in days .

 California 's name became indelibly connected with the Gold Rush , and fast success in a new world became known as the " California Dream . " California was perceived as a place of new beginnings , where great wealth could reward hard work and good luck . Historian H. W. Brands noted that in the years after the Gold Rush , the California Dream spread across the nation : 
 Overnight California gained the international reputation as the " golden state " . Generations of immigrants have been attracted by the California Dream . California farmers , oil drillers , movie makers , airplane builders , and " dot @-@ com " entrepreneurs have each had their boom times in the decades after the Gold Rush . 
 Included among the modern legacies of the California Gold Rush are the California state motto , " Eureka " ( " I have found it " ) , Gold Rush images on the California State Seal , and the state nickname , " The Golden State " , as well as place names , such as Placer County , Rough and Ready , Placerville ( formerly named " Dry Diggings " and then " <unk> " during rush time ) , Whiskeytown , Drytown , Angels Camp , Happy Camp , and Sawyers Bar . The San Francisco 49ers National Football League team , and the similarly named athletic teams of California State University , Long Beach , are named for the prospectors of the California Gold Rush . 
 In <unk> the standard route shield of state highways in California is in the shape of a miner 's spade to honor the California Gold Rush . Today , aptly named State Route 49 travels through the Sierra Nevada foothills , connecting many Gold Rush @-@ era towns such as Placerville , Auburn , Grass Valley , Nevada City , Coloma , Jackson , and Sonora . This state highway also passes very near Columbia State Historic Park , a protected area encompassing the historic business district of the town of Columbia ; the park has preserved many Gold Rush @-@ era buildings , which are presently occupied by tourist @-@ oriented businesses .

 = Stroma , Scotland = 
 Stroma is an island off the northern coast of the mainland of Scotland . It is the most southerly of the islands in the Pentland Firth between the Orkney islands and Caithness , the northeasternmost part of the mainland . The name is from the Old Norse <unk> @-@ øy meaning " island in the [ tidal ] stream " . 
 The island 's population fell from 375 people in 1901 to just 12 by 1961 . The last native islanders left at the end of the following year , while Stroma 's final abandonment came in 1997 when the lighthouse keepers and their families departed . Ancient stone structures testify to the presence of Stroma 's earliest residents , while a Norse presence around 900 – 1 @,@ 000 years ago is recorded in the Orkneyinga Saga . It has been politically united with Caithness since at least the 15th century . Although Stroma lies only a few miles off the Scottish coast , the savage weather and ferociously strong tides of the Pentland Firth meant that the island 's inhabitants were very isolated , causing them to be largely self @-@ sufficient , trading agricultural produce and fish with the mainlanders . 
 Most of the islanders were fishermen and crofters ; some also worked as maritime pilots to guide vessels through the treacherous waters of the Pentland Firth . The tides and currents meant that shipwrecks were frequent — the most recent occurring in 1993 — and salvage provided an additional though often illegal supplement to the islanders ' incomes . A lighthouse was built on Stroma in 1890 and still operates under automation . 
 Stroma is now abandoned , with the houses of its former inhabitants unoccupied and falling into ruin . Its population fell gradually through the first half of the 20th century as inhabitants drifted away to seek opportunities elsewhere , as economic problems and Stroma 's isolation made life on the island increasingly unsupportable . From an all @-@ time peak of 375 people in 1901 , the population fell to just 12 by 1961 and the last islanders left at the end of the following year . The island is now owned by one of its former inhabitants , who uses it to graze cattle and sheep . 
 = = Geography , geology , flora and fauna = = 
 Stroma is located in the Pentland Firth about 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) northwest of John o ' Groats on the mainland . The island divides the firth into two channels , the Inner Sound to the south and the Outer Sound to the north . It is mostly low @-@ lying and flat , covering an area of around 375 hectares ( 930 acres ) and rising to a height of 53 m ( 174 ft ) at Cairn Hill in the southeast . It is oriented in a north @-@ south direction , measuring about 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) long by 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) wide . 
 The island is ringed by cliffs that vary in height from around 33 m ( 108 ft ) on the west coast to low cliffs with a narrow rocky foreshore elsewhere . The eastern side of the island slopes downward in an easterly or southeasterly direction , with the angle of the slope increasing from around 3 degrees in the centre of the island to about 30 degrees on the east coast . The bedrock of the island consists of flat layers of weathered Middle Old Red Sandstone , known as Rousay flags . A six @-@ foot band of the fine @-@ grained stone used to be quarried on a small scale for use on the mainland as roofing material . It is similar in composition to the Mey Beds on the mainland , though in some places on Stroma it is replaced by beds of angular and rounded masses of sandstone in a nodular matrix , similar to the <unk> Beds in Caithness . Only fragmentary fossil remains have been found ; these include specimens of the extinct Devonian fish <unk> and <unk> . 
 Stroma is bisected by a fault which runs in a north @-@ south direction through its centre , intersected by another fault running in an east @-@ northeast direction across the north of the island . The soil on either side of the fault line is significantly different ; the eastern and southern parts of Stroma are covered by fertile clay fed by bedrock minerals , while less fertile boggy ground predominates on the west side . 
 The heavily indented coastline has a circumference of about 7 miles ( 11 km ) , punctuated by numerous <unk> or inlets created by the waves eroding the sea cliffs along fault lines . A partially collapsed sea cave called The <unk> is located in the northwest of the island . This feature is a deep rocky pit , filled with sea water . It is located at the junction of the two fault lines and is connected to the sea by a subterranean passage 165 yd ( 151 m ) long , created by erosion along the east @-@ northeast fault . The passage is said to have been used for smuggling ; the islanders reportedly concealed illegal distilling from HM Customs and Excise by hiding the stills and alcohol in a cave within The <unk> , called " the Malt Barn " , which was only accessible at low tide . 
 The flora and fauna of Stroma are similar to those of the mainland . The island is treeless ; its vegetation consists primarily of grasses , heather and small flowers . Seals are plentiful along its shores and are sometimes found inland during the breeding season . Both grey seals and harbour seals are present , with around 650 grey seal pups being born each year . Otters may also be present , as in other parts of mainland Caithness . The western cliffs are the site of colonies of terns , guillemots , fulmars and eider ducks . The cliffs are designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest within the North Caithness Cliffs Special Protection Area . The waters off Stroma support a number of cetacean species including minke whale , white @-@ beaked dolphin and harbour porpoise . 
 = = Demographics = = 
 Two settlements existed on Stroma : Nethertown , in the north of the island , and Uppertown or <unk> , in the south . They originally belonged to the Freswick estate , which owned Nethertown , and the Mey estate , which owned Uppertown . Between the two was Mains of Stroma , the island 's principal farm . A track runs the entire length of the island , connecting the lighthouse at the north tip with the two settlements and the harbour on the south coast . 
 The island is now uninhabited ; the last resident islanders left in 1962 and the very last inhabitants , the keepers of the island lighthouse and their families , left in 1997 when the lighthouse was automated . The population reached a peak of 375 in 1901 but censuses conducted between 1841 and 1961 tell the story of the collapse of Stroma 's population during the 20th century :

 = = = Prehistoric settlement and remains = = = 
 Stroma was inhabited in prehistoric times , as demonstrated by the presence of a number of ancient stone structures around the island . A ruined chambered cairn is situated at the far north end of the island near the lighthouse . It has been partially excavated and measures some 16 m ( 52 ft ) in diameter by 1 @.@ 8 m ( 5 @.@ 9 ft ) high . The 18th century inhabitants of the island collected the prehistoric stone arrowheads that they found on the western side of the island , believing them to be " elf @-@ shot " , and regarded them as having been made by fairies . They believed that if they possessed an " elf @-@ shot " they would be granted protection for themselves and their cattle from any harm caused by the fairies . 
 Structures similar to cists , which the islanders called " Picts ' Beds " , are also found on the island . Notable examples can be seen in the north near Nethertown . They are usually located near middens , out of which animal bones and shells are eroding . Little appears to be known about the purpose and origins of these structures . Although the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland attributes them to prehistory , it is also possible that they are Norse in origin . A kidney @-@ shaped burnt mound located near Castle Geo in the south @-@ east of Stroma can be more confidently ascribed to prehistory . It consists of an accumulation of cracked and scorched stones that were used to heat water in a communal cooking trough . Although the example on Stroma has not been dated , burnt mounds found elsewhere on Orkney and Shetland have been dated to the Bronze Age and the early Iron Age . 
 The remains of an earth @-@ and @-@ stone fort are situated on the promontory of <unk> o ' Camm on the west coast of Stroma , near the north end of the island , though its origins are unknown . A rampart standing 1 m ( 3 ft 3 in ) with an average spread of 6 m ( 20 ft ) encloses an area of some 70 m ( 230 ft ) by 30 m ( 98 ft ) and blocks off access to the promontory . There is no evidence of structures inside the fort 's perimeter . It may possibly have been entered from the east end of the rampart , where a 3 m ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) gap exists , but this may alternatively have been produced by natural processes . 
 = = = Medieval period = = = 
 The first historical record of the island is found in the 12th century Orkneyinga Saga . It records that a man named Valthiof , the son of Olaf <unk> , lived and farmed on Stroma . One Yule Eve , he set off in a ten @-@ oar boat to Orphir on Mainland , Orkney at the invitation of the Earl of Orkney , Paul Haakonsson . However , the boat was lost with all hands – as the Saga puts it , " sad news as Valthiof was a most accomplished man " . The Earl later granted Valthiof 's farm to Thorkel <unk> . Later , a rowdy Viking named Sweyn Asleifsson fled to Stroma , pursued by Earl Harald Haakonsson . The two men were trapped on the island due to bad weather but were persuaded to make peace by a mutual friend named <unk> , who insisted that Sweyn and Harald should share the same bed . 
 The Norse are also believed to have built a fortification , now called Castle <unk> , at Mell Head in the far south @-@ west of Stroma . The structure ( also known as " the Robber 's Castle " ) is situated on the top of an isolated rock stack some 4 @.@ 5 metres ( 15 ft ) from the cliffs of the main island . The islanders believed that it had once been connected by a drawbridge or some other kind of artificial span , or alternatively it may once have been accessible via a rock arch that has since collapsed . 
 Due to its proximity to the Scottish mainland , Stroma has long been politically united with Caithness . An old story tells that possession of the island was once disputed between the Earls of Orkney and Caithness . To resolve the dispute , they relied on a legend that venomous animals would thrive in Caithness but die in Orkney . Some venomous snakes were duly imported to Stroma and survived there , " proving " that the island did in fact belong to Caithness and not Orkney . 
 It is more reliably recorded that in 1455 the Bishop of Caithness , William <unk> , granted Stroma and other lands and castles to his brother Gilbert . It eventually passed into the hands of the Sinclair family , who have held the title of Earl of Caithness since 1455 . In 1659 George Sinclair , the 6th Earl of Caithness , granted the wadset of Stroma to John Kennedy of <unk> , who had fled to the far north after being outlawed following the fatal wounding of John Forbes of Watertown . 
 115 years later , the Rev. George Low recorded in his account of a tour of the island that he had seen " the remains of a pretty large house and gardens , once possessed by a gentleman , the proprietor of the island , who being forced to fly his native home on account of a duel , chose this for his retreat " . The gardens were said to have been furnished with " plants that cured every disease " . Nothing is now left of the house , but the gardens may have been located within a walled enclosure near the Nethertown pier . 
 = = = Life on Stroma : 17th and 18th centuries = = = 
 Life on the island was very isolated due to its inaccessibility . Until as late as 1894 it had no landing place , which meant that boats had to be landed directly on the beach and pulled up above the waterline . Particularly in winter , when storms raged through the Pentland Firth , Stroma could be cut off for weeks at a time . Such episodes posed serious risks to the islanders , as they had no doctor . The winter of 1937 illustrated the problems that the weather could pose ; during January and February that year , the island was cut off for three weeks by violent gales which demolished houses along the seafront and washed boats 100 yards ( 90 m ) inland . Stroma 's isolation came at an especially bad time , as most of the population had caught influenza and supplies of food dwindled to the point that some items had to be rationed . Eventually two boats were able to reach the island , carrying supplies and a doctor from Caithness , along with three weeks ' worth of mail . 
 Two chapels were established on Stroma at some point prior to the 17th century ; they were known as the Kirk of Stara ( from the Norse name for " big church " ) and the Kirk of Old <unk> ( from <unk> , possibly a name given to a farm ) . Their locations are now unknown , but the Kirk of Old <unk> may have been located in the far south @-@ east of Stroma where the island 's graveyard is now . They both fell into disuse by the mid @-@ 17th century and , lacking a church of their own , it was perhaps not surprising that the islanders were felt by mainlanders to be somewhat lacking in religious commitment . An inquiry by the Canisbay Kirk in the 17th century rebuked them for visiting " Popish " chapels on the mainland , profaning the Lord 's Day , being " ale sellers and drinkers " and playing football and dancing on the Sabbath . The Presbytery decided that the inhabitants were spiritually neglected " by reason of the dangerous passage to that place , especially in winter . " The minister of Canisbay was supposed to preach four times a year on Stroma but was reprimanded for only doing so twice yearly . The islanders were instructed to attend church at Canisbay and a kirk session ordained in 1654 that they should be given free passage and that any Stroma person with a boat who stayed away should be fined . 
 The island 's population numbered a few dozen families throughout the 18th century , corresponding to a population of no more than a couple of hundred people ; it was recorded as numbering 30 families in 1710 , 47 in 1724 , 40 in 1735 and 30 in 1760 . They rented their land from two branches of the Sinclair family , the Sinclairs of Mey who owned Uppertown and the Sinclairs of Freswick who owned Nethertown . The latter acquired Nethertown in 1721 and eventually took possession of Uppertown as well by obtaining the wadset from the Kennedys , reportedly through skullduggery . According to the deathbed confession of one of the witnesses to the transaction , the laird , Sinclair of Freswick , obtained the " assent " of the deceased Kennedy holder of the wadset by placing a quill in the dead man 's hand and moving it to make the corpse write its name on the document . The other witness committed suicide , perhaps out of guilt . The island was reasonably profitable for the Sinclairs ; in 1724 the islanders paid an annual rent of 1 @,@ 300 marks ( equivalent to about £ 125 at 2011 prices ) , part of which was paid in surplus grain ferried by Stroma 's boats to the Sinclair granaries at <unk> near Wick . They were self @-@ sufficient in dairy produce and were known for the quality of their cheese @-@ making ; Daniel Defoe thought Stroma cheese was excellent . 
 = = = 19th and 20th centuries = = = 
 By the early 19th century , around 30 families numbering 170 people lived on Stroma , farming land allocated on the traditional run rig system . The island was said to be " very productive in corn " , though the inhabitants did not make use of ploughs ; instead , they dug high beds or ridges , which produced greater yields than ploughing would have . George Low wrote in his 1774 account of the island that " the soil is good , black and deep , thrown up into high ridges by the spade , in a word the whole cultivated part of the Island is dressed like a garden and produces far greater crops than are common on plowed ground . " Agricultural life on the island followed a fairly typical crofting pattern , with the average Stroma croft being about 10 acres ( 4 @.@ 0 ha ) in size . Families usually kept a few cows , sheep and hens , along with a single horse and pig . They grew a variety of crops such as oats , potatoes , hay and turnips , obtained water from wells and used horses to meet their transportation needs . As well as agricultural exports , they also exported flagstones from the island and imported peat to burn as fuel ; they were dismissive of the practice in some of the Orkney Islands of using cow dung as fuel , referring to the northern island of Sanday as " the little island where the coos shit fire " . Low observed the effect of the island 's climate on the inhabitants : " The men are stout hardy <unk> as was said before , the women while young are tolerably well looked , but as they advance in age grow very hard favoured , acquiring a peculiar <unk> in their countenances contrary to what is observed of the women in Orkney . " 
 The islanders also supported themselves through fishing , exploiting the high @-@ quality catches that were to be made around the island 's coasts . James Traill Calder wrote in his 1861 Sketch of the Civil and Traditional History of Caithness that " The finest cod in the north is to be got in the Pentland Firth ... Large and excellent lobsters are caught around the island [ of Stroma ] . " As well as trapping lobsters , the islanders practised hand line cod fishing in the waters of the Firth . This involved towing lengths of line with heavy weights and a metal rod or <unk> at one end , from which hung a short length of hemp and hook baited with limpets . To encourage the fish to bite , the boats had to be held still by their rowers , which required great skill in the Firth 's unpredictable currents . The island was noted for its native type of boat , the Stroma <unk> , which was a direct descendant of the old Norse longship . 
 Many of the male islanders utilised their knowledge of the Firth 's currents to hire themselves out to passing vessels as maritime pilots . Their expertise was the product of a lifetime 's experience on the waters of the Firth ; as it was said , they had been " dabbling in salt water from their childhood upwards " . Indeed , the whole island was drenched in salt water thrown up by the powerful tides and storms to which it was subjected , particularly in the winter . The Statistical Account of Scotland noted that during a storm the sea level on the west of the island was more than two fathoms [ 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) ] higher than on the east side , and that the spray was thrown so high that it washed over the cliff tops " and falls in such profusion as to run in rills to the opposite shore " . The islanders took advantage of this phenomenon by capturing the water in a reservoir to power a watermill which ground their grain in the winter months . It is not now known exactly where the mill was or what happened to it . Although it is described in the Statistical Account , written in the 1790s , and a Robert Miller is listed in the 1851 census as its miller , by 1861 he had moved to farm a five @-@ acre croft and no further mention is made of the mill in contemporary accounts . 
 Stroma 's violent storms occasionally wrought destruction on the island . In December 1862 , a great storm broke over the island with such force that it swept right across the northern end of Stroma , leaving wreckage , rocks and seaweed on the top of the 100 @-@ foot @-@ high cliffs and destroying the channels leading to the watermill . However , the sea 's destructive power had one positive benefit for the islanders , if not for those caught out by the currents and shoals of the Pentland Firth . Over the last two hundred years , over sixty vessels ranging from fishing boats to large cargo vessels have been wrecked on the shores of Stroma , with many more vessels coming to grief on the reefs and shoals of the neighbouring mainland and Orkney coasts . Many vessels – at least 560 between 1830 and 1990 – have had to be refloated in the Pentland Firth after getting into difficulties . Shipwrecks were a valuable source of income , timber and goods for the islanders , who would salvage liberally – and often with little regard for legality – whenever a stranded ship was abandoned . The building of Stroma 's first lighthouse in the late 19th century was initially opposed by some of the islanders who were more concerned with profiting from shipwrecks than preventing them . 
 The shipwrecks continued , nonetheless , with one of the most profitable of all being the 1931 wreck of the 6 @,@ 000 @-@ ton Danish freighter Pennsylvania on the neighbouring island of Swona . The vessel was plundered by the inhabitants of Stroma , Swona and South Ronaldsay . Much of her cargo of slot machines , spark plugs , clothing , tobacco , watches and car parts was looted and concealed in haystacks , <unk> , lochs and caves . David <unk> , a lifeboatman , recalled seeing what the islanders did with their illicit salvage : " Every house was stuffed with wreck [ salvage ] ... clocks , telescopes , <unk> ... I seem to remember enormous dining @-@ room tables in small cottages . And then of course from time to time they 'd have cargo parts of lorries or something like that which could be put together to make a lorry and taken ashore on two or three fishing boats in calm weather . They 'd land it quietly somewhere , drive it along and sell it . " Customs officers , policemen , <unk> and Receivers of Wreck were not generally welcome – the island had no police force – and the islanders let it be understood that unfortunate things could happen to the boats of unwanted visitors : " Police boats could go missing , develop an unexpected leak or spontaneously combust . " The area still presents hazards to passing ships ; in January 1993 , the Danish coaster Bettina Danica ran aground off the southern end of Stroma . The wreck was broken apart by the action of the sea in 1997 and only her stern section is still visible . 
 Another way the islanders supported themselves was through the illicit brewing of spirits as a way of boosting their income – a common practice among the older people . An inspector who visited the island 's school in 1824 described the inhabitants of Stroma as " all professed smugglers " . The suppression of smuggling by the authorities led to a significant drop in the island 's population the first half of the 19th century . The census of 1841 noted : " now smuggling being completely suppressed , several families have left the island and removed to the Orkneys to follow more lawful pursuits . " While smuggling may have been tackled , illicit distilling continued for many years . One former inhabitant , Mrs. David Gunn , recalled in 1971 how her great @-@ grandmother had managed to avoid the " excisemen " ( customs officers ) confiscating her illegally brewed alcohol : 
 My great @-@ granny , a woman Kirsty Banks frae Stroma – she <unk> supposed to be very clever , but faith ! She hed all her wits boot her . They used to <unk> a bit о <unk> in that time , on their own of <unk> , and wan time they hed a <unk> ready , fan they <unk> ' at ' e excisemen were comin . <unk> she 'd <unk> a stillborn bairn no long afore ' at , an ' e excisemen kent ' at . And they 'd no time til hide ' e malt . So she <unk> ' e bairns til make up a bed til her in ' e kitchen , and til put ' e malt in ' e bed , and she wes lyin on ' at fan ' e excisemen came in . And she <unk> them ' at she 'd hidden a stillborn bairn no long afore ' at , and she <unk> feelin very weil , but ' e bairns wanted her in ' e kitchen , til guide them and tell them fat til do . And ' e excisemen kent that was true , they kent she 'd <unk> a bairn . So they searched ' e rest о the <unk> , but they <unk> touch ' e bed , and they got off wi ' it . 
 Despite their physical isolation , the islanders maintained a lively community . A school had been established in 1723 by the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge ( SPCK ) , with sixty children on its initial attendance roll . The demands of island life conflicted to some extent with those of schooling . The SPCK 's inspector found only eighteen out of seventy pupils present when he visited in 1824 . He found that many of the children were fully occupied helping their families in summer and only attended school in winter . Two places of worship were built within a couple of years of each other , a Baptist chapel in 1877 and a Church of Scotland church in 1878 ( at a cost of £ 900 ) . Although they soon became focal elements of community life , there seems to have been some bad blood between the two congregations , perhaps due to a clash between the missionary zeal of local Baptists and the Calvinism of the Presbyterian Kirk . 
 The inhabitants of Stroma were highly self @-@ sufficient , and many practiced additional trades such as carpentry or roof @-@ laying in addition to their " day jobs " in fishing or crofting . They built their own houses and boats , produced most of their own food , maintained farm equipment , shod their own horses , and made their own clothes , boots and shoes . In the 1920s they built their own wind turbines to recharge the batteries of their radio sets . By the end of the 19th century the island had three shops including a grocery . Any additional needs were met by purchasing supplies from shops at Wick and Thurso on the mainland or by mail @-@ order from catalogues . For a while , they were also able to use the services of a floating shop which came periodically from Orkney to Stroma . Customers were rowed out to buy groceries , flour , animal feed , paraffin and clothes in exchange for lobsters , wet salted fish and eggs . 
 Most of the houses on Stroma are single @-@ storey stone @-@ built structures with two main rooms ( a " butt " and a " ben " ) plus a closet ( a small bedroom ) and a porch . The rooms were small and simply furnished , incorporating recessed box beds . These consisted of a series of wooden planks with a layer of straw on top , on which was placed a chaff @-@ filled mattress . The butt was used as a living room and included an iron stove with an oven , and sometimes a water tank to enable hot water to be generated , while the ben was used for visitors and as a sitting @-@ room . 
 One former islander , James Simpson , recalls that " we had about two hundred and fifty folks here when I was a boy . It never seemed a lonely place . There were always people going in and out of each other 's houses , there were forty children at the school and there were two teachers . We had concerts ; three concerts in the winter when you had to sing loud to get above the sound of the wind . The young people would meet at the shop in the long , long evenings in summer . " The island had some distinctively eccentric characters : Donald Banks , the island 's coffin @-@ maker , was known for quarreling with his neighbours ( telling one family , " I 'll no bury any more o ' ye ! " ) and combining poetry with coffin @-@ making , as in the order he placed with a mainland supplier : 
 Dear Mr. Sutherland , 
 Would you be so good , 
 To send eight planks of coffin wood . 
 Half inch lining , ( dear Mr. Sutherland , ) 
 For those who are pining ... 
 Describing life on Stroma , Simpson comments : 
 There would be about fifty houses or crofts , small crofts , but they were reckoned to be better off than the fisherman in , say , Wick or <unk> . They set the croft down before they went off on the herring fishing – the herring was a big industry in that days . When the men went to the herring fishing , they had the croft ploughed ; the women fed the sheep and the cattle and milked the cow , and when they came home from the fishing they had <unk> for the winter feed and then they cut their harvest . When the herring fishing was finished , it was harvest time — it was a seasonal fishing , and it suited the Stroma men perfectly because their wives attended to the crofts . You could say the women in Stroma were liberated well before women 's lib . They 'd got men 's work to do – milk cows , make butter ; they were very industrious women . And then when the husband comes home they 'd have a fat pig to kill – that was your winter meat , all salted . 
 = = = Decline and abandonment = = = 
 Stroma 's population fell precipitously through the first half of the 20th century , leading eventually to the island 's final abandonment at the end of the 1950s . There was no single cause that precipitated the collapse of Stroma 's population . Living conditions on the island were always basic ; there was no running water or electricity , and gas only arrived in the 1950s , which contrasted poorly with the improvements being made on the mainland . The fishing deteriorated after the First World War , and crofting became an increasingly difficult way to make a living . The island was relatively overpopulated ; by 1901 the population was nearly twice that of sixty years previously , and there was little spare land left for farming . Families of six to eight children were common , but there was simply not enough work for all , so the eldest often left for the mainland or emigrated to Canada or the United States to find work . The lack of a proper harbour meant that the islanders could not make use of larger boats or develop a modern fishery . Young people started moving away to seek better @-@ paying opportunities elsewhere , eventually followed by their parents . 
 Both of the World Wars had a major impact on Stroma , which was only a dozen miles from the Royal Navy 's chief base at Scapa Flow in Orkney . Six islanders died in each of the World Wars ; the names of all twelve are inscribed on the island 's war memorial , and during the Second World War as much as a quarter of the population was on war service . Adding to the island 's economic problems , the introduction of the 11 @-@ plus exam in 1944 meant that all children over the age of 12 had to leave Stroma to complete their education at the secondary school in Wick . Because they could not commute between the island and Wick , they had to attend school as boarders , which incurred additional expenses for their parents . 
 Two other factors have often been cited in Stroma 's depopulation : the building of the nuclear power station at nearby Dounreay in the 1950s , which created many new jobs on the mainland , and in the same decade the construction of a harbour on Stroma on which many islanders were employed . Although it has been claimed that this gave the islanders the incentive ( and the means ) to leave , local historian Donald A. Young points out that of islanders who left after 1945 , only one went directly from Stroma to Dounreay . Most of the rest either continued fishing or carried on crofting on the mainland , while others found alternative jobs . Some ex @-@ islanders eventually found jobs at Dounreay , but they had already moved to the mainland for work or education . 
 The Sinclairs of Mey sold their portion of the island to Colonel F. B. Imbert @-@ Terry in 1929 , who sold it in turn to John Hoyland , an umbrella manufacturer from Yorkshire , in 1947 . Hoyland also acquired the remaining island estate of the Sinclairs of Freswick , uniting Stroma for a reported cost of £ 4 @,@ 000 . His tenure coincided with the final collapse of the island 's population . As the tenants left , Hoyland put Stroma on the market but found no buyers . A Caithness councilman suggested various schemes for Stroma , including establishing a nudist colony and using it as a site for a crematorium , but the council rejected suggestions that it should take on responsibility for the island . As the population left , the local economy disintegrated ; there were no longer enough able @-@ bodied men to man the fishing boats , and the remaining facilities on the island were closed down for lack of custom . The last store on the island , the Scottish Cooperative Wholesale Society shop , closed in 1956 . Only three families , numbering 16 people in total , were left by 1957 ; that year , the island 's school closed , by which time it only had two pupils . The Post Office closed in 1958 when the family which operated it left for the mainland . 
 In the summer of 1958 , Hoyland prompted controversy by offering the island to the American TV quiz show Bid ' n ' Buy as a prize . After an outcry on both sides of the Atlantic , the show 's producers settled for offering a car instead . In December 1960 , he sold Stroma to James Simpson , an islander whose family had moved to farm on the mainland near the Castle of Mey in 1943 . Simpson had not originally intended to buy the island but happened to be talking about it with a lawyer : " I said , ' I see Stroma was sold last week , and it 's not sold this week . Is it on the market ? ' ' Yes , ' he said , ' Stroma 's for sale . ' I said , " What kind of money ? " So he told me what kind of money , and there and then , the lawyer wrote that I , James Simpson , offered to buy the island of Stroma at a certain figure , and I signed my name at the end of it . " His wife was not enthusiastic about the purchase : " Lena nearly flew at me for being so stupid . She says , ' Stroma ? What on earth are you going to do with an island ? ' " . He was successful in his bid and used the island to graze his animals , repopulating it with around 200 sheep and 30 cattle . 
 By this time , the five @-@ member Manson family had become the last native inhabitants of Stroma , " Now liv [ ing ] in a silent community of empty houses , an empty church and an empty school . " Although the head of the family , Andrew Manson , called the island " a paradise in summer " and a place where he was " free of outside distractions and watching my sons growing from boyhood to manhood – teaching them to live like men , to be dependent on no one , " it was a bleak life for the women , who had applied for a council house at Scrabster , near Thurso . The <unk> finally left Stroma on 6 December 1962 , bringing to an end thousands of years of permanent habitation on the island . 
 = = = Island of ruins = = = 
 Stroma is now entirely deserted by humans ; its only permanent inhabitants are the seals , birds and sheep that live on the island . The church , school and old croft houses stand derelict , with many having fallen into ruin . The writer Bella Bathurst , visiting the island in the early 2010s , described the scene : 
 The houses along the main road down the spine of the island seem to have rotted at different rates . Those crofts , which have somehow managed to keep their glazing and their roof @-@ slates , are in much better condition than the others . In some , the furniture is still laid out as if only recently abandoned : iron bedsteads with mattresses , tables , armchairs , cupboards full of boots and bottles , everything arranged with the same care and compaction as it would be on a boat . But most crofts have already lost the war with the weather . As soon as the tiles go , the damp begins to <unk> into the mortaring ; within a couple of years all that is left are a few bony ribs and the stark gable ends . 
 Inside some of the houses , Bathurst writes , everyday objects still remain where they were left decades ago ; " the bed and the limed <unk> ceiling are intact , untouched even by the damp . The kitchen table still stands in the parlour and a framed and fading photograph gazes out from the top of the mantelpiece . " In another house seen 20 years earlier by Leslie Thomas , " was a rank of family photographs , shades in Victorian dress staring out forever into a room now desolate and holed , but which had once held the life of a warm family . " 
 Elsewhere , the books remain " dusty but tidy " in the abandoned school , and the church still contains its pulpit , " dumb and hung with ragged red <unk> " with prayer books " left to be trampled upon by heathen sheep and <unk> by rabbits and rats . " In the former post office , forms and licence applications and a bottle of dried ink still stand on the counter , while in a back room stands " a nice dresser , upon which [ stands ] a teapot and a jug and some sheet music : ' Red Sails in the Sunset ' , ' The General 's Fast Asleep ' and ' You Can 't Do That There ' Ere . ' Nobody on Stroma will ever sing those songs now . " 
 Bathurst and Thomas express contrasting views on the significance of Stroma 's abandonment . Thomas regards it as a tragedy : " Of all the out @-@ of @-@ the @-@ way places I have known , this was the saddest . It seemed as though its life had been ended in a fit of pique . " To Bathurst , however , " it is tempting to see Stroma 's abandonment as the result of some appalling trauma . Abandonment is always taken as a sign of failure , a collective death ... But Stroma does not feel sad . True , there is sorrow in seeing the once meticulous vegetable patches turned over to weeds , or wondering how many more winters the box beds will stand before they start to rot . But that isn 't the whole story . What is interesting about Stroma is not the fact of its abandonment , but the tale of its past . " 
 = = Communications = = 
 Stroma lacked a regular connection to the mainland until 1879 , when the Post Office subsidised a weekly boat service from Huna on the mainland and established a post office on the island . However , the volume of mail from Stroma proved so small that the service was grossly uneconomical . By the 1950s , the Post Office was spending 1s . 2d. for each letter worth 2 ½ d. in postage . 
 For many years , the islanders had no means of contacting the mainland in emergencies other than signalling with hand lamps and hoping that someone would see them . A radio telephone was installed in 1935 , and in 1953 a telephone cable was laid . A red telephone box was installed in the centre of the island , symbolic of the 6 millionth phone box installation in the UK . It is still there today , though no longer in use . 
 It was not until 1894 that Stroma gained its first artificial landing point , a pier built from Portland cement near Nethertown at a cost of £ 800 . In 1955 , Caithness County Council constructed a new harbour on the south coast of the island at the then great cost of £ 28 @,@ 500 . Although it was intended to help stem the exodus of people from the island , Stroma was abandoned only a few years after the harbour 's completion . 
 In the late 1930s Highland Airways looked into the possibility of including Stroma in the hospital ambulance plane service that was then in operation . On 19 August 1937 , Captain <unk> of Highland Airways landed a small aircraft in farmland adjoining the Mains of Stroma , and the following spring the islanders cleared an area of moorland on the west side of the island to create an airstrip . The first official flight landed in June 1938 . However , the Second World War prevented any further developments and a regular service was not established . After the war , Highland Airways was taken over by British European Airways , which abandoned any interest in serving the island . 
 Today , Stroma has no regular communications with the mainland . The island 's owner runs occasional boat trips there on weekends . 
 = = Notable buildings = = 
 = = = Lighthouse = = = 
 In 1890 , a lighthouse was built at Stroma 's northern tip , <unk> Point . It was only operational for six years before being replaced , and very little is now known about the structure . The unmanned lighthouse originally housed a Trotter @-@ Lindberg lamp which burned petroleum spirit or <unk> . The fuel supply was stored in cisterns near the lantern , which was regularly recharged at least fortnightly by the local fishermen or crofters . It was one of the first lighthouses in Scotland to use this type of " scintillating " light . 
 It was replaced in 1896 , possibly on the same site , by a new lighthouse built to a design by David Stevenson as part of a major programme of construction works around northern Scotland . A fog warning system was installed the following year . Stevenson 's lighthouse consists of a circular white @-@ painted stone tower standing 23 metres ( 75 ft ) high at an elevation of 32 metres ( 105 ft ) above Mean High Water with a number of buildings nearby to house generators and the lighthouse keepers . The light was converted to a paraffin lamp when the former <unk> lamp was found to be unsuitable . An oil store was installed in the lighthouse tower , ending the need for a separate building to hold the fuel . The lighthouse was subjected to a machine @-@ gun attack by a German aircraft on 22 February 1941 . It caused little damage and no injuries , and the keepers were soon able to make repairs . 
 Until 1961 the lighthouse was administered as a shore station , and subsequently ( after the resident population of Stroma had left ) as a rock station . An electric lamp with a maximum power of 1 @.@ 1 million cp was installed in 1972 , utilising a sealed beam optic mounted on a gearless revolving pedestal . By this time the keepers and their families were the only people living on Stroma . A helicopter pad was installed to enable supplies and personnel to be flown in . In 1997 the station was converted to automatic operation , utilising a 250 watt metal halide lamp which rotates on a gearless pedestal . A lens system from Sule Skerry lighthouse was refitted in the Stroma lighthouse . The old air @-@ driven fog horn was removed and replaced by an electric fog signal which is installed on the balcony of the lighthouse . The lighthouse station 's power , which was formerly obtained from generators , is now provided by batteries which are charged at regular intervals . The current light flashes white every 20 seconds and can be seen from a nominal range of 26 nautical miles ( 48 km ; 30 mi ) . 
 = = = Kennedy mausoleum and the mummies of Stroma = = = 
 One curious side @-@ effect of the constant spray of sea @-@ water over Stroma – apart from making the drinking water brackish and giving the air a constant salt taste – was that it mummified the corpses of some of the island 's inhabitants . They were housed in a mausoleum in the south @-@ east corner of Stroma , built by the Kennedy family in 1677 . The building still stands , although it is now unroofed ; it comprises a two @-@ storey structure which incorporates a burial vault and a doocot . The building was constructed from grey flagstones and pink sandstone quoins , measuring 25 ft ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) by 18 ft 5 in ( 5 @.@ 61 m ) externally and standing 22 ft ( 6 @.@ 7 m ) high . The lintel of the door has the inscription " <unk> " ( John Kennedy ) and the date 1677 carved into it . 
 The mummies of Stroma were something of a tourist attraction in the 18th century ; the Welsh naturalist and traveller Thomas Pennant described the mummies as " entire and uncorrupted bodies of persons who had been dead sixty years . I was informed that they were very light , had a flexibility in their limbs and were of a dusky color . " However , their popularity proved their undoing . In 1762 Bishop of Ross and Caithness Robert Forbes recorded in his journal that Murdoch Kennedy 
 ... played such wretched tricks on the Body of his Father , for the Diversion of Strangers , as in time broke it to pieces , and the Head was the part that fell first off . He used to place Strangers at his Father 's Feet , and by setting a Foot on one of his Father 's , he made the Body spring up speedily and salute them , which <unk> them greatly . Then , after laying the body down again , he beat a march upon the Belly , which sounded equally loud with a Drum . 
 By 1786 the mummies had been destroyed by cattle and careless visitors as , according to Walker 's Hibernian Magazine , " curiosity to see the mummies had brought many idle people to Stroma , [ and ] that some , out of <unk> had shattered the door , and others the bodies ; and the door not being repaired , sheep and cattle entered the vault , and trampled them to pieces . " There is now no trace of the original burials in the vault .

 Fox Sports Detroit traces its origins to 1996 , when News Corporation purchased 50 % of the Prime Network , a group of regional sports networks owned by Liberty Media , and immediately rebranded them under the " Fox Sports Net " banner . At the time of the purchase , Post @-@ Newsweek Stations ( owners of Detroit NBC affiliate WDIV @-@ TV , channel 4 ) owned the Detroit @-@ based Pro @-@ Am Sports System ( PASS Sports ) , which served the local affiliate of the Prime Network . News Corporation announced plans to launch a Fox Sports Net affiliate in Michigan by 1998 , and made a surprise bid for , and won , the local cable television rights to NBA games involving the Detroit Pistons . 
 When PASS Sports ' respective National Hockey League and Major League Baseball broadcast rights to the Detroit Red Wings and Detroit Tigers franchises came up for renewal , Fox Sports Net made a bid for the contracts and won them both . Fox Sports decided to push the launch date of the new channel forward in time for the beginning of the 1997 – 98 NHL season and 1998 MLB season ; Fox Sports Detroit began broadcasting on September 17 , 1997 . Post @-@ Newsweek , meanwhile , concluded that its coverage area was not large enough to support two <unk> and sold the remainder of its Tigers and Pistons contracts , and the contract of sportscaster John Keating , to Fox Sports Detroit . Post @-@ Newsweek shut down PASS Sports on October 31 , 1997 , leaving Fox Sports Detroit as the sole regional sports network in Michigan .

 = Charles I of Hungary = 
 Charles I , also known as Charles Robert ( Hungarian : Károly Róbert ; Croatian : Karlo Robert ; Slovak : Karol Róbert ; 1288 – 16 July 1342 ) was King of Hungary and Croatia from 1308 to his death . He was a member of the Capetian House of Anjou and the only son of Charles Martel , Prince of Salerno . His father was the eldest son of Charles II of Naples and Mary of Hungary . She laid claim to Hungary after her brother , Ladislaus IV of Hungary , died in 1290 , but the Hungarian prelates and lords elected her cousin , Andrew III , king . Instead of abandoning her claim to Hungary , she transferred it to her son , Charles Martel , and after his death in 1295 , to her grandson , Charles . On the other hand , her husband , Charles II of Naples , made their third son , Robert , heir to the Kingdom of Naples , thus disinheriting Charles . 
 Charles came to the Kingdom of Hungary upon the invitation of an influential Croatian lord , Paul Šubić , in August 1300 . Andrew III died on 14 January 1301 , and within four months Charles was crowned king , but with a provisional crown instead of the Holy Crown of Hungary . Most Hungarian noblemen refused to yield to him and elected Wenceslaus of Bohemia king . Charles withdrew to the southern regions of the kingdom . Pope Boniface VIII acknowledged Charles as the lawful king in 1303 , but Charles was unable to strengthen his position against his opponent . Wenceslaus abdicated in favor of Otto of Bavaria in 1305 . Because it had no central government , the Kingdom of Hungary had disintegrated into a dozen provinces , each headed by a powerful nobleman , or oligarch . One of those oligarchs , Ladislaus Kán , captured and imprisoned Otto of Bavaria in 1307 . Charles was elected king in Pest on 27 November 1308 , but his rule remained nominal in most parts of his kingdom even after he was crowned with the Holy Crown on 27 August 1310 . 
 Charles won his first decisive victory in the Battle of <unk> ( at present @-@ day <unk> in Slovakia ) on 15 June 1312 . After that his troops seized most fortresses of the powerful Aba family . During the next decade , Charles restored royal power primarily with the assistance of the prelates and lesser noblemen in most regions of the kingdom . After the death of the most powerful oligarch , Matthew Csák , in 1321 , Charles became the undisputed ruler of the whole kingdom , with the exception of Croatia where local noblemen were able to preserve their autonomous status . He was not able to hinder the development of Wallachia into an independent principality after his defeat in the Battle of Posada in 1330 . Charles 's contemporaries described his defeat in that battle as a punishment from God for his cruel revenge against the family of Felician Záh who had attempted to slaughter the royal family . 
 Charles rarely made perpetual land grants , instead introducing a system of " office fiefs " , whereby his officials enjoyed significant revenues , but only for the time they held a royal office , which ensured their loyalty . In the second half of his reign , Charles did not hold Diets and administered his kingdom with absolute power . He established the Order of Saint George , which was the first secular order of knights . He promoted the opening of new gold mines , which made Hungary the largest producer of gold in Europe . The first Hungarian gold coins were minted during his reign . At the congress of Visegrád in 1335 , he mediated a reconciliation between two neighboring monarchs , John of Bohemia and Casimir III of Poland . Treaties signed at the same congress also contributed to the development of new commercial routes linking Hungary with Western Europe . Charles 's efforts to reunite Hungary , together with his administrative and economic reforms , established the basis for the achievements of his successor , Louis the Great .

 Charles was the only son of Charles Martel , Prince of Salerno , and his wife , <unk> of Habsburg . He was born in 1288 ; the place of his birth is unknown . Charles Martel was the firstborn son of Charles II of Naples and Charles II 's wife , Mary , who was a daughter of Stephen V of Hungary . After the death of her brother , Ladislaus IV of Hungary , in 1290 , Queen Mary announced her claim to Hungary , stating that the House of Árpád ( the royal family of Hungary ) had become extinct with Ladislaus 's death . However , her father 's cousin , Andrew also laid claim to the throne , although his father , Stephen the Posthumous , had been regarded a bastard by all other members of the royal family . For all that , the Hungarian lords and prelates preferred Andrew against Mary and he was crowned king of Hungary on 23 July 1290 . She transferred her claim to Hungary to Charles Martel in January 1292 . The Babonići , Frankopans , Šubići and other Croatian and Slavonian noble families seemingly acknowledged Charles Martel 's claim , but in fact their loyalty vacillated between Charles Martel and Andrew III . 
 Charles Martel died in autumn 1295 , and his seven @-@ year @-@ old son , Charles , inherited his claim to Hungary . Charles would have also been the lawful heir to his grandfather , Charles II of Naples , in accordance with the principles of primogeniture . However , Charles II , who preferred his third son , Robert , to his grandson , bestowed the rights of a firstborn son upon Robert on 13 February 1296 . Pope Boniface VIII confirmed Charles II 's decision on 27 February 1296 , excluding the child Charles from succeeding his grandfather in the Kingdom of Naples . Dante Alighieri wrote of " the schemes and frauds that would attack " Charles Martel 's family in reference to Robert 's alleged manoeuvres to acquire the right to inherit Naples . The 14th @-@ century historian Giovanni Villani also noted that his contemporaries were of the opinion that Robert 's claim to Naples was weaker than his nephew 's . The jurist <unk> de <unk> refrained from setting out his position on the legitimacy of Robert 's rule . 
 = = = Struggle for Hungary ( 1300 – 1308 ) = = = 
 Andrew III of Hungary made his maternal uncle , Alberto Morosini , Duke of Slavonia , in July 1299 , stirring up the Slavonian and Croatian noblemen to revolt . A powerful Croatian baron , Paul Šubić , sent his brother , George , to Italy in early 1300 to convince Charles II of Naples to send his grandson to Hungary to claim the throne in person . The king of Naples accepted the proposal and borrowed 1 @,@ 300 ounces of gold from Florentine bankers to finance Charles 's journey . A Neapolitan knight of French origin , Philip Drugeth , accompanied the twelve @-@ year @-@ old Charles to Hungary . They landed at Split in Dalmatia in August 1300 . From Split , Paul Šubić escorted him to Zagreb where Ugrin Csák swore loyalty to Charles . Charles 's opponent , Andrew III of Hungary , died on 14 January 1301 . Charles hurried to Esztergom where the Archbishop @-@ elect , Gregory <unk> , crowned him with a provisional crown before 13 May . However , most Hungarians considered Charles 's coronation unlawful because customary law required that it should have been performed with the Holy Crown of Hungary in Székesfehérvár . 
 Charles counted his regnal years from this coronation , but Hungary had actually disintegrated into about a dozen independent provinces , each ruled by a powerful lord , or oligarch . Among them , Matthew Csák dominated the northwestern parts of Hungary ( which now form the eastern territories of present @-@ day Slovakia ) , Amadeus Aba controlled the northeastern lands , Ivan Kőszegi ruled Transdanubia , and Ladislaus Kán governed Transylvania . Most of those lords refused to accept Charles 's rule and proposed the crown to Wenceslaus II of Bohemia 's son and namesake , Wenceslaus , whose bride , Elisabeth , was Andrew III 's only daughter . Although Wenceslaus was crowned with the Holy Crown in Székesfehérvár , the legitimacy of his coronation was also questionable because John Hont @-@ Pázmány , Archbishop of Kalocsa , put the crown on Wenceslaus 's head , although customary law authorized the Archbishop of Esztergom to perform the ceremony . 
 After Wenceslaus 's coronation , Charles withdrew to Ugrin Csák 's domains in the southern regions of the kingdom . Pope Boniface sent his legate , Niccolo <unk> , to Hungary . <unk> convinced the majority of the Hungarian prelates to accept Charles 's reign . However , most Hungarian lords continued to oppose Charles because , according to the Illuminated Chronicle , they feared that " the free men of the kingdom should lose their freedom by accepting a king appointed by the Church " . Charles laid siege to Buda , the capital of the kingdom , in September 1302 , but Ivan Kőszegi relieved the siege . Charles 's charters show that he primarily stayed in the southern parts of the kingdom during the next years although he also visited Amadeus Aba in the fortress of <unk> . 
 Pope Boniface who regarded Hungary as a fief of the Holy See declared Charles the lawful king of Hungary on 31 May 1303 . He also threatened Wenceslaus with excommunication if he continued to style himself king of Hungary . Wenceslaus , left Hungary in summer 1304 , taking the Holy Crown with him . Charles met his cousin , Rudolph III of Austria , in Pressburg ( now Bratislava in Slovakia ) on 24 August . After signing an alliance , they jointly invaded Bohemia in the autumn . Wenceslaus who had succeeded his father in Bohemia renounced his claim to Hungary in favor of Otto III , Duke of Bavaria on 9 October 1305 . 
 Otto was crowned with the Holy Crown in Székesfehérvár on 6 December 1304 by Benedict <unk> , Bishop of Veszprém , and Anton , Bishop of Csanád . He was never able to strengthen his position in Hungary , because only the Kőszegis and the Transylvanian Saxons supported him . Charles seized Esztergom and many fortresses in the northern parts of Hungary ( now in Slovakia ) in 1306 . His partisans also occupied Buda in June 1307 . Ladislaus Kán , Voivode of Transylvania , seized and imprisoned Otto in Transylvania . An assembly of Charles 's partisans confirmed Charles 's claim to the throne on 10 October , but three powerful lords — Matthew Csák , Ladislaus Kán , and Ivan Kőszegi — were absent from the meeting . In 1308 , Ladislaus Kán released Otto , who then left Hungary . Otto never ceased styling himself King of Hungary , but he never returned to the country . 
 Pope Clement V sent a new papal legate , Gentile <unk> da Montefiore , to Hungary . Montefiore arrived in the summer of 1308 . In the next few months , he persuaded the most powerful lords one by one to accept Charles 's rule . At the Diet , which was held in the Dominican monastery in Pest , Charles was unanimously proclaimed king on 27 November 1308 . The delegates sent by Matthew Csák and Ladislaus Kán were also present at the assembly .

 The papal legate convoked the synod of the Hungarian prelates , who declared the monarch inviolable in December 1308 . They also urged Ladislaus Kán to hand over the Holy Crown to Charles . After Kán refused to do so , the legate consecrated a new crown for Charles . Thomas II , Archbishop of Esztergom crowned Charles king with the new crown in the Church of Our Lady in Buda on 15 or 16 June 1309 . However , most Hungarians regarded his second coronation invalid . The papal legate excommunicated Ladislaus Kán , who finally agreed to give the Holy Crown to Charles . On 27 August 1310 , Archbishop Thomas of Esztergom put the Holy Crown on Charles 's head in Székesfehérvár ; thus , Charles 's third coronation was performed in full accordance with customary law . However , his rule remained nominal in most parts of his kingdom . 
 Matthew Csák laid siege Buda in June 1311 , and Ladislaus Kán declined to assist the king . Charles sent an army to invade Matthew Csák 's domains in September , but it achieved nothing . In the same year , Ugrin Csák died , enabling Charles to take possession of the deceased lord 's domains , which were situated between Požega in Slavonia and Temesvár ( present @-@ day Timișoara in Romania ) . The burghers of Kassa ( now Košice in Slovakia ) assassinated Amadeus Aba in September 1311 . Charles 's envoys arbitrated an agreement between Aba 's sons and the town , which also prescribed that the Abas withdraw from two counties and allow the noblemen inhabiting their domains to freely join Charles . However , the Abas soon entered into an alliance with Matthew Csák against the king . The united forces of the Abas and Matthew Csák besieged Kassa , but Charles routed them in the Battle of <unk> ( now <unk> in Slovakia ) on 15 June 1312 . Almost half of the noblemen who had served Amadeus Aba fought on Charles 's side in the battle . In July , Charles captured the Abas ' many fortresses in <unk> , Torna and <unk> counties , including <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ( now <unk> in Ukraine ) . Thereafter he waged war against Matthew Csák , capturing Nagyszombat ( now Trnava in Slovakia ) in 1313 and Visegrád in 1315 , but was unable to win a decisive victory . 
 Charles transferred his residence from Buda to Temesvár in early 1315 . Ladislaus Kán died in 1315 , but his sons did not yield to Charles . Charles launched a campaign against the Kőszegis in Transdanubia and Slavonia in the first half of 1316 . Local noblemen joined the royal troops , which contributed to the quick collapse of the Kőszegis ' rule in southern parts of their domains . Meanwhile , James Borsa made an alliance against Charles with Ladislaus Kán 's sons and other lords . They offered the crown to Andrew of Galicia . Charles 's troops , which were under the command of a former supporter of the <unk> , Dózsa Debreceni , defeated the rebels ' united troops at Debrecen at the end of June . In the next two months , many fortresses of Borsa and his allies fell to the royal troops in Bihar , Szolnok , <unk> and Kolozs counties . No primary source has made reference to Charles 's bravery or heroic acts , suggesting that he rarely fought in person in the battles and sieges . However , he had excellent strategic skills : it was always Charles who appointed the fortresses to be besieged . 
 Stefan Dragutin , who controlled the Szerémség , Macsó and other regions along the southern borders of Hungary , died in 1316 . Charles confirmed the right of Stefan Dragutin 's son , Vladislav , to succeed his father and declared Vladislav the lawful ruler of Serbia against Stefan Uroš II Milutin . However , Stefan Uroš II captured Vladislav and invaded the Szerémség . Charles launched a counter @-@ campaign across the river <unk> and seized the fortress of Macsó . In May 1317 , Charles 's army suppressed the Abas ' revolt , seizing Ungvár and <unk> Castle ( present @-@ day Uzhhorod and <unk> Castle in Ukraine ) from them . After that , Charles invaded Matthew Csák 's domains and captured <unk> ( now <unk> in Slovakia ) on 3 November 1317 . After his uncle , King Robert of Naples , granted the Principality of Salerno and the domain of Monte Sant 'Angelo to his brother ( Charles 's younger uncle ) , John , Charles protested and laid claim to those domains , previously held by his father . 
 After Charles neglected to reclaim Church property that Matthew Csák had seized by force , the prelates of the realm made an alliance in early 1318 against all who would jeopardize their interests . Upon their demand , Charles held a Diet in summer , but refused to confirm the Golden Bull of 1222 . Before the end of the year , the prelates made a complaint against Charles because he had taken possession of Church property . In 1319 , Charles fell so seriously ill that the pope authorized Charles 's confessor to absolve him from his all sins before he died , but Charles recovered . In the same year , Dózsa Debreceni , whom Charles had made voivode of Transylvania , launched successful expeditions against Ladislaus Kán 's sons and their allies , and Charles 's Judge royal , Alexander <unk> , seized the Kőszegis ' six fortresses . In summer , Charles launched an expedition against Stefan Uroš II Milutin , during which he retook Belgrade and restored tha Banate of Macsó . The last Diet during Charles 's reign was held in 1320 ; following that , he failed to convoke the yearly public judicial sessions , contravening the provisions of the Golden Bull . 
 Matthew Csák died on 21 March 1321 . The royal army invaded the deceased lord 's province , which soon disintegrated because most of his former castellans yielded without resistance . Charles personally led the siege of Csák 's former seat , Trencsén ( now Trenčín in Slovakia ) , which fell on 8 August . About three months later , Charles 's new voivode of Transylvania , Thomas Szécsényi , seized <unk> ( present @-@ day Ciceu @-@ <unk> in Romania ) , the last fortress of Ladislaus Kán 's sons . 
 In January 1322 , two Dalmatian towns , Šibenik and Trogir , rebelled against Mladen II Šubić , who was a son of Charles 's one @-@ time leading partisan , Paul Šubić . The two towns also accepted the suzerainty of the Republic of Venice although Charles had urged Venice not to intervene in the conflict between his subjects . Many Croatian lords ( including his own brother , Paul II Šubić ) also turned against Mladen , and their coalition defeated him at Klis . In September , Charles marched to Croatia where all the Croatian lords who were opposed to Mladen Šubić yielded to him in Knin . Mladen Šubić also visited Charles , but the king had the powerful lord imprisoned . 
 = = = Consolidation and reforms ( 1323 – 1330 ) = = = 
 As one of his charters concluded , Charles had taken " full possession " of his kingdom by 1323 . In the first half of the year , he moved his capital from Temesvár to Visegrád in the centre of his kingdom . In the same year , the Dukes of Austria renounced Pressburg ( now Bratislava in Slovakia ) , which they had controlled for decades , in exchange for the support they had received from Charles against Louis IV , Holy Roman Emperor , in 1322 . 
 Royal power was only nominally restored in the lands between the Carpathian Mountains and the Lower Danube , which had been united under a voivode , known as Basarab , by the early 1320s . Although Basarab was willing to accept Charles 's suzerainty in a peace treaty signed in 1324 , he refrained from renouncing control of the lands he had occupied in the Banate of Severin . Charles also attempted to reinstate royal authority in Croatia and Slavonia . He dismissed the Ban of Slavonia , John <unk> , replacing him with Mikcs Ákos in 1325 . Ban Mikcs invaded Croatia to subjugate the local lords who had seized the former castles of Mladen <unk> without the king 's approval , but one of the Croatian lords , Ivan I <unk> , routed the ban 's troops in 1326 . Consequently , royal power remained only nominal in Croatia during Charles 's reign . The Babonići and the Kőszegis rose up in open rebellion in 1327 , but Ban Mikcs and Alexander <unk> defeated them . In retaliation , at least eight fortresses of the rebellious lords were confiscated in Slavonia and Transdanubia . 
 Through his victory over the oligarchs , Charles acquired about 60 % of the Hungarian castles , along with the estates belonging to them . In 1323 , he set about revising his previous land grants , which enabled him to reclaim former royal estates . During his reign , special commissions were set up to detect royal estates that had been unlawfully acquired by their owners . Charles refrained from making perpetual grants to his partisans . Instead , he applied a system of " office fiefs " ( or honors ) , whereby his officials were entitled to enjoy all revenues accrued from their offices , but only for the time they held those offices . That system assured the preponderance of royal power , enabling Charles to rule " with the plenitude of power " , as he emphasized in one of his charters of 1335 . He even ignored customary law : for instance , " promoting a daughter to a son " , which entitled her to inherit her father 's estates instead of her male cousins . Charles also took control of the administration of the Church in Hungary . He appointed the Hungarian prelates at will , without allowing the cathedral chapters to elect them . 
 He promoted the spread of chivalrous culture in his realms . He regularly held tournaments and introduced the new ranks of " page of the royal court " and " knight of the royal court " . Charles was the first monarch to create a secular order of knighthood by establishing the Order of Saint George in 1326 . He was the first Hungarian king to grant helmet crests to his faithful followers to distinguish them from others " by means of an <unk> of their own " , as he emphasized in one of his charters . 
 Charles reorganized and improved the administration of royal revenues . During his reign , five new " chambers " ( administrative bodies headed by German , Italian or Hungarian merchants ) were established for the control and collection of royal revenues from coinage , monopolies and custom duties . In 1327 , he partially abolished the royal monopoly of gold mining , giving one third of the royal revenues from the gold extracted from a newly opened mine to the owner of the land where that mine was discovered . In the next few years , new gold mines were opened at <unk> ( now <unk> in Slovakia ) , Nagybánya ( present @-@ day Baia Mare in Romania ) and <unk> ( now Baia de <unk> in Romania ) . Hungarian mines yielded about 1 @,@ 400 kilograms ( 3 @,@ 100 lb ) of gold around 1330 , which made up more than 30 % of the world 's total production . The minting of gold coins began under Charles 's auspices in the lands north of the Alps in Europe . His florins , which were modelled on the gold coins of Florence , were first issued in 1326 . 
 Internal peace and increasing royal revenues strengthened the international position of Hungary in the 1320s . On 13 February 1327 , Charles and John of Bohemia signed an alliance in Nagyszombat ( present @-@ day Trnava in Slovakia ) against the Habsburgs , who had occupied Pressburg . In the summer of 1328 Hungarian and Bohemian troops invaded Austria and routed the Austrian army on the banks of the Leitha River . On 21 September 1328 , Charles signed a peace treaty with the three dukes of Austria ( Frederick the Fair , Albert the Lame , and Otto the Merry ) , who renounced Pressburg and the <unk> ( now Međimurje in Croatia ) . The following year , Serbian troops laid siege to Belgrade , but Charles relieved the fortress . 
 Alliance with his father @-@ in @-@ law , Władysław I the Elbow @-@ high , King of Poland , became a permanent element of Charles 's foreign policy in the 1320s . After being defeated by the united forces of the Teutonic Knights and John of Bohemia , Władysław I sent his son and heir , Casimir , to Visegrád in late 1329 to seek assistance from Charles . During his stay in Charles 's court , the nineteen @-@ year @-@ old Casimir seduced Claire Záh , who was a lady @-@ in @-@ waiting of Charles 's wife , Elisabeth of Poland , according to an Italian writer . On 17 April 1330 , the young lady 's father , Felician Záh , stormed into the dining room of the royal palace at Visegrád with a sword in his hand and attacked the royal family . Záh wounded both Charles and the queen on their right hand and attempted to kill their two sons , Louis and Andrew , before the royal guards killed him . Charles 's revenge was brutal : with the exception of Claire , Felician Záh 's children were tortured to death ; Claire 's lips and all eight fingers were cut before she was dragged by a horse through the streets of many towns ; all of Felician 's other relatives within the third degree of kinship ( including his sons @-@ in @-@ law and sisters ) were executed , and those within the seventh degree were condemned to perpetual serfdom . 
 = = = Active foreign policy ( 1330 – 1339 ) = = = 
 In September 1330 , Charles launched a military expedition against Basarab of Wallachia who had attempted to get rid of his suzerainty . After seizing the fortress of Severin ( present @-@ day Drobeta @-@ Turnu Severin in Romania ) , he refused to make peace with Basarab and marched towards Curtea de Argeș , which was Basarab 's seat . The Wallachians applied scorched earth tactics , compelling Charles to make a truce with Basarab and withdraw his troops from Wallachia . While the royal troops were marching through a narrow pass across the Southern Carpathians on 9 November , the Wallachians ambushed them . During the next four days , the royal army was decimated ; Charles could only escape from the battlefield after changing his clothes with one of his knights , Desiderius <unk> , who sacrificed his life to enable the king 's escape . Charles did not attempt a new invasion of Wallachia , which subsequently developed into an independent principality . 
 In September 1331 , Charles made an alliance with Otto the Merry , Duke of Austria , against Bohemia . He also sent reinforcements to Poland to fight against the Teutonic Knights and the Bohemians . In 1332 he signed a peace treaty with John of Bohemia and mediated a truce between Bohemia and Poland . In 1332 Charles allowed the collection of the papal tithe ( the tenth part of the Church revenues ) in his realms only after the Holy See agreed to give one third of the money collected to him . After years of negotiations , Charles visited his uncle , Robert , in Naples in July 1333 . Two months later , Charles 's son , Andrew , was betrothed to Robert 's granddaughter , Joanna , who had been made her grandfather 's heir . Charles returned to Hungary in early 1334 . In retaliation for a previous Serbian raid , he invaded Serbia and captured the fortress of <unk> ( now Golubac in Serbia ) . 
 In summer 1335 , the delegates of John of Bohemia and the new King of Poland , Casimir III , entered into negotiations in Trencsén to put an end to the conflicts between the two countries . With Charles 's mediation , a compromise was reached on 24 August : John of Bohemia renounced his claim to Poland and Casimir of Poland acknowledged John of Bohemia 's suzerainty in Silesia . On 3 September , Charles signed an alliance with John of Bohemia in Visegrád , which was primarily formed against the Dukes of Austria . Upon Charles 's invitation , John of Bohemia and Casimir of Poland met in Visegrád in November . During the Congress of Visegrád , the two rulers confirmed the compromise that their delegates had worked out in Trencsén . Casimir III also promised to pay 400 @,@ 000 groschen to John of Bohemia , but a part of this indemnification ( 120 @,@ 000 groschen ) was finally paid off by Charles instead of his brother @-@ in @-@ law . The three rulers agreed upon a mutual defence union against the Habsburgs , and a new commercial route was set up to enable merchants travelling between Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire to bypass Vienna . 
 The Babonići and the Kőszegis made an alliance with the Dukes of Austria in January 1336 . John of Bohemia , who claimed Carinthia from the Habsburgs , invaded Austria in February . Casimir III of Poland came to Austria to assist him in late June . Charles soon joined them at <unk> . The dukes sought reconciliation and signed a peace treaty with John of Bohemia in July . Charles signed a truce with them on 13 December , and launched a new expedition against Austria early the next year . He forced the Babonići and the Kőszegis to yield , and the latter were also compelled to hand over to him their fortresses along the frontier in exchange for faraway castles . Charles 's peace treaty with Albert and Otto of Austria , which was signed on 11 September 1337 , forbade both the dukes and Charles to give shelter to the other party 's rebellious subjects . 
 Charles continued the reform of coinage in the late 1330s . In 1336 , he abolished the compulsory exchange of old coins for newly issued coins for villagers , but introduced a new tax , the chamber 's profit , to compensate the loss of royal revenues . Two years later , Charles ordered the minting of a new silver penny and prohibited payments made in foreign coins or silver bars . 
 John of Bohemia 's heir , Charles , Margrave of Moravia , visited Charles in Visegrád in early 1338 . The margrave acknowledged the right of Charles 's son , Louis , to inherit Poland if Casimir III died without a son in exchange for Charles 's promise to persuade Casimir III not to invade Silesia . Two leading Polish lords , Zbigniew , chancellor of Cracow , and <unk> <unk> , also supported this plan and persuaded Casimir III , who lost his first wife on 26 May 1339 , to start negotiations with Charles . In July , Casimir came to Hungary and designated his sister ( Charles 's wife ) , Elizabeth , and her sons as his heirs . On his sons ' behalf , Charles promised that they would make every effort to reconquer all lands that Poland had lost and that they would refrain from employing foreigners in Poland . 
 = = = Last years ( 1339 – 1342 ) = = = 
 Charles obliged the Kőszegis to renounce their last fortresses along the western borders of the kingdom in 1339 or 1340 . He divided the large Zólyom County ( now in Slovakia ) , which had been dominated by a powerful local lord , <unk> , into three smaller counties in 1340 . The following year , Charles also forced <unk> to renounce his two fortresses in Zólyom in exchange for one castle in the distant <unk> County ( in present @-@ day Romania ) . Around the same time , Stephen Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia , invaded Sirmium and captured Belgrade . 
 Charles was ailing during the last years of his life . He died in Visegrád on 16 July 1342 . His corpse was first delivered to Buda where a Mass was said for his soul . From Buda , his corpse was taken to Székesfehérvár . He was buried in the Székesfehérvár Basilica a month after his death . His brother @-@ in @-@ law , Casimir III of Poland , and Charles , Margrave of Moravia , were present at his funeral , an indication of Charles 's international prestige .

 The <unk> <unk> Europae orientalis ( " An Anonymous ' Description of Eastern Europe " ) wrote , in the first half of 1308 , that " the daughter of the strapping Duke of Ruthenia , Leo , has recently married Charles , King of Hungary " . Charles also stated in a charter of 1326 that he once travelled to " Ruthenia " ( or Halych @-@ Lodomeria ) in order to bring his first wife back to Hungary . A charter issued on 23 June 1326 referred to Charles 's wife , Queen Mary . Historian Gyula Kristó says , the three documents show that Charles married a daughter of Leo II of Galicia in late 1305 or early 1306 . Historian <unk> <unk> accepts Kristó 's interpretation , but she writes that Mary of Galicia most probably died before the marriage . The Polish scholar , Stanisław Sroka , rejects Kristó 's interpretation , stating that Leo I — who was born in 1292 , according to him — could hardly have fathered Charles 's first wife . In accordance with previous academic consensus , Sroka says that Charles 's first wife was Mary of Bytom from the Silesian branch of the Piast dynasty . 
 The Illuminated Chronicle stated that Charles 's " first consort , Maria ... was of the Polish nation " and she was " the daughter of Duke Casimir " . Sroka proposes that Mary of Bytom married Charles in 1306 , but Kristó writes that their marriage probably took place in the first half of 1311 . The Illuminated Chronicle recorded that she died on 15 December 1317 , but a royal charter issued on 12 July 1318 stated that her husband made a land grant with her consent . Charles 's next — second or third — wife was Beatrice of Luxembourg , who was a daughter of Henry VII , Holy Roman Emperor , and the sister of John , King of Bohemia . Their marriage took place before the end of February 1319 . She died in childbirth in early November in the same year . Charles 's last wife , Elisabeth , daughter of Władysław I , King of Poland , was born around 1306 . Their marriage took place on 6 July 1320 . 
 Most 14th @-@ century Hungarian chroniclers write that Charles and Elisabeth of Poland had five sons . Their first son , Charles , was born in 1321 and died in the same year according to the Illuminated Chronicle . However , a charter of June 1323 states that the child had died in this month . The second son of Charles and Elisabeth , Ladislaus , was born in 1324 . The marriage of Ladislaus and Anne , a daughter of King John of Bohemia , was planned by their parents , but Ladislaus died in 1329 . Charles 's and Elisabeth 's third son , Louis , who was born in 1326 , survived his father and succeeded him as King of Hungary . His younger brothers , Andrew and Stephen , who were born in 1327 and 1332 , respectively , also survived Charles . 
 Although no contemporaneous or nearly contemporaneous sources made mention of any further children , Charles may have fathered two daughters , according to historians Zsuzsa Teke and Gyula Kristó . Zsuzsa Teke writes that they were born to Mary of Bytom , but the nearly contemporaneous Peter of Zittau wrote that she had died childless . Gyula Kristó proposes that a miniature in the Illuminated Chronicle , which depicts Elisabeth of Poland and five children , implies that she gave birth to Charles 's two daughters , because Kristó identifies two of the three children standing on her right as daughters . The elder of Charles 's two possible daughters , Catherine , who was born in the early 1320s , was the wife of Henry II , Duke of Świdnica . Their only daughter , Anne , grew up in the Hungarian royal court after her parents ' death , implying that Charles and Elisabeth of Poland were her grandparents . Historian Kazimierz Jasiński says that Elisabeth , the wife of Boleslaus II of Troppau , was also Charles 's daughter . If she was actually Charles 's daughter , she must have been born in about 1330 , according to Kristó . 
 Charles also fathered an illegitimate son , Coloman , who was born in early 1317 . His mother was a daughter of <unk> Csák . Coloman was elected Bishop of Győr in 1336 .

 Charles often declared that his principal aim was the " restoration of the ancient good conditions " of the kingdom . On his coat @-@ of @-@ arms , he united the " Árpád stripes " with the motives of the coat @-@ of @-@ arms of his paternal family , which emphasized his kinship with the first royal house of Hungary . During his reign , Charles reunited Hungary and introduced administrative and fiscal reforms . He bequeathed to his son , Louis the Great , a " bulging exchequer and an effective system of taxation " , according to scholar Bryan Cartledge . Nevertheless , Louis the Great 's achievements overshadowed Charles 's reputation . 
 The only contemporaneous record of Charles 's deeds were made by a Franciscan friar who was hostile towards the monarch . Instead of emphasizing Charles 's achievements in the reunification of the country , the friar described in detail the negative episodes of Charles 's reign . In particular , the unusual cruelty that the king showed after Felician Záh 's assassination attempt on the royal family contributed to the negative picture of Charles 's personality . The Franciscan friar attributed Charles 's defeat by Basarab of Wallachia as a punishment from God for the king 's revenge . 
 = Osorkon IV = 
 Usermaatre Osorkon IV was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh during the late Third Intermediate Period . Traditionally considered the very last king of the 22nd Dynasty , he was de facto little more than ruler in Tanis and Bubastis , in Lower Egypt . He is generally – though not universally – identified with the King Shilkanni mentioned by Assyrian sources , and with the biblical So , King of Egypt from the Books of Kings . 
 Osorkon ruled during one of the most chaotic and politically fragmented periods of ancient Egypt , in which the Nile Delta was dotted with small Libyan kingdoms and principalities and <unk> dominions ; as the last heir of the <unk> rulers , he inherited the easternmost parts of these kingdoms , the most involved in all the political and military upheavals that soon would afflict the Near East . During his reign , he had to face the power , and ultimately submit himself — to the Kushite King Piye during Piye 's conquest of Egypt . Osorkon IV also had to deal with the threatening Neo @-@ Assyrian Empire outside his eastern borders . 
 = = Reign = = 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 Osorkon IV ascended to the throne of Tanis in c . 730 BC , at the end of the long reign of his predecessor Shoshenq V of the 22nd Dynasty , who was possibly also his father . However , this somewhat traditional collocation was first challenged in 1970 by Karl @-@ Heinz <unk> who preferred to place Osorkon IV in a lower – Egyptian branch of the 23rd Dynasty , right after the reign of the shadowy pharaoh <unk> II ; this placement found the support of a certain number of scholars . Osorkon 's mother , named on a electrum aegis of Sekhmet now in the Louvre , was <unk> III . Osorkon IV 's realm was restricted only to the district of Tanis ( Rˁ @-@ <unk> ) and the territory of Bubastis , both in the eastern Nile Delta . His neighbors were Libyan princes and <unk> chiefs who ruled their small realms outside of his authority . 
 Around 729 / 28 BC , soon after his accession , Osorkon IV faced the crusade led by the Kushite pharaoh Piye of the Nubian 25th Dynasty . Along with other rulers of Lower and Middle Egypt – mainly <unk> of <unk> , <unk> II of Leontopolis and <unk> of Herakleopolis – Osorkon IV joined the coalition led by the Chief of the West <unk> in order to oppose the Nubian . However , Piye 's advance was unstoppable and the opposing rulers surrendered one after another : Osorkon IV found it wise to reach the Temple of Ra at Heliopolis and pay homage to his new overlord Piye personally — an action which was soon imitated by the other rulers . As reported on his Victory Stela , Piye accepted their submission , but Osorkon and most of the rulers were not allowed to enter the royal enclosure because they were not circumcised and had eaten fish , both abominations in the eyes of the Nubian . Nevertheless , Osorkon IV and the others were allowed to keep their former domains and authority . 
 = = = The Assyrian threat = = = 
 In 726 / 25 BC <unk> , the last King of Israel , rebelled against the Assyrian King Shalmaneser V who demanded an annual tribute , and sought the support of So , King of Egypt ( 2 Kings 17 : 4 ) who , as already mentioned , was most likely Osorkon IV ( see below ) . For reasons which remained unknown – possibly in order to remain neutral towards the powerful Neo @-@ Assyrian Empire , or simply because he didn 't have enough power or resources – King So didn 't help <unk> , who was subsequently defeated and deposed by Shalmaneser V. The Kingdom of Israel ceased to exist , and many Israelites were brought to Assyria as exiles . 
 In 720 BC , a revolt occurred in Palestine against the new Assyrian King Sargon II , led by King Hanno ( also Hanun and <unk> ) of Gaza who sought the help of " <unk> of Musri " , a term most probably meaning " Pharaoh of Egypt " and referring to Osorkon IV . Assyrian sources claim that this time the Egyptian king did send a turtanu ( an army – commander ) called Reʾe or <unk> ( his Egyptian name was Raia , though in the past it was read <unk> ) as well as troops in order to support his neighboring ally . However , the coalition was defeated in battle at Raphia . Reʾe fled back to Egypt , Raphia and Gaza were looted and Hanno was burnt alive by the Assyrians . A different opinion came from Israeli scholar Dan 'el Kahn who proposed an earlier <unk> for the accession of Piye 's successor Shabaka : in his point of view , Shabaka was already ruling over the whole of Egypt before 720 BC , and Reʾe was in fact a Nubian turtanu serving him rather than an Egyptian one serving Osorkon IV . 
 In 716 BC , Sargon II almost reached Egypt 's boundaries . Feeling directly threatened this time , Osorkon IV ( here called Shilkanni by Assyrian sources , see below ) was carefully diplomatic : he personally met the Assyrian king at the " Brook of Egypt " ( most likely el @-@ Arish ) and <unk> him with a present which Sargon personally described as " twelve large horses of Egypt without equals in Assyria " . The Assyrian king appreciated his gifts and did not take action against Osorkon IV . 
 = = = End = = = 
 Shortly after , Osorkon IV and his dynasty vanished into obscurity . His death should have occurred between 715 and 713 BC , after 16 / 18 years of reign , as he was apparently gone when King <unk> of Ashdod sought refuge from Sargon II in Egypt around 712 BC or possibly later , only to be caught by a pharaoh of the 25th Dynasty who returned him to the Assyrians in chains . Kahn believed that this pharaoh was Shabaka , who might have previously deposed Osorkon IV , " guilty " for being too philo @-@ Assyrian . A few decades later a man called <unk> , possibly a descendant of the now @-@ defunct dynasty , claimed for himself the pharaonic royal titles and ruled in Tanis as its prince . 
 = = Identification with Shilkanni and So = = 
 It is believed that Shilkanni is a rendering of ( U ) <unk> , which in turn is derived from ( O ) <unk> – hence Osorkon IV – as first proposed by William F. Albright in 1956 . This identification is accepted by several scholars while others remain uncertain or even skeptical . Shilkanni is reported by Assyrians as " King of Musri " : this location , once believed to be a country in northern Arabia by the orientalist Hans Alexander Winckler , is certainly to be identified with Egypt instead . In the same way , the " Pir 'u of Musri " to whom Hanno of Gaza asked for help in 720 BC could only have been Osorkon IV . The identity of the biblical King So is somewhat less definite . Generally , an abbreviation of ( O ) so ( <unk> ) is again considered the most likely by several scholars , but the concurrent hypothesis which equates So with the city of Sais , hence with King <unk> , is supported by a certain number of scholars . 
 = = Attestations = = 
 Osorkon IV is attested by Assyrian documents ( as Shilkanni and other epithets ) and probably also by the Books of Kings ( as King So ) , while Manetho 's <unk> seem to have ignored him . He is undoubtedly attested by the well @-@ known Victory Stela of Piye on which he is depicted while prostrating in front of the owner of the stela along with other submitted rulers . Another finding almost certainly referring to him is the aforementioned aegis of Sekhmet , found at Bubastis and mentioning a King Osorkon son of queen <unk> who – as the name does not coincide with those of any of the other Osorkon kings ' mothers – can only be Osorkon IV 's mother . 
 = = = About the throne name = = = 
 Osorkon 's throne name was thought to be Aakheperre <unk> from a few monuments naming a namesake pharaoh Osorkon , such as a faience seal and a relief – block , both in the Rijksmuseum van <unk> in Leiden , but this attribution was questioned by Frederic <unk> in 2000 . According to him , these findings could rather be assigned to an earlier Aakheperre Osorkon – i.e. , the distant predecessor Osorkon the Elder of the 21st Dynasty – thus implying that Osorkon IV 's real throne name was unknown . Furthermore , in 2010 / 11 a French expedition discovered in the Temple of Mut at Tanis two blocks bearing a relief of a King <unk> ( t ) re <unk> , depicted in a quite archaizing style , which at first were attributed to Osorkon III . In 2014 , on the basis of the style of both the relief and the royal name , Aidan Dodson rejected the identification of this king with both the already @-@ known kings Usermaatre Osorkon ( Osorkon II and III ) and stated that he was rather Osorkon IV with his true throne name . A long @-@ known , archaizing " glassy faience " statuette fragment from Memphis now exhibited at the Petrie Museum ( <unk> ) which is inscribed for one King Usermaatre , had been tentatively attributed to several pharaohs from Piye to <unk> of the Theban 23rd Dynasty and even to <unk> of the 28th Dynasty , but may in fact represent Osorkon IV .

Elisa tells Jack that " Señor Macho Solo " is " what we call a <unk> sandwich " , a sandwich sold at McDonald 's . NBC page Kenneth Parcell ( Jack McBrayer ) does the " Top That " rap from the fantasy @-@ comedy film Teen Witch ( 1989 ) . Jenna sings the song " Piece of My Heart " , from Janis Joplin , though , the lyrics had been reworded by Jack so that Sheinhardt Universal avoid legal problems .

 = Ee Hoe Hean Club = 
 The Ee Hoe Hean Club ( simplified Chinese : <unk> ; traditional Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> <unk> ) , founded in 1895 and located at Bukit Pasoh Road in Chinatown , was a millionaires ' club in Singapore . Besides functioning as a social and business club , members of the club were actively involved in the political development of China in the early 20th century . The club supported the 1911 Xinhai Revolution which overthrew the Qing Dynasty , and later the establishment of the Republic of China . During World War II , it was the headquarters of the anti @-@ Japanese China Salvation Movement in Southeast Asia from 1937 — 1942 . On 18 October 1995 , the club was gazetted as a Heritage Site by the National Heritage Board of Singapore . 
 = = History = = 
 Co @-@ founded in 1895 by Lim Nee Soon , Gan Eng Seng and Lim Boon Keng , the three @-@ storey high Ee Hoe Hean Club was originally located on <unk> Hill but moved to Bukit Pasoh Road in 1925 . The club was a social @-@ cum @-@ business club where like @-@ minded Chinese businessmen could mingle and exchange ideas . Members such as Teo Eng Hock , Tan Chor Nam and Lim Nee Soon were actively involved in the Xinhai Revolution and later the establishment of the Republic of China . Among the more famous visitors to its clubhouse included Sun Yat @-@ sen and Jawaharlal Nehru . In 1923 , when Chinese businessman , community leader and philanthropist Tan Kah Kee , known as the Rubber King of Singapore and Malaya , assumed chairmanship of the club , its focus shifted from being a purely social and business club to one that was politically active . 
 = = = Tan Kah Kee = = = 
 Born in 1874 in Fujian , China , Tan came to Singapore at the age of 16 to join his father 's business . In 1904 , Tan struck out on his own , selling pineapples and rice and manufacturing rubber tyres and shoes . Tan 's rubber business flourished and , with growing wealth , he altruistically donated money to many schools and established Amoy University ( now Xiamen University ) . However , Tan 's loyalty still lay with his motherland and he ardently supported opponents of the Qing rulers during the Xinhai Revolution . By this time , Tan 's philanthropic work and political inclinations had made him a popular figure amongst the Chinese in Singapore and China . 
 Tan brought to the club his political awareness of Chinese matters . In 1928 , following a public outrage over a massacre at Jinan ( known as the Jinan Incident ) in Shandong in which more than 5 @,@ 000 Chinese soldiers and civilians were slaughtered by the Japanese , the club set up the Shandong Relief Fund . Its purpose was to raise funds for China , to create awareness amongst the Chinese about the Japanese invasion of China , and to encourage the Chinese to boycott Japanese goods and services . The Chinese community contributed a total of S $ 1 @.@ 34 million within a year of its inception . 
 Seeing that the Chinese military was weaker than the superior Japanese forces , Tan stepped up his anti @-@ Japanese campaign . In 1936 , he raised enough money for the Chinese Air Force to purchase 13 fighter planes . In 1937 , the Chinese Relief Fund Committee was set up with Tan chosen by over 800 representatives of the Chinese community as its chairman . In response to the Japanese invasion of China in 1937 , the China Salvation Movement was born , with its Southeast Asian headquarters located at the club until 1942 , when the Japanese invaded Singapore . Tan fled to Indonesia just a few days before the fall of Singapore as he knew he would likely face persecution by the Japanese should he choose to remain . He returned to Singapore after the war and continued to play an active role in community services and charity work before returning to China in 1950 . He died at the age of 87 in Beijing on 12 August 1961 and was accorded a national funeral by the People 's Republic of China government for his various contributions to society . 
 = = = Recruitment of drivers and mechanics = = = 
 During the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War , many Chinese seaports were either captured or blockaded by the Japanese , in an attempt to prevent supplies from entering China . As a result , an alternative overland road named Burma Road , became China 's most important supply route . Completed in 1938 , supplies were sent by sea to the port in Rangoon , Burma , transported overland by rail to Lashio and through the Burma Road to Kunming in China . Due to lack of experienced drivers and mechanics in China , the Chinese government requested Tan Kah Kee , the Chairman of the China Relief Fund , to recruit volunteers from Nanyang ( a term used by the Chinese when referring to Southeast Asia ) . Following the request , the China Relief Fund published the first recruitment notice on 7 February 1939 . 
 As the road condition required extremely good driving skills , the China Relief Fund decided to test drivers and established a driving institute on a vacant piece of accessible land behind the Siong Lim Temple . Venerable Pu Liang , the monastery 's 10th abbot , supported the China Relief Fund . Qualified volunteers from Nanyang converged in Singapore to form a batch . In 1939 , about 3 @,@ 200 volunteers left in nine batches that included only Chinese men but also Indians , Malays , and four Chinese women . About 1 @,@ 000 of them died in service , 1 @,@ 000 settled in China and others returned to Nanyang after the war . The Venerable and two of his disciples were later arrested and executed during the Sook Ching Massacre in 1942 .

 Located just a stone 's throw away lies another historic site , the Chin Kang Huay Kuan , a Chinese clan association that was established in 1918 by Chinese immigrants from Jinjiang County in southern Fujian , China . The present building on Bukit Pasoh Road was built in 1928 and its wartime history was intricately linked to Ee Hoe Hean Club . During the Japanese invasion of Singapore , the clan association 's premises served as an extension of the club 's anti @-@ Japanese activities and were used by the Overseas Chinese General Mobilisation Council . Headed by Tan Kah Kee , the council was instrumental in helping the British to maintain law and order and in supplying labourers and volunteers for the defence of Singapore . As a result , it became the recruiting centre and headquarters of the Singapore Overseas Chinese Volunteer Army or Dalforce after its British chief commander , Colonel John Dalley . A surviving volunteer named Hu <unk> recounted his experience : 
 I came across an article in the papers in which Mr Tan Kah Kee called for a convention of overseas Chinese on behalf of the Governor of Singapore . The purpose of the convention was to set up a Singapore Overseas Chinese Mobilisation Association composed of a defence squad , local militia and labour team . The same day after reading it , I set off to Singapore . On 2 February 1942 , I led some members of the local militia to the Volunteer Army headquarters . During this time , many patriotic young men who were untrained in military skills , streamed into Singapore . 
 Although ill @-@ equipped and having received little training , Dalforce was sent to the northwestern front where they fought against Japanese landing parties during the battles of Sarimbun Beach and Kranji . Despite their efforts , Singapore fell to the Japanese a few days after the invasion , and the Japanese army moved in to occupy the Chin Kang Huay Kuan . After the Japanese surrender on September 1945 , Chin Kang Huay Kuan resumed its normal activities of running welfare programmes for needy clan members and organising cultural events .

 After the Japanese occupation of Singapore , the club 's anti @-@ Japanese agenda became redundant and it reverted being a club for social and business interaction once again . Its members were later active in the struggle for citizenship , voters ' registration campaign and other philanthropic activities . After Singapore 's independence in 1965 , it became a focal point where local Chinese businessmen socialised and forged ties , and it continued to play an active role in community services such as charity work and giving public talks . Among its 200 @-@ odd members today are luminaries of the Chinese business community such as the founder of the Overseas Union Bank , Lien Ying Chow , and United Overseas Bank chairman Wee Cho Yaw . It is still an all men 's club – the youngest members are mainly in their 50s and membership is by invitation only .

 = Blue duiker = 
 The blue duiker ( Philantomba monticola ) is a small antelope found in western , southern and eastern Africa . It is the smallest duiker . The species was first described by Swedish naturalist Carl Peter Thunberg in 1789 . 12 subspecies are identified . The blue duiker reaches 32 – 41 centimetres ( 13 – 16 in ) at the shoulder and weighs 3 @.@ 5 – 9 kilograms ( 7 @.@ 7 – 19 @.@ 8 lb ) . Sexually dimorphic , the females are slightly larger than the males . The dark tail measures slightly above 10 centimetres ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) . It has short , spiky horns , around 5 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) long and hidden in hair tufts . The subspecies show a great degree of variation in their colouration . The blue duiker bears a significant resemblance to Maxwell 's duiker . 
 Activity is diurnal ( limited to daytime ) . Secretive and cautious , the blue duiker confines itself to the forest fringes . Territorial , individuals of opposite sexes form pairs and occupy territories , nearly 0 @.@ 4 – 0 @.@ 8 hectares ( 0 @.@ 0015 – 0 @.@ 0031 sq mi ) large and marked by preorbital gland secretions . The blue duiker feeds on fallen fruits , foliage , flowers and pieces of bark , provided mainly by the forest canopies in their habitat . The age when sexual maturity is gained has been given differently by different studies . The species is monogamous , with pairs remaining together throughout the year . The length of the gestational period has been estimated from as little as four months to as long as seven months . Births occur throughout the year , though the birth rate might fall in the dry season . The calf is mainly kept in hiding and weaning occurs at 2 @.@ 5 to 3 months . 
 The habitat consists of a variety of forests , including old @-@ growth , secondary , and gallery forests . Forests are preferred as these provide the animal with shelter through the dense understory and forage through canopy . Though categorised as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources ( IUCN ) , the blue duiker is under threat from extensive bushmeat hunting across its range .

 The scientific name of the blue duiker is Philantomba monticola . It is placed in the genus Philantomba , along with Maxwell 's duiker ( P. <unk> ) and Walter 's duiker ( P. walteri ) , and the family Bovidae . The species was first described by Swedish naturalist Carl Peter Thunberg in 1789 . It is sometimes treated as a species of Cephalophus , another genus of duikers , although Philantomba has been recognised as a genus by zoologists such as Peter Grubb and Colin Groves . Owing to the remarkable similarities between the two species , some zoologists such as Theodor Haltenorth consider Maxwell 's duiker as a race of the blue duiker . 
 While the generic name Philantomba has no clear origin , the specific name monticola has been derived from the Latin words <unk> ( mountain ) and <unk> ( meaning " I cultivate " or " I inhabit " ) , in reference to its montane habitat . The common name " blue " refers to one of its typical coat colours . The common name of duiker comes from the Afrikaans <unk> or Dutch <unk> – both mean " diver " , which refers to the practice of the animals to frequently dive into vegetation for cover . 
 In 2012 , Anne R. Johnston ( of the University of Orleans ) and colleagues constructed a cladogram of the subfamily Cephalophinae ( duiker ) , that includes the three genera Cephalophus , Philantomba and Sylvicapra , based on mitochondrial analysis . Philantomba was shown to be monophyletic . It is sister to the rest of the subfamily , from which it diverged nearly 8 @.@ 73 million years ago ( in the late Miocene ) . The blue duiker split from Maxwell 's duiker 2 @.@ 68 to 5 @.@ 31 million years ago . This cladogram , however , did not include the newly discovered Walter 's duiker . Marc <unk> ( of the University of Rennes 1 ) and colleagues , who had discovered this species in 2010 , had prepared a similar cladogram ( below ) that included it .

 As many as 16 subspecies of the blue duiker have been proposed . In 1997 , Jonathan Kingdon demarcated seven major populations of the species . In 2001 , Groves and Grubb identified the following subspecies , bifurcating them into two groups on the basis of their colouration and geographical occurrence : 
 The grey @-@ legged or northern subspecies 
 P. m. aequatorialis ( Matschie , 1892 ) – The range , bounded by the Congo River on the west , extends from the Democratic Republic of Congo into Uganda , and up to the Nile River . It is also found to the northeast of the <unk> Mountains ( South Sudan ) . 
 P. m. congicus ( <unk> , 1908 ) – The range extends from the east of the Cross River across the Ubangi River to the Congo River , till Lisala ( Democratic Republic of Congo ) . It is also found north of the mouth of the Congo River and in Cameroon and Gabon . 
 P. m. <unk> ( Thomas , 1898 ) – The range extends from the Southern Highlands of Tanzania till the Malawi border , though it may occur in the Nyika Plateau in northern Malawi . 
 P. m. <unk> ( Gray , 1846 ) – The type locality is Bioko , Equatorial Guinea . 
 P. m. <unk> ( Heller , 1913 ) – Occurs in eastern Ugandan and Kenyan forests . The range extends as far east as the East African Rift . 
 P. m. sundevalli ( Fitzinger , 1869 ) – It occurs in the eastern African coast , and on the islands of Mafia , Pemba and Zanzibar . 
 The red @-@ legged or southern subspecies 
 P. m. anchietae ( Bocage , 1879 ) – The type locality is northern Angola . 
 P. m. bicolor ( Gray , 1863 ) – The range extends from Zanzibar to the KwaZulu Natal region in South Africa . 
 P. m. <unk> ( W. Rothschild , 1904 ) – The type locality is to the west of the steep cliffs in the Muchinga Province ( Zambia ) . 
 P. m. hecki ( Matschie , 1897 ) – Occurs in Malawi , east of the valley of the Luangwa River ( Zambia ) and northern Mozambique . 
 P. m. monticola ( Thunberg , 1789 ) – Occurs in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces of South Africa . 
 P. m. <unk> ( Thomas , 1910 ) – Occurs between the lower Congo River and its tributary Kasai River . 
 = = Description = = 
 The blue duiker is a small antelope ; in fact , it is the smallest duiker . The head @-@ and @-@ body length is typically between 55 and 90 centimetres ( 22 and 35 in ) . It reaches 32 – 41 centimetres ( 13 – 16 in ) at the shoulder and weighs nearly 3 @.@ 5 – 9 kilograms ( 7 @.@ 7 – 19 @.@ 8 lb ) . P. m. anchietae is the largest subspecies . Sexually dimorphic , the females are slightly larger than the males . The blue duiker is characterised by a flat forehead , large eyes , small ears with a line of white , large nostrils , a broad mouth and agile lips . The dark tail measures slightly above 10 centimetres ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) . A remarkable feature of the tail is the row of white <unk> hairs on either flank that reflect light efficiently , so that when the animal moves its tail up and down , it looks like a luminous signal in the dark habitat . The duiker has short , spiky horns , around 5 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) long and hidden in hair tufts . A row of minute pores surrounded by a few hairs in the preorbital glands ( near the eyes ) secrete an opaque liquid consisting of 45 volatile compounds . The pedal glands ( near the hooves ) produce a pungent , whitish fluid . 
 The subspecies show a great degree of variation in their colouration . The coat can be a shade of blue , grey or brown , and even black . The grey @-@ legged northern subspecies show a grey to brown colouration , with a posterior stripe that marks a transition from the rump to the buttocks . P. m. congicus has a bright grey to black back , with dull grey flanks ; a dark brown stripe marks the shift from the black rump to the lighter buttocks . P. m. sundevalli is similar , though the difference between the flanks and the rump is less notable . P. m. aequatorialis is paler and browner than P. m. congicus with a less sharp transition . The stripe is fainter and the back darker in P. m. <unk> . P. m. <unk> can be told apart from its darker colouration ; the flanks and the dorsal parts are dark grey to brown , the underside grey and a black rump . The diminutive P. m. <unk> stands apart as well , with black dorsal parts , pinkish grey sides and long thick fur . 
 The southern subspecies , on the other hand , have reddish tan legs and reddish coats . P. m. hecki is a light fawn to greyish black with light red flanks and a white underbelly ; a change in tone can be observed as the rump is a darker reddish fawn . The paler P. m. <unk> is grey in the middle portion of the back , with red to fawn sides , and dark rump and tail . P. m. monticola , light grey to fawn with a reddish rump , is darker than P. m. bicolor , that has reddish orange flanks . P. m. anchietae is a pale grey or brown on the back with white underparts and a black tail ; there is a clear transition from the grey sides and anterior parts to the reddish rump . P. m. <unk> is distinguished by a facial stripe with white ventral parts ; the rump is redder than the flanks . 
 The blue duiker bears a significant resemblance to Maxwell 's duiker . However , the latter is nearly twice as large and heavier as the former , with a larger skull . While colouration is more uniform in Maxwell 's duiker , the blue duiker shows two different colourations . Another point of difference is the pedal gland ( in the hooves ) , which has a simpler opening in the blue duiker . Walter 's duiker is notably lighter in colour ; the flanks are brown instead of grey . 
 = = Ecology and behaviour = = 
 The blue duiker is diurnal ( active during the day ) . Secretive and cautious , it confines itself to the forest fringes . Territorial , individuals of opposite sexes form pairs and occupy territories , nearly 0 @.@ 4 – 0 @.@ 8 hectares ( 0 @.@ 0015 – 0 @.@ 0031 sq mi ) large and marked by preorbital gland secretions . The animal rubs the preorbital glands on trees and logs to mark its territory with the fluid produced by the glands . A vocal bovid , bird @-@ like chirps denote curiosity in the animal . It can let out <unk> typical of cats if distressed . A female not in oestrus will avoid the male 's advances , and may even let out a whistling call . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 The diet consists of fallen fruits , foliage , flowers and pieces of bark , provided mainly by the forest canopies in their habitat . Fungi , resin , particularly exudates from Albizia species and animal matter such as ants ( which are licked from the ground ) may also be included in the diet . The blue duiker can sustain itself on dead foliage better than other duiker species . A 1990 study analysed 12 stomachs and determined the content of dicotyledonous leaves to be 70 % , while fruits and seeds comprised 23 % of the diets and fresh foliage was plenty and perennial . Fruits were , however , strongly preferred to foliage . In 2001 , American zoologist Don E. Wilson observed 18 stomachs , and concluded that nearly three @-@ fourths were occupied by fruits , browse took 15 percent of the volume , while fungi and flowers took 5 percent each . They may forage by tracking the movements of birds and monkeys . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 The age when sexual maturity is gained has been given differently by different studies . Wilson observed that females become mature before 13 months , and the minimum age was found to be eight months . He noted that males take longer to mature , nearly 11 to 14 months . The species is monogamous , with pairs remaining together throughout the year . The length of the gestational period has been estimated from as short as four months to as long as seven months . The former estimate is supported by observations in the Ituri Rainforest ( Democratic Republic of Congo ) . Births occur throughout the year , though the birth rate might fall in the dry season . The calf can start moving about on its own within 20 minutes of birth , and is nursed thrice a day . It is kept in hiding for most of the time . The nursing intervals become irregular towards weaning , which occurs at 2 @.@ 5 to 3 months . Males visit their mates occasionally , though they disappear for about a month after the calf 's birth to probably protect the calf . A postpartum oestrus occurs three to five days after the birth . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 This species can survive in a variety of forests , including old @-@ growth , secondary , gallery forests . Forests are preferred as these provide the animal with shelter through the dense understory and forage through canopy . They can also be found in pockets of degraded and regenerated forests from the sea level up to an altitude of 3 @,@ 000 metres ( 9 @,@ 800 ft ) . The duiker can be found in several countries in the western , southern and eastern parts of Africa : Angola , Cameroon , Central African Republic , The Democratic Republic of Congo , Equatorial Guinea , Gabon , Kenya , Malawi , Mozambique , Nigeria , Rwanda , South Africa , South Sudan , Tanzania , Uganda , Zambia and Zimbabwe . 
 = = Threats and conservation = = 
 The blue duiker is categorised as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources ( IUCN ) . It is listed in Appendix II of CITES ( Washington Convention ) . While the population trend is reasonably stable , the blue duiker is threatened by extensive bushmeat hunting across its range . Wilson claimed that the blue duiker has the greatest economic as well as ecological significance of any African ungulate . Blue duiker meat is an important source of nutrition in its range . However , the blue duiker can survive despite human interference in its habitat . 
 P. monticola occurs in the following protected areas across its range : Dja Faunal Reserve and Lobéké National Park ( Cameroon ) ; Dzanga @-@ Sangha Special Reserve and Dzanga @-@ Ndoki National Park ( Central African Republic ) ; Monte Alén National Park ( Equatorial Guinea ) ; Lopé National Park and Gamba ( Gabon ) ; Odzala , <unk> @-@ Ndoki and <unk> @-@ <unk> National Parks and Lake Tele region ( Congo @-@ Brazzaville ) ; the Okapi Wildlife Reserve and Maiko , <unk> @-@ <unk> and Salonga National Parks ( Congo @-@ Kinshasa ) ; and numerous others in South Africa . 
 = Maryana Marrash = 
 Maryana bint Fathallah bin Nasrallah Marrash ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> <unk> الله بن <unk> <unk> / ALA @-@ LC : <unk> bint <unk> Allāh bin <unk> <unk> ; 1848 – 1919 ) , also known as Maryana al @-@ Marrash al @-@ <unk> , was a Syrian writer and poet of the Nahda movement — the Arabic renaissance . She revived the tradition of literary salons in the Middle East and was the first Syrian woman to publish a collection of poetry . She may have been the first woman to write in the Arab daily newspapers . 
 = = Life = = 
 = = = Background and education = = = 
 Maryana Marrash was born in Aleppo , a city of Ottoman Syria ( present @-@ day Syria ) , to an old Melkite family of merchants known for their literary interests . Having earned wealth and standing in the 18th century , the family was well established in Aleppo , although they had gone through troubles : a relative of Maryana , Butrus Marrash , was martyred by Greek Orthodox fundamentalists in April 1818 . Other Melkite Catholics were exiled from Aleppo during the persecutions , among them the priest Jibrail Marrash . Maryana 's father , Fathallah , tried to defuse the sectarian conflict by writing a treatise in 1849 , in which he rejected the Filioque . He had built up a large private library to give his three children Francis , Abdallah and Maryana a thorough education , particularly in the field of Arabic language and literature . As quoted by Marilyn Booth , Maryana 's mother was from " the famous al @-@ <unk> family " . 
 Aleppo was then a major intellectual center of the Ottoman Empire , featuring many thinkers and writers concerned with the future of the Arabs . It was in the French missionary schools that the Marrash family learnt Arabic with French , and other foreign languages ( Italian and English ) . By providing their daughter with an education , at a time when Middle Eastern women received none , Maryana 's parents challenged the then widespread belief that a girl should not be educated " so she would not sit in the men 's reception room " , as quoted by Marilyn Booth . Thus , Fathallah put his five @-@ year @-@ old daughter in a Maronite school . Later on , Maryana was educated by the nuns of St. Joseph in Aleppo . She finally went to an English school in Beirut . In addition to her formal education in these schools , where she was exposed to French and Anglo @-@ Saxon cultures , she was tutored by her father and brothers , especially on the subject of Arabic literature . The first biographies of Maryana mention that she excelled in French , Arabic and mathematics , and that she played the qanun and sang beautifully . 
 Aleppine historian Muhammad Raghib al @-@ <unk> wrote that she was unique in Aleppo , and that " people looked at her with a different eye " . Although she had many suitors , she initially wished to remain single . However , she was persuaded to marry after her mother 's death , and chose for husband Habib <unk> , a scion of a local Christian family . They had one son and two daughters . 
 = = = Literary career = = = 
 As early as 1870 or 1871 , Marrash started contributing articles and poems to journals — especially Lisan al @-@ hal and al @-@ Jinan , both of Beirut . In her articles , she criticized the condition of Arab women , urging the latter — regardless of their religious affiliations — to seek education and express themselves on matters of concern to them . Her collection of poetry Bint <unk> ( A Daughter of Thought ) was published in Beirut in 1893 . Marrash was granted permission by the Ottoman government to print her book after composing a poem exalting Sultan Abdul Hamid II . In some of the several other panegyrics included in the collection , she also praised Ottoman governors of Aleppo . Her poetry was much more traditional in style than her brother Francis ' , as exemplified by the elegy she composed to lament his death ; yet , she was at home with the poetry of French romantics , especially that of Alphonse de Lamartine and Alfred de Musset . Sami Kayyali said about Marrash : 
 The emergence of a woman writing in the press and composing poetry in this dark era was a significant event . Our recent history shows that it was rare for even men to read and write ; her appearance in these dark nights was thus like a bright star in the center of the heavens . 
 Her non @-@ fiction works also include a history of late Ottoman Syria , <unk> Suriya al @-@ hadith , the first book on the subject . 
 = = = Marrash 's salon = = = 
 Marrash was famous for the salon she held in the home she shared with her husband . She had travelled to Europe once , and was impressed by what she saw of life there . As related by Joseph Zeidan : 
 Upon her return in Aleppo , Maryana Marrash turned her house into a gathering place for a group of celebrated writers who met there on a regular basis to cultivate each other 's friendship and discuss literature , music , and political and social issues . 
 However , according to Joseph Zeidan , there are no proofs supporting whether or not she created her salon after seeing similar ones in Europe ; in any case , it did not start from scratch , since " most of the participants were regular visitors to her family 's home , where they used to meet with her father and two brothers . " The members of Maryana 's salon included prominent Aleppine intellectuals of both sexes , in addition to politicians and members of the foreign diplomatic corps . Marrash was fully engaged in the intellectual discourse and would also entertain her guests by playing the qanun and singing . Antun Sha <unk> has described typical evenings spent at Marrash 's salon : 
 Wearing either all black or all white dresses ordered from Paris , Marrash hosted the mixed evening get @-@ togethers in which literary topics as varied as the <unk> — a cycle of seven pre @-@ Islamic poems — or the work of Rabelais were discussed . Chess and card games were played , and complicated poetry competitions took place ; wine and ' <unk> flowed freely ; participants sang , danced , and listened to records played on a phonograph . 
 However , <unk> <unk> Watenpaugh has presumed Sha <unk> 's description to be partly apocryphal . 
 = The Sirens and Ulysses = 
 The Sirens and Ulysses is a large oil painting on canvas by the English artist William Etty , first exhibited in 1837 . It depicts the scene from Homer 's Odyssey in which Ulysses ( Odysseus ) resists the bewitching song of the Sirens by having his ship 's crew tie him up , while they block their own ears to prevent themselves from hearing the song . 
 While traditionally the Sirens had been depicted as human @-@ animal chimeras , Etty portrayed them as naked young women , on an island strewn with decaying corpses . The painting divided opinion at the time of its first exhibition , with some critics greatly admiring it while others derided it as tasteless and unpleasant . Possibly owing to its unusually large size , 442 @.@ 5 cm by 297 cm ( 14 ft 6 in by 9 ft 9 in ) , the work initially failed to sell , and was bought later that year at a bargain price by the Manchester merchant Daniel Grant . Grant died shortly afterwards , and his brother donated The Sirens and Ulysses to the Royal Manchester Institution . 
 The Sirens and Ulysses was painted using an experimental technique , which caused it to begin to deteriorate as soon as it was complete . It was shown in a major London exhibition of Etty 's work in 1849 and at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester , but was then considered in too poor a condition for continued public display and was placed in the gallery 's archives . Restoration began on the work in 2003 , and in 2010 the painting went on display in the Manchester Art Gallery , over 150 years after being consigned to storage . 
 = = Background = = 
 York @-@ born William Etty ( 1787 – 1849 ) had originally been an apprentice printer in Hull , but on completing his apprenticeship at the age of 18 moved to London to become an artist . Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens , he became famous for painting nude figures in biblical , literary and mythological settings . While many of his peers greatly admired him and elected him a full Royal Academician in 1828 , others condemned the content of his work as indecent . 
 Throughout his early career Etty was highly regarded by wealthy lawyer Thomas Myers , who had been educated at Eton College and thus had a good knowledge of classical mythology . From 1832 onwards Myers regularly wrote to Etty to suggest potential subjects for paintings . Myers was convinced that there was a significant market for very large paintings , and encouraged Etty to make such works . In 1834 , he suggested the theme of Ulysses ( " Odysseus " in the original Greek ) encountering the Sirens , a scene from the Odyssey in which a ship 's crew sails past the island home of the Sirens . The Sirens were famous for the beauty of their singing , which would lure sailors to their deaths . Ulysses wanted to hear their song , so had his crew lash him to the ship 's mast under strict orders not to untie him , after which they blocked their ears until they were safely out of range of the island . 
 The topic of Ulysses encountering the Sirens was well suited to Etty 's taste ; as he wrote at the time , " My aim in all my great pictures has been to paint some great moral on the heart ... the importance of resisting <unk> <unk> " . In his depiction of the scene , he probably worked from Alexander Pope 's translation , " Their song is death , and makes destruction please . / <unk> the man whom music wins to stay / Nigh the <unk> 'd shore , and listen to the lay ... In verdant <unk> they sport , and wide around / Lie human bones that <unk> all the ground . / The ground polluted floats with human gore / And human carnage taints the dreadful shore . " 
 = = Composition and reception = = 
 The Sirens and Ulysses shows three Sirens singing on an island , surrounded by the rotting corpses of dead sailors . Ulysses is visible in the background tied to the mast of his ship , while dark clouds rise in the background . 
 Ulysses appears larger than his fellow sailors , while the Sirens hold out their arms in traditional dramatic poses . The three Sirens are very similar in appearance , and Etty 's biographer Leonard Robinson believes it likely that Etty painted the same model in three different poses . Robinson considers their classical poses to be the result of Etty 's lifelong attendance at the Academy 's Life Classes , where models were always in traditional poses , while former curator of York Art Gallery Richard Green considers their pose a tribute to the Nereids in Rubens 's The Disembarkation at Marseilles , a work Etty is known to have admired and of which he made a copy in 1823 . 
 The physical appearance of the Sirens is not described in the Odyssey , and the traditional Greek representation of them was as bird @-@ lion or bird @-@ human chimeras . Etty rationalised the fully human appearance of his Sirens by explaining that their forms became fully human once out of the sea , an approach followed by a number of later painters of the subject . 
 Etty put a great deal of effort into the painting , including visiting a mortuary to sketch the dead and decaying bodies on the Sirens ' island . His use of real corpses became publicly known , causing complaints from some critics . Although he visited Brighton in 1836 to make studies of the sea in connection with the painting , Etty had little experience of landscape and seascape painting , and the painting of the sea and clouds is rudimentary in comparison with the rest of the work . 
 The painting was Etty 's largest work to that time , measuring 442 @.@ 5 cm by 297 cm ( 14 ft 6 in by 9 ft 9 in ) . The work was completed in 1837 and exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts later that year , and hung in the Academy 's new building at Trafalgar Square ( now the National Gallery ) . The work , and Etty 's methods in making it , divided opinion : The Gentleman 's Magazine considered it " by far the finest [ painting ] that Mr. Etty has ever painted ... it is a historical work of the first class , and abounds with beauties of all kinds " , while The Spectator described it as " a disgusting combination of voluptuousness and loathsome <unk> — glowing in colour and wonderful in execution , but conceived in the worst possible taste " . 
 Possibly because of its size , The Sirens and Ulysses failed to sell at the 1837 Summer Exhibition . In October 1837 wealthy Manchester cotton merchant Daniel Grant , an admirer of Etty who had already commissioned Venus and her Doves from him , met Etty at Heaton Park races and offered to buy The Sirens and Ulysses and Etty 's smaller Samson Betrayed by Delilah unseen for a total of £ 200 . Etty was hoping for £ 400 for the two paintings , but on being told by Grant that his firm had lost £ 100 @,@ 000 that year offered a price of £ 300 for the pair . Grant counter @-@ offered £ 250 ( about £ 20 @,@ 000 in today 's terms ) , which Etty refused . On leaving at the end of the evening , Grant suddenly said , " Will you take the money ? " , startling Etty , who in his surprise agreed . Grant died shortly afterwards , leaving the painting to his brother William , who in turn gave it to the Royal Manchester Institution in 1839 . 
 Etty considered the painting to be his best work , insisting that it form the centrepiece of his 1849 Royal Society of Arts solo exhibition . The Royal Manchester Institution was concerned that the painting would be damaged if moved , refusing to allow it to be used in the exhibition until Etty , and a number of influential friends , visited Manchester to beg them to release it . Etty died later that year , and his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity . Interest in him declined over time , and by the end of the 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices . As it was rarely exhibited , The Sirens and Ulysses had little influence on later artists , although it is credited as an influence on Frederic Leighton 's 1858 The Fisherman and the Syren . 
 Ulysses and the Sirens is one of those great efforts of my Art achieved in the vigour of my life , I can never make again . 
 = = Removal and restoration = = 
 Etty had used experimental techniques to make The Sirens and Ulysses , using a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which caused the paint to dry hard and brittle , and to flake off once dry , a problem made worse by the painting 's large size causing it to flex whenever it was moved . From the moment it was complete it began to deteriorate . After it was exhibited at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition it was considered in too poor a condition for public display , and it was placed in long @-@ term storage in the archives of the Royal Manchester Institution and its successor , the Manchester Art Gallery . In the mid 20th century there were a number of unsuccessful attempts to repair The Sirens and Ulysses , but an attempt to clean the painting unintentionally damaged the paint further . 
 In 2003 , Manchester Art Gallery staff determined that if conservation work were not undertaken , the painting would soon be beyond repair . The <unk> Fairbairn Foundation and AXA Art Insurance provided funding for the restoration . A replacement canvas to which the painting had been attached in the 1930s was removed . Following this , a mixture of isinglass adhesive and chalk was used to restore the surface of the painting , and the paint added during the earlier attempted restoration was removed . A new double layer of canvas was added to the back of the painting , and the three layers were glued together . 
 In 2006 the repaired painting was moved back from the conservation studios to the Manchester Art Gallery . The Gallery Nine section of the MAG was converted into a temporary studio , open to the public to watch the final retouching work until it was completed in 2010 , and The Sirens and Ulysses currently hangs in Gallery Three . 
 = Listen ( Beyoncé song ) = 
 " Listen " is a song recorded by American singer Beyoncé . The song was written by Henry Krieger , Scott Cutler , Anne Preven , and Beyoncé , and produced by The Underdogs , Matt Sullivan and Randy <unk> for the 2006 musical film Dreamgirls , in which Beyoncé 's character Deena Jones sings the song in an expression of independence from her controlling husband . Columbia Records released " Listen " as the lead single from the Dreamgirls : Music from the Motion Picture soundtrack album on December 5 , 2006 . It additionally appeared as a hidden track on international editions , and on the deluxe edition of Beyoncé 's second solo studio album , B 'Day . The Spanish version of the song , " Oye " , was released on the EP , Irreemplazable , and the Spanish deluxe edition of B 'Day . 
 One of four new songs written for the feature version of Dreamgirls ( originally a 1981 Broadway musical ) " Listen " is a soul @-@ R & B song ; its lyrics make reference to tenacity , love , the refusal to defer dreams and finally rise towards fame . Its instrumentation includes bass , drums , guitars , keyboards , percussion , and violins , among others . The song was a critical success . Contemporary music critics complimented the strong and emotional vocals of Beyoncé , and added that the lyrics perfectly elaborate on Deena Jones 's life . " Listen " won Best Original Song at the 2007 Critics ' Choice Awards . It was nominated in the same category at the 2006 International Press Academy Satellite Award , at the 2007 Golden Globe Awards , and at the 2007 Academy Awards . 
 " Listen " peaked at number 61 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and generally peaked inside the top 20 positions in European countries . It fared better in the United Kingdom where it reached number eight thanks to a live duet performance of Beyoncé and Alexandra Burke at The X Factor , where Burke emerged as the winner after singing " Listen " during the finale . The song was also covered by Charice and Melanie Amaro during the finale of the first season of the The X Factor in the US , where she emerged as the winner . Two accompanying music videos were filmed for " Listen " ; the performance version was directed by Diane Martel , and the second one , being Vogue Shoot Version , was directed by Matthew Rolston . " Listen " was also a part of her set list on The Beyoncé Experience ( 2007 ) and I Am ... Tour ( 2009 – 10 ) . 
 = = Context = = 
 In the film version of Dreamgirls , Beyoncé portrays the character of Deena Jones , a pop singer loosely based on Motown star Diana Ross . The story explores the life of The Dreams ( based on The Supremes ) , a fictional 1960s group of three female singers : Effie White ( Jennifer Hudson ) , Deena Jones and <unk> Robinson ( Anika Noni Rose ) , whose manager Curtis Taylor ( based on Berry Gordy and played by Jamie Foxx ) manipulates their personal and professional relationships . 
 During the second half of the film , Curtis and Deena argue at dinner over Deena 's desire to make her film debut in an urban film instead of the Cleopatra prequel that Curtis is producing . An angry Curtis asserts his creative and psychological control over his wife , informing Deena that he would not let anyone else " handle " her , because , in his words , " no one knows you the way I do " . Curtis tells Deena that he put Deena as lead singer of the Dreams because her voice " had no personality . No depth . Except for what [ he ] put in there " . 
 In the context of the film , " Listen " is a 1975 song that Deena records on Rainbow Records , a recording empire established by Curtis . She is actually recording the song in a booth as a track , but the song also reveals Deena 's growing disgust at being considered merely Curtis ' property . Used in the film as a last @-@ minute recording by Deena before leaving Curtis " to find her own voice as a newly independent woman " , co @-@ writer Anne Preven called " Listen " a song which " Deena is exclaiming , ' You don 't know who I am , and I know I do . ' " 
 = = Production and composition = = 
 Upon reading the script for Dreamgirls , director Bill Condon felt the second half of the film needed a song . The " emotional punch " of " And I Am Telling You I 'm Not Going " led him to ask the musical team for Dreamgirls " to create a new and equally moving song to energize the second act " . Led by Henry Krieger , the composer of the original 1981 Broadway musical version of Dreamgirls , " Listen " was written with help from Scott Cutler , Preven , and Beyoncé ; it was one of four songs written for the film version of Dreamgirls . " Listen " was produced by the R & B @-@ pop production duo The Underdogs . 
 " Listen " is a soul @-@ R & B ballad , which is written in the key of B major , and set in common time at a moderately slow groove of 62 beats per minute . Beyoncé 's vocals range from the note of F ♯ 3 to G5 . The song 's music takes its instrumentation from the bass , celli , drums , guitars , keyboards , percussion , violas , and violins . According to Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe , its lyrics make reference to tenacity , love , and the refusal to defer dreams ; Beyoncé , as the female protagonist , sings , " demanding her moment in the sun " . Chuck Taylor of Billboard magazine wrote that Beyoncé shimmers " with evocative emotion " , rising to new heights alongside " a golden melody with spellbinding , rafter @-@ raising production " . The lyrics are written in the traditional verse @-@ chorus form . The song starts with the lines : " Listen to the song here in my heart , a melody I start but can 't complete " .
