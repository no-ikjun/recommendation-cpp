 The Slip is the seventh studio album by American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails , released on July 22 , 2008 . It was the fourth consecutive Nine Inch Nails release to be produced by frontman Trent Reznor with collaborators Atticus Ross and Alan Moulder . The album was released for free under a Creative Commons ( BY @-@ NC @-@ SA ) license , with the message from Reznor , " this one 's on me " . The Slip was initially released digitally via the Nine Inch Nails official website without any prior advertisement or promotion . A limited @-@ edition , physical version followed two months later , though this iteration of the album was not free . 
 The Slip was originally intended to be an EP , but eventually grew to be a full @-@ length album . It was recorded and released in three weeks ; Reznor released the album 's single , " Discipline " , to radio stations himself , less than 24 hours after it was mastered by Moulder . Critical reception of the album has been generally favorable , and its unorthodox method of release attracted significant media attention . The album peaked at number 13 on the Billboard 200 .

 Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor announced in 2007 that the band had completed its contractual obligations to its record label Interscope Records , and would no longer be working with the company . Reznor also revealed that Nine Inch Nails would likely distribute any future material independently . Following the announcement , Nine Inch Nails released the 36 @-@ track instrumental album Ghosts I – IV in March , 2008 on Reznor 's independent label The Null Corporation . 
 Reznor returned to writing soon after the release of Ghosts , and after a month of work , The Slip was recorded in three weeks of studio time at Trent Reznor 's in @-@ home studio . The album was engineered by Atticus Ross and mixed by Alan Moulder , both of whom co @-@ produced it with Reznor . Originally intended as an EP , in Reznor 's own words " it just kept growing legs until it [ became ] what it is " . Some instrumental performances were contributed by NIN live band members Josh Freese , Robin Finck and Alessandro Cortini , though they did not participate in the songwriting process ; their contributions were limited to small parts rather than complete song recordings . During recording sessions , Reznor sent the album 's first and only single , " Discipline " , to radio stations before the remainder of the album was completed , and less than 24 hours after the track had been mastered . According to Reznor , the track listing and lyrics were finished on a Wednesday , the final mix and album sequencing on Thursday , the mastering on Friday , artwork on Saturday and the album was released on Sunday , May 5 . Reznor reflected on the quick turnaround by saying " that was fun [ ... ] you never could have done that before " , referring to the slow and bureaucratic pace of record production , promotion and release he experienced with major record labels .

 Many critics noted how tracks on The Slip echoed musical stylings from the band 's past , and that the record contained musical allusions to older Nine Inch Nails records . Anastasia <unk> of the Cleveland Free Times said that " The Slip more or less sums up the terrain Reznor 's covered in his nearly two @-@ decade career " , and went on to compare the album sound with the " edgy but irresistible beats " of Pretty Hate Machine and The Downward Spiral , and " the elusive atmospherics " of The Fragile . Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that " the music revives Nine Inch Nails ' past , from stomping hard rock to dance @-@ club beats to piano ballad to inexorably building instrumentals . " The album 's final track , " Demon Seed " , directly incorporates instrumental elements from the final track of the band 's previous all @-@ instrumental album Ghosts I – IV . 
 Ed Thompson of IGN commented that the tracks " Discipline " and " Echoplex " channeled " bits and pieces of Depeche Mode , Bauhaus and even some Siouxsie and the Banshees " . Richard Cromelin of the Los Angeles Times called The Slip " <unk> and less catchy than the last couple of regular NIN albums " , and added that " Reznor blends the jarring sounds of the industrial rock genre [ ... ] with a terse , punk @-@ like attack , bringing an insistent , sometimes claustrophobic feel to his scenarios of alienation " . 
 Lyrically , Eric Harvey of Pitchfork compared " Discipline " to one of Nine Inch Nails 's first singles , " Head Like a Hole " , saying " [ ' Discipline ' ] comes from a long @-@ established and now label @-@ free artist trying to reflexively reassert his position in the pop landscape , on his own terms . [ ... ] ' Discipline ' evinces Reznor 's desire for some sort of framework [ ... ] In relative terms , ' I need your discipline / I need your help ' is sure a long way from the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old ' Head Like a Hole ' refrain ' I 'd rather die / Than give you control ' . " Tom Breihan of The Village Voice reached a similar interpretation of the album 's lyrical content , writing " The Slip seems to deal with Reznor 's break from the corporate machine , or at least from the numbing conformity @-@ minded forces it represents . " 
 In commenting on the album , Reznor has said that it derived from " a weird sense of being outside [ himself ] in isolation and watching [ himself ] getting older . " He also described it as " a quickly assembled album " , and as " more of a sketch than a painting . " Reznor compared the quick assembly of The Slip to the much longer process of creating his 1999 double album The Fragile , saying that the creation of The Slip relied more on " reflexes " and that his next project would be given more " editorial time " .

 Rob Sheridan , in collaboration with Reznor , was the album 's art director , as he had been for the previous three Nine Inch Nails studio albums , Ghosts I – IV ( 2008 ) , Year Zero ( 2007 ) , and With Teeth ( 2005 ) . The downloadable version of The Slip comes with a PDF containing liner notes and album art . Like Ghosts I @-@ IV , each track from the album is accompanied by its own graphic image , each of which consists chiefly of geometric patterns against a grey background .

 Trent Reznor posted on the official Nine Inch Nails website on April 21 a message saying " 2 weeks ! " Reznor employed a similar tactic to tease the release of the band 's previous album ( Ghosts I – IV ) earlier the same year . The following day , Reznor released the single , " Discipline " , by email to radio stations and as a free download on the official Nine Inch Nails site . The song failed to conquer the pole position of the Billboard Alternative Songs chart as expected , and charted below the Top 5 . Another song , " Echoplex " , was released as a free download from iLike later . The ID3 tags of these MP3 files also pointed to the date May 5 , just as Reznor 's post had . On May 5 , a free direct download link to the album in MP3 format was posted on the official Nine Inch Nails website , with a message from Reznor that said : " Thank you for your continued and loyal support over the years - this one 's on me . " The digital download is available in a variety of DRM @-@ free audio , in both CD standard and higher resolution formats . The lyrics for each track are embedded using ID3 tags , for viewing in supported media players . 
 Like the previous Nine Inch Nails studio album Ghosts I – IV , The Slip was released under a Creative Commons attribution @-@ noncommercial share @-@ alike license , in effect allowing anyone to use or rework the material for any non @-@ profit purpose , as long as credit is provided and the resulting work is released under a similar license . The website further expands this by saying " we encourage you to remix it , share it with your friends , post it on your blog , play it on your podcast , give it to strangers , etc . " As with Ghosts I – IV and Year Zero , multi @-@ track audio source files of the album were also made available at the official Nine Inch Nails remix site . Reznor also plans on giving away the online software and digital infrastructure through which both The Slip and Ghosts were released . 
 The Slip was released on CD in the United States and Canada on July 22 ; unlike the digital release , however , the physical version of the album was not free . The physical package was released as a six @-@ panel digipack which contained the album itself , a 24 @-@ page booklet , a sticker pack , and a DVD with live rehearsals of " 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 " , " Letting You " , " Discipline " , " Echoplex " , and " Head Down " . Three of these videos were featured on Pitchfork Media prior to the CD / DVD release . The physical release of the album was limited to 250 @,@ 000 numbered units worldwide and as of December 2011 is still available . An unlimited 180 @-@ gram gatefold vinyl was released in the US and Canada on August 12 , and in the United Kingdom August 18 .

 Since the release of Ghosts I – IV , a 25 @-@ date tour was announced in several North American cities . Cortini and Freese returned as members from the previous tour , while Finck rejoined the live band . The lineup was initially to include Rich Fownes , but before any scheduled performances it was revealed that Justin Meldal @-@ Johnsen would instead be contributing on bass guitar . 
 Supporting acts for the tour include Deerhunter , Crystal Castles , Does It Offend You , Yeah ? , <unk> Observatory , A Place to Bury Strangers , and White Williams . In early June , a tour EP was released for free on the Nine Inch Nails website featuring four songs from the supporting artists and one from Nine Inch Nails . The files are DRM @-@ free MP3s that are fully tagged , and included with the download are desktop wallpapers and a printable tour poster . 
 The band headlined the 2008 Lollapalooza festival , the 2008 Virgin Festival , and the first Pemberton Festival . In May 2008 , Nine Inch Nails announced that premium seating for all the upcoming 2008 tour shows would be offered in a pre @-@ sale for fans who registered at the official Nine Inch Nails website . In an effort to combat ticket scalpers , each concert ticket will list the purchaser 's legal name . The ticketing process was previously used for smaller pre @-@ sales and was available exclusively to fan club members . On July 26 , Reznor introduced an " unplugged " portion into the live show in which the band steps to the front of the stage about an hour into the show , with Reznor on vibraphone and bassist Meldal @-@ Johnsen playing an upright bass . The 20 @-@ minute jazzy , acoustic set is taken mostly from Ghosts I - IV . The stage show also featured mesh LED curtains that projected various visuals , ranging from falling rain to static to a ruined city , and made the band appear to be playing on " a stage that appeared to be constructed entirely out of lights . " Nine Inch Nails later confirmed that the tour was to extend to South America and it was thought this would be the last Americas set of dates but soon after Reznor announced yet more North American dates including two dates in tourist capital Florida . 
 Initially , Reznor had been trying to set up a 3 @-@ D concert film intended for theatrical release to be overseen by director James Cameron . However a dispute with the bands then @-@ label Interscope Records led to the project being cancelled altogether ; much to the disappointment of fans . By December , a frustrated Reznor enabled a relaxed camera policy at the three remaining Lights in the Sky performances , eventually culminating in a 3 @-@ disc tour documentary created " by fans for fans " and sanctioned by the band , entitled Another Version of the Truth which was eventually released on DVD , Blu @-@ ray , and BitTorrent formats .

 A month and a half after its online release , The Slip had been downloaded 1 @.@ 4 million times from the official Nine Inch Nails website . By the time the physical version was released two months later , that number had grown beyond 2 million . The physical release of the album has sold more than 98 @,@ 000 copies , peaked at number 13 on the Billboard 200 and the Top Internet Albums charts , based on weekly retail sales . The album also charted internationally , including number 12 on the Canadian Albums Chart , number 2 on the Australian Albums Chart , and number 25 on the UK Albums Chart . The album 's only single , " Discipline " reached number 6 and number 24 on Billboard 's Alternative Songs and Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks charts , respectively , based on weekly radio airplay . 
 Following the release of The Slip and the similarly unorthodox release of Ghosts I – IV , Reznor confessed in retrospect that " It doesn 't feel like an overwhelming success to me . " 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 Critical response to The Slip has been generally favorable , with an average rating of 78 / 100 based on eleven reviews on Metacritic . IGN gave the album an 8 @.@ 8 out of 10 , stating " Simply put , The Slip is an amazing record . " The Toronto Star said " [ The Slip ] is hardly a throwaway , this seems a sincere gift to fans . " Eric Harvey of Pitchfork Media gave the album a 7 @.@ 5 out of 10 and wrote " Reznor 's unique capacity to commingle raging industrial bangers with ballads and ambient instrumental passages appears in its best form since The Downward Spiral , and here gains much of the focus and restraint that many remember used to be his calling card . " Daphne Carr of LA Weekly said " Musically , it ’ s his most adventurous work since The Fragile , and his business model is inspired — if unsustainable . " Mikael Wood of Spin complained that " a few tracks , such as ' The Four of Us Are Dying , ' go on for far too long " , but then said " Reznor recovers with a barn burner like ' Demon Seed ' " . 
 As with Ghosts I – IV , The Slip 's unorthodox distribution methods also garnered the attention of various news agencies . An ABC News op ed questioned if consumers would " ever pay for an album again " stating " with NIN now in the game , its [ sic ] hard to argue that this is anything but a harbinger of the future . " Commenting on the distribution of the album , Dave <unk> of U.S. News & World Report said " The move seems an even purer play than what Radiohead did with its most recent album , In Rainbows . " Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone magazine called giving away The Slip for free Reznor 's " most radical stunt yet " , and added that " [ it 's ] an impressively democratic , fourth @-@ wall @-@ shattering gesture coming from one of music 's biggest control @-@ freak auteurs . " Eric Harvey of Pitchfork Media compared the release strategy of The Slip favorably to that of Ghosts I – IV and Year Zero , writing " Unlike its most immediate predecessors , The Slip comes packaged with a crucial difference : the music itself is more satisfying than the sui generis marketing scheme . " 
 Rolling Stone named The Slip in their " Best of 2008 " list , ranking the album at number 37 , and named Reznor number 46 in its " 100 People Who Are Changing America " list , concluding that he has " been more creative than anyone in embracing the post @-@ CD era " . Following the release of the online @-@ releases of The Slip and Ghosts I – IV , Reznor was awarded the " Webby Artist of the Year Award " at the annual Webby Awards in 2009 .

 = Broad @-@ billed parrot = 
 The broad @-@ billed parrot or raven parrot ( Lophopsittacus mauritianus ) is a large extinct parrot in the family <unk> . It was endemic to the Mascarene island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar . It is unclear what other species it is most closely related to , but it has been classified as a member of the tribe Psittaculini , along with other Mascarene parrots . It had similarities with the Rodrigues parrot ( Necropsittacus rodricanus ) , and may have been closely related . 
 The broad @-@ billed parrot 's head was large in proportion to its body , and there was a distinct crest of feathers on the front of the head . The bird had a very large beak , comparable in size to that of the hyacinth macaw , which would have enabled it to crack hard seeds . Subfossil bones indicate that the species exhibited greater sexual dimorphism in overall size and head size than any living parrot . The exact colouration is unknown , but a contemporary description indicates that it had multiple colours , including a blue head , and perhaps a red body and beak . It is believed to have been a weak flier , but not flightless . 
 The broad @-@ billed parrot was first referred to as the " Indian raven " in Dutch ships ' journals from 1598 onwards . Only a few brief contemporary descriptions and three depictions are known . It was first scientifically described from a subfossil mandible in 1866 , but this was not linked to the old accounts until the rediscovery of a detailed 1601 sketch that matched old descriptions . The bird became extinct in the 17th century owing to a combination of deforestation , predation by introduced invasive species , and probably hunting as well . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The earliest known descriptions of the broad @-@ billed parrot were provided by Dutch travellers during the Second Dutch Expedition to Indonesia , led by Admiral Jacob Cornelis van Neck in 1598 . They appear in reports published in 1601 , which also contain the first illustration of the bird , along with the first of a dodo . The Dutch sailors who visited Mauritius categorised the broad @-@ billed parrots separately from parrots , and referred to them as " Indische ravens " ( translated as either " Indian ravens " or " Indian crows " ) without accompanying useful descriptions , which caused confusion when their journals were studied . 
 The English naturalist Hugh Edwin Strickland assigned the " Indian ravens " to the hornbill genus <unk> , because he interpreted the projection on the forehead in a crude illustration as a horn . The Dutch and the French also referred to South American macaws as " Indian ravens " during the 17th century , and the name was used for hornbills by Dutch , French , and English speakers in the East Indies . Sir Thomas Herbert referred to the broad @-@ billed parrot as " <unk> " ( cockatoo ) in 1634 , with the description " birds like <unk> [ sic ] , fierce and indomitable " , but naturalists did not realise that he was referring to the same bird . Even after subfossils of a parrot matching the descriptions were found , French zoologist Emile Oustalet argued that the " Indian raven " was a hornbill whose remains awaited discovery . France Staub was in favour of this idea as late as 1993 . No remains of hornbills have ever been found on the island , and apart from an extinct species from New Caledonia , hornbills are not found on any oceanic islands . 
 The first known physical remain of the broad @-@ billed parrot was a subfossil mandible collected along with the first batch of dodo bones found in the Mare aux Songes swamp . Richard Owen described the mandible in 1866 and identified it as belonging to a large parrot species , to which he gave the binomial name Psittacus mauritianus and the common name " broad @-@ billed parrot " . This holotype specimen is now lost . In 1868 , shortly after the 1601 journal of the Dutch East India Company ship Gelderland had been rediscovered , Hermann Schlegel examined an unlabelled pen @-@ and @-@ ink sketch in it . Realising that the drawing , which is attributed to the artist Joris Joostensz Laerle , depicted the parrot described by Owen , Schlegel made the connection with the old journal descriptions . In 1875 , because its bones and crest are significantly different from those of Psittacus species , Alfred Newton assigned it to its own genus , which he called Lophopsittacus . <unk> is the Ancient Greek word for crest , referring here to the bird 's frontal crest , and <unk> is Ancient Greek for parrot . 
 In 1973 , based on remains collected by Louis Etienne Thirioux in the early 20th century , D. T. Holyoak placed a small subfossil Mauritian parrot in the same genus as the broad @-@ billed parrot and named it Lophopsittacus bensoni . In 2007 , on the basis of a comparison of subfossils together with 17th and 18th century descriptions , Hume reclassified it as a species in the genus Psittacula and called it Thirioux 's grey parrot . Previously , James Greenway speculated that reports of grey Mauritian parrots referred to the broad @-@ billed parrot . 
 = = = Evolution = = = 
 The taxonomic affinities of the broad @-@ billed parrot are undetermined . Considering its large jaws and other osteological features , Edward Newton and Hans Gadow thought it to be closely related to the Rodrigues parrot ( Necropsittacus rodricanus ) , but were unable to determine whether they both belonged in the same genus , since a crest was only known from the latter . Graham S. Cowles instead found their skulls too dissimilar for them to be close relatives . 
 Many endemic Mascarene birds , including the dodo , are derived from South Asian ancestors , and the English palaeontologist Julian Hume has proposed that this may be the case for all the parrots there as well . Sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene , so it was possible for species to colonise some of the then less isolated islands . Although most extinct parrot species of the Mascarenes are poorly known , subfossil remains show that they shared features such as enlarged heads and jaws , reduced pectoral bones , and robust leg bones . Hume has suggested that they have a common origin in the radiation of the tribe Psittaculini , basing this theory on morphological features and the fact that Psittacula parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean . The Psittaculini may have invaded the area several times , as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea . A 2011 genetic study instead found that the Mascarene parrot ( Mascarinus mascarinus ) of nearby Réunion was most closely related to the lesser vasa parrot ( Coracopsis nigra ) from Madagascar and nearby islands , and therefore unrelated to the Psittacula parrots , undermining the theory of their common origin . 
 = = Description = = 
 The broad @-@ billed parrot possessed a distinct frontal crest of feathers . Ridges on the skull indicate that this crest was firmly attached , and that the bird , unlike cockatoos , could not raise or lower it . The 1601 Gelderland sketch was examined in 2003 by Hume , who compared the ink finish with the underlying pencil sketch and found that the latter showed several additional details . The pencil sketch depicts the crest as a tuft of rounded feathers attached to the front of the head at the base of the beak , and shows long primary covert feathers , large secondary feathers , and a slightly bifurcated tail . Measurements of sub @-@ fossils known by 1893 show that the mandible was 65 – 78 millimetres ( 2 @.@ 6 – 3 @.@ 1 in ) in length , 65 mm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) in width , the femur was 58 – 63 mm ( 2 @.@ 3 – 2 @.@ 5 in ) in length , the tibia was 88 – 99 mm ( 3 @.@ 5 – 3 @.@ 9 in ) , and the metatarsus 35 mm ( 1 @.@ 4 in ) . Unlike other Mascarene parrots , the broad @-@ billed parrot had a flattened skull . 
 Subfossils show that the males were larger , measuring 55 – 65 centimetres ( 22 – 26 in ) to the females ' 45 – 55 cm ( 18 – 22 in ) and that both sexes had disproportionately large heads and beaks . The sexual dimorphism in size between male and female skulls is the largest among parrots . Differences in the bones of the rest of the body and limbs are less pronounced ; nevertheless , it had greater sexual dimorphism in overall size than any living parrot . The size differences between the two birds in the 1601 sketch may be due to this feature . A 1602 account by Reyer <unk> has traditionally been interpreted as the only contemporary mention of size differences among broad @-@ billed parrots , listing " large and small Indian crows " among the animals of the island . A full transcript of the original text was only published in 2003 , and showed that a comma had been incorrectly placed in the English translation ; " large and small " instead referred to " field @-@ hens " , possibly the red rail and the smaller Sauzier 's wood rail . 
 There has been some confusion over the colouration of the broad @-@ billed parrot . The report of van Neck 's 1598 voyage , published in 1601 , contained the first illustration of the parrot , with a caption stating that the bird had " two or three colours " . The last account of the bird , and the only mention of specific colours , was by Johann Christian Hoffman in 1673 – 75 : 
 There are also geese , flamingos , three species of pigeon of varied colours , mottled and green perroquets , red crows with recurved beaks and with blue heads , which fly with difficulty and have received from the Dutch the name of ' Indian crow ' . 
 In spite of the mention of several colours , authors such as Walter Rothschild claimed that the Gelderland journal described the bird as entirely blue @-@ grey , and it was restored this way in Rothschild 's 1907 book Extinct Birds . Later examination of the journal by Julian Hume has revealed only a description of the dodo . He suggested that the distinctively drawn facial mask may represent a separate colour . The head was evidently blue , and in 2007 , Hume suggested the beak may have been red , and the rest of the plumage greyish or blackish , which also occurs in other members of Psittaculini . 
 In 2015 , a translation of the 1660s report of Johannes Pretorius about his stay on Mauritius was published , wherein he described the bird as " very beautifully coloured " . Hume accordingly reinterpreted Hoffman 's account , and suggested the bird may have been brightly coloured with a red body , blue head , and red beak ; the bird was illustrated as such in the paper by Ria Winters . Possible iridescent or glossy feathers that changed appearance according to angle of light may also have given the impression that it had even more colours . It has also been suggested that in addition to size dimorphism , the sexes may have had different colours , which would explain some of the discrepancies in old descriptions . 
 = = Behaviour and ecology = = 
 Johannes Pretorius ( on <unk> from 1666 to 1669 ) kept various now @-@ extinct Mauritian birds in captivity , and described the behaviour of the broad @-@ billed parrot as follows : 
 The Indian ravens are very beautifully coloured . They cannot fly and are not often found . This kind is a very bad tempered bird . When captive it refuses to eat . It would prefer to die rather than to live in captivity . 
 Though the broad @-@ billed parrot may have fed on the ground and been a weak flier , its tarsometatarsus was short and stout , implying some arboreal characteristics . The Newton brothers and many authors after them inferred that it was flightless , due to the apparent short wings and large size shown in the 1601 Gelderland sketch . According to Hume , the underlying pencil sketch actually shows that the wings are not particularly short . They appear broad , as they commonly are in forest @-@ adapted species , and the alula appears large , a feature of slow @-@ flying birds . Its sternal keel was reduced , but not enough to prevent flight , as the adept flying <unk> parrots also have reduced keels , and even the flightless kakapo , with its vestigial keel , is capable of gliding . Furthermore , Hoffman 's account states that it could fly , albeit with difficulty , and the first published illustration shows the bird on top of a tree , an improbable position for a flightless bird . The broad @-@ billed parrot may have been <unk> near @-@ flightless , like the now @-@ extinct Norfolk Island kaka . 
 Sexual dimorphism in beak size may have affected behaviour . Such dimorphism is common in other parrots , for example in the palm cockatoo and the New Zealand kaka . In species where it occurs , the sexes prefer food of different sizes , the males use their beaks in rituals , or the sexes have specialised roles in nesting and rearing . Similarly , the large difference between male and female head size may have been reflected in the ecology of each sex , though it is impossible to determine how . 
 Masauji Hachisuka suggested the broad @-@ billed parrot was nocturnal , like the kakapo and the night parrot , two extant ground @-@ dwelling parrots . Contemporary accounts do not corroborate this , and the orbits are of similar size to those of other large diurnal parrots . The broad @-@ billed parrot was recorded on the dry leeward side of Mauritius , which was the most accessible for people , and it was noted that birds were more abundant near the coast , which may indicate that the fauna of such areas was more diverse . It may have nested in tree cavities or rocks , like the Cuban amazon . The terms raven or crow may have been suggested by the bird 's harsh call , its behavioural traits , or just its dark plumage . The following description by Jacob <unk> from 1666 mentions some of the broad @-@ billed parrot 's co @-@ inhabitants of the forests , and might indicate its demeanour : 
 Within the forest dwell parrots , turtle and other wild doves , mischievous and unusually large ravens [ broad @-@ billed parrots ] , falcons , bats and other birds whose name I do not know , never having seen before . 
 Many other endemic species of Mauritius were lost after the arrival of man , so the ecosystem of the island is severely damaged and hard to reconstruct . Before humans arrived , Mauritius was entirely covered in forests , almost all of which have since been lost to deforestation . The surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened . The broad @-@ billed parrot lived alongside other recently extinct Mauritian birds such as the dodo , the red rail , the Mascarene grey parakeet , the Mauritius blue pigeon , the Mauritius owl , the Mascarene coot , the Mauritian shelduck , the Mauritian duck , and the Mauritius night heron . Extinct Mauritian reptiles include the saddle @-@ backed Mauritius giant tortoise , the domed Mauritius giant tortoise , the Mauritian giant skink , and the Round Island burrowing boa . The small Mauritian flying fox and the snail Tropidophora carinata lived on Mauritius and Réunion but became extinct in both islands . Some plants , such as Casearia tinifolia and the palm orchid , have also become extinct . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 Species that are morphologically similar to the broad @-@ billed parrot , such as the hyacinth macaw and the palm cockatoo , may provide insight into its ecology . Anodorhynchus macaws , which are habitual ground dwellers , eat very hard palm nuts . Carlos Yamashita has suggested that these macaws once depended on now @-@ extinct South American megafauna to eat fruits and excrete the seeds , and that they later relied on domesticated cattle to do this . Similarly , in Australasia the palm cockatoo feeds on undigested seeds from cassowary droppings . Yamashita suggested that the abundant Cylindraspis tortoises and dodos performed the same function on Mauritius , and that the broad @-@ billed parrot , with its macaw @-@ like beak , depended on them to obtain cleaned seeds . Many types of palms and palm @-@ like plants on Mauritius produce hard seeds that the broad @-@ billed parrot may have eaten , including <unk> <unk> , <unk> maxima , <unk> grandiflorum , Diospyros <unk> , and Pandanus <unk> . 
 On the basis of radiographs , D. T. Holyoak claimed that the mandible of the broad @-@ billed parrot was weakly constructed and suggested that it would have fed on soft fruits rather than hard seeds . As evidence , he pointed out that the internal trabeculae were widely spaced , that the upper bill was broad whereas the palatines were narrow , and the fact that no preserved upper rostrum had been discovered , which he attributed to its delicateness . G. A. Smith , however , pointed out that the four genera Holyoak used as examples of " strong jawed " parrots based on radiographs , <unk> , <unk> , Neophema and <unk> , actually have weak jaws in life , and that the morphologies cited by Holyoak do not indicate strength . Hume has since pointed out that the mandible morphology of the broad @-@ billed parrot is comparable to that of the largest living parrot , the hyacinth macaw , which cracks open palm nuts with ease . It is therefore probable that the broad @-@ billed parrot fed in the same manner . 
 = = Extinction = = 
 Though Mauritius had previously been visited by Arab vessels in the Middle Ages and Portuguese ships between 1507 and 1513 , they did not settle on the island . The Dutch Empire acquired the island in 1598 , renaming it after Maurice of Nassau , and it was used from then on for the provisioning of trade vessels of the Dutch East India Company . To the Dutch sailors who visited Mauritius from 1598 and onwards , the fauna was mainly interesting from a culinary standpoint . Of the eight or so parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes , only the echo parakeet ( Psittacula echo ) of Mauritius has survived . The others were likely all made extinct by a combination of excessive hunting and deforestation . 
 Because of its poor flying ability , large size and possible island tameness , the broad @-@ billed parrot was easy prey for sailors who visited Mauritius , and their nests would have been extremely vulnerable to predation by introduced crab @-@ eating macaques and rats . Various sources indicate the bird was aggressive , which may explain why it held out so long against introduced animals after all . The bird is believed to have become extinct by the 1680s , when the palms it may have sustained itself on were harvested on a large scale . Unlike other parrot species , which were often taken as pets by sailors , there are no records of broad @-@ billed parrots being transported from Mauritius either live or dead , perhaps because of the stigma associated with ravens .

 Pluto ( minor @-@ planet designation : 134340 Pluto ) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt , a ring of bodies beyond Neptune . It was the first Kuiper belt object to be discovered . It is the largest and second @-@ most @-@ massive known dwarf planet in the Solar System and the ninth @-@ largest and tenth @-@ most @-@ massive known object directly orbiting the Sun . It is the largest known trans @-@ Neptunian object by volume but is less massive than Eris , a dwarf planet in the scattered disc . Like other Kuiper belt objects , Pluto is primarily made of ice and rock and is relatively small — about one @-@ sixth the mass of the Moon and one @-@ third its volume . It has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit during which it ranges from 30 to 49 astronomical units or AU ( 4 @.@ 4 – 7 @.@ 4 billion km ) from the Sun . This means that Pluto periodically comes closer to the Sun than Neptune , but a stable orbital resonance with Neptune prevents them from colliding . Light from the Sun takes about 5 @.@ 5 hours to reach Pluto at its average distance ( 39 @.@ 5 AU ) . 
 Pluto was discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 , and was originally considered the ninth planet from the Sun . After 1992 , its planethood was questioned following the discovery of several objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt . In 2005 , Eris , which is 27 % more massive than Pluto , was discovered , which led the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) to define the term " planet " formally for the first time the following year . This definition excluded Pluto and reclassified it as a member of the new " dwarf planet " category . 
 Pluto has five known moons : Charon ( the largest , with a diameter just over half that of Pluto ) , Styx , Nix , Kerberos , and Hydra . Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a binary system because the barycenter of their orbits does not lie within either body . The IAU has not formalized a definition for binary dwarf planets , and Charon is officially classified as a moon of Pluto . 
 On July 14 , 2015 , the New Horizons spacecraft became the first spacecraft to fly by Pluto . During its brief flyby , New Horizons made detailed measurements and observations of Pluto and its moons .

 In the 1840s , Urbain Le Verrier used Newtonian mechanics to predict the position of the then @-@ undiscovered planet Neptune after analysing perturbations in the orbit of Uranus . Subsequent observations of Neptune in the late 19th century led astronomers to speculate that Uranus 's orbit was being disturbed by another planet besides Neptune . 
 In 1906 , Percival Lowell — a wealthy Bostonian who had founded the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff , Arizona , in 1894 — started an extensive project in search of a possible ninth planet , which he termed " Planet X " . By 1909 , Lowell and William H. Pickering had suggested several possible celestial coordinates for such a planet . Lowell and his observatory conducted his search until his death in 1916 , but to no avail . Unknown to Lowell , his surveys had captured two faint images of Pluto on March 19 and April 7 , 1915 , but they were not recognized for what they were . There are fourteen other known <unk> observations , with the oldest made by the Yerkes Observatory on August 20 , 1909 . 
 Percival 's widow , Constance Lowell , entered into a ten @-@ year legal battle with the Lowell Observatory over her late husband 's legacy , and the search for Planet X did not resume until 1929 . Vesto Melvin Slipher , the observatory director , summarily handed the job of locating Planet X to 23 @-@ year @-@ old Clyde Tombaugh , who had just arrived at the Lowell Observatory after Slipher had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical drawings . 
 Tombaugh 's task was to systematically image the night sky in pairs of photographs , then examine each pair and determine whether any objects had shifted position . Using a blink comparator , he rapidly shifted back and forth between views of each of the plates to create the illusion of movement of any objects that had changed position or appearance between photographs . On February 18 , 1930 , after nearly a year of searching , Tombaugh discovered a possible moving object on photographic plates taken on January 23 and 29 of that year . A lesser @-@ quality photograph taken on January 21 helped confirm the movement . After the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs , news of the discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13 , 1930 . 
 = = = Name = = = 
 The discovery made headlines around the globe . The Lowell Observatory , which had the right to name the new object , received more than 1 @,@ 000 suggestions from all over the world , ranging from Atlas to <unk> . Tombaugh urged Slipher to suggest a name for the new object quickly before someone else did . Constance Lowell proposed Zeus , then Percival and finally Constance . These suggestions were disregarded . 
 The name Pluto , after the god of the underworld , was proposed by Venetia Burney ( 1918 – 2009 ) , a then eleven @-@ year @-@ old schoolgirl in Oxford , England , who was interested in classical mythology . She suggested it in a conversation with her grandfather Falconer Madan , a former librarian at the University of Oxford 's Bodleian Library , who passed the name to astronomy professor Herbert Hall Turner , who cabled it to colleagues in the United States . 
 The object was officially named on May 25 , 1930 . Each member of the Lowell Observatory was allowed to vote on a short @-@ list of three : Minerva ( which was already the name for an asteroid ) , Cronus ( which had lost reputation through being proposed by the unpopular astronomer Thomas Jefferson Jackson See ) , and Pluto . Pluto received every vote . The name was announced on May 1 , 1930 . Upon the announcement , Madan gave Venetia £ 5 ( equivalent to 300 GBP , or 450 USD in 2014 ) as a reward . 
 The final choice of name was helped in part by the fact that the first two letters of Pluto are the initials of Percival Lowell . Pluto 's astronomical symbol ( , Unicode U + <unk> , <unk> ) was then created as a monogram constructed from the letters " PL " . Pluto 's astrological symbol resembles that of Neptune ( ) , but has a circle in place of the middle prong of the trident ( ) . 
 The name was soon embraced by wider culture . In 1930 , Walt Disney was apparently inspired by it when he introduced for Mickey Mouse a canine companion named Pluto , although Disney animator Ben Sharpsteen could not confirm why the name was given . In 1941 , Glenn T. Seaborg named the newly created element plutonium after Pluto , in keeping with the tradition of naming elements after newly discovered planets , following uranium , which was named after Uranus , and neptunium , which was named after Neptune . 
 Most languages use the name " Pluto " in various transliterations . In Japanese , Houei <unk> suggested the translation <unk> ( <unk> ? , " Star of the King ( God ) of the Underworld " ) , and this was borrowed into Chinese , Korean , and Vietnamese . Some Indian languages use the name Pluto , but others , such as Hindi , use the name of Yama , the Guardian of Hell in Hindu and Buddhist mythology . Polynesian languages also tend to use the indigenous god of the underworld , as in Maori <unk> . 
 = = = Planet X disproved = = = 
 Once found , Pluto 's faintness and lack of a resolvable disc cast doubt on the idea that it was Lowell 's Planet X. Estimates of Pluto 's mass were revised downward throughout the 20th century . 
 Astronomers initially calculated its mass based on its presumed effect on Neptune and Uranus . In 1931 , Pluto was calculated to be roughly the mass of Earth , with further calculations in 1948 bringing the mass down to roughly that of Mars . In 1976 , Dale Cruikshank , Carl Pilcher and David Morrison of the University of Hawaii calculated Pluto 's albedo for the first time , finding that it matched that for methane ice ; this meant Pluto had to be exceptionally luminous for its size and therefore could not be more than 1 percent the mass of Earth . ( Pluto 's albedo is 1 @.@ 4 – 1 @.@ 9 times greater than that of Earth . ) 
 In 1978 , the discovery of Pluto 's moon Charon allowed the measurement of Pluto 's mass for the first time : roughly 0 @.@ 2 % that of Earth , and far too small to account for the discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus . Subsequent searches for an alternative Planet X , notably by Robert Sutton Harrington , failed . In 1992 , Myles Standish used data from Voyager 2 's flyby of Neptune in 1989 , which had revised the estimates of Neptune 's mass downward by 0 @.@ 5 % — an amount comparable to the mass of Mars — to recalculate its gravitational effect on Uranus . With the new figures added in , the discrepancies , and with them the need for a Planet X , vanished . Today , the majority of scientists agree that Planet X , as Lowell defined it , does not exist . Lowell had made a prediction of Planet X 's orbit and position in 1915 that was fairly close to Pluto 's actual orbit and its position at that time ; Ernest W. Brown concluded soon after Pluto 's discovery that this was a coincidence , a view still held today . 
 = = = Classification = = = 
 From 1992 onward , many bodies were discovered orbiting in the same area as Pluto , showing that Pluto is part of a population of objects called the Kuiper belt . This made its official status as a planet controversial , with many questioning whether Pluto should be considered together with or separately from its surrounding population . Museum and planetarium directors occasionally created controversy by omitting Pluto from planetary models of the Solar System . The Hayden Planetarium reopened — in February 2000 , after renovation — with a model of only eight planets , which made headlines almost a year later . 
 As objects increasingly closer in size to Pluto were discovered in the region , it was argued that Pluto should be reclassified as one of the Kuiper belt objects , just as Ceres , Pallas , Juno and Vesta eventually lost their planet status after the discovery of many other asteroids . On July 29 , 2005 , astronomers at Caltech announced the discovery of a new trans @-@ Neptunian object , Eris , which was substantially more massive than Pluto and the most massive object discovered in the Solar System since Triton in 1846 . Its discoverers and the press initially called it the tenth planet , although there was no official consensus at the time on whether to call it a planet . Others in the astronomical community considered the discovery the strongest argument for reclassifying Pluto as a minor planet . 
 = = = = IAU classification = = = = 
 The debate came to a head on August 24 , 2006 with an IAU resolution that created an official definition for the term " planet " . According to this resolution , there are three main conditions for an object in the Solar System to be considered a planet : 
 The object must be in orbit around the Sun . 
 The object must be massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity . More specifically , its own gravity should pull it into a shape of hydrostatic equilibrium . 
 It must have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit . 
 Pluto fails to meet the third condition , because its mass is only 0 @.@ 07 times that of the mass of the other objects in its orbit ( Earth 's mass , by contrast , is 1 @.@ 7 million times the remaining mass in its own orbit ) . The IAU further decided that bodies that , like Pluto , meet criteria 1 and 2 but do not meet criterion 3 would be called dwarf planets . On September 13 , 2006 , the IAU included Pluto , and Eris and its moon Dysnomia , in their Minor Planet Catalogue , giving them the official minor planet designations " ( 134340 ) Pluto " , " ( 136199 ) Eris " , and " ( 136199 ) Eris I Dysnomia " . Had Pluto been included upon its discovery in 1930 , it would have likely been designated 1164 , following 1163 Saga , which was discovered a month earlier . 
 There has been some resistance within the astronomical community toward the reclassification . Alan Stern , principal investigator with NASA 's New Horizons mission to Pluto , publicly derided the IAU resolution , stating that " the definition stinks , for technical reasons " . Stern 's contention was that , by the terms of the new definition , Earth , Mars , Jupiter , and Neptune , all of which share their orbits with asteroids , would be excluded . He argued that all big spherical moons , including the Moon , should likewise be considered planets . His other claim was that because less than five percent of astronomers voted for it , the decision was not representative of the entire astronomical community . Marc W. <unk> , then at Lowell Observatory , voiced his opinion on the new definition on his website and petitioned against the definition . Others have supported the IAU . Mike Brown , the astronomer who discovered Eris , said " through this whole crazy circus @-@ like procedure , somehow the right answer was stumbled on . It 's been a long time coming . Science is self @-@ correcting eventually , even when strong emotions are involved . " 
 Public reception to the IAU decision was mixed . Although many accepted the reclassification , some sought to overturn the decision with online petitions urging the IAU to consider reinstatement . A resolution introduced by some members of the California State Assembly facetiously called the IAU decision a " scientific heresy " . The New Mexico House of Representatives passed a resolution in honor of Tombaugh , a longtime resident of that state , that declared that Pluto will always be considered a planet while in New Mexican skies and that March 13 , 2007 , was Pluto Planet Day . The Illinois Senate passed a similar resolution in 2009 , on the basis that Clyde Tombaugh , the discoverer of Pluto , was born in Illinois . The resolution asserted that Pluto was " unfairly downgraded to a ' dwarf ' planet " by the IAU . Some members of the public have also rejected the change , citing the disagreement within the scientific community on the issue , or for sentimental reasons , maintaining that they have always known Pluto as a planet and will continue to do so regardless of the IAU decision . 
 In 2006 , in its 17th annual words of the year vote , the American Dialect Society voted plutoed as the word of the year . To " pluto " is to " demote or devalue someone or something " . 
 Researchers on both sides of the debate gathered on August 14 – 16 , 2008 , at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory for a conference that included back @-@ to @-@ back talks on the current IAU definition of a planet . Entitled " The Great Planet Debate " , the conference published a post @-@ conference press release indicating that scientists could not come to a consensus about the definition of planet . Just before the conference , on June 11 , 2008 , the IAU announced in a press release that the term " plutoid " would henceforth be used to refer to Pluto and other objects that have an orbital semi @-@ major axis greater than that of Neptune and enough mass to be of near @-@ spherical shape . 
 = = Orbit = = 
 Pluto 's orbital period is 248 years . Its orbital characteristics are substantially different from those of the planets , which follow nearly circular orbits around the Sun close to a flat reference plane called the ecliptic . In contrast , Pluto 's orbit is moderately inclined relative to the ecliptic ( over 17 ° ) and moderately eccentric ( elliptical ) . This eccentricity means a small region of Pluto 's orbit lies nearer the Sun than Neptune 's . The Pluto – Charon barycenter came to perihelion on September 5 , 1989 , and was last closer to the Sun than Neptune between February 7 , 1979 , and February 11 , 1999 . 
 In the long term , Pluto 's orbit is chaotic . Although computer simulations can be used to predict its position for several million years ( both forward and backward in time ) , after intervals longer than the Lyapunov time of 10 – 20 million years , calculations become speculative : Pluto is sensitive to immeasurably small details of the Solar System , hard @-@ to @-@ predict factors that will gradually change Pluto 's position in its orbit . 
 = = = Relationship with Neptune = = = 
 Despite Pluto 's orbit appearing to cross that of Neptune when viewed from directly above , the two objects ' orbits are aligned so that they can never collide or even approach closely . There are several reasons why . 
 At the simplest level , one can examine the two orbits and see that they do not intersect . When Pluto is closest to the Sun , and hence closest to Neptune 's orbit as viewed from above , it is also the farthest above Neptune 's path . Pluto 's orbit passes about 8 AU above that of Neptune , preventing a collision . Pluto 's ascending and descending nodes , the points at which its orbit crosses the ecliptic , are currently separated from Neptune 's by over 21 ° . 
 This alone is not enough to protect Pluto ; perturbations from the planets ( especially Neptune ) could alter aspects of Pluto 's orbit ( such as its orbital precession ) over millions of years so that a collision could be possible . Some other mechanism or mechanisms must therefore be at work . The most significant of these is that Pluto lies in the 2 : 3 mean @-@ motion resonance with Neptune : for every two orbits that Pluto makes around the Sun , Neptune makes three . The two objects then return to their initial positions and the cycle repeats , each cycle lasting about 500 years . This pattern is such that , in each 500 @-@ year cycle , the first time Pluto is near perihelion , Neptune is over 50 ° behind Pluto . By Pluto 's second perihelion , Neptune will have completed a further one and a half of its own orbits , and so will be a similar distance ahead of Pluto . Pluto and Neptune 's minimum separation is over 17 AU , which is greater than Pluto 's minimum separation from Uranus ( 11 AU ) . 
 The 2 : 3 resonance between the two bodies is highly stable , and is preserved over millions of years . This prevents their orbits from changing relative to one another ; the cycle always repeats in the same way , and so the two bodies can never pass near each other . Thus , even if Pluto 's orbit were not inclined , the two bodies could never collide . 
 = = = = Other factors = = = = 
 Numerical studies have shown that over periods of millions of years , the general nature of the alignment between the orbits of Pluto and Neptune does not change . There are several other resonances and interactions that govern the details of their relative motion , and enhance Pluto 's stability . These arise principally from two additional mechanisms ( besides the 2 : 3 mean @-@ motion resonance ) . 
 First , Pluto 's argument of perihelion , the angle between the point where it crosses the ecliptic and the point where it is closest to the Sun , <unk> around 90 ° . This means that when Pluto is closest to the Sun , it is at its farthest above the plane of the Solar System , preventing encounters with Neptune . This is a direct consequence of the Kozai mechanism , which relates the eccentricity of an orbit to its inclination to a larger perturbing body — in this case Neptune . Relative to Neptune , the amplitude of libration is 38 ° , and so the angular separation of Pluto 's perihelion to the orbit of Neptune is always greater than 52 ° ( 90 ° – 38 ° ) . The closest such angular separation occurs every 10 @,@ 000 years . 
 Second , the longitudes of ascending nodes of the two bodies — the points where they cross the ecliptic — are in near @-@ resonance with the above libration . When the two longitudes are the same — that is , when one could draw a straight line through both nodes and the Sun — Pluto 's perihelion lies exactly at 90 ° , and hence it comes closest to the Sun when it is highest above Neptune 's orbit . This is known as the 1 : 1 <unk> . All the Jovian planets , particularly Jupiter , play a role in the creation of the <unk> . 
 To understand the nature of the libration , imagine a polar point of view , looking down on the ecliptic from a distant vantage point where the planets orbit counterclockwise . After passing the ascending node , Pluto is interior to Neptune 's orbit and moving faster , approaching Neptune from behind . The strong gravitational pull between the two causes angular momentum to be transferred to Pluto , at Neptune 's expense . This moves Pluto into a slightly larger orbit , where it travels slightly more slowly , according to Kepler 's third law . As its orbit changes , this has the gradual effect of changing the perihelion and longitude of Pluto 's orbit ( and , to a lesser degree , of Neptune ) . After many such repetitions , Pluto is sufficiently slowed , and Neptune sufficiently speeded up , that Neptune begins to catch up with Pluto at the opposite side of its orbit ( near the opposing node to where we began ) . The process is then reversed , and Pluto loses angular momentum to Neptune , until Pluto is sufficiently speeded up that it begins to catch Neptune again at the original node . The whole process takes about 20 @,@ 000 years to complete . 
 = = = Quasi @-@ satellite = = = 
 In 2012 , it was hypothesized that ( <unk> ) 1994 JR1 could be a quasi @-@ satellite of Pluto , a specific type of co @-@ orbital configuration . According to the hypothesis , the object would be a quasi @-@ satellite of Pluto for about 350 @,@ 000 years out of every two @-@ million @-@ year period . This hypothesis was disproven in 2016 , when more @-@ accurate observations of the position of 1994 JR1 were made by New Horizons . 
 = = Rotation = = 
 Pluto 's rotation period , its day , is equal to 6 @.@ 39 Earth days . Like Uranus , Pluto rotates on its " side " on its orbital plane , with an axial tilt of 120 ° , and so its seasonal variation is extreme ; at its solstices , one @-@ fourth of its surface is in continuous daylight , whereas another fourth is in continuous darkness . 
 The amount of light from the Sun on Pluto is weak , analogous to twilight on Earth . NASA has posted a " Pluto Time " calculator that determines when the light on Earth is equivalent to that on Pluto on a clear day . For example , on July 13 , 2015 , at the coordinates of the Applied Physics Laboratory where the probe was constructed , the Pluto Time was 8 : 38 p.m. , four minutes later than the apparent sunset of 8 : 34 p.m. reported for that location by NOAA . 
 = = Geology = = 
 Due to Pluto 's distance from Earth , in @-@ depth study from Earth is difficult . On July 14 , 2015 , NASA 's New Horizons space probe flew through the Pluto system , and the information it gathered will be transmitted to Earth until late 2016 . 
 = = = Surface = = = 
 Pluto 's surface is composed of more than 98 percent nitrogen ice , with traces of methane and carbon monoxide . Nitrogen and carbon monoxide are most abundant on the anti @-@ Charon face of Pluto ( around 180 ° longitude , where Tombaugh Regio 's western lobe , Sputnik Planum , is located ) , whereas methane is most abundant near 300 ° east . Pluto 's surface is quite varied , with large differences in both brightness and color . Pluto is one of the most contrastive bodies in the Solar System , with as much contrast as Saturn 's moon Iapetus . The color varies between charcoal black , dark orange and white . Pluto 's color is more similar to that of Io with slightly more orange , significantly less red than Mars . Notable geographical features include Tombaugh Regio , or the " Heart " ( a large bright area on the side opposite Charon ) , Cthulhu Regio , or the " Whale " ( a large dark area on the trailing hemisphere ) , and the " Brass Knuckles " ( a series of equatorial dark areas on the leading hemisphere ) . Sputnik Planum , the western lobe of the " Heart " , is a 1000 @-@ km @-@ wide plain of frozen nitrogen and carbon monoxide ices , divided into polygonal cells which are interpreted as convection cells that carry floating blocks of water ice crust and sublimation pits towards their margins ; there are obvious signs of glacial flows both into and out of the plain . It has no craters that were visible to New Horizons , indicating that its surface is less than 10 million years old . The New Horizons science team summarized initial findings as " Pluto displays a surprisingly wide variety of geological landforms , including those resulting from <unk> and surface – atmosphere interactions as well as impact , tectonic , possible cryovolcanic , and mass @-@ wasting processes . " 
 = = = Internal structure = = = 
 Pluto 's density is 1 @.@ 860 ± 0 @.@ 013 g / cm3 . Because the decay of radioactive elements would eventually heat the ices enough for the rock to separate from them , scientists expect that Pluto 's internal structure is differentiated , with the rocky material having settled into a dense core surrounded by a mantle of water ice . The diameter of the core is hypothesized to be approximately 1700 km , 70 % of Pluto 's diameter . It is possible that such heating continues today , creating a subsurface ocean of liquid water some 100 to 180 km thick at the core – mantle boundary . 
 = = Mass and size = = 
 Pluto 's diameter is 2374 ± 8 km and its mass is ( 1 @.@ 303 ± 0 @.@ 003 ) × 1022 kg , 17 @.@ 7 % that of the Moon ( 0 @.@ 22 % that of Earth ) . Its surface area is 1 @.@ 665 × 107 km2 , or roughly the same surface area as Russia . Its surface gravity is 0 @.@ 063 g ( compared to 1 g for Earth ) . 
 The discovery of Pluto 's satellite Charon in 1978 enabled a determination of the mass of the Pluto – Charon system by application of Newton 's formulation of Kepler 's third law . Observations of Pluto in occultation with Charon allowed scientists to establish Pluto 's diameter more accurately , whereas the invention of adaptive optics allowed them to determine its shape more accurately . 
 With less than 0 @.@ 2 lunar masses , Pluto is much less massive than the terrestrial planets , and also less massive than seven moons : Ganymede , Titan , Callisto , Io , the Moon , Europa , and Triton . The mass is much less than thought before Charon was discovered . 
 Pluto is more than twice the diameter and a dozen times the mass of the dwarf planet Ceres , the largest object in the asteroid belt . It is less massive than the dwarf planet Eris , a trans @-@ Neptunian object discovered in 2005 , though Pluto has a larger diameter of 2374 km compared to Eris 's approximate diameter of 2326 km . 
 Determinations of Pluto 's size had been complicated by its atmosphere , and hydrocarbon haze . In March 2014 , <unk> , de Bergh et al. published findings regarding methane mixing ratios in Pluto 's atmosphere consistent with a Plutonian diameter greater than 2360 km , with a " best guess " of 2368 km . On July 13 , 2015 , images from NASA 's New Horizons mission Long Range Reconnaissance Imager ( <unk> ) , along with data from the other instruments , determined Pluto 's diameter to be 2 @,@ 370 km ( 1 @,@ 470 mi ) , which was later revised to be 2 @,@ 372 km ( 1 @,@ 474 mi ) on July 24 , and later to 2374 ± 8 km . 
 = = Atmosphere = = 
 Pluto has a tenuous atmosphere consisting of nitrogen ( N2 ) , methane ( CH4 ) , and carbon monoxide ( CO ) , which are in equilibrium with their ices on Pluto 's surface . According to the measurements by New Horizons , the surface pressure is about 1 Pa ( 10 μbar ) , roughly one million to 100 @,@ 000 times less than Earth 's atmospheric pressure . It was initially thought that , as Pluto moves away from the Sun , its atmosphere should gradually freeze onto the surface ; however , studies of New Horizons data and ground @-@ based occultations show that Pluto 's atmospheric density actually increases , and that it likely remains gaseous throughout Pluto 's orbit . New Horizons observations showed that atmospheric escape of nitrogen to be 10 @,@ 000 times less than expected . Alan Stern has contended that even a small increase in Pluto 's surface temperature can lead to exponential increases in Pluto 's atmospheric density ; from 18 to as much as 280 millibars ( three times that of Mars to a quarter that of the Earth ) . At such densities , nitrogen could flow across the surface as liquid . Just like sweat cools the body as it evaporates from the skin , the sublimation of Pluto 's atmosphere cools its surface . The presence of atmospheric gases was traced up to 1670 kilometers high , although the atmosphere does not have a sharp upper boundary . 
 The presence of methane , a powerful greenhouse gas , in Pluto 's atmosphere creates a temperature inversion , with the average temperature of its atmosphere tens of degrees warmer than its surface , though observations by New Horizons have revealed Pluto 's upper atmosphere to be far colder than expected ( 70 K , as opposed to about 100 K ) . Pluto 's atmosphere is divided into roughly 20 regularly spaced haze layers up to 150 km high , thought to be the result of pressure waves created by airflow across Pluto 's mountains . 
 = = Satellites = = 
 Pluto has five known natural satellites : Charon , first identified in 1978 by astronomer James Christy ; Nix and Hydra , both discovered in 2005 ; Kerberos , discovered in 2011 ; and Styx , discovered in 2012 . The satellites ' orbits are circular ( eccentricity < 0 @.@ 006 ) and coplanar with Pluto 's equator ( inclination < 1 ° ) , and therefore tilted approximately 120 ° relative to Pluto 's orbit . The Plutonian system is highly compact : the five known satellites orbit within the inner 3 % of the region where prograde orbits would be stable . Closest to Pluto is Charon , which is large enough to be in hydrostatic equilibrium and to cause the barycenter of the Pluto – Charon system to be outside Pluto . Beyond Charon there are four much smaller circumbinary moons , Styx , Nix , Kerberos , and Hydra . 
 The orbital periods of all Pluto 's moons are linked in a system of orbital resonances and near resonances . When precession is accounted for , the orbital periods of Styx , Nix , and Hydra are in an exact 18 : 22 : 33 ratio . There is a sequence of approximate ratios , 3 : 4 : 5 : 6 , between the periods of Styx , Nix , Kerberos , and Hydra with that of Charon ; the ratios become closer to being exact the further out the moons are . 
 The Pluto – Charon system is one of the few in the Solar System whose barycenter lies outside the primary body ; 617 Patroclus is a smaller example , and the Sun – Jupiter system is the only larger one . The similar sizes of Charon and Pluto has prompted some astronomers to call it a double dwarf planet . The system is also unusual among planetary systems in that each is tidally locked to the other , which means that Pluto and Charon always have the same hemisphere facing each other . From any position on either body , the other is always at the same position in the sky , or always obscured . This also means that the rotation period of each is equal to the time it takes the entire system to rotate around its barycenter . 
 In 2007 , observations by the Gemini Observatory of patches of ammonia hydrates and water crystals on the surface of Charon suggested the presence of active cryo @-@ geysers . 
 Pluto 's moons are hypothesized to have been formed by a collision between Pluto and a similar @-@ sized body , early in the history of the Solar System . The collision released material that consolidated into the moons around Pluto . However , Kerberos has a much lower albedo than the other moons of Pluto , which is difficult to explain with a giant collision . 
 = = Origin = = 
 Pluto 's origin and identity had long puzzled astronomers . One early hypothesis was that Pluto was an escaped moon of Neptune , knocked out of orbit by its largest current moon , Triton . This idea was eventually rejected after dynamical studies showed it to be impossible because Pluto never approaches Neptune in its orbit . 
 Pluto 's true place in the Solar System began to reveal itself only in 1992 , when astronomers began to find small icy objects beyond Neptune that were similar to Pluto not only in orbit but also in size and composition . This trans @-@ Neptunian population is thought to be the source of many short @-@ period comets . Pluto is now known to be the largest member of the Kuiper belt , a stable belt of objects located between 30 and 50 AU from the Sun . As of 2011 , surveys of the Kuiper belt to magnitude 21 were nearly complete and any remaining Pluto @-@ sized objects are expected to be beyond 100 AU from the Sun . Like other Kuiper @-@ belt objects ( KBOs ) , Pluto shares features with comets ; for example , the solar wind is gradually blowing Pluto 's surface into space . It has been claimed that if Pluto were placed as near to the Sun as Earth , it would develop a tail , as comets do . This claim has been disputed with the argument that Pluto 's escape velocity is too high for this to happen . 
 Though Pluto is the largest Kuiper belt object discovered , Neptune 's moon Triton , which is slightly larger than Pluto , is similar to it both geologically and atmospherically , and is thought to be a captured Kuiper belt object . Eris ( see above ) is about the same size as Pluto ( though more massive ) but is not strictly considered a member of the Kuiper belt population . Rather , it is considered a member of a linked population called the scattered disc . 
 A large number of Kuiper belt objects , like Pluto , are in a 2 : 3 orbital resonance with Neptune . KBOs with this orbital resonance are called " plutinos " , after Pluto . 
 Like other members of the Kuiper belt , Pluto is thought to be a residual planetesimal ; a component of the original protoplanetary disc around the Sun that failed to fully coalesce into a full @-@ fledged planet . Most astronomers agree that Pluto owes its current position to a sudden migration undergone by Neptune early in the Solar System 's formation . As Neptune migrated outward , it approached the objects in the proto @-@ Kuiper belt , setting one in orbit around itself ( Triton ) , locking others into resonances , and knocking others into chaotic orbits . The objects in the scattered disc , a dynamically unstable region overlapping the Kuiper belt , are thought to have been placed in their current positions by interactions with Neptune 's migrating resonances . A computer model created in 2004 by Alessandro Morbidelli of the Observatoire de la Côte d 'Azur in Nice suggested that the migration of Neptune into the Kuiper belt may have been triggered by the formation of a 1 : 2 resonance between Jupiter and Saturn , which created a gravitational push that propelled both Uranus and Neptune into higher orbits and caused them to switch places , ultimately doubling Neptune 's distance from the Sun . The resultant expulsion of objects from the proto @-@ Kuiper belt could also explain the Late Heavy Bombardment 600 million years after the Solar System 's formation and the origin of the Jupiter trojans . It is possible that Pluto had a near @-@ circular orbit about 33 AU from the Sun before Neptune 's migration perturbed it into a resonant capture . The Nice model requires that there were about a thousand Pluto @-@ sized bodies in the original planetesimal disk , which included Triton and Eris .

 Pluto 's distance from Earth makes its in @-@ depth study and exploration difficult . On July 14 , 2015 , NASA 's New Horizons space probe flew through the Pluto system , providing much information about it . 
 = = = Observation = = = 
 Pluto 's visual apparent magnitude averages 15 @.@ 1 , brightening to 13 @.@ 65 at perihelion . To see it , a telescope is required ; around 30 cm ( 12 in ) aperture being desirable . It looks star @-@ like and without a visible disk even in large telescopes , because its angular diameter is only 0 @.@ 11 " . 
 The earliest maps of Pluto , made in the late 1980s , were brightness maps created from close observations of eclipses by its largest moon , Charon . Observations were made of the change in the total average brightness of the Pluto – Charon system during the eclipses . For example , eclipsing a bright spot on Pluto makes a bigger total brightness change than eclipsing a dark spot . Computer processing of many such observations can be used to create a brightness map . This method can also track changes in brightness over time . 
 Better maps were produced from images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) , which offered higher resolution , and showed considerably more detail , resolving variations several hundred kilometers across , including polar regions and large bright spots . These maps were produced by complex computer processing , which finds the best @-@ fit projected maps for the few pixels of the Hubble images . These remained the most detailed maps of Pluto until the flyby of New Horizons in July 2015 , because the two cameras on the HST used for these maps were no longer in service . 
 = = = Exploration = = = 
 The New Horizons spacecraft , which flew by Pluto in July 2015 , is the first and so far only attempt to explore Pluto directly . Launched in 2006 , it captured its first ( distant ) images of Pluto in late September 2006 during a test of the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager . The images , taken from a distance of approximately 4 @.@ 2 billion kilometers , confirmed the spacecraft 's ability to track distant targets , critical for maneuvering toward Pluto and other Kuiper belt objects . In early 2007 the craft made use of a gravity assist from Jupiter . 
 New Horizons made its closest approach to Pluto on July 14 , 2015 after a 3 @,@ 462 @-@ day journey across the Solar System . Scientific observations of Pluto began five months before the closest approach and continued for at least a month after the encounter . Observations were conducted using a remote sensing package that included imaging instruments and a radio science investigation tool , as well as spectroscopic and other experiments . The scientific goals of New Horizons were to characterize the global geology and morphology of Pluto and its moon Charon , map their surface composition , and analyze Pluto 's neutral atmosphere and its escape rate .

 = Tim Donaghy = 
 Tim Donaghy ( / <unk> / ; born January 7 , 1967 ) is a former professional basketball referee who worked in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) for 13 seasons , from 1994 to 2007 . During his career in the NBA , Donaghy officiated in 772 regular season games and 20 playoff games . 
 Donaghy resigned from the league on July 9 , 2007 before reports of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) for allegations that he bet on games that he officiated during his last two seasons and that he made calls affecting the point spread in those games . On August 15 , 2007 , Donaghy pleaded guilty to two federal charges related to the investigation . However , he could face more charges at the state level if it is determined that he deliberately miscalled individual games . Donaghy was sentenced to 15 months in federal prison on July 29 , 2008 . He served 11 months in a federal prison camp in Pensacola , Florida to spend the remainder of his sentence in a halfway house , but was sent back to prison in August for violating his release terms . He was released on November 4 , 2009 after serving out his sentence . 
 = = Personal = = 
 Born in the Philadelphia suburb Havertown , Pennsylvania , Donaghy attended Cardinal O 'Hara High School in Springfield , Pennsylvania along with three other NBA referees : Joe Crawford , Mike Callahan , and Ed Malloy . In 1989 , Donaghy graduated from Villanova University with a degree in sales and marketing . While at Villanova , he played on the school 's baseball team . According to the National Basketball Referee 's Association , Donaghy participated and earned All @-@ Catholic and All @-@ Delaware County honors in baseball and All @-@ Delaware County honors in basketball during high school , but then – Villanova baseball coach George Bennett contends that Donaghy did not play on the varsity team and that no records indicate that he was selected to the All @-@ Catholic team in baseball or named to the All @-@ Delaware County basketball team . Donaghy and his wife Kimberly had four daughters before terminating their 12 @-@ year marriage in 2007 . 
 = = Officiating career = = 
 Before officiating in the NBA , Donaghy spent five years working Pennsylvania high school games and seven seasons in the Continental Basketball Association ( CBA ) , and he was the head official for the 1993 CBA All @-@ Star Game . The following year , he joined the NBA , where he worked for 13 years , officiating in 772 regular @-@ season games and 20 playoff games . Donaghy was a participant in the NBA 's Read to Achieve program , for which he participated in an event at the Universal Charter school during the 2002 NBA Finals . His uniform number was 21 . 
 Donaghy was one of three referees who worked the Pacers – Pistons brawl at The Palace of Auburn Hills on November 19 , 2004 , which ended in a fight between Pacers players and Pistons fans . 
 Donaghy was involved in another controversial incident in 2003 , when he called a technical foul on Rasheed Wallace , then playing with the Portland Trail Blazers , for allegedly throwing a ball at another official during a game played at the Rose Garden Arena in Portland , Oregon . While Donaghy was leaving the arena , Wallace confronted him at the arena 's loading dock , where he screamed obscenities at Donaghy . Donaghy claimed that Wallace threatened him , and after an investigation by the NBA , Wallace was suspended for seven games ; this was the longest suspension issued by the league for an incident not involving violence or drugs . 
 = = Betting scandal = = 
 On July 20 , 2007 , columnist Murray Weiss of the New York Post reported an investigation by the FBI into allegations of an NBA referee betting on games to control the point spread . It was revealed that Donaghy , who has a gambling problem , placed tens of thousands of dollars in bets on games during the 2005 – 06 and 2006 – 07 season and had been approached by low @-@ level mob associates to work on a gambling scheme . Mike <unk> of The Stephen A. Smith Show suggested that Donaghy had gotten himself into debt and tried to make it up by betting on games . 
 The report sent shock waves through the NBA . While the league devotes significant resources to monitor officials ' performance , it only found out about the affair when the FBI stumbled upon Donaghy in the midst of a broader organized crime investigation . NBA Commissioner David Stern said in a statement , " We would like to assure our fans that no amount of effort , time or personnel is being spared to assist in this investigation , to bring to justice an individual who has betrayed the most sacred trust in professional sports , and to take the necessary steps to protect against this ever happening again . " He called the scandal a " wakeup call that says you can 't be complacent " . 
 Sports gambling expert R. J. Bell , president of sports betting information site <unk> , tracked every game Donaghy worked from 2003 to 2007 . He discovered that during the two seasons investigated by the NBA , the teams involved scored more points than expected by the Las Vegas sports books 57 % of the time . In the previous two seasons , this only happened 44 % of the time . According to Bell , the odds of such a discrepancy are 1 in 1 @,@ 000 , and there was " a 99 @.@ 9 % chance that these results would not have happened without an outside factor " . He also found 10 straight games in 2007 in which Donaghy worked the game that the point spread moved 1 @.@ 5 points or more before the tip — an indication that big money had been wagered on the game . The big money won every time — another indication that " something ( was ) going on " . However , Bell suggested that there was no way anyone who wasn 't in on the fix could have known that something was amiss about Donaghy 's actions during a game ; he said it would have been another year at the earliest before anyone could have caught on . 
 Handicapper Brandon Lang told ESPN that it is fairly easy for a crooked sports official to fix a game , despite Stern 's insistence that Donaghy was a " rogue official " . According to Lang , an official can directly influence the outcome of a game 75 % of the time if he has money on the game . Lang also believed that a bookie connected to the mob turned Donaghy in to the FBI . 
 On July 27 , U.S. Congressman Bobby Rush of Illinois , chairman of the Energy and Commerce Commerce , Trade and Consumer Protection Subcommittee , asked to meet with Stern regarding the Donaghy matter . In a letter to Stern , Rush indicated that he might call a hearing " should the facts warrant public scrutiny . " He also said that the affair could potentially be " one of the most damaging scandals in the history of American sports " . 
 Earlier in the day , federal sources told the New York Daily News that Donaghy would surrender to the FBI and pleaded guilty to gambling charges . The Daily News also learned that the bookies in the scandal were two high school classmates of Donaghy 's who embellished their mob ties . The Daily News reported that at his friends ' request , Donaghy passed word about the crews working the games they planned to bet on . The Associated Press identified one of the men as James Battista , former owner of a sports bar in Havertown , Pennsylvania ; a Philadelphia suburb . Battista 's lawyer told the AP that his client expected to be indicted . 
 At his home in Bradenton , Donaghy did not initially comment on his situation . He reportedly claimed to be " the butler " to visiting reporters and turned his sprinklers on a freelance photographer for the New York Times when he got too close . His wife ( at the time ) , Kimberly , passed a note to reporters telling them not to bother asking them any questions . 
 On August 15 , Donaghy appeared in a Brooklyn federal court and pleaded guilty to conspiracy to engage in wire fraud and transmitting wagering information through interstate commerce . Donaghy told U.S. District Judge Carol Bagley Amon that he used coded language to tip Battista about players ' physical condition and player / referee relations . In doing so , Donaghy disclosed classified information that he obtained as an NBA referee . Donaghy initially received $ 2 @,@ 000 per correct pick , but his calls were so accurate that Battista increased his take to $ 5 @,@ 000 . In total , he received $ 30 @,@ 000 to pass inside information to the bookies . Another high school friend of Donaghy 's , Thomas Martino , acted as the middle man . Donaghy also admitted that he had a severe gambling addiction , for which he was taking antidepressants . 
 Donaghy specifically admitted to passing information about two games during the 2006 – 07 season . Prosecutors also said that Donaghy bet on games himself . Donaghy was fined $ 500 @,@ 000 , and will also have to pay at least $ 30 @,@ 000 in restitution . ESPN legal analyst Lester Munson believes that Battista is one of the FBI 's prime targets , based on the large amounts of money he bet . 
 Donaghy was released on a $ 250 @,@ 000 bond and awaited sentencing on January 25 , 2008 . On June 19 , 2008 , the NBA filed a demand that Donaghy reimburse the league for the costs of his airfare and meals , complimentary game tickets , and other expenses , including $ 750 in shoes . Donaghy 's lawyer said that this was the league trying to retaliate against Donaghy for his misconduct . A judge delayed sentencing to allow for more time to decide how much restitution Donaghy and two co @-@ conspirators should pay the NBA for their roles in the betting scandal . The NBA has claimed Donaghy owes it $ 1 @.@ 4 million , including $ 577 @,@ 000 of his pay and benefits over four seasons , plus hefty legal fees and other expenses related to an internal investigation . His lawyer has argued that the punishment should apply to only one season — a position supported by the government in court papers . 
 According to the Associated Press , Andrew Thomas , the former county attorney for Maricopa County , Arizona , asked the NBA and FBI if Donaghy intentionally miscalled two Phoenix Suns road playoff games . The games in question occurred on April 29 , 2007 versus the Los Angeles Lakers and May 12 , 2007 versus the San Antonio Spurs . In a letter to Stern and FBI director Robert Mueller , Thomas said that Donaghy 's conduct may have violated Arizona criminal law , and could face charges there . Per the United States Supreme Court 's decision in Ponzi v. Fessenden , federal plea bargains have no standing regarding state charges . 
 = = = Allegations against the NBA = = = 
 On June 10 , 2008 , Donaghy 's attorney filed a court document alleging , among other things , that Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Sacramento Kings was fixed by two referees . The letter states that Donaghy " learned from Referee A that Referees A and F wanted to extend the series to seven games . Tim knew Referees A and F to be ' company men ' , always acting in the interest of the NBA , and that night , it was in the NBA 's interest to add another game to the series . " The Lakers won Game 6 , attempting 18 more free throws than the Kings in the fourth quarter , and went on to win the 2002 NBA Finals . The teams were not named , but the Western Conference Finals was the only seven @-@ game series that year . The document claimed that Donaghy told federal agents that to increase television ratings and ticket sales , " top executives of the NBA sought to manipulate games using referees " . It also said that NBA officials would tell referees to not call technical fouls on certain players , and states that a referee was privately reprimanded by the league for ejecting a star player in the first quarter of a January 2000 game . Stern denied the accusations , calling Donaghy a " singing , cooperating witness " .

 On July 29 , 2008 , Donaghy was sentenced in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York to 15 months in prison for his participation in the gambling scandal . Donaghy could have faced up to 33 months , but Judge Carol Amon reduced his sentence to 15 months ( two 15 @-@ month terms served concurrently , followed by 3 years of supervised release ) in exchange for his cooperation . His lawyer , John Lauro , asked for probation , but the request was denied . Donaghy apologized in court , saying " I brought shame on myself , my family and the profession . " Battista and Martino were sentenced earlier that month , earning sentences of 15 months and 366 days , respectively . 
 = = = Effect on the NBA = = = 
 As a result of the betting scandal , Stern revised the guidelines on the behavior of NBA referees during the Board of Governors ' meeting in 2007 . Despite the labor agreement for referees , which restricted them from participating in almost all forms of gambling , it was revealed that about half of the NBA 's officials had made bets in casinos , albeit not with sportsbooks . In addition , all referees had admitted to engaging in some form of gambling . Stern stated that " [ the ] ban on gambling is absolute , and in my view it is too absolute , too harsh and was not particularly well @-@ enforced over the years " . The gambling rules were revised to allow referees to engage in several forms of betting — though not on sports . There were several other referee @-@ related rule changes made : the announcement of referees of a game was moved from 90 minutes before tip @-@ off to the morning of the game , to reduce the value of the information to gamblers ; referees received more in @-@ season training and counseling on gambling ; more thorough background checks were carried out ; the league declared its intention to analyze the statistical relationship between NBA games and referees ' gambling patterns for those games ; and the interactions between referees and NBA teams were made easier and more formal .

 In the federal prison camp in Pensacola , Florida , Donaghy started to write his memoir , Blowing the Whistle : The Culture of Fraud in the NBA . The book was to have covered his NBA career , described his dealings with the " underworld " during the betting scandal , and explained how he would determine the winning team in the games he refereed . Donaghy also promised to " discuss the relationship that players , coaches and referees have with each other " . The book was due to be published in October 2009 . However , Donaghy 's publisher , Triumph Books , canceled it because of liability concerns . Pat Berdan , Donaghy 's liaison with Triumph , said the book was canceled after the NBA threatened legal action — which the NBA denies . Donaghy found a new publisher , VTi @-@ Group , willing to release the book , which was renamed Personal Foul : A First @-@ Person Account of the Scandal That Rocked the NBA . The book was released in December 2009 . 
 During his imprisonment , Donaghy was attacked and threatened . In November 2007 , a man claiming to be an associate of the New York Mafia struck Donaghy with a paint roller extension bar , resulting in injuries to his knee and leg which required surgery . 
 Donaghy was released from prison after serving 11 months and was due to finish his sentence in a recovery house near Tampa , Florida , where he will be treated for his gambling addiction as mandated by the court . He was arrested and put in the county jail in late August after being caught at a health club without permission , when he should have been at work . His lawyer and his ex @-@ wife both insisted that Donaghy should not have been taken into custody , as he was allowed to visit the center to rehabilitate his injured knee . 
 On November 4 , 2009 , Donaghy was released from prison in Hernando County after serving out the remainder of his sentence . 
 Donaghy sued VTi @-@ Group , the publisher of his memoir , for not paying him . In June 2012 , a jury found VTi liable for breach of contract . Donaghy was awarded $ 1 @.@ 3 million . 
 On April 22 , 2014 , Donaghy claimed that the league office was going to push referees to fix playoffs games to have Brooklyn Nets beat the Toronto Raptors , so they could advance to the second round and face the Miami Heat because it would be good for ratings , which it was . On May 4 , 2014 , the Nets eliminated the Raptors after winning game seven of the series by a point . 
 = Hugh Nonant = 
 Hugh Nonant ( sometimes Hugh de Nonant ; died 27 March 1198 ) was a medieval Bishop of Coventry in England . A great @-@ nephew and nephew of two Bishops of Lisieux , he held the office of archdeacon in that diocese before serving successively Thomas Becket , the Archbishop of Canterbury and King Henry II of England . Diplomatic successes earned him the nomination to Coventry , but diplomatic missions after his elevation led to a long delay before he was consecrated . After King Henry 's death , Nonant served Henry 's son , King Richard I , who rewarded him with the office of sheriff in three counties . Nonant replaced his monastic cathedral chapter with secular clergy , and attempted to persuade his fellow bishops to do the same , but was unsuccessful . When King Richard was captured and held for ransom , Nonant supported Prince John 's efforts to seize power in England , but had to purchase Richard 's favour when the king returned . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Nonant was a great @-@ nephew of John , Bishop of Lisieux , who had been the chief deputy in Normandy of King Henry I of England , and he was also a nephew of Arnulf of Lisieux , another bishop of Lisieux . Nonant had a brother Sylvester , who was treasurer of Lisieux . Hugh Nonant was a canon in his uncle Arnulf 's cathedral chapter before serving as an archdeacon of the diocese of Lisieux from 1167 until 1184 . Nonant served in the household of Thomas Becket while Becket was Archbishop of Canterbury , and went into exile with Becket , although he left Becket 's service while the archbishop was in exile . While in Becket 's service , Nonant may have authored a letter dated to 1165 that is attributed to Becket . Nonant had been reconciled to King Henry II of England by 1170 . Along with Richard Barre , Nonant was named in January 1184 as a papal judge @-@ delegate in a case between two Norman monasteries . In 1184 , Nonant was sent by the king to the papal curia to petition Pope Lucius III on behalf of Henry the Lion , Duke of Saxony and Henry II 's son @-@ in @-@ law . Nonant 's success on this mission probably was the reason he was elevated to the episcopate in 1185 . 
 = = Bishop of Coventry = = 
 Nonant was elected bishop in 1185 , probably in January , and consecrated on 31 January 1188 . The long delay between his election and his consecration was due to Nonant 's continued diplomatic efforts on behalf of Henry II . In 1186 , he was sent to Rome to secure papal permission for the crowning of Prince John as King of Ireland . The bishop @-@ elect was briefly in England from December of 1186 until February 1187 , but then went with King Henry to the continent and did not return to England until January 1188 . However , when Henry returned to France in July 1188 , Hugh accompanied the king and did not return until shortly before the coronation of King Richard I of England . Nonant also purchased the offices of Sheriff of Warwickshire , Leicestershire , and Staffordshire . Holding these offices was against canon law , and the bishop 's tenure in these offices may have been the cause of his quarrel with Baldwin of Forde . 
 It was after the coronation of Richard that Nonant had a dispute with the monks of his cathedral chapter which led to Nonant replacing the monks with secular clergy . He was said to have commented that " I call my clerks gods and the monks demons . " Nonant was very shrewd and eloquent , but he was also violent in his attempts to reform or expel his monastic clergy from Coventry . In October 1189 he attempted to persuade his fellow bishops who had monastic cathedral chapters to expel the monks and replace them with secular clergy . He also attempted to get all the bishops to prosecute a joint case at Rome to expel the monastic cathedral chapters , but gave up that idea after the Archbishop of Canterbury , Baldwin of Exeter declined to go along . Nonant did , however , receive papal sanction for the replacement of monks at Coventry . By 1197 , however , Pope Celestine III issued instructions to Hubert Walter , the new Archbishop of Canterbury , Hugh of Lincoln , the Bishop of Lincoln and Samson of Tottington , the Abbot of Bury St Edmunds , to restore the monks to the cathedral . 
 After King Richard went to the Holy Land on the Third Crusade , Nonant supported the efforts of Prince John , King Richard 's brother , to seize power in England . Nonant joined with John in trying to wrest control of the castles of Tickhill and Nottingham from William Longchamp , the Bishop of Ely , who had been named justiciar and chancellor during Richard 's absence . It was probably Nonant that was responsible for the meeting at Loddon Bridge on 5 October 1191 that ended in the deposition of Longchamp from office . Nonant supported John 's side throughout the time that Richard was on Crusade and in captivity , and was tried with John after Richard 's return to England in 1194 . Nonant was only restored to royal favour in 1195 after the payment of a fine of 5000 marks . The bishop lost his three sheriffdoms , and retired to Normandy . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Nonant died on 27 March 1198 . Before his death he was clothed in the habit of a Benedictine monk by the monks of Bec Abbey and he died at Bec . On his deathbed , he confessed a long record of sins , which deterred any priest from absolving him . The historian A. L. Poole described Hugh as a " dexterous and unprincipled politician who had inherited the diplomatic gifts of his uncle . " Another historian , John Gillingham , stated that Nonant was King " John 's chief propagandist and , in his spare time , bishop of Coventry " . Hugh 's brother was Robert Brito , who was captured by King Richard in 1194 and starved to death because Robert had earlier refused to be a hostage for the payment of Richard 's ransom . 
 The constitutions of the cathedral chapter at Lichfield are often stated to have been Nonant 's work , but this has been disproven . The chronicler Roger of Howden inserted a letter supposedly by Nonant in his Chronica . This letter was also preserved in other manuscripts , including a section of a manuscript now in the Bodleian Library as manuscript ( MS ) Additional <unk> This letter has now been published as part of the English Episcopal Acta series in the volume on the diocese of Lichfield and Coventry . 
 = Italian cruiser Carlo Alberto = 
 The Italian cruiser Carlo Alberto was the second of two Vettor Pisani @-@ class armored cruisers built for the Royal Italian Navy ( Regia Marina ) in the 1890s . She was deployed overseas several times during her career , notably to the Far East and South America . The ship was used as a royal yacht by King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy in 1902 , during which time she was used for radio experiments by Guglielmo Marconi . Carlo Alberto served as a training ship before the start of the Italo @-@ Turkish War of 1911 – 12 . During the war she supported Italian operations in Libya . The ship was virtually inactive during World War I and was converted into a troop transport in 1917 – 18 . Carlo Alberto was stricken from the Navy List in 1920 and subsequently broken up for scrap . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Carlo Alberto had a length between perpendiculars of 99 meters ( 324 ft 10 in ) and an overall length of 105 @.@ 7 meters ( 346 ft 9 in ) . She had a beam of 18 @.@ 04 meters ( 59 ft 2 in ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 2 meters ( 23 ft 7 in ) . The ship displaced 6 @,@ 397 metric tons ( 6 @,@ 296 long tons ) at normal load , and 7 @,@ 057 metric tons ( 6 @,@ 946 long tons ) at deep load . The Vettor Pisani @-@ class ships had a complement of 28 officers and 472 to 476 enlisted men . 
 The ship was powered by two vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving one propeller shaft . Steam for the engines was supplied by eight Scotch marine boilers . Designed for a maximum output of 13 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 9 @,@ 700 kW ) and a speed of 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) , Carlo Alberto barely exceeded her designed speed when she reached 19 @.@ 1 knots ( 35 @.@ 4 km / h ; 22 @.@ 0 mph ) during her sea trials from 13 @,@ 219 ihp ( 9 @,@ 857 kW ) . She had a cruising radius of about 5 @,@ 400 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 000 km ; 6 @,@ 200 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 The main armament of the Vettor Pisani @-@ class ships consisted of twelve quick @-@ firing ( QF ) Cannone da 152 / 40 A Modello 1891 guns in single mounts . All of these guns were mounted on the broadside , eight on the upper deck and four at the corners of the central citadel in armored casemates . Single QF Cannone da 120 / 40 A Modello 1891 guns were mounted in the bow and stern and the remaining two 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) guns were positioned on the main deck between the 152 mm ( 6 @.@ 0 in ) guns . For defense against torpedo boats , the ship carried fourteen QF 57 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) Hotchkiss guns and eight QF 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss guns . The ship was also equipped with four 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes . 
 Carlo Alberto was protected by an armored belt that was 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) thick amidships and reduced to 11 cm ( 4 @.@ 3 in ) at the bow and stern . The upper strake of armor was also 15 cm thick and protected just the middle of the ship , up to the height of the upper deck . The curved armored deck was 3 @.@ 7 cm thick . The conning tower armor was also 15 cm thick and each 15 @.@ 2 cm gun was protected by a 5 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) gun shield . 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 Carlo Alberto , named after King Charles Albert of Sardinia , was laid down on 1 February 1892 at the Arsenale di La Spezia in La Spezia . The ship was launched on 23 September 1896 and completed on 1 May 1898 . She was deployed to South America later that year and returned to Italy on 28 February 1899 . Later that year Carlo Alberto was sent to the Far East and returned on 1 June 1900 . After her return the ship was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet . 
 Carlo Alberto served as the royal yacht for Victor Emmanuel III when he attended the Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom in 1902 . Victor Emmanuel invited Guglielmo Marconi to accompany him and conduct radio experiments en route . Originally scheduled for 26 June , the coronation was delayed by Edward 's illness and rescheduled for 9 August . In the meantime , the ship took Victor Emmanuel to meetings with Tsar Nicholas II of Russia in Kronstadt . She returned to England before the coronation ceremony and then participated in the fleet review at Spithead on 16 August . On the return voyage Marconi conducted more long @-@ range experiments with his site in Poldhu , Cornwall . The King then loaned Carlo Alberto to Marconi in September for more testing . She then ferried Marconi across the Atlantic to Glace Bay , Nova Scotia for further experiments transmitting radio messages across the ocean . After 15 December , when Marconi successfully transmitted messages from Glace Bay to Poldhu , Carlo Alberto was sent to Venezuelan waters during the Venezuelan crisis of 1902 – 03 , when an international force of British , German , and Italian warships blockaded Venezuela over the country 's refusal to pay foreign debts . She returned in early 1903 and was briefly deployed in Salonica later that year . From 1907 to 1910 she served as a gunnery and torpedo training ship . 
 When the Italo @-@ Turkish War of 1911 – 12 began on 29 September , Carlo Alberto was assigned to the Training Division . She bombarded the fortifications defending Tripoli and provided gunfire support to Italian forces at <unk> , Zuara and elsewhere in Tripolitania . She fired enough ammunition during these missions that her guns had to be replaced in early 1912 . After the war the ship was transferred to the Aegean Sea where she remained until March 1913 . 
 Obsolescent by the beginning of World War I , Carlo Alberto was not very active during the war . She spent almost the entire war based in Venice . The ship began conversion into a troop transport there in 1917 . This required the removal of her armor , the addition of a new deck and internal modifications to suit her new role . The work was finished in Taranto early the next year ; she was recommissioned with the new name of Zenson on 4 April 1918 . The ship was discarded on 12 June 1920 and subsequently scrapped .

 New York State Route 31A ( NY 31A ) is an east – west state highway located in the western part of New York in the United States . It serves as a southerly alternate route of NY 31 from the western part of Orleans County to the far western part of Monroe County . It diverges from NY 31 south of the village of Medina and parallels NY 31 eastward until it reconnects to its parent route southwest of the village of Brockport . While NY 31 passes through the villages of Medina , Albion , and Holley , NY 31A bypasses all three , serving sparsely populated areas to their south instead . The route intersects NY 98 south of Albion and NY 237 in Clarendon . 
 The origins of NY 31A date back to the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York when the section of modern NY 31 between Middleport and Medina was designated as NY 3A . It was renumbered to NY 3B c . 1932 and extended northeastward to Knowlesville via Millville by 1932 before becoming NY 31A c . 1935 . NY 31A was cut back to its current western terminus in 1949 and extended eastward to NY 19 and NY 31 in Brockport c . 1963 , replacing New York State Route 31D , a spur route linking NY 31 to the Monroe – Orleans county line . The route was truncated to its current eastern terminus in the early 1980s after NY 31 was altered to bypass Brockport to the southwest . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 31A begins at a four @-@ way intersection in the southern portion of the village of Medina . At this junction , NY 31 travels to the west and to the north ( eastbound ) , NY 63 travels to the north and to the south , and NY 31A travels to the east as Maple Ridge Road . It leaves the village shortly afterward , entering a rural area of Orleans County dominated by open fields . The route heads due east to Millville , a small hamlet situated at the junction of NY 31A and East Shelby Road in northeastern Shelby . At the eastern edge of the community , NY 31A meets West County House Road , the former routing of NY 31A toward Knowlesville . 
 Past Millville , NY 31A becomes West Lee Road and heads southeastward through farmland to the Barre town line , at which point the route turns back to the east and follows a slightly northeasterly alignment for 5 miles ( 8 km ) into the town of Albion . Here , NY 31A passes the Benjamin Franklin Gates House , situated on the north side of the route near a junction with Mix Road . Not far to the east , the highway meets NY 98 at a rural junction 3 miles ( 5 km ) south of the village of Albion and 50 yards ( 46 m ) north of the Albion town line . NY 31A , now East Lee Road , continues on a northeasterly line for another 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) before curving southward for 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to avoid a marshy area near the eastern town line . The route briefly reenters Barre along this stretch , heading south and east across the town 's northeastern corner on its way into the town of Clarendon . 
 The highway retains an east – west alignment for 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) to the outskirts of the hamlet of Clarendon , the largest community on the route since Medina . At this point , NY 31A turns southeast to serve Clarendon , where NY 31A intersects NY 237 in the center of the hamlet . Upon crossing NY 237 , NY 31A changes names for the final time , becoming Fourth Section Road . The rural surroundings return outside of Clarendon hamlet as a mix of woodlands and fields , which NY 31A progresses generally northeasterly through to the hamlet of Bennetts Corners . Here , the amount of development along the route begins to increase , a change ushered in by a pair of large housing tracts in the eastern part of the community . 
 East of Bennetts Corners , the route takes on a more easterly alignment as it crosses into Monroe County , which contains just 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) of the 23 @-@ mile ( 37 km ) NY 31A . In Monroe County , the highway passes through a slightly more populated area on its way to a junction with NY 31 and NY 19 Truck southwest of the village of Brockport . Both NY 19 Truck and NY 31 enter the intersection from the north on Redman Road and turn east at Fourth Section Road , following the right @-@ of @-@ way of NY 31A eastward toward Brockport 's business district . The junction completes the alternate loop of NY 31 , which follows a parallel but more northerly routing between Medina and Brockport that takes it through the villages of Medina , Albion , and Holley . Along the way , NY 31 passes the campus of SUNY Brockport , situated 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) northeast of NY 31A 's eastern terminus . 
 = = History = = 
 Most of modern NY 31 west of Rochester — including the section between Gasport and the outskirts of Brockport — was originally designated as part of NY 3 when the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924 . In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , NY 3 was realigned between Middleport and Medina to follow what is now NY 31E . NY 3 's former routing between the two villages was designated as NY 3A . NY 3A was redesignated as NY 3B c . 1932 as part of a renumbering of NY 3 's suffixed routes . NY 3B was also extended eastward along Maple Ridge , County House , and Taylor Hill Roads to meet NY 31 at Knowlesville Station ( a hamlet in the town of Ridgeway ) by this time . The route was renumbered again c . 1935 , becoming NY 31A after NY 3 was replaced with a realigned NY 31 west of Rochester . 
 Farther east , the segment of modern NY 31A from Clarendon to Brockport and what is now NY 31 from NY 31A to NY 19 became NY 3B in the 1930 renumbering . Like NY 3A , NY 3B was renumbered to NY 3C c . 1932 ; however , it was also truncated to consist solely of the Monroe County portion of its routing at this time . The route now began at the Monroe – Orleans county line , where state maintenance of Fourth Section Road began , and ended at the junction of NY 63 ( now NY 19 ) and NY 3 ( NY 31 ) south of Brockport . NY 3C was redesignated as NY 31D c . 1935 following NY 31 's <unk> of NY 3 west of Rochester . 
 On January 1 , 1949 , NY 31 was rerouted between Middleport and Medina to use NY 31A between the two locations . NY 31A was truncated to its current western terminus in Medina as a result . It was substantially extended c . 1963 , however , to a new eastern terminus in Brockport . The highway was rerouted east of Millville to follow a series of previously unnumbered roads through Barre and Clarendon to Monroe County , where it supplanted NY 31D from the county line eastward . NY 31A was truncated slightly to its current eastern terminus in the early 1980s after NY 31 was rerouted to bypass Brockport to the west and south on NY 31A and Redman Road .

 = Grand Street Bridge ( Connecticut ) = 
 The Grand Street Bridge was a double @-@ leaf deck @-@ girder bascule bridge in Bridgeport , Connecticut , United States , that spanned the Pequonnock River and connected Grand Street and Artic Street . It was one of three movable bridges planned by the City of Bridgeport in 1916 at the request of the War Department during World War I. Construction was completed in 1919 , but the delays surrounding the construction went to the Connecticut Supreme Court in case of Edward <unk> . Tompkins , Inc. vs. City of Bridgeport , Connecticut . The court ruled in favor of Tompkins and awarded damages equal to the contract . In 1936 , the bridge had excessive settling and required the replacement of its southeast pier . As part of the repairs , a new floor and electrical system were installed . In 1965 , the floor was replaced with a steel grate on I @-@ beam floor . In 1984 , the eastern approach span was replaced and the northwest trunnion post was reconstructed . The bridge was closed in the 1990s and dismantled in 1999 . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Requests for bids for the Grand Street Bridge were announced in the trade publication Contractor , for the " substructure , superstructure and approaches " . Originally the deadline was set for April 6 , 1916 , but it was later extended to May 6 , 1916 . The June 1916 issue of Contractor announced that Edward DeVoe Tompkins , Inc . , obtained the contract with the lowest bid of $ 187 @,@ 000 . The contract , signed on May 16 , 1916 , stipulated that work on the bridge was to begin within 15 days and the project 's original deadline would be September 1 , 1917 . 
 The engineering firm which provided the design was the Strauss Bascule Bridge Company , and the fabricator of the steel was the Penn Bridge Company . The moving bridge had two bascule leaves , each 48 feet ( 15 m ) long that were connected by a 69 feet ( 21 m ) long deck @-@ girder approach , for a total overall length of 372 feet ( 113 m ) . The girders were 40 feet ( 12 m ) in width ; which were wider than the 37 @.@ 5 feet ( 11 @.@ 4 m ) <unk> . The angle @-@ iron outriggers added another 7 @.@ 5 feet ( 2 @.@ 3 m ) on each side , making the bridge 's total width 55 feet ( 17 m ) . The original floor was made of wooden blocks atop wooden planks . 
 The contract called for the complete construction of the bridge , including the approaches on each side of the river and four piers with each consisting of two cylindrical columns of reinforced concrete . Construction of the bridge was complicated by the contract which stipulated that concrete had to be pumped dry , the concrete of each cylinder had to be poured in " one continuous operation " and that the wooden piles for the pier must project at least six feet into the concrete base . These stipulations required the use of a cofferdam to deposit the concrete , but boring in the river showed that it did not have a suitable bottom upon which to build . Tompkins would have to construct a 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) thick artificial bottom in order to proceed . To deposit in accordance with the contract , a tremie would be needed . A tremie is a pipe that concrete is passed through so it doesn 't contact the water and disintegrate . 
 The plans were stipulated to be presented by May 26 , but it first submitted on June 2 with the sketches of the design following on June 14 , 1916 . The project was delayed due to the consulting engineer 's proposals being denied by the Bridgeport bridge commission and the " ambiguous and contradictory requirements " advanced and by the position of the consulting engineer . The project was delayed for months because due to the consulting engineer 's discussions , via mail , between Bridgeport and Chicago . Construction of the concrete wing @-@ piles and slabs began around August 1 , 1916 and the substructure was nearly completed by January 31 , 1917 , the original deadline for that part of the project , but the issue with the construction of the piers had already greatly delayed the construction . 
 In early 1917 , Tompkins submitted a plan to attempt a pumping out of the constructed cofferdam , which it noted as dangerous to the crew . This plan was denied because there was no artificial seal in place . The commission did not want Tompkins to proceed until the commission consulted an advisory engineer . In April 1917 , William Burr was made the advisory engineer and made many changes to the original Strauss designs , most importantly the requirement that piers project into the concrete cylinders was stricken . Burr 's alterations called for an open caisson for the central piers which made impossible the projection of piles into the concrete and required dredging that was unnecessary under the initial Strauss plan . The seal for the end piers was thickened to 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) and would be deposited through a tremie , as previously suggested by Tompkins . The Bridgeport bridge commission terminated the contract on August 20 , 1917 and notified Tompkins that it would complete the project . The commission had <unk> 's crew forcibly ejected from the site on September 3 , 1917 and took possession of its equipment until October 19 , 1917 . While the contract allowed the equipment to be taken , it also stipulated that delays that were the fault of the city would result in an equal extension to the time lost and Tompkins would sue the City of Bridgeport . The City of Bridgeport hired another contractor to complete the bridge . 
 The cylindrical piers of the bridge were 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) in diameter and finished with an ashlar of cut granite . The completed bridge had its bascule leaves pivot on trunnions located 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) from the end of the girders . The bridge 's reinforced @-@ concrete counterweights , measuring 5 @.@ 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 7 m ) high by 11 @.@ 5 feet ( 3 @.@ 5 m ) wide , was supported by pivots at the ends of the girders . The trunnions were supported by box @-@ girder posts on the sides of the bascule leaves and each set of inside trunnion posts were braced by a girder ran both between them and to the operating mechanism . Earle Gear and Machine Company provided the operating mechanism for the bridge . The bascule leaves were raised by a motor that used reduction gears and engaged a pinion to move the rack quadrant to raise the bridge . A manual @-@ operation shaft was originally present so that it could be operated from the surface of the roadway , but it was later paved over . The operator 's house was located on the south side of the western approach , it originally housed the operator 's house and public bathrooms , but it was removed in 1936 . The plans originally dictated for a second station on the opposite end , but 1930s photos shows it was apparently never constructed . 
 = = Court case = = 
 Edward DeVoe Tompkins , Inc. suffered numerous delays in the construction of the bridge and sued the City of Bridgeport . The case went to the Connecticut Supreme Court in Edward <unk> . Tompkins v. City of Bridgeport , Connecticut . Tompkins sued the City of Bridgeport for breach of contract on the grounds that City of Bridgeport was unresponsive , and did not clear the site as scheduled . Tompkins also cited other concerns relating to the design and construction of the bridge including the design engineers from the Strauss Bascule Bridge Company being located in Chicago . The City of Bridgeport alleged that Tompkins was incompetent and uncooperative , but the Connecticut Supreme Court disagreed and ruled in favor of Tompkins . The Court awarded Tompkins the full contract as damages . 
 = = Service Life = = 
 The Grand Street Bridge opened for traffic in 1919 , but had to be closed in 1932 after the southeast pier was excessively settled . The Connecticut Highway Department and federal government provided the funds required to remove the bascule leaves and replace the pier in 1936 . As a part of the renovations , a new floor and electrical system were installed . In 1965 , the bridge floor was replaced with steel grating atop 14 @-@ inch ( 36 @-@ cm ) I @-@ beam stringers . In 1984 , the eastern approach span and northwest trunnion post , the point where the bridge pivots , were reconstructed as part of what would be the bridge 's last major renovations . Other minor repairs to the bridge 's steel and masonry were done during the project . The bridge was closed in the 1990s and it was dismantled in 1999 . In 2010 , the United States Coast Guard struck the rule pertaining to the operation of the bridge due to its removal . Previously , the rule stated that the bridge need not open for the passage of vessels . 
 = Cricket ( insect ) = 
 Crickets ( also known as " true crickets " ) , of the family Gryllidae , are insects related to bush crickets , and , more distantly , to grasshoppers . The Gryllidae have mainly cylindrical bodies , round heads , and long antennae . Behind the head is a smooth , robust pronotum . The abdomen ends in a pair of long cerci ( spikes ) ; females have a long , cylindrical ovipositor . The hind legs have enlarged femora ( thighs ) , providing power for jumping . The front wings are adapted as tough , leathery elytra ( wing covers ) , and some crickets chirp by rubbing parts of these together . The hind wings are membranous and folded when not in use for flight ; many species , however , are flightless . The largest members of the family are the bull crickets , <unk> , which are up to 5 cm ( 2 in ) long . 
 More than 900 species of crickets are described ; the Gryllidae are distributed all around the world except at latitudes 55 ° or higher , with the greatest diversity being in the tropics . They occur in varied habitats from grassland , bushes , and forests to marshes , beaches , and caves . Crickets are mainly nocturnal , and are best known for the loud , persistent , chirping song of males trying to attract females , although some species are mute . The singing species have good hearing , via the tympani ( eardrums ) on the tibiae of the front legs . 
 Crickets often appear as characters in literature . The Talking Cricket features in Carlo Collodi 's 1883 children 's book , The Adventures of Pinocchio , and in films based on the book . The eponymous insect is central to Charles Dickens 's 1845 The Cricket on the Hearth , as is the chirping insect in George Selden 's 1960 The Cricket in Times Square . Crickets are celebrated in poems by William Wordsworth , John Keats , and Du Fu . They are kept as pets in countries from China to Europe , sometimes for cricket fighting . Crickets are efficient at converting their food into body mass , making them a candidate for food production . They are used as food in Southeast Asia , where they are sold deep @-@ fried in markets as snacks . They are also used to feed carnivorous pets and zoo animals . In Brazilian folklore , crickets feature as omens of various events . 
 = = Description = = 
 Crickets are small to medium @-@ sized insects with mostly cylindrical , somewhat vertically flattened bodies . The head is spherical with long slender antennae arising from cone @-@ shaped scapes ( first segments ) and just behind these are two large compound eyes . On the forehead are three ocelli ( simple eyes ) . The pronotum ( first thoracic segment ) is trapezoidal in shape , robust , and well @-@ <unk> . It is smooth and has neither dorsal or lateral keels ( ridges ) . 
 At the tip of the abdomen is a pair of long cerci ( paired appendages on rearmost segment ) , and in females , the ovipositor is cylindrical , long and narrow , smooth and shiny . The femora ( third segments ) of the back pair of legs are greatly enlarged for jumping . The tibiae ( fourth segments ) of the hind legs are armed with a number of moveable spurs , the arrangement of which is characteristic of each species . The tibiae of the front legs bear one or more tympani which are used for the reception of sound . 
 The wings lie flat on the body and are very variable in size between species , being reduced in size in some crickets and missing in others . The fore wings are elytra made of tough chitin , acting as a protective shield for the soft parts of the body and in males , bear the stridulatory organs for the production of sound . The hind pair is membranous , folding fan @-@ wise under the fore wings . In many species , the wings are not adapted for flight . 
 The largest members of the family are the 5 cm ( 2 in ) -long bull crickets ( <unk> ) which excavate burrows a metre or more deep . The tree crickets ( <unk> ) are delicate white or pale green insects with transparent fore wings , while the field crickets ( <unk> ) are robust brown or black insects . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Crickets have a cosmopolitan distribution , being found in all parts of the world with the exception of cold regions at latitudes higher than about 55 ° North and South . They have colonised many large and small islands , sometimes flying over the sea to reach these locations , or perhaps conveyed on floating timber or by human activity . The greatest diversity occurs in tropical locations , such as in Malaysia , where 88 species were heard chirping from a single location near Kuala Lumpur . A greater number than this could have been present because some species are mute . 
 Crickets are found in many habitats . Members of several subfamilies are found in the upper tree canopy , in bushes , and among grasses and herbs . They also occur on the ground and in caves , and some are subterranean , excavating shallow or deep burrows . Some make galleries in rotting wood , and certain beach @-@ dwelling species can run and jump over the surface of pools . 
 = = Biology = = 
 = = = Defence = = = 
 Crickets are relatively defenceless , soft @-@ bodied insects . Most species are nocturnal and spend the day hidden in cracks , under bark , inside curling leaves , under stones or fallen logs , in leaf litter , or in the cracks in the ground that develop in dry weather . Some excavate their own shallow holes in rotting wood or underground and fold in their antennae to conceal their presence . Some of these burrows are temporary shelters , used for a single day , but others serve as more permanent residences and places for mating and laying eggs . Crickets burrow by loosening the soil with the mandibles and then carrying it with the limbs , flicking it backwards with the hind legs or pushing it with the head . 
 Other defensive strategies are the use of camouflage , fleeing , and aggression . Some species have adopted colourings , shapes , and patterns that make it difficult for predators that hunt by sight to detect them . They tend to be dull shades of brown , grey , and green that blend into their background , and desert species tend to be pale . Some species can fly , but the mode of flight tends to be clumsy , so the most usual response to danger is to scuttle away to find a hiding place . 
 = = = Chirping = = = 
 Most male crickets make a loud chirping sound by stridulation . The stridulatory organ is located on the tegmen , or fore wing , which is leathery in texture . A large vein runs along the centre of each tegmen , with comb @-@ like serrations on its edge forming a file @-@ like structure , and at the rear edge of the tegmen is a scraper . The tegmina are held at an angle to the body and rhythmically raised and lowered which causes the scraper on one wing to rasp on the file on the other . The central part of the tegmen contains the " harp " , an area of thick , <unk> membrane which resonates and amplifies the volume of sound , as does the pocket of air between the tegmina and the body wall . Most female crickets lack the necessary adaptations to stridulate , so make no sound . 
 Several types of cricket songs are in the repertoire of some species . The calling song attracts females and repels other males , and is fairly loud . The courting song is used when a female cricket is near and encourages her to mate with the caller . A triumphal song is produced for a brief period after a successful mating , and may reinforce the mating bond to encourage the female to lay some eggs rather than find another male . An aggressive song is triggered by contact chemoreceptors on the antennae that detect the presence of another male cricket . 
 Crickets chirp at different rates depending on their species and the temperature of their environment . Most species chirp at higher rates the higher the temperature is ( about 62 chirps a minute at 13 ° C in one common species ; each species has its own rate ) . The relationship between temperature and the rate of chirping is known as <unk> 's law . According to this law , counting the number of chirps produced in 14 seconds by the snowy tree cricket , common in the United States , and adding 40 will approximate the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit . 
 In 1975 , Dr. William H. Cade discovered that the parasitic tachinid fly Ormia ochracea is attracted to the song of the cricket , and uses it to locate the male to deposit her larvae on him . It was the first known example of a natural enemy that locates its host or prey using the mating signal . Since then , many species of crickets have been found to be carrying the same parasitic fly , or related species . In response to this selective pressure , a mutation leaving males unable to chirp was observed amongst a population of field crickets on the Hawaiian island of Kauai , enabling these crickets to elude their parasitoid predators . 
 = = = Flight = = = 
 Some species , such as the ground crickets ( <unk> ) , are wingless ; others have small fore wings and no hind wings ( <unk> ) , others lack hind wings and have shortened fore wings in females only , while others are macropterous , with the hind wings longer than the fore wings . In <unk> , the proportion of macropterous individuals varies from very low to 100 % . Probably , most species with hind wings longer than fore wings engage in flight . 
 Some species , such as Gryllus assimilis , take off , fly , and land efficiently and well , while other species are clumsy fliers . In some species , the hind wings are shed , leaving wing stumps , usually after dispersal of the insect by flight . In other species , they may be pulled off and consumed by the cricket itself or by another individual , probably providing a nutritional boost . 
 Gryllus firmus exhibits wing polymorphism ; some individuals have fully functional , long hind wings and others have short wings and cannot fly . The short @-@ winged females have smaller flight muscles , greater ovarian development , and produce more eggs , so the polymorphism adapts the cricket for either dispersal or reproduction . In some long @-@ winged individuals , the flight muscles deteriorate during adulthood and the insect 's reproductive capabilities improve . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 Captive crickets are omnivorous ; when deprived of their natural diet , they accept a wide range of organic foodstuffs . Some species are completely herbivorous , feeding on flowers , fruit , and leaves , with ground @-@ based species consuming seedlings , grasses , pieces of leaf , and the shoots of young plants . Others are more predatory and include in their diet invertebrate eggs , larvae , pupae , moulting insects , scale insects , and aphids . Many are scavengers and consume various organic remains , decaying plants , seedlings , and fungi . In captivity , many species have been successfully reared on a diet of ground , commercial dry dog food , supplemented with lettuce and aphids . 
 Crickets have relatively powerful jaws , and several species have been known to bite humans . 
 = = = Reproduction and lifecycle = = = 
 Male crickets establish their dominance over each other by aggression . They start by lashing each other with their antennae and flaring their mandibles . Unless one retreats at this stage , they resort to grappling , at the same time each emitting calls that are quite unlike those uttered in other circumstances . When one achieves dominance , it sings loudly , while the loser remains silent . 
 Females are generally attracted to males by their calls , though in <unk> species , some other mechanism must be involved . After the pair has made antennal contact , a courtship period may occur during which the character of the call changes . The female mounts the male and a single spermatophore is transferred to the external genitalia of the female . Sperm flows from this into the female 's oviduct over a period of a few minutes or up to an hour , depending on species . After copulation , the female may remove or eat the spermatophore ; males may attempt to prevent this with various ritualised behaviours . The female may mate on several occasions with different males . 
 Most crickets lay their eggs in the soil or inside the stems of plants , and to do this , female crickets have a long , needle @-@ like or sabre @-@ like egg @-@ laying organ called an ovipositor . Some ground @-@ dwelling species have dispensed with this , either depositing their eggs in an underground chamber or pushing them into the wall of a burrow . The short @-@ tailed cricket ( <unk> ) excavates a burrow with chambers and a defecating area , lays its eggs in a pile on a chamber floor , and after the eggs have hatched , feeds the juveniles for about a month . 
 Crickets are <unk> insects , whose lifecycle consists of an egg stage , a larval or nymph stage that increasingly resembles the adult form as the nymph grows , and an adult stage . The egg hatches into a nymph about the size of a fruit fly . This passes through about 10 larval stages , and with each successive moult , it become more like an adult . After the final moult , the genitalia and wings are fully developed , but a period of maturation is needed before the cricket is ready to breed . 
 The species Gryllus <unk> exhibits the reproductive pattern of polyandry . This sexual selective pattern increases the overall fitness of the species and promotes genetic variation . The females select and mate with multiple viable sperm donors and exhibit a distinct preference to novel mates . 
 = = = Inbreeding avoidance = = = 
 Female <unk> <unk> crickets from natural populations mate <unk> and store sperm from multiple males . Female crickets exert a <unk> fertilization bias in favour of unrelated males to avoid the genetic consequences of inbreeding . Fertilization bias depends on the control of sperm transport to the sperm storage organs . The inhibition of sperm storage by female crickets can act as a form of cryptic female choice to avoid the severe negative effects of inbreeding . 
 In controlled @-@ breeding experiments with the cricket Gryllus firmus , seven inbred lines were tested , and during 14 generations of brother – sister matings , nymphal weight and early fecundity declined substantially . This observed inbreeding depression appeared to be due to an increased frequency of homozygous combinations of deleterious recessive alleles generated by the inbreeding ( thereby decreasing fitness ) . These results support the general idea that the principal benefit of outcrossing is the masking of deleterious recessive alleles by wild @-@ type alleles . 
 = = = Predators , parasites , and pathogens = = = 
 Crickets have many natural enemies and are subject to various pathogens and parasites . They are eaten by large numbers of vertebrate and invertebrate predators and their hard parts are often found when the contents of animal 's guts are examined . Mediterranean house geckos ( Hemidactylus <unk> ) have learned that although a calling decorated cricket ( <unk> <unk> ) may be safely positioned in an out @-@ of @-@ reach burrow , female crickets attracted to the call can be intercepted and eaten . 
 The entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae attacks and kills crickets and has been used as the basis of control in pest populations . The insects are also affected by the cricket paralysis virus , which has caused high levels of fatalities in cricket @-@ rearing facilities . Other fatal diseases that have been identified in mass @-@ rearing establishments include Rickettsia and three further viruses . The diseases may spread more rapidly if the crickets become cannibalistic and eat the corpses . 
 Red parasitic mites sometimes attach themselves to the dorsal region of crickets and may greatly affect them . The horsehair worm Paragordius varius is an internal parasite and can control the behaviour of its cricket host and cause it to enter water , where the parasite continues its lifecycle and the cricket likely drowns . The larvae of the <unk> fly <unk> <unk> develop inside the body cavity of field crickets . Female parasitic wasps of <unk> lay their eggs on crickets , and their developing larvae gradually devour their hosts . Other wasps in the family <unk> are egg parasitoids , seeking out batches of eggs laid by crickets in plant tissues in which to insert their eggs . 
 The fly Ormia ochracea has very acute hearing and targets calling male crickets . It locates its prey by ear and then lays its eggs nearby . The developing larvae burrow inside any crickets with which they come in contact and in the course of a week or so , devour what remains of the host before pupating . In Florida , the parasitic flies were only present in the autumn , and at that time of year , the males sang less but for longer periods . A trade @-@ off exists for the male between attracting females and being parasitized . 
 = = Phylogeny and taxonomy = = 
 The phylogenetic relationships of the Gryllidae , summarized by Darryl Gwynne in 1995 from his own work ( using mainly anatomical characteristics ) and that of earlier authors , are shown in the following cladogram , with the Orthoptera divided into two main groups , Ensifera ( crickets sensu lato ) and Caelifera ( grasshoppers ) . Fossil Ensifera are found from the late Carboniferous period ( 300 Mya ) onwards , and the true crickets , Gryllidae , from the Triassic period ( 250 to 200 Mya ) . 
 Cladogram after Gwynne , 1995 : 
 A phylogenetic study by Jost & Shaw in 2006 using sequences from 18S , 28S , and 16S rRNA supported the monophyly of Ensifera . Most <unk> families were also found to be monophyletic , and the superfamily <unk> was found to include <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . <unk> and <unk> were shown to be sister taxa , and <unk> and <unk> were found to be more closely related to <unk> than had previously been thought . The authors stated that " a high degree of conflict exists between the molecular and morphological data , possibly indicating that much <unk> is present in Ensifera , particularly in acoustic structures . " They considered that tegmen stridulation and tibial <unk> are ancestral to Ensifera and have been lost on multiple occasions , especially within the Gryllidae . 
 More than 900 species of Gryllidae ( true crickets ) are known . The family is divided into these subfamily groups , subfamilies , and extinct genera ( not placed within the subfamilies ) :

 The folklore and mythology surrounding crickets is extensive . The singing of crickets in the folklore of Brazil and elsewhere is sometimes taken to be a sign of impending rain , or of a financial windfall . In Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca 's chronicles of the Spanish conquest of the Americas , the sudden chirping of a cricket heralded the sighting of land for his crew , just as their water supply had run out . In <unk> , Brazil , a black cricket in a room is said to portend illness ; a gray one , money ; and a green one , hope . In Alagoas state , northeast Brazil , a cricket announces death , thus it is killed if it chirps in a house . In Barbados , a loud cricket means money is coming in ; hence , a cricket must not be killed or evicted if it chirps inside a house . However , another type of cricket that is less noisy <unk> illness or death .

 Crickets feature as major characters in novels and children 's books . Charles Dickens 's 1845 novella The Cricket on the Hearth , divided into sections called " <unk> " , tells the story of a cricket which chirps on the hearth and acts as a guardian angel to a family . Carlo Collodi 's 1883 children 's book " Le <unk> di Pinocchio " ( The Adventures of Pinocchio ) featured " Il Grillo <unk> " ( The Talking Cricket ) as one of its characters . George Selden 's 1960 children 's book The Cricket in Times Square tells the story of Chester the cricket from Connecticut who joins a family and their other animals , and is taken to see Times Square in New York . The story , which won the Newbery Honor , came to Selden on hearing a real cricket chirp in Times Square . 
 The French entomologist Jean @-@ Henri Fabre 's popular Souvenirs <unk> devotes a whole chapter to the cricket , discussing its construction of a burrow and its song @-@ making . The account is mainly of the field cricket , but also mentions the Italian cricket . 
 Crickets have from time to time appeared in poetry . William Wordsworth 's 1805 poem The <unk> to Her Infant includes the couplet " The kitten sleeps upon the hearth , The crickets long have ceased their mirth " . John Keats 's 1819 poem Ode to Autumn includes the lines " Hedge @-@ crickets sing ; and now with treble soft / The redbreast whistles from a garden @-@ croft " . The Chinese Tang dynasty poet Du Fu ( 712 – 770 ) wrote a poem that in the translation by J. P. Seaton begins " House cricket ... <unk> thing . And yet how his mournful song moves us . Out in the grass his cry was a tremble , But now , he trills beneath our bed , to share his sorrow . " 
 = = = As pets and fighting animals = = = 
 Crickets are kept as pets and are considered good luck in some countries ; in China , they are sometimes kept in cages or in hollowed @-@ out gourds specially created in novel shapes . The practice was common in Japan for thousands of years ; it peaked in the 19th century , though crickets are still sold at pet shops . It is also common to have them as caged pets in some European countries , particularly in the Iberian Peninsula . Cricket fighting is a traditional Chinese pastime that dates back to the Tang dynasty ( 618 – 907 ) . Originally an indulgence of emperors , cricket fighting later became popular among commoners . The dominance and fighting ability of males does not depend on strength alone ; it has been found that they become more aggressive after certain pre @-@ fight experiences such as isolation , or when defending a refuge . Crickets forced to fly for a short while will afterwards fight for two to three times longer than they otherwise would . 
 = = = As food = = = 
 In the southern part of Asia including Cambodia , Laos , Thailand and Vietnam , crickets are commonly eaten as a snack , prepared by deep frying the soaked and cleaned insects . In Thailand , there are 20 @,@ 000 farmers rearing crickets , with an estimated production of 7 @,@ 500 tons per year and United Nation 's FAO has implemented a project in Laos to improve cricket farming and consequently food security . 
 The food conversion efficiency of house crickets ( <unk> domesticus ) is 1 @.@ 7 , some five times higher than that for beef cattle , and if their fecundity is taken into account , 15 to 20 times higher . 
 More and more small companies in western countries are processing crickets to convert them in powder ( often referred to as flour ) to produce processed food products like protein bars , cricket pasta , and cookies . This innovation is part of a general diffusion of edible insects as food . Crickets are reared on a large scale as food for carnivorous zoo and laboratory animals ; they may be " gut loaded " with additional minerals , such as calcium , to provide a balanced diet for predators such as tree frogs ( Hylidae ) .

 Cricket characters feature in the Walt Disney animated movies Pinocchio ( 1940 ) , where Jiminy Cricket becomes the title character 's conscience , and in Mulan ( 1998 ) , where Cri @-@ kee is carried in a cage as a symbol of luck , in the Asian manner . The Crickets was the name of Buddy Holly 's rock and roll band ; Holly 's home town baseball team in the 1990s was called the Lubbock Crickets . Cricket is the name of a US children 's literary magazine founded in 1973 ; it uses a cast of insect characters . The sound of crickets is often used in media to emphasize silence , often for comic effect after an awkward joke , in a similar manner to tumbleweed .

 = The Dorchester = 
 The Dorchester is a five @-@ star luxury hotel on Park Lane and Deanery Street , London , to the east of Hyde Park . It is one of the world 's most prestigious and expensive hotels . The Dorchester opened on 18 April 1931 , and still retains its 1930s furnishings and ambiance despite being modernised . 
 Throughout its history the hotel has been closely associated with the rich and famous . During the 1930s it became known as a haunt of numerous writers and artists such as poet Cecil Day @-@ Lewis , novelist Somerset Maugham , and the painter Sir Alfred Munnings . It held prestigious literary gatherings , notably the " Foyles Literary Luncheons " , an event the hotel still hosts today . During the Second World War , the strength of its construction gave the hotel the reputation of being one of London 's safest buildings , and a host of political and military luminaries chose it as their London residence . Queen Elizabeth II attended the Dorchester when she was a princess on the day prior to the announcement of her engagement to the Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh on 10 July 1947 . The hotel has since become particularly popular with film actors , models and rock stars , and Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton frequently stayed at the hotel throughout the 1960s and 1970s . The hotel became a Grade II Listed Building in January 1981 , and was subsequently purchased by the Sultan of Brunei in 1985 . It belongs to the Dorchester Collection , which in turn is owned by the Brunei Investment Agency ( BIA ) , an arm of the Ministry of Finance of Brunei . 
 In the 1950s , theatrical designer Oliver Messel made a number of notable changes to the interior of the hotel , incorporating aspects of theatrical design into the hotel interior . He designed the lavish apartments on the 7th and 8th floors ; the Oliver Messel Suite is named after him , designed in the Georgian country house style . Between 1988 and 1990 , the hotel was completely renovated by Bob Lush of the Richmond Design Group at a cost of US $ 100 million . 
 Today The Dorchester has five restaurants : The Grill , Alain Ducasse , The Spatisserie , The Promenade , and China Tang . Alain Ducasse 's restaurant is one of the UK 's four 3 @-@ Michelin @-@ starred restaurants . Afternoon tea , a tradition which has taken place at the hotel since its opening in 1931 , is served every day of the week at five in the afternoon in The Promenade and the Spatisserie . Harry Craddock , one of the world 's most famous <unk> of the 1930s , invented the " Dorchester of London " cocktail here at the Dorchester Bar . A well @-@ lit plane tree stands at the edge of the hotel in the front garden , and was named one of the " Great Trees of London " by the London Tree Forum and Countryside Commission in 1997 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 The site was originally part of the Manor of Hyde , which was given to William the Conqueror by Geoffrey de Mandeville . Joseph Damer acquired it in the 18th century and a large building was constructed in 1751 . It was named Dorchester House in 1792 after Damer became the Earl of Dorchester . In the early 19th century it became the Hertford House after it was purchased by Francis Seymour @-@ Conway , the 3rd Marquess of Hertford , and alterations were made to it , inspired by the Villa Farnese of Rome . Following the death of Hertford , it was converted into a mansion by Captain Robert Stayner Holford . 
 The background to the development of the Dorchester Hotel is complicated . Sir Malcolm McAlpine , a partner in the building company , Sir Robert McAlpine & Sons , and Sir Frances Towle , the managing director of Gordon Hotels Ltd . , shared a vision of creating the ‘ perfect hotel ’ : ultramodern and ultra @-@ efficient , with all the conveniences modern technology could supply . The two companies purchased Hertford House in 1929 and quickly demolished it . The British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) had also shown an interest in purchasing it and had almost done so prior to the McAlpine acquisition , but instead they turned their attention to Foley House . The purchase and destruction of Hertford House was part of significant redevelopment which took place on Park Lane during this period ; it followed the gutting of Grosvenor House and the building of the Grosvenor Hotel , which was completed in 1929 . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 Sir Owen Williams was commissioned to design the new hotel , using reinforced concrete to allow the creation of large internal spaces without support pillars , but he abandoned the project in February 1930 and was replaced with William Curtis Green . James Maude Richards , hired by Williams , served as an architectural assistant within the all @-@ engineer staff . Percy Morley Horder , consulting architect to Gordon 's Hotels , had not been consulted during the design process and , after seeing the plan , resigned from the project , remarking to The Observer that the design was ill @-@ suited for the location , assuming the concrete was to be left unpainted and that the insulation would be minimal . Some 40 @,@ 000 tonnes of earth were excavated to make room for the hotel 's extensive basement which is one @-@ third of the size of the hotel above the surface . The upper eight floors were erected in just 10 weeks , supported on a massive 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) thick reinforced concrete deck that forms the roof of the first floor . With the development of the Dorchester , concerns were raised that Park Lane would soon become New York City 's Fifth Avenue .

 The new Dorchester Hotel was feted with a grand opening on 18 April ( 21 April also cited ) 1931 by Lady Violet Astor . The Dorchester quickly gained reputation as a luxury hotel . During the 1930s it became known as a haunt of numerous writers and artists such as poet Cecil Day @-@ Lewis , novelist Somerset Maugham , and the painter Sir Alfred Munnings . There were prestigious literary gatherings , including " Foyles Literary Luncheons " , an event the hotel still hosts . Shortly after the opening , Sir Percival David , a leading admirer of Chinese porcelain , moved his growing collection from the Mayfair Hotel to the Dorchester , where he kept it in his suites for many years . Danny Kaye began appearing in cabaret at the hotel in the 1930s , initially earning £ 50 a week . Many blues and jazz artists appeared at the hotel , including Alberta Hunter and the Jack Jackson Orchestra . In 1934 , Hunter and her orchestra recorded Noël Coward 's " I Travel Alone " and Cole Porter 's " Miss Ortis Regrets " at the hotel ; both Coward and Porter were fans . It also became a rendezvous for many businessmen ; it was at the Dorchester that British Petroleum formed a joint <unk> Committee with ICI in 1943 . 
 During the Second World War , the strength of its construction gave the hotel the reputation of being one of London 's safest buildings . On its opening , Sir Malcolm McAlpine declared it to be " bomb @-@ proof , earthquake @-@ proof and fireproof , " and the only damage inflicted on the building by the Luftwaffe during the war was several broken windows . Some felt the communal air @-@ raid shelter in the basement to be insufficiently exclusive and retreated to the hotel 's underground gymnasium and Turkish baths , which had been converted into a shelter by Victor Cazalet . Its wartime clientele included such political and military luminaries as Lord Halifax ( Foreign Minister ) , Oliver Stanley ( Minister for War ) , Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Portal ( Chief of the Air Staff ) , Duff Cooper ( with his wife Lady Diana Cooper ) , Oliver Lyttleton ( President of the Board of Trade ) and Duncan Sandys ( Financial Secretary to the War Office ) . Halifax and his wife took eight rooms as well as a chapel in the hotel , and when possible he enjoyed trysts with his mistress , Alexandra " Baba " Metcalfe , who was also staying in the hotel and concurrently having an affair with Dino Grandi , Mussolini 's representative in London . General Dwight D. Eisenhower took a suite on the first floor ( now the Eisenhower Suite ) in 1942 after having previously stayed at Claridge 's and in 1944 made it his headquarters ; Kay <unk> , his chauffeur and purported mistress , and Roosevelt ’ s representative Averell Harriman also stayed there thanks to its reputation as a safe haven . During a dinner party which Harriman attended in the Dorchester , the bombing was so intense that guests came down to join him there as it was safer than in the upper @-@ floor rooms . Bostonian Sherry Mangan of Time was one of several American correspondents who stayed at the hotel during the war , meeting the Trotskyist Sam Gordon in 1944 who asked if the Dorchester was safe from air raids , to which Mangan assured him that " every fifth columnist in London is staying here " . Other of the hotel 's guests reflected the directors ' wide @-@ ranging political beliefs : it was at once the base for the Zionist movement 's leaders , including Chaim Weizmann , as well as a group of upper @-@ class British anti @-@ Semites , including Margaret Greville . According to Cecil Beaton the clientele was a " mixed brew " ; to its wartime chronicler , it was " a building in which the respectable and the dubious mixed by the thousand , knocking back cocktails and indulging in careless talk " . In March 1945 , Ernest Hemingway and Time correspondent and lover Mary Welsh stayed at the Dorchester , where they were entertained by Emerald , Lady Cunard , who had a three @-@ room suite on the seventh floor . 
 = = = Post @-@ war = = = 
 In 1949 , the 150th anniversary of Alexander Pushkin 's birth was organized at the hotel by the Society of Cultural Relations with the USSR , attended by the Soviet chargé d 'affaires , the Polish ambassador , the Romanian minister , and Cecil Day @-@ Lewis , raising <unk> 's suspicions that he still had communist sympathies , a contention he later denounced . In the post @-@ war period , the Dorchester became one of the most popular hotels in London for actors and entertainers , and the banqueting rooms and suites became known for their press conferences and parties . Diners at the Dorchester included Cyril Connolly , T. S. Eliot , Harold Nicolson , and Edith Sitwell , with a clientele of luminaries such as Ralph Richardson , Elizabeth Taylor , Alfred Hitchcock , and Barbra Streisand . Queen Elizabeth II attended the Dorchester when she was a princess on the day prior to the announcement of her engagement to the Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh on 10 July 1947 . Prince Philip also held his stag night party at the hotel , which has been documented in a plaque . 
 When Said bin <unk> of Oman was ousted in a coup in July 1970 and replaced with his son Qaboos bin Said , he was sent in exile and lived at the Dorchester until his death in 1972 . The McAlpine family owned the hotel until 1977 when they sold it to a consortium of businessmen from the Middle East headed by the Sultan of Brunei . On 3 June 1982 , Shlomo Argov , the Israeli ambassador to the United Kingdom was shot and seriously injured in an assassination attempt as he left the Dorchester . The attack was the immediate cause for the 1982 Lebanon War . 
 In 1985 , the hotel was purchased by the Sultan of Brunei . The hotel is currently owned by the Dorchester Collection , which in turn is owned by the Brunei Investment Agency ( BIA ) , an arm of the Ministry of Finance of Brunei . The Dorchester Collection owns luxury hotels in the United Kingdom , the United States , France , Switzerland and Italy . In 1988 , the hotel closed for two years for a major refurbishment . 
 In June 1998 the brother of the Sultan of Brunei , Prince Jefri Bolkiah , was sued by his former business partners in a case that was settled out of court . During the case the <unk> claimed that Prince Jefri kept 40 prostitutes at a time at the Dorchester . In 1999 , the hotel hosted the first ever Pride of Britain Awards . In March 2002 , a robbery took place in the lobby of the hotel when thieves wearing ski masks smashed the jewelry cabinets with a sledgehammer and took off with jewels . The Dorchester celebrated its 80th anniversary in 2011 . To mark the event , the charity ‘ Trees for Cities ’ planted eighty ‘ future great trees ’ around the capital .

 The architectural style adopted by William Curtis Green , largely based on Owen William 's design , was a departure from the Neoclassical with its reinforced concrete covered over with terrazzo slabs . British Modernists were disappointed with the result , describing Green 's adaptation as , " a genteel period piece which looks the compromise it is " . In comparison to some of the other hotels in London such as the Lanesborough , the building 's exterior is unremarkable . It is eight storeys high aside from the ground floor , with the central bay containing three windows on each floor . Christopher Matthew has stated that he thinks of the Dorchester as a " rather American hotel " , not only because of the strong association with American actors such as Elizabeth Taylor , but because the sweeping 1930s facade reminded him of many of those which appeared in American film musicals . However , he notes that the hotel still remains " very much an English hotel " . The hotel became a Grade II Listed Building in January 1981 . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 The interior displays a " subtle amalgam of styles " , testament to the number of different designers involved over the years , including William Curtis Green , Oliver Ford , Alberto Pinto and Oliver Messel . Green designed the original interior which is still retained in part . Kim Einhorn believes that this fusion of style was achieved tastefully and has remarked that the Dorchester Hotel is " a good example of somewhere it may be better to add decor rather than completely re @-@ invent " . DK Eyewitness describes the Dorchester as " the epitome of the glamorous luxury hotel , with an outrageously lavish lobby and a star @-@ studded history " . Rooms include the Grill Room , the Ballroom , the Gold Room , the Crush Hall , the ( former ) Oriental Restaurant , and the Dorchester Bar . The Ballroom was built to accommodate some 1 @,@ 000 guests . Thomas <unk> Steen , in his book Remarkable hotels of Europe , describes the doors of the hotel , " Effectively set off by the ivory walls between the pilasters behind the row of Corinthian columns , the doorways are easily recognised as decorative masterpieces in their own right : dominated by stuccoed , classic pediments decorated with friezes and gilded details , these impressive portals , with either double or single , richly panelled Georgian mahogany doors , make a regal link between the Promenade and Dorchester 's renowned , stunning banqueting rooms . " Gold leaf and marble remain distinct features of the public rooms of the hotel , including the restaurants , with features more reminiscent of an English country house than a hotel . Considerable efforts to make the rooms soundproof at the Dorchester were made from the outset ; the exterior walls were faced with cork , and the floors and ceilings of the bedrooms and suites were lined with compressed seaweed . Following renovation , the hotel was fitted with double glazing , and triple glazing on the Park Lane side to further improve soundproofing . 
 In the 1950s , theatrical designer Oliver Messel made a number of notable changes to the interior of the hotel . He incorporated aspects of theatrical design into the hotel interior , and designed the lavish apartments on the 7th and 8th floors . As Country Life documented , Messel 's rooms at the hotel " represents a rare glimpse into the world of mid @-@ 20th @-@ century interior design " , in which he drew upon his skills as a theatre designer to fill his rooms with " tricks of space and light , colour and period reference " . Today one of the suites is named after him , the Oliver Messel Suite . This suite displays a remarkable Georgian country house ambiance . Messel made the changes on the Deanery Side of the building in 1952 / 3 . Oliver Frederick Ford served as consultant designer from 1962 , decorating both the Stanhope Suite and the Orchid Room , a corner of which was completely re @-@ built and decorated in the English rococo style . He also remodelled the white , gold , and green entrance hall . The current dark green staff uniform of The Dorchester was designed in 1980 and is also attributed to Ford . 
 Between 1988 and 1990 , the hotel was completely renovated by Bob Lush of the Richmond Design Group at a cost of $ 100 million . The Promenade , Grill Room , and the Oliver Messel Suite were restored during the renovation . The Dorchester Spa is also designed in an Art Deco style , featuring , as Steen puts it , " elegant statues , engraved panels after René <unk> , blond maple woodwork , and a decorative pond with a group of small bronze foundations formed as water lilies producing gentle sounds of waterfall " . Liberace 's piano sits in the lobby . 
 As of 2012 , the Dorchester has 250 rooms and 49 suites . In the rooms , specially @-@ made Irish linen sheets cover the four poster beds , with cherry wood furnishings . The bath tubs , cited as " probably the deepest in London " , are made of Italian marble in the Art Deco style . All rooms in the hotel either provide views of Hyde Park or of its landscaped terraces . During the major renovation of 2002 , all rooms and suites were fitted with modern telecommunication systems . The hotel has its own floristry team , led by designer florist Philip Hammond , who are responsible for regularly updating the flowers on display in the hotel and providing their services for weddings and special occasions .

 The Dorchester has five restaurants : The Grill , Alain Ducasse , The Spatisserie , The Promenade , and China Tang , and three bars , two of which are in the last two restaurants . Employing 90 full @-@ time chefs , the hotel has long had a reputation for its cuisine , and chefs such as Jean Baptiste <unk> , Eugene <unk> , Willi <unk> and Anton <unk> have all run restaurants there . <unk> ran the Maitre Chef des Cuisines at the Dorchester for 13 years . <unk> , head chef during the Second World War , had to succumb to rationing and a national maximum @-@ price restriction of five shillings for a three @-@ course meal . 
 Alain Ducasse 's restaurant , Alain Ducasse at the Dorchester , holds three Michelin stars . When refurbished along with other parts of the hotel in 2007 , the redesign purposefully retained its 1940s influence . The restaurant serves contemporary French cuisine using seasonal French and British ingredients . The restaurant features a special table for up to six diners called the " Table Lumière " , lit by 4500 fibre optic lights . It is surrounded by a thin white curtain which allows diners at the table to view out into the restaurant but prevents other diners from viewing in . 
 The Grill restaurant , which serves British cuisine , is decorated in a Moorish theme , attributed to King Alfonso 's influence during his time in London in exile in the 1930s . The cream @-@ painted walls feature gilded gratings and mirrored arches and display a Flemish tapestry . The ceilings are ornate , featuring gold leaves and brass chandeliers , and the room also features deep red riveted leather chairs and deep red curtains , with a Middle Eastern @-@ looking exotic carpet . According to restaurant critic Jay Rayner , " when you drill down on the menu it ’ s what the faded gentry used to call high tea . It ’ s nursery food at stupid prices . " 
 The Promenade was refurbished in 1990 by Leslie Wright with a gilded ceiling and reliefs and brass lanterns , and was altered again in 2005 by Thierry <unk> , who fitted it with an oval leather bar ; it forms the grand entrance and has a length which is equal to that of Nelson 's Column . Piano music is played throughout much of the day , with live jazz from 19 : 30 . Afternoon tea , a tradition which has taken place at the hotel since its opening in 1931 , is served every day of the week at five in the afternoon in the large Promenade and the Spatisserie , with guests seated in decorative upholstered sofas with low tables placed in front of them . The tables are set with elegant silver cutlery and crockery , with Corinthian columns made of marble , glittering chandeliers , French tapestries and potted plants in the background . Tea is served by waiters dressed in English @-@ style long coats . Hollywood actor Charlton Heston , a frequent guest at the hotel , once commented on the aspect of service at the hotel : “ The cooks and bakers , the clerks and porters , the maids and the flower ladies , the bell men are the hotel ” . 
 The choice of tea offered to the guests is diverse , and includes the hotel 's own Dorchester Blend . The service includes a first course consisting of finger sandwiches with sliced cucumber , cream cheese , and smoked salmon , all served in silver trays , a second course consisting of scones with clotted cream and jam , followed by a pastry tray with a selection of freshly @-@ made <unk> . 
 China Tang is owned by the businessman David Tang and was opened in 2005 . The restaurant is luxuriously designed , with an art deco lounge bar reminiscent of 1930s Shanghai . The Spatisserie is an informal restaurant , which specialises in light snacks and afternoon tea , serving cakes , biscuits and pastries . 
 The Dorchester Bar was initially rebuilt in 1938 and was run by Harry Craddock , one of the world 's most famous <unk> of the period , known for his Martini , Manhattan and White Lady cocktails . Craddock invented the " Dorchester of London " cocktail here in the 1930s . The bar was refurbished in 1979 . It was designed by Alberto Pinto with bleached wood , Provençale blue and white ceramic picture panels , and a mirrored ceiling . As of 2012 , the bar is curved and is furnished with rich " blacks , browns and aubergine – combined with lacquered mahogany , mirrored glass and velvet " . In the evenings , jazz is played in the bar . As of 2002 , the Dorchester had 460 different wines in stock .

 The hotel has continued to be associated with actors , rock stars and people in entertainment . Numerous film actors and people have auditioned , been interviewed or have stayed at the Dorchester over the years , and it is strongly associated with cinema , particularly American film . From the 1940s onwards the Dorchester was a common rendezvous for film producers , actors and casting agents . In 1940 , Gabriel Pascal and David Lean used Pascal 's hotel suite as the casting location for the movie Major Barbara ; Deborah Kerr , who auditioned for the film , said of it : " How bizarre it was . This room full of chaps smoking enormous cigars and drinking martinis and this young girl reciting the Lords ' Prayer . " In the 1940s , producer Earl St. John was found drunk at the hotel ; writer and co @-@ producer Eric Ambler promptly sent him back to John Davis in a taxi with a board around his neck with the words " Return to John Davis with compliments " . Ray Bradbury stayed at the hotel during the filming of Moby Dick ( 1956 ) . In 1964 , John Lennon was invited to attend one of the Foyle Literary Luncheons after he received acclaim for his book In His Own Write . John and Cynthia had not realised the notability of the event and attended with a hangover , with Lennon disappointing the crowd which had gathered at the Dorchester who were expecting a speech , simply muttering " Thank you very much , it 's been a pleasure " . Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor were regulars at the hotel throughout the 1960s and 1970s and spent their honeymoon in the Oliver Messel suite in March 1964 . Burton was interviewed in his suite while promoting The Wild Geese in 1978 . 
 The hotel has also hosted many footballers attending the F.A. Cup Finals over the years , and in 1961 Leicester City players checked in before playing Tottenham Hotspur . Taylor and Burton were staying there at the time . In 1972 , Raquel Welch visited Stamford Bridge and invited the Chelsea Football Club team back to a cocktail party at the Dorchester , which was also attended by the Rolling Stones . In 2003 , Ken Bates agreed to sell Chelsea Football Club to Roman Abramovich after they met for 20 minutes at the hotel . On 28 August 2007 , an honorary dinner for Nelson Mandela was held at the Dorchester on the eve of the unveiling of his statue on Parliament Square . It was also at a Dorchester suite that actor Christian Bale was alleged to have assaulted his mother and sister shortly before The Dark Knight premiere in July 2008 and was subsequently arrested . In 2014 numerous celebrities started boycotting the hotel due to its links to the introduction of Sharia Law in Brunei , which most famously includes the death penalty for homosexuality .

 <unk> Benjamin Mahendran ( 20 May 1939 – 13 February 2014 ) , commonly known as Balu Mahendra , was a Sri Lankan cinematographer , director , screenwriter and film editor , who worked in various Indian film industries , primarily in Tamil cinema . Born into a Sri Lankan Tamil household , Mahendra developed a passion towards photography and literature at a young age . He was drawn towards film @-@ making after witnessing the shoot of David Lean 's The Bridge on the River Kwai ( 1957 ) in Sri Lanka . A graduate of the London University , he started his career as a draughtsman before gaining an admission to the Film and Television Institute of India ( FTII ) to pursue a course in cinematography . Mahendra entered films as a cinematographer in the early 1970s and gradually rose to becoming a film @-@ maker by the end of the decade . 
 Making his directorial debut through the Kannada film Kokila ( 1977 ) , Mahendra made over 20 films in all South Indian languages and two in Hindi . He was one of the earliest film @-@ makers in Tamil cinema to introduce realism and helped revitalise the industry . At the tail end of his career , he established a film school in Chennai which offers courses in cinematography , direction and acting . Following a brief phase of poor health , Mahendra died of cardiac arrest in February 2014 . 
 Widely regarded as an auteur , Mahendra wrote the script for his films , handled the camera and edited the film himself apart from directing . He was the recipient of six National Film Awards — including two for Best Cinematography , three Filmfare Awards South , and several state awards from the governments of Kerala , Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh .

 Mahendra was born in 1939 into a Sri Lankan Tamil family in the village <unk> near Batticaloa , Sri Lanka . Born to a professor father , he did his schooling at Methodist Central College and St. Michael 's College , Batticaloa . As a teenager , he was drawn towards films by his class teacher . It was during this time he happened to see Bicycle Thieves ( 1948 ) and Battleship Potemkin ( 1925 ) . When he was at the sixth grade , he got an opportunity to witness the making of David Lean 's The Bridge on the River Kwai ( shot in Sri Lanka ) during a school field trip . Inspired by Lean 's personality , Mahendra determined to become a film @-@ maker . 
 Right from his childhood , Mahendra was interested in fine arts and literature . Upon completion of school , he joined the London University and graduated with a bachelor 's degree ( honours ) in science . After his graduation , he returned to Sri Lanka and worked in Colombo as a draughtsman in the survey department for a brief period during which he edited a Tamil literary magazine titled <unk> <unk> . In Colombo , he worked as an amateur drama artist with Radio Ceylon and got acquainted with the Sinhala theatre groups . 
 Mahendra 's passion for cinema prompted him to leave for India and join the Film and Television Institute of India , Pune in 1966 . He had to take up cinematography as he could not gain admissions to other disciplines . At the institute he was exposed to world cinema as he got an opportunity to watch films made by François Truffaut and Jean @-@ Luc Godard , both associated with the French New Wave movement . In 1969 , Mahendra graduated from the institute with a gold medal .

 As a fresh graduate from the FTII , Mahendra 's early attempts to enter Tamil cinema were unsuccessful . He got his first break as a cinematographer in 1971 in the Malayalam film Nellu . Ramu Kariat , the director of Nellu , was impressed by A View from the Fortress , Mahendra 's diploma film at the FTII . Though the filming of Nellu began in 1971 , production delays postponed its release for three years . Meanwhile , Kariat signed up Mahendra for another film titled Maaya which released in 1972 . However , P. N. Menon 's <unk> ( 1972 ) got released before Maaya , thus becoming Mahendra 's first release . He continued to work in Malayalam films such as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( 1973 ) , <unk> ( 1973 ) and <unk> ( 1974 ) . 
 Nellu , shot in colour , won the Kerala State Film Award for Best Cinematography after it was released in 1974 . Mahendra had continued successes with films such as <unk> ( 1975 ) and <unk> <unk> ( 1975 ) , both fetching the state award for best photography to him for the second consecutive time . Between 1971 and 1976 , he worked in about 20 films — mostly in Malayalam — as a cinematographer . The following year he made his directorial debut with Kokila . Made in Kannada , the film was a " triangular love story " . In addition to a Best Screenplay award from the Karnataka government , Mahendra won his first National Film Award for Best Cinematography for the film . The film was both critically acclaimed and commercially successful . It was equally successful in the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu and has the distinction of being the only Kannada film to complete 150 days in Madras ( now Chennai ) as of 2014 .

 Despite being a Tamil , it was not until 1978 he worked in a Tamil film when he signed up as the cinematographer for J. Mahendran 's directorial debut Mullum Malarum ( 1978 ) . Apart from handling the cinematography , Mahendra involved himself in other aspects such as screenwriting , casting , editing and direction in the film . After completing Mullum Malarum , Mahendra decided to work on his second directorial venture , this time in Tamil . He named the film <unk> Kolangal ( 1979 ) , which according to him was " partly autobiographical " . Inspired from the 1971 American film Summer of ' 42 , <unk> Kolangal was a coming @-@ of @-@ age film that dealt with the story of three adolescent boys who are in the awakening of sexuality . Although it was controversial for its theme , it was a box @-@ office success . During this time he did the cinematography of K. Vishwanath 's Telugu film Sankarabharanam ( 1979 ) which turned out to be a major critical and commercial success . 
 Mahendra 's third film as director Moodu Pani ( 1980 ) was loosely based on Alfred Hitchcock 's 1960 film Psycho . Moodu Pani saw Mahendra collaborating with Ilaiyaraaja for the first time ; Ilaiyaraaja was Mahendra 's regular composer since then . In 1982 , Mahendra made Moondram Pirai which had Kamal Haasan and Sridevi in the lead . The film told the story of a school teacher who looks after a girl suffering from amnesia . It had a 300 @-@ day run in the theatres and was labelled a " blockbuster " . The film fetched two National Film Awards including an award for cinematography for Mahendra . The same year he made Olangal ( 1982 ) which marked his directorial debut in Malayalam . Inspired from Erich Segal 's novel Man , Woman and Child , the film was a critical success . At the end of the year , Mahendra won two Filmfare trophies for directing Olangal and Moondram Pirai . 
 In 1983 , Mahendra entered Hindi cinema with Sadma , a remake of Moondram Pirai , with Kamal Hasan and Sridevi reprising their roles . Mahendra received a Filmfare nomination for Best Story and became a well @-@ known director with the Hindi audience with the film . The same year , he worked as the cinematographer of the Kannada film Pallavi Anu Pallavi , Mani Ratnam 's debut film . During this time , he made his second film in Malayalam titled <unk> . Unlike Olangal , <unk> failed to create an impact among the audience .

 During the mid 1980s , Mahendra concentrated on mainstream films . The first of which <unk> <unk> ( 1984 ) was labelled an outright commercial picture . Later Mahendra noted that he made the film with a sole intention to prove critics that he could make commercial films . The following year , he collaborated with Rajinikanth to make Un <unk> Neer <unk> which turned out to be a commercial failure . He then worked on the Malayalam film Yathra ( 1985 ) with Mammooty in the lead role as a forest officer . Made with " artistic values " the film earned ₹ 1 @.@ 9 million ( equivalent to ₹ 20 million or US $ 290 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) and was the highest @-@ grossing Malayalam film that year . By this time , he declined an offer to direct the Kannada film Malaya <unk> ( 1986 ) . As a director who is known for making intense films , critics were surprised when he made <unk> Vaal Kuruvi ( 1987 ) , a full @-@ length comedy film . Closely based on the 1984 American film Micki and Maude , the film is regarded as one of the best comedies ever made in Tamil cinema during the decade . The film would serve as a base for his future films Marupadiyum ( 1993 ) and Sathi Leelavathi ( 1995 ) which explored similar themes . 
 Towards the end of the decade , Mahendra made two low @-@ budgeted films — Veedu ( 1988 ) and Sandhya Raagam ( 1989 ) . While Veedu focused on the life of a lower middle @-@ class urban woman and her struggle to build a house , Sandhya Raagam dealt with " old age " . At the 35th , Veedu won two National Film Awards — including one for Best Regional Film — and Sandhya Raagam won the Best Film on Family Welfare two years later . According to Mahendra , both the films were a tribute to his mother and father respectively . He named these two films as his best works as they were made with fewest mistakes and compromises . 
 In 1992 , Mahendra made Vanna Vanna <unk> which was produced by S. <unk> . The film had a 100 @-@ day run and won the award for the " Best Regional Film " at the 39th National Film Awards . During this time M. Night Shyamalan , then a newcomer , approached Mahendra to be the cinematographer for his directorial debut Praying with Anger to which he refused . The next year , he remade Mahesh Bhatt 's Arth in Tamil as Marupadiyum . Mahendra made the film as he felt it was close to his personal life . He then came up with a full @-@ length comedy Sathi Leelavathi in 1995 which was produced by Kamal Haasan . The following year , he made a comeback in Bollywood through Aur Ek Prem Kahani , a remake of his Kannada film Kokila . He then made Raman Abdullah ( 1997 ) — a remake of the Malayalam film Malappuram Haji <unk> Joji ( 1994 ) — which deals with a friendship between two friends belonging to different religions . The film 's shoot became the epicentre of a dispute that arose between the Tamil Film Producers Council and Film Employees Federation of South India ( FEFSI ) . It was reported that members of FEFSI had stopped the filming of Raman Abdullah as Mahendra was engaging outside cast members in the film . This led FEFSI to go for an indefinite strike which affected to the delaying of several Tamil films . The film received negative reviews and failed at the box @-@ office . 
 After Raman Abdullah , Mahendra took a break from films during which he made Kathai Neram , a television series based on different short stories , mostly by Sujatha . It was aired in Sun TV during the early 2000s . 
 = = = Final years = = = 
 Following a five @-@ year sabbatical , he returned with Julie Ganapathi ( 2003 ) . The film was based on the psychological thriller novel Misery by Stephen King . According to Mahendra , Julie Ganapathi was made on the lines of his previous films Moondram Pirai ( 1982 ) and Moodu Pani ( 1980 ) . A review from Rediff.com stated , " Balu Mahendra has kept the flag of sensible cinema within the commercial format once again in his latest offering Julie Ganapathy " and rated the film as one of the best thrillers ever made . In spite of being a critical success , the film turned out to be a commercial failure . For his next film <unk> Oru Kana <unk> ( 2005 ) , he decided to cast Dhanush in the lead role . Initially he stated that the film to be an extension of his 1979 film Azhiyatha Kolangal . However , he ended up making a different film . The film was loosely based on his own Malayalam film Yathra released in 1985 . When asked about the difference between the two films , he said " Yat [ h ] ra was the love story of two adults , this is the love story of two adolescents . " Shobha Warrier of Rediff.com wrote that the film was " extremely disappointing " . 
 In 2007 , he started a film school named " Cinema <unk> " in Chennai . The institute offers courses in disciplines such as cinematography , direction and acting . After a brief hiatus from films , he made a comeback through Thalaimuraigal ( 2013 ) , which marked his acting debut . Apart from acting , he also scripted , directed , edited and served as the cinematographer of the film . The film was about the relationship between an ageing man and his grandson . The film received positive response with Mahendra 's acting being well acclaimed . Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu stated , " If Mahendra 's aim was to make a film that can compete on a global level , Thalaimuraigal is a concrete step in that direction . " Despite being critically acclaimed , the film was a commercial failure . At the 61st National Film Awards , it won the Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Mahendra was married thrice . He was first married to <unk> with whom he had a son . His relationship with actress Shoba ended in 1980 after she committed suicide following their marriage . Upon Shoba 's death , the media speculated that it was not a suicide and further added that Mahendra was responsible for her death . In 1985 , a case was filed against him and <unk> as they were " illegally " staying in India ; both suffered four months of imprisonment for illegal immigration . However , the court after a few months dismissed the plea saying that his stay had " enriched " the Tamil culture as he had made significant contributions to Tamil cinema . Following that , Mahendra wrote a series of " sentimental musings " in the Tamil magazine Kumudam under the title <unk> <unk> ( Shoba and me ) . Their relationship was later explored in the 1983 Malayalam film <unk> <unk> Oru Flashback by its director K. G. George . However , when the film was released , Mahendra in an interview said that he has nothing to do with the film and has not discussed about it with George . In 1998 , he married another actress <unk> and declared their marriage publicly in 2004 . 
 Following a heart attack on 13 February 2014 , Mahendra was admitted to Vijaya Hospital in Chennai where he was declared dead after six hours of cardiac arrest . Shortly after the news of his death , members of the Indian film industry posted their condolences in Twitter and Facebook . The Tamil film fraternity mourned the death and paid homage to him at his " film school " in <unk> , Chennai , and decided not to work on the following day as a sign of respect . The last rites of Mahendra were performed at <unk> crematorium on the same day . 
 = = Style and legacy = = 
 As a photographer , Mahendra was inspired by the works of French New Wave cinematographers such as Néstor <unk> and Michael Chapman . Among his contemporaries , he admired the works of Ashok Kumar . Mahendra believed a " well @-@ photographed movie is that which is very close to the script " . As a film @-@ maker , he claims himself as belonging to the realistic way of story @-@ telling devised by Satyajit Ray and Vittorio De Sica . Mahendra was drawn towards realistic cinema after watching Ray 's Pather Panchali ( 1955 ) . He is credited as being one among the earliest filmmakers to bring " naturalism " in Tamil cinema in the 1970s . He usually photographed , scripted and edited all his films . His films were characterised by strong " visual appeal " and minimal number of characters . A majority of his films centre on the complexity of human relationships and are known to portray women as strong characters . Although influenced by realism , his films Moodu Pani , <unk> Vaal Kuruvi and Julie Ganapathi heavily borrowed from American cinema . 
 Mahendra was equally praised for his cinematography and directorial finesse . Described by the media as " one of the finest cinematographers of Indian cinema " , he was among the first to pioneer innovative colour in South India . Subrata Mitra , the cinematographer of Ray , presented a viewfinder to Mahendra acknowledging his talent . Fellow cinematographer Madhu <unk> described that it was Mahendra who gave " fame " to those cameramen who came out of the FTII , and further noted that he was one of the few film @-@ makers who effectively used romantic realism . Lauded for usage of " natural lighting " , Mahendra was considered as " one of the few filmmakers in Tamil who believes in telling a story visually " . Kamal Haasan described that he was one of the few directors who balanced between art and popular cinema . As a film @-@ maker , he inspired contemporary actors and film @-@ makers such as Mani Ratnam , Kamal Haasan and Sripriya , He has mentored next generation film @-@ makers including Bala , Ameer , <unk> , Ram and Seenu Ramasamy . Cinematographers like Santosh Sivan , Ravi K. Chandran , Natarajan Subramaniam and K. V. Anand have taken inspirations from him . The negatives of his acclaimed films — Moodu Pani , Veedu , Sandhya Raagam , Marupadiyum and Sathi Leelavathi — are lost .

 Birmingham ( / <unk> / ) is a major city and metropolitan borough in the West Midlands of England . It is the largest and most populous British city outside London , with a population in 2014 of 1 @,@ 101 @,@ 360 . The city is in the West Midlands Built @-@ up Area , the third most populous urban area in the United Kingdom , with a population of 2 @,@ 440 @,@ 986 at the 2011 census . Birmingham is the second most populous metropolitan area in the UK with a population of 3 @.@ 8 million . This also makes Birmingham the 9th most populous metropolitan area in Europe . 
 A medium @-@ sized market town in the medieval period , Birmingham grew to international prominence in the 18th century at the heart of the Midlands Enlightenment and subsequent Industrial Revolution , which saw the town at the forefront of worldwide advances in science , technology and economic development , producing a series of innovations that laid many of the foundations of modern industrial society . By 1791 it was being hailed as " the first manufacturing town in the world " . Birmingham 's distinctive economic profile , with thousands of small workshops practising a wide variety of specialised and highly skilled trades , encouraged exceptional levels of creativity and innovation and provided a diverse and resilient economic base for industrial prosperity that was to last into the final quarter of the 20th century . Perhaps the most important invention in British history , the industrial steam engine , was invented in Birmingham . Its resulting high level of social mobility also fostered a culture of broad @-@ based political radicalism , that under leaders from Thomas Attwood to Joseph Chamberlain was to give it a political influence unparalleled in Britain outside London , and a pivotal role in the development of British democracy . From the summer of 1940 to the spring of 1943 , Birmingham was bombed heavily by the German Luftwaffe in what is known as the Birmingham Blitz . The damage done to the city 's infrastructure , in addition to a deliberate policy of demolition and new building by planners , led to extensive demolition and redevelopment in subsequent decades . 
 Today Birmingham 's economy is dominated by the service sector . The city is a major international commercial centre , ranked as a beta − world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ; and an important transport , retail , events and conference hub . Its metropolitan economy is the second largest in the United Kingdom with a GDP of $ <unk> ( 2014 ) , and its six universities make it the largest centre of higher education in the country outside London . Birmingham 's major cultural institutions – including the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra , the Birmingham Royal Ballet , the Birmingham Repertory Theatre , the Library of Birmingham and the Barber Institute of Fine Arts – enjoy international reputations , and the city has vibrant and influential grassroots art , music , literary and culinary scenes . Birmingham is the fourth @-@ most visited city in the UK by foreign visitors . 
 Birmingham 's sporting heritage can be felt worldwide , with the concept of the Football League and lawn tennis both originating from the city . Its most successful football club Aston Villa has won seven league titles and one European Cup with the other professional club being Birmingham City . 
 People from Birmingham are called <unk> , a term derived from the city 's nickname of Brum . This originates from the city 's dialect name , <unk> , which may in turn have been derived from one of the city 's earlier names , <unk> . There is a distinctive Brummie accent and dialect . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Pre @-@ history and medieval = = = 
 Birmingham 's early history is that of a remote and marginal area . The main centres of population , power and wealth in the pre @-@ industrial English Midlands lay in the fertile and accessible river valleys of the Trent , the Severn and the Avon . The area of modern Birmingham lay in between , on the upland Birmingham Plateau and within the densely wooded and sparsely populated Forest of Arden . 
 There is evidence of early human activity in the Birmingham area dating back 10 @,@ 000 years , with stone age artefacts suggesting seasonal settlements , overnight hunting parties and woodland activities such as tree felling . The many burnt mounds that can still be seen around the city indicate that modern humans first intensively settled and cultivated the area during the bronze age , when a substantial but short @-@ lived influx of population occurred between 1700 BC and 1000 BC , possibly caused by conflict or immigration in the surrounding area . During the 1st @-@ century Roman conquest of Britain , the forested country of the Birmingham Plateau formed a barrier to the advancing Roman legions , who built the large <unk> Fort in the area of modern @-@ day Edgbaston in AD 48 , and made it the focus of a network of Roman roads . 
 Birmingham as a settlement dates from the Anglo @-@ Saxon era . The city 's name comes from the Old English <unk> , meaning the home or settlement of the <unk> – indicating that Birmingham was established in the 6th or early 7th century as the primary settlement of an Anglian tribal grouping and regio of that name . Despite this early importance , by the time of the Domesday Book of 1086 the manor of Birmingham was one of the poorest and least populated in Warwickshire , valued at only 20 shillings , with the area of the modern city divided between the counties of Warwickshire , Staffordshire and Worcestershire . 
 The development of Birmingham into a significant urban and commercial centre began in 1166 , when the Lord of the Manor Peter de Bermingham obtained a charter to hold a market at his castle , and followed this with the creation of a planned market town and seigneurial borough within his demesne or manorial estate , around the site that became the Bull Ring . This established Birmingham as the primary commercial centre for the Birmingham Plateau at a time when the area 's economy was expanding rapidly , with population growth nationally leading to the clearance , cultivation and settlement of previously marginal land . Within a century of the charter Birmingham had grown into a prosperous urban centre of merchants and craftsmen . By 1327 it was the third @-@ largest town in Warwickshire , a position it would retain for the next 200 years . 
 = = = Early modern = = = 
 The principal governing institutions of medieval Birmingham – including the Guild of the Holy Cross and the lordship of the de Birmingham family – collapsed between 1536 and 1547 , leaving the town with an unusually high degree of social and economic freedom and initiating a period of transition and growth . By 1700 Birmingham 's population had increased <unk> and the town was the fifth @-@ largest in England and Wales . 
 The importance of the manufacture of iron goods to Birmingham 's economy was recognised as early as 1538 , and grew rapidly as the century progressed . Equally significant was the town 's emerging role as a centre for the iron merchants who organised finance , supplied raw materials and traded and marketed the industry 's products . By the 1600s Birmingham formed the commercial hub of a network of forges and furnaces stretching from South Wales to Cheshire and its merchants were selling finished manufactured goods as far afield as the West Indies . These trading links gave Birmingham 's metalworkers access to much wider markets , allowing them to diversify away from lower @-@ skilled trades producing basic goods for local sale , towards a broader range of specialist , higher @-@ skilled and more lucrative activities . 
 By the time of the English Civil War Birmingham 's booming economy , its expanding population , and its resulting high levels of social mobility and cultural pluralism , had seen it develop new social structures very different from those of more established areas . Relationships were built around pragmatic commercial linkages rather than the rigid paternalism and deference of feudal society , and loyalties to the traditional hierarchies of the established church and aristocracy were weak . The town 's reputation for political radicalism and its strongly Parliamentarian sympathies saw it attacked by Royalist forces in the Battle of Birmingham in 1643 , and it developed into a centre of Puritanism in the 1630s and as a haven for Nonconformists from the 1660s . 
 The 18th century saw this tradition of free @-@ thinking and collaboration blossom into the cultural phenomenon now known as the Midlands Enlightenment . The town developed into a notable centre of literary , musical , artistic and theatrical activity ; and its leading citizens – particularly the members of the Lunar Society of Birmingham – became influential participants in the circulation of philosophical and scientific ideas among Europe 's intellectual elite . The close relationship between Enlightenment Birmingham 's leading thinkers and its major manufacturers – in men like Matthew Boulton and James Keir they were often in fact the same people – made it particularly important for the exchange of knowledge between pure science and the practical world of manufacturing and technology . This created a " chain reaction of innovation " , forming a pivotal link between the earlier Scientific Revolution and the Industrial Revolution that would follow . 
 = = = Industrial Revolution = = = 
 Birmingham 's explosive industrial expansion started earlier than that of the textile @-@ manufacturing towns of the North of England , and was driven by different factors . Instead of the economies of scale of a low @-@ paid , unskilled workforce producing a single bulk commodity such as cotton or wool in large , mechanised units of production , Birmingham 's industrial development was built on the adaptability and creativity of a highly paid workforce with a strong division of labour , practising a broad variety of skilled specialist trades and producing a constantly diversifying range of products , in a highly entrepreneurial economy of small , often self @-@ owned workshops . This led to exceptional levels of inventiveness : between 1760 and 1850 – the core years of the Industrial Revolution – Birmingham residents registered over three times as many patents as those of any other British town or city . 
 The demand for capital to feed rapid economic expansion also saw Birmingham grow into a major financial centre with extensive international connections . Lloyds Bank was founded in the town in 1765 , and Ketley 's Building Society , the world 's first building society , in 1775 . By 1800 the West Midlands had more banking offices per head than any other region in Britain , including London . 
 Innovation in 18th @-@ century Birmingham often took the form of incremental series of small @-@ scale improvements to existing products or processes , but also included major developments that lay at the heart of the emergence of industrial society . In 1709 the Birmingham @-@ trained Abraham Darby I moved to Coalbrookdale in Shropshire and built the first blast furnace to successfully smelt iron ore with coke , transforming the quality , volume and scale on which it was possible to produce cast iron . In 1732 Lewis Paul and John Wyatt invented roller spinning , the " one novel idea of the first importance " in the development of the mechanised cotton industry . In 1741 they opened the world 's first cotton mill in Birmingham 's Upper Priory . In 1746 John Roebuck invented the lead chamber process , enabling the large @-@ scale manufacture of sulphuric acid , and in 1780 James Keir developed a process for the bulk manufacture of alkali , together marking the birth of the modern chemical industry . In 1765 Matthew Boulton opened the Soho Manufactory , pioneering the combination and mechanisation under one roof of previously separate manufacturing activities through a system known as " rational manufacture " . As the largest manufacturing unit in Europe this come to symbolise the emergence of the factory system . 
 Most significant , however , was the development in 1776 of the industrial steam engine by James Watt and Matthew Boulton . Freeing for the first time the manufacturing capacity of human society from the limited availability of hand , water and animal power , this was arguably the pivotal moment of the entire industrial revolution and a key factor in the worldwide increases in productivity that would follow over the following century .

 Birmingham rose to national political prominence in the campaign for political reform in the early 19th century , with Thomas Attwood and the Birmingham Political Union bringing the country to the brink of civil war during the Days of May that preceded the passing of the Great Reform Act in 1832 . The Union 's meetings on Newhall Hill in 1831 and 1832 were the largest political assemblies Britain had ever seen . Lord Durham , who drafted the Act , wrote that " the country owed Reform to Birmingham , and its salvation from revolution " . This reputation for having " shaken the fabric of privilege to its base " in 1832 led John Bright to make Birmingham the platform for his successful campaign for the Second Reform Act of 1867 , which extended voting rights to the urban working class . 
 Birmingham 's tradition of innovation continued into the 19th century . Birmingham was the terminus for both of the world 's first two long @-@ distance railway lines : the 82 mile Grand Junction Railway of 1837 and the 112 mile London and Birmingham Railway of 1838 . Birmingham schoolteacher Rowland Hill invented the postage stamp and created the first modern universal postal system in 1839 . Alexander Parkes invented the first man @-@ made plastic in the Jewellery Quarter in 1855 . 
 By the 1820s , an extensive canal system had been constructed , giving greater access to natural resources and fuel for industries . During the Victorian era , the population of Birmingham grew rapidly to well over half a million and Birmingham became the second largest population centre in England . Birmingham was granted city status in 1889 by Queen Victoria . Joseph Chamberlain , mayor of Birmingham and later an MP , and his son Neville Chamberlain , who was Lord Mayor of Birmingham and later the British Prime Minister , are two of the most well @-@ known political figures who have lived in Birmingham . The city established its own university in 1900 . 
 = = = 20th century and contemporary = = = 
 Birmingham suffered heavy bomb damage during World War II 's " Birmingham Blitz " . The city was also the scene of two scientific discoveries that were to prove critical to the outcome of the war . Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls first described how a practical nuclear weapon could be constructed in the Frisch – Peierls memorandum of 1940 , the same year that the cavity magnetron , the key component of radar and later of microwave ovens , was invented by John Randall and Henry Boot . Details of these two discoveries , together with an outline of the first jet engine invented by Frank Whittle in nearby Rugby , were taken to the United States by the Tizard Mission in September 1940 , in a single black box later described by an official American historian as " the most valuable cargo ever brought to our shores " . 
 The city was extensively redeveloped during the 1950s and 1960s . This included the construction of large tower block estates , such as Castle Vale . The Bull Ring was reconstructed and New Street station was redeveloped . In the decades following World War II , the ethnic makeup of Birmingham changed significantly , as it received waves of immigration from the Commonwealth of Nations and beyond . The city 's population peaked in 1951 at 1 @,@ 113 @,@ 000 residents . 
 Birmingham remained by far Britain 's most prosperous provincial city as late as the 1970s , with household incomes exceeding even those of London and the South East , but its economic diversity and capacity for regeneration declined in the decades that followed World War II as Central Government sought to restrict the city 's growth and disperse industry and population to the stagnating areas of Scotland , Wales and Northern England . These measures hindered " the natural self @-@ regeneration of businesses in Birmingham , leaving it top @-@ heavy with the old and infirm " , and the city became increasingly dependent on the motor industry . The recession of the early 1980s saw Birmingham 's economy collapse , with unprecedented levels of unemployment and outbreaks of social unrest in inner @-@ city districts . 
 In recent years , many parts of Birmingham has been transformed , with the redevelopment of the Bullring Shopping Centre and regeneration of old industrial areas such as Brindleyplace , The Mailbox and the International Convention Centre . Old streets , buildings and canals have been restored , the pedestrian subways have been removed and the Inner Ring Road has been rationalised . In 1998 Birmingham hosted the 24th G8 summit .

 Birmingham 's ten parliamentary constituencies are represented in the House of Commons as of 2015 by one Conservative and nine Labour MPs . In the European Parliament the city forms part of the West Midlands European Parliament constituency , which elects six Members of the European Parliament . 
 Birmingham was originally part of Warwickshire , but expanded in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , absorbing parts of Worcestershire to the south and Staffordshire to the north and west . The city absorbed Sutton Coldfield in 1974 and became a metropolitan borough in the new West Midlands county . Until 1986 , the West Midlands County Council was based in Birmingham City Centre . 
 Since 2011 , Birmingham has formed part of the Greater Birmingham & Solihull Local Enterprise Partnership along with neighbouring authorities Bromsgrove , Cannock Chase , East Staffordshire , Lichfield , Redditch , Solihull , Tamworth , Wyre Forest . 
 A top @-@ level government body , the West Midlands Combined Authority , will be formed in April 2016 . The WMCA will gain devolved powers in transport , development planning , and economic growth . The authority will be governed by a directly @-@ elected Mayor , similar to the Mayor of London . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Birmingham is located in the centre of the West Midlands region of England on the Birmingham Plateau – an area of relatively high ground , ranging between 500 and 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 150 – 300 m ) above sea level and crossed by Britain 's main north @-@ south watershed between the basins of the Rivers Severn and Trent . To the south west of the city lie the Lickey Hills , Clent Hills and Walton Hill , which reach 1 @,@ 033 feet ( 315 m ) and have extensive views over the city . Birmingham is drained only by minor rivers and brooks , primarily the River Tame and its tributaries the Cole and the Rea . 
 The City of Birmingham forms a conurbation with the largely residential borough of Solihull to the south east , and with the city of Wolverhampton and the industrial towns of the Black Country to the north west , which form the West Midlands Built @-@ up Area covering 59 @,@ 972 ha ( 600 km2 ; 232 sq mi ) . Surrounding this is Birmingham 's metropolitan area – the area to which it is closely economically tied through commuting – which includes the former Mercian capital of Tamworth and the cathedral city of Lichfield in Staffordshire to the north ; the industrial city of Coventry and the Warwickshire towns of Nuneaton , Warwick and Leamington Spa to the east ; and the Worcestershire towns of Redditch and Bromsgrove to the south west . 
 Much of the area now occupied by the city was originally a northern reach of the ancient Forest of Arden , whose former presence can still be felt in the city 's dense oak tree @-@ cover and in the large number of districts such as Moseley , <unk> , Yardley , <unk> and Hockley with names ending in " <unk> " : the Old English <unk> meaning " woodland clearing " . 
 = = = Geology = = = 
 Geologically , Birmingham is dominated by the Birmingham Fault which runs diagonally through the city from the Lickey Hills in the south west , passing through Edgbaston and the Bull Ring , to Erdington and Sutton Coldfield in the north east . To the south and east of the fault the ground is largely softer Mercia Mudstone , interspersed with beds of Bunter pebbles and crossed by the valleys of the Rivers Tame , Rea and Cole and their tributaries . To the north and west of the fault , between 150 and 600 feet ( 45 – 180 m ) higher than the surrounding area and underlying much of the city centre , lies a long ridge of harder Keuper Sandstone . The bedrock underlying Birmingham was mostly laid down during the Permian and Triassic periods .

 = = Architecture = = 
 Birmingham is chiefly a product of the 18th , 19th and 20th centuries ; its growth began during the Industrial Revolution . Consequently , relatively few buildings survive from its earlier history and those that do are protected . There are 1 @,@ 946 listed buildings in Birmingham and thirteen scheduled ancient monuments . Birmingham City Council also operate a locally listing scheme for buildings that do not fully meet the criteria for statutorily listed status . 
 Traces of medieval Birmingham can be seen in the oldest churches , notably the original parish church , St Martin in the Bull Ring . A few other buildings from the medieval and Tudor periods survive , among them the Lad in the Lane and The Old Crown , the 15th century Saracen 's Head public house and Old Grammar School in Kings Norton and Blakesley Hall . 
 A number of Georgian buildings survive , including St Philip 's Cathedral , Soho House , Perrott 's Folly , the Town Hall and much of St Paul 's Square . The Victorian era saw extensive building across the city . Major civic buildings such as the Victoria Law Courts ( in characteristic red brick and terracotta ) , the Council House and the Museum & Art Gallery were constructed . St Chad 's Cathedral was the first Roman Catholic cathedral to be built in the UK since the Reformation . Across the city , the need to house the industrial workers gave rise to miles of redbrick streets and terraces , many of back @-@ to @-@ back houses , some of which were later to become inner @-@ city slums . 
 Postwar redevelopment and anti @-@ Victorianism resulted in the loss of dozens of Victorian buildings like Birmingham New Street Station and the old Central Library , often replaced by brutalist architecture . Sir Herbert Manzoni , City Engineer and Surveyor of Birmingham from 1935 until 1963 , believed conservation of old buildings was sentimental and that the city did not have any of worth anyway . In inner @-@ city areas too , much Victorian housing was demolished and redeveloped . Existing communities were relocated to tower block estates like Castle Vale . 
 In a partial reaction against the Manzoni years , Birmingham City Council is demolishing some of the brutalist buildings like the Central Library and has an extensive tower block demolition and renovation programme . There has been much redevelopment in the city centre in recent years , including the award @-@ winning Future Systems ' Selfridges building in the Bullring Shopping Centre , the Brindleyplace regeneration project , the Millennium Point science and technology centre , and the refurbishment of the iconic Rotunda building . Funding for many of these projects has come from the European Union ; the Town Hall for example received £ 3 million in funding from the European Regional Development Fund . 
 Highrise development has slowed since the 1970s and mainly in recent years because of enforcements imposed by the Civil Aviation Authority on the heights of buildings as they could affect aircraft from the Airport ( e.g. Beetham Tower ) . 
 = = Transport = =

 = Occupation ( Battlestar Galactica ) = 
 " Occupation " is the third season premiere and 34th episode of the re @-@ imagined American science fiction drama television series Battlestar Galactica . The episode was written by re @-@ imagined creator Ronald D. Moore , and directed by Sergio Mimica @-@ Gezzan . It first aired on October 6 , 2006 on the Sci @-@ Fi Channel along with the following episode " Precipice " . In the episode , the Cylons are in their fourth month of a military occupation on New Caprica , where the majority of the human population are residing . A resistance movement is trying to drive the Cylons away . Meanwhile , Admiral William Adama continues his plan to rescue everybody there . Unlike most episodes , it does not include a survivor count . 
 The story behind the episode was inspired by several wars and occupations in the past , including the Quartering Acts and the Iraq War . Several parts of the episode changed from the script , more predominantly the scenes involving a suicide bombing . The producers were worried that the Sci Fi Channel would not allow the inclusion of the scene . The episode was seen by 2 @.@ 2 million viewers and attracted generally positive reactions from critics . In addition , Moore 's writing of the episode was nominated for an Emmy and a Writers Guild of America award . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Four months have passed since the end of " Lay Down Your Burdens " , where Cylons found the majority of the human population on a planet known as New Caprica , which had supposedly been hidden from <unk> , and commenced their occupation . A few thousand humans had escaped in the remaining spaceships following <unk> Galactica and Pegasus . Admiral William Adama ( Edward James Olmos ) is continuing to work on a plan to free those trapped on New Caprica . His son and commander of Pegasus Lee " Apollo " Adama ( Jamie Bamber ) confronts his father on pushing his Viper pilots beyond the breaking point , to which Adama says Apollo is becoming " soft . " Apollo 's wife , Anastasia Dualla ( Kandyse McClure ) surprises him by supporting the Admiral . 
 On New Caprica , Kara " Starbuck " Thrace ( Katee Sackhoff ) is placed in an elaborate prison cell made to look like her old apartment on Caprica by Leoben Conoy ( Callum Keith Rennie ) , who is attempting to force her to fall in love with him . Starbuck kills him several times , though Leoben always downloads into another body . Saul Tigh ( Michael Hogan ) is in a Cylon detention facility , where his right eye was forcibly removed . He is released when his wife Ellen Tigh ( Kate Vernon ) performs sexual favors for the Cylon Brother Cavil ( Dean Stockwell ) . Tigh returns to Samuel Anders ( Michael Trucco ) and Galen Tyrol ( Aaron Douglas ) , who have been leading a resistance movement against the Cylons , having detonated a bomb in a Cylon docking facility before Tigh 's release . Now free , Tigh resorts to escalating their efforts , by planning suicide bombings against the Cylons and any human collaborators . 
 The resistance is given intelligence by an unidentified informant from the Cylon command structure , by use of a secret dead drop ; flipping a dog bowl and hiding some documents inside the tent next to it . One piece of intelligence given is information on a Cylon communications blocker ; the resistance makes use of that information to contact a Raptor orbiting the planet . The Raptor returns to Galactica with news they have made contact with the resistance on the planet . 
 Next , the resistance plans to kill the President of the Colonies , Gaius Baltar ( James Callis ) , who is unwillingly collaborating with the Cylons . They learn he is to attend a graduation ceremony for the New Caprica Police , an unpopular masked police force set up by the Cylons to allow the humans to police the city and do the Cylons ' bidding . Tucker " Duck " <unk> ( Christian Tessier ) , who has access to the ceremony and whose wife had been killed by the Cylons , agrees to suicide bomb the ceremony . Towards the end of the episode it is revealed that Baltar 's aide , Felix Gaeta ( Alessandro Juliani ) is the informant . He learns that Baltar will not be attending the ceremony , but cannot alert the resistance in time . Duck attends the ceremony , and when Number Three ( Lucy Lawless ) comes to shake his hand , Duck detonates the bomb , killing everybody in the room .

 " Occupation " , and following episode " Precipice " were written by series creator Ronald D. Moore . The Cylon occupation of New Caprica , and the human resistance fighting them , was inspired by wars and military occupations from history , including the Quartering Acts , World War II , and the more recent occupation in Iraq . In the original writing , Moore did not originally consider including Tigh with an eye removed until the final drafts were written . Portraying actor Michael Hogan was initially hesitant with the idea . He recalled that when the producers called him to talk about how his character would be maimed , they suggested having an eye removed . Hogan responded by laughing , and the producers assumed he agreed . 
 When Anders and Tyrol detonate the bomb at the beginning of the episode , one of the Number Three ( D <unk> ) models was to film a propaganda film in front of Laura Roslin 's ( Mary McDonnell ) school at the time , but that was cut . Also , Jammer ( Dominic <unk> ) was originally considered the suicide bomber at the end , but was changed to Duck because he had less to live for after his wife 's death . In the original drafts , the resistance was not planning suicide bombings , but " freaking the Cylons out " by imprisoning many of them in a secret underground prison , torture them for information , and leave them alive instead of killing them , as they would resurrect otherwise . This would make the Cylons worry about their missing comrades . However , Moore later realized that suicide bombings would be " really potent and really powerful . " When writing the scenes involving Duck leading to the suicide bombing , Moore got " emotionally caught up in it , " adding " as I was writing these scenes of him standing in the police ranks , we know he 's got the belt on . What 's he gonna do ? And then , oh my God , he actually does it . I mean , it 's really horrifying stuff . But it 's true . That 's why I want to do it . It really happens . People do this . " The producers were initially worried that the Sci Fi Channel would not allow the inclusion of the bombing scene , but to Moore 's surprise , Sci Fi executive Mark Stern did not object to it . 
 There was some debate among the writers on when Galactica and the fleet would be brought into the story . Moore decided to reintroduce the space @-@ bound fleet in the beginning of the third act , in order to establish the story on New Caprica , and make the audience happy and more excited to see Galactica . Moore also decided to evolve one of the Number Eight Cylon models , Sharon Agathon ( Grace Park ) imprisoned on board the ship , where a year would allow Sharon and Admiral Adama to form a special relationship , eventually leading to Adama releasing her and allowing her to become a Colonial officer by the next episode . Moore felt " Occupation " was the best season premiere of Battlestar since " 33 " , the first season premiere , believing the writers " never quite matched " the performance on " 33 " in the following episodes . He also felt it was a better premiere than " Scattered " from the second season , as it contained disparate story lines where the characters were not fully reunited with each other until a few episodes in . 
 = = = Filming and post @-@ production = = = 
 The episode began with one of the most extended recaps in the series , as the producers wanted to bring the audience up to date from the events from " Lay Down Your Burdens " , which covered " quite a bit of ground " because of the large story development behind the finale . The scene where the Cylons meet in Colonial One became very tedious for the crew because several versions of the same Cylon model were used in the same shot , and the crew disliked filming on the set . Moore elaborated ; 
 The crew had to film different versions of the prayer scene before Duck commits the suicide attack . In making the photograph of him and his late wife , the actress who played Nora in the webisode series The Resistance was not available , so the producers digitally inserted her face onto the photograph . The episode includes a voiceover of Roslin detailing the occupation and resistance . This was not originally added in the final script , but was instead considered during post @-@ production of the episode . The ending for the episode was originally Leoben presenting Starbuck with Kacey Brynn , her " daughter , " but for unspecified reasons , the scene was instead used for " Precipice " .

 " Occupation " and " Precipice " was originally meant to be released as two separate episodes , however the producers decided to merge them together to be released as a two @-@ hour broadcast .

 " Occupation " received generally positive reviews from critics .

" Ian Berriman of SFX called the episode a " stunning season opener , " citing the similarities of the occupation of Iraq as its greatest strength , but also thought it was the episode 's weakness . Berriman also liked Tigh 's transformation to a " ruthless terrorist " and Starbuck 's part of the episode . " Occupation " was rated five stars out of five . 
 Patrick Sauriol of UGO started the review stating " After the events of season two 's cliffhanger , there were a hundred questions on the minds of the show 's fans , but the biggest one gets answered with the Season Three double @-@ header premiere : was the start of Season Three worth the wait or has the show jumped the shark ?

" Sauriol commented that the time leap of a year was a " gutsy move , " but felt it has " always been the case " for the series . However , he also felt that all doubts the audience might have to harbor " that this show won 't live up to the first two seasons should be wiped away . " Callis ' performance was praised , with Sauriol stating " again Callis proves that he owns this role and again he proves tonight why Gaius Baltar is the best character on this show .

 Interstate 805 ( I @-@ 805 ) is a major north – south Interstate Highway in Southern California . It is a bypass of I @-@ 5 , running roughly through the center of the Greater San Diego region from San Ysidro ( part of the city of San Diego ) near the Mexico – U.S. border to near Del Mar. The southern terminus of I @-@ 805 at I @-@ 5 in San Ysidro is less than a mile north of the Mexican border . I @-@ 805 then traverses the cities of Chula Vista and National City before reentering San Diego . The freeway passes though the San Diego neighborhoods of North Park , Mission Valley , Clairemont , and University City before terminating at I @-@ 5 in the Sorrento Valley neighborhood near the Del Mar city limit . 
 Planning for I @-@ 805 began in 1956 , and the route was officially designated in 1959 before it was renumbered in the 1964 state highway renumbering . Starting in 1967 , the freeway was built in phases , with the northern part of the freeway finished before the southern part . I @-@ 805 was completed and open to traffic in 1975 . Named the Jacob Dekema Freeway after the longtime head of the regional division of the California Department of Transportation ( Caltrans ) , I @-@ 805 has been frequently cited for its complex engineering and architecture , including near I @-@ 8 on the Mission Valley Viaduct . Since then , several construction projects have taken place , including the construction of local and express lanes at the northern interchange with I @-@ 5 . High @-@ occupancy toll lanes are under construction on both the northern and southern portions of the route . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The route begins at I @-@ 5 near the Mexican border in a far south part of San Ysidro , a neighborhood of San Diego . As it starts its journey northward , it quickly has a junction with State Route 905 ( SR 905 ) before exiting the city of San Diego and entering Chula Vista . Within the past 20 years the freeway has delineated the apparent divide between rich and poor in the city of Chula Vista ; those on the eastern side of the freeway have been more affluent and have better schools compared to those on the western side . Just outside the city , I @-@ 805 meets County Route S17 ( CR S17 ) , also named Bonita Road , before coming to an interchange with SR 54 . The freeway then enters National City , where it intersects Sweetwater Road and Plaza Boulevard , before leaving the city and reentering the city of San Diego . 
 I @-@ 805 continues northward through San Diego , where it intersects SR 94 , the Martin Luther King Jr . Freeway . As the freeway continues through downtown San Diego , it meets SR 15 , the continuation of I @-@ 15 . It then intersects El Cajon Boulevard before passing under the Hazard Memorial Bridge that carries Adams Avenue . The bridge was named after Roscoe Hazard for his involvement in the construction of several roads and highways in Southern California . I @-@ 805 then travels on the Mission Valley Viaduct , a towering reinforced concrete viaduct built in 1972 , spanning over Mission Valley and the San Diego River . The viaduct is the top stack of the Jack Schrade Interchange over I @-@ 8 , which runs along the south side of Mission Valley and crosses underneath the viaduct perpendicularly , and is San Diego County 's only symmetrical stack interchange . The San Diego Trolley traffic also runs under the viaduct on the valley floor . 
 After intersecting SR 163 , also known as the Cabrillo Freeway , I @-@ 805 continues through suburban San Diego , where it meets SR 52 in Clairemont Mesa . North of SR 52 , it closely parallels I @-@ 5 near La Jolla , heading northwest . Passing under the Eastgate Mall arch bridge and entering Sorrento Valley , it finally meets its north end at I @-@ 5 . During the widening project which was completed in 2007 , I @-@ 5 at the I @-@ 805 merge was built to be 21 lanes wide . Eastbound SR 56 and Carmel Mountain Road are accessible via a parallel carriageway for local traffic heading northbound from I @-@ 805 ; traffic from SR 56 westbound can merge onto I @-@ 805 from the local bypass . 
 The route is officially known as the Jacob Dekema Freeway after Jacob Dekema , a pioneering force from California Department of Transportation ( Caltrans ) who helped shape the San Diego freeway system . It is also part of the California Freeway and Expressway System and the National Highway System , a network of roads that are important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . In 2013 , I @-@ 805 had an annual average daily traffic ( AADT ) of 41 @,@ 500 at the southern terminus , and 262 @,@ 000 between Bonita Road and SR 54 , the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway .

 According to Dekema , planning for I @-@ 805 began in 1956 . The original routing for I @-@ 805 was approved as an Interstate Highway in July 1958 . It was added to the state highway system and the Freeway and Expressway System in 1959 as Route 241 . I @-@ 805 was expected to reduce traffic on what was then US 101 between Los Angeles and San Diego , when the former was opened . Route 241 was renumbered to Route 805 in the 1964 state highway renumbering , and I @-@ 5 was designated along the route from Los Angeles to San Diego . Further planning was underway in 1965 , with the goal to have the route built by 1972 , the federal highway funding deadline . This was to be the first freeway in the area with no prior road along its route that it would replace ; the goal was to provide a bypass around San Diego for those traveling to Mexico , and improve access for local residents . By June , houses along the route in the North Park area were being sold , as the land was needed for the first stretch of the freeway to be constructed . The next year , Dekema confirmed that the first portion of what was known as the Inland Freeway to be built would be between Home and Adams avenues . 
 In May 1967 , bidding began , after construction had been delayed by that of the I @-@ 5 and I @-@ 8 freeways , both of which had been given higher priority . This first portion would run from Wabash Boulevard to around Madison Avenue ( a distance of 3 @.@ 5 miles or 5 @.@ 6 kilometres ) , and the next portion would include the I @-@ 8 interchange . The R.E. Hazard and W.F. Maxwell Companies won the low bid of $ 11 @.@ 7 million ( equivalent to $ 150 million in 2015 ) in mid @-@ 1967 . The groundbreaking ceremony happened on September 25 at El Cajon Boulevard and Boundary Street . In August 1968 , the portion of I @-@ 805 from just south of I @-@ 8 to north of Friars Road , including the interchange with I @-@ 8 , was put up for bidding ; at a budgeted $ 27 @.@ 5 million ( equivalent to $ 327 million in 2015 ) , it was the most expensive job that the Division of Highways had ever put up for bid . The winning bid was $ 20 @.@ 9 million ( equivalent to $ 313 million in 2015 ) , and was awarded to R.E. Hazard Contracting Company and W.F. Maxwell Company . 
 Construction had begun on the viaduct by May 1969 ; in the meantime , National City was making plans for developing the freeway corridor with motels and restaurants , as well as a shopping center . In mid @-@ 1969 , bidding was to begin on 3 @.@ 2 miles ( 5 @.@ 1 km ) of I @-@ 805 from north of Friars Road to north of what was then US 395 , which would become SR 163 . Construction from J Street south to near San Ysidro was underway by September , when there were concerns that an order from President Richard Nixon to reduce federal construction projects by 75 percent might affect funding for the portion north of Friars Road . However , Governor Ronald Reagan lifted the associated freeze in construction at the state level a few weeks later . A month later , the contract for the portion between Friars Road and US 395 had been awarded for $ 15 million ( equivalent to $ 166 million in 2015 ) ; the portions between there and north of Miramar Road were in the planning phases , while construction continued south of I @-@ 8 to Wabash Boulevard . The 2 @.@ 4 @-@ mile ( 3 @.@ 9 km ) portion from SR 52 to Miramar Road had been contracted out to O.G. Sansome Company for $ 5 @.@ 6 million ( equivalent to $ 62 @.@ 1 million in 2015 ) by the end of 1969 . Meanwhile , $ 4 million ( equivalent to $ 44 @.@ 3 million in 2015 ) of state funding was spent in 1969 to find housing for those who were to be displaced by the freeway in San Ysidro . 
 By March 1970 , the original section between Home Avenue and near I @-@ 8 was almost finished . The Mission Valley portion extending north of US 395 , as well as from Otay Valley Road and J Street in Chula Vista , were still under construction . The portion immediately north of US 395 was contracted to A.A. Baxter Corporation , E.C. Young , and Young and Sons , Inc. for $ 7 @.@ 9 million ( equivalent to $ 84 million in 2015 ) . On July 6 , the first section to begin construction was dedicated , and was to be opened from El Cajon Boulevard to Wabash Boulevard soon thereafter ; the rest of the section would not open until the Mission Valley interchange with I @-@ 8 was finished . 
 A second border crossing in the San Ysidro area was proposed near the Playas de Tijuana area , that would be accessible from I @-@ 805 , although another alternative was considered near Brown Field . A formal study on the matter was commissioned in August . However , this would have added $ 10 million ( equivalent to $ 106 million in 2015 ) to the cost of the freeway , and possibly delay it by up to 10 years ; furthermore , most traffic crossing the border was found to head to Tijuana and not Ensenada . Following this , the city of Chula Vista asked that the state proceed with the original plans to construct the freeway , even though it would pass through a San Ysidro neighborhood . 
 In September 1970 , bidding began for the final portion of the northern half of I @-@ 805 between Miramar Road and I @-@ 5 ; a month later , the segments between Home Avenue and SR 94 , and SR 54 to 12th Street had funding allocated . By the end of the year , Hazard , Maxwell , and <unk> had submitted the low bid of around $ 7 @.@ 2 million ( equivalent to $ 76 @.@ 5 million in 2015 ) for the northernmost portion . The Chula Vista portion of the freeway from Main Street to L Street was completed in February 1971 ; by then , the estimated date for completing the entire freeway had slipped to 1975 from 1972 . By March , the projected completion date for the Mission Valley bridge was revised to July 1972 . A 102 @-@ home mobile home park was approved by the City Council a few weeks later to house those who were displaced by the freeway construction . 
 The portion of the freeway from Otay Valley Road to Telegraph Canyon Road opened during 1972 . On October 22 , several unconstructed portions of I @-@ 805 were partially funded , including from Chula Vista south past SR 75 , north of the completed Chula Vista portion to SR 54 , from SR 54 to Plaza Boulevard in National City , from there to SR 94 ( including the interchange with SR 252 ) , and from there to Home Avenue . Before the end of the year , the portion from SR 94 to Home Avenue entered the bidding phase ; Guy F. Atkinson Company won the contract for roughly $ 9 @.@ 96 million ( equivalent to $ 90 @.@ 9 million in 2015 ) in early 1972 . Following a request from the El Cajon City Council , March 19 was set aside as a Community Cycle Day for bicyclists to travel the newly finished freeway from El Cajon Boulevard to SR 52 , just before the freeway was to be dedicated the next day ; the entire Mission Valley Viaduct was open to traffic that month . 
 By the beginning of 1974 , I @-@ 805 was open north of Home Avenue , and from Otay Valley Road to Telegraph Canyon Road in Chula Vista ; five segments remaining were under construction , and the last segment was funded . The Imperial Avenue section of I @-@ 805 remained in the budget , despite revisions in response to the 1973 oil crisis . In late January , I @-@ 805 between SR 15 and SR 94 was opened to traffic , though not all of the ramps at the SR 94 interchange were operational . The connectors to SR 94 east were completed in March . The entire portion between SR 94 and Home Avenue cost $ 10 @.@ 5 million ( equivalent to $ 80 @.@ 9 million in 2015 ) . Construction between SR 94 and Imperial Avenue was well under way by December , at a cost of $ 8 @.@ 5 million ( equivalent to $ 65 @.@ 5 million in 2015 ) . 
 As the scheduled completion of the freeway neared , Mayor Tom Hamilton of Chula Vista expressed concerns regarding the predicted development of the I @-@ 805 corridor , and the decisions that the City Council would need to make regarding such plans . The portion south of Otay Valley Road cost $ 15 million ( equivalent to $ 107 million in 2015 ) , and the portion between Telegraph Canyon Road and Sweetwater Road cost $ 12 million ( equivalent to $ 85 @.@ 6 million in 2015 ) . The portion from there to Imperial Avenue was projected to cost $ 10 @.@ 2 million ( equivalent to $ 72 @.@ 7 million in 2015 ) . The dedication of the freeway took place on July 23 , 1975 , even though the freeway was not entirely finished , due to the desire to hold the ceremony during the summer . I @-@ 805 from Plaza Boulevard to Telegraph Canyon Road opened to traffic on July 28 , leaving the freeway complete except for the portion between Plaza Boulevard and SR 94 . While portions of the freeway were nearly ready for traffic , there were reports of motorists driving on the closed freeway , which the California Highway Patrol warned was illegal . On September 3 , Dekema announced that the entirety of the freeway would open the next day as he made a final inspection of the unopened portion ; the total cost of the construction was $ 145 million ( equivalent to $ 1 @.@ 03 billion in 2015 ) . However , Dekema announced that there was no more state funding available to construct further roads for the short @-@ term .

 The Mission Valley Viaduct was recognized by the American Society of Civil Engineers ( ASCE ) as the " Outstanding Civil Engineering Project for 1973 in the San Diego Area " ; it was designed to match the close @-@ by Mission San Diego de Alcalá with its columns that look similar to cathedral windows , and arch @-@ like shapes etched into the textured concrete . The viaduct was designed to span 3 @,@ 900 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) , and use squared @-@ off support columns instead of traditional cylindrical supports . Octagonal columns were to be used on the ramps and the ends of the bridge . Over 600 tons of steel bars were to be used , and the bridge was constructed as high as 98 feet ( 30 m ) above I @-@ 8 . The Adams Avenue Bridge over I @-@ 805 was also recognized for its 439 @-@ foot ( 134 m ) span and two tapered supports on the ends of the bridge ; in 1968 , a Princeton University engineering professor asked for a copy of the design from Caltrans for educational purposes . The construction supervisor , in fact , compared the construction of this bridge to building a boat , and it was constructed from the middle outward rather than the conventional method of building from the ends inward . The span was designed to be 268 feet ( 82 m ) long , and 100 feet ( 30 m ) high . 
 Awards for the Eastgate Mall ( or Old Miramar Bridge ) came from the Federal Highway Administration , San Diego Highway Development Association , and <unk> Concrete Institute Awards Program ; at the time , it was one of the first arch bridges in the state , and did not use traditional concrete pillars . The San Diego Union ( predecessor to the Union @-@ Tribune ) published a few freelance articles in 1984 about I @-@ 805 , complimenting the four @-@ level interchange with I @-@ 8 and the arch bridge at Eastgate Mall , while mentioning that subsequent inflation after their completion would have made such structures more difficult to build if they had been constructed later . Other artwork and architecture that was mentioned included the <unk> development in Sorrento Valley , and the " Stargazer " building by Alexander Liberman that was lit with fluorescent colors at night . 
 However , not all forms of artwork along the highway were uncontroversial . In 1977 , there were several complaints regarding new billboards that were installed at the northern terminus of the highway , since they blocked the view of the coast . In 1981 , an illegal mural that was determined to be incomplete was discovered at the I @-@ 8 interchange ; while Caltrans discouraged the painting of such murals , they were impressed with the portion that had already been completed . Art Cole , the artist , stepped forward to the department , and was allowed to finish the mural of a desert highland sunrise ; following this , Caltrans made efforts to have other murals commissioned . 
 The San Ysidro Chamber of Commerce attempted to have I @-@ 805 named as the San Ysidro Freeway in 1976 . However , I @-@ 805 was named after Jacob Dekema in August 1981 , and ceremonies to mark the occasion occurred in February 1982 . The plaque honoring Dekema was installed in November at the Governor Drive interchange . Because of his efforts in designing I @-@ 805 , Ed Settle of Caltrans was given the Outstanding Civil Engineering Award from the ASCE ; he designed several other regional freeways , including SR 163 through Balboa Park and I @-@ 5 through San Diego .

 The construction of a " dual freeway " at the northern end of I @-@ 805 was discussed as early as 1989 , referring to the two carriageways needed for each direction of the freeway , resulting in four total . It would require drivers to use the new local lanes to access eastbound SR 56 from I @-@ 5 or I @-@ 805 . The project would allow for trucks to use the new lanes to assist in merging with traffic . However , it faced opposition from local residents , concerned about the loss of the view from their homes , as well as environmentalists concerned about nearby wetlands . Further objections espoused the view that the congestion would continue to increase , regardless of what was done , and that the new road would be at capacity in a few years . The San Diego Association of Governments ( SANDAG ) funded the construction with $ 110 million ( equivalent to $ 168 million in 2015 ) in mid @-@ 2000 . 
 Construction of the " dual freeway " began in early 2002 , at a cost of $ 182 million ( equivalent to $ 266 million in 2015 ) . The northbound lanes were scheduled to open in February 2006 . The southbound lanes were completed in early 2007 . That year , a three @-@ year project began to allow robot controlled vehicles , including buses and trucks , to use a special lane . The intention is to allow the vehicles to travel at shorter following distances and thereby allow more vehicles to use the lanes . The vehicles will still have drivers since they need to enter and exit the special lanes . The system was designed by Swoop Technology , based in San Diego County . 
 Two years later , construction began on two auxiliary lanes on I @-@ 805 southbound from SR 54 to Bonita Road , to improve traffic flow at the SR 54 interchange . In 2010 , Caltrans proposed adding high @-@ occupancy toll express lanes between SR 15 and East Palomar Street in Chula Vista . The California Transportation Commission ( CTC ) awarded $ 100 million for the work in June 2011 , which would be split into two phases at the interchange with SR 54 . Work is also underway to add two HOV lanes between SR 52 and Mira Mesa Boulevard ; this project also received $ 59 @.@ 5 million from the CTC in September 2011 . Meanwhile , SANDAG made arrangements to purchase the SR 125 toll road and reduce the tolls , which was hoped to encourage commuters to take that road instead of I @-@ 805 and reduce congestion ; this would then enable Caltrans to construct two managed lanes instead of the original four . 
 In February 2013 , construction began on the northern HOV lanes ; the project is expected to cost $ 86 million . By May , construction on the Palomar Street direct access ramps had begun , and the Carroll Canyon Road ramps were almost finished . The northern project is expected to be complete in 2015 , and the southern express lanes opened in March 2014 at a cost of $ 1 @.@ 4 billion , with an option to expand them into two lanes in each direction , and a proposed direct ramp to the express lanes . A 2012 Caltrans report proposed adding four managed lanes along the entire length of the highway . Construction on HOV lanes from SR 905 to SR 15 is planned for 2016 .

 = Nefertiti Bust = 
 The Nefertiti Bust is a 3 @,@ 300 @-@ year @-@ old painted stucco @-@ coated limestone bust of Nefertiti , the Great Royal Wife of the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten . The work is believed to have been crafted in 1345 BC by the sculptor Thutmose , because it was found in his workshop in Amarna , Egypt . It is one of the most copied works of ancient Egypt . Owing to the work , Nefertiti has become one of the most famous women of the ancient world , and an icon of feminine beauty . 
 A German archaeological team led by Ludwig Borchardt discovered the Nefertiti bust in 1912 in Thutmose 's workshop . It has been kept at various locations in Germany since its discovery , including the cellar of a bank , a salt mine in Merkers @-@ <unk> , the Dahlem museum , the Egyptian Museum in Charlottenburg and the Altes Museum . It is currently on display at the Neues Museum in Berlin , where it was originally displayed before World War II . 
 The Nefertiti bust has become a cultural symbol of Berlin as well as ancient Egypt . Nefertiti herself has become quite an icon . Nefertiti is widely known for her beauty and versatility . It has also been the subject of an intense argument between Egypt and Germany over Egyptian demands for its repatriation . It was dragged into controversy by the Body of Nefertiti art exhibition and also by doubts over its authenticity . However various testing and analysis of the bust have proved it to be authentic .

 = = = Background = = = 
 Nefertiti ( meaning " the beautiful one has come " ) was the 14th @-@ century BC Great Royal Wife ( chief consort ) of the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten of the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt . Akhenaten initiated a new monotheistic form of worship called Atenism dedicated to the Sun disc Aten . Little is known about Nefertiti . Theories suggest she could have been an Egyptian royal by birth , a foreign princess or the daughter of a high government official named Ay , who became pharaoh after Tutankhamun . She may have been the co @-@ regent of Egypt with Akhenaten , who ruled from 1352 BC to 1336 BC . Nefertiti bore six daughters to Akhenaten , one of whom , <unk> ( renamed <unk> after the suppression of the Aten cult ) , married Tutankhamun , Nefertiti 's stepson . Nefertiti was thought to have disappeared from history in the twelfth year of Akhenaten 's reign , though whether this is due to her death or because she took a new name is not known . She may also have later become a pharaoh in her own right , ruling alone for a short time after her husband 's death . However , it is now known that she was still alive in the sixteenth year of her husband 's reign from a limestone quarry inscription found at Dayr Abū <unk> . Dayr Abū <unk> is located " on the eastern side of the Nile , about ten kilometres north of Amarna . " 
 The bust of Nefertiti is believed to have been crafted about 1345 BC by the sculptor Thutmose . The bust does not have any inscriptions , but can be certainly identified as Nefertiti by the characteristic crown , which she wears in other surviving ( and clearly labelled ) depictions ( see for instance the ' house altar ' , right ) . 
 = = = Discovery = = = 
 The Nefertiti bust was found on 6 December 1912 at Amarna by the German Oriental Company ( Deutsche Orient @-@ Gesellschaft – DOG ) , led by German archaeologist Ludwig Borchardt . It was found in what had been the sculptor Thutmose 's workshop , along with other unfinished busts of Nefertiti . Borchardt 's diary provides the main written account of the find ; he remarks , " Suddenly we had in our hands the most alive Egyptian artwork . You cannot describe it with words . You must see it .
