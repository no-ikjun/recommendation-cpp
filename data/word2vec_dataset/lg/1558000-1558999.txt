 Buford is a city in Gwinnett and Hall counties in the U.S. state of Georgia . As of the 2010 census , the city had a population of 12 @,@ 225 . Most of the city is in Gwinnett County , which is part of the Atlanta @-@ Sandy Springs @-@ Marietta Metropolitan Statistical Area . The portions of the city in Hall County are not part of Atlanta 's metropolitan statistical area , but are part of Atlanta 's larger Combined Statistical Area , which includes Hall County . 
 The city was founded in 1872 after a railroad was built in the area connecting Charlotte , NC with Atlanta . Buford was named after Algernon Sidney Buford , who at the time was president of the Atlanta and Richmond Air @-@ Line Railway . The city 's leather industry , led by the Bona Allen Company , as well as its location as a railway stop , caused the population to expand during the early 1900s until after the Great Depression had ended . 
 The city operates its own school district , the Buford City School District , and has been the birthplace and home of several musicians and athletes . Various tourist locations , including museums and community centers , the largest mall in the state of Georgia , the Mall of Georgia , and Lake Lanier Islands are in the city of Buford . 
 = = History = = 
 Buford appears in historical records beginning in the early 19th century . The area that is now Buford was originally part of the Cherokee territory and despite the treaty in 1817 that ceded the territory to the United States and Gwinnett County 's legislative establishment in 1818 , the area was still largely inhabited by the Cherokee until the 1830s . The first Americans moved to the Buford area in the late 1820s or early 1830s , although the Buford area was not largely inhabited by non @-@ Native Americans until the 1860s . 
 During the post @-@ civil war construction of the extended Richmond and Danville Railroad System in 1865 , railroad stockholders Thomas Garner and Larkin Smith purchased land around the railroad 's right @-@ of @-@ way and began developing the city of Buford . The city was named after Algernon Sidney Buford , who was president of the Atlanta and Richmond Air @-@ Line Railway during the railroad 's construction . The town began rapidly expanding around the railway after its completion in 1871 , and Buford was incorporated as the Town of Buford on August 24 , 1872 , and renamed the City of Buford in 1896 . 
 In the late 1800s and early 1900s Buford became widely known for its leather production , becoming prominently associated with the leather industry and earning the nickname " The Leather City " . Buford became a large producer of leather products , including saddles , horse collars , bridles , and shoes . Buford 's leather industry began with a <unk> named R.H. Allen opening a harness shop and tannery in 1868 , three years before the completion of the railway and the founding of Buford . R.H. Allen 's brother Bona Allen moved to Buford from Rome , Georgia in 1872 and founded the Bona Allen Company the following year , in 1873 . The leather industry quickly became the city 's largest industry despite setbacks from several fires , including a fire in 1903 that destroyed the buildings of several businesses and a fire in 1906 that destroyed a straw store house and nearly destroyed the city 's harness and horse collar factory . 
 Bona Allen saddles were available through the Sears mail order catalog , and many Hollywood actors used saddles made by the Bona Allen Company , including cowboy actors Gene Autry , the cast of Bonanza , and Roy Rogers , who used a Bona Allen saddle on his horse Trigger . A statue of Roy Rogers and a Bona Allen saddle @-@ maker saddling Trigger is located in downtown Buford . The Bona Allen Company thrived during the Great Depression in the 1930s , likely as a result of the Great Depression forcing farmers to choose horses over expensive tractors , thereby increasing the demand for saddles , collars , bridles , and other leather products . 
 The Bona Allen Company constructed Tannery Row in downtown Buford as a shoe factory in 1919 . After a brief employee strike the shoe factory was closed in 1942 , although it was briefly reopened by the request of the federal government during World War II to make footwear for the United States military . Afterwards , the factory closed in 1945 . In 2003 Tannery Row became home to the Tannery Row Artist Colony , which houses galleries and studios for artists . 
 After the Great Depression the use of horses for farming decreased and tractors took their place , and the Bona Allen Company steadily downsized until the tannery was eventually sold to the Tandy Corporation in 1968 . Buford 's leather industry ended after the tannery experienced a fire in 1981 , when the Tandy Corporation decided not to rebuild the tannery and closed the facility .

 Raghuvaran is a graduate in Civil Engineering , but has been unemployed for four years . He is adamant about working in a job related to his field only and is unwilling to accept any other profession . He often comes into conflict with his father , who considers him irresponsible . His younger brother , Karthik , works in an IT company , earning well and , evidently , his father 's approval . Raghuvaran 's mother , Bhuvana , however , supports him . Raghuvaran falls for his neighbour 's daughter , Shalini who hates him initially , but warms up to him after hearing about the difficulties he is facing and eventually reciprocates his love . 
 One day , while Raghuvaran 's father and Karthik are absent , he is asked to look after his mother , who has a heart condition . However , he goes out on a date with Shalini . He gets continuous phone calls from his mother , which he ignores despite Shalini 's insistence to pick them up . However , on returning home , he finds out that his mother had died of a heart attack . Raghuvaran feels guilty about not being there when his mother needed him and develops depression . Meanwhile , Bhuvana 's lungs are transplanted into Anitha , a chain smoker who developed lung cancer . Anitha 's father is the chairman of a civil engineering company in Chennai and offers Raghuvaran a job as a token of his gratitude for saving his daughter 's life . Raghuvaran accepts the job while also requesting Anitha not to smoke , which she agrees . Six months later , Raghuvaran is offered an assignment on a government project to construct high @-@ rise flats to re @-@ house people living in a nearby slum . Azhagusundaram and Manickam are appointed as his assistants . He successfully wins the contract from the government and begins work on it immediately . 
 Arun Subramaniam , a business novice who took over his father 's company 's Chennai branch , bids for the same contract , even by using illegal methods . Furious that he did not get the land , he tries to thwart Raghuvaran 's progress in a number of ways . Raghuvaran overcomes each of these obstacles and continues his work , but Arun eventually hires rowdies to beat up Raghuvaran 's workers at the construction site . The workers get injured and end up in hospital , which prompts Raghuvaran to go to Arun 's office to put an end to this issue . He makes Arun confess that he sent the rowdies , which is recorded by a micro spy camera , and demands an apology from Arun , blackmailing him that otherwise the video would be made public . Fearing that the video could tarnish his reputation , Arun 's father , Venkat , sends his son to the hospital to apologise . Raghuvaran accepts the apology and the project is completed within ten months . 
 On the day of the flats ' inauguration , Arun and a gang of rowdies ambush Raghuvaran en route . He outwits them but spares Arun , much to Arun 's surprise . Raghuvaran says he has no intention to compete with or beat him and wishes to be his friend . Raghuvaran takes Arun to the site on his moped , where the state public works minister and Anitha inaugurate the flats .

 Velraj and Dhanush had worked together on several projects including Aadukalam ( 2011 ) and 3 ( 2012 ) as cinematographer and lead actor respectively . During the production of those films , Dhanush suggested Velraj to make his debut as a director and promised to play the lead role . After Velraj showed Dhanush the film 's script , Dhanush agreed to play the lead role as well as produce the film . In July 2013 , Dhanush confirmed his collaboration with Velraj , whilst also confirming the inclusion of Amala Paul as the female lead and Anirudh Ravichander as the music director . The title of the film , Velaiilla Pattadhari was unveiled on 15 August 2013 . After the title launch , Dhanush confirmed that filming would start on 20 August 2013 . 
 Regarding the film 's development , Velraj said , “ Dhanush must have liked something about me to help me grow . It was during our Aadukalam days that he promised to make me a director and said he would act in my first film . Several directors would have lined up for this opportunity . He chose me . It ’ s just a bond we share . ” 
 Velraj shot the film alongside his commitments as cinematographer for <unk> ( 2014 ) and Vai Raja Vai , while Anirudh Ravichander and Kola Bhaskar joined the team as music composer and editor respectively . However , Bhaskar was replaced with M. V. Rajesh Kumar after scheduling conflicts arose . The film was planned as a " message to the youth with some comedy on rising unemployment and the growing frustration for jobs with love " .

 When Velraj showed Dhanush the script for the film , he was impressed by it and immediately offered to act in it as well as bankroll the venture . Velraj said besides acting , Dhanush suggested additional inputs to the script . Rather than demand changes , the actor collaborated with the director to develop the best script for the film . Dhanush 's well @-@ toned body was remarked upon by the media , but Dhanush clarified the workout was mostly for promoting the film rather than having done it as an integral part of his character . Velraj later commented about the requirement of a muscular appearance for a fight scene in the film 's climax , resulting in Dhanush toning his body for the sequence . Amala Paul was selected to play the role of a doctor named Shalini . She described her character as " very different " from those that she had done before , and that the characters in the film were drawn from real @-@ life archetypes . 
 Vivek , who was added to the cast in May 2014 , stated during a press meet of the film that he initially rejected the role and as a result , Dhanush decided to make someone else play the role . Vivek then accepted the role for Dhanush 's sake . Saranya Ponvannan was selected to play the role of Bhuvana , Raghuvaran 's mother , while Samuthirakani was chosen to play Dhanush 's father . Samuthirakani was suggested to Dhanush by <unk> . 
 Actress Surabhi began filming her scenes in early March 2014 . Hrishikesh , who plays Karthik , Raghuvaran 's sibling , received an SMS from Dhanush 's production office , which asked him to audition for the role . He was selected after his screen test ended successfully . Amitash Pradhan played the main antagonist , Arun Subramaniam . Amitash was recruited from the Anupam Kher Acting School . In an interview with Gulf News , Amitash described his character to be not the " stereotypical villain " often seen in Tamil cinema , and that his character was more cunning .

 Principal photography formally began on 20 August 2013 . An initial production poster was released to the media on 25 December 2013 . On 31 December 2013 , the team released a teaser trailer featuring Dhanush , Amala Paul and Saranya . The team began the final shoot on 2 May 2014 , with comedian Vivek amongst other actors joining the cast . Filming was completed on 4 May 2014 . 
 During the film 's shoot , Velraj would often forget to say “ Action ! ” , but despite this , there were hardly any retakes . Being a cinematographer , Velraj gave priority to visual presentations and costume designing in the film . Director Subramaniam Siva , who had earlier collaborated with Dhanush for Thiruda <unk> ( 2003 ) , helped with the post @-@ production work involved in the film . According to Velraj , during the entire schedule of filming , the speaking parts were completed in 52 days . 
 Prior to the release , there were concerns raised that the film was similar to the Kamal Haasan starrer , Sathya ( 1988 ) . Dhanush clarified that there were no similarities between the films , nor was it similar to another Haasan film , Varumayin Niram Sivappu ( 1980 ) , except for the fact that the protagonist was unemployed . A scene in the film where Dhanush speaks about the education that he got in Ramakrishna Vidyalaya was muted at the request of the Ramakrishna Mission School administration . 
 = = Themes and influences = = 
 Velaiilla Pattadhari raises the issue of unemployed graduates in society . Dhanush 's character , Raghuvaran , represented the unemployed graduate who is waiting to move up the social ladder . One scene shows Raghuvaran delivering a speech about the difficulties in finishing an engineering degree only to remain jobless , with some of them having to take jobs not related to their fields to make a living . Dhanush 's characterisation was similar to his characters from his previous films like <unk> ( 2007 ) , Yaaradi Nee Mohini ( 2008 ) and <unk> ( 2009 ) . Both Baradwaj Rangan of The Hindu and M. Suganth of The Times of India compare Dhanush 's and Amitash 's characters and their encounters with each other to those that took place between the second king of the United Kingdom of Israel and Judah , David and the Philistine warrior , Goliath . 
 The film shifts from exploring self @-@ pity to proving a point , where the protagonist overcomes all hurdles and outwits a rich adversary , as well as building a successful relationship . The father @-@ figure in the film disapproves of his son 's continued unemployment , while his mother defends him . Karthik , meanwhile , is a contrasting figure , being settled and prosperous . Amala Paul 's character , Shalini , is shown as Raghuvaran 's confidante though he feels jealous when she interacts with his brother . The film also portrays the relationship between a mother and her son as particularly important .

 The film 's soundtrack and score were composed by Anirudh Ravichander . The album , containing eight tracks , was initially scheduled to be released on 3 January 2014 , but the release was brought forward to 14 February 2014 , to add two additional songs . The team also recorded a track described as a " lilting melody " between Dhanush and singer S. Janaki in October 2013 . Anirudh promoted the album on Sun Music a week before the film 's release . The track list was released on 10 February 2014 . The album cover depicts Dhanush 's character , Raghuvaran 's frantic search for a job . 
 The album was launched at the Suryan FM 93 @.@ 5 radio station with Dhanush , Amala Paul and Anirudh Ravichander in attendance . The album received positive response from critics . IndiaGlitz gave the album 4 out of 5 stars : " Anirudh is back again with yet another sure hit . This time , it 's bigger , better and massive ! In all , the album is soulful , lively and truly Anirudh " . Srinivasa Ramanujam of The Times of India gave the album 3 out of 5 stars , saying that some of the songs sounded similar to Anirudh 's previous compositions . He criticised the use of only two male singers ( Dhanush and Anirudh ) , stating that " other voices might have provided a fresher musical perspective to some of the tunes " . The songs " Velaiyilla Pattathari " , " Poo Indru <unk> " , " What a <unk> " and " <unk> <unk> " topped the Radio Mirchi South charts for 31 weeks .

 The film received generally positive reviews from critics . Writing for The Hindu , Baradwaj Rangan said " There are films that cater to the actor , and there are films that cater to the star — in <unk> Pattathari [ sic ] , Dhanush gets a film where he gets to showcase both sides . He ’ s ( Velraj ) given actor @-@ Dhanush fans half a movie to love , and he ’ s handed over the rest to the star @-@ Dhanush fans . Is there much use complaining when both actor and star are in such fine form ? " Sify wrote " Velai <unk> Pattadhari [ sic ] is a rollicking fun ride . It ’ s pure unadulterated masala laced with all essential ingredients that work with mass audiences . Writer , director and cinematographer R Velraj has made a dream debut with a perfect commercial mix " . 
 M. Suganth of The Times of India gave the film 3 @.@ 5 out of 5 stars and wrote , " [ ... ] Velraj ( the cinematographer making his directorial debut ) superbly manages to strike a balance between the emotional and mass hero moments .

" Anupama Subramanian of the Deccan Chronicle gave the film 3 @.@ 5 out of 5 stars and wrote , " Dhanush has chosen a befitting script for his 25th milestone film and in the company of his favourite cinematographer turned filmmaker Velraj , who has churned out a mass family entertainer with Velai <unk> Pattadhari [ sic ] " , calling it a " wholesome entertainer " . 
 Oneindia Entertainment gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and stated that " <unk> Pattathari [ sic ] is a perfect entertainer for Dhanush 's fans " . S. Saraswathi of Rediff gave the film 3 stars out of 5 and concluded , " Velaiyilla Pattathari [ sic ] is two hours of pure entertainment , definitely worth a watch " . Haricharan Pudipeddi of IANS gave the film 3 stars out 5 and stated , " While VIP <unk> Dhanush 's heroism in a tailor @-@ made role which he comfortably pulls off , it also achieves so many things right as a commercial film and that 's what works in its favour .

 = Dunstaffnage Castle = 
 Dunstaffnage Castle is a partially ruined castle in Argyll and Bute , western Scotland . It lies 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) <unk> of Oban , situated on a platform of conglomerate rock on a promontory at the south @-@ west of the entrance to Loch Etive , and is surrounded on three sides by the sea . 
 The castle dates back to the 13th century , making it one of Scotland 's oldest stone castles , in a local group which includes Castle Sween and Castle <unk> . Guarding a strategic location , it was built by the MacDougall lords of Lorn , and has been held since the 15th century by the Clan Campbell . To this day there is a hereditary Captain of Dunstaffnage , although they no longer reside at the castle . Dunstaffnage is maintained by Historic Scotland , and is open to the public , although the 16th century gatehouse is retained as the private property of the Captain . The prefix dun in the name means " fort " in Gaelic , while the rest of the name derives from Norse <unk> @-@ <unk> , " headland of the staff " . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Before Dunstaffnage = = = 
 Before the construction of the castle , Dunstaffnage may have been the location of a Dál Riatan stronghold , known as Dun <unk> , as early as the 7th century . It was recorded , by John <unk> in 1612 , that the Stone of Destiny was kept here after being brought from Ireland , and before it was moved to Scone Palace in 843 . However , Iona and Dunadd are considered more likely , given their known connections with Dál Riatan and Strathclyde kings . Hector Boece records that the stone was kept at " <unk> " , which has traditionally been identified with Dunstaffnage , although in 2010 the writer A. J. Morton identified <unk> with Irvine in Ayrshire . 
 = = = The MacDougalls = = = 
 The castle itself was built in the second quarter of the 13th century , as the seat of Duncan MacDougall , Lord of Lorn and grandson of Somerled . Duncan was unsuccessfully attacked by his Norwegian @-@ backed brother , <unk> , who later died in an attack on Rothesay Castle with Norse forces in the 1230s . He had also travelled to Rome in 1237 , and was the founder of nearby Ardchattan Priory . Duncan 's son Ewen MacDougall inherited his father 's title in the 1240s , and expanded the MacDougall influence , styling himself " King of the Isles " . It is probable that Ewen built the three round towers onto the castle , and constructed and enlarged the hall inside . 
 Following Alexander III 's repulse of the Norse influence in Argyll , the MacDougalls backed the Scottish monarchy , and Ewen 's son Alexander was made the first sherriff of Argyll in 1293 . However , they supported the Balliol side during the Wars of Scottish Independence which broke out a few years later . Robert Bruce defeated the Clan MacDougall at the Battle of the Pass of Brander in 1308 or 1309 , and after a brief siege , took control of Dunstaffnage Castle . 
 = = = Royal fortress = = = 
 Now a Crown property , Dunstaffnage was controlled by a series of keepers . James I seized the castle in 1431 , following the Battle of Inverlochy , as his enemies were hiding inside . In 1455 James Douglas , 9th Earl of Douglas stayed at Dunstaffnage , on his way to treat with John MacDonald , Lord of the Isles . This followed James II 's attack on Douglas power , and led to the signing of the Treaty of Westminster @-@ Ardtornish . A later keeper , John Stewart of Lorn , was a rival of Alan MacDougall , and was stabbed by his supporters on his way to his marriage at Dunstaffnage Chapel in 1463 , although he survived long enough to make his vows . Although MacDougall took the castle , he was ousted by James III , who granted Dunstaffnage to Colin Campbell , 1st Earl of Argyll in 1470 . 
 = = = Clan Campbell = = = 
 The Earls of Argyll appointed Captains to oversee Dunstaffnage , and keep it in readiness , on their behalf . Changes were made to the buildings , particularly the gatehouse , which was rebuilt around this time . The Campbells were loyal allies of the royal house , and Dunstaffnage was used as a base for government expeditions against the MacDonald Lords of the Isles , among others , during the 15th and 16th centuries . James IV visited Dunstaffnage on two occasions . 
 Dunstaffnage saw action during the Civil War , holding out against Montrose 's army in 1644 . The castle was burned by royalist troops , following the failure of the rising of the 9th Earl of Argyll in 1685 , against the Catholic James VII . During the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745 , the castle was occupied by government troops . Flora MacDonald , who helped Bonnie Prince Charlie to escape from Scotland , was briefly imprisoned here while en route to imprisonment in London . 
 = = = Decline and restoration = = = 
 The Campbells continued to add to the castle , building a new house over the old west range in 1725 . However , the rest of the castle was already decaying . In 1810 an accidental fire gutted the castle , and the Captains ceased to live here , moving to Dunstaffnage House , some 2 km to the south @-@ east , until this too burned down in 1940 . Tenants lived in the 1725 house within the castle until 1888 . 
 Restoration work was undertaken in 1903 by the Duke of Argyll , the castle 's owner . This was followed in 1912 by a court case , in which the Court of Session ruled that Angus Campbell , the 20th hereditary Captain , had right of residence notwithstanding the Duke of Argyll 's ownership . Works were delayed by World War I , and the planned total restoration was never completed . In 1958 , the 21st Captain and the Duke agreed to hand the castle into state care , and it remains a Historic Scotland property . Both the castle and chapel are category A listed buildings and Scheduled Ancient Monuments . 
 = = Description = = 
 = = = Walls = = = 
 Dunstaffnage is an irregular quadrangular structure of great strength , with rounded towers at three of the angles . It measures approximately 35 by 30 metres ( 115 by 98 ft ) , and has a circumference of about 120 metres ( 390 ft ) . The walls are of coursed rubble , with sandstone dressings , and stand up to 18 m ( 60 ft ) high , including the conglomerate bedrock platform . The walls are up to 3 m ( 10 ft ) thick , affording strong defence to this highly strategic location , guarding the entrance to Loch Etive and the Pass of Brander beyond , and today commanding a splendid view . The parapet walk , which once followed the whole of the walls , has been partially restored with new stone flags . The original parapet is now also gone . Arrow slits , later converted into gunloops , are the only openings . Brass cannon recovered from wrecked vessels of the Spanish Armada were once mounted on the walls . 
 = = = Round towers = = = 
 Soon after the construction of the castle walls , three round towers were built on the north , east , and west towers . The north tower , or donjon , is the largest , comprising three or four storeys originally , and probably housed the lord 's private apartments . The west tower is almost internal , barely projecting beyond the rounded corner of the curtain wall , and could only be entered via the parapet walk . The basement level contains a pit prison which was accessed from above . The east tower was almost completely rebuilt in the late 15th century as a gatehouse . Each tower was probably once topped by a conical roof . 
 = = = The gatehouse = = = 
 The gatehouse was built by the Campbells in the late 15th century , replacing an earlier round tower in the east corner . It takes the form of a four @-@ storey harled tower house , with the entrance passage running through half the vaulted basement , the other half forming guard rooms with arrow slits facing the gate . The present approach to the gate is by a stone stair , replacing an earlier drawbridge . The tower was remodelled in the 18th century to provide reception rooms and a private suite . The dormer windows at the top are capped by the pediments from the 1725 house ( see below ) , and bear the date , the Campbell arms , and the initials AEC and DLC , for Aeneas Campbell , 11th Captain , and his wife Dame Lilias . The pediments were moved here during the 1903 restoration works . 
 = = = Internal ranges = = = 
 The east range was located between the north and east towers , although only foundations remain . This was the principal range of buildings and contained a large hall above vaulted cellars . The hall had double @-@ lancet windows , decorated with carved patterns , which were later blocked up ; their outlines can be seen in the east curtain wall . 
 A second range stood along the north @-@ west wall , and would have been connected to the hall range by the donjon tower . The ground floor housed a kitchen . In 1725 the range was remodelled into a two @-@ storey house , accessed via a stone stair , and topped with the dormer windows which now form part of the gatehouse . The well in front is original , although the large stone surround is of 19th century date . 
 = = Dunstaffnage Chapel = = 
 A ruined 13th century chapel lies around 150 metres ( 490 ft ) to the south @-@ west of the castle . This was also built by Duncan MacDougall of Lorn , as a private chapel , and features detailed stonework of outstanding quality . The chapel is 20 by 6 metres ( 66 by 20 ft ) , and formerly had a timber roof . The lancet windows carry dog @-@ tooth carving , and have fine wide @-@ splayed arches internally . The chapel was already ruinous in 1740 , when a burial aisle was built on to the east end , to serve as a resting place for the Captains of Dunstaffnage and their families . 
 = = Captain of Dunstaffnage = = 
 Traditionally , an officer called the Hereditary Captain of Dunstaffnage is responsible for the castle and its defence . The office still exists , and to retain the title ( now rather a sinecure without military significance ) , the incumbent is required to spend three nights a year in the castle . No other responsibilities or privileges now attach to the post .

 A ghost , known as the " Ell @-@ maid of Dunstaffnage " , is said to haunt the castle . A type of <unk> , the ghost 's appearances are said to be associated with events in the lives of the hereditary keepers . 
 = Rookery Building = 
 The Rookery Building is a historic landmark located at 209 South LaSalle Street in the Loop community area of Chicago in Cook County , Illinois , United States . Completed by John Wellborn Root and Daniel Burnham of Burnham and Root in 1888 , it is considered one of their masterpiece buildings , and was once the location of their office . The building measures 181 feet ( 55 m ) , is twelve stories tall and is considered the oldest standing high @-@ rise in Chicago . It has a unique style with exterior load @-@ bearing walls and an interior steel frame , which provided a transition between accepted and new building techniques . The lobby was remodeled in 1905 by Frank Lloyd Wright . Beginning in 1989 , the lobby was restored to the original Wright design . 
 The building was designated a Chicago Landmark on July 5 , 1972 , and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 17 , 1970 and listed as a National Historic Landmark on May 15 , 1975 . 
 = = Name = = 
 The name of the building is an allusion to the old City Hall building that occupied the land before the Rookery . That building was nicknamed the Rookery not only in reference to the crows and pigeons that inhabited its exterior walls , but also because of the shady politicians it housed ( given the rook 's perceived reputation for acquisitiveness ) . After the Great Chicago Fire a dilapidated building was used as an interim City Hall at this location ( LaSalle and Adams ) . However , pigeons became such a nuisance that a complaining citizen began referring to the building as " a rookery " , a term the press quickly adopted . Although several names were considered when a new structure on the site was proposed , " the Rookery " won out . 
 = = Construction = = 
 = = = Burnham & Root = = = 
 The Rookery was built in 1887 – 1888 by the architectural partnership of Daniel H. Burnham and John Wellborn Root , known as Burnham and Root . In the architectural boom that followed the Great Chicago Fire , architects in what would become known as the Chicago School of commercial architecture competed with each other to create the world 's first true skyscrapers . By mixing modern building techniques , such as metal framing , fireproofing , elevators and plate glass , together with traditional ones , such as brick facades and elaborate ornamentation , Burnham and Root sought to create a bold architectural statement . At the same time , they intended their buildings to be commercially successful . This building is one of the few results of their partnership that is still standing . 
 As the master artisan , Root drew upon a variety of influences in designing the interior and exterior spaces , including Moorish , Byzantine , Venetian and Romanesque motifs . He also provided the architectural innovations that brought together many contemporary cutting edge building techniques . Of particular note was a " floating " foundation — a reinforced concrete slab that provided the building 's weight with a solid platform atop Chicago 's notoriously swampy soil . The term for the type of foundation that Root designed is <unk> foundation , a foundation where iron rails and the structural beams are combined in a crisscross pattern and encased in concrete to support the building 's immense weight without heavy foundation stones . This construction is particularly useful when structural loads are high compared to the natural bearing capacity of the soil . 
 = = = Light court = = = 
 Making prodigious use of light and ornamentation , Root and Burnham designed a central light court to serve as the focal point for the entire building and provide daylight to interior offices . Rising two stories , the light court received immediate critical acclaim . " There is nothing bolder , more original , or more inspiring in modern civic architecture than its glass @-@ covered court " , wrote Eastern critic Henry Van Brunt . At a time when Chicago 's bold experiment in architecture was looking eastward for affirmation , this was welcome praise . The light court provides natural illumination for the interior offices . 
 Frank Lloyd Wright was a young architectural assistant working with Adler and Sullivan at the time the Rookery was built in 1886 . Architect Daniel Burnham was a friend of Wright patron Edward C. Waller . Waller managed the Rookery ; Wright had his offices in the building in 1898 – 1899 . In 1905 Wright received the commission to redesign the lobby in the building ; at the time considered the grandest in Chicago . Wright 's work on the Rookery recast the entryway in his Prairie style and added a sense of modernity through his simple but effective lighting design . Wright 's work on the Rookery is his only work on any building within the downtown cityscape . 
 Among Wright 's most significant alterations was the addition of white marble with Persian @-@ style ornamentation . The marble and decorative details added a sense of luxury to the lobby 's steel @-@ laden interior , marked by Burnham and Root 's skeletal metal ribbing . The entire interior space is bright and open . A double set of curving , heavily ornamented stairs wind upward from the lobby 's second floor into the building 's interior . A wrap @-@ around balcony on the second floor enhances the feeling of being within the interior of a " clockwork . " The Wright remodel opened the building up to more of the available light . 
 = = = Load bearing walls and steel structure = = = 
 The red marble , terra cotta and brick facade of the building is a combination of Roman Revival and Queen Anne styles that embraced Richardsonian Romanesque architecture . The building , which is a combination of iron framing and masonry bearing walls , marked a transition from masonry load @-@ bearing structures to steel skeleton load @-@ bearing structures . In fact , the Landmarks Commission citation commends " development of the skeleton structural frame using cast iron columns , wrought iron spandrel beams , and steel beams to support party walls and interior floors " . Aside from the first two floors of metal @-@ framed perimeter walls , the walls are all masonry . The building is known for its semi @-@ circular staircase west of the light court . 
 = = = Renovations = = = 
 While much of the Loop 's 19th @-@ century architecture has been lost to demolition and redevelopment , the Rookery has been spared this fate through a series of well executed renovations . The building remains a commercially successful rental office building , as it was when it was first built . 
 Beginning in the early 20th century , the building underwent three major renovations . In the first , from 1905 to 1907 , Frank Lloyd Wright was retained to remake the interior spaces . In keeping with contemporary tastes , Wright 's design covered Root 's elaborate wrought iron finishes with white carved Carrara marble surfaces . Wright was highly regarded by the public at this point , and his changes brought enhanced status to the building , making the Rookery one of the most sought after buildings of Chicago . Some of Wright 's other changes included incorporating simplified ironwork and adding his trademark style planters and light fixtures . 
 The second renovation , completed August 24 , 1931 by former Wright assistant William Drummond , modernized many of the interior elements , including new elevators , and brought period touches to the building , such as Art Deco detailing . The third renovation , in 1992 , brought the building back to much of its original splendor , reopening the light court ceiling after it had been covered over to protect against leaks . 
 After their purchase of the Rookery in October 2007 , the new owners announced plans for an extensive renovation of the building 's common areas .

 = USS Dunderberg = 
 The USS Dunderberg , which is a Swedish word meaning " thunder ( ing ) mountain , " was an ocean @-@ going casemate ironclad of 14 guns . She resembled an enlarged , two @-@ masted version of the Confederate casemate ironclad CSS Virginia . She was originally designed to have both gun turrets and a casemate but the turrets were deleted while the ship was still building . Construction began in 1862 , but progress was slow and she was not launched until after the end of the American Civil War in 1865 . 
 The ship was not accepted by the Union Navy so its builder began seeking buyers elsewhere ; Otto von Bismarck expressed some interest , and the thought of Prussia armed with such a vessel prompted France to purchase her and commission her in 1867 with the name Rochambeau . She was initially placed in reserve , but was mobilized in 1870 to participate in the Franco @-@ Prussian War . The ship saw no action and was decommissioned after the end of the war . Rochambeau was stricken from the Navy List in 1872 and scrapped in 1874 . 
 = = Design , description and construction = = 
 On 11 April 1862 , William H. Webb , arguably the premier wooden shipbuilder in the country , sent a model of a large wooden @-@ hulled , casemate ironclad with a displacement of about 7 @,@ 000 long tons ( 7 @,@ 100 t ) to the US Navy Department . Webb signed a contract on 3 July with the Navy 's Bureau of Yards and Docks for a ship that had an overall length of 350 feet ( 106 @.@ 7 m ) , a beam of at least 68 feet ( 20 @.@ 7 m ) and a draft of no more than 20 feet 6 inches ( 6 @.@ 2 m ) . His ship was required to make 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) in still water and she was to be armed with four 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) Dahlgren guns in two gun turrets , each protected by 11 inches ( 279 mm ) of armor , and eight 11 @-@ inch Dahlgren guns in a casemate . The ship was to be completed in 15 months at a cost of $ 1 @,@ 250 @,@ 000 . 
 Dunderberg 's contract , as the ship was now named by Webb , was amended on 27 August to specify her armor scheme . Above the main deck , her armor was to be 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 114 mm ) thick . From the main deck to a depth of 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) below the waterline , the armor was to be 3 @.@ 5 inches ( 89 mm ) thick , tapering to 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) at its lower edge . The ship 's main and casemate deck armor was .75 inches ( 19 mm ) thick except at the rear of the ship . The main deck , from the rear of the casemate to the stern , was to consist of 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch armor plates that tapered to 2 @.@ 5 inches in thickness . Dunderberg was to be given a complete double bottom and her engine and boiler rooms were to be completely enclosed by watertight bulkheads . She was also to be provided with two masts and the appropriate rigging . 
 The ship was powered by two back @-@ acting steam engines driving one four @-@ bladed propeller 21 feet ( 6 @.@ 4 m ) feet in diameter , using steam generated by six tubular boilers at a working pressure of 25 psi ( 172 kPa ; 2 kgf / cm2 ) . The engines , designed to produce 4 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 3 @,@ 400 kW ) , and boilers were both subcontracted by Webb to the Etna Iron Works of New York City . The engines were originally intended to have a bore of 90 inches ( 2 @,@ 286 mm ) and a stroke of 45 inches ( 1 @,@ 143 mm ) , but Webb increased the bore to 100 inches ( 2 @,@ 540 mm ) to insure that Dunderberg reached her contract speed . During the ship 's first sea trial on 22 February 1867 , she reached a speed of about 12 @.@ 5 knots ( 23 @.@ 2 km / h ; 14 @.@ 4 mph ) ; during a demonstration for her French buyers on 12 June , Dunderberg reached 13 @.@ 9 knots ( 25 @.@ 7 km / h ; 16 @.@ 0 mph ) . She had two auxiliary boilers to provide steam for the steam engines that powered her pumps , ventilation fans and rotated the gun turrets . These engines , with their bore and stroke of 36 inches ( 914 mm ) , were larger than the main engines of the Passaic @-@ class monitors . All of the boilers exhausted through a retractable funnel . The ship normally carried 540 long tons ( 550 t ) of coal , but could hold a maximum of 1 @,@ 000 long tons ( 1 @,@ 000 t ) . She had a light brigantine rig that had a sail area of 11 @,@ 170 square feet ( 1 @,@ 038 m2 ) . 
 Her keel was laid down before 3 October 1862 at Webb 's shipyard in New York City , even though Webb was forced to use unseasoned oak for Dunderberg because the supply of seasoned timber had been exhausted earlier in the war . <unk> wood was far more prone to rot and significantly shortened the ship 's life . Her hull was very strongly built with the space between her frames filled with timber and diagonal iron straps tied her frames together . The sides of the casemate at the level of the main deck were approximately 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) thick . Before beginning construction , Webb redesigned the hull , increasing its length to 358 feet 8 inches ( 109 @.@ 3 m ) between perpendiculars and its overall length to 377 feet 4 inches ( 115 @.@ 0 m ) . Her beam decreased from 75 feet 6 inches ( 23 @.@ 0 m ) to 72 feet 10 inches ( 22 @.@ 2 m ) and she displaced , at her nominal draft of 18 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) forward and 21 feet ( 6 @.@ 4 m ) aft , 6 @,@ 948 long tons ( 7 @,@ 059 t ) . These changes made her the longest wooden ship ever built . Dunderberg 's hull was protected from biofouling by two external layers of zinc and copper . The ship was fitted with two rudders , the primary one in the usual location aft of the propeller , but she also had an auxiliary rudder placed in the deadwood above and ahead of the propeller . 
 Many other changes were made to Dunderberg while she was under construction and significantly contributed to her delays in completion . The most important of these was the eventual elimination of her turrets which began in October 1863 when Webb wrote to Gideon Welles , Secretary of the Navy , saying that he concurred with the General Superintendent of Ironclads , Rear Admiral Francis Gregory 's suggestion that the " turrets be dispensed with and the casemate lengthened to accommodate an additional number of guns " Welles did not approve the change until September 1864 when he authorized an armament of four 15 @-@ inch and twelve 11 @-@ inch guns in the casemate . This was extended by 73 feet ( 22 @.@ 3 m ) to an approximate overall length of 228 feet ( 69 @.@ 5 m ) so that it now covered the aft magazine and shell room . It was provided with a total of 22 gun ports , six on each broadside , two on each corner and one each facing the bow and stern . The design of the gun ports was another issue that took years to resolve . They were originally sized for the 11 @-@ inch Dahlgren gun with a height of 42 inches ( 1 @,@ 067 mm ) , but this was inadequate to allow the guns to fully elevate as experience with New Ironsides proved . The mounting of the much larger 15 @-@ inch Dahlgren gun in the casemate further complicated the design of the gun ports , especially since the design for their carriages was not even finished until May 1866 . The design of the gunport itself was revised in the second half of 1865 to reduce the chance of projectiles entering them ; the new design was roughly hourglass shaped and narrower in the middle of the casemate than on either the inside or the outside of the gun port . All of these changes to the gun ports delayed the completion of the casemate 's woodwork as well as the cutting and installation of the casemate armor . The angle of the casemate was also changed from the original very shallow 35 ° from the horizontal to an angle of 60 ° after Rear Admiral Joseph Smith , Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks , noted that it would be very difficult to work the guns at such an angle . The deletion of the turrets also required a redesign of the conning tower as Webb had intended to mount it on top of the fore turret . A copy of that used by the Miantonomoh @-@ class monitors was installed between the funnel and the foremast during August 1866 . 
 Dunderberg was built with a plough @-@ shaped 44 @-@ foot ( 13 @.@ 4 m ) , ram bow of which the forward 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) were sheathed in cast iron . Her full armament was not installed before she was sold , but gunnery trials were conducted in February 1867 with two 15 @-@ inch and four 11 @-@ inch guns . With a gun port height of 50 inches ( 1 @,@ 270 mm ) , the 15 @-@ inch guns could elevate + 8 @.@ 5 ° and depress to − 5 ° ; equivalent figures for the 11 @-@ inch guns were + 5 ° and − 7 ° . The 15 @-@ inch guns could traverse 30 ° forward of the beam and 28 ° aft and the 11 @-@ inch Dahlgrens could bear 28 ° to both sides . The only significant problem encountered during the trials was that the gun deck was made of soft pine and did not withstand the force of recoil well . 
 Other problems that delayed the ship 's completion were shortages of material , labor and money . Prices for pig iron and bar iron nearly tripled while boiler plate and copper roughly doubled . Wages of even inexperienced workers increased between 50 and 100 percent . The New York City draft riots in July 1863 and several machinist 's strikes further slowed progress on Dunderberg . Webb failed to account for these problems when negotiating the ship 's contract and he repeatedly tried to charge the Navy for alterations as well as use cheaper materials to reduce his costs . He also attempted to have his contract amended by act of Congress , but he was unsuccessful . The Navy agreed to pay for some of the changes made and it also reduced the reserve amount held back in case the ship did not meet her specifications in 1865 . 
 By about 1864 , both sides regarded the ship as a white elephant ; Welles wrote in his diary that he would rather have the money than the ship and Webb was spending more money than he could anticipate from the contract . Nonetheless , he continued work on the Dunderberg as he had very little other work for his shipyard and , most importantly , in the hope of getting his contract amended to allow him to make a profit . On 22 July 1865 , he launched the ship , now with her hull complete and about half of her armor installed , with much fanfare . The New York Times estimated a crowd of 20 @,@ 000 watched the launching . The following year , the government rejected offers by Peru and Chile to purchase the ship , both then at war with Spain , lest the sale prejudice its lawsuit against Great Britain for selling warships to the Confederacy . Webb did manage to get a private bill passed by Congress in March 1867 that allowed him title to the ship once he repaid all monies advanced to him .

 After Prussia expressed an interest in the ship , the Emperor of France , Napoleon III , bought her in April for 2 @.@ 5 million dollars over the objections of his own navy , which preferred a home @-@ built ship . The exact date of purchase is unknown , but Welles noted in his diary on 7 May that Webb had told him of the sale . On 27 June , Webb refunded the money that had been paid to him and also purchased those items furnished by the government . A little over a week later , he attempted to sail to France , but had to return to port the following day due to engine problems . These were not resolved until 19 July when he , and his entire family , set sail . Dunderberg arrived at Cherbourg on 3 August and the French Navy took possession three days later . 
 The ship was commissioned and renamed Rochambeau , in honor of the Comte de Rochambeau , a general during the American Revolution , on 7 August . After briefly running machinery trials two days later , Rochambeau began an overhaul in the naval dockyard at Cherbourg to fix problems that had become apparent during her delivery voyage and to modify her in accordance with French practices . These changes included the addition of a pilothouse on top of the conning tower , the replacement of the main rudder and the length of her stern was reduced somewhat . Her armament was removed and replaced by four Canon de 270 Modèle 1864 / 66 and 10 Canon de 240 Modèle 1864 / 66 guns , both of which were breech @-@ loading . The 15 @-@ caliber 270 @-@ millimeter ( 10 @.@ 6 in ) guns fired a 216 @-@ kilogram ( 476 lb ) shell while the 17 @-@ caliber 240 @-@ millimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns fired one that weighed 144 kilograms ( 317 lb ) . The 270 mm guns were mounted in the corners of the casemate and could pivot between a broadside gun port and one on the corner . Eight of the 240 mm guns were mounted on the broadside and the remaining two were positioned in the bow and stern gun ports . The remaining four gunports , those on the corners closest to the broadside , were plated over . 
 The French carefully measured the ship during her 1868 overhaul . At the waterline Rochambeau was 107 @.@ 4 meters ( 352 ft 4 in ) long and had a beam of 22 @.@ 15 meters ( 72 ft 8 in ) . She had a mean draft of 6 @.@ 5 meters ( 21 ft 4 in ) , a depth of hold of 7 @.@ 078 meters ( 23 ft 2 @.@ 7 in ) , and displaced 7 @,@ 849 metric tons ( 7 @,@ 725 long tons ) . They rated her engines at only 4 @,@ 000 metric horsepower ( 2 @,@ 900 kW ) , but they produced a maximum of 4 @,@ 657 metric horsepower ( 3 @,@ 425 kW ) and gave an speed just over 15 knots during her machinery trials in June 1868 after the completion of her overhaul . At normal load she carried 540 tonnes ( 530 long tons ) of coal and 735 tonnes ( 723 long tons ) at deep load . In service the ship proved to burn a lot of coal , full bunkers and 30 tonnes ( 30 long tons ) stored on deck only provided her a range of 2 @,@ 200 kilometres ( 1 @,@ 200 nmi ) at a speed of 8 knots ( 15 km / h ; 9 @.@ 2 mph ) . They reduced her sail area to 954 @.@ 42 square meters ( 10 @,@ 273 @.@ 3 sq ft ) . 
 They measured the ship 's armor thickness throughout . The casemate was completely protected by 120 @-@ millimeter ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) plates . The hull armor extended to a depth of 2 @.@ 5 meters ( 8 @.@ 2 ft ) below the waterline and its upper strake was 90 millimeters ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) thick while the lower was 70 millimeters ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) thick . Her decks were covered by 18 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 7 in ) plates and the sides of the conning tower were 250 millimeters ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) thick . In service , Rochambeau proved to be very wet and threw up a lot of spray in a head sea . She had a very quick roll which caused problems when trying to work the guns in heavy weather as even moderate seas could prevent their use altogether since the gun ports were only about 1 @.@ 4 meters ( 4 ft 7 in ) above the waterline . Under sail alone in a good breeze , the ship could not maintain her course , could not be steered and would turn until wind and wave were on her beam . 
 Rochambeau completed her refit on 18 May 1868 and was briefly under the command of Captain ( Capitaine de vaisseau ) Jules @-@ François @-@ Émile Krantz ( a future Minister of Marine ) before being decommissioned on 1 August and placed in reserve . She was refitted from August to December and had her forward hull armor plates replaced by a one @-@ piece cast iron ram . Still in reserve in 1869 , Rochambeau was modified with an additional 240 mm pivot gun mounted over the forward end of the casemate and the pine planking underneath the guns in the casemate was replaced by oak . 
 The ship was recommissioned with a crew of 600 men in mid @-@ July 1870 , just before the beginning of the Franco @-@ Prussian War . She departed Cherbourg on 25 August to join the fleet in Danish waters and reached Copenhagen on 31 August . The fleet fruitlessly cruised the Baltic Sea for several weeks before they were ordered home on 16 September . Rochambeau 's shallow draft meant that she and the armored corvette Thétis were ordered to search the mouth of the Jade Estuary on 26 September for Prussian ships , but they found nothing . 
 Upon her return , Rochambeau was decommissioned again and her crew was ordered to help defend Paris . The ship was stricken from the Navy List ( Liste de la <unk> ) on 15 April 1872 and was scrapped sometime in 1874 .

 The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton , Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company . In this episode , Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) screens his action film Threat Level Midnight to the office after eleven years of writing , shooting , re @-@ shooting , and editing . This film within a film features Michael as Agent Michael Scarn , Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) as Scarn 's robot butler , and Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) as archnemesis " Goldenface " . 
 The episode 's genesis stems from the second season entry " The Client " , in which the office discovers Michael 's incomplete screenplay for Threat Level Midnight . The episode features the reappearance of several actors and actresses who had not appeared on the show in years . Due to the nature of Michael 's film , scenes were filmed to create the illusion as if they had been shot years prior to the episode . " Threat Level Midnight " was viewed by 6 @.@ 41 million viewers and received a 3 @.@ 3 rating among adults between the age of 18 and 49 .

 = = Plot Synopsis = = 
 Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) screens his action film Threat Level Midnight to the office after eleven years of writing , shooting , re @-@ shooting and editing . 
 The plot for the movie is as follows . After Scarn is forced into retirement due to the death of his wife Catherine Zeta @-@ Scarn , the President of the United States of America requests that he prevent Goldenface from blowing up the NHL All @-@ Star Game and killing several hostages . Scarn goes undercover and learns how to play hockey , killing another hockey player to make it into the game , but after confronting Goldenface , he is shot . He later recuperates but learns that the President was in on it all along , leaking footage of Scarn killing the hockey player . Guilt @-@ ridden , he goes to a bar to drown his sorrows . The patrons of the bar sing a song called " The Scarn " and do an accompanying dance , which cheers Scarn up immensely . With his courage restored , Scarn is able to save the day and blow up Goldenface in the process . 
 Michael had shown the office a " work in progress " cut of the film years ago , but the employees all mistook it for a comedy , and Michael was so offended by their laughing that he shut down the screening . Everyone is very eager to see Michael 's film , albeit only because they all appear in it , and Pam Halpert ( Jenna Fischer ) warns everyone to be mindful of how sensitive Michael is and not laugh . However , Pam is unable to keep herself from crying out in horror when she sees her mother cast in the film as a scantily clad nurse , and Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) fails to fully suppress his laughter at " The Scarn " scene , so Michael angrily stops the movie and takes it away . Michael asks Holly Flax ( Amy Ryan ) what she thought and she does not seem impressed . Michael gets angry at her because he considers the film his " dream " , and he then offers the rest of the office the opportunity to finish seeing the film , which they happily accept . While watching , Michael begins noting how the film is not really very good ; he steps outside and tells Holly that it is a bad film but also one that people are having fun watching . They sit down and laugh with the rest of the office through the film 's conclusion .

 = = = Writing and casting = = = 
 This episode was written by executive producer B. J. Novak , who also portrays Ryan Howard on the show . It was directed by Tucker Gates , his fourth directing credit of the series . Michael 's screenplay for Threat Level Midnight was the subplot for second season episode " The Client " , and had subsequently been referenced to in " E @-@ mail Surveillance " , " Product Recall " , " Money " , " Dinner Party " , and " Prince Family Paper " . The idea for the episode came from series ' star Steve Carell , who was leaving the show at the end of the season . He said that he enjoyed the idea behind the " Threat Level Midnight " script and wanted to do a story centered on it . 
 Several former recurring and minor characters make reappearances . Rashida Jones , who portrayed Karen <unk> , noted that it felt like " a time warp " to be asked to appear on the show . Jan Levinson , Michael 's former boss and lover played by Melora Hardin , reappeared in the " Jan @-@ as @-@ diva " mode . Tony Gardner , portrayed by Mike Bruner , cameos as a pianist . Novak rationalized that , despite Gardner being fired on his first day , the character might have appeared in the movie because he was " intrigued " and " flattered " that Michael — after apologizing " profusely " — asked him , or that he might have been " lonely " . 
 Andy Buckley , who portrayed David Wallace , former CFO of Dunder Mifflin , was originally billed as a guest star for this episode and his character was supposed to have a part in Michael 's movie . When NBC first aired the episode , Wallace 's scenes were not shown . It was revealed by Novak that , in the script , Wallace was Michael 's first choice as Goldenface , but turned it down because " it wouldn 't look good to people at Corporate " . Furthermore , Buckley filmed a talking head interview , which had his character exclaiming his regret in not taking the role . This scene was deleted due to time constraints . The scene does not appear on the Season 7 DVD . The script also had a scene that brought back Amy Adams ' character Katy , but it was cut because Adams was working on a movie during the time this episode was filmed . Ellie Kemper , who portrays Erin Hannon on the series , did not appear in the movie ; Novak reasoned that Michael had finished his filming long before she arrived at the office , and had spent the remaining years " editing and procrastinating " . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Writer Novak cites the episode as the " most conceptually ambitious " in the show 's history . More than half the episode consisted of footage from the film . Originally , the producers considered showing just the movie , but they felt that it " would feel like a gimmick or experiment " , and so it was decided that the film would be intercut with shots of the office reacting to the film . In order to make the film seem as if Michael had created it , the film used was colorized in post @-@ production to make it seem as if it were of a cheaper quality than the normal high @-@ quality film that the series used . Certain shooting methods , like hand @-@ held and zooms , were nixed , except for in cases where they could be presented in a " poorly @-@ executed " manner . This was done in a way to make it appear that Michael at least knew what he was doing ; Novak explained that the crew " didn 't want the joke of the episode to be how bad he was at filmmaking " because it would " be a little easy and a little out of character " . To create the fake dummy of Toby that exploded , Paul Lieberstein was required to spend several hours in a full @-@ face mold that reportedly " unnerved him greatly " . Two molds were taken . Both were filled with explosives , but one was filled with fake blood . Both were shot with slow @-@ motion cameras . However , the dummy with the fake blood in it was considered " too disturbing for us and arguably too disturbing for Michael " , and so the tamer explosion was used . 
 Due to the nature of Michael 's film , Novak realized that scenes would have to be filmed as if they had been shot years prior to the episode . In order to successfully pull this off , editor David Rogers and script supervisor Veda <unk> were tasked with " mapping out " every scene to make sure the continuity of the series was preserved . Novak later elaborated on the continuity during an interview with The Office fansite OfficeTally . The scene featuring " The Scarn " would have been filmed after the corporate merger that occurred during the third season ; this would explain Karen 's willingness to deliver her lines , as she would be " eager to fit in " . Stanley 's voiceover was recorded " on a lunch break " sometime after the fourth season episode " Local Ad " because he had " got a big kick out of seeing himself " in Michael 's commercial . Helene 's scenes were filmed sometime when Michael was dating her during the early part of the sixth season . 
 In addition to the mapping out of sequences , the episode features a short sequence that was shot to look as if it had been filmed during the show 's second season , although the scene itself was filmed in 2011 . Novak explained that , in order to recreate the shot , great lengths had to be taken to ensure the authenticity of the footage . Series Department Head make @-@ up artist LaVerne <unk> @-@ Milazzo and Hair Department Head Kim M. Ferry " put great care and effort into recreating the characters ' looks from earlier seasons " ; Novak , for instance wore " the same bright blue shirt that Ryan used to favor " and fake sideburns were glued onto the actor 's face to " match the era " . He also stated that the actors " remembered those dynamics [ from the second season ] and fell right back into them . " This is not the first nor the last time this trick has been utilized on the show . For instance , during the cold opening for the sixth season episode " Shareholder Meeting " featuring " <unk> " , a montage of Dwight harassing past receptionists was shown . Furthermore , the episode " Customer Loyalty " from the ninth season featured a montage of Jim setting up a prank supposedly during the show 's second season . Appropriately , the montage was filmed to look as if the documentarians were using archival footage of Jim ; his hair matches the style that Jim had during the first few seasons of the show . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 According to the clippings on the wall , Scarn had previously saved the NFL , the MLB , and the NBA all @-@ star games . Several Billy Joel songs play throughout the episode , such as " Running on Ice " and " Pressure " . A Dave Barry page @-@ a @-@ day calendar is featured in a montage to illustrate the passing of time . Michael mentions both Oceans 11 and Antz in defense of his movie . The latter is featured in a diatribe Michael delivers about Woody Allen and how you should always listen to your fans . The murder scene in which Scarn kills the unnamed hockey opponent ( portrayed by Oscar Martinez on the show ) parodies Walter White 's first direct murder of Krazy @-@ 8 from the episode " ... And the Bag 's in the River " from Breaking Bad .

This marked a decrease in viewers from the previous episode .

 IGN writer Cindy White awarded the episode a 9 out of 10 — denoting an " amazing " episode — and praised the self @-@ awareness of Michael Scott and Steve Carell 's performance . She ultimately said the episode was good enough to be Carell 's last episode . Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste wrote that " there wasn ’ t a ton of action this week , but it was just enough to keep Michael ’ s personal growth on our radar as we continue to brace ourselves for his grand finale . " 
 Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode five out of five stars , and called it one of " the best episodes in years " . Forcella praised the " continuity and callbacks " . He also noted that the tension between Michael and Holly were " easing the viewers towards the end of Carrell 's [ sic ] stay at The Office " . Alan Sepinwall wrote that , despite the episode being " goofy [ … ] silly , and [ and ] about as nonsensical as the film itself " , " Threat Level Midnight " was " a fun , sweet tour through the history of the Michael Scott era " . 
 Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a " B " and wrote that " there is no question that [ it ] is a fan service . " He called it a " mixed bag " ; on one hand , he noted that some of the scenes were clever , such as Darryl 's opinion on portraying a black president before Obama was elected . On the other hand , however , he felt that Michael 's " juvenile " response to Holly was uncharacteristic , and the " oddly high production values and camera work " were unrealistic for the show . He also felt the inclusion of some characters — such as Roy , Jan , or Karen — did not make sense in the context of the series . He concluded , however , that while the episode had issues , " the actual content of Threat Level Midnight was successful in more ways than I had expected " . Rick Porter of Zap2it gave the episode a more mixed review , saying that it " had moments that were a huge amount of fun , both inside Michael 's labor of love and in people 's reaction to it . But it also felt a little bit clip @-@ showy . " 
 = SMS Rheinland = 
 SMS Rheinland was one of four Nassau @-@ class battleships , the first dreadnoughts built for the German Imperial Navy ( Kaiserliche Marine ) . Rheinland mounted twelve 28 cm ( 11 in ) main guns in six twin turrets in an unusual hexagonal arrangement . The navy built Rheinland and her sister ships in response to the revolutionary British HMS Dreadnought , which had been launched in 1906 . Rheinland was laid down in June 1907 , launched the following year in October , and commissioned in April 1910 . 
 Rheinland 's extensive service with the High Seas Fleet during World War I included several fleet advances into the North Sea , some in support of raids against the English coast conducted by the German battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group . These sorties culminated in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916 , in which Rheinland was heavily engaged by British destroyers in close @-@ range night fighting . 
 The ship also saw duty in the Baltic Sea , as part of the support force for the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in 1915 . She returned to the Baltic as the core of an expeditionary force to aid the White Finns in the Finnish Civil War in 1918 , but ran aground shortly after arriving in the area . Significant portions of her armor and all her main guns had to be removed before she could be refloated . The damage done by the grounding was deemed too severe to justify repairs and Rheinland was decommissioned to be used as a barracks ship for the remainder of the war . In 1919 , following the scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow , Rheinland was ceded to the Allies who , in turn , sold the vessel to ship @-@ breakers in the Netherlands . The ship was eventually broken up for scrap metal starting in 1920 . Her bell is on display at the Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr in Dresden . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Rheinland was ordered under the provisional name Ersatz Württemberg , as a replacement for the old Sachsen @-@ class ironclad Württemberg . She was laid down on 1 June 1907 at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin . Like her sister Nassau , construction proceeded under absolute secrecy ; detachments of soldiers guarded the shipyard itself , as well as contractors such as Krupp that supplied building materials . The ship was launched on 26 September 1908 ; at the launching ceremony the ship was christened by Elisabeth of Wied and Clemens Freiherr von <unk> @-@ <unk> gave a speech . Fitting @-@ out work was completed by the end of February 1910 . A dockyard crew was used for limited sea trials , which lasted from 23 February to 4 March 1910 off Swinemünde . She was then taken to Kiel , where she was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 30 April 1910 . More sea trials followed in the Baltic Sea . 
 The ship was 146 @.@ 1 m ( 479 ft 4 in ) long , 26 @.@ 9 m ( 88 ft 3 in ) wide , and had a draft of 8 @.@ 9 m ( 29 ft 2 in ) . She displaced 18 @,@ 873 t ( 18 @,@ 575 long tons ) with a normal load , and 20 @,@ 535 t ( 20 @,@ 211 long tons ) fully laden . She retained coal @-@ fired 3 @-@ shaft triple expansion engines instead of more advanced turbine engines . This type of machinery was chosen at the request of both Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz and the Navy 's construction department ; the latter stated in 1905 that the " use of turbines in heavy warships does not recommend itself . " 
 Rheinland carried twelve 28 cm ( 11 in ) SK L / 45 guns in an unusual hexagonal configuration . Her secondary armament consisted of twelve 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) SK L / 45 guns and sixteen 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) SK L / 45 guns , all of which were mounted in casemates . The ship was also armed with six 45 cm ( 18 in ) submerged torpedo tubes . One tube was mounted in the bow , another in the stern , and two on each broadside , on both ends of the torpedo bulkheads . 
 = = Commanding officers = = 
 Rheinland was initially commanded by Kapitän zur See ( KzS ) Albert Hopman , from her commissioning until August 1910 . He was temporarily replaced by Korvettenkapitän Wilhelm Bunnemann when the ship 's crew was reduced to commission the battlecruiser Von der Tann in September 1910 . Hopman returned to the ship later that month , and held command through September 1911 . KzS Richard Engel replaced Hopman in 1911 and commanded the ship until August 1915 . That month , he left the ship and KzS Heinrich Rohardt was given command of Rheinland . He served for over a year , until December 1916 , when he was replaced by Korvettenkapitän Theodor von <unk> . <unk> 's command lasted until September 1918 ; he was replaced by KzS Ernst Toussaint , who held command of the ship for less than a month . Fregattenkapitän Friedrich Berger was the ship 's last commander , serving from September 1918 until the ship 's decommissioning on 4 October . 
 = = Service history = = 
 At the conclusion of trials on 30 August 1910 , Rheinland was taken to Wilhelmshaven , where a significant portion of the crew was transferred to the new battlecruiser Von der Tann . Following the autumn fleet maneuvers in September , the crew was replenished with crewmembers from the old pre @-@ dreadnought Zähringen , which was decommissioned at the same time . Rheinland was then assigned to the I Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet . In October , the fleet went on the annual winter cruise , followed by fleet exercises in November . The ship took part in the summer cruises to Norway each August in 1911 , 1913 , and 1914 . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 Rheinland participated in nearly all of the fleet advances throughout the war . The first such operation was conducted primarily by the battlecruisers ; the ships bombarded Scarborough , Hartlepool , and Whitby on 15 – 16 December 1914 . During the operation , the German battle fleet of some 12 dreadnoughts and 8 pre @-@ dreadnoughts , which was serving as distant support for the battlecruisers , came to within 10 nmi ( 19 km ; 12 mi ) of an isolated squadron of six British battleships . However , skirmishes between the rival destroyer screens convinced the German commander , Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl , that he was confronted with the entire Grand Fleet . He broke off the engagement and turned for home . A fleet sortie to the Dogger Bank took place on 24 April 1915 . During the operation , the high @-@ pressure cylinder of Rheinland 's starboard engine failed . Repair work lasted until 23 May . 
 = = = = Battle of the Gulf of Riga = = = = 
 In August 1915 , the German fleet attempted to clear the Russian @-@ held Gulf of Riga in order to facilitate the capture of Riga by the German army . To do so , the German planners intended to drive off or destroy the Russian naval forces in the Gulf , which included the pre @-@ dreadnought battleship Slava and a number of gunboats and destroyers . The German naval force would also lay a series of minefields in the northern entrance to the Gulf to prevent Russian naval reinforcements from reentering the area . The assembled German fleet included Rheinland and her three sister ships , the four Helgoland @-@ class battleships , and the battlecruisers Von der Tann , Moltke , and Seydlitz . The force operated under the command of Vice Admiral Franz von Hipper . The eight battleships were to provide cover for the forces engaging the Russian flotilla . The first attempt on 8 August was unsuccessful , as it had taken too long to clear the Russian minefields to allow the minelayer Deutschland to lay a minefield of her own . 
 On 16 August 1915 , a second attempt was made to enter the Gulf : Nassau and Posen , four light cruisers , and 31 torpedo boats managed to breach the Russian defenses . On the first day of the assault , the German minesweeper T46 was sunk , as was the destroyer V99 . The following day , Nassau and Posen engaged in an artillery duel with Slava , resulting in three hits on the Russian ship that forced her to retreat . By 19 August , the Russian minefields had been cleared and the flotilla entered the Gulf . However , reports of Allied submarines in the area prompted the Germans to call off the operation the following day . Admiral Hipper later remarked that " To keep valuable ships for a considerable time in a limited area in which enemy submarines were increasingly active , with the corresponding risk of damage and loss , was to indulge in a gamble out of all proportion to the advantage to be derived from the occupation of the Gulf before the capture of Riga from the land side . " 
 = = = = Return to the North Sea = = = = 
 By the end of August , Rheinland and the rest of the High Seas Fleet units were back in their bases on the North Sea . The next operation conducted was a sweep into the North Sea on 11 – 12 September , though it ended without any action . Another sortie followed on 23 – 24 October during which the German fleet did not encounter any British forces . On 12 February 1916 , Rheinland was sent to the dockyard for an extensive overhaul , which lasted until 19 April . Rheinland was back with the fleet in time to participate in another advance into the North Sea on 21 – 22 April . Another bombardment mission followed two days later ; Rheinland was part of the battleship support for the I Scouting Group battlecruisers that attacked Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24 – 25 April . During this operation , the battlecruiser Seydlitz was damaged by a British mine and had to return to port prematurely . Visibility was poor , so the operation was quickly called off before the British fleet could intervene . 
 = = = = Battle of Jutland = = = = 
 Admiral Reinhard Scheer immediately planned another attack on the British coast , but the damage to Seydlitz and condenser trouble on several of the III Battle Squadron dreadnoughts delayed the plan until the end of May . The German battlefleet departed the Jade at 03 : 30 on 31 May . Rheinland was assigned to the II Division of the I Battle Squadron , under the command of Rear Admiral W. Engelhardt . Rheinland was the second ship in the division , astern of Posen and ahead of Nassau and Westfalen . The II Division was the last unit of dreadnoughts in the fleet ; they were followed by the elderly pre @-@ dreadnoughts of the II Battle Squadron . 
 Between 17 : 48 and 17 : 52 , 11 German dreadnoughts , including Rheinland , engaged and opened fire on the British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron , though the range and poor visibility prevented effective fire , which was soon checked . Some ten minutes later Rheinland again opened fire on the British cruisers , targeting what was most likely HMS Southampton , though without success . By 20 : 15 , the German fleet had faced the deployed Grand Fleet for a second time and was forced to turn away ; in doing so , the order of the German line was reversed , with Rheinland third from the front , behind Westfalen and Nassau . At 21 : 22 , crewmen aboard Rheinland and Westfalen , the two leading ships in the German line , spotted two torpedo tracks that turned out to be imaginary . The ships were then forced to slow down in order to allow the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group to pass ahead . Around 22 : 00 , Rheinland and Westfalen observed unidentified light forces in the gathering darkness . After flashing a challenge via searchlight that was ignored , the two ships turned away to starboard in order to evade any torpedoes that might have been fired . The rest of I Battle Squadron followed them . 
 At about 00 : 30 , the leading units of the German line encountered British destroyers and cruisers . A violent firefight at close range ensued ; Rheinland pounded the armored cruiser HMS Black Prince with her secondary guns at a range of 2 @,@ 200 to 2 @,@ 600 m ( 2 @,@ 400 to 2 @,@ 800 yd ) . After a few minutes , Rheinland and the rest of the German battleships turned away to avoid torpedoes . At 00 : 36 , Rheinland was hit by a pair of 6 @-@ inch ( 15 cm ) shells from Black Prince . One of the shells cut the cables to the four forward searchlights and damaged the forward funnel . The second struck the side of the ship and exploded on the forward armored transverse bulkhead . Although the bulkhead was bent inward from the explosion , it was not penetrated . About 45 minutes later , Rheinland opened fire on another destroyer , possibly Ardent , but she had to cease when a German cruiser came too close to the line of fire . At the same time , Black Prince was obliterated by accurate fire from the battleship Ostfriesland . 
 Despite the ferocity of the night fighting , the High Seas Fleet punched through the British destroyer forces and reached Horns Reef by 04 : 00 on 1 June . The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later , where Rheinland refueled and re @-@ armed . Meanwhile , her three sisters stood out in the roadstead in defensive positions . Over the course of the battle , the ship had fired thirty @-@ five 28 cm ( 11 in ) shells and twenty @-@ six 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) rounds . The two hits from Black Prince had killed 10 men and wounded 20 . Repair work followed immediately in Wilhelmshaven and was completed by 10 June .

 Another fleet advance followed on 18 – 22 August ; the I Scouting Group battlecruisers were to bombard the coastal town of Sunderland in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty 's battlecruisers . As only two of the four German battlecruisers were still in fighting condition , three dreadnoughts were assigned to the Scouting Group for the operation : Markgraf , Grosser Kurfürst ( or Großer Kurfürst ) , and the newly commissioned Bayern . Rheinland and the rest of the High Seas Fleet were to trail behind and provide cover . The British were aware of the German plans and sortied the Grand Fleet to meet them . By 14 : 35 , Admiral Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet 's approach and , unwilling to engage the whole of the Grand Fleet just 11 weeks after the decidedly close call at Jutland , turned his forces around and retreated to German ports . 
 Rheinland covered a sweep by torpedo boats into the North Sea on 25 – 26 September . She then participated in a fleet advance on 18 – 20 October . In early 1917 , the ship was stationed on sentry duty in the German Bight . The crew became unruly due to poor quality food in July and August of that year . The ship did not take part directly in Operation Albion against the Russians , but remained in the western Baltic to prevent a possible incursion by the British to support their Russian ally .

 On 22 February 1918 , Rheinland and her sister Westfalen were tasked with a mission to Finland to support German army units to be deployed there . The ship arrived in the Åland Islands on 6 March , where her commander became the Senior Naval Commander , a position he held until 10 April . On 11 April , the ship departed the <unk> for Helsinki , with the intention of proceeding to Danzig to refuel . However , she encountered heavy fog while en route and ran aground on <unk> Island at 07 : 30 . Two men were killed in the incident and the ship was badly damaged . Three boiler rooms were flooded and the inner hull was pierced . <unk> efforts on 18 – 20 April proved unsuccessful . The crew was removed temporarily , to bring the pre @-@ dreadnought Schlesien back into service . On 8 May , a floating crane was brought in from Danzig ; the main guns , some of the turret armor , and the bow and citadel armor were all removed . The ship was lightened by 6 @,@ 400 metric tons ( 6 @,@ 300 long tons ; 7 @,@ 100 short tons ) — more than a third of her normal displacement — and with the aid of pontoons , eventually refloated by 9 July . The ship was towed to Mariehamn where some limited repairs were effected . On 24 July the ship departed for Kiel with the assistance of two tug boats ; she arrived there three days later . It was determined that repair work was impractical and instead the ship was decommissioned on 4 October and placed into service as a barracks ship in Kiel .

 Following the German collapse in November 1918 , a significant portion of the High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow according to the terms of the Armistice . Rheinland and her three sisters were not among the ships listed for internment , so they remained in German ports . However , a copy of The Times informed von Reuter that the Armistice was to expire at noon on 21 June 1919 , the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty . Rear Admiral von Reuter came to the conclusion that the British intended to seize the German ships after the Armistice expired . To prevent this , he decided to scuttle his ships at the first opportunity . On the morning of 21 June , the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers ; at 11 : 20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships . 
 As a result of the scuttling at Scapa Flow , the Allies demanded replacements for the ships that had been sunk . This included Rheinland , which was struck from the German naval list on 5 November 1919 and subsequently handed over to the Allies . The ship was sold on 28 June 1920 to ship @-@ breakers in Dordrecht in the Netherlands , under the contract name " F " . She was towed there a month later on 29 July and broken up by the end of the following year . Rheinland 's bell is preserved at the Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr in Dresden . 
 = Margaret Fuller = 
 Sarah Margaret Fuller Ossoli ( May 23 , 1810 – July 19 , 1850 ) , commonly known as Margaret Fuller , was an American journalist , critic , and women 's rights advocate associated with the American transcendentalism movement . She was the first full @-@ time American female book reviewer in journalism . Her book Woman in the Nineteenth Century is considered the first major feminist work in the United States . 
 Born Sarah Margaret Fuller in Cambridge , Massachusetts , she was given a substantial early education by her father , Timothy Fuller . She later had more formal schooling and became a teacher before , in 1839 , she began overseeing what she called " conversations " : discussions among women meant to compensate for their lack of access to higher education . She became the first editor of the transcendentalist journal The Dial in 1840 , before joining the staff of the New York Tribune under Horace Greeley in 1844 . By the time she was in her 30s , Fuller had earned a reputation as the best @-@ read person in New England , male or female , and became the first woman allowed to use the library at Harvard College . Her seminal work , Woman in the Nineteenth Century , was published in 1845 . A year later , she was sent to Europe for the Tribune as its first female correspondent . She soon became involved with the revolutions in Italy and allied herself with Giuseppe Mazzini . She had a relationship with Giovanni Ossoli , with whom she had a child . All three members of the family died in a shipwreck off Fire Island , New York , as they were traveling to the United States in 1850 . Fuller 's body was never recovered . 
 Fuller was an advocate of women 's rights and , in particular , women 's education and the right to employment . She also encouraged many other reforms in society , including prison reform and the emancipation of slaves in the United States . Many other advocates for women 's rights and feminism , including Susan B. Anthony , cite Fuller as a source of inspiration . Many of her contemporaries , however , were not supportive , including her former friend Harriet Martineau . She said that Fuller was a talker rather than an activist . Shortly after Fuller 's death , her importance faded ; the editors who prepared her letters to be published , believing her fame would be short @-@ lived , censored or altered much of her work before publication .

 Sarah Margaret Fuller was born on May 23 , 1810 , in <unk> , Massachusetts , the first child of Timothy Fuller and Margaret Crane Fuller . She was named after her paternal grandmother and her mother , but by age nine she dropped " Sarah " and insisted on being called " Margaret . " The Margaret Fuller House , in which she was born , is still standing . Her father taught her to read and write at the age of three and a half , shortly after the couple 's second daughter , Julia Adelaide , died at 14 months old . He offered her an education as rigorous as any boy 's at the time and forbade her to read the typical feminine fare of the time , such as etiquette books and sentimental novels . He incorporated Latin into his teaching shortly after the birth of the couple 's son Eugene in May 1815 , and soon Margaret was translating simple passages from Virgil . Later in life Margaret blamed her father 's exacting love and his valuation of accuracy and precision for her childhood nightmares and sleepwalking . During the day Margaret spent time with her mother , who taught her household chores and sewing . In 1817 , her brother William Henry Fuller was born , and her father was elected as a representative in the United States Congress . For the next eight years , he spent four to six months a year in Washington , D.C. At age 10 , Fuller wrote a cryptic note which her father saved : " On 23 May 1810 , was born one foredoomed to sorrow and pain , and like others to have misfortunes . " 
 Fuller began her formal education at the Port School in <unk> in 1819 before attending the Boston Lyceum for Young Ladies from 1821 to 1822 . In 1824 , she was sent to the School for Young Ladies in Groton , on the advice of aunts and uncles , though she resisted the idea at first . While she was there , Timothy Fuller did not run for re @-@ election , in order to help John Quincy Adams with his presidential campaign in 1824 ; he hoped Adams would return the favor with a governmental appointment . On June 17 , 1825 , Fuller attended the ceremony at which the American Revolutionary War hero Marquis de Lafayette laid the cornerstone of the Bunker Hill Monument 50 years after the battle . Fuller left the Groton school after two years and returned home at 16 . At home she studied the classics and trained herself in several modern languages and read world literature . By this time , she realized she did not fit in with other young women her age . She wrote , " I have felt that I was not born to the common womanly lot . " Eliza Farrar , wife of Harvard professor John Farrar and author of The Young Lady 's Friend ( 1836 ) , attempted to train her in feminine etiquette until the age of 20 , but was never wholly successful . 
 = = = Early career = = = 
 Fuller was an avid reader . By the time she was in her 30s , she had earned a reputation as the best @-@ read person , male or female , in New England . She used her knowledge to give private lessons based on the teaching style of Elizabeth Palmer Peabody . Fuller hoped to earn her living through journalism and translation ; her first published work , a response to historian George Bancroft , appeared in November 1834 in the North American Review . When she was 23 , her father 's law practice failed and he moved the family to a farm in Groton . On February 20 , 1835 , Frederic Henry Hedge and James Freeman Clarke asked her to contribute to each of their periodicals . Clarke helped her publish her first literary review in the Western Messenger in June : criticisms of recent biographies on George Crabbe and Hannah More . In the fall of that year , she suffered a terrible migraine with a fever that lasted nine days . Fuller continued to experience such headaches throughout her life . While she was still recovering , her father died of cholera on October 2 , 1835 . She was deeply affected by his death : " My father 's image follows me constantly " , she wrote . She vowed to step in as the head of the family and take care of her widowed mother and younger siblings . Her father had not left a will , and two of her uncles gained control of his property and finances , later assessed at $ 18 @,@ 098 @.@ 15 , and the family had to rely on them for support . Humiliated by the way her uncles were treating the family , Fuller wrote that she regretted being " of the softer sex , and never more than now " . 
 Around this time , Fuller was hoping to prepare a biography of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe , but felt that she could work on it only if she traveled to Europe . Her father 's death and her sudden responsibility for her family caused her to abandon this idea . In 1836 , Fuller was given a job teaching at Bronson Alcott 's Temple School in Boston , where she remained for a year . She then accepted an invitation to teach under Hiram Fuller ( no relation ) at the Greene Street School in Providence , Rhode Island , in April 1837 with the unusually high salary of $ 1 @,@ 000 per year . Her family sold the Groton farm and Fuller moved with them to Jamaica Plain , Massachusetts . On November 6 , 1839 , Fuller held the first of her " conversations " , discussions among local women who met in the Boston home of the <unk> . Fuller intended to compensate for the lack of women 's education with discussions and debates focused on subjects including the fine arts , history , mythology , literature , and nature . Serving as the " nucleus of conversation " , Fuller also intended to answer the " great questions " facing women : " What were we born to do ? How shall we do it ? which so few ever propose to themselves ' till their best years are gone by " . A number of significant figures in the women 's rights movement attended these gatherings , including Sophia Dana Ripley , Caroline Sturgis , and Maria White Lowell . 
 = = = The Dial = = = 
 In October 1839 , Ralph Waldo Emerson was seeking an editor for his transcendentalist journal The Dial . After several declined the position , he offered it to Fuller , referring to her as " my vivacious friend . " Emerson had met Fuller in Cambridge in 1835 ; of that meeting , he admitted " she made me laugh more than I liked . " The next summer , Fuller spent two weeks at Emerson 's home in Concord . Fuller accepted Emerson 's offer to edit The Dial on October 20 , 1839 , and began work in the first week of 1840 . She edited the journal for its first two years from 1840 to 1842 , though her promised annual salary of $ 200 was never paid . Because of her role , she was soon recognized as one of the most important figures of the transcendental movement and was invited to George Ripley 's Brook Farm , a communal experiment . Fuller never officially joined the community but was a frequent visitor , often spending New Year 's Eve there . In the summer of 1843 , she traveled to Chicago , Milwaukee , Niagara Falls , and Buffalo , New York ; while there , she interacted with several Native Americans , including members of the Ottawa and the Chippewa tribes . She reported her experiences in a book called Summer on the Lakes , which she completed writing on her 34th birthday in 1844 . The critic Evert Augustus Duyckinck called it " the only genuine book , I can think of , this season . " Fuller used the library at Harvard College to do research on the Great Lakes region , and became the first woman allowed to use Harvard 's library . 
 Fuller 's " The Great Lawsuit " was written in serial form for The Dial . She originally intended to name the work The Great Lawsuit : Man ' versus ' Men , Woman ' versus ' Women ; when it was expanded and published independently in 1845 , it was titled Woman in the Nineteenth Century . After completing it , she wrote to a friend : " I had put a good deal of my true self in it , as if , I suppose I went away now , the measure of my footprint would be left on earth . " The work discussed the role that women played in American democracy and Fuller 's opinion on possibilities for improvement . It has since become one of the major documents in American feminism . It is considered the first of its kind in the United States . 
 = = = New York Tribune = = = 
 Fuller left The Dial in 1844 in part because of ill health but also because of her disappointment with the publication 's dwindling subscription list . She moved to New York that autumn and joined Horace Greeley 's New York Tribune as literary critic , becoming the first full @-@ time book reviewer in American journalism and , by 1846 , the publication 's first female editor . Her first article , a review of a collection of essays by Emerson , appeared in the December 1 , 1844 , issue . At this time , the Tribune had some 50 @,@ 000 subscribers and Fuller earned $ 500 a year for her work . In addition to American books , she reviewed foreign literature , concerts , lectures , and art exhibits . During her four years with the publication , she published more than 250 columns , most signed with a " * " as a byline . In these columns , Fuller discussed topics ranging from art and literature to political and social issues such as the plight of slaves and women 's rights . She also published poetry ; her poems , styled after the work of Emerson , do not have the same intellectual vigor as her criticism . 
 Around this time , she was also involved in a scandal involving fellow literary critic Edgar Allan Poe , who had been carrying on a public flirtation with the married poet Frances Sargent Osgood . Another poet , Elizabeth F. Ellet , had become enamored of Poe and jealous of Osgood and suggested the relationship between Poe and Osgood was more than an innocent flirtation . Osgood then sent Fuller and Anne Lynch Botta to Poe 's cottage on her behalf to request that he return the personal letters she had sent him . Angered by their interference , Poe called them " Busy @-@ bodies " . A public scandal erupted and continued until Osgood 's estranged husband Samuel Stillman Osgood stepped in and threatened to sue Ellet . 
 = = = Assignment in Europe = = = 
 In 1846 the New York Tribune sent Fuller to Europe , specifically England and Italy , as its first female foreign correspondent . She traveled from Boston to Liverpool in August on the Cambria , a vessel that used both sail and steam to make the journey in ten days and sixteen hours . Over the next four years she provided the Tribune with thirty @-@ seven reports . She interviewed many prominent writers including George Sand and Thomas Carlyle — whom she found disappointing because of his reactionary politics , among other things . George Sand had previously been an idol of hers , but Fuller was disappointed when Sand chose not to run for the French National Assembly , saying that women were not ready to vote or to hold political office . Fuller was also given a letter of introduction to Elizabeth Barrett by Cornelius Mathews , but never met her , because Barrett had just eloped with Robert Browning . 
 In England in the spring of 1846 , she met Giuseppe Mazzini , who had been in exile there from Italy since 1837 . Fuller also met the Italian revolutionary Giovanni Angelo Ossoli , a marquis who had been disinherited by his family because of his support for Mazzini . Fuller and Ossoli moved in together in Florence , Italy , likely before they were married , though whether they ever married is uncertain . Fuller was originally opposed to marrying him , in part because of the difference in their religions ; she was Protestant and he was Roman Catholic . Emerson speculated that the couple was " married perhaps in Oct. Nov. or Dec " of 1847 , though he did not explain his reasoning . Biographers have speculated that the couple married on April 4 , 1848 , to celebrate the anniversary of their first meeting . By the time the couple moved to Florence , they were referred to as husband and wife , though it is unclear if any formal ceremony took place . It seems certain that at the time their child was born , they were not married . By New Year 's Day 1848 , she suspected that she was pregnant but kept it from Ossoli for several weeks . Their child , Angelo Eugene Philip Ossoli , was born in early September 1848 and nicknamed Angelino . The couple was very secretive about their relationship but , after Angelino suffered an unnamed illness , they became less so . Fuller informed her mother about Ossoli and Angelino in August 1849 in a letter that explained that she had kept silent so as not to upset her " but it has become necessary , on account of the child , for us to live publicly and permanently together . " Her mother 's response makes it clear that she was aware that the couple was not legally married . Even so , she was happy for her daughter , writing : " I send my first kiss with my fervent blessing to my grandson . " 
 The couple supported Giuseppe Mazzini 's revolution for the establishment of a Roman Republic in 1849 . Ossoli fought in the struggle while Fuller volunteered at a supporting hospital . When the republicans they supported met defeat , they had to flee Italy and decided to move to the United States . She intended to use her experience to write a book about the history of the Roman Republic — a work she may have begun as early as 1847 — and hoped to find an American publisher after a British one rejected it . She believed the work would be her most important , referring to it in a March 1849 letter to her brother Richard as , " something good which may survive my troubled existence . " 
 = = = Death = = = 
 In the beginning of 1850 , Fuller wrote to a friend : " It has long seemed that in the year 1850 I should stand on some important plateau in the ascent of life ... I feel however no marked and important change as yet . " Also that year , Fuller wrote : " I am absurdly fearful and various omens have combined to give me a dark feeling ... It seems to me that my future upon earth will soon close ... I have a vague expectation of some crisis — I know not what " . A few days after writing this , Fuller , Ossoli , and their child began a five @-@ week return voyage to the United States aboard the ship Elizabeth , an American merchant freighter carrying cargo that included mostly marble from Carrara . They set sail on May 17 . At sea , the ship 's captain , Seth Hasty , died of smallpox . Angelino contracted the disease and recovered . 
 Possibly because of the inexperienced first mate , now serving as captain , the ship slammed into a sandbar less than 100 yards from Fire Island , New York , on July 19 , 1850 , around 3 : 30 a.m. Many of the other passengers and crew members abandoned ship . The first mate , Mr. Bangs , urged Fuller and Ossoli to try to save themselves and their child as he himself jumped overboard , later claiming he believed Fuller had wanted to be left behind to die . On the beach , people arrived with carts hoping to salvage any cargo washed ashore . None made any effort to rescue the crew or passengers of the Elizabeth , though they were only 50 yards from shore . Most of those aboard attempted to swim to shore , leaving Fuller and Ossoli and Angelino some of the last on the ship . Ossoli was thrown overboard by a massive wave and , after the wave had passed , a crewman who witnessed the event said Fuller could not be seen . 
 Henry David Thoreau traveled to New York , at the urging of Emerson , to search the shore but neither Fuller 's body nor that of her husband was ever recovered . Angelino 's had washed ashore . Few of their possessions were found other than some of the child 's clothes and a few letters . Fuller 's manuscript on the history of the Roman Republic was also lost . A memorial to Fuller was erected on the beach at Fire Island in 1901 through the efforts of Julia Ward Howe . A cenotaph to Fuller and Ossoli , under which Angelino is buried , is in Mount Auburn Cemetery , Cambridge , Massachusetts . The inscription reads , in part : 
 Within a week after her death , Horace Greeley suggested to Emerson that a biography of Fuller , to be called Margaret and Her Friends , be prepared quickly " before the interest excited by her sad decease has passed away " . Many of her writings were soon collected together by her brother Arthur as At Home and Abroad ( 1856 ) and Life Without and Life Within ( 1858 ) . He also edited a new version of Woman in the Nineteenth Century in 1855 . In February 1852 , The Memoirs of Margaret Fuller Ossoli was published , edited by Emerson , James Freeman Clarke , and William Henry Channing , though much of the work was censored or reworded . It left out details about her love affair with Ossoli and an earlier relationship with a man named James Nathan . The three editors , believing the public interest in Fuller would be short @-@ lived and that she would not survive as a historical figure , were not concerned about accuracy . For a time , it was the best @-@ selling biography of the decade and went through thirteen editions before the end of the century . The book focused on her personality rather than her work . Detractors of the book ignored her status as a critic and instead criticized her personal life and her " unwomanly " arrogance . 
 = = Beliefs = = 
 Fuller was an early proponent of feminism and especially believed in providing education to women . Once equal educational rights were afforded women , she believed , women could push for equal political rights as well . She advocated that women seek any employment they wish , rather than catering to the stereotypical " feminine " roles of the time , such as teaching . She once said , " If you ask me what office women should fill , I reply — any ... let them be sea captains if you will . I do not doubt that there are women well fitted for such an office " . She had great confidence in all women but doubted that a woman would produce a lasting work of art or literature in her time and disliked the popular female poets of her time . Fuller also warned women to be careful about marriage and not to become dependent on their husbands . As she wrote , " I wish woman to live , first for God 's sake . Then she will not make an imperfect man for her god , and thus sink to idolatry . Then she will not take what is not fit for her from a sense of weakness and poverty " . By 1832 , she had made a personal commitment to stay single . Fuller also questioned a definitive line between male and female : " There is no wholly masculine man ... no purely feminine " but that both were present in any individual . She suggested also that within a female were two parts : the intellectual side ( which she called the Minerva ) and the " lyrical " or " <unk> " side ( the Muse ) . She admired the work of Emanuel Swedenborg , who believed men and women shared " an angelic ministry " , as she wrote , as well as Charles Fourier , who placed " Woman on an entire equality with Man " . Unlike several contemporary women writers , including " Mrs. Sigourney " and " Mrs. Stowe " , she was familiarly referred to in a less formal manner as " Margaret " . 
 Fuller also advocated reform at all levels of society , including prison . In October 1844 , she visited Sing Sing and interviewed the women prisoners , even staying overnight in the facility . Sing Sing was developing a more humane system for its women inmates , many of whom were prostitutes . Fuller was also concerned about the homeless and those living in dire poverty , especially in New York . She also admitted that , though she was raised to believe " that the Indian obstinately refused to be civilized " , her travels in the American West made her realize that the white man unfairly treated the Native Americans ; she considered Native Americans an important part of American heritage . She also supported the rights of African @-@ Americans , referring to " this cancer of slavery " , and suggested that those who were interested in the abolition movement follow the same reasoning when considering the rights of women : " As the friend of the Negro assumes that one man cannot by right hold another in bondage , so should the Friend of Woman assume that Man cannot by right lay even well @-@ meant restrictions on Woman . " She suggested that those who spoke against the emancipation of slaves were similar to those who did not support the emancipation of Italy . 
 Fuller agreed with the transcendental concern for the psychological well @-@ being of the individual , though she was never comfortable being labeled a transcendentalist . Even so , she wrote , if being labeled a transcendentalist means " that I have an active mind frequently busy with large topics I hope it is so " . She criticized people like Emerson , however , for focusing too much on individual improvement and not enough on social reform . Like other members of the so @-@ called Transcendental Club , she rebelled against the past and believed in the possibility of change . However , unlike others in the movement , her rebellion was not based on religion . Though Fuller occasionally attended Unitarian congregations , she did not entirely identify with that religion . As biographer Charles Capper has noted , she " was happy to remain on the Unitarian margins . " 
 = = Legacy and criticism = = 
 Margaret Fuller was especially known in her time for her personality and , in particular , for being overly self @-@ confident and having a bad temper . This personality was the inspiration for the character Hester Prynne in Nathaniel Hawthorne 's novel The Scarlet Letter , specifically her radical thinking about " the whole race of womanhood " . She may also be the basis for the character Zenobia in another of Hawthorne 's works , The Blithedale Romance . Hawthorne and his then @-@ fiancée Sophia had first met Fuller in October 1839 . 
 She was also an inspiration to poet Walt Whitman , who believed in her call for the forging of a new national identity and a truly American literature . Elizabeth Barrett Browning was also a strong admirer , but believed that Fuller 's unconventional views were unappreciated in the United States and , therefore , she was better off dead . She also said that Fuller 's history of the Roman Republic would have been her greatest work : " The work she was preparing upon Italy would probably have been more equal to her faculty than anything previously produced by her pen ( her other writings being curiously inferior to the impressions her conversation gave you ) " . An 1860 essay collection , Historical Pictures <unk> , by Caroline Healey Dall , called Fuller 's Woman in the Nineteenth Century " doubtless the most brilliant , complete , and scholarly statement ever made on the subject " . Despite his personal issues with Fuller , the typically harsh literary critic Edgar Allan Poe wrote of the work as " a book which few women in the country could have written , and no woman in the country would have published , with the exception of Miss Fuller " , noting its " independence " and " unmitigated radicalism " . Thoreau also thought highly of the book , suggesting that its strength came in part from Fuller 's conversational ability . As he called it , it was " rich extempore writing , talking with pen in hand " . 
 Another admirer of Fuller was Susan B. Anthony , a pioneer of women 's rights , who wrote that Fuller " possessed more influence on the thought of American women than any woman previous to her time " . Fuller 's work may have partially inspired the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848 . Anthony , along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Matilda Joslyn Gage wrote in their History of Woman Suffrage that Fuller " was the precursor of the Women 's Rights agitation " . Modern scholars have suggested Woman in the Nineteenth Century was the first major women 's rights work since Mary Wollstonecraft 's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman ( 1792 ) , though an early comparison between the two women came from George Eliot in 1855 . It is unclear if Fuller was familiar with Wollstonecraft 's works ; in her childhood , her father prevented her from reading them . In 1995 , Fuller was inducted into the National Women 's Hall of Fame . 
 Fuller , however , was not without her critics . A one @-@ time friend , the English writer Harriet Martineau , was one of her harshest detractors after Fuller 's death . Martineau said that Fuller was a talker rather than an activist , that she had " shallow conceits " and often " looked down upon persons who acted instead of talking finely ... and despised those who , like myself , could not adopt her scale of valuation " . The influential editor Rufus Wilmot Griswold , who believed she went against his notion of feminine modesty , referred to Woman in the Nineteenth Century as " an eloquent expression of her discontent at having been created female " . New York writer Charles Frederick Briggs said that she was " wasting the time of her readers " , especially because she was an unmarried woman and therefore could not " truly represent the female character " . English writer and critic Matthew Arnold scoffed at Fuller 's conversations as well , saying , " My G – d , [ sic ] what rot did she and the other female dogs of Boston talk about Greek mythology ! " Sophia Hawthorne , who had previously been a supporter of Fuller , was critical of her after Woman of the Nineteenth Century was published : 
 The impression it left was disagreeable . I did not like the tone of it — & did not agree with her at all about the change in woman 's outward circumstances ... Neither do I believe in such a character of man as she gives . It is altogether too ignoble ... I think Margaret speaks of many things that should not be spoken of . 
 Fuller had angered fellow poet and critic James Russell Lowell when she reviewed his work , calling him " absolutely wanting in the true spirit and tone of poesy ... his verse is stereotyped , his thought sounds no depth ; and posterity will not remember him . " In response , Lowell took revenge in his satirical A Fable for Critics , first published in October 1848 . At first , he considered excluding her entirely but ultimately gave her what was called the " most wholly negative characterization " in the work . Referring to her as Miranda , Lowell wrote that she stole old ideas and presented them as her own , she was genuine only in her spite and " when acting as censor , she privately blows a censer of vanity ' neath her own nose " . 
 Shortly after Fuller 's death , her importance faded . Her obituary in the newspaper she had once edited , the Daily Tribune , said that her works had a few great sentiments , " but as a whole they must commend themselves mainly by their vigor of thought and habitual fearlessness rather than freedom of utterance " . As biographer Abby Slater wrote , " Margaret had been demoted from a position of importance in her own right to one in which her only importance was in the company she kept " . Years later , Hawthorne 's son Julian wrote , " The majority of readers will , I think , not be inconsolable that poor Margaret Fuller has at last taken her place with the numberless other dismal frauds who fill the limbo of human pretension and failure . " In the 20th century , American writer Elizabeth Hardwick , former wife of Robert Lowell , wrote an essay called " The Genius of Margaret Fuller " ( 1986 ) . She compared her own move from Boston to New York to Fuller 's , saying that Boston was not a good place for intellectuals , despite the assumption that it was the best place for intellectuals .

 = Last Post ( poem ) = 
 " Last Post " is a poem written by Carol Ann Duffy , the Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom , in 2009 . It was commissioned by the BBC to mark the deaths of Henry Allingham and Harry Patch , two of the last three surviving British veterans from the First World War , and was first broadcast on the BBC Radio 4 programme Today on 30 July 2009 , the date of Allingham 's funeral . 
 The poem , named after the " Last Post " ( the bugle call used at British ceremonies remembering those killed in war ) , makes explicit references to Wilfred Owen 's poem from the First World War Dulce et Decorum Est . It imagines what would happen if time ran backwards and those killed in the war came back to life ; their lives would still be full of possibilities and filled with " love , work , children , talent , English beer , good food . " The poem was generally well received , with one commentator saying that it was " simply a damn good poem with rich imagery , cinematic movement and poignant ending . " Another said that it was " moving reversal of history " and a " fine poem " . Duffy herself was quoted as saying that she wanted to honour the tradition of poets who were soldiers . 
 = = Commission = = 
 Carol Ann Duffy was appointed as Poet Laureate in May 2009 , the first woman to be appointed to the post . She was asked by the BBC Radio 4 programme Today to write a poem to mark the deaths of Henry Allingham and Harry Patch . The poem was read by Duffy on Today on 30 July 2009 , the day of Allingham 's funeral . Allingham , who served with the Royal Naval Air Service before becoming a founder member of the Royal Air Force , died on 18 July 2009 at the age of 113 ; Patch , the last surviving man to have fought in the trenches in the war , died on 25 July 2009 at the age of 111 . Their deaths left Claude Choules , who served in the Royal Navy during the war and who lived in Australia until his death in 2011 , as the last surviving British veteran . 
 Duffy said that she felt that she should " honour that great tradition of poets who were also soldiers " , describing the poem as " an attempt at healing and being at one with the world " , and " a tribute and blessing , even an apology , on behalf of poetry and all poets . " She added that she " had been thinking about Afghanistan and trying to <unk> new war poetry among contemporary poets . " The poem was broadcast one week after Duffy published a selection of poems she had commissioned from poets such as Sean O 'Brien , Paul Muldoon and Daljit Nagra about the ongoing war in Afghanistan . 
 = = Poem = = 
 The poem takes its title from the bugle call used at British ceremonies remembering those killed in war , the " Last Post " . It begins with two lines from the poem Dulce et Decorum Est by the First World War poet Wilfred Owen : 
 The title of Owen 's poem is part of a line from the Roman poet Horace – Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori ( " It is sweet and fitting to die for one 's country " ) . The phrase was inscribed over the chapel door at Sandhurst , the British military academy , in 1913 . The phrase is again referenced when Duffy writes " Dulce — No — Decorum — No — Pro patria mori . " The writer Will Heaven said that , whilst the poem denies that death in war is " sweet and proper " ( dulce et decorum ) , it does not deny that the soldiers died for their country ( pro patria mori ) . 
 The heart of the poem depicts events " if poetry could tell it backwards " – soldiers who died in the war coming back to life , " lines and lines of British boys rewind / back to their trenches " . The poem imagines " all those thousands dead / are shaking dried mud from their hair / and queuing up for home " . Duffy pictures what would have happened to them if they had not died : 
 before adding , " You see the poet tuck away his pocket @-@ book and smile " . Erica Wagner , the literary editor of The Times , said that the poet Duffy refers to in the poem could be Owen , but could also be John McCrae , Isaac Rosenberg , or Charles Hamilton Sorley , or one of a number of other poets from the war . Wagner also noted that " Harry Patch and Henry Allingham escaped death , but never the effect of that awful war . " 
 = = Reaction = = 
 The poem received a generally favourable critical reaction . Wagner called it a " moving reversal of history " , a " fine poem " , and " the latest in a noble line of work [ about the First World War ] that aspires to a kind of salvation . " Heaven said that it was a " poignant and beautiful tribute " to Allingham . It has been called " sombre yet supremely uplifting " . The poem was also noticed in the United States . Jenna <unk> , a writer for The New Yorker , described it as " another strong at @-@ bat " , and said that the poem highlighted " the power , but also the shortcomings , of poetry " when writing about an " imaginary , impossible event " and also writing about writing about it . The American poet John Lundberg said that the poem was a " surprising success " , adding that not only was it " accessible " and " a fitting tribute to those who served in World War I , " but also " simply a damn good poem with rich imagery , cinematic movement and poignant ending . " However , Christopher Howse , a writer for the Daily Telegraph , took a different view of the poem 's merits , saying ( under the title " Carol Ann Duffy falls short of Henry Allingham " ) that Duffy 's verse form was " open , to the point of invisibility " . 
 = Mauritania at the 2004 Summer Olympics = 
 Mauritania competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens , Greece , from 13 to 29 August 2004 . The country 's participation at Athens marked its sixth appearance in the Summer Olympics since its debut in the 1984 Summer Olympics . The delegation included two track and field athletes , Youba Hmeida and Aminata Kamissoko , who were both selected by wildcards after both failed to meet either the " A " or " B " qualifying standards . Hmeida was selected as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony . Neither of the Mauritanians progressed beyond the heats .

 Mauritania participated in six Summer Olympic games between its debut in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles , United States and the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens . The Mauritania National Olympic Committee ( NOC ) selected two athletes via wildcards . Usually , an NOC would be able to enter up to 3 qualified athletes in each individual event as long as each athlete met the " A " standard , or 1 athlete per event if they met the " B " standard . However , since Mauritania had no athletes that met either standard , they were allowed to select two athletes , one of each gender , as wildcards . The two athletes that were selected to compete in the Athens games were Youba Hmeida in the Men 's 400 meters and Aminata Kamissoko in the Women 's 100 meters . Hmeida was flag bearer for the opening ceremony .

 = Battle of Yarmouk = 
 The Battle of Yarmouk was a major battle between the army of the Byzantine Empire and the Muslim Arab forces of the Rashidun Caliphate . The battle consisted of a series of engagements that lasted for six days in August 636 , near the Yarmouk River , along what today are the borders of Syria – Jordan and Syria – Israel , east of the Sea of Galilee . The result of the battle was a complete Muslim victory which ended Byzantine rule in Syria . The Battle of Yarmouk is regarded as one of the most decisive battles in military history , and it marked the first great wave of Islamic conquests after the death of Muhammad , heralding the rapid advance of Islam into the then Christian Levant . 
 In order to check the Arab advance and to recover lost territory , Emperor Heraclius had sent a massive expedition to the Levant in May 636 . As the Byzantine army approached , the Arabs tactically withdrew from Syria and regrouped all their forces at the Yarmouk plains close to Arabia where , after being reinforced , they defeated the numerically superior Byzantine army . The battle is considered to be one of Khalid ibn al @-@ Walid 's greatest military victories . It cemented his reputation as one of the greatest tacticians and cavalry commanders in history . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 During the last Byzantine – Sassanid Wars in 610 , Heraclius became the emperor of the Byzantine Empire , after overthrowing Phocas . Meanwhile , the Sassanid Persians conquered Mesopotamia and in 611 they overran Syria and entered Anatolia , occupying Caesarea Mazaca . Heraclius , in 612 , managed to expel the Persians from Anatolia , but was decisively defeated in 613 when he launched a major offensive in Syria against the Persians . Over the following decade the Persians were able to conquer Palestine and Egypt . Meanwhile , Heraclius prepared for a counterattack and rebuilt his army . Nine years later in 622 , Heraclius finally launched his offensive . After his overwhelming victories over the Persians and their allies in the Caucasus and Armenia , Heraclius , in 627 , launched a winter offensive against the Persians in Mesopotamia winning a decisive victory at the Battle of Nineveh thus threatening the Persian capital city of Ctesiphon . Discredited by these series of disasters , Khosrau II was overthrown and killed in a coup led by his son Kavadh II , who at once sued for peace , agreeing to withdraw from all occupied territories of the Byzantine Empire . Heraclius restored the True Cross to Jerusalem with a majestic ceremony in 629 . 
 Meanwhile , there had been rapid political development in Arabia , where Muhammad had been preaching Islam and by 630 , he had successfully united most of the Arabia under a single political authority . When Muhammad died in June 632 , Abu Bakr was elected Caliph and his political successor . Troubles emerged soon after Abu Bakr 's succession , when several Arab tribes openly revolted against Abu Bakr , who declared war against the rebels . In what became known as the Ridda wars ( Arabic for the Wars of Apostasy , 632 – 33 ) , Abu Bakr managed to unite Arabia under the central authority of the Caliph at Medina . 
 Once the rebels had been subdued , Abu Bakr began a war of conquest , beginning with Iraq . Sending his most brilliant general , Khalid ibn al @-@ Walid , Iraq was conquered in a series of successful campaigns against the Sassanid Persians . Abu Bakr 's confidence grew , and once Khalid established his stronghold in Iraq , Abu Bakr issued a call to arms for the invasion of Syria in February 634 . The Muslim invasion of Syria was a series of carefully planned and well coordinated military operations that employed strategy instead of pure strength to deal with Byzantine defensive measures . The Muslim armies , however soon proved to be too small to handle the Byzantine response , and their commanders called for reinforcements . Khalid was sent by Abu Bakr from Iraq to Syria with reinforcements and to lead the invasion . In July 634 , the Byzantines were decisively defeated at Ajnadayn . Damascus fell in September 634 , followed by the Battle of Fahl where the last significant garrison of Palestine was defeated and routed . 
 Caliph Abu Bakr died in 634 . His successor , Umar , was determined to continue the Caliphate Empire 's expansion deeper into Syria . Though previous campaigns led by Khalid were successful , he was replaced by Abu Ubaidah . Having secured southern Palestine , Muslim forces now advanced up the trade route , where Tiberias and Baalbek fell without much struggle , and conquered Emesa early in 636 . From thereon , the Muslims continued their conquest across the Levant . 
 = = Byzantine counterattack = = 
 Having seized Emesa , the Muslims were just a march away from Aleppo , a Byzantine stronghold , and Antioch , where Heraclius resided . Seriously alarmed by the series of setbacks , Heraclius prepared for a counterattack to reacquire the lost regions . In 635 Yazdegerd III , the Emperor of Persia , sought an alliance with the Byzantine Emperor . Heraclius married off his daughter ( according to traditions , his grand daughter ) <unk> to Yazdegerd III , to cement the alliance . While Heraclius prepared for a major offensive in the Levant , Yazdegerd was to mount a simultaneous counterattack in Iraq , in what was meant to be a well @-@ coordinated effort . When Heraclius launched his offensive in May 636 , Yazdegerd could not coordinate with the maneuver — probably owing to the exhausted condition of his government — and what would have been a decisive plan missed the mark . 
 Byzantine preparations began in late 635 and by May 636 Heraclius had a large force concentrated at Antioch in Northern Syria . The assembled army consisted of contingents of Byzantines , Slavs , Franks , Georgians , Armenians and Christian Arabs . This force was organized into five armies , the joint leader of which was Theodore <unk> the <unk> . Vahan , an Armenian and the former garrison commander of Emesa , was made the overall field commander , and had under his command a purely Armenian army . <unk> ( Qanateer ) , a Slavic prince , commanded the Slavs and Jabalah ibn al @-@ <unk> , king of the Ghassanid Arabs , commanded an exclusively Christian Arab force . The remaining contingents , all European , were placed under Gregory and Dairjan . Heraclius himself supervised the operation from Antioch . Byzantine sources mention Niketas , son of the Persian general Shahrbaraz , among the commanders , but it is not certain which army he commanded . 
 At that time , the Rashidun army was split into four groups : one under Amr in Palestine , one under Shurahbil in Jordan , one under Yazid in the Damascus @-@ Caesarea region and the last one under Abu Ubaidah along with Khalid at Emesa . As the Muslim forces were geographically divided , Heraclius sought to exploit this situation and planned to attack . He did not wish to engage in a single pitched battle but rather to employ central position and fight the enemy in detail by concentrating large forces against each of the Muslim corps before they could consolidate their troops . By forcing the Muslims to retreat , or by destroying Muslim forces separately , he would fulfill his strategy of recapturing lost territory . Reinforcements were sent to Caesarea under Heraclius ' son Constantine III probably to tie down Yazid 's forces which were besieging the town . The Byzantine imperial army moved out from Antioch and Northern Syria sometime in the middle of June 636 . 
 The Byzantine imperial army was to operate under the following plan : 
 Jabalah 's lightly armed Christian Arabs would march to Emesa from Aleppo via Hama and hold the main Muslim army at Emesa . 
 Dairjan would make a flanking movement – moving between the coast and Aleppo 's road – and approach Emesa from the west , striking at the Muslims ' left flank while they were being held frontally by Jabalah . 
 Gregory would strike the Muslims ' right flank , approaching Emesa from the northeast via Mesopotamia . 
 Qanateer would march along the coastal route and occupy Beirut , from where he was to attack weakly defended Damascus from the west to cut off the main Muslim army at Emesa . 
 Vahan 's corps would act as a reserve and would approach Emesa via Hama . 
 = = Muslim strategy = = 
 The Muslims discovered Heraclius ' preparations at Shaizar through Roman prisoners . Alert to the possibility of being caught with separated forces that could be destroyed , Khalid called for a council of war . There he advised Abu Ubaidah to pull the troops back from Palestine and from Northern and Central Syria , and then to concentrate the entire Rashidun army in one place . Abu Ubaidah ordered the concentration of troops in the vast plain near Jabiya , as control of the area made cavalry charges possible and facilitated the arrival of reinforcements from Umar so that a strong , united force could be fielded against the Byzantine armies . The position also benefited from close proximity to the Rashidun stronghold of Najd , in case of retreat . Instructions were also issued to return the jizya ( tribute ) to the people who had paid it . However , once concentrated at Jabiya , the Muslims were subject to raids from pro @-@ Byzantine Ghassanid forces . <unk> in the region was also precarious as a strong Byzantine force was garrisoned in <unk> and could attack the Muslim rear while they were held in front by the Byzantine army . On Khalid 's advice the Muslim forces retreated to Dara ’ ah ( or Dara ) and Dayr Ayyub , covering the gap between the Yarmouk Gorges and the <unk> lava plains , and established a line of camps in the eastern part of the plain of Yarmouk . This was a strong defensive position and these maneuvers pitted the Muslims and Byzantines into a decisive battle , one which the latter had tried to avoid . During these maneuvers , there were no engagements save for a minor skirmish between Khalid 's elite light cavalry and the Byzantine advance guard .

 The battlefield lies in the western plane of Syrian Hauran , just south @-@ east of the Golan Heights , an upland region currently on the frontier between Israel , Jordan and Syria , east of the Sea of Galilee . The battle was fought on the plain north of Yarmouk River , which was enclosed on its western edges by a deep ravine known as Wadi @-@ ur @-@ Ruqqad . This ravine joins the Yarmouk River , a tributary of the Jordan River , on its south . The stream had very steep banks , ranging from 30 m ( 98 ft ) – 200 m ( 660 ft ) in height . On the north is the Jabiya road and to the east are the Azra hills , although these hills were outside the actual field of battle . Strategically there was only one prominence in the battlefield : a 100 m ( 330 ft ) elevation known as Tel al <unk> 'a , and for the Muslim troops concentrated there , the hill gave a good view of the plain of Yarmouk . The ravine on the west of the battlefield was accessible at a few places in 636 AD , and had one main crossing : a Roman bridge ( Jisr @-@ ur @-@ Ruqqad ) near ' Ain Dhakar Logistically , the Yarmouk plain had enough water supplies and pastures to sustain both armies . The plain was excellent for cavalry maneuvers .

 During a council of war , the command of the Muslim army was transferred to Khalid by Abu Ubaidah , Commander in Chief of the Muslim army . After taking command , Khalid reorganized the army into 36 infantry regiments and four cavalry regiments , with his cavalry elite , the mobile guard , held in reserve . The army was organized in the Tabi 'a formation , a tight , defensive infantry formation . The army was lined up on a front of 12 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) , facing west , with its left flank lying south on the Yarmouk River a mile before the ravines of Wadi al Allan began . The army 's right flank was on the Jabiya road in the north across the heights of Tel al <unk> 'a , with substantial gaps between the divisions so that their frontage would match that of the Byzantine battle line at 13 kilometres ( 8 @.@ 1 mi ) . The center of the army was under the command of Abu Ubaidah ibn al @-@ Jarrah ( left center ) and Shurahbil bin Hasana ( right center ) . The left wing was under the command of Yazid and the right wing was under Amr ibn al @-@ A 'as . Center , left and right wings were given cavalry regiments , to be used as a reserve for counter @-@ attack in case they were pushed back by the Byzantines . Behind the center stood the mobile guard under the personal command of Khalid . If and when Khalid was too occupied in leading the general army , Dharar ibn al @-@ Azwar would command the mobile guard . Over the course of the battle , Khalid would repeatedly make critical and decisive use of this mounted reserve . Khalid sent out several scouts to keep the Byzantines under observation . In late July 636 , Vahan sent Jabalah with his lightly armored Christian Arab forces to reconnoiter @-@ in @-@ force , but they were repulsed by the mobile guard . After this skirmish , no engagement occurred for a month .

 Helmets used included gilded helmets similar to the silver helmets of the Sassanid empire . Mail was commonly used to protect the face , neck and cheeks either as an <unk> from the helmet or as a mail coif . Heavy leather sandals as well as Roman @-@ type sandal boots were also typical of the early Muslim soldiers . Armor included hardened leather scale or lamellar armor and mail armor . Infantry soldiers were more heavily armored than horsemen . Large wooden or <unk> shields were used . Long @-@ shafted spears were used , with infantry spears being 2 @.@ 5 m ( 8 @.@ 2 ft ) long and cavalry spears being up to 5 @.@ 5 m ( 18 ft ) long . Short infantry swords like the Roman gladius and Sassanid long swords were used ; long swords were usually carried by horsemen . Swords were hung in baldrics . Bows were about 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) long when <unk> , similar in size to the famous English longbow . The maximum useful range of the traditional Arabian bow was about 150 m ( 490 ft ) . Early Muslim archers , while being infantry archers without the mobility of horseback archer regiments , proved to be very effective in defending against light and unarmored cavalry attacks .

 A few days after the Muslims encamped at the Yarmouk plain , the Byzantine army , preceded by the lightly armed Ghassanids of Jabalah , moved forward and established strongly fortified camps just north of the Wadi @-@ ur @-@ Ruqqad . The right flank of the Byzantine army was at the south end of the plains , near the Yarmouk River and about a mile before the ravines of Wadi al Allan began . The left flank of the Byzantines was at the north , a short distance before the Hills of Jabiya began , and was relatively exposed . Vahan deployed the Imperial Army facing east , with a front about 13 kilometres ( 8 @.@ 1 mi ) long , as he was trying to cover the whole area between the Yarmouk gorge in the south and the Roman road to Egypt in the north , and substantial gaps had been left between the Byzantine divisions . The right wing was commanded by Gregory and the left by Qanateer . The center was formed by the army of Dairjan and the Armenian army of Vahan , both under the overall command of Dairjan . The Roman regular heavy cavalry , the cataphract , was distributed equally among the four armies , each army deploying its infantry at the forefront and its cavalry as a reserve in the rear . Vahan deployed Jabalah 's Christian Arabs , mounted on horses and camels , as a skirmishing force , screening the main army until its arrival . Early Muslim sources mention that the army of Gregory had used chains to link together its foot @-@ soldiers , who had all taken an oath of death . The chains were in 10 @-@ man lengths and were used as a proof of unshakeable courage on the part of the men , who thus displayed their willingness to die where they stood and never retreat . The chains also acted as an insurance against a breakthrough by enemy cavalry . However , modern historians suggest that the Byzantines adopted the Graeco @-@ Roman <unk> military formation , in which soldiers would stand shoulder @-@ to @-@ shoulder with shields held high and an arrangement of 10 to 20 men would be completely shielded on all sides from missile fire , each soldier providing cover for an adjoining companion .

 The Byzantine cavalry was armed with a long sword , known as the <unk> . They would also have had a light wooden lance , known as a <unk> and a bow ( <unk> ) with forty arrows in a quiver , hung from a saddle or from the belt . Heavy infantry , known as <unk> , had a short sword and a short spear . The lightly armed Byzantine troops and the archers carried a small shield , a bow hung from the shoulder across the back and a quiver of arrows . Cavalry armor consisted of a hauberk with a mail coif and a helmet with a pendant , i.e. a throat @-@ guard lined with fabric and having a fringe and cheek piece . Infantry was similarly equipped with a hauberk , a helmet and leg armor . Light lamellar and scale armor was also used . 
 = = Tensions in the Byzantine army = = 
 Khalid 's strategy of withdrawing from the occupied areas and concentrating all of his troops for a decisive battle forced the Byzantines to concentrate their five armies in response . The Byzantines had for centuries avoided engaging in large @-@ scale decisive battles , and the concentration of their forces created logistical strains for which the empire was ill @-@ prepared . Damascus was the closest logistical base , but Mansur , leader of Damascus , could not fully supply the massive Byzantine army that was gathered at the Yarmouk plain . Several clashes were reported with local citizens over supply requisition , as summer was at an end and there was a decline of pasturage . Greek court sources accused Vahan of treason for his disobedience to Heraclius ' command not to engage in large @-@ scale battle with Arabs . Given the massing of the Muslim armies at Yarmouk , however , Vahan had little choice but to respond in kind . Relations between the various Byzantine commanders were also fraught with tension . There was a struggle for power between <unk> and Vahan , <unk> , and Qanateer ( <unk> ) . Jabalah , the Christian Arab leader , was largely ignored , to the detriment of the Byzantines given his knowledge of the local terrain . An atmosphere of mistrust thus existed between the Greeks , Armenians , and Arabs . Longstanding ecclesiastical feuds between the Monophysite and Chalcedonian factions , while of negligible direct impact , certainly inflamed underlying tensions . The effect of these feuds was decreased coordination and planning , one of the reasons for the catastrophic Byzantine defeat . 
 = = Battle = = 
 The battle lines of the Muslims and the Byzantines were divided into four sections : the left wing , the left center , the right center and the right wing . Note that the descriptions of the Muslim and the Byzantine battle lines are exactly each other 's opposite , i.e. : so the Muslim right wing faced the Byzantine left wing ( see image ) . 
 Vahan was instructed by Heraclius not to engage in battle until all avenues of diplomacy had been explored . This was probably because Yazdegerd III 's forces were not yet ready for the offensive in Iraq . Accordingly , Vahan sent Gregory and then Jabalah to negotiate , though their efforts proved futile . Before the battle , on Vahan 's invitation , Khalid came to negotiate peace , to a similar end . These negotiations delayed the battles for a month . On the other hand , Caliph Umar , whose forces at Qadisiyah were threatened with confronting the Sassanid armies , ordered <unk> ibn Abi Waqqas to enter into negotiations with the Persians and send emissaries to Yazdegerd III and his commander Rostam <unk> , apparently inviting them to Islam . This was most probably the delaying tactic employed by Umar on the Persian front . Meanwhile , he sent reinforcements of 6 @,@ 000 troops , mostly from Yemen , to Khalid . This force included 1 @,@ 000 Sahaba ( companions of Muhammad ) , among whom were 100 veterans of the Battle of Badr , the first battle in Islamic history , and included citizens of the highest rank , such as Zubayr ibn al @-@ <unk> , Abu Sufyan , and his wife Hind bint Utbah . 
 Also present were such distinct companions as Sa 'id ibn Zayd , Fadl ibn Abbas , Abdul @-@ Rahman ibn Abi Bakr ( the son of Abu Bakr ) , Abdullah ibn Umar ( the son of Umar ) , <unk> ibn Uthman ( the son of Uthman ) , Abdulreman ibn Khalid ( the son of Khalid ) , Abdullah ibn Ja 'far ( the nephew of Ali ) , Ammar ibn Yasir , Miqdad ibn Aswad , Abu <unk> al @-@ <unk> , Malik al @-@ Ashtar , Abu Ayyub al @-@ Ansari , Qays ibn Sa 'd , <unk> ibn al @-@ Yaman , <unk> ibn as @-@ Samit , Hisham ibn al @-@ A 'as , Abu <unk> and Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl . As this was a citizen army in contrast to a mercenary one , the age of the soldiers ranged from 20 ( in the case of Khalid 's son ) to 70 years old ( in the case of Ammar ) . Three of the ten companions promised paradise by Muhammad , namely Sa 'id , Zubayr and Abu Ubaidah , were present at Yarmouk . 
 Umar , apparently wanting to defeat the Byzantines first , employed the best Muslim troops against them . The continuing stream of Muslim reinforcements worried the Byzantines , who fearing that the Muslims with such reinforcements would grow powerful , decided that they had no choice but to attack . The reinforcements that were sent to the Muslims at Yarmouk arrived in small bands , giving the impression of a continuous stream of reinforcements , in order to demoralize the Byzantines and compel them to attack . The same tactic would be repeated again during the Battle of Qadisiyah .

It is recorded in Muslim chronicles that before the battle started , George , a unit commander in the Byzantine right center , rode up to the Muslim line and converted to Islam ; he would die the same day fighting on the Muslim side . The battle began as the Byzantine army sent its champions to duel with the Muslim <unk> . The <unk> were specially trained swordsmen and lancers , with the objective to slay as many enemy commanders as possible to damage their morale . At midday , after losing a number of commanders in the duels , Vahan ordered a limited attack with a third of his infantry forces to test the strength and strategy of the Muslim army and , using their overwhelming numerical and weaponry superiority , achieve a breakthrough wherever the Muslim battle line was weak . However the Byzantine assault lacked determination ; many soldiers of the Imperial Army were unable to press the attack against the Muslim veterans . The fighting was generally moderate , although in some places it was especially intense . Vahan did not reinforce his forward infantry two @-@ thirds of which was kept in reserve with one @-@ third deployed to engage the Muslims , and at sunset both armies broke contact and returned to their respective camps . 
 = = = Day 2 = = = 
 Phase 1 : On 16 August 636 , Vahan decided in a council of war to launch his attack just before dawn , to catch the Muslim force unprepared as they conducted their morning prayers . He planned to engage his two central armies with the Muslim centre in an effort to stall them while the main thrusts would be against the wings of the Muslim army , which would then either be driven away from the battlefield or pushed towards the centre . To observe the battlefield , Vahan had a large pavilion built behind his right wing with an Armenian bodyguard force . He ordered the army to prepare for the surprise attack . Unbeknownst to the Byzantines , Khalid had prepared for such a contingency by placing a strong outpost line in front during the night to counter surprises , which gave the Muslims time to prepare for battle . At the center , the Byzantines did not press hard , intending to pin down the Muslim centre corps in their position and preventing them from aiding the Muslim army in other areas . Thus the center remained stable . But on the wings the situation was different . Qanateer , commanding the Byzantine left flank which consisted of mainly Slavs , attacked in force , and the Muslim infantry on the right flank had to retreat . Amr , the Muslim right wing commander ordered his cavalry regiment to counterattack , which neutralized the Byzantine advance and stabilized the battle line on the right for some time , but the Byzantine numerical superiority caused them to retreat towards the Muslim base camp . 
 Phase 2 : Khalid , aware of the situation at the wings , ordered the cavalry of the right wing to attack the northern flank of the Byzantine left wing while he with his mobile guard attacked the southern flank of the Byzantine left wing , while the Muslim right wing infantry attacked from the front . The three @-@ pronged attack forced the Byzantine left wing to abandon the Muslim positions they had gained on , and Amr regained his lost ground and started reorganizing his corps for another round . The situation on the Muslim left wing which Yazid commanded was considerably more serious . Whilst the Muslim right wing enjoyed assistance from the mobile guard , the left wing did not and the numerical advantage the Byzantines enjoyed caused the Muslim positions to be overrun , with soldiers retreating towards base camps . Here the Byzantines had broken through the corps . The <unk> formation that Gregory 's army had adopted moved slowly but also had a good defense . Yazid used his cavalry regiment to counterattack but was repulsed . Despite stiff resistance , the warriors of Yazid on the left flank finally fell back to their camps and for a moment Vahan 's plan appeared to be succeeding . The centre of the Muslim army was pinned down and its flanks had been pushed back . However , neither flank had broken , though their morale was severely damaged . The retreating Muslim army was met by the ferocious Arab women in the camps . Led by Hind , the Muslim women dismantled their tents and armed with tent poles charged at their husbands and fellow men singing an improvised song from the Battle of Uhud that then had been directed against the Muslims . 
 This boiled the blood of the retreating Muslims so much that they returned to the battlefield . 
 Phase 3 : After managing to stabilize the position on the right flank , Khalid ordered the mobile guard cavalry to provide relief to the battered left flank . Khalid detached one regiment under Dharar ibn al @-@ Azwar and ordered him to attack the front of the army of Dairjan ( left center ) in order to create a diversion and threaten the withdrawal of the Byzantine right wing from its advanced position . With the rest of the cavalry reserve he attacked Gregory 's flank . Here again , under simultaneous attacks from the front and flanks , the Byzantines fell back , but more slowly because they had to maintain their formation . At sunset the central armies broke contact and withdrew to their original positions and both fronts were restored along the lines occupied in the morning . The death of Dairjan and the failure of Vahan 's battle plan left the larger Imperial army relatively demoralized , whereas Khalid 's successful counterattacks emboldened his troops despite their being smaller in number . 
 = = = Day 3 = = = 
 On 17 August 636 , Vahan pondered over his failures and mistakes of the previous day , where he launched attacks against respective Muslim flanks , but after initial success , his men were pushed back . What bothered him the most was the loss of one of his commanders . The imperial Byzantine army decided on a less ambitious plan , Vahan now aimed to break the Muslim army at specific points . He decided to press upon the relatively exposed right flank , where his mounted troops could maneuver more freely as compared to the rugged terrain at the Muslims ' left flank . And it was decided to charge at the junction between the Muslim right center and its right wing held by Qanateer 's Slavs , to break the two apart and to fight them separately . 
 Phase 1 : The battle resumed with Byzantine attacks on the Muslim right flank and right center . After holding off the initial attacks by the Byzantines , the Muslim right wing fell back , followed by the right center . They were again said to have been met by their own womenfolk who abused and shamed them . The corps , however , managed to reorganize some distance from the camp and held their ground preparing for a counterattack . 
 Phase 2 : Knowing that the Byzantine army was focusing on the Muslim right , Khalid ibn al @-@ Walid launched an attack with his mobile guard , along with the Muslim right flank cavalry . Khalid ibn al @-@ Walid struck at the right flank of the Byzantines left center , and the cavalry reserve of the Muslims right center struck at the Byzantines left center at its left flank . Meanwhile , he ordered the Muslims ' right wing cavalry to strike at the left flank of the Byzantines left wing . The combat soon developed into a bloodbath . Many fell on both sides . Khalid 's timely flanking attacks again saved the day for Muslims and by dusk the Byzantines had been pushed back to the positions they had at the start of the battle . 
 = = = Day 4 = = = 
 18 August 636 , the fourth day , was to prove decisive . 
 Phase 1 : Vahan decided to persist with the previous day 's war plan as he had been successful in inflicting damage on the Muslim right . Qanateer led two armies of Slavs against the Muslim right wing and right centre with some assistance from the Armenians and Christian Arabs led by Jabalah . The Muslim right wing and right center again fell back . Khalid entered the fray yet again with this mobile guard . He feared a general attack on a broad front which he wouldn 't be able to repulse and as a precaution ordered Abu Ubaidah and Yazid on the left centre and the left wings respectively to attack the Byzantine armies at the respective fronts . The attack would result in stalling the Byzantine front and prevent a general advance of the Imperial army . 
 Phase 2 : Khalid divided his mobile guard into two divisions and attacked the flanks of the Byzantine left center , while the infantry of the Muslim right center attacked from front . Under this three @-@ pronged flanking manoeuvre , the Byzantines fell back . Meanwhile , the Muslim right wing renewed its offense with its infantry attacking from the front and the cavalry reserve attacking the northern flank of the Byzantine left wing . As the Byzantine left center retreated under three @-@ pronged attacks of Khalid , the Byzantine left wing , having been exposed at its southern flank , also fell back . 
 While Khalid and his mobile guard were dealing with the Armenian front throughout the afternoon , the situation on the other end was worsening . Byzantine horse @-@ archers had taken to the field and subjected Abu Ubaidah and Yazid 's troops to intense archery preventing them from penetrating their Byzantine lines . Many Muslim soldiers lost their sight to Byzantine arrows on that day , which thereafter became known as the " Day of Lost Eyes " . The veteran Abu Sufyan is also believed to have lost an eye that day . The Muslim armies fell back except for one regiment led by Ikrimah bin Abi <unk> , which was on the left of Abu Ubaidah 's corps . Ikrimah covered the retreat of the Muslims with his four hundred cavalry by attacking the Byzantine front , while the other armies reorganized themselves to counterattack and regain their lost positions . All of Ikrimah 's men were either seriously injured or dead that day . Ikrimah , a childhood friend of Khalid 's was mortally wounded and died later in the evening . 
 = = = Day 5 = = = 
 During the four @-@ day offense of Vahan , his troops had failed to achieve any breakthrough and had suffered heavy casualties , especially during the mobile guard 's flanking counterattacks . Early on 19 August 636 , the fifth day of the battle , Vahan sent an emissary to the Muslim camp for a truce for the next few days so that fresh negotiations could be held . He supposedly wanted time to reorganize his demoralized troops . But Khalid deemed victory to be in reach and he declined the offer . Up till now , the Muslim army had adopted a largely defensive strategy , but knowing that the Byzantines were apparently no longer eager for battle , Khalid now decided to take the offensive and reorganized his troops accordingly . All the cavalry regiments were grouped together into one powerful mounted force with the mobile guard acting as its core . The total strength of this cavalry group was now about 8 @,@ 000 mounted warriors , an effective mounted corps for an offensive attack the next day . The rest of the day passed uneventfully . Khalid planned to trap Byzantine troops , cutting off their every route of escape . There were three natural barriers , the three gorges in the battlefield with their steep ravines , Wadi @-@ ur @-@ Ruqqad at west , Wadi al Yarmouk in south and Wadi al Allah in east . The northern route was to be blocked by Muslim cavalry . There were however , some passages across the 200 metres ( 660 ft ) deep ravines of Wadi @-@ ur @-@ <unk> in west , strategically the most important one was at Ayn al Dhakar , a bridge . Khalid sent Dharar with 500 cavalry at night to secure that bridge . Dharar moved around the northern flank of Byzantines and captured the bridge . This maneuver was to prove decisive the next day . 
 = = = Day 6 = = = 
 On 20 August 636 , the final day of the battle , Khalid put into action a simple but bold plan of attack . With his massed cavalry force he intended to drive the Byzantine cavalry entirely off the battlefield so that the infantry , which formed the bulk of the imperial army , would be left without cavalry support and thus would be exposed when attacked from the flanks and rear . At the same time he planned to push a determined attack to turn the left flank of the Byzantine army and drive them towards the ravine to the west . 
 Phase 1 : Khalid ordered a general attack on the Byzantine front and galloped his cavalry around the left wing of the Byzantines . Part of his cavalry engaged the Byzantine left wing cavalry while the rest of it attacked the rear of the Byzantine left wing infantry . Meanwhile , the Muslim right wing pressed against it from the front . Under this two @-@ pronged attack , the Byzantine left wing fell back and collapsed and fell back to the Byzantine left center , greatly <unk> it . The remaining Muslim cavalry then attacked the Byzantine left wing cavalry at the rear while they were held frontally by the other half of the Muslim cavalry , routing them off the battlefield to the north . The Muslim right wing infantry now attacked the Byzantine left center at its left flank while the Muslim right center attacked from front . 
 Phase 2 : Vahan , noticing the huge cavalry maneuver of the Muslims , ordered his cavalry to group together , but was not quick enough ; before Vahan could organize his disparate heavy cavalry squadrons , Khalid had wheeled his cavalry back to attack the concentrating Byzantine cavalry squadrons , falling upon them from the front and the flank while they were still moving into formation . The disorganized and disoriented Byzantine heavy cavalry was soon routed and dispersed to the north , leaving the infantry to its fate . 
 Phase 3 : With the Byzantine cavalry completely routed , Khalid turned to the Byzantine left center which already held the two @-@ pronged attack of the Muslim infantry . The Byzantine left center was attacked at its rear by Khalid 's cavalry and was finally broken . 
 The last phase : With the retreat of the Byzantine left center , a general Byzantine retreat started . Khalid took his cavalry north to block the northern route of escape . The Byzantines retreated west towards Wadi @-@ ur @-@ Ruqqad where there was a bridge at Ayn al Dhakar for safe crossing across the deep gorges of the ravines of Wadi @-@ ur @-@ Ruqqad . Dharar had already captured the bridge as part of Khalid 's plan the night before . A unit of 500 mounted troops had been sent to block this passageway . In fact , this was the route by which Khalid wanted the Byzantines to retreat all along . The Byzantines were surrounded from all sides now . Some fell into the deep ravines off the steep slopes , others tried to escape in the waters , only to be smashed on the rocks below and again others were killed in their flight . Nevertheless , a large number of the soldiers managed to escape the slaughter . Jonah , the Greek informant of the Rashidun army during the conquest of Damascus , died in this battle . The Muslims took no prisoners in this battle , although they may have captured some during the subsequent pursuit . Theodore <unk> died on the battlefield , while Niketas managed to escape and reach Emesa . Jabalah ibn al @-@ <unk> also managed to escape and later , for a short time , came to terms with the Muslims , but soon defected to the Byzantine court again . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Immediately after this operation was over , Khalid and his mobile guard moved north to pursue the retreating Byzantine soldiers ; he found them near Damascus and attacked . In the ensuing fight Vahan , who had escaped the fate of most of his men at Yarmouk , was killed . Khalid then entered Damascus where he was said to have been welcomed by the local residents , thus recapturing the city . 
 When news of the disaster reached the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius at Antioch , he was devastated and enraged . He blamed his wrongdoings for the loss , primarily referring to his incestuous marriage to his niece Martina . He would have tried to reconquer the province if he had had the resources , but now he had neither the men nor the money to defend the province any more . Instead he retreated to the cathedral of Antioch , where he observed a solemn service of intercession . He summoned a meeting of his advisers at the cathedral and scrutinized the situation . He was told almost unanimously , and accepted the fact , that the defeat was God 's decision and a result of the sins of the people of the land , including him . Heraclius took to the sea on a ship to Constantinople in the night . It is said that as his ship set sail , he bade a last farewell to Syria , saying : 
 Farewell , a long farewell to Syria , my fair province . Thou art an infidel 's ( enemy 's ) now . Peace be with you , O Syria – what a beautiful land you will be for the enemy . 
 Heraclius abandoned Syria with the holy relic of the True Cross which was , along with other relics held at Jerusalem , secretly boarded on ship by Parthia of Jerusalem , just to protect it from the invading Arabs . It is said that the emperor had a fear of <unk> and a pontoon bridge was made for Heraclius to cross the Bosphorus to Constantinople . After abandoning Syria , the Emperor began to concentrate on his remaining forces for the defence of Anatolia and Egypt instead . Byzantine Armenia fell to the Muslims in 638 – 39 , after which Heraclius created a buffer zone in central Anatolia by ordering all the forts east of Tarsus to be evacuated . In 639 – 642 Muslims invaded and captured Byzantine Egypt , led by Amr ibn al @-@ A 'as – who had commanded the right flank of the Rashidun army at Yarmouk . 
 = = Evaluation = = 
 The Battle of Yarmouk can be seen as an example in military history where an inferior force manages to overcome a superior force by superior generalship . 
 The Imperial Byzantine commanders allowed their enemy to have the battlefield of his choosing . Even then they were at no substantial tactical disadvantage . Khalid knew all along that he was up against a force superior in numbers and , until the last day of the battle , he conducted an essentially defensive campaign suited to his relatively limited resources . When he decided to take the offensive and attack on the final day of battle , he did so with a degree of imagination , foresight and courage that none of the Byzantine commanders managed to display . Although he commanded a numerically inferior force and needed all the men he could muster , he nevertheless had the confidence and foresight to dispatch a cavalry regiment the night before his assault to seal off a critical path of the retreat he anticipated for the enemy army . 
 Because of his leadership at Yarmouk , Khalid ibn al @-@ Walid is considered one of the finest generals in history and his use of mounted warriors throughout the battle showed just how well he understood the potential strengths and weaknesses of his mounted troops . His mobile guard moved quickly from one point to another , always changing the course of events wherever they appeared , and then just as quickly galloping away to change the course of events elsewhere on the field . 
 Vahan and his Byzantine commanders did not manage to deal with this mounted force and use the sizable advantage of their army effectively . Their own Byzantine cavalry never played a significant role in the battle and were held in static reserve for most of the six days . They never pushed their attacks and even when they obtained what could have been a decisive breakthrough on the fourth day , they were unable to exploit it . There appeared to be a decided lack of resolve among the Imperial commanders , though this may have been caused by difficulties commanding the army because of internal conflict . Moreover , many of the Arab auxiliaries were mere levies , while the Muslim Arab army consisted for a much larger part of veteran troops . 
 The original strategy of Heraclius , to destroy the Muslim troops in Syria , needed a rapid and quick deployment , but the commanders on the ground never displayed these qualities . Ironically , on the field at Yarmouk , Khalid carried out on a small tactical scale what Heraclius had planned on a grand strategic scale : by rapidly deploying and manoeuvering his forces , Khalid was able to temporarily concentrate sufficient forces at specific locations on the field to defeat the larger Byzantine army in detail . Vahan was never able to make his numerical superiority count , perhaps because of the unfavorable terrain that prevented large @-@ scale deployment . However , at no point did Vahan attempt to concentrate a superior force to achieve a critical breakthrough . Although he was on the offensive 5 days out of the six , his battle line remained remarkably static . This all stands in stark contrast to the very successful offensive plan that Khalid carried out on the final day , when he reorganised virtually all his cavalry and committed them to a grand manoeuvre that won the battle . George F. Nafziger , in his book Islam at war , describes the battle as :

 The Westroads Mall shooting was a mass shooting that occurred on December 5 , 2007 , at the Von Maur department store in the Westroads Mall in Omaha , Nebraska , United States . Nineteen @-@ year @-@ old Robert A. Hawkins killed nine people ( including himself ) and wounded four , two of them critically .

 An hour before the rampage , Hawkins ' mother gave the Sarpy County Sheriff 's Department his suicide note , which read : " I just want to take a few pieces of shit with me ... just think tho , I 'm gonna be fuckin famous [ sic ] . " 
 <unk> at first , Hawkins entered the south entrance of the Von Maur department store at about 1 : 36 p.m. CST ( 19 : 36 UTC ) . After slowly walking a short distance into the store , he paused for a second , then turned around and left , in a somewhat agitated state . Returning six minutes later through the same entrance , he proceeded directly to the elevator at his immediate right , this time with a Century <unk> @-@ 10 ( a commercial copy of the <unk> ( 7 @.@ 62 × <unk> ) semi @-@ automatic rifle ) stolen from his stepfather 's house , along with two 30 @-@ round magazines taped together , concealed in a sweatshirt . He took the elevator to the top floor .

 At approximately 1 : 43 p.m. CST ( 19 : 43 UTC ) , Robert Hawkins stepped out of the elevator on the third floor and opened fire . He killed eight people and wounded four others over the course of six minutes , before dying from a self @-@ inflicted gunshot wound to the head near the customer service desk . He fired more than 30 rounds , striking 12 people . Six were killed instantly , one died before reaching the hospital , and another died 45 minutes after reaching the ER of another hospital . 
 Omaha Police arrived at Westroads Mall about six minutes after receiving the first 911 call . During the entire 70 seconds of that first call , all the dispatcher heard was gunshots . Audio tapes and transcripts of the 911 calls , along with images captured by mall security surveillance cameras , were released by the police on December 7 , 2007 . In one 911 call , gunshots can be heard . 
 An autopsy of Hawkins showed that he had 200 nanograms per milliliter of Valium in his system , which is the low end of its therapeutic @-@ use range ( 100 @-@ 1500 ng / mL ) . No trace of any other drug was found in his system .

 Eight people were killed by Hawkins during the shooting . Six were employees at the Von Maur store and the remaining two were customers . They are : 
 Four of the victims shot by Hawkins survived . Two critically injured were store employees . Fred Wilson , 61 , was a manager for the customer service department . He was sent to the University of Nebraska Medical Center with a gunshot wound to the upper chest . By the time he reached the ER , he had lost three @-@ quarters of his blood and had no pulse . Wilson was upgraded to stable by the following weekend , and soon after was making some attempts to communicate . The other critically wounded victim was customer service employee <unk> " Mickey " Oldham , 65 , who was sent to Creighton University Medical Center . She sustained heavy injuries to the abdomen and back , and , of the surviving victims , she suffered the worst injuries . 
 Another surviving victim was customer Jeff <unk> , 34 , who was treated and released at UNMC for a gunshot wound to the left arm and the little finger of his left hand . The Omaha Police Department announced on December 22 , 2007 , that Mandy <unk> , 34 , received a bruise when a bullet fragment struck her left leg . She was neither transported nor treated for the injury . It was initially reported that there were five people injured ( not including <unk> ) , but two of those at the scene who were sent to local hospitals were sent for reasons other than being shot by Hawkins .

Westroads Mall also stated on its web site , " Our thoughts and prayers remain with all affected by this tragedy . " Its home page also indicated that the mall would remain closed until the following Saturday , December 8 ; however , the Von Maur store , where the incident took place , did not open until December 20 . In the days following the tragedy , the Von Maur store was thronged on all sides by flowers and signs expressing condolences , as makeshift memorials to the victims . By January 12 , 2008 , a fund for the victims ' families surpassed one million dollars .

 Robert A. Hawkins ( May 17 , 1988 – December 5 , 2007 ) was the 19 @-@ year @-@ old perpetrator of the Westroads Mall shooting . He was born at the RAF Lakenheath station in Suffolk , England , U.K. , to American parents Ronald Hawkins and Maribel " Molly " Rodriguez . He was estranged from his parents and lived with two friends and their mother in a ranch @-@ style house in the Quail Creek Neighborhood of Bellevue , a suburb 10 miles ( 16 km ) south of Omaha . His stepmother had him sent to a psychiatrist when he was just four . He was attending therapy sessions , taking medication and being hospitalized for depression by the time he was six years old . Throughout most of his life , he and his family were plagued by his psychiatric problems . The day after he turned 14 , he was sent to a mental health treatment center for threatening to kill his stepmother Candace Sims with an axe . Four months later , he became a ward of the State of Nebraska , which lasted nearly four years . He had undergone two psychiatric hospitalizations , and was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder , an unspecified mood disorder , oppositional defiant disorder , and parent @-@ child relationship problems . His extensive treatments cost the state $ 265 @,@ 000 . He attended Papillion @-@ La Vista High School and was expelled and later dropped out in March 2006 , but received a GED . Debora <unk> @-@ Kovac , the owner of the house in which Hawkins lived , described him as " troubled " . She also stated that he was depressed over being fired from his job at McDonald 's , reportedly for stealing $ 17 , and over separating from his girlfriend two weeks prior to the incident . 
 Hawkins was ticketed on November 24 , 2007 , for suspicion of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and two alcohol charges , one of which was underage possession of alcohol . He was due in court for an arraignment on December 19 , 2007 . According to local news sources , he threatened to kill a local teenager , because he thought she had stolen his CD player . He was also convicted as a juvenile of a felony drug conviction while in foster care in Omaha . 
 The Smoking Gun released a copy of Hawkins ' three @-@ page suicide note which consisted of a note to his family , one to his friends , and his last will and testament , below which he signed his name and included his Social Security number . Initial news reports indicated that Hawkins wrote in his suicide note , " I 'm going out in style ; " however , the phrase does not appear on the publicly released document . 
 The day after the shooting , the Hawkins family released a statement expressing their condolences for the victims . On December 13 , 2007 , Hawkins ' mother issued a formal apology for Hawkins ' actions in an interview on Good Morning America . 
 In 2016 , the Investigation Discovery TV series " Evil Lives Here " speculated that Robbie had a genetic disposition to violence .

 Mick Flannery ( born 28 November 1983 ) is an Irish singer and songwriter . 
 His debut album Evening Train resulted from his time spent studying music and management at Coláiste <unk> Naofa in Cork . It featured tracks which had previously won Flannery two categories at the International Songwriting Competition in Nashville , Tennessee , as judged by his idol , Tom Waits . He was the first Irish musician to win in this event . 
 Flannery 's second studio album White Lies was released on 12 September 2008 , achieving a top ten position on the Irish Albums Chart . It later went platinum and was nominated for the Choice Music Prize . 
 The Irish Times placed him at number forty @-@ six in a list of " The 50 Best Irish Acts Right Now " published in April 2009 . Also that year Flannery won Best Irish Male at the 2009 Meteor Awards . Influences include Kurt Cobain , Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Flannery was reared on farmland outside Blarney , County Cork . 
 Coming from a family with a keen musical interest , Flannery was introduced to folk and blues music at a young age . 
 Flannery cites an encounter with the music of Kurt Cobain and Nirvana as a direct influence on his desire to become a musician . Seeing Cobain perform " The Man Who Sold the World " on MTV Unplugged he promptly purchased a copy of MTV Unplugged in New York . He soon bought the album Blonde on Blonde as well . Flannery claims to have written his first song at the age of fifteen . His first completed song was called " Mad Man 's Road " , a tale of a murder which took place on the road in which he lived . He has been dismissive of his earlier material , referring to it as " tripe " . 
 However , he is keen to express his fondness for stonemasonry and its position alongside his music : " I wasn 't going to sit in a room and write songs seven days a week and live on bread and beans . I liked doing stonemasonry as well " . He still does it on an occasional basis : " We wouldn ’ t be carving gravestones or anything . We ’ d do the fronts of houses , entrance walls , stuff like that " .

 While undergoing a music and management course at Coláiste <unk> Naofa in Cork , Flannery commenced writing the album that would become Evening Train , an eleven @-@ track concept album about the exploits of two brothers . His original intention had been to write a musical but this endeavour proved unsuccessful . 
 Before its release Flannery and a friend who worked alongside him in the stonemasonry business embarked on a three @-@ month trip to the United States , living in Williamsburg , Brooklyn . Flannery spent his time performing in New York . His sister was present for one of the months and assisted him with organising his performances . Flannery , however , quickly became disillusioned by the New York music scene , and referred to it in one interview as " a bit up its own arse " . 
 Evening Train was received positively by critics in Ireland and the United States . Reviewers noted its " astute and sophisticated lyrics " , its " strong , imaginative melodies " , its Tom Waits sound . The RTÉ Guide later said , " His voice was like Tom Waits meets the howling of a grizzled freight train hobo " . entertainment.ie reviewer Lauren Murphy described it as " an album dripping with maturity , poise and potential " and that " the most astounding thing " was his age of 21 years . 
 Flannery signed with EMI Records in 2007 . That same year he was the subject of a programme called <unk> , broadcast on RTÉ Radio 1 on 29 November . He performed on RTÉ Two 's Other Voices television programme in 2008 . This appearance led to increased interest in Flannery 's music in Ireland . 
 = = = White Lies = = = 
 Flannery 's second studio album White Lies was released on 12 September 2008 , achieving a top ten position on the Irish Albums Chart and later going platinum in Ireland . On the day of the album 's release Flannery performed " Tomorrow 's Papers " on The Late Late Show . The song contributed to the increasing popularity of the singer @-@ <unk> entertainment.ie 's Lauren Murphy said : " White Lies may not be a perfect album , but it 's certainly a promising step forward for a real talent " . RTÉ reviewer Harry Guerin commented : " If you 're adamant that Ireland may sink with another singer @-@ songwriter on tour , then this is a record to seek out ; you won 't notice the time passing and the nation will remain afloat " . 
 Flannery began a tour of Ireland after the release of White Lies . He performed a duet of " Christmas Past " with Lisa Hannigan in December 2008 after Today FM 's Tony Fenton paired them together for a radio show broadcast from a rooftop . He joined Hannigan at a show in Vicar Street to perform the same duet that month . " Tomorrow 's Paper " was translated into the Irish language for a CD titled Ceol ' 09 , an annual compilation released by <unk> na <unk> . The Irish version was recorded in forty minutes at a studio in Dublin 's Merrion Square . Flannery performed a cover version of " The River " on The Ray D 'Arcy Show 's Discover Ireland Feel Good Tour stopover in Carlingford and Cooley Peninsula in March 2009 . A deluxe edition of White Lies , which featured a duet of the song " Christmas Past " with Kate Walsh , was released in 2009 . 
 Flannery 's largest headlining performance in Dublin at this stage occurred at Vicar Street on 25 May 2009 . He performed alongside John Spillane at Live at the Marquee in Cork on 9 July 2009 . Flannery said being asked to perform there was " daunting [ ... ] In many ways I have drifted into this career and still have to pinch myself regularly to make sure I am not imagining it all " . He also performed at the Bloom Festival as part of the 50th anniversary celebrations of The Rose of Tralee in 2009 . He made an appearance on the Crawdaddy Stage at Electric Picnic 2009 .

 = Neepaulakating Creek = 
 Neepaulakating Creek is a 2 @.@ 4 @-@ mile long ( 3 @.@ 8 km ) tributary of Papakating Creek in Wantage Township in Sussex County , New Jersey in the United States . It is one of three streams feeding the Papakating Creek , a major contributor to the Wallkill River . Although the stream was dammed in the 1950s to create Lake Neepaulin as the focal point of a private residential development , the stream did not receive a name until 2002 . Residents chose a name that combined elements of the names " Neepaulin " and " Papakating " , and submitted a proposal to the United States Board of Geographic Names . The name was approved in 2004 .

 Neepaulakating Creek is small stream whose headwaters are located at 640 feet ( 195 m ) above sea level approximately 0 @.@ 4 miles ( 0 @.@ 6 km ) northwest of the north end of Lake Neepaulin . These headwaters are located a short distance south of County Route 650 ( Libertyville Road ) roughly halfway between the hamlet of <unk> in Wantage Township and Sussex Borough . The stream flows into Lake Neepaulin located at 509 ft ( 155 m ) above sea level . The man @-@ made lake , created through damming , is the centre of a private residential development . It flows southeast from the lake 's dam in the southeast direction for another 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) before flowing into Papakating Creek . It enters Papakating Creek at 395 feet ( 120 m ) above sea level approximately 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 km ) upstream of that creek 's junction with the Wallkill River at a location directly south of Sussex Borough along County Route 565 near the hamlet of Lewisburg in Wantage Township and near Sussex Airport . 
 Along with the Clove Brook and West Branch Papakating Creek , Neepaulakating Creek is one the tributaries that form the 60 @.@ 6 square miles ( 157 km2 ) watershed of Papakating Creek , a major tributary of the Wallkill River . The Papakating Creek watershed is located in the Kittatinny Valley , is underlain by dark shale and limestone of the Martinsburg Formation , and has soils of glacial origin . The topography of the Papakating Creek 's watershed ranges from gentle slopes in the east to steeper slopes in the west . According to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection ( NJDEP ) , the Papakating watershed consists of gently sloping farmland , forested land , wetlands , older individually built homes , and low @-@ density residential development . 
 According to NJDEP reports , two developed lake communities in the Papakating Creek watershed — Lake Neepaulin and the nearby Clove Acres Lake contribute to phosphorus loading in the waters of Papakating Creek . The phosphorus loading may originate from the runoff of fertilizer applications on residential lawns , nearby agricultural operations , or from large populations of geese that inhabit the lakes . 
 = = History and naming = = 
 In the 1950s , a real estate developer dammed an unnamed stream located to the west and south of Sussex Borough and created Lake Neepaulin . The lake was the center of a planned private lakeside residential community . In 2002 , an organization known as Friends of Lake Neepaulin , began using " Neepaulakating Creek " as a new name for an unnamed stream that was dammed to create the lake . After a review of resources available on the internet , topographic maps , and other government and historical documents , a state engineer reported there was no evidence the stream had any previous name . The name chosen , Neepaulakating , was a combination of portions of the names " Neepaulin " and " Papakating " . Lake Neepaulin was named after a combination of the original developers children 's names . 
 A formal proposal prepared by the residents was submitted to the Board of Geographic Names by Nathaniel <unk> , described as the Outreach Coordinator of the Wallkill River Watershed and a member of Friends of Lake Neepaulin . <unk> reported to the United States Geological Survey 's Board of Geographic Names that studies such as visual and biological <unk> were carried out on the unnamed stream by the Lake Neepaulin Lake Association for roughly two years , during which time they had begun to call it " Neepaulakating Creek " . On February 25 , 2004 , the Sussex County Board of Chosen Freeholders unanimously approved a resolution to support the naming , stating that the county government " defers to the Township of Wantage and concurs with the naming of the tributary as ' Neepaulakating Creek ' " . On April 8 , 2004 , the Board of Geographic Names approved the proposal .

 = Avro Canada VZ @-@ 9 Avrocar = 
 The Avro Canada VZ @-@ 9 Avrocar was a VTOL aircraft developed by Avro Aircraft Ltd . ( Canada ) as part of a secret U.S. military project carried out in the early years of the Cold War . The Avrocar intended to exploit the Coandă effect to provide lift and thrust from a single " turborotor " blowing exhaust out the rim of the disk @-@ shaped aircraft to provide anticipated VTOL @-@ like performance . In the air , it would have resembled a flying saucer . 
 Originally designed as a fighter @-@ like aircraft capable of very high speeds and altitudes , the project was repeatedly scaled back over time and the U.S. Air Force eventually abandoned it . Development was then taken up by the U.S. Army for a tactical combat aircraft requirement , a sort of high @-@ performance helicopter . In flight testing , the Avrocar proved to have unresolved thrust and stability problems that limited it to a degraded , low @-@ performance flight envelope ; subsequently , the project was cancelled in September 1961 . 
 Through the history of the program , the project was referred to by a number of different names . Avro referred to the efforts as Project Y , with individual vehicles known as Spade and Omega . Project Y @-@ 2 was later funded by the U.S. Air Force , who referred to it as WS @-@ 606A , Project 1794 and Project Silver Bug . When the U.S. Army joined the efforts it took on its final name " Avrocar " , and the designation " VZ @-@ 9 " , part of the U.S. Army 's VTOL projects in the VZ series . 
 = = Design and development = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 The Avrocar was the ultimate result of a series of blue skies research projects by designer " Jack " Frost , who had joined Avro Canada in June 1947 after working for several British firms . He had been with de Havilland from 1942 and had worked on the de Havilland Hornet , de Havilland Vampire jet fighter and the de Havilland Swallow aircraft , where he had been the chief designer on the supersonic research project . 
 At Avro Canada , he had worked on the Avro CF @-@ 100 before creating a research team known as the " Special Projects Group " ( SPG ) . Frost first surrounded himself with a collection of like @-@ minded " maverick " engineers , then arranged for a work site . Initially ensconced in the " Penthouse " , a derisive nickname for the executive wing of the Administration Building , the SPG was subsequently relocated to a Second World War @-@ era structure across from the company headquarters , the Schaeffer Building , that was secured with security guards , locked doors and special pass cards . At times , the SPG also operated out of the Experimental Hangar where it shared space with other esoteric Avro project teams . 
 At the time , Frost was particularly interested in jet engine design and ways to improve the efficiency of the compressor without sacrificing the simplicity of the turbine engine . He found Frank Whittle 's " reverse flow " design too complex and was interested in ways to clean up the layout . This led him to design a new type of engine layout with the flame cans lying directly outside the outer rim of the centrifugal compressor , pointed outwards like the spokes on a wheel . Power for the compressor was drawn from a new type of turbine similar to a centrifugal fan , as opposed to the more typical pinwheel @-@ like design of conventional engines . The turbine drove the compressor using gearing , rather than a shaft . The resulting engine was arranged in the form of a large disk , which he referred to as a " pancake engine . " The jet thrust exited from around the entire rim of the engine , and this presented problems trying to adapt the design to a typical aircraft . 
 = = = Project Y = = = 
 At the same time , the aircraft industry as a whole was becoming increasingly interested in VTOL aircraft . It was expected that any future European war would start with a nuclear exchange that would destroy most airbases , so aircraft would need to operate from limited airbases , roads or even unprepared fields . Considerable research effort was put into various solutions to securing a second @-@ strike capability . Some of these solutions included rocket @-@ launched aircraft like the zero @-@ length launch concept , while many companies started work on VTOL aircraft as a more appropriate long @-@ term solution . 
 Frost felt the excellent performance of his new engine would be a natural fit for a VTOL aircraft due to its high expected power @-@ to @-@ weight ratio . The problem was how to use the annular thrust to drive the aircraft forward , as well as the problem of fitting the very large engine into a suitable airframe . Frost suggested using a series of ducts and vents to redirect the thrust flowing out of the front of the engine towards the rear . In order to keep the pipes as short as possible , the design ported the thrust out along the leading edge of what was essentially a thick delta wing . As the engine was disk @-@ shaped , the triangular delta shape was pushed out near the front where it met the engine disk , producing a shape roughly like a spade on a playing card . For this reason the design was also referred to as the " Avro Ace , " a likely reference to the Ace of Spades . 
 The engine was disk shaped and its intake was positioned in the middle , which meant the engine air intakes had to be located near the middle of the wing . In the Ace design , these were located just to the front of the centre on the top and bottom of the aircraft . The cockpit was positioned over the main bearing , behind the intakes . A " spine " on the top and bottom ran from the cockpit area to the rear edge of the aircraft . Several other versions of the basic layout were also studied , including the " Omega " which was more disk @-@ like as it cut away the rear portions of the delta wing as well . 
 For VTOL operations the aircraft was expected to sit pointed up , supported by long landing legs that extended out of the spine . Landing would be accomplished at a very high angle , making visibility during the approach very difficult . A number of other VTOL experiments of the era attempted various solutions to this problem , including rotating pilots seats and cockpits , but none proved very effective . Another problem with various VTOL experiments was that stability in a hover was difficult to arrange , although not entirely unexpected . A solution to this problem would require the thrust to be directed downward from a larger area , as it is in a helicopter , where the lift is supplied over the entire area of the rotor disk . Most designers turned to bleeding off air from the engine 's compressor , and directing that through pipes arranged around the aircraft . Frost 's engine design used such a large number of nozzles that such an arrangement would not be to easy to build . 
 In 1952 , the design was advanced enough that the Canadian Defense Research Board funded the effort with a $ 400 @,@ 000 contract . By 1953 , a wooden mock @-@ up of Project Y was completed , of which only images remain . It appears the project was considered too costly within the military establishment , which was at the time involved in several extremely expensive air defense projects . On 11 February 1953 , a story on the project was leaked to the Toronto Star along with images of the Omega design , apparently in order to gain further funding ( a strategy widely employed in the U.S. at the time , known as policy by press release ) . Five days later , the Minister for Defense Production informed the House of Commons that Avro was indeed working on a " mock @-@ up model " of a flying saucer , capable of flying at 1 @,@ 500 miles per hour ( 2 @,@ 400 km / h ) and climbing vertically . Nevertheless , further funding was not forthcoming . 
 = = = Project Y @-@ 2 : the " flat @-@ riser " = = = 
 While Project Y continued , Frost had meanwhile become interested in the Coandă effect , where fluid flows will follow strongly convex shapes , something that might be unexpected at first glance . Frost felt the effect could be used with his engine design to produce a more practical VTOL aircraft , the exhaust flowing outward over the upper surface of the aircraft and then being directed downward over a flap @-@ like arrangement . This would produce a lift force around the entire edge of the aircraft , allowing it to land " flat " . He produced a number of small experimental designs using compressed air in place of an engine in order to select a suitable airframe shape , and eventually decided that a disk was the best solution . 
 As he continued these experiments , he found that the same thrust @-@ direction system he intended for VTOL operations worked just as well for forward flight . In this case the disk shape was not of itself a good lifting surface , as it was neutral in terms of lift direction – that is , it would fly sideways as readily as it would fly forward . However , by modifying the airflow with the application of a small amount of jet thrust , the overall airflow over the craft could be dramatically altered , creating a sort of " virtual airfoil " of any needed configuration . For instance , by directing even a small amount of jet thrust down , a large mass of air would be pulled over the upper surface of the wing and dramatically augment the flow over the wing , creating lift . 
 This appeared to offer a solution to one of the most vexing problems of the era , designing an aircraft that was effective at subsonic and supersonic speeds . Subsonic lift is created by the airflow around the wing following streamlines , but supersonic lift is generated by shock waves at points of critical curvature . No single design could offer high performance for both regimes . The blown disk could attack this problem by being laid out for supersonic performance only , and then using jet thrust to modify subsonic airflow into a semblance of a normal wing . The resulting design would be tuned for high supersonic performance , have reasonable subsonic performance , and would also offer VTOL , all in a single design . 
 = = = U.S. Involvement : Project 1794 / WS 606A = = = 
 In late 1953 , a group of U.S. defence experts visited Avro Canada to view the new CF @-@ 100 fighter jet . Somewhere along the way , Frost co @-@ opted the tour and rerouted it to the Special Projects area where he proceeded to show off the Project Y mock @-@ up and models and drawings ( some never before seen by senior company officials ) for a completely circular disk @-@ shaped aircraft known as " Project Y @-@ 2 . " The USAF agreed to take over funding for Frost 's Special Projects Group , and a contract for US $ 750 @,@ 000 followed in 1955 . By 1956 , Avro management was interested enough to commit $ 2 @.@ 5 million to build a " private venture " prototype . In March 1957 , the Air Force added additional funding , and the aircraft became Weapons System 606A . 
 A wide variety of designs were studied for a VTOL fighter aircraft , all revolved around the disk shape , leading to the Project 1794 involving a supersonic large disk fighter aircraft . The concept proceeded to wind tunnel testing with a variety of scale models . It featured a raised section in the middle over the engine , the intake covered with a series of louvers that would be closed in forward flight . Frost 's performance estimates for the concept were for a potential of Mach 3 @.@ 5 at 100 @,@ 000 ft ( 30 @,@ 000 m ) altitudes . 
 There was some debate about the concept within the USAF , as many groups were attempting to gain funding for their own pet projects , like nuclear powered bombers . In a repeat of the earlier Toronto Star release , in 1955 an extensive article appeared in Look magazine that , among other claims , speculated that current UFO sightings were Soviet @-@ built saucers . The article went on to describe such an aircraft with diagrams that were clearly influenced by the Avro design . 
 For testing purposes , a new engine consisting of six Armstrong Siddeley Viper jet engines blowing across the outer rim of an impeller was designed under the name PV @-@ 704 , PV stood for Private Venture . The PV @-@ 704 was a stop @-@ gap design built into a bunker @-@ like building behind the Avro Experimental Test facility . It was intended to test various Project 1794 concepts and provide the USAF with test data to show the viability of the concept . The original plan to initially test the Viper Engine Rig was to have continued into free flight testing . Unfortunately , testing was anything but smooth ; the test model suffered from hazardous oil leaks , resulting in three fires . It eventually got to the point that staff were afraid of the machine , even when safely ensconced in a booth constructed of bullet @-@ proof glass and quarter @-@ inch @-@ thick steel . A final , disastrous and nearly lethal engine test in 1956 which involved a Viper jet engine running wild , convinced Frost that a less dangerous test vehicle was necessary . 
 = = = Genesis of the Avrocar = = = 
 To gather flight data on the basic concept while the engine development continued , in 1958 Frost proposed building a smaller " proof @-@ of @-@ concept " test vehicle he called the Avrocar . By this point , the U.S. Army was involved in a wide variety of experiments on smaller VTOL aircraft that would act as a " flying Jeep , " and they became interested in Avro 's concept as well . Frost pitched his smaller design both as a prototype of a vehicle suitable for the Army 's needs , as well as an aerodynamic testbed for the WS @-@ 606 . Initial performance requirements for the Avrocar were a ten @-@ minute hover capability in ground effect and 25 @-@ mile ( 40 km ) range with a 1 @,@ 000 lb ( 450 kg ) payload . 
 The new plan appeared to make everybody happy , and a $ 2 million joint @-@ services contract managed by the Air Force was awarded to Avro to build and test two <unk> , which the Army referred to as the VZ @-@ 9 @-@ AV ( with AV standing for " Avro , " an unusual departure from normal U.S. Army nomenclature ) , the latest in a series of " VZ " aircraft . Army interest in the Avrocar program was apparently very high . Bernard Lindenbaum of the Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory recalls a trip to Washington in the late 1950s to request additional funding for a study on helicopter drag reduction . Although the funding was approved , he overheard an Army General remark that the Huey would be the last helicopter the Army would buy since the helicopter would be replaced by the Avrocar . 
 Additional Air Force funding of approximately $ 700 @,@ 000 ( unexpended from the 606A program ) was also moved to the Avrocar project . In March 1959 , an additional $ 1 @.@ 77 million contract was received for a second prototype . At rollout , projected performance was far in excess of the requirement , with a 225 knots ( 417 km / h ) maximum speed , 10 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) ceiling , 130 @-@ mile ( 209 km ) range with 1 @,@ 000 lb ( 450 kg ) payload , and hover out of ground effect with 2 @,@ 428 lb ( 1 @,@ 101 kg ) payload . Maximum takeoff weight with transition to forward flight out of ground effect was calculated to be 5 @,@ 650 lb ( 2 @,@ 560 kg ) , maximum weight with a transition in ground effect ( <unk> ) was 6 @,@ 970 lb ( 3 @,@ 160 kg ) . 
 Just as the first working test models were being manufactured , disaster struck . The Canadian government cancelled the Avro CF @-@ 105 Arrow program on " Black Friday , " 20 February 1959 . The ensuing result was the lay @-@ off of almost all Avro Canada employees , including those with the Special Projects Group . However , three days following the announcement of the Arrow cancellation , many of the Special Projects employees were rehired . But it wasn 't quite business as usual . The team now included people from the CF @-@ 100 and CF @-@ 105 teams and the Special Projects Group was moved into the main building , which was nearly empty . As well , company " brass " became more involved in the group ’ s operations . 
 The USAF Project Office devoted to the Avro projects , recommended that the WS @-@ 606A and all related work ( including the Avrocar ) be cancelled . A " stop / go " work order came down and Frost was forced once more to try to rescue the project . In an elaborate effort , Frost made a resounding case for continuation of U.S. military funding . Late in May 1959 , the USAF authorized Avro to continue the " flying saucer " programs . 
 = = Design = = 
 The Avrocar was a disk @-@ shaped aircraft with the same basic shape as a frisbee , the upper surface of the disk being fairly curved , and the bottom much less so . The disk was 18 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) in diameter and 3 @.@ 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 1 m ) thick . The main structural truss was a large equilateral triangle , to which the various components were attached . The 124 @-@ blade " turborotor " sat in the center of the triangle , with most of the rotor 's thrust directed straight down through an opening in the lower surface , but some was bled off to power the control system running along the outer rim of the disk . Power for the rotor was provided by three Continental <unk> @-@ T @-@ 9 jet engines attached to the truss . Each engine had its own fuel and oil tanks and other support systems , although it was expected these would be interconnected in future models . The majority of the airframe was made of aluminum with an empty weight of 3 @,@ 000 pounds ( 1 @,@ 400 kg ) . 
 Pilot control was entirely through a single side @-@ mounted control stick . Pitch and roll were controlled through conventional fore @-@ aft and side @-@ to @-@ side motions , while yaw could be controlled by twisting the stick . No mechanical linkages were used , the stick instead controlled the flow of high pressure air around the craft , which either directly attached to various control surfaces , or indirectly through local cable linkages to replace controls that were intended to be cable @-@ actuated ( like throttle controls on the engines ) . 
 The attitude / thrust control system consisted of a large ring situated outside of the main disk , shaped roughly like a rounded triangle with the flat surface on the " inside . " Viewing the craft from the side , the control flap is almost invisible , appearing in its neutral position to blend into the profile . The pilot 's controls moved the ring in relation to the rest of the craft , affecting the airflow moving outward from the center of the craft . Vertical lift could be increased by moving the entire ring down , which would produce more airflow over its upper surface , which would then bend down over this surface toward the ground . <unk> the ring resulted in asymmetric thrust for directional control . 
 It was discovered that the craft was inherently unstable in forward flight , as the aerodynamic center of pressure was well forward of the center of gravity . The Avrocar thus included a mechanical stability control system that was independent of the pilot 's controls . The turborotor had a fairly large angular momentum and was intended to act as a powerful gyroscope , providing a " normal " direction of flight . Control cables attached to the base of the rotor would be pulled when the craft moved in relation to the rotor , actuating the control surfaces to counteract the motion . 
 The vehicle was manned by a crew of two , positioned in separate cockpits squeezed into empty areas in the airframe . In practice , only one pilot was usually on board during testing ; a number of flights were made with an observer in the second cockpit . Until control problems were completely solved , the Avro test pilots acquired a " touch " for the extremely sensitive control inputs and Avro Aircraft Chief Development Test Pilot Potocki was eventually able to demonstrate a " hands @-@ off " flight . Nonetheless , Avro test pilot Peter Cope , USAF project pilot Walter J. Hodgson and NASA Ames Chief Test Pilot Fred J. Drinkwater III , who all flew the Avrocar , considered it still a tricky vehicle to fly . Drinkwater likened a flight in it to " balancing on a beach ball . " 
 The undercarriage of the Avrocar was rudimentary with three small <unk> wheels mounted on " stub " shafts ; a set of skids was substituted later in testing although they were not normally fitted .

 = = = Testing = = = 
 The first Avrocar , # 58 @-@ 7055 , rolled out of the Avro Malton factory in May 1959 . From 9 June to 7 October 1959 , it was tested in a static hover rig . Unfortunately , hot gas from the exhaust was found to mix back into the intakes in hover , reducing engine thrust . In addition , the fan generated lift only from a small area of its surface , lowering overall thrust available . The ducts also proved to have higher losses than expected , and a series of modifications were not able to solve this problem to any large degree . These problems reduced maximum lift at higher altitudes out of the ground effect to 3 @,@ 150 lb ( 1 @,@ 430 kg ) , less than the empty weight of the aircraft at 4 @,@ 285 lb ( 1 @,@ 944 kg ) . This meant the aircraft would be incapable of hovering out of the ground effect . Following these tests , the vehicle was sent to NASA Ames for a wind tunnel testing . 
 The second , # 59 @-@ <unk> , was completed August 1959 . On 29 September , the first attempt to hover was made with the Avrocar tethered to the ground . After the vehicle became airborne , an uncontrollable roll and pitch @-@ coupled oscillation started that forced each of the three wheels into the ground in turn . The pilot , W.D. " Spud " Potocki , immediately shut down all engines . Changes were made to the stability system to provide more control authority , while new tethers were investigated to improve the ability to control these sorts of problems . As testing continued it became clear that the problem was inherent to the design , and the engineers started referring to the effect as " <unk> , " so @-@ named as it appeared similar to a <unk> spun on the ground . 
 Investigations into the effect revealed what was causing the problem . While in the ground effect , the high @-@ pressure air under the craft was trapped , filling the entire area and thus providing a stable base . When the craft rose out of the ground effect , the air formed itself into a single narrow column , described by Frost as " tree trunking " . At intermediate altitudes the craft would momentarily transition from one regime to the other , during which time one side of the vehicle would be entirely supported while the support was disappearing under the other . This led to a strong pitching motion towards the unsupported side . As soon as this occurred that side would approach the ground and re @-@ establish the supporting air , while the other side would then be raised above this limit . This process would repeat itself , with the craft rolling from side to side . Modifications were carried out in order to try to solve the problem . Eventually a series of 52 holes were drilled in the bottom of the vehicle , located radially three feet from the center . These were to provide a central jet to stabilize the ground cushion . 
 With these modifications complete and apparently working , the first completely free flight occurred on 12 November 1959 . This test proved the nozzle control system unacceptable . The spoilers were intended to direct the air out over the top or bottom of the annular flap , out the bottom only during hover , but over the top and bottom during forward flight . The idea was that when the flap was positioned in order to provide control , the lift would be lowered on one side and raised on the other . Lift was indeed lowered on one side , but sadly the lift did not improve on the other , so every control input resulted in a loss of altitude . After five flights , testing was temporarily halted on 5 December 1959 , by which time the Avrocar had logged 18 @.@ 5 hours of test time in total . 
 A completely new design was installed over the winter . The original spoilers were removed and replaced by a single ring below the annular flap . The ring shifted in relation to the craft under control input , " sealing off " the gap on one side while opening it on the other . Tests continued in January 1960 , and appeared to work much better . However , while the new control system improved the hovering qualities , the craft now became unstable at higher speeds above 30 knots ( 56 km / h ) . The first Avrocar at Ames was similarly modified , and , in April 1960 , it was tested in their 40 ft × 80 ft ( 12 m × 24 m ) wind tunnel . The problem became clear ; the ring blocked so much of the overall engine thrust that the overall power was greatly reduced . As the craft sped up , the airflow on the underside reduced the recirculation , reducing the lift due to airflow over the upper surface . This was somewhat unexpected ; recirculation had been considered a " bad thing " due to the loss of engine thrust , and its positive effects on lift do not appear to have been appreciated . In the end , in order to maintain lift at higher forward speeds the craft had to be pitched to the end of its control capability . 
 Avro was convinced that the concept was still workable , and proposed a new program for major rework of the propulsion and control system . Instead of the single annular triangular flap and spoilers , or the later ring control , the new system included two separate control systems for hover and forward flight , combined into a single nozzle . For hover , a series of " transition doors " were opened into the nozzles , blocking them off and re @-@ directing the flow downward under the aircraft . Control during this regime was provided by moving the outer portion of the flap to " focus " the flow . At higher speeds , the doors were closed , allowing the air to flow out from the edge of the aircraft , where a series of simple flap @-@ like controls were located . The new control system covered the rear 3 / 4 's of the aircraft 's outer circumference ; the front section featured the hovering controls only . 
 Modifications were completed on the Ames model and testing resumed in April 1961 . The new design demonstrated much better control in hover and considerably improved lift . The vehicle was now able to travel at up to 100 knots ( 190 km / h ) , a great improvement over the 30 knots ( 56 km / h ) previously reached . However , it remained unstable in pitch , and exhibited a strong nose @-@ up trim . NASA engineers attempted to modify this with a T @-@ tail , but this proved to sit within the airflow of the turborotor and did not help . Frost 's team considered two new designs , one with a large vertical tail and one with a wing with tip mounted verticals — " winglets . " Both designs used two 2 @,@ 700 lbf ( 12 kN ) thrust General Electric J85 turbojets and increased the turborotor diameter from five to six ft . 
 On 9 June 1961 , a second USAF / NASA flight evaluation of the Avrocar was conducted on the similarly modified second prototype at the Avro facility . During these tests , the vehicle reached a maximum speed of 20 knots ( 37 km / h ) and showed the ability to traverse a ditch six feet across and 18 inches ( 460 mm ) deep . Flight above the critical altitude proved dangerous if not nearly impossible due to inherent instability . The flight test report further identified a range of control problems .

 Before modifications could be achieved , funding ran out in March 1961 . Frost 's proposals for a modified design were not accepted , and the Avrocar and related WS @-@ 606A supersonic VTOL programs were officially cancelled in December 1961 by the U.S. military . Avro company executives encouraged additional VTOL research projects , exploring new configurations married to a disk platform and even a " lift jet " version , but no further interest resulted from Canadian or other sources , to cap the end of this Special Projects Group program . In 1961 , a number of later proposals , including the Avro <unk> VTOL fighter concept derived from the Special Projects Group , were submitted to fulfill a NATO competition for a tactical strike fighter . These needs were filled by the Hawker Siddeley Harrier , but in more general terms , interest in VTOL faded as it became widely believed a nuclear first strike would not be used at the start of a European war . 
 The second Avrocar had logged about 75 flight hours at the end of the flight testing . Judged by its performance , the Avrocar was an abject failure : it couldn 't lift itself safely more than a few feet off the ground , and its bulbous design limiting high @-@ speed performance accompanied by unbearable heat and screaming exhaust noise , made it impractical for the military . Although considered a technical failure , its design would be prophetic : it was a rubber skirt shy of being one of the world 's first hovercraft , the Saunders Roe <unk> also taking off in 1959 . Nevertheless , company designer John Frost applied for a number of patents in Canada , the UK and the U.S. that established the pivotal role that the Avrocar and related Avro experimental vehicles made in the VTOL world .

 The Avro VZ @-@ 9 Avrocar was a " dead end " in VTOL design , according to Russell Lee , curator at the National Air and Space Museum , yet its technological innovations have intrigued other designers . One of the design elements it embodied , the use of ducted fans , led to other experimental programs . Dr. Paul Moller , a Canadian expatriate who had worked at Avro Canada as a young engineer , based an initial series of experimental VTOL vehicles on " saucer " technology utilizing the buried ducted fan à la @-@ Avrocar . The XM @-@ 2 , the first of the series looked remarkably like a miniature flying saucer . After successful tether tests , the saucer designs also at one time publicized as " <unk> " were abandoned and their latest project , the Moller <unk> , has a flying @-@ car appearance . 
 The Avrocar story did not end with the termination of the program . Only two <unk> were ever produced and because the U.S. military had paid for the work , they reverted to U.S. ownership at the end of the program . The second example , S / N 59 @-@ <unk> , utilized for " flight " testing , returned to Canada briefly for display in Montreal at the Man and His World Exhibition ( 1968 ) ; after a lengthy period of outdoor display , it is now under restoration at the U.S. Army Transportation Museum in Fort Eustis , Virginia . 
 The first Avrocar , S / N 58 @-@ 7055 ( marked AV @-@ 7055 ) , after tethered testing , became the " wind tunnel " test model at NASA Ames , where it remained in storage from 1961 until 1966 , when it was donated to the National Air and Space Museum , in Suitland , Maryland . There it continued gathering dust for the next forty years . The Museum finally scheduled it for restoration and display at their newly constructed Steven F. Udvar @-@ Hazy Center . Instead the Avrocar has been loaned to the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton , Ohio , arriving in November , 2007 . After a full restoration , which included fabrication of both missing plexiglass bubbles , it was put on display in June 2008 in the Museum 's Cold War Gallery . It has since been moved to the Presidential Aircraft Gallery . 
 A full @-@ scale replica of the Avrocar was prepared for the 2002 production , Avrocar : Saucer Secrets from the Past . It now resides as an exhibit at the Western Canada Aviation Museum , Winnipeg , Manitoba , Canada .

 Hamilton ( / <unk> / ; 2011 population 519 @,@ 949 ; UA population 670 @,@ 580 ; CMA population 721 @,@ 053 ) is a port city in the Canadian province of Ontario . Conceived by George Hamilton when he purchased the Durand farm shortly after the War of 1812 , Hamilton has become the centre of a densely populated and industrialized region at the west end of Lake Ontario known as the Golden Horseshoe . On January 1 , 2001 , the new City of Hamilton was formed through the amalgamation of the former city and the other constituent lower @-@ tier municipalities of the Regional Municipality of Hamilton @-@ Wentworth with the upper @-@ tier regional government . Residents of the old city are known as Hamiltonians . Since 1981 , the metropolitan area has been listed as the ninth largest in Canada and the third largest in Ontario . 
 Hamilton is home to the Royal Botanical Gardens , the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum , the Bruce Trail , McMaster University and Mohawk College . McMaster University is ranked 4th in Canada and 94th in the world by Times Higher Education Rankings 2015 @-@ 16 and has a well @-@ known medical school . The Canadian Football Hall of Fame can be found downtown right beside Hamilton City Hall and across town to the east , the Canadian Football League 's Hamilton Tiger @-@ Cats began playing at the new Tim Hortons Field in 2014 , which was built as part of the 2015 Pan American Games . 
 Possibly because of its diverse environment , numerous TV and film productions have been filmed in Hamilton , regulated by the Hamilton Film and Television Office . A growing arts and culture community garnered media attention in 2006 when the Globe and Mail published an article called " Go West , Young Artist " about Hamilton 's growing art scene . The article highlighted local art galleries , recording studios and independent film production . 
 = = History = = 
 In pre @-@ colonial times , the Neutral Indians used much of the land but were gradually driven out by the Five ( later Six ) Nations ( Iroquois ) who were allied with the British against the Huron and their French allies . A member of the Iroquois Confederacy provided the route and name for Mohawk Road , which originally included King Street in the lower city . In 1784 , about 10 @,@ 000 United Empire Loyalists settled in Upper Canada ( what is now southern Ontario ) , chiefly in Niagara , around the Bay of Quinte , and along the St. Lawrence River between Lake Ontario and Montreal . They were soon followed by many more Americans , some of them not so much ardent loyalists but attracted nonetheless by the availability of inexpensive , arable land . At the same time , large numbers of Iroquois loyal to Britain arrived from the United States and were settled on reserves west of Lake Ontario . 
 The town of Hamilton was conceived by George Hamilton ( a son of a Queenston entrepreneur and founder , Robert Hamilton ) , when he purchased farm holdings of James Durand , the local Member of the British Legislative Assembly , shortly after the War of 1812 . Nathaniel Hughson , a property owner to the north , cooperated with George Hamilton to prepare a proposal for a courthouse and jail on Hamilton 's property . Hamilton offered the land to the crown for the future site . Durand was empowered by Hughson and Hamilton to sell property holdings which later became the site of the town . As he had been instructed , Durand circulated the offers at York during a session of the Legislative Assembly and a new Gore District was established of which the Hamilton townsite was a member . 
 Initially , this town was not the most important centre of the Gore District . A permanent jail was not constructed until 1832 when a cut @-@ stone design was completed on one of the two squares created in 1816 , Prince 's Square . Subsequently , the first police board and the town limits were defined by statute on February 13 , 1833 . Official City status was achieved on June 9 , 1846 , by an act of Parliament , 9 Victoria Chapter 73 . 
 As the city grew , several prominent buildings were constructed in the late 19th century , including the Grand Lodge of Canada in 1855 , West Flamboro Methodist Church in 1879 ( later purchased by Dufferin Masonic Lodge in 1893 ) , a public library in 1890 , and the Right House department store in 1893 . The first commercial telephone service in Canada , the first telephone exchange in the British Empire , and the second telephone exchange in all of North America all were established in the city between 1877 – 78 . The city had several interurban electric street railways and two inclines , all powered by the Cataract Power Co . 
 Though suffering through the Hamilton Street Railway strike of 1906 , with industrial businesses expanding , Hamilton 's population doubled between 1900 and 1914 . Two steel manufacturing companies , Stelco and Dofasco , were formed in 1910 and 1912 , respectively , and Procter & Gamble and the Beech @-@ Nut Packing Company opened manufacturing plants in 1914 and 1922 , respectively , their first outside the US . Population and economic growth continued until the 1960s , with the 1929 construction of the city 's first high @-@ rise building , the Pigott Building , the move of McMaster University from Toronto to Hamilton , the opening of the second Canadian Tire store in Canada in 1934 , an airport in 1940 , a Studebaker assembly line in 1948 , the Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway in 1958 , and the first Tim Hortons store in 1964 . Since then , many of the large industries have moved or shut down operations and the economy has shifted more toward the service sector , such as transportation , education , and health services . 
 On January 1 , 2001 , the new city of Hamilton was formed from the amalgamation of Hamilton and its five neighbouring municipalities : Ancaster , Dundas , Flamborough , Glanbrook , and Stoney Creek . Before amalgamation , the " old " City of Hamilton had 331 @,@ 121 Hamiltonians divided into 100 neighbourhoods . The former region of Hamilton @-@ Wentworth had a population of 490 @,@ 268 . The amalgamation created a single @-@ tier municipal government ending subsidization of its suburbs . The new amalgamated city has 519 @,@ 949 people in over 100 old neighbourhoods , and surrounding communities . 
 The city experienced a devastating fire at the <unk> plastics plant in 1997 . Approximately 300 firefighters battled the blaze , and many sustained severe chemical burns and inhaled volatile organic compounds when at least 400 tonnes of PVC plastic were consumed in the fire .

 Hamilton is located in Southern Ontario on the western end of the Niagara Peninsula and wraps around the westernmost part of Lake Ontario ; most of the city , including the downtown section , is on the south shore . Hamilton is situated in the geographic centre of the Golden Horseshoe and is roughly the midway point between Toronto and Buffalo , New York , although slightly closer to the former . Its major physical features are Hamilton Harbour , marking the northern limit of the city , and the Niagara Escarpment running through the middle of the city across its entire breadth , bisecting the city into " upper " and " lower " parts . The maximum high point is 250m ( 820 ' ) above the level of Lake Ontario . 
 According to all records from local historians , this district was called <unk> by the native Neutral people . The first aboriginals to settle in the Hamilton area called the bay <unk> , meaning " beautiful waters " . Hamilton is one of 11 cities showcased in the book , Green City : People , Nature & Urban Places by Quebec author Mary Soderstrom , which examines the city as an example of an industrial powerhouse co @-@ existing with nature . Soderstrom credits Thomas McQuesten and family in the 1930s who " became champions of parks , greenspace and roads " in Hamilton . 
 Hamilton Harbour is a natural harbour with a large sandbar called the <unk> . This sandbar was deposited during a period of higher lake levels during the last ice age , and extends southeast through the central lower city to the escarpment . Hamilton 's deep sea port is accessed by ship canal through the beach strip into the harbour and is traversed by two bridges , the QEW 's Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway and the lower Canal Lift Bridge . 
 Between 1788 and 1793 , the townships at the Head @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Lake were surveyed and named . The area was first known as The Head @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Lake for its location at the western end of Lake Ontario . John Ryckman , born in Barton township ( where present day downtown Hamilton is ) , described the area in 1803 as he remembered it : " The city in 1803 was all forest . The shores of the bay were difficult to reach or see because they were hidden by a thick , almost impenetrable mass of trees and undergrowth ... Bears ate pigs , so settlers warred on bears . Wolves gobbled sheep and geese , so they hunted and trapped wolves . They also held organized raids on rattlesnakes on the mountainside . There was plenty of game . Many a time have I seen ( sic ) a deer jump the fence into my back yard , and there were millions of pigeons which we clubbed as they flew low . " 
 George Hamilton , a settler and local politician , established a town site in the northern portion of Barton Township in 1815 . He kept several east – west roads which were originally Indian trails , but the north – south streets were on a regular grid pattern . Streets were designated " East " or " West " if they crossed James Street or Highway 6 . Streets were designated " North " or " South " if they crossed King Street or Highway 8 . The overall design of the townsite , likely conceived in 1816 , was commonplace . George Hamilton employed a grid street pattern used in most towns in Upper Canada and throughout the American frontier . The eighty original lots had frontages of fifty feet ; each lot faced a broad street and backed onto a twelve @-@ foot lane . It took at least a decade for all of the original lots to be sold , but the construction of the Burlington Canal in 1823 , and a new court @-@ house in 1827 , encouraged Hamilton to add more blocks around 1828 – 9 . At this time , he included a market square in an effort to draw commercial activity onto his lands , but the natural growth of the town was to the north of Hamilton 's plot . 
 The Hamilton Conservation Authority owns , leases or manages about 4 @,@ 500 hectares ( 11 @,@ 100 acres ) of land with the City operating 1 @,@ 077 hectares ( 2 @,@ 661 acres ) of parkland at 310 locations . Many of the parks are located along the Niagara Escarpment , which runs from Tobermory at the tip of the Bruce Peninsula in the north , to Queenston at the Niagara River in the south , and provides views of the cities and towns at the western end of Lake Ontario . The hiking path Bruce Trail runs the length of the escarpment . Hamilton is home to more than 100 waterfalls and cascades , most of which are on or near the Bruce Trail as it winds through the Niagara Escarpment .

 Hamilton 's climate is humid @-@ continental , characterized by changeable weather patterns . However , its climate is moderate compared with most of Canada . Hamilton 's location on an embayment at the southwestern corner of Lake Ontario with an escarpment dividing upper and lower parts of the city results in noticeable disparities in weather over short distances . This is also the case with pollution levels , which depending on localized winds patterns or low clouds can be high in certain areas mostly originating from the city 's steel industry mixed with regional vehicle pollution . With a July average of exactly 22 @.@ 0 ° C ( 71 @.@ 6 ° F ) , the lower city is located in a pocket of the Dfa climate zone found at the southwestern end of Lake Ontario ( between Hamilton and Toronto and eastward into the Niagara Peninsula ) , while the upper reaches of the city fall into the Dfb climate zone . 
 The airport 's open , rural location and higher altitude ( <unk> vs. <unk> ASL downtown ) results in lower temperatures , generally windier conditions and higher snowfall amounts than lower , built @-@ up areas of the city . One exception is on early spring afternoons ; when colder than air lake temperatures keep shoreline areas significantly cooler , under the presence of an east or north @-@ east onshore flow . 
 The highest temperature ever recorded in Hamilton was 41 @.@ 1 ° C ( 106 ° F ) on 14 July 1868 . The coldest temperature ever recorded was <unk> ° C ( <unk> ° F ) on 25 January 1884 .

Hamilton also had a high proportion of people with Italian , English , Scottish , German and Irish ancestry . Nearly three in ten residents reported English as their sole ethnic origin or as one of their ancestral origins . As well , nearly one in five reported Scottish ancestry either alone or in combination with another ethnic origin . 
 The Canada 2011 Census short form did not include questions on ethnic background or national origin . However , the 2011 National Household Survey ( NHS ) ( a voluntary survey that accompanied the census ) produced the following data :

 In February 2014 , the city 's council voted to declare Hamilton a sanctuary city , offering municipal services to undocumented immigrants at risk of deportation . 
 Hamilton also has a large French community for which provincial services are offered in French . In Ontario , urban centres where there are at least 5000 Francophones or where at least 10 % of the population is francophone are designated areas where bilingual provincial services have to be offered . According to the latest statistics , the Francophone community grew by 50 % between 2006 and 2011 in Hamilton , and in the City , 45 @,@ 000 citizens claim to have knowledge of both official languages , amongst which 13 @,@ 000 have French as a mother tongue .

 The most important economic activity in Ontario is manufacturing , and the Toronto – Hamilton region is the most highly industrialized section of the country . The area from Oshawa , Ontario around the west end of Lake Ontario to Niagara Falls , with Hamilton at its centre , is known as the Golden Horseshoe and had a population of approximately 8 @.@ 1 million people in 2006 . The phrase was first used by Westinghouse President Herbert H. Rogge in a speech to the Hamilton Chamber of Commerce , on January 12 , 1954 . " Hamilton in 50 years will be the forward cleat in a golden horseshoe of industrial development from Oshawa to the Niagara River ... 150 miles long and 50 miles ( 80 km ) wide ... It will run from Niagara Falls on the south to about Oshawa on the north and take in numerous cities and towns already there , including Hamilton and Toronto . " 
 With sixty percent of Canada 's steel being produced in Hamilton by Stelco and Dofasco , the city has become known as the Steel Capital of Canada . After nearly declaring bankruptcy , Stelco returned to profitability in 2004 . On August 26 , 2007 United States Steel Corporation acquired Stelco for C $ 38 @.@ 50 in cash per share , owning more than 76 percent of Stelco 's outstanding shares . On September 17 , 2014 US Steel Canada announced that it was applying for bankruptcy protection and that it would be closing down its Hamilton operations . 
 Dofasco , in 1999 , was the most profitable steel producer in North America and in 2000 , the most profitable in Canada . It currently has approximately 7 @,@ 300 employees at its Hamilton plant and produces over four million tons of steel annually , representing about 30 % of Canada 's flat rolled sheet steel shipments . Dofasco is one of North America 's most profitable steel companies , and Dofasco was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index in 2006 for the seventh year in a row . Dofasco produces steel products for the automotive , construction , energy , manufacturing , pipe and tube , appliance , packaging and steel distribution industries . Dofasco is currently a stand alone subsidiary of <unk> Mittal , the world 's largest steel producer .

 Originally , in the 1940s , the John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport was used as a wartime air force training station . Today TradePort International Corporation manages and operates the John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport . Under TradePort management , passenger traffic at the Hamilton terminal has increased from 90 @,@ 000 in 1996 to approximately 900 @,@ 000 in 2002 . The airport 's mid @-@ term target for growth in its passenger service is five million air travelers annually .

 Citizens of Hamilton are represented at all three levels of Canadian government . Following the 2015 Federal Election , representation in the Parliament of Canada will consist of five Members of Parliament representing the federal ridings of Hamilton West — Ancaster — Dundas , Hamilton Centre , Hamilton East — Stoney Creek , Hamilton Mountain , and Flamborough — Glanbrook . This election will mark the first occasion in which Hamilton will have five Members of Parliament representing areas wholly within Hamilton 's city boundaries , with previous boundaries situating rural ridings across municipal lines . 
 Provincially , there are five elected Members of Provincial Parliament who serve in the Legislature of Ontario . Minister of Housing and Municipal Affairs , Ted <unk> ( Liberal ) , represents Ancaster — Dundas — Flamborough — Westdale . Leader of the Ontario New Democratic Party , Andrea Horwath , represents Hamilton Centre , Paul Miller ( NDP ) represents Hamilton East — Stoney Creek , and Monique Taylor ( NDP ) represents Hamilton Mountain . Former leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario , Tim Hudak , serves as MPP for Niagara West — Glanbrook . 
 Hamilton 's municipal government consists of one mayor , elected city wide , and 15 city councillors , elected individually by each of the city 's wards , to serve on the Hamilton City Council . Presently , Hamilton 's mayor is Fred <unk> , elected on October 27 , 2014 to a second , non @-@ consecutive term . Additionally , both Public and Catholic school board trustees are elected for defined areas ranging from two trustees for multiple wards to a single trustee for an individual ward . 
 Municipal elections in Hamilton occur every four years , the last one occurring on October 27 , 2014 . The next scheduled municipal election will occur in October 2018 . 
 The Hamilton City Council is granted authority to govern by the province through the Municipal Act of Ontario . As with all municipalities , the Province of Ontario has supervisory privilege over the municipality and the power to redefine , restrict or expand the powers of all municipalities in Ontario . 
 The Criminal Code of Canada is the chief piece of legislation defining criminal conduct and penalty . The Hamilton Police Service is chiefly responsible for the enforcement of federal and provincial law . Although the Hamilton Police Service has authority to enforce , bylaws passed by the Hamilton City Council are mainly enforced by Provincial Offences Officers employed by the City of Hamilton .
