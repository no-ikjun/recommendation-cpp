 = = Royal service = = 
 The first secure mentions of Basset are in royal charters dating to around 1102 , where he appears as a witness . He then appears as a judge in a royal dispute with the sheriff of Yorkshire . Basset is named as one of the commissioners of the Liber Winton , a survey of the landholdings in the city of Winchester which took place at some point between 1103 and 1115 , probably close to 1110 . From his Norman lands , Basset is recorded as donating lands to the Abbey of Saint @-@ Evroul in 1113 @.@ in 1111 Basset took part in the Michaelmas session of the Exchequer , and he continued to take part in financial affairs and can be considered as an early Baron of the Exchequer . 
 Basset appears as a royal justice in 1116 , serving in Huntingdonshire . Basset was noted in the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle entry for 1124 as hanging 44 thieves , during an eyre in Leicestershire . Possibly , Basset 's severity was part of an attempt to overawe the under @-@ tenants of the Beaumont twins , one of whom , Waleran , Count of Melun rebelled during 1124 . During the period 1110 – 1127 , Basset was one of the leading royal justices , and was described by the medieval chronicler Henry of Huntingdon as one of the " justices of all England " . Huntingdon 's implication is that Basset 's scope was over all of England , not limited to his own locality . 
 Basset is recorded in the Pipe Roll of 1130 as having performed judicial functions in 11 different shires , even though by this point he was already dead . Basset also served on the informal vice @-@ regency council that assisted Henry 's wife and son when the king was out of England . Basset seems to have spent most of his judicial and royal career in England , as he only is a witness on one royal document that was drawn up in Normandy . According to the compiler of the Basset family charters , William Reedy , " there is more evidence for Ralph 's service for the king in England " than for any other royal servant who was not clergy . His most active period of royal service was from 1120 to 1130 . An older view from historians was that Basset was Chief Justiciar of England is not held by historians currently , nor can the idea that Basset was the head of justices or just the head of the itinerant justices during Henry 's reign cannot be determined with any confidence either . It is clear that Basset was employed by the king extensively and probably that the nobleman worked mostly full @-@ time for the king . 
 Basset 's rewards for his royal service included a number of manors . Basset was granted the manor of <unk> by the king , after the family that held it at the time of Domesday Book died out and it escheated to the king . Other lands held by Basset were probably royal rewards also . One was <unk> , which had been held in 1086 by crown . Another was Stoney Stanton , originally held in 1086 by Robert Despenser . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Basset probably died in 1127 , and was certainly dead in 1130 . He is said to have taken ill at Northampton , and to have been clothed in a monk 's habit while on his deathbed . He was buried in the chapterhouse at Abingdon Abbey , which he left a bequest to . A copy of a charter from Archbishop Theobald of Bec , recorded in a cartulary , records most of Basset 's manors . While most of the estates seem to have been held by Basset as a sub @-@ tenant , four of the estates appear to have been held as a tenant @-@ in @-@ chief . These estates were not very valuable , and Basset can not be considered a baron , although his son Richard managed through marriage to become a member of the barons . He held lands in nine counties , perhaps centred in Berkshire . 
 Basset was the founding member of a dynasty of royal servants who continued to serve the kings of England until around 1250 . The medieval writer and chronicler Orderic Vitalis described Basset as one of the new men of King Henry , who " raised them , so to say , from the dust " . Among Basset 's four sons were Richard Basset , and Nicholas . Another son was Ralph who became a cleric . A fourth son was Turstin , who held land around Wallingford . Basset also had daughters , but their names are not known . Only the first initial of his wife 's name is known , which was A. Richard received the Norman estates , but not most of the English lands , perhaps because he married an heiress . 
 = Augvald = 
 The name " <unk> " or " af <unk> " comes from Augvald ( Old Norse : <unk> ) was a semi @-@ legendary Norwegian petty king portrayed in the legendary Norse sagas . If considered historical , reconstructed estimates based on saga information would have Augvald living some time in the 7th century AD . His kingdom was said to have been based in Jøsursheid , somewhere in the interior of south @-@ western Norway . After a number of naval battles he succeeded in conquering the islands off the western coast of Rogaland . He subsequently moved his kingdom 's seat to the north @-@ east of Karmøy , the largest of those islands and adjacent to the strategically important <unk> strait , to a site later given the name Avaldsnes , after the king . Augvald 's kingdom further expanded to incorporate parts of what is today south @-@ western Hordaland . 
 Augvald had several daughters , including two who notably fought alongside him as so @-@ called shield @-@ maidens , or female warriors . He owned and worshipped a sacred cow , which he always kept with him , believing he owed his victories to the cow and the power of its milk . Augvald was killed during a battle with his rival Ferking , the native king of western Karmøy , with whom his story is interlinked . 
 = = Name = = 
 Augvald 's name ( originally <unk> ) has been interpreted in several different ways , although usually taken to mean " he who is held in awe , " derived from the West @-@ Nordic <unk> meaning holy unrest and tremor . Other interpretations include " the ruler of the coast " , with <unk> meaning stretch of coastline , or " the ruler of the island " , with <unk> meaning dangerous waters / island , which would imply that the king 's name might originally have been either <unk> or <unk> . It has also been suggested that Augvald was probably an epithet gained in adulthood rather than a given name , and there has been speculation that Augvald was actually Harald <unk> . Some historians have alternatively suggested that Augvald could have been a title , possibly shared by many , rather than the name of a single individual , but the saga 's account of Augvald may still have centred on one particularly notable individual . 
 = = Background = = 
 The sagas do not say when Augvald lived , but an early suggestion by <unk> placed Augvald in the 3rd century AD . Modern estimates have been made based on two of his reported descendants , Geirmund and Håvard <unk> , who are said to have settled Iceland as " old men " when Harald Fairhair consolidated his power in Norway . According to an estimate by Marit <unk> Vea based on generation @-@ cycles of 30 years ( though she notes 25 years might be more accurate ) , Augvald would have lived in the Migration Period , with slightly varied interpretations around 580 – 630 , around 600 or in the early 7th century . <unk> Opedal has considered a shorter generation @-@ cycle of 20 years , which would place Augvald 90 years later , at the end of the 7th century . 
 To justify their right to rule , Norse royal families , among other things , traced their bloodlines back to divine creatures . As a member of the West @-@ Nordic royal families , Augvald traced his ancestry back to the ancient giant <unk> ( likely another name for Ymir ) . According to the sagas , Augvald was the son of Rognvald , in turn the son of <unk> , son of Gard <unk> , son of <unk> — a direct descendant of <unk> . Augvald originally had his throne at " <unk> " in " Jøsursheid " . Historian P. A. Munch located the name <unk> in <unk> in western Telemark , and thus placed Augvald 's kingdom in the mountains between Rogaland and Telemark , concluding that the kingdom had stretched to western Telemark . Per <unk> has on the other hand identified Jøsursheid as an old name for the moorland within <unk> in Hjelmeland , although he questions whether conditions in the area could have allowed for the rise of a great chieftain such as Augvald . 
 Described as battle @-@ hungry , Augvald carried out raids into foreign territory , gaining great wealth and honour as a result . After a series of successful naval battles , he went on to conquer the land of the <unk> ( " island @-@ <unk> " ) people , based on the islands off the western coast of Rogaland . He banished the former chieftains from the newly conquered land , and set up his new base at the most favourable location on Karmøy , the largest island in Rogaland . The site he chose was later named Avaldsnes , after Augvald . Based on archaeological findings , it is believed that the ambitions of the increasingly powerful Norwegian chieftains of the time were influenced by the Merovingian Franks , and especially Dagobert and his empire . As a builder of dynasties , Augvald has also been compared to Clovis . 
 Convinced that his cow was responsible for his victories , Augvald worshipped it and always kept it by his side . He also believed that the cow 's milk provided special strength and vitality . According to some accounts , the cow 's name was <unk> ( after <unk> ) , and it wore a golden collar around its neck . 
 Augvald had several daughters , including two who were female warriors , known as shield @-@ maidens ( Norwegian : <unk> ) , and who fought alongside their father in all his battles . Augvald 's ( unnamed ) queen also gave birth to a son , Jøsur , when Augvald was away hunting with his men . Jøsur was raised by Augvald 's earl <unk> on Stord . 
 = = Rivalry with Ferking and death = = 
 Augvald had set up his base in the north @-@ eastern part of Karmøy , but the western part of the island was still ruled by another king , Ferking . The two were not enemies at first , but that changed after Augvald and his men attended a midwinter sacrificial banquet in Ferkingstad . What started as a friendly visit turned sour , and Augvald returned home with his men , leaving his daughters held captive at Ferkingstad . 
 Ferking apparently could not tolerate Augvald 's overlordship of Karmøy , and he went north with his army , meeting Augvald and his army at <unk> , near Avaldsnes . In the resulting battle there many fatalities , but no clear victor . The conclusive battle took place at the Field of <unk> ( <unk> ) , near Ferkingstad . Ferking and his men hid between two gorges , waiting for Augvald to appear . In the fierce battle that followed Augvald and his cow were among the many who lost their lives . When his two daughters saw that Augvald was dead , they jumped into a river and drowned . 
 According to Snorri Sturluson , Augvald was killed by a man named Varin , although the <unk> says it was someone called <unk> . The Saga of Half & His Heroes names Augvald 's killer as " <unk> 's men " , which possibly only refers to caped men . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 According to historical sources , Augvald and his cow were taken from the battlefield and buried at Avaldsnes . In his Saga of Olav Tryggvason , Oddr Snorrason writes that Tryggvason excavated two mounds on Karmøy , revealing the bones of a man in one and those of a cow in the other . Local legends contradict Augvald 's burial at Avaldsnes , stating instead that he was buried in Ferkingstad , on the south side of the 12th @-@ century churchyard . A large memorial stone , still standing , was raised outside the churchyard in memory of Augvald . 
 In the generations following Augvald 's death two royal dynasties appear to fight over the same region , the " <unk> dynasty " of Agder and Rogaland , and the " Jøsur dynasty " of Hordaland and Rogaland . If Augvald was indeed Harald <unk> , as suggested by some modern historians , <unk> and Jøsur could have been two warring brothers . In any event , Augvald 's son Jøsur became king of Rogaland after his father 's death , and reconquered parts of Hordaland . He was in turn succeeded by his son <unk> , who was buried in Rogaland . <unk> 's son , <unk> the Womanizer , was king of Hordaland and Rogaland , and mounted expeditions to <unk> and Denmark . He eventually also captured a kingdom in Zealand , in Denmark . <unk> 's son Half appears as the protagonist in the Saga of Half & His Heroes .

Homer discovers he can make money by stealing and reselling grease , but eventually stops after negative encounters with Groundskeeper Willie and the Springfield Grease Company . Meanwhile , Lisa becomes jealous that a new student ( voiced by Lisa Kudrow ) is distracting all her friends by using her fashionable personality . The episode was written by Jane O 'Brien and directed by Dominic Polcino . 
 = = Plot = = 
 After going back @-@ to @-@ school shopping , Homer learns from Apu that he can sell grease to make a profit . At breakfast , Homer begins frying up various amounts of bacon to use the grease to make money and decides to have Bart help him with his " grease business " which forces Bart to quit school . Meanwhile , on the first day back at school , Lisa volunteers to help Alex Whitney , a fashion conscious new student , by showing her around the school . To help her make new friends , Lisa takes Alex , Sherri , Terri , Allison Taylor and Janey for lunch in the cafeteria after the two groups meet up , but shortly after abandon Lisa after seeing that Alex has adult items like a cell phone , a purse and perfume . 
 Homer and Bart begin their grease business and make sixty @-@ three cents worth of grease from twenty @-@ seven dollars ' worth of bacon , much to Homer 's glee and Bart 's disappointment . After Bart points out that they need larger amounts of grease , the pair drive to Krusty Burger , where they attempt steal grease from the fryers . After loading it into Marge 's car , two employees of The Acne Grease and Shovel Company steal it , claiming they control the grease and shoveling business in the city . 
 Alex convinces Principal Skinner to have a school @-@ dance rather than the regular yearly event of apple picking . Skinner agrees , so Alex and Lisa , accompanied by Sherri , Terri , Janey and Allison visit the mall to purchase party supplies , but the girls detour and begin trying on outfits for the dance , despite Lisa 's protests . The group leave the mall , none speaking to each other . Lisa decides not to attend the dance , but changes her mind and goes to the school to take tickets at the door , but later arrives and discovers the boys and girls are standing on different sides of the room , and explains to Alex that it is like this because they are only children , not adults . 
 Homer and Bart arrive at the school during the school @-@ dance to steal the grease in the school 's kitchen which Bart told him about . They sneak into the kitchen and plants a hose in the fryer to suck it in to the car , but Willie spots them and attempts to stop them , claiming the grease to be his retirement plan . Homer tries to escape , but Willie grabs his legs and strangles him with the hose sucking the grease , which explodes due to the increased pressure , causing the grease to flood into the dance hall . A grease fight begins among the students , where Alex eventually joins in after being told by Lisa to act her own age . 
 = = Production = = 
 The origins of the episode come from a conversation between Jane O 'Brien and Mike Scully , when the two were talking about how girls always want to grow up so fast , as Scully has five daughters ; so they decided to produce an episode with a storyline based on this . The idea behind the episode plot came from Jace Richdale , who came up with the idea of Homer stealing grease and the grease business , having read about in a magazine . Several aspects of the characters used throughout the episode had been improvised significantly by Lisa Kudrow . Ron Hauge , a writer for The Simpsons , came up with the initial character of Alex , and Jane O 'Brien named the character after her best friend . The scene showing Homer 's hemorrhaged eye as Groundskeeper Willie strangles him got a big laugh in the studio . Mike Scully comments that he now uses it in college clip shows .

 The title of the episode is a play on the hymn and later Irish musical Lord of the Dance . Marge sings her own , altered version of 1990 song " Gonna Make You Sweat ( Everybody Dance Now ) " when attempting to persuade Lisa to attend the dance . Much of the shop where the girls enter to buy clothes is based on Wet Seal . In the same mall is a party supply store , called Donner 's Party Supplies which has a window sign saying " Winter Madness Sale " , a reference to the Donner Party . Alex tells Lisa to not be " such a Phoebe " , a reference to Lisa Kudrow 's character Phoebe Buffay on the series Friends .

 " Lard of the Dance " finished 31st in the weekly ratings for the week of August 17 – 23 , 1998 with a Nielsen rating of 7 @.@ 2 . It was the third highest rated show from the Fox Network that week . The episode aired during the summer so that it could serve as a lead @-@ in for the early premieres of That ' 70s Show and Holding the Baby . While That ' 70s Show would receive higher Nielsen ratings than The Simpsons , Holding the Baby was a ratings flop . 
 In a 2008 article , Entertainment Weekly named Lisa Kudrow 's role as Alex as one of the sixteen great guest appearances on The Simpsons . Lisa Kudrow refers to her self in the episode , stating " Your name 's Lisa ? Shut up , I love that name ! " The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood commented that " The idea of Lisa being unpopular in the light of a new girl in the school hallways is not new ( see " Lisa 's Rival " ) but it is done here with such class , " concluding of Homer 's treatment that " this is an episode which shows that even he can find interesting ways to do things . " Wesley Mead noted , in a review of the tenth season that the episode " might deal with familiar territory ( " Lisa 's Rival " , anyone ? ) , but it doesn 't feel like a retread , and is also home to a superbly realised subplot that sees Homer and Bart go into the grease business . " 
 In 2012 , The New York Times highlighted this episode in an article about grease theft from restaurants : " An episode of The Simpsons from 1998 has Homer Simpson trying to make a quick buck selling grease , but for years , law enforcement authorities seemed unaware that fryer oil was being stolen by unlicensed haulers , causing millions of dollars ' worth of losses each year for the rendering industry that collects and processes the grease .

 = Andranik = 
 Andranik Ozanian , commonly known as Andranik ( Armenian : <unk> ; 25 February 1865 – 31 August 1927 ) was an Armenian military commander and statesman , the best known fedayi and a key figure of the Armenian national liberation movement . He became active in an armed struggle against the Ottoman government and Kurdish irregulars in the late 1880s . He joined the Armenian Revolutionary Federation ( <unk> ) party and , along with other fedayi ( militias ) , sought to defend the Armenian peasantry living in their ancestral homeland , an area known as Turkish ( or Western ) Armenia — at the time part of the Ottoman Empire . His revolutionary activities ceased and he left the Ottoman Empire after the unsuccessful uprising in Sasun in 1904 . In 1907 , Andranik left <unk> because he disapproved of its cooperation with the Young Turks , a party which years later perpetrated the Armenian Genocide . Between 1912 and 1913 , together with Garegin Nzhdeh , Andranik led a few hundred Armenian volunteers within the Bulgarian army against the Ottomans during the First Balkan War . 
 From the early stages of World War I , Andranik commanded the first Armenian volunteer battalion and led them within the Russian Imperial army against the Ottoman Empire . After the Revolution of 1917 , the Russian army retreated and left the Armenian irregulars outnumbered against the Turks . Andranik led the defense of Erzurum in early 1918 , but was forced to retreat eastward . By May 1918 , Turkish forces stood near Yerevan — the future Armenian capital . The Dashnak @-@ dominated Armenian National Council declared the independence of Armenia and signed the Treaty of Batum with the Ottoman Empire , by which Armenia gave up its rights to Western Armenia . Andranik never accepted the existence of the First Republic of Armenia because it included only a small part of the area many Armenians hoped to make independent . Andranik , independently from the Republic of Armenia , fought in Zangezur against the Azerbaijani and Turkish armies and helped to keep it within Armenia . 
 Andranik left Armenia in 1919 due to disagreements with the Armenian government and spent his last years of life in Europe and the United States seeking relief for Armenian refugees . He settled in Fresno , California in 1922 and died five years later in 1927 . Andranik is greatly admired as a national hero by Armenians ; numerous statues of him have been erected in several countries . Streets and squares were named after Andranik , and songs , poems and novels have been written about him , making him a legendary figure in Armenian culture . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Andranik Ozanian was born on 25 February 1865 , in Shabin @-@ Karahisar , Sivas Vilayet , Ottoman Empire — today in Turkey 's <unk> Province — to Mariam and Toros Ozanian . Andranik means " firstborn " in Armenian . His paternal ancestors came from the nearby <unk> village in the early 18th century and settled in Shabin @-@ Karahisar to avoid persecution from the Turks . His ancestors took the surname Ozanian in honor of their hometown . Andranik 's mother died when he was one year old and his elder sister <unk> took care of him . Andranik went to the local <unk> School from 1875 to 1882 and thereafter worked in his father 's carpentry shop . He married at the age of 17 , but his wife died a year later while giving birth to their son — who also died days after the birth . 
 The situation of the Armenians in the Ottoman Empire had worsened under the reign of Abdul Hamid II , who sought to unify all Muslims under his rule . In 1882 , Andranik was arrested for assaulting a Turkish gendarme for mistreating Armenians . With the help of his friends , he escaped from prison . He settled in the Ottoman capital Constantinople in 1884 and stayed there until 1886 , working as a carpenter . He began his revolutionary activities in 1888 in the province of Sivas . Andranik joined the <unk> party in 1891 . He was arrested in 1892 for taking part in the assassination of Constantinople 's police chief , <unk> Mehmet Bey — known for his anti @-@ <unk> — on 9 February . Andranik once again escaped from prison . In 1892 , he joined the newly created Armenian Revolutionary Federation ( ARF or Dashnaktsutyun ) . During the Hamidian massacres , Andranik with other fedayi defended the Armenian villages of Mush and Sasun from attacks of the Turks and the Kurdish Hamidiye units . The massacres , which occurred between 1894 and 1896 and are named after Sultan Abdul Hamid II , killed between 80 @,@ 000 and 300 @,@ 000 people . 
 In 1897 , Andranik went to Tiflis — the largest city of the Caucasus and a major center of Armenian culture at the time — where the ARF headquarters was located . Andranik returned to Turkish Armenia " entrusted with extensive powers , and with a large supply of arms " for the fedayi . Several dozen Russian Armenians joined him , with whom he went to the Mush @-@ Sasun area where <unk> Serob was operating . Serob 's forces had already established semi @-@ independent Armenian areas by expelling the Ottoman government representatives . 
 = = Leader of the fedayi = = 
 <unk> Serob , the main leader of the fedayi in the 1890s , was killed in 1899 by a Kurdish chieftain , <unk> Khalil Bey . Months later , Bey committed further atrocities against the Armenians by killing a priest , two young men and 25 women and children in Sasun 's village of <unk> . Andranik replaced Serob as the head of the Armenian irregular forces " with 38 villages under his command " in the Mush @-@ Sasun region of Western Armenia , where a " warlike semi @-@ independent Armenian peasantry " lived . Andranik sought to kill Bey ; he captured and reportedly decapitated the chieftain , and took the medal given to Bey by Sultan Abdul Hamid II . Andranik thus earned an undisputed authority among his fedayi . 
 Although small groups of Armenian fedayi conducted an armed struggle against the Ottoman state and the Kurdish tribes , the situation in Turkish Armenia deteriorated as the European powers stood indifferent to the Armenian Question . Article 61 of the 1878 Treaty of Berlin intended the Ottoman government to " carry out , without further delay , the improvements and reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces inhabited by the Armenians , and to guarantee their security against the Circassians and Kurds " remained unimplemented . According to Christopher J. Walker , the attention of the European powers was on Macedonia , while Russia was " in no mood for reactivating the Armenian question " . 
 = = = Battle of Holy Apostles Monastery = = = 
 In November 1901 the fedayi clashed with the Ottoman troops in what later became known as the Battle of Holy Apostles Monastery . One of the best @-@ known episodes of Andranik 's revolutionary activities , it was an attempt by the Ottoman government to suppress his activities . Since Andranik had gained more influence over the region , more than 5 @,@ 000 Turkish soldiers were sent after him and his band . The Turks chased and eventually circled him and his men , numbering around 50 , at the <unk> ( Holy Apostles ) Monastery in early November . A regiment under the command of <unk> Pasha and Ali Pasha besieged the fort @-@ like monastery . The Turkish generals leading the army of twelve hundred men asked the fedayi to negotiate their surrender . 
 After weeks of resistance and negotiations — in which Armenian clergy and the headman of Mush and foreign consuls took part — Andranik and his companions left the monastery and fled in small groups . According to Leon Trotsky , Andranik — dressed in the uniform of a Turkish officer — " went the rounds of the entire guard , talking to them in excellent Turkish " , and " at the same time showing the way out to his own men . " After breaking through the siege of the monastery , Andranik gained legendary stature among provincial Armenians . He became so popular that the men he led came to refer to him always by his first name . Andranik intended to attract the attention of the foreign consuls at Mush to the plight of the Armenian peasants and to provide hope for the oppressed Armenians of the eastern provinces . According to Trotsky , Andranik 's " political thinking took shape in a setting of <unk> activity and diplomatic intrigue . " 
 = = = 1904 Sasun uprising and exodus = = = 
 In 1903 , Andranik demanded the Ottoman government stop the harassment of Armenians and implement the reforms in the Armenian provinces . Most fedayi were concentrated in mountainous Sasun , an area of about 12 @,@ 000 km2 ( 4 @,@ 600 sq mi ) with an overwhelming Armenian majority — 1 @,@ 769 Armenian and 155 Kurdish households — which was traditionally considered their main operational area . The region was in " a state of revolutionary turmoil " because the local Armenians had refused to pay taxes for the past seven years . Andranik and tens of other fedayi — including Hrayr and <unk> — held a meeting at <unk> village in the third quarter of 1903 to manage the future defense of the Armenian villages from possible Turkish and Kurdish attacks . Andranik suggested a widespread uprising of the Armenians of Taron and Vaspurakan ; Hrayr opposed his view and suggested a small , local uprising in Sasun , because the Armenian irregulars lacked resources . Hrayr 's suggestion was eventually approved by the fedayi meeting . Andranik was chosen as the main commander of the uprising . 
 The first clashes took place in January 1904 between the fedayi and Kurdish irregulars supported by the Ottoman government . The Turkish offensive started in early April with an estimated 10 @,@ 000 to 20 @,@ 000 soldiers and 7 @,@ 000 Kurdish irregulars put against 100 to 200 Armenian fedayi and 700 to 1 @,@ 000 local Armenian men . Hrayr was killed during the intense fighting ; Andranik survived and resumed the fight . Between 7 @,@ 000 and 10 @,@ 000 Armenian civilians were killed during the two months of the uprising , while about 9 @,@ 000 were left homeless . Around 4 @,@ 000 Sasun villagers were forced into exile after the uprising . 
 After weeks of fighting and cannon bombardment of the Armenian villages , the Ottoman forces and Kurdish irregulars suppressed the uprising by May 1904 ; they outnumbered the Armenian forces several times . Minor clashes occurred thereafter . According to Christopher J. Walker , the fedayi came " near to organising an uprising and shaking Ottoman power in Armenia " , but " even then it was unthinkable that the empire would lose any of her territory , since the idea of intervention was far from Russia " . Trotsky wrote that international attention was on the Russo @-@ Japanese War and the uprising went largely unnoticed by the European powers and Russia . 
 In July – August 1904 , Andranik and his fedayi reached Lake Van and got to Aghtamar Island with sailing ships . They escaped to Persia via Van in September 1904 , " leaving little more than a heroic memory . " Trotsky states that they were forced to leave Turkish Armenia to avoid further killings of Armenians and to lower the tensions , while <unk> <unk> wrote that Andranik left the Ottoman Empire because he sought to " gather new resources and find practical programs " for the Armenian struggle . 
 = = Immigration and conflict with the ARF = = 
 From Persia , Andranik moved to the Caucasus , where he met the Armenian leaders in Baku and Tiflis . He then left Russia and traveled to Europe , where he was engaged in advocacy in support of the Armenians ' national liberation struggle . In 1906 in Geneva , he published a book on military tactics . Most of the work was about his activities and the strategies he used during the 1904 Sasun uprising . 
 In February – March 1907 , Andranik went to Vienna to participate in the fourth ARF Congress . The ARF , which had been associating with Turkish immigrant political groups in Europe since 1902 , discussed and approved the negotiations with the Young Turks — who later perpetrated the Armenian Genocide — to overthrow Sultan Abdul Hamid II . Andranik strongly denounced this cooperation and left the party . In 1908 , the ARF asked Andranik to move to Constantinople and nominate his candidacy in the Ottoman parliament election , but he declined the offer , saying " I don 't want to sit there and do nothing " . Andranik distanced himself from active political and military affairs for several years . 
 = = = First Balkan War = = = 
 In 1907 Andranik settled in Sofia , where he met the leaders of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization — including revolutionary Boris <unk> — and the two pledged to work jointly for the oppressed peoples of Armenia and Macedonia . During the First Balkan War ( 1912 – 13 ) , Andranik led a company of 230 Armenian volunteers — part of the Macedonian @-@ <unk> Volunteer Corps of Aleksandar <unk> within the Bulgarian army — against the Ottoman Empire . He shared the command with Garegin Nzhdeh . On the opposite side , approximately 8 @,@ 000 Armenians fought for the Ottoman Empire . Andranik was given the rank of a first lieutenant by the Bulgarian government . He distinguished himself in several battles , including in the Battle of <unk> , when he helped the Bulgarians to capture Turkish commander <unk> Pasha . Andranik was honored with the Order of Bravery by General <unk> in 1913 . However , Andranik disbanded his men in May 1913 , and foreseeing the war between Bulgaria and Serbia he " retired to a village near Varna , and lived as a farmer until August 1914 " . 
 = = World War I = = 
 With the outbreak of World War I in July 1914 between Russia , France and Britain on one side and Germany , the Ottoman Empire and Austria on the other , Andranik left Bulgaria for Russia . He was appointed the commander of the first Armenian volunteer battalion by the Russian government . From November 1914 to August 1915 , Andranik took part in the Caucasus Campaign as the head commander of the first Armenian battalion of about 1 @,@ 200 volunteers within the Imperial Russian Army . Andranik 's battalion particularly stood out at the Battle of Dilman in April 1915 . By the victory at Dilman , the Russian and Armenian forces under the command of General <unk> , effectively stopped the Turks from invading the Caucasus via Iranian Azerbaijan . 
 Through 1915 , the Armenian Genocide was underway in the Ottoman Empire . By the end of the war , virtually all Armenians living in their ancestral homeland were either dead or forced into exile by the Ottoman government . An estimated 1 @.@ 5 million Armenians died in the process , ending two thousand years of Armenian presence in Western Armenia . The only major resistance to the Turkish atrocities took place in Van . The Turkish army besieged the city but the local Armenians , under the leadership of Aram Manukian , kept them out until the Armenian volunteers reached Van , forcing the Turks to retreat . Andranik with his unit entered Van on 19 May 1915 . Andranik subsequently helped the Russian army to take control of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> on the southern shore of Lake Van . During the summer of 1915 , the Armenian volunteer units disintegrated and Andranik went to Tiflis to recruit more volunteers and continued the combat from November 1915 until March 1916 . With Andranik 's support , the city of Mush was captured by Russians in February 1916 . In recognition of lieutenant general Theodore G. Chernozubov , the successes of Russian army in numerous locations were significantly associated with the fighting of the first Armenian battalion , headed by Andranik . Chernozubov praised Andranik as a brave and experienced chief , who well understood the combat situation ; Chernozubov described him as always at the head of militia , enjoying great prestige among the volunteers . 
 The situation drastically changed in 1916 when the Russian government ordered the Armenian volunteer units to be demobilized and prohibited any Armenian civic activity . Andranik resigned as the commander of the first Armenian battalion . Despite the earlier Russian promises , their plan for the region was to make Turkish Armenia an integral part of Russia and " possibly repopulate by Russian peasants and Cossacks " . Richard Hovannisian wrote that because the " Russian armies were in firm control of most of the Armenian plateau by the summer of 1916 , there was no longer any need to expend niceties upon the Armenians " . According to <unk> <unk> , Russia used the Armenian volunteers for its own interests . Andranik and other Armenian volunteers , disappointed by the Russian policy , left the front in July 1916 . 
 = = = Russian Revolution and Turkish reoccupation = = = 
 The February Revolution was positively accepted by the Armenians because it ended the autocratic rule of Nicholas II . The Special Transcaucasian Committee ( known as <unk> ) was set up in the South Caucasus by the Russian Provisional Government . In April 1917 , Andranik initiated the publication of the newspaper Hayastan ( Armenia ) in Tiflis . Vahan <unk> became the editor of this non @-@ partisan , Turkish Armenian @-@ orientated newspaper . Until December 1917 , Andranik remained in the South Caucasus where he sought to help the Armenian refugees from the Ottoman Empire in their search for basic needs . The provisional government decree of 9 May 1917 put Turkish Armenia under civil administration , with Armenians holding key positions . About 150 @,@ 000 local Armenians began to rebuild devastated Turkish Armenia ; however the Russian army units gradually disintegrated and many soldiers deserted and returned to Russia . 
 After the 1917 October Revolution , the chaotic retreat of Russian troops from Turkish Armenia escalated . Bolshevik Russia and the Ottoman Empire signed the Armistice of Erzincan on 5 December 1917 , ending the hostilities . The Soviet Russian government formally acknowledged the right of self @-@ determination of the Turkish Armenians in January 1918 , but on 3 March 1918 , Russia signed the Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk with the Central Powers , ceding Turkish Armenia and large areas in Eastern Europe to concentrate its forces against the Whites in the Russian Civil War . 
 In December 1917 , because the Russian divisions were deserting the region en masse , the Russian command authorized the formation of the Armenian Army Corps under the Transcaucasian Commissariat . Under the command of General <unk> , the Corps was positioned in the front line from Van to Erzincan — a city of around about 20 @,@ 000 people . Two of the Corps ' three divisions were made up of Russian Armenians , while Andranik commanded the Turkish ( Western ) Armenian division . The Georgian forces patrolled the area between Erzincan and the Black Sea . Hovannisian states that the only " several thousand men now defended a 300 @-@ mile front formerly secured by a half million Russian regulars " . Since December 1917 , Andranik commanded the Armenian forces in Erzurum . In January 1918 , he was appointed commander of the Western Armenian division of the Armenian Army Corps and given the rank of major @-@ general by the Caucasus Front command . Andranik was unable to defend Erzurum for long and the outnumbering Turks captured the city on 12 March 1918 , forcing the Armenians to evacuate . 
 While the Transcaucasian delegation and the Turks were holding a conference in Trebizond , through March and April the Turkish forces , according to Walker , " overran the temporary establishment of Armenian rule in Turkish Armenia , extinguishing the hope so recently raised " . Hovannisian wrote , " the battle for Turkish Armenia had been quickly decided ; the struggle for Russian Armenia was now at hand " . After the Turks captured Erzurum , the largest city in Turkish Armenia , Andranik retreated through Kars , passed through Alexandropol and <unk> , and arrived in <unk> by 18 May . By early April 1918 , the Turkish forces had reached the pre @-@ war international borders . Andranik and his unit in <unk> were not able to take part in the battles of Sardarabad , Abaran and <unk> . 
 = = First Republic of Armenia = = 
 Since the Ottoman forces were effectively stopped at Sardarabad , the Armenian National Council declared the independence of the Russian Armenian lands on 28 May 1918 . Andranik condemned this move and denounced the Armenian Revolutionary Federation . Angry with the Dashnaks , he favored good relations with Bolshevik Russia instead . Andranik refused to acknowledge the Republic of Armenia because according to the Treaty of Batum it " was only a dusty province without Turkish Armenia whose salvation Armenians had been seeking for 40 years . " In early June , Andranik departed from <unk> with thousands of refugees ; they traveled through <unk> , Nor <unk> and <unk> , and arrived in Nakhichevan on 17 June . He subsequently tried to help the Armenian refugees from Van at Khoy , Iran . He sought to join the British forces in northern Iran , but after encountering a large number of Turkish soldiers he retreated to Nakhichevan . On 14 July 1918 , he proclaimed Nakhichevan an integral part of Russia . His move was welcomed by Armenian Bolshevik Stepan Shahumyan and Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin . 
 = = = Zangezur = = = 
 As the Turkish forces moved towards Nakhichevan , Andranik with his Armenian Special Striking Division moved to the mountainous region of Zangezur to set up a defense . By mid @-@ 1918 , the relations between the Armenians and Azeris in Zangezur had deteriorated . Andranik arrived in Zangezur at a critical moment with around 30 @,@ 000 refugees and an estimated force of between 3 @,@ 000 and 5 @,@ 000 men . He established effective control of the region by September . The role of Zangezur was crucial because it was a connection point between Turkey and Azerbaijan . Under Andranik , the region became one of the last centers of Armenian resistance after the Treaty of Batum . 
 Andranik 's irregulars remained in Zangezur surrounded by Muslim villages that controlled the key routes connecting the different parts of Zangezur . According to Donald Bloxham , Andranik initiated the change of Zangezur into a solidly Armenian land by destroying Muslim villages and trying to ethnically <unk> key areas of the Armenian state . In late 1918 , Azerbaijan accused Andranik of killing innocent Azerbaijani peasants in Zangezur and demanded that he withdraw Armenian units from the area . <unk> <unk> wrote that , " Without the presence of General Andranik and his Special Striking Division , what is now the Zangezur district of Armenia would be party of Azerbaijan today . Without General Andranik and his men , only a miracle could have saved the sixty thousand Armenian inhabitants of the Zangezur district from complete annihilation by the Turko @-@ Tatar forces in the fall of 1918 " ; he further stated that Andranik " did not massacre peaceful Tatars " . Andranik 's activities in Zangezur were protested by Ottoman general Halil Pasha , who threatened the Dashnak government with retaliation for Andranik 's actions . Armenia 's Prime Minister Hovhannes <unk> said he had no control over Andranik and his forces . 
 = = = Karabakh = = = 
 The Ottoman Empire was officially defeated in the First World War and the Armistice of Mudros was signed on 30 October 1918 . The Ottoman forces evacuated Karabakh in November 1918 and by the end of October of that year , Andranik 's forces were concentrated between Zangezur and Karabakh . Before moving towards Karabakh , Andranik made sure that the local Armenians would support him in fighting the Azeris . In mid @-@ November 1918 , he received letters from Karabakh Armenian officials asking him to postpone the offensive for 10 days ton allow negotiations with the Muslims of the region . According to Hovannisian , " the time lost proved crucial " . In late November , Andranik 's forces headed towards Shusha — the main city of Karabakh and a major Armenian cultural center . After an intense fight against the Kurds , his forces broke through <unk> and the surrounding villages . 
 By early December , Andranik was 40 km ( 25 mi ) away from Shusha when he received a message from British General W. M. Thomson in Baku , suggesting that he retreat from Karabakh because the World War was over and any further Armenian military activity would adversely affect the solution of the Armenian question , which was soon to be considered by the 1919 peace conference in Paris . Trusting the British , Andranik returned to Zangezur . 
 The region was left under limited control of the Armenian Karabakh Council . The British mission under command of Thomson arrived in Karabakh in December 1918 . Thomson insisted the council " act only in local , nonpolitical matters " , which sparked discontent among the Armenians . An " ardent pan @-@ <unk> " <unk> bey <unk> was soon appointed the governor of Karabakh and Zangezur by Thomson to " squash any unrest in the region " . Christopher J. Walker wrote that " [ Karabakh ] with its large Armenian majority remained Azerbaijani throughout the pre @-@ Soviet and Soviet period " because of " Andranik 's trust of the word of a British officer " . 
 = = = Departure = = = 
 During the winter of 1918 – 19 , Zangezur was isolated from Karabakh and Yerevan by snow . The refugees intensified the famine and epidemic conditions and gave way to inflation . In December 1918 , Andranik withdrew from Karabakh to Goris . On his way , he met with British officers who suggested the Armenian units stay in Zangezur for the winter . Andranik agreed to such a proposal and on 23 December 1918 , a group of Armenian leaders met in a conference and concluded that Zangezur could not cope with the influx of refugees until spring . They agreed that the first logical step in relieving the tension was the reparation of more than 15 @,@ 000 refugees from Nakhichevan — the adjoining district that had been evacuated by the Ottoman armies . Andranik and the conference called upon the British to provide for the refugees in the interim . Major W. D. Gibbon arrived with limited supplies and money donated by the Armenians of Baku , but this was not enough to support the refugees . 
 At the end of February 1919 , Andranik was ready to leave Zangezur . Gibbon suggested Andranik and his soldiers leave by Baku @-@ Tiflis railway at Yevlakh station . Andranik rejected this plan and on 22 March 1919 , he left Goris and traveled across <unk> through deep snowdrifts to <unk> , then moved to the Ararat plain with his few thousand irregulars . After a three @-@ week march , his men and horses reached the railway station of <unk> . He was met by Dro , the Assistant Minister of Military Affairs and Sargis <unk> , the Assistant Minister of Internal Affairs , who offered to take him to visit Yerevan , but he rejected their invitation as he believed the Dashnak government had betrayed the Armenians and was responsible for the loss of his homeland and the annihilation of his people . Zangezur became more vulnerable to Azerbaijani threats after Andranik left the district . Earlier , before Andranik 's and his soldiers ' dismissal , the local Armenian forces had requested support from Yerevan . 
 On 13 April 1919 , Andranik reached Etchmiadzin , the seat of Catholicos of All Armenians and the religious center of the Armenians , who helped the troops prepare for disbanding . His 5 @,@ 000 @-@ strong division had dwindled to 1 @,@ 350 soldiers . As a result of Andranik 's disagreements with the Dashnak government and the diplomatic machinations of the British in the Caucasus , Andranik disbanded his division and handed his belongings and weapons to the Catholicos George V. On 27 April 1919 , he left Etchmiadzin accompanied by 15 officers , and went to Tiflis on a special train ; according to Blackwood , " news of his journey traveled before him . At every station crowds were waiting to get a glimpse of their national hero . " He left Armenia for the last time ; in Tiflis he met with Georgia 's Foreign Minister Evgeni <unk> and discussed the Georgian – Armenian War with translation of Hovhannes Tumanyan . 
 = = Last years = = 
 From 1919 to 1922 , Andranik traveled around Europe and the United States seeking support for the Armenian refugees . He visited Paris and London , where he tried to persuade the Allied powers to occupy Turkish Armenia . In 1919 , during his visit to France , Andranik was bestowed the title of Legion of Honor Officier by President Raymond Poincaré . In late 1919 , Andranik led a delegation to the United States to lobby its support for a mandate for Armenia and fund @-@ raising for the Armenian army . He was accompanied by General Jaques Bagratuni and Hovhannes <unk> . In Fresno , he directed a campaign which raised US $ 500 @,@ 000 for the relief of Armenian war refugees . 
 When he returned to Europe , Andranik married <unk> Kurkjian in Paris on 15 May 1922 ; <unk> Nubar was their best man . Andranik and <unk> moved to the United States and settled in Fresno , California in 1922 . In his 1936 short story , <unk> of Armenia , Armenian @-@ American writer William Saroyan described Andranik 's arrival . He wrote , " It looked as if all Armenians of California were at the Southern Pacific depot at the day he arrived . " He said Andranik " was a man of about fifty in a neat Armenians suit of clothes . He was a little under six feet tall , very solid and very strong . He had an old @-@ style Armenian mustache that was white . The expression of his face was both ferocious and kind . " In his novel Call of the <unk> ( 1979 ) , <unk> <unk> describes Andranik 's life in Fresno ; he changed Andranik 's name to Shapinand : 
 After clashing with the leaders of the <unk> Republic and leaving Armenia , Shapinand settled in the city of Fresno , California . The basement of his house was converted into a hotel . His sword , the Mosin – Nagant rifle and his military uniform hung from the wall . This is also where he kept his horse , which he had brought to America on a steamship . Those weapons , that uniform , the grey <unk> , the black boots , and lion @-@ like steed – this was the personal wealth he had come to possess throughout his life . His business no longer had to do with weapons . Shapinand spent his free time making small wooden chairs in his hotel . Many people , refusing to buy the quality American armchairs , bought his simple ones , some for use , others as souvenirs . 
 = = Death = = 
 In February 1926 , Andranik left Fresno to reside in San Francisco in an unsuccessful attempt to regain his health . According to his death certificate found in the Butte County , California records , Andranik died from angina on 31 August 1927 at Richardson Springs , California . On 7 September 1927 , city @-@ wide public attention was accorded to him for his funeral in the Ararat Cemetery , Fresno . The New York Times reported that more than 2 @,@ 500 members of the Armenian community attended memorial services in Carnegie Hall , New York City . 
 He was initially buried at Ararat Cemetery in Fresno . After his first funeral , it was planned to take Andranik 's remains to Armenia for final burial ; however , when they arrived in France , the Soviet authorities refused permission to allow his remains to enter Soviet Armenia . Instead they remained in France and , after a second funeral service held in the Paris Armenian church , were buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris on 29 January 1928 . In early 2000 , the Armenian and French governments arranged the transfer of Andranik 's body from Paris to Yerevan . <unk> wrote that the transfer was initiated by Armenia 's Prime Minister Vazgen Sargsyan . Andranik 's body was moved to Armenia on 17 February 2000 . It was placed in the Sport & Concert Complex in Yerevan for two days and was then taken to Etchmiadzin Cathedral , where Karekin II officiated the funeral service . Andranik was re @-@ interred at Yerablur military cemetery in Yerevan on 20 February 2000 , next to Vazgen Sargsyan . In his speech during the reburial ceremony , Armenia 's President Robert Kocharyan described Andranik as " one of the greatest sons of the Armenian nation " . Prime Minister Aram Sargsyan , Foreign Minister Vartan <unk> , and one of Andranik 's soldiers , 102 @-@ year @-@ old Grigor <unk> , were also in attendance . A memorial was built on his grave with the phrase " <unk> Hayots " — " General of the Armenians " — engraved on it .

 = = = Public image = = = 
 Andranik was considered a hero during his lifetime . The Literary Digest , an influential American newspaper , described Andranik in 1920 as " the Armenian 's Robin Hood , Garibaldi , and Washington , all in one " . The same year , The Independent wrote that he is " worshiped by his countrymen for his heroic fighting in their defense against the Turks " . In a letter to Andranik , the noted Armenian writer Hovhannes Tumanyan praised him , while Bolshevik and Soviet statesman of Armenian origin Anastas Mikoyan wrote in his memoirs that " the name Andranik was surrounded by halo of glory " . 
 Andranik is considered a national hero by Armenians worldwide . He is also seen as a legendary figure in Armenian culture . Five surveys conducted by Gallup , Inc . , International Republican Institute and the Armenian Sociological Association from 2006 to 2008 asked , " [ o ] f the prominent Armenian people and characters in Armenian history and folk culture , who is most suitable to be a national hero or leader at the present time ? " . Andranik was placed second after Vazgen Sargsyan ; 9 – 18 % of the respondents giving Andranik 's name . Andranik 's activities have also attracted some criticism ; for instance writer Ruben <unk> ( hy ) stated that Andranik " doesn 't have the right " to have a statue in Yerevan , because he did not do " anything real " for the First Republic and he left Armenia . <unk> wrote that Andranik is a popular hero ; however , he finds the term " national hero " in describing him unacceptable . 
 Andranik is generally seen as a pro @-@ Russian / Soviet figure . During the Soviet period , his legacy and those of other Armenian national heroes were diminished and " any reference to them would be dangerous since they represented the strive for independence " , especially prior to the Khrushchev Thaw . Paruyr Sevak , a prominent Soviet Armenian author , wrote an essay about Andranik in 1963 after reading one of his soldier 's notes . Sevak wrote that his generation knew " little about Andranik , almost nothing . " He continued , " knowing nothing about Andranik means to know nothing about modern Armenian history . " In 1965 , Andranik 's 100th anniversary was celebrated in Soviet Armenia . 
 = = = Memorials = = = 
 Statues and memorials of Andranik have been erected around the world , including in Bucharest , Romania ( 1936 ) , Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris ( 1945 ) , Melkonian Educational Institute , Nicosia , Cyprus ( 1990 ) , Le Plessis @-@ Robinson , Paris ( 2005 ) , Varna , Bulgaria ( 2011 ) , and Armavir , Russia . A memorial exists in Richardson Springs , California , where Andranik died . In May 2011 , a statue of Andranik was erected in <unk> village near Sochi , Russia ; however , it was removed the same day , apparently under pressure from Turkey , which earlier announced that they would boycott the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics if the statue remained standing . 
 The first statue of Andranik in Armenia was erected in 1967 in the village of <unk> . More statues have been erected after Armenia 's independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 ; three of which can be found in <unk> @-@ Sebastia district ( 2000 ) , near the St. Gregory Cathedral ( by Ara Shiraz , 2002 ) and outside the <unk> Movement Museum ( 2006 ) in the Armenian capital Yerevan . Also in Armenia , Andranik 's statues stand in <unk> and <unk> villages of Tavush , in Gyumri 's Victory Park ( 1994 ) , <unk> , <unk> , and others . 
 Numerous streets and squares both inside and outside Armenia , including in Córdoba , Argentina , Plovdiv and Varna in Bulgaria , Meudon , Paris and a section of Connecticut Route 314 state highway running entirely within Wethersfield , Connecticut are named after Andranik . General Andranik Station of the Yerevan Metro was opened in 1989 as <unk> Station and was renamed for Andranik in 1992 . In 1995 , General Andranik 's Museum was founded in Komitas Park of Yerevan , but was soon closed because the building was privatized . It was reopened on 16 September 2006 , by Ilyich <unk> as the Museum of Armenian <unk> Movement , named after Andranik . 
 According to Patrick Wilson , during the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh War Andranik " inspired a new generation of Armenians " . A volunteer regiment from Masis named " General Andranik " operated in Armenia and Nagorno @-@ Karabakh during the conflict . 
 Many organizations and groups in the Armenian diaspora are named after Andranik . On 11 September 2012 , during the Bulgaria vs. Armenia football match in Sofia 's Levski National Stadium , Armenian fans brought a giant poster with pictures of General Andranik and Armenian officer Gurgen Margaryan , who was murdered in 2004 by Azeri lieutenant Ramil Safarov . The text on the poster read , " Andranik 's children are also heroes ... The work will be done " . 
 The manuscripts of General Andranik , 65 pages long and the only known memoir of General Andranik written by him , were returned to Armenia in May 2014 . Andranik , while in the United Kingdom , had sent them to Paris in order to be published in 1921 , from where they had been sent to Beirut in the 1960s for safe keeping until the Lebanese Civil War , then moved to Greece , and again back to England from where the manuscripts were finally sent to the National History Museum in Yerevan through Culture Minister <unk> <unk> , almost a century after Andranik had parted with them . 
 = = = In culture = = = 
 Andranik has been figured prominently in the Armenian literature , sometimes as a fictional character . The Western Armenian writer <unk> wrote a poem entitled " Andranik " , which was published in Geneva in 1905 . The first book about Andranik was published during his lifetime . In 1920 , Vahan <unk> , under the pen name Arsen <unk> , published the book Gen. Andranik and his wars ( <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ) in the Entente @-@ occupied Constantinople . The famed Armenian @-@ American writer William Saroyan wrote a short story titled <unk> of Armenia , which was included in his collection of short stories Inhale and Exhale ( 1936 ) . Another US @-@ based Armenian writer <unk> 's novel The White Horseman ( <unk> <unk> , 1952 ) was based on Andranik and other fedayi . Hovhannes Shiraz , one of the most prominent Armenian poets of the 20th century , wrote at least two poems about Andranik ; one in 1963 and another in 1967 . The latter one , titled Statue to Andranik ( <unk> <unk> ) , was published in 1991 after Shiraz 's death . <unk> <unk> 's novel Andranik was suppressed for years and was published in 1989 when the tight Soviet control over publications was relaxed . Between the 1960s and the 1980s , author Suren <unk> collected folk stories and completed a novel , " Story about Andranik " ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) . It was first published in Yerevan in 2008 . 
 Andranik 's name has been memorialized in numerous songs . In 1913 , Leon Trotsky described Andranik as " a hero of song and legend " . Andranik is one of the main figures featured in Armenian patriotic songs , performed by <unk> <unk> , Harout <unk> and others . There are dozens of songs dedicated to him , including Like an Eagle by gusan <unk> , 1904 and Andranik pasha by gusan <unk> . Andranik also features in the popular song The <unk> of the Caucasus ( <unk> <unk> ) and other pieces of Armenian patriotic folklore . 
 Several documentaries about Andranik have been produced ; these include Andranik ( 1929 ) by <unk> @-@ Film in France , directed by <unk> <unk> , who also played the main role ; General Andranik ( 1990 ) directed by Levon <unk> , narrated by Khoren Abrahamyan ; and Andranik Ozanian , a 53 @-@ minute @-@ long documentary by the Public Television of Armenia .

 The Simpsons : Bart 's House of Weirdness is a platform video game published by Konami in 1992 for DOS . Developed by Distinctive Software , it is based on the Simpsons franchise and features many aspects from the series . In the game , the player controls Bart as he escapes from the Simpsons ' house after being grounded by his parents . On his adventures throughout town , Bart is equipped with various weapons that are used to fend off enemies and animals . Bart 's House of Weirdness does not have a wide fan base because it was only released for DOS , but the early reviews of the game were positive , at least in terms of graphics and sound . A 2009 1UP.com review heavily criticized the gameplay of the game . 
 = = Plot and gameplay = = 
 Bart 's House of Weirdness is an action @-@ adventure @-@ strategy platform game that uses single @-@ screen movement . The plot sees Bart grounded to his room by his parents Homer and Marge after having pulled one too many pranks . With nothing to do , he quickly gets bored and escapes from the home . He travels around town , and eventually heads to an amusement park where he has to save Krusty the Clown from his archenemy Sideshow Bob . 
 The game has six levels and a final battle . The player controls Bart as he helps his sister Maggie recover her ball , explores the basement and attic of the Simpsons ' home , sneaks out to the movie theater and the Springfield Mall , and has a dream in which he is inserted into the Itchy & Scratchy universe . During these levels , Bart fights dust bunnies , spiders ( in the attic ) , ghosts ( in the basement ) , space mutants ( at the movie theater ) , and Itchy and Scratchy ( in the dream world ) . 
 Bart is able to utilize a variety of weapons in the game , including a burp gun , a slingshot , spray paint , and water balloons . The player controls these weapons with either a keyboard or a joystick . The joystick control has two modes : one for shooting and one for jumping . Whenever the player misses one of the creatures and they are able to hit Bart , the life bar , called the " Cool @-@ O @-@ Meter " , drops . In order to regain Bart 's coolness , the player must find a cool item that he can use . When the player has completed all levels , Bart goes to the Krustyland amusement park to save Krusty from Bob .

 Bart 's House of Weirdness was developed by Distinctive Software and published by Konami . It was announced by Konami at the June 1991 International Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago . The game was released in 1992 solely for the DOS platform , and was available for both Color Graphics Adapter ( CGA ) and Enhanced Graphics Adapter ( EGA ) , but not Video Graphics Array ( VGA ) . Writers for UGO Networks have commented that the fact that Bart 's House of Weirdness was released exclusively for DOS " more than likely tells why its critical acclaim is <unk> and fan support non @-@ existent . It 's surprising it got such a limited release , seeing it was published by Konami , who usually have no problem distributing games on a variety of platforms . " Similarly , a 1UP.com editor wrote that the game is " mostly @-@ unknown ( there 's not even a single video of it on YouTube ) " and that it " deserves a little more coverage , if only to acknowledge its existence " . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The game was reviewed in 1992 in issue 179 of Dragon magazine by Hartley , Patricia , and Kirk Lesser in the " The Role of Computers " column . The reviewers gave the game five out of five stars , and commented that " Without a doubt , Bart 's House of Weirdness is one of the best arcade games we ’ ve played . It also happens to be one of Konami ’ s best products ! " They added that " With superb Roland sound ( the TV show theme and opening animations are quite good ) and smooth animation , our only wish is that Konami would consider releasing this fine arcade delight with full VGA support sometime in the future . If you like Bart and really enjoy arcade games , you have to get this one . " William Burrill of Toronto Star commented that " the graphics in House of Weirdness are sharp and colorful , and look much like the television show . Music from the real show is also included , along with digitized samples of Bart 's rather whining voice . " Computer Gaming World liked the graphics ' resemblance to the TV show , and concluded that " House of Weirdness stands up as well as any ' Super @-@ <unk> ' arcade game " . 
 In 2009 , eighteen years after Bart 's House of Weirdness was released , 1UP.com editor Bob Mackey reviewed the game in 1UP 's official Retro Gaming Blog . He praised the game for its graphics , but was critical of the gameplay . Mackey wrote that " the graphics are far more impressive than any other Simpsons title at the time , outside of the arcade brawler . In fact , the graphics alone were responsible for my childlike [ ... ] excitement over House of Weirdness ; [ ... ] they 're pretty lush — even if they 're not entirely faithful to the show . Bart 's PC translation might be just a little off @-@ model , but it 's a gigantic leap over his duck @-@ like visage seen on the NES . " He added , however , that the game " is completely unintuitive , your goals aren 't made clear , it 's never certain if you 're doing the right thing , and you 're often locked into screens with no apparent way out but death . " Mackey also criticized the levels ' structure that " seems more randomly @-@ generated than anything " and the fact that the " big , beautiful " sprites sometimes do not move well .

Commander William Riker ( Jonathan Frakes ) , Lt. Data ( Brent Spiner ) and Lt. Tasha Yar ( Denise Crosby ) beam down to the surface to investigate . Riker separates from the other two , and is met by the Drake 's captain who asks what ship he is from . Riker realizes that it is a trick when told that the only life signs detected are the away team and tells the " captain " that he is from the Lollipop and it 's a " good ship " . After being further questioned about the Lollipop 's armament , the " captain " disappears , revealing a floating sentry probe that fires a stasis field around Riker before Data and Yar can destroy it . 
 The stasis field around Riker prevents the Enterprise from beaming him up , so Captain Jean @-@ Luc Picard ( Patrick Stewart ) and Doctor Beverly Crusher ( Gates McFadden ) travel to the surface , and Lt. Geordi La Forge ( LeVar Burton ) is left in command of the Enterprise . Picard and Crusher meet with the away team , and as they attempt to free Riker , another sentry probe appears and fires on them . Picard and Crusher are separated from Data and Yar and fall into a hole , where Crusher is severely injured . Meanwhile , Data and Yar discover that the second probe is more powerful than the first and requires their combined power to destroy it . While Picard attempts to tend to Crusher 's injuries , Data manages to release Riker from the stasis field . Riker , Yar and Data are again attacked , with this new probe requiring all three of them to combine their phaser power to destroy it . Data deduces that each probe learns from the tactics used to destroy the prior probes and adapts to become stronger , and that the next probe might be unbeatable . 
 Meanwhile , the Enterprise is attacked by a cloaked ship . Each subsequent attack gets stronger and straining the ship 's shields . Chief Engineer Logan ( <unk> <unk> ) comes up to the bridge to demand that the Enterprise flee the planet and attempts to take command under the pretext that he has the higher rank . La Forge correctly states that the only people who can relieve him of command are Picard and Riker , and he commands the chief to go back to Engineering and resume his duties . Soon the attacks threaten to disable the shields , so a resigned appearing La Forge asks Logan to return to the bridge . The smug Logan assumes that he will be given command , however , La Forge orders a saucer separation , leaving Logan in charge of the escaping saucer , while La Forge and the remaining bridge crew will helm the battle bridge of the star @-@ drive section as it returns to Minos . 
 Picard discovers a computer terminal . He activates it , causing a hologram of the salesman to appear which explains that they are witnessing a demonstration of the " Echo @-@ Papa 607 " , a system of intelligent weapons which are able to upgrade in response to any enemy threat . Picard surmises that the <unk> and the Drake were destroyed by the weapon . He unsuccessfully attempts to coerce the hologram to end the demonstration . Data is able to find the hole leading to Picard 's location , and jumps down to try to assist . While examining the computer , Data concludes that while he could set the sentries to target their own power source , the explosion would probably take out the whole area , including the away @-@ team . Picard attempts to negotiate again with the salesman , eventually agreeing to buy the weapons system . Satisfied , the salesman disappears , and the computer system shuts down . Meanwhile , La Forge uses the planet 's atmosphere to reveal the location of the space @-@ born probe and destroys it . The away team return to the star @-@ drive section and set course to rendezvous with the saucer section , still under La Forge 's command , as Picard remarks that he left him with the ship intact and would like it returned in the same condition .

 Story editor Maurice Hurley saw the plot of " The Arsenal of Freedom " as commentary on the sale of American Grumman F @-@ 14 Tomcats to Iran taken to the " ultimate conclusion " . In 1974 , Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi purchased 80 Tomcats and missiles for $ 2 billion . That transaction prevented Grumman from going into bankruptcy as the United States Congress was no longer funding the project . Iran was the only country other than the United States to use the planes . 
 The original story had Picard injured , and Crusher revealing her feelings for him while trying to save him from dying . However the show 's creator Gene Roddenberry did not want to do a love story and so it was changed . Les Landau made the suggestion to switch around the roles of Picard and Crusher in order to take them out of their elements . Landau had been an assistant director on staff , and became the first member of the production team to direct an episode with " The Arsenal of Freedom " . 
 The model of the Echo Papa 607 drone was created by Dan Curry , from a L <unk> pantyhose container and a shampoo bottle . He hand animated the model instead of using motion control photography , using his years of Tai Chi training to keep the movements fluid . In order to blend into the background , he wore a pair of green tights whilst he was manually moving the model on screen .

 " The Arsenal of Freedom " first aired in broadcast syndication on April 11 , 1988 . It received a 10 @.@ 4 rating , meaning that it was seen by 10 @.@ 4 percent of all households . This was the first new episode for three weeks , the previous episode , " Heart of Glory " receiving a rating of 10 @.@ 7 . 
 Several reviewers re @-@ watched the episode after the end of the series . Keith DeCandido reviewed the episode for Tor.com in July 2011 . He highlighted the appearance of Vincent Schiavelli , saying that he " totally owns every scene he ’ s in " . He thought that the situation which left La Forge in charge of the Enterprise was " horribly contrived " and said " Picard doesn ’ t even give a good excuse for going down to the planet beyond the script calling for it " . He gave the episode a score of six out of ten , summing up that it was a " fun , enjoyable , diverting episode " . Zack Handlen reviewed the episode in May 2010 for The A.V. Club . He criticised the episode , saying that there " are all kinds of problems , the biggest being that the episode doesn 't really have a third act , but the moral superiority of the crew is on full display , and it 's frustrating . " He summed up the moral story played out in this episode , saying that " On TOS , Kirk , Spock , and McCoy would 've hashed out the appeal of an unbeatable weapon as well as its drawbacks . Here , we 're all supposed to know that violence begets violence , and that 's it . " He gave the episode a grade of C + . 
 James Hunt watched the episode for the website Den of Geek in March 2013 . He recalled it being a good episode , but found it wasn 't as good on the re @-@ watch for the review . He thought that the plot seemed reminiscent of the plot of a Philip K. Dick novel , but thought that the away team sequences on the planet were a little boring with the exception of Data jumping down into the pit where Picard and Crusher were . Michelle Erica Green reviewed the episode for the website TrekNation in August 2007 . She thought that the scenario with La Forge was the most forced but described Vincent Schiavelli as a " treat " . She said that the cast otherwise didn 't get to stretch much , but was pleased with the visuals where the star @-@ drive section enters the planet 's atmosphere . 
 = Final Symphony = 
 Final Symphony is a symphonic concert tour first held at the Historische Stadthalle Wuppertal in Wuppertal , Germany on May 11 , 2013 and continues to date . The concert tour features arrangements of video game music selected from the Final Fantasy series , specifically Final Fantasy VI , VII , and X. It is divided into three acts : a symphonic poem for VI , a piano concerto for X , and a symphony for VII . The concert is produced and directed by Thomas Böcker , with arrangements provided by Finnish composer and musician Jonne Valtonen , along with Roger Wanamo and Final Fantasy X composer Masashi Hamauzu with consultation from Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu . The original works were composed by Uematsu and Hamauzu , and an introductory piece was composed by Valtonen . The premiere concert was performed by the Wuppertal Symphony Orchestra under conduction from Eckehard Stier , with guest performer Benyamin Nuss joining the orchestra on piano . 
 Following the initial performance , Final Symphony was performed in several other venues . It was first performed in London at the Barbican Centre by the London Symphony Orchestra and Benyamin Nuss on May 30 , 2013 . In 2014 it was performed five times : twice at the Tokyo Bunka Kaikan in Tokyo on May 4 , 2014 by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra and Katharina Treutler , on May 9 at the Musikhuset Aarhus in Aarhus , Denmark by the Aarhus Symfoniorkester and Treutler , on June 18 at the Stockholm Concert Hall in Stockholm , Sweden by the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra and Treutler , and on September 12 at the Tampere Hall in Tampere , Finland by the Tampere Philharmonic Orchestra and Mischa Cheung . 
 A video of the Stockholm performance of the Final Fantasy VI Symphonic Poem was released on October 11 , 2014 , and a full album recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios was released on February 23 , 2015 by Merregnon Studios . The album , along with the concerts themselves , were heavily praised , both for the quality of the performance and for the quality of the arrangements , which overlaid themes from multiple pieces rather than relying on a more traditional medley . 
 = = Concert = = 
 = = = Production = = = 
 Thomas Böcker first began producing orchestral concerts of video game music in 2003 with the first Symphonic Game Music Concert in Leipzig , Germany . In 2008 , he , through his production company Merregnon Studios , began a series of four concerts of video game music that used longer , more elaborate arrangements of themes from the individual pieces of music from the games . This Symphonic series of concerts stood in contrast to the more standard concerts , which played straightforward orchestral versions of individual songs . The four concerts were Symphonic Shades – Hülsbeck in Concert ( 2008 ) , Symphonic Fantasies : Music from Square Enix ( 2009 ) , Symphonic Legends – Music from Nintendo ( 2010 ) , and Symphonic Odysseys : Tribute to Nobuo Uematsu ( 2011 ) . Both Symphonic Fantasies and Symphonic Odysseys featured music from the Final Fantasy series composed by Nobuo Uematsu . Böcker has said that he considers Uematsu to be " the most famous composer of video game music and in general one of the most influential " , and that Uematsu 's 20020220 - Music from Final Fantasy concert in 2002 was a big influence on his own concerts . 
 In May 2012 , Böcker announced that he was working on a concert of music solely from the Final Fantasy series , to be titled Final Symphony . The idea for the concert was first proposed by Uematsu in 2009 after Symphonic Fantasies ; the concert had featured Final Fantasy music as one of its four components , but unlike the other three the music had been a straightforward medley rather than a more complicated arrangement . While Uematsu had asked the team to keep the arrangements similar to those in other Final Fantasy concerts , after the concert he felt that an opportunity had been missed to create something unique like the other three arrangements , especially the Secret of Mana section . He encouraged Böcker to take more liberties with the source material if the opportunity arose , and hoped that another concert could be created in the future . Böcker proposed Final Symphony later that year to Uematsu , and got approval from Square Enix while coordinating a Tokyo concert of Symphonic Fantasies . Final Symphony is the first concert consisting entirely of new Final Fantasy arrangements in over ten years , since 20020220 - Music from Final Fantasy . 
 Böcker and the arrangers intended the arrangements in the concert to be " about telling the stories of the games " . In order to " capture the atmosphere of the games " , they limited the concert to three games from the series , so as not to spread the concert too thin . They chose the games to be Final Fantasy VI , VII , and X , not only because they liked the music in the games but because they felt previous concerts , including to an extent Symphonic Fantasies and Odysseys , had failed to evoke the feeling of the games due to focusing on the battle music in an unbalanced manner . In an interview Böcker used Final Fantasy VII as an example , stating that only part of " the game 's dark , romantic , melancholic , and hopeful story " was being portrayed by solely orchestrating the battle music from the game . Böcker wanted to focus on " longer pieces [ and ] deeper storytelling " than other concerts like the Distant Worlds series , so as to offer fans " something they really never heard before " . Final Symphony was the first concert produced by Merregnon Studios without outside financial support , and Böcker regards it as the riskiest venture Merregnon Studios had undertaken to date , as they could only rely on their own belief that audiences would respond strongly enough to the concert for it to be successful despite the production costs of producing a concert of the quality they wanted . 
 Jonne Valtonen , Roger Wanamo , and Masashi Hamauzu created the arrangements for the concert . Valtonen and Wanamo had previously worked with Böcker on the concerts in the Symphonic series , and Böcker has stated that if they had been unavailable for the project he would not have created Final Symphony at all . Hamauzu , in addition to arranging the Final Fantasy X music , was one of the composers of the original pieces he arranged . Uematsu , who composed music for all three games , served as a consultant for the project , though he did not arrange any pieces . When they first began the project , Böcker , Valtonen , and Wanamo took a few months to play through the games , watch playthrough videos , and read reviews and analyses of the games . They did not research other arrangements that have been done of the pieces , as they feel the general approach to video game music orchestration is very different from their style . They then got together to propose which tracks would be arranged , and decide which soundtracks worked best as a piano concerto , a symphonic poem , or a symphony . They chose a symphonic poem for VI , a piano concerto for X , and a symphony in three movements for VII . Böcker gave the team direction , and coordinated the arrangers in discussing and deciding which tracks to arrange . During the process of actually creating the arrangements , however , Böcker was not involved ; he feels that the arrangers are " masters of their art " and should have the freedom to create what they want . Nevertheless , the arrangers were communicating via e @-@ mail sharing their work in progress with Böcker : " If there are questions , or if they wish to know my opinion , I am there " . 
 The Final Fantasy VI poem follows the journey of Terra Branford , " the heroine born with the gift of magic " . The poem explores the stages of her life through the game , as she escapes from slavery , faces her amnesia , discovers the source of her powers , and saves the world from the insane Kefka Palazzo . Final Fantasy VI was the first Final Fantasy game that Wanamo had played , and he wanted to tell the story of the game as it felt to him . Wanamo has described the arrangement as the most difficult one he had done to date . Originally , the poem was going to follow the story of the group of heroes , before Wanamo made Terra the focus , and ended up dropping the themes of the other heroes due to length . The Final Fantasy X piano concerto was arranged by Hamauzu not to tell the story of the game , but to express the " continuum " of the series through the lens of the game . While inspired by the game 's story , Hamauzu also drew inspiration from the rest of the franchise to make the concerto more than " a series of separate scenes and stories " . He feels that a hallmark of Böcker 's concerts is that they are not limited to directly translating the original works , but instead tie them to a wider creative process . Valtonen created the three movements of the Final Fantasy VII symphony to show three aspects of the game 's setting . The first movement , " Nibelheim Incident " , follows the villain Sephiroth in his journey through the game ; the second , " Words Drowned by Fireworks " , explores the relationship between Cloud Strife , Aerith Gainsborough , and Tifa Lockhart ; while the third movement , " The Planet 's Crisis " , depicts the final clash between Cloud and Sephiroth . He tried to " bring out both the darkest moments as well as the heart " of the game .

 The first performance of Final Symphony was in Wuppertal , Germany at the Historische Stadthalle Wuppertal on May 11 , 2013 . The concert was held twice that day , and was conducted by Eckehard Stier , who had previously conducted for Symphonic Fantasies in Tokyo . It featured Benyamin Nuss , who had also performed in Symphonic Fantasies , on piano for the Final Fantasy X piano concerto . The concert was performed again on May 30 , 2013 , at the Barbican Centre in London , England by the London Symphony Orchestra . It was the first concert of video game music by the orchestra . Stier and Nuss repeated their performances from the premier . 
 The following year , the concert was performed in four more locations : twice at the Tokyo Bunka Kaikan in Tokyo on May 4 , 2014 by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra , on May 9 at the Musikhuset Aarhus in Aarhus , Denmark by the Aarhus Symfoniorkester , on June 18 at the Stockholm Concert Hall in Stockholm , Sweden by the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra , and on September 12 at the Tampere Hall in Tampere , Finland by the Tampere Philharmonic Orchestra . Stier conducted for all four performances , while Katharina Treutler replaced Nuss for the Tokyo , Aarhus , and Stockholm concerts , and Mischa Cheung performed in Tampere . The arrangements were slightly modified for the 2014 performances , and a new encore piece , " Suteki da ne " , was performed at the Tampere concert . 
 The Tokyo concert was the first video game music concert in Japan to receive a standing ovation , according to Merregnon Studios . It was described by both Dengeki Online and Famitsu as magnificent , with a bold and refreshing style that was met with " thunderous applause " . The London performance was also praised by critics ; Joe Hammond of Video Game Music Online , Ed Williams of The 405 , and Mariusz Borkowski of <unk> all praised the concert for its powerful performance as both video game and classical music , and Audun Sorlie of Original Sound Version noted the fierce applause and standing ovations at both the London and Wuppertal performances . 
 In 2016 , Final Symphony was performed by the Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra . It will make its North American debut this summer with a performance by the San Diego Symphony on July 21 , followed by the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra on July 23 and the San Francisco Symphony on July 27 . An October 21 concert by the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra in New Zealand has been scheduled as well .

 On December 13 , 2014 , Merregnon Studios announced that they would be producing an album for the concert , to be published the following year . Unlike prior Merregnon Studios concert albums , the Final Symphony album would not be a recording of one of the performances but would instead be a studio recording of the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios , produced especially for the album . The version of the concert recorded was the one used in the final performance in Tampere , rather than the one originally performed by the London Symphony Orchestra in 2013 . The performance was recorded on December 15 – 17 , was conducted by Eckehard Stier , and featured a piano performance by Katharina Treutler . Nobuo Uematsu supervised the production of the album . The album was published by X5 Music Group , who had previously published the Symphonic Fantasies Tokyo album for Merregnon Studios . It was released as a digital album on February 23 , 2015 , while a preview of the album was performed on British radio station Classic FM on February 21 . Prior to the album 's release , the only available recording of the concert was a video of the Stockholm performance of the Final Fantasy VI symphonic poem by the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra , released on their website on October 10 , 2014 . A physical version of the album was released on Blu @-@ ray in Japan on September 16 , 2015 , with releases in other countries to be announced . 
 The album was highly praised by critics . Stephen Meyerink of RPGFan described it as " the absolute top of the mountain in the world of video game music arrangement " . He claimed that the " complexity and passion " of the concert could be appreciated by any music fan , but urged even mild fans of the source material to immediately buy the album . He praised the album 's production values , saying that it was the closest a listener could get to the live performances from their home . Joe Hammond of Video Game Music Online also enthusiastically praised the album , declaring it not only the best album Merregnon Studios had ever produced but also " one of the best video game music albums ever made " . He noted both the complexity and quality of the arrangements , calling them out as superior to the ones in Symphonic Fantasies and Symphonic Odysseys due to their narrow focus , as well as the " world class " performance of the London Symphony Orchestra on the recording . Classic FM noted the album as a " spectacular arrangement " that they compared to the best of film music while naming it their album of the week . The Final Symphony album reached the top position on the iTunes Classical Charts in over ten countries , as well as the top five classical albums on the Billboard charts and the Official UK Charts .

 Final Symphony was followed by Final Symphony II , a concert of music from Final Fantasy V , VIII , IX , and XIII . It features long arrangements like the Final Symphony concerts . The majority of the music was originally composed by Nobuo Uematsu , while the Final Fantasy XIII suite was originally composed by Masashi Hamauzu . Valtonen created the arrangements for the Final Fantasy V section , Wanamo worked on the VIII and IX portions , and Hamauzu arranged his own compositions from XIII with orchestration by Valtonen . First announced was a concert to be performed at the Barbican Centre in London by the London Symphony Orchestra on September 12 , 2015 , and later an earlier performance on August 29 in Bonn , Germany by the Beethoven Orchestra Bonn was also announced . After the debut performances , the London Symphony Orchestra traveled to Japan to perform the concert there three times : in Osaka on September 27 , and twice in Yokohama on October 4 . 2016 performances of the concert will include a concert on April 1 at the Tampere Hall in Tampere , Finland by the Tampere Philharmonic Orchestra , and an June 9 concert by the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra at the <unk> in Stockholm , Sweden . 
 = SMS Habsburg ( 1865 ) = 
 SMS Habsburg was the second and final member of the Erzherzog Ferdinand Max class of broadside ironclads built for the Austrian Navy in the 1860s . She was built by the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino ; her keel was laid down in June 1863 , she was launched in June 1865 , and commissioning in June 1866 at the outbreak of the Third Italian War of Independence and the Austro @-@ Prussian War , fought concurrently . The ship was armed with a main battery of sixteen 48 @-@ pounder guns , though the rifled guns originally intended , which had been ordered from Prussia , had to be replaced with old smoothbore guns until after the conflicts ended . 
 Habsburg saw action at the Battle of Lissa in July 1866 , though she was not significantly engaged during the battle . In 1870 , she was used in a show of force to try to prevent the Italian annexation of Rome while the city 's protector , France , was distracted with the Franco @-@ Prussian War , though the Italians took the city regardless . The ship 's armament was revised several times in the 1870s and 1880s , before she was ultimately withdrawn from frontline service and employed as a guard ship and a barracks ship in Pola in 1886 . She served in this role until 1898 when she was stricken from the naval register and broken up for scrap in 1899 – 1900 .

 Habsburg was 83 @.@ 75 meters ( 274 ft 9 in ) long overall ; she had a beam of 15 @.@ 96 m ( 52 ft 4 in ) and an average draft of 7 @.@ 14 m ( 23 ft 5 in ) . She displaced 5 @,@ 130 metric tons ( 5 @,@ 050 long tons ; 5 @,@ 650 short tons ) . She had a crew of 511 .

 Habsburg was a broadside ironclad , and she was armed with a main battery of sixteen 48 @-@ pounder muzzle @-@ loading smooth @-@ bore guns . She also carried several smaller guns , including four 8 @-@ pounder guns and two 3 @-@ pounders . The ship 's hull was sheathed with wrought iron armor that was 123 mm ( 4 @.@ 8 in ) thick on the battery and reduced to 87 mm ( 3 @.@ 4 in ) at the bow and stern .

 Habsburg was built by the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in Trieste . Her keel was laid down in June 1863 , and she was launched on 24 June 1865 . The builders were forced to complete fitting @-@ out work quickly , as tensions with neighboring Prussia and Italy erupted into the concurrent Austro @-@ Prussian War and the Third Italian War of Independence in June 1866 . Habsburg 's rifled heavy guns were still on order from Krupp , and they could not be delivered due to the conflict with Prussia . Instead , the ship was armed with old smooth @-@ bore guns . Rear Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff , the commander of the Austrian Fleet , immediately began to mobilize his fleet . As the ships became fully manned , they began to conduct training exercises in Fasana . On 26 June , Tegetthoff sortied with the Austrian fleet and steamed to Ancona in an attempt to draw out the Italians , but the Italian commander , Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano , refused to engage Tegetthoff . Tegetthoff made another sortie on 6 July , but again could not bring the Italian fleet to battle . 
 = = = Battle of Lissa = = = 
 On 16 July , Persano took the Italian fleet , with twelve ironclads , out of Ancona , bound for the island of Lissa , where they arrived on the 18th . With them , they brought troop transports carrying 3 @,@ 000 soldiers . Persano then spent the next two days bombarding the Austrian defenses of the island and unsuccessfully attempting to force a landing . Tegetthoff received a series of telegrams between the 17 and 19 July notifying him of the Italian attack , which he initially believed to be a feint to draw the Austrian fleet away from its main base at Pola and Venice . By the morning of the 19th , however , he was convinced that Lissa was in fact the Italian objective , and so he requested permission to attack . As Tegetthoff 's fleet arrived off Lissa on the morning of 20 July , Persano 's fleet was arrayed for another landing attempt . The latter 's ships were divided into three groups , with only the first two able to concentrate in time to meet the Austrians . Tegetthoff had arranged his ironclad ships into a wedge @-@ shaped formation , with Habsburg on the right flank ; the wooden warships of the second and third divisions followed behind in the same formation . 
 While he was forming up his ships , Persano transferred from his flagship , Re d 'Italia , to the turret ship Affondatore . This created a gap in the Italian line , and Tegetthoff seized the opportunity to divide the Italian fleet and create a melee . He made a pass through the gap , but failed to ram any of the Italian ships , forcing him to turn around and make another attempt . Habsburg was not as heavily engaged in the ensuing melee ; she did not attempt to ram any Italian vessels , instead employed converging fire , though without success . During this period , the leading Italian ironclads , Principe di Carignano and Castelfidardo , opened fire at long range on Habsburg , Kaiser Max , and Salamander , though they only inflicted splinter damage on Salamander . 
 The battle ended after Tegetthoff 's flagship , Erzherzog Ferdinand Max , rammed and sank Re d 'Italia and heavy Austrian fire destroyed the coastal defense ship Palestro with a magazine explosion . Persano broke off the engagement , and though his ships still outnumbered the Austrians , he refused to counter @-@ attack with his badly demoralized forces . In addition , the fleet was low on coal and ammunition . The Italian fleet began to withdraw , followed by the Austrians ; Tegetthoff , having gotten the better of the action , kept his distance so as not to risk his success . In the course of the battle , Habsburg had fired 170 shells and had been hit 38 times in response , though she was not damaged and sustained no casualties . The Austrian fleet proceeded to Lissa and anchored in the harbor in Saint George Bay . That evening , Habsburg , Prinz Eugen , and a pair of gunboats patrolled outside the harbor . 
 = = = Later career = = = 
 After returning to Pola , Tegetthoff kept his fleet in the northern Adriatic , where it patrolled against a possible Italian attack . The Italian ships never came , and on 12 August , the two countries signed the Armistice of Cormons ; this ended the fighting and led to the Treaty of Vienna . Though Austria had defeated Italy at Lissa and on land at the Battle of Custoza , the Austrian army was decisively defeated by Prussia at the Battle of Königgrätz . As a result of Austria 's defeat , Kaiser Franz Joseph was forced to accede to Hungarian demands for greater autonomy , and the country became Austria @-@ Hungary in the Ausgleich of 1867 . The two halves of the Dual Monarchy held veto power over the other , and Hungarian disinterest in naval expansion led to severely reduced budgets for the fleet . 
 In 1869 , Kaiser Franz Joseph took a tour of the Mediterranean Sea in his imperial yacht Greif ; Habsburg , Erzherzog Ferdinand Max , and a pair of paddle steamers escorted the Kaiser for the trip to Port Said at the mouth of the Suez Canal . The two ironclads remained in the Mediterranean while the other vessels passed through the Canal into the Red Sea in company with Empress Eugenie of France aboard her own yacht . The Austro @-@ Hungarian ships eventually returned to Trieste in December . The following year , Habsburg was the sole Austro @-@ Hungarian ironclad in active service , the rest having been disarmed and laid up in Pola . Following the outbreak of the Franco @-@ Prussian War that summer and the withdrawal of the French garrison from Rome , the Italy seemed likely to annex the city from the Papal States . Franz Joseph decided to attempt to deter an Italian attack on Rome , and since Habsburg was the only capital ship available , she was sent to several Italian ports as a show of force in August . She left Italian waters in September at the same time the Prussians decisively defeated the French at the Battle of Sedan . With the collapse of the Second French Empire , and Franz Joseph unwilling to unilaterally attack Italy to defend Rome , the Austro @-@ Hungarians backed down and Italy seized the city . 
 In 1874 Habsburg was rearmed with a battery of fourteen 7 in ( 178 mm ) muzzle @-@ loading Armstrong guns and four light guns . Her battery was revised again in 1882 , with the addition of four 9 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) breech @-@ loading guns , two 7 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) breech @-@ loaders , a pair of 47 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) quick @-@ firing revolver guns , and three 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) auto @-@ cannon . Habsburg was withdrawn from service in 1886 and thereafter served as a guard ship and barracks ship in Pola . That year , these were removed and a single 26 cm ( 10 @.@ 2 in ) gun and a 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) gun were installed . She was stricken from the naval register on 22 October 1898 and broken up for scrap in 1899 – 1900 .

 Taliesin / <unk> / , sometimes known as Taliesin East or Taliesin Spring Green after 1937 , was the home and estate of American architect Frank Lloyd Wright . Located 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) south of the village of Spring Green in Iowa County , Wisconsin , United States , the 600 @-@ acre ( 240 ha ) property was developed on land that originally belonged to Wright 's maternal family . 
 Wright designed the Taliesin structure two years after leaving his first wife and home in Oak Park , Illinois with a mistress , Mamah Borthwick . The design of the original building was consistent with the design principles of the Prairie School , emulating the flatness of the plains and the natural limestone outcroppings of Wisconsin 's Driftless Area . The structure ( which included an agricultural and studio wing ) was completed in 1911 . 
 Wright rebuilt the Taliesin residential wing in 1914 after a disgruntled employee set fire to the living quarters and murdered Borthwick and six others . This second version was used only sparingly by Wright as he worked on projects abroad . He returned to the house in 1922 following completion of the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo . A fire caused by electrical problems destroyed the living quarters in April 1925 . The third version of the living quarters was constructed by Wright by late 1925 . In 1927 , financial problems caused a foreclosure on the building by the Bank of Wisconsin . Wright was able to reacquire the building with the financial help of friends and was able to reoccupy it as of November , 1928 . Taliesin III was Wright 's home for the rest of his life , although he began to winter at Taliesin West in Scottsdale , Arizona upon its completion in 1937 . Many of Wright 's acclaimed buildings were designed here , including <unk> , " Jacobs I " ( the first Wright @-@ designed residence of Herbert and Katherine Jacobs ) , the Johnson Wax Headquarters , and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum . Wright was also an avid collector of Asian art and used Taliesin as a storehouse and private museum . 
 Wright left Taliesin and the 600 @-@ acre Taliesin Estate to the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation ( founded by him and his third wife in 1940 ) upon his death in 1959 . This organization oversaw renovations to the estate until late 1992 upon the founding of Taliesin Preservation , Inc . , a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving the building and estate in Wisconsin . Taliesin mostly operates as a museum , however it is still occupied by former students of Wright 's in addition to students at the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture on a seasonal basis . The property was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976 and is being considered as part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site . 
 = = Location = = 
 Jones Valley , the Wisconsin River valley in which Taliesin sits , was formed during Pre @-@ Illinoian glaciation . This region of North America , known as the Driftless Area , was totally surrounded by ice during Wisconsin glaciation , but the area itself was not glaciated . The result is an unusually hilly landscape with deeply carved river valleys . 
 The valley , approximately 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) south of the village of Spring Green , Wisconsin , was originally settled by Frank Lloyd Wright 's maternal grandfather , Richard Lloyd Jones , who came from <unk> , Wisconsin with his family in 1858 to start a farm . By the 1870s , Richard 's sons had taken over operation of the farm , and they invited Wright work during summers as a farmhand . 
 Wright 's aunts Jennie and Nell began a co @-@ educational school , Hillside Home School , in the family valley in 1887 and let Wright design the building ; this was Wright 's first independent commission . In 1896 , Wright 's aunts again commissioned Wright , this time to build a windmill . The resulting Romeo and Juliet Windmill was unorthodox but stable . In the winter of 1900 , Wright compiled a portfolio of photographs he took of the surrounding area for a promotional brochure for the Hillside School . Unsatisfied with his original design for the Hillside School , Wright replaced the school in 1902 with a Prairie School design . Wright later sent several of his children to receive an education at the school . Wright 's final commission on the farm was a house for his sister Jane Porter in 1907 . Tan @-@ Y @-@ Deri , Welsh for " Under the Oaks " , was a design based on his recent Ladies Home Journal article " A Fireproof House for $ 5000 . " The family , their ideas , religion , and ideals , greatly influenced the young Wright , who later changed his middle name from Lincoln ( in honor of Abraham Lincoln ) to Lloyd in deference to his mother 's family . 
 When Wright decided to construct a home in this valley , he chose the name of the Welsh bard Taliesin , whose name means " shining brow " or " radiant brow " . Wright learned of the poet through Richard Hovey 's Taliesin : A Masque , a story about an artist 's struggle for identity . The Welsh name also suited Wright 's roots , as the Lloyd Joneses gave Welsh names to their properties . The hill upon which Taliesin was built was a favorite from Wright 's youth ; he saw the house as a " shining brow " on the hill . Although the name was originally only applied to the house , Wright later used the term to refer to the entire property . Wright and others used roman numerals to distinguish the three versions of the house . 
 = = Early history = = 
 From 1898 to 1909 , architect Frank Lloyd Wright lived and worked out of his home and studio in Oak Park , Illinois . In Oak Park , Wright had developed his concept of Prairie School architecture , designing houses primarily for local clients . In 1903 , Wright began designing a home for Edwin Cheney , but quickly took a liking for Cheney 's wife . Wright and Mamah Borthwick Cheney began an affair and separated from their spouses in 1909 . They met up in Florence , Italy , in February 1910 , where Wright made sketches of his future studio . He was particularly inspired by Michelozzo 's Villa Medici in Fiesole because it was built into a hill , had commanding views of its surroundings , and featured gardens on two levels . 
 In 1911 , the pair sought to return to the United States , but knew they could not escape scandal if they returned to Oak Park . Wright saw an alternative — his family 's ancestral farm near Spring Green , Wisconsin . On April 3 , Wright wrote to a friend requesting money to purchase " a small house " for his mother . By the 10th , Wright 's mother Anne had a signed deed for the property . By using Anne 's name , Wright was able to secure the 31 @.@ 5 @-@ acre ( 12 @.@ 7 ha ) property without attracting any attention to the affair . Late in the summer , Mamah quietly moved into the property , staying with Wright 's sister at Tan @-@ Y @-@ Deri . However , Wright and Borthwick 's new property was discovered by a Chicago Examiner reporter that fall , and the affair made headlines in the Chicago Tribune on Christmas Eve . 
 = = Taliesin I = = 
 The Taliesin house had three sections : two broad portions on either end and a narrow connecting loggia . Typical of a Prairie School design , the house was , as Wright described , " low , wide , and snug . " As with most of his houses , Wright designed the furniture . One of these broad sections was used as Wright 's studio and workroom . A small apartment wing juts out of this wing ; the apartment may have originally been intended for Wright 's mother , but was used by Wright 's head draftsman . Wright and Borthwick lived in the other broad portion . The one @-@ story complex was accessed by a road leading up the hill to the rear of the building . The estate gateway was on County Road C , just west of Wisconsin Road 23 . Iron entry gates were flanked by limestone piers capped with planter urns . 
 Wright chose yellow limestone for the house from a quarry of outcropping ledges on a nearby hill . Local farmers helped Wright move the stone up the Taliesin hill . Stones were laid in long , thin ledges , evoking the natural way that they were found in the quarry and across the Driftless Area . Plaster for the interior walls was mixed with sienna , giving the finished product a golden hue . This caused the plaster to resemble the sand on the banks of the nearby Wisconsin River . The outside plaster walls were similar , but mixed with cement , resulting in a grayer color . Windows were placed so that sun could come through openings in every room at every point of the day . Wright chose not to install gutters so that icicles would form in winter . <unk> on the gradually @-@ pitched roof were designed to weather to a silver @-@ grey color , matching the branches of nearby trees . A porte @-@ cochère was built over the main entrance of the living quarters to provide shelter for visiting automobiles . The finished house measured approximately 12 @,@ 000 square feet ( 1 @,@ 100 m2 ) of enclosed space . 
 = = = Life at Taliesin = = = 
 Upon moving in with Borthwick in the winter 1911 , Wright resumed work on his architectural projects , but he struggled to secure commissions because of the ongoing negative publicity over his affair with Borthwick ( whose husband , Edwin Cheney , maintained main custody of their son and daughter ) . However , Wright did produce some of his most acclaimed works during this time period , including the Midway Gardens in Chicago and the Avery Coonley Playhouse in Riverside . He also indulged his hobby for collecting Japanese art , and quickly became a renowned authority . Borthwick translated four works from Swedish difference feminist Ellen Key . 
 In his spare time , Wright developed a fruit farm on the property with over a thousand fruit trees and bushes that he ordered from Jens Jensen in 1912 . It is unknown exactly how many were planted , because part of the order was destroyed during a railroad strike . Wright requested two hundred and eighty @-@ five apple trees planted , including one hundred McIntosh , fifty Wealthy , fifty Golden Russet , and fifty <unk> . Among the bushes were three hundred gooseberry , two hundred blackberry , and two hundred raspberry . The property also grew pears , asparagus , rhubarb , and plums . The fruit and vegetable plants were placed along the contour of the estate , which may have been done to mimic the farms he saw while in Italy . Wright also dammed a creek on the property to create an artificial lake , which was stocked with fish and aquatic fowl . This water garden , probably inspired by the ones he saw in Japan , created a natural gateway to the property . 
 In 1912 , Wright designed what he called a " tea circle " in the middle of the courtyard , adjacent to the crown of the hill . This circle was heavily inspired by Jens Jensen 's council circles , but also took influence from Japanese wabi @-@ sabi landscape architecture . Unlike Jensen 's circles , the rough @-@ cut limestone tea circle was much larger and featured a pool in the center . The circle featured a curved stone bench flanked with Chinese jars built during the Ming Dynasty . A large oak tree stood at the center until it blew down in a storm in 1998 . The tea garden also included a large plaster replica of Flower in the <unk> Wall , a statue originally designed by Richard Bock for the Susan Lawrence Dana House ; the namesake poem is inscribed on its rear . 
 = = = Attack and fire = = = 
 Julian Carlton was a 31 @-@ year @-@ old man who came to work as a chef and servant at Taliesin for the summer . Carlton was of African American descent , ostensibly from Barbados . He was recommended to Wright by John Vogelsong , Jr . , the caterer for the Midway Gardens project . Carlton and his wife Gertrude had previously served in the house of Vogelsong 's parents in Chicago . Originally a genial presence on the estate , Carlton grew increasingly paranoid . He stayed up late at night with a butcher knife , looking out the window . This behavior had been noticed by Wright and Borthwick , who issued an ad in a local paper for a replacement cook . Carlton was given notice that August 15 , 1914 would be his last day in their employ . 
 Before he left , Carlton plotted to kill the residents of Taliesin . His primary target was draftsman Emil Brodelle , who had called Carlton a " black son @-@ of @-@ a @-@ bitch " on August 12 for not following an order . Brodelle and Carlton also engaged in a minor physical confrontation two days later . He planned the assault , targeting the noon hour , when Borthwick , her children , and the studio personnel would be on opposite sides of the property awaiting lunch . Wright was away in Chicago completing Midway Gardens while Borthwick stayed at home with her two children , 11 @-@ year old John and 9 @-@ year @-@ old Martha . On August 15 , Carlton grabbed a <unk> hatchet and began an attack . He started with the <unk> , who were waiting on the porch off the living room . Mamah Borthwick was killed by a single blow to the face , and her son John was slaughtered as he sat in his chair . Martha managed to flee , but was hunted down and slain in the courtyard . He then coated the bodies in gasoline and lit them on fire , setting the house ablaze . 
 Carlton then turned his attention to the other six residents , pouring gasoline underneath the door of the far end of the residence and setting it on fire . <unk> Herbert Fritz managed to break open a window and escape , though he broke his arm in the process . Carlton then entered the other dining room and killed Brodelle . He then hid , waiting for the other residents to try to escape . As foreman William Weston and his 13 @-@ year @-@ old son Ernest ran through the door , Carlton attacked with the hatchet . The Westons escaped , but Ernest died from his wounds hours later . Carlton sought out the final two residents , laborer Thomas Brunker and gardener David Lindblom . Brunker and Lindblom managed to fight off Carlton and escape , but died days later from their burns and injuries . With the house empty , Carlton ran to the basement and into a fireproof furnace chamber . He brought a small vial of hydrochloric acid with him as a fallback plan in case the heat became too much for him to handle . Carlton did attempt suicide by swallowing the acid , but it failed to kill him . 
 Lindblom and Weston alerted a neighboring farm of the attack . Weston then returned to the studio and used a garden hose to help extinguish the flames . His efforts saved the studio portion of the building and the many Wright manuscripts . Eventually , neighbors arrived to assist putting out the fire and search for survivors . Iowa County Sheriff John Williams located Carlton and arrested him . Carlton was transferred to the county jail in <unk> . Gertrude was found in a nearby field , apparently unaware of her husband 's intentions . She was dressed in travel clothes , expecting to catch a train to Chicago with Julian to seek a new job . 
 Gertrude was released from police custody shortly after the incident . She was sent to Chicago with $ 7 and was never heard from again . The hydrochloric acid that Carlton ingested failed to kill him , but did badly burn his esophagus , which made it difficult for him to ingest food . Carlton was indicted on August 16 and was charged with the murder of Mamah Borthwick , the only death that was directly witnessed by a survivor . Carlton entered a not guilty plea . Forty @-@ seven days after the fire , before the case could be heard , Carlton died of starvation in his cell . 
 = = = Aftermath = = = 
 Bodies of the dead and injured were brought to Tan @-@ Y @-@ Deri , the nearby home of Wright 's sister , Jane Porter . Wright returned to Taliesin that night with his son John and Edwin Cheney . Cheney brought the remains of his children back to Chicago while Wright buried Mamah Borthwick on the property . Heartbroken over the loss of his lover , Wright did not mark the grave because he could not bear to be reminded of the tragedy . He also did not hold a funerary service for Borthwick , although he did fund and attend services for his employees . Wright struggled with the loss of Borthwick , experiencing symptoms of conversion disorder : insomnia , weight loss , and temporary blindness . After a few months of recovery , aided by his sister Jane Porter , Wright moved to an apartment he rented in Chicago at 25 Cedar Street . The attack also had a profound effect on Wright 's design principles ; biographer Robert Twombly writes that his Prairie School period ended after the loss of Borthwick . 
 = = Taliesin II = = 
 Within a few months of his recovery , Wright began work on rebuilding Taliesin . The new complex was mostly identical to the original building . The dam was rebuilt ; Wright added an observation platform , perhaps inspired by the one he designed in Baraboo . Later , he built a hydroelectric generator in an unsuccessful effort to make Taliesin completely self @-@ sufficient . The generator was built in the style of a Japanese temple . Within only a few years , parts of the structure eroded away . It was demolished in the 1940s . 
 While designing the new residence , Wright received a sympathetic letter from Miriam Noel , a fan of his architecture . Wright exchanged correspondence with the wealthy divorcee and met with her at his Chicago office . Wright was quickly infatuated , and the two began a relationship . By Spring 1915 , Taliesin II was completed and Noel moved there with Wright . When Wright 's first wife Catherine finally granted him a divorce in 1925 , Wright and Miriam married . Although Wright admired Noel 's erratic personality at first , her behavior ( later identified as schizophrenia ) led to a miserable life together at Taliesin . 
 In the new Taliesin , Wright worked to repair his tarnished reputation . He secured a commission to design the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo , Japan ; when the building was undamaged following the 1923 earthquake , Wright 's reputation was restored . Although he later expanded the agricultural wing , Wright spent little time at the second Taliesin house , often living near his construction sites abroad . Instead of serving as a full @-@ time residence , Wright treated Taliesin like an art museum for his collection of Asian works . Wright only truly lived at Taliesin II starting in 1922 , after his work at the Imperial Hotel was completed . 
 On April 20 , 1925 , Wright returned from eating dinner in the detached dining room when he noticed smoke billowing from his bedroom . By that time of night , most of the employees had returned home ; only a driver and one apprentice were left in the complex . Unlike the first Taliesin fire , Wright was able to get help immediately . However , the fire quickly spread due to high winds . Despite the efforts of Wright and his neighbors to extinguish the flame , the living quarters of the second Taliesin estate were quickly destroyed . However , the <unk> where Wright kept his architectural drafts were spared . According to Wright 's autobiography , the fire appeared to have begun near a telephone in his bedroom . Wright also mentioned a lightning storm approaching immediately before noticing the fire . Wright scholars speculate that the storm may have caused an electrical surge through the telephone system , sparking the fire . 
 = = Taliesin III = = 
 Wright was deeply in debt following the destruction of Taliesin II . Aside from debts owed on the property , his divorce from Noel forced Wright to sell much of his farm machinery and livestock . Wright was also forced to sell his prized Japanese prints at half value to pay his debts . The Bank of Wisconsin foreclosed on Taliesin in 1927 and Wright was forced to move to La Jolla , California . Shortly before the bank was to begin an auction on the property , Wright 's former client Darwin Martin conceived a scheme to save the property . He formed a company called Frank Lloyd Wright Incorporated to issue stock on Wright 's future earnings . Many of Wright 's former clients and students purchased stock in Wright to raise $ 70 @,@ 000 . The company successfully bid on Taliesin for $ 40 @,@ 000 , returning it to Wright . 
 Wright returned to Taliesin in the winter of 1928 and began to rebuild the complex , which he named Taliesin III , shortly afterward . Wright 's interaction with Taliesin lasted for the rest of his life , and eventually , he purchased the surrounding land , creating an estate of 593 acres ( 2 @.@ 4 km ² ) . Some of Wright 's best known buildings and most ambitious designs were created at Taliesin III . Works completed during this period include the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum , the First Unitarian Society Meeting House , and Price Tower ; he designed " The Illinois " , a mile @-@ high building , there in 1956 . In its final form , the Taliesin III building measured 37 @,@ 000 square feet ( 3 @,@ 400 m2 ) . All Wright buildings on the property combine for 75 @,@ 000 square feet ( 7 @,@ 000 m2 ) , just short of 2 acres ( 0 @.@ 81 ha ) , on 600 acres ( 240 ha ) of land . 
 = = = Taliesin Fellowship = = = 
 Wright inherited the Hillside Home School when it became insolvent in 1915 . The building sat empty until 1928 , when Wright conceived the idea of hosting a school there . He issued a proposal to the University of Wisconsin that would have created the Hillside Home School for the Allied Arts ; however , the plan was later abandoned . In 1932 , the Wrights instead established the private Taliesin Fellowship , where fifty to sixty apprentices could come to Taliesin to study under the architect . Students helped him develop the estate at a time when Wright received few commissions for his work . Once he began Taliesin West , a winter home in Scottsdale , Arizona , in 1937 , Wright and the fellowship " migrated " between the two homes each year . 
 Wright did not consider the fellowship a formal school , instead viewing it as a benevolent educational institution . He also worked to ensure G.I. Bill eligibility for returning World War II veterans . The town of Wyoming , Wisconsin and Wright became embroiled in a legal dispute over his claim of tax @-@ exemption . A trial judge agreed with the town , stating that since apprentices did much of Wright 's work , it was not solely a benevolent institution . Wright fought the case to the Wisconsin Supreme Court . When Wright lost the case there in 1954 , he threatened to abandon the estate . However , he was persuaded to stay after some friends raised $ 800 @,@ 000 to cover the back taxes at a benefit dinner . 
 = = Preservation = = 
 In 1940 , Frank Lloyd Wright , his third wife <unk> , and his son @-@ in @-@ law William Wesley Peters formed the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation . Upon Wright 's death on April 9 , 1959 , ownership of the Taliesin estate in Spring Green , as well as Taliesin West , passed into the hands of the foundation . The Taliesin Fellowship continued to use the Hillside School as the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture . The fellowship allowed tours of the school , but initially did not permit visitation of the house or other grounds . When the group spent two summers in Switzerland , rumors started that they were planning on selling the house to S. C. Johnson , a former Wright client . Instead , the fellowship sold a surrounding piece of land to a developer associated with the company , intending to develop a tourist complex . The 3 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 1 @,@ 200 ha ) resort included an eighteen hole golf course , restaurant , and a visitor 's center . 
 = = = Recognition = = = 
 On January 7 , 1976 , Taliesin was recognized as a National Historic Landmark ( NHL ) District by the National Park Service . The nine properties contributing to the district are the landscape , Taliesin III , Hillside Home School , the Hillside Playhouse , the dam , Romeo and Juliet Windmill , Midway Farms , the pool and gardens in the courtyard , and Tan @-@ Y @-@ Deri . This designation also listed the property in the National Register of Historic Places . A National Historic Landmark is a site deemed to have " exceptional value to the nation . " 
 In the late 1980s , Taliesin and Taliesin West were together nominated as a World Heritage Site , a UNESCO designation for properties with special worldwide significance . The nomination was rejected because the organization wanted to see a larger nomination with more Wright properties . In 2008 , the National Park Service submitted the Taliesin estate along with nine other Frank Lloyd Wright properties to a tentative list for World Heritage Status , which the National Park Service says is " a necessary first step in the process of nominating a site to the World Heritage List . " The properties are expected to first become eligible for the designation in 2016 . 
 In 1987 , the National Park Service evaluated the 1 @,@ 811 <unk> nationwide for historical integrity and threat of damage . Taliesin was declared a " Priority 1 " NHL , a site that is " seriously damaged or imminently with such damage . " Furthermore , the site was listed by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as one of America 's Most Endangered Places in 1994 , citing its " water damage , erosion , foundation settlement and wood decay . " Taliesin Preservation , Inc . ( TPI ) , a non @-@ profit organization , was established in 1991 to restore Taliesin . 
 = = = Rehabilitation = = = 
 On June 18 , 1998 , a severe storm damaged the estate . Heavy rains caused the drainage system to fail and a cascade of water surged over the retaining wall . This caused a mudslide , damaging the estate 's foundation . Furthermore , the large oak tree at the center of the courtyard fell down on top of the house . The next year , another storm collapsed a tunnel underneath the studio wing . A 1999 grant from Save America 's Treasures helped defray costs to re @-@ roof Taliesin III , to stabilize its foundation , and to connect it to a local sewage treatment plant . 
 Over $ 11 million has been spent on the rehabilitation of Taliesin since 1998 . Unfortunately , its preservation is " fraught with epic difficulties " , because Wright never thought of it as a series of buildings with a long @-@ term future . It was built by inexperienced students , without solid foundations . Financing renovations has been challenging because revenue from Taliesin visitation has been lower than projected . 
 TPI provides tours from May 1 through October 31 . In April and November , the association provides only an exterior shuttle and walking tour . Because the organization owns the property , it is inaccessible outside the confines of a tour . Roughly 25 @,@ 000 people visit Taliesin each year . 
 = = = Assessment = = = 
 Architectural historian James F. O 'Gorman compares Taliesin to Thomas Jefferson 's Monticello , calling it " not a mere building but an entire environment in which man , architecture and nature form a harmonious whole . " He continues that the building is an expression of Romanticism influence in architecture . William <unk> , in an assay of the Prairie School movement , agrees with O 'Gorman 's assessment and calls Taliesin " the ultimate prairie house . " In Taliesin 1911 – 1914 , a collection of essays about the first house , the authors and editor conclude that Taliesin was " Wright 's architectural self portrait . " In a 2009 publication for the Thoreau Society , Naomi <unk> notes thematic similarities between the architecture of Taliesin and the concept of simplicity advocated by philosopher Henry David Thoreau .

 The first season of the American web television series Daredevil , which is based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name , follows the early days of Matt Murdock / Daredevil , a lawyer @-@ by @-@ day who fights crime at night , juxtaposed with the rise of crime lord Wilson Fisk . It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe ( MCU ) , sharing continuity with the films and other television series of the franchise . The season was produced by Marvel Television in association with ABC Studios , DeKnight <unk> and Goddard Textiles , with Steven S. DeKnight serving as showrunner , and series creator Drew Goddard acting as consultant . 
 Charlie Cox stars as Murdock , while Vincent D 'Onofrio plays Fisk . The two are joined by principal cast members Deborah Ann Woll , Elden Henson , Toby Leonard Moore , Vondie Curtis @-@ Hall , Bob Gunton , Ayelet Zurer , and Rosario Dawson . Daredevil entered development in late 2013 , with Goddard initially hired in December 2013 . DeKnight replaced him as showrunner and Cox was hired to star in May 2014 . Filmed in New York City from July to December 2014 , the season focuses on the darker , more mature elements of the source material . Stephanie Maslansky designed the costumes for the season , with the final red suit for Daredevil designed by Ryan Meinerding and the costume artists at Marvel Studios . The season features links and references to other MCU projects , including future Netflix series . 
 The first two episodes of the season premiered in Los Angeles on April 2 , 2015 , with the full season of 13 episodes released on Netflix on April 10 to an estimated high viewership and critical acclaim . Critics praised the performances , particularly D 'Onofrio 's , and the darker tone and action sequences of the series compared to other properties set in the MCU . However , some of the pacing during the season and the final red Daredevil suit received criticism . The first season received two nominations for Creative Emmy Awards , for the visual effects from Shade VFX , and the sound editing . The series was renewed for a second season on April 21 , 2015 .

 In October 2013 , Marvel and Disney announced that they would provide Netflix with live action series centered around Daredevil , Jessica Jones , Iron Fist , and Luke Cage , leading up to a miniseries based on the Defenders . Drew Goddard was hired to serve as executive producer and showrunner for Daredevil , however , in May 2014 it was announced that Goddard had stepped down as showrunner in order to focus on directing a feature film based on Marvel 's Sinister Six for Sony Pictures Entertainment . He was succeeded by Steven S. DeKnight . Goddard , who wrote the first two episodes , remained with the show as a consultant and executive producer . It was also revealed that the series would be titled Marvel 's Daredevil . The first season consists of 13 hour @-@ long episodes , and DeKnight , Goddard , Jeph Loeb , Jim Chory , Dan Buckley , Joe Quesada , Stan Lee , Alan Fine , Cindy Holland , Kris <unk> , Allie Goss , and Peter Friedlander serve as executive producers .

 The season does not directly adapt any one storyline from the comics , with DeKnight feeling that it was more important to focus on " nailing the spirit of the comics " . He stated that Netflix 's support of " the creatives " coupled with Marvel 's restrictions on their properties led to him pushing the source material as far as he could while remaining respectful of the characters and their history , and being surprised at " how willing everyone is to take a really fresh look and really push what we ’ re doing . " Vincent D 'Onofrio compared telling a story on Netflix to more of a " 13 @-@ hour film " than a television series and noted that time can be taken to tell the story and " be much more specific " . Deborah Ann Woll explained that what she saw as one of the most important themes in the series was normal people having an impact in " seemingly insurmountable circumstances " , with the focus not being on Daredevil 's abilities or the characters ' qualifications , but on their willingness to help people . 
 Though the season was much more violent than previous MCU works , DeKnight felt that sexual violence would be " too far " , saying that " Daredevil wasn ’ t asking for a lot of sexual situations , especially since Matt Murdock is not really in the position to get into a relationship , and it just didn ’ t fit the story for that season . I think that ’ ll change moving forward , but I never pushed any kind of sexual agenda on the show . I think once Daredevil was a hit and people were really responding positively , you can see the progression into more of an adult world in Jessica Jones . 
 Speaking about the way the season reveals the name Daredevil , DeKnight explained that several options had been brought up , such as " one of the versions in the comics where when he was a kid people used to taunt him with the name Daredevil " , which did not fit in the world of the series , or having Ben Urich give the character the name , but the timing for that did not work due to Urich 's death before the final Daredevil suit was introduced . It was decided that instead of having the name Daredevil said onscreen , it would be easier to introduce it through the media as a newspaper headline . On why this was not done for Wilson Fisk as Kingpin , DeKnight stated that he felt it would " get a little bit silly .... [ if ] we went , ' Oh they called him Daredevil ! Oh they called him Kingpin ! ' , " and was unable to come up with another natural way for the name Kingpin to come up , so it was decided to leave that for a later time .

 = = = Design = = = 
 Costume designer Stephanie Maslansky read the first two episodes ' scripts and some outlines of future scripts , and developed a " solid understanding " of the character arcs and overall story to begin the advanced planning needed for costume design . She also asked questions to prepare for character 's stunt requirements and the building or retro @-@ fitting of more complex costumes . 
 Murdock begins the season wearing a black costume ( called the " vigilante outfit " by production ) , inspired by the one worn by the character in Frank Miller 's The Man Without Fear , rather than the more traditional red , horned suit . This was done to highlight the formation of Matt Murdock as Daredevil , with the costume evolving over time as the character develops . Marvel Comics ' Chief Creative Officer Quesada conceptualized the look based on DeKnight 's specifications . On the design process , DeKnight revealed that " we tried practically everything , design @-@ wise . We experimented with a lot of different head pieces . One version was a ski mask with the eyes sewn shut . We tried everything until we found something that just felt right . " DeKnight and Quesada explained that the idea was for Murdock to start out with a homemade outfit that fits more in the " real @-@ world " of the series , and to then evolve it into the classic Daredevil suit . Maslansky noted that they wanted the outfit to " look like something that Matt Murdock could put together himself , that he could either order off the Internet or shop around town .... we wound up with pretty practical choices for him . His shirts are compression shirts and his pants wound up being from an army / navy store . " Concerning the black mask , Maslansky noted that a balance between aesthetic and safety was required , and that it was made of layers of cotton mesh that " really conform to his head " but also allowed Cox to see through the mask . 
 On the red suit , Maslansky said , " We wanted something that looked militaristic and functional , but also dramatic and sexy " adding that it was " tricky " making it practical . To begin the process of creating the suit , Quesada contacted Ryan Meinerding and the costume artists and design team at Marvel Studios , who all contributed design ideas , with one of Meinerding 's ultimately being picked . Quesada , who previously worked as an artist on Daredevil comics , gave several suggestions , including the incorporation of some of how New York was created into the suit , which led to the use of rivets and " architectural " shapes . The suit is intended to look like a Kevlar vest , and the black sections are an homage to comic panels where the artists highlighted certain areas with red , with " deeper portions " in shadow . On the mask , Meinerding noted the difficulty in designing the entire top half of a face that is intended to match the bottom half of an actor 's face , " because half of his face has to be covered and has its own expression and the actor ’ s face is going to be doing something else " . For the billy clubs used by Daredevil in the series , which were designed by Andy Park , discussions were had about having them holstered on the right leg , given that both Cox and his stunt double Chris Brewster are right handed , but it was ultimately decided to have the holster on the left hand side as it is in the " classic profile " of the comics . DeKnight explained that Murdock 's Daredevil suit does not have the " DD " emblem on the chest as seen in the comics , because Murdock receives his moniker only after the suit is introduced . He also felt that the emblem was " one of the more problematic emblems in superhero @-@ dom " , and that Daredevil 's suit in the comics was " very difficult to translate to screen , especially in this world that is grounded and gritty " . 
 Many of the male characters in the series are often seen wearing suits , which Maslansky was comfortable with after working as the costume designer on White Collar . Murdock 's suits are differentiated more by texture than color , with a limited palette , given that the character cannot see what color his clothing is . Cox 's size changed throughout the series as he continued to work out . For Murdock 's sunglasses , Maslansky worked with series prop master Michael <unk> to make something that fit into the modern world , but paid homage to " what was familiar to fans " . Close to 100 different versions of the prop were created for Cox to try . For the women of the series , Maslansky looked to their backstories in the show , with Page having dreams and fantasies of a life in New York along the lines of Katharine Hepburn and Lauren Bacall , and dressing according to those thoughts ( " retro , slim skirts , tighter fitting tops and slim dresses " ) , while Marianna coming into the series as a mysterious yet glamorous femme fatale , dressing in high @-@ end , couture clothing ; " she needed to appeal to [ Fisk ] . He wouldn ’ t go for just any chick in a pair of old jeans and a t @-@ shirt . " 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 In February 2014 , Marvel announced that Daredevil would be filmed in New York City . In April 2014 , Quesada reiterated this , stating that the show would be filming in areas of Brooklyn and Long Island City that still look like the old Hell ’ s Kitchen , in addition to sound stage work . Loeb said that Daredevil would begin filming in July 2014 , and DeKnight confirmed that filming had started that month . In October 2014 , filming took place in the Williamsburg and Greenpoint neighborhoods in Brooklyn . Production concluded on December 21 , 2014 . It filmed under the working title Bluff , on a $ 56 million budget . The production received $ 14 @.@ 3 million under the New York Film & TV Tax Credit Program . 
 " Cut Man " ends with a long action sequence filmed in a single take . DeKnight called it the " most complicated action scene " in the series , due to the technical difficulty in filming it , and credited Goddard , episodic director Phil Abraham , stunt coordinator Philip J Silvera , and series cinematographer Matt Lloyd with realizing it . He also named The Raid films as inspiration for the sequence . There were only a few days to plan and set up the fight , as opposed to a film which would allow " at least a couple of weeks " , and it took 7 or 8 takes to get the shot right . Silvera explained that the scene was always scripted to be a one @-@ shot , and that he had intended to work around it with wipes , but Abraham challenged the team to do it all for real , which allowed the fight to feel more grounded by having them " slow down the fight , and just have this raw , animalistic feeling happening . " The final shot does include some ' Texas <unk> ' between actors and stunt doubles , but was ultimately filmed with no cuts . 
 Talking about the scene where Fisk beheads Anatoly <unk> with a car door in " In the Blood " , DeKnight noted that series like Spartacus and The Walking Dead would have shown the head being crushed , which he felt was " the right choice " for them , but for Daredevil " we did very much a Psycho thing , we saw the aftereffects of it , but you never saw the car door crushing his head .... Sound effects , absolutely . It ’ s a very disturbing scene without crossing that line into a horror movie kind of deal . " 
 = = = Visual effects = = = 
 Visual effects for the series were completed by the New York studio Shade VFX ; Daredevil featured over 1000 visual effect shots . Executive visual effects supervisor Bryan <unk> explained that the company 's work included the creation of digital doubles when stunts were not safe for actors or stunt doubles , as well as blood @-@ hits and wounds , with " a lot of support to the idea of the violence and gore that happens in Daredevil " given to differentiate the series from other Marvel projects , and to try to set the series in a " more realistic and dark place , the real streets of New York . " 
 One shot created by Shade VFX is when the audience sees Matt Murdock 's " vision " – the way that he " sees " using his other heightened senses . On why this was only used once in the season , DeKnight explained that it had in fact been budgeted to appear several more times , with the effect actually completed at least twice more for the season . It was removed for several reasons , including to avoid taking away the specialty of it , and to maintain the crime drama tone of the series . One instance where it would have been used again was in " Stick " , where the audience would have seen how Murdock saw Stick as he threw keys at him , and then when he is older and Stick throws fighting sticks at him and his senses are more refined . In that case , the effect was not finished on time . Another instance was in " The Ones We Leave Behind " when Murdock comes across a Chinese worker and realizes that he has been blinded . The final use of the effect was going to be in " Daredevil " when the camera pushes in on Page 's reaction Murdock telling her that they can work together . Here , the effect was hiding all of the nuances in her expression , so it was decided that it would be better to remove it . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Composer John Paesano was brought on " a couple of weeks in to post @-@ production " , and scored an episode every four to five days . Paesano estimated that each episode has around 25 – 30 minutes of music in it . In approaching the series ' score , Paesano looked to DeKnight , who " had a very clear vision of what he wanted ... music you could feel and not necessarily hear . " The result was a more minimalist score than typical " superhero " music , although the music starts to " change color " and move closer to that of the MCU when the classic red costume is introduced . Most of the score was produced electronically , though live elements , such as a cello , were used where possible . Rather than " keep the drive and the energy up " with drums , Paesano elected to use a low pulsing heartbeat that was inline with the series ' minimalist approach , and tied into the fact that <unk> can hear people 's heartbeats in the show . A soundtrack album for the season was released on iTunes on April 27 , 2015 . 
 All music composed by John Paesano , unless otherwise noted .

 In February 2015 , Emma Fleisher of Marvel Television stated that Daredevil takes place in the aftermath of The Avengers , but would not " explicitly [ be ] in that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. world . We 're in our own corner [ of the MCU ] . So the aliens came down and ruined the city , and this is the story of Hell 's Kitchen 's rebuild . " Connections to other MCU properties include the character of Carl " Crusher " Creel , who appears in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. portrayed by Brian Patrick Wade , and is mentioned as having fought Jack Murdock in the latter 's final boxing match ; St. Agnes Orphanage , where both Matt Murdock and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s Skye are raised ; the insignia on Madame Gao 's heroin , which is a connection to the Iron Fist antagonist Steel Serpent ; and mentions of Roxxon Oil , a company featured throughout the MCU . 
 The final scene of " Stick " , featuring a conversation between Stick and Stone , was meant to hint at further ties between the series and other areas of the MCU in the same way as Marvel 's film post @-@ credits scenes , though it could not actually go after the episode 's credits due to the way that Netflix begins the next episode during the credits of the current one . There were discussions about having another such " coda " at the end of the season finale , one which would have featured Leland Owlsley attempting to escape New York , only to be killed by the Punisher in a surprise introduction . The scene would not have shown the actor 's face , but would have included the character 's iconic skull insignia . The idea was dropped , again because of Netflix 's playing system , and Owlsley was ultimately killed by Fisk in the episode , with the introduction of the Punisher saved for the series ' second season .

 At the October 2014 New York Comic Con , footage from the series was shown .

Merrill Barr of Forbes noted the dark tone of the trailer in a similar vein to DC Comics ' Arrow and different from Marvel 's ABC series , but questioned the timing of the trailer debut after Super Bowl XLIX , especially as the company did not air trailers during the event for Avengers : Age of Ultron or Ant @-@ Man and could have benefited from introducing " its latest and riskiest show " to general audiences through it . In March 2015 , an additional motion poster was released , which featured all major characters and Avengers Tower in the background of the poster , as well as the possible reveal of Murdock 's red suit in his reflection . In the lead up to the first season premiere , a street marketing campaign appeared across the world in 12 cities with various artists creating murals . On April 2 , 2015 , the series had its premiere at the Regal Premiere House at L.A. Live where the first two episodes were previewed .

" Metacritic , which uses a weighted average , assigned a score of 75 out of 100 , based on 22 critics , indicating " generally favorable reviews " . 
 In reviews for the first five episodes of the series , Brian Lowry of Variety felt that " Compared to Marvel 's experience with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. for ABC , operating in Netflix 's pay @-@ to @-@ view world is clearly liberating " in terms of what can be done and shown . Matt Patches of Esquire added , " The show 's exterior recasts the high fructose , splash page <unk> of Iron Man , Thor , Captain America with neo @-@ noir attitude . Goddard and DeKnight drench Daredevil in shadows and blood . " He compared Daredevil to " a TV spinoff " of Christopher Nolan 's Batman films , and praised Cox and D 'Onofrio 's portrayals , while criticizing a subplot involving Nelson and Page and noting that the slow pacing of Daredevil , in which story may be stretched out more than needs be , could be a problem for binge @-@ watchers . Victoria McNally of MTV felt the early episodes ' fight sequences were " filmed beautifully " and enjoyed that they featured little CGI , while also calling Henson " perfectly cast and endlessly amusing " as Nelson . 
 Eric Eisenberg of Cinema Blend also had positive thoughts on the initial episodes , saying , " It ’ s smart , entertaining , and has moments so shocking that you ’ ll have to repress screams . Suffice it to say , Marvel and Netflix have another big winner on their respective plates , " while also praising the acting . Speaking of the first two episodes , Mark Hughes of Forbes added additional praise , saying , " Quite simply , in Daredevil Marvel delivers one of the greatest live @-@ action superhero origin stories ever made . It is in the same top @-@ tier category of true superhero origin films along with Batman Begins , Iron Man , and Superman : The Movie . " Hughes stated that if the first two episodes were released in theaters with only minor tweaks , they " would ’ ve been hailed as one of Marvel ’ s best films to date . " Mike Hale at the New York Times was less positive about the series , calling it ordinary , but admitting having high expectations due to his love for the comics , and admiring the care and seriousness with which the series was made . He called the series pace " leisurely " , but " a pleasant change from the norm " , and called Cox 's performance " divided " , praising him as Murdock and criticizing him as Daredevil . Hale was positive about the cast overall , and ultimately surmised that after seeing the first five episodes , Daredevil is " eminently watchable " , but not the Daredevil he remembered from the comics . 
 After reviewing each of the individual episodes , IGN reviewer Matt Fowler gave the entire first season a score of 9 out of 10 , indicating an " Amazing " season , saying that though it may have " spun a few wheels " while building up to its endgame , the series was " a thrilling , ultra @-@ satisfying take on Daredevil 's material and lore . One that , like Favreau 's first Iron Man film , helped breathe new life and fandom into a somewhat B @-@ tier Marvel character . " He particularly praised D 'Onofrio 's performance , the " edgy " fight sequences , the fact that the hero himself got " beat on – a lot " , and the unique dark take on the MCU . Liz Shannon Miller , reviewing the season for Indiewire , graded it a ' B + ' , and though feeling that it didn 't quite live up to DeKnight 's admitted influence , The Wire , praised the series , noting its characters and development , and the performances of the entire cast , especially those of D 'Onofrio , Curtis @-@ Hall , and Cox . She was positive of the level of violence the series depicted , and all of its " brutal " and " beautiful " fight sequences , as well as the way that the series explores the consequences of the films on average people , while committing to building its own universe within the already established MCU . Alan Sepinwall of HitFix also praised the cast and characters , particularly D 'Onofrio , and felt that series benefited from having a much narrower focus than the Marvel films or other series . He did wish that Murdock 's " world on fire " <unk> was used more often , and felt that the classic Daredevil costume , which " may not translate well to live @-@ action " , could use " some tweaks " .

The two events led to widespread famine and economic woe in the region . Ross learned Russian at the behest of his mother , and developed a love of the theater and language . Ross 's mother encouraged him to read , which he did often , and subscribed to a private library since Odessa had no public library . He credited his favorite uncle , an X @-@ ray diagnostician , with introducing him to mathematics . The uncle had hired Samuil Shatunovsky to tutor his talented son , and Ross asked to join in . As money meant little due to inflation , Shatunovsky was paid to tutor the two boys with a pound of French hard candy . During this time , Ross was not taught with textbooks or lectured on geometric proofs . His geometry teacher would ask the class to prove and justify ideas on the blackboard per trial and error . Many universities were closed due to the famine , but Odessa University reopened and let a small group of adolescents attend , including Ross . 
 Ross left Odessa — now part of the USSR — in 1922 with the intention of returning to Chicago and studying topology with E. H. Moore at the University of Chicago . After negotiating his way home , he worked at a family friend 's bookbinding shop and continued to learn English at the Lewis Institute . He also changed his surname from <unk> to Ross in 1922 . Ross used his salary from a year at the shop to enroll for one term at the University of Chicago in Moore 's course . Moore gave Ross special attention , knowing his untraditional background , and arranged for Ross to attend the topology class as the sole undergraduate . 
 In Moore 's teaching style , he would propose a conjecture and task the students with proving it . Students could respond with counter @-@ conjectures that they would defend . Ross found Moore 's method exciting , and his pedagogy influenced Ross 's own . Ross graduated with a B.S. degree and continued his study as Leonard Eugene Dickson 's research assistant . Ross earned a M.S. degree and finished his Ph.D. in number theory at the University of Chicago in 1931 with Dickson as his adviser . Ross 's dissertation was entitled " On Representation of Integers by Indefinite Ternary Quadratic Forms " . He did not pay tuition after his first quarter , which he credits to Dickson . 
 Ross married Bertha ( Bee ) Halley <unk> , a singer @-@ musician and daughter of Ross 's Chicago neighbors , in 1931 , received a National Research Council Fellowship for 1932 , and worked as a National Research Council postdoctoral fellow at California Institute of Technology with Eric Temple Bell until 1933 . Ross moved back to Chicago and led the mathematics department at an experimental school started by Ph.D.s during the Great Depression , People 's Junior College , where he also taught physics . Ross became an assistant professor at St. Louis University in 1935 and stayed for about 11 years . In an interview , he said he advocated for a student who became the first black woman in the South to receive a master 's degree in mathematics . This exception led the university to admit black students despite the idea 's widespread unpopularity . During World War II , Ross served as a research mathematician for the U.S. Navy . He befriended Hungarian mathematician Gábor Szegő while in St. Louis , who recommended Ross for a 1941 Brown University summer school that prepared young scientists to assist in the war , a program Ross attended . He occasionally worked on proximity fuzes for Stromberg @-@ Carlson 's laboratory from 1941 to 1945 before accepting a position as head of University of Notre Dame 's mathematics department in 1946 . He set out to change the school 's research climate by inviting distinguished mathematicians including Paul Erdős , whom Ross made a full professor . 
 = = Ross Mathematics Program = = 
 While at Notre Dame in 1947 , Ross began a mathematics program that prioritized what he described as " the act of personal discovery through observation and experimentation " for high school and junior college teachers . In 1957 , the program expanded via the National Science Foundation 's post @-@ Sputnik funds for teacher retraining , and Ross let high school students attend . This expansion became the Ross Mathematics Program , a summer mathematics program for gifted high school students . The program lasts eight weeks and brings students with no prior knowledge to topics such as Gaussian integers and quadratic reciprocity . Though the program teaches number theory , by its Gauss @-@ inspired motto , " Think deeply of simple things " , its primary goal is to offer <unk> students an intellectual experience as what he described as " a vivid apprenticeship to a life of exploration " . The program is known for its intensity , and is considered America 's " most rigorous number theory program " , according to What High Schools Don 't Tell You . Ross was known to say , " No one leaves the program unchanged . " 
 The program usually has 40 – 50 first @-@ year students , 15 advanced students , and 15 counselors . Students are admitted by application — which includes a set of mathematical questions — or by showing " a great eagerness to learn " . First @-@ year students meet daily for lectures in elementary number theory and thrice weekly for problem seminars . They are encouraged to think like scientists and devise their own proofs and conjectures to the problems posed , which occupies most of their free time . Ross designed the daily problem sets , and many questions contain his signature directions : " Prove or disprove and salvage if possible . " Successful students are asked to return as students and counselors in future summers . Returning students revisit the daily lectures and help first @-@ years with their questions . They also can take advanced courses such as combinatorics and graduate seminars . Student problem sets are graded daily by the live @-@ in counselors . 
 The program was funded in the 1960s by a National Science Foundation ( NSF ) program that supported summer programs in science education , but not returning students . As NSF support fluctuates , the program has been funded by various means including gifts from donors , scholarships from businesses , a National Security Agency grant , the university , and its mathematics department . It also receives financial support from the Clay Mathematics Institute . 
 The program grew rapidly with input from prominent mathematicians such as Ram Prakash <unk> , Hans <unk> , Thoralf Skolem , and Max Dehn . In the 1960s and 1970s , Ross brought mathematicians including <unk> , Kurt Mahler , and <unk> K. Ray @-@ Chaudhuri to teach there regularly . Ross left Notre Dame to become chair of Ohio State University 's mathematics department in 1963 , and the program followed in the 1964 summer . The program briefly moved to the University of Chicago in the summers of 1975 – 1978 at mathematician Felix Browder 's invitation . The program is unadvertised and depends on personal contacts and word of mouth to propagate . It is recognized by mathematicians as one of the best mathematics programs for high school students . 
 = = Retirement and death = = 
 Ross reached his mandatory retirement from Ohio State University in 1976 , when he became Professor Emeritus , but continued to run the summer program through 2000 , after which he had a stroke that left him physically impaired and unable to teach . Daniel Shapiro led the program upon Ross 's exit . Shapiro was a former counselor at the program . 
 Ross received an honorary doctorate from Denison University in 1984 , the 1985 Mathematics Association of America ( MAA ) Award for Distinguished Service , the 1998 MAA Citation for Public Service , and was named an American Association for the Advancement of Science Fellow in 1988 . His teaching awards include Ohio State 's Distinguished Teaching and Service Awards , and membership on the National Science Foundation 's science education advisory board . 
 Ross helped begin similar programs in West Germany , India , and Australia . He consulted for an Indian gifted children program in 1973 , assisted in an Australian National University January summer program for talented youth based on Ross 's own from 1975 to 1983 , and helped start another program in Heidelberg , Germany in 1978 . He had previously created other mathematics programs , including the teacher training program ( before it included high school students ) and another program for Columbus , Ohio inner city middle and high school students called " Horizons Unlimited " in 1970 . 
 Ross 's wife , Bee , died in 1983 and left Ross in a deep depression . His colleagues said he " lived only for his summer program " in this period . He later met a French widow of a diplomat , Madeleine Green , and they married in 1990 . 
 Ross died on September 25 , 2002 . Notices of the American Mathematical Society and MAA FOCUS ran memorial articles on Ross . Mathematicians such as Karl Rubin expressed their personal debts to Ross . He did not have any children . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Ross 's biggest contribution to his field was not through his research , but through his mathematics education programs . He had run each of his summer programs from 1957 to 2000 , working with over 2 @,@ 000 students . His summer program graduates found roles in prestigious research positions in fields across the sciences . The Ross Program was acclaimed by mathematicians as highly influential . 
 The Ross Program inspired many similar programs , the closest in likeness being Program in Mathematics for Young Scientists ( PROMYS ) at Boston University and the Honors Math Camp at Southwest Texas State University . Other programs at University of Chicago and University of Texas at San Antonio were inspired by Ross . The founders of PROMYS were Ross Program alumni , and when the Ross Program went to the University of Chicago for several years , mathematics chair Paul Sally slowly became supportive of the program and later began his own gifted students program . Informally , Ross Program and Ross 's students are known as " Ross @-@ 1s " and those who study under them ( including PROMYS attendees ) are known as " Ross @-@ 2s " . 
 The Arnold Ross Lecture Series founded in his name in 1993 and run by the American Mathematical Society puts mathematicians before high school audiences annually in cities across the United States . Ohio State University organized two reunion @-@ conferences for Ross with program alumni , friends of Ross , and a series of science lectures , in 1996 and 2001 . 
 = Battle of Kleidion = 
 The Battle of Kleidion ( or <unk> , after the medieval name of the village of Klyuch , " ( the ) key " ; also known as the Battle of Belasitsa ) took place on July 29 , 1014 between the Byzantine Empire and the Bulgarian Empire . It was the culmination of the nearly half @-@ century struggle between the Byzantine Emperor Basil II and the Bulgarian Emperor Samuel in the late 10th and early 11th centuries . The result was a decisive Byzantine victory . 
 The battle took place in the valley between the mountains of Belasitsa and <unk> near the modern Bulgarian village of Klyuch . The decisive encounter occurred on July 29 with an attack in the rear by a force under the Byzantine general Nikephoros Xiphias , who had infiltrated the Bulgarian positions . The ensuing battle was a major defeat for the Bulgarians . Bulgarian soldiers were captured and reputedly blinded by order of Basil II , who would subsequently be known as the " Bulgar @-@ Slayer " . Samuel survived the battle , but died two months later from a heart attack , reportedly brought on by the sight of his blind soldiers . 
 Although the engagement did not end the First Bulgarian Empire , the Battle of Kleidion reduced its ability to resist Byzantine advances and can be considered the pivotal encounter of the war with Byzantium . The heirs of Samuel could not subsequently hold off the Byzantine advance , and in 1018 the Bulgarian Empire was finally destroyed by Basil II . 
 = = Background = = 
 The origins of the conflict date back to the 7th century , when the Bulgars under Khan Asparukh established a state along the Danube in one of the provinces of the Eastern Roman Empire . As a result , the Bulgarian state was forced to fight a series of wars with Byzantium in order to secure its continued existence . 
 In 968 , Bulgaria was invaded from the north by the Kievan Prince Sviatoslav . By that time , the Bulgarian Empire , which had once threatened the existence of Byzantium under the reign of Simeon , had lost much of its power . During the conflict , the Kievan raids were repeatedly defeated by the Byzantines , who were also at war with the Bulgarians , a continuous conflict since the fall of the Bulgarian capital Preslav in 971 . This war had resulted in the Bulgarian Emperor Boris II being forced to renounce his Imperial title in Constantinople , and eastern Bulgaria came under Byzantine rule . The Byzantines assumed that this act would signify the end of independent Bulgaria , but the western Bulgarian lands remained autonomous and under the <unk> brothers David , Moses , Aaron and Samuel , resistance against the Byzantines emerged . 
 When the Byzantine emperor Basil II ascended the throne in 976 , he made the destruction of independent Bulgaria his first ambition . Opposing him were the Western Bulgarians , now led by Samuel of Bulgaria . Basil II 's first campaign was disastrous , the emperor barely escaping with his life when the Bulgarians annihilated the Byzantine army in the Gates of Trajan Pass in 986 . Over the next fifteen years , while Basil was preoccupied with revolts against his rule and the Fatimid threat in the East , Samuel retook most of the previously conquered Bulgarian lands and carried the war into enemy territory in a series of campaigns . However , his invasion of southern Greece , that reached as far as Corinth , resulted in a major defeat in the Battle of <unk> in 996 . The next phase of the war began in 1000 , when Basil , having secured his own position , launched a series of offensives against Bulgaria . He secured Moesia , and in 1003 , his forces took Vidin . The next year , Basil inflicted a heavy defeat on Samuel in the Battle of <unk> . By 1005 , Basil had regained control of Thessaly and parts of southern Macedonia . Over these and the next few years , a regular pattern emerged : the Byzantines would campaign in Bulgaria , laying siege to forts and pillaging the countryside , while the numerically inferior Bulgarians , unable to offer direct opposition , launched diversionary raids in Macedonia and Greece . Despite some successes , these did not achieve any permanent results , nor did they force Basil to abandon his campaigns in Bulgaria . A counter @-@ attack in 1009 failed at the Battle of Kreta , and although the Byzantines themselves did not achieve any decisive success , their methodical war of attrition deprived the Bulgarians of their strongholds and gradually weakened their forces . In the words of Byzantine historian John Skylitzes : " The Emperor Basil II continued to invade Bulgaria each year and destroy and devastate everything on his way . Samuel could not stop him in the open field or engage the Emperor in a decisive battle , and suffered many defeats and began to lose his strength . " The culmination of the war came in 1014 , when Samuel , at the head of his army , resolved to stop the Byzantine army before it could enter the Bulgarian heartland . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 Samuel knew that the Byzantine army would have to invade the country through a series of mountain passes , and so took precautions to bar them . The Bulgarians built ditches along the frontier and fortified many of the valleys and passes with walls and towers , especially the pass of Kleidion on the Struma River which Basil would need to pass through to reach the heart of Bulgaria . Samuel heavily fortified the northern slopes of the Belasitsa mountain to the south and east of Strumitsa Castle . The wide valley of the Strumitsa River was a convenient place for attack and it had been used by Byzantine forces for this purpose in previous years . The Bulgarians disposed a strong guard to keep the pass safe . In addition , the Bulgarian ruler chose Strumitsa for his defensive base — it was located on the road from Thessaloniki leading to Thrace to the east and Ohrid to the west . The rugged terrain to the south was dotted with earthworks and walls guarded by strong Bulgarian units . 
 Samuel 's decision to face Basil II and the bulk of his army at Kleidion was not only prompted by the constant defeats and invasions which had devastated the country , but also by concerns over his authority among the nobility , which had been fatally weakened by Basil 's campaigns . In 1005 for example , the governor of the important Adriatic port of Dyrrhachium had surrendered the town to Basil II . To face this threat , Samuel gathered a large army to face the Byzantines , some claiming it numbered as many as 45 @,@ 000 soldiers . Basil II also prepared carefully , assembling a large army of his own and taking his most experienced commanders , including the governor of Philippopolis ( modern Plovdiv ) , Nicephorus Xiphias , who had conquered the old Bulgarian capitals Pliska and Preslav from Samuel in 1001 . 
 = = Battle = = 
 The Byzantine army marched from Constantinople through Komotini , Drama and Serres and reached the Rupel gorge on the Struma river . From there the army entered the Strumitsa valley and reached the vicinity of the village of Klyuch , where the river bent and approached Belasitsa and <unk> . There the army was stopped by a thick wooden wall , defended by Bulgarian soldiers . The Byzantines attacked the palisade immediately , but were repulsed with heavy casualties . 
 In response , Samuel sent a large army under one of the most able Bulgarian nobles , <unk> , to strike southwards and draw the attention of Basil away from the siege at Klyuch . <unk> 's Bulgarians reached Thessalonika , but Byzantine troops under Theophylact Botaneiates , the strategos ( Governor @-@ General ) of the city and his son Mihail managed to defeat them outside the city walls in a bloody battle . <unk> captured many soldiers and a large quantity of military equipment and marched north to join Basil II at Klyuch . 
 Basil II 's first attempt to overwhelm the defenders of the pass was unsuccessful and his army was unable to pass through the valley , which was defended by 15 @,@ 000 – 20 @,@ 000 Bulgarians . Despite the difficulties the Byzantine Emperor did not abandon the attack . He ordered his general Nicephorus Xiphias to manoeuvre his troops around the high Belasitsa mountain and surround the Bulgarians , while he continued the assaults on the wall . Xiphias led his troops along a steep path that led him into the Bulgarians ' rear . On July 29 , Xiphias attacked the guards , trapping them in the valley . The Bulgarian soldiers abandoned their towers to face this new threat and Basil was able to break through the front line and destroy the wall . 
 In the confusion of the rout , thousands of Bulgarian troops were killed and the remainder desperately attempted to flee westwards . Samuel and his son Gabriel Radomir immediately headed to the east from their headquarters in the Strumitsa fortress to aid their army , but in desperate fighting near the village of <unk> ( present @-@ day Republic of Macedonia ) they were overwhelmed by the quickly advancing enemy . Many Bulgarian soldiers were killed at <unk> and many more were captured . Emperor Samuel himself barely escaped , only breaking free through the bravery of his son , who mounted his father on his own horse and took him to safety in Prilep . From Prilep , Samuel returned to Prespa while Gabriel Radomir headed towards Strumitsa to continue the struggle . 
 = = Further developments = = 
 After his victory , Basil II advanced towards Strumitsa , which was key to holding the whole Vardar valley . On their way to the city , the Byzantines seized the <unk> fortress to the east of their advance . The Byzantine Emperor also sent an army under Botaneiates to surround Strumitsa and destroy all ramparts to the south and clear the passage to Thessalonica . With the remainder of his troops , Basil laid siege to the city itself . The Bulgarians allowed Botaneiates to destroy the fortifications , but he and his army were ambushed by Bulgarian raiders in a narrow valley , soon after their task was complete . In the ensuing battle Botaneiates was completely defeated and the Bulgarian commander Gabriel Radomir personally stabbed Botaneiates with his spear . As a result , Basil II was forced to abandon the siege of Strumitsa and retreat . On the return , the eloquence of the <unk> Sergius convinced the defenders of Melnik to surrender , another heavy blow for the Bulgarians as the town guarded the main road to Sofia from the south . 
 = = = Prisoners = = = 
 Skylitzes records that Basil completely routed the Bulgarian army and took 15 @,@ 000 prisoners ( 14 @,@ 000 according to Kekaumenos ) . Modern historians however , such as Vasil Zlatarski , claim that these numbers are exaggerated . The 14th century Bulgarian translation of the Manasses Chronicle numbers the prisoners at 8 @,@ 000 . Basil divided the prisoners into groups of 100 men , blinded 99 men in each group and left one man in each with one eye so that he could lead the others home ; this was done in retaliation for the death of Botaneiates , who was Basil 's favourite general and advisor , and also to crush the Bulgarian morale . Another possible reason was that , in Byzantine eyes , the Bulgarians were rebels against their authority , and blinding was the usual punishment meted out to rebels . For this action , Basil gained the nickname <unk> ( Greek : <unk> ) , " the Bulgar @-@ slayer " . Samuel died of a heart attack on October 6 , 1014 , reportedly due to seeing his soldiers blinded . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The death of Botaneiates and the four more years of war that followed indicate that the Byzantine success was not complete . Some modern historians doubt that the Bulgarian defeat was as complete as described by Skylitzes and Kekaumenos . Other historians emphasize that the death of Emperor Samuel two months later was much more fateful for Bulgaria . His heirs Gabriel Radomir and Ivan Vladislav were unable to effectively resist the attacks of Basil II , and Bulgaria was completely defeated in 1018 . In that year Emperor Ivan Vladislav was killed in a battle at Dyrrhachium , and Bulgaria became a province of the Byzantine Empire until the successful uprising led by the Asen brothers in 1185 . 
 Other theses in the historiography stress the significance of the battle . As a result of the battle of Belasitsa , the Bulgarian army suffered heavy casualties that could not be restored . The ability of the central government to control the peripheral and interior provinces of the Empire was reduced and the actions of the local and provincial governors became more decisive for the outcome of the war with Byzantium . Many of them voluntarily surrendered to Basil II . 
 The battle also had an impact on the Serbs and the Croats , who were forced to acknowledge the supremacy of the Byzantine Emperor after 1018 . The borders of the Byzantine Empire were restored to the Danube for the first time since the 7th century , allowing Byzantium to control the entire Balkan peninsula from the Danube to the Peloponnese and from the Adriatic Sea to the Black Sea .

 Jack Donaghy ( Alec Baldwin ) distracts himself from his romantic problems involving the choice between CNBC host Avery Jessup ( Elizabeth Banks ) and his high school sweetheart Nancy Donovan ( Julianne Moore ) by attempting to resolve a dispute between two janitors , Subhas ( Subhas Ramsaywack ) and Khonani ( Kapil Bawa ) . Five years ago , Khonani signed a contract to take the 11 : 30 p.m. janitorial shift from Subhas and informs Jack that he is ready to start at the new time . Jack grants him permission , and calls a meeting with Subhas informing him that Khonani will take over the 11 : 30 shift . Subhas is not happy with this , so Jack decides to move him to 10 : 00 p.m. , which Subhas has no problem with . As he begins his scheduled shift , Khonani is unhappy with it as there is no trash to pick up because Subhas has already collected it . Khonani complains to Jack about this , resulting in Jack returning Subhas to 11 : 30 , and Khonani leaving NBC to work at Foxwoods Resort Casino . 
 Meanwhile , Liz Lemon ( Tina Fey ) is distraught to learn that although her writing staff sometimes hang out after work , they never invite her . She tells Jack — her boss — about this , however , Jack explains that it is best for her to keep her distance from them . Later , Liz 's assistant Cerie Xerox ( Katrina Bowden ) announces that her wedding is back on and that Liz and Jenna Maroney ( Jane Krakowski ) need to plan a bachelorette party for her . Liz decides to have the party at her apartment and prove to her employees — who are invited — that she can be fun to be with . At the bachelorette party , staff members Pete Hornberger ( Scott Adsit ) , Frank Rossitano ( Judah Friedlander ) , James " Toofer " Spurlock ( Keith Powell ) and J. D.

 The main plot regarding the two janitors — Subhas and Khonani — battling for the late @-@ night shift at 11 : 30 p.m. closely mirrored the feud between television hosts Jay Leno and Conan O 'Brien over the hosting job of The Tonight Show . Similar to the feud , in this 30 Rock episode , Khonani signed a contract five years ago to take over the 11 : 30 p.m. from Subhas and asked Jack Donaghy to make it happen , which Jack does . In September 2004 , it was announced by the NBC network that Jay Leno would be succeeded by Conan O 'Brien in 2009 as host of The Tonight Show . Five years later , Leno would host his final episode of The Tonight Show in May 2009 ; similarly , Jack informs Subhas that Khonani will take over that shift . Subhas is not thrilled with this , resulting in Jack moving Subhas to the 10 : 00 shift ; O 'Brien took over as host of The Tonight Show in June 2009 . NBC , afraid of losing Leno to another network , gave him a new nightly prime time series , The Jay Leno Show , which premiered in September 2009 at 10 : 00 p.m. In " Khonani " , as he begins his shift , Khonani is unhappy as there is no trash to pick up as it already has been collected by Subhas . As a result , Subhas goes back to the 11 : 30 shift , and Khonani leaves NBC to continue his janitorial duties at Foxwoods Resort Casino . The Jay Leno Show debuted to good ratings , however , as the show continued it would garner low ratings , resulting in NBC proposing that the show air at 11 : 35 p.m. and that The Tonight Show be moved to 12 : 05 . O 'Brien , however , rejected the timeslot . In January 2010 , O 'Brien reached a deal with the network that would see him leave The Tonight Show on January 22 , 2010 , and two months later Leno returned as host of The Tonight Show on March 1 , 2010 . In April 2010 , O 'Brien signed a deal with the cable network TBS to host a new late @-@ night talk show . 
 Lorne Michaels , who is the executive producer of 30 Rock and who used to produce Late Night with Conan O 'Brien , was O 'Brien 's mentor . Michaels told The Hollywood Reporter in March 2010 that O 'Brien would " prevail " from his departure of The Tonight Show . In addition , O 'Brien appeared as himself on 30 Rock 's first season episode " Tracy Does Conan " that was broadcast on December 6 , 2006 . 
 Despite not appearing in the episode , the show made reference of Jack 's love triangle storyline with Avery Jessup and Nancy Donovan , played by actresses Elizabeth Banks and Julianne Moore , respectively . This plot was first introduced in the previous episode , " Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter " . The Jack characters love dilemma would continue throughout the season . Moore was announced as a love interest for Alec Baldwin 's television character in November 2009 , while Banks ' guest spot as a love interest for the Jack character was confirmed in December 2009 . 
 30 Rock executive producer and co @-@ showrunner Robert Carlock was asked in a 2009 interview if Frank Rossitano ( Judah Friedlander ) , Toofer Spurlock ( Keith Powell ) , and J.D. Lutz ( John Lutz ) — the staff writers of the fictitious show The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan ( TGS ) — were going to be seen more in the upcoming season , to which he replied , " One of the great things about this show and the blessing and the curse is that we have so many characters and so many different interactions between characters that work so well . [ ... ] And so , yeah , absolutely because we love those guys " . In this episode , Liz Lemon , the head writer for TGS , discovers that Frank , Toofer , and Lutz , along with Pete , do not invite her to hang out with them as they consider her a mother figure .

Willa Paskin of New York magazine wrote had the show make reference to the Leno and O 'Brien debacle a few months ago " this would have been a cutting @-@ edge satire ... Now , not so much . " Jason Hughes of TV Squad remarked that the writing in " Khonani " was sharp , though added that " for some reason " the episode " didn 't ring nearly as sharp or funny as many others . I think it was a lot of unfulfilled potential . " Sean Gandert of Paste magazine deemed this episode disappointing , but proclaimed " it was still entertaining enough . " 
 James Poniewozik of Time observed , " NBC 's public troubles have been 30 Rock 's greatest blessing this season , providing it with satiric fodder from The Jay Leno Show to the Comcast acquisition . The show may not be the best sitcom on TV now , but it 's definitely the best work of NBC @-@ criticism . " In regards to the main plot , he said it " could have done even more with the premise of the <unk> re @-@ enacted with janitors , but it gets a lot of credit for the inspired idea . " IGN contributor Robert Canning gave the episode an 8 @.@ 3 out of 10 rating , writing that the janitor plot " came at a perfect time " in regards to the Leno and O 'Brien controversy . He , however , did not like the other two plots , noting they were " less impressive " . Meredith Blake from the Los Angeles Times said that the Khonani and Subhas plot was " supremely clever and self @-@ referential " , and that the show 's take on it was " decidedly neutral , albeit very funny " .

 The 113th Boat Race took place on 30 March 1967 . Held annually , the event is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames .

 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities , followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having won the previous year 's race by three @-@ and @-@ three @-@ quarter lengths . Cambridge , however , held the overall lead with 61 victories to Oxford 's 50 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . 
 The first Women 's Boat Race took place in 1927 , but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s . Until 2014 , the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races , but as of the 2015 race , it is held on the River Thames , on the same day as the men 's main and reserve races . The reserve race , contested between Oxford 's Isis boat and Cambridge 's Goldie boat has been held since 1965 . It usually takes place on the Tideway , prior to the main Boat Race . 
 The race was umpired by George Douglas " Jock " Clapperton who had coxed Oxford in the 1923 and 1924 races as well as umpiring in the 1959 boat race . 
 Cambridge 's coaching team included Norman Addison ( rowed for Cambridge in the 1939 race ) , James Crowden ( 1951 and 1952 races ) , David Jennens ( 1949 , 1950 and 1951 races ) , Mike Muir @-@ Smith ( 1964 race ) , Mike Nicholson ( non @-@ rowing boat club president for the 1947 race ) , J. R. Owen ( 1959 and 1960 races ) and M. Wolfson while Oxford 's comprised Hugh " Jumbo " Edwards ( rowed for Oxford in the 1926 and 1930 races ) and Ronnie Howard ( 1957 and 1959 races ) .

 Oxford won the toss for the third successive year and elected to start from the Surrey station , handing the Middlesex side of the river to Cambridge . The race commenced at <unk> Despite the conditions favouring the Light Blues , Oxford were ahead from the start and led by two seconds the Mile Post in a record @-@ equalling time of 3 minutes 47 seconds . According to Legget , Cambridge " were untidy and rather rushed " . Near Harrods Furniture Depository , the crews nearly clashed oars , but Oxford held firm and reached Hammersmith Bridge with a three @-@ second lead . Rounding the corner , Cambridge chose to stay on the tide , while Oxford headed for shelter towards the Surrey shore . The Light Blues reduced the lead marginally but by Chiswick Steps , Oxford were six seconds ahead and moved back to the Middlesex shore , with Cambridge resolute in midstream . Oxford briefly left the shelter of the shoreline to shoot Barnes Bridge through the centre arch , before heading back , with a lead of eight seconds . Despite pushing their rating to 36 strokes per minute , Cambridge could not reduce the deficit , and as Oxford accelerated to a rating of 38 , they passed the finishing post three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths ahead , in a time of 18 minutes 52 seconds . It was the first time in 54 years that Oxford had won three consecutive Boat Races . Upon the conclusion of the race , the Oxford boat club president Mullard hailed his coaches from the boat : " Thanks Ronnie , thanks Jumbo " . 
 In the reserve race , Cambridge 's Goldie beat Oxford 's Isis by two lengths and five seconds , their inaugural victory on the third running of the contest , in a time of 19 minutes 11 seconds . In the 22nd running of the Women 's Boat Race , Cambridge triumphed , their fifth consecutive victory . 
 = Flying Blind , Flying Safe = 
 Flying Blind , Flying Safe is a non @-@ fiction book about the American airline industry and Federal Aviation Administration , written by Mary Schiavo with Sabra Chartrand . The book was first published in March 1997 in hardcover format by Avon Books . An updated paperback edition was published on April 1 , 1998 . Schiavo is a former Inspector General of the United States Department of Transportation , and Chartrand a journalist for The New York Times . Schiavo was Inspector General of the United States Department of Transportation for six years , and resigned in 1996 shortly after the ValuJet Flight 592 airline crash in the Florida Everglades . She became a whistleblower and was highly critical of the airline industry and its relationship with aviation safety agencies in the United States federal government . 
 The book is structured into two sections . The first portion of the book is critical of the aviation industry and the U.S. government agencies tasked with inspecting it . The second portion of the book addresses consumers and potential airline passengers . The book became successful shortly after publication . It reached number 10 on the New York Times Best Seller list and number 9 on a Chicago Tribune list of bestsellers in early April 1997 . Most reviews of the book in media publications were positive . Some individuals within the airline industry claimed the book contained factual inaccuracies , and this was investigated as part of a class project at George Washington University . 
 = = Authors = = 
 Mary Schiavo was raised in Williams County , Ohio , and received her pilot 's license while studying in her first two years of college at Ohio State University ( OSU ) . She obtained a bachelor 's degree from Harvard University , and a master 's degree in public administration from OSU . She has a law degree from New York University , and has worked as a federal prosecutor . Schiavo served as Inspector General of the United States Department of Transportation from 1990 to July 1996 . 
 Schiavo resigned from her position at the U.S. Department of Transportation in order to blow the whistle on what she saw as deficiencies in safety practices by the federal government 's oversight of the airline industry . She was publicly critical of high @-@ ranking U.S. aviation officials regarding the ValuJet Flight 592 passenger jet crash in the Florida Everglades which resulted in the deaths of all 110 people aboard . Schiavo appeared on ABC 's Nightline program the night after the crash and was highly critical of FAA safety inspections methods . After resigning her position as Inspector General Schiavo taught courses at Ohio State University , and in April 1997 she joined the staff of Ohio State University in the position of <unk> Executive @-@ in @-@ Residence . 
 Co @-@ writer Sabra Chartrand graduated from the University of Washington , and reported for Reuters and Israel Radio in Tel Aviv , Israel . She later joined The New York Times as a journalist with their Jerusalem bureau . After Flying Blind , Flying Safe , she co @-@ wrote Black And White on Wall Street , The Untold Story of the Man <unk> Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody with former Kidder , Peabody & Co. bond trader Joseph Jett . 
 = = Contents = = 
 The first portion of the book is a critique of deficiencies in safety practices by the Federal Aviation Administration and United States Department of Transportation , and the inherent problems with the closeness between these agencies and the airline industry . The book is an exposé of what Schiavo saw as fraud , corruption , waste , mismanagement , and dangerous negligence in the aviation industry and the FAA as a crusader for flight safety . Her primary criticisms in the book focus on the FAA 's reluctance to address its many shortcomings , while expressing her concern that there was a fundamental conflict of interest between the FAA job of oversight and the FAA job of promoting aviation . 
 Schiavo describes how the FAA uses a formula ascribing specific monetary value to human lives , and how the agency allows numbers to decide whether the cost of extra safety is worth the additional expense . For example , if equipping an airline fleet with smoke detectors would cost $ 100 million , but would only save 10 lives each worth $ 1 million , then the expense is ruled out . Schiavo is similarly critical of the internal FAA politics and the FAA 's administrators . 
 The last 145 pages of the book is addressed to passengers , to help them determine which airlines have good safety records and how to better ensure safe travel while flying . Schiavo discusses the average ages of certain airline fleets , reveals the accident rates of the major airline carriers , safety ratings at national airlines , bomb detection rates at U.S. airports , and provides a list of airports where power failures have affected the effectiveness of control towers . She concludes with a list of recommendations for how individuals can effect change at government agencies including the FAA , and how to address concerns of conflict of interest between air safety and inspection and the airline industry .

 Flying Blind , Flying Safe reached number 10 on the New York Times Best Seller list on April 6 , 1997 , and remained on the list through June 1997 . On April 13 , 1997 the book was ranked 9th on the Chicago Tribune list of bestsellers for hardback non @-@ fiction . 
 Christina Del Valle reviewed the book for BusinessWeek , and wrote : " Flying Blind , Flying Safe is an incisive primer on what ails the aviation industry and the feds ' regulation of it " . A subsequent article in BusinessWeek highlighted the book among " The Best Business Books of 1997 " . In a review in The Washington Post , Judy Mann called the book " a scathing -- and frightening -- indictment of the FAA , the multibillion @-@ dollar airline industry and its lapdogs in Congress " . James T. <unk> of The Washington Post called the book " frightening " and " informative " , and wrote that " passengers should have this kind of safety information when choosing a flight . " In a review for The Virginian @-@ Pilot , Michael <unk> wrote : " She may be to the airplane what Ralph Nader was to the automobile . " Bill Wallace gave the book a favorable review in the San Francisco Chronicle , and wrote : " Part memoir , part expose , her book gives an inside view of how the FAA does its job of regulating air travel -- and how it frequently fails . " R.J. <unk> gave the book a positive recommendation in a review for The San Diego Union @-@ Tribune , and commented : " Mary Schiavo 's candid evaluation of the Federal Aviation Administration , airport security and air traffic controllers will give even the occasional flier some apprehension . Still , it should be read . " 
 Carl Marbach of <unk> wrote positively of the first portion of the book , but was critical of the latter half : " On the whole , the book has some worthwhile sections notwithstanding the soap opera ramblings at the end . Read the first half , then pass it along to another pilot @-@ friend . " John Clark of The Plain Dealer gave the book a positive review , but was also critical of the instructive section at the end of the book : " Narratively , the book breaks down when Schiavo resorts to lists and tables to provide information to help the reader fly more safely . " Robert W. Poole Jr. reviewed the book for Reason , and called it " valuable and frustrating " . Poole noted " Only an outsider @-@ insider like Schiavo could provide ordinary people with authentic accounts of how badly off @-@ track the FAA has gotten in its job of looking after aviation safety , " but commented that some aviation veterans regarded her as a " loose cannon " . Jerry Fraser of The Boston Globe was critical in his review of the book , and wrote that " a book that sets out to be ' everything you need to know to travel safer by air ' winds up griping about how the FAA reimburses employees for moving expenses and conducts crude management @-@ training seminars " . The book received a critical review from Bill Adair in the St. Petersburg Times , who wrote : " Schiavo is right about many problems at the FAA . ... But Schiavo seems unable to offer a calm and constructive account of the FAA 's problems . She 'd rather grab headlines with wild and often inaccurate comments . " 
 Many in the airline industry were critical of the book , and asserted that it contained factual inaccuracies . In 1998 , Instructor Darryl Jenkins of George Washington University decided to assign a class project in a graduate course he was teaching on airline economics for students to fact @-@ check statements made by Schiavo in the book . Edmund Pinto , a former Federal Aviation Administration spokesman and publisher of the newsletter Aviation Daily , later co @-@ authored a report with Jenkins on their findings . In some instances the authors agreed with Schiavo 's conclusions , but argued that what they saw as discrepancies detracted from Schiavo 's position . In response Schiavo commented that the report by Jenkins and Pinto was " hardly the sort of unbiased reporting which warrants my response " , and an article on the matter in The Washington Post noted that : " Jenkins occasionally does economic consulting work for airlines and for airline unions , but he said he took on the book project on his own .

 = Geist und Seele wird verwirret , BWV 35 = 
 Geist und Seele wird verwirret ( Spirit and soul become confused ) , BWV 35 , is a church cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach . He composed the solo cantata for alto voice in Leipzig for the twelfth Sunday after Trinity and first performed it on 8 September 1726 . 
 Bach composed the cantata in his fourth year as Thomaskantor ( musical director ) in Leipzig . The text is based on the day 's prescribed reading from the Gospel of Mark , the healing of a deaf mute man . The librettist is Georg Christian Lehms , whose poetry Bach had used already in Weimar as the basis for solo cantatas . The text quotes ideas from the gospel and derives from these the analogy that as the tongue of the deaf mute man was opened , the believer should be open to admire God 's miraculous deeds . The cantatas for this Sunday have a positive character , which Bach stressed in earlier works for the occasion by including trumpets in the score . In this work , he uses instead an obbligato solo organ in several movements . 
 The cantata is structured in seven movements in two parts , to be performed before and after the sermon . Both parts are opened by an instrumental sinfonia with solo organ , probably derived from concerto music composed earlier in Weimar or Köthen . The alto singer performs a sequence of alternating arias and recitatives , accompanied in all three arias by the organ as an equal partner . The orchestra is formed by two oboes , taille , strings and basso continuo . The alto part is demanding and was probably written with a specific singer in mind , as with the two other solo cantatas composed in the same period . 
 = = History and words = = 
 Bach composed the cantata in his fourth year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig for the twelfth Sunday after Trinity . It is regarded as part of his third annual cantata cycle . 
 The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the Second Epistle to the Corinthians , the ministry of the Spirit ( 2 Corinthians 3 : 4 – 11 ) , and from the Gospel of Mark , the healing of a deaf mute man ( Mark 7 : 31 – 37 ) . The cantata text was written by Georg Christian Lehms and published in Gottgefälliges Kirchen @-@ Opffer ( 1711 ) . The text connects the healing of the deaf man to the thoughts of the believer who is left deaf and mute in awe looking at the healing of Jesus and God 's creation . The text of the second aria is almost a quote of the gospel 's last verse . 
 Because of the requirements that " new music " be composed as often as possible , Bach seldom chose older poems for his cantatas ; consequently , the conductor Craig Smith has suggested that parts of this work may have been composed earlier than the first recorded Leipzig performance . Bach had already composed his first solo cantata on a text by Lehms , Widerstehe doch der Sünde , BWV 54 , composed during his tenure in Weimar , also for an alto soloist . 
 The cantata is one of three Bach cantatas written in Leipzig in 1726 in which an alto is the only vocal soloist , the others being Vergnügte Ruh , beliebte Seelenlust , BWV 170 , and Gott soll allein mein Herze haben , BWV 169 . It seems likely that Bach had a capable alto singer at his disposal during this period . 
 Bach had earlier composed two other cantatas for the twelfth Sunday after Trinity , in his first year in Leipzig Lobe den Herrn , meine Seele , BWV <unk> , first performed on 15 August 1723 , and in his third year Lobe den Herren , den <unk> König der Ehren , BWV 137 , first performed on 19 August 1725 , as an added part of his cycle of chorale cantatas . Both works focus on praise ( Lob ) and use an orchestra including festive trumpets . 
 Furthermore , the work has two large concerto movements for organ and orchestra , probably from a lost concerto for keyboard , oboe or violin , perhaps indicating that the cantata was composed for a seasonal choral absentia at Thomaskirche . The first nine bars of the opening sinfonia are practically identical to the fragment BWV 1059 . 
 Bach led the first performance on 8 September 1726 , and probably played the organ part himself . 
 = = Scoring and structure = = 
 Bach structured the cantata in two parts , four movements to be performed before the sermon , three after the sermon . Both parts begin with a sinfonia . Bach scored it for an alto soloist , two oboes ( Ob ) , taille ( Ot ) , obbligato solo organ ( Org ) , two violins ( Vl ) , viola ( Va ) , and basso continuo ( Bc ) . 
 In the following table of the movements , the scoring follows the Neue Bach @-@ Ausgabe . The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred Dürr , using the symbol for common time ( 4 / 4 ) . The instruments are shown separately for winds , strings , and organ and continuo .

 John Eliot Gardiner , who conducted this work on the twelfth Sunday after Trinity in St. Jakob , Köthen as part of the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage with the Monteverdi Choir in 2000 , calls the occasion " one of the most cheerful programmes of the whole Trinity season " , leading Bach to compose " celebratory pieces " , two with trumpets and timpani , and finally this one with an obbligato organ . In an expanded two @-@ part structure , the organ is both an instrumental soloist in the two sinfonias and a partner for the singer in all three arias . The musicologist Laurence Dreyfus distinguished Bach 's use of the organ as " sacred icon " versus " <unk> conversationalist " , writing on Bach 's " assimilation of the secular solo concerto into his church cantatas and his adjustment of the normal concerto principle , that of soloist @-@ versus @-@ orchestra , through subtle shifts in role playing , the instrument now posing as a soloist , now retreating into the background . "

 The opening allegro sinfonia incorporates concerto techniques , suggesting an origin in a pre @-@ existing concerto . The organ performs both the solo melody and the continuo line , punctuated by quasi @-@ cadenza passages and interspersed ten @-@ measure ritornellos . The musicologist Klaus Hofmann notes that in the movement in Italian style , the theme is " subjected to intensive thematic working @-@ out in the dialogue between solo instrument and orchestra " . 
 = = = 2 = = = 
 The first aria in da capo form , " Geist und Seele wird verwirret " ( Spirit and soul become confused ) , is characterized by a broken ritornello and a sense of confusion and uncertainty . The rhythm is siciliano , a frequent feature in slow concerto movements by Bach and others . Hofmann concludes from many corrections in Bach 's autograph that the aria is a new composition . He sees the " agility of the organ part which does not follow the siciliano pattern " as an image of the " confusion " mentioned in the text . 
 = = = 3 = = = 
 A secco recitative , " Ich <unk> mich " ( I am amazed ) , expresses awe at the creation , rendered in the first person which according to Mincham underlines the cantata 's " personal and individual emphasis " . Beginning in a major mode which contrasts with the preceding aria , it turns to " the solemnity of the minor mode " . 
 = = = 4 = = = 
 An aria with obbligato organ , " Gott hat alles <unk> " ( God has made everything well ) , is the first movement in a major mode , expressing pleasure with God 's creation . It has a dominating two @-@ part ritornello . Hofmann observes that the organ , this time the only partner of the voice , is " rich in coloratura " and has a theme , " heard throughout the movement , sometimes in the manner of an ostinato , sometimes freely developed ; in its figuration and motoric drive it is stylized just like Bach ’ s writing for the violoncello piccolo " . Gardiner notes that not only the tessitura but also " characteristic string @-@ crossing patterns " are reminiscent of violoncello piccolo use . 
 = = = 5 = = = 
 Part 2 begins with another sinfonia , this time in binary form . Hofmann describes it as " an engaging perpetuum mobile introduced by the keyboard " . It may be based on the final movement of a concerto . The organ interacts with the orchestra without a prelude , which is unusual in Bach 's concertos , but not without precedent , such as the harpsichord concerto in F major , BWV 1057 
 = = = 6 = = = 
 Another secco recitative , " Ach , starker Gott , laß mich " ( Ah , powerful God , let me [ think upon this continually ] ) , is a prayer for the ability to always reflect on the miracle of creation . It quotes Jesus saying " <unk> " ( Be opened ) to the deaf mute man , and turns it to " the believer 's heart would open up and his tongue would be loosened so that he might perceive and praise the divine miracles " . 
 = = = 7 = = = 
 The cantata concludes with an aria with the complete orchestra , " Ich <unk> nur bei Gott zu leben " ( I wish to live with God alone ) . It expresses the wish to dwell with God forever in a minuet of positive character . The movement again uses a two @-@ part ritornello . When contrasting aspects of life on earth are mentioned , such as " <unk> <unk> " ( sorrowful yoke of pain ) and " <unk> Leben " ( tormented life ) , the music darkens to minor keys . The organ supplies triplet figures , which the voice also uses to express " ein <unk> Halleluja " ( a joyful hallelujah ) .

 = Murder of Victoria Climbié = 
 In 2000 in London , an eight @-@ year @-@ old Ivorian girl , Victoria <unk> Climbié ( 2 November 1991 – 25 February 2000 ) , was tortured and murdered by her guardians . Her death led to a public inquiry and produced major changes in child protection policies in the United Kingdom . 
 Born in Abobo , Côte d ’ Ivoire , Climbié left the country with her great @-@ aunt Marie @-@ Thérèse Kouao , a French citizen , for an education in France , where they travelled , before arriving in London in April 1999 . It is not known exactly when Kouao started abusing Climbié , although it is suspected to have worsened when Kouao and Climbié met and moved in with Carl Manning , who became Kouao 's boyfriend . During the abuse , Climbié was burnt with cigarettes , tied up for periods of longer than 24 hours , and hit with bike chains , hammers and wires . Up to her death , the police , the social services department of four local authorities , the National Health Service , the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children ( NSPCC ) , and local churches all had contact with her , and noted the signs of abuse . However , in what the judge in the trial following Climbié 's death described as " blinding incompetence " , all failed to properly investigate the case and little action was taken . Kouao and Manning were convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment . 
 After Climbié 's death , the parties involved in her case were widely criticised . A public inquiry , headed by Lord Laming , was ordered . It discovered numerous instances where Climbié could have been saved , noted that many of the organisations involved in her care were badly run , and discussed the racial aspects surrounding the case , as many of the participants were black . The subsequent report by Laming made numerous recommendations related to child protection in England . Climbié 's death was largely responsible for the formation of the Every Child Matters initiative ; the introduction of the Children Act 2004 ; the creation of the ContactPoint project , a government database designed to hold information on all children in England ( now defunct after closure by the government of 2010 ) ; and the creation of the Office of the Children 's Commissioner chaired by the Children 's Commissioner for England . 
 = = Life = = 
 Victoria Climbié was born on 2 November 1991 in Abobo near Abidjan , Ivory Coast , the fifth of seven children . Her parents were Francis Climbié and his wife Berthe <unk> . Marie @-@ Thérèse Kouao , Francis ' aunt , was born on 17 July 1956 in <unk> , Ivory Coast and lived in France with her three sons , claiming welfare benefits . She divorced her former husband in 1978 and he died in 1995 . Kouao was attending her brother 's funeral in the Ivory Coast when she visited the Climbié family in October 1998 . She informed them that she wanted to take a child back to France with her and arrange for their education ; this sort of informal <unk> is common in the family 's society . Victoria Climbié was apparently happy to be chosen , and although her parents had only met Kouao a few times , they were satisfied with the arrangements . 
 From that point onwards , Kouao pretended that Climbié was her daughter . Kouao had originally planned to take another young girl called Anna Kouao , but Anna 's parents changed their minds . Climbié travelled on a French passport in the name of Anna Kouao and was known as Anna throughout her life in the United Kingdom . It is not known exactly when Kouao started abusing Climbié . Climbié 's parents received three messages about her from when she left them until her death , all saying she was in good health . 
 Kouao and Climbié left the Ivory Coast possibly in November 1998 and flew to Paris , France , where Climbié enrolled at school . By December 1998 , however , Kouao began to receive warnings about Climbié 's absenteeism , and in February 1999 , the school issued a child @-@ at @-@ risk notification and a social worker became involved . The school observed how Climbié tended to fall asleep in class , and the headteacher later recalled Kouao mentioning Climbié suffering from some form of dermatological condition and that , on her last visit to the school on 25 March 1999 , Climbié had a shaven head and was wearing a wig . When they left France , Kouao owed the authorities £ 2 @,@ 000 , after being wrongly paid in child benefit , and it is claimed that Kouao viewed Climbié as a useful tool for claiming benefits . Kouao had also been evicted from her home in France because of rent arrears . 
 = = = United Kingdom = = = 
 On 24 April 1999 , Kouao and Victoria Climbié left France and travelled to the United Kingdom , where they settled in Ealing , west London . They had a reservation in a bed and breakfast at Twyford Crescent , Acton , where they lived until 1 May 1999 , when they moved to Nicoll Road , Harlesden , in the London Borough of Brent . On 25 April 1999 , Kouao and Climbié visited Esther Ackah , a distant relative of Kouao by marriage , and a midwife , counsellor and preacher . Ackah and her daughter noted that Climbié was wearing a wig and looked small and frail . On 26 April 1999 , Kouao and Climbié visited the Homeless Persons ' Unit of Ealing Council , where they were seen by Julie Winter , a homeless persons ' officer . Together , Kouao and Winter completed a housing application form . Kouao explained that Climbié was wearing a wig because she had short hair , an explanation accepted by Winter . Although Winter was shown Climbié 's passport ( with a photograph of Anna ) , she paid no attention to them , believing that Kouao 's application was ineligible on the grounds of habitual residence . Winter confirmed her decision with her duty senior and told Kouao that she was not eligible for housing . She telephoned the referral across to Pamela Fortune , a social worker in Ealing 's Acton referral and assessment team . She did not produce a written or electronic documentation of the referral , however , something which would have helped in double @-@ checking the accounts that Kouao gave . 
 Between 26 April and early July 1999 , Kouao visited Ealing social services 18 times for housing and financial purposes . Climbié was with her on at least ten occasions . The staff there noted Climbié 's unkempt appearance , with one staff member , Deborah Gaunt , thinking that she looked like a child from an ActionAid advertisement . However , they did not take any action and may have assumed that Climbié 's appearance was a purposeful attempt to " persuade the authorities to hand out money " . On 8 June 1999 , Kouao got a job at Northwick Park Hospital . During her first month , no effort was made by Kouao or Ealing social services to enroll Climbié in educational or daycare activities . 
 On 8 June 1999 , Kouao took Climbié to a local GP surgery . The practice nurse there did not carry out a physical examination as she was not reported to have any current health problems . By the middle of June 1999 , Climbié was spending the majority of her days at the Brent home of Priscilla Cameron , an unregistered <unk> , who Kouao met at her job at the hospital . There is no evidence that Climbié was treated badly during her time with Cameron . On several occasions , Cameron observed small cuts to Climbié 's fingers . When questioned by Cameron , Kouao said that they were caused by razor blades that Climbié played with . Kouao and Climbié met Ackah on the street on or around 14 June 1999 . In what may have been early signs of deliberate physical harm , Ackah noted a scar on Climbié 's cheek , which Kouao said was caused by a fall on an escalator . On 17 June 1999 , in response to what she had seen three days earlier , Ackah visited Kouao and Climbié 's home , and thought that the accommodation was unsuitable . 
 On 18 June 1999 , Ackah anonymously telephoned Brent social services , expressing concern over Climbié 's situation . Samantha Hunt , the customer @-@ service officer who received the call at the One Stop Shop at Brent House , faxed the referral to the children 's social work department on that same day . Nobody picked up the referral on that Friday afternoon , and what happened to it was — according to Lord Laming , who headed the subsequent inquiry — the subject of " some of the most bizarre and contradictory evidence " the inquiry heard . A few days later , possibly on 21 June 1999 , Ackah phoned Brent social services again to make sure her concerns were being addressed . Ackah said that she was told by the person on the other end of the telephone that " probably they [ social services ] had done something about it " . This call , however , did not trigger a new , separate referral . The first referral was not seen until three weeks later on 6 July 1999 , when Robert Smith , the group administrative officer , logged the details of the referral onto the computer , with details of Climbié 's injuries . Laming said the delay constituted " a significant missed opportunity " to protect Climbié . Edward Armstrong , the team manager of the intake duty team , said that he completed a duty manager 's action sheet not for the 18 June referral , which he said never arrived in his office , but for the 21 June referral , which was a less serious case than the first ; Laming called this version of events " wholly unbelievable " . Laming said that Armstrong 's evidence was out of line with that of the other Brent witnesses , that the quality of it " [ left ] much to be desired " , and that Armstrong 's insistence that he dealt with the 21 June referral was an attempt to cover up his team 's " inept handling " of a genuine child protection case . 
 On 14 June 1999 , Kouao and Climbié met Carl Manning ( born 31 October 1972 ) on a bus which he was driving . This was the start of Kouao and Manning 's relationship which ended at the time of their arrest eight months later . She was his first girlfriend . The relationship developed quickly and on 6 July 1999 , Kouao and Climbié moved into Manning 's one @-@ bedroom flat at Somerset Gardens in Tottenham , in the London Borough of Haringey . There is evidence that Climbié 's abuse increased soon after moving into Manning 's flat . 
 On 7 July 1999 , Brent social services sent a letter to Nicoll Road , where Kouao and Climbié were staying , informing them of a home visit . On 14 July 1999 , two social workers , Lori Hobbs and Monica Bridgeman , visited the address but found no answer : Kouao and Climbié had already moved out on 6 July 1999 . Hobbs and Bridgeman made no further inquiries at the property that might have led to a trail on Climbié 's whereabouts . Prior to the visit , they had not done any background checks and had only the " <unk> idea " of what they were investigating . The Laming report suggests that no reports or follow @-@ up notes were made and that the only information additional to the referral were the notes " Not at this address . Have moved . "

 On 13 July 1999 , Kouao took Climbié to Cameron 's house , asking her to take Climbié permanently because Manning did not want her . Cameron refused but agreed to take her for the night . Cameron , her son Patrick , and her daughter Avril , observed that Climbié had numerous injuries — including a burn on her face and a loose piece of skin hanging from her right eyelid — which Kouao said was self @-@ inflicted . Manning 's account in the subsequent inquiry differed and he said that he hit Climbié because of her incontinence , beginning with slaps , but progressing to using his fist by the end of July . It was highly likely that at least some of the injuries were the result of deliberate physical harm . 
 The next day , on 14 July 1999 , Cameron 's daughter Avril took Climbié to see Marie Cader , a French teacher at her son 's school . Cader advised that Climbié be taken to hospital . At 11 : 00 am the same day , Avril took Climbié to the emergency department of Central Middlesex Hospital . At 11 : 50 am , Climbié was seen by Dr Rhys Beynon , a senior house officer in the department . Beynon took Climbié 's history from Avril and thought that there was a strong possibility that the injuries were non @-@ accidental . Due to hospital child protection guidelines , he referred the case to Dr <unk> Ajayi @-@ Obe , the on @-@ call paediatric registrar . Beynon conducted only a cursory examination of Climbié because he believed she was going to be examined by the paediatric team . The Laming report said that " he exhibited sound judgement in his care of Victoria by referring her immediately to a paediatric registrar . " Climbié arrived at Barnaby Bear ward where she was examined by Ajayi @-@ Obe , who noted various injuries . When asked about the injuries , Climbié said they were self @-@ inflicted , a claim the paediatrician did not think was credible . Ajayi @-@ Obe 's notes were detailed and thorough , in contrast to those of the other doctors that examined her . Having examined Climbié , the paediatrician was " strongly suspicious " that the injuries were non @-@ accidental , and she decided to admit Climbié onto the ward . 
 The doctors alerted Brent police and social services , and she was placed under police protection , with a 72 @-@ hour protection order preventing her from leaving hospital . Kouao told the doctors that she had scabies , and that the injuries were self @-@ inflicted . Many doctors and nurses suspected that the injuries were non @-@ accidental . However , Ruby Schwartz , the consultant paediatrician and named child protection doctor at the hospital , diagnosed scabies and decided that it was scratching that caused the injuries . She made the diagnosis without speaking to Climbié alone . Schwartz later admitted that she made a mistake . Another doctor , one of Schwartz ' juniors , misleadingly wrote to social services saying there was no child protection issue . When Michelle Hine , a child protection officer at Brent council , received a report notifying her of Climbié 's injuries , she planned to open an investigation into the case . However , the next day she heard of Schwartz ' diagnosis and downgraded Climbié 's level of care , trusting Schwartz ' judgement . She later expressed regret over her actions . Schwartz said in the inquiry that she expected social services to follow up the case . Neil Garnham QC , counsel to the inquiry following Climbié 's death , later said to her , " there is a terrible danger here — is there not , doctor — of social services on the one hand and you on the other each expecting the other to do the investigation , with the result that nobody does " . The police officer allocated to Climbié 's case for the Brent Child Protection team , Rachel Dewar , decided to lift the police protection , allowing Climbié to return home , when told by a social worker that she had scabies . Under the Children Act 1989 , Dewar was obliged to see Climbié and tell her she was under police protection , but she did not do this . She also failed to see Kouao or Manning . At the time of the decision , Dewar was attending a seminar on child protection . Garnham later said , " we will need to ask why it was thought more important for her to attend a seminar to learn how to deal with child protection cases than deal with the real child protection case for which she was responsible at the time " . Kouao took Climbié home on 15 July 1999 . 
 Some time in July , probably just before Climbié was admitted to the Central Middlesex Hospital , Kouao befriended a couple , Julien and Chantal <unk> . Climbié and Kouao visited their home several times over the following months . According to Chantal , Kouao would shout at Climbié all the time and never showed her affection . 
 = = = Second hospital admission = = = 
 On 24 July 1999 , Climbié was taken by Kouao to the accident @-@ and @-@ emergency department at North Middlesex Hospital with severe scalding to her head and other injuries . The hospital found no evidence of scabies . Consultant Mary Rossiter felt Climbié was being abused but still wrote ' able to discharge ' on her notes . According to Maureen Ann <unk> , another doctor at the hospital , when Rossiter had written that note , she had noted that Climbié was exhibiting signs of neglect , emotional abuse and physical abuse . Later , in the inquiry , Rossiter said that by writing ' able to discharge ' , she did not mean she wanted Climbié to go home , merely that she was physically fit to leave . Garnham said , " quite how the subtlety of that distinction was to be ascertained from the notes is far from obvious " . Rossiter admitted to the inquiry that she had expected police and social services to follow up on the case . For a brief period while she was in hospital , Enfield social services took up the case before passing it to Haringey . 
 A social worker and police officer from Haringey council , Lisa Arthurworrey and Karen Jones , respectively , were assigned to her case , and were scheduled to make a home visit on 4 August 1999 ; however , the visit was cancelled once they heard about the scabies . Jones later said , " it might not be logical but I did not know anything about scabies " . She said that she telephoned North Middlesex Hospital for information about the disease , but Garnham had evidence that the staff there dealt with no such inquiry . Jones was told by a doctor that Climbié 's injuries were consistent with belt buckle marks , although she claimed in the inquiry there was no evidence of child abuse . 
 On 5 August 1999 , a Haringey social worker , Barry Almeida , took Climbié to an NSPCC centre in Tottenham , where she was assigned to Sylvia Henry . There was some confusion as to why the centre was being referred to for the case . Henry later contacted Almeida and was told , according to Henry , that Climbié had moved out of the borough , thereby closing the case . Almeida said he could not remember whether this conversation did take place . On the same day , Kouao met Arthurworrey and Jones at the Haringey social services department , and claimed that Climbié had poured boiling water over herself to stop the itching caused by the scabies and that she had used utensils to cause the other injuries . The social worker and police officer believed her , deciding that the injuries were probably accidental , and allowed Climbié to return home the following day , which she did . 
 = = = Post @-@ hospital events = = = 
 On 7 August 1999 , Kouao visited Ealing social services ; they said it was a housing issue and that the case was closed . Ealing social services would later be described as ' chaotic ' . As a follow @-@ up measure , a staff member at the hospital contacted a health visitor , but the health visitor said in the inquiry that she did not receive any contact . On 13 August 1999 , Rossiter wrote to Petra Kitchman of Brent council , asking her to follow up on the Climbié case . Kitchman said in the inquiry that she contacted Arthurworrey , but Arthurworrey denied this . Later , on 2 September 1999 , Rossiter sent a second letter . Kitchman said she spoke to Arthurworrey about this , but Arthurworrey denied this again . Arthurworrey made a visit to Climbié 's home on 16 August 1999 and another one when Manning began forcing Climbié to sleep in the bath . Arthurworrey said in the inquiry that she was under the impression that Climbié seemed happy , but Garnham criticised Arthurworrey for not detecting any of the abuse , although Manning had described this visit as a " put up job " . Arthurworrey and Climbié had met on four occasions , where they were together for a total of less than 30 minutes , barely speaking to each other . 
 From then on , Kouao kept Climbié away from hospitals , turning instead to churches . Kouao said to the pastors that she was the mother and that demons were inside Climbié . The pastor at the Mission Ensemble Pour Christ , Pascal <unk> , offered prayers for Climbié to cast out the devil , and thought that her injuries were due to demonic possession . On another occasion , Kouao took Climbié to a church run by the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God , where the pastor , Alvaro Lima , suspected she was being abused , although he took no action . He said in the inquiry that Climbié told him that Satan had told her to burn herself . The pastor did not believe her , but he still believed that a person could be possessed . 
 From October 1999 to January 2000 , Manning forced Climbié to sleep in a bin liner in the bath in her own excrement . During a later police interview , Manning said this was because of her frequent <unk> . At Haringey social services on 1 November 1999 , Kouao told social workers that Manning sexually assaulted Climbié , but withdrew the accusation the following day . In one of Arthurworrey 's visits , during a conversation about housing , Arthurworrey said that the council only accommodated children believed to be at serious risk . Laming said in his report , " it may be no coincidence that within three days of this conversation , Kouao contacted Ms. Arthurworrey to make allegations which , if true , would have placed Victoria squarely within that category " . Jones sent a letter to Kouao , which was ignored , and no further action was taken . Manning later denied the allegation . Alan Hodges , the police sergeant overseeing the investigation , claimed in the inquiry that the social workers were obstructing the police in dealing with child protection cases . Between December 1999 and January 2000 , Arthurworrey made three visits to the flat , but she received no answer . She speculated to her supervisor , Carole Baptiste , that they had returned to France . Despite no evidence , her supervisor wrote on Climbié 's file that they had left the area . On 18 February 2000 they wrote to Kouao saying that if they did not receive any contact from them , they would close the case . A week later , on 25 February 2000 , they closed the case — on the same day that Climbié died . 
 = = = Death and trial = = = 
 On 24 February 2000 , Victoria Climbié was taken semi @-@ conscious and suffering from hypothermia , multiple organ failure and malnutrition , to the local Universal Church of the Kingdom of God . After they left , the mini cab driver was horrified at Climbié 's condition and took her straight to the accident @-@ and @-@ emergency department at North Middlesex Hospital ; she was then transferred to the intensive @-@ care unit at St Mary 's Hospital . The ambulance crew who drove her to St Mary 's described how although Kouao had kept saying , " my baby , my baby " , her concern seemed " not quite enough " , and that Manning seemed " almost as if he was not there " . Climbié died the following day at 3 : 15 pm local time . The pathologist who examined her body noted 128 separate injuries and scars on her body , and described it as the worst case of child abuse she had ever seen ; Climbié had been burnt with cigarettes , tied up for periods of longer than 24 hours , and hit with bike chains , hammers and wires . During her life in Britain , Climbié was known to four local authorities ( four social services departments and three housing departments ) , two child protection police teams , two hospitals , an NSPCC centre , and a few local churches . She was buried in Grand @-@ Bassam near her home town . 
 Kouao was arrested on the day that Climbié died , and Manning the following day . Kouao told police , " It is terrible , I have just lost my child " . On 20 November 2000 , at the Old Bailey , the trial into her death opened , where Kouao and Manning were charged with child cruelty and murder . Kouao denied all charges , and Manning pleaded guilty to charges of cruelty and manslaughter . The judge described the people in Climbié 's case as " blindingly incompetent " . In his diary , Manning described Climbié as Satan , and said that no matter how hard he hit her , she did not cry or show signs that she was hurt . On 12 January 2001 , both were found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment . The judge said to them , " what Victoria endured was truly unimaginable . She died at both your hands , a lonely drawn out death " . Kouao went to Durham prison and Manning went to Wakefield prison . 
 = = Inquiry = = 
 On 20 April 2000 , the health secretary , Alan Milburn , and the home secretary , Jack Straw , appointed William Laming , Lord Laming , former chief inspector of the Social Services Inspectorate ( SSI ) , to conduct a statutory inquiry into Climbié 's death . Laming was given the choice of staging a public inquiry or a private inquiry ; he chose a public inquiry . It was the first inquiry to be set up by two secretaries of state . The inquiry was actually three separate inquiries , together called the Victoria Climbié Inquiry , as it had a statutory base of three pieces of legislation : section 81 of the Children Act 1989 , section 84 of the National Health Service Act 1977 , and section 49 of the Police Act 1996 . It drew together the involvement of social services , the National Health Service , and the police , and became the first tripartite inquiry into child protection . The Counsel to the Inquiry was Neil Garnham QC . The inquiry , based in Hannibal House , Elephant and Castle , London , cost £ 3 @.@ 8 million , making it the most expensive child protection investigation in British history . The website victoria @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> was created , where all the evidence and documents were made available freely . 
 The inquiry was launched on 31 May 2001 , and was split into two phases : phase one and phase two . Phase one investigated the involvement of people and agencies in Climbié 's death , in the form of hearings . Two hundred and seventy witnesses were involved . The phase one hearings began on 26 September 2001 and finished on 31 July 2002 ; it was originally supposed to end on 4 February 2002 but late documents caused delays . Phase two of the inquiry , taking place between 15 March 2002 and 26 April 2002 , took the form of five seminars , which looked at the child protection system in general . It was chaired by Garnham and brought together experts in all aspects of child protection . 
 = = = Laming controversy = = = 
 Laming 's appointment was controversial as he had been director of Hertfordshire county council 's social services department in 1990 , a department which was strongly criticised for its handling of a child abuse case , and which had the Local Government Ombudsman making a finding of ' maladministration with injustice ' against them in 1995 . The father of the child in the case said of Laming 's appointment , " I don 't see how he has the qualifications or experience to be able to lead an investigation into another borough which has been failing to protect a child in exactly the same manner that his own authority failed to protect a child in 1990 " . Liberal Democrat spokesman Paul Burstow said , " the findings of the ombudsman in the Hertfordshire case must give rise to questions about Lord Laming 's appointment to head this inquiry " ; and Conservative Party spokesman Liam Fox said , " I think the government maybe should have thought twice about this and maybe , even yet , they will think again " . The Department for Health , however , said that they were " fully confident that he is the right person to conduct the inquiry " . 
 = = = Obstruction of evidence = = = 
 Several documents were submitted late or in suspicious circumstances to the inquiry . A report by the SSI was submitted late because the SSI presumed the document was not relevant to the inquiry . The report was produced in April 2001 but was not handed over to the inquiry until 2002 . An earlier report by the Joint Review about Haringey social services , which was heavily relied upon during the inquiry , said that service users were " generally well served " ; the SSI report said that the former report presented " an overly positive picture of Haringey 's social services , particularly children 's services " . Further documents were received late , when Haringey council handed in 71 case documents five months after the hearings began . Laming said , " it shows a blatant and flagrant disregard to the work of this inquiry " . The people involved were threatened with disciplinary action . This was not the first time that Haringey council did not produce documents on time , which led Laming to say to its chief executive , " it is a long sad and sorry saga of missed dates and missed timetables " . Garnham warned that Haringey senior managers , who had access to the documents , would enjoy an unfair advantage in the inquiry , but Laming said he was " determined that Haringey is not given any advantage " . The inquiry found contradictory information in the NSPCC 's files . One file said that Climbié 's case was " accepted for ongoing service " , whilst another computer record , made after Climbié 's death , said that " no further action " was to be taken , suggesting the possibility that records may have been changed . Documents given to the inquiry may also have been altered : the NSPCC provided photocopies of original documents , which had alterations in them , saying that the originals were lost ; however , the originals were later produced with pressure from the inquiry . The NSPCC held an internal investigation but found no evidence of deception . 
 = = = Findings of the hearings = = = 
 The inquiry heard that many of the councils were understaffed , underfunded , and poorly managed . The chief executive of Brent council said its social services department was " seriously defective " . The inquiry was told that many cases at Brent social services were closed inappropriately before inspection by the social services inspectorate , that children were being placed unaccompanied in bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast accommodation , and that children in need were turned away . The inquiry heard how Edward Armstrong had previously been ordered not to work with children over his handling of a case in 1993 . Haringey and Brent councils diverted £ 18 @.@ 7 million and over £ 26 million , respectively , in the two years 1997 / 98 and 1998 / 99 , from its social services department into services such as education , for other purposes ; both <unk> their budgets for children 's services , totalling £ 28m , by more than £ 10m in 1998 – 99 , causing a deteriorating of child protection services . The inquiry heard how Haringey council failed to assign social workers to 109 children in May 1999 , a short period before they took on Climbié 's case . Again in January 2002 , Haringey council failed to assign social workers to about 50 children . Haringey council wrote a letter to Laming claiming that social workers who gave evidence were being questioned more harshly than other witnesses . Laming condemned the letter , saying " I will not tolerate any covert attempt to influence the way in which the inquiry is conducted . " Mary Richardson , the director of social services at Haringey from 1 April 1998 until 31 March 2000 , had been responsible for a restructuring of the department which , according to the union UNISON , had " virtually paralysed " the child protection service . She received contact from twelve senior practitioners and team managers criticising the proposals as " potentially dangerous and detrimental to the people to whom we offer a service " . Richardson provided no substantive response to the memorandum . She did , however , say in the inquiry that the blame lay on " part of all of the line management responsibility " . <unk> Singh , the former chief executive of Haringey council ( before becoming the chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality ) , said that there was nothing he could have done to prevent Climbié 's death . Garnham contrasted this with Rossiter 's willingness to accept responsibility , saying , " that willingness to acknowledge error is at least at the root , is it not , of progress ? " 
 Kouao herself was called to the inquiry , becoming the first convicted murderer to appear in person in a public inquiry . She initially refused to answer questions , and when she did , protested her innocence , first in French , then , raising her voice in anger , in English . Giving evidence by video link from prison , Manning apologised for his actions and said that it was not the fault of the various agencies that Climbié died . Broadcasters applied for access to this video , but Laming refused the application . Climbié 's parents gave evidence and were present at most of the hearings , becoming distressed when hearing of Climbié 's plight and seeing pictures of her injuries . They blamed Haringey council and its chief executive for Climbié 's death . 
 Arthurworrey , a junior worker with only nineteen months of child protection experience when she took on Climbié 's case , was found to have made mistakes in the case . She accused her employer of " making her a scapegoat " , and criticised her superiors and department for not guiding her properly . The inquiry heard that Arthurworrey was overworked , taking on more cases than guidelines allow . Carole Baptiste , Arthurworrey 's first supervisor , initially refused to attend the hearings , but subsequently gave vague responses to the inquiry , and said that she had been suffering from mental illness at the time . Baptiste 's own child was taken into care a few months before Climbié 's death . Arthurworrey said that , in their meetings , Baptiste spent most of the time discussing " her experiences as a black woman and her relationship with God " , rather than child protection cases , and that she was frequently absent . Baptiste admitted she had not read Climbié 's file properly . She was removed in November 1999 when she was found to be professionally unfit for her job , and replaced by <unk> Mairs , who became Arthurworrey 's new supervisor . Mairs was accused by Arthurworrey of not maintaining childcare standards and of removing an important document — which recommended that Climbié 's case be closed — from Climbié 's file on 28 February 2000 , the day the news of the death was known ; but she denied this . Mairs said that she had not read Climbié 's file . 
 The inquiry heard that the number of child protection police officers in the Metropolitan Police Service was reduced to increase the number of murder investigation officers because of the Stephen Lawrence case in 1993 . A detective inspector supervising six child protection teams in London at the time of Climbié 's death wrote a report criticising their competence . His former boss , however , claimed he had been lying when he said he only held " purely administrative " responsibility for the teams . The detective inspector was taken to hospital when a woman poured ink over his head while testifying . The new chief executive of Haringey council , David Warwick , Baptiste , the Metropolitan Police , and the NSPCC apologised for their failings in the case . 
 = = = Racial considerations = = = 
 In his opening speech on 26 September 2001 , Garnham said that race may have played a part in the case , due to the fact that a black child was murdered by her black carers , and the social worker and police officer most closely involved in the case were black . He said that the fear of being accused of racism may have led to the inaction . In the hearings , Arthurworrey , who is African @-@ Caribbean , admitted that her assumptions about African – Caribbean families influenced her judgement , and that she had assumed Climbié 's <unk> in the presence of Kouao and Manning stemmed not from fear , but from the African – Caribbean culture of respect towards one 's parents . Ratna Dutt , director of the Race Equality Unit ( now the Race Equality Foundation ) , a charity that provides race @-@ awareness training to social workers , later said , " the implicit message is that it 's acceptable for ethnic minorities to receive poor services under the guise of superficial cultural sensitivity . This is absolutely shameful , as it allows people to argue that good practice is compromised by anti @-@ racism " ; and , contrasting the outcomes of the white and black staff members involved , " for a large number of black frontline staff if the finger of blame is pointed at them they don 't end up in jobs in other local authorities . That 's how institutional racism operates " . Jacqui Smith , Home Secretary from 2007 , said : " I have not seen widespread evidence that social workers are not taking action " , and , " there are no cultures that condone child abuse . We are absolutely clear that social workers and social work departments have a responsibility to consider whether children are subjected to harm , and if they think they are , to take action " . One chapter of the report following the inquiry looked at this issue . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 = = = Laming report = = = 
 When both phases of the inquiry were completed , Laming began writing the final report . The Laming report , published on 28 January 2003 , found that the agencies involved in her care had failed to protect her , and that on at least twelve occasions , workers involved in her case could have prevented her death , particularly condemning the senior managers involved . On the day of the launch of the report , Climbié 's mother sang her daughter 's favourite song as a tribute . 
 The 400 @-@ page report made 108 recommendations in child protection reform . Regional and local committees for children and families are to be set up , with members from all groups involved in child protection . Previously each local authority managed their own child protection register , a list of children believed to be at risk , and no national register existed ; this , combined with local authorities ' tendency to suppress information about child abuse cases , led to the implementation of the child database . Two organisations to improve the care of children , the General Social Care Council and the Social Care Institute for Excellence , had already been set up by the time the report was published . 
 = = = Criticism of agencies = = = 
 Following Victoria Climbié 's death , the agencies in the case , as well as the child services system in general , were widely criticised . Milburn said , " this was not a failing on the part of one service , it was a failing on the part of every service " . Fox said Climbié 's case amounted to " a shocking tale of individual professional failure and systemic incompetence " . Burstow said , " there is a terrible sense of déjà vu in the Laming Report . The same weaknesses have led to the same mistakes , with the same missed opportunities to save a tortured child 's life " . Labour Party Member of Parliament Karen Buck said , " the Bayswater families unit told me that there must be hundreds of other Climbié cases waiting to happen " , and " the Victoria Climbié inquiry highlighted how easy it is for vulnerable families to fall through the net , especially if they do not have English as a first language and are highly mobile " . The 1999 Department of Health document , Working Together to <unk> Children ( now superseded ) , set out child protection guidance to doctors , nurses , and midwives . The Royal College of Nursing , however , said that there was evidence that many nurses did not receive proper training in these areas . Denise Platt , chief inspector of the social services inspectorate ( SSI ) , said doctors , police officers and teachers often thought their only responsibility was to help social services , forgetting that they had a distinct role to play . Mike Leadbetter , president of the Association of Directors of Social Services , said that many health professionals were " not engaged in child protection " . After the inquiry , there was a feeling that senior managers had managed to escape responsibility and that only junior staff members were punished . Burstow said , " the majority of children who die from abuse or neglect in this country know the perpetrator ; it is within the family and by ' friends ' that most abuse occurs . As a society we are still in denial about that hard truth " . 
 = = = Criticism of the report = = = 
 The Laming report was criticised by Caroline Abrahams and Deborah Lightfoot of NCH as too narrow , focusing too much on the particular case of Victoria Climbié and not on general child protection . According to Harry Ferguson , a professor of social work at the University of the West of England , " Laming 's report focuses too heavily on the implementation of new structures and fails to understand the keen intuition that child protection work demands " . He criticised the approach to child protection of focusing too much on the worst cases and trying too much to prevent them , rather than having an approach that also celebrates success ; and said that focusing too much on any individual case and basing reforms on that was " deeply problematic " . Laming responded to criticism by the Association of Directors of Social Services that his recommendations would require much more funding by saying that these arguments lacked " intellectual rigour " , and he dismissed claims that his reforms would be too bureaucratic . The Guardian said that the report does not address the issues of frontline staff . <unk> Mead of NCH said , " I do believe that inquiry reports have made a positive difference to the child protection system , and I have every confidence that Lord Laming 's report will do so too " . 
 = = = Other = = = 
 The Guardian discussed the media attention surrounding the case , noticing how sensational events received widespread coverage , yet important but less exciting events received less . It states that only it and The Independent of the national newspapers gave significant coverage to the evidence in the hearings . A possible explanation is given as , " much of the evidence has been concerned with social services , which many other papers view as a politically correct waste of money for the undeserving " . 
 In August 2002 , Baptiste was fined £ 500 after being found guilty of deliberately failing to attend the inquiry . Climbié 's parents , speaking through a family friend , said , " we , the family , expected her to be dealt with more severely " . This was the first time a person had been prosecuted for not attending a public inquiry . In September 2002 , Arthurworrey and Mairs were sacked following disciplinary procedures . The education secretary , Charles Clarke , also added them to the Protection of Children Act 1999 List , banning them from working with children . In October 2004 , Arthurworrey appealed against her dismissal , saying that she was duped by Kouao and Manning , misled by medical reports , badly advised by her managers , and that she was a scapegoat for other people 's failures , but the appeal was rejected . In 2005 , she appealed the ban preventing her from working with children and won the case . In 2004 , Mairs appealed her ban preventing her from working from children and won ; this decision was challenged in the High Court but she prevailed . In 2004 , six police officers involved in the case faced misconduct charges . All six kept their jobs , and some received reprimands and cautions . In 2004 , the General Medical Council dropped misconduct charges against Dr. Schwartz . 
 Haringey council held a debate in the council chambers to discuss the Laming report . The parents of Victoria Climbié were invited to speak at the council by Councillor Ron Aitken , but the Council leader George Meehan denied them permission . Only pressure from the opposition and local press got the decision reversed . As George Meehan only reversed his decision just before the meeting , a driver was rushed to Acton to escort Francis and Berthe Climbié and Mor <unk> , their interpreter , to the council . At the meeting , the <unk> attacked the council , through their interpreter , for its handling of the case , especially in its dealing with the Laming Inquiry . ( Mor <unk> later went on to be the Director of the Victoria Climbié Foundation . ) 
 The government placed Haringey social services department under special measures , requiring close supervision by the social services inspectorate . Allegations emerged that in 2004 and 2005 , senior managers at Haringey council ignored child abuse cases and " became hostile " against a social worker who sought to expose the abuse . 
 Climbié 's parents created the Victoria Climbié Foundation UK , a charity that seeks to improve child protection policies , and the Victoria Climbié Charitable Trust , an organisation to build a school in the Ivory Coast . They are also involved in championing many child protection reforms . A playwright , Lance Nielsen , wrote a play based on the events , staged at the Hackney Empire throughout 2002 . 
 After Climbié 's death , commentators discussed the history of child protection and the various abuse and death cases , noting that there have been 70 public inquiries into child abuse since 1945 , and comparing Climbié 's case with that of many others , especially that of Maria Colwell in 1973 . They pointed to the many children abused and killed by their guardians over the years and how the agencies involved in their care let them down . They noted similarly that their deaths also led to inquiries and reform policies — reforms that have not saved the many children killed following them . They pointed out that , " an average of 78 children are killed by parents or minders every year ; a figure unaltered in the 30 years since Maria Colwell 's death provoked the first criticism of ' communications failure ' " . They expressed cynicism towards the possibility that these reforms would be different . Dr. Chris Harvey , director of operations at Barnardo 's , for example , said , " Victoria 's tragic case is the latest in a sad roll @-@ call of child deaths , each leading to fresh inquiries and a new but recurring set of recommendations " . Ian Willmore , former deputy leader of Haringey council , said , " the ' script ' for this kind of <unk> is now almost traditional . The Minister goes on TV to insist that : ' this must never happen again ' . Responsibility is pinned on a few expendable front @-@ line staff , all conveniently sacked in advance . Criticisms are made about poor communication , with earnest recommendations about better co @-@ ordination and possible restructuring . Council officers — all new appointments — go on TV to say that everything has changed since the case began . Everyone looks very earnest . Voices crack with compassion . Nothing essential changes . " 
 In the United Kingdom , the Audit Commission regulate social services ; John Seddon pointed out in The Times that " Haringey Council was rated 4 @-@ star at the time of Victoria Climbié and Baby P 's deaths " .

 Climbié 's death was largely responsible for various changes in child protection in England , including the formation of the Every Child Matters programme , an initiative designed to improve the lives of children ; the introduction of the Children Act 2004 , an Act of Parliament that provides the legislative base for many of the reforms ; the creation of ContactPoint , a database designed to hold information on all children in England and Wales ( now no longer in operation ) ; and the creation of the post of children 's commissioner , who heads the Office of the Children 's Commissioner , a national agency serving children and families . 
 = Nuova Cronica = 
 The Nuova Cronica or New Chronicles is a 14th @-@ century history of Florence created in a year @-@ by @-@ year linear format and written by the Florentine banker and official Giovanni Villani ( c . 1276 or 1280 – 1348 ) . The idea came to him after attending the first Jubilee in the city of Rome , in 1300 , where he realized that Rome 's many historical achievements were well @-@ known , and he desired to lay out a history of the origins of his own city of Florence . In his Cronica , Villani described in detail the many building projects of the city , statistical information on population , ordinances , commerce and trade , education , and religious facilities . He also described several disasters such as famines , floods , fires , and the pandemic of the Black Death in 1348 , which would take his own life . Villani 's work on the Cronica was continued by his brother and nephew after his death . It has been described as the first introduction of statistics as a positive element in history . 
 The oldest manuscript is Vatican Library <unk> <unk> L VIII 296 , dating to the time of composition . 
 = = Organization = = 
 Giovanni Villani 's Cronica is divided into twelve books ; the first six deal with the largely legendary history of Florence , starting at conventionally Biblical times to 1264 . The second phase , in six books , covers the history from 1264 until his own time , all the way up to 1346 . Villani outlines the events in his Cronica , not by theme , but through year @-@ to @-@ year accounts ; for this , he has gained criticism over the years for writing in an episodic manner lacking a unifying theme or point of view . Villani 's chronicles are intercut with historical episodes reported just as he heard them , with little interpretation ; this often led to historical inaccuracies in his work , making most of his mistakes in the biographies of historical or contemporary people living outside of Florence ( even with well @-@ known monarchs ) . However , his description of such events as the Battle of Crécy in 1346 was fairly accurate according to historian Kelly De Vries . Both Bartlett and Green state that Villani 's Cronica represented a departure from medieval chronicles in that a more modernistic approach was taken in describing events and statistics , yet still medieval in that Villani relied on divine providence to explain the outcome of events . 
 = = Notable passages = = 
 = = = Battle of Montaperti , 1260 = = = 
 In his Cronica , Villani writes that the Guelph defeat by the Ghibellines at Montaperti in 1260 was a major setback to the historical progress of the Republic of Florence . In this civil war , the Guelphs were a faction united with the papacy in Rome , while the Ghibellines were allied with the descendants of Emperor Frederick II of the Holy Roman Empire and supported by Siena . According to Villani , the Florentine Guelphs ' last stand was in defending the <unk> , a chariot which symbolized the independence of the Commune of Florence . Villani estimated that 2 @,@ 500 Florentine troops were killed and 1 @,@ 500 captured during the battle , which Roberta J.M. Olson states are conservative numbers in regards to subsequent historians writing of the battle 's casualties . 
 = = = Florence Cathedral , 1296 = = = 
 Villani describes the rebuilding of Florence after the 1293 rebellion of one <unk> della Bella ; he notes that by 1296 conditions were once again in a " tranquil state " . He states that the citizens of Florence were discontented with the small stature of their cathedral , one that did not fit the greatness of their city , and so agreed in 1296 to expand and renew the building . A new foundation was laid in September of that year , adding new marble and sculptural figures . Villani mentions the cardinal legate sent by the Pope in Rome who laid the first stone of the foundation , a significant event since it was the first papal legate to visit Florence . Villani relates that for the construction of the church , it was required of the Commune of Florence that a subsidy of four denari on each libra be paid out of the city treasury in addition to a head @-@ tax of two <unk> for each adult male . On July 18 , 1334 , work began on the new campanile ( bell tower ) of the cathedral , the first stone placed by the bishop of Florence in front of an audience of clergy , priors , and other magistrates . Villani notes that the commune chose " our fellow @-@ citizen Giotto " as the designer of the tower , a man who was " the most sovereign master of painting in his time " . 
 = = = Palazzo Vecchio , 1299 = = = 
 According to Villani , in 1299 , the commune and people of Florence laid the foundation for the Palazzo Vecchio , to replace the town hall that was located in a house behind the church of San <unk> . The new Palazzo Vecchio was to serve as a protective municipal palace for the priors and magistrates , shielding them from the factional strife of the Guelphs and Ghibellines as well as the brawls between the people and magnates over the renewal of the priors every two months . The Uberti family houses had formerly stood at the location of the new piazza , but the Uberti were " rebels of Florence and Ghibellines " and thus the plaza was intentionally laid upon the former location of their homes so they could never be rebuilt . According to Villani , the Uberti family was not even allowed to return to Florence . In planning for the large expanse of the plaza , the commune of Florence purchased the homes of citizens such as the <unk> family , so that they could be demolished to make room for construction . In fact , the main tower of the Palazzo was built upon a previously existing tower of the <unk> family known as " La Vacca " or " The Cow " . 
 = = = Trend of building country homes , early 14th century = = = 
 Villani boasts of Florence 's pristine architecture in its monasteries and churches , as well as its ornate houses and beautiful palaces . His opinion is clear even in the title of the chapter he devotes to this topic , " More on the greatness and status and magnificence of the city of Florence " . However , Villani is quick to add that those who spent too much on the lavish excesses of continuous remodelling and refurnishing of homes were sinners and could be " considered crazy because of their extravagant spending " . Villani also describes the growing trend in the early 14th century of affluent Florentine citizens building large country homes far outside the walls of Florence , in the hills of Tuscany . 
 = = = Works sponsored by Robert of Naples , 1316 = = = 
 While holding the signoria of Florence , Robert of Naples ( 1277 – 1343 ) had the eastern part of the Bargello in Florence constructed , where he had his vicar the Count of <unk> reside . Villani writes in 1316 that Robert 's vicar oversaw the construction of a large part of the new palace , which would suggest Robert 's vicar had a great amount of influence in the construction of the eastern addition of the Palazzo del <unk> , including its Magdalen Chapel . 
 = = = Famine of 1328 = = = 
 There was a famine in 1328 which not only devastated Florence , but caused the people of Perugia , Siena , Lucca , and Pistoia to turn away any beggars who approached their towns because they could not provide them with food . Villani reports that Florence did not turn away beggars , but cared for anyone who approached the city and was in need of immediate subsistence . According to Villani , the Florentines sought grain from Sicily , having it brought into port at Talamone and transporting all the way to Florence at great expense . Florence also sought aid and food supplies from Romagna and Arezzo . Villani writes of the bread riots of the poor who could not afford a whole <unk> of wheat with their meager salaries : 
 ... as long as the scarcity lasted , disregarding the heavy charge upon the public purse , it kept the price of the <unk> at half a gold florin [ which would be two and a half times the normal figure ] although to affect this reduction it permitted the wheat to be mixed to one @-@ fourth its volume with coarser grain . In spite of all the government did , the agitation of the people at the market of Or San Michele was so great that it was necessary to protect the officials by means of guards fitted out with ax and block to punish rioters on the spot with the loss of hands or feet . 
 Villani states that the commune of Florence spent more than 60 @,@ 000 gold florins to mitigate this effects of this disaster . In order to save their own funds and calm the rage of the riotous poor , all the baker 's ovens in the city were requisitioned by the commune and a loaf of bread weighing 170 g ( 6 oz ) was then sold at a meager four pennies . This price was fixed in consideration that poor workers who made only eight to twelve pennies a day could now buy enough bread to survive . 
 Villani also describes in vivid detail the effects of another widespread famine in Tuscany during the year 1347 , which killed an estimated 4 @,@ 000 people in Florence a year before the Bubonic Plague . 
 = = = Fires of 1331 and 1332 = = = 
 On June 23 , 1331 , a fire broke out toward the left bank of the Ponte Vecchio bridge , destroying all twenty shops located on the bridge . Villani notes that this was a heavy loss to local craftsmen of Florence , while two craftsman apprentices died in the fire . On September 12 of that same year a fire broke out at the household of the <unk> , killing six people in a house of carpenters and a blacksmith that was located near the church of Santa Trinità . 
 On February 28 , 1332 , a fire broke out in the palace of the podestà , the leading magistrate of the city . This fire destroyed the roof of the palace and destroyed two @-@ thirds of the entire structure from the ground floor up , prompting the government to rebuild the palatial residence totally out of stone , all the way up to the roof . On July 16 of that year the palace of the wool guild caught fire and everything from the ground floor up was destroyed , prompting the wool guild to reconstruct a new palatial residence on a larger scale and with stone vaults leading up to the roof . 
 = = = Flood of 1333 = = = 
 Villani states that by noon on Thursday , November 4 , 1333 , a flood along the Arno River spread across the entire plain of San Salvi . He wrote that by nightfall the eastern wall of the city that was damming the water became damaged and then washed away in the flood , allowing the flood waters to breach and fill the city streets . He claims that the water rose above the altar in the Florence Baptistry , reaching over half the height of the porphyry columns . Bartlett notes that these columns , presented to Florence by the Pisans more than two hundred years before , have scratched lines to this day indicating the water level reached by the flood in 1333 . Villani further claims that the height of the flood water in the courtyard of the commune 's palace ( residence of the podestà ) reached 3 m ( 10 ft ) . The <unk> bridge collapsed with the exception of two of its arches , while the Trinità bridge collapsed except for one pier and one arch located towards the church of the Santa Trinità . The Ponte Vecchio — save the two central piers — was swept away when huge logs in the rushing water became clogged around the it , allowing the water to build and leap over the arches , states Villani . There was an old statue of Mars that stood on a pedestal near the Ponte Vecchio , but this too was taken by the flood along the Arno . 
 = = = Black Death of 1348 = = = 
 Villani describes how the plague of Black Death in 1348 was much more widespread amongst the inhabitants of Pistoia , Prato , Bologna , Romagna , Avignon and the whole of France than it was in Florence and Tuscany . He notes that the Black Death also killed many more in Greece , Turkey ( Anatolia ) , in countries amongst the Tartars and in places " beyond the sea " , across the whole Levant and Mesopotamia in the areas of Syria and " Chaldea " , as well as the islands of Cyprus , Crete , Rhodes , Sicily , Sardinia , Corsica , Elba , and " from there soon reached all the shores of the mainland " . Relating the course of events and the sailors from Genoa who brought the plague to mainland Europe , Villani writes : 
 And of eight Genoese galleys which had gone to the Black Sea only four returned , full of infected sailors , who were smitten one after the other on the return journey . And all who arrived at Genoa died , and they corrupted the air to such an extent that whoever came near the bodies died shortly after . And it was a disease in which there appeared certain swellings in the groin and under the armpit , and the victims spat blood , and in three days they were dead . And the priest who confessed the sick and those who nursed them so generally caught the infection that the victims were abandoned and deprived of confession , sacrament , medicine , and nursing . . <unk> many lands and cities were made desolate . And this plague lasted till . . . 
 Villani was unable to complete this last sentence , since he himself died of the plague while writing the Cronica . 
 = = Municipal statistics = = 
 Giovanni Villani recorded many statistics associated with the city of Florence . This included — but certainly wasn 't limited to — figures such as 80 banks located in the city , 146 bakeries , 80 members in an association of city judges with 600 notaries , 60 some physicians and surgical doctors , and 100 some shops and dealers of spices . Each week the city consumed 13 @,@ 200 bushels of grain while the city annually consumed 4 @,@ 000 oxen and calves , 60 @,@ 000 mutton and sheep , 20 @,@ 000 goats , and 30 @,@ 000 pigs . He wrote that annually , in the month of July , some 4 @,@ 000 melons were imported through Porta San <unk> . 
 = = = Population = = = 
 Villani states that the whole population of Florence — men , women , and children — in reference to the years 1336 to 1338 , was estimated to be 90 @,@ 000 due to the amount of bread needed daily . Villani recorded an exact figure of 94 @,@ 000 residents ( which he says was very reliable data that included even the poor ) in April 1347 , a year before the Black Death . A black bean was deposited for every male child baptized and a white bean deposited for every female child baptized in the Florence Baptistry — from these baptisms the average annual birth rate was figured at 5 @,@ 500 to 6 @,@ 000 . Villani pointed out that the newborn males often outnumbered the newborn females by 300 to 500 on each count . He noted that in his day the adult , male citizen population of the city was about 25 @,@ 000 ( those between the age of fifteen and seventy who could bear arms ) ; 1 @,@ 500 of these were noble and upper class citizens . Giovanni Villani stated that at all times there were about 1 @,@ 500 foreigners , transients , and soldiers in the city . 
 = = = Education = = = 
 Besides population statistics , Villani also offered statistics on education . He wrote that boys and girls learning to read numbered 8 @,@ 000 to 10 @,@ 000 each year . There were 1 @,@ 000 to 1 @,@ 200 children learning to use the abacus and <unk> for mathematics . In the four large , prestigious schools of Florence , there were always 550 to 600 students in attendance to learn proper grammar and scholastic logic . 
 = = = Religious facilities = = = 
 Villani also offered statistics on religious and health facilities . The total number of churches in Florence and its suburbs was 110 — including 57 parishes , five abbeys with two priors and 80 monks each , 24 nunneries with some 500 women , 10 orders of friars , and 30 hospitals with over 1 @,@ 000 beds to offer to the sick and dying . Overall there were 250 to 350 chaplain priests in the city . 
 = = = Commerce and trade = = = 
 Besides religious facilities , Villani also provided information on commerce and trade . He states that there were about 200 workshops overseen by the Arte della Lana ( guild of wool merchants and entrepreneurs in the woolen industry ) of Florence . He states that these workshops produced some 70 @,@ 000 to 80 @,@ 000 pieces of cloth a year , with a total worth of 1 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 gold florins . He states that a third of this sum " remained in the land " as a reward for labor , while 30 @,@ 000 people lived from this sum of money . Giovanni notes that earlier in Florence there were actually 300 workshops producing 100 @,@ 000 pieces of cloth annually , but these were of coarser quality and lesser value ( before the importation and knowledge of English wool ) . Giovanni noted that the rise of the Florentine wool industry in the 13th century came about with this shift from producing a mass of cheap woolen products to high @-@ margin luxury fabrics produced in limited qualities with high demand . 
 The guild of the Arte di Calimala ( importers , <unk> , and sellers of French and Transalpine cloth ) annually imported 10 @,@ 000 pieces of cloth worth 300 @,@ 000 gold florins ; these were sold on the streets of Florence , while a large but unknown amount was exported back out of Florence . There was a large flux of international traders entering Florence , so much so that Villani states all attempts at creating market fairs in the early 14th century failed because " there always is a market in Florence . " 
 = = = Knights and the ordinances = = = 
 Villani states that there were only 75 full @-@ dress knights in his day and not 250 knights as in the previous government of Florence , because the popular second government denied the magnates much of their authority and status , " hence few persons were knighted . " In 1293 , new city ordinances were passed that stated anyone who did not belong to a guild or a council of the captain of the people were to be barred from serving as priors , standard @-@ bearers of justice , or judges . This effectively excluded the powerful magnates of the city from holding important offices , while a prison for magnates was built in 1294 , and Giovanni Villani writes that the first magnates punished for failing to adhere to these ordinances were the Galli . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The Nuova Cronica by Villani stands as a milestone achievement in the history of European chronicles . Mark Phillips writes that Villani 's account provided the basis for the historical works of Leonardo Bruni and Niccolò Machiavelli . Villani 's extensive work has also allowed for greater study of his contemporary Dante Alighieri by modern historians . Yet the Nuova Cronica also has its limitations , mostly with relying on inaccurate accounts of eras preceding its compilation . Earlier chronicles , such as the Chronica de origine civitatis of 1231 , provided little substantive or factual material , relying instead on legendary accounts and not venturing to analyze their historicity or question their validity . The historian Nicolai Rubinstein called Villani 's chronicle a much more " mature expression " of validated Florentine history , yet Villani still relied on the Chronica de origine civitatis for covering events of Florence 's earliest history ; hence he adopted some of the highly questionable legendary accounts as true historical events . Although Villani 's work is most reliable when it comes to historical events that occurred within his lifetime , there are some factual errors even in the contemporary biographies he presented . Kenneth R. Bartlett writes that Villani 's interest and elaboration in economic details , statistical information , and political and psychological insight signifies him as a more modern late medieval chronicler of Europe . However , he adds that Villani 's reliance upon divine providence aligned him more with the medieval tradition of chroniclers than the more credible historians of the Renaissance . 
 = Proto @-@ globalization = 
 Proto @-@ globalization or early modern globalization is a period of the history of globalization roughly spanning the years between 1600 and 1800 , following the period of archaic globalization . First introduced by historians A. G. Hopkins and Christopher Bayly , the term describes the phase of increasing trade links and cultural exchange that characterized the period immediately preceding the advent of so @-@ called " modern globalization " in the 19th century . 
 Proto @-@ globalization distinguished itself from modern globalization on the basis of expansionism , the method of managing global trade , and the level of information exchange . The period of proto @-@ globalization is marked by such trade arrangements as the East India Company , the shift of hegemony to Western Europe , the rise of larger @-@ scale conflicts between powerful nations such as the Thirty Year War , and a rise of new commodities — most particularly slave trade . The Triangular Trade made it possible for Europe to take advantage of resources within the western hemisphere . The transfer of plant and animal crops and epidemic diseases associated with Alfred Crosby 's concept of The Columbian Exchange also played a central role in this process . Proto @-@ globalization trade and communications involved a vast group including European , Muslim , Indian , Southeast Asian and Chinese merchants , particularly in the Indian Ocean region . 
 The transition from proto @-@ globalization to modern globalization was marked with a more complex global network based on both capitalistic and technological exchange ; however , it led to a significant collapse in cultural exchange . 
 = = Description = = 
 Although the 17th and 18th centuries saw a rise in Western Imperialism in the world system , the period of Proto @-@ globalization involved increased interaction between Western Europe and the systems that had formed between nations in East Asia and the Middle East . Proto @-@ globalization was a period of reconciling the governments and traditional systems of individual nations , world regions , and religions with the " new world order " of global trade , imperialism and political alliances , what historian A.G. Hopkins called " the product of the contemporary world and the product of distant past . " 
 According to Hopkins , " globalization remains an incomplete process : it promotes fragmentation as well as uniformity ; it may recede as well as advance ; its geographical scope may exhibit a strong regional bias ; its future direction and speed cannot be predicted with confidence — and certainly not by presuming that it has an ' inner logic ' of its own . Before proto @-@ globalization , <unk> networks were the product of " great kings and warriors searching for wealth and honor in fabulous lands , by religious wanderers , ... and by merchant princes " . Proto @-@ globalization held on to and matured many aspects of archaic globalization such as the importance of cities , migrants , and specialization of labor . 
 Proto @-@ globalization was also marked by two main political and economic developments : " the reconfiguration of the state systems , and the growth of finance , services , and pre @-@ industrial manufacturing " . A number of states at the time began to " strengthen their connections between territory , taxation , and sovereignty " despite their continuing monopoly of loyalties from their citizens . The process of globalization during this time was heavily focused on material world and the labor needed for its production . The proto @-@ globalization period was a time of " improved efficiency in the transactions sector " with the generation of goods such as sugar , tobacco , tea , coffee , and opium unlike anything the archaic globalization possessed . The improvement of economic management also spread to the expansion of transportation which created a complex set of connection between the West and East . The expansion of trade routes led to the " green revolution " based on the plantation system and slave exportation from Africa . 
 = = Precursors = = 
 During the pre @-@ modern era early forms of globalization were already beginning to affect a world system , marking a period that historian A. G. Hopkins has called archaic globalization . The world system leading up to proto @-@ globalization was one that hinged on one or more hegemonic powers assimilating neighboring cultures into their political system , waging war on other nations , and dominating world trade . 
 A major hegemony in archaic globalization was the Roman Empire , which united the Greater Mediterranean Area and Western Europe through a long @-@ running series of military and political campaigns expanding the Roman system of government and Roman values to more underdeveloped areas . Conquered areas became provinces of the empire and Roman military outposts in the provinces became cities with structures designed by the best Roman architects , which hastened the spread of Rome 's " modern " way of life while absorbing the traditions and beliefs of these native cultures . Nationalist ideology as well as propaganda supporting the Roman Army and military success , bravery , and valor also strengthened the Roman Empire 's spread across Western Europe and the Mediterranean Area . The Roman Empire 's well @-@ built aqueducts and cities and sturdy , effective naval fleets , ships and an organized system of paved roads also facilitated fast , easy travel and better networking and trade with neighboring nations and the provinces . 
 During the Han dynasty under Han Wudi ( 141 – 87 BCE ) , the Chinese government united and became powerful enough that China began to successfully indulge in imperialistic endeavors with its neighboring nations in East Asia . Han China 's imperialism was a peaceful tributary system , which focused mainly on diplomatic and trade relations . The growth of the Han Empire facilitated trade and cultural exchange with virtually all of the known world as reached from Asia , and Chinese silks spread through Asia and Inner Asia and even to Rome . The early T 'ang dynasty saw China as even more responsive to foreign influence and the T 'ang dynasty becoming a great empire . Overseas trade with India and the Middle East grew rapidly , and China 's East and Southern Coasts , once distant and unimportant regions , gradually became chief areas of foreign trade . During the Song Dynasty China 's navy became more powerful thanks to technological improvements in shipbuilding and navigation , and China 's maritime commerce also increased exponentially . 
 China 's power began to decline in the 16th century when the rulers of the subsequent Ming <unk> the importance of China 's trade from sea power . The Ming rulers let China 's naval dominance and its grip on the Spice trade slacken , and the European powers stepped in . Portugal , with its technological advances in naval architecture , weaponry , seamanship and navigation , took over the Spice Trade and subdued China 's navy . With this , European Imperialism and the age of European Hegemony was beginning , although China still retained power of many of its areas of trade . 
 = = Changes in trade systems = = 
 One of the most significant differences between proto @-@ globalization and archaic globalization was the switch from inter @-@ nation trading of rarities to the trading of commodities . During the 12th and 13th centuries it was common to trade items that were foreign and rare to different cultures . A popular trade during archaic globalization involved European merchants sailing to areas of India or China in order to purchase luxury items such as porcelain , silk and spices . Traders of the pre @-@ modern period also traded drugs and certain foods such as sugar cane and other crops . While these items were not rarities as such , the drugs and food traded were valued for the health and function of the human body . It was more common during proto @-@ globalization to trade various commodities such as cotton , rice and tobacco . The shift into proto @-@ globalization trade signified the " emergence of the modern international order " and the development of early capitalist expansion which began in the Atlantic during the 17th century and spread throughout the world by 1830 . 
 = = = Atlantic slave trade = = = 
 One of the main reasons for the rise of commodities was the rise in the slave trade , specifically the Atlantic slave trade . 
 The use of slaves prior to the 15th century was only a minor practice in the labor force and was not crucial in the development of products and goods ; but , due to labor shortage , the use of slaves rose . After 1500 , the settlement of island despots and plantation centers in Sao Tome began trade relations with the Kingdom of the Kongo , which brought West Central Africa into the Atlantic Slave Trade . The Portuguese maintained an export of slaves from Agadir , an Atlantic port , which they maintained for most of the early 16th century . Also the Portuguese settlement of the Brazilian subcontinent allowed the opening of the American slave market and slaves were shipped from Sao Tome directly to America . The Europeans also took use of the Atlantic Slave Trade in the first half of the century . The European slave ships took their slaves to the Iberian Peninsula , however slave owners in Europe were only seen in wealthy , aristocrat families due to the high costs of slaves and the cheap peasant labor available for agricultural uses , and as its name implies the first use of the African @-@ American slaves in plantation work arose in the Atlantic islands not in the continental Europe . Approximately 10 @.@ 2 million Africans survived the Atlantic crossing between 1450 and 1870 . The large slave population thrived due to the demand for production from the Europeans who found it cheaper to import crops and goods rather than produce them on their own . 
 Many wars were fought during the 17th century between the slave trading companies for areas that were economically dependent on slaves . The West India Company gained many slaves through these wars ( specifically with Portugal ) by captains who had captured enemy ships ; between 1623 and 1637 , 2 @,@ 336 were captured and sold in the New World by the West India Company . The selling of slaves to the New World opened up trading posts in North America ; the Dutch opened their first on Manhattan Island in 1613 . The West India Company had also opened a trading post in the Caribbean and the company was also carrying slaves to a colony of New Netherland . The use of slaves had many benefits to the economies and productions in the areas of trade . The emergent rise of coffee , tea , and chocolate in Europe led to the demand for the production of sugar ; 70 percent of slaves were used solely for the labor @-@ intensive production of crop . Slave trade was also beneficial to the trade voyages , because the constant sailing allowed investors to buy small shares of many ships at the same time . Hopkin states that many scholars , him among them , argue that slave trade was essential to the wealth of many nations , during and after proto @-@ globalization , and without the trade production would have plummeted . The investment in ships and nautical technology was the catalyst to the complex trade networks developed throughout proto @-@ globalization and into modern globalization . 
 = = = Plantation economy = = = 
 Consequently , the rise of slavery was due to the increasing rise of crops being produced and traded , more specifically the rise of the plantation economy The rise of the plantations was the main reason for the trade of commodities during proto @-@ globalization . Plantations were used by the exporting countries ( mainly America ) to grow the raw materials needed to manufacture the goods which were traded back into the plantation economy . Commodities that grew in trade due to the plantation economy were mainly tobacco , cotton , sugar cane , and rubber .
