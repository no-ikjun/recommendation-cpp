 In the immediate aftermath of the IAU definition of dwarf planet , a number of scientists expressed their disagreement with the IAU resolution . Campaigns included car bumper stickers and T @-@ shirts . Mike Brown ( the discoverer of Eris ) agrees with the reduction of the number of planets to eight . 
 NASA has announced that it will use the new guidelines established by the IAU . However , Alan Stern , the director of NASA 's mission to Pluto , rejects the current IAU definition of planet , both in terms of defining dwarf planets as something other than a type of planet , and in using orbital characteristics ( rather than intrinsic characteristics ) of objects to define them as dwarf planets . Thus , in 2011 , he still referred to Pluto as a planet , and accepted other dwarf planets such as Ceres and Eris , as well as the larger moons , as additional planets . Several years before the IAU definition , he used orbital characteristics to separate " <unk> " ( the dominant eight ) from " <unk> " ( the dwarf planets ) , considering both types " planets " . 
 = = Planetary @-@ mass moons = = 
 Nineteen moons are known to be massive enough to have relaxed into a rounded shape under their own gravity , and seven of them are more massive than either Eris or Pluto . They are not physically distinct from the dwarf planets , but are not dwarf planets because they do not directly orbit the Sun . The seven that are more massive than Eris are the Moon , the four Galilean moons of Jupiter ( Io , Europa , Ganymede , and Callisto ) , one moon of Saturn ( Titan ) , and one moon of Neptune ( Triton ) . The others are six moons of Saturn ( Mimas , Enceladus , Tethys , Dione , Rhea , and Iapetus ) , five moons of Uranus ( Miranda , Ariel , Umbriel , Titania , and Oberon ) , and one moon of Pluto ( Charon ) . There are additional possibilities among TNOs , including Dysnomia orbiting Eris . Alan Stern calls these moons " satellite planets " , one of three categories of planet together with dwarf planets and classical planets . The term <unk> ( " planetary @-@ mass object " ) covers all three . 
 In a draft resolution for the IAU definition of planet , both Pluto and Charon would have been considered dwarf planets in a binary system , given that they both satisfied the mass and shape requirements for dwarf planets and revolved around a common center of mass located between the two bodies ( rather than within one of the bodies ) . The IAU currently states that Charon is not considered to be a dwarf planet and is just a satellite of Pluto , although the idea that Charon might qualify to be a dwarf planet in its own right may be considered at a later date . The location of the barycenter depends not only on the relative masses of the bodies , but also on the distance between them ; the barycenter of the Sun – Jupiter orbit , for example , lies outside the Sun . 
 = Eddisbury hill fort = 
 Eddisbury hill fort , also known as Castle Ditch , is an Iron Age hill fort near Delamere , Cheshire , in northern England . Hill forts are fortified hill @-@ top settlements constructed across Britain during the Iron Age . Eddisbury is the largest and most complex of the seven hill forts in the county of Cheshire . It was constructed before 200 – 100 BC and expanded in 1 – 50 AD . In the 1st century AD , the Romans slighted the site . It was reoccupied in the 6th – 8th centuries AD , and an Anglo @-@ Saxon burh was probably established at Eddisbury in 914 . In the medieval and post @-@ medieval periods quarrying and farming have damaged the site . Ownership is currently split between the Forestry Commission and a local farm . Eddisbury is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument . 
 = = Background = = 
 Hill forts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age , roughly the start of the first millennium BC . The reason for their emergence in Britain , and their purpose , has been a subject of debate . It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe , sites built by invaders , or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture . The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain . Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze , and as a result trading patterns shifted and the old elites lost their economic and social status . Power passed into the hands of a new group of people . Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated " [ the forts ] provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress [ of an increasing population ] burst out into open warfare . But I wouldn 't see them as having been built because there was a state of war . They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed , but this was not the only , or even the most significant , factor in their construction " . 
 = = Location and layout = = 
 Although there are over 1 @,@ 300 hill forts in England , they are concentrated in the south of the country , with only seven in Cheshire . Eddisbury is the largest and most complex of the Cheshire hill forts . The forts form two geographical groups of three , with Maiden Castle on its own in the south of the county ; Eddisbury hill fort is in the southern group with <unk> Castle and <unk> hill fort . Located at grid reference <unk> , Eddisbury Hill , in common with all of the hill forts in Cheshire , sits on part of the central ridge that runs north – south through the county . 
 Eddisbury hill fort follows the contours of its hill and measures 200 by 380 m ( 660 by 1 @,@ 250 ft ) . It is surrounded by two ramparts with a ditch in between . The ditch is 10 m ( 33 ft ) wide and 0 @.@ 5 m ( 1 @.@ 6 ft ) deep . The inner bank lies between . 
 = = History = = 
 There is evidence of Bronze Age activity at Eddisbury . Before 250 BC , a palisade was erected on Eddisbury Hill . The first hill fort was built in 200 – 100 BC . Eddisbury hill fort has two main archaeological phases . In the first phase of activity , the site was defended by a single rampart and ditch ; this type of hill fort is termed " univallate " . The settlement was concentrated on the eastern part of the fort 's hill . During the second phase , the fort extended westwards , occupying the entire hill top , and the defences were enhanced through the addition of more ramparts and ditches . The enclosed area expanded from 5 @.@ 5 acres ( 22 @,@ 000 m2 ) to 7 acres ( 28 @,@ 000 m2 ) , and the defences covered 15 @.@ 5 acres ( 63 @,@ 000 m2 ) , 6 acres ( 24 @,@ 000 m2 ) more than previously . There are two theories about the expansion of the fort : either the growth westwards and the extended defences were completed at the same time or that they were separate events . If they happened at the same time it is likely to have been in the interest of making the site easier to defend . If they were separate , the ramparts may have been extended to incorporate an entrance at the western end of the site . The expansion phase dated to 1 – 50 AD . 
 In the late 1st century AD , the hill fort was destroyed by the Romans . The defences were slighted to prevent the site being reused . In the 4th – 6th centuries AD , the hill fort was reoccupied and huts were built over the inner rampart . A later hut , dating from the 6th – 8th centuries , has also been discovered . Eddisbury has been suggested as the site of an Anglo @-@ Saxon burh built in 914 by Æthelflæd , daughter of Alfred the Great , and recorded in the Mercian Register in the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle but this has been queried . In the medieval and post @-@ medieval period , the south @-@ east part of the site was inhabited , at one point being used as a forester 's lodge . The centre of the fort has been cultivated since at least the 19th century , still undergoes ploughing , and was used as a quarry . 
 Eddisbury was excavated between 1935 and 1938 by W. J. Varley , who also undertook excavations at Maiden Castle nearby , as part of his investigation into the origin of Cheshire 's hill forts . The structure was made a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1995 , giving Eddisbury protection against unauthorised change . The site has been assessed as being " at high risk " due to ploughing on the site , causing erosion . Five of Cheshire 's seven hill forts have been assessed as being " at high risk " compared to 15 % of North West England 's Scheduled Monuments . Although the western and northern parts of Eddisbury are owned by the Forestry Commission , the rest of the site is part of Old Pale Farm .

 The idea for 7 Khoon Maaf came when Ruskin Bond sent his book of Short Story collection to Vishal Bhardwaj . He was intrigued by a four @-@ page story 's title named " Susanna 's Seven Husbands " , and thought it had potential for a novel and a film . Bhardwaj said , " I told myself why would a woman have seven husbands and then I came to know that she also kills them ! I was immediately hooked to it . It reminded me of a very old film , Bluebeard 's Seven Wives " . Bhardwaj suggested the story to a fellow director , who was looking for a good story . However , after reading the short story , the director dismissed it saying it has no film potential . After reading the story twice , he became even more confident about possibility of a film . Bhardwaj who had previously adapted Bond 's novel The Blue Umbrella into a film , decided to adapt the short story for the screen . Bhardwaj later requested Bond to turn the story into a novella , noting that only Bond could flesh out the characters well , to which he agreed . Bond expanded the story into an 80 @-@ page novella , which later became a 200 @-@ page full @-@ length Hindi script . 
 Bhardwaj noted that he retained Bond 's theme , but incorporated his own elements to make the film a dark comedy . He said , " I had previously taken liberties with Shakespeare . Naturally , when you adapt a story , your vision also comes in it . But I have remained honest to its essence " . He included Keemat Lal ( who plays a police officer in all Bond 's stories ) , although the character is not in the original story . Bhardwaj decided to include him in the film as an homage to Bond , explaining that he took liberties with characters ' names and traits . Bond also had to devise Indian methods of killing the husbands , which he found challenging : " The challenge was devising seven ingenious ways in which she could kill her husbands without being suspected . And she does it successfully , until towards the end " . 
 = = = Casting and characters = = = 
 Priyanka Chopra was Bhardwaj 's original choice for the role of Susanna after he worked with the actress in Kaminey : He said that Chopra " is the finest actor of her generation right now ... As a director I had so much trust on her that I felt that no one else can essay this role as brilliantly as she would do " . Mohanlal was cast as one of Susanna 's husbands in the film ; however , he left the project to concentrate on Malayalam films . The actor was replaced by Annu Kapoor in the role of Inspector Keemat Lal . Other actors in the film were John Abraham , Naseeruddin Shah , Neil Nitin Mukesh and Vivaan Shah . Directors Karan Johar and Imtiaz Ali were approached to play two of the seven husbands , but they reportedly turned down the offer . Usha Uthup was cast as Susanna 's maid in the film . Konkona Sen Sharma was confirmed for a cameo appearance . 
 During production , the film underwent two name changes . The project was initially titled Seven , which became Ek <unk> Saat and finally 7 Khoon Maaf . In the film , Chopra 's character ages from 20 to 65 , and prosthetic makeup was used for her looks at different ages . Bhardwaj hired Hollywood special makeup effects artist Greg Cannom , who did the makeup for 2008 's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button , to create seven looks for the character . Chopra found the most challenging period was that of the 65 @-@ year @-@ old woman . The actress said , " prosthetics had to play a heavy part but I ’ m happy that I pushed myself as the result is really fab . I had to be very careful of not doing things that would damage the make @-@ up " . To make Chopra look authentic , the makeup team used Chopra 's mother 's and grandmother ’ s photos to create her look . She had to gain five kg weight to fit her aging character .

 Principal photography began in March 2010 with Chopra and Irrfan Khan in Kashmir . Locations included Shalimar Bagh and Dal Lake in Srinagar . The cast and crew were provided with two @-@ tier security coverage by the Central Reserve Police Force ( <unk> ) and the Jammu & Kashmir Police , due to unrest in the valley . The film was also shot in Gulmarg , Delhi and Coorg , which included extensive shooting in the forests . Other locations were Puducherry , Mumbai , Hyderabad and in Russia . During filming Chopra was restricted from eating and drinking while donning the prosthetic makeup ( which took five hours to apply ) . 
 = = Soundtrack = = 
 The film 's score and songs were composed by Vishal Bhardwaj , with lyrics by Gulzar . Its soundtrack contains seven songs and two reprise versions . The soundtrack was digitally released on Ovi ( Nokia ) on 21 January 2011 , and on CD 24 January 2011 . The song " Darling " is based on the Russian folk song " Kalinka " , and contains several Russian words ( one of Susanna 's husbands was Russian ) . " Kalinka " is credited on the album cover . " Tere Liye " , sung by Suresh <unk> , was not used in the film . 
 The soundtrack received positive reviews from music critics . The Indo @-@ Asian News Service gave the album 3 @.@ 5 stars ( out of 5 ) : " Bharadwaj has composed a wonderful album that is not a clone of his previous work . It exudes freshness and is worth listening . However , the songs would not have achieved zenith without Gulzar 's lovely lyrics . The team has done it again " . Bollywood Hungama rated the album a 3 ( out of 5 ) : " 7 Khoon Maaf is a good album with a couple of definite hits , couple of skip worthy ones and the remaining have the potential to grow . Since 7 Khoon Maaf is not a routine Bollywood affair , it can 't be expecting a quick pick at the stands from Day One " . The Hindustan Times noted that the soundtrack takes the listener through a variety of moods : " Bhardwaj has certainly succeeded in adding new sounds to his catalogue . He continues to evade Bollywood monotony with this soundtrack [ ... ] an innovative effort . "

 The film 's preview and trailer were released on 24 December 2010 to a positive response from critics , who praised the whole presentation and Chopra 's dialogues particularly : " <unk> ki har <unk> ne <unk> na <unk> toh yeh <unk> <unk> , ki main <unk> pati se <unk> <unk> ke <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " ( " Every wife in the entire world must have once in her lifetime thought of how to get rid of her husband forever " ) . Following the preview @-@ trailer launches , Chopra promoted the film by appearing with seven men ( dressed as bridegrooms ) at the Radio Mirchi FM studio . The succession of marriages and funerals was illustrated at a promotional event for the film , where Chopra appeared as a Catholic bride in a wedding gown holding a bouquet . A short time later she reappeared as a widow in mourning , for her husbands ' funerals . 
 Emphasizing the film 's theme , Chopra introduced a " seven ways to lose your Valentine " press kit for reporters at a Valentines Day promotion . The kit contained a rope , a syringe , a knife , a bottle of poison , a <unk> of potassium cyanide , an ice pick and a blister pack of Viagra , which was based on Susanna 's way to kill her husbands in the film . In February 2011 , a book entitled Susanna 's Seven Husbands was released by Penguin Books as a collector 's edition including the novella , the short story and the film ’ s screenplay . 
 The film was screened at the 61st Berlin International Film Festival as part of its world premiere in the festival 's Panorama section . At the <unk> Palace ( a Berlin theatre ) an audience of some 2 @,@ 500 people watched the film on the festival 's final evening , giving the director and the nine cast and crew members present a standing ovation when they appeared onstage . 7 Khoon Maaf was originally scheduled for release on 21 January 2011 , but was postponed a month to avoid conflicting with Dhobi Ghat .

 Rioli moved to Melbourne in 2004 as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , where he attended and boarded at Scotch College for four years whilst playing for the school 's football team . The move came about after a decade @-@ long relationship between the school and Indigenous communities of the Northern Territory . Dr. Rob Smith , a teacher at Scotch College , had expanded the school 's four @-@ week exchange program for talented Indigenous footballers into a full scholarship program , following numerous tours of the Tiwi Islands and specifically , Bathurst Island . Rioli was the first selected into the program . He originally made the trip alongside his cousin Steven , after just three days in Melbourne the two re @-@ packed their bags with the intention of returning home . In an effort to retain the boys , Smith phoned Michael Long , who came out to the school with Derek <unk> and <unk> Rioli , another uncle . Long said he knew Cyril was making a life @-@ defining choice at just 14 ; " That was the big moment , whether he 'd tough it out or go " . Steven returned home and Cyril persisted in Melbourne . Nicknamed " Junior " or " Junior Boy " , he shone in his final season with Scotch College , despite suffering injuries throughout the season ; including a broken collarbone and a severely damaged ankle . He developed somewhat of a cult following whilst playing for the school , following a video clip of his highlights being uploaded to YouTube . He has since stated that he believes the early move to school in Melbourne made the transition a lot easier . 
 Rioli was also a standout performer in the 2007 AFL national under 18 championships , becoming the only Northern <unk> to earn All @-@ Australian honours , following a seven @-@ goal performance in a match against Queensland . He was tipped to go high in the national draft , from anywhere between five and twenty @-@ five . In this final year of junior football , he was one of five players , including Trent <unk> , to be chronicled in the book The Draft : Inside the AFL 's Search for Talent , by The Age journalist Emma Quayle . 
 Despite Rioli 's speed , evasiveness and flashy tricks , the scouts at the AFL 's draft camp were still to be convinced of his dedication , with his skin folds being described as " less than brilliant " and his commitment to AFL still being questionable . Prior to the draft , Rioli said " I have had a few clubs call me , and it 's just confusing . I love playing footy , and I think I am pretty good at it , but it doesn 't really matter where ( I go in the draft ) .

 Rioli made his AFL debut in Hawthorn 's defeat of the Melbourne Football Club at the Melbourne Cricket Ground ( MCG ) in round one 2008 . He built a reputation around his ability to chase and pressure the opposition as they attempted to rebound from the forward line . In round six , he was nominated for the AFL Rising Star Award , after his display against Richmond , in which he received a nomination for Goal of the Year . Rioli appeared in every game in his debut season , including an inspirational performance in Hawthorn 's defeat of Geelong in the 2008 AFL Grand Final . His impact on the game was described as instrumental as Hawthorn defeated Geelong , in the club 's first premiership since 1991 . Rioli assisted in a couple of first quarter goals and kicked two goals for himself in the final , achieving a total of 10 possessions in the game . After the game Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson said , " We knew Cyril was a beauty , but you just never anticipate that they 're going to play every game of the season and be able to play in a grand final . " With nothing but praise for Rioli , Clarkson also made mention of his achievements in 2008 , " He 's got a premiership medal now , but he 's been in contention for mark of the year , goal of the year and the rising star and he 's been very , very consistent . He 's a 15 @-@ possession , five @-@ tackle a game player with a goal or two – he 's been a sensational acquisition to our club . 
 Rioli finished second overall in the 2008 AFL Rising Star Award , the award was won by Fremantle 's Rhys Palmer with 44 votes , ahead of Rioli on 37 .

 In February 2009 , Rioli was selected for the Indigenous All @-@ Stars that played a pre @-@ season match against the Adelaide Football Club . Following his successful debut season and promising start to his second , he was compared to Gary Ablett Jr . , who also began his career as a small forward with the potential to become a " dominant , match @-@ winning midfielder " . This was due to the " sublime skills " he displays , and his " ability to make something out of nothing with vision and an instinct for the game . " Former footballer and journalist Garry Lyon said in an article for The Age , that when Rioli is ready to take on a greater workload in the midfield , will be determined by his physical and aerobic capacity . Rioli 's greatest challenge in the coming 12 months being to incorporate the " gut " running into his game that the likes of Ablett , Chris Judd , Lenny Hayes and Brett Kirk have mastered . 
 In May , journalist Mike Sheahan proclaimed that Rioli 's exploits on the field were being overlooked . He said whilst Hawthorn as a club was being analysed and dissected , Rioli wasn 't getting the recognition he deserved . According to Champion Data , only captain Sam Mitchell had been more effective for Hawthorn at this time in the year . Following 36 consecutive games after being drafted , Rioli tore his hamstring in round 11 2009 against the Sydney Swans . Missing his first regular season match in round 12 , he spent a month on the sidelines before returning against North Melbourne in round 15 . The Hawks were defeated in all three games he missed . His return was described as a " big boost " for Hawthorn 's last @-@ ditch bid to revive its season , after many commentators said the club was suffering a " premiership hangover " . Following his return , it was announced that Rioli had re @-@ signed with Hawthorn for a further three years . Hawthorn eventually faltered in the final round of the home and away season , losing to Essendon by 17 points . Thus , failing to qualify for the finals . Rioli 's season was however , still seen as impressive . In the AFL website 's end of year review , it was predicted that he will be considered an elite AFL player in the coming years . 
 Approaching the end of the 2009 season , Rioli bought his first apartment and declared his allegiance to spending his whole career with Hawthorn , he also revealed his intentions to help bring more players down from the Northern Territory ; " That 's the real goal for me , to get more kids drafted from the Northern Territory . " After Hawthorn 's demise in 2009 , Rioli gave his support to a project which aims to teach Indigenous people in remote areas about the damage drugs and alcohol can do to the brain . An image of him is used in flip charts developed by the Menzies School of Health Research as an example of a person with a healthy brain . Sheree <unk> , the lead researcher at Menzies School , says there is a lack of knowledge in remote communities about how to treat drug and alcohol addiction , with the problem being " very , very widespread . " At the end of 2009 , he was awarded the AFL Coaches Association award for Best Young Player , covering his first two years in football . He also received the Phil <unk> Medal ( Goal of the Year award ) for his round seven effort against Essendon , and came second in the Peter Crimmins Medal behind the club 's captain Sam Mitchell . When Rioli kicked the goal of the year , commentator Bruce McAvaney described him as a " delicious young footballer " and the description " delicious " has become strongly associated with both Rioli and McAvaney .

 = David III of Tao = 
 David III Kuropalates ( Georgian : <unk> III <unk> , Davit ’ III <unk> ) or David III the Great ( <unk> III <unk> , Davit ’ III Didi ) , also known as David II , ( c . 930s – 1000 or 1001 ) was a Georgian prince of the Bagratid family of Tao , a historic region in the Georgian – Armenian <unk> , from 966 until his murder in 1000 . Kuropalates was a Byzantine courtier title bestowed upon him in 978 and again in 990 . 
 David is best known for his crucial assistance to the Byzantine Macedonian dynasty in the 976 – 9 civil war and his unique role in the political unification of various Georgian polities as well as his patronage of Christian culture and learning . Between 987 and 989 , David joined his friend Bardas Phocas in a revolt against the Byzantine emperor Basil II , but was defeated and agreed to cede his lands to the empire on his death . Yet he was able to secure for his heir , Bagrat III , an opportunity to become the first ruler of a unified Georgian kingdom . 
 = = History = = 
 David was the younger son of <unk> V , a representative of the Second House of Tao , a branch of the Kartli line of the Georgian Bagrationi ( Bagratid ) dynasty which held sway over Tao ( a province on the historic Georgian @-@ Armenian border known to the Armenians as <unk> ; now part of Turkey ) since the extinction of the original Tao line in the 940s . 
 = = = Alliance with the Byzantine Empire = = = 
 He succeeded his brother , Bagrat II , as a duke of Tao in 966 , and through his expansionist policy and flexible diplomacy began assembling a larger state . In order to enact his ambitious plans , David had to secure his independence from the Byzantine Empire , which would reach its greatest height under the emperor Basil II ( r . 976 @-@ 1025 ) . 
 The Byzantines ' eastern neighbors – the fragmented Armenian and Georgian principalities – rarely threatened the empire directly , but were of particular interest to Constantinople as they controlled strategic international trade routes that ran through their domains . The Byzantines had already annexed the Armenian principalities of Taron ( 966 ) and Manzikert ( 968 ) and posed a potential danger to the constellation of several Georgian Bagratid principalities known as Tao @-@ Klarjeti . However , the integrity of the empire itself was under serious threat after a full @-@ scale rebellion , led by Bardas Skleros , broke out in 976 . Following a series of successful battles the rebels swept across Asia Minor and threatened Constantinople itself . In the urgency of a situation , the young emperor Basil requested aid from David of Tao , who promptly responded and sent 12 @,@ 000 first @-@ rate cavalry troops under the command of Tornikios to reinforce the recently defeated loyal Byzantine general Bardas Phokas , thereby contributing to the decisive loyalist victory at the Battle of <unk> near Caesarea on 24 March 979 . 
 David 's reward was the lifetime rule of key imperial territories in eastern Asia Minor , known to the contemporary Georgian sources as the " Upper Lands of Greece " ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , consisting chiefly of northwestern Armenian lands : the city of Theodosiopolis or Karin ( Geo . <unk> @-@ <unk> , present @-@ day Erzurum , Turkey ) , <unk> , Hark ( now Muş Province ) , <unk> , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> , and <unk> . On this occasion , he was granted the high Byzantine court title of kouropalates . Basil II also rewarded the valor of David ’ s commander Tornikios by funding a Georgian Orthodox monastery on Mount Athos . Although populated now chiefly with Greek monks , it is to this day known as <unk> , " of the Iberians ( i.e. Georgians ) " . 
 These formidable acquisitions made David the most influential ruler in the Caucasus , enabling him to interfere in and arbitrate dynastic disputes in both Georgia and Armenia . The medieval Georgian authors call him " greatest of all the kings of Tao " and the eleventh @-@ century Armenian chronicler Aristakes <unk> describes him as : 
 a mighty man , a builder of the world , very honorable , a lover of the poor , indeed , the definition of peace . For in his day it was as the prophecy states : everyone reposed under his vine and his fig tree . 
 Being in control of highly important commercial centers , his principality profited from taxing the major trading routes running through southwestern Caucasus and eastern Anatolia . David invested these revenues in extensive building projects : constructing towns , forts and churches , and promoting Georgian monastic communities and cultural activities both in Georgia and abroad . 
 = = = Issue of succession = = = 
 Having no children of his own , David adopted his kinsman , the young prince Bagrat , heir to the Bagratid throne of Kartli ( Iberia ) . He did so at the request of the energetic Georgian nobleman <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> . Through his fortunate bloodlines Bagrat was destined to sit upon two thrones . Furthermore , through his mother <unk> , sister of the childless Abkhazian king Theodosius III , Bagrat was a potential heir to the realm of Abkhazia . Making a plan for the creation of an all @-@ Georgian state , David occupied Kartli for his foster @-@ son in 976 and repulsed the troops from the easternmost Georgian kingdom of Kakheti , which had recently occupied the western sector of Kartli with its rock @-@ hewn city of <unk> . Two years later , in 978 , David and <unk> @-@ <unk> secured the crown of Abkhazia for Bagrat by displacing Theodosius III . 
 David ’ s good fortunes changed in 987 when he , anxious to make his extensive possessions a hereditary Bagratid domain , joined his long @-@ time friend Bardas Phokas in a rebellion against the emperor Basil . Once the rebels were defeated by the Byzantine @-@ Rus ' forces in 989 , Basil dispatched a strong force under John of Chaldea to punish the Georgians , and David had to submit . Reconciled with the emperor , he was granted , in c . 990 , the title of <unk> again in return for his promise that upon his death the lands previously placed under his sovereignty would revert to the Byzantine Empire . 
 Another problem arose around the same year , when Bagrat of Abkhazia planned a punitive expedition against the non @-@ submissive duke Rati of <unk> in Lower Kartli . Persuaded that his foster @-@ son intended to attack Tao and kill him , David crushed the army led by Bagrat ’ s natural father Gurgen on its march to <unk> . As a medieval Georgian chronicler relates : 
 Bagrat then went [ to David ] alone , fell at his feet and swore that he was going against Rati . [ David ] believed that too and released him in peace . 
 = = = Last years and death = = = 
 After the reconciliation with the emperor and his kinsmen , David led a series of successful raids against the Muslim emirates of Lake Van and Azerbaijan . Bagrat II of Georgia ( grandfather of Bagrat , David ’ s adoptee ) , and Gagik I of Armenia allied themselves with David , who recaptured Manzikert from the Marwanid emir of Diyar Bakr about 993 and raided Akhlat , another important stronghold of this Kurdish dynasty , in 997 . <unk> , the <unk> emir of Azerbaijan , was also twice defeated , the second time decisively , in 998 , near <unk> . 
 David was murdered by his nobles early in 1000 . According to Aristakes : 
 They had mixed poison into the communion on Good Thursday , and had given it to him [ Dawit ' ] to drink , causing that venerable man to choke to death . [ This was ] because they had wearied of him , and were interested in promises [ made to them ] earlier by the emperor . 
 Although the Georgian Chronicles maintain that David died in 1001 , several Armenian and Muslim accounts suggest he may have died in 1000 . Aristakes gives the date of David ’ s death as March 28 , 1000 , which is closely corroborated by another Armenian chronicler <unk> who says David died on the Easter day of the year 449 of the Armenian calendar , i.e. , March 31 , 1000 . Yet another Armenian , Samuel <unk> , also puts the date as 1000 . 
 = = = Wars of the Kuropalates ’ succession = = = 
 Basil II was at that time in the eastern provinces of his empire , wintering on the plain of Tarsus following his campaign against the Fatimid dynasty in Syria . On hearing of David ’ s death he marched north @-@ eastward to claim the lands David had promised to the emperor . The local Georgian and Armenian nobility submitted without any serious resistance . The only notable incident occurred when a quarrel between a Georgian soldier and a Varangian Guardsman over a bale of hay developed into a major fight , involving 6 @,@ 000 Varangians and taking the lives of thirty Georgian high @-@ ranking nobles . 
 King Bagrat , David ’ s foster @-@ son , met with Basil but , unable to prevent the annexation of David ’ s realm , had to recognize the new borders in reward of the imperial title of kouropalates . Despite this setback , Bagrat was able to become the first king of an all @-@ Georgian unified monarchy , a result made possible largely by the efforts of David of Tao , who , as the modern scholar Stephen Rapp puts in , " appropriately ranks high on any ' Top Ten ' list of Georgian history . " 
 There is some disagreement among modern scholars on whether David ceded to the Byzantines only those lands which had been granted to him as a reward for his assistance against the rebel Bardas Skleros , or if it had been the whole of his principality that was acquired by Basil II . As the former was endowed upon David for lifetime stewardship , it would be more reasonable to assume that he conceded his entire realm , i.e. , Thither Tao / <unk> and the adjacent Armenian counties up to Lake Van . Whatever the extent of David ’ s domain , the Georgian kings would not so easily reconcile with the loss of those territories , leading to a series of conflicts with the Byzantine Empire in the eleventh century . 
 = Siege of Nicaea ( 727 ) = 
 The Siege of Nicaea of 727 was an unsuccessful attempt by the Umayyad Caliphate to capture the Byzantine city of Nicaea , the capital of the Opsician Theme . Ever since its failure to capture the Byzantine Empire 's capital , Constantinople , in 717 – 718 , the Caliphate had launched a series of raids into Byzantine Asia Minor . In 727 , the Arab army , led by one of the Caliph 's sons , penetrated deep into Asia Minor , sacked two Byzantine fortresses and in late July arrived before Nicaea . Despite constant attacks for 40 days , the city held firm and the Arabs withdrew and returned to the Caliphate . The successful repulsion of the attack was a major boost for Byzantine emperor Leo III the Isaurian 's recently initiated campaign to abolish the veneration of icons in the Empire ; Leo claimed it as evidence of divine favour for his policy . The siege of Nicaea marks also the high point of the Umayyad raids , as new threats and defeats on their far @-@ flung frontiers diverted Umayyad strength elsewhere , while Byzantine power gradually recovered . 
 = = Background = = 
 Following the failure of the year @-@ long assault by the Umayyad armies on the Byzantine capital Constantinople in 717 – 718 , a short period of peace followed as the Umayyads licked their wounds , suppressed the rebellion of Yazid ibn al @-@ Muhallab and re @-@ assessed their priorities . When warfare on the Arab – Byzantine frontier recommenced in 720 , the strategic focus of the Caliphate had shifted away from outright conquest . The Muslim raids across the Taurus Mountains into Byzantine Asia Minor still occurred regularly every spring and summer , sometimes accompanied by naval raids and followed by a winter expedition ; they devastated large tracts of Asia Minor , and destroyed several fortresses ; but the Arabs did not attempt to hold on to captured strongholds on the west side of the Taurus Mountains . Byzantine reaction during these years was passive , as the Empire still nursed its strength against the vastly superior resources of the Caliphate . The Byzantines did not obstruct or confront the raiding Arab armies , but rather retreated to well @-@ fortified positions scattered throughout Asia Minor . 
 After the accession of Caliph Hisham ( r . 723 – 743 ) , the scale and ambition of the Muslim raids grew . One of the most prominent Umayyad leaders in these campaigns was Hisham 's son Mu 'awiya , who led expeditions in 725 and 726 , the first of which went as far west as Dorylaion . 
 = = Invasion of 727 and the siege of Nicaea = = 
 In summer 727 , another large @-@ scale invasion was led by Mu 'awiya , with Abdallah al @-@ Battal heading the vanguard of the army . The Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor claims that the vanguard alone numbered 15 @,@ 000 men and the entire invasion force 100 @,@ 000 , clearly a grossly inflated number . Theophanes also records a certain Amr as Mu 'awiya 's second @-@ in @-@ command , but Arab sources are unambiguous in this regard . The Arab army moved west into northwestern Asia Minor , and the vanguard under al @-@ Battal attacked and sacked the town of Gangra in Paphlagonia and a place called in Arab sources <unk> , possibly the fort of <unk> in Phrygia . Gangra was razed to the ground , but during the attack on <unk> the Arabs , especially the Antiochene contingent , are said to have suffered heavy losses . 
 From there , the Arabs turned west towards Nicaea , the chief city of Bithynia and capital of the powerful Opsician Theme . The Arabs arrived before the city in late July , with al @-@ Battal 's vanguard preceding the main army . The Byzantines , probably under the command of the Count of the <unk> , Artabasdos , did not meet them in the field , but instead retreated behind the city 's walls . The Arabs assaulted the city for forty days , employing siege engines which destroyed a part of the walls , but eventually failed to take it . In late August , they raised the siege and departed , taking along many captives and much booty . The 12th @-@ century chronicle of Michael the Syrian claims that the city 's inhabitants abandoned it and fled by ship through Lake <unk> , whereupon the Arabs destroyed Nicaea , but this is clearly an error . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The repulsion of the Arab assault on Nicaea was an important success for the Byzantines . Emperor Leo III the Isaurian ( r . 717 – 741 ) regarded the city 's survival as a sign of divine favour towards his newly instituted iconoclastic policies , and was encouraged to drive them further . This is probably related to an incident mentioned in the account of Theophanes , where a certain Constantine , who served as a groom ( <unk> ) to Artabasdos , threw a stone on an icon of the Virgin Mary and then trampled on it . The soldier was killed the next day by a catapult , a fact which Theophanes reports as evidence of divine vengeance . However , this passage shows strong signs of tampering by the fervently anti @-@ iconoclast Theophanes , from what was probably originally a pro @-@ iconoclast story . 
 Militarily , the siege of Nicaea was the high @-@ water @-@ mark of the post @-@ 718 Umayyad raids ; never again would Umayyad armies penetrate as deeply into Asia Minor . Increasingly thereafter the Syro @-@ Jaziran army , that provided the manpower for the raids against Byzantium , was diverted in the hard and fruitless wars against the Khazars in the Caucasus : the Khazars inflicted a heavy defeat on the Muslims in 730 , and a Byzantine – Khazar alliance was sealed by the marriage of Leo III 's son and heir Constantine V ( r . 741 – 775 ) with the Khazar princess Irene shortly after . Over the next few years , while Byzantine strength revived , the Muslim military situation on all fronts of the over @-@ extended Caliphate deteriorated . Consequently , in the 730s , Arab raids were mostly limited to the immediate frontier regions and their successes became fewer . By 740 , when the Umayyads assembled the largest invasion force fielded after 718 , the Byzantines had recovered enough to inflict a heavy defeat against them at the Battle of Akroinon . 
 = Walls of Dubrovnik = 
 The Walls of Dubrovnik ( Croatian : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) are a series of defensive stone walls that have surrounded and protected the citizens of the afterward proclaimed maritime city @-@ state of Dubrovnik ( Ragusa ) , situated in southern Croatia , since the city 's founding prior to the 7th century as a Byzantium castrum on a rocky island named Laus ( <unk> or Lave ) . With numerous additions and modifications throughout their history , they have been considered to be amongst the great fortification systems of the Middle Ages , as they were never breached by a hostile army during this time period . In 1979 , the old city of Dubrovnik , which includes a substantial portion of the old walls of Dubrovnik , joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites . 
 The oldest systems of fortifications around the town were likely wooden palisades . Today 's intact city walls , constructed mainly during the 12th – 17th centuries , mostly a double line , have long been a source of pride for Dubrovnik . The walls run an uninterrupted course of approximately 1 @,@ 940 metres ( 6 @,@ 360 ft ) in length , encircling most of the old city , and reach a maximum height of about 25 metres ( 82 ft ) . The bulk of the existing walls and fortifications were constructed during the 14th and 15th centuries , but were continually extended and strengthened up until the 17th century . 
 This complex structure , amongst the largest and most complete in Europe , protected the freedom and safety of a " civilised " and " sophisticated " republic that flourished in peace and prosperity for some five centuries . The walls were reinforced by three circular and 14 quadrangular towers , five bastions ( bulwarks ) , two angular fortifications and the large St. John 's Fortress . Land walls were additionally reinforced by one larger bastion and nine smaller semicircular ones , like the casemate Fort Bokar , the oldest preserved fort of that kind in Europe . The moat that ran around the outside section of the city walls , which were armed by more than 120 cannons , provided superb city defense capabilities . 
 = = Former city walls = = 
 The construction of the first limestone forts around the city began in the Early Middle Ages , towards the end of the 8th century . But , the " old chronicles " say that some sort of castle reliably existed on the Lave peninsula quite a long time prior to that . It is certain that the early town on Laus Island was also surrounded by defensive walls , probably mainly by wooden palisades . The fact that Dubrovnik managed to survive a fifteen @-@ month @-@ long invasion by the Saracens in the 9th century proves how well the city was fortified . 
 The city first spread towards the uninhabited eastern part of the islet , which explains why the current name for the southeast part of the city , near St. John 's Fortress , is called Pustijerna . The name " Pustijerna " comes from the Latin statement " post terra " , which means " outside the town " . In the 9th and 10th centuries , the defensive wall enclosed the eastern portion of the city . When the sea channel separating the city from mainland was filled with earth in the 11th century , the city merged with the settlement on land , and soon , a single wall was built around the area of the present @-@ day city core . 
 During this same time period , Dubrovnik and the surrounding area were described as a part of the Croatian ( <unk> ) entity , in one of the works by the famous Arab geographer Muhammad al @-@ Idrisi . In his book Nuzhat al @-@ <unk> fi <unk> al @-@ <unk> ( English : Joy for those who wish to sail over the world ) from 1154 , he mentioned Dubrovnik as the southernmost city of " the country of Croatia and Dalmatia " . 
 The basic city plan dates from 1292 , when the port was rebuilt following a fire . The whole city was entirely enclosed in the 13th century , except for the Dominican monastery , which came under its protection later on , during the 14th century . 
 = = Modern @-@ day city walls = = 
 The city walls have been preserved to the present day , not only because of the knowledge of the skilled construction workers and the constant care provided by city dwellers that maintained and rebuilt the structures as needed , but also because of the brilliantly reputed diplomacy in Ragusa , which managed on many occasions to avoid dangerous measures taken by enemies against the Republic of Ragusa . 
 The present shape of the walls was defined in the 14th century after the city gained its full independence from Venetian suzerainty , but the peak of its construction lasted from the beginning of the 15th century until the latter half of the 16th century . Being constructed very solidly , the walls were generally unaffected by a strong earthquake occurring in 1667 . The largest stimulus for continued development and emergency repairs and works of the Ragusan fortresses came as a result of the danger of unexpected attack by Turkish military forces , especially after they conquered Constantinople in 1453 . The city was also under latent danger of attack by the Venetians . For centuries the people of Dubrovnik were able to preserve their city @-@ republic by skillful maneuvering between East and West . A strategic treaty with Turkey protracted Ragusa ’ s liberty and maintained the opportunity for a major trading role between the Ottoman Empire and Europe . 
 The irregular parallelogram surrounding Dubrovnik consists of four strong fortresses at its most significant points . To the north is the strong circular Minčeta Tower , and to the east side of the city port is the Revelin Fortress . The western city entrance is protected by the strong and nicely @-@ shaped Fort Bokar , and the strong , freestanding , St. Lawrence Fortress ( also known as Lovrijenac ) , protects the western side of the city from possible land and sea assaults . The large and complex St. John Fortress is located on the southeast side of the city . 
 = = = Land Walls = = = 
 The main wall on the landside is 4 metres ( 13 ft ) to 6 metres ( 20 ft ) thick , and , at certain locations , the walls reach up to 25 meters ( 80 feet ) in height . The land walls stretch from Fort Bokar in the west to the detached Revelin Fortress in the east . On the landside , the wall is protected with an additional range of slanted supporting walls as defense against artillery fire , especially against possible Ottoman attacks . 
 = = = = Gates = = = = 
 The town has four city gates : two that lead to the harbor and two ( with drawbridges ) that lead to the mainland . During the time period when the Austrian Empire controlled the city , two more gates were opened in the wall . 
 Communication with the outside world on the land side was maintained with the city through two main well @-@ protected city gates , one placed on the western side of the city and the other placed on the eastern side . These entrances were constructed so that communications with the city could not be carried out directly ; the messenger had to enter through multiple doors and walk down a winding passageway , which is evidence of the security measures taken as a last defense against the possibility of a surprise breach or entrance of unexpected visitors . 
 = = = = = Gate of Pile = = = = = 
 The Pile Gates are a well @-@ fortified complex with multiple doors , defended by Fort Bokar and the moat that ran around the outside section of the city walls . At the entrance gate to the Old Town , on the western side of the land walls , there is a stone bridge between two Gothic arches , which were designed by the esteemed architect Paskoje Miličević in 1471 . That bridge connects to another bridge , a wooden drawbridge which can be pulled up . During the republican era , the wooden drawbridge to the Pile Gate was hoisted each night with considerable pomp in a ceremony which delivered the city 's keys to the Ragusan rector . Today , it spans a dry moat whose garden offers respite from crowds . Above the bridges , over the arch of town 's principal gateway , there is a statue of city patron Saint Blaise ( Croatian : Sveti Vlaho ) , with a model of the Renaissance city . After passing the Pile Gate 's original Gothic inner gateway , it is possible to reach one of a three access points to the city walls . 
 = = = = = Gate of Ploče = = = = = 
 On the eastern side of the land walls stands the second major entrance to the city , the Gate of Ploče . This gate is protected by the freestanding Revelin Fortress , which are connected by a wooden drawbridge and a twin @-@ spanned stone bridge spanning a protective ditch . The Outer Gate of Ploče was designed and constructed by architect Mihajlo <unk> in 1628 , while the two bridges to the Revelin Fortress were built in the 15th century by Paskoje Miličević . Miličević was also designed the Pile Gate bridges , which explains the similarities between the bridges . Over the bridge , just like with the Gate of Pile , there is the statue of Saint Blaise , the patron saint of Dubrovnik .

 The main wall on the sea @-@ facing side of Dubrovnik stretches from Fort Bokar in the west to St. John Fortress in the south , and to the Revelin Fortress on the land @-@ side . These walls are 1 @.@ 5 to 5 meters ( 5 – 16 feet ) thick , depending on their location and its strategic importance . The purpose of these walls were to help defend the city from sea @-@ based attacks , particularly from the Republic of Venice , which was often considered a threat to Dubrovnik 's safety . 
 = = = = City Harbour = = = = 
 One of the oldest sectors of Dubrovnik was constructed around a Late Antique castle by the sea , which stretched landwards a bit more than it does today . It was constructed on the site of the Pre @-@ Romanesque cathedral and the Rector 's Palace , thus encircling the city 's harbour . The harbour was designed and constructed by engineer Paskoje Miličević in the late 15th century . Notably , the harbour was noticeably painted on the palm of St. Blaise in a triptych painted by the artist Nikola Božidarević around 1500 . 
 The most prominent portion of the harbour is the three enormous arches ( the fourth original arch was walled in ) of a large arsenal built in the late 12th century and enlarged in the latter part 15th century . The harbour is also the oldest shipyard within the city and is still in use today . 
 Porporela was built in 1873 , next to St. John Fortress . The Kase jetty ( <unk> Breakwater ) was built in 1485 , according to the design of Paskoje Miličević , in order to defend the harbour and protect it from south @-@ eastern winds and waves . The breakwater thus shortened the harbour 's bulky chain stretched in the night from the St. John Fortress to St. Luke 's tower . It was constructed of huge stone blocks laid over wooden foundations without binder . 
 Today , the arsenal hosts the City Café and a movie theatre , whereas both the harbour and Porporela have become pleasant promenades and tourist attractions . 
 = = = = Gates = = = = 
 In the city port area , one of the most significant areas of the maritime trade city , there were two entrances : the Gate of Ponte ( port ) and the Fishmarket Gate .

 The fall of Constantinople in 1453 to the Ottomans was a clear sign to the cautious citizens of Dubrovnik that ample defensive measures were quickly needed , the strengthening of its defensive structures the foremost of the issues . The fall of Bosnia , which followed soon in 1463 , only hastened the works . As a result , the Republic invited the architect Michelozzo di Bartolomeo of Florence to direct the improvement of the city 's defenses . His work in Dubrovnik resulted in the construction and expansion of numerous buildings of key importance for the defense of Dubrovnik . 
 = = = = Minčeta Tower = = = = 
 The Minčeta Tower was built by a local builder named <unk> <unk> and Italian engineers sent by Pope Pius II in 1463 , at the height of the Turkish threat . Originally as a strong four @-@ sided fort , it is the most prominent point in the defensive system towards the land . The tower 's name derives from the name of the <unk> family , who owned the ground upon which the tower was built . By its height and impressive volume , the tower dominates the northwestern high part of the city and its walls . In the middle of the 15th century , around the earlier quadrilateral fort , Michelozzo built a new round tower using new warfare technique and joined it to the new system of low scarp walls . The full six @-@ meter ( 20 feet ) thick walls of the new tower had a series of protected gun ports . The architect and sculptor Giorgio da Sebenico of Zadar continued the work on the Minčeta tower . He designed and built the high narrow round tower while the battlements are a later addition . The tower was completed in 1464 and became the symbol of the unconquerable city of Dubrovnik . 
 After a long excavation , a 16th @-@ century cannon foundry was discovered under Minčeta Tower in Gornji <unk> ( Upper Tower ) . It is now a museum . 
 Since Minčeta Tower is the highest point of the wall , it is considered to offer a seemingly " unforgettable " view on the city . 
 = = = = Fort Bokar = = = = 
 The Fort Bokar , often called " Zvjezdan " , is considered to be amongst the most beautiful instances of harmonious and functional fortification architecture . Built as a two @-@ story casemate fortress by Michelozzo from 1461 to 1463 , while the city walls were being reconstructed , it stands in front of the medieval wall face protruding into space almost with its whole cylindrical volume . It was conceived as the key point in the defense of the Pila Gate , the western fortified entrance of the city ; and after the Minčeta Tower , it is the second key point in the defense of the western land approach to the city . It is said to be the oldest <unk> fortress in Europe , which contains a small lapidary collection and numerous cannons . 
 = = = = St. John Fortress = = = = 
 The St. John Fortress ( Croatian : Sveti Ivan ) , often called <unk> Tower , is a complex monumental building on the southeastern side of the old city port , controlling and protecting its entrance . The first fort was built in the mid 14th century , but it was modified on several occasions in the course of the 15th and 16th centuries , which can be seen in the triptych made by the painter Nikola Božidarević in the Dominican monastery . The painting shows Saint Blaise , the patron saint of Dubrovnik . Dominant in the port ambiance , the St. John Fortress prevented access of pirates and other enemy ships . Always cautious at the first sign of danger , the inhabitants of Dubrovnik used to close the entry into the port with heavy chains stretched between the St. John Fortress and the Kase jetty , and they also used to wall up all the port entries to the Great Arsenal . 
 Today , the fortress houses an aquarium on the ground floor , stocked with fishes from various parts of the Adriatic Sea . On the upper floors there is an ethnographic and a maritime museum devoted to the Republic Maritime Period , the Age of Steam , the Second World War , and the section of techniques of sailing and navigation .

 = = = = Revelin Fortress = = = = 
 In the period of unmistakable Turkish danger and the fall of Bosnia under Turkish rule , a detached fortress providing additional protection to the land approach to the eastern Ploče Gate was built to the east of the city in 1462 . The name Revelin derives from <unk> ( ravelin ) , a term in military architecture which refers to work built opposite the city gate in order to afford better protection from enemy attack . Danger of Venetian assault suddenly increased in the times of the First Holy League , and it was necessary to strengthen this vulnerable point of the city fortifications . The Senate hired Antonio Ferramolino , an experienced builder of fortresses in the service of the Spanish admiral Doria , a trusted friend of the Republic . In 1538 the Senate approved his drawings of the new , much stronger Revelin Fortress . It took 11 years to build it , and during that time all other construction work in the city had stopped in order to finish this fortress as soon as possible . 
 The new Revelin became the strongest of the city fortresses , safeguarding the eastern land approach to the city . Shaped in the form of an irregular quadrilateral with one of its sides descending towards the sea , it is protected by a deep ditch on the other . One bridge crosses the protective ditch and connects it to the Ploče Gate , while another bridge connects it to the eastern suburb . The construction work was executed so perfectly so that the devastating earthquake of 1667 did not damage Revelin . Divided into three large vaulted rooms in its interior , Revelin became the administrative center of the Republic . 
 = = = = St. Lawrence Fortress = = = = 
 St. Lawrence Fortress ( Croatian : Lovrijenac ) , often called Dubrovnik 's Gibraltar , is located outside the western city walls , 37 metres ( 121 ft ) above sea level . The fortress has a quadrilateral court with mighty arches and , as its height is uneven , it has 3 terraces with powerful parapets with the broadest one looking south towards the sea . Lovrijenac was defended with 10 large cannons , being the largest and most famous called " Lizard " ( Croatian : <unk> ) . The walls exposed to enemy fire are almost 12 meters ( 39 feet ) thick , but the large wall surface facing the city does not exceed 60 centimetres ( 2 feet ) . Two drawbridges lead to the fort , there being the inscription " Non Bene Pro Toto Libertas <unk> Auro " – " Freedom is not to be sold for all the treasures in the world . " above the gate . To ensure loyalty , the troops in St. Lawrence Fortress were rotated every 30 days . And to ensure complete loyalty , they were given only 30 days of rations when they went into the fort . According to old scripts it was built in only three months . 
 Today its interior is one of the most dignified stages in Europe , and a well @-@ known place for William Shakespeare 's Hamlet performances .

 = = = Walls of Ston = = = 
 The Walls of Ston are originally a series of defensive stone walls of more than 7 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) long . Despite its small size , the well protected Republic of Ragusa decided to use Pelješac to build another line of defense . At Pelješac 's narrowest point , just before joining the mainland , a wall from Ston to Mali Ston was built . 
 Today 's 5 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometre ( 3 @.@ 4 mi ) long wall that links these two small communities has the shape of a pentagon . It was completed in the 15th century along with other 40 towers and 5 fortresses . The " wall " meant protection to the precious salt pans that greatly contributed to Dubrovnik 's wealth , which are still being worked today . It is the second longest wall in Europe , surpassed only by the Hadrian 's Wall between Scotland and England . 
 = = = Falcon Fortress = = = 
 The Falcon Fortress ( Croatian : Soko Grad ) was one of the largest and most important fortresses on the territory of the Republic of Ragusa , due to its position in the mountainous region near the Bosnian inland . It was built at the location of earlier Illyrian and later Roman fortifications , evident from the remains of ceramics and Roman bricks in its walls . In 1391 , the <unk> brothers , at that time the rulers of Konavle , gave to the Republic of Rag full authority over the Falcon Fortress , while it came under republic 's final possession only in 1423 . 
 Due to its strategic importance , the Republic of Ragusa constantly invested in the maintenance of the fortress , which contained a cistern , a powder storage , wine and food cellars , sentry @-@ boxes , military barracks , and sanctuary buildings to accommodate refugees from nearby villages in the event of war . 
 = = = Imperial Fortress = = = 
 The Fortress is placed at the top of the mountain Srđ , just above the city of Dubrovnik . It was built in 1806 by Marshal Marmont , called the Imperial , in honor of emperor Napoleon . The fortress was strategically important to defend the northern side of the city .

 This fortress is placed at Ponta <unk> , at the very end of Prevlaka peninsula . It was built in the mid @-@ 19th century , between 1856 and 1862 , as part of the fortification system of the Bay of Kotor at the time of the Austrian Empire . By its monumentality and unique structure , it presents an exceptional example of military architecture of its time . Today , the fortress is out of use and badly damaged by various destructions during history .

 In 866 , a major Arab raid along Dalmatia struck Budva and Kotor , and then laid siege to Dubrovnik in 867 . The city appealed to Byzantine Emperor Basil the Macedonian , who responded by sending over one hundred ships . Finally , the 866 – 867 Saracens ' siege of Dubrovnik , which lasted fifteen months , was raised due to the intervention of Basil I , who sent a fleet under the command of Niketas Oryphas in relief of the city . After this successful intervention , the Byzantine navy sailed along the coast collecting promises of loyalty to the empire from the Dalmatian cities . The damage done by Saracens is not known , but the fact that Dubrovnik managed to survive a fifteen @-@ month @-@ long siege , proves how well the city was fortified .

According to chronicles from Dubrovnik , which are accepted by most historians , the siege ultimately failed . How much help Dubrovnik received from the Normans while repelling the siege is also not known exactly .

 In 1205 , the Republic of Venice invaded Dalmatia with the forces of the Fourth Crusade . Ragusa was forced to pay a tribute , eventually becoming a source of supplies for Venice , thus saving itself from being sacked like Zadar in the Siege of Zara , used as Venice 's naval base in the southern Adriatic Sea . In the 14th century , after liberation from Venetian supremacy , extensive work was done on the walls to ensure the republic 's liberty .

 In 1451 , the very powerful Bosnian regional lord Herzeg Stjepan Vukčić Kosača attacked Dubrovnik , and laid siege to the city .

A reward of 15 @,@ 000 ducats , a palace in Dubrovnik worth 2 @,@ 000 ducats , and an annual income of 300 ducats was offered to anyone who would kill him , along with the promise of hereditary Ragusan nobility which also helped hold this promise to whoever did the deed . Stjepan was so scared by the threat that he finally raised the siege .

 Austria declared war on France in August 1813 and by the Autumn the Royal Navy enjoyed unopposed domination over the Adriatic sea . Working in conjunction with the Austrian armies now invading the Illyrian Provinces and Northern Italy Rear Admiral Thomas Fremantle 's ships were able to rapidly transport British and Austrian troops from one point to another , forcing the surrender of the strategic ports one after another December . Captain William Hoste with his ship HMS Bacchante ( 38 guns ) along with HMS Saracen an 18 gun brig , arrived at Ragusa already blockaded by Pro Austrian Croat forces led by Todor Milutinović . The British with the Austrians were able to take the Imperial fortress and positions on Lokrum island . By hauling cannon up to Srđ hill they bombarded the city until the French General Joseph de Montrichard decided it was best to surrender . British and Croat troops entered the city via the Pile gates shutting the Ragusan rebels out .

 The Siege of Dubrovnik ( Croatian : Opsada Dubrovnika ) is a term marking the battle and siege of the city of Dubrovnik and the surrounding area in Croatia as part of the Croatian War of Independence . Dubrovnik was besieged and attacked by forces of the Serb @-@ dominated Yugoslav People 's Army ( JNA ) in late 1991 , with the major fighting ending in early 1992 , and the Croatian counterattack finally lifting the siege and liberating the area in mid @-@ 1992 . At the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) , the prosecution alleged that , " It was the objective of the Serb forces to detach this area from Croatia and to annex it to Montenegro . " 
 In 1991 , the American Institute of Architects condemned the bombardment of the city 's buildings . The Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments , in conjunction with UNESCO , found that , of the 824 buildings in the Old Town , 563 ( or 68 @.@ 33 percent ) had been hit by projectiles during the siege . Of these 563 , nine buildings had been completely destroyed by one of several major fires that occurred during the siege . In 1993 , the Institute for the Rehabilitation of Dubrovnik and UNESCO estimated the total cost for restoring public , private , and religious buildings , streets , squares , fountains , ramparts , gates , and bridges at $ 9 @,@ 657 @,@ 578 . By the end of 1999 , over $ 7 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 had been spent on restoration . It is a testament to the resilience of the ancient walls that more buildings in the old town were not destroyed during the bombardment ; the ancient walls in fact were more effective at resisting modern weaponry than contemporary structures in the city 's periphery .

 = Cubeb = 
 Cubeb ( Piper <unk> ) , or tailed pepper is a plant in genus Piper , cultivated for its fruit and essential oil . It is mostly grown in Java and Sumatra , hence sometimes called Java pepper . The fruits are gathered before they are ripe , and carefully dried . Commercial cubebs consist of the dried berries , similar in appearance to black pepper , but with stalks attached – the " tails " in " tailed pepper " . The dried pericarp is wrinkled , and its color ranges from grayish @-@ brown to black . The seed is hard , white and oily . The odor of cubebs is described as agreeable and aromatic and the taste as pungent , acrid , slightly bitter and persistent . It has been described as tasting like allspice , or like a cross between allspice and black pepper . 
 Cubeb came to Europe via India through the trade with the Arabs . The name cubeb comes from Arabic <unk> ( <unk> ) , which is of unknown origin , by way of Old French <unk> . Cubeb is mentioned in alchemical writings by its Arabic name . In his Theatrum Botanicum , John Parkinson tells that the king of Portugal prohibited the sale of cubeb to promote black pepper ( Piper nigrum ) around 1640 . It experienced a brief resurgence in 19th @-@ century Europe for medicinal uses , but has practically vanished from the European market since . It continues to be used as a flavoring agent for gins and cigarettes in the West , and as a seasoning for food in Indonesia . 
 = = History = = 
 In the fourth century BC , Theophrastus mentioned komakon , including it with cinnamon and cassia as an ingredient in aromatic confections . Guillaume <unk> and Claudius <unk> have identified komakon with cubeb , probably due to the resemblance which the word bears to the Javanese name of cubeb , <unk> . This is seen as a curious evidence of Greek trade with Java in a time earlier than that of Theophrastus . It is unlikely Greeks acquired them from somewhere else , since Javanese growers protected their monopoly of the trade by sterilizing the berries by scalding , ensuring that the vines were unable to be cultivated elsewhere . 
 In the Tang Dynasty , cubeb was brought to China from Srivijaya . In India , the spice came to be called <unk> <unk> , that is , " Chinese cubeb " , possibly because the Chinese had a hand in its trade , but more likely because it was an important item in the trade with China . In China this pepper was called both <unk> , and <unk> , the cognate Sanskrit word . Li <unk> thought it grew on the same tree as black pepper . Tang physicians administered it to restore appetite , cure " demon vapors " , darken the hair , and perfume the body . However , there is no evidence showing that cubeb was used as a condiment in China . 
 The Book of One Thousand and One Nights , compiled in the 9th century , mentions cubeb as a remedy for infertility , showing it was already used by Arabs for medicinal purposes . Cubeb was introduced to Arabic cuisine around the 10th century . The Travels of Marco Polo , written in late 13th century , describes Java as a producer of cubeb , along with other valuable spices . In the 14th century , cubeb was imported into Europe from the Grain Coast , under the name of pepper , by merchants of Rouen and Lippe . A 14th @-@ century morality tale exemplifying gluttony by the Franciscan writer Francesc <unk> describes the eating habits of a worldly cleric who consumes a bizarre concoction of egg yolks with cinnamon and cubeb after his baths , probably as an aphrodisiac . 
 Cubeb was thought by the people of Europe to be repulsive to demons , just as it was by the people of China . Ludovico Maria <unk> , a Catholic priest who wrote about methods of exorcism in the late 17th century , includes cubeb as an ingredient in an incense to ward off incubus . Even today , his formula for the incense is quoted by neopagan authors , some of whom also claim that cubeb can be used in love sachets and spells . 
 After the prohibition of sale , culinary use of cubeb decreased dramatically in Europe , and only its medicinal application continued to the 19th century . In the early 20th century , cubeb was regularly shipped from Indonesia to Europe and the United States . The trade gradually diminished to an average of 135 t ( 133 long tons ; 149 short tons ) annually , and practically ceased after 1940 .

 The dried cubeb berries contain essential oil consisting monoterpenes ( <unk> 50 % , α @-@ <unk> , and carene ) and sesquiterpenes ( caryophyllene , copaene , α- and β @-@ cubebene , δ @-@ cadinene , germacrene ) , the oxides <unk> and 1 @,@ 8 @-@ <unk> and the alcohol cubebol . 
 About 15 % of a volatile oil is obtained by distilling cubebs with water . <unk> , the liquid portion , has the formula <unk> . It is a pale green or blue @-@ yellow viscous liquid with a warm woody , slightly <unk> odor . After rectification with water , or on keeping , this deposits rhombic crystals of camphor of cubebs . 
 <unk> ( <unk> ) is a crystalline substance existing in cubebs , discovered by Eugène <unk> and Capitaine in 1839 . It may be prepared from cubebene , or from the pulp left after the distillation of the oil . The drug , along with gum , fatty oils , and <unk> of magnesium and calcium , contains also about 1 % of cubebic acid , and about 6 % of a resin . The dose of the fruit is 30 to 60 grains , and the British Pharmacopoeia contains a tincture with a dose of 4 to 1 dram .

 In India , the ancient texts of Ayurveda ( Sanskrit <unk> ् <unk> ) include cubeb in various remedies . Charaka and Sushruta prescribe a cubeb paste as a mouthwash , and the use of dried cubebs internally for oral and dental diseases , loss of voice , halitosis , fevers , and cough . Unani physicians use a paste of the cubeb berries externally on male and female genitals to intensify sexual pleasure during coitus . Due to this attributed property , cubeb was called " <unk> @-@ ul @-@ <unk> " . 
 In traditional Chinese medicine cubeb is used for its alleged warming property . In Tibetan medicine , cubeb ( ka ko la in Tibetan ) is one of bzang po drug , six fine herbs beneficial to specific organs in the body , with cubeb assigned to the spleen . 
 Arab physicians of the Middle Ages were usually versed in alchemy , and cubeb was used , under the name <unk> , when preparing the water of al <unk> . The Book of One Thousand and One Nights mentions cubeb as a main ingredient in making an aphrodisiac remedy for infertility : 
 The mixture , called " seed @-@ thickener " , is given to Shams @-@ al @-@ Din , a wealthy merchant who had no child , with the instruction that he must eat the paste two hours before having intercourse with his wife . According to the story , the merchant did get the child he desired after following these instructions . Other Arab authors wrote that cubeb rendered the breath fragrant , cured affections of the bladder , and that eating it " enhances the delight of coitus " . 
 In 1654 , Nicholas Culpeper wrote in the London <unk> that cubebs were " hot and dry in the third degree ... ( snip ) they cleanse the head of <unk> and strengthen the brain , they heat the stomach and provoke lust " . A later edition in 1826 informed the reader that " the Arabs call them Quabebe , and Quabebe Chine : they grow plentifully in Java , they stir up venery . ( snip ) ... and are very profitable for cold griefs of the womb " . 
 The modern use of cubeb in England as a drug dates from 1815 . There were various preparations , including oleum cubebae ( oil of cubeb ) , tinctures , fluid extracts , oleo @-@ resin compounds , and vapors , which were used for throat complaints . A small percentage of cubeb was commonly included in lozenges designed to alleviate bronchitis , in which the antiseptic and <unk> properties of the drug are useful . The most important therapeutic application of this drug , however , was in treating gonorrhea , where its antiseptic action was of much value . William Wyatt Squire wrote in 1908 that cubebs " act specifically on the <unk> @-@ urinary mucous membrane . ( They are ) given in all stages of gonorrhea " . As compared with <unk> in this connection cubeb has the advantages of being less disagreeable to take and somewhat less likely to disturb the digestive apparatus in prolonged administration . 
 The volatile oil , oleum cubebae , was the form in which cubeb is most commonly used as a drug , the dose being 5 to 20 minims , which may be suspended in mucilage or given after meals in a wafer . The drug exhibited the typical actions of a volatile oil , but exerted some of these to an exceptional degree . As such , it was liable to cause a cutaneous erythema in the course of its excretion by the skin , had a marked diuretic action , and was a fairly efficient disinfectant of the urinary passages . Its administration caused the appearance in the urine of a salt of cubebic acid which was precipitated by heat or nitric acid , and was therefore liable to be mistaken for albumin , when these two most common tests for the occurrence of albuminuria were applied . 
 The National Botanic Pharmacopoeia printed in 1921 tells that cubeb was " an excellent remedy for flour albus or whites . "

Cubeb can still be used to enhance the flavor of savory soups . 
 Cubeb reached Africa by way of the Arabs . In Moroccan cuisine , cubeb is used in savory dishes and in pastries like <unk> , little diamonds of semolina with honey and dates .

Occasionally , marijuana users claimed that smoking marijuana is no more harmful than smoking cubeb . In the musical The Music Man , set in rural Iowa in 1912 , the character Harold Hill alarms parents by telling this that their sons are trying out cubeb cigarettes at the notorious pool hall in the song " Trouble " . 
 In 2000 cubeb oil was included in the list of ingredients found in cigarettes , published by the Tobacco Prevention and Control Branch of North Carolina 's Department of Health and Human Services . 
 Bombay Sapphire gin is flavored with botanicals including cubeb and grains of paradise .

The episode 's title is a parody of the film Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills . The first script of the episode was too long and it had to be cut down . Dietter remembered that it " took on a more serious tone " because they had to keep the parts that were essential to the story and cut the many " throwaway gags " . Bill Oakley , the show runner of The Simpsons at the time , praised the episode for having a " terrific " story that " really comes together well " . Oakley said that he and his partner Josh Weinstein wanted to have more " emotionally " based episodes this season that still had humor in them . He thought Crittenden did a " good job " at that and he thought the episode " came out well " . 
 Marge 's dress was modeled on an actual Chanel dress , and also the type of dresses that former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis used to wear . The show 's creator , Matt Groening , was worried that such a detailed dress would look " weird " on a Simpsons character because they are " simply designed " and their clothing is " very generic " . He ended up liking the design , though , and Dietter thought it looked " good " on Marge . Oakley also liked the design and thought the cut on Marge was " flattering " . The country club women 's clothes were changed in every scene , something Dietter thought was hard to do because the animators had to come up with new designs . 
 Tom Kite guest starred in the episode as himself . He said that he " really enjoyed " recording his parts for it . " It was a lot of fun trying to imagine exactly what Homer 's golf swing is going to look like . My number one fear is that Homer will end up having a better golf swing than I do — heaven forbid ! " , he added .

 In its original American broadcast , " Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield " finished 64th in the ratings for the week of January 29 to February 4 , 1996 , with a Nielsen rating of 8 @.@ 8 . The episode was the fifth highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week , following The X @-@ Files , Beverly Hills , 90210 , My Cousin Vinny , and Married ... With Children . 
 Since airing , the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics . Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , summed it up as follows : " Marge looks great in her Chanel , the golf scenes between Homer and Mr. Burns are brilliant , and there are many true , touching moments as Marge struggles valiantly to improve herself . Yet again , it 's tempting for the viewer to urge Marge on and get the hell away from the family . " DVD Movie Guide 's Colin Jacobson said that he does not know if he " accepts " the episode as being " in character " for Marge . He said that it borrows liberally from The Flintstones , but he " likes it anyway " . Jacobson added that the episode " jabs the idle rich nicely " , and he enjoys the golf scenes with Homer . The program succeeds despite a few problems . " Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best part of the episode to be Mr. Burns 's demand for his tires to be <unk> at the gas station . The website concluded its review by giving the episode a grade of B. The authors of the book Homer Simpson Goes to Washington , Joseph Foy and Stanley Schultz , wrote that in the episode , " the tension of trying to demonstrate a family 's achievement of the American Dream is satirically and expertly played out by Marge Simpson " . 
 = Charles II of England = 
 Charles II ( 29 May 1630 – 6 February 1685 ) was monarch of the three kingdoms of England , Scotland , and Ireland . 
 Charles II 's father , Charles I , was executed at Whitehall on 30 January 1649 , at the climax of the English Civil War . Although the Parliament of Scotland proclaimed Charles II King on 5 February 1649 , England entered the period known as the English Interregnum or the English Commonwealth , and the country was a de facto republic , led by Oliver Cromwell . Cromwell defeated Charles II at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651 , and Charles fled to mainland Europe . Cromwell became virtual dictator of England , Scotland and Ireland , and Charles spent the next nine years in exile in France , the Dutch Republic , and the Spanish Netherlands . 
 A political crisis that followed the death of Cromwell in 1658 resulted in the restoration of the monarchy , and Charles was invited to return to Britain . On 29 May 1660 , his 30th birthday , he was received in London to public acclaim . After 1660 , all legal documents were dated as if he had succeeded his father as king in 1649 . 
 Charles 's English parliament enacted laws known as the Clarendon Code , designed to shore up the position of the re @-@ established Church of England . Charles acquiesced to the Clarendon Code even though he favoured a policy of religious tolerance . The major foreign policy issue of his early reign was the Second Anglo @-@ Dutch War . In 1670 , he entered into the secret treaty of Dover , an alliance with his first cousin King Louis XIV of France . Louis agreed to aid him in the Third Anglo @-@ Dutch War and pay him a pension , and Charles secretly promised to convert to Catholicism at an unspecified future date . Charles attempted to introduce religious freedom for Catholics and Protestant dissenters with his 1672 Royal Declaration of Indulgence , but the English Parliament forced him to withdraw it . In 1679 , Titus Oates 's revelations of a supposed " Popish Plot " sparked the Exclusion Crisis when it was revealed that Charles 's brother and heir ( James , Duke of York ) was a Catholic . The crisis saw the birth of the pro @-@ exclusion Whig and anti @-@ exclusion Tory parties . Charles sided with the Tories , and , following the discovery of the Rye House Plot to murder Charles and James in 1683 , some Whig leaders were executed or forced into exile . Charles dissolved the English Parliament in 1681 , and ruled alone until his death on 6 February 1685 . He was received into the Roman Catholic Church on his deathbed . 
 Charles was popularly known as the Merry Monarch , in reference to both the liveliness and hedonism of his court and the general relief at the return to normality after over a decade of rule by Oliver Cromwell and the Puritans . Charles 's wife , Catherine of Braganza , bore no live children , but Charles acknowledged at least twelve illegitimate children by various mistresses . He was succeeded by his brother James . 
 = = Early life , civil war , and exile = = 
 Charles was born in St James 's Palace on 29 May 1630 . His parents were Charles I ( who ruled the three kingdoms of England , Scotland and Ireland ) and Henrietta Maria ( the sister of the French king Louis XIII ) . Charles was their second son and child . Their first son was born about a year before Charles but died within a day . England , Scotland and Ireland were respectively predominantly Anglican , Presbyterian and Roman Catholic . Charles was baptised in the Chapel Royal on 27 June by the Anglican Bishop of London , William Laud , and brought up in the care of the Protestant Countess of Dorset , though his godparents included his maternal uncle and grandmother , Marie de ' Medici , both of whom were Catholics . At birth , Charles automatically became Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay , along with several other associated titles . At or around his eighth birthday , he was designated Prince of Wales , though he was never formally invested with the Honours of the Principality of Wales . 
 During the 1640s , when Charles was still young , his father fought Parliamentary and Puritan forces in the English Civil War . Charles accompanied his father during the Battle of Edgehill and , at the age of fourteen , participated in the campaigns of 1645 , when he was made titular commander of the English forces in the West Country . By Spring 1646 , his father was losing the war , and Charles left England due to fears for his safety , setting off from Falmouth after staying at Pendennis Castle , going first to the Isles of Scilly , then to Jersey , and finally to France , where his mother was already living in exile and his first cousin , eight @-@ year @-@ old Louis XIV , was king . 
 In 1648 , during the Second English Civil War , Charles moved to The Hague , where his sister Mary and his brother @-@ in @-@ law William II , Prince of Orange , seemed more likely to provide substantial aid to the royalist cause than the Queen 's French relations . However , the royalist fleet that came under Charles 's control was not used to any advantage , and did not reach Scotland in time to join up with the royalist Engagers army of the Duke of Hamilton , before it was defeated at the Battle of Preston by the Parliamentarians . 
 At The Hague , Charles had a brief affair with Lucy Walter , who later falsely claimed that they had secretly married . Her son , James Crofts ( afterwards Duke of Monmouth and Duke of Buccleuch ) , was one of Charles 's many illegitimate children who became prominent in British society . 
 Charles I surrendered in 1646 . He escaped and was recaptured in 1648 . Despite his son 's diplomatic efforts to save him , Charles I was beheaded in January 1649 , and England became a republic . On 5 February , the Covenanter Parliament of Scotland had proclaimed Charles II " King of Great Britain , France and Ireland " at the Mercat Cross , Edinburgh , but refused to allow him to enter Scotland unless he accepted Presbyterianism throughout Britain and Ireland . 
 When negotiations stalled , Charles authorised General Montrose to land in the Orkney Islands with a small army to threaten the Scots with invasion , in the hope of forcing an agreement more to his liking . Montrose feared that Charles would accept a compromise , and so chose to invade mainland Scotland anyway . He was captured and executed . Charles reluctantly promised that he would abide by the terms of a treaty agreed between him and the Scots Parliament at Breda , and support the Solemn League and Covenant , which authorised Presbyterian church governance across Britain . Upon his arrival in Scotland on 23 June 1650 , he formally agreed to the Covenant ; his abandonment of Episcopal church governance , although winning him support in Scotland , left him unpopular in England . Charles himself soon came to despise the " villainy " and " hypocrisy " of the Covenanters . 
 On 3 September 1650 , the Covenanters were defeated at the Battle of Dunbar by a much smaller force led by Oliver Cromwell . The Scots forces were divided into royalist Engagers and Presbyterian Covenanters , who even fought each other . Disillusioned by the Covenanters , in October Charles attempted to escape from them and rode north to join with an <unk> force , an event which became known as " the Start " , but within two days the Presbyterians had caught up with and recovered him . Nevertheless , the Scots remained Charles 's best hope of restoration , and he was crowned King of Scotland at Scone Abbey on 1 January 1651 . With Cromwell 's forces threatening Charles 's position in Scotland , it was decided to mount an attack on England . With many of the Scots ( including Lord Argyll and other leading Covenanters ) refusing to participate , and with few English royalists joining the force as it moved south into England , the invasion ended in defeat at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651 , after which Charles eluded capture by hiding in the Royal Oak at <unk> House . Through six weeks of narrow escapes Charles managed to flee England in disguise , landing in Normandy on 16 October , despite a reward of £ 1 @,@ 000 on his head , risk of death for anyone caught helping him and the difficulty in disguising Charles , who , at over 6 ft ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) , was unusually tall . 
 Cromwell was appointed Lord Protector of England , Scotland and Ireland , effectively placing the British Isles under military rule . Impoverished , Charles could not obtain sufficient support to mount a serious challenge to Cromwell 's government . Despite the Stuart family connections through Henrietta Maria and the Princess of Orange , France and the Dutch Republic allied themselves with Cromwell 's government from 1654 , forcing Charles to turn for aid to Spain , which at that time ruled the Southern Netherlands . Charles raised a ragtag army from his exiled subjects ; this small , underpaid , poorly equipped , and ill @-@ disciplined force formed the nucleus of the post @-@ Restoration army . 
 = = Restoration = = 
 After the death of Cromwell in 1658 , Charles 's chances of regaining the Crown at first seemed slim as Cromwell was succeeded as Lord Protector by his son , Richard . However , the new Lord Protector had no power base in either Parliament or the New Model Army . He was forced to abdicate in 1659 and the Protectorate was abolished . During the civil and military unrest which followed , George Monck , the Governor of Scotland , was concerned that the nation would descend into anarchy . Monck and his army marched into the City of London and forced the Rump Parliament to re @-@ admit members of the Long Parliament excluded in December 1648 during Pride 's Purge . The Long Parliament dissolved itself and for the first time in almost 20 years , there was a general election . The outgoing Parliament defined the electoral qualifications so as to ensure , as they thought , the return of a Presbyterian majority . 
 The restrictions against royalist candidates and voters were widely ignored , and the elections resulted in a House of Commons which was fairly evenly divided on political grounds between Royalists and Parliamentarians and on religious grounds between Anglicans and Presbyterians . The new so @-@ called Convention Parliament assembled on 25 April 1660 , and soon afterwards received news of the Declaration of Breda , in which Charles agreed , amongst other things , to pardon many of his father 's enemies . The English Parliament resolved to proclaim Charles king and invite him to return , a message that reached Charles at Breda on 8 May 1660 . In Ireland , a convention had been called earlier in the year , and on 14 May it declared for Charles as King . 
 He set out for England from Scheveningen , arrived in Dover on 25 May 1660 and reached London on 29 May , his 30th birthday . Although Charles and Parliament granted amnesty to Cromwell 's supporters in the Act of Indemnity and Oblivion , 50 people were specifically excluded . In the end nine of the regicides were executed : they were hanged , drawn and quartered ; others were given life imprisonment or simply excluded from office for life . The bodies of Oliver Cromwell , Henry Ireton , and John Bradshaw were subjected to the indignity of posthumous decapitations . 
 Charles agreed to the abolition of feudal dues ; in return , the English Parliament granted him an annual income to run the government of £ 1 @.@ 2 million , generated largely from customs and excise duties . The grant , however , proved to be insufficient for most of Charles 's reign . The sum was only an indication of the maximum the King was allowed to withdraw from the Treasury each year ; for the most part , the actual revenue was much lower , which led to mounting debts , and further attempts to raise money through poll taxes , land taxes and hearth taxes . 
 In the later half of 1660 , Charles 's joy at the Restoration was tempered by the deaths of his youngest brother , Henry , and sister , Mary , of smallpox . At around the same time , Anne Hyde , the daughter of the Lord Chancellor , Edward Hyde , revealed that she was pregnant by Charles 's brother , James , whom she had secretly married . Edward Hyde , who had not known of either the marriage or the pregnancy , was created Earl of Clarendon and his position as Charles 's favourite minister was strengthened . 
 = = = Clarendon Code = = = 
 The Convention Parliament was dissolved in December 1660 , and , shortly after the coronation , the second English Parliament of the reign assembled . Dubbed the Cavalier Parliament , it was overwhelmingly Royalist and Anglican . It sought to discourage non @-@ conformity to the Church of England , and passed several acts to secure Anglican dominance . The Corporation Act 1661 required municipal officeholders to swear allegiance ; the Act of Uniformity 1662 made the use of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer compulsory ; the Conventicle Act 1664 prohibited religious assemblies of more than five people , except under the auspices of the Church of England ; and the Five Mile Act 1665 prohibited expelled non @-@ conforming clergymen from coming within five miles ( 8 km ) of a parish from which they had been banished . The Conventicle and Five Mile Acts remained in effect for the remainder of Charles 's reign . The Acts became known as the " Clarendon Code " , after Lord Clarendon , even though he was not directly responsible for them and even spoke against the Five Mile Act . 
 The Restoration was accompanied by social change . Puritanism lost its momentum . Theatres reopened after having been closed during the protectorship of Oliver Cromwell , and bawdy " Restoration comedy " became a recognisable genre . Theatre licences granted by Charles required that female parts be played by " their natural performers " , rather than by boys as was often the practice before ; and Restoration literature celebrated or reacted to the restored court , which included libertines like John Wilmot , 2nd Earl of Rochester . Of Charles II , Wilmot supposedly said : 
 We have a pretty witty king , 
 Whose word no man relies on , 
 He never said a foolish thing , 
 And never did a wise one " 
 to which Charles supposedly <unk> , " That 's true , for my words are my own , but my actions are those of my ministers " . 
 = = = Great Plague and Great Fire = = = 
 In 1665 , Charles was faced with a great health crisis : the Great Plague of London . The death toll reached a peak of 7 @,@ 000 per week in the week of 17 September . Charles , with his family and court , fled London in July to Salisbury ; Parliament met in Oxford . All attempts by London public health officials to contain the disease failed , and the plague spread rapidly . 
 Adding to London 's woes , but marking the end of the plague , was what later became known as the Great Fire of London , which started on 2 September 1666 . The fire consumed about 13 @,@ 200 houses and 87 churches , including St Paul 's Cathedral . Charles and his brother James joined and directed the fire @-@ fighting effort . The public blamed Catholic conspirators for the fire , although it had actually started in a bakehouse in Pudding Lane . 
 = = Foreign and colonial policy = = 
 Since 1640 , Portugal had been fighting a war against Spain to restore its independence after a dynastic union of sixty years between the crowns of Spain and Portugal . Portugal had been helped by France , but in the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659 Portugal was abandoned by its French ally . Negotiations with Portugal for Charles 's marriage to Catherine of Braganza began during his father 's reign and upon the restoration , Queen Luísa of Portugal , acting as regent , reopened negotiations with England that resulted in an alliance . On 23 June 1661 , a marriage treaty was signed , Catherine 's dowry securing to England Tangier ( in North Africa ) and the Seven islands of Bombay ( the latter having a major influence on the development of the British Empire in India ) , together with trading privileges in Brazil and the East Indies , religious and commercial freedom in Portugal and two million Portuguese crowns ( about £ 300 @,@ 000 ) ; while Portugal obtained military and naval support against Spain and liberty of worship for Catherine . Catherine journeyed from Portugal to Portsmouth on 13 – 14 May 1662 , but was not visited by Charles there until 20 May . The next day the couple were married at Portsmouth in two ceremonies – a Catholic one conducted in secret , followed by a public Anglican service . 
 In an unpopular move , also in 1662 , Charles sold Dunkirk to his first cousin King Louis XIV of France for about £ 375 @,@ 000 . The channel port , although a valuable strategic outpost , was a drain on Charles 's limited finances . 
 Before Charles 's restoration , the Navigation Acts of 1650 had hurt Dutch trade by giving English vessels a monopoly , and had started the First Dutch War ( 1652 – 1654 ) . To lay foundations for a new beginning , envoys of the States General appeared in November 1660 with the Dutch Gift . The Second Dutch War ( 1665 – 1667 ) was started by English attempts to muscle in on Dutch possessions in Africa and North America . The conflict began well for the English , with the capture of New Amsterdam ( renamed New York in honour of Charles 's brother James , Duke of York ) and a victory at the Battle of Lowestoft , but in 1667 the Dutch launched a surprise attack on the English ( the Raid on the Medway ) when they sailed up the River Thames to where a major part of the English fleet was docked . Almost all of the ships were sunk except for the flagship , Royal Charles , which was taken back to the Netherlands as a trophy . The Second Dutch War ended with the signing of the Treaty of Breda . 
 As a result of the Second Dutch War , Charles dismissed Lord Clarendon , whom he used as a scapegoat for the war . Clarendon fled to France when impeached for high treason ( which carried the penalty of death ) . Power passed to five politicians known collectively by a whimsical acronym as the Cabal — Clifford , Arlington , Buckingham , Ashley ( afterwards Earl of Shaftesbury ) and Lauderdale . In fact , the Cabal rarely acted in concert , and the court was often divided between two factions led by Arlington and Buckingham , with Arlington the more successful . 
 In 1668 , England allied itself with Sweden , and with its former enemy the Netherlands , to oppose Louis XIV in the War of Devolution . Louis made peace with the Triple Alliance , but he continued to maintain his aggressive intentions towards the Netherlands . In 1670 , Charles , seeking to solve his financial troubles , agreed to the Treaty of Dover , under which Louis XIV would pay him £ 160 @,@ 000 each year . In exchange , Charles agreed to supply Louis with troops and to announce his conversion to Catholicism " as soon as the welfare of his kingdom will permit " . Louis was to provide him with 6 @,@ 000 troops to suppress those who opposed the conversion . Charles endeavoured to ensure that the Treaty — especially the conversion clause — remained secret . It remains unclear if Charles ever seriously intended to convert . 
 Meanwhile , by a series of five charters , Charles granted the East India Company the rights to autonomous government of its territorial acquisitions , to mint money , to command fortresses and troops , to form alliances , to make war and peace , and to exercise both civil and criminal jurisdiction over the its possessions in the Indies . Earlier in 1668 he leased the islands of Bombay for a nominal sum of £ 10 paid in gold . The Portuguese territories that Catherine brought with her as a dowry proved too expensive to maintain ; Tangier was abandoned in 1684 . In 1670 , Charles granted control of the entire Hudson Bay drainage basin to the Hudson 's Bay Company by royal charter , and named the territory Rupert 's Land , after his cousin Prince Rupert of the Rhine , the company 's first Governor . 
 = = Conflict with Parliament = = 
 Although previously favourable to the Crown , the Cavalier Parliament was alienated by the king 's wars and religious policies during the 1670s . In 1672 , Charles issued the Royal Declaration of Indulgence , in which he purported to suspend all penal laws against Catholics and other religious dissenters . In the same year , he openly supported Catholic France and started the Third Anglo @-@ Dutch War . 
 The Cavalier Parliament opposed the Declaration of Indulgence on constitutional grounds by claiming that the King had no right to arbitrarily suspend laws passed by Parliament . Charles withdrew the Declaration , and also agreed to the Test Act , which not only required public officials to receive the sacrament under the forms prescribed by the Church of England , but also later forced them to denounce certain teachings of the Catholic Church as " superstitious and idolatrous " . Clifford , who had converted to Catholicism , resigned rather than take the oath , and committed suicide shortly after . By 1674 England had gained nothing from the Anglo @-@ Dutch War , and the Cavalier Parliament refused to provide further funds , forcing Charles to make peace . The power of the Cabal waned and that of Clifford 's replacement , Lord Danby , grew . 
 Charles 's wife Queen Catherine was unable to produce an heir ; her four pregnancies had ended in miscarriages and stillbirths in 1662 , February 1666 , May 1668 and June 1669 . Charles 's heir presumptive was therefore his unpopular Catholic brother , James , Duke of York . Partly to assuage public fears that the royal family was too Catholic , Charles agreed that James 's daughter , Mary , should marry the Protestant William of Orange . In 1678 , Titus Oates , who had been alternately an Anglican and Jesuit priest , falsely warned of a " Popish Plot " to assassinate the King , even accusing the Queen of complicity . Charles did not believe the allegations , but ordered his chief minister Lord Danby to investigate . While Lord Danby seems to have been rightly sceptical about Oates 's claims , the Cavalier Parliament took them seriously . The people were seized with an anti @-@ Catholic hysteria ; judges and juries across the land condemned the supposed conspirators ; numerous innocent individuals were executed . 
 Later in 1678 , Lord Danby was impeached by the House of Commons on the charge of high treason . Although much of the nation had sought war with Catholic France , Charles had secretly negotiated with Louis XIV , trying to reach an agreement under which England would remain neutral in return for money . Lord Danby had publicly professed that he was hostile to France , but had reservedly agreed to abide by Charles 's wishes . Unfortunately for him , the House of Commons failed to view him as a reluctant participant in the scandal , instead believing that he was the author of the policy . To save Lord Danby from the impeachment trial , Charles dissolved the Cavalier Parliament in January 1679 . 
 The new English Parliament , which met in March of the same year , was quite hostile to Charles . Many members feared that he had intended to use the standing army to suppress dissent or impose Catholicism . However , with insufficient funds voted by Parliament , Charles was forced to gradually disband his troops . Having lost the support of Parliament , Lord Danby resigned his post of Lord High Treasurer , but received a pardon from the King . In defiance of the royal will , the House of Commons declared that the dissolution of Parliament did not interrupt impeachment proceedings , and that the pardon was therefore invalid . When the House of Lords attempted to impose the punishment of exile — which the Commons thought too mild — the impeachment became stalled between the two Houses . As he had been required to do so many times during his reign , Charles bowed to the wishes of his opponents , committing Lord Danby to the Tower of London . Lord Danby would be held there for another five years . 
 = = Later years = = 
 Charles faced a political storm over the succession to the Throne . The prospect of a Catholic monarch was vehemently opposed by Anthony Ashley Cooper , 1st Earl of Shaftesbury ( previously Baron Ashley and a member of the Cabal , which had fallen apart in 1673 ) . Shaftesbury 's power base was strengthened when the House of Commons of 1679 introduced the Exclusion Bill , which sought to exclude the Duke of York from the line of succession . Some even sought to confer the Crown to the Protestant Duke of Monmouth , the eldest of Charles 's illegitimate children . The Abhorrers — those who thought the Exclusion Bill was abhorrent — were named Tories ( after a term for dispossessed Irish Catholic bandits ) , while the Petitioners — those who supported a petitioning campaign in favour of the Exclusion Bill — were called Whigs ( after a term for rebellious Scottish Presbyterians ) . 
 Fearing that the Exclusion Bill would be passed , and bolstered by some acquittals in the continuing Plot trials , which seemed to him to indicate a more favourable public mood towards Catholicism , Charles dissolved the English Parliament , for a second time that year , in the summer of 1679 . Charles 's hopes for a more moderate Parliament were not fulfilled , within a few months he had dissolved Parliament yet again , after it sought to pass the Exclusion Bill . When a new Parliament assembled at Oxford in March 1681 , Charles dissolved it for a fourth time after just a few days . During the 1680s , however , popular support for the Exclusion Bill ebbed , and Charles experienced a nationwide surge of loyalty . Lord Shaftesbury was prosecuted ( albeit unsuccessfully ) for treason in 1681 and later fled to Holland , where he died . For the remainder of his reign , Charles ruled without Parliament . 
 Charles 's opposition to the Exclusion Bill angered some Protestants . Protestant conspirators formulated the Rye House Plot , a plan to murder the King and the Duke of York as they returned to London after horse races in Newmarket . A great fire , however , destroyed Charles 's lodgings at Newmarket , which forced him to leave the races early , thus , inadvertently , avoiding the planned attack . News of the failed plot was leaked . Protestant politicians such as Arthur Capell , 1st Earl of Essex , Algernon Sydney , Lord William Russell and the Duke of Monmouth were implicated in the plot . Lord Essex slit his own throat while imprisoned in the Tower of London ; Sydney and Russell were executed for high treason on very flimsy evidence ; and the Duke of Monmouth went into exile at the court of William of Orange . Lord Danby and the surviving Catholic lords held in the Tower were released and the King 's Catholic brother , James , acquired greater influence at court . Titus Oates was convicted and imprisoned for defamation . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 Charles suffered a sudden apoplectic fit on the morning of 2 February 1685 , and died aged 54 at 11 : 45 am four days later at Whitehall Palace . The suddenness of his illness and death led to suspicion of poison in the minds of many , including one of the royal doctors ; however , a more modern medical analysis has held that the symptoms of his final illness are similar to those of uraemia ( a clinical syndrome due to kidney dysfunction ) . In the days between his collapse and his death , Charles endured a variety of torturous treatments including bloodletting , purging and cupping in hopes of effecting a recovery . 
 On his deathbed Charles asked his brother , James , to look after his mistresses : " be well to Portsmouth , and let not poor Nelly starve " , and told his courtiers : " I am sorry , gentlemen , for being such a time a @-@ dying " . On the last evening of his life he was received into the Catholic Church , though the extent to which he was fully conscious or committed , and with whom the idea originated , is unclear . He was buried in Westminster Abbey " without any manner of pomp " on 14 February . 
 Charles was succeeded by his brother , who became James II of England and Ireland and James VII of Scotland . 
 = = Posterity and legacy = = 
 Charles had no legitimate children , but acknowledged a dozen by seven mistresses , including five by the notorious Barbara Villiers , Lady Castlemaine , for whom the Dukedom of Cleveland was created . His other mistresses included Moll Davis , Nell Gwyn , Elizabeth Killigrew , Catherine Pegge , Lucy Walter , and Louise de <unk> , Duchess of Portsmouth . As a result , in his lifetime he was often nicknamed " Old Rowley " , the name of one of his horses which was notable at the time as a stallion . 
 His subjects resented paying taxes that were spent on his mistresses and their children , many of whom received dukedoms or earldoms . The present Dukes of Buccleuch , Richmond , Grafton and St Albans descend from Charles in unbroken male line . Diana , Princess of Wales , was descended from two of Charles 's illegitimate sons : the Dukes of Grafton and Richmond . Diana 's son , Prince William , Duke of Cambridge , second in line to the British throne , is likely to be the first British monarch descended from Charles II . 
 Charles 's eldest son , the Duke of Monmouth , led a rebellion against James II , but was defeated at the Battle of Sedgemoor on 6 July 1685 , captured and executed . James was eventually dethroned in 1688 , in the course of the Glorious Revolution . He was the last Catholic monarch to rule Britain . 
 Looking back on Charles 's reign , Tories tended to view it as a time of benevolent monarchy whereas Whigs perceived it as a terrible despotism . Today it is possible to assess him without the taint of partisanship , and he is seen as more of a lovable rogue — in the words of his contemporary John Evelyn , " a prince of many virtues and many great imperfections , debonair , easy of access , not bloody or cruel " . John Wilmot , 2nd Earl of Rochester , wrote more <unk> of Charles : 
 Charles , a patron of the arts and sciences , founded the Royal Observatory and supported the Royal Society , a scientific group whose early members included Robert Hooke , Robert Boyle and Sir Isaac Newton . He was the personal patron of Sir Christopher Wren , the architect who helped rebuild London after the Great Fire and who constructed the Royal Hospital Chelsea , which Charles founded as a home for retired soldiers in 1682 . 
 The anniversary of the Restoration ( which was also Charles 's birthday ) — 29 May — was recognised in England until the mid @-@ nineteenth century as Oak Apple Day , after the Royal Oak in which Charles hid during his escape from the forces of Oliver Cromwell . Traditional celebrations involved the wearing of oak leaves but these have now died out . Charles II is commemorated by statues in London 's Soho Square , in Edinburgh 's Parliament Square , in Three Cocks Lane in Gloucester , and near the south portal of Lichfield Cathedral , and is depicted extensively in literature and other media . Charleston , South Carolina , and South Kingstown , Rhode Island , are named after him .

 = Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional Puertorriqueña = 
 The Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional ( English : Armed Forces of National Liberation , FALN ) was a Puerto Rican clandestine paramilitary organization that , through direct action , advocated complete independence for Puerto Rico . At the time of its dissolution , the FALN was responsible for more than 120 bomb attacks on United States targets between 1974 and 1983 . 
 The FALN was led by Filiberto Ojeda Ríos , who was one of the FBI 's most wanted criminals . The group served as the predecessor of the Boricua Popular Army . Several of the organization 's members were arrested and convicted for conspiracy to commit robbery and for firearms and explosives violations . On August 11 , 1999 then United States President Bill Clinton offered clemency to sixteen of the convicted militants under the condition that they renounce any kind of violent manifestation . This decision drew criticism towards the Clinton administration from figures that include the Office of the United States Attorney , the FBI , and the United States Congress . 
 = = Philosophy = = 
 The group was a 1970s Marxist – Leninist militant group which fought to transform Puerto Rico into a communist state . The organization 's ideological basis consisted of five reforms that they expected to implement , these were : 
 Directing the armed and political struggle in accordance with the Marxist @-@ Leninist principle of a broad front including a popular sectors willing to [ join ] the armed struggle right away 
 Agglutination of all forces based upon the principle of coordination between political work and military work under the leadership of a party composed of combatants assigned to different tasks 
 Application of the principle of internal ideological debate , a study of Marxist @-@ Leninist ideology and the use of criticism and self @-@ criticism 
 Implementation of the Stalinist ideological position on the concept of " nation " with regard to American reality 
 Application of the principle of the priority of the struggle for independence of Puerto Rico over any question of internal solidarity , demanding concrete support for our armed struggle as a priority matter in the international struggle against colonialism 
 = = History = = 
 The Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional was founded in the 1960s under the leadership of Filiberto Ojeda Rios . They were one of several organizations established during this decade that promoted " clandestine armed struggles " against the United States government that the movement described as the " colonial forces of the United States " . The group was founded following decades of alleged harassment , attacks , illegal imprisonments and assassination against members of the Puerto Rican independence movement . The group was part of a movement that included other clandestine organizations , including the Movimiento <unk> Revolucionario Armado , Organización de <unk> por la Revolución Puertorriqueña and Los <unk> <unk> de Liberación , and served as predecessor for what would become the Boricua Popular Army . The organization 's intention was to draw attention to what they described as the " colonial condition " of Puerto Rico through armed action against the United States government and military . 
 The modus operandi of the FALN was to perform bombing and incendiary actions and then admit responsibility through press releases . The first of these news releases announced the group 's intention ; in this document they admitted responsibility for attacks on several locations in New York to weaken the " Yanki capitalist monopoly " , and demanded the release of five political prisoners , these were : Lolita Lebrón , Oscar Collazo , Rafael Cancel Miranda , Andres Figueroa and Irvin Flores . In this communique the organization warns that they had opened two fronts , in Puerto Rico and the United States respectively , the goal of these were to organize a People 's Revolutionary Army which they expected would " rid Puerto Rico of Yanki colonialism " . Both fronts were supported and maintained by allies within Puerto Rico and North America . 
 The group openly expressed their opposition towards any government that was guided by any other system besides the Marxist – Leninist principles and rejected any kind of support or solidarity towards the Puerto Rican independence coming from the government of these countries . Of these countries they accused the governments of Mexico and Venezuela directly , expressing that the actions taken by these governments were hypocritical in origin , citing that while the Venezuelan government supported the independence of Puerto Rico they also supported the regime led by José <unk> Duarte in El Salvador . The group went further and claimed that the Venezuelan government was a " protector and enforcer of the Yankee imperialist plans to expand their grip in the Caribbean and Central America " and claimed that Venezuelan Army was receiving modern weapons in exchange . In their fifth communique the FALN expressed their dislike for several agencies of the United States government , they mentioned the Federal Bureau of Investigation , Central Intelligence Agency and the Department of Immigration . They claimed that the Department of Immigration was trying to blame the use of a failing economic system on the Chicano population , and that it was responsible for massive deportation and repressive action against Chicano and Mexican workers . In the communique the organization also expresses their confidence on the ability of the group 's mobile guerrilla units to attack any location within the continental United States . Regardless of their activism against the American government the FALN extended friendship and solidarity towards the United States working class , whom they described as " allies in the struggle against Yanki fascism " . They said that the reason for this was that the American working class was being pushed out of work forced to unemployment while the nation 's corporations were gaining billions of dollars in profits . The FALN used some of their communiques to advertise other causes that they felt were fair , including support towards the government of Panama when this country wanted the control of the Panama Canal .

 On August 11 , 1999 , President Bill Clinton offered conditional clemency to sixteen members of the FALN convicted for conspiracy to commit robbery , conspiracy to bomb @-@ making , and sedition , as well as for firearms and explosives violations . None of the sixteen were convicted of bombings or any crime which injured another person , and all of the sixteen had served nineteen years or longer in prison , which was a longer sentence than such crimes typically received , according to the White House . Clinton offered clemency , on condition that the prisoners renounce violence , at the appeal of 10 Nobel Peace Prize laureates , President Jimmy Carter , the Archbishop of New York , and the Archbishop of Puerto Rico . The commutation was opposed by U.S. Attorney 's Office , the FBI , and the Federal Bureau of Prisons and criticised by many including former victims of FALN terrorist activities , the Fraternal Order of Police , and members of Congress . Hillary Clinton in her campaign for Senator also criticised the commutation , although she had earlier been supportive . 
 The former New York City police officer Richard Pascarella , who was blinded and lost five fingers on his right hand in an FALN bombing , also publicly opposed clemency to FALN members , claiming : " They will again voice their ideology on the American public with a bomb and with a gun . "

 = Decompression ( diving ) = 
 The decompression of a diver is the reduction in ambient pressure experienced during ascent from depth . It is also the process of elimination of dissolved inert gases from the diver 's body , which occurs during the ascent , during pauses in the ascent known as decompression stops , and after surfacing until the gas concentrations reach equilibrium . Divers breathing gas at ambient pressure need to ascend at a rate determined by their exposure to pressure and the breathing gas in use . A diver who only breathes gas at atmospheric pressure when free @-@ diving or snorkelling will not usually need to decompress , Divers using an atmospheric diving suit do not need to decompress as they are never exposed to high ambient pressure . 
 When a diver descends in the water the hydrostatic pressure , and therefore the ambient pressure , rises . Because breathing gas is supplied at ambient pressure , some of this gas dissolves into the diver 's blood and is transferred by the blood to other tissues . Inert gas such as nitrogen or helium continues to be taken up until the gas dissolved in the diver is in a state of equilibrium with the breathing gas in the diver 's lungs , at which point the diver is saturated for that depth and breathing mixture , or the depth , and therefore the pressure , is changed . During ascent , the ambient pressure is reduced , and at some stage the inert gases dissolved in any given tissue will be at a higher concentration than the equilibrium state and start to diffuse out again . If the pressure reduction is sufficient , excess gas may form bubbles , which may lead to decompression sickness , a possibly debilitating or life @-@ threatening condition . It is essential that divers manage their decompression to avoid excessive bubble formation and decompression sickness . A mismanaged decompression usually results from reducing the ambient pressure too quickly for the amount of gas in solution to be eliminated safely . These bubbles may block arterial blood supply to tissues or directly cause tissue damage . If the decompression is effective , the asymptomatic venous microbubbles present after most dives are eliminated from the diver 's body in the alveolar capillary beds of the lungs . If they are not given enough time , or more bubbles are created than can be eliminated safely , the bubbles grow in size and number causing the symptoms and injuries of decompression sickness . The immediate goal of controlled decompression is to avoid development of symptoms of bubble formation in the tissues of the diver , and the long @-@ term goal is to avoid complications due to sub @-@ clinical decompression injury . 
 The mechanisms of bubble formation and the damage bubbles cause has been the subject of medical research for a considerable time and several hypotheses have been advanced and tested . Tables and algorithms for predicting the outcome of decompression schedules for specified hyperbaric exposures have been proposed , tested and used , and in many cases , superseded . Although constantly refined and generally considered acceptably reliable , the actual outcome for any individual diver remains slightly unpredictable . Although decompression retains some risk , this is now generally considered acceptable for dives within the well tested range of normal recreational and professional diving . Nevertheless , all currently popular decompression procedures advise a ' safety stop ' additional to any stops required by the algorithm , usually of about three to five minutes at 3 to 6 metres ( 10 to 20 ft ) , even on an otherwise continuous no @-@ stop ascent . 
 Decompression may be continuous or staged . A staged decompression is interrupted by decompression stops at calculated depth intervals , but the entire ascent is actually part of the decompression and the ascent rate is critical to harmless elimination of inert gas . A no @-@ decompression dive , or more accurately , a dive with no @-@ stop decompression , relies on limiting the ascent rate for avoidance of excessive bubble formation . The elapsed time at surface pressure immediately after a dive is also an important part of decompression and can be thought of as the last decompression stop of a dive . It can take up to 24 hours for the body to return to its normal atmospheric levels of inert gas saturation after a dive . When time is spent on the surface between dives this is known as the " surface interval " and is considered when calculating decompression requirements for the subsequent dive . 
 = = Decompression theory = = 
 Decompression theory is the study and modelling of the transfer of the inert gas component of breathing gases from the gas in the lungs to the tissues of the diver and back during exposure to variations in ambient pressure . In the case of underwater diving and compressed air work , this mostly involves ambient pressures greater than the local surface pressure — but astronauts , high altitude mountaineers , and occupants of unpressurized aircraft , are exposed to ambient pressures less than standard sea level atmospheric pressure . In all cases , the symptoms of decompression sickness occur during or within a relatively short period of hours , or occasionally days , after a significant reduction of ambient pressure . 
 = = = Physics and physiology of decompression = = = 
 The absorption of gases in liquids depends on the solubility of the specific gas in the specific liquid , the concentration of gas , customarily expressed as partial pressure , and temperature . The main variable in the study of decompression theory is pressure . 
 Once dissolved , distribution of the dissolved gas may be by diffusion , where there is no bulk flow of the solvent , or by perfusion where the solvent ( in this case blood ) is circulated around the diver 's body , where gas can diffuse to local regions of lower concentration . Given sufficient time at a specific partial pressure in the breathing gas , the concentration in the tissues stabilizes , or saturates , at a rate that depends on solubility , diffusion rate and perfusion , all of which vary in the different tissues of the body . This process is referred to as in @-@ gassing , and is usually modeled as an inverse exponential process . 
 If the concentration of the inert gas in the breathing gas is reduced below that of any of the tissues , there is a tendency for gas to return from the tissues to the breathing gas . This is known as out @-@ gassing , and occurs during decompression , when the reduction in ambient pressure reduces the partial pressure of the inert gas in the lungs . This process may be complicated by the formation of gas bubbles , and the modeling is more complex and varied . 
 The combined concentrations of gases in any given tissue depend on the history of pressure and gas composition . Under equilibrium conditions , the total concentration of dissolved gases is less than the ambient pressure — as oxygen is metabolized in the tissues , and the carbon dioxide produced is much more soluble . However , during a reduction in ambient pressure , the rate of pressure reduction may exceed the rate at which gas is eliminated by diffusion and perfusion . If the concentration gets too high , it may reach a stage where bubble formation can occur in the supersaturated tissues . When the pressure of gases in a bubble exceed the combined external pressures of ambient pressure and the surface tension of the bubble @-@ liquid interface , the bubbles grow , and this growth can damage tissue . 
 If the dissolved inert gases come out of solution within the tissues of the body and form bubbles , they may cause the condition known as decompression sickness , or DCS , also known as divers ' disease , the bends or caisson disease . However , not all bubbles result in symptoms , and doppler bubble detection shows that venous bubbles are present in a significant number of asymptomatic divers after relatively mild hyperbaric exposures . 
 Since bubbles can form in or migrate to any part of the body , DCS can produce many symptoms , and its effects may vary from joint pain and rashes to paralysis and death . Individual susceptibility can vary from day to day , and different individuals under the same conditions may be affected differently or not at all . The classification of types of DCS by its symptoms has evolved since its original description . 
 The risk of decompression sickness after diving can be managed through effective decompression procedures and contracting it is now uncommon , though it remains to some degree unpredictable . Its potential severity has driven much research to prevent it and divers almost universally use decompression tables or dive computers to limit or monitor their exposure and to control their ascent speed and decompression procedures . If DCS is contracted , it is usually treated by hyperbaric oxygen therapy in a recompression chamber . If treated early , there is a significantly higher chance of successful recovery . 
 A diver who only breathes gas at atmospheric pressure when free @-@ diving or snorkelling will not usually need to decompress but it is possible to get decompression sickness , or <unk> , from repetitive deep free @-@ diving with short surface intervals . 
 = = = Decompression models = = = 
 Actual rates of diffusion and perfusion , and solubility of gases in specific physiological tissues are not generally known , and vary considerably . However mathematical models have been proposed that approximate the real situation to a greater or lesser extent . These models predict whether symptomatic bubble formation is likely to occur for a given dive profile . Algorithms based on these models produce decompression tables . In personal dive computers , they produce a real @-@ time estimate of decompression status and display it for the diver . 
 Two different concepts have been used for decompression modelling . The first assumes that dissolved gas is eliminated while in the dissolved phase , and that bubbles are not formed during asymptomatic decompression . The second , which is supported by experimental observation , assumes that bubbles are formed during most asymptomatic decompressions , and that gas elimination must consider both dissolved and bubble phases . 
 Early decompression models tended to use the dissolved phase models , and adjusted them by factors derived from experimental observations to reduce the risk of symptomatic bubble formation . 
 There are two main groups of dissolved phase models : 
 In parallel compartment models , several compartments with varying rates of gas absorption ( half time ) , are considered to exist independently of each other , and the limiting condition is controlled by the compartment that shows the worst case for a specific exposure profile . These compartments represent conceptual tissues and don 't represent specific organic tissues . They merely represent the range of possibilities for the organic tissues . The second group uses serial compartments , which assumes that gas diffuses through one compartment before it reaches the next . 
 More recent models attempt to model bubble dynamics , also usually by simplified models , to facilitate the computation of tables , and later to allow real time predictions during a dive . Models that approximate bubble dynamics are varied . They range from those that are not much more complex than the dissolved phase models , to those that require considerably greater computational power . 
 = = Decompression practice = = 
 The practice of decompression by divers comprises the planning and monitoring of the profile indicated by the algorithms or tables of the chosen decompression model , the equipment available and appropriate to the circumstances of the dive , and the procedures authorized for the equipment and profile to be used . There is a large range of options in all of these aspects . In many cases decompression practice takes place in a framework or " decompression system " which imposes extra constraints on diver behaviour . Such constraints may include : limiting the ascent rate ; making stops during the ascent additional to any decompression stops ; limiting the number of dives performed in a day ; limiting the number of days of diving within a week ; avoiding dive profiles that have large numbers of ascents and descents ; avoiding heavy work immediately after a dive ; not diving prior to flying or ascending to altitude ; and organizational requirements . 
 = = = Procedures = = = 
 Decompression may be continuous or staged , where the ascent is interrupted by stops at regular depth intervals , but the entire ascent is part of the decompression , and ascent rate can be critical to harmless elimination of inert gas . What is commonly known as no @-@ decompression diving , or more accurately no @-@ stop decompression , relies on limiting ascent rate for avoidance of excessive bubble formation . 
 The procedures used for decompression depend on the mode of diving , the available equipment , the site and environment and the actual dive profile . Standardized procedures have been developed that provide an acceptable level of risk in appropriate circumstances . Different sets of procedures are used by commercial , military , scientific and recreational divers , though there is considerable overlap where similar equipment is used , and some concepts are common to all decompression procedures . 
 Normal diving decompression procedures range from continuous ascent for no @-@ stop dives , where the necessary decompression occurs during the ascent , which is kept to a controlled rate for this purpose , through staged decompression in open water or in a bell , to decompression from saturation , which generally occurs in a decompression chamber that is part of a saturation system . Decompression may be accelerated by the use of breathing gases that provide an increased concentration differential of the inert gas components of the breathing mixture by maximizing the acceptable oxygen content . 
 Therapeutic recompression is a medical procedure for treatment of decompression sickness , and is followed by decompression , usually to a relatively conservative schedule .

 The symptoms of decompression sickness are caused by damage from the formation and growth of bubbles of inert gas within the tissues and by blockage of arterial blood supply to tissues by gas bubbles and other emboli consequential to bubble formation and tissue damage . 
 The precise mechanisms of bubble formation and the damage they cause has been the subject of medical research for a considerable time and several hypotheses have been advanced and tested . Tables and algorithms for predicting the outcome of decompression schedules for specified hyperbaric exposures have been proposed , tested , and used , and usually found to be of some use but not entirely reliable . Decompression remains a procedure with some risk , but this has been reduced and is generally considered acceptable for dives within the well @-@ tested range of commercial , military and recreational diving . 
 = = = Early developments = = = 
 The first recorded experimental work related to decompression was conducted by Robert Boyle , who subjected experimental animals to reduced ambient pressure by use of a primitive vacuum pump . In the earliest experiments the subjects died from asphyxiation , but in later experiments signs of what was later to become known as decompression sickness were observed . 
 Later , when technological advances allowed the use of pressurization of mines and caissons to exclude water ingress , miners were observed to present symptoms of what would become known as caisson disease , compressed air illness , the bends , and decompression sickness . 
 Once it was recognized that the symptoms were caused by gas bubbles , and that re @-@ compression could relieve the symptoms , Paul Bert showed in 1878 that decompression sickness is caused by nitrogen bubbles released from tissues and blood during or after decompression , and showed the advantages of breathing oxygen after developing decompression sickness . 
 Further work showed that it was possible to avoid symptoms by slow decompression , and subsequently various theoretical models have been derived to predict safe decompression profiles and treatment of decompression sickness .

 In 1908 John Scott Haldane prepared the first recognized decompression table for the British Admiralty , based on extensive experiments on goats using an end point of symptomatic DCS . 
 George D. Stillson of the United States Navy tested and refined Haldane 's tables in 1912 , and this research led to the first publication of the United States Navy Diving Manual and the establishment of a Navy Diving School in Newport , Rhode Island . At about the same time Leonard Erskine Hill was working on a system of continuous uniform decompression 
 The Naval School , Diving and Salvage was re @-@ established at the Washington Navy Yard in 1927 , and the Navy Experimental Diving Unit ( NEDU ) was moved to the same venue . In the following years , the Experimental Diving Unit developed the US Navy Air Decompression Tables , which became the accepted world standard for diving with compressed air . 
 During the 1930s , Hawkins , Schilling and Hansen conducted extensive experimental dives to determine allowable supersaturation ratios for different tissue compartments for Haldanean model , Albert R. Behnke and others experimented with oxygen for re @-@ compression therapy , and the US Navy 1937 tables were published . 
 In 1941 , Altitude decompression sickness was first treated with hyperbaric <unk> and the revised US Navy Decompression Tables were published in 1956 .

 In 1965 LeMessurier and Hills published A thermodynamic approach arising from a study on Torres Strait diving techniques , which suggests that decompression by conventional models forms bubbles that are then eliminated by re @-@ dissolving at the decompression stops — which is slower than elimination while still in solution . This indicates the importance of minimizing bubble phase for efficient gas elimination , Groupe d 'Etudes et Recherches Sous @-@ marines published the French Navy <unk> decompression tables , and Goodman and Workman introduced re @-@ compression tables using oxygen to accelerate elimination of inert gas . 
 The Royal Navy Physiological Laboratory published tables based on Hempleman 's tissue slab diffusion model in 1972 , isobaric counterdiffusion in subjects who breathed one inert gas mixture while being surrounded by another was first described by Graves , <unk> , Lambertsen , and Quinn in 1973 , and the French government published the MT74 Tables du Ministère du Travail in 1974 . 
 From 1976 , decompression sickness testing sensitivity was improved by ultrasonic methods that can detect mobile venous bubbles before symptoms of DCS become apparent .

 Paul K Weathersby , Louis D Homer and Edward T Flynn introduced survival analysis into the study of decompression sickness in 1982 . 
 Albert A. Bühlmann published Decompression – Decompression sickness in 1984 . Bühlmann recognized the problems associated with altitude diving , and proposed a method that calculated maximum nitrogen loading in the tissues at a particular ambient pressure by modifying Haldane 's allowable supersaturation ratios to increase linearly with depth . In 1984 DCIEM ( Defence and Civil Institution of Environmental Medicine , Canada ) released No @-@ Decompression and Decompression Tables based on the Kidd / Stubbs serial compartment model and extensive ultrasonic testing , and Edward D. Thalmann published the USN E @-@ L algorithm and tables for constant PO2 Nitrox closed circuit rebreather applications , and extended use of the E @-@ L model for constant PO2 Heliox CCR in 1985 . The E @-@ L model may be interpreted as a bubble model . The 1986 Swiss Sport Diving Tables were based on the Haldanean Bühlmann model , as were the 1987 SAA Bühlmann tables in the UK .

 D. E. Yount and D. C. Hoffman proposed a bubble model in 1986 , and the BSAC ' 88 tables were based on Hennessy 's bubble model . 
 The 1990 DCIEM sport diving tables were based on fitting experimental data , rather than a physiological model , and the 1990 French Navy Marine Nationale 90 ( MN90 ) decompression tables were a development of the earlier Haldanean model of the <unk> tables . 
 In 1991 D.E. Yount described a development of his earlier bubble model , the Varied Permeability Model , and the 1992 French civilian Tables du Ministère du Travail ( MT92 ) also have a bubble model interpretation . 
 NAUI published Trimix and Nitrox tables based on the Wienke reduced gradient bubble model ( RGBM ) model in 1999 , followed by recreational air tables based on the RGBM model in 2001 . 
 In 2007 , Wayne Gerth and David Doolette published VVal 18 and VVal 18M parameter sets for tables and programs based on the Thalmann E @-@ L algorithm , and produce an internally compatible set of decompression tables for open circuit and CCR on air and Nitrox , including in water air / oxygen decompression and surface decompression on oxygen . In 2008 , the US Navy Diving Manual Revision 6 included a version of the 2007 tables developed by Gerth and Doolette .

 Sir Thomas Angus Lyall Paton CMG FRS <unk> <unk> <unk> ( 10 May 1905 – 7 April 1999 ) was a British civil engineer from Jersey . Paton was born into a family that had founded the civil engineering firms of Easton , Gibb & Son and Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners and he would spend his entire professional career working for the latter . Following his graduation from University College London one of his first jobs was the construction of a dam in Maentwrog in Wales . Paton later became an expert on dams and much of his career was devoted to their construction . In 1931 he undertook an economic survey of Canada which recommended a programme of works for its port system . This report was still being used into the 1970s . During the Second World War Paton was involved with the construction of gun emplacements in the Dardanelles , Turkey and of caissons for the Mulberry Harbours used after the Invasion of Normandy . 
 After the Second World War , Paton undertook an economic survey of Syria , which made recommendations for port , water infrastructure , irrigation and hydroelectric improvements . This was followed by a similar report on Lebanon and one on the possibility of extending railways from Northern Rhodesia to neighbouring countries . From 1946 , Paton worked almost exclusively on hydroelectric projects , beginning with the Owen Falls Hydroelectric Scheme in Uganda . He also worked on the Kariba Dam in Zambia and Zimbabwe , which was the largest dam in the world when built and for which he was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George . He was also involved with the Indus Basin Project , the Aswan High Dam , the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam , the P.K. Le Roux Dam , the Spioenkop Dam and the Tarbela Dam . Paton was knighted in 1973 and retired in 1977 , remaining a senior consultant to Gibb and Partners . He spent his retirement in Jersey , where he died at St Helier on 7 April 1999 . Paton was dedicated to his professional career and served as President of both the Institution of Civil Engineers ( November 1970 - November 1971 ) and the <unk> Society of Civil Engineers .

 Angus , the name he preferred , was born on the island of Jersey in the Channel Islands on the 10 May 1905 . His father , Thomas Lyall Paton , was a journalist and author . His mother , Janet , was the daughter of Easton Gibb , founder of Easton , Gibb & Son , a firm of civil engineering contractors . His uncle on his mother 's side , Alexander Gibb , was also a civil engineer ; and had founded Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners , where Paton would spend his professional career . Paton left Jersey with his family in 1909 and spent a year in England before being sent to school in Boulogne @-@ sur @-@ Mer in France then Lausanne in Switzerland . He returned to England at the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 . He spent the next six years living in St Leonards @-@ on @-@ Sea in Sussex where he lived next door to his future wife , Joan <unk> @-@ Murray . 
 Paton spent four years at Brunswick preparatory school in Haywards Heath , Sussex before studying at Cheltenham College . He was a good student , which he put down to an excellent maths teacher , a good memory and being " not much good at games " . On Alexander Gibb 's advice Paton read for a degree in civil engineering at University College London ( UCL ) , where he had won a scholarship at the age of 17 . Whilst at UCL Paton earned half @-@ colours for long distance running and became the only student to graduate with a first class honours Bachelor of Science degree in engineering in 1925 .

In 1927 he worked on a dam at Maentwrog in North Wales and between 1932 and 1933 was resident engineer on the <unk> portion of the Galloway hydro @-@ electric power scheme . Paton was seconded to the Rangoon Port Trust in 1930 to construct a wharf for the export of Lead from Burma . This wharf survived a serious earthquake on 5 May 1930 and was opened on 20 February 1931 . On 10 April 1931 Paton sailed to Canada to undertake a survey of its ports and outline the additional facilities that would be required in the next 25 – 50 years . He was assisted in this for six weeks by Ralph Freeman who had designed the Sydney Harbour Bridge . The report was issued on 15 January 1932 but was not implemented until 1935 with the election of William Lyon Mackenzie King as Prime Minister of Canada . The report 's findings continued to be in use until the 1970s . Paton was responsible for the construction of a new brewery for Guinness in Park Royal , London from October 1933 to October 1936 . This was the biggest job of his career thus far and involved the construction of seven steel framed buildings , a power station , a storage silo , roads and railway sidings . Paton also built industrial and trading estates in Wales , West Cumberland and London . He was made a partner in the firm in 1938 .

 During the Second World War the running of Gibb and Partners fell largely to Paton and James Guthrie Brown . Gibb and Partners gained a large number of government contracts and within a few weeks of the start of the war in September 1939 the workforce increased by 2000 . Paton designed and sited several Royal Ordnance Factories ; and in March 1940 travelled to Turkey to construct an iron and steel works there . Whilst in Turkey he was contracted to build emplacements to contain guns from mothballed battleships in the Dardanelles . The construction of the emplacements was completed but the guns would later be prevented from reaching the site by the Axis occupation of Greece . Paton made his way back to Britain via Greece , Italy and France and arrived home two days prior to the Italian declaration of war against the Allies on 10 June 1940 . He also constructed a plant at Barry in South Wales for the extraction of Magnesium <unk> from the sea , a turbine factory for British Thomson @-@ Houston Company and a £ 7 million underground aircraft engine factory . From 1943 @-@ 44 Paton supervised the construction , in London Docks , of the precast concrete caissons required for the construction of Mulberry Harbours following the Normandy Landings . From 1944 @-@ 45 he was in charge of the rebuilding of houses damaged by V @-@ 2 rockets in the London districts of Wanstead and Woodford .

 In 1945 Paton began construction of a wool factory at Darlington and a Rayon factory at Carrickfergus , both jobs were completed in 1951 . In 1946 Paton was put in charge of an economic survey of Syria which required him to traverse the country by aircraft and car . The report , issued in 1947 , recommended port , water infrastructure and irrigation improvements and the construction of a hydroelectric power station on the Euphrates River . Paton undertook a similar survey in Lebanon from 1947 to 1948 . He was also involved in a report on the possibility of running a railroad from Northern Rhodesia to Dar es Salaam , Mtwara and Nyasaland . 
 Paton worked extensively in the field of hydroelectric power and became regarded as a world authority on the matter . From 1946 to 1955 he worked on the Owen Falls Hydroelectric Scheme in Uganda which resulted in the complete stoppage of the White Nile for the first time in history . Following the completion of Owen Falls Dam , Paton worked on the first stage of the Kariba Dam on the Zambezi River , of which he said that it was the " highlight of [ his ] professional career " . Paton made 22 visits to the site , of a total duration of 267 days . The project itself was , at 420 ft high , the largest dam built until then and , despite some of the worst floods on record hitting the project , was completed in 1960 at £ 5 million under budget . In recognition of his work on the Kariba project Paton was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George on 1 January 1960 . As a result of the success of the Kariba project Gibb and Partners became involved with many of the biggest dam projects of the next two decades including works in Sudan , Argentina , South Africa and Pakistan . 
 Paton was later involved in the second stage of the Kariba Project and in the Aswan High Dam project . In 1955 he became a senior partner in Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners upon the death of Alistair Gibb in a polo accident . From 1960 until 1977 , when he retired , Paton was the responsible partner for the firm 's involvement in the supervision of the $ 1 @.@ 2 billion World Bank Indus Basin Project . This included the construction of the <unk> Dam between 1962 and 1968 . 
 In 1962 Gibb & Partners was one of two firms chosen ( with Coyne et <unk> ) by the South African government to build two dams on the Orange River . The first to be constructed was the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam which was officially opened in March 1972 . The second , the P.K. Le Roux Dam , was finished in 1977 . Following the success of this project Paton was retained to build a third , smaller dam , the Spioenkop Dam , which was finished in 1972 . Paton was also involved with the tunnelling and underground powerhouse for the Drakensberg Pumped Storage Scheme . Paton was retained by the World Bank once more in 1967 to supervise the construction of the Tarbela Dam in Pakistan , which was completed in 1976 . He also worked on the modernisation of the Royal Mint which involved the move from its 600 @-@ year home at Tower Hill to Llantrisant in Wales in time for decimalisation in 1971 . 
 = = Retirement = = 
 Paton retired from the firm in 1977 but worked for them again as a senior consultant between 1979 and 1985 . During this time he worked on the James Bay Project , a large hydroelectric and infrastructure development in Quebec , Canada . Paton spent the last twenty years of his life in retirement in Jersey in the Channel Islands . In his working life he had visited 48 countries and spent <unk> days abroad . During his career with Gibb and Partners he had grown the company from a 400 employee , home @-@ based company to one which employed more than 1500 engineers working in 63 countries . He was also largely responsible for leading the trend of exporting British technical expertise around the world . 
 Paton made an endowment to the Royal Academy of Engineering in 1986 , as a result the Academy awards the Sir Angus Paton Bursary of £ 7000 annually to a masters student . Paton married on 7 June 1933 to Joan with whom he raised two daughters and two sons . Joan died on 7 January 1964 , an event which spurred him to become more involved in his profession . Paton died at St Helier in Jersey on 7 April 1999 .

 = Patrick Star = 
 Patrick Star is a fictional character in the American animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants . He is voiced by actor Bill Fagerbakke , who also voices numerous other characters on the show . Created and designed by marine biologist and cartoonist Stephen Hillenburg , the series creator , Patrick first appeared on television in the show 's pilot episode " Help Wanted " on May 1 , 1999 . 
 Depicted as an overweight , dimwitted pink starfish , Patrick lives under a rock in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom next door to Squidward Tentacles ' moai . His most significant character trait is his lack of common sense , which sometimes leads him and his best friend , main character SpongeBob SquarePants , into trouble . Patrick is unemployed and a self @-@ proclaimed expert in the " art of doing nothing " . 
 The character has received positive reactions from critics and fans alike ; however , he has been involved in a public controversy that centered on speculation over his relationship with SpongeBob . Patrick has been included in various SpongeBob SquarePants @-@ related merchandise , including trading cards , video games , plush toys , and comic books . He appears in the 2004 full @-@ length feature film The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie and in its 2015 sequel . 
 = = Role in SpongeBob SquarePants = = 
 Patrick is the ignorant but humorous best friend of main character SpongeBob SquarePants . He is portrayed as being an overweight , dimwitted , pink starfish residing in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom . Patrick has been shown to make many ludicrous mistakes ; despite this , he has occasionally been portrayed as a savant , with articulate observance to certain subjects in specific detail . However , he always reverts quickly back to his usual , unintelligent self after displaying a moment of wisdom . He holds no form of occupation except for several very brief stints working at the Krusty Krab and at the Chum Bucket in a variety of positions , and mostly spends his time either clowning around with SpongeBob , catching jellyfish with him , or lounging beneath the rock under which he resides . 
 At home , Patrick is typically depicted either sleeping , watching TV , or engaged in the " art of doing nothing " , at which he is an expert . All the furnishings in the space under his rock are made of sand , and Patrick can simply opt to quickly build up furniture as needed ; even so , his living space is sparse and contains only the barest essentials . Aside from his best friend SpongeBob , who is often impressed by Patrick 's capacity to come up with naïve yet genius plans or solutions , Patrick frequently irritates those around him and is confounded by the simplest of questions or subjects . The characters of Mr. Krabs and Squidward have no patience for Patrick 's stupidity , and the former does not pay him much regard ; Clancy Brown , who provides Mr. Krabs ' voice , said , " The only person that he [ Mr. Krabs ] doesn 't hire is Patrick because Patrick is just too stupid to work for nothing . " Sandy often gets annoyed by Patrick , but still sees him as a friend .

 Stephen Hillenburg first became fascinated with the ocean and began developing his artistic abilities as a child . During college , he majored in marine biology and minored in art . He planned to return to college eventually to pursue a master 's degree in art . After graduating in 1984 , he joined the Ocean Institute , an organization dedicated to educating the public about marine science and maritime history . While he was there , he initially had the idea that would lead to the creation of SpongeBob SquarePants : a comic book titled The Intertidal Zone . In 1987 , Hillenburg left the institute to pursue a career in animation . 
 A few years after studying experimental animation at the California Institute of the Arts , Hillenburg met Joe Murray , creator of the Nickelodeon series Rocko 's Modern Life , at an animation festival , and was offered a job as a director of the show . Martin Olson , one of the writers for Rocko 's Modern Life , read The Intertidal Zone and encouraged Hillenburg to create a television series with a similar concept . At that point , Hillenburg had not even considered creating his own series . However , he realized that if he ever did , this would be the best approach . Production on Rocko 's Modern Life ended in 1996 . Shortly afterwards , Hillenburg began working on SpongeBob SquarePants . 
 For the show 's characters , Hillenburg started to draw and used character designs from his comic book — including starfish , crab , and sponge . He described Patrick as " probably the dumbest guy in town " . The character was conceived as a starfish to embody the animal 's nature ; according to Hillenburg , starfish look " dumb and slow " , but they are " very active and aggressive " in reality , like Patrick . Hillenburg incorporated character comedy rather than topical humor on the show to emphasize " things that are more about humorous situations and about characters and their flaws . " He designed Patrick and SpongeBob as such because " they 're whipping themselves up into situations — that 's always where the humor comes from . The rule is : Follow the innocence and avoid topical [ humor ] . " 
 In spite of being depicted as having a good temperament or state of mind , Patrick has been shown in some episodes to have a tantrum . Patrick 's emotional outbreak was originally written only for the first season episode " Valentine 's Day " , where SpongeBob and Sandy try to give Patrick a Valentine 's Day gift , and " was supposed to be a one @-@ time thing " . However , according to episode writer Jay Lender , " when that show came back it felt so right that his dark side started popping up everywhere . You can plan ahead all you want , but the characters eventually tell you who they are . " 
 Every main character in the show has its own unique footstep sound . The sound of Patrick 's footsteps is recorded by the show 's Foley crew , with a Foley talent wearing a slip @-@ on shoe . Jeff Hutchins , show 's sound designer said , " [ Going ] barefoot makes it tough to have much presence , so we decided that Patrick would be performed with shoes on . " 
 = = = Voice = = = 
 Patrick 's voice is provided by actor Bill Fagerbakke , who also does the voices of numerous other characters on SpongeBob SquarePants . While creating the show and writing its pilot episode in 1997 , Hillenburg and Derek Drymon , the show 's then @-@ creative director , were also conducting auditions to find voices for the show 's characters . Fagerbakke auditioned for the role of Patrick after Tom Kenny , SpongeBob 's voice actor , had been cast . Fagerbakke said , " Steve is such a lovely guy , and I had absolutely no feeling for the material whatsoever . " He described his experience in the audition , saying " I was just going in for another audition , and I had no idea what was in store there in terms of the remarkable visual wit and really the kind of endearing child @-@ like humanity in the show . I couldn 't pick that up from the audition material at all . I was just kind of perfunctorially trying to give the guy what he wanted . " 
 Steve Hillenburg actually played for me a portion of Tom [ Kenny ] ' s performance as the character , and they were looking for a counterpoint . And I do the big dumb stuff . That 's my deal ... that 's what I do [ sic ] . It was such a neat experience . Typically , when you audition for any kind of voiceover stuff , you 're in a studio , but as I remember it , this was , like , in a weird conference room somewhere , and he had one of those little old cassette decks that ’ s about half the size of a shoebox , and there was something so endearing about it . 
 Fagerbakke referred Patrick as " <unk> " ( a reference to his role as Michael " Dauber " <unk> on the 1990s sitcom Coach ) in the first few years of working on the show . Patrick is " enormously entertaining to portray " because , according to Fagerbakke , " when I 'm performing Patrick , there are many secrets that I could never divulge " . Fagerbakke 's approach in voicing Patrick is " much the same way I would do [ to ] any kind of character . " " I 'm always looking for opportunities to explore that freewheeling imagination and insanity of children . To be able to plug in to that and let that carry you in to a performance is such a gas , I have so much fun with that . I love kids ; I raised two girls and I love being a parent , " he said . The cast members record as a whole cast . Fagerbakke says that the situation improves his performance as a voice actor because " there is something remarkable that happens when people are working together that is unique to that . " Fagerbakke modeled his performance whenever Patrick is angry after that of American actress Shelley Winters . 
 Fagerbakke has been compared to Patrick 's character , which he concurs with . Kenny said that " Bill [ Fagerbakke ] is a big guy . The world is almost too small for him . He 's a force of nature , like Patrick . " Writer Jay Lender said , describing Fagerbakke in the recording studio , " Bill Fagerbakke is the most thoughtful performer I 've ever seen in the booth — he was always asking questions and really trying to get into the mindset , such as it is , of Patrick . " Writer Kent Osborne said of Fagerbakke , " He is this big guy , and he plays Patrick so well . He 's just this big guy , and he <unk> around . " Fagerbakke said , " I 'm clumsy . I 'm goofy . I make mistakes all the time " and agreed that " I guess I 'm a lot of Patrick . "

" He said , " Patrick is the definition of stupid and his antics will have you laughing out loud . " In a review published in 2007 , Peter Keepnews of The New York Times said , " Patrick is a popular character , and the new episodes illustrate why : He is unfailingly enthusiastic , touchingly loyal and absolutely undeterred by his intellectual limitations . <unk> voiced by Bill Fagerbakke , he is not just an endearing comic creation but a role model for idiots everywhere .

 Nancy Basile of About.com called Patrick " one of the silliest characters on SpongeBob SquarePants " .

 In 2002 , the show 's popularity among the gay community grew , and it was reported that they had embraced the show , according to BBC Online . The Wall Street Journal also raised questions about SpongeBob and Patrick in a recent article that pointed out the show 's popularity in the gay community . Tom Kenny , in response to the article , said " [ I ] felt the insinuation was a stretch . " " I had heard that gay viewers enjoy the show in the same way that lots of people — college students , parents and children — like the show [ ... ] I thought it was rather silly to hang an entire article on that . I don 't think it 's a case of it being a gay @-@ friendly show — It 's a human @-@ being @-@ friendly show . They 're all welcome , " Kenny said . 
 In 2005 , a promotional video that involves SpongeBob promoting diversity and tolerance was criticized by two U.S. Christian evangelical groups , most notably Focus on the Family , because they saw the character was being used as an advocate for homosexuality though the video contained " no reference to sex , sexual lifestyle or sexual identity . " The incident led to questions as to whether or not SpongeBob , his best friend Patrick , and the rest of the series ' characters are homosexual characters . After this speculation and comments , Hillenburg repeated his assertion that sexual preference was never considered during the creation of the show . He clarified the issue and said " We never intended them to be gay . I consider them to be almost asexual . We 're just trying to be funny and this has got nothing to do with the show . " Tom Kenny and other production members were shocked and surprised that such an issue had arisen . Derek Drymon , show 's creative director , said , " If SpongeBob holds hands with Patrick it 's because he 's his best friend and he loves him . I think the whole thing is a part of a larger agenda to stigmatize gay people . " Focus on the Family founder James Dobson later stated that his comments were taken out of context and that his original complaints were not with SpongeBob or any of the characters in the video but with the organization that sponsored the video , the We Are Family Foundation . Dobson noted that the foundation had posted pro @-@ homosexual material on its website , but later removed it . 
 Queer theorist Jeffrey P. Dennis , author of the journal article " The Same Thing We Do Every Night : Signifying Same @-@ Sex Desire in Television Cartoons , " argued that SpongeBob and Sandy are not romantically in love , while adding that he believed that SpongeBob and Patrick " are paired with arguably erotic intensity .

 = Robinson 's Arch = 
 Robinson 's Arch is the name given to a monumental staircase carried by an unusually wide stone arch , which once stood at the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount . It was built as part of the expansion of the Second Temple initiated by Herod the Great at the end of the 1st century BCE . Recent findings suggest that it may not have been completed until at least 20 years after his death . The massive stone span was constructed along with the retaining walls of the Temple Mount . It carried traffic up from ancient Jerusalem 's Lower Market area and over the Tyropoeon street to the Royal Stoa complex on the esplanade of the Mount . The overpass was destroyed during the Great Jewish Revolt , only a few decades after its completion . 
 The arch is named after Biblical scholar Edward Robinson who identified its remnants in 1838 . Excavations during the second half of the 20th century revealed both its purpose and the extent of its associated structures . Today the considerable surviving portions of the ancient overpass complex may be viewed by the public within the Jerusalem Archaeological Park . As it is adjacent to Jerusalem 's Western Wall worship area , a portion is used by some groups as a place of prayer . 
 = = History = = 
 Robinson 's Arch was constructed as part of King Herod 's renovation and expansion of the Second Temple , announced in 20 – 19 BCE . It was built to link the Tyropoeon Valley street , a major traffic artery in the Second Temple Period , with the Royal Stoa at the southern end of the Temple Mount platform . 
 The site abuts a major ancient intersection . Opposite lay a large public square fronting the Temple 's main Hulda Gates . The Tyropoeon street itself was lined with shops and formed part of the city 's Lower Market . The Royal Stoa , an exceptionally large basilica complex which served various commercial and legal functions , looked down on the intersection from atop the Temple platform . Although the Stoa stood on the Temple esplanade , it was constructed upon an expansion added by Herod . It was therefore evidently not considered sacred by some at the time , allowing it to be used for mundane activities . The heavy public traffic to and from this edifice accounts for the width of the stepped street , which approximates that of a modern four @-@ lane highway . 
 Fragments of a gate once located at the top of the overpass have been recovered . From these , the gate 's width has been calculated at 5 metres ( 16 ft ) . Due to the few extant gate remnants , it has not been established whether there may have been more than one gate . There may have been a single gate , a double gate , or even a triple gate opening into the Royal Stoa complex at this point . This was one of four gates along the western wall of the compound : 
 Now in the western quarters of the enclosure of the temple there were four gates ; the first led to the king 's palace , and went to a passage over the intermediate valley ; two more led to the suburbs of the city ; and the last led to the other city , where the road descended into the valley by a great number of steps , and thence up again by the ascent for the city lay over against the temple in the manner of a theater , and was encompassed with a deep valley along the entire south quarter . 
 The conventional view of modern @-@ archaeologists is to reckon the counting of these four gates ( e.g. 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 ) from left to right , as one would count in Western societies , making Robinson 's Arch the fourth and last in a row , counting from left to right . The question , however , which arises is whether or not Josephus , a Hebrew who was accustomed to reckon numbered objects while counting them from right to left , intended that this gate should , in fact , be the first gate mentioned in his description of the gates leading into the Temple Mount enclosure on its western side . According to the Mishnah ( <unk> 1 : 3 ) , a compendium of oral teachings received and compiled by Rabbi Judah the Prince in 189 CE , only one gate on the western side of the Temple Mount was actually in use and " served for coming in and for going out , " namely , the <unk> Gate . The other gates , presumably , had been sealed earlier . It is of singular importance that Josephus notes that of the gates built into the western enclosure of the Temple Mount , there was a bridge that also ascended to one of these gates and which same bridge was broken @-@ off by the insurgents during their war with Rome , most likely the bridge leading to the only serviceable gate . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 The arch was built as part of the Temple Mount 's massive western retaining wall , which forms its eastern support . The voussoirs spring from a row of impost blocks which were cut to produce a dentil pattern . There have been some theories which speculate that the dentils were employed as part of a system used to shore up timber forms used during construction . However , this was a common decorative element employed in the region at the time , and archaeologists have noted that in this region of limited forests it is much more likely that packed earth , rather than expensive timbers , was used to support the form on which the arch was constructed . 
 Upon completion the arch spanned 15 metres ( 49 ft ) and had a width of 15 @.@ 2 metres ( 50 ft ) . The stepped street it bore over a series of seven additional arches was more than 35 metres ( 115 ft ) in length . Robinson 's Arch itself stood 12 metres ( 39 ft ) to the north of the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount 's retaining wall , soaring some 17 metres ( 56 ft ) over the ancient Tyropoeon street that once ran along the Temple Mount 's western wall . It was among the most massive stone arches of classical antiquity . 
 Although Herod 's renovation of the Second Temple was initiated in late 1st century BCE , excavations beneath the street near the arch revealed three oil lamps of a type common in the first century CE and 17 identifiable coins , several of which were struck by Valerius Gratus , Roman procurator of Judea , in the year 17 / 18 CE . This means that the arch and nearby sections of the Western Wall were constructed after this date . 
 = = = Destruction = = = 
 The destruction of Robinson 's Arch occurred during the events surrounding the Roman sacking of Jerusalem in 70 CE . It has traditionally been blamed on the Roman legions which destroyed the Temple Mount enclosure and eventually set fire to the entire city . More recently , this has been attributed to the Zealot factions which had wrested control of the Temple Mount and fortified it prior to its fall . Some of these continued to hold out in Jerusalem 's Upper City for a month after the city had been breached by the Romans . By wrecking the overpass , as well as the viaduct at Wilson 's Arch to the north , the defenders made access to the Temple platform much more difficult for besieging forces . 
 South of the Temple Mount , excavators have uncovered an inscribed Roman milestone bearing the names of Vespasian and Titus , fashioned from one of the staircase handrails which stood on top of the arch . This places the destruction of the arch at no later than 79 CE . 
 = = Rediscovery and excavations = = 
 Four stone courses of the eastern spring of the arch , consisting of a row of impost blocks and three layers of voussoirs , have survived to modern times . This remnant was first identified in 1838 by Biblical scholar Edward Robinson and now bears his name . At that time , prior to any excavations , remains of the arch were at ground level . The ancient street level lay far underground , buried by debris from destruction of structures on the Temple Mount and later fill dumped into the Tyropoeon Valley over the centuries . Robinson believed he had identified the eastern edge of a bridge that linked the Temple Compound with the Upper City which lay on the ridge to the west . During his investigations of 1867 – 1870 , Charles Warren noted the presence of a large pier 13 metres ( 43 ft ) west of the wall and the remains of the arch . Warren concluded this was but one of many supports for a supposed series of arches supporting a bridge spanning the valley . He subsequently dug a series of seven shafts to the west at regular intervals , yet found no evidence of additional piers . 
 Only during Benjamin Mazar 's excavations between 1968 and 1977 was it discovered that the pier was in fact the western support of a single great arch . The uncovered pier , 15 @.@ 2 metres ( 50 ft ) long and 3 @.@ 6 metres ( 12 ft ) wide , was preserved to a height of 5 metres ( 16 ft ) . Within its base were found four small hollow spaces , possibly for shops opening onto the Herodian – era Tyropoeon street that passes beneath the arch . The lintels of these survive in place and are themselves arched to relieve pressure from the weight of the pier 's superstructure . Mazar 's excavations have revealed that the same pier was also the eastern external wall of a monumental building which Mazar suggested was the archives of Jerusalem mentioned by Josephus . South of the building , excavators found the remains of six vault – supporting piers , gradually decreasing in height southwards over a distance of 35 metres ( 115 ft ) . These vaults , the building and Robinson 's Arch , all supported a monumental flight of stairs which led the street up and over the <unk> street to the gate of the Royal Stoa at the top of the Temple Mount platform . Numerous stone steps , some still adjoined , were also found nearby . 
 Excavations near the arch resumed between 1994 and 1996 , directed by Ronny Reich and Yaacov <unk> . These have uncovered much of the debris from the collapse of the arch . The remains include both stairs from the staircase and stones from its rounded handrails . Some of these are still visible where they were found , at the Jerusalem Archaeological Park now occupying the site . 
 = = Egalitarian prayer site = = 
 The location of the arch along the western wall of the Temple Mount , yet at a distance from the Western Wall plaza , has prompted the Israeli Government to allow the area to be used for alternative services . In 2003 Israel 's Supreme Court disallowed women from reading the Torah or wearing traditional prayer shawls at the plaza itself , yet instructed the Israeli government to prepare the site of Robinson 's Arch to host such events . The site was inaugurated in August 2004 and has since hosted services by Reform and Conservative groups , as well as by other movements , such as Women of the Wall activists . This has resulted in the location being referred to as " HaKotel <unk> " . 
 The court @-@ ordered compromise , however , continues to be contentious . Reform and " Women of the Wall " activists consider the location to be unsatisfactory , in part due to the designation of the park as an archaeological site and the resulting restrictions on access and worship , and in part due to their perceived treatment as " second class @-@ citizens " and their exclusion from the Western Wall plaza . Eric <unk> , president of the Union for Reform Judaism , has also expressed the opinion that " The wall as it 's been understood by the Jewish people does not mean Robinson 's Arch ... It just doesn 't . " 
 In April 2013 Jewish Agency chairman Nathan <unk> proposed a solution for resolving the controversy over female prayer at the Western Wall , calling for the renovation of the site at the foot of Robinson 's Arch to make it accessible to worshippers at all hours of the day . On 25 August 2013 , a new 4 @,@ 480 square foot prayer platform was completed at Robinson 's Arch , with access at all hours , as promised . The area is named " Azarat Yisrael " ( or in more proper pronunciation , " <unk> Yisrael " ) . After some controversy regarding the question of authority over this prayer area , the announcement was made that it would come under the authority of a future government @-@ appointed " pluralist council " that would include non @-@ Orthodox representatives . 
 = Fringe ( TV series ) = 
 Fringe is an American science fiction television series created by J. J. Abrams , Alex Kurtzman , and Roberto Orci . It premiered on the Fox Broadcasting network on September 9 , 2008 , and concluded on January 18 , 2013 , after five seasons and 100 episodes . The series follows Olivia Dunham ( Anna Torv ) , Peter Bishop ( Joshua Jackson ) , and Walter Bishop ( John Noble ) , all members of the fictional Fringe Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , based in Boston , Massachusetts , under the supervision of Homeland Security . The team uses fringe science and FBI investigative techniques to investigate a series of unexplained , often ghastly occurrences , which are related to mysteries surrounding a parallel universe . 
 The series has been described as a hybrid of fantasy and procedural dramas and serials , influenced by film and television shows such as Lost , The X @-@ Files , Altered States , and The Twilight Zone . The series began as a traditional mystery @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week series and became more serialized in later seasons . Most episodes contain a standalone plot , with several others also exploring the series ' overarching mythology . 
 Critical reception was at first lukewarm but became more favorable after the first season , when the series began to explore its mythology , including parallel universes and alternate timelines . The show , as well as the cast and crew , has been nominated for many major awards . Despite its move to the " Friday night death slot " and low ratings , the series has developed a cult following . It has also spawned two six @-@ part comic book series , an alternate reality game , and three novels . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Fringe follows the casework of the Fringe Division , a Joint Federal Task Force supported primarily by the Federal Bureau of Investigation , which includes Agent Olivia Dunham ; Dr. Walter Bishop , the archetypal mad scientist ; and Peter Bishop , Walter 's estranged son and jack @-@ of @-@ all @-@ trades . They are supported by Phillip Broyles ( Lance Reddick ) , the force 's director , and Agent Astrid Farnsworth ( Jasika Nicole ) , who assists Walter in laboratory research . The Fringe Division investigates cases relating to fringe science , ranging from transhumanist experiments gone wrong to the prospect of a destructive technological singularity to a possible collision of two parallel universes . The Fringe Division 's work often intersects with advanced biotechnology developed by a company called Massive Dynamic , founded by Walter 's former partner , Dr. William Bell ( Leonard Nimoy ) , and run by their common friend , Nina Sharp ( Blair Brown ) . The team is also watched silently by a group of bald , pale men who are called " Observers " . 
 Season 1 introduces the Fringe Division as they investigate cases that form " the Pattern " geographically centered around Reiden Lake in New York state , many of which are orchestrated by an international network of rogue scientists known as ZFT ( <unk> durch <unk> der Technologie , or in English , Destruction through Advancement of Technology ) , led by David Robert Jones ( Jared Harris ) , who are preparing for a doomsday event . The ZFT threat appears to end when Peter kills Jones as he attempts travel to a parallel universe . Olivia comes to learn she was a child test subject for Walter years ago for a nootropic drug , Cortexiphan , giving her weak psionic abilities . Walter also struggles with adjusting to normal life in Peter 's care after living seventeen years in a mental institution while hiding the fact that Peter is from the parallel universe , " his " Peter having died as a child . 
 In Season 2 , the occurrences are found to be in conjunction with activities of a parallel universe , which is plagued by singularities occurring at weakened points of the fabric between worlds ; over there , scientists have developed an amber @-@ like substance that isolates these singularities as well as any innocent people caught in the area on its release . The Fringe team deals with more cases that are leading to a " great storm " as the parallel universe appears to be at war with the prime one , engineered by human @-@ machine hybrid shapeshifters from the parallel universe . Walter is forced to tell Peter that he is from the parallel universe , a replacement for his own Peter , who died from a genetic disease . Walter had crossed over on the frozen ice of Reiden Lake in 1985 to administer the cure for the alternate version of Peter , but , after accidentally destroying a dose of the cure upon transport , he instead brought the boy across . On return , they fell through the ice but were saved by the Observer September ( Michael Cerveris ) , who told Walter of the importance of " the boy " , which Walter took to mean Peter . Walter 's crossing is what caused the singularities in the parallel universe , with Reiden Lake at their epicenter . Walter has been looking for a sign of forgiveness in the form of a white tulip . 
 Season 3 presents episodes that alternate between the two universes . " Walternate " , Walter 's doppelgänger in the parallel universe , is the U.S. Secretary of Defense and has set events in motion to assemble the Machine , a doomsday device that reacts only to Peter 's biology . He also sent his Olivia , " Fauxlivia " 2 , to the prime universe , in Olivia 's place , to engage the Fringe Division and assemble the prime universe 's version of the device , while he studies Olivia 's Cortexiphan @-@ induced powers . By happenstance , Fauxlivia becomes pregnant with Peter 's child , Henry , before being outed and extracted to the parallel universe . Walternate orchestrated acceleration of the pregnancy to gain a sample of the baby 's blood , which he uses to activate the machine . Peter , with Olivia 's help , enters the prime version of the machine , and experiences a vision of the future where the parallel universe has been destroyed and the same fate threatens the prime one , and learns the Machine is really a device created by Walter and his associates from this future , sent back in time purposely to relay this vision of the future to Peter . Recovering in the present , Peter alters his plan and uses the Machine to merge the two rooms , creating a bridge where inhabitants of both universes can solve their dilemma , before time re @-@ written so September ( The Observer ) doesn 't save him and is forgotten by both Walter and Olivia . 
 Season 4 begins in an alternate timeline , one in which September had failed to save the alternate version of Peter in 1985 , according to the Observers . This creates a butterfly effect influencing the main characters ' pasts but otherwise stabilizing both universes due to the creation of the bridge . Peter is pulled into this new timeline due to the actions of the alternate timeline 's Fringe team , which includes Lincoln Lee ( Seth Gabel ) . Peter initially works to return to his own timeline , fueled by fears that his memories are altering Cortexiphan @-@ dosed Olivia 's of this timeline , but after encountering a wounded September , Peter comes to learn that this timeline is truly his home , and both he and Olivia come to accept the change , rekindling their affair . September also reveals to Peter that the Observers needed to erase Peter 's son , Henry , to assure their future will be created , though noting that Peter 's future child with Olivia will be important . Meanwhile , in the present , William Bell has instructed David Robert Jones , alive in this timeline , to work with the parallel universe 's version of Nina Sharp to synchronize the two universes , aiming to collapse them both and pave the way for a third universe under Bell 's control , using Olivia 's Cortexiphan powers to enable the collapse . The Fringe division is forced to close the dimensional bridge , but this fails to stop Bell 's plan . Walter is left with one choice , to shoot and kill Olivia , her death disrupting the process and saving the world . Olivia 's " death " is only temporary , as the Cortexiphan in her body is consumed to repair the bullet wound , leaving her alive and healthy but lacking her psionic abilities . As Olivia and Peter begin their lives together , September appears to Walter and warns that the Observers " are coming " . 
 The fifth and final season begins in 2036 , following from the flash @-@ forward fourth season episode " Letters of Transit " . As September warned , Observers from the far future , having ruined Earth for themselves , time @-@ traveled to 2015 and instituted " The Purge " , wiped out much of humanity , subjected the survivors to their control , and began modifying the planet 's environment to be more suitable for themselves . The Fringe team was able to seal themselves in amber to avoid capture shortly after the Purge , and are reunited through Henrietta ( " Etta " ) ( Georgina Haig ) , Peter and Olivia 's now adult daughter who disappeared shortly after the Observer arrival in 2015 . Walter reveals he and September developed a plan to defeat the Observers , revealed through a series of pre @-@ recorded videotapes <unk> in the lab . The tapes lead to several components of a device , including a young Observer child , named Michael ( Spencer List in Season 1 and Rowan Longworth in Season 5 ) , but further allude to a man named Donald that had helped Walter prepare the plan . Etta is killed during these events , driving Olivia and Peter to complete the plan for her sake . Through Michael , they discover Donald is September , having been stripped of his Observer powers for helping the Fringe team , and that Michael is his genetic son , having been purposely grown as an anomaly in the far future . September explains the plan is to send Michael to the year <unk> , where human genetic experiments to sacrifice emotion for intelligence would be started and leading to the creation of the Observers ; by showing them Michael , who possesses both emotion and intelligence , the experiments would be stopped and the Observers never created . September is prepared to take Michael to the future as the plan is set in motion , but he is shot and killed at the last moment ; Walter , already made aware that he will have to make a sacrifice , takes Michael through to the future to assure the plan 's completion . As predicted , time is reset from the invasion onwards in 2015 ; the Observers never invade , and Peter , Olivia , and Etta , live their lives peacefully — though Peter receives one final letter from his father : a drawing of a white tulip . 
 = = = Parallel universe = = = 
 Much of the story arc for Fringe involves an alternate universe that mostly mirrors the prime universe , but with numerous historical idiosyncrasies . A significant example element used is the effect of the September 11 attacks ; though this event also occurred in the alternate universe , the World Trade Center was untouched by the attacks , leaving the buildings as predominant landmarks in the alternate world 's skyline of " <unk> " . The South Tower was used as the office of William Bell in several episodes . 
 The producers were strongly interested in " world building , " and the alternate universe allowed them to create a very similar world with a large amount of detail to fill in the texture of the world . An alternate universe also allowed them to show " how small choices that you make define you as a person and can change your life in large ways down the line , " according to co @-@ director Jeff Pinkner . However , the producers also realized the concept of the alternate universe could be confusing to viewers . To avoid this , elements of the world were introduced in small pieces over the course of the first two seasons before the larger revelation in the second season finale and the third season . J. H. Wyman stated that he would often pass the story ideas for the alternate universe by his father to see if it made sense , and would rework the script if his father found it confusing . Such world building also gave them a risky opportunity to create stories that focused solely on characters from the alternate universe with nearly no ties to the main characters ; as stated by Wyman , they would be able to " make two shows about one show , " a concept that the network executives embraced . 
 = = = Glyph code = = = 
 Prior to commercial breaks , a brief image of a glyph is shown . Abrams revealed in an interview that the glyphs had a hidden meaning . " It 's something that we 're doing for people who care to figure it out and follow it , but it 's not something that a viewer has to consider when they watch the show . " Abrams also revealed that the seemingly unrelated frogs which have the Greek letter Phi ( Φ ) imprinted on their back appeared in promos for the show have significance within the context of the series , saying " it 's part of the code of the show . " The glyph code was cracked by an editor at the technology site Ars Technica , who discovered it to be a simple substitution cipher used to spell out a single thematic word for each episode ; for example , the pilot episode 's eight glyphs spell out the word " observer " . Whether there is a further second @-@ order code to be solved remains to be seen . Additionally , the glyphs are representative of some of the means by which Walter solves a case ( such as the moth / butterfly from " Johari Window " , the seahorse strain of DNA from " The Bishop Revival " ) . In " Jacksonville " , behind Walter as he speaks to Olivia about her treatment where the nootropic Cortexiphan was first studied as a trial , each of the glyphs is clearly visible on the daycare wall . An episode @-@ by @-@ episode key to the various glyphs was made available on <unk> . 
 = = = Opening sequence = = = 
 The show 's standard opening sequence <unk> images of the glyph symbols alongside words representing fringe science topics , such as " teleportation " and " dark matter " . Within the third season , with episodes that took place primarily in the parallel universe , a new set of titles was used , following a similar format , though tinted red instead of blue and using alternate fringe science concepts like " hypnosis " and " neuroscience " . The difference in color has led some fans to call the prime universe the Blue one in contrast to the parallel Red one . In the third @-@ season episode " Entrada " , the titles used a mix of both the blue- and red @-@ tinted versions , given that the episode took place equally in each universe . In the two flashback episodes , " Peter " and " Subject 13 , " a variation on the sequence , using retro graphics akin to 1980s technology and phrases like " personal computing " and " genetic engineering , " was used . For the dystopian future third season episode " The Day We Died , " a black @-@ toned theme , with more dire phrases like " hope " and " water , " was used . The fourth season premiere , " Neither Here Nor There " introduced an amber @-@ toned title sequence with additional new terms that is used for nearly all fourth @-@ season episodes . The fourth @-@ season episode " Letters of Transit , " which returned to the future dystopian universe , and the subsequent fifth season episodes , feature a cold @-@ toned title sequence with phrases such as " joy , " " private thought , " " free will , " and " freedom , " ideas which have been lost in this future . There is one frame in the opening sequence in which the words " Observers are here " flash very quickly , and the opening sequence must be paused to see them .

 = = = Conception = = = 
 Co @-@ created by J. J. Abrams , Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman , Fringe is produced by Bad Robot in association with Warner Bros. Television , as part of a commitment that Abrams previously made with the studio . At the time , Abrams was working with Orci and Kurtzman on the Star Trek film , and met at one of the Comic @-@ Cons during Star Trek 's production to brainstorm ideas for the show . Abrams later brought Bryan Burk , a producer on several of his films , to help with developing the series . 
 Abrams 's inspiration for Fringe came from a range of sources , including the writings of Michael Crichton , the film Altered States , films by David Cronenberg , and the television series The X @-@ Files and The Twilight Zone . Orci stated that Fringe is a " new kind of storytelling " , combining procedural shows such as Law & Order , and an " extremely serialized and very <unk> " series like Lost . The procedural aspect was chosen because , at the time of its premiere , six of the ten top shows were procedural in nature ; Orci stated that " you have to be a fool not to go study what it is that they 're doing " . Abrams had originally considered naming the series The Lab , as they had envisioned Walter 's laboratory to be " the epicenter of the conversation " , and where " anything is possible " . 
 Though the team saw this as a way of presenting " mystery of the week " -type episodes , they wanted to focus more on how these stories were told in unpredictable ways rather than the actual mystery , recognizing that most of their target audience has seen such mysteries before through previous shows and films . Instead , they wanted their storytelling to be original and unexpected , and , as claimed by Kurtzman , one of the most challenging aspects of developing the individual episodes . Serialization of the show was important to tell their overall story with larger plot elements , but Abrams recognized the difficulties that his earlier serialized shows , such as Lost and Alias , had in attracting and maintaining viewers that had not seen these shows from the start or who missed episodes sporadically . For Fringe , Abrams instead sought to create , as stated by David Itzkoff of the New York Times , " a show that suggested complexity but was comprehensible in any given episode " . The writers aimed to balance a line between stand @-@ alone episodes , a factor requested by Fox , and a heavily serialized show ; they balanced these by moving the serialization aspect to the growth and development of their characters . This gave them the ability to write self @-@ contained episodes that still contained elements related to the overall mythos . However , as production continued , the creative staff found the show itself took on a more serialized nature and opted towards this approach in later seasons while still balancing self @-@ contained episodes . 
 One method was by introducing overarching themes that individual episodes could be tied to , such as " The Pattern " in Season 1 , providing information repeatedly about the larger plot over the course of several episodes or seasons . Abrams also created characters whose alliances to the larger narrative were clear , avoiding a similar problem that had occurred during the first and second seasons of Alias . A final step taken was to script out all of the major long @-@ running plot elements , including the show 's finale , prior to full @-@ time production . Abrams contrasted this to the process used in Lost , where ideas like character flashbacks and the hatch from the second season were introduced haphazardly and made difficulties in defining when they should be presented to the viewers . Instead , with Fringe , they were able to create " clearly defined goalposts " ( in Itzkoff 's words ) that could be altered as necessary with network and seasonal changes but always provided a clear target for the overarching plot . These approaches also allowed the team to introduce unique plot elements to be introduced in time that would have altered the show 's fate if known at the start . Abrams stated that " There are certain details that are hugely important that I believe , if shared , will destroy any chance of actually getting on the air . " Abrams noted that they are able to benefit from " how open Fox as a network has been to a show that is embracing the weirdness and the long @-@ term stories that we want to tell " . During the third season , executive producer Jeff Pinkner noted that " We have six to eight seasons worth of material . We see it as having certain chapters that would enrich the overall story , but aren 't necessary to tell the overall story . God willing , the network allows us the time to tell our complete story . " 
 As part of the larger story , the writers have placed elements in earlier episodes that are referenced in episodes seasons later . For example , in the first season episode " The Ghost Network " , the Fringe team encounters an amber @-@ like substance , which is later shown to be a critical means to combat the breakdown of the parallel universe and eventually for the same in the prime universe with the third season episode " 6B " . Pinkner compared this aspect to " planting seeds " , some which they know how they plan to use later in the show 's story , while others they can find ways of incorporating into these later episodes . 
 He further attributed these elements as part of the " world building " to flesh out the show beyond episodic content . The producers have stated that when the show 's mythology is introduced , it is not simply there to tie episodes together , but " to provide answers that generate consequences " . 
 Certain elements of the show 's mythology were established from the start . The parallel universe was always part of the original concept , though aspects of when and how to introduce it were tackled as the show proceeded . The idea of Peter being from the parallel universe came early into the show 's production , but this came to lead the team to jokingly refer to Peter as their " hatch " , one of the early mysteries in Lost , as with the hatch in Lost , they initially had no idea how to introduce this within the show . FOX 's Reilly was also initially concerned about the parallel universe aspect , but as the show progressed into the first season and found its groove , the concept was readily accepted . The most poignant introduction of the parallel universe was in the conclusion of the first season finale , " There 's More Than One of Everything " , where they showed the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center were still standing in the parallel universe , a concept introduced by writer Andrew Kreisberg as an iconic image to leave viewers with ; Jackson stated , " I don 't know that we 've ever had a better visual or a better cliff @-@ hanger . " 
 Other mythos elements were devised as the series progressed . The writers had originally envisioned only spending small portions of episodes within the parallel universe , but as they wrote these episodes within Season 3 , they brought out the idea of setting entire episodes within the parallel universe . This necessitated the development of the alternate versions of the main characters , which Pinkner considered " a great playground just for imagination " . The actors themselves found this concept exciting , as it allowed them to play different characters but with the same background and considered it a creative challenge . Similarly , having Peter erased from the timeline as part of the finale for Season 3 was an idea that grew over the course of that season . The writers were aware this would be a risky move but felt the idea was very appropriate for Fringe , and opted to write towards this after considering all the consequences . Pinkner noted that this gave them an opportunity to " reset the character relationships " and determine the key aspects that would remain without Peter , as well as " making the audience uncomfortable at times " . The cast was not initially sold with the idea , but came around as the fourth season progressed . 
 = = = Production = = = 
 After developing the core concepts of the show , Abrams began to seek studios to develop the show ; Abrams ' past successes led to Warner Bros. Television and the Fox Television Network to quickly jump on board the project . Peter Roth , the chief executive of Warner Bros. Television , had been actively seeking to bring any Abrams ' project to his studio , and heard Abrams ' pitch for Fringe at a dinner meeting in August 2007 . Similarly , Kevin Reilly , the entertainment chairman at Fox , knew that it was critical for him to bring the next Abrams ' project to his network , and worked with Roth to assure this would happen . 
 Jeff Pinkner was selected to act as the head showrunner and executive producer . Abrams noted that he trusts Pinkner after working together with him on Alias and Lost . Pinkner became interested in the show during a visit to the set of Star Trek , during which Abrams was discussing the concept of Fringe with Orci and Kurtzman , knowing that they would not be involved in the direct production of the work . Abrams pitched the idea to Pinkner , who was intrigued by the importance of characters in a science fiction drama . In season two , J.H. Wyman was brought on as executive producer and showrunner with Pinkner . Wyman had been a science fiction enthusiast but had worried that he had not written anything in that genre but after learning about the concept of the show , felt his role as an executive producer was " a match made in heaven " . 
 Michael Giacchino , Abrams ' frequent collaborator , composed the music for the pilot of Fringe , before handing over duties to his assistants Chad Seiter and Chris Tilton ; Tilton took over scoring duties from Season 2 onward . While Giacchino retains an on @-@ screen credit , Abrams himself wrote the series theme music . 
 The two @-@ hour pilot episode , filmed in Toronto , Canada , cost a total of $ 10 million to create . A basement of an old church was used for Walter 's lab set in the pilot , and this set was replicated at other film sites in New York and Vancouver when the show moved . The lab set was designed by Carol Spier , the production designer for several of Cronenberg 's films . John Noble called his character 's lab " the heart and soul of Fringe " , so consequently , " That has to remain constant . " A cow used in the pilot episode had to be recast when production of Season 1 was moved to New York , due to livestock restrictions preventing it from being brought from Canada to the United States . Other locations used in the first season included other universities to stage for the Harvard University campus , where Walter 's lab is located . These included Pratt Institute and Yale University , including its Old Campus ( particularly Phelps Hall and Durfee Hall ) , Branford College , and the exterior of Yale Law School , University of Toronto 's University College , Brooklyn College . 
 On February 21 , 2009 , it was reported that in the event that Fringe would be renewed for a second season , the show would move production to Vancouver from New York City as a cost @-@ cutting measure . Executive producer Jeff Pinkner explained : 
 We want to stay in New York , New York has been incredibly good to us . It feels like we 're being kicked out of the city . I know we 're not , but they 're making it impossible for us to afford doing the show ... Our New York crew is spectacular , they 've worked their [ butts ] off to make the show look great . But it looks like New York is not renewing a tax credit that makes it possible to make our budget in New York . So it looks like , out of necessity , we 'll have to leave New York , which is not anything we are welcoming . 
 Upon productions moving to Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada for season 2 , the University of British Columbia now stands in for Harvard . The area around New Westminster often serves as filming locations for Fringe stories that take place in the parallel universe . 
 Prior to the start of production for the fifth season , Pinkner announced that he was leaving the production of the show to pursue other projects ; Wyman would remain as the sole showrunner for the show .

 The show 's main characters , Olivia , Peter , and Walter , were core of the concept for Fringe . The creators recognized early that " the idea that telling a father @-@ son story and a relationship story was a really compelling one and a very accessible one " , according to Kurtzman . They were able to provide the characters with backstories that , like with other long @-@ term plot elements , could be alluded to over several episodes and seasons . 
 The characters would also contrast with the typical procedural genre show ; rather than having clearly defined roles episode to episode , they instead " have an emotional memory and an emotional investment " , as stated by Orci . This also allowed for , as necessary , characters to be removed or introduced to the show and have a larger impact on the other characters . 
 The first actors cast were Kirk Acevedo and Mark Valley , who portrayed FBI agents Charlie Francis and John Scott , respectively . John Noble and Lance Reddick , who play Dr. Walter Bishop and Homeland Security agent Phillip Broyles , joined the cast later on . Casting of Anna Torv , Blair Brown , and Jasika Nicole , who play Olivia Dunham , Massive Dynamic employee Nina Sharp , and Astrid Farnsworth , a federal agent and assistant to Olivia Dunham , respectively , followed ; while Joshua Jackson , who plays Peter Bishop , was the last main character to be cast . Jackson auditioned for James T. Kirk in Abrams ' Star Trek and believed this is what impressed the producer to cast him in his television project , though Abrams later clarified that it was recalling his previous experience with working with Jackson on his television series Felicity . For the principal and recurring actors , they were all intrigued by the script for the pilot , comparing it to a two @-@ hour @-@ long movie , as well as Abrams ' reputation . 
 On April 8 , 2009 , it was announced that Leonard Nimoy would appear as Walter Bishop 's former lab partner , Dr. William Bell in the first season 's finale , which explores the existence of an ominous parallel universe . This choice led one reviewer to question if Fringe 's plot might be a homage to the Star Trek episode " Mirror , Mirror " , which explored the concept of an alternate reality referred to as a " mirror universe " , and an evil version of Spock distinguished by a goatee . Nimoy returned as Dr. Bell for an extended arc , and according to Orci , Bell is " the beginning of the answers to even bigger questions . " Nimoy reprised his role in the second season finale , where his character and Walter met for a " showdown " . Nimoy 's character is apparently dead after the season finale , having used himself to help Walter , Peter and the Alternate Olivia back to the prime universe . As he had retired from acting , it was thought unlikely that his character would return . In February 2011 however , he announced his definite plan to return to Fringe and reprise his role as William Bell . He returned to voice the character in the animated segments of the third season episode " Lysergic Acid Diethylamide " , and appeared as a computer @-@ generated character in the fourth season episode " Letters of Transit " . In the two @-@ part finale of the fourth season , Nimoy returned to play the ultimate antagonist of the alternate timeline story arc .
