 Arbitration Committee member Roger Davies wrote the majority of the decision in the Scientology case . Davies commented in an interview with The New York Times , " It was obvious that this case was going to be controversial pretty much from the start . What we have done is we 've really tried to make sure that we have not directed our fire at anyone in particular . " He noted there was a recurring pattern of disputed editing on controversial topics , " One of the problems we keep bumping into is what I call core belief issues — politics , religion , nationalism . Fringe faiths , fringe nationalities . " 
 Wikimedia Foundation spokesman and head of communications , Jay Walsh , stated the decision was focused on reducing hostility within the subject and getting articles back to an appropriate state . Walsh emphasized to Bloomberg BusinessWeek that edits which serve the interests of organizations are acceptable , but must be within the procedure of " adding valuable context " to articles . In a statement to The Wall Street Journal , Walsh said , " This is about people reducing the hostility around the topic , and getting the articles back to a state where they make sense . I think the arbitration committee wants to send the message that Wikipedians have to be neutral on all accounts and all fronts . They don 't take these situations lightly . They understand there 's a perspective of : Are we censoring people or individuals ? It 's really about what can we do that 's best for Wikipedia and the people who read it . " When asked by Ross Reynolds of National Public Radio affiliate KUOW @-@ FM why the Arbitration decision included a " ban on IP addresses at the Church of Scientology " , Walsh answered , " So the simple answer is that within looking at these computers and where these edits were coming from , the decision is that ultimately most of the edits within these ranges have been from single @-@ user @-@ accounts , people who have a single intention to change or move or in some cases remove information , which could be considered censorship , which is really something that doesn 't work out well on Wikipedia . And this is an effort to kind of calm that effect , and to bring some neutrality and some quality back to these articles . " 
 Wikipedia media contact , Dan Rosenthal , stated to ABC News , " Scientology is up there among the most controversial on Wikipedia . You can compare it to articles on abortion , the presidential election and the like and there 's been nowhere near the level of bitterness and fighting . " Rosenthal commented , " You could imply that there is a conflict of interest . Rather than two unrelated people getting together " , promoters of the Scientology organization were " getting together , saying , ' Let 's work together to make this a more pro @-@ scientology article . ' " Rosenthal noted that " it is standard practice to ban users found violating rules designed to keep people with an agenda from propagandizing . " Rosenthal said that approximately 300 users are blocked or banned per day from Wikipedia in order to stop vandalism , or for violating regulations created to prevent propaganda . Catrin <unk> , spokesperson for Wikimedia Germany , stated to <unk> that the decision impacted the English Wikipedia version , and it was unknown whether a similar decision in the future would be applied to the German Wikipedia site .

 Scientology spokeswoman , Karin Pouw , stated of the Wikipedia Arbitration decision , " Do Scientologists care what has been posted on Wikipedia ? Of course . Some of it has been very hateful and erroneous . " Pouw commented , " We hope all this will result in more accurate and useful articles on Wikipedia . " She characterized the Arbitration Committee decision as " a routine internal action by Wikipedia to clean up its editing process " . Pouw emphasized , " More importantly is the fact that Wikipedia finally banned those who were engaged in <unk> and biased editing for the purposes of antagonism as opposed to providing accurate information . " Pouw commented to ABC News , " People have conflicts on Wikipedia all the time , and it 's obvious why — anybody can post . " Bloomberg Businessweek reported on Pouw 's statements , " [ Pouw ] says her organization regularly monitors the Internet for wrong information about its belief system and members . After this ruling , Pouw says there remain ' gross inaccuracies ' on the Scientology article on Wikipedia that she hopes will eventually be corrected . But for the time being , her group 's ability to do that have been weakened . " In a statement to CNN , Pouw asserted " she is unaware of any coordinated effort to alter Wikipedia " . 
 Tommy Davis , a representative of the Scientology organization , stated to the St. Petersburg Times that members of the organization were attempting to correct what they perceived as factual inaccuracies : " The story that 's being missed is there were people who were doing nonstop attacks on the church and using Wikipedia to do it . Those people have been banned . " Davis denied that Scientology leadership arranged a campaign to manipulate entries on Wikipedia . He asserted , " The church is huge ... Scientologists are going to say what they 're going to say about their own religion . "

 Writing in the 2009 book Scientology , contributor Mikael Rothstein commented positively about the Wikipedia article on " Xenu " , " The most sober and enlightening text about the Xenu myth is probably the anonymous article on Wikipedia ... " Writing about Scientology in her 2010 book Insiders ' Guide to the Greater Tampa Bay Area , author Anne W. Anderson noted , " In May 2009 , Wikipedia ... imposed a very rare ban on some computers that were repeatedly editing entries about Scientology . " In an August 2009 article for TIME , titled " A Brief History of Wikipedia " , journalist Dan Fletcher noted , " In May , Wikipedia banned IP addresses owned by the Church of Scientology on the grounds that Scientologists were making edits that didn 't suggest a ' neutral point of view ' — the encyclopedia 's golden rule . " 
 Stephen Colbert discussed the Arbitration decision on his comedy program The Colbert Report Colbert commented , " Folks , I think this is the worst tragedy to befall Scientologists , since galactic overlord Xenu stacked billions of frozen people around volcanoes which he detonated with hydrogen bombs . " 
 In an interview with ABC News , sociologist of the University of Alberta , Stephen A. Kent commented , " Historically , Scientology has tried to control what critics say about it . The Internet , however , has posed insurmountable problems regarding control and censorship and Wikipedia 's action is just one of many disputes that have occurred when Internet users have pushed back . Scientology can 't roll over and give up on this issue . It will continue to attempt to have its representation . " Evgeny Morozov of Foreign Policy wrote a blog post critical of the Arbitration decision , and stated , " I am no fan of Scientology , but I think that banning them from Wikipedia is going to be counterproductive . Unfortunately , it presents the Wikipedia admins / editors as a non @-@ neutral group that opposes a particular set of ideas . " In an August 2010 article in The Guardian , journalists Rachel <unk> and Jemima Kiss observed , " Editors can remain anonymous when changing content , but conflicts are passed to Wikipedia 's arbitration committee . Scientology was a regular source of conflict until the committee blocked editing by the movement . " 
 = New York State Route 421 = 
 New York State Route 421 ( NY 421 ) is a short state highway located within Adirondack Park in the southeastern corner of St. Lawrence County , New York , in the United States . It is a narrow , two @-@ lane spur route connecting NY 30 to Horseshoe Lake by way of Tupper Lake . A dead end sign is posted immediately off NY 30 , the only route with which it intersects . The entire road is located in the town of Piercefield , although that name is not posted on NY 421 . The route offers access to several picnic and snowmobile areas . 
 The eastern portion of NY 421 was built in the 1920s under the terms of a 1923 law authorizing the construction of a highway leading from modern NY 30 north to Warren Point . NY 421 was assigned to the entirety of the north – south highway c . 1931 . The roadway connecting Horseshoe Lake to Tupper Lake was built c . 1962 and became part of NY 421 by 1968 . NY 421 's former routing to Warren Point remained a state highway up through 1999 , when a bill permitting the New York State Department of Transportation ( NYSDOT ) to remove it from the state highway system was signed into law . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 421 begins at a dead end south of the hamlet of Horseshoe in an isolated part of the town of Piercefield . Here , the highway connects to a pair of dirt roads , one of which leads north alongside Horseshoe Lake to Horseshoe . The two @-@ lane route heads eastward from the trails , following the southern shore of Horseshoe Lake while traversing the deep woods of Adirondack Park . At the southeastern end of the lake , NY 421 turns northeastward , crossing a small stream feeding into the lake before curving back toward the east . For the next 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) , the road passes through unabated wilderness as it heads toward the western shoreline of Tupper Lake . 
 At Tupper Lake , the route serves a cluster of recreational buildings at its intersection with Warren Point Road , a private drive leading to Warren Point . Here , NY 421 turns southward , running along the lake shore to nearby Paradise Point Road , which leads east to Paradise Point and the lakeside Veterans ' Mountain Camp . After Paradise Point Road , the highway follows a winding , southeasterly course along Tupper Lake , passing little more than dense forests while crossing over the Bog River near its mouth . NY 421 follows the lake to its southern tip , where the route ends at an intersection with NY 30 just west of the St. Lawrence – Franklin county line . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1923 , the New York State Legislature passed a law authorizing the construction of a highway connecting Route 24 ( an unsigned legislative route that is now part of NY 30 ) to the new Veterans ' Mountain Camp , an American Legion camp on Tupper Lake . The work was funded through appropriations defined in the law . The highway was completed by 1929 and extended from modern NY 30 north to a dead end at Warren Point . In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , hundreds of state @-@ maintained highways that did not yet have a designation were assigned one . The Veterans ' Mountain Camp highway was designated as NY 421 by the following year . 
 A highway leading westward from NY 421 southwest of Warren Point to Horseshoe Lake was completed c . 1962 . It became part of an extended NY 421 by 1968 . At the time , NY 421 's western terminus was located at a railroad crossing in the isolated hamlet of Horseshoe , situated at the northwestern corner or Horseshoe Lake . The former routing of NY 421 north to Warren Point , legislatively designated as State Highway <unk> , was initially considered a spur of NY 421 ; it was later redesignated as NY 971D , an unsigned reference route . By 1993 , the west end of NY 421 was moved about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) south to its current location southwest of Horseshoe Lake . 
 After the Veterans ' Mountain Camp was closed in the 1960s , the property was sold off to private owners , turning NY 971D into little more than a private drive . Thus , the road saw little use , handling less than 10 vehicles per day on average . As a result , the New York State Department of Transportation ( NYSDOT ) no longer considered the highway worthy of inclusion in the state highway system and began to take steps to remove the highway from the system . On February 22 , 1999 , NYSDOT sent a memorandum to the New York State Senate that laid out the groundwork for a bill which , if passed , would allow NYSDOT to remove NY 971D from the state highway system once it was able to transfer ownership and maintenance of the highway to another entity . A bill based on the memo was introduced in the State Senate on March 29 and eventually passed by the Senate and the New York State Assembly . The bill was signed into law by Governor George Pataki on July 27 , 1999 . The former routing of NY 971D is now officially a private drive .

Anokute , who previously was an A & R for Perry at her label Capitol Records , told Azalea that Perry was a fan of her music . When Azalea was nominated at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards , Anokute asked Perry if she could promote Azalea 's nomination in her category for Artist to Watch .

The video was directed by Director X and Iggy Azalea and premiered through VEVO on 13 August 2014 . American actors Michael Madsen , Paul Sorvino , and actor / rapper T.I. also appear in the video . On 14 August 2014 , exclusive behind @-@ the @-@ scenes footage from the video set was shown on the second episode of MTV 's show House of Style , hosted by Azalea and where she revealed the visuals are inspired by 70s kung fu films and Tarantino movies . 
 = = = Synopsis = = = 
 The video starts with Rita Ora and her boyfriend , played by Michael Madsen , entering a diner . The man steps on and squishes a spider with his boot , just before Iggy Azalea is shown as a waitress named Fox behind the diner counter . Azalea then approaches the couple and hands them the menu . The man orders a BLT sandwich " dripping with melted cheese " and just when Ora is about to order he interrupts her by saying " she 's gonna have the same damn thing " , which causes Ora to look at him somewhat upset . As Azalea arrives with the order , the man starts complaining about the sandwich and refuses to eat it . Then , the owner of the diner , Big Wanda , jumps over the counter and asks if there 's a problem . After hearing the man 's complaint , Azalea tries to explain but to no avail when the owner says " What did the Fox say ? Nothing ! " and she is told to make another sandwich with more cheese . Ora is shocked when the owner begins to flirt with her boyfriend in front of her , and her boyfriend ignores her because the owner promises him a " big , juicy BLT sandwich " that is the menu 's special . When Ora tries to speak up , she is verbally put down by the owner , who says her special order is " nothing like the little sandwich " Ora has . Ora continues to show disapproval towards the situation . 
 The song starts just when Azalea starts chopping the lettuce . Azalea 's dream starts , in which she can be seen with Ora in a snowy scene , both dressed in similar jumpsuits with a " Black Widow " on each of their backs . When the scene changes , Azalea is training with an older Japanese man , followed by her intercepting a poison dart . She opens the dart to find an image of Madsen with the word " Destroy " written on it . Meanwhile Ora is playing poker in an underground casino alongside Paul Sorvino and rapper T.I. and wins a large amount of money . Following this Sorvino becomes upset and aggressive , and Ora kicks him to the ground . As Sorvino lies motionless on the ground , Ora receives a <unk> message with the image of her next target - Madsen . She and Azalea both ride motorcycles to Madsen 's club . Azalea unsheathes her katana and strides towards Madsen as the terrified club patrons flee . Madsen summons his guards to attack Azalea but Ora arrives as her backup , and the pair defeat the guards . They then confront Madsen who draws a gun on them , but before he can shoot them he is bitten by a black widow spider and dies . 
 The scene snaps back to reality , revealing all the previous events were a dream sequence of Azalea 's , who is actually still chopping lettuce with the owner of the diner screaming at her .

 The clip was generally well received by fans and critics . Brian Anthony Hernandez of Mashable wrote : " Step aside , Uma Thurman . In what could essentially amount to an audition tape for Kill Bill 3 , " Fancy " rapper Iggy Azalea and " R.I.P " singer Rita Ora have transformed into beautiful assassins in their elaborate music video for " Black Widow . " Samantha Nelson of AXS claimed " the video coincides with the female empowerment concept , " but was disappointed with the lack of single shots of Azalea rapping and the focus being on the Kill Bill theme rather than the actual performance of the song itself , while Brittney Stephens of PopSugar noted that " Iggy Azalea has already proven that she can pull off the music @-@ video movie spinoff . " " Black Widow " was nominated for " Best Video " at the 2014 MTV Europe Music Awards .

 = St Beuno 's Church , Aberffraw = 
 St Beuno 's Church , Aberffraw is a 12th @-@ century parish church in Anglesey , north Wales . A church was established in Aberffraw in the 7th century by St Beuno , who became the abbot of Clynnog Fawr , Gwynedd . St Beuno 's may have been used as a royal chapel during the early Middle Ages , as the princes of Gwynedd had a court in Aberffraw . The oldest parts of the church date from the 12th century , although it was considerably enlarged in the 16th century when a second nave was built alongside the existing structure , with the wall in between replaced by an arcade of four arches . Restoration work in 1840 uncovered a 12th @-@ century arch in the west wall , which may have been the original chancel arch or a doorway to a western tower that has been lost . The church also has a 13th @-@ century font , some memorials from the 18th century , and two 18th @-@ century copper collecting shovels . 
 The church is still used for worship by the Church in Wales , one of four in a combined parish . As of 2013 , the parish is without an incumbent priest . St Beuno 's is a Grade II * listed building , a national designation given to " particularly important buildings of more than special interest " , in particular because it is a " rare Anglesey example of a double @-@ naved church " , with elements including the " unusually fine " 12th @-@ century arch . A 2009 guide to the buildings of the region says that St Beuno 's contains " some of the most significant Romanesque work on the island " . 
 = = History and location = = 
 St Beuno 's Church is in Aberffraw on the south @-@ west coast of Anglesey , north Wales . It is set within a large churchyard in the south @-@ west of the village , on the south side of Church Street . The first church community was established in Aberffraw in the 7th century by St Beuno ( a Welsh holy man who became the abbot of Clynnog Fawr , on the Llŷn Peninsula in Gwynedd ) . No part of a structure from that period survives ; the oldest parts of the present building are the south wall of the nave and some parts of the west wall , which are from the 12th century . 
 Some work was carried out in the late 13th or the 14th century , which is the period ascribed to the doorway on the south side . The church was enlarged in the 16th century when a second aisle was erected on the north side of the church , running the length of the building , with an arcade of four arches added between the old and new parts of the building . Some restoration was undertaken in 1840 , under the Chester @-@ based architect Thomas Jones . During this work , the rector Hugh Wynne Jones discovered a blocked 12th @-@ century arch set into the west wall . It is thought by some writers to be the original chancel arch , but it has also been suggested that it was the entrance to a tower at the west end , which was said in 1833 to have once existed . 
 In 1868 , the chancel and north aisle walls were rebuilt , a porch was added on the south side and a vestry added on the north side in place of one within the north aisle that Thomas Jones had created in 1840 . The work was carried out by Henry Kennedy , the architect of the Diocese of Bangor . 
 Aberffraw became the principal court of the princes of Gwynedd in the early Middle Ages , and St Beuno 's may have been used as a royal chapel . It is still used for worship by the Church in Wales , and is one of four churches in the combined benefice of Trefdraeth with Aberffraw with Llangadwaladr with Cerrigceinwen . It is within the deanery of Malltraeth , the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor . As of 2013 , there is no incumbent priest in the parish . 
 = = Architecture and fittings = = 
 The church is built in Late Decorated style from rubble masonry dressed with sandstone , with rendering on the outside of the wall at the west end . Each wall has an external buttress in the centre . The gabled roofs above the nave and north aisle are made of slate with stone copings ; there is a stone bellcote with two bells at the west end between the two gables . Both bells are dated 1896 and inscribed with the name " Charles Carr @-@ Smethwick " ; they are hung one above the other rather than side by side . There is a stone cross on top of the bellcote and each gable . 
 St Beuno 's is entered through the porch in the south @-@ west corner of the nave , which leads to an inner doorway set in a pointed arch . The 19th @-@ century vestry is reached through a doorway in the north @-@ west corner of the church . The nave , which measures 30 by 16 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 by 4 @.@ 9 m ) , and the north aisle each have roofs of 6 bays with exposed rafters . The central arcade has four arches supported by octagonal piers . The two arches to the east are to the north side of the chancel , which is slightly smaller than the nave at 25 by 16 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 by 4 @.@ 9 m ) ; the other two are on the north side of the nave . The reset 12th @-@ century arch in the west wall is decorated with chevrons and the heads of 25 rams and bulls . There is no structural division between the nave and the chancel , but the south sanctuary ( at the east end of the chancel ) is raised by two steps and is marked out by a communion rail . The sanctuary floor is decorated with encaustic tiles , and panelling has been placed behind the altar as a reredos . The sanctuary at the east end of the north aisle also has two steps leading up to it , but its floor is wooden . The altar in the north sanctuary is from the early part of the 20th century , and has a copper panel depicting the Last Supper . 
 The windows in the north and south walls are set in square frames , and are either two or three lights ( sections of window separated by mullions ) decorated with tracery at the top ; they date from Kennedy 's work in 1868 . The window at the eastern end of the south wall has three lights with tracery , set in a pointed arch frame with a plain hoodmould around it . The two windows at the west end have single lights topped with tracery ; the windows at the east end have three lights , tracery and <unk> . Five of the windows , including the main east window , have stained glass by the London artist E. R. <unk> ; the east window in the north aisle , by C. A. Gibbs ( 1849 ) depicts the Good Samaritan . 
 The large octagonal font dates from the 13th century . The south side of the church has memorials from the 18th century to Henry Morris , Rector of <unk> , and his sons Richard and Owen , and also some 19th @-@ century memorials . A survey in 1937 by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire also noted a memorial to Hugh Wynne , who died in 1714 : he was Chancellor of Bangor Cathedral and rector of Aberffraw and Trefdraeth . Two copper collecting shovels with wooden handles were given to St Beuno 's in 1777 by Hugh Williams , the rector . 
 A survey of church plate within the Bangor diocese in 1906 recorded a plain silver chalice dated 1866 – 67 , and a silver paten with an inscription recording that it was a gift from Sir Arthur Owen in 1753 . The author commented that the nearby church of St Cadwaladr , Llangadwaladr had an " exactly similar dish " from the same donor . He also noted that church records from 1793 , 1801 and 1808 showed that a silver chalice belonging to the church had been lost , as had a pewter paten and flagon .

 The church is a Grade II * listed building – the second @-@ highest of the three grades of listing , designating " particularly important buildings of more than special interest " . It was given this status on 5 April 1971 , and has been listed because it is " a rare Anglesey example of a double @-@ naved church " . Enlargement by adding a second nave was not as common in Anglesey as elsewhere in Wales : St Beuno 's is one of three examples on the island ( the others being the old church of St Nidan , Llanidan and St Cwyfan 's , Llangwyfan ) . Cadw ( the Welsh Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales ) notes that while St Beuno 's is " largely of late Medieval character " , it retains " significant elements of a much earlier building including an unusually fine 12th @-@ century chancel arch . " It also comments that restorations have respected the " predominantly 16th @-@ century character " of the church . 
 Writing in 1846 , the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones said that " the whole edifice has been lately repaired , new @-@ roofed , and in various respects altered , so that some of its original features are now scarcely to be conjectured . " He compared the arches in the arcade to those of two other churches in the vicinity , St Cwyfan 's and St <unk> 's , and suggested they were both the work of the same architect . He also said that the doorway ( as he described the arch in the west wall ) was " richly ornamented " , and commented that it had been " most judiciously uncovered " during the 1840 repairs . 
 The Welsh politician and church historian Sir Stephen Glynne visited the church in September 1848 . He said that parts of the church were " late and poor " , the roofs were " poor and open " and the woodcarving was " inferior " . In 1849 , the writer Samuel Lewis described the church as an " ancient structure " , and noted in particular its two " spacious parallel aisles " . 
 A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey comments that the church has a long history and " is an interesting one to view " . A 2009 guide to the buildings of the region says that the church , which it describes as a " wide rectangle " , contains " some of the most significant Romanesque work on the island " . The memorial to Henry Morris is described as " beautifully lettered " .

 The course of Shickshinny Creek has been described as " sinuous " . The creek flows through rock formations consisting of sandstone and shale . It is situated in a gorge for a mile in its lower reaches . 
 The Pocono Beds are found near Shickshinny Creek , on Shickshinny Mountain . The Pocono Beds are found at the same level as the creek slightly north of Shickshinny . This rock formation consists of 200 feet ( 61 m ) of gray sandstone and brownish sandy shales . Approximately 400 feet ( 120 m ) below the Pocono Beds is a layer of rock approximately 50 feet ( 15 m ) thick and composed of pebbly sandstone . This may be the Mount Pleasant Formation . The Mauch Chunk Formation is also found in the watershed . Additionally , the Chemung Beds are found on parts of the creek .

In the middle reaches of the creek , the surficial geology mainly features bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale , alluvium , and a glacial or <unk> till known as Wisconsinan Till . Some Wisconsinan <unk> and alluvial terrace is also present near Koonsville . Some patches of Wisconsinan Bouldery Till and wetlands are also present . In its upper reaches , the creek is almost entirely dominated by Wisconsinan Till , bedrock , and some lakes . However , there is a patch of alluvial fan immediately north of Shickshinny Lake and some Wisconsinan Bouldery Till and Wisconsinan <unk> not far from the creek 's source . 
 The watershed of the tributary Little Shickshinny Creek is located in the Wyoming Coal Basin . Little Shickshinny Creek flows between Huntington Mountain and Lee Mountain . The Watsontown Axis crosses Shickshinny Creek .

However , there was some seepage and erosion . 
 Shickshinny Creek is the main source of flooding in Union Township and one of the main sources of flooding in Shickshinny . During the largest flood in Union Township , which occurred in June 1972 , the creek 's floodwaters reached a depth of 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) above <unk> Road in Koonsville .

 Shickshinny Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2 , 1979 . Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is <unk> . The origin of the creek 's name is unknown , but it may be an Anglicized corruption of the word <unk> @-@ <unk> , which is itself a rough translation of " fine creek " . 
 The first sawmill in Union Township , Luzerne County was built by Isaac <unk> in 1802 . The first gristmill in the township was built on the creek by George Gregory in 1804 . The Search brothers built a number of mills on Shickshinny Creek in 1858 . They included a sawmill , a flour mill , a plaster mill , and a brickyard and were collectively known as the Shickshinny Mills or Search 's Mills . 
 A turnpike was built through the Shickshinny Creek gap in 1877 . A number of bridges have been constructed over the creek . A masonry arch bridge carrying Glen Ave over the creek is 32 @.@ 2 feet ( 9 @.@ 8 m ) long . A concrete tee beam bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 239 over the creek was constructed in 1925 . It is 33 @.@ 1 feet ( 10 @.@ 1 m ) long and is situated in Union Township . A steel stringer / multi @-@ beam or girder bridge was built over the creek in 1930 and renovated in the 2010s . It is 46 @.@ 9 feet ( 14 @.@ 3 m ) long and carries Bartoli Lane . A bridge of the same type , but carrying State Route <unk> , was built in Union Township in 1940 . This bridge is 51 @.@ 8 feet ( 15 @.@ 8 m ) long . A concrete tee beam bridge carrying that road over the creek was built in 1965 . It is 35 @.@ 1 feet ( 10 @.@ 7 m ) long and is also situated in Union Township . 
 The Shickshinny Water Company used a stream in the Shickshinny Creek watershed as a water supply in the early 1900s . Little Shickshinny Creek has been used as a water supply for Shickshinny , as well as Mocanaqua . Agriculture has been a significant industry in the watershed in the past . The streams of the watershed also power small mills . 
 In 1996 , 3 @,@ 000 US gallons ( 11 @,@ 000 l ) of oil leaked from a pipe into Shickshinny Creek , but there was no major environmental damage .

 Padayappa is an engineer who returns to his village from Chennai to attend his sister 's wedding . His sister is engaged to their maternal uncle 's son Suryaprakash . During his stay , he comes across Vasundhara , and falls in love with her . However , shyness and fear of Neelambari , her landlady , prevents Vasundhara from initially expressing her feelings . In addition , Neelambari is Suryaprakash 's spoiled sister , who is madly in love with Padayappa . 
 Unexpectedly , Padayappa 's father 's foster brother demands a share in the family property . Padayappa 's father , the chieftain of the village , refuses to divide the property and instead gives the entire property to his foster brother . This forces Padayappa 's family to leave their home . Unable to bear this shock , Padayappa 's father dies . Suryaprakash then cancels his wedding with Padayappa 's sister and marries the daughter of Padayappa 's father 's foster brother , who now owns the property of Padayappa 's father . 
 Meanwhile , Padayappa discovers that a hill on his property is solid granite , which allows him to start a granite business , from which he becomes rich . He uses the money to help the poor in his village , and provide them jobs . As his business flourishes , his family is able to once again settle down . Padayappa assumes his father 's position as the village chieftain , and his sister gets married to one of the engineers who work in his company . When Neelambari learns about Padayappa 's love for Vasundhara , she becomes jealous of her , and her parents beg Padayappa 's widowed mother to allow Neelambari to marry Padayappa . However , to everyone 's surprise , Padayappa 's mother embarrasses Padayappa 's maternal uncle in front of the entire village when she agrees to a marriage proposal made by Vasundhara 's mother , her brother 's servant . Unable to bear the humiliation , Padayappa 's maternal uncle commits suicide . When Neelambari tries to kill Vasundhara by letting a bull loose on her , Padayappa saves her , after which the two marry . After the wedding , Neelambari locks herself in a room in Suryaprakash 's house , thinking only about Padayappa for 18 years . In between , Padayappa finds his father 's foster brother in trouble and was pulled out by a financier , from whom he had borrowed money on interest keeping the family house , and helps his father 's foster brother , who is suffering financially . As a result , Padayappa 's father 's foster brother becomes indebted to him and seeks Padayappa 's pardon for his misdeeds . Padayappa forgives him . 
 Neelambari plans her revenge on Padayappa , now a father of two daughters . Suryaprakash also has a son , Chandraprakash aka Chandru , who studies at the same college as Padayappa 's elder daughter , Anitha . Neelambari advises Chandru to make Anitha fall in love with him . At the same time , Padayappa plans to get Anitha married to his sister 's son . Neelambari , having made Chandru pretend to fall in love with Anitha , plans to humiliate Padayappa by making Anitha say that she does not wish to marry a groom of her parents ' choice and that she is in love with someone else . At the marriage ceremony , after Anitha does what Neelambari told her to do , Padayappa makes an oath to unite Anitha with her lover by the next <unk> day , or commit suicide . Padayappa discovers that Chandru really did fall in love with Anitha even though he was only initially pretending to do so on Neelambari 's advise . When Padayappa takes Chandru and Anitha to the temple to get married , Neelambari and Suryaprakash give chase to stop them . Suryaprakash is killed in a car accident during the chase . 
 Armed with a gun , Neelambari reaches the temple where Chandru and Anitha are married . In anger , she tries to kill Padayappa . However , Padayappa saves her life when he prevents a bull from attacking her , while at the same time dodging the bullets she fires at him . Rather than live with the humiliation of knowing she was unsuccessful in avenging her father 's death , as well as having her life saved by her enemy , Neelambari commits suicide , promising to take revenge on Padayappa in her next birth . Padayappa prays for her soul to be at peace and eventually attain salvation .

 In December 1997 , Rajinikanth announced his next project , which would have K. S. Ravikumar as director . The title of the film was announced as Padayappa in September 1998 . Though principal photography for the film was supposed to start in April 1998 , the FEFSI strike delayed the project . After the strike ended , Ravikumar still had to complete the film he was then working on , Natpukkaga ( 1998 ) , before he could begin Padayappa . After completing Natpukkaga in June 1998 , Padayappa was further delayed when Ravikumar agreed to quickly remake Natpukkaga in Telugu as <unk> <unk> ( 1999 ) . 
 Padayappa 's story was taken in part from the historical Tamil novel , <unk> Selvan , by Kalki Krishnamurthy . Neelambari 's character is based on Nandini , a vengeful character in the novel , and at one point , the makers were considering naming the film Neelambari . Due to fear of potential protests from fans of Rajinikanth , the original title , Padayappa was retained . The title Padayappa is a corruption of <unk> — a sobriquet for Lord Murugan and his six abodes . 
 = = = Cast and crew = = = 
 The film was produced by Rajinikanth 's personal assistants , K. Sathya Narayana , M. V. Krishna Rao , and H. Vittal Prasad under their production banner , Arunachala Cine Creations , along with P. L. Thenappan as co @-@ producer . Lalitha Mani was the choreographer for the song sequences . Jyothi Krishna , son of producer A. M. Rathnam , was involved in the development of the film 's script . 
 Simran and Meena were screened for the character of Neelambari before the role went to Ramya Krishnan , who had previously worked with Rajinikanth on <unk> ( 1985 ) . Simran was also considered for the role of Vasundhara , before the role went to Soundarya , who had earlier worked with Rajinikanth in Arunachalam ( 1997 ) . Actress Shalini was touted to play the role of Padayappa 's sister , but the role eventually went to Sithara . 
 The look of the older Padayappa — bearded , with sunglasses — is based on Rajinikanth 's look as the character Manik <unk> in <unk> ( 1995 ) ; Ganesh Nadar of Rediff commented , " Give Basha [ sic ] a cheroot and that 's Padayappa . " Sivaji Ganesan was cast as the protagonist 's father ; Padayappa was the last film he worked on before his death in 2001 , although <unk> <unk> ( 1999 ) was his final release . His character 's appearance , with a mutton @-@ chop moustache , is based on a similar role he played in Thevar Magan ( 1992 ) . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Padayappa launched production at the <unk> Kalyana Mandapam on 1 October 1998 . The film 's climax scene was one of the first to be shot , and was filmed in one take using two cameras . Around 2 @,@ 000 extras were used for the scene . The car that was used in the scene which introduced Neelambari in the film belonged to Ravikumar . Ravikumar used the newly purchased car in the film at Rajinikanth 's insistence . Filming also took place in Mysore . The <unk> @-@ based shop , D. V. Nehru wigs , supplied the wigs that were sported by Ganesan in the film . 
 " <unk> <unk> " was the last song sequence to be shot . For the sequence , Rajinikanth required Ravikumar to sport an outfit similar to Rajinikanth 's , and enact a small part in the song . Rajinikanth also selected the part of the song where Ravikumar would make his appearance . After reluctantly agreeing to do the part , a scene was filmed featuring Rajinikanth and Ravikumar . Rajinikanth said he felt the shot did not look right , and re @-@ takes for Ravikumar 's sequence were done . After the re @-@ takes were completed , Rajinikanth admitted that the first sequence was fine . When Ravikumar asked the cameraman why he had not told him earlier , the cameraman replied by saying that Rajinikanth wanted Ravikumar to do seven takes , to teach him a lesson for all the takes that Ravikumar had required of Rajinikanth . 
 = = Music = = 
 The film 's soundtrack and background score were composed by A. R. Rahman , with lyrics by Vairamuthu . The soundtrack was released through Star Music . Strips of herbal <unk> capsules were sold along with the film 's music cassettes . Before the film 's release , Rahman asked Ravikumar if the soundtrack could be released in August 1999 . Ravikumar informed Rahman that he had already discussed a release date with the press , and that Rahman would be blamed for any delay . To make the deadline , Rahman did a live re @-@ recording of both the soundtrack and score to finish them on time . 
 The credits for the song " Vetri Kodi Kattu " , sung by Palakkad Sreeram , initially went to Malaysia Vasudevan , who publicly stated that the credits for the song should have been attributed to Sreeram . Rahman requested the company who manufactured the audio cassettes to make the change . The song " Minsara Kanna " is based on the Vasantha raga , while " Vetri Kodi Kattu " is based on the Keeravani raga . " Minsara Kanna " established Srinivas as a leading singer in the film industry . 
 Singer Charulatha Mani , in her column for The Hindu , " A Raga 's journey " , called " Minsara Kanna " a " mind @-@ blowing piece " . G. Dhananjayan , in his book , The Best of Tamil Cinema , says the songs are " mass <unk> [ sic ] " , also citing that the songs contributed to the film 's success . Srikanth Srinivasa of the Deccan Herald wrote , " The music by Rehman [ sic ] , to Vairamuthu ’ s lyrics , sounds good while the movie is on , though whether without the presence of <unk> [ sic ] they would have , is another thing . " S. Shiva Kumar of The Times of India was more critical of the soundtrack , and called it " lacklustre " .

 Padayappa was released on 10 April 1999 on the eve of Tamil New Year 's day . This was the first Tamil film to be released worldwide without the involvement of distributors . It was also the first Tamil film to be released worldwide with 210 prints , and 700 @,@ 000 audio cassettes . The film 's rights in Japan were sold for US $ 50 @,@ 000 , which was the highest an Indian film fetched for commercial release in 1999 . Co @-@ producer Thenappan registered the film posters as a Class 34 trademark in 1998 , to be used for trademarking such items as <unk> , cigarettes , <unk> and tobacco , making it the first instance of brand extension in the Tamil film industry . The pre @-@ release business of the film 's overseas rights amounted to ₹ 30 million . According to an estimate by trade analyst Sreedhar Pillai , the value of the theatrical and satellite rights for Padayappa was approximately ₹ 20 million .

 Ananda Vikatan , in its original review of the film dated 25 April 1999 , wrote , " Original stamp of Rajni style can be seen in the film several times ... Ramya Krishnan has matched Rajni and created a royal path separately ... The film is exclusively made for Rajni 's fans ... , " and gave the film 41 marks out of 100 . The Deccan Herald gave the film a positive verdict , claiming that the " positive energy generated by this film is simply astounding " , and labelling Rajinikanth 's role as " terrific " . 
 Ganesh Nadar of Rediff also gave a positive review , praising Ramya Krishnan 's performance in the film , and said that she " does a fantastic job " , concluding , " ... if you are a Rajni fan , this film is vintage stuff . " P. C. <unk> and N. Ramakrishnan , in their book , Grand Brand Rajini , said , " Padayappa , in one way , stands testimony to Rajini 's life itself . " However , S. Shiva Kumar of The Times of India was critical of the film 's allusions to the actor 's political career , stating that the film was " more style than substance " .

 Padayappa was a box office success ; T. R.

According to The Tribune , it was the highest grossing Tamil film at that point of time before being surpassed by another Rajinikanth film , Chandramukhi ( 2005 ) . 
 The film had a theatrical run of 100 days in 86 theatre centres , and was dubbed into Telugu under the title Narasimha . The dubbed version was also a commercially successful venture , and had a theatrical run of 50 days in 49 theatres .

 Padayappa 's initial final cut lasted for 22 reels , which was considered too lengthy . Rather than cut the film , Rajinikanth suggested to Ravikumar to allot two intervals for the film . Ravikumar was wary of this idea , and went to actor Kamal Haasan for advice , since the initial final cut of Haasan 's Nayakan ( 1987 ) was also 22 reels . Using his prior experience on trimming Nayakan , Haasan was able to cut Padayappa down to 16 reels . When Kumudam 's reporter Kannan asked Rajinikanth to release the scenes which had been cut as Padayappa 's sequel , Rajinikanth immediately spoke to Ravikumar about the possibility , but was informed that those reels had been destroyed .

 With the success of Padayappa , Ramya Krishnan , who up to that point in time had only performed glamorous roles , showed her versatility as an actress . The character Neelambari reappears in Baba ( 2002 ) , where she spots Baba ( Rajinikanth ) but sees him in her mind 's eye in his Padayappa attire ; she asks him the time . Her brother drags her away , and berates her for still not overcoming Padayappa . Ramya Krishnan and Nasser reprised their roles in this film . The success of Padayappa led to a film being named after one of its songs , Minsara Kanna ( 1999 ) , starring Vijay with actress Kushboo appearing in a negative role similar to Ramya Krishnan 's in Padayappa ; another song from the film , Vetri Kodi Kattu , became the name of a 2000 film directed by Cheran . Ramya Krishnan played the role of Malini in the film Arumugam ( 2009 ) , in which her character was similar to Neelambari . Ramya Krishnan 's character in the television serial , <unk> , was also named Neelambari . Actress Priyamani , in an interview with <unk> Joy of The Times of India , stated her character in the Kannada film <unk> ( 2014 ) , is similar to Neelambari . In Chetan Bhagat 's novel , 2 States : The Story of My Marriage ( 2009 ) , when Krish Malhotra , the novel 's protagonist , travels to Nungambakkam by auto rickshaw , the auto rickshaw driver stops to worship a poster of Padayappa . 
 Some of the quotes from the film that became popular were : " En Vazhi Thani Vazhi . " ( English : My way is a unique way ) ; " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ’ ’ ( English : God is on our side ) ; " <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , Nalla <unk> <unk> <unk> " ( English : There is no history of a man who desires too much or a woman who gets too angry living well ) , " <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " ( English : One can gain nothing without working hard for it . Those which are gotten without <unk> will not be there forever ) ; and " Anger is the cause of all miseries . One should know how to control it , otherwise life will become miserable . " One of Rajinikanth 's climactic dialogues in the film — " En Vazhi Thani Vazhi " — was used as the title of a 2015 film directed by Shaji Kailas . It was also used as the title of a 2010 book on branding by Sridhar Ramanujam . Scenes from the film were parodied in various other films , notable of which are En <unk> <unk> <unk> ( 2001 ) , Annai <unk> ( 2003 ) , Sivaji ( 2007 ) . Vel ( 2007 ) , Siva <unk> Sakthi ( 2009 ) , Malai Malai ( 2009 ) , Vanakkam Chennai ( 2013 ) , and All in All Azhagu Raja ( 2013 ) . Padayappa was also parodied in the STAR Vijay comedy series Lollu Sabha , in an episode appropriately named <unk> . 
 To celebrate the 39th anniversary of Rajinikanth in the film industry , Digitally Inspired Media , a Chennai @-@ based digital agency , made 39 posters of some of his films , in which Padayappa was included . The posters feature one " punch " line from the film , a representative image , and the year of the film ’ s release . On Rajinikanth 's 64th birthday , an agency named Minimal Kollywood Posters designed posters of Rajinikanth 's films , in which the Minion characters from the Despicable Me franchise are dressed as Rajinikanth . The digital art was hand drawn on a digital pad by Gautham Raj . One of the posters depicted a minion sitting on a swing and dressed like Rajinikanth 's character in Padayappa , reminiscent of the scene where Padayappa went to Neelambari 's house but is not offered a seat even though Neelambari sits . Padayappa then uses his dupatta to pull down a swing from the ceiling , on which he sits . 
 = W.E.B. Du Bois Boyhood Homesite = 
 The W.E.B. Du Bois Boyhood Homesite ( or W.E.B. Du Bois Homesite ) is a National Historic Landmark in Great Barrington , Massachusetts , commemorating an important location in the life of African American intellectual and civil rights activist W.E.B. Du Bois ( 1868 – 1963 ) . The site contains foundational remnants of the home of Du Bois ' grandfather , where Du Bois lived for the first five years of his life . Du Bois was given the house in 1928 , and planned to renovate it , but was unable to do so . He sold it in 1954 and the house was torn down later that decade . The site is located on South Egremont Road ( state routes 23 and 41 ) , west of the junction with Route 71 . 
 Plans to develop the site as a memorial to Du Bois in the late 1960s were delayed due to local opposition . The site 's proponents attributed this in part to racism , but opinions were generally expressed as opposition to Du Bois ' more radical politics in later life . On May 11 , 1976 the site was declared a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places . The site was donated to the state in 1987 , and is administered by the University of Massachusetts , Amherst . 
 = = History = = 
 The Burghardt family ( of Dutch origin ) was present in the vicinity of Great Barrington , Massachusetts in colonial times , with documented ownership of land in the area from the 1740s . Tom Burghardt , an African @-@ American slave of the family with Dutch , English , African and Native American ancestry , probably earned his freedom for his participation in the American Revolutionary War . One of his descendants was Mary <unk> Burghardt , the mother of William Edward Burghardt Du Bois ( commonly referred to as W.E.B. Du Bois ) , born in 1868 . He became a leading African American intellectual , civil rights activist , and co @-@ founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) . 
 By the early 19th century , the " Black <unk> " had settled in the Egremont Plain area a few miles outside the center of Great Barrington . Du Bois ' birthplace was torn down around 1900 ) . When abandoned by Du Bois ' father , his mother moved with her infant son to the house of her parents , Othello Burghardt and his wife . In his 1928 article , " The House of the Black <unk> " , Du Bois described the house as " a delectable place — simple , square and low , with the great room of the fireplace , the flagged kitchen , half a step below , and the lower woodshed beyond . Steep strong stairs led to Sleep , while without was a brook , a well and a mighty elm . " 
 When Du Bois was five years old , his grandfather died , and his grandmother was forced to sell her house to settle debts . Du Bois ' mother moved the family into Great Barrington , where she struggled to support her son . A gifted student , Du Bois attended Fisk University on scholarship and with funds raised by members of his First Congregational Church in town . He completed a second bachelor 's degree at Harvard , as well as graduate work there and in Berlin , becoming the first African American to earn a doctorate at Harvard . He embarked on a distinguished career . Over the next decades , Du Bois periodically returned to Great Barrington . His children were born there ( in the homes of maternal relatives ) . He buried his son Burghardt ( 1887 – 89 ) and wife Nina ( d . 1950 ) there . In 1906 , he sent his young family to Great Barrington from where he was working in Atlanta , Georgia , after that year 's race riots . 
 Dubois expressed interest in purchasing his grandfather 's property on a visit to Great Barrington in 1925 . Three years later the brothers Joel and Arthur Spingarn , both civil rights activists involved in the NAACP , raised funds and purchased the old Burghardt homestead as a gift to Du Bois for his sixtieth birthday . Du Bois had plans to transform the property into a middle @-@ class summer retreat , but financial difficulties and his move in 1934 from New York City to Atlanta made it too difficult to accomplish that . Du Bois finally sold the property to a neighbor in 1954 , who had the house ( by then dilapidated ) torn down . 
 = = Conversion to memorial = = 
 In 1967 Walter Wilson and Edmund W. Gordon purchased two parcels of the old Burghardt lands , including the site of the Burghardt house , that form a U shape around a private residence , and announced the intention of converting the property into a park to commemorate Du Bois . This plan met with local opposition . Wilson and Gordon were both outsiders : Wilson was a controversial area real estate developer originally from Tennessee , and Gordon was from New York City . 
 Opposition was generally couched as criticism of Du Bois for his Communist sympathies and his renunciation of American citizenship for that of Ghana late in life . He died and was buried there . This was a period in the United States of growing controversy related to the Vietnam War and tumultuous social changes , and Du Bois ' position was resented by veterans ' organizations such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars . Wilson worked to explain Du Bois ' complex legacy and support for civil rights . He noted that Benedict Arnold was memorialized at Saratoga for his role in the 1777 Battles of Saratoga despite his later treason during the Revolution . Some supporters of the memorial suspected the FBI was behind the opposition ( Du Bois having been under its scrutiny because of his Communist views ) . The FBI was found to have considered planting a critical news story , but it concluded that local opposition was sufficient and did not intervene . Wilson felt that many opponents were motivated by racial issues , although no opposition was expressed in racial terms . This was a period in which the Civil Rights Movement had captured national attention , court decisions , and legislation that resulted in major changes . 
 Wilson and Gordon established the Du Bois Memorial Foundation to take ownership of the property . Funded in part by high @-@ profile donors including Ruby Dee , Ossie Davis , Sidney Poitier , and Norman Rockwell , the foundation received the property in September 1969 and dedicated it to Du Bois later that year . Local hostility continued ; the Berkshire Courier , while counseling against violence , suggested the site be vandalized . The town briefly threatened to prevent the dedication ceremony , suggesting there was a question as to whether the intended use of the site met local zoning regulations . 
 Over the next ten years , the Foundation did not develop the property in any significant way . Its members were reluctant to place permanent markers and displays on it for fear of vandalism or theft . In 1976 , a decade after Du Bois ' death , the site was designated a National Historic Landmark , and listed on the National Register of Historic Places . In 1983 the University of Massachusetts , Amherst , with the permission of the Foundation , began a series of archaeological excavations on the property , seeking to research the history of the " Black Burghardt " family . It already had amassed a collection of Du Bois papers . In 1987 the Foundation turned the property over to the state , with the university as its steward . The university paid for the construction of a parking area and the installation of interpretive signs . 
 = = Today = = 
 Since the late 20th century , the two parcels of land that form the 5 @-@ acre ( 2 @.@ 0 ha ) site have been planted with a thick grove of pine trees . A path leads north from the parking area to an informational kiosk about Du Bois and his life . From there another path leads west , into a small depression where a memorial boulder was installed with a commemorative plaque . Near the southwest corner of the property are the remnants of the original house 's stone foundation . Although Great Barrington residents have come to support the Du Bois legacy and have marked other places in town important in his life , the site has been the occasional target of vandalism . But this happens in many public places . The site is considered part of the Upper Housatonic Valley National Heritage Area . 
 = Pepper ( Inspector of Taxes ) v Hart = 
 Pepper ( Inspector of Taxes ) v Hart [ 1992 ] UKHL 3 , is a landmark decision of the House of Lords on the use of legislative history in statutory interpretation . The court established the principle that when primary legislation is ambiguous then , in certain circumstances , the court may refer to statements made in the House of Commons or House of Lords in an attempt to interpret the meaning of the legislation . Before this ruling , such an action would have been seen as a breach of parliamentary privilege . 
 John Hart and nine others were teachers at Malvern College who benefited from a " concessionary fee " scheme that allowed their children to be educated at the college for one fifth of the normal fees of a pupil . The Inland Revenue attempted to tax this benefit based on the Finance Act 1976 . There was a dispute over the correct interpretation of the Act . The Special Commissioners charged with assessing the tax found in favour of Hart , but both the High Court of Justice and Court of Appeal of England and Wales found in favour of the Inland Revenue . The case then went to the House of Lords , which , making use of statements in Parliament as recorded in Hansard , found in favour of Hart . Lord Mackay , dissenting , argued that Hansard should not be considered admissible evidence because of the time and expense involved in a lawyer having to look up every debate and discussion on a particular statute when giving legal advice or preparing a case . 
 The decision met with a mixed reception . While judges cautiously accepted the judgment , some legal academics argued that it violated rules of evidence , damaged the separation of powers between the executive and Parliament and caused additional expense in cases . The decision was subjected to an assault by Lord Steyn in his Hart Lecture , delivered on 16 May 2000 and titled " Pepper v Hart : A Re @-@ examination " , in which he disputed exactly what the House of Lords had meant by their decision and also attacked the logic and legal theory behind it . Since Lord Steyn 's lecture , several judicial decisions have limited the use of Pepper by the courts ; the result of these changes , according to Stefan Vogenauer , is that " the scope of Pepper v Hart has been reduced to such an extent that the ruling has almost become meaningless " . 
 = = Facts = = 
 Hart and nine others were teachers at Malvern College , where from 1983 to 1986 they took advantage of a " concessionary fee " scheme , which allowed their children to be educated at rates one fifth of those paid by other pupils . They disputed the amount of tax they had to pay under the 1976 Finance Act , Section 63 of which said that : 
 The cash equivalent of any benefit chargeable to tax ... is an amount equal to the cost equivalent of the benefit , less so much ( if any ) of it as is made good by the employee to those providing the benefit ... the cost of a benefit is the amount of any expense incurred in or in connection with its provision , and ( here and in those subsections ) includes a proper proportion of any expense " . 
 The Inland Revenue , attempting to tax this benefit , argued that the " cost " of the benefit meant an average of the cost of providing it ; if there were 100 pupils at a school that cost £ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 a year to run , the " cost " per pupil was £ 10 @,@ 000 . Hart and his fellow teachers disputed this and argued that it was instead marginal cost , saying that other than food , stationery , laundry and similar there was no cost to the school due to the children 's presence that would not be there already . The Special Commissioners ( an appellate body for income tax claims ) , ruling in favour of Hart , noted that not only was the school not full to capacity , with the teachers ' children having no impact on waiting lists , but that the " concessionary fee " covered all costs incurred by the school in the course of educating those particular pupils . It was found , however , that during debate on the Finance Act , ministers had made statements in the House of Commons which supported the idea that such " benefits " should be excluded from tax .

 Following the report of the Special Commissioners , the case was appealed to the High Court of Justice 's Chancery Division , where it was heard by Vinelott J. In his judgment ( issued 24 November 1989 ) , Vinelott decided , based on the act , that " any expense incurred " referred to the average cost of keeping pupils , not the costs of keeping the teachers ' children as pupils , reversing the Special Commissioners ' decision . The case was then heard by the Court of Appeal , which issued its judgment on 13 November 1990 . The three judges confirmed Vinelott 's decision , ignoring the Hansard element of the case and confirming that , based on the Act 's text , " any expense incurred " referred to the average cost . 
 = = = House of Lords = = = 
 Again appealed , the case came before a 5 @-@ judge panel of the House of Lords . They initially agreed with the Court of Appeal by a 4 – 1 majority . At the end of the preliminary hearing , the judges became aware that , during the Finance Act 's committee stage , Financial Secretary to the Treasury Robert Sheldon remarked ( in response to a question about places for the children of teachers at fee @-@ paying schools ) " The removal of clause 54 ( 4 ) will affect the position of a child of one of the teachers at the child 's school because now the benefit will be assessed on the cost to the employer , which would be very small indeed in this case " , implying that the " expense " is meant to be the cost to the school , not the average cost of having a pupil there . As a result of this discovery , the House of Lords chose to reconvene as a 7 @-@ judge panel , consisting of Lord Mackay , Lord Keith , Lord Bridge , Lord Griffiths , Lord <unk> , Lord Oliver and Lord Browne @-@ Wilkinson . 
 The court reconvened and issued its judgment on 26 November 1992 , read by Browne @-@ Wilkinson . Browne @-@ Wilkinson found in favour of Hart , and on the subject of Hansard wrote that : 
 My Lords , I have come to the conclusion that , as a matter of law , there are sound reasons for making a limited modification to the existing rule [ that Hansard may not be used ] unless there are constitutional or practical reasons which outweigh them . In my judgment , subject to the questions of the privileges of the House of Commons , reference to Parliamentary material should be permitted as an aid to the construction of legislation which is ambiguous or obscure or the literal meaning of which leads to an absurdity . Even in such cases references in court to Parliamentary material should only be permitted where such material clearly discloses the mischief aimed at or the legislative intention lying behind the ambiguous or obscure words . In the case of statements made in Parliament , as at present advised I cannot foresee that any statement other than the statement of the Minister or other promoter of the Bill is likely to meet these criteria . 
 In prior cases , the fear had been expressed that using parliamentary debates as evidence in court could violate parliamentary privilege , under Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1688 ( since using parliamentary debates as evidence would involve discussing what went on in Parliament within the courts ) . Browne @-@ Wilkinson held that : 
 In my judgment , the plain meaning of article 9 , viewed against the historical background in which it was enacted , was to ensure that Members of Parliament were not subjected to any penalty , civil or criminal for what they said and were able , contrary to the previous assertions of the Stuart monarchy , to discuss what they , as opposed to the monarch , chose to have discussed . Relaxation of the rule will not involve the courts in criticising what is said in Parliament . The purpose of looking at Hansard will not be to construe the words used by the Minister but to give effect to the words used so long as they are clear . Far from questioning the independence of Parliament and its debates , the courts would be giving effect to what is said and done there . 
 Agreeing with Browne @-@ Wilkinson , Lord Griffiths also wrote , in regards to legislative interpretation , that : 
 The days have long passed when the courts adopted a strict constructionist view of interpretation which required them to adopt the literal meaning of the language . The courts now adopt a purposive approach which seeks to give effect to the true purpose of legislation and are prepared to look at much extraneous material that bears upon the background against which the legislation was enacted . 
 Mackay , in his dissenting judgment , came to the same conclusion as the rest of the House on the interpretation of the Finance Act , but without the use of Hansard . Although he agreed that such a use would not violate Article 9 , he argued that it was not appropriate : 
 I believe that practically every question of statutory construction that comes before the courts will involve an argument that the case [ could use Hansard ] . It follows that the parties ' legal advisors will require to study Hansard in practically every such case to see whether or not there is any help to be gained from it . I believe this is an objection of real substance . It is a practical objection not one of principle ... such an approach appears to me to involve the possibility at least of an immense increase in the cost of litigation in which statutory construction is involved . 
 For several judges , the use of Sheldon 's statement in Parliament was a deciding factor . In the initial hearing , Lords Bridge , Browne @-@ Wilkinson and Oliver were all in favour of dismissing Hart 's case , later changing their mind with the new evidence available to them . Lord Griffiths , on the other hand , was not swayed by the use of Sheldon 's statement ; he wrote that " I should myself have construed the section in favour of the taxpayer without recourse to Hansard " .

 Before Pepper , it was impossible to use Parliamentary discussions as evidence in court cases ; William Blackstone wrote in the 18th century that to allow judicial review of " unreasonable " legislation was to " set the judicial power above that of the legislature , which would be subversive of all government " . Historically , the courts had been more lenient ; while this suggestion first appears in the 14th century , with the intention that legislation was best interpreted by those who had written it , the principle was not strongly followed . In the 1678 case of Ash v <unk> , Lord Nottingham chose to refer to the parliamentary history of the Statute of Frauds , and in Millar v Taylor , in 1769 , the first case to explicitly state this principle ( as " The sense and meaning of an Act of Parliament must be collected from what it says when passed into law , and not from the history of changes it underwent in the House where it took its rise " ) , the court chose to depart from it . The principle was most used during the 19th and 20th centuries , with a noted example being Beswick v Beswick , where Lord Reid maintained that it would be inconvenient and expensive for lawyers to have to refer to Hansard when preparing cases . Both the English and Scottish Law Commissions agreed with the rule in their 1969 Report on the Interpretation of Statutes . 
 During the late 20th century there was a gradual " retreat " from this rule ; in <unk> Investments Ltd v Norwich Corporation , the courts allowed Hansard material to be submitted to determine the purpose of legislation ( but not to interpret the statute ) , and in Pickstone v Freemans plc , it was allowed to assist in the understanding of delegated legislation . A noted attack on the rule was made by Lord Denning in Davis v Johnson , where he said that asserting that the courts could not use Hansard was similar to saying that the judges " should grope about in the dark for the meaning of an Act without switching on the light . In some cases Parliament is assured in the most explicit terms what the effect of a statute will be . It is on that footing that members assent to the clause being agreed to . It is on that understanding that an amendment is not pressed . In such cases I think the court should be able to look at the proceedings . " Despite these exceptions , the courts regularly maintained that it was not possible to use internal Parliamentary discussions as an aid to legislative interpretation . The result of Pepper was a reversal of that rule ; a court could use internal Parliamentary discussions where it was relevant to " the very point in question in the litigation " , where a piece of legislation is " ambiguous or obscure , or the literal meaning of which leads to an absurdity " , with the intention being to understand " the mischief aimed at or the legislative intention lying behind the ambiguous or obscure words " . 
 The decision in Pepper has been linked to a positive move in statutory interpretation that had been proceeding since the end of the Second World War . Previously , the dominant approach was that of the literal rule , supplemented by the golden and mischief rules ( that interpretations should not be made if they were to lead to absurdity , and that interpretations should take into account the intention behind the statute ) . These approaches all limited the amount of material which could be used by a judge when interpreting the actions of Parliament . Following the 1969 Law Commission report The Interpretation of Statutes , British courts began to use a more purposive approach , which directed that when interpreting a statute they should examine the purpose behind it , rather than simply using the text of the statute itself . In effect , this widened the amount of material judges could use , including not only the statute but reports made by government bodies , the Law Commission and Royal Commissions . The impact of Pepper was to include Hansard in this list of acceptable material , not only to establish the overall purpose of an act but to define what was meant by a particular provision . 
 = = = In other jurisdictions = = = 
 In other common law jurisdictions , interpretation for similar situations is significantly different . In Canada , for example , four different interpretative doctrines are used in understanding taxation laws ; " strict construction , purposive interpretation , the plain meaning rule , and the words @-@ in @-@ total @-@ context approach " . In <unk> Investments Limited v The Queen , the Supreme Court of Canada decided to reject a strict approach and instead use the rule that " the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act , the object of the Act , and the intention of Parliament " . Since then , however , both the purposive and plain meaning approaches have been used . Academics have rejected the idea that legislative history should be an aid to statutory interpretation , arguing , " It would introduce intolerable uncertainty ... if clear language in a detailed provision of [ an ] Act were to be qualified by unexpressed exceptions derived from a court 's view of the object and purpose of the provision " , and that it violates the rule of law , which requires that laws be performable . The average citizen does not have access to the legislative history of an Act , which under the Pepper approach could very well change the meaning of the statute completely . 
 United States courts regularly use such interpretation , partially because there are significant differences between the British and American legislative systems . In the United States , legislation is regularly subject to negotiation and alteration after being introduced to Congress , and so it is in the courts ' interest to look at the particular Act 's history when interpreting it . The range of sources accepted is " richer and more diverse " , with individual Senators and Representatives and members of the Executive called to give evidence all valid . In the Supreme Court of the United States , 145 decisions ( approximately 20 percent of the decisions given ) between 1996 and 2005 reference legislative history . In the House of Lords and Supreme Court of the United Kingdom , only 9 @.@ 8 percent of decisions use legislative history as a tool . It is noted , however , that the House of Lords and Supreme Court rely on statutes less often than the United States equivalent . Michael Healy , writing in the Stanford Journal of International Law , notes that the use of statutory interpretation in the US Supreme Court combined with the uncertainty over what approach the court will take means lawyers have to write extremely broad arguments , increasing the cost of litigation — a concern raised in Pepper . 
 = = = Approval = = = 
 J. C. Jenkins , Second Parliamentary Counsel at the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel , has expressed some approval at the decision . Firstly , he claims that it will significantly change the way legislation is drafted . Prior to Pepper , draftsmanship was a " time consuming " and " frustrating rather than enlightening " business . There are risks of " excessive detail , over @-@ elaboration , verbosity , prolixity , iteration , tedious repetition " , and so a draftsman avoids directly dealing with every single problem , instead following the rule set out by the Renton Committee to ensure that " sufficient certainty is obtained for a fair @-@ minded and reasonable reader to be in no doubt what is intended , it being assumed that no one would take entirely perverse points against the draft , or that such points would be brushed aside by the court " . The draftsman may be in conflict with a government official who wishes to be overly specific , where this general rule renders their concerns moot ; in such situations , the ability to include a passage of a Minister 's speech as a way to ensure that the courts will interpret legislation in a specific way may clear up any doubts they feel . As such , Jenkins feels that Pepper may make the jobs of parliamentary draftsmen much easier . Although one academic called Pepper a " long overdue " decision from " which there is no turning back " , the overall reaction was a negative one . The decision can be interpreted as promoting legislative supremacy , a key point in a system where parliamentary sovereignty is confirmed . 
 = = = Criticism = = = 
 The House of Lords ' statement on parliamentary privilege was assessed by the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege , which recommended that Parliament not counter the decision in Pepper v Hart , but cautioned that this should not lead to any further weakening of parliamentary privilege . However , academics widely condemned the decision and the thinking behind it . Academic Aileen Kavanagh questioned the logic used ; the House of Lords was essentially saying that , where a minister has made a statement about an act 's intent that was not questioned by Parliament , that statement can be used as evidence . However , there are many reasons why Members of Parliament might not question a statement , and this does not necessarily indicate that they approve of it ; in the case of the Finance Act , for example , it could simply be that as the statement was not going to be added to the statute , they found no reason to actively oppose it . At the same time , different Members of Parliament may approve of a statutory provision for different reasons . The fact that a minister gives certain reasons for including a provision does not necessarily indicate that Parliament agrees ; only that Parliament also feels , for whatever reason , that the provision should be included . The decision also raises questions about the separation of powers in the United Kingdom ; it has been consistently maintained that it is Parliament , not the executive , which passes legislation . If one accepts that statements by the executive can allow them to specify the meaning of particular laws without formally including them in statutes where they can be approved by Parliament , it violates this separation of powers , allowing the executive to make law . 
 With these issues , Kavanagh argues that there are likely to be consequences . Firstly , if judges replace the text of a statute with the meaning given to it by a single minister in Parliament , there is a risk that they will attribute a meaning to it which was not supported by the MPs ; interpretations , based on the views of ministers , are more likely to reflect the executive 's intention than that of Parliament . Kavanagh also suggests that it could impact on the actions of ministers ; rather than attempting to specify law through the difficult route of placing it in legislation , they can simply make a statement within Parliament about the legislation 's intent . Lord Mackay 's worry that this would increase the cost of litigation was also considered ; under Pepper , every lawyer must go through every word said in both Houses of Parliament and in the various committees to ensure that they are giving the best advice to their client . Academics have also expressed worry about the reliability of Hansard as a source ; " the debate on the Bill is a battle of wits often carried out under extreme pressure and excitement where much more than the passage of this Bill may be at stake . The Ministers supporting it cannot be expected to act as if they were under oath in a court of law " . 
 The decision also contradicted previous precedent as to the nature of evidence . John Baker notes that it violates strong rules which exclude the use of written evidence to interpret a document , unless the evidence was found in said document . Baker also argued that ministerial statements should not be used as evidence because they are irrelevant ; " no individual member of Parliament is in a position to state what that intention is or to speak for the silent majority . Parliament acts as a corporate body and the only expression of its common intention is the text to which the Queen and both Houses have given their unqualified assent . What passes in one House is not formally known to the other " . An individual MP 's statements , minister or not , may be based on a false understanding of the legal issues ; MPs regularly vote for proposals having disagreed with the statements of the spokesman simply because they like the proposal itself . 
 J. C. Jenkins , who interprets Pepper as making the jobs of parliamentary draftsmen much easier in some ways , also foresees it as making the job more difficult . Because of the added resources courts can draw on , there is now increased pressure to produce statutes which will not be interpreted in the wrong way . Departments sponsoring legislation normally prepare briefings for their ministers when talking in Parliament ; draftsmen may now be expected to vet these , a time @-@ consuming process . The draftsmen may also have to look at material produced by these departments other than the statutes , as it may be discussed in court ; in Pepper , Lord Browne @-@ Wilkinson considered a press release produced by the Inland Revenue . The decision also changes parliamentary practice . Under previous practice , if a minister was asked a question publicly and could not immediately reply with an answer , or publicly made a statement that later turned out to be incorrect , he would privately write a letter explaining or correcting himself . As a result of Pepper , such private replies may have to be made publicly . In addition , Members of Parliament are more aware that their statements , and those statements they induct Ministers to make , may be looked at by the courts . As a result , these statements and inducements may be structured differently , and MPs may be more concerned that their issues be dealt with " at length and on the record " , making parliamentary proceedings " more formal , more cluttered , and more protracted " . 
 = = = Interpretation and later development = = = 
 There has been a dispute over the interpretation of the House of Lords ' intent in regards to the use of Hansard in court , sparked by Lord Steyn 's Hart Lecture on 16 May 2000 , titled " Pepper v Hart : A Re @-@ examination " . Steyn suggested that Pepper v Hart was limited to " an estoppel argument " , and Hansard 's use in court should " be confined to the admission against the executive of categorical assurances given by ministers to Parliament " ; essentially , that Hansard should only be used if it the purpose is to establish that ministers made certain assurances to Parliament , with the intent being to prevent the executive going back on its promises . Stefan Vogenauer disagrees that this was the House of Lords ' intent in Pepper , pointing out that Hart 's counsel had , during proceedings , made an argument along the lines of estoppel — one the Lords had completely ignored when making their decision . 
 The courts ' cautiously optimistic acceptance of Pepper , which included an attempt to include it in the House of Lords ' Practice Directions , soon began to wane . Although the lower courts applied the decision and allowed the use of Hansard , and the Lords itself initially followed it in R v Warwickshire County Council , ex parte Johnson , several objections and limits were expressed in later obiter dicta and ratio decidendi . The first judicial complaints were voiced in 1997 by Lord Hoffmann in The Intolerable Wrestle with Words and Meanings , where he criticised the increased expense and drop in efficiency which it created . In a speech to the Chancery Bar Lord Millett calling the judgment " a regrettable decision " that " was not only misguided in practical terms , it was in my view contrary to principle " , saying that : 
 Lord Mackay of <unk> dissented on practical grounds . He has been proved to be entirely right . The decision has added enormously to the costs of civil litigation . Whenever a statute falls to be construed , no counsel can afford to ignore its parliamentary history . The extra research is time consuming and costly , and wholly unproductive . Rather than see his time wasted , Counsel often feels obliged to place the fruits of his research before the court , thus prolonging the hearing at still more expense . Yet in the seven years since the decision , I am aware of no case where the material has been determinative , not even in Pepper v. Hart itself . 
 The courts immediately began to " whittle down " the precedent set by Pepper . The first direct attack came through Massey v <unk> , where the Court of Appeal held that Hansard could not be used in criminal law cases , because of " the principle that penal statutes are to be narrowly construed intervenes to resolve any ambiguity without resort to Hansard " . 
 In Robinson v Secretary of State for Northern Ireland , Lords Hobhouse , Hoffmann and Millett said that Mackay , with his dissenting judgment , had " turned out to be the better prophet " , with large amounts of inefficiency and expense associated with Pepper . In the Spath Holme judicial review case , Lords Bingham , Hope and Hutton held that Hansard could only be used in pursuit of " ascertaining the meaning of a particular word or phrase " , rather than simply where a piece of legislation is " ambiguous or obscure , or the literal meaning of which leads to an absurdity " . In McDonnell , the Lords further limited the use of Hansard , saying it could not be used to overrule precedent set before courts were able to reference it , except in exceptional circumstances . Wilson and others v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry , the first case involving Hansard after the Human Rights Act 1998 put further limits on its use ; ministerial statements made in Parliament can not be treated as sources of law , only as supporting evidence . This " retreat " from Pepper was resisted in the Court of Appeal , primarily by Lord Phillips , who praised the decision following Steyn 's lecture in 2000 , but has been repeatedly emphasised in the House of Lords and Supreme Court of the United Kingdom . As a result of these changes , Stefan Vogenauer has said that " the scope of Pepper v Hart has been reduced to such an extent that the ruling has almost become meaningless " . 
 Despite the judicial criticism and limits placed on Pepper , references to Hansard have apparently increased since the beginning of the 21st century . It is also noted that the most recent generation of House of Lords and Supreme Court judges have been willing to regularly reference legislative history in their arguments . In Harding v <unk> , for example , three Law Lords were willing to apply Pepper , even Lord Hoffmann who had previously voiced concerns . Lord Carswell noted that Pepper had been " out of judicial favour in recent years " , but added that legislative history was " perhaps especially [ useful ] as a confirmatory aid " .

 = Family of Gediminas = 
 The family of Gediminas is a group of family members of Gediminas , Grand Duke of Lithuania ( ca . 1275 – 1341 ) , who interacted in the 14th century . The family included the siblings , children , and grandchildren of the Grand Duke and played the pivotal role in the history of Lithuania for the period as the Lithuanian nobility had not yet acquired its influence . Gediminas was also the forefather of the Gediminid dynasty , which ruled the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from 1310s or 1280s to 1572 . 
 Gediminas ' origins are unclear , but recent research suggests that Skalmantas , an otherwise unknown historical figure , was Gediminas ' grandfather or father and could be considered the dynasty 's founder . Because none of his brothers or sisters had known heirs , Gediminas , who sired at least twelve children , had the advantage in establishing sovereignty over his siblings . Known for his diplomatic skills , Gediminas arranged his children 's marriages to suit the goals of his foreign policy : his sons consolidated Lithuanian power within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania , while his daughters established or strengthened alliances with the rulers of areas in modern @-@ day Russia , Ukraine and Poland . 
 The relationships among Gediminas ' children were generally harmonious , with the notable exception of Jaunutis , who was deposed in 1345 by his brothers Algirdas and Kęstutis . These two brothers went on to provide a celebrated example of peaceful power @-@ sharing . However , Gediminas ' many grandchildren and their descendants engaged in power struggles that continued well into the 15th century . Gediminas ' grandchildren converted Lithuania to Christianity and inaugurated the first personal union with Poland . 
 = = Origins = = 
 Because written sources of the era are scarce , Gediminas ' ancestry , early life , and assumption of the title of Grand Duke in ca . 1316 are obscure and continue to be the subject of scholarly debate . Various theories have claimed that Gediminas was either his predecessor Grand Duke Vytenis ' son , his brother , his cousin , or his <unk> . For several centuries only two versions of his origins circulated . Chronicles — written long after Gediminas ' death by the Teutonic Knights , a long @-@ standing enemy of Lithuania — claimed that Gediminas was a <unk> to Vytenis ; according to these chronicles , Gediminas killed his master and assumed the throne . Another version introduced in the Lithuanian Chronicles , which also appeared long after Gediminas ' death , proclaimed that Gediminas was Vytenis ' son . However , the two men were almost the same age , making this relationship unlikely . In 1868 , a letter issued by the Council of Riga in 1323 was published that contained a small note mentioning Vytenis as " the brother and predecessor " of Gediminas . After the letter came to light , textbooks almost universally represented Vytenis and Gediminas as brothers . However , historian Tomas Baranauskas believes the word " brother " has been interpreted too literally , and that the two were in fact cousins . 
 Grand Duke Vytenis ' origins are relatively well @-@ established ; he was the son of Butvydas , who was Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1291 to 1295 . No consensus exists about the identity of Butvydas ' father . While some genealogies give Traidenis as the ancestor , this has been described as unlikely : the later marriage of Gediminas ' daughter Eufemija and Traidenis ' great @-@ grandson Boleslaw @-@ Yuri would have violated canon law , since the two would have been related by blood , and this violation would likely have been noticed by the pope . 
 Recent research indicates that Gediminids ' ancestor may have been Skalmantas . In 1974 historian Jerzy <unk> noted that <unk> , a poem from the end of the 14th century , contains a line in which two sons of Algirdas name their ancestors : " We are two brothers – sons of Algirdas , and grandsons of Gediminas , and great @-@ grandsons of Skalmantas . " This discovery led to the belief that Skalmantas was the long @-@ sought ancestor of the Gediminids . <unk> posited that the poem skipped the generation represented by Butvydas , and jumped back to the unknown ancestor . Baranauskas disagrees , believing Skalmantas was Butvydas ' brother rather than his father , and that Vytenis and Gediminas were therefore cousins . 
 = = Siblings = = 
 It is known that Gediminas , born about 1275 , had one sister ( or possibly two , see below for the wife of Andrei of Kozelsk ) and several brothers : Vainius , Fiodor of Kiev , possibly Vytenis , and possibly Margiris . If Vytenis , who was Grand Duke of Lithuania from about 1295 to 1315 , was indeed Gediminas ' brother , he was probably the eldest son . Historians recognize one son of Grand Duke Vytenis , <unk> , who may have died before his father . In 1310 <unk> , already a mature man , led an army to nearby Livonia in modern @-@ day Latvia and Estonia . After Vytenis died in about 1315 , Gediminas became the Grand Duke . There are no sources indicating that Vytenis ' brothers or other family members advanced competing claims . 
 Vainius first appears in written sources in 1324 . In 1326 , as Duke of Polatsk , he signed a treaty with the Livonian Order and Novgorod . Scholars place his death sometime between 1338 and 1342 . Vainius ' only known son , <unk> , died in 1342 during a battle with the Livonian Order . 
 Fiodor , whose relationship to Gediminas was not established until the 20th century , was the longest @-@ lived brother , surviving until at least 1362 . In about 1325 , with help from Gediminas , he became a Duke of Kiev . Fiodor was baptized in the Eastern Orthodox rite and his pagan name is unknown . Kiev was still under the influence of the Golden Horde , and Fiodor acknowledged fealty to the Horde 's Khan . This subordination lasted until 1363 , when Gediminas ' son Algirdas soundly defeated the Horde in the Battle of Blue Waters . Scholarly opinion had long considered Fiodor a Rurikid , rather than a Lithuanian , because of his Christian name . In 1916 , however , a list of property belonging to <unk> , a deceased Metropolitan of Moscow , and compiled in the 1330s , was published ; among the items listed were two silver cups gifted by " Fiodor , brother of Gediminas " . 
 Margiris , the defender of <unk> , is often suggested as the most likely candidate for the fourth brother . The chronicles of Hermann de <unk> mention that in 1329 Gediminas and two of his brothers raided Livonia . By that time Vytenis was already dead and Fiodor was probably occupied with establishing himself in Kiev . One of these two brothers must then have been Vainius ; the identity of the other still puzzles historians . Alvydas Nikžentaitis suggests that he was Margiris because sources attest to his high status and wealth . Sources mention one son of Margiris , who was captured by the Teutonic Knights soon after his father 's suicide in 1336 and did not return . 
 The only direct written mention of Gediminas ' sister is a legend describing the murder of two Franciscan friars who came to Vilnius to spread Christianity . This legend was first presented in Chronica XXIV <unk> , a chronicle written before 1369 . The events probably took place around 1340 , and some eyewitnesses could still have been alive when the chronicle was written . According to the legend Friar Ulrich 's preaching angered townspeople . He and his companion , Martin , were seized and brought before Gediminas , who ordered the friars killed . Ulrich was tortured and his body tossed into a river . Martin 's body was rescued by Gediminas ' sister , an Orthodox nun . She buried Martin at the monastery where she lived . The legend was possibly as the basis for the legend of 14 Franciscan martyrs of Vilnius , first recorded in the Bychowiec Chronicle . 
 = = Wives = = 
 It is uncertain how many wives Gediminas had . The Bychowiec Chronicle mentions three wives : Vida from Courland ; Olga from Smolensk ; and <unk> from Polotsk , who was Eastern Orthodox and died in 1344 or 1345 . Most modern historians and reference works say Gediminas ' wife was <unk> , dismissing Vida and Olga as fictitious , since no sources other than this chronicle mention the other two wives . The historian S. C. Rowell argues that Gediminas ' wife was a local pagan duchess , on the grounds that his marriage to a princess from a neighboring land would have been noted in other contemporary sources , and that the reliability of the Bychowiec Chronicle has been questioned . 
 An argument has been advanced that Gediminas had two wives , one pagan and another Orthodox . This case is supported only by the <unk> <unk> , a late @-@ 15th century chronicle , mentioning Narimantas as half @-@ brother to Algirdas . Other historians support this claim by arguing this would explain Gediminas ' otherwise mysterious designation of a middle son , Jaunutis , as his succession would be understandable if Jaunutis were the first @-@ born son of Gediminas and a second wife . 
 = = Children and grandchildren = = 
 Because none of Gediminas ' siblings had strong heirs , Gediminas and his children were in a favorable position to assume and consolidate power in the Grand Duchy . Gediminas had at least five daughters and seven sons , whose shrewd marriages helped to consolidate and expand the Grand Duchy 's influence to areas east and west of Lithuania . Those marriages speak to Gediminas ' diplomatic talent in building alliances with the neighboring states that shared his goals to destroy the Teutonic Order and contain the growing power of Moscow and Poland . The marriages of Gediminas ' sons helped to consolidate the dynasty 's power over various territories already within the Grand Duchy , while his daughters ' and granddaughters ' marriages worked to strengthen Lithuanian relationships with neighboring powers . 
 = = = Daughters = = = 
 In 1320 Maria married Dmitri of Tver , ruler of a Russian principality . The marriage took place soon after Mikhail Yaroslavich , Dmitri 's father , was killed ; his sons were searching for strong allies against Yury of Moscow , their principal competitor for the throne of Vladimir and All Rus ' . After 1327 Lithuania began to supplant Tver as Moscow 's chief rival for supremacy in the Rus ' . When Tver sought to rival Moscow , it needed an alliance with Lithuania . Dmitri was killed in 1325 and Maria never remarried . Maria 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , Alexander I , nevertheless maintained friendly relationships with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and his daughter Uliana married Algirdas , the son of Gediminas , who continued the Gediminid line . The cooperation between Lithuania and Tver lasted well into the 15th century . 
 Aldona ( baptized as Ona or Anna ; her pagan name is known only from the writings of the 16th century chronicler Maciej Stryjkowski ) married Casimir III of Poland , son of Władysław I of Poland , when he was 15 or 16 years old . The marriage took place on either 30 April or 16 October 1325 , and was a purely political maneuver to strengthen the Polish – Lithuanian coalition against the Teutonic Knights ( an alliance foreshadowing the Union of Krewo in 1385 and the Union of Lublin in 1569 , with the latter resulting in a stable and powerful new state , the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth ) . This preliminary coalition was short @-@ lived , collapsing in about 1330 , but there is no evidence of military conflict between Poland and Lithuania while Aldona was alive . 
 The marriage into the Lithuanian dynasty that had ruled since about 1289 might have lent legitimacy to the rule of Władysław I of the Piast dynasty , who was crowned in 1320 , replacing the Přemyslid dynasty . But Aldona died unexpectedly at the end of May 1339 and was buried in Kraków . Aldona had two daughters : <unk> ( d . 1357 ) married Louis VI the Roman , the son of Louis IV , Holy Roman Emperor , and Elisabeth ( d . 1361 ) married Duke Bogislaw V of Pomerania , an area in modern @-@ day Germany and Poland . Elisabeth 's daughter , Elizabeth of Pomerania , was the fourth wife of Charles IV , Holy Roman Emperor . 
 Gediminas ' daughter Elzbieta married Wacław of Płock , one of the dukes of Masovia in modern @-@ day eastern Poland . Her second name is recorded in writings by Maciej Stryjkowski as <unk> and Teodor <unk> as Damila . It has been suggested these names are misread versions of <unk> , a name derived from Daniel . Another interpretation is that historians confused <unk> of Lithuania , daughter of Kęstutis , with Elzbieta . As an alliance , the marriage was significant because passages to and from western Europe had to pass through Masovia ; it can be seen as an attempt to revive Grand Duke Traidenis ' and his daughter <unk> 's link with Masovia in the 1270s . The marriage 's importance is attested by Elzbieta 's dowry : 720 Kraków silver marks and nine marks of gold – three times more than an ordinary recorded dowry of the time . This marriage probably took place about 1316 , when Gediminas supported Wacław during a civil war in the divided Duchy of Masovia . After Wacław 's death in 1336 , Elzbieta managed her own wealth . She is mentioned for the last time in 1361 , when her brother Kęstutis escaped from Marienburg and sought refuge at his sister 's house ; historians put her date of death at around 1364 . In 1337 Elzbieta 's daughter Anna , first mentioned in late 1323 , married Henry of <unk> , in modern @-@ day western Poland . Her son Bolesław III or <unk> died without a male heir in 1351 and his land was divided among other dukes . 
 Eufemija ( also known as Marija , <unk> , and Anka ) married Bolesław Jerzy II of Galicia , in modern @-@ day Ukraine , in 1331 . The marriage was engineered in 1323 when the brothers Lev and Andrew of Galicia were slain without leaving heirs . Instead of replacing them with his own son Liubartas and risking a war with Poland , Gediminas forged a compromise with Władysław I of Poland . Both parties agreed to install Bolesław , cousin of Władysław I and nephew of Gediminas ' son @-@ in @-@ law Wacław of Płock , with the marriage to take place later . Bolesław at the time was fourteen years old . In this way the war for control of Galicia – Volhynia was postponed until after Bolesław 's poisoning in 1340 ; control of the area was not stabilized until 1370 . According to Teodor <unk> , Eufemija was drowned beneath the ice of the Vistula River on 5 February 1342 in order to keep her out of the succession disputes . 
 <unk> was baptized as Anastasia in order to marry Simeon of Russia in 1333 ; he became Grand Prince of Moscow in 1341 . There is no direct evidence that she was a daughter of Gediminas , but because the marriage was high @-@ profile , most historians have concluded that she was a member of Gediminas ' family . The marriage had great potential because Lithuania and Moscow were fierce rivals for supremacy in Ruthenia , but conflicts broke out again in 1335 , just two years after the marriage . Her two sons <unk> and Konstantin did not survive infancy ; her daughter <unk> married Mikhail <unk> of Kashin , a <unk> prince opposing Lithuania . Her brother Jaunutis sought her help when he was deposed by Algirdas in 1345 . Immediately before her death on 11 March 1345 <unk> became a nun . She was buried within the Moscow Kremlin at a monastic church whose construction she had sponsored . 
 It is possible that Gediminas had two more daughters . According to Maciej Stryjkowski , one of Gediminas ' daughters was married to David of Hrodna , his favorite war leader . However , some historians disagree with the conclusion that David was Gediminas ' son @-@ in @-@ law , expressing skepticism about the reliability of Stryjkowski 's sources . The existence of another daughter , or possibly another sister , has been hypothesized based on the list of Metropolitan <unk> ' property published in 1916 . The list contains a note describing Andrei Mstislavich , Duke of Kozelsk ( ruled ca . 1320 — 1339 ) , as Gediminas ' son @-@ in @-@ law . On the other hand , the Ruthenian word <unk> ' ( <unk> ) can mean either " son @-@ in @-@ law " or " sister 's husband " . Hence Andrei of Kozelsk could have been Gediminas ' brother @-@ in @-@ law . 
 = = = Sons = = = 
 The chronicle of John of Winterthur contains a reference to Gediminas ' eight sons . The names of seven sons can be found in various written sources , while the identity of the eighth remains disputed . Alvydas Nikžentaitis suggests that this son was the Duke of Trakai who perished in 1337 near <unk> . Duke of Trakai was an important position held either by the Grand Duke himself or his second @-@ in @-@ command . Therefore , 18th- and 19th @-@ century historians believed that it was Gediminas himself who died in <unk> , which still advertises itself as the place of Gediminas ' burial . Nikžentaitis further postulates that the name of the unknown son might have been Vytautas , as records mention a young and powerful Yuri , son of Vytautas and deputy of Andrei , son of Algirdas . Yuri died in 1348 . His high position in youth could easily be accounted for by being a grandson of Gediminas . However , others dispute these theories , arguing that the note in John of Winterthur 's chronicle was misinterpreted . 
 It is unclear why , but Jaunutis , a middle son not mentioned in any written sources before the coup d 'état accomplished by his brothers , was designated by Gediminas as his heir in Vilnius and consequently became the Grand Duke . His brother Kęstutis , Duke of Trakai , was assisting him in Samogitia . Despite help from Narimantas , Jaunutis was deposed by his brothers Algirdas and Kęstutis in 1345 , just four years after Gediminas ' death . Jaunutis tried , but failed , to solicit help from his brother @-@ in @-@ law Simeon of Russia and was baptized as Iwan in the process . He was forced to reconcile with Algirdas and in compensation received the Duchy of <unk> , which he ruled until his death in 1366 . 
 Several sons of Gediminas continued his male line , but it was Algirdas who continued the main Gediminid line . Before deposing his brother Jaunutis in 1345 , he ruled Kreva and , despite remaining pagan , married Maria , a daughter of the last prince of Vitebsk . After 1345 he became the Grand Duke of Lithuania and shared his power with his brother Kęstutis . Their successful collaboration is celebrated in Lithuanian historiography , and gave rise to a much debated theory that a tradition of co @-@ rule or diarchy in Lithuania was customary and arose as early as 1285 . The Grand Duchy experienced its greatest expansion during their reign . While Algirdas was mostly active in the east , Kęstutis occupied himself by managing the Duchy 's interactions with the Teutonic Knights , Poland , and other western European entities . In 1350 Algirdas contracted a second marriage with Uliana of Tver ; he chose their son Jogaila as the next Grand Duke . In 1385 Jogaila opened a new chapter in the history of Lithuania by converting the country to Christianity and signing a personal union with Poland , becoming King of Poland . This Polish – Lithuanian union , in various forms , survived until the third partition of the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795 . Jogaila 's branch of the Gediminids is known as the Jagiellon dynasty . 
 Kęstutis , Duke of Trakai , despite exercising considerable autonomy while controlling the western provinces of the duchy , was loyal to Algirdas and acknowledged his superiority . Kęstutis was a devoted pagan and dedicated his life to defending Lithuania from the Teutonic Knights . A popular romantic legend arose about his marriage to the pagan priestess Birutė of Palanga . They had seven or eight children , including Vytautas the Great . After Algirdas ' death in 1377 , his son Jogaila became the Grand Duke . At first Kęstutis and his son Vytautas acknowledged Jogaila 's rule , but after Jogaila signed the controversial Treaty of <unk> with the Teutonic Knights , Kęstutis seized Vilnius and became the Grand Duke in late 1381 . In August 1382 he was imprisoned in Kreva and died there . Vytautas continued his fight for supremacy , and the conflicts between the descendants of Algirdas and Kęstutis lasted well into the 15th century . 
 <unk> was the eldest son of Gediminas and inherited the territories of Kernavė and <unk> from his father . Little is known about him , and he died soon after Gediminas . It is believed that he was killed in the Battle of <unk> in 1348 along with his brother Narimantas . 
 Narimantas was the second son of Gediminas . He was baptized as Gleb and went on to rule Pinsk , Polotsk , and – as his patrimony by invitation of Novgorod 's nobles – Ladoga , <unk> and <unk> . He initiated a tradition of Lithuanian mercenary service north of Novgorod on the Swedish border that lasted until Novgorod 's fall to Moscow in 1477 and helped keep Moscow at bay . In 1345 Narimantas became the strongest supporter of his deposed brother Jaunutis and went to Jani Beg , Khan of the Golden Horde , to ask for support against Algirdas and Kęstutis . There are rumors that Narimantas married a Tatar princess , but they lack credibility . After a few years the brothers reconciled , and it is believed that Narimantas led the Battle of <unk> in the name of Algirdas and died there . He left behind three to five sons who founded Russian princely families , including <unk> and Galitzine . 
 <unk> was baptized as Mikhail and inherited Navahrudak in Black Ruthenia . In 1348 he was sent by Algirdas to Khan Jani Beg to negotiate a coalition against the Teutonic Knights , but was handed over to Moscow for ransom . He died about 1363 . It is uncertain how many children he had : the number varies between four and nine . 
 Liubartas ( baptized <unk> ) was Gediminas ' youngest son . In the early 1320s he married a daughter of Andrew of Galicia and ruled Lutsk in eastern Volhynia . After Andrew 's and his brother Lev of Galicia 's deaths about 1323 , Galicia – Volhynia experienced a power vacuum . Rather than promoting Liubartas and risking a war with Poland , Gediminas married his daughter Eufemija to Boleslaw @-@ Yuri II of Galicia . War with Poland was thereby postponed until 1340 . The Galicia – Volhynia Wars were settled after 1370 , when Poland received Galicia , while Lithuania retained Volhynia . Liubartas died around 1385 , having ruled Volhynia for roughly sixty years . He had three sons .

 = Joe Danger = 
 Joe Danger is a side @-@ scrolling video game incorporating elements of racing and platform games , and is the first game developed by Hello Games . The player controls the eponymous daredevil and navigates time @-@ limited courses , aiming to complete enough objectives to continue to further rounds . Joe Danger is presented in a light @-@ hearted way , with emphasis on stunts and maintaining speed . 
 It was released for the PlayStation 3 , via the PlayStation Network , in June 2010 , after Hello Games originally chose to publish it exclusively with Sony Computer Entertainment . A " Special Edition " for the Xbox 360 , via the Xbox Live Arcade , was released on 14 December 2011 ; an iOS spinoff was released on 10 January 2013 . In April 2015 , a version for Android was released through the Google Play Store . 
 The game was promoted in the media through interviews with the four members of the development team , in particular with Hello Games 's managing director , Sean Murray . The team used their official website and Sony 's PlayStation Blog to maintain contact with fans and to keep them up to date on the project 's progress . Much of the quality assurance process took the form of public beta testing at exhibitions . 
 On its release , Joe Danger received generally positive reviews ; most reviewers praised the accessible gameplay and the ability to edit courses while playing them . Some suggested the game would have benefited from more options , such as sharing and rating user @-@ generated content , and criticised the lack of an online multiplayer mode . Hello Games subsequently released downloadable content to add features that users and reviewers had requested in the months following the game 's release . Using leaderboard statistics , Joe Danger was estimated to have sold at least 108 @,@ 000 units in its first three months on sale . It was nominated for several awards , including the grand prize at the 2010 Independent Games Festival . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The player controls motorbike stuntman " Joe Danger " and guides him through ten " trials " to defeat his nemeses , the members of Team Nasty . The game uses elements of both racing and side @-@ scrolling platform genres , in which the protagonist can move to the right and , by reversing , to the left as well as hopping over and ducking under various obstacles . Although the game is based on a two @-@ dimensional plane , some of its courses are designed with three layers accessible by changing lanes . The bike is controllable in the air allowing various tricks to be performed , for which points are awarded with higher scores awarded for long trick sequences , and for manoeuvring onto targets . Executing a stunt will build a " boost meter " , which is used to increases Joe 's speed , but drains the meter . The Select button is used to teleport Joe back to the last checkpoint passed . 
 Joe Danger 's level design was directly influenced by the Sonic the Hedgehog game series , as evidenced by the use of avoidable spikes , vertical loops , and springs placed in levels to allow higher jumps . Some elements are designed to hinder the player , such as conveyor belts , which slow the motorbike , oversized boxing gloves , which will propel the player backwards and barricades , which make it necessary to switch to an alternative lane . 
 The primary goal in each level is to collect as many " stars " as possible . A star is collected for completing an objective , and once enough are collected , the next course is unlocked . Critics compared this process to that used in the Super Mario Bros. titles . The player is free to choose which objectives to complete , with the option of replaying a level to earn more stars . The most common objective is to finish a course within a time limit with as many points as possible . Other level @-@ specific objectives include collecting a series of coins , hidden stars or letters spelling " Danger " , while in others the player is required to land on every target , or to complete a course in one continuous sequence of tricks . Later levels require the player to do more than one objective simultaneously . 
 Joe Danger contains a sandbox mode , which allows the player to drag @-@ and @-@ drop objects onto the course to customise levels . This mode is integrated into some single @-@ player levels where the game may instruct the player to introduce obstacles such as ramps to access later sections . New levels can be shared online with friends via the PlayStation Network . The game has a split screen multiplayer mode for up to four players on a selection of specially @-@ made tracks . There is leaderboard support , initially limited to those on the player 's PlayStation Network friend list . 
 = = Development and release = = 
 Hello Games was formed in July 2009 by former Criterion and Electronic Arts employee Sean Murray together with three friends who had experience with British videogame developers Kuju , Climax and Sumo . Murray , who held technical director and lead programmer roles working on PlayStation 2 games Burnout 3 : Takedown and Black , became managing director of Hello Games , with Grant Duncan as art director , Ryan Doyle as technical director and David Ream as creative director . The team gained their first experiences of creating their own games by making levels for Doom and Unreal . Doyle expressed the belief that smaller games could be created more cost @-@ effectively by an independent group than by a larger company . 
 The concept for Joe Danger arose , according to Doyle , from the team 's wish to make " something that puts a smile on people 's faces " similar to such games as Mario Kart and Micro Machines . An Evel Knievel toy was a main source of inspiration for the " Joe " character ; the team had fun " firing that stunt cycle out of windows and down halls " . Nevertheless , Murray likened work as an independent developer to " the reality of eating ice cream every day for every meal " as the novelty of working for themselves wore off . The team often spent more than 60 hours a week working on the project because of the " unrealistic " time scales for development and with only four team members , each had to fulfil several roles ; they had no public relations representative nor did they have a business manager or a designer . No software design document was made throughout the production of Joe Danger , since the team felt they understood each other 's ideas . 
 The game was announced on the developers ' website on 23 September 2009 and given its first public showcase in November 2009 at the Eurogamer Expo in Earls Court . The team used this event as an opportunity for extensive playtesting , receiving feedback from those playing the game and creating new software builds for each day of the expo . Murray cited numerous " happy accidents " during development , which led to incorporation of various features into the end product . An example of this was a bug in the programming which enabled players to jump as often as they liked in mid @-@ air ; the team decided this was fun and incorporated it as a double jump . 
 Hello Games struggled to find a third @-@ party publisher for the game . A month after release , Murray revealed at the annual Develop developers ' conference in Brighton some of the reasons publishers gave for their rejections . There were worries about the lack of potential for porting it to other platforms , and comments such as " collecting giant coins feels unrealistic to me " , and " we want games that are less about fun right now " . One prospective publisher intimated that they might have published the game if the main character had been a monkey . When players were invited to make suggestions for additional characters , there was popular support for the monkey idea ; this led to the introduction of a downloadable bonus character , Chuckles the Chimp . 
 After initially being unsure of the best platform on which to release Joe Danger , the developers announced in March 2010 that they would be releasing the game only on Sony 's PlayStation 3 . This decision enabled Hello to make use of Sony 's " Publishing Fund " , a scheme which offered advantageous financial terms in exchange for exclusivity . Murray said that the PlayStation Network was the ideal place to release the game because it was the only way they could publish by themselves and branded the Xbox Live Arcade platform a " slaughterhouse for small developers " due to poor sales figures for independent works . Joe Danger was released on 8 June 2010 in the North American PlayStation Store , with a European release the following day . 
 In October 2011 , Eurogamer picked up on an Xbox Live Arcade listing for a Joe Danger : Special Edition on the Korea Media Rating Board . The project was officially announced on 3 November ; a GameSpot @-@ exclusive trailer was released the same day . Murray said that the Special Edition will include new gameplay modes and characters ; another new addition is the " Laboratory " mode , in which the player must complete unique " developer challenges " . The edition was released on 14 December 2011 and was exclusive to the Xbox 360 . Murray stood by his earlier statements criticising Microsoft 's platform ; he said , " Obviously a comment like that isn 't meant exactly how it sounds . For probably a few years XBLA was basically the only show in town . If you managed to get your game on there it was almost a guarantee of success . I don 't think that 's the case now . That isn 't Microsoft 's fault , and it isn 't developers ' fault . It 's just that a hundred games come out there a year , and of those maybe ten break through and make an impact . The rest don 't . " He stressed the decision to port the game " made business sense " , and that the team " jumped at the chance without even thinking about the economics of it " . 
 Since the release of Special Edition , a spin @-@ off version for iOS and Android devices has been in development . The team decided not to directly adapt the original game for the new device ; Murray told Mike Rose of Gamasutra that " simply porting a game is never something I could get excited about , it 's soulless work " . He explained that the team 's aim is to create a game with similar graphics to a console game , while also keeping the frame rate at 60 frames per second . The game is being co @-@ developed by Steven Burgess , who previously worked on WiiWare game <unk> with Frontier Developments . It was given its first public showcase at the Penny Arcade Expo in Boston , Massachusetts , on 7 April . The iOS version , titled Joe Danger Touch , was listed on the iTunes Store on 10 January 2013 , priced at £ 1 @.@ 99 in the UK and $ 2 @.@ 99 in the US . 
 = = = Downloadable content = = = 
 Since the game 's initial release , additional downloadable content has been made available . The first patch for the game , dubbed " The People 's Patch " , was released in August 2010 adding two features : the ability to upload video replays to YouTube and the ability to share customised courses with those not on the player 's friends list . Their absence had been the source of early criticism by reviewers . Other additional features included custom soundtracks , new levels , and alternative costumes . The announcement of the game 's expansion coincided with a level @-@ designing competition in which the top five contestants won T @-@ shirts and artwork . Murray said Hello were trying to respond to all suggestions from users , and that they would release a patch addressing " every concern we could " . In November 2010 , the team announced four new playable characters , each with a unique appearance and range of moves .

 The single @-@ player gameplay mode of Joe Danger was generally well received by critics . The game 's accessibility was a source of praise ; according to Eric Neigher of 1UP.com , it allows for " five @-@ minute sprints " of gameplay , although more in @-@ depth options take up more time . IGN 's Daemon Hatfield compared the game favourably to Nintendo Entertainment System launch title <unk> , and said that Joe Danger felt like a Nintendo game . Other critics focused on similarities to Super Mario Bros. , such as non @-@ linear level progression ( the ability to play levels in any order , providing that the player has earned enough stars to " unlock " the level ) , the encouragement to play through multiple times to complete every objective , and the use of platforms . Another influences noted with favour by critics was the combo system , which some compared with the Tony Hawk 's series of skateboarding games . Comments were also made on the influence of early Sonic the Hedgehog titles . The cheerful , cartoon @-@ like nature of Joe Danger 's artwork was well received ; Eurogamer 's Tom Bramwell said " I 've worked on games websites for over a decade and not enough games are happy and colourful . This one is . More of this , please , everyone . " 
 Opinions were less uniformly complimentary about other modes of the game . Scott Alan Marriott of G4 TV was disappointed with the shortage of options in multiplayer modes , in particular the inability to play against others online . The game 's leaderboard feature was another source of criticism , with several reviewers noting severe lag issues . The Daily Telegraph 's Martin Gaston said " it would also have been nice to see the game give dedicated players the opportunity to study from the world 's finest by implementing online replays " , an option not originally included ; the decision not to allow sharing custom courses with users outside the player 's friend 's list was labelled " questionable " and " obtuse " . Minor criticisms related to the lack of variety in sound design and background scenery . Two months after the initial release , Hello Games ' first patch for Joe Danger contained features to cover most critics ' concerns . 
 Before its release , Joe Danger was up for the " Seumas McNally Grand Prize " and for the " Technical Excellence " award at the 2010 Independent Games Festival at the Game Developer 's Conference , losing to Monaco and Limbo respectively . The game was unsuccessfully nominated for the " Best New Download IP " award at the same year 's Develop Industry Excellence Awards in Brighton , instead winning the studio the " Best New Studio " and " Micro Studio " awards . It received a nomination for " Best PlayStation Network Exclusive Game " at the PlayStation Network Gamers ' Choice Awards in March 2011 but was beaten by Dead Nation ; it appeared in the " Best Downloadable Game " category at GamesMaster 's Golden Joystick Awards in September 2011 , but missed out to Minecraft . The same month , Play placed it top of its " 50 Best PSN Games " feature , ahead of titles such as Braid and The Last Guy .

 Joe Danger sold over 50 @,@ 000 units in its first week on sale on the PlayStation Network . The team announced at the Develop Conference 2010 that they broke even on the day of release . Based on research published by Gamasutra 's Ryan Langley , who used the number of unique entries on a game 's online leaderboard to estimate the number of sales , it sold more than 68 @,@ 000 units in its first month of release . In July , the same statistics indicated a further 24 @,@ 000 units had been sold , bringing the two @-@ month total to over 92 @,@ 000 . The next month saw at least 16 @,@ 000 new players . Exact sales figures are uncertain because only a limited number of scores can be held within a leaderboard for PlayStation Network games , but on the basis of these numbers the game sold at least 108 @,@ 000 units in its first three months . Murray said that as Joe Danger does not allow scores of zero to make the leaderboards , the true quantity sold was likely to be substantially higher than indicated . In December 2011 , PlayStation Network 's senior director Susan Panico named Joe Danger the year 's third best @-@ selling game to be supported by Sony 's Publishing Fund behind Hoard and Tales from Space : About a Blob . 
 Sales for the Xbox Live Arcade version were less impressive ; Langley 's statistics indicate that 8 @,@ 300 units sold in the first week , and by December 's end that figure rested at around 16 @,@ 800 . At least 6 @,@ 800 further sales were noted with the same technique in January 2012 , and by March the overall figure was thought to be least 37 @,@ 500 units .

 Several months after Joe Danger 's release , Hello Games began to advertise positions on their website , indicating that work was proceeding on a new project . New staff were added and towards the end of the year the organisation moved its offices . After an announcement on Hello Games ' website a week prior , Joe Danger : The Movie was presented for the first time at Gamescom in Cologne in August 2011 . Murray said the game is " kind of " a sequel to Joe Danger , but that he envisioned it big enough to dwarf the original . Renamed Joe Danger 2 : The Movie , the game was released 14 September 2012 , and was the last of Hello Games ' projects to be based around the character . 
 = = PlayStation Vita version = = 
 A version of the game for the PlayStation Vita was announced on 27 August 2014 . The game contains both levels from the original game , and levels exclusive to the PlayStation Vita . It was available for free on the PlayStation Plus Instant Game Collection service in September 2014 . There are 25 playable characters available in the game , as well as a modified level editor . 
 = Japanese battleship Shikishima = 
 Shikishima ( <unk> ) was the lead ship of the Shikishima class of pre @-@ dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Japanese Navy by British shipyards in the late 1890s . During the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 1905 , the ship fought in the Battles of Port Arthur , the Yellow Sea and Tsushima and was lightly damaged in the latter action , although shells prematurely exploded in her main guns in the latter two engagements . Shikishima remained in home waters during World War I. The ship was reclassified as a coastal defence ship in 1921 and served as a training ship for the rest of her career . She was disarmed and hulked in 1923 and finally broken up for scrap in 1948 . 
 = = Description = = 
 Shikishima and her sister ship Hatsuse were designed in England as improved versions of the Royal Navy 's Majestic @-@ class battleships . Shikishima was 438 feet ( 133 @.@ 5 m ) long overall and had a beam of 75 feet 6 inches ( 23 @.@ 0 m ) . She had a full @-@ load draught of 27 feet 3 inches ( 8 @.@ 3 m ) and normally displaced 14 @,@ 850 long tons ( 15 @,@ 090 t ) and had a crew of 741 officers and enlisted men . The ship was powered by two Humphrys Tennant vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines using steam generated by 25 Belleville boilers . The engines were rated at 14 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 10 @,@ 800 kW ) , using forced draught , and were designed to reach a top speed of around 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . Shikishima , however , reached a top speed of 19 @.@ 027 knots ( 35 @.@ 238 km / h ; 21 @.@ 896 mph ) from 14 @,@ 667 indicated horsepower ( 10 @,@ 937 kW ) on her sea trials . She carried a maximum of 1 @,@ 700 long tons ( 1 @,@ 700 t ) of coal which allowed her to steam for 5 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 9 @,@ 300 km ; 5 @,@ 800 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 The ship 's main battery consisted of four 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) guns mounted in two twin gun turrets , one forward and one aft . The secondary battery consisted of fourteen 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) quick @-@ firing guns , mounted in casemates on the sides of the hull and in the superstructure . A number of smaller guns were carried for defence against torpedo boats . These included 20 QF 12 @-@ pounder 12 cwt guns , six 47 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) 3 @-@ pounder guns and six 37 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) 2 @.@ 5 @-@ pounder Hotchkiss guns . She was also armed with four submerged 18 @-@ inch torpedo tubes . Shikishima 's waterline armour belt consisted of Harvey armour and was 4 – 9 inches ( 102 – 229 mm ) thick . The armour of her gun turrets had a maximum thickness of 10 in ( 254 mm ) and her deck ranged from 2 @.@ 5 to 4 inches ( 64 to 102 mm ) in thickness . 
 = = Operational career = = 
 Shikishima , a poetical name for Japan , was one of four battleships ordered from overseas shipyards as part of the 10 Year Naval Expansion Programme and paid for from the £ 30 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 indemnity paid by China after its defeat in the Sino @-@ Japanese War of 1894 – 1895 . The ship was laid down by Thames Iron Works at their Blackwall , London shipyard on 29 March 1897 . She was launched on 1 November 1898 and completed on 26 January 1900 . 
 At the start of the Russo @-@ Japanese War , Shikishima , commanded by Captain <unk> <unk> , was assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Fleet . She participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904 when Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō led the 1st Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur . Tōgō had expected his surprise night attack on the Russians by his destroyers to be much more successful than it actually was and expected to find them badly disorganized and weakened , but the Russians had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack . The Japanese ships were spotted by the cruiser Boyarin which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defences . Tōgō chose to attack the Russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage the Russian ships with his secondary guns . Splitting his fire proved to be ineffective as the Japanese 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) and six @-@ inch guns inflicted very little significant damage on the Russian ships who concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect . Although a large number of ships on both sides were hit , Russian casualties numbered only 17 while the Japanese suffered 60 killed and wounded before Tōgō disengaged . Shikishima was hit by one six @-@ inch shell during the battle which wounded 17 crewmen . 
 Shikishima participated in the action of 13 April when Tōgō successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron , including Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov 's flagship , the battleship Petropavlovsk . When Makarov spotted the five battleships of the 1st Division , he turned back for Port Arthur and Petropavlovsk struck a naval mine laid by the Japanese the previous night . The Russian battleship sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazines exploded ; Makarov was one of the 677 killed . Emboldened by his success , Tōgō resumed long @-@ range bombardment missions , which prompted the Russians to lay more minefields . 
 On 14 May 1904 , Rear Admiral Nashiba Tokioki put to sea with the battleships Hatsuse ( flag ) , Shikishima , and Yashima , the protected cruiser Kasagi , and the dispatch boat Tatsuta to relieve the Japanese blockading force off Port Arthur . On the following morning , the squadron encountered a minefield laid by the Russian minelayer Amur . Hatsuse struck one mine that disabled her steering at 10 : 50 a.m. and Yashima struck another when moving to assist Hatsuse . At 12 : 33 p.m. , the latter drifted onto another mine that detonated one of her magazines , killing 496 of her crew and sinking the ship . Yashima 's flooding could not be controlled and she foundered about eight hours later , after her crew had abandoned ship . 
 Shikishima was not hit during the Battle of the Yellow Sea in August 1904 , although a shell exploded prematurely in one of her 12 @-@ inch guns , disabling it . During the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905 , she was second in the line of battle of the First Division , following Tōgō 's flagship Mikasa and was one of the main targets of the Russian battleships . Shikishima was hit nine times during the battle ; the most serious of which penetrated beneath a six @-@ inch gun , killing or wounding the entire gun crew . She also had another 12 @-@ inch shell prematurely detonate in one of her forward guns , wrecking it completely . In turn , Mikasa and Shikishima concentrated their fire on the battleship Oslyabya which eventually sank after two large @-@ calibre shells blew large holes in her bow at the waterline . These caused massive flooding that sank her , the first modern battleship sunk entirely by gunfire . Shikishima fired a total of 74 twelve @-@ inch , 1395 six @-@ inch and 1272 twelve @-@ pounder shells during the battle . She also fired a torpedo at the badly damaged armed merchant cruiser Ural that sank the Russian ship . 
 During World War I , Shikishima was based at Sasebo during 1914 – 15 and was then assigned to the Second and Fifth Squadrons , in that order , for the rest of the war . After the Washington Naval Treaty was signed , she was reclassified as a first @-@ class coast defence ship on 1 September 1921 , and was used to train submarine crews until the ship was reclassified as a transport on 1 April 1923 . Shikishima continued to be used as a training hulk for the Sasebo Naval Barracks until she was scrapped in January 1948 at the Sasebo Naval Arsenal . 
 = Youthanasia = 
 Youthanasia is the sixth studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth , released on November 1 , 1994 through Capitol Records . The album is not a large stylistic departure from the band 's earlier recordings ; however it marked the continuing evolution of Megadeth , following the footsteps of the previous album Countdown to Extinction ( 1992 ) . The album 's title is a play on words , implying that society is euthanizing its youth . The cover art features an elderly woman hanging babies by their feet on a seemingly endless clothesline ; the artwork concept was directly inspired from a line of the title track . 
 Youthanasia received positive reviews upon its release . It was commercially successful , peaking at number 4 on the Billboard 200 chart , and was certified platinum for shipping one million copies in the United States — a distinction achieved in 1995 . A remixed and remastered edition featuring several bonus tracks and detailed liner notes was reissued on July 27 , 2004 .

 Megadeth 's previous studio release , Countdown to Extinction , became the band 's biggest commercial accomplishment , entering the Billboard 200 at number two and eventually becoming double platinum . As a result , they continually sold out arenas across North America , in addition to developing a strong following overseas . With the next album , Youthanasia , the band moved towards a more mainstream sound . 
 It was a time of problems and conflicts for Megadeth , that in every two weeks or so , according to frontman Dave Mustaine , there were " outrageous emotional interventions " in order to make the group a democracy . Many band meetings during this period concerned Mustaine 's creative control over a " successful formula " , so that the rest of the band could better exercise their creativity . Another problem was the indecision on where the recording would take place . Mustaine did not want to record in Los Angeles , so it was eventually decided to record in Phoenix , since the majority of the band resided in Arizona . The sessions for the album initially began in Phase Four Studios ( Tempe ) in January 1994 , after a few weeks the sessions were moved to Vintage Recorders in Phoenix and continued ther into <unk> this studio is often the location for scenes in the <unk> video . Producer Max Norman suggested that they build a new self @-@ dedicated studio , in cooperation with the Band , Capitol and Max 's funding a modular studio was built in a warehouse in South Phoenix . Talking about the recording process , Mustaine said that Youthanasia was written solely in the studio . " We weren 't playing any old , cataloged material . None of the past really influenced the new record . " He mentioned that he gave " more freedom " to the other members and called the album " very much a total band effort " . Of interest is that this was hoped to be the " First " album recorded solely on hard drives ( rather than magnetic tape ) , Both Max and Dave were believers is being on the cutting edge of technology , Max had long been using computers to sample , tune and comp tracks . Digidesign was working on expanding ProTools from a single track to multitracking and it was hoped that as many as 48 digital tracks could be synced and used to record . The computers used were mostly Apple Quadra 400 / 500 models and with a great effort by all , it was soon evident that magnetic tape would have to be used .

 The cover art features an elderly woman hanging babies by their feet on a seemingly endless clothesline . According to bassist David Ellefson , the artwork concept was directly inspired from a line of the title track . He explained that the title track " was probably the strongest representation of how we feel about the young people who listen to our music and what their future holds for them . It 's like you have a choice , you can become proactive or you can choose ' Youthanasia ' . " The title is a combination of the words " youth " and " euthanasia " . Mustaine has stated that the idea for the title stems from hearing about Jack Kevorkian , as well as the declining state of well @-@ being of young people , specifically referring to issues like drugs , crime and violence , and a lack of parenting . 
 The album was released on November 1 , 1994 through Capitol Records . It was commercially successful , debuting and peaking at number 4 on the Billboard 200 , with 143 @,@ 000 units sold in its first week . That was slightly below the peak position of its predecessor , which hit number two in 1992 . Several weeks after its release , the record was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) for shipping one million copies in the United States . The album also managed to enter into the top 10 in the United Kingdom and some other European countries as well . It eventually received a platinum certification from Music Canada and a silver award from the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) for shipments of 100 @,@ 000 and 60 @,@ 000 copies , respectively . A remixed and remastered edition featuring several bonus tracks and detailed liner notes was reissued on July 27 , 2004 . 
 Three singles were released from Youthanasia : " Reckoning Day " , " Train of Consequences " and " A Tout le Monde " . The latter would later be re @-@ recorded with Lacuna Coil vocalist Cristina Scabbia under the title " À Tout le Monde ( Set Me Free ) " . This version was also released as a single , and included on United Abominations ( 2007 ) . Both " Train of Consequences " and " A Tout le Monde " charted on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart . 
 = = Musical style = = 
 Youthanasia was not a large stylistic departure from the band 's earlier recordings . According to Billboard , from the drumbeat opening of " Addicted to Chaos " to the precise instrumentation of " Train of Consequences " , Megadeth delivered " trademark aggressive rage ' n ' roll to powerful effect " . Billboard noted that even the slower songs such as " A Tout le Monde " were tending towards " lusty explosion " . Authors Pete Prown and Harvey P. Newquist opined that lyrically , Youthanasia contained more thematic variations from Megadeth . They wrote that the record was musically diverse , from the " slow @-@ tempo acoustic lines " of " A Tout le Monde " to the " breakneck riffing " of " Train of Consequences " and " Family Tree " . Q found that Megadeth 's " trademark crunchy riffs , thundering drums and bitter vocals " were still present on the album , with the lyrics being more introspective . 
 Mike Stagno said that Youthanasia features " a more traditional type of metal " . He explained that even though the music on a number of tracks remains quite heavy , it was obvious that the thrash metal is " very scarce " on this record . Stephen Thomas Erlewine agreed that Megadeth have abandoned some of the more experimental , progressive elements in their music . Similarly , Chris Ayers of Exclaim ! felt that with Youthanasia , the band " eroded their brilliant thrash to mid @-@ paced chug " . According to the band 's official website , " Youthanasia marked the continuing evolution of Megadeth , following the footsteps of their previous album . " Speaking about the stylistic direction of the album , then @-@ guitarist Marty Friedman stated : " We pretty much stick to our guns . It 's not like we 're gonna change our next album to try and follow the trend . We don 't really change with the times . " 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 The album received positive reviews upon its release . Stephen Thomas Erlewine , reviewing the album for AllMusic , commented that , compared to Countdown to Extinction the album lacks focus . However , Erlewine suggested that the album 's production quality made up for that . He also commented favorably on " Train of Consequences " , calling out its " jackhammer riffs " . Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic reviewed the album positively . Though noting that the album , like its predecessor , was a distinct move away from the sound heard on 1990s Rust in Peace , Stagno suggested that the lack of a fast @-@ tempo is made up for by the catchiness of the tracks . 
 In a contemporary review , Q magazine wrote that Youthanasia has " greater depth and breadth than its predecessors " . Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly , gave a brief review of the album saying that Youthanasia would " impress , but not impact . " Neil Arnold of Metal Forces named the record " the last true Megadeth opus before the mid @-@ to @-@ late 90s slump " . He further said that the album " pales " in comparison to the previous records , but still keeps the band in their element . Paul Corio , in a retrospective review for Rolling Stone , wrote that the album features " metal @-@ machine music " that is " calibrated to kill " . He highlighted " Elysian Fields " and " Victory " as examples of Mustaine in his prime . Despite the outcry of some fans , Pete Prown called Youthanasia " more than worthy follow @-@ up " to Countdown to Extinction . In 2014 , Guitar World ranked Youthanasia at number 29 on their list of " Superunknown : 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994 " . 
 = = Touring and aftermath = = 
 Megadeth toured heavily in support of Youthanasia . They started the tour in November 1994 , with live performances in South America . The tour continued in 1995 , with a number of opening acts such as Korn , Flotsam and Jetsam and Fear Factory . During this period Megadeth also visited Europe , where they stayed for eight weeks . Ellefson shared his impressions from performing in front of European fans : " So far , the audiences have been really good and it seems to me that heavy metal and especially Megadeth are very much at the forefront of music in Europe . It seems like the attendance is better than it has ever been " . The worldwide tour ended in September 1995 , with the band performing at Monsters Of Rock in South America with Ozzy Osbourne and Alice Cooper as the headliners . 
 In the middle of 1995 , the band underwent changes on the business side . Manager Ron Lafitte was hired by EMI Records and essentially disbanded his management company . Megadeth later signed with ESP Management and hired Bud Prager , a previous manager of Foreigner and Bad Company , to be the band 's new creative manager . As with Max Norman before him , Prager would go on to be highly influential in shaping the direction of the band . In an interview for Hard Rock Examiner , Mustaine revealed that there is a possibility that Megadeth are going to perform the album in its entirety in 2014 , honoring the 20 @-@ year anniversary of the record 's release .

 = 1970 Tonghai earthquake = 
 The 1970 Tonghai earthquake occurred on 4 January with a moment magnitude of 7 @.@ 1 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of X ( Extreme ) . The strike @-@ slip rupture originated on the Red River Fault , which had not experienced an earthquake above magnitude 7 since 1700 , and affected Tonghai County , Yunnan province , China . At least 10 @,@ 000 people were killed , making it one of the deadliest in its decade . The tremor caused between US $ 5 to $ 25 million in damage , felt over an area of 8 @,@ 781 km2 ( 3 @,@ 390 sq mi ) . In Hanoi , North Vietnam , almost 483 km ( 300 mi ) from the epicenter , victims left their homes as the rupture rumbled through the city . 
 Occurring during the height of the Cultural Revolution , it was not widely publicized by the Chinese government for well over a decade . The amount of aid and finances distributed was described by the Beijing Morning Post as " pathetically small " . Much of the aid provided to survivors was in " spiritual " form , including Mao Zedong badges and condolence letters . Nevertheless , the earthquake was among the first to be studied over a long term by the Chinese government . It was cited as one of the reasons behind creating the largest earthquake monitoring system in China , 25 years later . 
 = = Background and tectonics = = 
 Yunnan , the epicentral region , is one of the more seismically active Chinese provinces . The earliest earthquake recorded there was in the 9th century ; however , moderate to strong ones have been observed since the 15th century . Since the 9th century , 32 earthquakes with a magnitude of 7 or greater have occurred in the province . Shallow strike @-@ slip faulting is a characteristic of Yunnan quakes . 
 Earthquakes in southwestern Yunnan , such as the 1970 Tonghai event , are less frequent than in other parts of the province . The Red River Fault , the fault line on which this quake is alleged to have occurred , has lacked seismological activity as a whole . Red River <unk> generally rise at high angles , as shown in a 1962 Ministry of Geology report . Marking in sedimentary rocks indicate that several large earthquakes formed on the fault during the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs . Until this quake , no earthquake above magnitude 7 @.@ 0 on the Richter scale had occurred on this fault since about 1700 , and the fault was believed to be " dead " . Since the 1970 Tonghai rupture , it is believed that the Red River fault is instead experiencing a long seismic gap similar to that of the Japan Median Tectonic Line , on which no major temblor has formed since 700 but produced massive ones during the Holocene epoch . 
 = = Damage and casualties = = 
 The epicenter of the quake was about 121 km ( 75 mi ) southwest of Kunming and 97 km ( 60 mi ) northwest of <unk> ; this area was mainly a tobacco @-@ growing region . Effects of the rupture were felt over an area of 8 @,@ 781 km2 ( 3 @,@ 390 sq mi ) . In Hanoi , North Vietnam , almost 483 km ( 300 mi ) from the epicenter , victims left their homes as the rupture rumbled through the city . 
 The earthquake measured 7 @.@ 1 on the moment magnitude scale . It may have killed more than 15 @,@ 000 people , making it the third deadliest in China during the 20th century , and injured an additional 26 @,@ 783 . The tremor caused between US $ 5 to $ 25 million in damage . A Reuters news report , the only one in the immediate aftermath , mentioned the recording of a " severe " quake by Hong Kong 's Royal Observatory and cited an unconfirmed report that it might have destroyed part of Kunming . It caused 50 km ( 31 mi ) of visible surface faulting on the Tonghai Fault . There was a maximum horizontal offset of 2 @.@ 5 m ( 8 ft ) and vertical offset of about 0 @.@ 5 m ( 1 @.@ 5 ft ) . As a result of inversion techniques , scientists were able to decide that several events comprised the surface faulting . This further confirmed that the earthquake , along with a later earthquake in Yunnan in 1973 , corresponded to a fault within the area . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 = = = Scientific study = = = 
 The earthquake was among the first to be studied over a long term by the Chinese government . More than 40 Chinese seismologists , engineers , and geologists visited the disaster zone to conduct research into the cause and damage of the earthquake ; some spending as much as a year collecting soil samples and recording other primary research evidence for future study . Such data was collected over a broad area of almost 1400 towns within the area . 
 = = = Reaction = = = 
 According to the Reuters report , the survivors came together to " fight against the disaster " . Much of the aid provided to survivors was in " spiritual " form . The Chinese government sent tens of thousands Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong books and badges in his honor to victims as part of the relief effort , and survivors also received 14 @,@ 350 sympathy letters . However , the amount of aid and finances distributed was described by the Beijing Morning Post 30 years later as " pathetically small . " 
 The details of the earthquake were not widely publicized by Chinese authorities until about 18 years after its occurrence . In China 's first decades of Communist rule , its policy was to not disclose natural disasters or accidents unless foreigners were injured . While the Chinese official press had not released a comprehensive report , Reuters and the Royal Hong Kong Observatory both released information soon after the disaster . At the time of the quake , the Xinhua News Agency briefly mentioned a smaller magnitude quake but did not provide information on damage or casualties . 
 On 19 November 1988 , nearly nineteen years later , Chen <unk> of the State Seismology Bureau , speaking at a news conference for another earthquake that had recently occurred , estimated the death toll of the 1970 quake to be 10 @,@ 000 . He did not give a reason why his government had not previously disclosed this knowledge . Government officials from China released a different estimate in 2000 , putting the death toll at 15 @,@ 621 . China published the estimate after a memorial service for survivors and relatives was held in Yuxi on January 5 . A Yuxi Seismology Bureau official noted that the information had been classified for " political reasons " and the death toll estimate had been known among bureaucrats as early as 1997 . 
 Twenty @-@ five years after the earthquake , the largest earthquake @-@ monitoring network nationally was established in Yunnan . It set up earthquake offices in every county to prepare for another large rupture . The 1970 Tonghai earthquake was cited as one of the reasons behind creating the monitoring system . 
 = Economic history of Argentina = 
 The economic history of Argentina is one of the most studied , owing to the " Argentine paradox " , its unique condition as a country that had achieved advanced development in the early 20th century but experienced a reversal , which inspired an enormous wealth of literature and diverse analysis on the causes of this decline . 
 Argentina possesses definite comparative advantages in agriculture , as the country is endowed with a vast amount of highly fertile land . Between 1860 and 1930 , exploitation of the rich land of the pampas strongly pushed economic growth . During the first three decades of the 20th century , Argentina outgrew Canada and Australia in population , total income , and per capita income . By 1913 , Argentina was the world 's 10th wealthiest nation per capita . 
 Beginning in the 1930s , however , the Argentine economy deteriorated notably . The single most important factor in this decline has been political instability since 1930 , when a military junta took power , ending seven decades of civilian constitutional government . In macroeconomic terms , Argentina was one of the most stable and conservative countries until the Great Depression , after which it turned into one of the most unstable . Successive governments from the 1930s to the 1970s pursued a strategy of import substitution to achieve industrial self @-@ sufficiency , but the government 's encouragement of industrial growth diverted investment from agricultural production , which fell dramatically . 
 The era of import substitution ended in 1976 , but the same time growing government spending , large wage increases and inefficient production created a chronic inflation that rose through the 1980s . The measures enacted during the last dictatorship also contributed to the huge foreign debt by the late 1980s , which became equivalent to three @-@ fourths of the GNP . 
 In the early 1990s the government reined in inflation by making the peso equal in value to the U.S. dollar , and privatised numerous state @-@ run companies , using part of the proceeds to reduce the national debt . However , a sustained recession at the turn of the 21st century culminated in a default , and the government again devalued the peso . By 2005 the economy had recovered , but a judicial ruling originating from the previous crisis led to a new default in 2014 . 
 = = Colonial economy = = 
 During the colonial period , present @-@ day Argentina offered fewer economic advantages compared to other parts of the Spanish Empire such as Mexico or Peru , which caused it to assume a peripheral position within the Spanish colonial economy . It lacked deposits of gold or other precious metals , nor did it have established native civilizations to subject to the encomienda . 
 Only two @-@ thirds of its present territory were occupied during the colonial period , as the remaining third consisted of the Patagonian Plateau , which remains sparsely populated to this day . The agricultural and livestock sector 's output was principally consumed by the producers themselves and by the small local market , and only became associated with foreign trade towards the end of the 18th century . The period between the 16th and the end of the 18th century was characterized by the existence of self @-@ sufficient regional economies separated by considerable distances , a lack of road , maritime or river communications , and the hazards and hardship of land transport . By the end of the 18th century , a significant national economy came into being , as Argentina developed a market in which reciprocal flows of capital , labour , and goods could take place on a significant scale between its different regions , which it had hitherto lacked . 
 Historians like <unk> Peña consider this historical period of the Americas as pre @-@ capitalist , as most production of the coastal cities was destined to overseas markets . Rodolfo <unk> consider it instead a feudalist society , based on work relations such as the encomienda or the slavery . Norberto Galasso and Enrique Rivera consider that it was neither capitalist nor feudalist , but an hybrid system result of the interaction of the Spanish civilization , on the transition from feudalism to capitalism , and the natives , still living in the prehistory . 
 The Argentine territories , held back by their closed economies , the lack of any activity closely linked to foreign trade , and the scant amounts of labour and capital they consequently received , fell far behind those of other areas of the colonial world that participated in foreign trade . Only activities associated with a dynamic exporting centre enjoyed some degree of prosperity , as occurred in Tucuman , where cloth was manufactured , and in Córdoba and the Litoral , where livestock was raised to supply the mines of Upper Peru . 
 This trade was legally limited to Spain : the Spanish Crown enforced a monopsony which limited supplies and enabled Spanish merchants to mark up prices and increase profits . British and Portuguese merchants broke this monopsony by resorting to contraband trade . 
 The British desire to trade with South America grew during the Industrial Revolution and the loss of their 13 colonies in North America during the American Revolution . To achieve their economic objectives , Britain initially launched the British invasions of the Río de la Plata to conquer key cities in Spanish America . When they allied to Spain during the Napoleonic Wars , they requested the Spanish authorities to open commerce to Britain in return . 
 The first Argentine historians , such as Bartolomé Mitre , attributed the free trade to the The Representation of the Hacendados economic report by Mariano Moreno , but is currently considered the result of a general negotiation between Britain and Spain , as reflected in the Apodaca @-@ Canning treaty of 1809 . The actions of Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros in Buenos Aires reflected similar outcomes emanating from the other Spanish cities of South America . 
 Compared to other parts of Latin America , slavery played a much lesser role in the development of the Argentine economy , mostly because of the absence of gold mines and sugar plantations , which would have demanded huge numbers of slave workers . Colonial Brazil , for example , imported as many as 2 @.@ 5 million Africans in the 18th century . By contrast , an estimated 100 @,@ 000 African slaves arrived at the port of Buenos Aires in the 17th and 18th centuries , and many were destined for Paraguay , Chile and Bolivia . 
 The colonial livestock ranches were established toward the middle of the 18th century . The pace of growth in the region increased dramatically with the establishment in 1776 of the new Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata with Buenos Aires as its capital , and increased legal trading allowed by the Free Trade Act of 1778 , which allowed for " free and protected " trade between Spain and its colonies . This trade system disintegrated during the Napoleonic era , and contraband became common again . 
 = = Post @-@ independence transition = = 
 During the early post @-@ independence period , an important share of Argentina 's exports came from cattle and sheep production . The livestock @-@ raising economy was based upon the abundance of fertile land in the littoral provinces . <unk> apparently lacked comparative advantage compared to livestock grazing . 
 Exports rose 4 % to 5 % annually from 1810 to 1850 and 7 % to 8 % from 1850 to 1870 . This growth was achieved through the extension of the frontier and greater efficiency in livestock production . 
 As a result of the diversification in markets and products , Argentina managed to escape the trap of a single @-@ staple economy and sustained its economic growth over six decades . The combined effect of declining prices of textiles and rising prices of livestock products produced dramatic improvements in the terms of trade , which rose 377 % between 1810 and 1825 in local prices . Several governors waged campaigns against the natives to increase the available lands , from Juan Manuel de Rosas to Julio Argentino Roca . 
 Most poor gauchos joined forces with the most powerful caudillos in the vicinity . As the Federal party , they opposed the policies implemented by Buenos Aires , and waged the Argentine Civil Wars . 
 = = = 1810 – 1829 = = = 
 After Argentina became independent in 1810 , an era in which commerce was controlled by a small group of peninsular merchants came to an end . The Primera Junta , the first government established after the 1810 May Revolution , undertook a protectionist policy until their fall from government . 
 The First Triumvirate ( 1811 – 1812 ) , influenced by Bernardino Rivadavia and Manuel García , instead promoted unrestricted trade with Britain . The Second Triumvirate ( 1812 – 1814 ) and José Gervasio Artigas ( who controlled the Liga Federal during the 1815 – 1820 period ) sought to restore the initial protectionist policy , but the Supreme Director restored free trade once more . Thus , the economy of the Río de la Plata became one of the most open economies in the world . 
 Between 1812 and 1816 divisions developed between an Unitarist faction centred on Buenos Aires and a Federalist faction in the provinces , which eventually led to a series of civil wars that ended with the conquest of Buenos Aires by Federalist caudillos at the Battle of Cepeda in 1820 . 
 Each province had its own money , and the same money had a different value from one province and another , and even among cities in the same province . 
 The government of Martín Rodríguez ( 1820 – 1824 ) and his minister Bernardino Rivadavia , then Las Heras and finally Rivadavia himself as the first president of Argentina from 1826 to 1827 , developed an economic plan deemed as " The happy experience " . This plan increased the British influence in the national politics . It was based on five main pillars : complete free trade and no protectionist policies against British imports , finance with a central bank managed by British investors , absolute control of the port of Buenos Aires as the sole source of income from national customs , British exploitation of the national natural resources , and an Unitarist national organization centred in Buenos Aires . After Rivadavia resigned in 1827 , ending the " happy experience " , the federalist Manuel Dorrego assumed power as governor of Buenos Aires , but was soon executed by the unitarian Juan Lavalle during a military coup . 
 The exports of gold , allowed by the free trade policies , soon depleted the national reserves . This posed a great problem , as gold was the medium of exchange of the local economy . Rivadavia sought to fix it by establishing the " Discount Bank " , a central bank for printing fiat money . Despite of the role as a central bank , this bank was not owned by the state , but by private British investors . 
 The report of the American John Murray Forbes to John Quincy Adams , sixth President of the United States , in 1824 mentioned that Britain had a huge influence in the economic power of the country . 
 He mentioned that the government in Buenos Aires was so eager to be on good terms with Britain and gain recognition of the declaration of independence that most official institutions ( as the Bank ) were under British control , and that Britain had similar control over the Argentine economy to that metropole of a colony , without the financial , civil or military costs . Even the lack of an Argentine merchant fleet allowed Britain to manage the maritime trade . Forbes 's testimony should be appraised in perspective of the contemporary Anglo @-@ American commercial rivalry , In light of the partial nature of the account and of his " jealousy , even antipathy " towards the English in Rio de la Plata . 
 In the mid @-@ 1820s , when Manuel José García was Minister of Finance , the government borrowed heavily to finance new projects and to pay off war debts . These loans were tendered at <unk> rates : in one notorious loan , the government received credit for £ 570 @,@ 000 from the Baring Brothers in exchange for a debt of £ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 . In the 1820s , the peso papel began to lose value rapidly with respect to the peso <unk> , which was linked to the price of gold . In 1827 the peso papel was devalued by 33 % , and was devalued again by 68 % in 1829 . 
 = = = 1829 – 1870 = = = 
 Juan Manuel de Rosas forced Lavalle to leave the province , and the federals ruled Buenos Aires until 1852 . Rosas modified a number of policies of the <unk> period but maintained others : he set a customs law with protectionist policies , but kept the port under the exclusive control of Buenos Aires and refused to call a constituent assembly . 
 The customs law set trade barriers to products produced in the country , and imposed high import tariffs on luxury goods , together with export quotas and tariffs on gold and silver . However , the law was not completely effective because of the control of the port , which did not allow the provinces a steady financial income . The exclusive control of the port was long resisted by federals from other provinces , and led to the conflict of Rosas and Justo José de Urquiza at the battle of Caseros . Despite the financial obstacles , the economy of Entre Ríos has grew to a size near that of Buenos Aires , with the decline of <unk> and the growth of wool production . 
 In 1838 there was a new currency crisis , and the peso papel was devalued by 34 % , and in 1839 when the peso papel lost 66 % of its value . It was again devalued by 95 % in 1845 , and by 40 % in 1851 . The Alsina years , which coincided with the secession of Buenos Aires , saw an extremely poor economic performance . Efforts to fund extraordinary expenditure on the conflict between Buenos Aires and the other provinces of the Confederation caused the fiscal deficit to skyrocket . Similarly , the Confederation faced harsh economic conditions . Urquiza , president of the Confederation , issued the ' law of differential rights ' , benefiting the ships trading with the ports of the Confederation and but not with Buenos Aires . 
 The end of the civil wars provided the political and legal stability necessary to assert property rights and cut transaction costs , contributing to the huge inflows of capital and labour resources that built modern Argentina . In 1866 an attempt was made to stabilize the currency , by introducing a system of convertibility , which restricted the monetary authorities to issue paper currency only if it was fully backed by gold or convertible foreign currency . The decades of the 1860s and 1880s experienced the most favourable performance of the economy overall , setting the stage for the so @-@ called Golden Age of Argentine history . 
 In the 60 years after the founding of the farming colony at Esperanza in 1856 , the base of Argentine agriculture gradually shifted from livestock to crops . 
 = = Export @-@ led boom = = 
 Argentina , which had been insignificant during the first half of the 19th century , showed growth from the 1860s up until 1930 that was so impressive that it was expected to eventually become the United States of South America . This impressive and sustained economic performance was driven by the export of agricultural goods . 
 During the second half of the 19th century , there was an intense process of colonization of the territory in the form of latifundia . Until 1875 wheat was imported as it was not grown in sufficient quantities to supply local demand ; by 1903 the country supplied all its own needs and exported 75 @,@ 270 @,@ 503 imperial bushels ( 2 @,@ 737 @,@ 491 @.@ 8 m3 ) of wheat , enough to sustain 16 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 people . 
 In the 1870s real wages in Argentina were around 76 % relative to Britain , rising to 96 % in the first decade of the 20th century . GDP per capita rose from 35 % of the United States average in 1880 to about 80 % in 1905 , similar to that of France , Germany and Canada .

 In 1870 , during Sarmiento 's presidency , total debt amounted to 48 million gold pesos . A year later , it had almost doubled . Avellaneda became president after winning the 1874 presidential election . The coalition that supported his candidature became the Partido <unk> Nacional , Argentina 's first national party ; all the presidents until 1916 would come from this party . Avellaneda undertook the tough actions needed to get the debt under control . In 1876 convertibility was suspended . The inflation rate rose to almost 20 % in the following year , but the ratio of debt to GDP plummeted . Avellaneda 's administration was the first to deliver a balance in the fiscal accounts since the mid @-@ 1850s . Avellaneda passed on to his successor , Julio Argentino Roca , a much more manageable economic environment . 
 In 1881 , a currency reform introduced a bimetallic standard , which went into effect in July 1883 . Unlike many precious metal standards the system was very decentralized : no national monetary authority existed and all control over convertibility rested with the five banks of issue . The period of convertibility lasted only 17 months : from December 1884 the banks of issue refused to exchange gold at par for notes . The suspension of convertibility was soon accommodated by the government , since , having no institutional power over the monetary system , there was little they could do to prevent it . 
 The profitability of the agricultural sector attracted foreign capital for railways and industries . British capital investments went from just over £ 20 million in 1880 to £ 157 million in 1890 . During the 1880s , investment began to show some diversification as capital began to flow from other countries such as France , Germany and Belgium , though British investment still accounted for two thirds of total foreign capital . In 1890 Argentina was the destination of choice for British investment in Latin America , a position it held until World War I. By then , Argentina had absorbed between 40 % and 50 % of all British investment outside the United Kingdom . Despite its dependence on the British market , Argentina managed a 6 @.@ 7 % annual rate of growth of exports between 1870 and 1890 as a result of successful geographic and commodity diversification . 
 The first Argentine railway , a ten @-@ kilometre road , had been built in 1854 . By 1885 , a total of 2 @,@ 700 miles ( 4 @,@ 300 km ) of railways were open for traffic . The new railways brought livestock to Buenos Aires from the vast pampas , for slaughter and processing in the ( mainly English ) meat @-@ packing plants , and then for shipment around the world . Some contemporary analysts lamented the export bias of the network configuration , while opposing the " monopoly " of private British companies on nationalist grounds . Others have since argued that the initial layout of the system was mostly shaped by domestic interests , and that it was not , in fact , strictly focused on the port of Buenos Aires . 
 The scarcity of labour and abundance of land induced a high marginal product of labour . European immigrants ( chiefly Italians , Spaniards , French and Germans ) , tempted by the high wages , arrived in droves . The government subsidized European immigration for a short time in the late 1880s , but immigrants arrived in massive numbers even with no subsidy . 
 = = = Baring crisis to World War I = = = 
 Juárez Celman 's administration saw a substantial increase in the ratio of debt to GDP toward the end of his tenure and an increasing weakness in the fiscal situation . The Baring Brothers merchant bank had developed a close and profitable association with Argentina , and when Celman 's government was unable to meet its payments to the House of Baring , a financial crisis ensued . Argentina defaulted and suffered bank runs as the Baring Brothers faced failure . The crisis was caused by the lack of co @-@ ordination between monetary policy and fiscal policy , which ultimately led to the collapse of the banking system . The financial crisis of 1890 left the government with no funds for its immigration subsidies programme , and it was abolished in 1891 . Loans to Argentina were severely curtailed , and imports had to be cut sharply . Exports were less affected , but the value of Argentine exports did not surpass the 1889 peak until 1898 . 
 Celman 's successor , Carlos Pellegrini , laid the foundations for a return to stability and growth after the restoration of convertibility in 1899 . He also reformed the banking sector in ways that were to restore stability in the medium term . Rapid growth rates soon returned : in the period 1903 – 1913 , GDP increased at an annual rate of 7 @.@ 7 % , and industry grew even faster , jumping by 9 @.@ 6 % . By 1906 , Argentina had cleared the last remnants of the 1890 default and a year later the country re @-@ entered the international bond markets . 
 All the same , between 1853 and the 1930s , fiscal instability was a transitory phenomenon . The depressions of 1873 – 77 and 1890 – 91 played a crucial role in fostering the rise of industry : timidly in the 1870s and more decisively in the 1890s , industry grew with each crisis in response to the need of a damaged economy to improve its trade balance through import @-@ substitution . By 1914 , about 15 % the Argentine labour force was involved in manufacturing , compared to 20 % involved in commercial activities . In 1913 , the country 's income per head was on a par with that of France and Germany , and far ahead of Italy 's or Spain 's . At the end of 1913 , Argentina had a gold stock of £ 59 million , or 3 @.@ 7 % of the world 's monetary gold , while representing 1 @.@ 2 % of the world 's economic output . 
 = = Interwar period = = 
 = = = 1914 – 1929 = = = 
 Argentina , like many other countries , entered into a recession following the beginning of World War I as international flows of goods , capital and labour declined . Foreign investment in Argentina came to a complete standstill from which it never fully recovered : Great Britain had become heavily indebted to the United States during the war and would never again export capital at a comparable scale . And after the opening of the Panama canal in 1914 , Argentina and the other Southern cone economies declined , as investors turned their attention to Asia and the Caribbean . The United States , which came out of the war a political and financial superpower , especially perceived Argentina ( and to a lesser extent Brazil ) as a potential rival on world markets . Neither the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange nor the private domestic banks developed rapidly enough to fully replace British capital . 
 As a consequence , <unk> funds became increasingly concentrated in a single institution , the Banco de la <unk> Argentina ( BNA ) , creating a financial system vulnerable to rent @-@ seeking . <unk> and non @-@ performing loans grew steadily at the BNA after 1914 , polluting its balance sheet . This corrosion of balance sheets was a result of crony loans to the other banks and the private sector . In its <unk> actions the BNA was not engaged in pure lender of last resort actions , following Bagehot 's principle of lending freely at a penalty rate . Instead , the state bank allowed the private banks to shed their risks , with bad paper used as security , and lent them cash at 4 @.@ 5 % , below the rate the BNA offered its customers on time deposits . 
 However , unlike its neighbors , Argentina became capable of still having relatively healthy growth rates during the 1920s , not being as affected by the worldwide collapse on commodity prices such as Brazil and Chile . Similarly , the gold standard was still in place at a time almost all European countries had abandoned it . Automobile ownership in the country in 1929 was the highest in the Southern hemisphere . 
 For all its success , by the 1920s Argentina was not an industrialized country by the standards of Britain , Germany or the United States . A major hindrance to full industrialisation was the lack of energy sources such as coal or hydropower . Experiments with oil , discovered in 1907 , had poor results . <unk> <unk> <unk> , the first state @-@ owned oil company in Latin America , was founded in 1922 as a public company responsible for 51 % of the oil production ; the remaining 49 % was in private hands . 
 Exports of frozen beef , especially to Great Britain , proved highly profitable after the invention of refrigerated ships in the 1870s . However Britain imposed new restrictions on meat imports in the late 1920s , which sharply reduced beef imports from Argentina . Ranchers responded by switching from pastoral to arable production , but there was lasting damage to the Argentine economy . 
 = = = Great Depression = = = 
 The Great Depression had a comparatively mild effect on Argentina , the unemployment rate never went above 10 % , and the country largely recovered by 1935 . However , the Depression permanently halted its economic expansion . 
 Argentina abandoned the gold standard in December 1929 , earlier than most countries . For much of the previous period , the country had operated a currency board , in which a body known as the caja de <unk> was charged with maintaining the peso 's value in gold . The devaluation of the peso increased the competitiveness of its exports and protected domestic production . Argentina saw the value of its exports drop from $ 1 @,@ 537 million in 1929 to $ 561 million in 1932 , but this was by no means the most severe downturn in the region . 
 In response to the Great Depression , successive governments pursued a strategy designed to transform Argentina into a country self @-@ sufficient in industry as well as agriculture . The strategy of growth was based on import substitution in which tariffs and quotas for final goods were raised . The import @-@ substitution process had progressively been adopted since the late 19th century , but the Great Depression intensified it . The government 's encouragement of industrial growth diverted investment from agriculture , and agricultural production fell dramatically . 
 In 1930 the armed forces forced the Radicals from power and improved economic conditions , but political turbulence intensified . In 1932 , Argentina required immigrants to have a labour contract prior to arrival , or proof of financial means of support . The Roca @-@ Runciman Treaty of 1933 gave Argentina a quota of the British market for exports of its primary products , but the discriminatory British imperial tariffs and the effects of deflation in Britain actually led to a small decline of Argentine exports to Great Britain . 
 Unemployment resulting from the Great Depression caused unrest . The industrial growth spurt of the 1930s gradually slowed . The economic conditions of the 1930s contributed to the process of internal migration from the countryside and smaller towns to the cities , especially Buenos Aires , where there were greater opportunities for employment . The urban working classes led several unsuccessful uprisings prior to the 1937 presidential elections . Traditional export agriculture stagnated at the outbreak of World War II and remained sluggish .

 = = = First Peronist period : Nationalization = = = 
 After the 1943 Argentine coup d 'état , Juan Perón , a member of the United Officers Group that engineered the plot , became Minister of Labor . Campaigning among workers with promises of land , higher wages , and social security , he won a decisive victory in the 1946 presidential elections . Under Perón , the number of unionized workers expanded as he helped to establish the powerful General Confederation of Labor . Perón turned Argentina into a corporatist country in which powerful organized interest groups negotiated for positions and resources . During these years , Argentina developed the largest middle class on the South American continent . 
 Early Peronism was a period of macroeconomic shocks during which a strategy of import substitution industrialization was put into practice . Bilateral trade , exchange control and multiple exchange rates were its most important characteristics . The state 's role in the economy increased , reflected in the increase in state @-@ owned property , interventionism ( including control of rents and prices ) and higher levels of public inversion , mainly financed by the inflationary tax . The expansive macroeconomic policy , which aimed at the redistribution of wealth and the increase of spending to finance populist policies , led to inflation . 
 Wartime reserves enabled the Peronist government to fully pay off the external debt in 1952 ; by the end of the year , Argentina became creditor of US $ 5 @.@ 000 @.@ 000 @.@ 000 . Between 1946 and 1948 , the French and British @-@ owned railways were nationalized , and the existing networks were expanded , reaching 120 000 kilometers of rails by 1954 . The government also established the <unk> to control the foreign trade in export commodities . Perón erected a system of almost complete protection against imports , largely cutting off Argentina from the international market . In 1947 , he announced his first Five @-@ Year Plan based on growth of nationalized industries . <unk> also created a domestically oriented industry with high production costs , incapable of competing in international markets . At the same time , output of beef and grain , the country 's main export goods , stagnated . The <unk> began <unk> growers and , when world grain prices dropped in the late 1940s , it stifled agricultural production , exports and business sentiment , in general . Despite these shortcomings , protectionism and government credits did allow an exponential growth of the internal market : radio sales increased 600 % and fridge sales grew 218 % , among others . 
 During the first Five @-@ Year Plan , various public works and programs were executed , with the aim to modernize the country 's infrastructure . For example , a total of 22 <unk> power plants were erected , increasing electrical output from 45 000 kV in 1943 , to 350 000 kV in 1952 . Between 1947 and 1949 , a network of gas pipelines , which linked Comodoro Rivadavia with Buenos Aires , was built . The gas distribution reached 15 million m ³ , reducing costs by a third . 
 During this period Argentina 's economy continued to grow , on average , but more slowly than the world as a whole or than its neighbours , Brazil and Chile . A suggested cause is that a multitude of frequently changed regulations , at times extended to ridiculous specifics ( such as a 1947 decree setting prices and menus for restaurants ) , choked economic activity . The long @-@ term effect was to create pervasive disregard for the law , which Argentines came to view as a hindrance to earning a living rather than an aid to enforcing legitimate property rights . The combination of industrial protectionism , redistribution of income from the agrarian to the industrial sector , and growing state intervention in the economy sparked an inflationary process . By 1950 , Argentina 's GDP per capita accounted just nearly half of the United States . 
 Perón 's second Five @-@ Year Plan in 1952 favoured increased agricultural output over industrialization , but industrial growth and high wages in previous years had expanded the domestic demand for agrarian goods . During the 1950s , output of beef and grain fell , and the economy suffered . The policy shift toward agricultural production created a gap in income distribution , as the majority of those who worked in agriculture laboured on tiny plots , while the majority of the land was in large estates . Argentina signed trade agreements with Britain , the Soviet Union and Chile , slightly opening the market to international trade as Perón 's second economic plan sought to capitalize on the country 's comparative advantage in agriculture . 
 = = = Post @-@ Peron era and the 1960s = = = 
 In the 1950s and part of the 1960s , the country had a slow rate of growth in line with most Latin American countries , while most of the rest of the world enjoyed a golden era . Stagnation prevailed during this period , and the economy often found itself contracting , mostly the result of union strife . 
 Increasing economic wariness as the 1950s progressed became one of the leading causes for Perón 's downfall in the Revolución Libertadora of 1955 . 
 Arturo Frondizi won the 1958 presidential election in a landslide . In the same year he announced the beginning of the oil battle : a new attempt at import substitution which aimed to achieve self @-@ sufficiency in oil production by signing several contract with foreign companies for the mining and exploitation of oil . In 1960 , Argentina joined the Latin American Free Trade Association . Wage growth in the early 1960s pushed prices up . The inflation rate increased faster , and soon real wages fell . High inflation prompted a stabilization plan that included tighter monetary policy , a cut in public expenditures , and increases in taxes and utility prices . 
 Another coup in June 1966 , the so @-@ called Argentine Revolution , brought Juan Carlos <unk> to power . <unk> appointed Adalbert Krieger <unk> to head the Economy Ministry . His strategy implied a very active role for the public sector in guiding the process of economic growth , calling for state control over the money supply , wages and prices , and bank credit to the private sector . 
 Krieger 's tenure witnessed increased concentration and centralization of capital , coupled with privatisation of many important sectors of the economy . The international financial community offered strong support for this program , and economic growth continued . GDP expanded at an average annual rate of 5 @.@ 2 % between 1966 and 1970 , compared to 3 @.@ 2 % during the 1950s . 
 After 1966 , in a radical departure from past policies , the Ministry of Economy announced a programme to reduce rising inflation while promoting competition , efficiency , and foreign investment . The anti @-@ inflation programme focussed on controlling nominal wages and salaries . Inflation decreased sharply , decreasing from an annual rate of about 30 % in 1965 – 67 to 7 @.@ 6 % in 1969 . Unemployment remained low , but real wages fell . 
 A gradual reversal in trade policy culminated in the military announcing import substitution as a failed experiment , lifting protectionist barriers and opening the economy to the world market . This new policy boosted some exports , but an overvalued currency meant certain imports were so cheap that local industry declined , and many exports were priced out of the market . The Ministry of Economy put an end to the exchange rate policy of previous governments . The currency underwent a 30 % devaluation . 
 In May 1969 , discontent with Krieger 's economic policies led to riots in the cities of Corrientes , Rosario and Córdoba . Krieger was removed , but the <unk> administration was unable to agree on an alternative economic policy . By 1970 , the authorities were no longer capable of maintaining wage restraints , leading to a wage @-@ price spiral . As the economy started to languish and import substitution industrialization ran out of steam , urban migration slowed . Per capita income fell , and with it the standard of living . Perón ’ s third term of office was characterized by an expansive monetary policy , which resulted in an uncontrolled rise in the level of inflation . 
 = = Stagnation = = 
 Between 1975 and 1990 , real per capita income fell by more than 20 % , wiping out almost three decades of economic development . The manufacturing industry , which had experienced a period of uninterrupted growth until the mid @-@ 1970s , began a process of continuous decline . The extreme dependence on state support of the many protected industries exacerbated the sharp fall of the industrial output . The degree of industrialisation at the start of the 1990s was similar to its level in the 1940s . In the early 1970s , per capita income in Argentina was twice as high as in Mexico and more than three times as high as in Chile and Brazil . By 1990 , the difference in income between Argentina and the other Latin American countries was much smaller . 
 Starting with the <unk> in 1975 , inflation accelerated sharply , reaching an average of more than 300 % per year during the 1975 – 1991 period , increasing prices by a factor of 20 billion . 
 When Martinez de Hoz assumed power as finance minister prices in the previous month had increased at an annual rate of 5 @,@ 000 % and output had declined sharply . In 1976 , the era of import substitution was ended , and the government lowered import barriers , liberalized restrictions on foreign borrowing , and supported the peso against foreign currencies . This opening exposed the fact that domestic firms could not compete with foreign imports , in part because of the overvalued currency , but also because of long @-@ term structural problems . A financial reform was implemented that aimed to liberalize capital markets and link Argentina more effectively with the world capital market . 
 After the relatively stable years 1976 – 78 , fiscal <unk> started to climb again and the external debt tripled in three years . The increased debt burden interrupted industrial development and upward social mobility . Beginning in 1979 the rate of exchange depreciation was pre @-@ fixed with a <unk> , an active crawling peg based on a timetable which announced ahead of time a gradually declining rate of depreciation . These announcements were repeated on a rolling basis so as to create an environment where economic agents could discern a government commitment to deflation . Inflation responded to this policy and gradually fell throughout 1980 to below 100 % . But gradually , during 1978 and 1979 , the real exchange rate appreciated because inflation consistently outpaced the rate of depreciation . The <unk> ultimately led to capital flight and collapse of the financial system . 
 Growing government spending , large wage raises , and inefficient production created a chronic inflation that rose through the 1980s , when it briefly exceeded an annual rate of 1 @,@ 000 % . Successive regimes tried to control inflation through wage and price controls , cuts in public spending , and restriction of the money supply . Efforts to stem the problems came to naught when in 1982 Argentina came into <unk> with the United Kingdom over the Falkland Islands . 
 In August 1982 , after Mexico had announced its inability to service its debt , Argentina approached the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) for <unk> assistance , as it too was in serious difficulties . While developments looked positive for a while , an IMF staff team visiting Buenos Aires in August 1983 discovered a variety of problems , particularly a loss of control over wages affecting both the budget and external competitiveness , and the programme failed . With the peso quickly losing value to inflation , a new peso was introduced in 1983 , with 10 @,@ 000 old pesos exchanged for each new peso . 
 In December 1983 Raúl <unk> was elected President of Argentina , bringing to an end to the military dictatorship . Under <unk> , negotiations started on a new programme with the IMF , but they led to nothing . In March 1984 , Brazil , Colombia , Mexico and Venezuela lent Argentina $ 300 million for three months , followed by a similar amount by the United States , providing some breathing space as it was not before late September 1984 that an agreement was reached between the IMF and Argentina . 
 In 1985 the currency was <unk> again , with the Austral substituting the discredited peso . In 1986 , Argentina failed to pay the debt for several months until ultimately the debt was renegotiated with the creditor banks . During 1986 and 1987 the Austral Plan faded away , as ﬁscal policy was undermined by large off @-@ budget spending and a loose monetary policy , again falling out of compliance with an IMF programme . A new IMF arrangement was reached in July 1987 , only to collapse in March 1988 . 
 The next move by the authorities was to launch the Plan Primavera in August 1988 , consisting of a package of economically heterodox measures that foresaw little ﬁscal adjustment , and this time the IMF , in the absence of <unk> policies , refused to resume lending to Argentina . Six months after its introduction the Plan Primavera collapsed , leading to <unk> , and riots . 
 = = Free @-@ market reforms = = 
 The Peronist Carlos Menem was elected president in May 1989 . He immediately announced a new shock programme , this time with more ﬁscal adjustment in view of a government <unk> of 16 % of GDP . In November 1989 agreement was reached on yet another standby with the IMF , but again the arrangement was ended prematurely , followed by another bout of hyper @-@ <unk> , which reached 12 @,@ 000 % per year . 
 After the collapse of public enterprises during the late 1980s , privatisation became strongly popular . Menem privatised almost everything the state owned , except for a couple of banks . In terms of service there were indisputable improvements . For example , before the telephone privatisation , to get a new line it was not unusual to wait more than ten years , and apartments with telephone lines carried a big premium in the market . After privatisation the wait was reduced to less than a week . Productivity increased as investment modernised farms , factories and ports . However , in all cases , there were large outlays of employees . In addition , the process of privatisation was suspected of corruption in many cases . Ultimately , the privatised enterprises became private ( rather than public ) monopolies . Their tariffs on long @-@ term contracts were raised in line with American inflation , even though prices in Argentina were falling . 
 In 1991 , economy minister Domingo Cavallo set out to reverse Argentina 's decline through free @-@ market reforms such as open trade . On 1 January 1992 , a monetary reform replaced the austral with the peso at a rate of 10 @,@ 000 <unk> for 1 peso . The cornerstone of the reform process was a currency board , under which the peso was fixed by law at par to the dollar , and the money supply restricted to the level of hard @-@ currency reserves . After a lag , inflation was tamed . With risk of devaluation apparently removed , capital poured in from abroad . GDP growth increased significantly and total employment rose steadily until mid @-@ 1993 . During the second half of 1994 , the economy slowed down and unemployment increased from 10 % to 12 @.@ 2 % . 
 Although the economy was already in a mild recession at this point , conditions worsened substantially after the devaluation of the Mexican peso during December 1994 . The economy shrank by 4 % , and a dozen banks collapsed . With the labour force continuing to expand and employment falling sharply along with aggregate demand , unemployment rose by over 6 % in 6 months . But the government responded effectively : it tightened bank regulation and capital requirements , and encouraged foreign banks to take over weaker local ones . The economy soon recovered and , between 1996 and 1998 , both output and employment grew rapidly and unemployment declined substantially . However , at the beginning of 1999 , the Brazilian currency underwent a strong depreciation . The Argentine economy contracted 4 % in 1999 , and unemployment increased again . 
 Exports grew from $ 12 billion in 1991 to $ 27 billion in 2001 , but many industries could not compete abroad , especially after Brazil 's devaluation . The strong , fixed exchange rate turned the trade balance to a cumulative US $ 22 billion in deficits between 1992 and 1999 . Unable to devalue , Argentina could only become more competitive if prices fell . <unk> came from recession , falling wages and rising unemployment . Interest rates remained high , with banks lending dollars at 25 % . 
 The share of public spending in GDP increased from 27 % in 1995 to 30 % in 2000 . Some poorer provinces had depended on state enterprises or on inefficient industries , such as sugar , which could not compete when trade was opened . To quell social unrest , provincial governors padded their payrolls . The government had embarked on a pension reform with costs reaching 3 % of GDP in 2000 , as it still had to pay pensioners but no longer received contributions . 
 = = Economic crisis = = 
 Argentina fell into a deep recession in the second half of 1998 , triggered and then compounded by a series of adverse external shocks , which included low prices for agricultural commodities , the appreciation of the US dollar , to which the peso was pegged at par , the 1998 Russian financial crisis , the LTCM crisis and the devaluation of the Brazilian real in January 1999 . Argentina did not enjoy a rapid recovery , and the sluggishness of GDP growth fuelled concerns about the sustainability of public debt . 
 In December 1999 , President Fernando de la Rúa , seeking assistance from the IMF shortly thereafter . In March 2000 , the IMF agreed to a three @-@ year $ 7 @.@ 2 billion stand @-@ by arrangement with Argentina , conditioned on a strict fiscal adjustment and the assumption of 3 @.@ 5 % GDP growth in 2000 ( actual growth was 0 @.@ 5 % ) . In late 2000 , Argentina began to experience severely diminished access to capital markets , as reflected in a sharp and sustained rise in spreads on Argentine bonds over U.S. Treasuries . In December , The de la Rua government announced a $ 40 billion multilateral assistance package organized by IMF . The uneven implementation of fiscal adjustments and reforms , a worsening global macroeconomic environment , and political instability led to the complete loss of market access and intensified capital flight by the second quarter of 2001 . Argentine debt , held mostly in bonds , was massively sold short and the government found itself unable to borrow or meet debt payments . 
 In December 2001 , a series of deposit runs began to have a severe impact on the health of the banking system , leading the Argentine authorities to impose a partial deposit freeze . With Argentina no longer in compliance with the conditions of the expanded IMF @-@ supported program , the IMF decided to suspend disbursements . At the end of December , in a climate of severe political and social unrest , the country partially defaulted on its international obligations ; in January 2002 , it formally abandoned the convertibility regime . 
 The ensuing economic and political crisis was arguably the worst since the country 's independence . By the end of 2002 , the economy had contracted by 20 % since 1998 . Over the course of two years , output fell by more than 15 % , the Argentine peso lost three @-@ quarters of its value , and registered unemployment exceeded 25 % . Income poverty in Argentina grew from an already high 35 @.@ 4 % in October 2001 to a peak of 54 @.@ 3 % in October 2002 . 
 Critics of the policy of economic liberalization pursued during the Menem Presidency argued that Argentina 's economic woes were caused by neoliberalism , which had been actively promoted by the U.S. government and the IMF under the Washington Consensus . Others have stressed that the main shortcoming of economic policy @-@ making during the 1990s was that economic reform was not pursued with enough determination . A 2004 report by the IMF 's Independent Evaluation Office criticised the IMF 's conduct prior to Argentina 's economic collapse of 2001 , saying the IMF had supported the country 's fixed exchange rate for too long , and was too lenient towards fiscal deficits .

 In January 2002 Eduardo Duhalde was appointed president , becoming Argentina 's fifth president in two weeks . Roberto Lavagna , who became Minister of the Economy in April 2002 , was credited for the ensuing recovery of the economy , having stabilised prices and the exchange rate in a moment when Argentina was at risk of hyperinflation . Since the default in 2001 , growth has resumed , with the Argentine economy growing by over 6 % a year for seven of the eight years to 2011 . This was achieved in part because of a commodity price boom , and also because the government managed to keep the value of the currency low , boosting industrial exports . 
 = = = Kirchner administration = = = 
 Néstor Kirchner became president in May 2003 . In the mid @-@ 2000s , export of unprocessed soybeans and of soybean oil and meal generated more than 20 % of Argentina 's export revenue , triple the joint share of the traditional exports , beef and wheat . Export taxes comprised 8 % to 11 % of the Kirchner government 's total tax receipts , around two @-@ thirds of which came from soy exports . Taxes on imports and exports increased government spending from 14 % to 25 % of GDP . However , the import and export taxes have discouraged foreign investment , while high spending has pushed inflation over 20 % . 
 An attempt by the Kirchner administration to impose price controls in 2005 failed as the items most in demand went out of stock and the mandatory prices were in most cases not observed . Various sectors of the economy were re @-@ nationalised , including the national postal service ( 2003 ) , the San Martín Railway line ( 2004 ) , the water utility serving the Province of Buenos Aires ( 2006 ) and Aerolíneas Argentinas ( 2009 ) . 
 In December 2005 , Kirchner decided to liquidate the Argentine debt to the IMF in a single payment , without refinancing , for a total of $ 9 @.@ 8 billion . The payment was partly financed by Venezuela , who bought Argentine bonds for US $ 1 @.@ 6 billion . As of mid @-@ 2008 Venezuela hold an estimated US $ 6 billion in Argentine debt .

In 2008 the rural sector mobilized against a resolution that would have increased the export tax rate on soybean exports from 35 % to 44 @.@ 1 % . Ultimately , the new taxation regime was abandoned . Official Argentine statistics are believed to have significantly underreported inflation since 2007 , and independent economists publishing their own estimates of Argentine inflation have been threatened with fines and prosecution . 
 In October 2008 President Fernández de Kirchner nationalised private pension funds for almost $ 30 billion , ostensibly to protect the pensions from falling stock prices around the world , although critics said the government simply wanted to add the money to its budget . Private pension funds , which were first licensed in 1994 , suffered large losses during the 1998 – 2002 crisis and by 2008 , the state subsidized 77 % of the funds ' beneficiaries . 
 The late @-@ 2000s recession hit the country in 2009 with GDP growth slowing to 0 @.@ 8 % . High GDP growth resumed in 2010 , and the economy expanded by 8 @.@ 5 % . In April 2010 , Economy Minister Amado <unk> prepared a debt swap package for the holders of over US $ 18 billion in bonds who did not participate in the 2005 Argentine debt restructuring . In late 2010 , the largest new natural gas deposits in 35 years were discovered in Neuquén Province . The unemployment rate in the third quarter of 2011 was 7 @.@ 3 % . 
 In November 2011 , the government laid a plan to cut utilities subsidies to higher income households . By mid @-@ 2011 , credit was outpacing GDP by a wide margin , raising concerns that the economy was overheating . Argentina began a period of fiscal austerity in 2012 . In April 2012 , the government announced plans to expropriate YPF , despite the opposition of some energy experts , claiming that YPF 's Spanish partner and major holder , Repsol , had not done his duty as to provide the financial support for research and land exploitation , as well as being a bad administrator concerned only in sending profits to Spain and forsaking YPF 's economic growth . 
 Rising inflation and capital flight caused a rapid depletion of the country 's dollar reserves , prompting the government to severely curtail access to dollars in June 2012 . The imposition of capital controls , in turn , led to the emergence of a black market for dollars , known as the " <unk> blue " , at higher rates than the official exchange rate . 
 By May 2014 , private forecasts estimated annual inflation at 39 @.@ 9 % , one of the highest rates in the world . In July 2014 , a ruling from a New York court ordered the country to pay the remaining holders of the bonds defaulted in 2001 , which by then were mostly American Vulture funds , before it paid any of its exchange bondholders . The Argentine government refused , causing the country to default on its debt again . 
 = = Causes of progressive decline = = 
 The unique condition of Argentina , as a country which had achieved advanced development in the early 20th century but experienced a reversal , has inspired a wealth of literature and analyses on the causes of this progressive decline . The Nobel prize @-@ winning economist Simon Kuznets is said to have remarked that there were four types of countries : the developed , the underdeveloped , Japan and Argentina . 
 According to Di Tella and <unk> ( 1967 ) , the main difference between Argentina and other settler societies such as Australia and Canada was its failure to seek adequate alternatives to compensate for the end of geographical expansion with the definitive closing of the frontier . Solberg ( 1985 ) noted the differences between the land distribution in Canada , which led to a rising number of small farmers , and the small number of landowners each with large areas of land in Argentina . 
 Duncan and Fogarty ( 1984 ) argued that the key difference lies in the contrast between the stable , flexible government of Australia and the poor governance of Argentina . According to Platt and Di Tella ( 1985 ) the political tradition and immigration from different regions were the key factors , while Díaz Alejandro ( 1985 ) suggested that a restrictive immigration policy , similar to Australia ’ s , would have increased productivity encouraged by the relative scarcity of labour . 
 More recently , Taylor ( 1992 ) pointed that the relatively high dependency ratio and the slow demographic transition in Argentina led to a reliance on foreign capital to offset the resulting low savings rate . From the 1930s onwards , the accumulation of capital was hampered by the relatively high prices of ( mostly imported ) capital goods , which was caused by the industrial policy of import substitution , in contrast with the export @-@ led growth favoured by Canada . Other distorting factors behind the high relative prices of capital goods include the multiple exchange rates , the black market for foreign currencies , the depreciation of the national currency and high customs tariffs . This resulted in a lower capital intensity , which led to lower rates of labour productivity . 
 The ultimate cause of Argentina ’ s historical backwardness appears to be its institutional framework . In macroeconomic terms , Argentina was one of the most stable and conservative countries until the Great Depression , after which it turned into one of the most unstable .

 = Sakurai 's Object = 
 Sakurai 's Object ( <unk> Sgr ) is a star located in the constellation of Sagittarius . It is thought to have previously been a white dwarf that , as a result of a very late thermal pulse , swelled and became a red giant . It is located at the center of a planetary nebula and is believed to currently be in thermal instability and within its final shell helium flash phase . 
 At the time of its discovery , astronomers believed Sakurai 's Object to be a slow nova . Later spectroscopic analysis suggested that the star was not a nova , but had instead undergone a very late thermal pulse similar to that of V605 Aquilae , causing it to vastly expand . V605 Aquilae , which was discovered in 1919 , is the only other star known to have been observed during the high luminosity phase of a very late thermal pulse , and models predict that Sakurai 's Object , over the next few decades , will follow a similar life cycle . 
 Sakurai 's Object and other similar stars are expected to end up as helium @-@ rich white dwarfs after retracing their evolution track from the " born @-@ again " giant phase back to the white dwarf cooling track . There are few other suspected " born @-@ again " objects , one example being FG Sagittae . Having erupted in 1995 , it is expected that Sakurai 's Object 's final helium flash will be the first well @-@ observed one . 
 = = Observation history = = 
 An International Astronomical Union Circular sent on February 23 , 1996 announced the discovery of a " possible ' slow ' nova " of magnitude 11 @.@ 4 by Yukio Sakurai , an amateur astronomer . Japanese astronomer <unk> Nakano reported the discovery , drawing attention to the fact that the object had not been visible in images from 1993 nor in Harvard – Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics records for the years 1930 @-@ 1951 , despite it appearing to slowly brighten over the previous years . Nakano wrote that " While the outburst [ suggests ] a slow or symbiotic nova , the lack of obvious emission lines one year after brightening is very unusual . " 
 Following the initial announcement , Hilmar <unk> published a study investigating the " possible final helium flash " seen by Sakurai . In it , they noted that the location of Sakurai 's Object corresponded to a faint object detected in 1976 of magnitude 21 , and discussed other observations in the years 1994 – 1996 , by which time the magnitude had increased to around 11 – 15 . By investigating the measured fluxes , angular diameter , and mass of the nebula , a distance of <unk> and luminosity of 38 L ☉ was determined . The researchers noted that this was in agreement with their appearance and model predictions and that the outburst luminosity was in the area of 3100 solar luminosities ; lower than predicted by a factor of 3 . 
 The first infrared observations were published in 1998 , in which both near and far infrared spectroscopy data was presented . The collected data showed Sakurai 's Object 's steep brightening in 1996 , followed by a sharp decline in 1999 as expected . It was later found that the Star 's steep decline in light was due to the circumstellar dust located around the star , which was present at a temperature of ~ <unk> . Further infrared data recorded by the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope was published in 2000 , in which findings of the changing absorption lines were discussed . 
 Observations from the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope ( <unk> ) in 1999 revealed that the star is in a <unk> @-@ like phase with the release of dust and huge loss of mass . 
 Since 2005 , it has been observed in the ejected particles of Sakurai 's Object that photoionization of carbon is taking place . 
 = = Properties = = 
 Sakurai 's Object is a highly evolved post @-@ asymptotic giant branch star which has , following a brief period on the white dwarf cooling track , undergone a helium shell flash ( also known as a very late thermal pulse ) . The star is thought to have a mass of around 0 @.@ 6 M ☉ . Observations of Sakurai 's Object show increasing reddening and pulsing activity , suggesting that the star is exhibiting thermal instability during its final helium @-@ shell flash . 
 Prior to its <unk> <unk> Sgr is thought to have been cooling towards a white dwarf with a temperature around 100 @,@ 000 K and a luminosity around 100 L ☉ . The luminosity rapidly increased about a hundred @-@ fold and then the temperature decreased to around 10 @,@ 000 K. The star developed the appearance of an F class supergiant ( F2 Ia ) . The apparent temperature continued to cool to below 6 @,@ 000 K and the star was gradually obscured at optical wavelengths by the formation of carbon dust , similar to an R <unk> star . Since then the temperature has increased to around 20 @,@ 000 K. 
 The properties of Sakurai 's Object are quite similar to that of V605 Aquilae . V605 , discovered in 1919 , is the only other known star observed during the high luminosity phase of a very late thermal pulse , and Sakurai 's Object is modeled to increase in temperature in the next few decades to match the current state of V605 . 
 = = = Dust cloud = = = 
 During the second half of 1998 an optically thick dust shell obscured Sakurai 's Object , causing a rapid decrease in visibility of the star , until in 1999 it disappeared from optical wavelength observations altogether . Infrared observations showed that the dust cloud around the star is primarily carbon in an amorphous form . In 2009 it was discovered that the dust shell is strongly asymmetrical , as a disc with a major axis oriented at an angle of 134 ° , and inclination of around 75 ° . The disc is thought to be growing more opaque due to the fast spectral evolution of the source towards lower temperatures . 
 = = = Planetary nebula = = = 
 Sakurai 's Object is surrounded by a planetary nebula created following the star 's red giant phase around 8300 years ago . It has been determined that the nebula has a diameter of 44 arcseconds and expansion velocity of roughly 32 km / s . 
 = = = Similarities to other stars = = = 
 Research in 1996 revealed that Sakurai 's Object possessed the characteristics of a R Coronae Borealis variable star with the anomaly of Carbon @-@ 13 ( 13C ) deficit . Also , the metallicity of Sakurai 's object in 1996 was similar to that of V605 Aquilae in 1921 . However , it is expected that Sakurai 's object will grow in its metallicity to match that of V605 Aquilae . 
 = = Significance in astronomical research = = 
 A significant amount of new star formation and star destruction data is expected to be recorded from continued observation of Sakurai 's Object , as well as be used as reference data in the future research of similar stars . The reason that stars such as Sakurai 's Object and V605 Aquilae exist , as well as experience a shorter lifespan compared to most stars , is largely unknown . Sakurai 's Object and V605 Aquilae have been observed experiencing born @-@ again behavior for only 10 years , while FG Sagittae has undergone such behavior for 120 years . It is hypothesized that this is due to Sakurai 's Object and V605 Aquilae evolving to the asymptotic giant branch of stars for the first time , while FG Sagittae is undergoing the process a second time . 
 = Trembling Before G @-@ d = 
 Trembling Before G @-@ d is an 2001 American documentary film about gay and lesbian Orthodox Jews trying to reconcile their sexuality with their faith . It was directed by Sandi Simcha DuBowski , an American who wanted to compare Orthodox Jewish attitudes to homosexuality with his own upbringing as a gay Conservative Jew . 
 The film received ten award nominations , winning seven , including Best Documentary awards at the 2001 Berlin and Chicago film festivals . However , some criticized the film as showing a one @-@ sided view of Orthodox Judaism 's response to homosexuality . These include South African Chief Rabbi Warren Goldstein as well as <unk> spokesperson Avi Shafran . 
 The film is mostly in English , but also has some subtitled Yiddish and Hebrew . The film follows the lives of several gay and lesbian Orthodox Jews and includes interviews with rabbis and <unk> about Orthodox attitudes towards homosexuality . During the film 's six @-@ year production , DuBowski met hundreds of homosexual Jews , but only a handful agreed to be filmed due to fear of being ostracized from their communities . Many people who agreed to be interviewed are shown only in silhouette or with their faces <unk> . The majority of the participants are American Jews , with one British and one Israeli Jew also featured . The film was successful at the box office , grossing over $ 788 @,@ 896 on eight screens by its close date . 
 = = Background = = 
 While a variety of views regarding homosexuality exist within the Orthodox Jewish community , Orthodox Judaism generally prohibits homosexual conduct . While there is disagreement about which acts come under core prohibitions , all of Orthodox Judaism puts certain core homosexual acts , including male @-@ male anal sex , in the category of <unk> ve 'al ya <unk> , " die rather than transgress " – the small category of Biblically prohibited acts ( including apostasy , murder , idolatry , adultery , and incest ) which an Orthodox Jew is obligated under Jewish laws on self @-@ sacrifice to die rather than commit . 
 <unk> with sociological and biological studies , as well as personal contact with Jewish homosexuals , has brought some Orthodox leaders to a more sympathetic viewpoint , which views homosexuals as mentally ill rather than rebellious and advocates treatment rather than ostracism or jail . In the 1974 yearbook of the Encyclopedia Judaica , Rabbi Norman Lamm , a leader in Modern Orthodox Judaism , urged sympathy and treatment : " Judaism allows for no compromise in its abhorrence of sodomy , but encourages both compassion and efforts at rehabilitation . " Lamm compared homosexuals to those who attempt suicide ( also a sin in Jewish law ) , arguing that in both cases it would be irresponsible to shun or jail the sinner , but equally wrong for society to give " open or even tacit approval " . 
 When Orthodox rabbi Steven Greenberg publicly announced that he was homosexual , Rabbi Moshe <unk> , a leading rabbi at the Modern Orthodox Yeshiva University where Greenberg was ordained as rabbi , stated " It is very sad that an individual who attended our yeshiva sunk to the depths of what we consider a depraved society , " giving his opinion that Rabbi Greenberg 's announcement is " the exact same as if he said , ' I 'm an Orthodox Rabbi and I eat ham sandwiches on Yom Kippur . ' What you are is a Reform Rabbi . " 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 Trembling Before G @-@ d interviews and follows several gay and lesbian Orthodox Jews , many only seen in silhouette , and also interviews several rabbis and psychologists regarding their views on homosexuality in Orthodox Judaism . The film repeatedly returns to several characters : 
 David is an observant Orthodox Jewish doctor from Los Angeles who has spent a decade trying to reconcile his homosexuality with Judaism . He has tried numerous forms of " treatment " , from eating figs and praying to wearing a rubber band on his wrist to flick whenever he thinks of men , but to no avail . During the course of the film , David decides to visit the Chabad rabbi to whom he first came out . 
 Israel is a 58 @-@ year @-@ old New Yorker who decided he couldn 't be gay and Orthodox , and turned his back on his religion , though not before his family forced him into electroshock therapy to try to cure him . Now a tour guide in the Haredi neighborhoods of New York , the film follows him as he gives a tour , <unk> himself and decides , on the 25th anniversary of being with his life partner , to call his 98 @-@ year @-@ old father , a rabbi , whom he has not seen in over twenty years . 
 Michelle is another New Yorker , in her forties , who believed she was the only Hasidic lesbian in the world and as a consequence allowed herself to be pressured into marriage . However , she got divorced and was subsequently ostracized by her family and community when they discovered she was homosexual . The film shows her visiting her old neighborhood and an Orthodox fair . 
 Rabbi Steven Greenberg , one of the founding members of the Jerusalem Open House , a gay rights organization in Israel which provides support to gay Orthodox Jews and their families , who is sometimes called " the world ’ s first openly gay Orthodox rabbi " , discusses parents ' reactions to their children coming out , as well as traditional interpretations of the prohibitions on homosexual acts in the Torah . 
 Shlomo Ashkenazy is a gay psychotherapist who has run a confidential support group for Orthodox gay men for nearly 20 years . He is interviewed about the effects of Orthodox attitudes to homosexuality and the reactions of rabbis to gay Jews . 
 Mark is the English son of a Haredi rabbi . Coming out at 15 , he was expelled from seven yeshivas for homosexual activity before becoming a drag queen , and is now dying of AIDS @-@ related illness . He visits several yeshivas and other religious sites throughout the film . He remains upbeat , at one point saying , " Being a Jew is such a nice present to receive . " 
 " Malka " and " Leah " are two observant Orthodox lesbians who have been together for ten years , which has destroyed Malka 's relationship with her family . They speak frankly about their lives in the film and discuss their fears that they may not end up in heaven together . They are shown preparing for Shabbat , and Leah gives advice to a married Hasidic lesbian who is terrified her husband will find out and take away her children . 
 " <unk> " is a married Hasidic lesbian living in Israel . She only appears in silhouette with an electronically modified voice . She considered her twenty @-@ year @-@ long marriage a lie , and can only cope by taking antidepressants . The film follows her as she attends her first gay pride parade , where she is offended by the anti @-@ Orthodox sentiment of its speakers . 
 = = Production = = 
 Sandi Simcha DuBowski was making videos about the Christian religious right when he began to examine his own upbringing as a gay Conservative Jew , and began making a personal video diary of his search for homosexuality among the Orthodox Jewish community . On the making of the film , DuBowski said , " I don 't think it was until I met people who were kicked out of their families and their <unk> , in marriages betraying their spouses , that it became clear why I was doing this film . But then , for me it assumed an enormous level of responsibility to the people I met , to the issue , to the community . " He met thousands of people , but only a few agreed to appear in the film , as most were too frightened of being expelled from their community . Even when interviewing those who did agree to appear , DuBowski had to hide his film equipment so their neighbors would not know that they had agreed to take part . As a result , the documentary took six years to complete . 
 There is no narration , and the film may be considered to be an example of cinéma vérité . The film is also interspersed with silhouetted tableaus of Jewish religious practices , for example Shabbat . The language is predominantly English , with passages in Yiddish and Hebrew that are subtitled . Also subtitled are passages with significant amounts of " <unk> " , Yiddish @-@ influenced technical terms in Judaism ; for example , <unk> is translated as " judge on Jewish law " , and <unk> is translated as " pray " . 
 The title is an allusion to the word Haredi ( Hebrew : <unk> ) , which can be interpreted as " one who trembles " in awe of God . The spelling of the word G @-@ d in the film 's title reflects the Jewish practice of avoiding writing a name of God . By omitting the middle letter , the word is not written in full , thus eliminating the possibility of accidentally destroying the written name of God , which would violate one of the 613 <unk> of Judaism ( number 8 on Maimonides ' list ) .

 Trembling Before G @-@ d has had a wide impact especially within the Orthodox Jewish world , where the reception has been mixed . Several Orthodox synagogues sponsored showings of the film all over the world , including in Israel . The Chief Rabbi of South Africa , Warren Goldstein , described the film as " intellectually shallow , " commenting that " its one @-@ sided caricature of Orthodox Judaism does not stimulate meaningful intellectual debate . " A rabbi interviewed by DuBowski complained that the film " makes us appear to be narrow and bigoted " . Arthur A. Goldberg , co @-@ director of the Jewish ex @-@ gay organization <unk> , wrote a letter to the editor of The Jerusalem Post lamenting the " film 's biased and faulty assumption that same @-@ sex attraction and behavior is irreversible " and that " opposing points of view were , in the reviewer 's words , left ' lying on DuBowski 's cutting room floor . ' " Orthodox clinical psychologist Adam Jessel commented that , " the film poignantly captures the torment of those torn between their religious beliefs and their same @-@ sex attractions ( SSA ) . One cannot help but feel compassion for DuBowski 's interviewees who desperately miss the lifestyle , community and close family ties of the Orthodox world . Unfortunately , DuBowski 's film goes further . Implicit in the film is the message that homosexuality is desirable , and that the interviewees ' only struggle is having their choices accepted and validated by the community . " 
 No Haredi Orthodox group spoke out in favor of Trembling Before G @-@ d . Rabbi Avi Shafran , the spokesperson for Agudath Israel of America , one of the largest Haredi organizations , criticized the film with an article titled " <unk> Before G @-@ d " . In his response , he holds that gay people can be cured through therapy , and that the movie is meant to promote homosexuality : 
 Unfortunately , though , " Trembling " seems to have other intents as well . While it never baldly advocates the case for broader societal acceptance of homosexuality or for the abandonment of elements of the Jewish religious tradition , those causes are subtly evident in the stark , simplistic picture the film presents of sincere , conflicted and victimized men and women confronted by a largely stern and stubborn cadre of rabbis . That picture is both incomplete and distorted . For starters , the film refuses to even allow for the possibility that men and women with homosexual predilections might ― with great effort , to be sure ― achieve successful and happy marriages to members of the opposite sex . 
 DuBowski maintains that there is no agenda to Trembling Before G @-@ d " beyond alleviating an immense amount of pain that people are going through " , and that Judaism is lovingly portrayed . Indeed , several audience members at screenings asked afterwards how they could convert .

 The DVD was released in 2003 and contains many extra features , such as extensive interviews with DuBowski and Rabbi Steven Greenberg . There is also a mini @-@ documentary about reactions to the film around the world and what happened to the people who were featured in the documentary . The total running time for the special features is actually over 2 hours longer than the documentary itself . 
 With a seed grant from Steven Spielberg , the creators of the film have set up the Trembling Before G @-@ d Orthodox Education Project , to teach Orthodox educators and rabbis about homosexuality , as well as convening the first Orthodox Mental Health Conference on Homosexuality and training facilitators to show the film to community leaders . Over 2000 principals , educators and school counselors have attended screenings within Israel 's religious school system . The film has now been seen by an estimated 8 million people worldwide . Following the success of Trembling before G @-@ d , DuBowski produced a documentary about gay devout Muslims entitled A Jihad for Love . 
 = Doctor Who Prom ( 2008 ) = 
 Prom 13 : Doctor Who Prom was a concert showcasing incidental music from the British science fiction television series Doctor Who , along with classical music , performed on 27 July 2008 in the Royal Albert Hall in London as part of the BBC 's annual Proms series of concerts . The Doctor Who Prom was the thirteenth concert in the 2008 Proms season , and was intended to introduce young children to the Proms . 
 The Doctor Who Prom showcased the work of Murray Gold , who has composed the incidental music for Doctor Who since its return in 2005 . Other classical pieces were also played . The concert was conducted by Ben Foster and Stephen Bell , and performed by the BBC Philharmonic . It was presented by actress Freema Agyeman , who played companion Martha Jones on Doctor Who . Other Doctor Who actors and performers dressed as Doctor Who monsters also made appearances on stage and in the audience . The concert included video montages of scenes from Doctor Who and a specially filmed " mini @-@ episode " of Doctor Who called " Music of the Spheres " , which was presented on a screen above the orchestra and included live interactive elements . 
 The Doctor Who Prom was broadcast live on BBC Radio 3 and recorded for subsequent television broadcast on BBC One on 1 January 2009 . It was positively reviewed in several newspapers . 
 The success of the 2008 Prom led to more Doctor Who Proms for the 2010 and 2013 Proms seasons .

 In 2006 , the Doctor Who production team had presented a concert titled " Doctor Who : A Celebration " at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff , as a fundraiser for Children in Need . The success of that concert encouraged Doctor Who producer Julie Gardner and David Jackson ( then Head of Music at BBC Wales ) to meet the Director of the BBC Proms , Roger Wright , and suggest a Doctor Who @-@ themed Proms concert . The Doctor Who Prom replaced the Blue Peter Prom , which had been held from 1998 to 2007 . 
 The Doctor Who Prom was part of an ongoing drive to make the Proms more accessible and inclusive . Some critics accused Wright of " dumbing down " the Proms , against which Wright defended the programme , pointing out that " we 're hosting a concert for families that include pieces by Holst , Wagner and Prokofiev . " 
 Gardner and Doctor Who producer Russell T Davies decided to create a " mini @-@ episode " of Doctor Who to be shown during the concert , in part because actor David Tennant , who played the Doctor , was unable to participate in the live concert due to his commitments to the Royal Shakespeare Company 's production of Hamlet . Davies incorporated interactive elements into his script to ensure that the live performance was " an event " : 
 You can watch it later on the website , or on YouTube , or whatever , but frankly , you 'll never know what it was really like unless you are in the Albert Hall on that day . It can never be captured again . And that 's a reward for people who buy tickets and queue and travel . 
 The official price for pre @-@ booked tickets was £ 10 for adults and £ 5 for children . These tickets sold out , and 3 @,@ 000 people signed up for a waiting list in the event of any cancellations . Prior to the concert , tickets were touted on eBay for up to £ 250 . As at all Proms concerts , 500 tickets were sold for £ 5 on the day of the event . The queue for £ 5 tickets for the Doctor Who Prom began at 5 : 00 in the morning . 6 @,@ 000 people attended the sold @-@ out concert . The audience included many families with children , as well as older Doctor Who fans . The Times described the concert as the " most over @-@ subscribed concert " of the Proms season .

 In addition to the Doctor Who music by Murray Gold , several classical pieces were included in the concert , including one piece which had its United Kingdom début . Julie Gardner told Doctor Who Magazine that the concert 's planners considered a theme of " time and space " to tie in with Doctor Who , but decided that this " would lead to using the big sci @-@ fi tracks from the likes of 2001 , which would make the concert feel too much like a ' film and TV soundtrack day ' . " Instead , the producers chose " the Doctor 's love of humanity " as a theme , and selected pieces which they felt connected with that theme .

 The concert was conducted by Ben Foster and Stephen Bell , featuring the BBC Philharmonic and the London Philharmonic Choir , with solo performances by Tim Phillips and Melanie Pappenheim . Foster also arranged Gold 's compositions for the performance . Freema Agyeman , who played Martha Jones in the third and fourth series of Doctor Who , presented the programme with guests Noel Clarke and Camille Coduri , who respectively played Mickey Smith and Jackie Tyler in the first , second and fourth series of the television programme . Catherine Tate , who played the Doctor 's companion Donna Noble in the 2006 Doctor Who Christmas special and the fourth series of the programme , made a surprise guest appearance to introduce " Donna 's Theme " , not having been listed as being a presenter in the lineup . Sarah Walker presented BBC Radio 3 's coverage of the concert . 
 The full concert was rehearsed on Saturday , 26 July , the day before the performance . ( At the 2006 Children in Need concert in Cardiff , a dress rehearsal had been attempted on the day of the performance , but there was only time to run half of the show . ) The staging included the TARDIS prop centre stage , next to the bust of Henry Wood ; a wall bearing the graffiti " Bad Wolf " was placed behind the police box and the bust . 
 The monsters and aliens who appeared on stage and in the audience were played by artists who had portrayed them on television , including Dan Starkey as the Sontaran Commander <unk> ( a role he had played in the 2008 episodes " The Sontaran Strategem " and " The Poison Sky " ) . In the plot of the mini @-@ episode " Music of the Spheres " , a space @-@ time portal opened from the interior of the Doctor 's TARDIS to the Royal Albert Hall . During the episode , both the alien Graske and the Doctor 's musical composition " fell " through the portal . Actor Jimmy Vee appeared on stage as the Graske , and sheets of music manuscript paper dropped onto the orchestra from the <unk> above the stage . Prior to the piece " Davros and the Daleks " , a Dalek ( operated by Barnaby Edwards , voiced by Nicholas Briggs ) appeared on stage , and Davros appeared in the audience , announcing that the Royal Albert Hall would become his new palace , and the audience his " obedient slaves " . Julian Bleach , who had played Davros in the 2008 television episodes " The Stolen Earth " and " Journey 's End " , reprised his role under Davros ' heavy makeup for the concert .

 The Doctor Who Prom was broadcast live on BBC Radio 3 . BBC Radio 3 's recording of the concert could be streamed or downloaded via BBC iPlayer for a week after transmission and the concert was recorded for later television showing on BBC One . 
 During the interval of the concert , BBC Radio 3 broadcast " Let 's Do the Time Warp Again " , a 25 @-@ minute commentary by science fiction writer Justina Robson . In the essay , Robson discussed the moral contradictions of Doctor Who and compared the programme with religious texts as a cultural touchstone . 
 Highlights of the concert were televised on BBC One and BBC HD on 1 January 2009 , and were also made available on digital television via the " Red Button " . The television broadcast included " Concert Prologue " , " All the Strange , Strange Creatures " , " The Doctor Forever " , " Rose " and " Martha vs The Master " ; the mini @-@ episode " Music of the Spheres " ( with audience reactions ) ; " The Daleks and Davros " , " Donna " / " The Girl in the Fireplace " / " Astrid " , " This is Gallifrey " , " Doomsday " , " The Doctor 's Theme / Song of Freedom " and the " Doctor Who Theme .

 Writing in The Times , Caitlin Moran called the event " the hottest ticket in town this week , " and added , " As a child ’ s introduction to orchestral recitals , it is peerless . " Moran also noted " a moment of <unk> shame " at the realisation that composer Murray Gold has not won a BAFTA . Matthew Rye of the Daily Telegraph called the production " fluently staged " and called Gold 's music " evocative " ; he also described " The Torino Scale " as " a visceral miniature " . 
 Bruce Dessau , writing in the Evening Standard , felt that the classical compositions " jostled for attention " with Gold 's work , and called " The Torino Scale " " cacophonous " . Of the Doctor Who pieces , Dessau singled out soloist Melanie Pappenheim for her performance of Doomsday describing it as " haunting " and that it " hoisted the emotional level to a peak unsurpassed even when the team saved Earth , accompanied by the soaring Song Of Freedom . " Dessau 's sole complaint was that the concert gave insufficient attention to the work of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop , and that the programme 's conclusion with the Doctor Who theme " felt more like an afterthought than a climax . " 
 In The Guardian , Nicholas Lezard praised the idea behind the concert : " One can imagine no better way to get children interested in classical music than by <unk> them down in front of an orchestra belting out music from Doctor Who . " Lezard noted that the non @-@ Doctor Who music " was received with baffled tolerance " ; he said that the BBC Philharmonic played " Montagues and Capulets " " crisply and excitingly " , but felt that " Ride of the Valkyries " " tends to sound a little underpowered unless played by two orchestras at once " . Lezard called Gold 's work " a little derivative " but " perfectly suited to the task " ; however , he complained that Gold 's orchestration of the Doctor Who theme " drowned " Delia Derbyshire 's original arrangement . He wrote that " the hundred @-@ strong choir and soloist Melanie Pappenheim performed flawlessly , " and also praised the technical execution of the complex programme . 
 In a review of the Doctor Who Series 4 soundtrack , Abigail Sanderson mentioned that although some had objected to the Doctor Who Prom , even " fearsome critics " agreed that it " was an excellent forum for introducing younger listeners to concert music . " 
 Covering the event for Doctor Who Magazine , David Darlington noted that the stated aim of the Proms is " to encourage an audience for concert hall music who , though not normally attending classical concerts , would be attracted by the low ticket prices and informal atmosphere " and concluded that if the children in the audience had such a love for Doctor Who " that they have come all this way to spend an hour or two listening to the music from the show , and that they will happily also sit through a formal , experimental and rather abrasive piece of modern classical music and then enthusiastically applaud at the end , then all concerned can be happy with their day 's work . " 
 Michael Beek , who wrote the programme notes for the concert , called it " a very theatrical experience " , but suggested that it was " a small shame " that the BBC National Orchestra of Wales , who record the music for the television programme , had not been invited to perform . Beek also said that the performance of " Song for Ten " by original vocalist Tim Phillips " left a lot to be desired " . 
 Reviewing the highlights from the concert shown on television , Paul Byrne of Dublin 's Evening Herald called the concert " a delightfully silly idea " with an " irresistible charm " . Anna Lowman of TV Scoop noted that some of the power of the featured Doctor Who music came from the audience associating the themes with powerful scenes from the television series . She added , " It was a joy to watch it on the TV , so I can only imagine that it was magical to be there on the night itself . " 
 Writing in the Daily Telegraph , Gillian Reynolds listed the Doctor Who Prom as one of several successful elements in the 2008 Proms season . Jenny <unk> , the BBC 's former Director of Audio and Music , praised Proms director Roger Wright " for creating such a wonderful and exciting event that clearly grabbed children 's imagination . " Anna Picard , music correspondent for The Independent , included the Doctor Who Prom as a highlight in her year @-@ end review of classical music in 2008 . However , by April 2009 a journalist for The Sunday Times said that " there have been complaints that the Proms need no more gimmicks – such as David Tennant hosting a Doctor Who prom for children last year " ( although Tennant did not host the Prom ) .
