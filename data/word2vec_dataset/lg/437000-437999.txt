 The bucentaur ( / <unk> / <unk> @-@ SEN @-@ tor ; bucintoro in Italian and Venetian ) was the state barge of the doges of Venice . It was used every year on Ascension Day up to 1798 to take the doge out to the Adriatic Sea to perform the " Marriage of the Sea " – a ceremony that symbolically wedded Venice to the sea every year on the " Festa della <unk> " ( Ascension Day ) . 
 Scholars believe there were four major barges , the first significant bucentaur having been built in 1311 . The last and most magnificent of the historic bucentaurs made its maiden voyage in 1729 in the reign of Doge Alvise III Sebastiano Mocenigo . Depicted in paintings by Canaletto and Francesco <unk> , the ship was 35 m ( 115 ft ) long and more than 8 metres ( 26 ft ) high . A two @-@ deck floating palace , its main salon had a seating capacity of 90 . The doge 's throne was in the stern , and the prow bore a figurehead representing Justice with sword and scales . The barge was propelled by 168 oarsmen , and another 40 sailors were required to man it . The ship was destroyed in 1798 on Napoleon 's orders to symbolize his victory in conquering Venice . 
 In February 2008 , the Fondazione Bucintoro announced a € 20 million project to rebuild the 1729 bucentaur . Work started on 15 March 2008 at the Arsenale shipyard and naval dock . 
 = = Origin of the name = = 
 The origin of the name bucintoro is obscure , but one possibility is that it is derived from the Venetian <unk> , a traditional term for a lagoon vessel , and in oro , meaning covered in gold . On the other hand , man of letters Francesco Sansovino ( 1521 – 1586 ) proposed , based on documents dating from 1293 , that it was named after an earlier boat built at the Arsenale shipyard called the <unk> <unk> <unk> ( Of Two Hundred Naval Men ) . It has also been suggested that the vessel was named after the ship Centaurus referred to by Virgil when describing the funeral rites observed by Aeneas to honour his father 's death ; the bucentaur was twice the size of the ship mentioned in the Aeneid . The name may also refer to trumpets and horns that were played on board . The term bucintoro was Latinized in the Middle Ages as <unk> on the analogy of an alleged Greek word <unk> ( <unk> ) meaning " ox @-@ centaur " , from <unk> ( <unk> , " ox " ) and <unk> ( <unk> , " centaur " ) . The common supposition was that the name derived from a creature of a man with the head of an ox , a figure of which served as the barge 's figurehead . This derivation is , however , fanciful ; the word <unk> is unknown in Greek mythology , and representations of the " figurehead " of the bucentaurs in fact depict the lion of St. Mark the Evangelist . 
 The name " bucentaur " seems , indeed , to have been given to any great and sumptuous Venetian vessels . Du Cange quotes from the chronicle of the Doge Andrea Dandolo ( reigned 1343 – 1354 ) : " ... cum uno <unk> et <unk> <unk> , super quo <unk> usque ad S. <unk> , quo jam <unk> <unk> et <unk> <unk> cum <unk> , & c [ ... with a well @-@ wrought and stately Bucentaur , upon which he came to San Clemente , where a more important and more stately Bucentaur had already arrived with his advisors , etc . ... ] " . 
 The term was also used to describe a 16th @-@ century sumptuous transport boat , built and decorated in Modena , to celebrate the marriage of Lucrezia , the daughter of Ercole II d 'Este , Duke of Ferrara , to the Duke of Urbino .

 Before the age of the bucentaurs , it is probable that for ceremonies in the Venetian Lagoon the doge was simply assigned a small galley from the Venetian fleet . As Venice 's wealth increased due to its naval power , plans were made for a special ship to be built . This is evidenced by the <unk> – sacramental pledges spoken by the doges when they were sworn into office – of <unk> Zeno of 1252 , Lorenzo Tiepolo of 1268 and Giovanni Soranzo of 1312 which mention the construction of a bucentaur in the Arsenale shipyard and naval depot . 
 = = = The 1311 bucentaur = = = 
 Historians agree that four major barges were built . While there are believed to have been earlier vessels , the bucentaur of 1311 is regarded as the first significant one , for on 17 August 1311 the <unk> was amended to add the statement " quod <unk> Domini <unk> fiat per <unk> et <unk> in <unk> " ( " ... that a Bucentaur should be made for the Lord Doge for his rule , and it should be held in the Arsenale " ) . This was the first time that Venetian law had provided that the expense of building the bucentaur was to be borne by the public budget . The two @-@ decked bucentaur had a <unk> ( canopy ) with two sections , one in purple velvet for the doge , the other in red velvet for Venetian nobles . The historian Marino Sanuto the Younger , in his work De origine , situ et <unk> <unk> <unk> ( On the Origin , Site and Officials of the City of Venice ) , also described the ship as bearing a sculpture of Justice . 
 The bucentaur was used not only for the Marriage of the Sea ceremony , but also for other state functions such as festivals celebrating the Virgin Mary and the bearing of newly crowned <unk> ( the wives of doges ) to the Doge 's Palace . On 6 May 1401 , a law was passed to prohibit the doge from making private use of the bucentaur . 
 Documents mention the construction of another bucentaur in 1449 larger than the 1311 one , but little is known about this vessel . The earliest known image of a bucentaur appeared in Jacopo de ' Barbari 's monumental woodcut Pianta di Venezia ( Map of Venice ) which was published in 1500 . This work pictured a bucentaur afloat in the Arsenale without oars or decoration save for a large wooden sculpture of Justice in the bow . A similar illustration was produced by Andrea <unk> between 1517 and 1525 . 
 = = = The 1526 bucentaur = = = 
 On 10 May 1526 , Marino Sanuto the Younger recorded that on " Ascension Day the <unk> [ the Most Serene One – the doge ] went in the new bucintoro to wed the sea " , adding that " it was a beautiful work , larger and wider than the other one " . The proportions and rich decoration of this Bucentaur , built in the reign of Doge Andrea Gritti , became the model for successive versions of the ship . It had two decks and 42 oars , and was adorned with figures of lions with a sculpture of Justice at the prow ( preserved in the Museum of Naval History in Venice ) . The movable canopy of the vessel was covered with red fabric on the outside , and blue fabric with gold stars inside . 
 This bucentaur was frequently referred to in Venetian chronicles . It was on the ship that on 15 July 1547 Henry II of France was conveyed with the doge down the Grand Canal to the Ca ' Foscari where he stayed during his visit to Venice . The ship was also used to transport the newly crowned <unk> <unk> Morosini @-@ Grimani to the Doge 's Palace on 4 May 1597 . This event was the subject of numerous etchings and paintings by Giacomo Franco , Andrea Vicentino , Sebastian <unk> and anonymous artists . 
 = = = The 1606 bucentaur = = = 
 Despite Venice 's economic and maritime decline , in 1601 at the behest of the Doge Marino Grimani , the Venetian Senate decided to have a new bucentaur built at the cost of 70 @,@ 000 ducats ; although the existing one was still in service , experts regarded it as too old . The designer of the new ship is unknown , but he was selected from among the most qualified <unk> ( ships ' carpenters ) of the Arsenale . The work was supervised by Marco Antonio <unk> , the <unk> ( overseer of the provveditore ) of the Arsenale . The new vessel was approved and praised by all on its maiden voyage to the Lido with the newly elected Doge Leonardo Donato on Ascension Day , 10 May 1606 . 
 The third barge was modelled after its predecessors , its decorations influenced by late @-@ Renaissance forms . Contemporary illustrations show that the sides of the bucentaur were covered by mythical figures of sirens riding seahorses , and that the loggias were supported by curved dolphins amongst intertwined garlands and scrollwork taking on the form of monstrous hydras extending from the ends of the two bow spurs . It was once believed that most of the wooden sculptures , including a large sculpture of Mars , two lions of St. Mark positioned on either side of the stern , and the figurehead of Justice ( dressed in apparel made by the San Daniele Monastery ) , were the work of the renowned Venetian sculptor Alessandro Vittoria , but research has revealed the names of the brothers Agostino and Marcantonio <unk> of Bassano who were praised as " authors of carvings of marvellous beauty " . After more than a century of service , in 1719 a decision was made to demolish the ship . 
 = = = The 1727 bucentaur = = = 
 The last and most magnificent of the historic bucentaurs was commissioned by the Senate in 1719 , and the construction of it began in the Arsenale in 1722 . The ship was designed by Michele Stefano Conti , the <unk> dei <unk> ( head master of the ships ' carpenters ) . Wooden sculpting work was assigned to Antonio <unk> , as was testified by the phrase " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " ( " invention of the sculptor Antonio <unk> " ) inscribed near the bow palmette . He was an established sculptor , having already worked on commissions in Austria , Bohemia and Saxony . The gilding , in pure gold leaf , was handled by one <unk> D <unk> . Some of the 1606 ship 's ornaments and sculptures , including the sculpture of Mars and the two lions of St. Mark , were salvaged and reused . The vessel was 35 m ( 115 ft ) long and more than 8 metres ( 26 ft ) high . A two @-@ deck floating palace , its main salon was covered in red velvet , had 48 windows set in a huge , elaborately carved baldacchino or canopy , and had a seating capacity of 90 . The doge 's throne was in the stern , and the prow bore the traditional figurehead representing Justice with sword and scales . The barge was propelled by 168 oarsmen rowing in teams of four on its 42 oars each 11 metres ( 36 ft ) in length ; another 40 sailors were required to man it . Only the most handsome and sturdy youths of the Arsenale were selected for the ship 's crew . The new bucentaur made its début on Ascension Day 1729 in the reign of Doge Alvise III Sebastiano Mocenigo . The event was officially recorded , and the splendour of the vessel praised with sonnets and publications such as that by Antonio Maria <unk> entitled La Nuova regia su l <unk> nel Bucintoro <unk> <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> del giorno dell <unk> di Nostro Signore ( The New Palace upon the Waters of the Newly Built Bucentaur at the Annual Solemn Function of the Day of the Ascension of Our Lord , 1751 ) . 
 The German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe , in his work <unk> Reise ( Italian Journey , 1816 – 1817 ) which was an account of his travels in Italy between 1786 and 1787 , described the bucentaur on 5 October 1786 in these terms : 
 Um mit einem Worte den <unk> des Bucentaur <unk> , <unk> ich ihn eine <unk> . Der <unk> , von dem wir noch Abbildungen haben , <unk> diese <unk> noch mehr als der <unk> , der uns durch seinen Glanz über seinen Ursprung <unk> . ... 
 Ich <unk> immer auf mein Altes zurück . Wenn dem <unk> ein <unk> <unk> <unk> ist , so kann er <unk> <unk> <unk> . Hier war ihm <unk> , eine <unk> zu <unk> , die <unk> <unk> , die <unk> der Republik am <unk> Tage zum <unk> ihrer <unk> <unk> zu <unk> , und diese <unk> ist <unk> <unk> . Das Schiff ist ganz <unk> , also <unk> man nicht sagen : mit <unk> <unk> , ganz <unk> <unk> , <unk> zu <unk> <unk> , eine <unk> <unk> , um dem <unk> seine <unk> recht herrlich zu <unk> . <unk> wir doch : das Volk , wie es <unk> seine <unk> <unk> , will auch seine <unk> <unk> und <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> ist ein <unk> <unk> , <unk> man <unk> kann , was die <unk> <unk> und sich zu sein <unk> . 
 [ In order to express the concept of the Bucentaur with one word , I call it a <unk> [ magnificent galley ] . The older one , of which we still have illustrations , justifies this designation even more than the present one , as we are dazzled by the glare of its origin . ... 
 I always return to my old theme . If a genuine object is given to the artist , then he can achieve something genuine . Here was laid on him the responsibility of constructing a galley worthy of carrying the heads of the Republic on the most solemn day to consecrate their traditional dominion over the sea , and this task is carried out excellently . The ship is itself an ornament ; therefore one may not say that it is overloaded with ornaments , and only a mass of gilded carvings that are otherwise useless . In reality it is a monstrance , in order to show the people that their leaders are indeed wonderful . Nevertheless , we know this : the people , who are fond of decorating their hats , also want to see their betters in splendour and dressed up . This grandiose ship is quite an item of inventory and shows what the Venetians were and imagined themselves to be . ] 
 In 1798 , Napoleon ordered this bucentaur to be destroyed , less for the sake of its golden decorations than as a political gesture to symbolize his victory in conquering the city . French soldiers broke up the carved wooden portions and the gold decorations of the ship into small pieces , carted them to the island of San Giorgio Maggiore and set fire to them to recover the gold . The ship burned for three days , and French soldiers used 400 mules to carry away its gold . The decorative elements of the vessel that survived the flames are preserved in the Museo <unk> <unk> in Venice , and there is a detailed scale model of the vessel in the Arsenale . The hull survived and , renamed the <unk> Hydra and armed with four cannons , was stationed at the mouth of the Lido 's port where it served as a coastal battery . Subsequently , the ship was returned to the Arsenale and used as a prison ship until it was entirely destroyed in 1824 . 
 = = Marriage of the Sea ceremony = = 
 The " Marriage of the Adriatic " , or more correctly " Marriage of the Sea " ( in Italian , <unk> del Mare ) , was a ceremony symbolizing the maritime dominion of Venice . The ceremony , established about 1000 to commemorate the Doge Pietro II Orseolo 's conquest of Dalmatia , was originally one of supplication and <unk> , Ascension Day being chosen as that on which the doge set out on his expedition . The form it took was a solemn procession of boats , headed by the doge 's nave ( ship ) , from 1311 the Bucentaur , out to sea by the Lido port .

 In February 2008 , plans to rebuild the bucentaur destroyed in 1798 were announced . More than 200 shipbuilders , <unk> and jewellers started work on 15 March 2008 at the Arsenale . It has been reported by the Italian press that it will take two years for the bucentaur to be constructed . However , Colonel Giorgio Paterno , the head of Fondazione Bucintoro which is behind the € 20 million project , said in March 2008 that " [ w ] e 'll build it as fast as we can but we 're not in a hurry . " It is intended that the project will make use of traditional shipbuilding techniques and original materials , including larch and fir wood , and will reproduce gold decorations . The foundation is supported by businessmen in the Veneto and Lombardy regions but has also written to the French President Nicolas Sarkozy for France to make a financial contribution as a goodwill gesture to compensate for Napoleon 's " vandalism " of the 1729 vessel . 
 Fondazione Bucintoro hopes that the vessel will become " the most visited floating museum in the world " , but also sees the project as a means to " help Venice recover its former glory and its old spirit " . According to Paterno , " Invaded by so many million tourists , the city risks losing its identity , losing its cultural connection with its own history . It 's not enough to live in the future , the city needs to connect with and remember its glorious past . "

 = Wallingford Castle = 
 Wallingford Castle was a major medieval castle situated in Wallingford in the English county of Oxfordshire ( historically in Berkshire until the 1974 reorganisation ) , adjacent to the River Thames . Established in the 11th century as a motte @-@ and @-@ bailey design within an Anglo @-@ Saxon burgh , it grew to become what historian Nicholas Brooks has described as " one of the most powerful royal castles of the 12th and 13th centuries " . Held for the Empress Matilda during the civil war years of the Anarchy , it survived multiple sieges and was never taken . Over the next two centuries it became a luxurious castle , used by royalty and their immediate family . After being abandoned as a royal residence by Henry VIII , the castle fell into decline . <unk> during the English Civil War , it was eventually slighted , i.e. deliberately destroyed , after being captured by Parliamentary forces after a long siege . The site was subsequently left relatively undeveloped , and the limited remains of the castle walls and the considerable earthworks are now open to the public .

 As an important regional town , overlooking a key crossing point on the River Thames , prosperous and with its own mint , the town of Wallingford had been defended by an Anglo @-@ Saxon burgh , or town wall , prior to the Norman invasion of 1066 . <unk> of Wallingford , who controlled the town , supported William the Conqueror 's invasion and entertained the king when he arrived in Wallingford . Immediately after the end of the initial invasion , the king set about establishing control over the Thames Valley through constructing three key castles , the royal castles of Windsor and Wallingford , and the baronial castle , later transferred to royal hands , built at Oxford . 
 Wallingford Castle was probably built by Robert D 'Oyly between 1067 and 1071 . Robert had married <unk> 's daughter Ealdgyth , and ultimately inherited many of his father @-@ in @-@ law 's lands . The wooden castle was built in the north @-@ east corner of the town , taking advantage of the old Anglo @-@ Saxon ramparts , with the motte close to the river overlooking the ford , and required substantial demolition work to make room for the new motte @-@ and @-@ bailey structure . Unusually , it appears that the castle was constructed on top of high @-@ status Anglo @-@ Saxon housing , probably belonging to former housecarls . The motte today is 60 metres ( 197 feet ) across and 13 metres ( 43 feet ) high . Robert endowed a sixteen @-@ strong college of priests within the castle , which he named St Nicholas College . 
 = = = 12th century = = = 
 Wallingford Castle passed from Robert to first his son @-@ in @-@ law Miles Crispin , and then Brien FitzCount , who married Robert 's daughter after Miles died . Brien , an important supporter of Henry I , was the son of the Duke of Brittany , and probably strengthened the castle in stone in the 1130s . He produced a very powerful fortification , including a shell keep and a curtain wall around the bailey , that , combined with the extensive earthworks , has been described by historian Nicholas Brooks as " one of the most powerful royal castles of the 12th and 13th centuries " . 
 After the death of Henry , however , the political situation in England became less stable , with both Stephen of England and the Empress Matilda laying claim to the throne . Brien had originally been considered a supporter of Stephen , but in 1139 Matilda travelled to England and Brien announced his allegiance to her , joining forces with Miles of Gloucester and other supporters in the south @-@ west . Wallingford Castle was now the most easterly stronghold of the Empress 's faction – it was either the closest base to London , or the first in line to be attacked by Stephen 's forces , depending on one 's perspective . 
 Stephen attacked the castle in 1139 , initially intending to besiege it , as the walls were considered impregnable to assault . Brien had brought in considerable supplies – contemporaries believed the castle could survive a siege for several years if need be – and Stephen changed his mind , putting up two counter @-@ castles to contain Wallingford along the road to Bristol , before continuing west . The next year , Miles of Gloucester , possibly acting under orders from Robert of Gloucester , struck east , destroying one of the counter @-@ castles outside Wallingford . The civil war between Stephen and Matilda rapidly descended into an attritional campaign , in which castles like Wallingford played a critical role in efforts by both sides to secure the Thames Valley . After the fall of Oxford to Stephen in 1141 , Matilda fled to Wallingford , and the importance of the castle continued to grow . 
 Around this time Brien established a notorious prison within the castle , called <unk> Brien , or " Brien 's Close " , as part of his efforts to extract money and resources from the surrounding region . The nobleman William Martel , Stephen 's royal steward , was one of the most high profile prisoners to be kept there . Contemporary chroniclers reported the cries of tortured prisoners in the castle disturbed the inhabitants of the town of Wallingford . There was not enough space in the castle for all of Brien 's forces , and various houses in the town had to be taken for the use of his knights . 
 Between 1145 and 1146 Stephen made another attempt to seize Wallingford , but was again unable to take the castle despite building a powerful counter @-@ castle to the east , opposite Wallingford at <unk> Gifford , and building castles to the west at Brightwell , South Moreton and Cholsey . He returned with larger forces in 1152 , reestablishing the counter @-@ castle at <unk> Gifford and building another one overlooking Wallingford bridge , and settled his forces down to starve the castle out . Brien , supported by Miles ' son , Roger of Hereford , who had also become trapped in the castle , attempted to break through the blockade , but without success . 
 By 1153 , the castle garrison was running very low on food , and Roger made a deal with Stephen allowing him to leave the castle with his followers . Henry , the Empress ' son and the future Henry II , then intervened , marching his forces to relieve the castle and placing Stephen 's counter @-@ castles under siege himself . King Stephen marched back from Oxford , and the two forces confronted each other on the meadows outside the castle . The result was an embryonic peace deal called the Treaty of Wallingford , leading on to the permanent Treaty of Winchester that would ultimately bring an end to the civil war and install Henry as king following Stephen 's death in 1153 . Brien , who had no children , chose to enter a monastery , and surrendered Wallingford Castle to Henry at the end of the conflict in 1153 . 
 At the end of the 12th century , the castle become closely associated with King John , who had been granted the town by Richard I in 1189 . John seized the castle as well during his revolt in 1191 , and although he was forced to return it , he reclaimed it when he became king himself in 1199 . John made extensive use of Wallingford Castle during the First Barons ' War between 1215 and 1216 , reinforcing the fortifications and mobilising a substantial garrison to protect it . 
 = = = 13th – 15th centuries = = = 
 Under Henry III , Richard , the 1st Earl of Cornwall was formally granted the castle as his main residence in 1231 . Richard lived in considerable style , and spent substantial sums on the property , building a new hall and more luxurious fittings . Richard 's election as King of the Romans in 1251 brought an end to his use of the property , but the castle became embroiled in the Second Barons ' War in the 1260s . Simon de Montfort seized the castle after his victory at the battle of Lewes , using it to imprison the royal family for a time , before moving them to the more secure Kenilworth Castle . <unk> by Henry III at the end of the conflict , it continued to be used by the Earls of Cornwall as a luxurious home for the rest of the century . 
 Edward II gave Wallingford Castle first to his royal favourite , Piers Gaveston , and then to his young wife , Isabella of France , with large sums still being spent on the property . Edward continued to use the castle as a royal prison for holding his enemies , until his own fall from power in 1326 ; Isabella , who overthrew her husband , then used it as an early headquarters following her invasion of England . Her son , Edward III , ultimately settled the castle on the new title of the Duke of Cornwall , used by sons of the king . 
 The castle continued to be used as a county jail , with many complaints about the number of felons who were able to escape from it . The cost of maintaining the castle from local rents and revenues became more challenging towards the end of the 14th century , with additional royal revenues being required for the ongoing work required on it . Nonetheless , in 1399 when Richard II was deposed , the castle was well fortified and in good condition , forming what historian Douglas Biggs calls " a formidable obstacle " to Richard 's enemies , and able to host the royal government when it first fled from London . Wallingford Castle played little role in the Wars of the Roses and after Henry VIII used it for a final time in 1518 it appears to have fallen into disuse as a royal residence . 
 = = = 16th – 19th centuries = = = 
 The castle fell into decline in the 16th century ; it was separated from the Duchy of Cornwall , and under Queen Mary the site was stripped for lead and other building materials for use at Windsor Castle . The antiquarian John Leland described the castle in 1540 as being " <unk> sore yn ruine , and for the most part defaced " , although the jail continued in use throughout the period , albeit still suffering from many escapee inmates . Held by various nobles from 1600 onwards , it returned to the crown under Charles I , who gave it to Queen Henrietta Maria , but by then the castle was only really valuable for the surrounding meadow land and fisheries . 
 The English Civil War broke out between the supporters of Charles I and Parliament in the 1640s ; with the king and Parliament maintaining their capitals in Oxford and London respectively , the Thames Valley once again became a critical war zone . Wallingford was a Royalist town , with a garrison established there in 1642 to prevent an advance on Oxford to the north @-@ west . Colonel Thomas <unk> was appointed governor , and in 1643 the king instructed him to refortify the castle , inspecting the results later that year . By 1644 , the surrounding Thames towns of Abingdon and Reading had fallen and Parliamentary forces unsuccessfully attacked the town and castle of Wallingford in 1645 . General Thomas Fairfax placed Wallingford Castle under siege the next year ; after 16 weeks , during which Oxford fell to Parliamentary forces , the castle finally surrendered in July 1646 under generous terms for the defenders . 
 The risk of civil conflict continued , however , and Parliament decided that it was necessary to slight , or damage so as to put beyond military use , the castle in 1652 , as it remained a surprisingly powerful fortress and a continuing threat should any fresh uprising occur . The castle was virtually razed to the ground in the operation , although a brick building continued to be used as a prison into the 18th century . A large house was built in the bailey in 1700 , followed by a gothic mansion house on the same site in 1837 . 
 = = Today = = 
 The mansion , abandoned due to rising costs , was demolished in 1972 , allowing Wallingford Castle to be declared a scheduled monument as well as a Grade I listed building . The castle grounds , including the remains of St Nicholas College , two sections of castle wall and the motte hill , are now open to the public . An archaeological research project run by Leicester University conducted a sequence of excavations between 2002 and 2010 , aiming to better understand the historical transition from the Anglo @-@ Saxon town of Wallingford and the burgh , to the period of the Norman castle . 
 = Order of Saint Hubert = 
 The Bavarian Order of Saint Hubert is a Roman Catholic dynastic order of knighthood founded in 1444 or 1445 by Gerhard VII , Duke of Jülich @-@ Berg . He sought to commemorate his victory over the House of Egmond at the Battle of Linnich on 3 November , which is Saint Hubert 's day . 
 The establishment of the Order occurred during a long @-@ term , intermittent territorial dispute , initially between the Dukes of Jülich and the Dukes of Guelders , who were descended from a female line of the House of Jülich . The dispute began in the 1430s , when Arnold , Duke of Gelderland claimed the duchy of Jülich and the county of Ravensberg , and was resolved in the 1614 Treaty of Xanten , which established the United Duchies of Jülich @-@ Cleves @-@ Berg of the counties of Ravensberg and Mark with the duchies of Cleves , Jülich and Berg . In 1778 , Charles Theodore , Duke of Jülich and Berg and the Count @-@ Elector Palatine , succeeded his childless cousin , Maximilian III Joseph , Elector of Bavaria and brought the Order to Bavaria . 
 Initially , the order was open to men and women , although limiting the number of male companions to sixty . It commemorated the conversion of Saint Hubert and his standing as the patron saint of hunters and knights . Over time , the award had other uses as a reward for loyalty to the monarch and service to the princely state . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Foundation = = = 
 Sources agree that the Order of Saint Hubert honors a military victory of the Duke of Jülich , on Saint Hubert 's day , 3 November 1444 . Sources differ on the specific date of establishment of the Order , whether it celebrated the victory at the Battle of Linnich between Gebhard V of Jülich and Arnold of Egmont ( or Egmond ) , or commemorated the battle at a future date . Consequently , the date of the founding depends on the source . Still other sources date the founding of the Order as late as 1473 or 1475 . 
 Twentieth century investigation has helped to clear up some of the confusion . The original Latin statutes of the foundation use Good Friday , in this case 26 March 1445 . Furthermore , there is clear written evidence that the Order existed prior to March 1445 : The original German statutes were dated immediately after the battle . It is also possible that Gerhard proclaimed the establishment of the Order immediately after the victory of his knights at Linnich , but the documents were not drawn up until later , leading to discrepancy in the dates of 1444 or 1445 . To further obfuscate the date of founding , Gerhard 's son , William III , renewed the Order upon his own succession to the ducal dignities in 1475 , in the so @-@ called New Statutes , which were prepared in Latin and German . These remained the governing documents of the Order until 1708 . In this confirmation probably lies the root of confusion over the date of the Order 's foundation . 
 Initially the Order was a knightly brotherhood ( <unk> ) , reflecting the overlapping religious and military aspects of medieval court life . Saint Hubert was the patron saint of hunters and knights . The founding of the Order of the Golden Fleece in the early 15th century started a trend in confraternal princely orders . The purpose of these , whether established by monarchs or princes , was to foster loyalty to a sovereign , replacing to the old Chivalric orders developed in the Crusades . Although some historians classify the Order of the Saint Hubert as a confraternal order , during its 600 @-@ year @-@ life , its purpose changed as the fortunes and needs of the Dukes of Jülich and Berg and their successors changed .

 When Reinhold IV , Duke of Gelder , died in 1423 , his nephew Arnold inherited the dukedom . Arnold 's cousin , Adolf of Berg , inherited territories near Liège . Arnold believed that Adolf had inherited the better of the two properties , and coveted it for himself . He tried to take it by force and failed ; a compromise was reached by which the two agreed to a truce . Adolf of Berg died in 1437 and his cousin , Gerhard IV , the Duke of Jülich and Count of Ravensburg ( Westphalia ) , inherited both the Liège properties and the Duchy of Berg . Arnold reasserted his old claim , maintaining that the truce to which he and Adolf agreed was no longer valid , and prepared to take the duchies by force . Confident in his right to the inheritance , Gerhard met Arnold in battle , at the village of Linnich , in the county of Ravensburg ( Westphalia ) . He and his knights defeated Arnold and his knights on Saint Hubert 's day in 1444 . In celebration , Gerhard declared the founding of the Order , to reward his loyal and victorious knights . 
 The Order remained in collateral branches of the family of the Dukes of Jülich and Berg until 1521 , when the male line holding the two duchies and the county of Ravensberg became extinct . A daughter , Maria von <unk> , remained to inherit the duchies and the county , but , under the Salic law practiced in the northwestern German states , women could only hold property through a husband or guardian . Consequently , the territories passed to her husband — who was also her distant relative — John III , Duke of Cleves and Mark . The couple had three daughters , one of whom , Ann of Cleves , married Henry VIII of England in 1540 , and one son , Wilhelm , who subsequently inherited the duchies and the administration of the Order . The duchies included most of the present @-@ day North Rhine @-@ Westphalia that lay outside the ecclesiastical territories of the Electorate of Cologne and Münster . Wilhelm was known as Wilhelm the Rich .

 In March 1609 , Duke John William of Jülich @-@ Cleves @-@ Berg died childless . Both Duke Wolfgang William of Palatinate @-@ Neuberg and Elector John Sigismund of Brandenburg claimed the territories . In the subsequent succession chaos , the Order fell into disuse . By the late 17th century , the Duchy of Jülich passed into the jurisdiction of the Prince @-@ Elector Johann Wilhelm , Duke of Neuberg , who descended from a cadet branch of the Palatine line of the House of Wittelsbach . In May 1708 , he restored the Order of Saint Hubert and assumed the position of grand master for himself . To reward loyalty and service , he conferred the cross of the Order on several of his courtiers . He also gave the recipients generous pensions on the condition that a tenth be set aside for the poor , and a significant sum be distributed on the day of their reception into the order . 
 In 1777 , the death of Maximilian III Joseph of Bavaria without a legitimate male heir ended the main line of Wittelsbach ; after the War of the Bavarian Succession , a brief and relatively bloodless contest , Charles Theodore inherited his cousin 's dignities . The Order moved with the new Elector to Bavaria , where it eventually was confirmed again on 30 March 1800 by Maximilian IV , Elector of Bavaria . In the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars , the Order functioned primarily as a military order , similar to the Military Order of Maria Theresa or the Order of Leopold . The present head of the House of Wittelsbach , Franz Bonaventura Adalbert Maria , Duke of Bavaria , is the current Grand Master of the order . 
 = = Structure and requirements = = 
 Initially , hierarchy of membership was relatively flat . The statutes called for a grand master , in this case the Duke of Jülich , four masters , and a provost , or arms master . Of the four masters , two were required to be representative of families of the Duchies of Jülich or Berg ; the origins of the others had no geographic limitations . The masters were the clearing house for membership ; they investigated the admission of new members and any alleged infractions by the existing membership . The Provost , a weapons master , maintained the weapons and arms of the brotherhood , and himself wore a special medallion . 
 The Order was open to men and women , and both genders were entitled companions . Until 1476 , there were no limits on the number of companions to be admitted , but that year , with the new edition of the Order 's statutes , the Duke limited the number of men to 60 ; unlimited women could be admitted . The editions of the Order 's statutes , two in Latin and two in German , established similar requirements for membership . The Latin editions stipulated that the man be of noble birth — eight generations of noble grandparents — and of unblemished reputation ; the German versions required that only four grandparents of the man be noble . Women were to be spouses of a companion ; in the 1476 versions of the statutes , both Latin and German , female members of the Duchess ' household could be admitted even if their husbands were not members or if the women were single , but were required to resign if they left the service of the Duchess . The exception to this clause provided for their continued membership if their husbands became companions of the order .

 In confirming the Order , on 18 May 1808 , the King of Bavaria declared the Order to be the first in the kingdom and linked it to the Order of Civic of Merit . He limited membership to twelve knights from the ranks of counts and barons , excluding himself , as grandmaster , and members ( native and foreign ) , who may be nominated by the sovereign . Entrance fees were 200 gold ducats for princes . Those under the rank of prince paid an entrance fee of 100 silver ducats , which amounted to 120 Reichsthaler ; the silver Reichsthaler was <unk> of .989 fineness . He also established a dress costume for festival days , which included not only the insignia of the Order , but a black collar with a sash , narrow , short breeches with poppy @-@ colored garters and bows , a short black cape , a sword , and a plumed hat . Ludwig II was laid in state and was buried in this apparel .

 The gold @-@ enameled cross lies in a white field , and surmounted by a crown ; on one side is represented the conversion of Saint Hubert , with the legend In trau vast ( firm in fidelity ) in Gothic letters . On the reverse , lies the imperial orb and the Latin inscription In memoriam <unk> <unk> a vitæ 1708 ( English : In remembrance of the restoration of the original dignity , 1708 ) . Originally , it consisted of a collar and a pendant jewel . The Jülich collar consisted of stylized horns ( six for men , four for women ) , intertwined with a cloud @-@ like figure eight . The jewel depicted a relief of the conversion of Saint Hubert . Its overall design alluded to the Saint as the patron of hunters , and thus the patron of knights . The great cross was only worn on special days ; on all other days , a smaller cross must be worn , and the member was fined 20 thalers for any and each omission ) . The smaller cross was decorated appropriately for its size . 
 The collar of the Order under the Wittelsbach dynasty consisted of forty @-@ four gold links , twenty @-@ two of which consisted of a rectangular representation of the conversion of Saint Hubert in open relief surrounded by a gold and white enamel frame . These alternated with twenty @-@ two other links consisted of the intertwined initial letters of the motto In trau vast , ( firm in fidelity ) , i.e. , I , T and V in Gothic letters radiating small golden rays , each of these links being alternatively enameled red or green . From the center rectangular link hung a white enameled Maltese cross , each arm strewn with numerous small golden flames and each point of the cross was tipped with a small gold ball . Between each arm of this cross were five straight gold rays and in the center of the cross was a round medallion bearing a golden representation in relief of the conversion of Saint Hubert against a green enamel background . The reverse of this cross bore the same design with this same representation but against a red enamel background . 
 The sash of the Order was poppy red <unk> with narrow green borders , but under the knot , at the ends of this sash , these green borders as well as the ends of the sash were covered with gold metallic ribbon . Like the sash of the Order of the Garter this sash was worn from the left shoulder to the right hip . The cross worn with this sash was a Maltese cross with narrow arms also enameled white strewn with numerous golden flames , with three straight rays between each arm , each point of the cross being tipped with a small gold ball . Between the two gold balls on the top arm of the cross was a three @-@ dimensional gold representation of the Bavarian crown , by which the cross hung from its sash . In the center of the cross was a large round medallion consisting of a small golden representation of the conversion of Saint Hubert against a green enamel background and surrounded by a wide border in red enamel with the motto the order In trau vast in Gothic letters set with small diamonds . On the reverse , in the center of the cross was a golden representation in relief of the imperial orb and cross ( i.e. , the heraldic symbol of the Prince @-@ Elector as the Arch @-@ Steward of the Holy Roman Empire ) against a red enamel background and surrounded with a white enamel scroll @-@ like border with the inscription In memoriam <unk> <unk> <unk> . 1708 ( I. e . , In remembrance of the restoration of the original dignity , 1708 ) . The star of the order , worn on the left breast , was a radiant silver star of eight points surrounding a gold , white enameled cross pattée strewn with golden flames and with a round poppy red enameled central medallion bearing the motto In trau vast in golden Gothic letters and surrounded by a white enameled and gold border .

 Robert Bigham Brode ( June 12 , 1900 – February 19 , 1986 ) was an American physicist , who during World War II led the group at the Manhattan Project 's Los Alamos laboratory that developed the fuses used in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . 
 A graduate of the California Institute of Technology , where he earned his doctorate in 1924 , Brode attended Oxford University on a Rhodes Scholarship and the University of Göttingen on a National Research Council Fellowship . During World War II , Brode worked at Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University , where he helped develop the proximity fuse , and then as a group leader at the Los Alamos Laboratory . In 1950 he was one of a dozen prominent scientists who petitioned President Harry S. Truman to declare that the United States would never be the first to use the hydrogen bomb . 
 After the war , Brode returned to teaching at Berkeley . Between 1930 and 1957 he supervised 37 graduate students . In addition to his research and teaching , he occupied a number of other positions . He was the academic assistant to two presidents of the University of California , and sat on numerous advisory panels and boards . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Robert Bigham Brode was born in Walla Walla , Washington , on June 12 , 1900 , the son of Howard S. Brode , a professor of biology at Whitman College , and his wife Martha Catherine née Bigham . He was the second of a set of triplets , being born between his brothers Wallace and Malcolm . They also had an older brother , James Stanley . All four attended Whitman College , and went on to earn doctorates and have distinguished careers as scientists and academics . 
 Brode graduated from Whitman College with his Bachelor of Science degree in 1921 , and then entered the California Institute of Technology . He was awarded his Doctor of Philosophy ( Ph.D. ) in physics in 1924 , the first year in which <unk> awarded this degree , for his thesis on " the absorption coefficient for slow electrons in gases " . He showed that molecules with similar arrangements of their external electrons have similar cross sections for collisions with slow electrons . These results could not be readily explained with classical physics , and their importance would not be realised until 1966 . 
 On graduation , Brode became an Associate Physicist at the National Bureau of Standards . He was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oriel College , Oxford , in England in 1924 and 1925 , and then a National Research Council Fellowship , which he used to study at the University of Göttingen in Germany in 1925 and 1926 , and then at Princeton University from 1926 to 1927 . On returning to the United States , he married Bernice Hedley Bidwell on September 16 , 1926 . They had two sons . 
 Brode became an assistant professor of physics at the University of California , Berkeley , in 1927 , and a full professor in 1932 . He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship , which enabled him to return to England and study at Cambridge University and Birkbeck College , University of London , in 1934 and 1935 . While there , he became friends with the British physicist P.M.S. Blackett . He was impressed by Blackett 's cloud chambers , and set his graduate students to work on projects using them , starting with Dale R. Corson . 
 = = Manhattan Project = = 
 In 1941 , after the start of World War II , Brode went to work at Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University , where he helped develop the proximity fuse . In 1943 , he joined the Manhattan Project 's Los Alamos Laboratory , where was appointed the leader of the E @-@ 3 Fusing Group . This group consisted of 14 civilians , 12 military officers and 37 enlisted men of the Special Engineer Detachment . Its task was to develop a fuse that would detonate an atomic bomb at a specified height above the ground . 
 Normally , bombs are cheap and fuses are relatively expensive , but an atomic bomb is extremely expensive , and any failure of a triggering device is unacceptable . On the other hand , for the same reason , fuses can be employed that would be prohibitively expensive in a conventional bomb . Brode 's E @-@ 3 group were tasked to develop a fusing mechanism that would have less than one chance in 10 @,@ 000 of failing to detonate within 200 feet ( 61 m ) of the required height . The required height was not initially known , as it depended on the yield , which was uncertain . The group investigated both radar proximity fuses and barometric altimeter fuses . Testing was carried out at the Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren , Virginia in August 1943 and Muroc Army Air Field in March 1944 using dummy drops from barrage balloons . In the end , a modified APS @-@ 13 Monica tail warning radar known as " Archie " was employed , and the fuses performed flawlessly in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki .

In 1951 he returned to England for another year , this time at Manchester University as a Fulbright Scholar . Between 1930 and 1943 , 15 graduate students conducted their research under his direction . He supervised another 22 between 1946 and 1957 . The 37 students included Corson , who became president of Cornell University , and William B. <unk> , who was vice president of the University of California from 1978 to 1983 . 
 In addition to his research and teaching , Brode occupied a number of other positions . He was the academic assistant to two presidents of the University of California , Clark Kerr from 1960 to 1965 , and Charles J. Hitch from 1972 to 1973 , and to Angus E.

 Washington & Jefferson College , also known as W & J College or W & J , is a private liberal arts college in Washington , Pennsylvania , in the United States , which is 30 miles ( 48 km ) south of Pittsburgh . The college traces its origin to three log cabin colleges in Washington County established by three Presbyterian missionaries to the American frontier in the 1780s : John McMillan , Thaddeus Dod , and Joseph Smith . These early schools eventually grew into two competing academies and colleges , with Canonsburg Academy , later Jefferson College , located in Canonsburg and Washington Academy , later Washington College , in Washington . These two colleges merged in 1865 to form Washington & Jefferson College . The 60 @-@ acre ( 24 ha ) campus , located in Washington , Pennsylvania , has more than 40 buildings , with the oldest dating to 1793 . While the college has historically had a difficult relationship with the city of Washington , including clashes over college expansion and finances , recent efforts have been made to improve those relations . 
 The college 's academic emphasis is on the liberal arts and the sciences , with a focus on preparing students for graduate and professional schools . Campus activities include various religious , political , and general interest clubs , as well as academic and professional @-@ themed organizations . The college has a strong history of competing literary societies , dating back before the union of Jefferson and Washington Colleges . Students operate a college radio station , a campus newspaper , and a literary journal . The athletic program competes in NCAA Division III . The football team has been particularly successful over its history , even competing in the 1922 Rose Bowl . A large majority of students participate in intramural athletics . Nearly all students live on campus and roughly one third are members of fraternities or sororities . A number of noteworthy alumni have attended the college or its predecessor institutions , including James G. Blaine , William Holmes McGuffey , and Pete Henry .

 Washington & Jefferson College traces its origin to three log cabin colleges established by three frontier clergymen in the 1780s : John McMillan , Thaddeus Dod , and Joseph Smith . The three men , all graduates from the College of New Jersey ( now Princeton University ) , came to present @-@ day Washington County to plant churches and spread Presbyterianism to what was then the American frontier beyond the Appalachian Mountains . John McMillan , the most prominent of the three founders because of his strong personality and longevity , came to the area in 1775 and built his log cabin college in 1780 near his church in <unk> . Thaddeus Dod , known as a keen scholar , built his log cabin college in Lower Ten Mile in 1781 . Joseph Smith taught classical studies in his college , called " The Study , " at Buffalo . 
 Washington Academy was chartered by the Pennsylvania General Assembly on September 24 , 1787 . The first members of the board of trustees included Reverends Dod and Smith . After a difficult search for a headmaster , in which the trustees consulted Benjamin Franklin , the trustees unanimously selected Thaddeus Dod , considered to be the best scholar in western Pennsylvania . Amid financial difficulties and unrest from the Whiskey Rebellion , the Academy held no classes from 1791 to 1796 . In 1792 , the Academy secured four lots at Wheeling and Lincoln street from William Hoge and began construction on the stone Academy Building . During the Whiskey Rebellion , portions of David Bradford 's militia camped on a hillside that would later become home to the unified Washington & Jefferson College . 
 In October 1792 , after a year 's delay from its official incorporation resulting from " trouble with Indians , " McMillan was chosen as the headmaster and Canonsburg was chosen as the location for the " Canonsburg Academy . " At a subsequent unknown date , McMillan transferred his students from the log cabin to Canonsburg Academy . Canonsburg Academy was chartered by the General Assembly on March 11 , 1794 , thus placing it firmly ahead of it sister school , Washington Academy , which was without a faculty , students , or facilities . On January 15 , 1802 , with McMillan as president of the board , the General Assembly finally granted a charter for " a college at <unk> . " 
 = = = Jefferson College and Washington College = = = 
 In 1802 , Canonsburg Academy was reconstituted as Jefferson College , with John McMillan serving as the first President of the Board of Trustees . In 1806 , Matthew Brown petitioned the Pennsylvania General Assembly to grant Washington Academy a charter , allowing it to be re @-@ christened as Washington College . At various times over the next 60 years , the various parties within the two colleges pursued unification with each other , but the question of where the unified college would be located thwarted those efforts . In 1817 , a disagreement over a perceived agreement for unification erupted into " The College War " and threatened the existence of both colleges . In the ensuing years , both colleges began to undertake risky financial moves , especially over @-@ selling scholarships . Thanks to the leadership of Matthew Brown , Jefferson College was in a stronger position to weather the financial storm for a longer period . Desperate for funds , Washington College accepted an offer from the Synod of Wheeling to take control of the college , a move that was supposed to stabilize the finances for a period of time . However , Washington College then undertook another series of risky financial moves that crippled its finances . 
 = = = Unification of the colleges = = = 
 Following the Civil War , both colleges were short on students and on funds , causing them to join together as Washington & Jefferson College in 1865 . The charter provided for the college to operate at both Canonsburg and Washington , a position that caused significant difficulty for the administration trying to rescue the college amid ill feelings over the unification . Jonathan Edwards , a pastor from Baltimore who had been president of Hanover College , was elected the first president of the unified Washington & Jefferson College on April 4 , 1866 . Edwards immediately encountered significant challenges , including the difficulties of administering a college across two campuses , as well as old prejudices and hard feelings among those still loyal to either Jefferson College or Washington College . Edwards resigned in 1869 , as the two @-@ campus arrangement was declared a failure and all operations were consolidated in Washington . Before the merger could be completed , Canonsburg residents and Jefferson College partisans filed a lawsuit , known as the Pennsylvania College Cases , sought to overturn the consolidation plan . Leadership of the college during this time fell to Samuel J. Wilson , a local pastor , and James I. Brownson , who had earlier been interim president of Washington College . By 1871 , the United States Supreme Court upheld the consolidation , allowing the newly configured college to proceed . 
 = = = Washington & Jefferson College = = = 
 George P. Hays , who had assumed the presidency amid the court battle and the unification controversy , led the newly unified college until 1881 . His successor , James D. Moffat , led the college through a period of growth where the college constructed the Old Gym , Hays Hall , Thompson Memorial Library , and Thistle Physics Building , as well as purchasing the land known as the " old fair ground , " now used for Cameron Stadium . Towards the end of his term , Moffat personally paid for the 1912 renovations of McMillan Hall . In 1914 , Frederick W. <unk> was elected president . His tenure was dominated by the United States ' entry into World War I , with an enrollment drop of 50 % . William E. <unk> , a college trustee and adjunct professor , succeeded <unk> and served as interim president from May 1918 to June 1919 . After the war ended in 1919 , Samuel Charles Black took over and helped to stabilize the enrollment . While on a honeymoon tour of national parks , Black became ill and died . His successor , Simon <unk> Baker , was well liked by the college 's trustees and by " many a townsman " , but the student body felt that Baker was " autocratic " and held an " unfriendly attitude toward the student body as individuals . " Baker defended himself , saying that the perceived ill @-@ will towards students was unintentional and a misunderstanding . Nonetheless , the student body held a strike and general walkout in 1931 , prompting Baker to resign . 
 Baker 's successor , Ralph Cooper Hutchison , was much more popular with the student body . In an effort to strengthen the college 's science department , Hutchison extended and expanded the southern portion of the campus , adding the <unk> Chemistry Hall and purchasing <unk> Hall . When World War II broke out , the campus was opened to the Army Administration School , where hundreds of soldiers received their " training in classifications . " Hutchison resigned in 1945 to take the presidency of his alma mater , Lafayette College . James Herbert Case , Jr . , who was president from 1946 to 1950 , constructed several new dormitories to handle the influx of veterans under the G.I. Bill . In 1950 , Boyd <unk> Patterson assumed the presidency and oversaw curriculum revisions and the construction of a number of buildings , including the Henry Memorial Center , 10 Greek housing units in the center of campus , the U. Grant Miller Library , the Student Center , the Commons , and two new dormitories . His fundraising abilities grew the college 's endowment expanded from $ 2 @.@ 3 million to nearly $ 11 million . Patterson retired in 1970 , the same year that the trustees authorized the admission of women as undergraduate students . Howard J. Burnett took office as president that year and hired the college 's first female faculty members and the first female dean . The college also adopted a new academic calendar to include <unk> and expanded its academic programs to include the Entrepreneurial Studies Program , the Freshman Forum , and several cooperative international education programs . Student enrollment grew from 830 in 1970 to 1 @,@ 100 in 1998 . Burnett retired as president in 1998 . Under Burnett 's successor , Brian C. Mitchell , who served as president from 1998 to 2004 , the college experienced a growth in construction and an effort to improve relations with the neighboring communities . In 2004 , Tori Haring @-@ Smith became the first woman to serve as president of Washington & Jefferson , undertaking an effort to improve the science curriculum and to construct the Swanson Science Center .

 As a liberal arts college , Washington & Jefferson College focuses exclusively on undergraduate education . It is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools . The college 's teaching environment reflects the liberal arts tradition of small group instruction by maintaining an average class size of 17 and a student / faculty ratio of 12 : 1 . 85 % of faculty have terminal degrees and no classes are taught by teaching assistants . The college has a strong science program , with 35 % of students majoring in one of the scientific departments . Within those areas , all 32 professors hold terminal degrees . The most frequent class size is between 10 and 19 students . 
 The college has a focus on preparing students for graduate school and professional programs . Across all disciplines , 85 % to 90 % of students who apply to such programs receive offers of admission . Among students who apply to medical school or related health graduate programs , 90 % of students gain admission . Approximately 11 % of all current W & J alumni are physicians and engineers , making the college third in the nation per capita for producing doctors and scientific researchers .

 The history of literary societies at Washington & Jefferson College dates back to the 1797 , when the Franklin Literary Society and the Philo Literary Society were founded at Canonsburg Academy . Two other literary societies were founded at Washington College , the Union Literary Society in 1809 and the Washington Literary Society in 1814 . Typical early activities include the presentation of dialogues , translations of passages from Greek or Latin classics , and extemporaneous speaking . Later , the literary societies began to present declamations . Each society maintained independent libraries for the use of their members , each of which rivaled the holdings of their respective colleges . These four college literary societies had intense rivalries with each other , competing in " contests " , which pitted select society members against another in " compositions , speaking select orations and debating " , with the trustees selecting the victor . Because the two colleges never met each other in athletic contests , these literary competitions were the main outlet for their rivalry . In the years after the union of the two colleges , these four literary societies merged with the Franklin Literary Society , which survives today .

 = = Traditions and lore = = 
 One of the oldest traditions at Washington & Jefferson College was the " Freshman Rules , " a system of rules and restrictions on freshmen . Failure by freshmen to follow these rules would subject them to beatings by upperclassmen or other punishments doled out by the " Freshman Court . " During the 1870s and 1880s , the students engaged in organized athletic competitions , pitting the freshman versus sophomore classes in the " Olympic Games " that involved elaborate opening ceremonies and the smoking of a " Pipe of Peace . " Another form of physical contest between the freshman and sophomore classes were the annual " color rush , " where the teams fought over control over strips of fabric , the " pole rush , " where the teams battled to raise a flag up a flagpole , and the " cane rush " where the teams fought over control over a ceremonial cane . These contests generally devolved into outright gang violence . 
 The college cheer , <unk> <unk> , is so pervasive in college history and culture that in addition to being shouted during academic ceremonies and football games , it is also used as a salutation in correspondence between alumni . The college 's fight song , Good Ole W & J is sung to the tune of 99 Bottles of Beer and makes fun of a number of rival colleges , including the University of Pittsburgh , but was modified sometime before 1958 to laud Washington Female Seminary . For a large portion of the college 's history , there was no official alma mater , but there were a number of other tradition hymns and songs . 
 = = Symbols of the college = = 
 The college 's coat of arms features a two @-@ part shield based on the coats of arms of the Jefferson and Washington families . The top portion , showing two towers , representing Washington College and Jefferson College , and three stars , representing the McMillan , Dod , and Smith log cabins . The lower portion , showing a saltire , is adapted from Jefferson ’ s coat of arms and the colors , red and black , is taken from the Washington coat of arms . The coat of arms may appear with a banner underneath showing the college motto . The design was adopted in 1902 in celebration of Jefferson College 's centennial . It was designed by Rev. Harry B. King , class of 1891 . Upon its adoption , it was described as " a happy combination , and makes a very neat appearance when worn as a pin or button . " 
 The college seal displays two brick towers , with one labeled " 1802 , " representing Jefferson College , and the other labeled " 1806 , " representing Washington College . The union of the two colleges is represented by a bridge between the two towers , with Roman numerals reading 1865 , the year of union . Banners hanging from the towers show the college motto of " <unk> <unk> . " The creation of the seal is unknown , with the first known use occurring during the 1902 centennial celebration of Jefferson College 's founding . The seal is used in official documents , including diplomas and certificates . 
 The college 's current logo features a stylized version of the two towers of Old Main , symbolizing the 1865 unification of Washington College and Jefferson College . The logo may be displayed in several versions : with the entire name of the college , the shortened form of " W & J " , or without any text .

 = = Relations with the city of Washington = = 
 Relations between the city of Washington , Pennsylvania and Washington & Jefferson College span over two centuries , dating to the founding of both the city and the college in the 1780s . The relationship between the town and college was strong enough that the citizens of Washington offered a $ 50 @,@ 000 donation in 1869 to the college in a successful attempt to lure the trustees to select Washington over nearby Canonsburg as the consolidated location of the college . However , the relationship was strained through most of the 20th century , as the college pursued an expansion policy that clashed with the residential neighborhood . The college 's frustrations grew after preservationists unsuccessfully attempted to pass laws prohibiting the college from demolishing certain buildings that were listed on the East Washington Historic District . Relations were so bad that residents and college officials engaged in a shouting match at a meeting . Local preservationists also unsuccessfully tried to block the demolition of Hays Hall , which had been condemned . In the 1990s , the city of Washington made several unsuccessful attempts to challenge the college 's tax @-@ exempt status . In 1993 , Washington appealed the Washington County Board of Assessment 's determination that the college was exempt from the city 's property tax . That case went to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court , which ruled in favor of the college . In response , the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a new law clarifying that that colleges were exempt from taxation , including from local property taxes . Separately , the city of Washington passed an ordinance that levied a municipal " service fee " against the College students , which was ruled to be illegal and was struck down . In the late 1990s , the college and town tried to mend fences through the Blueprint for Collaboration , a plan with detailed goals and benchmarks for the future to help the college and the city work together on economic development , environmental protection , and historic preservation .

For example , lipsticks double as various explosives , perfume bottles hold materials such as sleeping gas , a <unk> also functions as a <unk> , sunglasses can be used for photographing evidence and detecting land mines , and a stylish belt buckle hides a <unk> inside it . Other over @-@ the @-@ top gadgets include a body @-@ removing powder for disposing of incriminating corpses , a robotic poodle to distract guard dogs , and a rocket launcher disguised as a briefcase . An ordinary coin can be thrown to confuse enemies , giving the player the opportunity to sneak by without a guard noticing . A cigarette lighter can also be used as a miniature welder . These ingenious gadgets come from UNITY 's gadget lab , led by its main inventor and scientist , Santa . " Santa 's Workshop " continuously works on these covert gadgets , and provides Cate with them as the game progresses . 
 In various sections of the game , the player can ride a Triumph motorcycle , or a snowmobile . Other segments of the game involve boss fights . If the player chooses to be sneaky , they can overhear humorous conversations between non @-@ player characters , such as guards , scientists and civilians . Occasionally , the player can engage in conversations with such characters . In certain cutscenes , the game uses a dialog tree , in which the player can choose between different questions and responses when talking to another character . 
 The missions in the game are littered with " intelligence items " : briefcases , envelopes , and manila folders containing textual notes which often provide humorous side @-@ notes and helpful hints to the game . The collection of intelligence items is optional . Special power @-@ ups , called " gear " items are also available for collection during the game , such as " fuzzy slippers " that reduce noise made by movement , earplugs that reduce damage from explosions , and a fire extinguisher that protects the player from burn damage . These gear items are sometimes located in hard @-@ to @-@ reach areas . At the start of each mission , the player can choose which weapons , gadgets and gear to take with them . Some intelligence and gear items cannot be collected on the first playthrough of the game , as the necessary gadgets to reach them are not unlocked until later in the game . If the player wants to collect these items , they have to revisit the mission with the appropriate equipment . 
 At the end of each mission , the game displays various statistics , as well as any awards and bonuses earned during the mission . Awards are humorous textual notes given for the player 's performance during a mission ; these include awards for using a very low or a very high amount of bullets , or a " Thanks For Not Getting Hurt Award " for avoiding damage . The player also receives a rank , such as " Trainee " or " Super Spy " , which is based on the number of intelligence items obtained during the mission . Achieving a high mission rank increases the player 's maximum health , armor and ammo capacity , as well as stealth , the amount of inflicted damage , and the accuracy of their shots . 
 No One Lives Forever also includes multiplayer gameplay online or over a local area network . There are two multiplayer modes available : standard deathmatch , and " H.A.R.M. vs. UNITY " . The latter is a team deathmatch mode , where the goal is to capture as much intelligence for a player 's team as possible , by sneaking in to the enemy team 's base , finding the item , and photographing it .

 UNITY is a secret international organization headquartered somewhere in England that protects humanity from outsiders that want to take over the world . In 1960 , over half of the UNITY 's elite agents are murdered by an unknown assassin within a week , leaving UNITY with a critical manpower shortage . They are forced to send UNITY agent Cate Archer and her mentor , Bruno Lawrie , on a series of high @-@ profile missions . Cate is an ex @-@ cat burglar , and is UNITY 's first female spy operative . UNITY 's leaders , Jones and Smith , are skeptical of Cate working as a field agent , and have previously relegated her to more mundane assignments . Intelligence reveals that a Russian assassin named <unk> Volkov and a new terrorist organization named H.A.R.M. are responsible for the murders of UNITY 's former agents . Cate and Bruno embark on a dangerous assignment in Morocco , which later turns out to be an ambush set up by Volkov and his men . Cate manages to escape Morocco whilst Bruno is shot by Volkov . In the UNITY headquarters , Jones and Smith reveal that Volkov killed Bruno simply because he was the traitor , to which Cate reacts with disbelief . 
 She is then tasked to escort Dr. Otto Schenker , an East German scientist , to England . Later on , as Cate and Dr. Schenker fly back to England , he is captured by H.A.R.M. , led by Magnus Armstrong , who knocks Cate unconscious . Armstrong decides to spare Cate 's life , believing that she is a fellow Scot . Cate awakens and is soon thrown from the plane as it explodes . After surviving the fall via parachute , Cate is later introduced to a new partner , Tom Goodman , a UNITY agent from the American branch . After meeting him in a nightclub in Hamburg , they are ambushed by H.A.R.M. , but manage to escape . The nightclub is owned by a German singer named Inge Wagner , whom Cate suspects is connected with H.A.R.M. Cate and Tom are tasked to investigate a cargo freighter containing several suspicious chemical containers that UNITY believes are linked to Dr. Schenker . Cate gets in the freighter , and after taking photos of the containers , is knocked unconscious by Armstrong , who spares her life by locking her in a cargo hold , thus ignoring Wagner 's insistence that she must be liquidated . As the freighter heads out toward sea , it slowly begins to sink , due to a huge explosion . Wagner and Armstrong escape immediately , but Cate has to fight her way out of the bowels of the freighter . Because Cate could not obtain the required information , she and Tom must return to the sunken freighter to finish gathering intelligence aboard . Cate goes scuba diving , and after investigating the shipwreck and obtaining the information she didn 't obtain , she is ambushed by H.A.R.M. divers sent from a submarine commanded by Armstrong and Wagner , but manages to escape . 
 Later , Cate finds out about a connection between H.A.R.M. and a large manufacturing firm named Dumas Industrial Enterprises , which was operated by Baron Archibald Dumas . However , the Baron claims he has no intelligence regarding his connection to H.A.R.M. 
 Later , Cate infiltrates the Dumas corporate headquarters , gaining access to their highly guarded safe , and photographing some relevant documents , despite heavy opposition , including an ear @-@ splitting deathmatch against Wagner . However , after photographing the headquarter 's final document , Cate escapes the headquarters despite witnessing Tom being shot by Volkov . 
 Meanwhile , H.A.R.M. starts infecting and killing innocent people using Dr. Schenker 's biological explosive development . The chemical is injected into the living host , and it feeds on organic material until it culminates in a massive explosion . H.A.R.M. states that if their ransom demands are not met , they will continue to use human time bombs to cause destruction around the world . Cate embarks on a train ride to Washington state , where Dr. Schenker is believed to be located . Cate finds him and manages to escort him to safety using an underground base . 
 Soon after , Dr. Schenker reveals that the antidote for the chemical reagent is located in H.A.R.M. ' s space station . Cate travels to a small island located in the Caribbean , where she infiltrates a secret launch facility . Cate discovers that a rocket will be sent to the space station that afternoon to collect some antidote . Disguised as a H.A.R.M. space agent , Cate boards the rocket and travels to H.A.R.M. ' s space station . While she is searching for the antidote , the space station is struck by a meteor shower , causing it to implode . Cate obtains a large antidote sample and uses an escape pod to return to earth safely . 
 Now in possession of the antidote , UNITY needs the list of infected people to find out who administered it , during which Cate believes that the real mastermind behind H.A.R.M. ' s events is the Baron 's wife , Baroness Felicity Dumas , who is believed to be in possession of the list . Later , Cate heads to the Dumas ' château located in the German Alps . While there , she is knocked unconscious by Armstrong , who spares her life by locking her in a cell . The Baroness gloats at Cate about her plans to take over the world and leaves . Cate then provokes Armstrong into an ensuing fist fight . After being defeated , Armstrong agrees to let Cate go , and defects H.A.R.M. by telling her where the list is located . Cate then realizes that she was infected after being knocked unconscious by Wagner in Hamburg days ago . The Baroness mentions that Wagner must set the count @-@ down to 10 days instead of 10 hours . Eventually , Cate obtains another antidote and later , the list located in the Baroness 's hidden lair . 
 When Cate traveled down the mountain via Gondola , defeating the H.A.R.M. helicopters in the process , she encounters Volkov and a gun duel ensues . During their duel , an explosion causes an avalanche to send Volkov over the edge of a cliff . Later , Cate is confronted by the Baroness , and another gun duel ensues . After defeating the Baroness , she reveals that she has also infected herself and is about to detonate . Cate hurries to clear the civilians off the streets , and hides inside a building as the Baroness explodes . 
 Back at UNITY 's headquarters , Cate is congratulated for a mission well done , and everybody leaves to grab some rest . Cate arrives at a graveyard where Bruno was buried to pay her respects . She is then confronted by the supposedly long @-@ dead Tom Goodman , who reveals that he is the real traitor within UNITY , and a final gun duel ensues . Cate manages to injure Tom and arrest him , but Smith shoots Tom , causing him to fall into a freshly dug grave . Smith then tries to shoot Cate as well , but Jones shoots Smith , and reveals that Bruno is still alive . Smith attempts his one last effort to shoot Cate , but Cate kills Smith just in time . With Tom and Smith shot dead , Jones and Bruno decide to tell Cate the truth ; Bruno falsified his death so that Cate and the rest of UNITY could find the real traitor . Seven years ago , Smith was taken out of the field by UNITY due to his inadequate fieldwork . In order to sabotage UNITY as a way to avenge himself , Smith joins H.A.R.M. to kill the real Tom Goodman , and replace him with an impostor ; a vacuum cleaner salesman named Melvin <unk> who Smith met in a bar in Florida . When Cate 's investigation initially foiled H.A.R.M. ' s plan , both Tom and Smith 's impostor were forced to reveal their true intentions . Cate reacts in shock upon finding out the truth . 
 In a scene after the credits , it is revealed that Volkov survived the avalanche , and reports back to H.A.R.M. ' s mysterious Director , a middle @-@ aged drunk man who Cate has seen several times in different countries during the game . In a level exclusive to the Game of the Year Edition , Cate is sent on vacation to a small island , only to discover and destroy a secret H.A.R.M. base .

 = = Production = = 
 = = = Development = = = 
 Work on No One Lives Forever started in 1998 , after the release of Monolith Productions ' previous game , Shogo : Mobile Armor Division . Craig Hubbard , game designer for Shogo and NOLF expressed that Shogo " ( although critically successful ) fell embarrassingly short of [ the team 's ] original design goals " , and " it is a grim reminder of the perils of wild optimism and unchecked ambition " exercised by the relatively small development team . The team ( which included approximately 18 core members during development of NOLF ) was determined not to make the same mistakes again with their next game . Describing the pressure on Monolith , Hubbard said that they " were still trying to live down the stigma " of their 1998 game , Blood II : The Chosen , which had been prematurely released buggy and unpolished , and that the company " had a lot to prove , both to ourselves and the gaming public . " 
 Signing a contract with a publisher was a very difficult task for Monolith . Development had been going on for months , and the project had been approved by different publishers four times , before they were able to actually sign a deal with one . During this long time for finding a publishing partner , No One Lives Forever " mutated constantly in order to please prospective producers and marketing departments . The game actually started off as a mission @-@ based , anime @-@ inspired , paramilitary action thriller intended as a spiritual sequel to Shogo and ended up as a 60s spy adventure in the tradition of Our Man Flint and countless other 60s spy movies and shows . " This final theme for the game was settled on through discussions with Fox Interactive , the final publisher of NOLF . ( Parts of the initial " paramilitary action thriller " concept evolved into F.E.A.R. , another Monolith game , released after the NOLF series , in 2005 . ) Monolith 's producer for the game , Samantha Ryan said that before the deal was signed , " [ t ] here was a period where Monolith was two weeks from death . And Jason [ " Jace " Hall , CEO and co @-@ founder of Monolith ] closed the deal with Fox Interactive that basically saved the company . " 
 After finally signing a contract with Fox ( which partnership was announced to the public on August 24 , 1999 ) , the team was able to draft a mission statement , which stood as a point of reference during every aspect of developing the game . 
 Our primary aim was to make the player feel like the hero of a 60s action / adventure / espionage movie . We came up with a list of the characteristics we felt were necessary to achieve our objective . The game must have a strong narrative , with twists and turns in the spirit of Charade or Where Eagles Dare . It must feature a fiercely competent hero and an assortment of despicable villains . The hero must have access to an impressive arsenal of weapons and gadgets worthy of Our Man Flint , Danger : Diabolik , or Get Smart . There must be memorable , death @-@ defying situations , opportunities for stealth as well as all @-@ out action , and a variety of exotic locales to explore . Finally , every aspect of the presentation must convincingly evoke the era . 
 The game was announced at the 1999 Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) conference show . While at this time – as described in the mission statement above – the game was already set out to be a spy @-@ themed shooter set in the 1960s , the version that was previewed to the press at this time had many differences to the finished product , with regard to characters , plot and setting . The game 's protagonist was originally set out to be a male character called Adam Church who worked for <unk> , " Her Majesty 's Most Secret Service " . However , many of the final gameplay and story elements are known to have been present in this earlier iteration of the game : the H.A.R.M. organization ; the defection of an East German biophysicist for information about a top @-@ secret Soviet weapons program ; the presence of humor in the game ; some locations , such as the sunken cargo freighter ; the use of gadgets , such as the rocket launching briefcase ; etc . 
 By at least July 1999 , Monolith has decided to introduce many major changes to the game ; the main reason being that the gaming press unexpectedly started comparing the game to James Bond games , like GoldenEye 007 ( 1997 ) . Hubbard mentioned that their intention was to " make a 60s spy game " , and that they " didn 't want to make a ' Bond ' style game , so when people were obviously drawing that comparison , we decided to rework things a bit . We wanted to get away from the Bond comparisons that people were making , so we 've changed the main character and the back @-@ story a fair amount . " As a result , the player controls a female protagonist in the final game , Cate Archer , who works for an organization called UNITY . Changing the main character to a woman not only helped the separation of the game from the Bond franchise , but also allowed for " more interesting dramatic possibilities " , and the " list of gadgets got a lot more visually interesting " . As Hubbard said , before switching to a female protagonist , he had been " struggling with trying to distinguish him from all the other male <unk> from the era — extraordinarily handsome , intelligent , knowledgeable , resourceful , and so on . But a woman with those same characteristics immediately stood out because of the social climate of the time . No matter how qualified she might be , she 'd have to overcome some serious barriers just to get a chance to prove herself . And if things didn 't go flawlessly on a mission , she 'd catch more heat than she deserved . " 
 The female protagonist " went through numerous concept sketches , costume designs , hairstyles , names , and even nationalities . " According to Hubbard , it was a challenge to find a look for her that was not only evocative of era , " but also worked as a 3D model . " In the end , the in @-@ game model of Cate Archer was styled after model and actress Mitzi Martin . This was a marketing decision made by the publisher , Fox Interactive , which used its feature film casting department to look for an appropriate model internationally . Archer 's voice was provided by American voice actress Kit Harris , who also did the voice of the Inge Wagner character . Originally , Harris recorded the Scottish protagonist 's voice in a stronger Scottish accent . This was changed after a Scottish producer of the game felt that the particular accent used was too lower class , and an inappropriate choice ; Harris re @-@ recorded her lines with a " British bent " instead . Both the face and the voice of the character were changed in the game 's sequel , No One Lives Forever 2 : A Spy in H.A.R.M. ' s Way . 
 Along with the character and plot changes , it was also decided to change the game 's working title , No One Lives Forever , to something else , for similar reasons related to the Bond franchise ( in particular , the novel Nobody Lives for Ever ) , as well as possible legal considerations . However , the title , in fact , stayed throughout the development , and " The Operative " ( referring to the game 's heroine , Agent Archer ) was added to the beginning of the title . 
 After the game 's release , Hubbard identified the realistic expectations set by the team as a strong point in the game 's development , saying that " given our budget , team size , and development cycle , the best we could hope to do was to create a fun , engaging 60s espionage game that would make up in presentation what it lacked in innovation . " Other positive aspects of the process included the aforementioned mission statement , along with the flexible systems used in development , the cohesion of the team , and effective scheduling . On the other hand , Hubbard cited difficulties in fleshing out the final team , as well as inefficient pre @-@ production , delays due to waiting on technology , and the major difficulties in finding a publisher . Hubbard also mentioned the cinematic cutscenes as lengthy and problematic , partly because of technical difficulties , and partly because of conceptual flaws on his behalf , with regard to screenwriting . Regarding gameplay , he said that " [ o ] ne of the main failings of NOLF [ ... ] was that it ended up feeling a lot more scripted and linear than it was intended to be " . Hubbard also expressed dissatisfaction with the balance between action and intrigue : " Unfortunately , we came up a little short on intrigue . Stealth was too unforgiving . Once you were spotted , you were playing an action game . " The team paid attention to these points while developing No One Lives Forever 2 . 
 According to Hubbard , the team 's " greatest asset was [ probably ] the list of mistakes we made during Shogo . We started this project with a pretty sober view of what we could achieve . As a result , every major feature we outlined made it into the game , as well as a few additional items we came up with during the project . " However , there were still things that the team didn 't have enough time to implement . For example , No One Lives Forever 's team @-@ based multiplayer portion was originally going to be a story @-@ driven cooperative gameplay mode ( similar to the " Assault " game type in the 1999 first @-@ person shooter Unreal Tournament ) , including objectives and obstacles for the two teams . Like the single @-@ player story in the game , this gameplay mode was also going to incorporate humor ; for example , in one map , a goal of each team was to find a special watermelon for a mayor in a Moroccan marketplace . While this mode was publicly discussed even in July 2000 , it is not present as such in the final product ( which went gold on October 20 ) . The different objectives were changed to a general goal for both teams in all maps : photographing the other team 's intelligence item . However , a number of remnants stemming from the earlier gameplay design can be seen in some of the released maps , such as the office of the aforementioned mayor seen in the Morocco map . Fully realized co @-@ operative multiplayer was , however , a feature of No One Lives Forever 2 . 
 = = = Technology = = = 
 No One Lives Forever utilizes the Lithtech game engine , which was originally developed by Monolith , and later by its subsidiary , LithTech , Inc ( later known as Touchdown Entertainment ) . The game is based on Lithtech 2 @.@ 5 ( the first game to use this version ) , with many custom additions and modifications to support the game 's design , such as support for vehicles . According to the game 's creators , characters in NOLF were built from more polygons than any other PC action game at the time , with Cate Archer 's model having approximately 1700 polygons . 
 The artificial intelligence ( AI ) in NOLF was significantly advanced at the time of the game 's release . Enemy AI can react to eleven different stimuli , including hearing the player 's footsteps or weapon firing , seeing the player 's footprints in the snow , or hearing an ally scream in pain . The AI can try and investigate the source of these stimuli , by following the footprints for example , and can sound alarms or call for backup . During combat , the AI finds cover positions , and , to some extent , can also use its environment for protection , such as flipping over a table and hiding behind it . After advancing AI technology in their subsequent games , Monolith likened the way NOLF 's AIs pop randomly in and out of cover to a shooting gallery . Groups of AI guards make use of a group logic when investigating and combating the player . For example , one guard might start firing at the player , while another runs and calls for backup . The game 's AI includes friendly and enemy humans , as well as dogs , sharks , and helicopters .

 = = = Influences and humor = = = 
 In terms of video games , Monolith drew inspiration from a number of stealth / action games , such as Metal Gear Solid ( 1998 ) , Tenchu : Stealth Assassins ( 1998 ) , Syphon Filter ( 1999 ) , and GoldenEye 007 ( 1997 ) , because the team was " interested in a blend of stealth and action rather than focusing on one or the other exclusively . " The original release of the 1981 stealth game Castle Wolfenstein was also cited as being influential . 
 Thematically , influences behind The Operative : No One Lives Forever were primarily 1960s spy @-@ themed films , novels , television shows , as well as historical references . When it was decided that NOLF was going to be a 1960s spy game , lead designer Craig Hubbard started immersing himself in the subject matter , in order to " develop some fluency " in it . As he explained , he " was a big fan of early Bond films , but didn 't know a lot about the whole spy craze . So I watched the Derek Flint movies [ Our Man Flint , In Like Flint ] , Modesty Blaise , Matt Helm , Danger : Diabolik , Avengers – anything I could get my hands on . " Other influences included books , such as The Spy Who Came in from the Cold , TV shows like The Saint , The Pink Panther films , commando movies , such as The Guns of Navarone , as well as " lots of historical references , encompassing everything from books and documentaries on the spy trade to fashion catalogs and interior @-@ design books . " The basis for the biological explosives plot was the 1967 film Casino Royale . According to Hubbard , " the idea was to create a game that would make you feel like a superspy , so we tried to come up with situations , characters , and settings to support that goal . " During the course of the game , the player can hear explicit popular culture references , including the TV series The Prisoner and The Fugitive , the Matt Helm films The Silencers and The <unk> , and exotica musicians Les Baxter and <unk> <unk> . Other conversations allude to major events of the time , such as the studio years of The Beatles , and the commercial failure of the Edsel automobile . 
 Humor plays an important role in No One Lives Forever . As Hubbard explained , the game 's intention is " to make you laugh , but not at the expense of providing a broader , more satisfying emotional experience than a spoof generally allows , so that even if you don 't chuckle once , you can still have plenty of fun playing the game . At heart , NOLF is an action / adventure / espionage game with a healthy dose of levity . " Humor is presented mainly via visual gags , overheard conversations , textual intelligence items , and cutscenes . The humor includes " situational humor , and even a dash of absurdity and bathroom humor for good measure . Some of it is subtle , some of it isn 't . " The name of UNITY , H.A.R.M. , and other fictional organizations mentioned in the game follow the spy genre formula of using contrived acronyms for organizations ( see List of fictional espionage organizations ) . What H.A.R.M. actually stands for is never revealed , and speculation about its true meaning is used as a running gag in the game and its sequel . 
 Regarding comparisons between the game and the Austin Powers film series , Hubbard pointed out on several occasions that , unlike Austin Powers , No One Lives Forever is not a parody of the spy genre . Contrasting the source of the humor in the two series , Hubbard noted that while the game is " campy and silly , [ ... ] the underlying premise borders on apocalyptic . That dichotomy in tone results in a very different style of humor from a parody , where everything is in good fun and nobody , including the characters , takes anything very seriously . " 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The soundtrack for the original version of No One Lives Forever ( as well as the later Mac OS X port ) was chiefly composed and produced by Guy Whitmore . The game uses <unk> technology , and its music is an example of an adaptive score : the music smoothly and flexibly adapts to the situations that players finds themselves in , in order to simulate film soundtracks . For instance , the music increases in tempo or urgency when the player is in a combat situation , or if enemies become aware of the player 's presence . Whitmore 's task as composer was " to capture the flavor of the ' 50s / ' 60s spy genre , without infringing on any existing copyrights . " In order to avoid any legal troubles over music from the James Bond franchise of films and games , Whitmore was initially asked to refrain from using brass instruments ; a directive he compared to " being asked to produce a blues album without guitars " . While some of the instrument sounds came from professional collections , others were home @-@ made samples , including solo cello sounds performed by Lori Goldston , used in the H.A.R.M. theme . Influences for the score included German composer Peter Thomas , the soundtrack of the 1968 film Barbarella , and " an array of Italian composers who did beautiful scores for low budget European erotic films . " 
 Whitmore 's adaptive score was not used for the PlayStation 2 version of the game . Instead , it featured original music by Rebecca Kneubuhl , and mixed by Gabriel Mann . The No One Lives Forever theme song was created by Rich Ragsdale . Kneubuhl and Mann also provided vocals for the title theme . 
 = = = = In the Lounge = = = = 
 The game was released with bonus 1960s @-@ inspired music on the second CD . The songs available on this album , titled In the Lounge , were not featured in the game , but were specifically written as extra material . The 9 songs were written by Rebecca Kneubuhl ( who created the in @-@ game score for the later PlayStation 2 port as well ) , and were recorded at Asylum Studios . The CD also features two songs by independent artists : " Void " by Red Delicious and " El Dorado " by Archie Thompson . These were selected for inclusion as part of a NOLF online " music search " , organized by Fox Interactive and <unk> 
 A different version of In the Lounge was also created . This includes the same 9 original tracks , although in a slightly different order . It does not include the two indie songs ; however , it does feature Rich Ragsdale 's NOLF title theme , as well as remixes of 6 of the original songs , by Gabriel Mann .

 With the rise of digital distribution in video games in the latter part of the 2000s , there has been speculation about a possible re @-@ release , or even a remake of the titles in the No One Lives Forever series . However , a number of reports have pointed out the complicated state of the series ' intellectual property ( IP ) rights . Even parties that have strong ties to the IP , including video game publisher Activision and NOLF designer Craig Hubbard , have publicly admitted not knowing the precise legal situation of the series , as of May 2014 . 
 In April 2013 , Activision community manager Dan Amrich attempted to explain the acquisition history of the No One Lives Forever IP in a public video . This history includes the 2003 acquisition of NOLF publisher Fox Interactive by Vivendi Universal Games ( who also owned Sierra Entertainment ) , as well as the 2008 merger between Vivendi Universal Games ( <unk> , which had since been renamed Vivendi Games ) and video game publisher Activision , forming the Activision Blizzard holding company . After the merger , Activision decided to sell off some IPs and retain others . In order to find out the legal details behind NOLF , Amrich asked his colleagues , saying that " [ t ] he person that I normally talk to about this stuff does not believe that we [ at Activision ] currently have the rights . They 've never seen it , they 've never been given the permission to put that stuff on [ GOG.com ] . He said , basically , ' If we had it , I would love to be able to reissue those old games . ' " Amrich also asked a friend of his who working at NOLF developer Monolith ( since acquired by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment ) , who also did not know who the IP belonged to . Amrich concluded that " at this time I do not believe that Activision has the rights to No One Lives Forever . " 
 When asked about the rights to the game in July 2013 , NOLF designer Craig Hubbard also expressed confusion about the legal complexities behind the series . According to Hubbard , " my understanding was that Monolith owned the IP and Fox owned the title of the first game , which was technically The Operative : No One Lives Forever . I think Monolith actually owned A Spy in H.A.R.M. ' s Way , the subtitle of the sequel , but I could be wrong about that . Fox got acquired by <unk> , which in turn got acquired by Activision , while Monolith got bought by Warner Brothers , so some stars would have to align for everything to get sorted out . " Hubbard added that " there didn 't seem to be any interest in resurrecting the franchise " as of 2012 , while he was still working at Monolith / Warner Bros. 
 A possible venue for re @-@ release of the games would be computer game sale and distribution service GOG.com. In an interview with GOG.com 's Trevor Longino , he said that " NOLF is a really great title , and it ’ s one of the ones where the rights are a bear to get sorted . Just like pretty much any other classic IP you ’ re ever thought of , we ’ ve looked into it , but it ’ s not an easy thing to do . " 
 In April 2013 , Night Dive Studios , a publisher specializing in re @-@ releasing classic video games , have posted on its Facebook page that they " have a pretty good idea of where the rights are " , and that they are " hot on the trail " . The studio later added that they are " making considerable progress , " but they refused to share more information on the matter . In May 2014 , reports revealed that Night Dive Studios has filed for trademark applications for the terms " No One Lives Forever " , " The Operative " , " A Spy in H.A.R.M. ' s Way " , and " Contract J.A.C.K. " , which are the titles and subtitles of the games in the series . In response to inquiries about the studio 's acquisition of the NOLF rights , Night Dive Studio CEO Stephen Kick sent the following statement to the press : " At this time we are unable to comment on future plans . I would like to add that our team has a great fondness for these games and our hope is that they will one day be re @-@ released . " Nonetheless , the news have prompted some to assume that a re @-@ release might be coming soon . 
 Night Dive Studios reported to Kotaku in February 2015 that their attempts to remake the game had fallen through due to the inability to get the three companies with IP stake in the game - Activision , 20th Century Fox , and Warner Bros. - to grant them the rights for the remake . While they had the source code and assets for both No One Lives Forever and the sequels to make for modern computers , they opted to drop the project after meeting resistance from the IP holders .

 = Brian Goes Back to College = 
 " Brian Goes Back to College " is the 15th episode of Family Guy ' s fourth season . The episode originally aired on Sunday November 13 , 2005 . Guest stars on the show were Ralph Garman , Mark Hentemann and Phil LaMarr . The episode was described by show creator Seth MacFarlane to be " a real treat for The A @-@ Team fans " . The episode contained several connections with The New Yorker ; in response , they wrote a friendly article about the episode . The plot consists of Peter , Joe , Cleveland and Quagmire winning a costume contest dressed as characters from The A @-@ Team , and deciding to improve their community by continuing to act like the characters of the show . Brian is hired by The New Yorker , but is later dismissed as he did not complete college , so he returns to finish his education . It was rated TV @-@ 14 @-@ D in the United States and was rated 12 in the United Kingdom . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Peter , Joe , Cleveland , and Quagmire win a costume contest as characters from The A @-@ Team ( because they had an actual black guy as B. A. <unk> and the other team had a Jewish man for the same role ) . Peter and his friends find Brian , who is writing a report for the local newspaper . When Peter and his friends win the costume contest , Brian writes a report about it , and is later telephoned by a member of The New Yorker , who tell him they would like him to work for their magazine . Brian is initially given a warm welcome by the staff , but he is immediately fired after he informs them he never graduated from college . Meanwhile , disappointed at no longer being able to be The A @-@ Team , Peter decides to become an unofficial A @-@ Team alongside Joe , Cleveland , and Quagmire , and decide to help their local community . Peter designs a replica of the van used by The A @-@ Team . 
 After encouragement from Lois , Brian decides to return to Brown University in order to complete his education so he can go back to The New Yorker . Stewie , unknowing to Brian , returns to college with him . Brian 's new teacher ( the Stephen Hawking @-@ esque man from " Ready , Willing , and Disabled " ) takes an instant disliking to him , but his opinion of Brian quickly changes after he cheats on a test by plagiarizing Stewie 's work with his permission ( due to Stewie 's knowledge of technology and physics ) and gets a high mark . Brian goes to tell his teacher that he cheated , but is interrupted , as the teacher tells him Brian has inspired him , and he was so depressed that he was planning to commit suicide . Meanwhile , Peter becomes very satisfied with his A @-@ Team 's actions , but the team fails a mission to save a local park from demolition by becoming " side @-@ tracked by idle conversation " with the builders . The guilty A @-@ Team disbands afterwards . Brian eventually cracks under the pressure of a final test and knowing he will only pass if he cheats , he decides to return home with Stewie . A shocked Lois attempts to encourage him to go back and finish the test , and eventually chases him away with a vacuum cleaner called " Mr. Hoover " . 
 Brian ends up exercising for hours with the help of Stewie , parodying Rocky Balboa in the movie Rocky IV , but realizes his test is only a few hours away . He becomes stressed at being late for his exam , so Lois persuades Peter to revive The A @-@ Team one last time and drive Brian to his test , which is successful , and Brian arrives on time . He fails his test , but remains proud of himself for not cheating , much to the dismay of the family , who tells him that he probably should have cheated . Brian tries to reassure them that he finished what he started and labels his pride of that ' something ' , but the Griffins shoot him down for that . 
 = = Production = = 
 Several people who were involved in the production of the original A @-@ Team worked with show producers for this episode . Ron Jones wrote the music during the scene where Peter and his friends help the man in the bar ; Jones had also written music for the actual The A @-@ Team series in the 1980s . This episode marks the third appearance of Brian 's wheelchair @-@ using teacher ; he originally appears in " Ready , Willing , and Disabled " and " Brian the Bachelor " when playing in the Special Olympics during the former episode and attempting to become a candidate for The Bachelorette in the latter episode . The professor 's and his wife 's voices were not played by a real person ; they were made from a generic computer system in the studio . A deleted scene was animated which showed the professor informing Brian that he once had a student who was identical to him , but instead took human form and had a mustache . David Goodman commented this as being a pretty strange gag . Several viewers contacted Greg Colton , a Family Guy director , asking him if Roger Williams Park ( a real public park in Rhode Island ) was due to be demolished . He commented that one couple were extremely worried , because they were due to have their wedding there . The title of the episode was originally meant to be " Brian Goes Back to College and Stewie Goes With Him for Obvious Comedic Reasons " , but it was deemed too long . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 Peter and his friends parody the 1980s American drama series The A @-@ Team . When the introduction sequence of The A @-@ Team was made for the episode , it took the writers and producers several attempts to animate it correctly . The background images used were real images used from The A @-@ Team 's intro sequence . When Brian is shown to be exercising heavily at a ski resort under the supervision of Stewie , and then climbs the mountain and shouts from the top , the montage is a reference to Rocky IV . The 1980s television convention that the gang attends features references to Too Close for Comfort ( " Cosmic Cow Autographs " ) and The Cosby Show ( " Bill Cosby aerobics " ) . At the American football game , the teams playing are " Brown " and the " Board of Education " , referencing the Brown v. Board of Education court case in 1954 which led to desegregation in the US school system .

 The New Yorker wrote a friendly response article to this episode , as they were featured in it . They appeared to take no offense at the episode , and did not retaliate . Ryan J.

 = Margaret Lea Houston = 
 Margaret Lea Houston ( April 11 , 1819 – December 3 , 1867 ) was First Lady of the Republic of Texas during her husband Sam Houston 's second term as President of the Republic of Texas . They met following the first of his two non @-@ consecutive terms as the Republic 's president , and married when he was a representative in the Congress of the Republic of Texas . She was his third wife , remaining with him until his death . 
 She came from a close @-@ knit family in Alabama , many of whom also moved to Texas when she married the man who was an accomplished politician in both Tennessee and Texas , and who had won the Battle of San Jacinto during the Texas Revolution . The couple had eight children , and she gave birth to most of them while he was away attending to politics . Her mother Nancy Lea was a constant in their lives , helping with the children , managing the household help , and always providing either financial assistance or temporary housing . With the help of her extended family in Texas , she convinced her husband to give up both alcohol and profane language . He believed his wife to be an exemplary woman of faith . Under her influence he converted to the Baptist denomination , after he had many years previously been baptized a Catholic in Nacogdoches , Texas . 
 Following the Annexation of Texas to the United States , Sam Houston shuttled back and forth to Washington , D.C. as the state 's U. S. senator for 13 years , while Margaret remained in Texas raising their children . When he was elected the state 's governor , Margaret became First Lady of the state of Texas and was pregnant with their last child . Her brief tenure came on the cusp of the Civil War , at a time when the state was torn apart over the debate of whether or not to secede from the United States , while her husband worked in vain to defeat the Texas Ordinance of Secession . There had been an assassination attempt on his life , and angry mobs gathered in the streets near the governor 's mansion . With children to protect , and no government security forces in place , she lived in fear for her family 's safety . 
 Her husband was removed from office by the Texas Secession Convention for refusing to swear loyalty to the Confederacy . Margaret became a war @-@ time mother whose oldest son joined the Confederate army and was taken prisoner at the Battle of Shiloh . Her husband died before the end of the war . In her few remaining years , she became the keeper of the Sam Houston legacy and opened his records to a trusted biographer . When she died of yellow fever 31 ⁄ 2 years later , Margaret could not be buried with her husband in a public cemetery in Huntsville for fear of contamination , and was instead interred next to her mother on private property . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Margaret Moffette Lea was born April 11 , 1819 into a family of devout Baptists in Perry County , Alabama . Her father Temple Lea was a church deacon and the state treasurer of the Alabama Baptist Convention , and her mother Nancy Moffette Lea was the only woman delegate at the convention 's formation . Margaret was the fifth of six children that included older siblings Martin , Varilla , Henry Clinton and Vernal , as well as younger sister Antoinette . The Lea cotton plantation had been acquired with money from a Moffette family inheritance , and was operated by Nancy . 
 When her father died in 1834 , she inherited four slaves that included Joshua and Eliza , her favorite . The older Lea children had married prior to Temple 's death , but Vernal , Margaret and Antoinette accompanied the widowed Nancy when she moved into her son Henry 's home at Marion . He was an accomplished attorney who sat on the boards of educational institutions , and would be elected to the Alabama State Senate in 1836 . Margaret was enrolled at Professor McLean 's School , and also attended Judson Female Institute . The latter was founded by Baptists to instruct genteel young women in what were acceptable goals of their time and place , " proficiency in needlework , dancing , drawing , and penmanship " . Heavy emphasis was put on Baptist theology and missionary work . She wrote poetry and read romantic novels , while also becoming accomplished in guitar , harp and piano . Reverend Peter Crawford baptized her in the Siloam Baptist Church of Marion when she was 19 , by which time the eligible young lady was considered " accomplished , well @-@ connected and deeply religious . "

 Sam Houston was an attorney by profession and politically accomplished even before he moved to Texas . In Tennessee , he had been both a member of the United States House of Representatives and Governor of Tennessee . His military victory at the Battle of San Jacinto elevated him to hero status in Texas . After completing his first term as President of the Republic of Texas in early December 1838 , he continued to practice law from his office in San Augustine . He arrived in Mobile , Alabama in the early months of 1839 as a partner of the Sabine City Company , seeking investors to develop a community that is today known as Sabine Pass . Through Martin Lea , he made the acquaintance of Antoinette 's husband William Bledsoe , a wealthy businessman who in turn suggested Nancy Lea as a possible investor . Invited to a garden party at Martin 's home , it was there Houston first became acquainted with Margaret . The mutual attraction was instantaneous . 
 Nancy was favorably impressed with Houston 's land sales pitch , but not so impressed with his interest in her daughter . She and others in the family were concerned about his reputation as a hard @-@ drinking carouser with a proclivity for profanity , who was 26 years older than Margaret and twice married . Several weeks of love letters had been exchanged between Margaret and Houston by the time he proposed marriage that summer of 1839 , presenting her with his image carved on a brooch . In an effort to assuage the family 's opposition to the union , Houston spent several weeks in the Lea home in Alabama . 
 In September during his absence from Texas , his supporters in San Augustine County elected him to serve in the Republic of Texas House of Representatives . When the couple 's engagement was announced in newspapers , the Leas were not the only ones who were skeptical . Acquaintances in Texas were well versed with his personal history and aware that he had not divorced the first wife when he married again , only recently obtaining that divorce with hopes of marrying a Texas woman who , as it played out , rejected him for another suitor . Political crony Barnard E. Bee , Sr. tried to discourage him from making a third attempt at marriage , believing him to be " totally disqualified for domestic happiness . " 
 As the May 9 , 1840 wedding day grew close , some family members still looked upon him with uncertainty and were determined to stop what they believed would be a disastrous union for Margaret . She would not be deterred , however , and the Reverend Peter Crawford officiated over the wedding of Margaret and the man she had fallen in love with . The newlyweds spent their honeymoon week at the Lafayette Hotel before sailing to Galveston , where Nancy and the <unk> had already established residences . Houston retained a house he owned in Houston City , but Margaret had no taste for the hustle and bustle and preferred the lesser populated Galveston . She and her personal slaves who had accompanied the newlyweds from Alabama shared her mother 's house while Houston traveled . 
 = = First Lady of the Republic = = 
 The year before he met Margaret , Houston had purchased property at Cedar Point on Galveston Bay in Chambers County , which he named Raven Moor , and planned to expand with income from his law practice . The existing 2 @-@ room log <unk> house with its detached slaves ' quarters overlooked Galveston Bay and became the newlyweds ' first home , filled with both Margaret 's personal furnishings from Alabama , as well as newer pieces . She renamed it Ben Lomond as a tip of the hat to the romantic Walter Scott works she had read , and delegated management of the household to her mother Nancy . 
 During his second term as representative from San Augustine , Houston was elected in 1841 to once again serve as the Republic 's president . Margaret disliked campaign events and giving up her privacy , frequently staying home while her husband traveled about the Republic canvassing for votes . Yet , when she rose to the occasion , such as the extended post @-@ election tour of San Augustine County and victory celebrations in Washington County and Houston City , the public adored her , and she became an impressive political asset . She rode in a local presidential parade , but stayed home rather than travel to the inauguration in Austin . When the couple appeared at several events in Nacogdoches , his old friends took notice of his total avoidance of alcohol , and he continued to assure her that he was giving it up completely . He also began to clean up his language to please his new wife , and would eventually claim to have eliminated his profanity altogether . 
 Approximately 26 miles ( 42 km ) north of Ben Lomond , the <unk> operated a sugar cane plantation at Grand Cane in Liberty County . Financially supplemented by Nancy , the plantation became a family gathering place . About a year after Vernal and Mary Lea also moved to there , Mary suffered a pregnancy miscarriage . Not long after that , the couple accepted trusteeship of a 7 @-@ year @-@ old Galveston orphan named Virginia Thorne , who was then placed in the care of Nancy . It was a problematic relationship from the beginning , and would grow to have legal ramifications for Margaret . 
 Events leading up to the 1842 Battle of Salado Creek caused Houston to believe that Mexico was planning a full @-@ scale invasion to re @-@ take Texas . In response , he moved the Republic 's capital farther east to Washington @-@ on @-@ the @-@ Brazos , and sent Margaret back to her relatives in Alabama . Upon her later return , they temporarily lived with the Lockhart family at Washington @-@ on @-@ the @-@ Brazos until they were able to acquire a small home there . The couple 's first child Sam Houston , Jr. was born in the new house on May 25 , 1843 . Upon learning of her son Martin 's death in a duel , Nancy moved in with the Houstons , helping Margaret with the new baby , and over Houston 's objections , pitching in with some financial assistance for food and household necessities .

 When his presidential term ended on December 9 , 1844 , Houston turned his attention to the Raven Hill plantation he had acquired that year northwest of Grand Cane and east of Huntsville . Margaret 's slave Joshua was put in charge of the carpentry to build her a new house . Nancy , Margaret and sister Antoinette devoted their time to activities in Grand Cane 's Concord Baptist Church , of which they were founding members . She continued to be a wife who was happiest when she and her husband stayed close to home . Although she accompanied him to President Andrew Jackson 's Tennessee funeral in the summer of 1845 , she did not attend <unk> held in her husband 's honor by his old friends and supporters . During the latter part of the year , Antoinette 's husband William died , followed a few months later by the death of Vernal 's wife Mary . Prior to her death , she had elicited a promise from Margaret to assume the trusteeship of Virginia Thorne . 
 Texas officially relinquished its sovereignty on February 19 , 1846 to become the 28th state in the union , and Houston was elected by the Texas state legislature to serve in the United States Senate . Margaret 's pregnancy prevented her from accompanying him , so when time and duty permitted he traveled back and forth between Texas and a temporary hotel residence in the nation 's capital . When Reverend George W. Samson first met Houston at the E @-@ Street Baptist Church in Washington , D.C. , the senator told him that his attendance had been influenced by " one of the best Christians on earth , " his wife Margaret . For the duration of his senatorial service , Houston regularly attended the E @-@ Street church , sharing his wife 's letters with Samson and delving into theological discussions pertaining to Margaret 's interpretation of scriptures . 
 Margaret 's sister Antoinette eloped with wealthy Galveston businessman Charles Power in April and began a new life on his sugar plantation . Houston was home during a Congressional recess when their second child Nancy ( Nannie ) Elizabeth Houston was born at Raven Hill on September 6 . About this time , in a letter to Houston that gave insight into Nancy 's forceful constant presence in their lives , Margaret conceded , " She is high spirited and a little overbearing , I admit ... " but advised her husband to just give in to the insignificant issues . Houston replied , " I love the old Lady as a Mother , and have resolved to defer to her age and her disposition . Her blood is much like my own . " 
 During the early part of 1847 , Houston 's letters to Margaret were filled with his weariness of being away from home , and his concern that he had no letters from her for weeks . He promised that at the end of the current legislative session , he would " ... fly with all speed to meet and greet my Love and embrace our little ones . " When she finally answered , she initially only told him of a serious illness that Sam Jr. had since recovered from , even though he was aware of previous problems she had with a breast lump . She had been advised to see a specialist in Memphis , Tennessee if there was a recurrence . When complications appeared , family friend Dr. Ashbel Smith recommended surgery in Texas ; only then , did she inform her husband of the situation . In an era before the development of anesthesia , her only alternative to bear the pain was to bite on a coin . Upon receipt of her letter , Houston immediately departed Washington , D.C. 
 After his return home , Houston negotiated a labor @-@ swap arrangement with Raven Hill 's overseer Captain Frank Hatch . In lieu of a cash payment for his services , the bulk of Houston 's slave labor force was engaged to work on Hatch 's property at Bermuda Spring . The remaining slaves were retained as house labor for Margaret . Eventually , Houston became the owner of Bermuda Spring when he and Hatch swapped properties , and he set about to build the Woodland home for his wife . The first child to be born in the house was Margaret ( Maggie ) Lea Houston , arriving on April 13 , 1848 while Congress was in session and Houston in Washington , D.C. 
 The widowed Vernal remarried to Catherine Davis Goodall in 1849 , but trusteeship of Virginia Thorne , by now a teenager , remained with Margaret . With most of his time spent in the nation 's capital , Houston 's perception of Thorne was primarily second @-@ hand <unk> from Margaret 's letters ; yet , he disliked and distrusted the orphaned girl to the point where he feared for the health and safety of his children with her in the house . Exacerbating the situation was Margaret 's disapproval of the relationship that the teenage girl developed with overseer Thomas Gott . Push literally came to shove during an incident when Margaret disciplined her for what she believed was rough handling of one of the children . Thorne alleged that during the ensuing dispute over the situation , Margaret had used threats and physical violence against her . After she eloped with Gott a month later , the couple filed assault and battery charges against Margaret . When a grand jury investigation resulted in a deadlock , the matter was referred to the local Baptist church that Margaret helped found , and she was acquitted of the charges . Houston came to believe that the filing of legal charges against his wife had been encouraged by his political enemies . 
 Daughter Mary William ( Mary Willie ) Houston was born on April 9 , 1850 in the Woodland house during another Congressional session when Houston was in the nation 's capital . Their fourth child Antoinette ( Nettie ) Power Houston arrived on January 20 , 1852 while he was again away on a business . 
 Many friends and acquaintances came to visit the Houstons at Woodland , including members of the Alabama @-@ Coushatta Tribe who had allied with Houston during the Texas Revolution ; and he in return had assisted them in their being granted a reservation in east Texas . Throughout the last years of his presidency , Houston had made numerous efforts for the Republic to find common ground with the various tribes , asserting their right to own land . Many tribes had come to respect him as their friend .

 Nancy moved southwest of Huntsville to Independence in 1852 , and much of the remaining Lea family began to form its nucleus in the Washington County community . Antoinette and Charles Power were also living in Independence after their Galveston sugar plantation was decimated by a hurricane . Brothers Vernal and Henry both died that year . The following year , Varilla 's husband <unk> Royston also died and she joined the rest of the family in Independence . That August , the Houstons bought a house near the original Baylor University campus in Independence . While Houston was attending to business in Washington , D.C. , their sixth child Andrew Jackson Houston was born on June 21 , 1854 . 
 As required by Mexican federal law for property ownership in Coahuila y Tejas , Houston had been baptized into the Catholic faith in the Adolphus Sterne House in Nacogdoches prior to Texas independence . By 1854 when Houston told Rev. Samson he felt compelled to make a public profession of faith , perhaps on the floor of the United States Senate , Margaret and her family had spent 14 years influencing her husband 's faith . Ultimately , he decided to make the profession among those who knew him best in Texas . 
 Word quickly spread about Houston 's upcoming public baptism , and spectators traveled from neighboring communities to witness the event . Reverend Rufus Columbus Burleson , Baylor University president and local church pastor , performed the rite in Little Rocky Creek , 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) southeast of town . Houston afterwards still felt unworthy of taking the Eucharist and becoming a member of Margaret 's church . At her request , Reverend George Washington Baines of Brenham counseled with him to eliminate his self @-@ doubts . In gratitude and celebration , Nancy sold her silverware to purchase a bell for the Rocky Creek Baptist Church .

 The state legislature decided during Houston 's third senatorial term not to re @-@ elect him , so he ran for the office of Governor of the state of Texas , losing to Hardin Richard Runnels . He was still in Washington , D.C. when William ( Willie ) Rogers Houston was born on May 25 , 1858 , their last child born in the Woodland home . In order to satisfy creditors of his gubernatorial campaign debts , Houston was forced to sell the house to his political supporter J. Carroll Smith . He subsequently defeated incumbent Runnels with a second bid for the office during a period when the populace was bitterly divided over the issue of secession from the United States , and was sworn in December 31 , 1859 . 
 Construction on the Texas Governor 's Mansion in Austin had been completed three years earlier and first occupied by Governor Elisha M. Pease whose wife played hostess to anyone who stopped by for a visit . The Houston family and their retinue of slaves moved into the mansion during a political climate that grew increasingly hostile over the secession debate . The family furniture had been moved from Independence by Joshua , since the state government had no budget for staffing , furnishing or maintaining the governor 's residence . That financial burden fell on the shoulders of the incumbent , and the state partially defaulted on Houston 's salary . Margaret feared for the family 's safety , as her husband worked towards defeating passage of the state 's Ordinance of Secession . There had been a botched assassination attempt on Houston , and she saw throngs of angry malcontents gathering in the city . Margaret closed the mansion doors to all but those with an invitation from the Houstons . 
 As with everywhere else had they lived , she cared nothing about public life , and instead worked with Eliza and the other servants to create a home that welcomed extended family members and personal friends of the Houstons . The family and household slaves resided on the second floor of the mansion , while others lived in the stable . Houston would occasionally hire out some of his labor force . The first child born in the Texas governor 's mansion was also the last of the Houston children ; Temple Lea Houston was delivered on August 12 , 1860 . This last birth left the 41 @-@ year @-@ old Margaret debilitated for almost 2 weeks , with a watchful Houston constantly by her side . 
 The Texas Secession Convention passed the Texas Ordinance of Secession on February 1 , 1861 , effectively becoming part of the Confederate States of America on March 1 . Houston , like all other office holders in the state , was expected to take an oath of loyalty to the Confederacy . He refused and was removed from office by the Secession Convention on March 16 , succeeded by Lt. Governor Edward Clark .

 Their home in Independence having been leased out to the Baptists , retreating there was not an option . Houston was in poor health , as well as spiritually and financially broken . After a brief sojourn in Nancy 's home , and over her objections , the family returned to Ben Lomond in early April . 
 Sometime during August 1861 , Sam Jr. enlisted in the Confederate States Army 2nd Texas Infantry Regiment , Company C Bayland Guards , sending Margaret into melancholia . She dreaded that her first @-@ born child would never be home again . " My heart seems almost broken ... what shall I do ? How shall I bear it ? When I first heard the news , I thought I would lie down and die , " she wrote to her mother . Houston tried to help out by assuming care of their other children in between his extended visits to Galveston . Her fears seemed well @-@ founded when her son was critically wounded and left for dead at the April 1862 Battle of Shiloh . A second bullet was stopped by his Bible , bearing an inside inscription from Margaret . He was found languishing in a field by a Union Army clergyman who picked up the Bible and also found a letter from Margaret in his pocket . Taken prisoner and sent to Camp Douglas in Illinois , he was later released in a prisoner exchange and received a medical discharge in October . 
 Lacking the financial means to buy back their Woodland home , they rented the Steamboat House in Huntsville . The 69 @-@ year @-@ old Houston was in his final days and physically feeble , requiring the use of a cane to get around . Until daughter Maggie took over as his personal assistant , his wife shouldered the duties . Even so , during this period , he managed to get the Confederate War Department to discharge all draftees from the Alabama @-@ Coushatta tribe , which had distanced itself completely from the conflict . 
 On July 26 , 1863 , with Margaret at his bedside reading the 23rd Psalm to him , Houston died . His will named her as his executrix , and named his cousin Thomas Caruthers , as well as family friends Thomas Gibbs , J. Carroll Smith and Anthony Martin Branch as executors . He had died land rich , but cash poor . The inventory compiled of his estate after his death listed several thousand acres in real estate , $ 250 cash , slaves , a handful of livestock and his personal possessions . 
 Margaret was now a widow with seven of her eight children under the age of 18 and financially dependent on her . She returned to live near her mother in Independence , swapping land for a nearby property that became known as the Mrs. Sam Houston House . The Texas legislature eventually gave Margaret an amount equivalent to her husband 's unpaid gubernatorial salary ; nevertheless , in order to afford Sam Jr . ' s enrollment at medical school at the University of Pennsylvania , she rented out the Ben Lomond plantation . 
 Nancy Lea died of undiagnosed flu @-@ like ailments on February 7 , 1864 , and was entombed on the grounds of her home . Margaret died on December 3 , 1867 , having contracted yellow fever during an epidemic . Walter Reed would not make his discovery of the cause of yellow fever through mosquito bite until 1900 ; contamination through contact was the pervading fear in 1867 , and prevented Margaret 's remains from being interred in a public cemetery with Houston 's . She was buried in the ground beside Nancy 's tomb at 11 p.m. by her servant Bingley , family friend Major Eber Cave , and her two daughters Nettie and Mary Willie . No funeral service was performed . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Two years after Houston 's death , Baylor University president William Carey Crane was commissioned by Margaret to write her husband 's biography , allowing complete access to all correspondence and records . Crane was a Lea family friend from Alabama who had little more than a passing acquaintance with " the hero of San Jacinto " . His perception of Margaret , however , was that of an extraordinary woman , in many aspects equal to the man she married . He stated that Houston 's " guardian angel " , as he called her , had set out from the time she met Houston to refine his rough edges and provide a solid foundation for his personal life . That assessment of Margaret 's relationship with her husband was echoed over a century later by author James L. Haley , " ... Houston trusted the care of his soul to Margaret , that he had no more war to fight within himself , left him with more energy to wage political battle . " Ultimately , several of Houston 's associates were cooperative with the Crane endeavor , but not everyone was inspired to join the effort . According to daughter Maggie , the author had told her that many valuable documents were destroyed by Margaret in a fit of anger when someone she considered a friend expressed disinterest . Life and Select Literary Remains of Sam Houston of Texas was rejected by the initial publisher , but was eventually published by J.B. Lippincott in 1884 . 
 After emancipation and Margaret 's death , " Aunt Eliza " , as the children called her , alternated her time between Nannie 's and Maggie 's households . When Eliza died in 1898 , at her request , she was buried next to Margaret . Nancy 's tomb fell to decay over the years , after which she was re @-@ interred in the ground with Margaret and Eliza . There was much discussion during the Texas 1936 centennial about moving Margaret 's remains next to Houston 's in Huntsville , but the family and various authorities never came to an agreement over it . Not until May 15 , 1965 was an historical marker erected in Independence to denote her contributions to Texas history .

 Theresa Andrews ( born August 25 , 1962 ) is an American former competition swimmer and Olympic champion . Raised in Maryland , Andrews gained prominence as a national collegiate champion who competed for the University of Florida . In international competition , she was a backstroke specialist who won two gold medals at the 1984 Summer Olympics . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Andrews was born in New London , Connecticut in 1962 . She grew up in Annapolis , Maryland , where she initially attended St. Mary 's High School . She was one of twelve children of Frank and Maxine Andrews ; her father was a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and a former U.S. Navy officer . Andrews first trained in the Navy Junior Program as an age @-@ group swimmer , and then moved to the North Baltimore Aquatic Club ( <unk> ) , attending Archbishop Keogh High School in Baltimore , Maryland and staying with a succession of five sponsoring local families during her final two years of high school . She later described her training regime as " six hours a day , six days a week ... training in a pool . " Andrews was among the first generation of elite swimmers to train under coach Murray Stephens at <unk> , a club that has produced a succession of Olympic swimmers after her , including Michael Phelps and Katie Hoff . She was the first Olympic medalist produced by the club .

 Andrews accepted an athletic scholarship to attend Indiana University in Bloomington , Indiana , and swam for the Indiana Hoosiers swimming and diving team in Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women ( AIAW ) and Big Ten Conference competition during the 1980 – 81 school year . As a Hoosier swimmer , she won six Big Ten titles , and earned five All @-@ American honors . 
 After her freshman season , Andrews transferred to the University of Florida in Gainesville , Florida , where she swam for coach Randy Reese 's Florida Gators swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) and Southeastern Conference ( SEC ) competition in 1982 and 1983 . As a Gator , she was an eleven @-@ time SEC champion , including the 50 @-@ yard backstroke ( twice ) , 100 @-@ yard backstroke ( twice ) , 200 @-@ yard backstroke , and six relays .

 = Mireya Moscoso = 
 Mireya Elisa Moscoso Rodríguez de Arias ( born July 1 , 1946 ) was Panama 's first female president , serving from 1999 to 2004 . 
 Born into a poor family , Moscoso became active in the 1968 presidential campaign of three @-@ time president Arnulfo Arias , following and marrying him when he went into exile after a military coup . After his death in 1988 , she assumed control of his coffee business and later his political party , the Arnulfista Party ( PA ) . During the 1994 general elections for the presidency , she narrowly lost to the Democratic Revolutionary Party ( PRD ) candidate Ernesto Pérez Balladares by 4 % of the vote . In the 1999 general election , she defeated the PRD candidate Martín Torrijos by 8 % to become Panama 's first female president . 
 During her tenure in office , she presided over the handover of the Panama Canal from the US to Panama and the economic downturn that resulted from the loss of US personnel . <unk> by new spending restrictions passed by the opposition @-@ controlled Legislative Assembly , and her administration 's corruption scandals , she had difficulty passing her legislative initiatives . Her popularity declined , and her party 's candidate José Miguel Alemán lost to the PRD 's Torrijos in the subsequent general elections to succeed her . 
 = = Background = = 
 Moscoso is the daughter of a schoolteacher and was born into a poor family in <unk> , Panama as the youngest of six children . She later worked as a secretary and joined the 1968 presidential campaign of Arnulfo Arias ; Arias had already served two partial terms as president , both times being deposed by the Panamanian military . He won the presidency but was again deposed by the military , this time after only nine days in office . 
 Arias went into exile in Miami , Florida in the US , and Moscoso followed , marrying him the subsequent year . She was 23 , and he was 67 . During this period , Moscoso studied interior design at Miami @-@ Dade Community College . After Arias ' 1988 death , she inherited his coffee business . On September 29 , 1991 , almost two years after the US invasion of Panama that overthrew Manuel Noriega , she became president of her former husband 's Arnulfista Party . 
 Also in 1991 , Moscoso married businessman Richard Gruber . The couple adopted a son , Richard ( born 1992 ) . Moscoso and Gruber divorced in 1997 . 
 = = Presidential campaigns = = 
 In 1994 , Moscoso ran as the presidential candidate of her deceased husband 's Arnulfista Party ( PA ) in the general election , seeking to succeed PA president Guillermo Endara . Her main rivals were Democratic Revolutionary Party ( PRD ) candidate Ernesto Pérez Balladares and salsa singer Rubén Blades , who was then president of the party Papa <unk> . Moscoso and Blades sought to emphasize Pérez Balladares ' connection with military ruler Manuel Noriega , broadcasting pictures of the two together , while Pérez Balladares worked to position himself as a successor to military ruler Omar Torrijos , who was regarded as a national hero . Moscoso 's campaign , meanwhile , was hindered by public dissatisfaction with the perceived incompetence and corruption of Endara 's government . Pérez Balladares ultimately won the election with 33 % of the vote , with Moscoso receiving 29 % and Blades receiving 17 % . 
 Moscoso was named the PA candidate again in the May 2 , 1999 general election . Her main opponent this time was Martín Torrijos , Omar Torrijos ' son , named to represent the PRD after the failure of a constitutional referendum that would have allowed Pérez Balladares to run for a second term . Torrijos was selected in part to try to win back left @-@ leaning voters after the privatizations and union restrictions instituted by Pérez Balladares . Moscoso ran on a populist platform , beginning many of her speeches with the Latin phrase " Vox populi , vox Dei " ( " the voice of the people is the voice of God " ) , previously used by Arias to begin his own speeches . She pledged to support education , reduce poverty , and slow the pace of privatization . While Torrijos ran in large part on his father 's memory — including using the campaign slogan " Omar lives " — Moscoso evoked that of her dead husband , leading Panamanians to joke that the election was a race between " two corpses " . Torrijos allies also criticized Moscoso for her lack of government experience or college degree . However , unlike in 1994 , it was now the PRD that was hampered by the scandals of the previous administration , and Moscoso defeated Torrijos with 45 % of the vote to 37 % . 
 = = Presidency = = 
 Moscoso took office on September 1 , 1999 . Because she was divorced when she assumed the presidency , her older sister Ruby Moscoso de Young served as her First Lady . 
 Facing a PRD @-@ controlled Legislative Assembly , Moscoso was limited in her ability to make new policy . She was also hampered by strict new restraints Pérez Balladares had passed on spending public money in the final days of his term , targeted specifically at her administration . 
 On December 31 , 1999 , Moscoso oversaw the handover of the Panama Canal from the US to Panama under the Torrijos @-@ Carter Treaties . Her government then faced the challenge of cleaning up environmental problems in the Canal Zone , where the US Army had long tested bombs , biological agents , and chemical weapons . Remaining issues included lead contamination , unexploded munitions , and stockpiles of depleted uranium . Though Moscoso fired all of Pérez Balladares ' appointments from the Panama Canal Authority and appointed supermarket magnate ( and future president ) Ricardo Martinelli as its head , the Authority retained its autonomy from her administration . At the same time , Panama 's economy began to struggle due to the loss of income from American canal personnel . 
 Moscoso worked to end Panama 's role in international crime , passing new laws against money laundering and supporting tax transparency . The legislation allowed Panama to be removed from international lists of tax havens . Meanwhile , violent crime rose sharply during Moscoso 's tenure . In September 2000 , under pressure from the US and some Latin American governments , Moscoso 's government gave temporary asylum to former Peruvian spy chief <unk> Montesinos , who had fled Peru after being videotaped bribing a member of its congress . 
 In December 2000 , human remains were discovered at a Panamanian National Guard base , incorrectly believed to be those of Jesús Héctor Gallego Herrera , a priest murdered during the Omar Torrijos dictatorship . Moscoso appointed a truth commission to investigate the site and those at other bases . The commission faced opposition from the PRD @-@ controlled National Assembly , who slashed its funding , and from PRD 's president Balbina Herrera , who threatened to seek legal action against the president for its creation . It ultimately reported on 110 of the 148 cases it examined , of which 40 had disappeared and 70 were known to be murdered . The report concluded that the Noriega government had engaged in " torture [ and ] cruel , inhuman , and degrading treatment " , and recommended further exhumation and investigation . 
 During her term , Moscoso was often accused of nepotism for her administrative appointments and faced several corruption scandals , such as the unexplained gift of US $ 146 @,@ 000 in watches to Legislative Assembly members . By 2001 , her second year in office , Moscoso 's approval rating had fallen to 23 % , due to corruption scandals and concern for the economy . That year , she attempted to pass a tax reform package through the Legislative Assembly , but the proposal was opposed by both the private sector and organized labor . In 2003 , the US ambassador publicly criticized Moscoso for the growth of corruption during her term . By the end of her term , her presidency was " criticized as rife with corruption and incompetence " and " widely regarded as weak and ineffectual " . 
 Herself barred by the Constitution of Panama from a second consecutive term , Moscoso was succeeded by her former rival Martín Torrijos in the 2004 election . Shortly before leaving office , Moscoso sparked controversy by pardoning four men — Luis Posada <unk> , Gaspar Jiménez , Pedro Remon , and Guillermo Novo <unk> — who had been convicted of plotting to assassinate Cuban president Fidel Castro during a 2000 visit to Panama . Cuba broke off diplomatic relations with the country , and Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez recalled the nation 's ambassador . Moscoso stated that the pardons had been motivated by her mistrust of Torrijos , saying , " I knew that if these men stayed here , they would be extradited to Cuba and Venezuela , and there they were surely going to kill them there . " Moscoso also issued pardons to 87 journalists for defamation convictions dating back as far as 14 years . On July 2 , 2008 , all of the 180 pardons Moscoso had issued were overturned as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court . 
 = = Post @-@ presidency = = 
 During the Torrijos presidency , Moscoso remained an active member of the opposition . In September 2007 , she criticized the appointment of PRD politician Pedro Miguel González , who was wanted in the US for the murder of US Army sergeant Zak Hernández , as the head of the National Assembly . In the same year , she joined Endara and Perez Balladares in lobbying the Organization of American States to investigate the Hugo Chavez government 's refusal to renew the broadcasting license of opposition station Radio Caracas Televisión Internacional in Venezuela . 
 Since leaving office , Moscoso has also served as a member of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars ' Council of Women World Leaders , a network intended " to promote good governance and enhance the experience of democracy globally by increasing the number , effectiveness , and visibility of women who lead at the highest levels in their countries .

 Biography by <unk> ( in Spanish ) 
 = Castaing machine = 
 The Castaing machine is a device used to add lettering and decoration to the edge of a coin . Such lettering was necessitated by counterfeiting and edge clipping , which was a common problem resulting from the uneven and irregular hammered coinage . When Aubin Olivier introduced milled coinage to France , he also developed a method of marking the edges with lettering which would make it possible to detect if metal had been shaved from the edge . This method involved using a collar , into which the metal flowed from the pressure of the press . This technique was slower and more costly than later methods . France abandoned milled coinage in favour of hammering in 1585 . 
 England experimented briefly with milled coinage , but it wasn 't until Peter Blondeau brought his method of minting coins there in the mid @-@ seventeenth century that such coinage began in earnest in that country . Blondeau also invented a different method of marking the edge , which was , according to him , faster and less costly than the method pioneered by Olivier . Though Blondeau 's exact method was secretive , numismatists have asserted that it likely resembled the later device invented by Jean Castaing . Castaing 's machine marked the edges by means of two steel rulers , which , when a coinage blank was forced between them , imprinted legends or designs on its edge . Castaing 's device found favour in France , and it was eventually adopted in other nations , including Britain and the United States , but it was eventually phased out by mechanised minting techniques . 
 = = Background = = 
 Prior to the introduction of milled coinage , hammered coinage , which resulted in a relatively crude product of irregular shape and size , predominated in European mints . In c . 1550 , an Augsburg goldsmith named Max Schwab created a new technique for striking coins , which included the use of rolling mills , presses to cut the coinage blanks and the coinage press . After learning about the invention via the French ambassador , King Henry II dispatched the Comptroller of Finance Guillaume de <unk> and François Guilhem , Master of the Mint in Lyon , to observe the machinery . Schwab 's press was turned with a weighted wooden handle , which exerted even pressure across the coinage blank , creating a sharper and more precise strike than hammering . De <unk> requested that Anne de Montmorency send him an engineer capable of creating a similar machine ; he sent the engineer Aubin Olivier . Olivier viewed the machine , and introduced his own version to France , to which he later added a segmented collar . This allowed for the expanding metal to fill the collar , creating reeding , designs or edge lettering at the same time as the obverse and reverse images were struck onto the coin . The segments of the collar were then removed , and the coin ejected . Such lettering was used to aid in detecting coins which were debased by clipping metal from their edges , a problem frequently encountered in hammered coinage . Olivier 's method of striking coins was considered costly relative to the previously utilised method , as the upper coinage die often came into contact with the collar on its downward descent , causing expensive damage . <unk> coinage was thus abandoned in 1585 in favour of hammering . 
 Eloy <unk> introduced milled coinage to England in 1561 , but their production ceased in 1575 . On 8 August 1649 , the Council of State and the House of Commons opted to summon Peter Blondeau , a Paris Mint engineer , to London to modernise operations at the Tower Mint . Mint officials opposed Blondeau 's techniques , and subjected him to a series of trials in which the quality of his product would be compared to that made by the Mint . According to a pamphlet published in Blondeau 's name , his process is described as " a new invention , to make a handsome <unk> ... that shall not only be stamped flat on both sides , but shall even be marked with letters on the thickness of the brim , " which was intended to prevent clipping . Blondeau described , in a proposition presumably meant for the Committee of the Mint , " two different ways to make the pieces marked about the <unk> or edge . One is <unk> , <unk> to severall men , and according whereunto David Ramage [ the man whom the Mint had selected to create hammered coinage in competition to Blondeau 's ] , <unk> of the Mint , hath made some <unk> pieces ; but that way is very tedious , <unk> much time , <unk> abondance of stamps and engines , and cannot be done upon the currant money , which is <unk> . " Blondeau was referring to the type of collar added to the Paris Mint 's early coinage presses by Olivier , which were time @-@ consuming to use and caused significant damage to coinage dies and engines . He went on to say " [ a ] s touching the new way , which is ready and expeditious , and can be based upon the <unk> and currant money , I am the inventor of it , and only I know <unk> , as I can make appeare by experiences , if it be the pleasure of the State to <unk> me . " Blondeau also argued that his methods would prevent counterfeiting , because the machinery required was too complex to be duplicated by criminals . 
 Following his swearing in as Lord Protector in 1653 , Oliver Cromwell became a proponent of Blondeau 's coinage method , which had yet to find favour in the nation 's minting establishment . In 1654 , Cromwell 's government placed Blondeau in charge of a planned mint in Ireland , where the coinage was heavily debased by fraudulent means . The proposed mint never came into existence , but in 1656 , Blondeau was given official appointment to strike £ 2 @,@ 000 worth of coins bearing Cromwell 's portrait with captured Spanish silver . The former Royal Mint superintendent , William John Hocking , believed that the edge lettering on Blondeau 's coinage was created by means of a perforated steel strip , through which the coin 's metal flowed during striking , creating the raised designs and wording . Hocking suggested that this technique would have been less costly than the older method involving the split collar , because the steel strip could be replaced more economically . However , the numismatist Peter B. Gaspar determined that Blondeau 's Cromwell @-@ era coinage was struck without a collar , which suggests that he used a machine to impart the edge lettering prior to striking . 
 Blondeau returned to France following Cromwell 's death , but he was summoned to return to London in 1661 following an order from King Charles II to modernise operations at the Mint . He received a contract from the Mint , which he fulfilled until his death in 1672 , to work as an engineer for tools , to instruct moneyers , and to conduct his edge lettering process . In his diary , the Member of Parliament Samuel Pepys remarked upon the secrecy maintained by Blondeau regarding this process , stating that coiners at the Mint " mark the letters on the edges , which is kept as the great secret by Blondeau . " 
 = = Invention = = 
 Though production of hammered coinage ceased in France in 1645 , edge lettering wasn 't immediately reintroduced to that nation 's milled coinage . At some point prior to 1679 , Jean Castaing , a French engineer , invented a machine to apply edge lettering to coins , and in 1685 , he approached the French government with a proposal to use his machine in that nation 's mints . King Louis XIV favoured the invention , but his financial minister , Jean @-@ Baptiste Colbert , believed that it would not be economically viable to pay the expenses required to put it into use . In 1686 , over Colbert 's objection , the French Council of State entered a contract with Castaing wherein all of the nation 's gold and silver coinage would include edge lettering created by his machine . 
 Two years later , in 1688 , in response to counterfeiting and to raise money to support the Nine Years ' War , Castaing proposed a method of reshaping and restriking existing coins , which was ultimately accepted . Castaing 's edge lettering machine was used on the overstruck coins , and the Royal Mint supervisor Martin <unk> , the individual who undertook the process , was obligated to pay Castaing for its use . In 1691 , <unk> was dismissed , as he and his clerks were found to have stolen from the Mint during the reformation of the coinage , and Castaing was appointed to perform the edge lettering and restriking in his place . A second reform took place in 1693 . Castaing was imprisoned in 1700 on charges of using inaccurate scales to weigh the coins to be <unk> ; according to his wife , Marie Hippolyte Castaing ( née Bosch ) , the allegations were false , originating from opponents who lost money as a result of his machine 's introduction to the French Mint and the resulting monetary reforms . 
 According to the engineer and numismatist George E. Ewing , Jr . , Castaing 's machine was likely similar to that used by Blondeau in England , but " Castaing 's improvements made his machine worthy of being called an invention . " 
 = = = Operation = = = 
 An 1819 account described the operation of Castaing 's machine : 
 The machine used for this purpose consists of two plates of steel in form of rulers , on which the edging is engraved , half on the one , and half on the other . One of these plates is immovable , being strongly bound with screws to a copper plate on a board or table ; the other is movable , and slides on the copper plate by means of a handle , and a wheel , or pinion , of iron , the teeth of which catch in other teeth , on the surface of the sliding plate . The planchet , being placed horizontally between these two plates , is carried along by the motion of the movable one ; so as by the time that it had made half a turn , it is found marked all round . 
 According to a 1765 Encyclopédie entry , Castaing 's machine was capable of applying the edge lettering to 20 @,@ 000 coins daily . 
 The machine came into use at various mints throughout the world as a way to improve upon the existing machinery used for edge lettering . A copy of Castaing 's machine was put into use at the British Royal Mint , and in 1792 , the director of the newly established United States Mint in Philadelphia , David Rittenhouse , ordered three coinage presses from England to which he added a modified version of the machine . This became obsolete following Franklin Peale 's introduction of steam @-@ powered equipment to the Mint in 1836 . Castaing 's machine was replaced at the Paris Mint in 1803 , when one of the Mint 's engineers , Philippe <unk> , created his own version .

 = Cerro Maravilla murders = 
 The Cerro Maravilla murders , also known as the Cerro Maravilla massacre , is the name given by the Puerto Rican public and media to describe the events that occurred on July 25 , 1978 , at Cerro Maravilla , a mountain in Puerto Rico , wherein two young Puerto Rican pro @-@ independence activists were murdered in a Puerto Rico Police ambush . The event sparked a series of political controversies where , in the end , the police officers were found guilty of murder and several high @-@ ranking local government officials were accused of planning and / or covering up the incident . 
 Originally declared a police intervention against terrorists , the local media quickly questioned the officers ' testimonies as well as the only surviving witness for inconsistencies . Although reluctant , Carlos Romero Barceló ( PNP ) , then Governor of Puerto Rico , ordered the local Justice Department to launch various investigations , and asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) and the US Justice Department to aid in the investigations , which concluded that there was no wrongdoing on the officers ' part . However , after the local opposing political party launched its own inquiries , new evidence and witness testimonies surfaced which uncovered gross negligence and murder on the officers ' part , as well as the possibility of a local and federal cover @-@ up . Trials were held and a total of 10 officers were convicted of various crimes . 
 The incident and subsequent events have become one of the most controversial events in Puerto Rico 's political history , frequently called " the worst political cover @-@ up in the history of the island . " The event is often used by Puerto Rican independence activists as an example of political oppression against the independence movement . Joy James commented that " the Cerro Maravilla massacre demonstrated the reason why colonialism was banned in the world . "

 Carlos Enrique Soto Arriví was born on December 8 , 1959 , in San Juan . His parents were Pedro Juan Soto ( one of the most admired Puerto Rican novelists in the 20th century ) and Rosa Arriví . He had an older brother ( Roberto Alfonso ) and a younger brother ( Juan Manuel ) . 
 As a student he enjoyed literature . He also wrote stories and went on to win second place in a competition held by the Puerto Rico Department of Education . When his parents went to Europe to finish their doctoral studies , he learned to speak French in a year . Upon returning from Europe , he enrolled at the Escuela Superior República de Colombia , a high school in Río Piedras , although in a lower grade , because the school officials did not want to credit his years of overseas study . Although Soto Arriví was interested in social issues from a very young age , his political activism started when he joined a pro @-@ independence group in high school . 
 Arnaldo Darío Rosado Torres was born on November 23 , 1953 , in Old San Juan . His parents were Pablo Rosado and Juana Torres <unk> . Rosado finished his high school studies and went to work at a cracker factory . Dario Rosado was married to Angela Rivera , and had a son called Manuel <unk> Rosado Rivera . 
 From a very young age , Rosado identified with the cause of Puerto Rico 's independence . He joined the socialist league with which he participated in several activities . Rosado was an autodidact and an avid reader of various kinds of literature , especially those related to the political processes of Puerto Rico and Latin America . He also wrote poems , essays , and had several pen @-@ pals throughout Latin America . 
 = = The incident = = 
 On the night of July 25 , 1978 Carlos Soto Arriví and Arnaldo Darío Rosado , two independence activists of the Armed Revolutionary Movement ( Spanish : Movimiento Revolucionario Armado ) , along with undercover police officer Alejandro González Malavé posing as a fellow group member , took taxi driver Julio Ortiz Molina hostage and ordered him to drive them to Cerro Maravilla where several communication towers were located . Their original plan was to set fire and sabotage the towers to protest the imprisonment of Puerto Rican nationalists convicted of the 1950 assassination attempt on U.S. President Harry S. Truman and the 1954 shooting at the United States Capitol where five members of Congress were injured . State police officers were alerted of their plan prior to their arrival and the activists were ambushed and shot . The undercover agent received a minor bullet wound during the shooting , while the taxi driver was left relatively unharmed . 
 = = = Initial statements = = = 
 The morning after the shootings , the officers argued that they acted in self defense , stating that they ordered the activists to surrender , at which time the activists started shooting at them and they returned fire . Initially , the taxi driver said he was under the dashboard of his cab when the shooting started and could not see who shot first , although he contradicted his statement a few days later in an interview with the San Juan Star , a local newspaper , stating that he ducked under the dashboard of the car after the three men ( the two activists and the undercover agent ) left the car , and that he saw " 10 heavily armed men " approaching . When he emerged from the car , he saw the three men alive and two of them were being beaten by the armed men , who were later identified as policemen . Then @-@ Governor of Puerto Rico Carlos Romero Barceló ( PNP ) praised the officers in a televised address by calling them “ heroic ” , stating that they acted in self @-@ defense and stopped a terrorist attack . 
 Two days later , in a follow @-@ up interview by <unk> @-@ TV news reporter Enrique Cruz , the taxi driver stated that when the first shooting occurred , he heard one of his three passengers shout " I 'm an agent ! Don 't shoot me , I 'm an agent ! " while the others called for help and shouted " I give up ! I give up ! " . He saw " 10 heavily armed men " approaching , later identified as police agents , when the three passengers exited the car , and the taxi driver was ordered at gunpoint to exit the vehicle . He was extracted by an agent , kicked , and taken away from the scene . While being escorted , he saw the two activists directly in front of his vehicle being beaten by the armed men . 
 = = = The first investigations = = = 
 Facing public pressure due to the taxi driver 's conflicting statements , Governor Barceló ordered two separate investigations by the P.R. Justice Department in addition to the ongoing standard Police investigation , all of which concluded that the officers ' actions were free of any wrongdoing , despite various inconsistencies in their stories . P.R. District Attorney Pedro Colton informed reporters on July 29 , four days after the incident , that the P.R. Justice Department 's investigation revealed " no massacre , no beatings , and no aggressions , except for the shootings that occurred in Cerro Maravilla . " Opposing political parties , mainly the Popular Democratic Party ( PDP ) , insisted that the investigations were just cover @-@ ups and demanded that a special independent prosecutor be assigned to investigate . Two special investigations by the U.S. Justice Department 's Civil Rights Division and by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) were performed on separate occasions between 1978 and 1980 , which confirmed the conclusions of the P.R. Justice Department that the officers acted in self @-@ defense . 
 = = = The second investigations = = = 
 In the November 1980 general elections , Governor Romero Barceló was re @-@ elected by a margin of 3 @,@ 503 votes ( one of the closest in Puerto Rico history ) , though his party lost control of the state legislature to the main opposition party , the PPD . This loss was attributed by the New York Times to the surrounding controversy regarding the investigations at the time . Other news organizations , such as Time , attributed the loss to Gov. Romero <unk> 's stance on the island 's political status . The Legislature quickly started new inquiries and hearings into the Cerro Maravilla incident . The Senate , then presided by Miguel Hernández Agosto , spearheaded the investigations by naming former Assistant District Attorney Hector Rivera Cruz to investigate . 
 The second investigations performed between 1981 and 1984 by the legislature , the U.S. Justice Department , and the local press uncovered a plot to assassinate the activists and a possible , though not conclusive , conspiracy to cover @-@ up these actions . During interviews of the Senate Investigations Committee in 1983 , officer Miguel Cartagena Flores , a detective in the Intelligence Division of the Puerto Rico Police Department , testified : “ When I arrived at the scene I saw 4 police officers aiming their guns at the two activists who were kneeling before them . I turned my eyes away and heard 5 gunshots . " Cartagena , who was offered immunity for his testimony , added that several hours before the shooting , he and other officers were told by Col. Angel Perez Casillas , commander of the Intelligence Division , that “ these terrorists should not come down ( from the mountain ) alive . ” His testimony was corroborated by officer Carmelo Cruz who , although he did not witness the fatal shooting , confirmed many details provided by Cartagena when also granted immunity . 
 Other inquiries obtained similar testimony from witnesses , including the taxi driver who now stated that the activists were “ alive and disarmed ” when the police removed him from the scene . The taxi driver stated that there was a short exchange of gunfire , and when he was removed to another place nearby he heard a second volley of gunfire , but was asked by the police and investigators of the PR Justice Department to forget about the second round of shots . The statement regarding two different volleys of shots was upheld by various people , including ex @-@ officer Jesus Quiñones before a Federal grand jury ( he quit the force shortly after the shootings ) , and three other civilian witnesses in a San Juan Star interview . 
 Subsequently , the legislature and local press started questioning the actions of the Puerto Rico Police , the Puerto Rico Justice Department , the U.S. Justice Department , and the FBI actions during the first investigation , alleging corruption within the agencies and a conspiracy to cover @-@ up evidence . Letters were sent by various community and political leaders to then Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Senator Edward M. Kennedy , asking for an inquiry into the conduct of the Federal investigations . Several letters even accused former US Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti of providing aid to Gov. Romero Barceló during the investigations . Two leaders from the opposing parties , the Popular Democratic Party and the Puerto Rican Independence Party , charged that after a December 1979 meeting between the two , the Governor , then considered as a lifelong Republican , began campaigning to deliver the 41 Democratic Party convention votes of the island for President Jimmy Carter 's ( D ) nomination for the presidency ( ironically , Carter ’ s opponent for the nomination was Senator Kennedy ) . Almost 45 days after President Carter won the nomination by only one delegate , the U.S. Justice Department announced that due to lack of evidence it was bringing its investigation of the case to an end . A Justice Department internal memorandum that was issued the same month of Romero Barceló ’ s and Civiletti ’ s meeting later proved that the investigations were closed even when agents were still investigating important evidence of the case that could potentially incriminate the officers , including “ several unexplained contusions ” on a victim 's face and the fact that one of the police officers recanted his original story , stating that there was in fact “ two bursts of firing ” . 
 These and several other accusations brought public and political pressure to the investigating agencies . This led to internal revisions of evidence and procedures from the first investigations both at the local and federal level , though all organizations still adamantly denied any cover @-@ up . These second investigations led to reassignments , demotions and resignations among top officials within the PR Justice Department , including three different P.R. Secretaries of Justice ( equivalent to State Attorney General ) accepting and resigning their posts in a span of six months . On November 29 , 1983 , three prosecutors were relieved of their duties after a report by the state Senate Investigations Committee found they had failed to properly investigate the Cerro Maravilla shootings , citing 101 specific deficiencies in two investigations . This was the third state Attorney General to oversee the investigations since the shootings occurred in 1978 . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The second investigations led to ten officers being indicted and found guilty of perjury , destruction of evidence , and obstruction of justice , four of which were convicted of second @-@ degree murder in 1984 . The convicted officers , who were no longer on active duty , and their status with the Puerto Rico Police were : 
 Col. Ángel Pérez Casillas ( head of the Puerto Rico Police Department Intelligence Division during the incident ; suspended ) 
 Lieut . Nelson González Pérez ( resigned ) 
 Lieut . Jaime <unk> Hernández ( suspended ) 
 Officer Juan Bruno González ( suspended ) 
 Officer William Colón <unk> ( suspended ) 
 Officer Nazario Mateo Espada ( suspended ) 
 Officer Rafael Moreno Morales ( suspended ) 
 Officer Luis <unk> Martínez ( on disability leave ) 
 Officer Jose Ríos Polanco ( suspended ) 
 Officer Rafael Torres Marrero ( on disability leave ) 
 That same year , in the general elections held in November , Romero Barceló lost his gubernatorial seat against former governor and opposing party rival Rafael Hernández Colón ( PPD ) . It is widely accepted that Romero Barceló lost the elections because of this case , since his public opinion rating had deteriorated substantially during late 1984 as the investigations progressed , and since his political rivals used his defense of the officers as an indication of a possible conspiracy . 
 = = = Undercover agent murdered = = = 
 Alejandro Gonzalez Malavé , the undercover agent who was accompanying the activists , was not indicted for his part in the slayings because he was granted immunity for testifying against other officers , but was removed from the police force due to public pressure . In February 1986 , he was acquitted of kidnapping the taxi driver . His lawyer had argued that he was acting under orders and , therefore , it was the government who was actually guilty of kidnapping . This , despite the testimony presented by officer Carmelo Cruz who had testified that it was Gonzalez who recklessly endangered the hostage 's life . The prosecution had provided evidence that he threatened the hostage at gunpoint , drove the car , and , when the car approached the mountaintop , refused to free the hostage despite suggestions from the activists . These actions , according to officer Cruz , were contrary to standard police procedures since his primary concern should have been the safety of the hostage . Nevertheless , the Puerto Rico Police Department did not reinstate Gonzalez as an active police officer , a fact that he publicly expressed resentment over , and subsequently threatened to provide incriminating evidence to the media about other individuals involved in the shootings unless reinstated . 
 On the evening of April 29 , 1986 , just two months after his acquittal , Gonzalez was assassinated in front of his mother 's house in Bayamón . He sustained three gunshot wounds and his mother was slightly injured . A few hours later , a group identifying itself as the “ Volunteer Organization for the Revolution ” called local news agencies claiming responsibility . In their statements they swore to kill , " one by one , " all the policemen involved in the deaths in Cerro Maravilla . The FBI considered it one of the most dangerous terrorist organizations in the United States at the time , given that it was the same organization that claimed responsibility for an attack on a Navy bus in Puerto Rico on December 3 , 1979 , in which two Navy men were killed and 10 people injured , and the attack on a U.S. National Guard base on January 12 , 1981 , in which six fighter @-@ jet planes were destroyed . To this day , no one has been identified as a possible suspect in Gonzalez 's murder , and the case remains unsolved .

 In 1992 , former US Justice Department Civil Rights Division chief Drew S. Days III admitted before the P.R. Senate that the U.S. Justice Department and the FBI acted negligently during the 1978 – 1980 investigations of the Cerro Maravilla incident , such as rejecting interviews with key witnesses ( including the taxi driver ) , refusing to offer immunity to certain witnesses , and avoiding various standard investigating tasks . Days stated : " I think that certainly an apology is justified with respect to the way the federal government handled its investigation : the FBI , the Justice Department , and my division . . . it was not done in the professional way that it should have been done . " FBI Director William S. Sessions had made similar concessions in a written statement in 1990 , stating : “ In hindsight , the eyewitness should have been interviewed and a civil rights investigation initiated ” . In 1984 , the FBI conducted an internal review of its Cerro Maravilla Case files , and concluded that there was no cover @-@ up effort inside the FBI , only a desire to avoid derailing " the cooperative anti @-@ terrorism effort " with the Puerto Rican police . Their statements were accompanied with promises to improve their agencies to avoid similar incidents in the future . 
 In 2003 , 25 years after the incident , former Gov. Romero Barceló admitted in a public radio interview that it was “ an error of judgment ” and “ a premature declaration ” to laud the police officers , since at that time he believed they were telling the truth about their self @-@ defense . However , he has publicly denied any wrongdoing regarding the alleged cover @-@ up during the first investigations .

 Since the conclusion of the final investigations , there has been heated debate about the Cerro Maravilla incident in Puerto Rico , with some groups arguing that there are still others responsible for planning and / or ordering the plot to kill the activists as well as the subsequent cover @-@ up , while others have argued that the incident was exaggerated by rival politicians and the media , maintaining that no conspiracy ever took place and that some of the officers incarcerated , though not all , are actually innocent . 
 Every year on July 25 , Puerto Rican Nationalists and independence activists gather atop Cerro Maravilla to honor Carlos Soto and Arnaldo Dario , as well as to defend and celebrate the Puerto Rican independence ideology . It is usually organized by the family of the victims , former members of nationalist groups , and by the Puerto Rican Independence Party ( PIP ) . The mountain has also been christened by them as “ El Cerro de los <unk> ” ( The Mountain of the Martyrs ) . 
 The American movie A Show of Force is loosely based on the events and theories behind the incident . 
 = Jordan River ( Utah ) = 
 The Jordan River , in the state of Utah , United States , is a river about 51 miles ( 82 km ) long . Regulated by pumps at its headwaters at Utah Lake , it flows northward through the Salt Lake Valley and empties into the Great Salt Lake . Four of Utah 's six largest cities — Salt Lake City , West Valley City , West Jordan and Sandy — border the river . More than a million people live in the Jordan Subbasin , which is the part of the Jordan River watershed that lies within Salt Lake and Utah counties . During the Pleistocene , the area was part of Lake Bonneville . 
 Members of the Desert Archaic Culture were the earliest known inhabitants of the region ; an archaeological site found along the river dates back 3 @,@ 000 years . Mormon pioneers led by Brigham Young were the first European American settlers , arriving in July 1847 and establishing farms and settlements along the river and its tributaries . The growing population , needing water for drinking , irrigation , and industrial use in an arid climate , dug ditches and canals , built dams , and installed pumps to create a highly regulated river . 
 Although the Jordan was originally a cold @-@ water fishery with 13 native species including Bonneville cutthroat trout , it has become a warm @-@ water fishery where the common carp is most abundant . It was heavily polluted for many years by raw sewage , agricultural runoff , and mining wastes . In the 1960s , sewage treatment removed many pollutants . In the 21st century , pollution is further limited by the Clean Water Act , and , in some cases , the Superfund program . Once the home of bighorn sheep and beaver , the contemporary river is frequented by raccoons , red foxes , and domestic pets . It serves as an important avian resource , as does the Great Salt Lake and Utah Lake , visited by more than 200 bird species . 
 Big Cottonwood , Little Cottonwood , Red Butte , Mill , Parley 's , and City creeks , as well as smaller streams like Willow Creek at Draper , Utah , flow through the subbasin . The Jordan River Parkway along the river includes natural areas , botanical gardens , golf courses and a proposed 40 @-@ mile ( 64 km ) bicycle and pedestrian trail , much of which has been completed .

 The Jordan River is the Utah Lake 's only outflow , and originates at the northern end of the lake between the cities of Lehi and Saratoga Springs . It then meanders north through the north end of Utah Valley for approximately 8 miles ( 13 km ) until it passes through a gorge in the Traverse Mountains , known as the Jordan Narrows . The Utah National Guard base at Camp Williams lies on the western side of the river through much of the Jordan Narrows . The Turner Dam , located 41 @.@ 8 miles ( 67 @.@ 3 km ) from the river 's mouth ( or at river mile 41 @.@ 8 ) and within the boundaries of the Jordan Narrows , is the first of two dams of the Jordan River . The Turner dam diverts water to the right or easterly into the East Jordan Canal and to the left or westerly toward the Utah and Salt Lake Canal . Two pumping stations , situated next to the Turner Dam , divert water to the west into the Provo Reservoir Canal , Utah Lake Distribution Canal and Jacob @-@ Welby Canal . The Provo Reservoir Canal runs north through Salt Lake County , Jacob @-@ Welby runs south through Utah County and the Utah Lake Distribution Canal runs both north and south eventually leading back into Utah Lake . Outside the narrows , the river reaches the second dam , known as the Joint Dam , which is 39 @.@ 9 miles ( 64 @.@ 2 km ) from the river 's mouth . The Joint Dam diverts water to the east for the Jordan and Salt Lake City Canal and to the west for the South Jordan Canal . 
 The river then flows through the middle of the Salt Lake Valley , initially moving through the city of Bluffdale and then forming the border between the cities of Riverton and Draper . The river then enters the city of South Jordan where it merges with Midas Creek from the west . Upon leaving South Jordan , the river forms the border between the cities of West Jordan on the west and Sandy and Midvale on the east . From the west , Bingham Creek enters in West Jordan . Dry Creek , an eastern tributary , combines with the main river in Sandy . The river then forms the border between the cities of Taylorsville and West Valley City on the west and Murray and South Salt Lake on the east . The river flows underneath Interstate 215 in Murray . Little and Big Cottonwood Creeks enter from the east in Murray , 21 @.@ 7 miles ( 34 @.@ 9 km ) and 20 @.@ 6 miles ( 33 @.@ 2 km ) from the mouth respectively . Mill Creek enters on the east in South Salt Lake , 17 @.@ 3 miles ( 27 @.@ 8 km ) from the mouth . The river runs through the middle of Salt Lake City , where the river travels underneath Interstate 80 a mile west of downtown of Salt Lake City and again underneath Interstate 215 in the northern portion of Salt Lake City . Interstate 15 parallels the river 's eastern flank throughout Salt Lake County . At 16 miles ( 26 km ) from the mouth , the river enters into the Surplus Canal channel . The Jordan River physically diverts from the Surplus Canal through four gates and heads north with the Surplus Canal heading north @-@ west . Parley 's , Emigration , Red Butte Creeks converge from the east through an underground pipe , 14 @.@ 2 miles ( 22 @.@ 9 km ) from the mouth . City Creek also enters via an underground pipe , 11 @.@ 5 miles ( 18 @.@ 5 km ) from the river 's mouth . The length of the river and the elevation of its mouth varies year to year depending on the fluctuations of the Great Salt Lake caused by weather conditions . The lake has an average elevation of 4 @,@ 200 feet ( 1 @,@ 300 m ) which can deviate by 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) . The Jordan River then continues for 9 to 12 miles ( 14 to 19 km ) with Salt Lake County on the west and North Salt Lake and Davis County on the east until it empties into the Great Salt Lake .

The Oquirrh Mountains rise on the west , with a high point of over 9 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 700 m ) above sea level at Farnsworth Peak . The low point of 4 @,@ 200 feet ( 1 @,@ 300 m ) is at the river 's mouth , where the river enters the Great Salt Lake . Both the Oquirrh and Wasatch Mountains are fault @-@ block mountains created from normal @-@ slip faults where the mountains rise at the fault and the valley floor drops . The Wasatch Fault runs along the western edge of the Wasatch Mountains and the Oquirrh Fault runs along the eastern edge of the Oquirrh Mountains . 
 From approximately 75 @,@ 000 to 8 @,@ 000 years ago , much of what is now northern Utah was covered by a Pleistocene lake called Lake Bonneville . At its greatest extent , Lake Bonneville reached an elevation of 5 @,@ 200 feet ( 1 @,@ 600 m ) above sea level and had a surface area of 19 @,@ 800 square miles ( 51 @,@ 000 km2 ) . The lake left behind lacustrine sediments , which resulted in a relatively flat lake bed , and the valley floors seen today . As the region experienced increasingly warmer and drier climate over time , Lake Bonneville 's water levels receded , leaving the Great Salt Lake and Utah Lake as remnants . The river 's greatest slope , 27 feet per mile ( 5 @.@ 1 m / km ) , is in the Jordan Narrows , while the rest of the river has a more gentle slope of 2 to 4 feet per mile ( 0 @.@ 4 to 0 @.@ 8 m / km ) . 
 Approximately 237 @,@ 000 acres ( 960 km2 ) ( 46 percent of land area ) of the Jordan Subbasin is in the Wasatch , Oquirrh and Traverse mountains . The United States Forest Service manages 91 @,@ 000 acres ( 370 km2 ) of land in the Wasatch Range . The vast majority of the Oquirrh Range is privately held , with Kennecott Copper Mine owning most of the land . The State of Utah has scattered land holdings of 9 @,@ 800 acres ( 40 km2 ) throughout the subbasin and owns the beds of all navigable streams and lakes . 
 The Jordan Subbasin has two distinct climate zones . The lower elevations are characterized as a cold , semi @-@ arid climate , with four distinct seasons . Both summer and winter are long with hot , dry summers and cold , snowy winters . Salt Lake City receives 61 inches ( 150 cm ) of snow annually , part of a total of 16 @.@ 5 inches ( 420 mm ) of precipitation per year . The mean maximum temperature is 91 ° F ( 33 ° C ) in July and 37 ° F ( 3 ° C ) in January Areas of higher elevation have two distinct seasons , summer and winter . One of the areas of highest elevation , Alta , Utah , receives 544 inches ( 1 @,@ 380 cm ) of snow annually , part of a total of 52 inches ( 1 @,@ 300 mm ) of precipitation per year . The mean maximum temperature is 71 ° F ( 22 ° C ) in July and 29 ° F ( − 2 ° C ) in January . 
 = = History = = 
 The first known inhabitants of the banks of the Jordan River were members of the Desert Archaic Culture , a group of nomadic hunter @-@ gatherers . A 3 @,@ 000 @-@ year @-@ old archaeological site , called the Soo <unk> Village , was uncovered next to the Jordan River and over 30 @,@ 000 artifacts have been excavated . The next recorded inhabitants , between 400 A.D. to around 1350 A.D. , were the Fremont people , composed of several scattered bands of hunters and farmers living in what is now southern Idaho , western Nevada and most of Utah . The disappearance of the Fremont people has been attributed to both changing climatic conditions , which put an end to favorable weather for farming , and to the arrival of ancestors to the present @-@ day Ute , Paiute , and Northwestern Shoshone . Although there were no permanent Native American settlements when European settlers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley , the area bordered land occupied by several tribes , such as the <unk> band of the Utes in Utah Valley , the Goshutes on the western side of the Oquirrh Mountain Range and the Northwestern Shoshone north of the Salt Lake Valley . 
 In 1776 , Franciscan missionary Silvestre Vélez de Escalante was trying to find a land route from Santa Fe , New Mexico , to Monterey , California . His party included twelve Spanish colonials and two Utes from the Utah Valley <unk> band who acted as guides . On 23 September 1776 , the party entered Utah Valley at the present @-@ day city of Spanish Fork . The local <unk> villagers hosted them and told them of the lake to the north . In his journal , Escalante described Utah Lake as a " lake , which must be six leagues wide and fifteen leagues long , [ and ] extends as far as one of these valleys . It runs northwest through a narrow passage , and according to what they told us , it communicates with others much larger . " The Great Salt Lake was described as the " other lake with which this one communicates , according to what they told us , [ and ] covers many leagues , and its waters are noxious and extremely salty . " 
 The next group of Europeans to see the Jordan River was the party of Étienne Provost , a French Canadian trapper . In October 1824 , Provost 's party was lured into a Shoshone camp somewhere along the Jordan River , where they were attacked in retaliation for the murder of a local chief . In truth , the murder was committed by a member of Peter Skene Ogden 's party . The men were caught off guard , and fifteen perished , but Provost and two others escaped . The river was historically named <unk> 's Fork , as the Quebec @-@ born fur trapper was known as <unk> and <unk> , in addition to Provost ( and the pronunciation was " Provo " ) . 
 On 22 July 1847 , the first party of Mormon pioneers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley , and five days later another party led by Brigham Young crossed the Jordan River and bathed in the Great Salt Lake . The River Jordan ( located in the Middle East ) drains the Sea of Galilee into the Dead Sea in a way which the settlers found remarkably similar to the way the as @-@ yet @-@ unnamed local river drained Utah Lake into the saline Great Salt Lake . This similarity influenced the eventual name of the river , and on 22 August 1847 , a conference was held and the name Western Jordan River was decided upon , although it was later shortened to the Jordan River . By 1850 , settlements were established along the Jordan River , Big Cottonwood Creek , Little Cottonwood Creek , Mill Creek , Parley 's Creek and Emigration Creek . In 1850 , Captain Howard Stansbury of the United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers traveled the entire length of the Jordan River , surveying and making observations of the wildlife . 
 Around the year 1887 at Bingham Canyon in the Oquirrh Mountains , low @-@ grade copper deposits were discovered and mining claims were filed . Bingham Canyon is a porphyry copper deposit where magma containing copper , molybdenum , gold and other minerals slowly moved its way to the surface and cooled into rock . By 1890 , underground copper mining had started , and in 1907 , Kennecott Copper Mine started open pit mining . In the early 20th century , mills were established near the Jordan River in Midvale and West Jordan to process ore . As of 2010 , Kennecott Copper Mine 's open pit is 2 @.@ 8 miles ( 4 @.@ 5 km ) wide and 0 @.@ 8 miles ( 1 @.@ 3 km ) deep . 
 Throughout the 19th century and up to the 1940s , water from the Jordan River watershed sustained the agrarian society of the Salt Lake Valley . In 1950 , Salt Lake County had 489 @,@ 000 acres ( 198 @,@ 000 ha ) devoted to farming . By 1992 , however , the rapid urbanization of the Salt Lake Valley had reduced the amount of land devoted to farming to 108 @,@ 000 acres ( 44 @,@ 000 ha ) , which was further reduced to 82 @,@ 267 acres ( 33 @,@ 292 ha ) by 2002 . 
 = = = River modifications = = = 
 Alterations of the Jordan River watershed began two days after the Mormon Pioneers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley when water was diverted from City Creek for irrigation . The earliest dam and ditch along the Jordan River was constructed in 1849 to irrigate land on the west side of the river near present @-@ day Taylorsville . Other ditches include one built by Archibald Gardner , one of the founders of West Jordan in 1850 , to provide water for his mill and one built by Alexander Beckstead , a founder of South Jordan , who built the Beckstead Ditch in 1859 to provide water for farmland . Many other small dams and ditches were also constructed in the first 25 years , several of which are still used as of 2010 . All of these ditches irrigated only small amounts of land in the Jordan River floodplain ; the largest , the Beckstead Ditch , irrigated 580 acres ( 230 ha ) . 
 By the late 1860s , it became apparent that new , larger canals needed to be built if more acreage was to be farmed . The first dam in the Jordan Narrows was constructed in 1872 and raised in 1880 , sparking an outcry from residents living near Utah Lake who thought the dam was responsible for raising the level of the lake . After several years of dispute , a commission was established to determine an acceptable compromise for the elevation of Utah Lake . The commission 's 1885 decision stated that if the lake level were to rise above the established compromise level , the Jordan River could not be impeded by either dams or flood gates . Additionally , the commission stated that after water pumps were installed at the source of the river , the pumps should all be working if the lake were to rise above the compromise level . However , if the lake level fell below the compromise level , pumps could be turned off so that water could be held for storage in Utah Lake . 
 In 1875 , the first large canal , the South Jordan Canal , was completed and it brought water to the area above the bluffs of the Jordan River for the first time . All told , five large canals that originated from the dams in the Jordan Narrows were completed by 1883 . A second dam was built in 1890 a few miles downstream from the first dam and was constructed to better regulate the flow of two canals . Both dams have been rebuilt in subsequent years and operate as diversion points for canals rather than impounding water by the use of sluice gates and head gates . The drought of 1901 – 1902 caused the Jordan River , on occasion , to stop flowing , and in response to the drought a pumping plant was installed at the outlet from Utah Lake . It was the largest pumping plant in the United States at the time , and contained seven pumps with a total capacity of 700 cubic feet ( 20 m3 ) per second . Twice , during the droughts of 1934 and 1992 , Utah Lake levels dropped so low that the pumps were rendered useless and the Jordan River actually ran dry . In the 1950s , due to flood control measures to increase river velocity , large sections of the river were straightened in Salt Lake County . As part of the straightening process , meanders or curves in the river were cut off and the channel slope was increased . The river was also shifted to opposite sides of the flood plain in Midvale and Murray as part of local smelter operations . 
 Floods in 1983 – 1984 caused Utah Lake to overflow its banks , flooding homes and farmland in Provo , Lehi and present @-@ day Saratoga Springs . Dikes had to be constructed around Interstate 15 in Provo to prevent Utah Lake flooding the freeway . Big Cottonwood , Parley 's , Emigration and City creeks flowed down sand @-@ bag lined streets in order to manage the overflowing streams . Additional dikes were built at the Great Salt Lake to protect railroad lines and Interstate 80 . As a result of the flooding , the Utah Lake compromise level was amended to 4 @,@ 489 feet ( 1 @,@ 368 m ) . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 = = = Invertebrates and fish = = = 
 In the Jordan River , invertebrates play an important role as a source of food for fish and other aquatic life , and they function as a parameter by which to measure water quality and the health of the river . There are 34 different groups of invertebrates found in the Jordan River , most commonly of the class <unk> ( which includes earthworms ) , mosquito larvae and caddisfly larvae . The state of Utah maintains a Sensitive Species List that includes " those species for which there is credible scientific evidence to substantiate a threat to continued population viability . " The <unk> <unk> and the western <unk> mussel , both native to the Jordan River watershed , are found on this list . A 2007 survey of invertebrates and their response to pollution stated that the Jordan River was substantially to severely impaired with organic pollution and that it contained reduced levels of dissolved oxygen . 
 Historically , the Jordan River was a cold @-@ water fishery that contained 13 native species , including the Bonneville cutthroat trout , Utah Lake sculpin , June sucker , <unk> sculpin , Utah chub and the Utah Sucker . Today , the Jordan River is a warm @-@ water fishery with the Utah Sucker and the endangered June Sucker present only in Utah Lake . The Utah chub , however , is still found in the Jordan River . The most common species of fish encountered today is the common carp , which was introduced into the Jordan River and Utah Lake as a source of food after overfishing caused the depletion of native species stocks . The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources regularly stocks the river with catfish and rainbow trout . 
 = = = Wildlife = = = 
 Before the area was urbanized , mammals such as bighorn sheep , mule deer , coyote , wolves , beaver , muskrat and jack rabbits would have been seen along the river . A " <unk> hunt " was organized by John D. Lee around 1848 , after the arrival of Mormon settlers . The final count of the hunt included " two bears , two wolverines , two wildcats , 783 wolves , 409 foxes , 31 minks , nine eagles , 530 magpies , hawks and owls , and 1 @,@ 026 ravens . " None of the original large mammals is found along the Jordan River today ; they have , for the most part , been replaced by raccoons , red foxes and domestic pets . Animals from the Jordan River area found on the Utah Sensitive Species List include the smooth green snake , the western toad , kit fox , spotted bat , and Townsend 's big @-@ eared bat . 
 Combined with Utah Lake and the Great Salt Lake , the Jordan River offers one of the region 's richest bird resources . Over 200 bird species use the river for breeding habitat or as a stop @-@ over on their migratory route . Once @-@ common native species such as the willow flycatcher , gray catbird , warbling vireo , American redstart , black tern , and yellow @-@ billed cuckoo are no longer found along the river . The common yellowthroat and yellow @-@ breasted chat are still found in small isolated populations . The most common species now found are the black @-@ billed magpie , mourning dove , western meadowlark , barn swallow , and the non @-@ native ring @-@ necked pheasant and starlings . 
 = = = Vegetation = = = 
 Vegetation in the watershed is closely tied to elevation and precipitation levels . About 30 percent of the basin , mostly at higher elevation levels , is populated with oak , aspen and coniferous trees . At the lower levels , 27 percent of the basin is rich in mountain @-@ brush , sagebrush , juniper and grasses . About 34 percent of the Jordan River basin is classified as urban . 
 Russian olive and tamarisk or salt cedar trees now dominate the Jordan River floodplain where willow trees and cottonwood trees would once have been found . Plant species such as foxtail barley , <unk> , rabbitbrush , cattails and other reeds are still found in small pockets along the river . Exotic pasture grasses such as orchard grass , bluegrass , <unk> bentgrass , <unk> , wheatgrass and fescue have become the common species of grass . The vulnerable flower , Ute 's Ladies ' <unk> , can also be found along the river . 
 = = Pollution = = 
 The Jordan River has been a repository for waste since the settling of the Salt Lake Valley . For 100 years , raw , untreated sewage was dumped into the river ; farming and animal runoff occurred ; and mining operations led to 40 smelters being built and contaminating the river with heavy metals , mostly arsenic and lead . In 1962 , the river in Midvale recorded a total coliform level of about 3 million per 100 milliliters , even though the state of Utah criteria for the total number of coliform bacteria in water samples should not exceed 5 @,@ 000 per 100 milliliters . In 1965 , a new sewage treatment plant came on @-@ line in Salt Lake City that prevented 32 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 US gallons per day ( 120 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) of raw sewage from being dumped into a canal . 
 The Utah Division of Water Quality and Utah Division of Drinking Water are responsible for the regulation and management of water quality in the State of Utah . Streams that exceed the standard contamination levels are placed on the 303d list in accordance with the Clean Water Act . The Act also requires states to identify impaired water bodies every two years and develop a total maximum daily load ( TMDL ) for pollutants that may cause impairments in the various water bodies . The Jordan River and Little Cottonwood Creek were included on the 2006 303d list ; parameters that exceeded the standard level for at least part of the Jordan River include temperature , dissolved oxygen , total dissolved solids , E. Coli and salinity .

 Superfund sites are designated as being among the nation 's worst areas with respect to toxic and hazardous waste . The Environmental Protection Agency is the federal agency that determines if a particular site is hazardous , prepares a course of action to reduce the hazard , and finds the parties responsible for the pollution . If a site is listed with the Superfund program , federal dollars are available for cleanup . 
 The Kennecott South Zone / Bingham site contains contamination from Kennecott Copper Mine 's operation in <unk> , at the base of the Oquirrh Mountains to Bingham Creek and Butterfield Creek . A 72 @-@ square @-@ mile ( 190 km2 ) plume of lead , arsenic and sulfates ( covering 9 percent of the watershed ) currently contaminates the ground water from the mine site all the way to the Jordan River . The largest inland reverse osmosis plant in the country was built in 2006 to clean up the ground water and a second plant has been scheduled for construction ; completion of the ground water cleanup , however , is not projected until 2040 . In 1998 , the site was removed from the Superfund list due to Kennecott 's progress in the cleanup and a consent decree legally obligating Kennecott to continue the rest of the cleanup . 
 The Murray Smelter site was the location of a large lead smelter in operation from 1872 until 1949 . The 142 @-@ acre ( 57 ha ) site contained groundwater contamination from arsenic and lead , but the majority of the cleanup was completed in 2001 . 
 In Midvale , there are two Superfund sites that sit along 4 percent of the Jordan River . The Midvale Slag site is a 446 @-@ acre ( 180 ha ) site adjacent to 6 @,@ 800 feet ( 2 @,@ 100 m ) of the Jordan River . From 1871 to 1958 , the site contained five separate smelters that processed ores from Kennecott and other mines . The site was contaminated with lead , arsenic , chromium , and cadmium . Cleanup of the property is complete , although the Jordan River Riparian Project still underway as of 2010 . Sharon Steel was a 460 @-@ acre ( 190 ha ) site adjacent to 4 @,@ 500 feet ( 1 @,@ 400 m ) of the Jordan River which was used , from 1902 to 1971 , for smelting copper from Kennecott Copper Mine .

 = Neo soul = 
 Neo soul is a genre of popular music . The term was coined by music industry entrepreneur Kedar Massenburg during the late 1990s to market and describe a style of music that emerged from soul and contemporary R & B. Heavily based in soul music , neo soul is distinguished by a less conventional sound than its contemporary R & B counterpart , with incorporated elements ranging from jazz , funk , and hip hop to pop , fusion , and African music . It has been noted by music writers for its traditional R & B influences , conscious @-@ driven lyrics , and strong female presence . 
 Neo soul developed during the 1980s and early 1990s , in the United States and United Kingdom , as a soul revival movement . It earned mainstream success during the 1990s , with the commercial and critical breakthroughs of several artists , including D 'Angelo , Erykah Badu , Lauryn Hill , and Maxwell . Their music was marketed as an alternative to the producer @-@ driven , digitally approached R & B of the time . 
 Since its initial mainstream popularity and impact on the sound of contemporary R & B , neo soul has been expanded and diversified musically through the works of both African @-@ American and international artists . Its mainstream presence declined during the 2000s , although newer artists emerged through more independent means of marketing their music . According to music journalist Mark Anthony Neal , " neo @-@ soul and its various incarnations has helped to redefine the boundaries and contours of black pop . " 
 = = Etymology = = 
 As a term , neo soul was coined by Kedar Massenburg of Motown Records in the late 1990s as a marketing category following the commercial breakthroughs of artists such as D 'Angelo , Erykah Badu , Lauryn Hill , and Maxwell . The success of D 'Angelo 's 1995 debut album Brown Sugar has been regarded by several writers and music critics as inspiration behind the term 's origin . While some artists have ignored the label , others have received the designation with controversy because it may seem contrived to music audiences and imply that soul music had ended at some point in time . In a 2002 interview for Billboard , Massenburg said that genre classifications are often unpopular because they may be suggestive of a short @-@ lived trend . However , although he said neo soul is still essentially soul music , Massenburg felt there was a need to market artists of the genre for listeners to have an understanding of what they were buying . 
 In a 2010 article for PopMatters , music writer Tyler Lewis said that neo soul has been received with much controversy : " Given the way black music has been named by ( usually ) outsiders ever since the blues , the reaction to the name by artists who ostensibly fit into the ' neo @-@ soul ' category represents a wonderful example of black self @-@ determination in an industry that is still defiantly wedded to narrow definitions and images of black folks . " Jason Anderson of CBC News compares the etymology of neo soul to that of " new wave " and comments : " As imperfect as the term may be , neo @-@ soul is still an effective tag to describe the mix of chic modernity and time @-@ honoured tradition that distinguished the genre 's best examples . Neo @-@ soul artists tried to look both backward and forward , acting in the belief that a continuum might exist . " 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Despite some ambivalence from artists , the term received widespread use by music critics and writers who wrote about artists and albums associated with the musical style . African American studies professor Mark Anthony Neal has described neo soul as " everything from avant @-@ garde R & B to organic soul ... a product of trying to develop something outside of the norm in R & B " . According to music writers , the genre 's works are mostly album @-@ oriented and distinguished by its musicianship and production , incorporating " organic " elements of classic soul music with the use of live instrumentation , in contrast to the more single @-@ oriented , hip hop @-@ based , and producer @-@ driven sampling approach of contemporary R & B. They also infuse jazz , funk , and African musical elements into R & B. In her book Musical Rhythm in the Age of Digital Reproduction , music author Anne Danielson wrote that neo soul toward the end of the 1990s exhibited a musical development that was part of " a remarkable increase in musicians ' experimentation with and manipulation of grooves at the <unk> level – that is , the level in played music that is usually understood in terms of phrasing and timing . " 
 Noting that most of the genre 's artists are singer @-@ songwriters , writers have viewed their lyrical content as more " conscious @-@ driven " and having a broader range than most other R & B artists . AllMusic calls it " roughly analogous to contemporary R & B " . Dimitri Ehrlich of Vibe said that they " emphasize a mix of elegant , jazz @-@ tinged R & B and subdued hip hop , with a highly idiosyncratic , deeply personal approach to love and politics " . Music writers have noted that neo soul artists are predominantly female , which contrasts the marginalized presence of women in mainstream hip hop and R & B. Jason Anderson of CBC News called neo soul a " sinuous , sly yet unabashedly earnest " alternative and " kind of haven for listeners turned off by the hedonism of mainstream hip @-@ hop and club jams . " Neo soul artists are often associated with alternative lifestyles and fashions , including organic food , incense , and knit caps . 
 According to music writer Peter Shapiro , the term itself refers to a musical style that obtains its influence from older R & B styles , and bohemian musicians seeking a soul revival , while setting themselves apart from the more contemporary sounds of their mainstream R & B counterparts . In a 1998 article on neo soul , Time journalist Christopher John Farley wrote that singers such as Hill , D 'Angelo , and Maxwell " share a willingness to challenge musical orthodoxy " . Miles Marshall Lewis commented that 1990s neo soul " owed its raison d 'être to ' 70s soul superstars like Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder " , adding that " in concert , Erykah Badu and D 'Angelo regularly covered Chaka Khan , the Ohio Players , and Al Green , to make the lineage crystal clear . " In citing Tony ! Toni ! Tone ! as progenitors of the genre , Tony Green of Vibe viewed that the group pioneered the " digital @-@ analog hybrid sound " of neo soul and " dramatically refreshed the digitalized wasteland that was R & B in the late ' 80s " . Neo soul artists during the 1990s were heavily inspired by the eclectic sound and mellow instrumentation of Gil Scott @-@ Heron 's and Brian Jackson 's collaborative work in the 1970s . All About Jazz cited Jackson as " one of the early architects " of the sound and his early work with Scott @-@ Heron as " an inspirational and musical Rosetta stone for the neo @-@ soul movement " .

 Neo soul originated in the 1980s and early 1990s , with the work of musical acts such as Prince , Tony ! Toni !

Toné ! <unk> Raphael Saadiq later embarked on a solo career and produced various works of other neo soul artists . Influential to neo soul , UK act Sade achieved success in the 1980s with music that featured a <unk> @-@ pop style , incorporating elements of soul , pop , smooth jazz , and quiet storm . The band was part of a new wave of British R & B @-@ oriented artists during the late @-@ 1980s and early 1990s that also included Soul II Soul , Caron Wheeler , The Brand New Heavies , Jamiroquai , and Lisa Stansfield . AllMusic 's Alex Henderson writes that , " Many of the British artists who emerged during that period had a neo @-@ soul outlook and were able to blend influences from different eras " . Other British progenitors of the neo soul movement at the time included Young Disciples and Omar Lye @-@ Fook , the latter of whom has been cited as " the father of British neo @-@ soul " and an influence on many future artists . 
 According to Christopher John Farley , Prince had been " carrying a torch for neo soul for decades , refusing to make R & B that played by the rules or fit into comfortable formats . In the mid- ' 90s , he was suddenly joined by a host of other soul artists who also wanted to break boundaries " . American artists during the early 1990s included <unk> , Groove Theory , Joi , Tony Rich , and Me 'Shell NdegéOcello .

 The success of Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! ' s 1993 album Sons of Soul has been viewed as a precursor to the soul music revival in the mid @-@ 1990s . In a 1997 article for the Los Angeles Times , music journalist Cheo <unk> Coker cited the album as having " largely sparked the soul music revival that has opened the door for a new generation of singers who build on the tradition of Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder " . Allmusic editor Leo Stanley wrote that by the release of Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! ' s follow @-@ up album House of Music in 1996 , " their influence was beginning to be apparent , as younger soul singer / songwriters like Tony Rich and Maxwell began reaching the R & B charts . Like Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! , Rich and Maxwell relied on traditional soul and R & B values of songwriting and live performances , discarding the synth @-@ heavy productions of the late ' 80s and early ' 90s " . Malcolm Venable of Vibe cites the early work of hip hop group The Roots , who used live instrumentation , as a precursor to neo soul 's commercial breakthrough in the mid @-@ 1990s . 
 Music journalists have credited the successes of D 'Angelo 's Brown Sugar ( 1995 ) , Badu 's Baduizm ( 1997 ) , Maxwell 's Urban Hang Suite ( 1996 ) , and Hill 's The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill ( 1998 ) with shaping and raising the neo soul movement to commercial visibility into the late 1990s . According to Farley , D 'Angelo 's album " gives a nod to the past , [ ... ] mints his own sound , with golden humming keyboards and sensual vocals and unhurried melodies [ ... ] His songs were polished without being slick and smart without being pretentious " , while Badu " brought an iconoclastic spirit to soul music , with her towering Afrocentric <unk> , incense candles , and quirky lyrics " . Baduizm sold nearly three million copies and won Badu two Grammy Awards . Hill 's debut featured her singing and rapping , with deeply personal lyrics , and was one of neo soul 's primary successes , achieving massive sales , critical acclaim , and five Grammy Awards . Subsequently , other female artists broke through with their debut albums , including Macy Gray , Angie Stone , and Jill Scott . The 1997 film Love Jones capitalized on neo soul 's success at the time with its soundtrack album , which impacted the Billboard charts and featured artists such as Hill , Maxwell , The Brand New Heavies , Me 'Shell NdegéOcello , Groove Theory , and Dionne Farris . 
 According to Greg Kot , the musical collective <unk> of such artists as D 'Angelo , The Roots , Erykah Badu , Bilal , Mos Def , Common , James Poyser , and Q @-@ <unk> significantly to the neo soul movement during the late 1990s to the early 2000s with its members ' " organic soul , natural R & B , <unk> @-@ rap " . The collective developed through the production work of The Roots ' drummer and producer Questlove . Following a minor decline in its hype , neo soul 's mainstream popularity increased in the late 1990s with the successes of Hill , Maxwell , Eric Benét , Saadiq , and Les Nubians . It impacted more mainstream @-@ oriented R & B radio , while influencing contemporary R & B acts , such as R. Kelly and Aaliyah , to incorporate some of its textural and lyrical elements . In his song " When a Woman 's Fed Up " ( 1998 ) , Kelly incorporated a more soul @-@ based sound and referenced Erykah Badu 's 1997 song " Tyrone " in the lyrics .

 With the success of albums by Hill , Badu , and Maxwell , D 'Angelo 's second album Voodoo served as a further alternative to excesses of late 1990s R & B and hip hop , as neo soul reached its apex in 2000 . A production of the Soulquarians , it was an exemplary creative milestone of neo soul . Ben Ratliff of The New York Times called the album " the <unk> d <unk> that proves the force of this new music : it is a largely <unk> , stubbornly idiosyncratic and genuinely great album that has already produced two hit singles " . By the time of her second album Mama 's Gun ( 2000 ) , Erykah Badu had been dubbed by writers as " the queen of neo @-@ soul " . She said of the honorific title , " I hated that because what if I don ’ t do that anymore ? What if I change ? Then that puts me in a penitentiary . " Subsequently , other artists attained success in the early 2000s , including Bilal , Musiq Soulchild , India.Arie , and Alicia Keys , who broke through to broader popularity with her debut album Songs in A Minor ( 2001 ) . Hip hop artists such as The Roots and Common , associated with the Soulquarians , released albums that incorporated neo soul , Phrenology ( 2002 ) and Electric Circus ( 2003 ) . 
 However , the decade later featured a decline in output by neo soul artists , with many of them failing to make a commercial impact after previous successes or not releasing a follow @-@ up album . Badu 's commercial viability decreased as each of her releases following her debut Baduizm departed further from that album 's music . Hill followed @-@ up her 1998 debut , considered the best @-@ selling neo soul album , with the 2002 live album MTV Unplugged No. 2 @.@ 0 , a combative , confessional work in which she expresses her misgivings about fame . Melena Ryzik of The New York Times wrote in a retrospect of that " era of left @-@ of @-@ center black singer @-@ songwriters " , stating " many of them struggled to keep their creative momentum , conflicted about their early mainstream success . " Producer and Soulquarians member Questlove elaborated on the artists ' regression from the mainstream , saying " I think most of us went through our psychosomatic , quasi @-@ self @-@ saboteur stage . Once we got that first taste of success , I think just the pressure of reacting got to all of us . Some of us released some of the craziest records of our career . " Other artists such as D 'Angelo and Hill went on indefinite hiatus from the music scene . Tyler Lewis from PopMatters attributed the decline to " the downside of [ the ] rejection of the term [ ' neo soul ' ] " . 
 " The industry , which already has a hard time with unapologetic and complicated black artists , had no idea what to do with all these enormously talented individuals who rejected entire marketing campaigns designed to ' break ' them to the record @-@ buying public . As such , albums were shelved or delayed or retooled and artists were dropped from major labels and forced to go it alone , making the first decade of the 21st century the least " soulful " — however you define it — decade for the industry itself in … well , decades . " 
 The Boston Globe 's Renée Graham wrote of the artists ' ambivalence towards the term in a 2003 article on neo soul 's standing , " Despite its critical success , if neo @-@ soul had an initial failing , it was the media @-@ created label itself – a term that the artists , whom it was meant to represent , generally rejected " . In a 2003 interview , music publicist John Constanza said that " The neo @-@ soul movement is still there , but it 's been underground , and it 's trying to get the attention of the mainstream again " . Mark Edward Nero of About.com stated , " In general , neo @-@ soul has remained almost exclusive to R & B outlets such as urban radio and Black Entertainment Television [ ... ] the majority of neo @-@ soul artists have yet to crossover to mainstream American music listeners , partially because the music 's sound generally focuses on artist expression , rather than popular appeal " . 
 During the mid @-@ 2000s , emerging artists such as Heather Headley , Anthony David , J Davey , Eric Roberson , and <unk> signed to independent soul labels and received exposure through independent retailers , neo soul @-@ oriented web sites , college and public radio stations , city club venues , cable networks such as Music Choice and BET J , and publishing deals as writers and producers for major label @-@ recording artists . Erykah Badu and Maxwell returned from their respective hiatuses and released well @-@ received albums , her New Amerykah albums and his 2009 album <unk> <unk> , and they subsequently toured together . VH1 Soul 's series <unk> , which began in 2007 , showcased new music by artists such as Badu , Jill Scott , India.Arie , Q @-@ Tip , and Saadiq .

 Since its original popularity , neo soul has been expanded and diversified musically through the works of both African @-@ American and international artists . The more popular neo soul artists in recent years are John Legend , Anthony Hamilton , Jill Scott , Maxwell , Chrisette Michele , Leela James , and Raheem <unk> . <unk> has described himself as an " R & B Hippy Neo @-@ Soul Rock Star " , viewing it as a reference to his eclectic musical style . In its 2010 issue on critical moments in popular music , Spin cited D 'Angelo 's Voodoo and its success as a turning point for neo soul : " D 'Angelo 's pastiche of funk , carnal ache , and high @-@ minded , Afrocentric rhetoric stands as neo @-@ soul 's crowning achievement . So unsurpassable that it 'd be eight years before we 'd hear from Erykah Badu and Maxwell again , while Hill and D 'Angelo remain missing . But Alicia Keys , John Legend , and Cee @-@ Lo picked up D 's mantle and ran with it " . Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club discerns " a line of revelatory , late @-@ period neo @-@ soul albums " with the releases of Maxwell 's <unk> <unk> ( 2009 ) , Badu 's New Amerykah Part Two ( Return of the Ankh ) ( 2010 ) , Bilal 's Airtight 's Revenge ( 2010 ) , and Frank Ocean 's Channel Orange ( 2012 ) .
