 The most significant predators of the gray mouse lemur are the Madagascar long @-@ eared owl and barn owl . Studies conducted in Beza Mahafaly Reserve and Kirindy Mitea National Park indicate a predation rate of around 25 % ( percent population taken by predators per year ) , the highest known for any primate species . However , given the species ' high reproductive potential , predation does not appear to have a drastic effect on its populations . Other raptors , such as Henst 's goshawk and other owls , also prey upon this species . Snakes , such as <unk> <unk> ( a native <unk> snake ) and the Madagascar tree boa , as well as mammalian predators , such as the ring @-@ tailed mongoose , narrow @-@ striped mongoose , fossa , and domestic dogs are also known to prey on the gray mouse lemur . Mammalian predators often discover tree holes serving as nests , and enlarge the opening so they can catch and eat the occupant . This puts strong selective pressure on the choice of nest hole opening diameter and <unk> . 
 Due to its non @-@ gregarious nature , the gray mouse lemur , like other nocturnal lemurs , primarily defends itself from predators using avoidance strategies , although group defense through the use of alarm calls and predator mobbing has been observed in this species . Studies involving the placement of predator and non @-@ predator fecal odor with captive populations have demonstrated a genetic predisposition for predator recognition through the detection of metabolites from meat digestion . The mouse lemurs were shown to avoid locations where they typically received rewards , as well as exhibit increased activity and anti @-@ predator behavior , when the odor of predator feces were present in that vicinity , but not when the fecal odor of Malagasy non @-@ predators was present . 
 During the day , when they are most vulnerable , individuals shelter inside tree holes , sometimes forming nests . They may use three to nine different tree holes within their home range , yet individuals may use one particular hole for up to five consecutive days . Mouse lemurs tend to prefer tree hollows , but also commonly make spherical constructions out of leaves . Nests are usually found in tree holes with a minimum diameter of 5 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) , with a median of 13 cm ( 5 @.@ 1 in ) , suggesting that this range in diameter of tree holes may be crucial for maintaining a healthy habitat . The gray mouse lemur also spends most of its time in dense vegetation , limiting its visibility and accessibility to predators . Furthermore , it has a high reproductive rate to counter losses to predation . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 The gray mouse lemur is nocturnal , sleeping during the day in tree holes lined with leaf litter or purpose @-@ built spherical nests constructed from dead leaves , moss and twigs . It usually forages alone at night , but may sleep in groups during the day , the composition of which depends on gender and season . Tree holes can be shared with up to 15 other individuals , although males tend to sleep alone while females tend to share nests . 
 All mouse lemurs are highly active at night , often scurrying like mice and leaping over 3 m ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) , using the tail as a balancing organ . When moving among the terminal branches of bushes and trees , they grip using all four feet and move with four legs . When on the ground , either to catch insects or cross short open areas , mouse lemurs hop like a frog . When hunting , the grey mouse lemur is known to catch invertebrates and small vertebrates with quick hand grasps . 
 In the dry season , the gray mouse lemur faces the challenge of exploiting sparsely distributed feeding resources efficiently . Results of a recent study on this showed that the gray mouse lemur does not move around randomly , but rather use spatial cues to <unk> food resources in the absence of sensory cues , and that they seem to reuse common , highly efficient routes with regard to travel distance . It is believed that rather than using a route @-@ based network , the gray mouse lemur has some sense of mental representation of their spatial environment , which they use to find and exploit food resources . 
 Foraging behavior is often slow , with height and direction changing continuously . Predation of insects occurs primarily on the ground . Before descending , the ear pinnae move alternately to help pinpoint the precise location of their prey . Insects are captured during a rapid dash across the leaf litter and are transported by mouth up into the relative safety of the branches . Studies with captive gray mouse lemurs have shown that vision is primarily used for prey detection , although the other senses certainly play a role in foraging . 
 The gray mouse lemur is omnivorous , feeding primarily on fruit and invertebrates . Local populations appear to specialize on locally available fruit . At both Marosalaza and Mandena , beetles are the primary insect prey , although moths , praying mantids , <unk> bugs , crickets , cockroaches , and spiders are also eaten . Less than half the diet consists of insects , with fruit making up a slightly larger fraction . This lemur also consumes flowers , gums and nectar from Euphorbia and Terminalia trees , leaves ( Uapaca sp . ) , exudates ( <unk> larvae secretions ) , and small vertebrates such as tree frogs , geckos , and chameleons . Its diet is seasonally varied and diverse in content , giving it a very broad feeding niche compared to other species such as the Madame Berthe 's mouse lemur . Therefore , it is affected more by food availability than by niche partitioning where sympatry occurs . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 As with all members of the mouse lemur genus , the gray mouse lemur is known to enter short states of daily torpor , particularly during the cool , dry Southern Hemisphere winter . This rare trait in primates , coupled with the ease of observing the species within its wide geographic distribution and its good representation in captivity , makes it a popular subject for research as a model organism . 
 The gray mouse lemur is unique among the mouse lemurs studied so far because it is the only species to exhibit prolonged seasonal torpor , but this behavior has only been observed to occur in one locality . Activity patterns can differ noticeably between sexes as well as populations . At the <unk> Forestry Station in Ankarafantsika National Park , males and females exhibit daily , rather than seasonal torpor . At Kirindy Forest , both sexes share the same daily torpor , yet during the dry season ( April / May through September / October ) , females become completely inactive for several weeks or up to five months to conserve energy and reduce predation . However , males rarely remain inactive for more than a few days and become extremely active before the females revive from torpor , allowing them to establish hierarchies and territories for the breeding season . The use of alternative energy @-@ saving strategies under the same environmental conditions was observed directly in 2008 , providing the first physiological confirmation from the field . This pattern of seasonal versus daily torpor may relate to the seasonality of the region , since Kirindy is the only location west of the eastern mountain rainforests that experiences very low temperatures at night during the winter months . By entering extended torpor , sometimes referred to as hibernation , this would reduce the thermoregulatory stress in females , whereas males remain more active in preparation for the upcoming mating season . No difference in mortality has been shown between hibernating females and active males . 
 During torpor , the gray mouse lemur 's metabolic rate slows and its body temperature drops to the ambient temperature , as low as 7 ° C ( 45 ° F ) . During the cooler months of May though August , the species selects tree holes closer to ground level , where ambient temperatures remain more stable . This allows them to remain in torpor longer , and to conserve metabolic resources . One study showed that during the breeding season , both males and females reduced their energy expenditure by 20 % when they nested in pairs , and a maximal energetic benefit of 40 % was achieved when three mouse lemurs nested together . Even during the nonbreeding season , maximal energetic gain was observed two or more animals nested together , because resting metabolic rate was already decreased . 
 While the gray mouse lemur is found in both primary and secondary deciduous forests , they have lower population densities in secondary forests . This is because variations in gray mouse lemur abundance are linked to their capacity to enter torpor during the dry season , especially for females , which tend to hibernate longer than males . In primary forests , they can maintain daily torpor or hibernation as long as their body temperatures remain below 28 ° C ( 82 ° F ) , but in secondary forests that have fewer large trees , temperatures are higher and inhibit the gray mouse lemur 's ability to maintain torpor for prolonged periods of time . In addition , the gray mouse lemur in secondary forests tend to have a lower body mass than those in primary forests , as well as lower survival rates . This is likely because those with lower body mass are less likely to enter torpor , and therefore expend around 40 % more energy than those that do maintain torpor . 
 This unusual ability for a primate to exhibit dormancy , in addition to the diminutive size , has led researchers to speculate that ancestral lemurs , and possibly ancestral primates , may have shared some traits with mouse lemurs . Consequently , the gray mouse lemur has once again been used as a model organism for studying lemur and primate evolution . For example , lemurs are thought to have colonized Madagascar by rafting to the island around 60 million years ago according to molecular phylogenetic studies . Before the discovery that ocean currents were the opposite of what they are today , thus favoring such an event , it was thought that it would have taken too long for any animal not capable of entering a state of dormancy to survive the trip . Therefore , the mouse lemurs , such as the gray mouse lemur , were thought to have shared this plesiomorphic ( ancestral ) trait with the ancestral lemurs . 
 = = = Social systems = = = 
 The gray mouse lemur is described as solitary but social , foraging alone at night , but frequently sleeping in groups during the day . This social pattern varies by gender , season , and location . Females tend to share nests with other females and their offspring , whereas males tend to sleep alone or in pairs outside of the breeding season . Groups of females sharing a nest can be relatively stable , consisting of two to nine individuals , although a male may be found with a group of females outside the breeding season . During the breeding season ( September through October ) , males and females may sleep in the same tree hole . Mixed sex groups can be common at this time , with single males sharing nest sites with three to seven females or single females sharing nest sites with one to three males . 
 Research has shown that home ranges for the gray mouse lemur are usually small , possibly less than 50 m ( 160 ft ) . Males typically travel further at night and have home ranges that are twice as large as those of females , often overlapping with one another , and always overlapping with at least one female 's home range . Male home ranges increase threefold during the breeding season . 
 Female home ranges overlap less than those of males , although localized concentrations , or " population nuclei " , tend to form in some areas , where the sex ratio favors females to males by three or four to one at the nucleus core . Genetic studies indicate that females arrange themselves spatially in clusters ( " population nuclei " ) of related individuals , while males tend to emigrate from their natal group . Research has shown that females in this species may maintain smaller ranges and associate more closely with other females than in some other mouse lemur species due to a more opportunistic feeding niche and , in the case of populations at Kirindy , the use of extended , seasonal torpor . 
 = = = Communication = = = 
 Vocalizations and scent are the primarily modes of communication within this species . Home ranges are scent marked with urine and feces . Vocalizations are complex and very high @-@ pitched ( ranging from 10 to 36 kHz ) , sometimes beyond the range of human hearing ( 0 @.@ 02 to 20 kHz ) . These include calls for seeking contact , mating , distant communication , alarm , and distress . 
 Like other mouse lemurs , the gray mouse lemur uses what has been described as a harmonic whistle call that is lower in frequency and shorter in duration than its close relative , the brown mouse lemur . In addition , it has been found that the types of vocalizations emitted by the gray mouse lemur can be dependent upon the environment . In the more open dry forest habitats favored by the gray mouse lemur , trill calls are more common and effective since they carry faster and are less likely to be masked by the wind , while chirp calls are more common in the brown mouse lemur , which favors closed rain forest habitats . 
 As with other social mammals , the calls reveal the sex and identity of the individual . Dialects have also been detected between communities . The male trill call , part of the male mating display , is much like a bird song in terms of its ordered sequence of broadband frequency modulated syllables , ranging between 13 and 35 kHz in pitch and lasting 0 @.@ 3 to 0 @.@ 9 seconds , repeating up to 1 @.@ 5 times per minute . Each locality has its own theme of trill calls that is distinct from those of neighboring communities , and resident males produce individually distinct trill calls within that theme . These calls are not genetically programmed . During play , young males produce early attempts at the trill call , which show high degrees of variability . Research has shown that the male mouse lemurs consciously manipulate the dialect to resemble those of their neighbors , when transferred from their home to a new neighborhood . This may reduce aggression and foster social acceptance for emigrant males as they transfer from their natal group upon maturity . 
 Because mouse lemurs are cryptic species , and therefore visually indistinguishable , their social calls help individuals select mates of their own species . This differentiated signaling and recognition system has promoted species cohesiveness through <unk> isolation , and helped researchers distinguish and identify species . 
 = = = Breeding and reproduction = = = 
 The mating system is described as multi @-@ male and multi @-@ female . Males establish dominance hierarchies prior to the mating season , however , some studies in the wild have shown no male aggression or visible competition for receptive females . Males in captivity become highly aggressive and form strict dominance hierarchies . These captive males may show the highest plasma testosterone levels found in mammals , and even the odor of a dominant male can lower the testosterone levels and sexually inhibit a subordinate male . During the breeding season , male testes increase significantly in size , facilitating sperm competition due to female promiscuity . Studies with the gray mouse lemur have shown that the optimal insemination period , during which a male is most likely to sire offspring , occurs early during a female 's receptivity . Only during the mating season does male mortality rise above that of female mortality . 
 Although the gray mouse lemur displays multi @-@ male , multi @-@ female mating patterns , studies have shown that females do exhibit indirect mate selection ( a form of selected polyandry ) . During the study , females would mate with 1 – 7 males up to 11 times during their single night of receptivity , but would avoid or counteract males that attempted to monopolize mating . Dominant males that attempt to monopolize tend to be larger and heavier individuals . Female selection however , has been shown to help increase genetic diversity among offspring . 
 The gray mouse lemur is considered overall sexually monomorphic , but seasonally fluctuating sexual dimorphism in terms of body mass has been recorded . While the body mass of both sexes fluctuates over the year as a function of food availability , being highest in the rainy season , the differing behavioral repertoires of the sexes lead to sex @-@ specific patterns in this fluctuation . For example , male body mass increases prior to the mating season due to a substantial increase in testes volume that likely enhances the males ' success in sperm competition . 
 The females are receptive for 45 to 55 days between September and October , with estrus lasting 1 to 5 days . Females advertise estrus by distinctive high @-@ frequency calls and scent @-@ marking . Gestation lasts 54 to 68 days , averaging 60 days , typically resulting in 2 or 3 offspring weighing 5 g ( 0 @.@ 18 oz ) each . Infants are born in a leaf nest or tree hole in November prior to the onset of the rainy season . Weaning occurs after 25 days , and the infants are either left in the nest or carried in the mother 's mouth and deposited on a branch while she forages . Infant mouse lemurs do not cling to the mother 's fur . Independence is attained in 2 months , while sexual maturity is reached at 10 to 29 months in females and 7 to 19 months in males . Closely related females remain loosely associated after maturation ( female philopatry ) , whereas males disperse from their natal area . In the wild , the gray mouse lemur 's reproductive lifespan is no more than 5 years , although captive specimens have reportedly lived as long as 15 years and 5 months . 
 The gray mouse lemur uses cooperative breeding as a form of family insurance . The female regularly transfers her offspring to other females ' nests — and likewise grooms and cares for offspring other than her own . While this can have a high physiological cost on a lactating female that is already expending a lot of energy , it can be beneficial overall to insuring survival among closely related groups with high mortality risk . A study that took place over three breeding seasons showed that closely related females form breeding groups mainly when there is a shortage of suitable roosts ; when there is an advantage of a communal nest for defense , or when there are thermoregulatory benefits . In the event of offspring adoption , when a parent dies and a closely related female takes over care , it is believed that this is beneficial to groups with high mortality risk . 
 = = Conservation status = = 
 The gray mouse lemur was listed in Appendix 1 by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) in 1975 , declaring it as threatened with extinction and prohibiting international trade of specimens except for non @-@ commercial use , such as scientific research . The 2008 International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) Red List assessment lists it as a species of least concern ( LC ) with a decreasing population trend . 
 Its greatest threats are habitat loss from slash @-@ and @-@ burn agriculture and cattle @-@ grazing , as well as live capture for the local pet trade in the northern and southern parts of its range . Although this species inhabits secondary forests , studies have shown that decreased habitat quality adversely affects its populations since fewer tree holes offer fewer opportunities to conserve energy , increasing stress and mortality . One study found nine species of parasites in the fecal matter of the gray mouse lemur living in forests that suffered degradation and fragmentation . In small fragments of good quality forest , as well as forests with high levels of degradation , the gray mouse lemur showed a higher prevalence of parasitic nematodes and protozoans than those in larger good quality forest fragments . Studies in the late 1960s and 1970s showed that heavy logging between 1968 and 1970 seemed to result in decreased body weight , the use of smaller trees for nesting sites , and a smaller maximum female nesting group size ( down to 7 from 15 ) . There is also a concern that although daily torpor can help conserve energy and resources during moderate food shortages , extended food shortages brought about by climate change could create too much stress and severely impact the survivability of the species . 
 The gray mouse lemur is considered one of Madagascar 's most abundant small native mammals , found in seven national parks , five special reserves , the Berenty Private Reserve , and other privately protected forests within the Mandena Conservation Zone . 
 This species of mouse lemur breeds very well in captivity , although it is not commonly displayed in zoos like some larger , diurnal lemurs . In 1989 , more than 370 individuals were housed by 14 International Species Information System ( ISIS ) and non @-@ ISIS institutions across the United States and Europe , 97 % of which were captive born . In March 2009 , 167 were registered at 29 ISIS institutions , including the Duke Lemur Center . 
 = Grammy Award for Best Female Rap Solo Performance = 
 The Grammy Award for Best Female Rap Solo Performance was an honor presented to female recording artists at the 45th Grammy Awards in 2003 and the 46th Grammy Awards in 2004 for quality rap solo performances . The Grammy Awards , an annual ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards , are presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to " honor artistic achievement , technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry , without regard to album sales or chart position " . 
 In 1991 , the Academy began to honor individual rap performances with the Best Rap Solo Performance category . In 2003 , the category was split into two to recognize Female and Male Rap Solo Performances . The categories remained separated by gender until 2005 when they were combined into the genderless category originally called Best Rap Solo Performance . American artist Missy Elliott won the award for Best Female Rap Solo Performance both years it was presented .

 In 1991 , the Academy began to honor individual rap performances with the Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance category . The category name remained unchanged until 2004 when it was split into separate categories for Female and Male Rap Solo Performance . The categories remained separated by gender for one additional year . In 2005 , they were merged into the genderless category originally known as Best Rap Solo Performance . Female rapper MC Lyte has campaigned for the reinstatement of the female @-@ specific category and believes that : " it destroys [ hip @-@ hop ] culture to not have the perspective of a woman " . Bill Freimuth , Recording Academy Vice President of Awards , claimed that the category was eliminated because " [ there ] wasn 't enough competition essentially , due to the lack of the number of releases in that category " . Black Entertainment Television ( BET ) executive Stephen Hill cited a similar reason for the elimination of the female categories by the BET Hip Hop Awards and VH1 's Hip Hop Honors , reflecting a lack of female representation in the hip hop music scene for several years . As of 2011 , the category name has not changed since 2005 .

Baltimore was shocked when she learned of her album 's nomination because she thought that it did not meet eligibility requirements . Elliott was also nominated for Best Short Form Music Video , along with Knoc @-@ turn 'al and Dr. Dre , for " Knoc " . The award was presented to Elliott at Madison Square Garden in New York City , though not broadcast on television . 
 Nominees for the 46th Grammy Awards included : Da Brat for " Got It Poppin ' " , Elliott for " Work It " , Lil ' Kim for " Came Back for You " , MC Lyte for " Ride Wit Me " , and Queen Latifah for " Go Head " . In addition , Elliott was nominated for : Album of the Year and Best Rap Album for Under Construction , Best Song Rap for " Work It " , and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for " Gossip Folks " ( featuring Ludacris ) , for a total five nominations . Lil ' Kim was also nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals for " Can 't Hold Us Down " ( with Christina Aguilera ) and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for " Magic Stick " ( featuring 50 Cent ) . The award was presented to Elliott for " Work It " , whose music video was awarded Video of the Year and Best Hip @-@ Hop Video at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards . 
 Elliott won the award for Best Female Rap Solo Performance both years it was presented . Prior to the female and male categories , she received the award for Best Rap Solo Performance in 2002 for " Get Ur Freak On " . This marked the second time a female had received the award for Best Rap Solo Performance ( Queen Latifah was presented the honor for " <unk> " at the 37th Grammy Awards in 1995 ) . In 2007 , following the return to the genderless category , Elliot was nominated for the song " We Run This " . 
 = Music of the Lesser Antilles = 
 The music of the Lesser Antilles encompasses the music of this chain of small islands making up the eastern and southern portion of the West Indies . Lesser Antillean music is part of the broader category of Caribbean music ; much of the folk and popular music is also a part of the Afro @-@ American musical complex , being a mixture of African , European and indigenous American elements . The Lesser Antilles ' musical cultures are largely based on the music of African slaves brought by European traders and colonizers . The African musical elements are a hybrid of instruments and styles from numerous West African tribes , while the European slaveholders added their own musics into the mix , as did immigrants from India . In many ways , the Lesser Antilles can be musically divided based on which nation colonized them . 
 The former British colonies include Trinidad and Tobago , whose calypso style is an especially potent part of the music of the other former British colonies , which also share traditions like the Big Drum dance . The French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe share the popular zouk style and have also had extensive musical contact with the music of Haiti , itself once a French colony though not part of the Lesser Antilles . The Dutch colonies of Curaçao , Bonaire and Aruba share the combined rhythm popular style . The islands also share a passion for <unk> , a genre of Surinamese music ; Suriname and its neighbors Guyana and French Guiana share folk and popular styles that are connected enough to the Antilles and other Caribbean islands that both countries are studied in the broader context of Antillean or Caribbean music . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 While Lesser Antillean music is very often discussed as a music area , this division is of limited usefulness . The islands of the Lesser Antilles divide musically along linguistic lines , with the most significant overlap coming from Dominica and Saint Lucia , both primarily Anglophone but strongly influenced by a French colonial past . Because the islands are divided linguistically , the term Antillean music is usually used in reference to one such music area . Thus , for example , the Rough Guide to World Music features a chapter on " Antillean music " , which is entirely about the French Antillean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe , with a brief sidebar specifically about the Dutch Antilles . 
 In the context of Anglophone music , the term Antillean music most commonly refers to Trinidad and Tobago , home to the well @-@ known calypso style . Music author Peter Manuel , for example , treats all the Anglophone islands as a subject of Trinidadian calypso traditions , while using the title Music of the Lesser Antilles for Francophone Antillean music . Manuel also , like many authors , treats Suriname and Guyana as integral aspects of Caribbean music ; due to the Dutch colonial history of both countries , they are often grouped with Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles . 
 Nevertheless , Antillean music can be characterized by the prominence of the Carnival celebration ( prominently from Trinidad and Tobago ) , and the importance of calypso @-@ like song traditions . The Lesser Antilles is also home to a strong Indo @-@ Caribbean population ; though Indo @-@ Caribbean music is found elsewhere in the Caribbean , the prominence of Indian @-@ influenced styles is a hallmark of the Antillean music scenes . Regional forms can also be found outside of the Caribbean entirely , most notably in New York City , where Brooklyn 's Labor Day Carnival features music and parades , mas and steel bands ; this Carnival is distinct to New York , and reflects elements of a pan @-@ Caribbean nature . 
 = = = Calypso and calypso @-@ like traditions = = = 
 Calypso is most closely associated with the island of Trinidad , but it has spread throughout the Lesser Antilles , and abroad . Similar traditions can be found natively on many of Caribbean islands . Within the Antilles , most of the popular calypso stars have come from Trinidad and Tobago ; the majority of the exceptions , such as Arrow from Montserrat , have come from other Anglophone islands . Music author Peter Manuel has argued that , despite the modern Anglophone focus to calypso @-@ like song forms , their origins lie in the " Afro @-@ French creole culture " , and notes that the ancestor of the word calypso , <unk> , was first used to refer to a Martinican singer . 
 The calypso song complex is characterized by satirical , political , risque and humorous lyricism , a competitive and celebratory nature and its function in social organization and informal communication . Jamaican <unk> is perhaps the most well @-@ known form of calypso @-@ like music . The island of Carriacou is home to a calypso @-@ like song style , as well as <unk> feasts , <unk> songs and steel bands , all similar to though distinct from the related Trinidadian traditions . Modern influences from Trinidad have organized the Carriacou song style , and there are competitions similar to calypso tents on the island . The Antiguan <unk> is part of the same song complex , featuring news @-@ oriented and ribald , often satirical lyrics and a rhythmic , uptempo style . 
 = = = Carnival = = = 
 Annual Carnival celebrations are an important part of the culture of all the Lesser Antillean islands . Carnival is celebrated at varying times of year , either pre @-@ Lent , Christmastime or in July and August , and feature a wide variety of dances , songs and parades . Contests are common , especially Calypso King and Queen contests , which are held on most of the British Antillean islands , the U.S. Virgin Islands as well as French Saint Martin and elsewhere . The British Antillean Carnivals are also mostly united by the J <unk> tradition , which involves calypso and soca band parades and are the highlight of their celebrations . 
 Summer Carnivals include those on Antigua , Saint Vincent and the Grenadines , Sint Eustatius , Saint John , Saint Lucia , Grenada , Saba , Nevis and Anguilla , the latter two of which are especially known for popular calypso competitions . Christmastime Carnivals are held on Montserrat , Saint Croix , Saint Martin and Saint Kitts ; Montserrat 's distinctive Carnival includes masquerades and <unk> , and both islands also feature calypso competitions . The Carnival of Sint Maarten , which takes place a month after Easter , is known for the burning of King <unk> @-@ <unk> as the culmination of the festival . Many islands , especially the French and Dutch Antilles , are home to pre @-@ Lenten Carnivals , including Martinique , Aruba , Saint @-@ Barthélemy , Bonaire , Curaçao , Dominica , Saint Thomas and Guadeloupe . 
 = = British Antilles = = 
 There are many popular traditions common to the English @-@ speaking islands of the Lesser Antilles . Calypso , originally an old folk music – based genre from West Africa , is popular throughout the islands ; other popular traditions , like soca originally from Trinidad , are also well known throughout the region . Steel drum ensembles is also found throughout the English @-@ speaking Lesser Antilles ( and abroad ) , especially in Trinidad and Tobago as well as Antigua and Barbuda . The British Antilles also share in certain folk traditions . Eastern Caribbean folk calypso is found throughout the area , as are African @-@ Caribbean religious music styles like the Shango music of Trinidad . Variants of the Big Drum festival occur throughout the Windward Islands , especially in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines . Carnival is an important folk music celebration on all the islands of the Lesser Antilles , and the rest of the Caribbean . 
 Calypso is part of a spectrum of similar folk and popular Caribbean styles that spans <unk> and <unk> , but remains the most prominent genre of Lesser Antillean music . Calypso 's roots are somewhat unclear , but we know it can be traced to 18th @-@ century Trinidad and other Caribbean islands like Saint Lucia . Modern calypso , however , began in the 19th century , a fusion of disparate elements ranging from the masquerade song <unk> , French Creole <unk> and the stick fighting <unk> . Calypso 's early rise was closely connected with the adoption of Carnival by Trinidadian slaves , including <unk> drumming and the music masquerade processions . Popular calypso arose in the early 20th century , with the rise of internationally known calypsonians like Attila the Hun and Roaring <unk> calypso remained popular throughout the Caribbean in the later 20th century , the islands began producing calypso stars . In the 1970s , a calypso variant called soca arose , characterized by a focus on dance rhythms rather than lyricism . Soca has since spread across the Caribbean and abroad . 
 Steel drums are a distinctively Trinidadian ensemble that evolved from improvised percussion instruments used in Carnival processions . By the late 1930s , bamboo tubes , a traditional instrumental , were supplemented by pieces of metal used <unk> ; over time , these metal percussion instruments were pitched to produce as many as twenty @-@ some tones . Steel bands were large orchestras of these drums , and were banned by the British colonial authorities . Nevertheless , steel drums spread across the Caribbean , and are now an entrenched part of the culture of Trinidad and Tobago . 
 Though Trinidadian popular music is by far the most well @-@ known style of Lesser Antillean music , the other Anglophone islands are home to their own musical traditions . Carriacou and Grenada are home to Carnival celebrations that feature distinct form of calypso , <unk> feasts , <unk> stick @-@ fighting songs and the steelband accompanied <unk> , as well as the Big Drum dance , which is also found in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines . Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines share other musics as well including the funereal music of the <unk> rite , a call @-@ and @-@ response form with both European and African lyrics . 
 = = French Antilles = = 
 French Creole music is most famously associated with Martinique and Guadeloupe , though the islands of Saint Lucia and Dominica are also home to French Antillean music . Creole music is characterized by the prominence of the quadrille dance , distinct from the French version and related to the Haitian <unk> . The quadrille is a potent symbol of French Antillean culture . 
 Martinique and Guadeloupe are also home to their own distinct folk traditions , most influentially including <unk> gwo ka and Martinican tambour and tibwa . <unk> ka is a type of percussion music which consists of seven basic rhythms and variations on them . It has been modernized into gwo ka moderne , though traditional rural performances ( <unk> ) are still common . Tambour and ti bwa ensembles are the origin of several important Martinican popular styles , including <unk> bwa and biguine , and also exerted an influence on zouk . Lucian folk music features ensembles of fiddle , cuatro , banjo , guitar and chak @-@ chak ( a rattle ) , with the banjo and cuatro being of iconic importance , and recreational , often lyric song forms called jwé . The French Creole folk music of Dominica is based on the quadrille , accompanied by ensembles called jing ping . Folk storytelling ( kont ) and songs ( bélé ) are also a major part of the country 's musical identity .

 In the 1970s , a wave of Haitian , mostly musicians , to Dominica and the French Antilles ( Guadeloupe and Martinique ) brought with them the kadans , a sophisticated form of music that quickly swept the island and helped unite all the former French colonies of the Caribbean by combining their cultural influences . These Haitians drew upon previous success from mini @-@ jazz artists like Les Gentlemen , Les Leopards , and Les Vikings de Guadeloupe . 
 Later in the decade and into the 1980s , the French Antilles became home to a style of cadence music called cadence @-@ lypso . Gordon Henderson 's Exile One innovated this style , as well as turned the mini @-@ jazz combos into guitar @-@ dominated big bands with full @-@ horn sections and keyboard synthesizers , paving the way for the success of large groups like Grammacks , Experience 7 , among others . Drawing on these influences , the supergroup Kassav ' invented zouk and popularized it with hit songs like " Zouk @-@ La @-@ Se Sel <unk> Nou Ni " . Kassav ' formed from Paris in 1978 .

 Cadence @-@ lypso is the Dominican kadans of the 1970s . The leading figure in the promotion of the Cadence @-@ lypso was the Dominican group Exile One ( based on the island of Guadeloupe ) and Grammacks that featured the Haitian Cadence <unk> or compas with the Trinidadian calypso , hence the name cadence @-@ lypso ; however , most of the bands repertoire was kadans 
 This fusion of kadans and calypso accounts only for a small percentage of the band 's repertoire : Exile One like all Dominica kadans bands featured reggae , calypso and mostly kadans or compas music . 
 The Dominican kadans has evolved under the influence of Dominican and Caribbean / Latin rhythms , as well as rock guitars , soul @-@ style vocals and funk bass and horn styles - music from the United States . By the end of the 1970s , Gordon Henderson defined Cadence @-@ lypso as " a synthesis of Caribbean and African musical patterns fusing the traditional with the contemporary " . It was pushed in the 1970s by groups from Dominica , and was the first style of Dominican music to find international acclaim . 
 Exile One , based in Guadeloupe , is a leading Dominican kadans group of the 1970s that was very influential in the development of caribbean music . The full @-@ horn section kadans band Exile One led by Gordon Henderson was the first to introduce the newly arrived synthesizers to their music that other young cadence or compas bands from Dominica , Haiti ( mini @-@ jazz ) and the French Antilles emulated in the 1970s . Exile One was the most promoted creole band of the Caribbean . The first to sign a production contract with major label Barclay Records . The first to export kadans music to the four corners of the globe : Japan , the Indian Ocean , Africa , North America , Europe , The Cape Verde islands . 
 = = = Zouk = = = 
 The inspiration for Zouk 's style of rhythmic music comes from the Haitian compas , as well as music called cadence @-@ lypso - Dominica cadence popularized by Grammacks and Exile One . Elements of gwo ka , tambour , ti bwa and biguine <unk> are prominent in zouk . Though there are many diverse styles of zouk , some commonalities exist . The French Creole tongue of Martinique and Guadeloupe is an important element , and are a distinctive part of the music . Generally , zouk emphasises star singers , with little attention given to instrumentalists , and performances consist almost entirely of studio recordings . 
 Ethnomusicologist Jocelyn Guilbault believes zouk 's evolution was influenced by other Caribbean styles especially Dominica cadence @-@ lypso , Haitian cadence and Guadeloupean biguine . Zouk arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s , using elements of previous styles of <unk> music , as well as importing other genres . 
 The band Kassav ' remain the best known zouk group . Kassav ' drew in influences from <unk> and bal <unk> dances , biguine 's and mazurka 's , along with more contemporary Caribbean influences like compas , reggae and salsa music . Zouk live shows soon began to draw on American and European rock and heavy metal traditions , and the genre spread across the world , primarily in developing countries . 
 Zouk has diversified into multiple subgenres . These include zouk @-@ love , pop ballads by artists like Edith Lefel and Gilles <unk> , Zouk @-@ R & B , and ragga @-@ zouk bands like Lord <unk> who fused the genre with other influences . 
 = = = Zouk @-@ love = = = 
 Zouk Love is the French Antilles cadence or compas , characterized by a slow , soft and sexual rhythm . The lyrics of the songs often speak of love and sentimental problems . 
 The music <unk> from Angola and <unk> @-@ love from Cape Verde are also derivatives of this French Antillean compas music style , which sounds basically the same , although there are notable differences once you become more familiar with these genres . A main exponent of this subgenre is Ophelia Marie . Other Zouk Love artists come from the French West Indies , the Netherlands , and Africa . 
 Popular artists include French West Indian artists Edith Lefel and Nichols , or like Netherlands based Suzanna <unk> and Gil Semedo , the African artist <unk> . 
 = = = Bouyon = = = 
 Bouyon ( Boo @-@ Yon ) is a form of popular music of Dominica , also known as jump up music in Guadeloupe and Martinique . The best @-@ known band in the genre is Windward Caribbean Kulture ( WCK ) , who originated the style in 1988 by experimenting elements of kadans ( or cadence @-@ lypso ) , lapo kabwit drumming , the folk style jing @-@ ping , and a quick @-@ paced electronic drum pattern . From a language perspective , Bouyon draws on English and Dominican Creole French . More recently , deejays with raggamuffin @-@ style vocals ( bouyon @-@ muffin ) have moved to the fore , updating the sound for the New Generation . 
 Due to the popularity of Triple K International , <unk> , and the New generation of bouyon bands who toured the French Antilles , a popular offshoot of bouyon from Guadeloupe is call bouyon gwada . The jump up had its heyday from the 90s with songs such as Met <unk> WCK , but remained stamped background music or carnival . Over the years , thanks to inter @-@ trade with the Dominicans and the mass participation of Guadeloupe at the World Creole Music Festival , the flagship group as Triple <unk> and MFR band began to democratize and local artists were inducted including the remix Allo Triple <unk> with Daly and " Big Ting Poppin ' Daly alone . 
 A popular offshoot within the bouyon gwada is call bouyon hardcore , a style characterized by its lewd and violent lyrics . Popular Bouyon gwada musicians include , Wee Low , <unk> , Doc J , Yellow <unk> , etc .

 Though zouk is the most well @-@ known form of modern French Antillean music , the island of Martinique has also produced the <unk> bwa and biguine styles , which were especially popular in the early 20th century . <unk> bwa is includes multiple distinctive instruments and internationally famous performers like Claude Germany , Dede Saint @-@ Prix , <unk> and <unk> , while biguine has achieved international fame since the 1920s and has since been modernized and adapted for pop audiences , making it a major influence on zouk . Between the 1930s and 1950s , the dance biguine was popular among the islands ' dance orchestras . The biguine uses a <unk> variant related to that found in other Caribbean genres like <unk> and Compas . In the 1940s and 1950s , these dance bands absorbed influences from Cuban , American and Haitian popular music . 
 = = Dutch Antilles = = 
 The islands of Curaçao , Bonaire , Aruba , Sint Eustatius and Saint Martin share musical styles , as well as maintain their own sets of folk and popular dances , ranging from the impromptu <unk> road block to calypso , zouk and soca . African , indigenous and European ancestry predominate , though more recent immigrants have brought musical styles from Lebanon , China and India . In popular music , the islands are known for the Combined Rhythm , like local favorites the Happy Peanuts and <unk> <unk> i Ambiente . <unk> music from the mainland country Suriname is also popular . Traditional music of Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles , however , is primarily African , characterized by the use of complex , highly developed polyrhythms , dance styles and drums like the <unk> . Other African @-@ derived instruments include metal percussion rods , <unk> , the rasp <unk> , aerophones like the <unk> trumpet , <unk> transverse double @-@ reed wind instrument , and the bow <unk> . 
 The tambu is an instrument , and a form of music and dance found on Aruba , Bonaire ( where it is sometimes known as <unk> ) , and Curaçao . The tambu is an especially important symbol of <unk> identity . Instrumentation for the tambu uses the <unk> , <unk> , triangle , <unk> and other instruments , many of which are also part of the African @-@ derived <unk> di <unk> , or spirit music , of Curaçao . Curaçao 's folk music also includes a rich tradition of work songs with <unk> lyrics sung in <unk> or a <unk> variant called <unk> . The <unk> harvest festival is found across the islands , and features the <unk> trumpet , made from a <unk> . Bonaire 's <unk> festival is also notable for the use of the <unk> , an <unk> made from the stalk of a sorghum plant , and the <unk> , made from a conch shell and known elsewhere as the <unk> . Folk song forms range from the harvest seu , <unk> and <unk> . Other songs were imported beginning in the 19th century , including the South American joropo and <unk> , Spanish Caribbean merengue and other new songs , dances and instruments . This diverse mixture was the origin of the Dutch Antilles ' most distinctive and long @-@ standing popular tradition , the <unk> . 
 The smaller islands of Saint Martin , Saba and Sint Eustatius largely share in the same folk instruments , dances and songs as their neighbors ; however , these islands remain largely unstudied . Saba is home to a vital percussive music tradition , most closely associated with private parties , using instrumentation similar to Curaçao , Bonaire and Aruba . Saint Martin is home to a national dance form called the <unk> , which dates to the 19th century and was only displaced by string bands in the mid @-@ 20th century . Saint Martin is also home to a calypso @-@ like <unk> song form , that remains a major part of the island 's culture .

Guyanese and Trinidadian Indo @-@ Caribbeans developed a tradition that fused elements of calypso with the folk music of North India , a style that was referred to as local music . 
 Indo @-@ Caribbean music plays a vital role in various annual festivals like the springtime <unk> , where <unk> is traditionally performed competitively and in teams . Indo @-@ Caribbean Shia Muslims celebrate <unk> ( Muharram ) with floats accompanied by barrel drums called <unk> .

Tan singing is accompanied by the dholak drum and <unk> , and sometimes includes verbal duels influenced by <unk> . Indo @-@ Caribbean popular music gained international attention in the late 1980s , with the rise of chutney music . Chutney is a dance music , in its modern form accompanied by soca instrumentation , such as synthesizers and pressure drums . This style is called chutney @-@ soca . 
 = Skaters in the Bois de Boulogne = 
 Skaters in the Bois de Boulogne ( French : Les <unk> à Longchamp ) is an oil @-@ on @-@ canvas landscape painting by the French artist Pierre @-@ Auguste Renoir , created during the winter of 1868 . The painting depicts a snowscape with a large number of Parisians , young and old , spending leisure time on a frozen park lake . Due to Renoir 's strong dislike of cold temperatures and snow , the piece is one of his few winter landscapes . 
 = = Background = = 
 Pierre @-@ Auguste Renoir ( 1841 – 1919 ) first met landscape painters Alfred Sisley ( 1839 – 1899 ) , Claude Monet ( 1840 – 1926 ) , and figure painter Frédéric Bazille ( 1841 – 1870 ) at the art studio of Swiss artist Charles <unk> in 1861 . In addition to their friendship , all would prove influential in Renoir 's work . For the next several years , Renoir attended the École des Beaux @-@ Arts . He first exhibited a large painting at the Salon in 1863 , but destroyed his work . That same year , Renoir was living in a studio with Bazille who introduced him to Paul Cézanne ( 1839 – 1906 ) and Camille Pissarro ( 1830 – 1903 ) . 
 An early painting , The Cabaret of Mère Anthony ( 1866 ) , represents for Renoir " some of the most agreeable memories " of his life with friends at a village inn during this time . He soon moved to the village of <unk> near <unk> and the forest of Fontainebleau , and began working with model Lise Tréhot who posed for him between 1866 and 1872 . Renoir began painting at La <unk> , a popular middle class day resort with a floating dance hall , in late 1868 . Like Monet and several other Impressionists , Renoir worked en plein air , painting outdoors , but unlike Monet , who was known for painting in the cold and snow , Renoir was not fond of cold temperatures . Years later , he told art dealer Ambroise Vollard that he could not stand the cold : " But then , even if you can stand the cold , why paint snow ? It is a blight on the face of Nature . " Although it is unknown when his symptoms began , Renoir was known to suffer from rheumatoid arthritis from at least 1892 onward , an affliction which would severely restrict his artistic production in late life . 
 = = Description = = 
 Renoir , who was then 26 years old , painted Skaters in the Bois de Boulogne in the public park of Bois de Boulogne in Paris en plein air during the cold winter month of January 1868 . Newspaper accounts of the time recorded freezing temperatures allowing people to walk across the Seine and ice skate on rivers and streams . Due to Renoir 's dislike of cold temperatures , it is one of the few winter landscapes he completed aside from a few minor studies . At the time of the painting , the park itself was relatively new , with construction beginning in 1852 under a public works program led by Georges @-@ Eugène Haussmann under the direction of Napoleon III . Under Haussmann 's renovation of Paris , the Bois de Boulogne was completed in 1858 . 
 The scene is thought to have been painted near the Lac pour le <unk> ( Skating Lake ) , an artificial lake . Renoir chose the park because he preferred painting crowds . The painting has an unfinished , sketch @-@ like quality to it , in the style of a <unk> , but the brushwork is bold and the composition fully realized . The scene represents the western part of the park , using an elevated perspective . The theme evokes older Dutch ice skating landscapes made popular by painters like Hendrick <unk> ( 1585 – 1634 ) . Several dogs can be seen in the work , reflecting Renoir 's thematic interest in the lives of the Parisian bourgeoisie . The motif of social leisure depicted in the piece would come to define Renoir 's subsequent work . 
 = = Other work = = 
 There are at least four known snowscapes by Renoir : Skaters in the Bois de Boulogne ( 1868 ) ; Winter Landscape ( 1868 ) ; Snowy Landscape ( 1870 – 75 ) ; and another work also titled Snowy Landscape ( 1875 ) . Along with Skaters in the Bois de Boulogne , Renoir would return to the imagery of the Bois de Boulogne years later with a large painting called The Morning Ride ( 1873 ) , alternatively titled Madame Henriette <unk> , which was rejected by the Salon in that year .

 = SS West Nohno = 
 SS West Nohno was a cargo ship for the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) launched shortly after the end of World War I. The ship was inspected by the United States Navy for possible use as USS West Nohno ( ID @-@ 4029 ) but was neither taken into the Navy nor ever commissioned under that name . 
 West Nohno was built in 1919 for the USSB , as a part of the West ships , a series of steel @-@ hulled cargo ships built on the West Coast of the United States for the World War I war effort , and was the 24th ship built at Northwest Steel in Portland , Oregon . Completed too late for that conflict , she operated for a number of years as a merchant ship sailing to African ports for the American West African Line . 
 In November 1941 , West Nohno became the first American merchant ship to be armed prior to the United States ' entry into World War II . Shortly after the U.S. entry to that conflict , she was employed for one roundtrip to the Soviet Union in March 1942 . After her return , she sailed mainly between the United States and United Kingdom ports . In 1943 , a civilian crewman aboard West Nohno was convicted of sedition for trying to incite a rebellion among members of the ship 's crew and Naval Armed Guard . In February 1944 , she sailed from the United States for the final time , and was scuttled in June as part of the " gooseberry " breakwater off Utah Beach during the Normandy invasion , earning a battle star for the ship . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 The West ships were cargo ships of similar size and design built by several shipyards on the West Coast of the United States for the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) for emergency use during World War I. All were given names that began with the word West , like West Nohno , the one of some 40 West ships built by the Northwest Steel of Portland , Oregon . West Nohno ( Northwest Steel yard number 24 , USSB hull number 1080 ) was launched 12 February 1919 and completed in May 1919 . 
 West Nohno was 6 @,@ 186 gross register tons ( GRT ) , and was 409 feet 9 inches ( 124 @.@ 89 m ) long ( between perpendiculars ) and 54 feet 2 inches ( 16 @.@ 51 m ) abeam . She had a steel hull and had a deadweight tonnage of 8 @,@ 580 DWT . Sources do not give West Nohno 's other hull characteristics , but West Cheswald , a sister ship also built at Northwest Steel had a displacement of 12 @,@ 200 t with a mean draft of 24 feet 1 inch ( 7 @.@ 34 m ) , and a hold 29 feet 9 inches ( 9 @.@ 07 m ) deep . West Nohno power plant consisted of a single steam turbine that drove a single screw propeller , which moved the ship at up to 11 @.@ 5 knots ( 21 @.@ 3 km / h ) . 
 = = Early career = = 
 West Nohno was inspected by the United States Navy after completion for possible use and was assigned the identification number of 4029 . Had she been commissioned , she would have been known as USS West Nohno ( ID @-@ 4029 ) , but the Navy neither took over the ship nor commissioned her . 
 Information on West Nohno 's early career is incomplete , but through the end of 1920 the cargo ship sailed on a New York – Glasgow route . By early 1922 , West Nohno was sailing for the USSB @-@ owned American West African Line . The principal ports visited by American West African ships were Dakar , Freetown , Monrovia , and Lagos . News items reported that West Nohno also visited <unk> , Accra , Las Palmas , Grand @-@ Bassam , <unk> , and Saint Vincent . West Nohno was still on African routes as late as 1928 , when the USSB began accepting bids for the purchase of the American West African Line . 
 From 1928 to 1941 , little is known about West Nohno 's activities . At some point during this period , she was laid up as part of a reserve fleet , in which she remained as late as 1939 . By May 1941 , now under ownership of the United States Maritime Commission ( USMC ) ( a successor to the USSB ) , the ship had been reactivated and was scheduled to sail in Red Sea service under the operation of American Export Lines . In this Red Sea service , ships would carry materiel for the British to Red Sea and Gulf of Aden ports and carry strategic materials needed by the United States on return journeys . 
 = = World War II = = 
 When amendments to the U.S. Neutrality Acts in late 1941 allowed United States merchant ships to be armed for service in the Atlantic , West Nohno became the first vessel so equipped when a large deck gun and three anti @-@ aircraft gun emplacements were installed by workers at the Tietjen & Lang Drydock in Hoboken , New Jersey in late November . Navy officials , citing secrecy concerns , would not reveal the size of the gun , but allowed that the bore was between 3 and 6 inches ( 76 and 152 mm ) . While at the shipyard , West Nohno 's wheelhouse and radio shack were reinforced with thick walls of concrete to protect against machine @-@ gun bullets , and the ship was repainted " battleship gray " . 
 After her guns were installed , West Nohno had made her way to Sydney , Nova Scotia , by 27 December when she sailed as a part of transatlantic Convoy SC 86 . With her destination set for Murmansk , West Nohno peeled off from the convoy and headed to Reykjavík , Iceland . While at anchor in Iceland , West Nohno experienced a winter storm from 15 to 19 January 1942 . On 15 January , the storm , packing winds of 80 knots ( 150 km / h ) and gusts of up to 100 knots ( 190 km / h ) , drove West Nohno into USS Wichita , damaging the heavy cruiser . Apparently suffering no major damage herself in the collision , West Nohno joined Arctic convoy PQ 9 , which sailed on 1 February and arrived at Murmansk nine days later . Though the convoy had arrived at its destination , the danger of German attack was still present . The nearest German airfield was 35 miles ( 56 km ) away — about 7 to 10 minutes flying time — which gave almost no advance warning of air raids . German dive bombers would silently glide in below Soviet anti @-@ aircraft fire , drop their payloads , and fly away . Despite the fact that Murmansk had limited port facilities and typically slow unloading of cargo , sometimes requiring ships to remain in port for weeks or months , West Nohno was ready to sail in Convoy QP 8 on 1 March , returning to Reykjavik on 11 March . She sailed for Halifax eleven days later and arrived on 7 April . 
 West Nohno had made her way to Hampton Roads , Virginia , by 29 May , when she sailed for Key West , Florida . After her 4 June arrival at Key West , she began a nine @-@ month journey to Alexandria , Cairo , and other ports . During this extended voyage , three crewmen entered one of West Nohno 's fuel tanks to clean it while the ship was at Suez on 29 September 1942 . The crewmen did not use gas masks and were soon overcome by fumes . The second mate of the Norwegian tanker Britannia , Henning Vaagsnes , entered the tank and removed all three men . Two of West Nohno 's men survived but the third , despite two hours of attempts to revive him by Vaagsnes , did not . For his efforts , Vaagsnes received a pair of binoculars from U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt and a gold watch from the ship owners . He was also awarded St. Olav 's medal with Oak Branch , a medal awarded for personal courage and bravery by the Norwegian government . 
 In February 1943 , the West Nohno completed her nine @-@ month journey when she arrived at Mobile , Alabama , after sailing via Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , and Key West . The Chicago Daily Tribune reported that during this voyage , seaman James Orville Couchois had incited subordination and disloyalty among the crew . The head of the Naval Armed Guard detachment aboard West Nohno reported Couchois ' activities , as well as comments from other crew members on the ship . After the ship had docked at Mobile , Couchois was removed from the ship and ultimately faced a trial for sedition . Couchois , who was the deck manager for the National Maritime Union of the Congress of Industrial Organizations , was convicted and sentenced to a prison term of five years . 
 In late March , West Nohno began the first of three Boston – Liverpool round trips . On the Halifax – Liverpool leg of this first trip , she had some unspecified problem that required her return to Halifax , but it must have been a minor problem since she sailed again for Liverpool a week later . The cargo ship returned to Boston on 3 June and began her second voyage to Liverpool on 30 June . While in the UK she called at Loch Ewe , Methil , and Oban in July and August before her 6 September return to Boston . Her third journey was an extended one that began by sailing from Boston on 3 October . She arrived at Liverpool three weeks later . During the next seven weeks , she made her way to Milford Haven , from which she began her last westbound transatlantic crossing on 13 December . West Nohno arrived in Boston on 5 January 1944 . 
 = = Final voyage = = 
 West Nohno had been selected to become one of the blockships for the Allied invasion of France , then in the planning stages . Though the specific modifications performed on West Nohno are not revealed in sources , modifications for other ships do appear . In November 1944 , The Christian Science Monitor reported that blockships dispatched from Boston , like West Nohno , had been loaded with " tons of sand and cement " and had been rigged with explosive charges before departing the port . Further , existing antiaircraft weapons had been moved higher up on the ship and supplemented by additional guns . An account by Cesar Poropat , chief engineer aboard West Honaker , another blockship dispatched from Boston , mentions that transverse bulkheads aboard that ship were cut open to facilitate sinking . 
 West Nohno departed Boston on 24 February and arrived at Halifax two days later . Departing from that port on 29 February , she sailed in Convoy HX @-@ 281 and arrived at Milford Haven on 15 March . She departed there for Portsmouth the same day . West Nohno 's whereabouts and movements through early June are not recorded . Other ships that had been selected as blockships assembled in a " corncob " fleet at Oban , though it 's not clear if West Nohno did or not . The " corncob " fleet was the group of ships intended to be sunk to form the " gooseberries " , shallow @-@ water artificial harbors for landing craft . Poropat reports that once the ship crews were told of their mission while anchored at Oban , they were not permitted to leave the ships . 
 Three " corncob " convoys , consisting of what one author called the " dregs of the North Atlantic shipping pool " , departed from Poole and reached the Normandy beachhead the next day , shortly after the D @-@ Day landings . Poropat reports that the corncob ships traveled under cover of darkness and , stripped of all unnecessary equipment , carried no radios , having only a signal lamp ( with a spare bulb ) for communication . Once at the designated location , the ships were put into position and scuttled over the next days , under heavy German artillery fire . Naval Armed Guardsmen manned the guns on all the gooseberry ships to protect against frequent German air attacks ; West Nohno 's gunners assisted in shooting down several planes on 10 June . All the while , harbor pilots — about half of the New York Bar Pilots Association , according to one source — carefully positioned the ships . West Nohno and West Cheswald were the last two ships sunk off Utah Beach when they went down on 11 June . Even though she had been sunk , West Nohno continued to serve as an antiaircraft platform manned by Navy gun crews until 18 June , and by Army crews after that date . West Nohno 's naval gunners were awarded a battle star for participation in the Normandy Landings . 
 = Alma @-@ class ironclad = 
 The Alma @-@ class ironclads were a group of seven wooden @-@ hulled , armored corvettes built for the French Navy in the mid to late 1860s . Three of the ships attempted to blockade Prussian ports in the Baltic Sea in 1870 during the Franco @-@ Prussian War . Three others patrolled the North Sea and the Atlantic , while the last ship was en route to Japan when the war began and blockaded two small Prussian ships in a Japanese harbor . Afterwards they alternated periods of reserve and active commissions , many of them abroad . Three of the ships participated in the French occupation of Tunisia in 1881 while another helped to intimidate the Vietnamese Government into accepting status as a French protectorate and played a small role in the Sino @-@ French War of 1884 – 85 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The Alma @-@ class ironclads were designed by Henri Dupuy de Lôme as improved versions of the armored corvette Belliqueuse suitable for foreign deployments . Unlike their predecessor the ships were true central battery ironclads as they were fitted with armored transverse bulkheads . The original plan for these ships was to have a two @-@ deck battery with four 194 @-@ millimeter ( 7 @.@ 6 in ) guns on the battery deck and four 164 @-@ millimeter ( 6 @.@ 5 in ) guns mounted above them on the upper deck , one gun at each corner of the battery . This design was changed to substitute four barbettes for the upper battery , but the addition of armored bulkheads proved to be very heavy and the rear pair of barbettes had to be deleted to save weight . In partial compensation the 164 @-@ millimeter guns in the remaining forward barbettes were replaced by an additional pair of 194 @-@ millimeter guns . Like most ironclads of their era they were equipped with a metal @-@ reinforced ram . 
 The ships were built from the same general plan , but differed amongst themselves . They measured 68 @.@ 75 – 69 @.@ 03 meters ( 225 @.@ 6 – 226 @.@ 5 ft ) between perpendiculars , with a beam of 13 @.@ 94 – 14 @.@ 13 meters ( 45 @.@ 7 – 46 @.@ 4 ft ) . The ships had a mean draft of 6 @.@ 26 – 6 @.@ 66 meters ( 20 @.@ 5 – 21 @.@ 9 ft ) and displaced 3 @,@ 569 – 3 @,@ 889 metric tons ( 3 @,@ 513 – 3 @,@ 828 long tons ) . Their crew numbered 316 officers and men .

 During the Franco @-@ Prussian War of 1870 – 71 Thétis , Jeanne d 'Arc and Armide were assigned to the Northern Squadron that attempted to blockade Prussian ports on the Baltic until ordered to return to Cherbourg on 16 September 1870 . Montcalm , Atalante , and Reine Blanche cruised the North Sea and Montcalm later watched a Prussian corvette in Portuguese waters . Alma was en route to the Far East when the war began and she blockaded a pair of Prussian corvettes in Yokohama harbor once she arrived at Japan . 
 After the end of the war many of the ships were placed in reserve or sent to foreign stations , often as the flagship . During the Third Carlist War of 1872 – 76 Thétis , Reine Blanche and Jeanne d 'Arc spent time in Spanish waters where they could protect French citizens and interests . In 1875 the latter ship rammed and sank the dispatch vessel <unk> . On 3 July 1877 Thétis rammed Reine Blanche who had to be run ashore to prevent her from sinking . 
 Further abroad Reine Blanche and Alma bombarded the Tunisian port of Sfax in July 1881 as part of the French occupation of Tunisia . Atalante participated in the Battle of Thuan An in August 1883 . This was an attack by the French on the forts defending the mouth of the Perfume River , leading to the Vietnamese capital of Huế in an attempt to intimidate the Vietnamese government . During the Sino @-@ French War of 1884 – 85 the ship was in Huế in early September 1884 , but she carried Admiral Amédée Courbet to Keelung , Taiwan on 23 September .

 The 133rd Boat Race took place on 29 March 1987 . Held annually , the Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . Oxford won by four lengths . The race featured the tallest , heaviest , youngest and oldest crew members in the event 's history . 
 Oxford 's crew rebelled in the prelude to the race , with several American rowers and the cox leaving the squad in February after their coach Dan Topolski removed their compatriot Chris Clark from the crew , replacing him with Scottish rower Donald Macdonald . The rebels were replaced in the main by the reserves . Umpired by former Oxford Blue Colin Moynihan , it was the first year that the race was sponsored by Beefeater Gin , replacing Ladbrokes after ten years . 
 In the 23rd reserve race , Cambridge 's Goldie defeated Oxford 's Isis by one length . Cambridge won the 42nd Women 's Boat Race .

 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " and the " Light Blues " respectively ) . First held in 1829 , the race takes place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and is followed throughout the United Kingdom ; the races are broadcast worldwide . Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1986 race by seven lengths , and led overall with 69 victories to Oxford 's 62 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . The 1987 race was the first race to be sponsored by Beefeater Gin . 
 The first Women 's Boat Race took place in 1927 , but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s . Up until 2014 , the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races , but as of the 2015 race , it is held on the River Thames , on the same day as the men 's main and reserve races . The reserve race , contested between Oxford 's Isis boat and Cambridge 's Goldie boat has been held since 1965 . It usually takes place on the Tideway , prior to the main Boat Race .

 Following defeat in the previous year 's race , Oxford 's first in eleven years , American Chris Clark was determined to gain revenge : " Next year we 're gonna kick ass ... Cambridge 's ass . Even if I have to go home and bring the whole US squad with me . " He recruited another four American post @-@ graduates : three international @-@ class rowers ( Dan Lyons , Chris Huntington and Chris Penney ) and a cox ( Jonathan Fish ) , in an attempt to put together the fastest Boat Race crew in the history of the contest . 
 Disagreements over the training regime of Dan Topolski , the Oxford coach , ( " He wanted us to spend more time training on land than water ! " lamented Lyons ) led to the crew walking out on at least one occasion , and resulted in the coach revising his approach . A fitness test between Clark and Scottish former Blue Donald Macdonald ( in which the American triumphed ) resulted in a call for the Scotsman 's removal ; it was accompanied with a threat that the Americans would refuse to row should Macdonald remain in the crew . As boat club president , Macdonald " had absolute power over selection " and after announcing that Clark would row on starboard , his weaker side , Macdonald would row on the port side and Briton Tony Ward was to be dropped from the crew entirely , the American contingent mutinied . After considerable negotiation and debate , much of it conducted in the public eye , Clark , Penny , Huntington , Lyons and Fish were dropped and replaced by members of Oxford 's reserve crew , Isis . 
 = = Crews = = 
 Oxford 's crew weighed an average of nearly 9 pounds ( 4 @.@ 1 kg ) a rower more than their opponents . The race featured the tallest and heaviest ( Oxford 's stroke Gavin Stewart ) , youngest ( Cambridge 's Matthew Brittin ) and oldest ( Oxford 's president Donald Macdonald ) crew members in the event 's history . The Cambridge boat saw four returning Blues while Oxford welcomed back just one , in Macdonald . Oxford 's coach was Topolski , his counterpart was Alan Inns .

 With a more experienced crew and less disruption in the preparation for the race , Cambridge were considered favourites . Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Middlesex station . A malfunction to umpire Colin Moynihan 's barge caused a delay to the start ; as a consequence the crews avoided racing in a lightning storm . Straight from the start , Oxford steered towards Middlesex to seek shelter from the inclement weather . Cambridge eventually followed , taking on water , and receiving warnings for encroaching into Oxford 's water . Almost a length ahead by Craven Cottage , Oxford steered across and in front of Cambridge to control the race before the Mile Post . A seven @-@ second advantage at Hammersmith Bridge became twelve seconds by Barnes Bridge and remained so by the finishing post , with Oxford winning by four lengths in a time of 19 minutes 59 seconds . 
 In the reserve race , Cambridge 's Goldie beat Oxford 's Isis by one length , their first victory in three years . Cambridge won the 42nd Women 's Boat Race , their fourth victory in six years .

 Oxford 's Macdonald was triumphant : " It was a fairy @-@ tale . " Topolski acknowledged his crew 's luck in winning the toss combined with the conditions : " We had been praying for rough water . " He also appeared conciliatory : " I wish the Americans had been there . It has nothing to do with vindication . We just won the race , that 's all . " Cadoux @-@ Hudson said , " I thought Cambridge would murder us but we took 20 colossal strokes and there was a primeval scream from the crew . There was a huge release . "

 In 1989 Topolski and author Patrick Robinson 's book about the events , True Blue : The Oxford Boat Race Mutiny , was published . Seven years later , a film based on the book was released . Alison Gill , the then @-@ president of the Oxford University Women 's Boat Club wrote The Yanks in Oxford , in which she defended the Americans and claimed Topolski wrote True Blue in order to justify his own actions . The journalist Christopher Dodd described True Blue as " particularly offensive " . 
 Oxford 's stroke Gavin Stewart , writing in The Times in 1996 , had chosen to mutiny because " Macdonald as president had lost the respect of the squad and the selection system had lost credibility " . In 2003 , Clark had " broken his silence " , stating " Mutiny is such a loaded term ... Rebellion would be a more apt description . On the face of it , I have no regrets whatsoever . However , I now lament my own personal maturity level . In hindsight my <unk> had the effect of exacerbating a complicated but manageable situation . " On the twentieth anniversary of the race , Topolski insisted " It was just a selection dispute , an argument which every club in every sport has from time to time . The media just took the story and hyped it up . " 
 = Pokémon , I Choose You ! = 
 " Pokémon - I Choose You ! " ( <unk> ！ <unk> ！ , Pokémon ! Kimi ni <unk> ! ) is the first episode of the first season of the Pokémon anime series . It was first broadcast in Japan on April 1 , 1997 and was first broadcast in the United States on September 8 , 1998 . 
 In the episode , Ash Ketchum gets his Pokémon journey off to a rough start when he receives his first Pokémon , the reluctant Pikachu . After many failed attempts at capturing some Pokémon , Ash throws a rock at a Spearow , which gets angry and starts attacking Ash and Pikachu . Soon , an entire flock of Spearow start chasing them , and Pikachu is the only one who is able to step in and stop the flock . 
 Nintendo , which publishes the Pokémon video games , asked for changes to be made to the English adaptation of the episode . Some graphic sequences involving punching were taken out , including one where Misty slaps Ash on the cheek . The script was translated by Paul Taylor . Veronica Taylor , who provided the English voice of Ash in this episode , said she enjoyed the script and recording Ash 's lines . 
 Since airing , the episode has received negative reviews from television critics . Andrew Wood of The Plain Dealer praised the episode for staying true to the games , but thought it focused too much on the character Ash . A children 's book adaptation of " Pokémon - I Choose You ! " was released in July 1999 , and the episode was released on Game Boy Advance Video in 2004 .

 Ash Ketchum is about to receive his very first Pokémon from Professor Oak . At the age of ten , boys and girls like Ash can get the license to become Pokémon trainers . On the day he is supposed to get his first Pokémon , Ash accidentally breaks his alarm clock and <unk> . When he wakes up , he runs in his pajamas to Professor Oak 's laboratory , but when Ash enters to receive his Pokémon , he is told that all three starter Pokémon have already been taken . Ash pleads for one and Oak replies that he still has one left , but there is a slight problem with it . Ash does not care and receives the Pokémon , which turns out to be the electric @-@ type Pokémon Pikachu . Ash thinks that it is cute , but it gives him an electric shock when he picks it up to hug it . Oak gives Ash a Pokédex and six Poké Balls before he heads out on his journey to become the greatest Pokémon trainer of all time . 
 As Ash carries the reluctant Pikachu , he hopes that they can be friends , but Pikachu acts aloof and openly shows his distrust of Ash . Just then , a Pidgey flies by and Ash unsuccessfully tries to catch it by throwing his Poké Ball . Ash uses his Pokédex and finds out that in order to catch a Pokémon , a trainer must first use their Pokémon to battle it , thereby weakening it , to be caught by a Poké Ball . With Pikachu being uncooperative , Ash tries to fight the Pidgey himself , but is easily beaten , much to the amusement of Pikachu . Frustrated , Ash throws a rock at what he believes is the Pidgey . However , it turns out to be a Spearow , which starts attacking Pikachu and Ash . Pikachu shocks Spearow , and in the process alerts a whole flock . Ash grabs Pikachu and dives down a waterfall in order to escape from the flock of Spearow , and the two are fished out by a young girl named Misty , who tells Ash to take the injured Pikachu to the Pokémon Center in Viridian City . Seeing the Spearow flock approaching , Ash escapes with Pikachu by " borrowing " Misty 's bike .

 " Pokémon - I Choose You ! " was the first episode of the Pokémon anime to be made and aired in Japan . The episode was written by Shoji <unk> , and directed by Masamitsu Hidaka . When the production staff started on the anime , they wanted a specific character to focus on . They chose Pikachu because it was relatively popular compared with the other Pokémon and the staff thought that " potentially both boys and girls would like it " . The episode was animated by Shogakukan in Japan , and it was aimed at elementary school students .

 Just before 4Kids Entertainment revealed that they were planning on producing an English adaptation dub of the anime in the United States , the episode " Dennō Senshi Porygon " caused controversy when it aired in Japan on December 16 , 1997 . In the episode , there was a scene with a huge explosion that flashed red and blue lights . At this point , viewers started to complain of blurred vision , headaches , dizziness , seizures , blindness , and lost consciousness . A total of 685 viewers were taken to hospitals by ambulances . Alfred R. Kahn , chief executive of 4Kids Entertainment , announced on January 1 , 1998 , that the anime would be edited for the American market . Many American parents worried about the safety of their children now that the anime would air in the United States , but Kahn said : " We 're confident it won 't be a problem . [ ... ] We 've taken the problem seriously and fixed it . " 
 Nintendo asked for changes to be made to the original Japanese show in the English adaptation . " We tried not to have violence or sexual discrimination or religious scenes in the United States , " said Masakazu Kubo , executive producer of Shogakukan . Some graphic sequences involving punching were taken out , including one from " Pokémon , I Choose You ! " where Misty slaps Ash on the cheek . The names of the characters and monsters were Westernized : Satoshi became Ash , and Shigeru became Gary , and the Pokémon were given descriptive names . For example , of the three starter Pokémon , <unk> , a salamander with a ball of fire on its tail , became Charmander ; <unk> , a dinosaur with a green garlic bulb on its back , became Bulbasaur ; and <unk> , a turtle who squirts water , became Squirtle .

 Veronica Taylor , who provided the voice of Ash in this episode and all episodes from season one to eight , said that recording Ash 's lines for the episode was " really great " for her . " Playing a 10 @-@ year @-@ old boy with that energy and excitement , and the battles that he 's in , and his low , husky voice was really terrific , " she said . 
 I really enjoy playing [ Ash ] and he ’ s really a great character , [ ... ] but I feel that after the first ten episodes everything has kind of loosened up . The script 's loosened up , the characters were able to come into their own a bit more , and I think everyone has relaxed a bit ; we 're able to play with it more , whereas in the first ten episodes , I think it was so new , and everyone was trying to make sure it was done right . I enjoy playing him now much more than I did in the very beginning because I can have fun with him more , and we know him and can work out how he really would react . 
 Taylor explained the process of recording an episode in an interview with Animerica Magazine ; first , the script is translated from Japanese into English , it is then adapted to fit the lip flap ( movement of the mouth ) . Taylor said that she is the only one in the recording booth when she works , as they record each voice separately throughout each episode . Taylor added that she is often the first one to record so she has to imagine how the previous line would be said . " Luckily , I work with a great director who helps with the interpretation of the line , matching of the lip flap , and consistency of the voice , " she said .

 The episode first aired in the United States on September 8 , 1998 . Since then , it has received mixed to positive reviews from television critics . Andrew Wood of The Plain Dealer had mixed feelings for the episode , stating the episode did a good job of setting up the world of Pokémon , and that it was faithful to the game . However , Wood thought it was " apparent " in this episode that without a traveling partner , " Ash just isn 't all that interesting " . Andrew Tei of Mania.com said that " one great thing about listening to early dubs is how the voice actors haven 't completely gotten into their roles yet . Ash 's and James ' voices are much deeper than where they end up at . " Louis Bedigian of GameZone believed the best moment of the episode to be the Pokémon battle on television at the beginning , stating that " the Pokémon battle side @-@ to @-@ side in black and white .

 = Jack Hobbs = 
 Sir John Berry " Jack " Hobbs ( 16 December 1882 – 21 December 1963 ) was an English professional cricketer who played for Surrey from 1905 to 1934 and for England in 61 Test matches between 1908 and 1930 . Known as " The Master " , he is regarded by critics as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket . He is the leading run @-@ scorer and century @-@ maker in first @-@ class cricket , with 61 @,@ 760 runs and 199 centuries . A right @-@ handed batsman and an occasional right @-@ arm medium pace bowler , Hobbs also excelled as a fielder , particularly in the position of cover point . 
 Born into poverty in 1882 , Hobbs wished from an early age to pursue a career in cricket . His early batting was undistinguished , but a sudden improvement in 1901 brought him to the attention of local teams . In 1903 he successfully applied to join Surrey , with the support of England batsman Tom Hayward . His reputation grew and when he qualified to play for Surrey , he scored 88 on his first @-@ class debut and a century in his next game . Over the following seasons , he established himself as a successful county player and in 1908 made his Test debut for England , scoring 83 in his first innings . After some mixed early performances for England , Hobbs ' success against South African googly bowlers made his place secure , and by 1911 – 12 , when he scored three centuries in the Test series against Australia , critics judged him the world 's best batsman . In county cricket , he developed an attacking , dynamic style of play and was very successful up until 1914 . After serving in the Royal Flying Corps during the First World War , he maintained his reputation when cricket resumed in 1919 , but his career was threatened by appendicitis , which caused him to miss most of the 1921 season . When he returned , he was a more cautious batsmen and used a safer style of play . Subsequently , he became more consistent and scored prolifically in both Test and domestic cricket until his retirement . In this period , he played some of his most acclaimed innings . 
 Hobbs ' success was based on fast footwork , an ability to play many different shots , and excellent placement of the ball . Among the first batsmen to succeed against previously devastating googly bowlers , he adapted his technique to meet the new styles of bowling that arose early in his career ; he mixed classical shots with an effective defence . He was particularly successful on difficult pitches for batting . An opening batsman , Hobbs established several effective opening partnerships ; with Tom Hayward and Andy Sandham for Surrey and with Wilfred Rhodes and Herbert Sutcliffe for England . His partnership with Sutcliffe remains in 2016 the most effective for the first wicket , in terms of average partnership , in Test history . Contemporaries rated Hobbs extremely highly , and critics continue to list him among the best batsmen of all time . 
 Hobbs was very close to Ada , his wife of 56 years ; the pair were able to live comfortably in later life through Hobbs ' substantial wage from Surrey , his commercial endorsements , and the proceeds of the sporting goods shop he opened in 1921 and ran for the rest of his life . After his cricketing retirement , he also worked in journalism . Knighted in 1953 , the first professional cricketer to be so honoured , he spent his later years nursing his wife . He died , aged 81 , a few months after her in 1963 .

 = = = Childhood and early cricket = = = 
 Hobbs was born in Cambridge on 16 December 1882 , the first of 12 children to John Cooper Hobbs , a <unk> , and his wife Flora Matilda Berry . Hobbs was raised in a poor , run @-@ down area of the city , and he spent most of his childhood in near @-@ poverty . Hobbs senior , a lover of cricket , changed his career to become a professional cricketer , and in 1889 was appointed groundsman and umpire at Jesus College . 
 From an early age , Hobbs played cricket whenever he could . His first games were played in the streets near his house . He was educated at a primary school affiliated with his local Anglican church , St Matthew 's , and moved in 1891 to York Street Boys ' School , a fee @-@ paying establishment ; Hobbs later admitted to being a poor scholar but was successful at sports . He played cricket regularly for the St Matthew 's choir team and the York Street school team , and during holidays helped his father at Jesus College . In his final year at York Street , to supplement the family budget , Hobbs took a job working before school hours in the domestic service of a private house . On leaving school in 1895 , he worked as an errand boy until his father 's connections at the university secured him a summer job as a college servant , chiefly assisting the cricket team . Aged 16 , Hobbs became an apprentice gas fitter , and practised cricket on Parker 's Piece , an open area of common land in Cambridge , in his spare time . He played for various local clubs but did not initially stand out as a cricketer : although better than most other Cambridge batsmen , no coaches or major teams approached him , and his batting gave little indication of the success which came later . 
 Hobbs ' breakthrough came in 1901 . His batting improved throughout the season , during which he scored 102 for Ainsworth against the Cambridge Liberals , his first century . At the end of the season , he was included in a Cambridge XI , a team chosen from the best local cricketers , to play a prestigious match against a team of professional cricketers brought by the Cambridge @-@ born Surrey cricketer Tom Hayward . Hobbs ' overall record was unremarkable , but at the end of the season he was invited to play as an amateur for Cambridgeshire ; he achieved little in his appearances . 
 Early in 1902 , Hobbs was appointed as assistant to the professional cricket coach at Bedford School , working as a groundsman and bowling in the nets . In late August , he returned to Cambridge to play as a professional for the first time . For a fee of ten shillings , Hobbs appeared for a team from the nearby town of Royston against Hertfordshire Club and Ground and scored 119 runs . His success delighted his family and made him a local celebrity . Hobbs ' father , who had helped to arrange his appearance in the match , died from pneumonia a week later . Despite local fund @-@ raising efforts for the bereaved family , Hobbs senior 's death left his wife and children facing great financial hardship . Francis Hutt , a former friend and colleague of the father , contacted Essex County Cricket Club to request a trial for Hobbs . That county never replied — Hobbs later scored his maiden first @-@ class century against them — but Hutt was more successful when he asked Hayward to look at Hobbs with a view to recommending him to Surrey . Consequently , in late 1902 , Hobbs batted on Parker 's Piece against Hayward and Bill Reeves , an Essex cricketer born in Cambridge , impressing Hayward in the process . In the winter of 1902 – 03 Hobbs assumed his father 's duties as groundsman at Jesus College . 
 = = = Surrey cricketer = = = 
 Hobbs was summoned to Surrey for a trial in April 1903 , and subsequently offered a contract with the ground staff at the Oval on a basic wage during the season of 30 shillings a week . Hobbs could not immediately play for Surrey owing to the qualification rules in place at the time for the County Championship — a player had to be born in a county or to have lived there for two years in order to represent it . To achieve qualification , he moved to the Surrey area of London . Around this time he played football for local teams as a forward with some success , but struggled financially during the winter months and found it hard to find employment . 
 While qualifying , Hobbs played for Surrey 's Colts side and for the Club and Ground Eleven , both of which were teams for young cricketers . Although he made some substantial scores , according to his biographer , Leo McKinstry , " just as he had done for much of his early life , [ Hobbs ] performed satisfactorily without doing anything startling " . In the 1903 season he scored 480 runs at an average of 34 @.@ 29 , as well as taking 19 wickets as his bowling improved . The following season , Hobbs played only for the Club and Ground , increased his average to 43 @.@ 90 , and impressed people connected with the Surrey county side . His sudden improvement brought about a temporary return to the Cambridgeshire team , for which he remained qualified by birth . His batting was praised , particularly when he scored 195 and 129 in two matches against Hertfordshire . In total , he scored 696 runs in 13 innings for Cambridgeshire , averaging 58 @.@ 00 . 
 = = First @-@ class cricketer = = 
 By the start of the 1905 season , Hobbs had qualified for Surrey and was already being noted as a player of promise . At the time , Surrey needed an opening batsman to partner Tom Hayward . Although Hobbs had rarely opened the batting , he was selected as Hayward 's opening partner for Surrey 's first game of the season . He made his debut on 24 April 1905 against a team representing the " Gentlemen of England " ; after scoring 18 runs in the first innings , he scored a rapid 88 in the second before rain ensured the match was drawn . The Surrey team and committee were impressed , and Hobbs retained his place for the club 's opening County Championship match against Essex . When he scored 155 runs in around three hours during Surrey 's second innings , the Surrey captain Lord Dalmeny awarded Hobbs his County Cap . Over the following weeks , Hobbs scored consistently , hitting another century against Essex and 94 runs against the touring Australian cricket team . But a combination of fatigue from continuous cricket and the pressure of first @-@ class cricket adversely affected his form , and he struggled for the remainder of the season even as the county tried various measures to help him . In first @-@ class cricket that season , Hobbs scored 1 @,@ 317 runs at an average of 25 @.@ 82 , including two centuries and four other scores over fifty , to finish ninth in the Surrey batting averages . As an occasional medium @-@ paced bowler , he took six wickets . Reviewing Surrey 's season , Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack singled Hobbs out for attention , praising his early @-@ season form ; it suggested that he was the best professional batsman Surrey had found for a long time . The Times noted that , while performing well , Hobbs had fallen short of the standards suggested by his start . 
 After a winter of practice , Hobbs displayed greater consistency in 1906 . Displaying a wider range of shots , he scored four centuries , including another against Essex , and established an effective opening partnership with Hayward . Between his debut and Hayward 's retirement in 1914 , the pair shared 40 opening partnerships in excess of 100 runs . Hobbs was generally the junior partner , and was overawed by Hayward , to the extent that he did not feel confident enough to invite him to his wedding . Hayward influenced Hobbs ' mental approach , particularly his running between the wickets , but the pair were dissimilar in style . In all first @-@ class cricket in 1906 , Hobbs scored 1 @,@ 913 runs at an average of 40 @.@ 70 with a highest score of 162 , placing him second in the Surrey averages . Wisden praised his improved fielding and commented that he was " one of the best professional bats of the year " . Hobbs made further advances in 1907 . Unusually frequent rain during the season — Wisden described the season as the wettest ever — meant that pitches often favoured bowlers . After a poor start , Hobbs successfully adapted to the conditions , and scored consistently well . In June , he and Hayward shared four century opening partnerships in one week . Hobbs scored four centuries in total and by the end of the season had scored 2 @,@ 135 runs , averaging 37 @.@ 45 . He was one of only three men to pass 2 @,@ 000 runs ; he was second to Hayward in the Surrey averages , and eighth nationally . His performances brought him to the attention of the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) selectors , and he was chosen for the Players in the prestigious Gentlemen v Players matches in July , although he scored few runs in either game .

 Hobbs was selected to tour Australia in the 1907 – 08 season with an MCC team , given his opportunity by the unavailability of several leading players . Throughout the outward voyage , Hobbs was severely affected by sea @-@ sickness , a condition which afflicted him on sea voyages throughout his life ; in later tours , he travelled overland as far as possible to reduce his time on ships . Consequently , he missed the first two games of the tour against the Australian state teams . His appearances were further limited by the reluctance of the MCC captain , Arthur Jones , to select him . He played in only two of the early matches , failing on both occasions , and was left out of the team for the first Test match . After England lost the game , Hobbs was chosen for the second Test . Hobbs made his Test debut on 1 January 1908 at Melbourne Cricket Ground . Opening the England batting on the second day , Hobbs scored 83 runs in 182 minutes . Eventually , England needed 282 to win and did so by one wicket ; Hobbs scored 28 . He retained his place for the rest of the series . In the fourth match , he scored 57 on a pitch badly affected by rain ; by adopting a policy of attacking the bowling he hit ten fours . He concluded his series with an innings of 72 in the final game , but could not prevent a third successive English defeat — the home side won the five @-@ match series 4 – 1 . He scored 302 runs in the Tests at an average of 43 @.@ 14 . In other first @-@ class matches , he scored centuries against Tasmania and Victoria , totalling 876 runs at 41 @.@ 71 . 
 Hobbs scored fewer runs in 1908 , despite better conditions for batting . Even so , he scored 81 in the Gentlemen v Players game , achieved a batting average over 40 in the County Championship and scored six centuries for Surrey . In all first @-@ class games , Hobbs scored 1 @,@ 904 runs at 37 @.@ 33 . For his achievements that season , Hobbs was chosen as one of Wisden 's Cricketers of the Year . The citation noted that " at the present time there is perhaps no better professional batsman in England except Hayward and Tyldesley " . 
 Hobbs began the 1909 season with a succession of large scores , including a double century in one match and two separate centuries in another . Such form placed him in contention for a place in the England team to play Australia that year , despite the English batting strength . But the England captain , Archie MacLaren , was unconvinced that Hobbs possessed the required quality . The Surrey captain and England selector H. D. G. Leveson Gower persuaded the committee to include Hobbs in the squad , then convinced a reluctant MacLaren to play him in the team . In the first Test , played at Edgbaston , Hobbs opened the batting with MacLaren but was dismissed from the first ball he received . The match was a low @-@ scoring one , and Australia set England 105 runs to win . Hobbs , this time opening the batting with C. B. Fry , hit 62 not out and England passed the target without losing a wicket . England lost the next two matches , and Hobbs was unsuccessful , with a top @-@ score of 30 in four innings . A badly injured finger meant that he missed the remainder of the Test series ; in three games , he scored 132 runs at an average of 26 @.@ 40 . England lost the series when the remaining two matches were drawn . Hobbs struggled to regain his form when he recovered ; he averaged 40 @.@ 65 for the season , but of the 2 @,@ 114 first @-@ class runs he scored , nearly half came in the first month of the season . 
 = = = Dominance in South Africa = = = 
 Hobbs accepted an invitation to tour South Africa that winter with the MCC . The cricketing conditions were challenging : matches were played on matting pitches , unfamiliar to English players , and the South African googly bowlers had previously troubled most leading English batsmen , provoking debate over how batsmen could combat the new delivery . The MCC captain , Leveson Gower , selected Wilfred Rhodes to open the batting with Hobbs for the first Test . Rhodes , a defensively @-@ minded batsman who excelled at taking quick singles , had begun his career as a bowler who batted down the order . He steadily improved his batting , eventually becoming an opening batsman . Hobbs and Rhodes , between 1910 and 1921 , opened the batting 36 times for England and shared eight century partnerships ; their average of 61 @.@ 31 runs per opening partnership remains the second highest in Test history . In other first @-@ class cricket , they shared a further five century opening partnerships . Their association was notable for effective running ; the pair developed such an unusually good understanding that they were able to run without calling to each other . They scored singles by pushing the ball just past nearby fielders and running quickly . Critics believed that they raised the art of running to a new level . 
 This tactic developed from the first day that Hobbs and Rhodes batted together in the first Test ; they added 159 runs for the first wicket . Hobbs scored 89 in the first innings and 35 in the second , and while England lost narrowly , he appeared much more comfortable than the other English batsmen against the googly . Hobbs and Rhodes shared a partnership of 207 in the tour match following the Test , in which Hobbs scored 163 . England also lost the second Test , but Hobbs scored 53 and 70 , sharing two substantial opening partnerships with Rhodes . The failure of the other batsmen , defeated by the googly bowlers , caused consternation in the English press . As England had few effective pace bowlers on the tour , Hobbs opened the bowling in the first two Tests , as well as the batting . In the third Test , he scored 93 not out to guide England to a three @-@ wicket victory . However , the series was lost when England were defeated in the fourth match ; Hobbs scored 0 and 1 , the only time in his Test career that he failed to reach double figures in either innings , and his worst match return in first @-@ class cricket . In the final game of the series , he scored his first Test hundred , opening the batting and sharing a partnership of 221 with Rhodes which was a record at the time for the first wicket in Test matches . Hobbs scored 187 , an innings praised by Wisden for its " brilliancy " . In this match he once more opened the bowling , dismissing Reggie Schwarz , his only Test wicket . England won the match by nine wickets and the series finished 3 – 2 against them . Hobbs scored 1 @,@ 124 first @-@ class runs at an average of 66 @.@ 11 on the tour , while in the Test matches , he scored 539 runs at 67 @.@ 37 . None of the other English batsmen came close to matching his success against the googly , and by the end of the series , critics were beginning to describe him as the world 's leading batsman . Wisden commented : " Beyond everything else from the English point of view the feature of the trip was the superb batting of Hobbs , who easily adapted himself to the matting wickets and scored from the famous googly bowlers with amazing skill and facility . When they came home the other members of the team could not say too much in his praise . " 
 Fatigue from the South African tour affected Hobbs in 1910 . He scored 1 @,@ 982 runs at an average of 33 @.@ 03 , the lowest average of his career apart from his first season . More effective during 1911 , after a long rest during the winter , Hobbs was consistently successful in a hot , dry summer which produced good batting pitches . He played few large innings , but was very effective in high @-@ pressure games , and scored 2 @,@ 376 runs at 41 @.@ 68 . Bowling more frequently than in other seasons , Hobbs took 28 first @-@ class wickets . Against Oxford University , Hobbs bowled throughout the second innings to take seven wickets for 56 runs , the best figures of his career . 
 = = = Success against Australia = = = 
 Hobbs was an automatic selection for the MCC tour of Australia in the winter of 1911 – 12 . During the first Test , which Australia won by 146 runs , Hobbs scored 63 in the first innings , although by his own admission he did not play well . Rhodes was in the team , but did not open the batting owing to his poor form ; Hobbs opened with Septimus Kinneir . England recovered to win the second Test ; after bowling Australia out for 184 and taking a first @-@ innings lead of 81 , the visiting team eventually faced a target of 219 to win . Hobbs and Rhodes , restored to the opening position , began with a partnership of 57 . Hobbs scored 126 not out , his first century against Australia , and scored particularly well from the bowling of H. V. " Ranji " Hordern , a googly bowler who had taken 12 wickets in the first Test . Wisden commented that Hobbs " played one of the finest innings of his life " , and England won by eight wickets . Australia were once more bowled out for a low score in the third Test ; this time Hobbs and Rhodes added 147 for the first wicket and Hobbs scored 187 . England reached a total of 501 and won the match by seven wickets . 
 Having established a lead in the series , England began the fourth Test by bowling Australia out for 191 . At the end of the first day , Hobbs and Rhodes had scored 54 together , and the next day they took their partnership for the first wicket to 323 , setting a new record for the highest partnership for any wicket in Test matches . Their partnership remained an overall Test record for 22 years and the highest for the first wicket until 1948 . As of 2016 , this remains England 's highest opening partnership against Australia . The pair scored easily from the bowling but faced criticism for slow batting . Even so , Hobbs reached a century in 133 minutes and proceeded to play more aggressively afterwards . He was finally dismissed for 178 . England reached a total of 589 and bowled Australia out for 173 to win the match by an innings and regain the Ashes . England also won the final Test to take the series 4 – 1 ; Hobbs scored 32 and 45 , sharing a partnership of 76 with Rhodes in the second innings . Hobbs ended the series with an aggregate of 662 runs at an average of 82 @.@ 75 , setting a new record number of runs for an individual batsman in a Test series . His average was far greater than any other batsman on either team , and the tour established him as the world 's best batsman . In addition , he ran out 15 batsmen while fielding at cover point . The Australians did not dare run when he fielded the ball for fear of the speed of his throw . In all first @-@ class matches , Hobbs scored 943 runs at 55 @.@ 47 . 
 The 1912 season was unusually wet , which resulted in some very difficult pitches for batting . Wisden remarked that Hobbs did not bat particularly well for Surrey . The press criticised him for trying to score too quickly and losing his wicket in the process . During the summer , both Australia and South Africa toured England , taking part in the Triangular Tournament . Hobbs made a slow start to the competition when he was bowled in the first over in England 's opening match , and his form was uncertain in the early part of the season . However , he scored a century against Australia at Lord 's Cricket Ground on a very difficult batting pitch in England 's second game , sharing a partnership of 112 with Rhodes . He continued with scores of 55 and 68 in the next two games against South Africa , and his batting was praised by the press ; for the first time , in the Times , he was referred to as " a great master " . South Africa were defeated in five of their six games ( the other was drawn ) . As the first two games between England and Australia were drawn , the final match was designated as the deciding match for the tournament . Hobbs and Rhodes opened with 107 , and Hobbs scored 66 . These runs were crucial and England won the game by 244 runs . Hobbs had the best batting average for the summer from all three teams ; he averaged 40 @.@ 75 against South Africa and 56 @.@ 00 against Australia . In all first @-@ class cricket his aggregate was 2 @,@ 042 runs at 37 @.@ 81 . 
 = = = Years before the war = = = 
 In 1913 , batting in a more controlled fashion , Hobbs scored 2 @,@ 605 runs at an average of 50 @.@ 09 , placing him second in the national averages . He continued to score quickly , twice scoring 100 runs before lunch on the first day of a match ; against Worcestershire , he and Hayward shared an opening partnership of 313 in 190 minutes . In the winter of 1913 – 14 , the MCC sent a strong team to South Africa . The opposition team lacked effective players , and England won the five @-@ Test series 4 – 0 , mainly as a result of the bowling of Sydney Barnes . Hobbs scored 443 runs at an average of 63 @.@ 28 in the series ; he did not score a century , but accumulated scores of 82 , 92 and 97 , while he and Rhodes shared two century opening partnerships and another of 92 . Hobbs adopted a cautious approach , and Wisden noted that he was " not quite so brilliant as in England " but said that he was " an absolute master on matting wickets [ pitches ] . " In all first @-@ class matches , he scored 1 @,@ 489 runs at 74 @.@ 45 . 
 After a slow start to the 1914 season , Hobbs recorded a string of centuries , including a score of 226 , his highest at that time . The looming First World War overshadowed much of the season . Cricket initially continued once the war began , but as the Oval had been requisitioned by the military , Hobbs ' benefit match was moved from the Oval to Lord 's . This move , and the public 's preoccupation with the war , consigned the game to a financial failure ; in total Hobbs ' benefit raised £ 657 , lower than most benefits and far less than usually raised for cricketers of Hobbs ' standing . The Surrey committee agreed to give him another benefit when the war concluded . Hobbs scored his 11th century of the season before public pressure terminated the cricket season . During the winter , the MCC declared Surrey as County Champions ; although the war prevented the completion of all the matches , Surrey led comfortably enough for the other counties not to object . This was the only time in Hobbs ' career that Surrey were champions . In all first @-@ class games in 1914 , he scored 2 @,@ 697 runs at 58 @.@ 63 . As the war began , Hobbs reputation was at its peak ; he was described by Wisden as " one of the greatest bats of his generation " . McKinstry states that during the season : " With his free @-@ scoring method , [ Hobbs ] had dazzled in a way that he was never to do again . " 
 = = First World War = = 
 Unlike many other cricketers , Hobbs did not immediately join the army , but worked in a munitions factory , possibly as a clerk . Writing later , Hobbs related that he was criticised for not joining up , but suggested he did not realise how serious the war would be , and was conscious of the need to care for his family . From March 1915 he found extra work as coach at Westminster School , and in May began to play on Saturdays as a professional for Idle in the Bradford Cricket League . The continuation of competitive cricket in Bradford , when all other such cricket had ceased , was controversial . Several clubs hired top @-@ class professionals and matches became very popular . Although his arrival was eagerly anticipated , Hobbs never reached the expected heights , averaging 36 @.@ 63 throughout the 1915 season . But his signing provoked an angry exchange of correspondence between the Yorkshire president Lord Hawke , who was highly critical of the employment of professionals , and John Booth , the president of the Bradford League . Hobbs never publicly commented on the matter , but was instrumental in recruiting Frank Woolley to play in the league . He continued to play for Idle in 1916 , and was more successful , scoring 790 runs at 52 @.@ 60 and taking 65 wickets at 6 @.@ 27 . But his conscription after the season into the Royal Flying Corps ended his regular cricket in the league . 
 Hobbs joined the Corps in October 1916 as an air mechanic and after training was posted to London , then Norfolk ; at first he had time to appear in charity cricket matches and in several games for Idle . In November 1917 , he joined 110 Squadron which remained in England despite plans to send it to France . By 1918 , the cricket authorities began to arrange more matches and Hobbs played successfully several times at Lord 's . In September 1918 , 110 Squadron , as part of the newly formed Royal Air Force ( RAF ) , was sent to France and took an active part in the fighting , but Hobbs never discussed his career in the RAF . Even so , some of his family remained critical and felt that the worst of the war was over when Hobbs went to France . He was demobilised in February 1919 .

 When first @-@ class cricket resumed in 1919 , Surrey awarded Hobbs a five @-@ year contract worth £ 400 a year . During the season , he began to open the batting with Andy Sandham , who succeeded to Hayward 's position as Hobbs ' partner ; in the following years , the pair established an effective partnership . In total , they shared 66 century opening partnerships and averaged over 50 for the first wicket . Like Hobbs ' other successful partnerships , this one was based on quick running . Sandham , even when successful , was often overshadowed by his partner ; on one occasion , Sandham scored a century but the headlines were reserved for Hobbs ' duck . Sandham usually played the subordinate role and Hobbs took most of the bowling . 
 Hobbs made a good start to the 1919 season and , despite a brief spell of failure through over @-@ aggression , batted consistently . He scored a double century for Surrey against a touring Australian Imperial Forces cricket team and centuries in each of the three Gentlemen v Players matches — the only player ever to do so in one season . His rescheduled benefit match raised £ 1 @,@ 670 , money he used to open a sports shop in London . The shop was successful and he ran it until just before his death . The additional income gave him considerable financial independence . In total that year , Hobbs scored 2 @,@ 594 runs in first class matches , more than anyone else , at an average of 60 @.@ 32 . After a winter working in his shop , his good form continued into 1920 . Four of his eleven first @-@ class centuries came in consecutive innings in June , and he totalled 2 @,@ 827 runs at 58 @.@ 89 . He also took five wickets for 21 runs against Warwickshire , and his 17 wickets at an average of 11 @.@ 82 placed him at the top of the Surrey bowling averages . 
 Hobbs toured Australia with the MCC during the 1920 – 21 season , under the captaincy of J. W. H. T. Douglas , when Australia won every match of the five @-@ Test series . He was one of the few English successes . He scored two centuries in the opening three first @-@ class games , and in the first Test top @-@ scored in both England innings with 49 and 59 . In the second Test , he scored 122 on a difficult pitch which had been affected by rain . Wisden commented that this was " from the English point of view , the finest innings of the tour " . He also scored a century in defeat in the third Test , hitting 123 in the final innings as England failed to score 489 to win the game . He did not pass 50 again in the series ; after a failure on the fourth Test , he tore a thigh muscle batting in a game before the final Test . Persuaded by Douglas to play anyway , he scored 40 and 34 but struggled to field effectively . One unsuccessful attempt to chase the ball caused some of the crowd to jeer him , which led to controversy when two amateur members of the team , Percy Fender and Rockley Wilson , wrote scathingly about the incident . Hobbs scored a total of 924 first @-@ class runs on the tour , at an average of 51 @.@ 33 ; in Test matches , he scored 505 runs at 50 @.@ 50 . Although he and Rhodes resumed their opening partnership , apart from in the first Test , when C. A. G. Russell partnered Hobbs , they could not replicate their former successes , and shared only one stand worth more than fifty . 
 Hobbs played just five first @-@ class matches in 1921 , when Australia toured England . In his opening first @-@ class game , he played against the touring team , but tore the same thigh muscle injured in Australia . He missed the opening two Tests , but once recovered , scored a century for Surrey ; as England trailed 2 – 0 in the five @-@ Test series , the selectors chose him for the third Test . In the days approaching the match , played in Leeds , he suffered from increasing stomach pain but reluctantly played . On the first day of the match , he had to leave the field , and after a day of rest the pain worsened . He consulted Sir Berkley Moynihan , a prominent surgeon based in Leeds , who diagnosed acute appendicitis and operated the same day . In the opinion of the surgeon , Hobbs would not have lived another five hours without surgery . He missed the rest of the season . 
 Hobbs returned to cricket in 1922 and batted effectively throughout the first months of the season , scoring 10 first @-@ class centuries in total . One of the centuries came in the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord 's , in which he captained the Players team for the first time . Towards the end of the season , his form faded owing to the lingering effects of his illness and operation the previous year . Wisden observed that he frequently tired during longer innings and often tried to get out soon after reaching three figures ; this habit of giving up his innings continued throughout the remainder of his career . The season also marked a turning point in his batting approach where he preferred to score more slowly and take fewer risks , in contrast to his adventurous pre @-@ war tactics . Second in the national batting averages for 1922 , he scored 2 @,@ 552 runs at an average of 62 @.@ 24 , but declined an invitation to tour South Africa that winter with the MCC . Less successful during the wet 1923 season , Hobbs failed on many occasions and was unsuccessful in both Gentlemen v Players games . He was still struggling with the after @-@ effects of his operation and Wisden noticed he once more tried to score too quickly early in an innings . However , against Somerset , he scored the 100th century of his first @-@ class career , the third man to reach the landmark after W. G. Grace and Hayward . Overall in the season , he scored 2 @,@ 087 runs at 37 @.@ 95 . 
 = = = Partnership with Sutcliffe = = = 
 Hobbs signed a new contract worth £ 440 a season before the 1924 season . His form recovered to the extent that his biographer , John Arlott , described it as the beginning of " his quite phenomenal second lease of cricketing life " . Batting conditions were good throughout the summer and Hobbs ' opening partnership with Sandham for Surrey began to approach its peak of effectiveness . Hobbs also established an opening partnership with Yorkshire 's Herbert Sutcliffe ; the pair had opened together briefly in previous seasons and were chosen to open in a Test trial early in 1924 , beginning a six @-@ year Test association . They were often successful in difficult batting conditions ; Hobbs , generally the dominant partner , usually faced more of the bowling . By the time of his retirement , they had opened the batting 38 times in Tests , shared 15 century opening partnerships , and added 3 @,@ 249 runs together ; their average partnership was 87 @.@ 81 , the highest in all Tests for a pair of opening batsmen as of 2016 . In all first @-@ class matches , they had added 100 for the first wicket 26 times and had an average partnership of over 77 . As with Hobbs ' other partnerships , they ran well between the wickets , and established a particular reputation for reliability ; according to McKinstry , they became an " English institution " . The cricket writer Gerald Howat suggests that " ' Hobbs and Sutcliffe ' became almost a synonym for English stability . " 
 Following their success in the 1924 trial match , Hobbs and Sutcliffe were selected for the England team to play the first Test against South Africa . When England batted first , the pair added 136 for the first wicket ; Hobbs , playing a Test innings in England for the first time since 1912 , scored 76 . England won the match by a large margin . In the second Test , Hobbs and Sutcliffe opened with 268 runs for the first wicket ; Hobbs scored 211 , his highest Test score . At the time , the innings was the highest played at Lord 's in a Test and equalled the highest in a Test match in England . England scored 531 for the loss of two wickets and won the match by an innings . Having initially declined an invitation to tour Australia with the MCC in the coming winter , Hobbs was left out of the team for the fourth Test . After the MCC accepted his request to allow his wife Ada to accompany him — the wives of professionals were not usually permitted to tour — he changed his mind , and was added to the England team for the fifth Test . In the series , he scored 355 runs at an average of 71 @.@ 00 , while in all first @-@ class matches he totalled 2 @,@ 094 runs at 58 @.@ 16 . He finished second in the national averages , and the cricket press noted that , although Hobbs scored more slowly and in less spectacular fashion than previously , he batted in a safer , secure style which was more successful in terms of run @-@ scoring . 
 The MCC team which toured Australia under the captaincy of Arthur Gilligan in 1924 – 25 lost the Test series 4 – 1 , but critics thought the winning margin flattered the host country . Between them in the Test matches , Hobbs and Sutcliffe scored seven centuries and shared four opening partnerships which passed 100 runs . Hobbs began the tour well , and scored consistently in the matches before the Tests . In the first Test , in reply to Australia 's first innings of 450 , Hobbs and Sutcliffe opened with 157 runs . Hobbs went on to his seventh century against Australia , beating the previous record number in England @-@ Australia Tests by Victor Trumper . Australia eventually set England a target of 605 runs . Hobbs and Sutcliffe shared their second century opening partnership of the game , but England lost by 193 runs . During the match , Hobbs became the leading run @-@ scorer in Test cricket , passing the previous record of 3 @,@ 412 runs set by Clem Hill in 1912 . In the second Test , Australia scored 600 during the opening two days . In reply , Hobbs and Sutcliffe batted throughout the third day without being separated , scoring 283 . They concentrated on defence but both men reached centuries , and the press praised their achievements . Even so , Australia won the game by 81 runs , and in the aftermath of the defeat , Cecil Parkin , a former Test bowler and vocal critic of Gilligan 's captaincy , wrote a newspaper article suggesting that Hobbs should assume the leadership of the side . This suggestion provoked a reaction from Lord Hawke — " Pray God , no professional will ever captain England " — and subsequent press debate over the idea of Hobbs as captain . In reality , Hobbs had no desire to captain England . 
 Australia once more batted first in the third Test , scoring 489 . For tactical reasons , Hobbs did not open the batting but scored 119 and shared another century partnership with Sutcliffe . Wet weather altered the course of the match and , despite an opening partnership of 63 between Hobbs and Sutcliffe , Australia won by 11 runs . The opening batsmen shared their fourth century partnership of the series in the fourth Test as England won by an innings , but Australia won the final match to win the series 4 – 1 and in a heavy defeat , Hobbs failed in both innings . In the series , he scored 573 runs at an average of 63 @.@ 66 , and made two half @-@ centuries in addition to his three hundreds . Critics in Australia and England once more recognised him as the leading batsman in the world . Hobbs and Sutcliffe far outscored the remaining MCC batsmen and Wisden judged that with better support from other batsmen they could have won the series . In all games , Hobbs scored 865 first @-@ class runs at 54 @.@ 06 . 
 = = = Peak of popularity = = = 
 Hobbs was particularly successful in 1925 . Early in the season a string of centuries , including a run of four in consecutive innings , made him the first batman to reach 1 @,@ 000 runs that season and brought him close to Grace 's record of 126 first @-@ class hundreds . He scored the 125th century of his career against Kent on 20 July , but amid intense press and public interest , Hobbs lost form through a combination of anxiety and fatigue . He continued to score well , but could not reach three figures in an innings — after one innings of 54 , a newspaper headline proclaimed that " Hobbs Fails Again " . It was not until 15 August , against Somerset , that Hobbs scored 101 to reach the landmark , an achievement praised and feted throughout the country over the following weeks . On the final day of the match , Hobbs scored another century to become the outright record holder . He ended his season with an innings of 266 in a Gentlemen v Players match at the Scarborough Festival , his highest to date and the best score made in the Gentlemen v Players series , and 104 for the Rest of England against Yorkshire , the County Champions . In total , he scored 16 centuries — setting a record for most centuries in a season — and totalled 3 @,@ 024 runs at an average of 70 @.@ 32 to top the national averages for the first time . Following his successful season , Hobbs was in great demand . He attended several functions in his honour but rejected offers to appear on stage , in film and to stand as a Liberal parliamentary candidate . 
 Hobbs was given a third benefit by Surrey in 1926 which raised £ 2 @,@ 670 . Further recognition came when he and Rhodes joined the England selection committee for the Ashes series to be played that summer ; for professional cricketers to serve as England selectors was unprecedented . Hobbs began the season well , and after the first Test , which was badly affected by rain , he remained in form by scoring 261 against Oxford University , sharing an opening partnership of 428 with Sandham ; this remained a Surrey first wicket record as of 2016 . In the drawn second Test , he and Sutcliffe shared an opening stand of 182 . Hobbs scored 119 but was criticised for slowing down later in his innings , leading to accusations that he was more concerned with reaching three figures than batting for the team . The third Test was also drawn . England followed on in the face of a large Australian total , but Hobbs and Sutcliffe opened the second innings with a partnership of 156 and Hobbs scored 88 as the game was saved . During the fourth Test , he temporarily assumed the captaincy when Arthur Carr withdrew from the match owing to illness ; Hobbs became the first professional to captain England at home . The selectors and players on both teams believed Hobbs performed well tactically . He scored 74 in England 's innings , but heavy rain ensured a fourth successive draw . 
 As everything depended on the final game , the Imperial Cricket Conference agreed that the match be played to a finish . Carr was replaced as captain by Percy Chapman , a decision which proved controversial in the press ; Rhodes was also recalled to the team , aged 48 . Amid huge public interest , the match was evenly balanced at the end of the second day when England began their second innings . Overnight rain seriously damaged the pitch before the third morning and few critics — including members of the home team — expected England to score many runs . But Hobbs and Sutcliffe , who had scored 49 on the second evening , began to bat confidently before the effects of a hot sun drying a damp pitch made batting even more hazardous . Concentrating on defence , but scoring whenever possible , the pair added 172 in total . Immediately after reaching 100 , Hobbs was out and received a prolonged ovation from the crowd . Many critics believed that , given the conditions , match situation and pressure , this was his greatest innings . England built up a large lead and bowled Australia out to win the Ashes . Late in the season , Hobbs made the highest score of his career , 316 not out for Surrey against Middlesex at Lord 's , establishing a record individual innings for Lord 's which survived until 1990 . In total , Hobbs scored 2 @,@ 949 runs at 77 @.@ 60 , including 12 centuries , to be placed first in the national batting averages . 
 Hobbs missed a large part of the 1927 season with a combination of illness and injury . In between his absences , he performed well , although he was left out of the Gentlemen v Players match . He scored 1 @,@ 641 runs at 52 @.@ 93 , including seven centuries . He began the 1928 season with four centuries in the first month , but another leg injury kept him out of cricket for six weeks . When he recovered , he was selected in the last two of the three Tests against the West Indies , playing their first Test series . In his first game , he and Sutcliffe shared a century partnership ; in the third , Hobbs scored 159 , having opened with a 155 @-@ run partnership with Sutcliffe . England won the series 3 – 0 . Hobbs maintained his batting form until the end of the season ; he finished second in the batting averages , scoring 2 @,@ 542 runs at an average of 82 @.@ 00 and hitting 12 centuries . Critics believed he remained unsurpassed among English batsmen . 
 = = = Final Tests = = = 
 Hobbs toured Australia for a final time as a player in 1928 – 29 as part of a strong MCC team , and despite substantial scores in early games , did not bat well . He made little contribution to England 's victories in the first two Tests , and some critics noticed a decline in his batting , a judgement reinforced when he was out to a poorly @-@ chosen shot in the first innings of the third Test for 20 . Australia were able to build up a substantial lead , and overnight rain before the sixth day of the match made them likely winners . England needed 332 to win , but on a pitch growing more difficult as it dried , a total of 100 was considered unlikely . Hobbs and Sutcliffe survived to add 105 for the first wicket ; observers praised their technique against the turning ball , although the Australian bowlers were criticised for ineffective tactics . Hobbs was out for 49 ; at his suggestion , Douglas Jardine came in to bat next , and England reached the end of the day having lost just one wicket for a score of 199 . Next day , the team won the game to take a 3 – 0 lead in the series with two to play and ensure they retained the Ashes . In the fourth Test , Hobbs scored 74 and shared a partnership of 143 with Sutcliffe as England won by 12 runs ; in the final game , won by Australia , he scored 142 on the first day , his final Test century and 12th against Australia . Scoring his hundred at the age of 46 years 82 days , he remained as of 2016 the oldest player to score a Test century . In first @-@ class games on the tour , Hobbs scored 962 runs at 56 @.@ 58 @.@ and 451 runs at 50 @.@ 11 in the Tests . 
 Hobbs missed more cricket with injuries and illnesses in 1929 ; between 1926 and 1930 , he missed more than a third of Surrey 's matches . However , he scored heavily and compiled 2 @,@ 263 runs at an average of 66 @.@ 55 to lead the first @-@ class averages . Unfit for the first two Tests against South Africa , he chose to miss the next two , and played in the final game , scoring 10 and 52 . Critics observed a general slowing in Hobbs ' scoring throughout the season , and he scored more often in singles than in his earlier years . 
 Hobbs began 1930 in good form , and , with Rhodes , was added to the selection panel again for the Ashes series that season . In the first Test , Hobbs scored 78 and 74 ; he top @-@ scored in both innings , but failed in the next two Tests . Before the third and fourth Tests , feeling tired and concerned by his form , he offered to stand down but the other selectors declined his suggestion . When he batted in the fourth Test , he shared an opening partnership of 108 with Sutcliffe , their 11th century stand against Australia . After two hours batting , he was out for 31 . With the series level at 1 – 1 , the final Test was to be played to a finish , but before it began , Hobbs announced that it would be his last . Shortly after making the decision , he returned to form , scoring a century and passing , in his next game , W. G. Grace 's record career @-@ aggregate of 54 @,@ 896 first @-@ class runs . Before the deciding Test , the selectors sacked Percy Chapman as captain . The press speculated that Hobbs would replace him , but Bob Wyatt was chosen ; Hobbs may have turned down an offer of the captaincy at the meeting of selectors . In the match , Hobbs scored 47 in the first innings . When he came out to bat in the second , in the face of a large Australian first @-@ innings lead , Hobbs was given an ovation by the crowd and the Australian fielders gave him three cheers . Hobbs was moved by his reception but scored only nine runs before he was dismissed , and Australia won the match and series . In his final series , he scored 301 runs at 33 @.@ 44 . In 61 Tests , he had scored 5 @,@ 410 runs at an average of 56 @.@ 94 . He retired as the leading run @-@ scorer in Test matches , a record he held until it was passed by Wally Hammond in 1937 . Maintaining his form for the rest of the season , Hobbs scored 2 @,@ 103 first @-@ class runs in 1930 at 51 @.@ 29 .

 During the winter of 1930 – 31 , Hobbs and Sutcliffe joined a private team run by the <unk> of <unk> which toured India and Ceylon . Hobbs was very popular with the crowds , and scored 593 runs . These runs , and in particular the two centuries he scored , were to prove controversial . Hobbs never believed that the matches were , or should have been , of first @-@ class status , but statisticians later judged them to be first @-@ class . Wisden never recognised the centuries and so records his century total as 197 . Other authorities give 199 centuries . Despite using a more limited batting technique , Hobbs remained successful in 1931 . He played several representative matches and took part in the 150th century opening partnership of his career . In total , he scored 2 @,@ 418 first @-@ class runs in the season at 56 @.@ 23 . In 1932 , despite missing several matches owing to injuries and fatigue , he scored 1 @,@ 764 runs at 56 @.@ 90 , including centuries in each innings against Essex . According to Mason , this latter performance prompted Douglas Jardine to nickname Hobbs " The Master " . Hobbs scored 161 not out for the Players against the Gentlemen , his 16th century in the fixture , to pass the record total of Grace for the Gentlemen . 
 Hobbs was partially involved in the Bodyline controversy in Australia in 1932 – 33 . Late in the 1932 season , Bill Bowes consistently bowled short @-@ pitched deliveries against him in a match between Surrey and Yorkshire . Bowes was criticised in the press and particularly by Pelham Warner , who was to manage the MCC team in Australia . Hobbs accompanied the team to Australia as a journalist , writing for the News Chronicle and The Star , accompanied by his ghostwriter Jack Ingham . During the tour , Hobbs neither condemned Bodyline nor fully described the English tactics . Other journalists admired Hobbs but dismissed his writing as " bland " . When he returned to England , Hobbs openly criticised the English tactics in newspaper columns and in a book he wrote about the tour . In 1933 , playing less frequently , he scored 1 @,@ 105 runs at 61 @.@ 38 , aged 50 . After missing the first games with illness , he scored 221 against the touring West Indian team , to the acclaim of the press . He did not play every game , and the Surrey committee allowed him to choose which matches to play . More centuries followed later that season , which took him to 196 in his career , fuelling anticipation that he would reach 200 centuries . That winter he accompanied the MCC team in India as a journalist . Before the next season , Surrey constructed a new entrance to the Oval which was named after Hobbs . In 1934 , he scored 624 runs at 36 @.@ 70 . After a solid start , he scored his final first @-@ class century against Lancashire . After this he played irregularly , and his batting began to appear uncomfortable . Hobbs realised his career was over : in February 1935 , he announced his retirement . There were many tributes and a public dinner was held in his honour which was attended by many leading figures in cricket . In all first @-@ class cricket , Hobbs scored 61 @,@ 760 runs at an average of 50 @.@ 70 according to ESPNcricinfo . Later in 1935 , Hobbs was made an honorary life member of Surrey . 
 = = Style and technique = = 
 For much of Hobbs ' career , critics judged him to be the best batsman in the world . E. W. Swanton described him in 1963 as " a supreme master of his craft , and the undisputed head of his profession " . Neville Cardus said that Hobbs was the first batsman to develop a technique to succeed consistently against googly bowlers , and that he mastered all types of bowling , all over the world and in a variety of conditions . Other critics have suggested that Hobbs moved the focus of batting from aesthetic off side shots to leg side play more suited to swing and googly bowling . Swanton wrote that Hobbs combined classical play with effective defence — including protecting the wickets using his pads — against the ball unexpectedly moving towards the stumps . His pad @-@ play was controversial : it removed any possibility of dismissal but was regarded by some cricket authorities as negative and unsporting . 
 Many of his English contemporaries rated Hobbs superior to Donald Bradman , often regarded as the greatest batsman in the history of cricket , on difficult pitches . In difficult batting conditions Hobbs batted with great success , and several of his most highly regarded innings came in such circumstances . Murphy suggests : " Before Bradman , he was the most consistent run @-@ getter of all time , yet no one worried less about the sheer slog of carving out big scores . " Hobbs frequently was out deliberately soon after reaching a century — roughly a quarter of his centuries were scores less than 110 — and was not particularly interested in most statistics . An article in Wisden in 2000 stated : " He was never as dominant as Bradman ; he never wanted to be . But his contemporaries were in awe of his ability to play supremely and at whim , whatever the conditions . " 
 Hobbs ' technique was based on strong forearms and good foot movement . R. C. Robertson @-@ Glasgow suggested that " his footwork was , as near as is humanly possible , perfect . In every stroke , he moved into line with the ball with so little effort that he could bat for hours without over @-@ taxing energy of mind or body . " He played every type of shot — he did not have a " signature " shot like other batsmen , but selected his strokes effectively ; according to Alec Kennedy , who bowled to Hobbs , it seemed that he could predict what the bowler would do . In contrast to many leading batsmen from his time , Hobbs preferred to play off the back foot as he believed it gave him more time to see the ball and adapt his shot . Capable of playing all the strokes , he hit the ball precisely between fielders and sometimes delayed his shot to make the ball travel more slowly and allow more time to run ; he also ran well between the wickets . He liked to score his first run quickly when he came into bat , and he often looked to score quickly at the start of an innings , before the bowlers had settled ; on occasion , Hobbs targeted the main bowling threats from the opposition in an attempt to neutralise them . Early in his career , mainly before the First World War , Hobbs was an aggressive , fast @-@ scoring batsman who played many shots . After the war , he was more circumspect and adapted his technique to account for both his increased age , and the increased pressure and expectation from the public and teammates . He concentrated to a greater extent on batting for longer periods ; many critics , including Hobbs himself , recognised the change and suggested that he was a better batsman before 1914 . However , commentators also noted that he displayed greater certainty and control in this later period ; Cardus wrote that " he scored his centuries effortlessly now ; we hardly noted the making of them . " This was the period in which he became known as " The Master " , and he was more consistent than before the war . This was the time when the public regarded him with the most respect and affection ; 98 of his centuries and 26 @,@ 411 of his runs ( at an average of 58 @.@ 62 ) in first @-@ class cricket were scored after he reached the age of 40 . 
 Hobbs was an occasional medium @-@ paced bowler who bowled a good length and made the ball swing . Some critics judged him to be a potentially good bowler , but both Surrey and England were reluctant for him to bowl regularly , fearing it would affect his batting . As a fielder , Hobbs improved greatly from his early days . He fielded in the covers and was expert in cutting off potential runs and returning the ball quickly to the wicket @-@ keeper . Contemporaries believed him to be one of the best cover fielders there had been , and remarked on his powers of anticipation in getting to the ball . They also noted he sometimes deceived batsmen with his casual attitude and occasional deliberate mis @-@ fields ; these would be followed by very sharp fielding which often produced a run out . 
 Although a professional — captains at the time were almost exclusively amateurs — the respect in which Hobbs was held meant that he was accepted as a captain . Many , but not all , critics considered him a competent tactician and leader . He regularly led the Players team against the Gentlemen and sometimes at Surrey in the absence of Percy Fender , but he was a reluctant captain . He disliked the responsibility and decision @-@ making of leadership , and rarely even offered tactical advice . 
 = = Reputation and legacy = = 
 Hobbs was twice selected as Wisden 's Cricketer of the Year , in 1909 and 1926 ; only he and Pelham Warner have received this award twice . In 1963 , Neville Cardus chose him as one of the best six cricketers of the previous 100 years , to mark Wisden 's centenary . More recently , Hobbs was selected by a panel of experts in 2000 as one of five Wisden cricketers of the 20th century . In 2009 , he was selected by cricket historians and writers as a member of England 's all @-@ time best team , and included in a similar team to represent the best players worldwide in the history of cricket . Hobbs ' Test batting average of 56 @.@ 94 remained as of 2016 the sixth best among batsmen to have passed 5 @,@ 000 runs , despite a rise in the number of batsmen who average more than 50 since 2000 . Among openers who have scored 5 @,@ 000 Test runs , he has the third best average behind Sutcliffe and Len Hutton . He was comfortably the leading Test run @-@ scorer during his career , and had the highest number of Test runs at the time of his retirement . Between 1910 and 1929 , he averaged 65 @.@ 55 in Test cricket . 
 Gideon Haigh suggests that Hobbs was a " spontaneous and original " , trend @-@ setting batsman who was not afraid to depart from orthodoxy . Gerald Howat notes that , aside from his batting achievements , " Hobbs 's biographers and obituarists could strike no discordant note . He was a man of moral probity , religious conviction , and personal commitment . And he was humble enough to see himself as an ordinary person blessed with one extraordinary talent , which he put into its proper perspective . It was an attitude of mind which tempered the sternness of his approach with an engaging humour and a delight in playing practical jokes . " Among his contemporaries , Hobbs was regarded as modest and kind , and never criticised other players . He avoided confrontation , although he was " quietly determined " , according to Wisden , and tried to avoid publicity . According to Fender , Hobbs " gave stature " to the profession of cricket . Modern critics have expressed some reservations : some have pointed out that his batting average , although high , has been surpassed by others , and that among his many centuries , few were as large as other players managed . However , others contend that his impact on the game , his achievement in showing that professionals could bat as freely and stylishly as amateurs , and his kindness place him among the top cricketers of all time . Wisden described him in 2000 : " More than anyone else , he lifted the status and dignity of the English professional cricketer . " In summing up his place in history , it said : " He was not an artist , like some of his predecessors , nor yet a scientist , like some of the moderns ; he was perhaps the supreme craftsman . "

 = = = Family life = = = 
 In 1900 , Hobbs met Ada Ellen Gates , a cobbler 's daughter , at an evening church service held in St Matthew 's , Cambridge . The progress of their relationship was slowed by Hobbs ' shyness and devotion to cricket , but the pair eventually married on 26 September 1906 at the church in which they met . They planned to keep the event quiet , but it was reported in the press and the couple received gifts and messages from Hobbs ' Surrey team @-@ mates . Hobbs so disliked being separated from his wife during cricket tours that in later years she often accompanied the team overseas . They had four children : Jack , born in 1907 , Leonard in 1909 , Vera in 1913 and Ivor in 1914 . 
 Hobbs and his wife lived in rented property for the first years of their marriage . His earnings placed them roughly in the bracket of lower middle class according to McKinstry : although more prosperous than he had been during his childhood , the family were not initially financially comfortable . Hobbs ' wages increased with his reputation so that by 1913 , he was earning £ 375 each year , placing his family within the bracket of the London middle class . After several years of moving from one property to another , he was able to buy his own house in 1913 , in Clapham Common , a prosperous area of London . By the middle of the 1920s , cricket in England was extremely popular and the players were famous . Hobbs was the biggest attraction and a combination of his cricket earnings ( estimated to be around £ 780 each year ) , the income from his business , product endorsement — he was one of the first cricketers to benefit from lending his name to commercial products — and ghostwritten books and articles made him relatively wealthy . According to McKinstry , his annual earnings probably reached £ 1 @,@ 500 a year by 1925 , more than a family doctor at the time . Consequently , in 1928 the family moved to a large house in private grounds and Hobbs was able to send his children to private schools . He had greater financial independence than most contemporary cricketers , but was always first concerned to give his family the security lacking from his childhood . 
 = = = Retirement and final years = = = 
 Following his retirement from cricket in 1934 , Hobbs continued to work as a journalist , first with Jack Ingham then with Jimmy Bolton as his ghostwriters . He accompanied the MCC team to Australia in 1936 – 37 and published four books which sold well in the 1930s . In addition , he produced two ghostwritten autobiographies , but generally avoided self @-@ publicity or controversy . He continued to work at his sports shop and he and Ada moved home several times . By the mid @-@ 1930s , his wife was becoming mentally and physically frail . Hobbs supported several charities in his spare time and continued to play cricket at club and charity level . 
 During the Second World War , Hobbs served in the Home Guard at New Malden . In 1946 , Hobbs became the first professional to be elected to the Surrey committee . The same year , he and his wife moved to Hove , following several years of health concerns and worries over his business and children . Ada 's health continued to deteriorate , and the couple spent some time in South Africa in an attempt to aid her recuperation . 
 In 1953 , Hobbs was knighted , the first professional cricketer to be so honoured . He was reluctant to accept and only did so when convinced that it was an honour to all professional cricketers , not just himself . In the same year , John Arlott formed the " Master 's Club " , a group of Hobbs ' friends who met regularly to toast him . Hobbs remained active into the 1960s , including working in his shop . By the late 1950s , Ada was wheelchair @-@ bound and Hobbs spent most of his time caring for her . She died in March 1963 . Hobbs ' health began to fail shortly afterwards and he died on 21 December 1963 at the age of 81 . He left £ 19 @,@ 445 in his will and was buried in Hove Cemetery . A memorial service was held at Southwark Cathedral in February 1964 .

 Commander William Donald Aelian " Bill " King , DSO & Bar , DSC ( 23 June 1910 – 21 September 2012 ) was a British naval officer , yachtsman and author . He was the oldest participant in the first solo non @-@ stop , around @-@ the @-@ world yacht race , the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race , the only person to command a British submarine on both the first and last days of World War II . At the time of his death , he was the last surviving British World War II submarine commander . 
 Brought up by his mother and grandmother , King went to the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth . He was first assigned to the battleship Resolution , and later became commanding officer of the submarine Snapper . He served on three separate vessels in World War II , and was promoted to commander and awarded seven medals during the war . King not only survived World War II , but succeeded in a singlehanded circumnavigation in 1973 on his third attempt . During the latter journey , he managed to reach port despite a collision with a large sea creature 400 miles ( 640 km ) southwest of Australia . 
 = = Family background and childhood = = 
 William Donald Aelian King was born to William Albert de Courcy King and Georgina Marie MacKenzie in 1910 . King 's grandfather , William King , was Chair of Mineralogy and Geology at Queen ’ s College , Galway . He was appointed when the College first opened in 1849 . Grandfather King was the first to argue that <unk> were a species separate from modern humans . 
 King 's father , William Albert de Courcy King , was born in 1875 . He married Georgina Marie , daughter of a " Mr. D. F. MacKenzie , of Collingwood Grange , Camberley , Surrey " in June 1908 . De Courcy King attended Royal Military Academy , Woolwich , and then the School of Military Engineering , Chatham . He received his commission as a second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers in 1894 . Prior to World War I , his postings included Saint Lucia in the 1890s , where the Engineers constructed gun emplacements and fortified coal stations , and South Africa , where the Engineers built blockhouses ( designed by Major S. R. Rice , RE ) during the Anglo Boer War . De Courcy King was awarded the Distinguished Service Order ( DSO ) in 1916 while a major . During the First World War Lieutenant @-@ Colonel De Courcy King served with the 36th ( Ulster ) Division in Belgium . 
 De Courcy King was killed on 27 May 1917 at the age of 42 , and lies buried at <unk> Military Cemetery in Belgium . In April the Engineers had helped prepare for the Battle of Arras , primarily tunnelling and mining of enemy positions . 
 As a result of his father 's death , Bill King was brought up by his mother and grandmother . His MacKenzie grandmother was a formidable woman who learned to ski at the age of 75 and still sailed in her eighties .

 After preparatory school , at the age of twelve , King was sent to the Royal Naval College , Dartmouth , in Devon . In the 2006 documentary about the disastrous 1968 round @-@ the @-@ world yacht race ; Deep Water , King said that he had been a boxer and a " champion long @-@ distance runner " in his youth . 
 From December 1927 to April 1930 , King was posted to the battleship Resolution , which served in the Mediterranean . During this time he became a midshipman . From June 1932 to January 1934 , he was posted to the submarine Orpheus , which served near China . He was promoted to lieutenant in 1932 . In April 1935 , King was appointed first lieutenant of the service vessel Pigmy , formerly the Polish sailing vessel Iskra , used by the Royal Navy at Gibraltar to supply the 8th Submarine Squadron . After seven months , he was transferred to Starfish , then to Narwhal , before being sent to Portsmouth for a commanding officers ' course at HMS Dolphin . A four @-@ month stint aboard the submarine depot ship Titania followed , before King was appointed commanding officer of Snapper . 
 = = World War II = = 
 During World War II , King served in three submarines of the Royal Navy : Snapper , Trusty , and Telemachus . He patrolled the North Sea , the Mediterranean , and the Far East . 
 At the outbreak of the war , King and Snapper were sent to patrol the North Sea . King was commanding officer on Snapper from 16 April 1939 to April 1940 . On 3 December 1939 , Snapper sustained a direct hit from a British aircraft while returning to Harwich after a patrol , but without taking damage . Between December 1939 and July 1940 , Snapper sank six ships , mainly in the Skagerrak Strait . These include the tanker Moonsund , the merchant ship Florida , the minesweepers H. M. Behrens and Carsten Janssen , and the armed trawlers Portland and Cygnus . Snapper was later lost under command of Lieutenant Geoffrey Vernon Prowse , either in a minefield or sunk by German depth charges . 
 In 1941 , King served on the T @-@ class submarine Trusty in the Mediterranean Sea . On 4 December 1941 Trusty unsuccessfully launched torpedoes against a boat which may have been the Italian torpedo boat <unk> . From 21 July 1943 to August 1945 , King was commanding officer of the T @-@ class submarine Telemachus . Telemachus dropped off a special forces unit in western Malaya in October 1944 . 
 Operating from a joint British @-@ Dutch base at Ceylon , Telemachus sank the Japanese Kadai @-@ class submarine I @-@ 166 in the Strait of Malacca on 17 July 1944 . Telemachus tracked I @-@ 166 for 30 minutes , then fired a spread of six torpedoes . One torpedo hit , and sank the Japanese boat with 89 lives lost ; five men on bridge watch survived to be rescued by the Japanese . 
 During the war , King was promoted to commander , and awarded seven medals , including the DSO on 9 May 1940 for " daring , endurance and resource in the conduct of hazardous and successful operations in His Majesty 's Submarines against the enemy " , and the Distinguished Service Cross on 6 September 1940 " for bravery and determination during arduous and successful patrols in H.M. Submarines " both whilst in command of Snapper . A bar was added to his DSO on 16 January 1945 " For outstanding courage , skill and determination in one of H.M. Submarines in successful patrols in Far Eastern waters " ( specifically the sinking of I @-@ 166 ) . In 2006 , he received an eighth medal , the Arctic Emblem . 
 King ended his Royal Navy career as executive officer of the submarine depot ship Forth , an appointment he held from 1 September 1945 to April 1946 . His formal retirement came on 9 May 1948 .

 On 1 January 1949 , King married <unk> Anita Leslie ( Anita Theodosia Moira Rodzianko King 1914 – 1984 ) . She was the eldest child of Sir John Randolph Shane Leslie , 3rd Baronet and his wife Marjorie Ide , the Vermont @-@ born daughter of the US ambassador to Spain . Bill and Anita probably met in Lebanon in 1943 , where King served for 5 months as executive officer of the submarine base at Beirut . She was on a skiing trip after doing duty in Africa in the Motor Transport Corps in 1940 – 42 , although a letter mentions her being in Beirut in 1941 – 42 . Leslie @-@ King then became an ambulance driver in the French Army from 1944 to 1945 . For the latter , she was awarded the Croix de Guerre in 1945 by General Charles de Gaulle . As Anita Leslie , she wrote over a dozen books , including Love in a Nutshell ( 1952 ) , The Remarkable Mr. Jerome : The Life and Times of Leonard Jerome , Sir Winston Churchill 's American Grandfather ( 1954 ) . In 1974 she wrote the biography of Francis Chichester , the first person to sail around the world single @-@ handedly with only one stop . The Kings had two children , Richard Tarka Bourke King ( b . 1949 ) , and Leonie Rose King ( b . 1951 ) . 
 After the war , King took up farming and was an avid fox hunter , as was his wife . In 1946 , the Kings bought Oranmore Castle , a 15th century Norman keep built on Galway Bay in county Galway , Ireland for ₤ 200- . Other sources report that Anita Leslie @-@ King was given the castle by her mother , who had bought it in 1946 . For a while , the Kings lived in a hunting lodge outside Oranmore village , designed by Bill , and built while he and Anita went on a " world sailing cruise . " To help combat his wife 's asthma , King developed an organic farm and garden to feed his family . Both Anita Leslie 's mother and grandmother had suffered asthma . 
 = = Solo circumnavigation = = 
 By 1967 , King was intent on sailing around the world by himself . He had a boat built for this purpose at Souter 's yard at Cowes , on the Isle of Wight . 
 King 's boat , the two @-@ masted Galway Blazer II , a cold @-@ molded plywood schooner , was specially designed for him by Angus Primrose . It is not certain whether the boat was named after The Galway Blazers , a local fox hunting club in Galway , Ireland , which dates to 1839 . Based on boats he had seen in China , the 42 @-@ foot ( 13 m ) schooner had a junk rig ( a sail stiffened by battens ) . In this regard Galway Blazer II was similar to Jester , the junk @-@ rigged <unk> used by former Royal Marine Colonel Herbert Hasler in the first single @-@ handed cross @-@ Atlantic race ( <unk> ) . King , Hasler and Primrose had " teamed up " to design the boat , which was displayed " at the London Boat Show in January 1968 . " 
 King 's intention to sail around the world was overtaken by the institution in March 1968 of the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race . Aged 58 , King became the oldest participant in what was the first organised round the world solo yacht race . In Deep Water , King explained that he joined the race as a means of recovering psychologically from fifteen years of service in submarines . This , he said , had left him " a nervous wreck " . He had planned to sail around the world before he heard of the race , which " sort of caught up with me . " An aunt 's legacy provided him with the means to finance the boat . 
 King was sponsored by the Daily Express and Sunday Express newspapers . One of the shortcomings of the boat was that it had neither guard rails or shrouds to hold on to . King solved this problem with a steel wire that stretched from bow to stern , to which he clipped a harness . His method was then copied by fellow racers <unk> <unk> and Bernard <unk> . 
 King started the race on 24 August 1968 . During the race , King lived on raw food , such as dried fruit stirred into almond paste and green sprouts that he grew on board . He read through the New Testament , the Qur 'an , and Edwin Arnold 's 1880 Buddhist writing , The Light of Asia , as well as " all the best novels , such as Tolstoy . " He said that he did not get depressed during the journey , because of the beauty surrounding him . " You are ... alone with God ... there 's no opportunity to sin " . 
 King lost radio contact during the race . On 31 October , Galway Blazer II capsized in 50 @-@ foot ( 15 m ) waves northeast off Gough Island while King rested , breaking both masts . King had to be towed to Cape Town , South Africa . 
 In 1969 , King again tried and failed to circumnavigate in Galway Blazer II . In 1970 , he was ready for another attempt , again using Galway Blazer II . Ill @-@ health and hull damage forced him to put ashore at Australia . After departing on 12 December 1971 , a large sea creature ( a whale or shark ) damaged his boat about 400 miles ( 640 km ) southwest of Fremantle . " Only his skill and heroic efforts were able to keep the vessel afloat until jury repairs could be made " . King was below deck when he heard a shattering sound and saw the hull below the water line bulge inward and splinter . He rushed upstairs and heeled the boat so that the hole was lifted out of the water . He had to hang over the side and submerge himself to carry out emergency repairs with material that included thirteen ropes , sticky tape , collision covers , sheet copper , and sponge rubber . Then he had to fix the inside of the hull as well . After three days of work , he was able to return to Fremantle , " barely able to limp into port " . 
 The 1970 journey was eventually successful , with King completing his global circumnavigation on 23 May 1973 . In 1975 the Cruising Club of America awarded King the Blue Water Medal in recognition of his feat . The same year Galway Blazer II was sold to Peter Crowther , landlord of a Devon pub . Crowther wrote a book about his experiences with the boat , which was lost on 24 June 1996 during the tenth <unk> Transatlantic Race from Plymouth , England , to Newport , Rhode Island in the USA . 
 = = Later life = = 
 In September 2007 , King and his daughter Leonie , still lived at Oranmore Castle . His life 's experiences continue to attract media attention , from film to music to art installation . 
 He was filmed for two documentaries about the Golden Globe Race ; the 1960s BBC short Golden Globe – Lone Sailor Round the World Race and 2006 's Deep Water . His war experiences still fascinate documentary film makers . King was interviewed for two planned productions , a 24 minute episode entitled " To Honour and Peace " for the proposed series entitled Bravery Beneath the Waves , and for The Stick & The Stars : The Life & Times of Commander Bill King . 
 Most recent attention arises from King 's interaction with Akira Tsurukame and Katja <unk> @-@ Blom – the subject of print media articles , an exhibition , and video interviews . Tsurukame , son of the chief engineer who perished with I @-@ 166 , in 2004 sought out King . King , Tsurukame , and Katja <unk> , whose father was killed when I @-@ 166 sank the Dutch submarine K XVI , together planted a tree at Oranmore Castle to honour the fathers of the latter two . 
 The local paper , The Galway Advertiser , dubbed their <unk> meeting at Oranmore Castle a " reconciliation " . Subsequently Akira Tsurukame released video material of his interviews with Bill King on the internet . Two installations in July 2006 at the Project 06 art exhibition in Galway referenced King . Response to Japanese Peace and Reconciliation was arranged in Swan House , and featured art @-@ works by his daughter Leonie King and grand @-@ daughter Heather Finn . The Lost at Sea installation was a collaboration between Galway @-@ based Cane 141 , who set stories told by Bill King to electronic music , and visual artist Roisin Coyle . The latter installation has since been exhibited in Dublin , and in May 2007 at Grace Exhibition Space in New York City . 
 In 2009 , Bill King 's great nephew Luke Leslie produced the short film King of the Waves , which dramatised King 's solo circumnavigation and encounter with the great white shark . It also included interviews with King himself . It was screened before King and his family in Oranmore Galway on his ninety @-@ ninth birthday shortly before premiering at the 2009 Galway , Cork and Kerry film festivals . 
 King died in September 2012 . At the time of his death , he was the oldest surviving World War II submarine commander .

 = Sydney Riot of 1879 = 
 The Sydney Riot of 1879 was a civil disorder that occurred at an early international cricket match . It took place in Sydney , Australia , at the Association Ground , Moore Park , now known as the Sydney Cricket Ground , during a match between a touring English team captained by Lord Harris and New South Wales , led by Dave Gregory , who was also the captain of Australia . The riot was sparked by a controversial umpiring decision , when star Australian batsman Billy Murdoch was given out by George Coulthard , a Victorian employed by the Englishmen . The dismissal caused an uproar among the parochial spectators , many of whom surged onto the pitch and assaulted Coulthard and some English players . It was alleged that illegal gamblers in the New South Wales pavilion , who had bet heavily on the home side , encouraged the riot because the tourists were in a dominant position and looked set to win . Another theory given to explain the anger was that of intercolonial rivalry , that the New South Wales crowd objected to what they perceived to be a slight from a Victorian umpire . 
 The pitch invasion occurred while Gregory halted the match by not sending out a replacement for Murdoch . The New South Wales skipper called on Lord Harris to remove umpire Coulthard , whom he considered to be inept or biased , but his English counterpart declined . The other umpire , Edmund Barton , defended Coulthard and Lord Harris , saying that the decision against Murdoch was correct and that the English had conducted themselves appropriately . Eventually , Gregory agreed to resume the match without the removal of Coulthard . However , the crowd continued to disrupt proceedings , and play was abandoned for the day . Upon resumption after the Sunday rest day , Lord Harris 's men won convincingly by an innings . 
 In the immediate aftermath of the riot , the England team cancelled the remaining games they were scheduled to play in Sydney . The incident also caused much press comment in England and Australia . In Australia , the newspapers were united in condemning the unrest , viewing the chaos as a national humiliation and a public relations disaster . An open letter by Lord Harris about the incident was later published in English newspapers , and caused fresh outrage in New South Wales when it was reprinted by the Australian newspapers . A defensive letter written in response by the New South Wales Cricket Association further damaged relations . The affair led to a breakdown of goodwill that threatened the future of Anglo @-@ Australian cricket relations . However , friction between the cricketing authorities finally eased when Lord Harris agreed to lead an England representative side at The Oval in London against the touring Australians in 1880 ; this match became the fourth @-@ ever Test and cemented the tradition of Anglo @-@ Australian Test matches . 
 = = Background = = 
 England cricket tours to Australia started in 1861 , and while successful , were still in their infancy in 1879 , despite the first Test match being played in 1877 . The teams were of variable quality ; while promoters sought the best cricketers , they still had to agree to terms . In addition , many could not afford the time for the long boat trip , the tour itself , and the return voyage — the journey itself often took up to two months . Aside from a tour by an Australian Aboriginal team in 1868 , the Dave Gregory @-@ led campaign in 1878 was the first major Australian tour to England . The tour was generally regarded as a success ; a highlight was the Australians ' famous victory over a very strong Marylebone Cricket Club outfit , which included W. G. Grace , the dominant cricketer of the 19th century , in less than four hours . 
 Keen to make the most of this success , the Melbourne Cricket Club — the Australian Board of Control for International Cricket was not created until 1905 — invited Lord Harris , an eminent amateur cricketer of the time , to lead a team to Australia . The team was originally meant to be entirely amateur , but two professional Yorkshire bowlers , George Ulyett and Tom Emmett , joined the tour team after two Middlesex players had to withdraw due to a bereavement . The main distinction between amateurs and professionals was social status , and although amateurs were not paid for playing , they did receive generous " expenses " which usually exceeded anything they would have been paid as professionals . Despite the presence of two professionals in the team , the Englishmen were described as " Gentlemen " , a euphemism for amateurs . Now that Ulyett and Emmett were in the team , they did a large part of the bowling , and commentators felt that Harris had overworked them . 
 At the time , English cricket was dominated by amateurs . These scions of the ruling class were generally educated in elite sandstone private establishments ( ironically called " public schools " ) , such as Harrow and Eton , and universities of the establishment such as Oxford and Cambridge , and to them , sport was a social leisure pursuit . In contrast , the Australians were regarded — by the social standards of the 19th century — as coarse , rowdy and uncultured . The likes of bushranger Ned Kelly heightened perceptions that Australia had a bandit culture . Violence , heckling and abusive chanting among drunken spectators and gamblers at sporting grounds were commonplace in 19th century Australia , and the prevalence of betting was seen as a major cause of crowd unrest . There were many instances of concerning player behaviour during the 1878 tour of England , and Gregory 's men were considered to be unrefined and raucous . 
 Cheating was a regular occurrence in 19th @-@ century Australian cricket , and the inter @-@ colonial rivalry was strong — the modern states of Australia were separate colonies until their federation in 1901 . As in real life , the sporting rivalry was at its most bitter between the two most populous and politically powerful colonies , New South Wales and Victoria . The endless dispute between the colonies over whether Sydney or Melbourne would be the capital of Australia eventually forced the compromise that saw the construction of Canberra midway between the two cities . With regards to sport , cricket administrators from both colonies sought to undermine their cross @-@ border counterparts . On the field , matches were dominated by tit @-@ for @-@ tat throwing wars . Both colonies sought to stack their teams with players who either had borderline — and sometimes flagrantly — illegal bowling actions to use physical intimidation as a means of negating opposition batsmen . Gregory , whose action was regarded as highly dubious , was prominent in his New South Wales team pursuing a policy of condoning illegal bowling . It was amidst a background of inter @-@ colonial rancour and a belligerent Australian sports culture that the riot broke out . 
 Soon after Gregory 's 1878 Australian team returned home , Lord Harris 's Englishmen arrived . Australia won the first match , played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground , by 10 wickets . The match was later recognised as the third Test match in history . New South Wales paceman Fred Spofforth — nicknamed " The Demon " because of his ferocious pace — took 13 wickets in the match , including the first ever Test hat @-@ trick . The next tour match was against New South Wales and started on 24 January at the Association Ground in Sydney . New South Wales won by five wickets , despite the absence of Spofforth — who withdrew from the home side after spraining his wrist the night before the start of the match — and Gregory , who had been dropped for missing a training session and failing to provide an explanation for his absence . 
 = = Match = = 
 The third tour match and the second game between the English XI ( led by Lord Harris ) and New South Wales — captained by Gregory — commenced on Friday 7 February at the Association Ground . It was usual for each side to select one of the two umpires for a match . The English selected 22 @-@ year @-@ old Victorian George Coulthard , upon a recommendation from the Melbourne Cricket Club . As well as being a star footballer for Carlton , Coulthard was a ground @-@ bowler employed by Melbourne , but was yet to make his first @-@ class cricketing debut . Coulthard accompanied Harris 's men from Melbourne following the Test . New South Wales selected Edmund Barton , who later became the first Prime Minister of Australia . 
 As both Gregory and Spofforth were playing for the hosts , bookmakers were offering attractive odds against an English win , and New South Wales were heavily backed , having won the previous match with an even weaker side . The Sydney Morning Herald condemned the " impunity with which open betting was transacted in the pavilion " , in defiance of the prominent notices indicating that gambling was banned . 
 Lord Harris won the toss and chose to bat . At about 12 : 10 pm in front of approximately 4 @,@ 000 spectators , A N Hornby and Lucas started the England innings . They put on 125 for the first wicket before Spofforth bowled Lucas for 51 and Hornby soon after for 67 . Hornby had given a chance during his innings but Lucas did not . Ulyett and Harris steadied the innings after the two quick wickets and added 85 ; Ulyett made 55 before falling victim to a running , diving catch , and Harris made 41 . During his innings , Harris edged a ball to wicket @-@ keeper Murdoch , but Coulthard ruled him not out ; this was noticed by the journalists present and reported the following day . Spofforth cut up the wicket with his feet so badly that it became very difficult to play , and Edwin Evans , bowling from the other end , pitched nearly every ball into the marks . The loss of Ulyett and Harris in quick succession triggered a sudden collapse as England lost 7 / 34 to be all out for 267 . Evans took 5 / 62 and Spofforth 5 / 93 . The English batsmen were productive against the bowling of Edwin Tindall , taking 79 runs from his 27 overs without losing a wicket . At stumps on the first day , NSW were 2 / 53 , with wicket @-@ keeper and opening batsman Billy Murdoch on 28 and Hugh Massie on three . 
 The match recommenced at noon the next day , Saturday 8 February . Ten thousand were in attendance , and New South Wales started well . Murdoch and Massie took the score to 107 before the latter fell , but the hosts reached 3 / 130 at lunch , having not lost another wicket . However , wickets tumbled through the afternoon , none of the incoming batsmen passed single figures and New South Wales were all out for 177 , a deficit of 90 runs . Tom Emmett took the last seven wickets to end with 8 / 47 . Murdoch batted through the innings for 82 not out , making him the hero in the eyes of the locals . He hit 11 fours , and Wisden called his effort a " grand innings " . The prevailing rule of the time required New South Wales to Follow @-@ on ( i.e. to bat again ) as they were more than 80 runs in arrears . NSW started their second innings around 4 o 'clock . Then , when the New South Wales second innings score was 19 , the opening partnership between Murdoch and Alick Bannerman ended when the former was adjudged run out by Coulthard for 10 . 
 = = Riot = = 
 Many in the crowd disagreed with the decision and took exception to it being made by an umpire employed by the Englishmen . That Coulthard was a Victorian added to the emotions of the crowd , who thought along intercolonial lines . The Sydney Evening News propagated rumours that Coulthard had placed a large bet on an English victory , something that the umpire and Lord Harris later denied . Loud hooting came from the pavilion , especially the section where the gamblers , who had overwhelmingly backed a New South Wales victory , were situated . It was reported that well @-@ known gamblers were prominent in inciting the other members of the crowd , amid loud chants of " not out " and " Go back [ to the playing field ] , Murdoch " . Gregory was later accused of trying to fan the dispute and encourage the crowd to gain an advantage for his team . The crowd was already suspicious of Coulthard 's competence and impartiality ; the Sydney Morning Herald commented in that morning 's edition , " The decision [ to give Lord Harris not out on the first day ] was admittedly a mistake " . 
 The pavilion stood at an angle to the crease , so the members were not in an ideal position to see how accurate the decision was . The uproar continued as it became obvious that no batsman was coming out to replace Murdoch , so Harris walked towards the pavilion and met Gregory at the gate , at which point Gregory asked Harris to change his umpire . Harris refused , as the English team considered the decision to be fair and correct . Lord Harris later said that his two fielders in the point and cover positions , being side on to the crease , had a good view of the incident , and that they agreed with Coulthard 's judgement . Barton said that Coulthard 's decision was correct , and that the Englishmen were justified in standing by their nominated umpire . 
 It was while Harris was remonstrating with Gregory that " <unk> " in the crowd surged onto the pitch . A young Banjo Paterson , who later went on to write the iconic Australian bush ballad " Waltzing Matilda " , was among the pitch invaders . Of the 10 @,@ 000 spectators , up to 2 @,@ 000 " participated in the disorder " . Coulthard was jostled and Lord Harris , who had returned to the field to support Coulthard , was struck by a whip or stick but was not hurt . Hornby , a keen amateur boxer who had been offered the English captaincy before stepping aside for Harris , grabbed his captain 's assailant and " conveyed his prisoner to the pavilion in triumph " ; it was later said that he had caught the wrong man . Hornby was also attacked and almost lost the shirt off his back . Emmett and Ulyett each took a stump for protection and escorted Lord Harris off , assisted by some members . In the meantime , the crowd anger grew and there was mounting fear that the riot would intensify , due to speculation that the crowd would try to free Hornby 's captive . However , there was only jostling as the players were evacuated into the pavilion , and the injuries were limited to minor cuts and bruises . An English naval captain who was at the ground had his top hat pulled over his eyes and was verbally abused by some spectators . After 30 minutes , the field was cleared . 
 When the ground was finally cleared Gregory insisted , according to Harris , that Coulthard be replaced . When Harris would not agree , Gregory said , " Then the game is at an end " . Harris asked Barton whether he could claim the match on a forfeit . Barton replied " I will give it to you in two minutes if the batsmen don 't return " . Harris then asked Barton to speak with Gregory to ascertain his intentions . When Barton came out he announced that Alick Bannerman and Nat Thomson would resume the NSW innings . They walked onto the arena and reached the stumps , but before they could receive a ball , the crowd again invaded the pitch , and remained there until the scheduled end of play . According to The Sydney Mail approximately 90 minutes ' play had been lost . Lord Harris maintained his position on the ground , standing " erect " with " moustache bristling " among the spectators , fearful that his leaving the arena would lead to a forfeit . 
 Sunday was a rest day , so the match resumed on Monday , 10 February . As it was a working day , the crowd was much smaller . Rain had fallen and the sun had baked the playing surface into a sticky wicket , which caused erratic behaviour . Nat Thomson was out for a duck without addition to the overnight total , and a collapse ensued . New South Wales made only 49 in their second innings ; Bannerman top @-@ scored with 20 while six of his colleagues failed to score , while Emmett and Ulyett took four and five wickets respectively , including four wickets in four balls for the latter . England thus won by an innings and 41 runs . 
 = = Reaction = = 
 There were widespread allegations by the media and English players that the riot was started by bookmakers , or at least encouraged by the widespread betting that was known to be occurring at the match . Vernon Royle , a member of the English team , wrote in his diary that " It was a most disgraceful affair and took its origin from some of the ' better ' [ gambling ] class in the Pavilion " . 
 The Australian press and cricket officials immediately condemned the riot , which dominated the front pages of the local newspapers , even though the infamous bushranger Ned Kelly and his gang had raided Jerilderie on the same weekend . The local media were united in their disgust at the scenes of tumult , fearing a public relations disaster would erupt in England . The Sydney Morning Herald called the riot " a national humiliation " , and that it " would remain a blot upon the colony for some years to come " . They accused those involved in gambling of inciting " <unk> " and " roughs " to storm the field and attack the Englishmen . However , they also suggested that some of the blame should be put on one of the English professionals , who " made use of a grossly insulting remark to the crowd about their being nothing but ' sons of convicts ' " . Barton defended the Englishmen and Coulthard , saying that none had done anything wrong . He claimed that Emmett and Ulyett were incapable of insulting the Australians in such a way . 
 The Australasian claimed that three policemen at the ground idled and allowed the rioters to attack the Englishmen . They said that the riot " forever made the match memorable in the annals of New South Wales cricket " , and lamented the fact that " <unk> became rampant for the rest of the afternoon " . The paper asked the question " What will they say in England ? " Wisden condemned the unrest as a " deplorably disgraceful affair " and described the spectators as a " rough and excited mob " . Richard Driver of the New South Wales Cricket Association ( NSWCA ) issued a statement of regret for what had happened to the tourists . 
 = = = Lord Harris = = = 
 The NSWCA appealed to Lord Harris , and in reply he said he did not blame them or the cricketers of Sydney in any way , but said that " it [ the riot ] was an occurrence it was impossible he could forget " . 
 On 11 February , one day after the conclusion of the match and three days after the riot , Harris wrote a letter to one of his friends about the disturbance . It was clear that he intended the letter to be printed in the press , and it appeared in full in The Daily Telegraph on 1 April , among other London newspapers , reigniting the furore . Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack considered the incident of such significance that it reprinted the whole correspondence . The letter gives a detailed contemporary account of what Lord Harris thought about the riot . 
 Lord Harris referred to the crowd as a " howling mob " and said " I have seen no reason as yet to change my opinion of Coulthard 's qualities , or to regret his engagement , in which opinion I am joined by the whole team " . He further added that " Beyond slyly kicking me once or twice the mob behaved very well , their one cry being , ' Change your umpire ' . And now for the cause of this disturbance , not unexpected , I may say , by us , for we have heard accounts of former matches played by English teams . " Harris further accused a New South Wales parliamentarian of assisting the gamblers in the inciting the unrest , although he did not name the <unk> . He said 
 I blame the NSW Eleven for not objecting to Coulthard before the match began , if they had reason to suppose him incompetent to fulfil his duties . I blame the members of the association ( many , of course , must be excepted ) for their discourtesy and <unk> like behaviour to their guests ; and I blame the committee and others of the association for ever permitting betting , but this last does not , of course , apply to our match only . I am bound to say they did all in their power to quell the disturbance . I don 't think anything would have happened if A. Bannerman had been run out instead of Murdoch , but the latter , besides being a great favourite , deservedly I think , was the popular idol of the moment through having carried his bat out in the first innings . 
 He further accused the Australian public of being bad losers , claiming that they were sparing in their applause upon his team 's victory , and were unable to appreciate skills shown by an opposing team . He summed up his feelings 
 To conclude , I cannot describe to you the horror we felt that such an insult should have been passed on us , and that the game we love so well , and wish to see honoured , supported , and played in an honest and manly way everywhere , should receive such desecration . I can use no milder word . 
 = = = Response in New South Wales = = = 
 The NSWCA were outraged by Lord Harris 's letter and convened a special meeting to consider their response and subsequently had their honorary secretary , Mr J.M. Gibson , write to The Daily Telegraph in reply . Gibson argued that " the misconduct of those who took possession of the wickets has been exaggerated " and that Lord Harris 's account was " universally regarded here as both inaccurate and ungenerous . " The letter said that " We cannot allow a libel upon the people of New South Wales so utterly unfounded as this to pass without challenge " . It went on to accuse Harris of omitting certain facts in his account , which according to the NSWCA , depicted Australia and the cricket authorities in a poor light . These included an accusation that Harris had failed to note that the NSWCA and the media had immediately and strongly condemned the disturbance and treatment of the English visitors . Gibson also criticised Lord Harris for claiming that Coulthard was " competent " , while " admitting ' he had made two mistakes in our innings ' " , especially as Coulthard 's not out ruling against Lord Harris " was openly admitted by his lordship to be a mistake " that favoured the Englishmen . The letter further denied the claim that those who incited the riot were associated with the NSWCA and accused Harris of inflammatory conduct during the disorder . 
 Certainly the conduct of Lord Harris did not tend to calm the general excitement . His lordship elbowed his way out through the crowd in a manner so violent as to invite assault . He kept his men ' exposed to the fury of the mob ' for about an hour and a half upon the absurd and insulting plea that if he did not ' the other side would claim the match ! ' . But not one of the team received a scratch , and Mr. Hornby dragged a supposed offender of very diminutive stature through the mass to the pavilion , a hundred yards away , in triumph , and amidst general applause , with only a torn shirt as the penalty of his heroism . 
 Spofforth , Australia 's leading bowler , commented on the incident in an 1891 cricket magazine interview , but put a different slant on the cause . He thought that the English team were victims of intercolonial rivalry between New South Wales and Victoria : 
 Then the crowd could stand it no longer and rushed on to the field , refusing to budge until the umpire was removed . I have no wish to dwell on this painful occurrence , but I should like to point out that the feeling aroused was almost entirely due to the spirit of the rivalry between the Colonies ... The umpire was Victorian , and the party spirit in the crowd was too strong , ' Let an Englishman stand umpire , ' they cried ; ' we don 't mind any of them . We won 't have a Victorian . ' There was not the slightest animosity against Lord Harris or any of his team ; the whole disturbance was based on the fact that the offender was a Victorian . But Lord Harris stood by his umpire ; and as a result , the match had to be abandoned till the following day . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Immediately after the game , Lord Harris led his men from Sydney , cancelling the planned return match against a representative Australian side that would have become the fourth @-@ ever Test match . The England team returned to Melbourne where two further matches were played against Victoria on 21 – 25 February and 7 – 10 March . At the farewell banquet hosted by the Melbourne Cricket Club , Harris spoke publicly for the first time about the riot . He was critical of the way his team had been treated by a portion of the New South Wales press , which had " unintentionally " , he trusted , " but with questionable courtesy " , described them " as if they were strolling actors , rather than as a party of gentlemen . " However , the speech was otherwise regarded as reconciliatory . 
 The NSWCA pressed charges against two men who were charged with " having participated in the disorder " . Their President Richard Driver , who appeared for the prosecution , told the court that " the inmates of the Pavilion who had initiated the disturbance , including a well @-@ known bookmaker of Victoria who was at the time ejected , had had their fees of membership returned to them , and they would never again be admitted to the ground " . The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the two men " expressed regret for what had occurred , and pleaded guilty " and " the Bench fined them 40 shillings , and to pay 21 shillings professional costs of the court " . Despite initial cynicism from journalists , the NSWCA announced a crackdown on betting on cricket matches , and it was reported that over the next 10 years , gambling at cricket matches in Sydney mainly died out . 
 = = = Impact on later tours = = = 
 In 1880 , an Australian side captained by Billy Murdoch toured England . The tourists had difficulty finding good opponents ; most county sides turned them down , although Yorkshire played two unofficial matches against them . There was a lot of bad will , exacerbated by the Australians ' arrival in England at short notice , to some extent unexpectedly . This was heightened by an English perception that the Australians came frequently to maximise their profits ; at the time , professionalism was frowned upon . In his autobiography Lord Harris wrote , " They asked no @-@ one 's goodwill in the matter , and it was felt this was a discourteous way of bursting in on our arrangements ; and the result was they played scarcely any counties and were not generally recognised ... We felt we had to make a protest against too frequent visits " . Harris initially shunned the team and tried to avoid correspondence and meetings with them . An attempt to arrange a game against an English XI for the Cricketers ' Fund was turned down , and public advertisements in the newspapers were shunned . W.G. Grace was sympathetic to the Australians and felt that they were not to blame for the riot . He attempted to arrange a game for them at Lord 's , but was rebuffed by the Marylebone Cricket Club , who gave the excuse that the ground was not available . 
 Despite it being Murdoch 's wicket that started the riot , the English public were more sympathetic towards him than Gregory , and although the Australians played against weak opposition , including many <unk> , they attracted large crowds , leading the counties to regret their decision to snub them . Eventually the secretary of Surrey , C. W. Alcock asked Lord Harris to put together a representative side to play the Australians , while Grace acted as a mediator . Luckily for the Australians , Lord Harris had a personal rapport with their captain Murdoch and leading player Spofforth , especially as they shared his antipathy towards throwing . An agreement was reached , and although Lord Harris was generous in agreeing to lead the side , three cricketers who played in the infamous Sydney game — Hornby , Emmett and Ulyett — refused to play . Harris assembled a strong team , which included the three Grace brothers and Australia , who had not faced strong opposition and were without star bowler Fred Spofforth , went down by five wickets in front of 45 @,@ 000 spectators . This game , later recognised as the fourth Test in history and the first to be played in England , is more important than its result , as the custom of cricket tours between England and Australia was cemented . Overall , the tour was a financial success and an effective exercise in mending relations ; the team were received by the Lord Mayor of London at the end of the tour and were given gifts . Profits were healthy and public awareness of the bilateral cricketing relationship increased .

 The story of 5 to 7 was inspired by a couple whom writer @-@ director Victor Levin met in France in 1987 . The couple had an open marriage ; each spouse had an extramarital lover and , according to Levin , " they were all terribly civilized with the arrangement " . After meeting the couple , Levin " filed away " the idea until he could work out how to incorporate it into a larger story . He conceived the complete plot after his children 's birth in the early 2000s . Levin wrote the first draft of the film in March 2007 . His agent at William Morris Endeavor introduced him to Julie Lynn , who read the script and agreed to produce it . In 2011 , Lynn partnered with Bonnie Curtis , who also became a producer on the film . The project remained in development for seven years due to difficulties in finding appropriately " box office @-@ eligible " actors whose schedules lined up . The budget was primarily financed by Demarest Films , with additional funding from private investors including Sam <unk> , David <unk> and Bill Johnson . 
 Levin approached Anton Yelchin to star in 5 to 7 after seeing the actor 's performance in the 2011 film Like Crazy . He wrote Yelchin a " beseeching " letter asking him to accept the role ; Yelchin never received the letter but nevertheless agreed to star in the film . In 2012 , it was announced that Diane Kruger had been cast as Yelchin 's lover , but she was later replaced by Bérénice Marlohe . Glenn Close was cast through Curtis and Lynn , who had produced Close 's 2011 film Albert Nobbs and remained close friends with her . The film also features cameo appearances from several prominent New Yorkers : civil rights activist Julian Bond , chef Daniel Boulud , the New York Philharmonic conductor Alan Gilbert and The New Yorker editor David Remnick . 
 Filming was originally scheduled to begin in February 2013 , but was delayed until May 2013 . The film was shot by cinematographer Arnaud Potier on an Arri Alexa camera in CinemaScope widescreen format . Levin and Potier decided to use minimalistic wide shots and long takes to avoid " reminding the audience that it 's a movie " with unnecessary cuts . Filming mainly took place on the Upper East Side of New York City . Specific filming locations included the Carlyle Hotel , the St. Regis Hotel , The Guggenheim , Fifth Avenue , Grand Army Plaza , Le Charlot restaurant and Crawford Doyle Booksellers . The only major location used outside of the Upper East Side was Brian 's apartment , which was filmed on 30th Street in Midtown Manhattan . Shots of plaques on Central Park benches are interspersed throughout the film ; Levin sent a group of interns to find interesting inscriptions on the benches in Central Park and selected about thirty that were filmed on the last day of shooting . The crew adopted a bench of their own whose plaque is shown at the end of the film 's credits . 
 Levin initially planned to use a jazz soundtrack but found classical music more apt after completing the filming . He hired Danny <unk> and Saunder <unk> to compose the film 's score , which consisted of two main melodies , one a waltz and the other a more classical theme .

 = Hotel Polen fire = 
 The Hotel Polen fire occurred on 9 May 1977 in Amsterdam , the Netherlands . The conflagration destroyed the Hotel Polen ( Hotel Poland ) , a five story hotel in the centre of the city which had been built in 1891 , as well as the furniture store on the ground level and a nearby bookstore . Many of the tourists who stayed at the hotel ( of whom the majority were Swedes ) jumped to their deaths trying to escape the flames . Upon their arrival , the fire department used a life net to help people escape , but not everyone could be saved . The incident resulted in 33 deaths and 21 severe injuries . The cause of the fire is unknown . 
 The hotel was located between the Kalverstraat ( no . 15 @-@ 17 ) and the Rokin ( no . 14 ) , near the present day Madame Tussauds . Its place is now occupied by the Rokin Plaza , which was originally an office building , today it houses several fashion shops . The Polish @-@ born artist <unk> Bien created a photographic installation based on the fire in 1986 , which compared it to the Holocaust . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the beginning of the 16th century , there was an inn on the site where the Hotel Polen was later located . At the end of the 18th century , the " <unk> <unk> " ( Polish Coffee House ) was established , which began offering guest accommodation in 1857 . In 1891 , the Hotel Polen was established by the " Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van het <unk> <unk> " ( Polish Coffee House Society ) , after the adjacent space on the Rokin was bought , and a building was constructed there which was possibly designed by the architect Pierre <unk> , who also designed the Amsterdam Central Station and the Rijksmuseum . Another source lists Eduard <unk> as the architect . The hotel was five stories high and on the ground level of the building a café @-@ restaurant was opened . 
 The Hotel Polen was once known as a fashionable place to stay . The café @-@ restaurant was closed at the end of 1974 and its location was subsequently rented to the furniture store Inden . The hotel remained open as a part of the <unk> Concern . 
 The building , including the load @-@ bearing elements , was constructed of wood . There were 10 fire extinguishers and 11 fire hoses in the hotel . Only a few escape routes had proper emergency lighting and directions to the emergency exits , and the hotel was also not on a hotline with the emergency centre of the fire department . The building had been inspected by the fire department , first in February 1976 , and later in the beginning of 1977 , after which the hotel 's management was notified in writing that there were severe fire safety defects . They issued a list of proposed improvements to be implemented by the hotel , such as complying with the building regulations and the regulations for residence facilities . 
 = = The fire = = 
 On the night of Sunday 8 May to Monday 9 May 1977 , about 100 people were staying in the Hotel Polen , including a large group of Swedish tourists . About 6 : 20 am , the hotel staff were preparing for breakfast service , when one of them noticed smoke that seemed to be coming from the freight elevator ( which had not been used since the café @-@ restaurant on the ground floor had closed the previous evening ) . The night porter was alerted . Contrary to instructions , he did not call the fire department immediately ; instead , he poured some buckets of water into the shaft , in an attempt to subdue the fire . By the time he decided to call the fire department , the hotel was filling with smoke . The night porter was unable to reach the phone at the front desk because the fire had already reached it . The porter then ran outside , where he stopped the driver of a laundry truck serving the hotel , and instructed him to drive to the Hotel <unk> to warn them and to call the fire department . 
 By 6 : 30 am the fire was spreading very quickly through the building , although from the outside nothing was visible . Because of the wooden construction , the building was soon engulfed in flames . The guests on the top level could not escape and stood panicked in the windows . When the fire reached the rooms of some guests , they leaped out of the windows to escape . At 6 : 42 the first large fire engine arrived . On the street there lay several dead and injured people , who had jumped from their hotel room windows . On the lower floor , the furniture store Inden was also on fire . The fire fighters tried to fold out a life net in the <unk> ( which runs between the Rokin and the Kalverstraat ) but the alley was too narrow for it . 
 On the front side , on the Rokin , the rescue operations of the fire department were also hampered . There were so many people standing on the window ledges screaming that the fire fighters did not know who to save first . Time was also lost because some people threw their luggage in the life net and then jumped into it themselves , causing injuries . Some people fell to the side of the net and were severely injured . Just before 7 : 00 am the part of the hotel which faced the Kalverstraat collapsed . The burning debris landed on the fire engine in the Kalverstraat , and the fire fighters barely escaped to safety . The nearby book store was also burned out and fires broke out in several buildings on the other side of the Kalverstraat , which were quickly brought under control . 
 At about 8 : 30 am the wooden construction of the main part of the building also burned through and collapsed . Despite the fact that there were still people in the building and more people were lying around the building severely injured , the fire fighters decided to withdraw . The fire department proceeded to extinguish the smoking debris , and at 9 : 30 am the fire was declared under control . The building 's collapse left a gaping hole ; of the hotel , the furniture store and the book store , almost nothing remained . 
 The disaster caused the deaths of 33 people : 32 tourists ( 17 of them were Swedes ) and the occupant of the apartment above the book store . Eighteen charred bodies were recovered from the debris . Thirteen people , who had jumped from windows , either died or were severely injured . Among the dead was the celebrated German concert musician and composer Walter Kraft , longtime organist of St. Mary 's Church , Lübeck . Of the 57 people who were injured , 21 had severe injuries . Two guests from the United States escaped without injury . 
 = = Possible cause = = 
 The cause of the fire could not be determined with certainty . One possibility is that a fire smouldered in the furniture store Inden under the hotel , and the opening of the elevator shaft in the morning provided an inflow of oxygen , causing the fire to spread . There is also a theory that the fire was set by burglars who tried to cover their tracks ; however , there was no evidence of a burglary . 
 The high number of casualties was a consequence of the wooden construction of the building , the poorly marked escape routes and the shortage of safety equipment .

 = Australia 31 – 0 American Samoa = 
 On 11 April 2001 , the Australian and American Samoa national association football teams played each other in a qualifying match for the 2002 FIFA World Cup . The match was played at the International Sports Stadium in Coffs Harbour , Australia . Australia set a world record for the largest victory in an international football match , winning the game 31 – 0 . Australia 's Archie Thompson also broke the record for most goals scored by a player in an international match by scoring 13 goals . David Zdrilic , the scorer of eight goals in the match , achieved the second highest number of goals in an international match since World War I. 
 The outcome of the match led to debates about the format of qualification tournaments , with the Australian manager Frank Farina and Thompson feeling that preliminary rounds should be introduced to avoid such unbalanced matches , views shared by the international footballing body FIFA . It eventually led to the introduction of a preliminary round in the Oceanian zone qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup . The unbalanced level of opponents also partly contributed to Australia 's move to the Asian Football Confederation in 2006 . 
 = = Background = = 
 The first attempt from Oceanian teams to qualify for the FIFA World Cup came with the 1966 FIFA World Cup . In subsequent tournaments they entered joint qualification competitions with the Asian zone , until a separate qualification round for the Oceania Football Confederation was introduced in 1986 . By the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification tournament , this had grown to a competition with ten teams entering . The ten teams were divided into two groups of five teams , where each team played against each other once . The two group winners would advance to the final round and played against each other in a home and away format . The winner of Oceania would advance to the intercontinental play @-@ off round against the fifth best team in the South American zone for a place in the World Cup . Australia and American Samoa were placed in Group 1 along with Fiji , Samoa and Tonga with the matches to be played at Coffs Harbour , Australia during April 2001 . 
 Australia , along with New Zealand , were widely recognized as the strongest teams in the Oceanian zone . They were the only teams to have won the OFC Nations Cup , and the only ones to have qualified for the World Cup : Australia had qualified in 1974 and New Zealand in 1982 . American Samoa were one of the weakest teams in the world , having lost all of their official international matches since they had joined FIFA in 1998 . Prior to the match , Australia was ranked 75th in the FIFA World Rankings , while American Samoa was ranked 203rd , the lowest of all FIFA members . 
 Two days before the match , Australia recorded a 22 – 0 win over Tonga , breaking the previous record for the largest win in an international match , held by Kuwait who won 20 – 0 against Bhutan in 2000 . American Samoa had suffered two losses prior to the match , a 13 – 0 loss to Fiji and an 8 – 0 loss to Samoa . 
 = = Match summary = = 
 Australia fielded a team with several rarely used players as many regulars were either rested or omitted from the team . Strikers John <unk> and Damian Mori who combined for 10 goals in the 22 – 0 win over Tonga were also omitted for this match . The American Samoa team were troubled by passport issues , with only one member of their original 20 @-@ man senior team , goalkeeper Nicky <unk> , eligible to play . Some hint that the passport issue was an Australian ploy to win the match by a large margin in order to secure the team 's move to the AFC . American Samoa were also unable to call their under @-@ 20 players because most of them were involved in high school exams at the time . They were forced to draft in their youth players , including three 15 @-@ year @-@ old players , to put together a makeshift team with an average age of 18 . According to team manager and Football Federation American Samoa vice @-@ president Tony <unk> , some of the Samoan players had never played a full 90 @-@ minute game before the match with Australia . 
 American Samoa held Australia scoreless for the first ten minutes of play until Con Boutsianis scored Australia 's first goal from a corner kick . Archie Thompson scored his first goal in the 12th minute , and his strike partner , David Zdrilic , added his first goal a minute later . Tony <unk> added two successive goals in the 17th and 19th minute to extend Australia 's lead into 6 – 0 . In the 25th minute , Zdrilic achieved a hat @-@ trick , making the score 9 – 0 for Australia . Thompson then scored 6 of the next 7 goals as Australia led 16 – 0 at half time . Thompson led Australia in scoring with 8 goals at half @-@ time , and Zdrilic had 4 goals . 
 Boutsianis , who scored the first goal of the first half , scored the first goal of the second half in the 50th minute . Boutsianis later added another goal to complete his hat @-@ trick . Thompson and Zdrilic added 5 and 4 goals to finish with 13 and 8 goals respectively . Boutsianis finished with 3 goals , while <unk> , Aurelio Vidmar and Simon Colosimo scored 2 goals each , and substitute Fausto De <unk> scored one goal . In the 86th minute , despite being down by 29 goals , American Samoa managed to launch an attack towards Australia 's goal when Pati <unk> had a shot , which was saved by Michael Petkovic . That was American Samoa 's first and only shot on goal . 
 The large number of goals created a confusion over the correct scoreline . At the end of the match , the scoreboard at the stadium showed 32 – 0 and Thompson was credited with 14 goals . After the statistician did a recount , the 31 – 0 scoreline was announced , and Thompson 's total goals count was reduced to 13 . After the match , FIFA went on to release the official statistics after receiving the official report from the referee and match officials , which confirmed the 31 – 0 scoreline and Thompson 's 13 goals . 
 = = = Details = = = 
 = = Records = = 
 Australia 's 31 – 0 win broke the record for the largest win in an international match . The previous record was Australia 's 22 – 0 win over Tonga , recorded two days earlier in the same competition . Both wins surpassed the previous record held by Kuwait in a 20 – 0 win over Bhutan in the 2000 Asian Cup qualification . The match also broke the record for the largest win in a World Cup qualification match . The previous record was held by Iran in a 19 – 0 win over Guam in 2002 World Cup qualification . The match also broke the friendly match record set by North Korea against Guam 21 @-@ 0 . 
 Apart from team records , individual records were also broken in the match . Australia 's Archie Thompson , who only had two international caps and one international goal prior to the match , scored 13 goals in the match and broke the record for most goals scored in an international match . David Zdrilic scored 8 goals and was widely reported as having recorded the second most goals scored in an international match , after Thompson 's 13 goals . In fact , his figure was less than the previous record of 10 goals , which was achieved by Denmark 's Sophus Nielsen at the 1908 Olympics and Germany 's Gottfried Fuchs at the 1912 Olympics . Nevertheless , this made Zdrilic 's total the second highest in almost 90 years . Thompson also equalled the world record for most goals scored in a recognized senior match , set in 1885 when John Petrie scored 13 goals in Arbroath 's 36 – 0 win over Bon Accord in a Scottish Cup tournament . The previous record in a World Cup qualifying match was seven goals and was jointly held by another Australian , Gary Cole , who scored seven goals against Fiji in the 1982 World Cup qualification on 14 August 1981 , and Iranian Karim <unk> , who also scored seven goals against Maldives in the 1998 World Cup qualification on 2 June 1997 . 
 = = Match reactions = = 
 Australia 's manager Frank Farina criticised the qualification format and questioned the need for these kind of matches . Archie Thompson , who scored a record @-@ setting 13 goals , was delighted with his record , but he also agreed with Farina 's comments . FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper agreed with both comments and suggested a change in the qualification format , with the smaller teams entering a preliminary round . However , Oceania Football Confederation chairman Basil <unk> , opposed both comments and claimed that the smaller teams have the right to face Australia and New Zealand , similar to Australia having the rights to face stronger opponents such as Brazil and France . 
 " Breaking the world record is a dream come true for me ; that sort of thing doesn 't come along every day . But you have to look at the teams we are playing and start asking questions . We don 't need to play these games . " 
 This match and the other lopsided victories in the qualification partially contributed towards the reintroduction of a preliminary round for smaller teams in the qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup , in order to avoid these one @-@ sided matches . The significant gap between the two top teams , Australia and New Zealand , and the rest of the teams in the Oceanian zone was one of the reasons behind Australia leaving the Oceania Football Confederation at the end of 2006 to join Asian Football Confederation in order to increase the competitiveness . Starting in the 2010 World Cup qualification , Australia participated in the Asian zone qualification rounds . 
 The Samoan team was not feeling downhearted after the game , and even embraced and sang to the audience as the game finished . <unk> declared that he enjoyed the game . " I wasn 't embarrassed because we all learned something from it . If we had all our players maybe it would have been only five or six goals , because I was without my best defenders and there was nothing I could do . " Tony <unk> also defended the goalkeeper , saying that he " kept the score down with a magnificent display " . He also added that " now we are recognised by FIFA , it has really helped spark an interest in football on the islands " . Samoan manager <unk> Lui commented that football was being played in the Samoan elementary and high schools and " in five years we will be competitive . "

 = Action of 9 November 1822 = 
 The Action of 9 November 1822 was a naval battle fought between the United States Navy schooner USS Alligator and a squadron of three piratical schooners off the coast of Cuba during the US Navy 's West Indies Anti @-@ Piracy Operation . Fifteen leagues from Matanzas , Cuba , a large band of pirates captured several vessels and held them for ransom . Upon hearing of the pirate attacks , the Alligator under Lieutenant William Howard Allen rushed to the scene to rescue the vessels and seize the pirates . 
 Upon arriving at the bay where the pirates were said to be , USS Alligator dispatched boats to engage the enemy vessels , as the water was too shallow for the US warship to engage them herself . With Allen personally commanding one of the boats , the Americans assaulted the piratical schooner Revenge . Although the Navy was able to force the pirates into abandoning Revenge , the buccaneers managed to fight their way out of the bay and inflict heavy casualties , including Allen . With their commander mortally wounded , the boats ceased pursuit of the pirates but managed to recover the vessels that had been held in the bay . 
 = = Background = = 
 In early November 1822 , the schooner USS Alligator , under the command of Lieutenant William Allen , put in to Matanzas , Cuba , intending to patrol the area as part of the United States Navy 's West Indian Anti @-@ Piracy Campaign . Upon arriving at the port , Allen discovered two Americans attempting to raise $ 7 @,@ 000 in order to pay a ransom to a band of pirates that had captured their vessels . If the ransom was not delivered , the pirates threatened to destroy the ships and rough up their crews . Learning from these men that the pirates were holed up some 15 leagues away , Allen took the civilians aboard and decided to make an attempt at recovering their ship from the buccaneers . 
 The band of pirates was relatively large , consisting of around 125 men and three armed schooners . One schooner , Revenge , was an 80 @-@ ton vessel armed with five cannon and 35 men ; a second , 90 @-@ ton schooner had six guns and 30 men ; a third vessel displaced 60 @-@ tons , was armed with three cannon and manned by 60 men . In addition to their armed vessels , the pirates also had in their possession five American prizes . These were the ship rigged vessel William Henry from New York , the brigs Iris and Sarah <unk> from Boston , and a pair of merchant schooners with one hailing from Rochester and the other Salem . 
 Allen 's force of 100 was outnumbered by the pirates and also outgunned , with Alligator mounting only 12 six pounders compared to the pirates ' 14 cannons . Despite being outnumbered , Alligator and her crew were experienced veterans , having taken the Portuguese brig Marianna Flora the year before in a bloody action . Allen himself was also an experienced commander who had taken command of USS Argus during her engagement with HMS Pelican in the War of 1812 . Though Alligator 's draft was too deep to chase pirate craft inshore , if need be , she could send her cutter , gig , and launch out with boarding parties to engage the pirates . 
 = = Action = = 
 As Revenge was the nearest of the three pirate vessels to the Americans , Allen ordered Alligator 's boats lowered to run inshore and attack her . Some 40 men armed with small arms were put into the boats , with Allen personally taking command of the launch , Lieutenant Dale the cutter , and Midshipman Henley the gig . Revenge was already underway by the time it was sighted and attempted to escape the Americans despite the lack of wind , using its sweeps . After the American boats had rowed about 10 miles ( 16 km ) , the piratical schooner made an about @-@ face and raised a red flag . Upon approaching the piratical schooner , the American craft were fired on with both grape and roundshot . The American boats returned fire with small arms and moved in to board the vessel . Rather than try to fight off the boarding attempt , the pirates abandoned Revenge while another schooner covered their escape . Alligator 's gig manned by Henley and four men was sent off to take Revenge as a prize . 
 Allen then set off with the other two boats in an attempt to seize the schooner which had helped Revenge 's crew escape . This second schooner maintained a heavy fire upon the advancing American boats , and Alligator 's cutter soon lagged behind as it had taken heavy casualties and had trouble manning its oars . Allen attempted to rally his men by standing up and waving them forward . In doing so Allen exposed himself and was struck by musket fire , taking a round first in the head and then in the chest . With their commander mortally wounded and their crew taking heavy casualties , the American boats withdrew , thus allowing the second piratical schooner as well as a third that had not been engaged , to escape . The vessels the pirates had seized were left behind and recovered by the Americans after the action had ended . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 By the end of the action , the American boats were all damaged and their crews suffered four killed and three wounded . Allen was among the former and died some four hours after the battle ended . Despite the fact that they had escaped , the pirates also suffered heavy casualties , with 14 bodies being counted by the Americans at the end of the action in addition to several buccaneers that were presumed drowned . Alligator returned to Matanzas with the recovered prizes ; there Allen was buried with an escort provided by the local governor . 
 Alligator left Matanzas on 18 November escorting her prizes back to the United States . The following day , she ran hard aground on a coral reef in the Florida Keys , which has since been named Alligator Reef . Her crew failed to refloat the vessel , but managed to salvage her guns , papers , and other valuables . Fearing that she would be salvaged by pirates , they burnt her and she sank . Though it was previously thought that the location of the wreck was known , a 1996 expedition proved this false and Alligator 's exact final resting place remains unknown . Allen was regarded by the Navy as a hero for his efforts against the pirates and his name would be used as a rallying cry the following year when USS <unk> and USS Mosquito engaged and defeated a band of pirates led by <unk> near the same area where the American lieutenant had been slain . 
 = Guam Highway 1 = 
 Guam Highway 1 ( GH @-@ 1 ) , also known as Marine Corps Drive , is one of the primary automobile routes in the United States territory of Guam . It runs in a southwest @-@ to @-@ northeast direction , from the main gate of Naval Base Guam in the western community of Santa Rita in a general northeasterly direction to the main gate of Andersen Air Force Base in the community of Yigo . It passes through Guam 's capital , Hagåtña , as well as intersecting various other territorial highways . Along its route , the highway runs through tropical forest areas , urbanized commercial areas , and residential neighborhoods . The US Military built the road starting in 1941 . Construction ceased with the Japanese invasion in December 1941 and resumed in 1944 . The highway was formally dedicated to the US Marines by the territorial governor in 2004 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 GH @-@ 1 begins near the entrance gate to Naval Base Guam , at a junction with GH @-@ 2A . Known as Marine Corps Drive , the route then travels to the northeast through tropical forests along Apra Harbor to the town of Piti . After passing through Piti , the drive runs along <unk> Beach before turning inland near Asan Point . The road passes the US Naval Hospital and Asan Point ; then it runs parallel to the coast along Asan Memorial Beach through the community of Asan . Soon thereafter , Marine Corps Drive cuts a path due east towards the Island 's capital , Hagåtña where it passes through the northern edge of the city . In this area , GH @-@ 1 runs through commercial areas parallel to the West <unk> Beach Front area . The drive passes the Paseo de Susana before following Trinchera Beach northeasterly through town . 
 After passing through the capital and the community of <unk> , the road turns towards the northeast as it skirts to the west of Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport on its way through the village of <unk> . After the airport , the highway runs inland from the shoreline through the neighborhood of Tumon . It runs northeasterly around the Micronesia Mall before turning southeasterly through residential areas as it cuts across the southern edges of <unk> . It runs to the south of the Guam International Country Club and to the north of the Andersen Air Force Base 's southern unit . Through this area , the north side of the highway is residential areas , and the south side is tropical forests . Marine Corps Drive passes the War Dead Cemetery and turns northeasterly residential areas on both sides of the roadway through Yigo before reaching its terminus at Salisbury Junction , the main entrance to the Air Force Base , where the road continues to the northwest as GH @-@ 9 . 
 Like most major highways on Guam , a 35 mph ( 56 km / h ) speed limit is posted throughout most of its length . In the past , GH @-@ 1 was one of the few roads to post a 45 mph ( 72 km / h ) limit on lengths of less @-@ developed roadway . However , as more of the area became developed , certain sections of the roads were posted with lower limits . Travelers heading north away from the developed areas are allowed a 45 mph ( 72 km / h ) speed limit . However , the southbound lanes on the same sections remain posted at 35 mph ( 56 km / h ) due to development on the western side of the road . 
 = = History = = 
 The United States Military began to develop and construct roads on the island in 1941 . Some roads had existed prior to this , but improvements were beginning to take shape . Only one road , which encircled most of the island , had been graded . It was the primary route linking Agana ( the name of the capital at the time ) to Piti and Asan . This was the foundation for Marine Corps Drive . After the Japanese invasion , little infrastructure improvements were made by the occupiers . Road construction resumed by the US Military after the island was invaded in 1944 . In 60 days , a 12 @-@ mile ( 19 km ) , four @-@ lane super @-@ highway with nine bridges was built after the invasion . The remainder of the roadway was built and numbered under the local administration after Guam was given civil government in 1950 . 
 Named Marine Corps Drive throughout its length , it was known as simply Marine Drive until the road was rededicated by Governor Felix Perez Camacho in 2004 . In 2012 , the <unk> has started to install LED streetlights along Marine Corps Drive . At the same time , construction has started to replace the Agana Bridge along GH @-@ 1 .

 = Rail transport in Vatican City = 
 Rail transport in Vatican City consists of two 300 @-@ metre sets of rail tracks and two freight sidings within Vatican City ( named Vatican Railway , <unk> Vaticana ) , the shortest national railway system in the world , with only one station . Access to Italian rail lines was guaranteed by the Lateran Treaty ( 1929 ) , and tracks and station were constructed during the reign of Pope Pius XI . The only station is referred to as Vatican City ( officially : Città del Vaticano [ <unk> del <unk> ] , also named Stazione Vaticana [ <unk> <unk> ] ) . 
 Most railway traffic consists of freight good importation , although the railway has occasionally carried passengers , usually for symbolic or ceremonial reasons . 
 = = History = = 
 Pope Gregory XVI ( died 1846 ) prevented the construction of railways in the Papal States , and was reputed to have said " chemin de fer , chemin d 'enfer " ( " road of iron , road of hell " ) . Gregory XVI 's successor , Pope Pius IX , began the construction of a rail line from Bologna to Ancona but the territory was seized by the armies of the Risorgimento in 1861 before it was completed . The utility of rail travel for the mass pilgrimages of the 19th century , beginning with those at Lourdes circa 1858 , was one factor that softened opposition to such technology within the Roman Curia . 
 The construction of a railway station in Vatican City and its linkage to the Italian rail lines was guaranteed by the Lateran Treaty of February 11 , 1929 . The Directorate of New Railway Construction of the Ministry of Public Works of the Kingdom of Italy implemented this provision with construction beginning on April 3 , 1929 , to establish earthworks 38 m above sea level ( the height of the " Roma - San Pietro " station ) between Piazza Santa Marta and the Palazzo del <unk> . The construction of the viaduct leading to Vatican City was paid for by the Italian government ; the station within the Vatican was financed from the ₤ 750 million indemnity agreed to in the Lateran Treaty 's financial part . The total cost of construction was reported to be ₤ 24 million . 
 The station building ( see below ) was constructed between 1929 and 1933 . 
 The first locomotive entered the Vatican in March 1932 . The station was opened officially on October 2 , 1934 . A Railway Convention was ratified between Italy and Vatican City on September 12 , 1934 , on which date the property passed from <unk> dello Stato ( Italian State Railways ) to the Holy See . In October 1934 the Ministry of Public Works gave the completed rail lines to Vatican City and <unk> dello Stato , respectively . Legge <unk> <unk> del <unk> ( June 7 , 1929 ) made Italian railway legislation binding on Vatican @-@ controlled railways . 
 In late March 1944 , during the allied bombing of Rome in World War II , the Vatican discovered a German munitions train stopped on the line by the Vatican railway station . 
 Pope John XXIII , on October 4 , 1962 , became the first pope to use the Vatican railway during his pilgrimage to Loreto and Assisi one week before the beginning of Second Vatican Council using the Italian presidential train ; the trip was broadcast on the Eurovision Network . Prior to John 's trip in 1962 , Pope Pius IX had been both the last pope to visit Loreto ( as the head of the Papal States ) and the last pope to travel by train . John XXIII also arranged for the remains of Pope Pius X to be transferred to Venice using the Vatican railway . 
 Pope John Paul II used the railway a few times for symbolic purposes , as early as November 8 , 1979 , but did not use the railway to leave Rome until January 24 , 2002 . 
 On 21 May 2011 , a special train ran from Vatican City station to commemorate the 60th Anniversary of Caritas . 
 Pope Benedict XVI used the railway as well ( e.g. , for a pilgrimage to Assisi on 27 October 2011 ) . 
 Pope Francis 's desire to open the Church 's treasures to the public has resulted in a weekly special train from Vatican City Station that is open to the public and is provided by the Vatican Museums and the Italian railway . A special train for invited guests and reporters inaugurated the run with on 11 September 2015 . This inaugural train was hauled by FS Class 625 steam locomotive 625 @-@ 017 , built in 1915 . The same engine was used by the Italian royal family , and also hauled the train which carried Pope John XXIII to Loreto and Assisi in 1962 . Scheduled trains use contemporary suburban rolling stock to travel from Vatican City railway station to Albano Laziale , via Castel Gandolfo . 
 = = Railway station = = 
 The Vatican City railway station ( in Italian , Stazione Città del Vaticano or Stazione Vaticana ) is the only railway station of the Vatican Railway . It was built approximately 20 m from the Entrance Gateway by architect Giuseppe Momo . Construction began on April 3 , 1929 , and the station began operation in 1933 . Its simple white , Italian marble design was described by writer H. V. Morton as " more like a branch of the Barclay Bank in London . " The station building is composed of white marble , and its dimensions are 61 x 21 @.@ 5 m . The central body is 16 @.@ 85 m tall and the lateral ones 5 @.@ 95 m . Part of the station building continues in use as passenger station and goods ( rail freight ) office , whilst part now houses the Vatican numismatic and philatelic museum . The railway station also houses the small Vatican tax @-@ free department store , a private facility open only to Vatican subjects and diplomats . 
 = = Route = = 
 The Vatican City State Railway branches off from the Rome to Viterbo railway line at the Roma San Pietro railway station and crosses <unk> valley via a 143 @.@ 12 metre long masonry viaduct of eight 15 @.@ 30 metre arches ( bearing the Fasces and the Savoy Coat of Arms ) , which crosses Viale Vaticano ( which it interrupts ) and Via Aurelia . The Via delle Cave and the Via del <unk> are also interrupted by the viaduct and thus merge with the Via Aurelia . 
 Before passing through the Vatican City walls and terminating in the Vatican City railway station , the line passes under an arch decorated with the Coat of Arms of Pope Pius XI with a two @-@ piece 35 @.@ 5 ton iron gate which slides into the recesses of the Vatican walls . The gate is closed when there is no traffic scheduled on the line . 
 The railway has two tracks ( partly located in Rome , outside the gateway ) , but only one is served by a station platform . Two terminal load tracks , for freight wagons , are situated on the northeast side of the building . They are linked to the main track that ends in a <unk> in a tunnel . 
 The station is near the Vatican Gardens , behind St. Peter 's Basilica . The gateway separating the station from rail track in Italian territory is part of Leonine Wall . Other buildings near the station are the <unk> Palace and the Domus Sanctae <unk> . 
 = = Uses = = 
 The Vatican railway has been used primarily for importing goods ( before automobile travel became more common and less expensive ) into the Vatican and intermittently for ordinary passenger trains . 
 The planned papal train of Pius XI was never constructed and the Vatican has never employed any railway workers or registered any rolling stock . The official train of Pope Pius IX remains on display at the Museum of Rome in the Palazzo Braschi . 
 The Vatican City station has no regularly scheduled passenger trains . Pope Francis 's desire to open the Church 's treasures to the public has resulted in a weekly special train from Vatican City Station that is open to the public and is provided by the Vatican Museums and the Italian railway . Starting from September 12 , 2015 , on each Saturday , visitors to the Vatican Museums can board a train and travel to the Pontifical Villas in Castel Gandolfo . There , passengers can tour the newly created museum and visit the pontifical gardens as well as visit the town . The tour returns the same afternoon to the station of Roma San Pietro . The trains use contemporary suburban rolling stock to travel from Vatican City railway station to Albano Laziale , via Castel Gandolfo .

 = Expedition 1 = 
 Expedition 1 was the first long @-@ duration stay on the International Space Station ( ISS ) . The three @-@ person crew stayed aboard the station for 136 days , from November 2000 to March 2001 . It was the beginning of an uninterrupted human presence on the station which continues as of July 2016 . Expedition 2 , which also had three crew members , immediately followed Expedition 1 . 
 The official start of the expedition occurred when the crew docked to the station on 2 November 2000 , aboard the Russian spacecraft Soyuz TM @-@ 31 , which had launched two days earlier . During their mission , the Expedition 1 crew activated various systems on board the station , unpacked equipment that had been delivered , and hosted three visiting Space Shuttle crews and two unmanned Russian Progress resupply vehicles . The crew was very busy throughout the mission , which was declared a success . 
 The three visiting Space Shuttles brought equipment , supplies , and key components of the space station . The first of these , STS @-@ 97 , docked in early December 2000 , and brought the first pair of large U.S. photovoltaic arrays , which increased the station 's power capabilities fivefold . The second visiting shuttle mission was STS @-@ 98 , which was docked in mid @-@ February 2001 , delivered the US $ 1 @.@ 4 billion research module Destiny , which increased the mass of the station beyond that of Mir for the first time . Mid @-@ March 2001 saw the final shuttle visit of the expedition , STS @-@ 102 , whose main purpose was to exchange the Expedition 1 crew with the next three @-@ person long @-@ duration crew , Expedition 2 . The expedition ended when Discovery undocked from the station on 18 March 2001 . 
 The Expedition 1 crew consisted of an American commander and two Russians . The commander , Bill Shepherd , had been in space three times before , all on shuttle missions which lasted at most a week . The Russians , Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei K. Krikalev , both had previous long @-@ duration spaceflights on Mir , with Krikalev having spent over a full year in space . 
 = = Crew = = 
 The commander , Bill Shepherd , was a former Navy SEAL , whose only spaceflights were on shuttle missions , and at the beginning of the mission his total time in space was about two weeks . Questions had been raised by the Russian space agency about the choice of Shepherd as mission commander due to his lack of experience . Flight engineer Sergei Krikalev had spent over a year in orbit , mostly on Mir , and would become the first person to visit the ISS twice . He had felt excitement to have been one of the first people to enter the Zarya module ( the first component of the space station ) in 1998 , during STS @-@ 88 , and was looking forward to returning . Yuri Gidzenko was designated commander and pilot of the two @-@ day Soyuz mission to the station , had one previous spaceflight , which was a 180 @-@ day stay aboard Mir . 
 Shepherd was only the second U.S. astronaut to be launched in a Russian spacecraft , the first being Norman Thagard , who launched on Soyuz TM @-@ 21 to visit Mir in 1995 . Shepherd expected one of the biggest challenges for the ISS would be the compatibility of technologies , such as that between Russian and U.S. technologies . 
 = = Backup Crew = = 
 = = Background = = 
 The first component of the space station was the Zarya module , which was launched unmanned in November 1998 . Following this launch , and prior to Expedition 1 , there were five manned Space Shuttle flights and two unmanned Russian flights to the ISS . Some of these flights delivered large modules , such as the pressurized Unity and Zvezda modules , and the first piece of the Integrated Truss Structure . The manned flights were used for partial assembly of the ISS , as well as to start unpacking the supplies and equipment that were being delivered . Prior to Expedition 1 , Krikalev expected the ISS to be very similar to his experience on Mir ten years previous , due to the physical similarities of the stations ' components . 
 The launch of the Expedition 1 crew occurred a week before the United States presidential election , so it got little attention in the United States . At the time of the mission , the station was expected to be completed in 2006 , and be continuously inhabited until at least 2015 . Due to several delays , including the fallout from the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster , the station was completed in late 2011 , thanks to STS @-@ 134 .

 The crew of three were on board the International Space Station for four and a half months , from early November 2000 to mid @-@ March 2001 . Major events during this time include the three @-@ week @-@ long Space Shuttle visits , which occurred in early December , mid @-@ February , and at the end of the expedition in March . 
 = = = Launch and docking = = = 
 The three @-@ member Expedition 1 crew successfully launched on 31 October 2000 , at 07 : 52 UTC , atop a Soyuz @-@ U rocket on Soyuz TM @-@ 31 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan ; they used launch pad Gagarin 's Start , from which the first human to fly in space , Yuri Gagarin , was launched in 1961 . After 33 orbits of the Earth , and a series of rendezvous maneuvers performed by Gidzenko , they docked the Soyuz capsule to the aft port of the Zvezda Service Module on 2 November 2000 , at 09 : 21 UTC . Ninety minutes after docking , Shepherd opened the hatch to Zvezda and the crew members entered the complex . 
 Alpha 
 At the end of the first day on the station , Shepherd requested the use of the radio call sign " Alpha " , which he and Krikalev preferred it to the more cumbersome " International Space Station " . The name " Alpha " had previously been used for the station in the early 90 's , and following the request , its use was authorized for the whole of Expedition 1 . Shepherd had been advocating the use of a new name to project managers for some time . Referencing a naval tradition in a pre @-@ launch news conference he had said : " For thousands of years , humans have been going to sea in ships . People have designed and built these vessels , launched them with a good feeling that a name will bring good fortune to the crew and success to their voyage . " Yuri Semenov , the President of Russian Space Corporation Energia at the time , disapproved of the name " Alpha " ; he felt that Mir was the first space station , and so he would have preferred the names " Beta " or " Mir 2 " for the ISS . 
 = = = First month = = = 
 In their first weeks on board , the Expedition 1 crew members activated critical life support systems and computer control , as well as unpacked supplies left behind for them by previous supply missions . At this time the station did not have enough electricity to heat all three pressurized modules , so Unity was left unused and unheated . Unity had been used for the past two years to allow U.S. flight controllers to command ISS systems and read station system data . 
 The Russian unmanned resupply spacecraft Progress M1 @-@ 4 docked to the station on 18 November . The Progress spacecraft 's automatic docking system failed , necessitating a manual docking controlled by Gidzenko using the TORU docking system . Although manual dockings are routine , they have caused some concern among flight controllers since an attempt in 1997 which resulted in the spacecraft colliding with Mir , causing significant damage . 
 The astronauts had a heavy workload in the first month , as Shepherd told reporters in a space @-@ to @-@ ground interview : " To me , the biggest challenge is trying to pack 30 hours into an 18 @-@ hour work day . " Some of the early tasks took longer than scheduled . For example , the activation of a food warmer in Zvezda 's galley was scheduled for 30 minutes , but it took the astronauts a day and a half to turn it on . 
 = = = STS @-@ 97 = = = 
 Endeavour docked with the ISS on 2 December 2000 , on mission STS @-@ 97 , bringing four more Americans and a Canadian temporarily to the station . The shuttle also brought the first pair of U.S. provided photovoltaic arrays , which would provide crucial electricity for further development of the station . In total , STS @-@ 97 brought 17 tons of equipment to the ISS , which also included expandable metal girders , batteries , electronics and cooling equipment . 
 Three spacewalks were conducted by the crew of STS @-@ 97 , all of which were completed prior to opening the hatch between shuttle and station . On 8 December , the hatch between the two was opened and the two crews greeted each other for the first time . It had remained closed to maintain their respective atmospheric pressures . The Expedition 1 crew took this opportunity to leave the station and tour the inside of the space shuttle , which was thought to be good for their psychological well @-@ being . 
 Progress M1 @-@ 4 
 Prior to Endeavour docking , the Russian resupply spacecraft Progress M1 @-@ 4 , which came to the station in mid @-@ November , was undocked to make room for the space shuttle . This Progress spacecraft remained undocked for the duration of STS @-@ 97 , parked in orbit about a mile away from the station . It docked manually again with the station on 26 December by Gidzenko , after Endeavour left . The automatic docking system for this Progress spacecraft had failed on the first docking in November . The crew spent much of the following week unloading the Progress spacecraft . 
 Christmas and New Year 
 On Christmas Day , the Expedition 1 crew were given the day off work . They opened presents delivered by Endeavour and the Progress supply ship . They also each took turns speaking to their families . In the following days they did several video downlinks , some with Russian TV stations . The crew had a quiet New Year . Citing a Naval tradition , for the New Year 's entry of the station 's log , Shepherd provided a poem on behalf of the crew . 
 = = = STS @-@ 98 = = = 
 On 9 February 2001 , Space Shuttle Atlantis docked to the ISS , bringing the five American crew members of STS @-@ 98 temporarily to the station . The mission was originally planned for mid @-@ January , but was delayed due to NASA 's concerns about some cables on the shuttles . This mission brought the U.S. built Destiny laboratory , which has a mass of 16 short tons . It was installed with the use of the shuttle 's robotic Canadarm , controlled by Marsha Ivins . Astronauts Thomas D. Jones and Robert L. <unk> helped with the installation during a spacewalk . The Destiny module had a cost of US $ 1 @.@ 4 billion , and would be used primarily for scientific research . During the spacewalk an ammonia coolant leak created a contamination scare , which happened when <unk> was hooking up coolant lines to Destiny . The other two spacewalks went ahead without any problems . While the Shuttle was docked , the control of the station 's orientation was switched from propellants to electrically powered gyroscopes , which had been installed in September 2000 . The gyroscopes had not been used earlier due to the lack of key navigational electronics . 
 By the end of STS @-@ 98 , the crew of Expedition 1 had been on the station for over three months , and Shepherd stated that he was " ready to come home " . NASA used several techniques to prevent the three crew members from suffering the effects of the " three @-@ month wall " psychological barrier , which had caused depression in previous astronauts . For example , they allowed more time for the crew to speak to their families via videophone , and they also encouraged them to watch movies and listen to music they like . 
 Progress M @-@ 44 
 On 28 February the third Progress spacecraft to visit the ISS , Progress M @-@ 44 , docked to the Zvezda module . It brought air , food , rocket fuel and other equipment . It remained docked until Expedition 2 , when it was intentionally burnt up during atmospheric reentry , like all Progress spacecraft . 
 = = = STS @-@ 102 = = = 
 Space Shuttle Discovery docked on 10 March 2001 , bringing to the ISS the new long @-@ duration three @-@ person crew of Expedition 2 , as well as four short @-@ term crew members of STS @-@ 102 . A few hours after docking , the hatch opened , and all ten astronauts greeted each other , setting a new record for the number people simultaneously in the ISS . The day after docking , American astronauts Jim Voss and Susan Helms began a spacewalk which ended up being nearly nine hours long , and still holds the record for the longest spacewalk ever performed , as of August 2010 . The length of the spacewalk was partially due to some mistakes , including Voss accidentally releasing a small tool . Unable to retrieve it , NASA engineers tracked the tool , and decided to use Discovery 's thrusters on 14 March to boost the station four kilometers higher , to ensure the ISS would not collide with the piece of space debris . 
 Transferring expedition crews 
 By 14 March , the expedition crews had completed the change over , but until the shuttle undocked , Shepherd officially remained commander of the station . The morning of the 14th the astronauts ' wake @-@ up call was the song " Should I Stay or Should I Go " by The Clash , at the request of Shepherd 's wife . Shepherd , a former Navy SEAL , said during the change over ceremony : " May the good will , spirit and sense of mission we had enjoyed on board endure . Sail her well . " The commander of Discovery , Jim Wetherbee , said " " For Captain Shepherd and his crew , we hold you in admiration as we prepare to bring you home . This has been an arduous duty for you . This ship was not built in a safe harbor . It was built on the high seas . " 
 = = = <unk> and landing = = = 
 The crew 's four and a half @-@ month tour aboard the ISS officially ended on 18 March 2001 , when Discovery undocked . The Expedition 1 crew returned home to Earth on STS @-@ 102 , landing on 21 March 2001 , on a rare night landing at 2 : 30 am local time . Two days after the landing , coincidentally , Mir was intentionally burned up during atmospheric reentry , ending its 15 years in orbit . 
 = = Daily activities = = 
 In a typical day , each crew member divided his time between physical exercise , station assembly and maintenance , experiments , communications with ground personnel , personal time , and bio @-@ needs activities ( such as rest and eating ) . The crew 's daily schedule usually operated on UTC ; for example , a typical morning had been scheduled to begin with an electronic wake @-@ up tone at about 05 : 00 UTC . But during the expedition , a more typical wake @-@ up time was actually between 06 : 00 and 07 : 00 UTC . The crew 's sleep habits were sometimes shifted to accommodate the schedules of visiting shuttles or resupply vehicles . 
 Following the wake @-@ up call , the crew was given some time to clean up , have breakfast , and read e @-@ mail which had been <unk> to them from flight controllers . Their work day included a lunch break at midday ( UTC ) , and ended with a mid @-@ afternoon planning session with flight controllers , regarding the next day 's activities . Most days ended with some entertainment , with the crew watching all or part of a movie ; this was thought to be good for crew bonding as well as their psychological well @-@ being . After watching 2010 , the sequel to 2001 : A Space Odyssey ( film ) , Shepherd commented , " [ There is ] something strange about watching a movie about a space expedition when you 're actually on a space expedition " . 
 An important part of the crew 's schedule was regular exercise . They had three pieces of equipment for this : a stationary bicycle , a treadmill ( <unk> ) , and a resistance device ( <unk> ) for weight @-@ lifting . The bicycle malfunctioned in mid @-@ December 2000 , and wasn 't fixed until March . The treadmill , which used bungee cords to keep the crew member in place , was designed to reduce the vibrations caused by running . A normal treadmill would have produced enough vibrations to shake the station , and potentially affect the sensitive science experiments on board . The treadmill malfunctioned near the end of February , but some in @-@ flight maintenance fixed the problem within a week . 
 = = = Ground communications = = = 
 Until the Unity module was available for use a month into the mission , the astronauts used the Russian VHF communications gear ( also called the " <unk> radio link " ) in Zvezda and the Zarya module to communicate with the Russian Mission Control Center ( known as " TsUP " ) in Korolev , outside Moscow . The Russian technology didn 't have the use of satellites , so they were restricted to ground passes ( called a " comm pass " ) which lasted for only 10 – 20 minutes . With the arrival of the solar arrays on STS @-@ 97 , they activated the S @-@ band Early Communication gear in the Unity Module , allowing for more continuous communication with Mission Control in Houston via NASA 's network of Tracking and Data Relay Satellites . 
 During STS @-@ 106 in September 2000 , the equipment for a ham radio was delivered to the station . The first ' ham ' contact with the ground by the Expedition 1 crew was on 13 November 2000 on a pass over Moscow , shortly followed by contact with Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Maryland . The crew reported that " Voice quality of ham radio continues to be well above any of our other links . " 
 The Amateur Radio on the International Space Station project had the crew of the station to make brief windows to radio contact with schools and clubs on the ground . The first school to be contacted by the ISS was Luther Burbank School in southwest Chicago . The contact had been planned for 19 December 2000 , but due to technical problems , it was delayed to 21 December 2000 . Due to the speed of the space station , the window of radio contact only lasted for 5 – 10 minutes , which was usually enough for 10 to 20 questions . 
 = = = Science activities = = = 
 Unlike subsequent expeditions , the crew of Expedition 1 had a somewhat modest amount of science experiments to conduct , due to the priority placed on station construction . The plasma crystal experiment , known as <unk> @-@ <unk> , was one of the first natural science experiments conducted on the space station . It was a collaboration between the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Germany , and the Institute for High Energy Densities ( part of the Russian Academy of Sciences ) . 
 Like previous missions , the astronauts took many photos of Earth from the station , over 700 in total , which have been made freely available . These Crew Earth Observations , are intended to record dynamic events on the Earth 's surface such as storms , fires , or volcanoes . For example , a photo from 1 January 2001 shows Mount Cleveland , Alaska , with a plume of smoke , prior to its eruption the following month . On 23 January 2001 , the crew observed a unique perspective of a plume of volcanic ash coming from Popocatépetl , an active volcano 70 kilometres southeast of Mexico City . 
 An example of a low @-@ maintenance experiment was the protein crystal growth experiment , which had also been flown on previous shuttle missions . The goal was to produce better protein <unk> than those produced on the Earth , and hence allowing for a more accurate model of protein structures . Of the 23 proteins and viruses attempted during Expedition 1 , only four resulted in successful <unk> , which was a lower success rate than predicted . Of those successful was the low @-@ calorie sweetener <unk> , whose crystals diffracted at a higher resolution than Earth @-@ grown crystal , which resulted in a more accurate protein structure model . 
 Another research activity was measuring the crew 's heart rates and the station 's carbon dioxide levels to determine the effect of exercise on the station .

 Yi Jianlian ( simplified Chinese : <unk> ; traditional Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : Yì <unk> , pronounced [ <unk> <unk> ̯ ɛ ̂ <unk> ̯ ɛ ̌ n ] , EE <unk> @-@ len ; born October 27 , 1987 ) is a Chinese basketball player who currently plays for Guangdong Southern Tigers in the Chinese Basketball Association ( CBA ) . He has also played in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) for the Milwaukee Bucks , New Jersey Nets , Washington Wizards , and Dallas Mavericks . 
 Yi joined the Guangdong Southern Tigers beginning with the 2002 @-@ 03 season , and subsequently won the CBA Rookie of the Year award . In his first five years with Guangdong , the team won three CBA titles . Yi also played with the Chinese national basketball team at the 2004 , 2008 , and 2012 Summer Olympics as well as the 2006 and 2010 FIBA Basketball World Cup . 
 In the 2007 NBA draft , he was selected by the Milwaukee Bucks as the sixth overall pick . Initially , Yi declined to sign with Milwaukee for several months before agreeing to a contract with them on 29 August 2007 . He later played for three other NBA teams until returning to the Guangdong Southern Tigers in 2012 . 
 = = CBA career = = 
 As a child , Yi was not allowed by his parents to join a sports school , which is designed for children predicted to be future sports stars . However , a sports school 's basketball coach who noticed Yi 's potential in playing street basketball persuaded Yi 's family to allow him to train professionally . Hoping to sign Yi to an endorsement deal , Adidas invited him to attend the company 's ABCD camp in New Jersey in 2002 , where he competed against all @-@ American high school players . 
 After returning to China later that year , he signed his Professional contract with Chinese Basketball Association side Guangdong Southern Tigers and averaged 3 @.@ 5 points per game and 1 @.@ 9 rebounds per game in his first season . He also averaged 7 @.@ 3 points per game and 7 @.@ 3 rebounds per game in four games during the playoffs and won the Rookie of the Year award . Yi was featured in TIME 's August 2003 article titled " The Next Yao Ming " . In each of his next three seasons , Yi led Guangdong to the championships and he was awarded the finals ' most valuable player honor in each of those three years . In Yi 's last season in the Chinese Basketball Association before he entered the 2007 NBA Draft , he averaged a career @-@ high 24 @.@ 9 points per game and 11 @.@ 5 rebounds per game , but his team lost to the Bayi Rockets in the playoff finals . 
 During the 2011 NBA lockout , Yi signed a one @-@ year contract to return to the Guangdong Southern Tigers . Unlike most NBA players who went to the Chinese Basketball Association during that time , he received an option to return to the National Basketball Association once the lockout had been resolved . After the lockout ended , he signed with the Dallas Mavericks for the remainder of the 2011 @-@ 12 season . Yi rejoined the Guangdong Southern Tigers after he was released by the Dallas Mavericks in 2012 .

 Yi was not expected to enter the NBA draft until 2009 because the Chinese Basketball Association ruled that players would not be allowed to leave for foreign leagues until they turned 22 . In early 2006 , however , Yi announced that he would enter the 2006 NBA draft although he eventually decided to withdraw , saying he was " not good enough to compete in the NBA and needed more experience . " A year later on 1 November 2006 , the Guangdong Southern Tigers announced that Yi would enter the 2007 NBA draft . 
 Yi chose Dan Fegan as his agent to represent him in the NBA draft and flew to Los Angeles to participate in pre @-@ NBA draft camps . Before the draft , Yi was predicted by many to be picked anywhere from third to twelfth . On 28 June 2007 , Yi was selected by the Milwaukee Bucks with the sixth overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft , despite Fegan warning the Milwaukee Bucks not to pick Yi and not allowing them to be one of the teams invited to Yi 's pre @-@ draft private workouts in Los Angeles . Fegan did not want Milwaukee to select Yi because the city of Milwaukee did not have a large Asian @-@ American community . However , Milwaukee 's general manager Larry Harris said they had only drafted the best player available to them . Yi and Sun Yue together would also mark the first time in NBA draft history where two Chinese born players would be selected in the same draft , which was a feat that would not be repeated again until 2016 . 
 After the draft , Milwaukee attempted to convince Yi to sign with the team and on 2 July 2007 , the owner of the Bucks franchise , Herb Kohl , wrote a letter to Yi and his representatives , hoping to persuade Yi to sign with the team . Three days later , head coach Larry Krystkowiak and Harris met with Yi , attempting to influence him to play for Milwaukee , however , Yi 's representatives requested that the team trade Yi to another team with a city that had a large Chinese presence . Chinese officials also required that any team Yi played for would have to give him sufficient playing time for him to improve for the 2008 Summer Olympics . Kohl made a special trip to Hong Kong to appeal to Yi personally and he assured Chinese officials that Yi would have sufficient playing time . On 29 August 2007 , the Milwaukee Bucks and Yi agreed to a standard , multi @-@ year rookie contract .

 After being named to Milwaukee 's starting lineup by head coach Larry Krystkowiak in place of Charlie Villanueva to begin the 2007 @-@ 08 season , Yi scored 9 points and three rebounds in a loss to the Orlando Magic for his debut . He played his first home game in Milwaukee three days later and scored 16 points while grabbing eight boards in a 78 @-@ 72 win against the Chicago Bulls . The game was also Yi 's first game to be televised nationally in China , where it was watched by an estimated 100 million viewers . Yao Ming praised Yi 's play in his first few games , saying , " If you compare us in our third NBA games , you will see that Yi 's statistics are far better than mine . " 
 On 9 November 2007 , Yi played against Yao for the first time when the Houston Rockets hosted Milwaukee in a 104 @-@ 88 loss . Yi scored 19 points and nine rebounds , including two three @-@ pointers while Yao scoring 28 points and nine rebounds . The game between the two was watched by over 200 million people in China , making it one of the most @-@ watched games in NBA history . After the game , Yao called Yi 's talent " unbelievable " and Tracy McGrady said that Yi had a " tremendous upside in this league " . Del Harris , the former head coach of the Chinese national basketball team , also described Yi as the " most athletic 7 @-@ footer in the NBA . " 
 Yi was named the Rookie of the Month in December 2007 after averaging 12 @.@ 1 points per game and 6 @.@ 6 rebounds per game that month while scoring a career @-@ high 29 points on 14 @-@ 17 shooting in a win against the Charlotte Bobcats on 22 December 2007 .

On 2 February 2008 , Yi faced Yao for the second time when Milwaukee played at home against Houston , which Krystkowiak dubbed the " Chinese Super Bowl . " However , both players struggled during Houston 's 91 @-@ 83 victory over Milwaukee . Yao scored 12 points while Yi injured his shoulder during the game , finishing 6 points and scoring on one of his ten field goal attempts . 
 On 2 April 2008 , it was announced that Yi would miss the rest of the season with a knee injury . Having already missed eight games with other injuries , Yi played in only 66 out of a possible 82 games in his rookie season , averaging 8 @.@ 6 points per game and 5 @.@ 2 rebounds per game . One of Milwaukee 's assistant coaches , Brian James , later said that " the injuries he had bothered him more than people realized , and he couldn 't play through them . "

 On 26 June 2008 , Yi was traded by the Milwaukee Bucks along with Bobby Simmons to the New Jersey Nets in exchange for Richard Jefferson . New Jersey 's team president Rod Thorn said that " we feel strongly he 's going to be a real good player , " and the team 's chief executive Brett <unk> said " it opens up a truly new fan base for us . " Yi stated that he didn 't expect to be traded , but that it was " an honor to join the Nets . " 
 Through his first 37 games with New Jersey , Yi averaged 10 @.@ 5 points per game and 6 @.@ 2 rebounds per game while shooting 39 % from behind the three @-@ point line , which was well above his average from the previous season . But on 9 January 2009 , Yi broke the little finger on his right hand and was expected to miss four to six weeks . Thorn called it " lousy timing " because " he 'd been playing well , " but Yi said " ( I 'll ) just take my time . I 'll come back . " In voting for the 2009 NBA All @-@ Star Game , Yi finished third in total votes for forwards in the Eastern Conference , ahead of players such as Paul Pierce and Chris Bosh . 
 Yi made his return from injury after the 2009 NBA All @-@ Star Game in a loss to the Houston Rockets on 17 February 2009 . However , after averaging only 6 points on 36 % shooting after his return , Yi was removed from the team 's starting lineup . His final averages for the season were 8 @.@ 6 points per game and 5 @.@ 3 rebounds per game , as well as a 38 % shooting percentage from the field and 34 % on three @-@ point field goals . After New Jersey finished the season outside of the playoffs , Yi 's agent Dan Fegan suggested New Jersey played better when Yi played more minutes and took more shots , and said it " begs the question [ sic ] ... who 's accountable ? " New Jersey 's head coach Lawrence Frank said that " you have to be patient . He 's only 21 , " and Yi assessed his season by saying he was " still too much up and down . " 
 In the 2009 @-@ 10 season , Yi returned to the starting lineup for New Jersey . Starting in every game he played but one , Yi suffered several injuries during the season which made him miss 30 games . He sprained his medial collateral ligament on 4 November 2009 , had a laceration on his upper lip on 8 December 2009 , and sprained his left ankle on 8 March 2009 .

Yi is not the first Chinese basketball player to come under scrutiny for age discrepancy , as former NBA player Wang Zhizhi had been listed as being born in both 1977 and 1979 . 
 In 2006 , a senior Chinese official admitted that past youth squads had included players above the permitted age and Yi 's longtime American teammate in the Guangdong Southern Tigers , Jason Dixon , said to Chad Ford that Yi was " 21 or 22 .... It 's pretty common over to change ages " . In 2007 , a Chinese government registration website made public by hackers showed Yi 's date of birth as 27 October 1984 , and in December 2008 , a Chinese reporter discovered a high school enrollment form from 1997 that listed Yi as being born on 27 October 1984 .

 = Ontario Highway 21 = 
 King 's Highway 21 , commonly referred to as Highway 21 , is a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario that begins at Highway 402 midway between Sarnia and London and ends at Highway 6 , Highway 10 and Highway 26 in Owen Sound . The roadway is referred to as the Bluewater Highway because it remains very close to the eastern shoreline of Lake Huron . 
 Highway 21 was first designated by the Department of Highways ( DHO ) between Highway 3 and Highway 7 in mid @-@ 1927 and extended to Goderich in 1934 . A year later , a final extension completed the route to Owen Sound . In 1997 and 1998 , the portion of the route south of Highway 402 was transferred to the counties in which it laid . 
 Highway 21 is often subject to winter closures due to lake effect caused by snowsquall , which can create sudden whiteout conditions along the Lake Huron shoreline . Several Emergency Detour Routes have been established further inland to guide drivers around such closures . Care should be taken during the winter months , as these storms can progress rapidly and unexpectedly . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Highway 21 is a long lakeside route through southwestern Ontario which serves numerous communities along the eastern shoreline of Lake Huron . Once over 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) longer than it is today , the highway now begins at Highway 402 near the community of Warwick , where it progresses north through the towns of Forest , Grand Bend , Goderich , Point Clark , Kincardine , Tiverton , Port Elgin , and Southampton . At Southampton , the highway veers away from the Lake Huron shoreline and travels east to Owen Sound . 
 The route is generally smoothly @-@ flowing , but can be somewhat congested through towns during the summer from tourists and cottagers . Highway 21 is often subject to closures at various points as it lies on the lee shore of Lake Huron . Lake effect snow squalls frequently subject motorists to poor visibility and slippery conditions , leading to whiteout conditions . Because of this , the Ontario Provincial Police claim that the road is the most often closed in the province . Highway 23 provides an alternative inland route . 
 The highway begins at Exit 34 and progresses north towards Lake Huron . This mostly straight section of the route lies within Lambton County and passes through the town of Forest . Near Kettle Point , the route abruptly curves north west and begins to parallel the shore of the lake , providing access to the village of Port Franks and The Pinery Provincial Park prior to entering Grand Bend . North of that village , the highway crosses into Huron County and intersects former Highway 83 . Between this point and Goderich , the west side of the highway is dominated by roads providing access to shoreline cottages . 
 At Goderich , the route encounters Highway 8 , then crosses the Maitland River along a bypass constructed during the early 1960s ; the original routing followed portions of Saltford Street and River Ridge Crescent . The highway proceeds straight north as the baseline at the shore of Lake Huron until it reaches <unk> . There the surveying grid changes orientation , and Highway 21 follows a forced road allowance that meanders approximately 2 km ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) inland from lake north to Amberley , where it encounters former Highway 86 , which travels to Waterloo , and enters . The route curves northeast as it enters Bruce County to align with the surveying grid and proceeds out of Amberley towards Kincardine . 
 Between <unk> and Tiverton , Highway 21 travels straight @-@ as @-@ an @-@ arrow along what was originally a rural concession road through the hamlets of Reid 's Corners , Pine River , Huron Ridge and Slade . It bypasses inland of Kincardine , intersecting the western terminus of Highway 9 . Within Tiverton , which acts as the primary town serving Bruce Nuclear Generating Station , traffic must turn to remain on Highway 21 . As it exits southeast from the town , the highway makes a broad curve to the northeast and continues through the hamlets of Underwood and North Bruce . 
 As it approaches the southern end of the Bruce Peninsula , the route bisects Port Elgin , then curves abruptly towards Lake Huron and passes through Southampton before curving to the east towards Owen Sound . Between those two places , the highway is generally straight , except at the boundary between Bruce and Grey Counties as well as the descent of the Niagara Escarpment at Springmount . Several communities line this inland stretch of highway , including Chippewa Hill , Kelly 's Corners , Elsinore , <unk> , <unk> and Jackson . At Springmount , the route encounters Highway 6 , which joins Highway 21 to form Ontario 's only wrong @-@ way concurrency east to Owen Sound . 
 = = History = = 
 Highway 21 was the first King 's Highway in Lambton County when it was assumed in 1927 between Highway 3 at Morpeth and Highway 7 at Reece 's Corners . This original section of highway changed from a <unk> to a plank road circa 1860 . When James Miller Williams , a Hamilton businessman , set out one day from during a drought to dig a well , he chose a spot downhill from an existing oil seep in the village of Black Creek . Instead of encountering water , Williams hit a shallow oil deposit . As a result of the ensuing oil @-@ boom , which would begin the petroleum industry in North America , Williams laid out the village and changed its name to Oil Springs . Two competing plank road companies were formed , the Black Creek Plank Road Company ( of which Williams was a principal investor ) and the Sarnia to Florence Plank Road Company , both of which aimed their roads through Oil Springs . Although both roads were constructed , the former company was more prosperous in its endeavours ; in 1886 , a significant portion of the Sarnia to Florence Plank Road was closed up and turned over to local property owners . The Black Creek Plank Road Company meanwhile had transformed the muddy quagmire of a path into a well @-@ maintained road . By 1863 , three miles of road south of Wyoming had been paved , and the remainder south to Oil Springs planked ( the Sarnia Road followed two years later ) . However , as the oil boom faded , so too did improvement to the road . 
 On May 23 , 1927 , the Department of Highways assumed the unpaved road between Highway 7 at Reece 's Corner and Highway 3 at Morpeth , via Dresden , Thamesville and <unk> as Provincial Highway 21 ; this was changed to the current King 's Highway 21 in 1930 . That year , the department set out to improve the new highway . Concrete slabs were laid between Petrolia and Highway 7 , as well as along a 7 @.@ 25 @-@ kilometre ( 4 @.@ 50 mi ) section between Thamesville and Dresden . The following year , the route was paved between Dresden and <unk> Mills before the effects of the Great Depression forced the department to concentrate on paving Highway 22 . The election of a new government in mid @-@ 1934 led to the resumption of work in June as a depression relief project . New equipment ( namely a Caterpillar <unk> ) , as well as the expertise of Andy Newman , an engineer who was hired when he demonstrated his abilities with the machinery upon passing a construction site on his drive home . Newman , who helped design the machine that nobody else could operate , allowed work to proceed at a much faster rate than before . The machinery could dig quicker than 50 men , and this effort showed when the gap between Petrolia and <unk> Mills and the remaining gaps between Dresden and Thamesville were graded and paved by the end of the summer . On October 19 , 1934 , Highway 21 was officially opened by Robert <unk> Smith , deputy minister of the Department of Highways . 
 On April 4 , 1934 , Highway 21 was assumed through Huron County as far north as Goderich . This was followed by the assumption of a section through Bosanquet Township on April 18 , creating a 40 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 25 @.@ 2 mi ) concurrency with Highway 7 from Reece 's Corners to Thedford . From there , the route travelled through Thedford to Port Franks , where it merged into the present highway . A final 137 @.@ 4 @-@ kilometre ( 85 @.@ 4 mi ) extension to Owen Sound was assumed on May 15 , 1935 , bringing the highway to its greatest length of 333 @.@ 1 kilometres ( 207 @.@ 0 mi ) . 
 Meanwhile , on April 11 , 1934 , the department assumed control of a road connecting Highway 7 with Forest as Highway 21A . It was later extended to connect with Highway 21 at Port Franks on August 19 , 1936 . By 1938 , Highway 21A had been renumbered as Highway 21 , and Highway 21 through Thedford renumbered as Highway 82 . 
 Beginning in 1960 , a small bypass of Highway 21 was constructed on the north side of Goderich , avoiding a nearby hairpin turn . The 160 m ( 520 ft ) curving structure over the Maitland River was completed in mid @-@ 1961 at a cost of C $ 1 @.@ 39 million and opened ceremoniously on July 17 , 1962 . 
 During the early 1980s , the construction of Highway 402 east from Sarnia resulted in a shift in the route of the highway . The route was extended north from Reece 's Corners to Exit 25 , while the section from Highway 7 north to Exit 34 was " downloaded " , or transferred to the local municipality in which it resided . Further transfers were performed in 1997 and 1998 . On April 1 , 1997 , the section of Highway 21 from Highway 401 south to Morpeth was transferred to Kent County . On January 1 , 1998 , the section between Highway 401 and Highway 402 was transferred to Kent and Lambton counties .

 = Cushing House = 
 Cushing House ( formerly called Cushing Hall ) is a four @-@ story co @-@ ed dormitory on Vassar College 's campus in the town of Poughkeepsie , New York . A response to freshmen overcrowding , the college 's Board of Trustees hurried the Allen & <unk> @-@ designed building , named for college librarian and alumna trustee Florence M. Cushing , to construction and completion in 1927 . Cushing was originally designed as eight smaller houses with <unk> principles in mind , but ended up as a single U @-@ shaped dormitory in the Old English manor house style with Jacobean interior furnishings . Students of all grades may live in the house which houses up to 202 in single , double , and triple rooms and are referred to as " <unk> " . Throughout Cushing 's history , various proposals and plans have incited controversy among the building 's residents , including designating one of its wings as all @-@ black housing and converting one of its common areas into eight single rooms . Contemporary reviewers have looked favorably upon Cushing 's aesthetic qualities , declaring it to be one of Vassar 's most beautiful buildings . 
 = = History = = 
 Before Cushing House 's construction , Vassar College in the town of Poughkeepsie , New York , faced a surplus of students and too few available rooms , a situation deemed an " emergency " by the Board of Trustees . For the first quarter of the twentieth century , one third of the college 's freshmen were housed off campus due to rising enrollment over that period . The Board voted in 1925 to move all students to on @-@ campus housing , acknowledging the lack of adequate space for the move but pledging that they would swiftly build more . The following year , the Board voted to begin construction on the new hall without first securing funding for the building , trusting that the " friends of the College " would meet the financial demands of the project . In the meantime , the house was built using loaned funds , with the total project cost coming to $ 400 @,@ 000 . 
 Original plans for Cushing House , then called Cushing Hall , saw the building as a model of Vassar 's euthenics program . The term euthenics was first defined by Ellen Swallow Richards of Vassar 's class of 1870 as " [ t ] he betterment of living conditions , though conspicuous endeavor for the purpose of securing more efficient human beings " . In accordance with these principles , initial schematics saw the dormitory divided into eight separate houses all surrounded by a brick wall . Cushing was ultimately designed by architectural firm Allen & <unk> which was also responsible for several other buildings on Vassar 's campus including the Thompson Memorial Library and its wings before Cushing 's completion , <unk> Nursery School concurrently , and Skinner Hall of Music afterwards in 1932 . The Cushing project was completed in 1927 and the dormitory was named for the college 's first alumnae trustee , Florence M. Cushing , who was a member of the Vassar class of 1874 and the college 's librarian from the year of her graduation until 1876 . On account of her death in September 1927 , Cushing Hall was not dedicated in time for the incoming class of freshman for the 1927 – 28 school year ; instead , the dedication which was marked by an informal reception was put off until October 29 of the same year . 
 In 1954 , Cushing residents were " perturbed " by the possibility of a new language hall being built within the dormitory 's sightlines , citing the concern that any artificial construction would ruin their views . Another controversy arose in April 1970 after students from Cushing objected to a plan put forth by a contingent of black students and approved by the Board of Trustees that would designate one wing of Cushing as a co @-@ ed housing space for black students of all grades . Prior to the plan 's formulation , upperclassmen black students could opt to live in a student community in Kendrick House while underclassmen could live in an analogous community in Main Building . Cushing residents were not notified of the plan until after its approval and a public meeting was held at which objections were raised by both Cushing residents and black students that one wing of the dorm might not be enough space to foster a black community and that Kendrick House should instead be repurposed as elective all @-@ black housing . After the college 's administration expressed the possibility that this plan might be in violation of U.S. Department of Health , Education , and Welfare standards on segregation , all but four black students walked out of the meeting and the assembly decided that the Board of Trustees needed to be better informed of the racial climate on campus . In 1974 , Vassar 's Master Planning Committee voted to convert one of Cushing 's common areas , then a dining room , to eight single dorms . An emergency meeting was held and students organized a Save Cushing Dining Room movement which collected 800 signatures against the plan in 24 hours . Other instances have seen one of Cushing 's parlors converted to a quad dorm used to house students temporarily when no other housing could be found for them , first in 1989 then again during the first semester of the 1998 – 99 school year . 
 = = Architecture and features = = 
 Cushing House was built on the north side of campus and sits apart from most of the school 's other dorms , with the exception of Noyes House to its west . Cushing stands four stories tall and is configured in a U shape with two wings of student rooms connected by center common areas on the ground floor and more halls of student housing on the upper " trans " ( inter @-@ wing ) levels . Between the wings is a courtyard covered by a lawn and trees . Two articles published in Vassar 's weekly Miscellany News in 1975 identified some of the species present at the time : Cryptomeria japonica , Ilex opaca ( American holly ) , several crab apple trees , and a Fagus sylvatica ( European beech ) . The exterior of the house is built in an Old English manor house style designed to mimic the nearby Pratt House which was designed by architects York and Sawyer and completed in 1916 . The roof of the hall is made of slate , with walls of patterned brickwork covered with half @-@ timbered decorations as well as leaded windows and towers . A smaller wing , sometimes referred to as the " maid 's wing " , abuts the center common area and includes a pantry and kitchen on its ground floor and smaller dorm rooms that originally housed servants on the floors above . 
 Inside the dorm , common area furnishings are Jacobean in style and architectural features include plaster ceilings , windows with tracery , and wood paneling . Within rooms , closets and windows are also notably large and soft light is present throughout the hall . The building was designed to house 130 students split between two double rooms and 126 singles , but now fits up to 202 students , <unk> referred to as " <unk> " . The house presently includes single dorms , one @-@ room doubles , and two @-@ room doubles and triples . Upon opening in 1927 ( prior to Vassar 's 1969 transition from being an all @-@ female to co @-@ ed college ) , the dormitory was limited to housing freshmen . It is now co @-@ ed and acts as home to students from all grades including , as of 1999 , the highest proportion of upperclassmen of any dorm at the school . Bathrooms are shared by all members of a hall . A minor renovation in summer 1995 and funded by the Estée Lauder Companies included more efficient lighting , rewiring , and new furniture for the house . Like all other Vassar dorms , Cushing houses a game room , a laundry room , and a Steinway grand piano . 
 In 1928 , a year after Cushing opened , Keene Richards , Vassar College 's general manager , wrote to college president Henry Noble MacCracken that Cushing was " neither luxurious nor extravagant . " Authors Karen Van Lengen and Lisa Reilly countered this sentiment in their 2004 architectural guide to the campus , noting that " Cushing 's cozy domesticity is a far cry from the institutional nature of collegiate residential architecture found on other college campuses " and concluding that the dorm was one of the most beautiful buildings on campus . Another guide , compiled in 2003 by the staff of the Yale Daily News , identified the dorm as one of the two most popular at the college , along with Jewett House . Cushing has drawn comparisons to the fictitious Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry according to The Miscellany News . The building 's parlor was singled out in College Prowler 's 2012 guide to the college as the most beautiful at Vassar .

 " The Coon " is the second episode of the thirteenth season of the American animated television series South Park . The 183rd episode of the series , it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on March 18 , 2009 . In the episode , Cartman poses as a superhero vigilante named " The Coon " , who grows increasingly jealous of the popularity and success of a rival superhero named " Mysterion " . 
 The episode was written and directed by series co @-@ founder Trey Parker , and was rated TV @-@ MA L in the United States . It was originally conceived as an episode about the economic recession , but those elements were later adapted into the future episode , " Margaritaville " . " The Coon " generated a great deal of speculation about the true identity of Mysterion . Parker and Stone originally said there was no specific answer to the question . However , his identity is finally revealed in the fourteenth season episode " Mysterion Rises " . 
 The episode parodied several dark @-@ toned comic book films that had been recently released at the time , including The Spirit , Watchmen and The Dark Knight . It received generally positive reviews and , according to Nielsen Media Research , was seen by 3 @.@ 27 million households the week it aired . Comedian Bruce Vilanch , who is mocked in the episode , sent a thank you card to Parker and Stone after the episode aired . " The Coon " was released on DVD and Blu @-@ ray along with the rest of the thirteenth season on March 16 , 2010 . " The Coon " was also released on DVD in The Little Box of Butters on September 28 , 2010 . " The Coon " was re @-@ released once more on DVD and Blu @-@ ray as a " bonus episode " with the complete fourteenth season . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Donning a disguise modeled after a raccoon , Cartman becomes a vigilante dubbed " The Coon " , who attempts to wipe out crime in South Park . Though Cartman tries to raise awareness about The Coon through word of mouth , nobody pays much attention to the Coon 's efforts . When he reports " crimes " ( such as mistaking a man innocently trying to kiss his date for a rapist ) to the police department , he is threatened with jail time and snubbed off . During class , Cartman tries to hype up an appearance from the Coon , saying he will be on roof of a Walgreens later that evening . Cartman ( as the Coon ) shows up to the spot to find another child superhero named " Mysterion " , who is far more successful in garnering appreciation as a crime stopping icon from the police and South Park citizens who want to know just " Who is Mysterion ? " Cartman is angered by his lack of popularity and the attention Mysterion is receiving . 
 Coon decides to rid the town of Mysterion , enlisting the help of Professor Chaos ( Butters ) and his sidekick General Disarray ( Dougie ) . Unlike the Coon , Professor Chaos and General Disarray have become as familiar to the residents of South Park as Mysterion . Butters also wants to know the identity of Mysterion but can only narrow the list of suspects to the boys from Mr. Garrison 's 4th grade class whose shapes do not differ greatly from that of others . In contrast , he has nearly pinned down Coon 's identity to a few fat celebrities , and Cartman . In a scheme to uncover Mysterion 's identity , the Coon convinces Professor Chaos to threaten the destruction of a hospital unless Mysterion reveals his identity . After the Coon plants the TNT and leaves to buy detonators , Mysterion unexpectedly arrives . He points out that this is not Professor Chaos ' usual style , and fights Professor Chaos and General Disarray on top of the building . A crowd forms below and cheers on Mysterion as the police take no actions , believing that their bullets are no match for Professor Chaos ' aluminum foil armor . Dramatically , the Coon appears to fight on the side of Mysterion , with the hopes that he too will be hailed as a hero . At that point , Professor Chaos and General Disarray run off in defeat . After their victory , the Coon convinces Mysterion to unmask himself by claiming such threats to public safety will continue until Mysterion 's secret is revealed . 
 Despite the threat of imprisonment , Mysterion unmasks himself , showing the television viewers only the portion of his face that looks similar to almost all of Mr. Garrison 's 4th grade class . The crowd , however , is shocked to learn Mysterion 's identity and , much to the regret of all except Coon , who says that he knew who Mysterion was , even calling him out on it at one point ( though this helps the audience little as Cartman claimed that practically everyone in his class was Mysterion at times ) , Mysterion is hauled to prison . With Professor Chaos , General Disarray and Mysterion defeated , Cartman now perceives that he is the superhero in South Park and that every town should have a Coon like him .

 " The Coon " was written and directed by series co @-@ founder Trey Parker . It first aired on March 18 , 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central . Like most South Park episodes , " The Coon " was first conceived by Parker and fellow co @-@ founder Matt Stone within a week of the episode 's broadcast date . Kenny , Kyle and Stan were originally planned to be made superheroes as well as Cartman , and for the episode to revolve around a group of superheroes in the style of Watchmen , a graphic @-@ novel @-@ based film that had been released earlier that month . They started working on sketches of the other superhero costumes , but Cartman and his alter @-@ ego , the Coon , were finished first . From the start , Parker and Stone wrote Cartman as caring more about his superhero image than fighting crime , but as they worked further on the episode , it began to take up more and more of the story until they decided to make Cartman the only superhero of the four boys . 
 Parker and Stone long planned to create an episode about the economic recession , and originally planned for Cartman to dress as a superhero named " The Coon " and fight the economy . This is why the opening scene of " The Coon " involves Cartman discussing the poor economic state of the nation and the election of U.S. President Barack Obama . Eventually , Cartman would discover the recession stemmed from the sale of Jimmy Buffett 's Margaritaville blenders , and he would have to battle singer Jimmy Buffett and investor Warren Buffett , who would be portrayed as Jimmy 's brother . Eventually , the idea was scrapped , and " The Coon " turned into an episode revolving entirely around a comic book film parody . Elements of the economic recession and the Margaritaville blenders were eventually incorporated into future episode " Margaritaville " . 
 The identity of Mysterion is never revealed in " The Coon " . After the episode aired , the question " Who is Mysterion ? " became a frequently asked question at the FAQ for the official South Park website , South Park Studios . The answer posted at that site was that " there is no answer " , and that only Trey Parker and Matt Stone actually know . Parker said it was one of the most common questions he was asked about the show , along with the identity of Cartman 's father , which was resolved in the fourteenth season episode " 201 " . Parker and Stone originally said there was no actual answer to Mysterion 's identity , as they never chose a specific character to be him . In the original ending of the episode , after Mysterion is arrested , Kyle is shown to be in prison and it is believed he is the superhero . However , the real Mysterion visits him , and Kyle explains he pretended to be Mysterion so the real superhero could remain free and continue fighting crime . As a thank you , Mysterion revealed his identity by showing his face , but like in the actual episode , the viewer cannot determine who he is because all the children look alike without hats . The ending was ultimately cut because Parker and Stone decided it took too much time for a simple throwaway gag and to show that Kyle was not Mysterion . The clip is available as a deleted scene in the thirteenth season DVD and Blu @-@ ray sets . The superhero characters from " The Coon " returned in the fourteenth season episodes " Coon 2 : Hindsight " , " Mysterion Rises " and " Coon vs. Coon and Friends " , in which Mysterion is revealed . 
 Keo <unk> and Kevin Dalton , who serve as South Park storyboard artists , drew the detailed image of Mysterion that appeared in a news broadcast within the episode . Within a week of the episode 's original broadcast , the online retailer Zazzle and South Park Studios , the official South Park website , released T @-@ shirts and hooded sweatshirts based on the episode , including one with an image of Cartman as the Coon , and one of Mysterion with the words , " Who is Mysterion ? "

 " The Coon " is primarily a parody of dark @-@ toned comic book movies . The Dark Knight ( 2008 ) , The Spirit ( 2008 ) and Watchmen ( 2009 ) are the most commonly referred to films , but others such as Spider @-@ Man 3 ( 2007 ) are also frequently referenced . Matt Stone said the episode started as a parody specifically of Watchmen , but then elements of other comic book films were added as the writing progressed . The music used in " The Coon " is inspired by the style of film scores by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer , both of whom collaborated on the scores for Batman Begins ( 2005 ) and The Dark Knight . To promote the Coon , Cartman uses a similar tagline as was used to promote Darkman , printing shirts asking " Who is The Coon ? " The Coon and Mysterion use deep and ominous voices similar to that used by Christian Bale in the Batman films and Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach in Watchmen . Stone said he found Bale 's voice particularly annoying in The Dark Knight , and found it amusing that so many comic book movies had heroes whose voices were so low , it sounded like they were " whispering , like you 've been up all night smoking " . 
 Cartman and Mysterion both refer to themselves as " the symbol this town needs " , a line from The Dark Knight , and Cartman encourages Butters to film a video threatening to blow up a hospital , the same as the Joker from a scene in that film . The opening shot of " The Coon " is also inspired by a sequence from Watchmen : both feature a close @-@ up of a city sidewalk and zoom out to someone looking down from the top of a tall skyscraper . A poster of the Coon shown at Cartman 's <unk> 2009 is inspired by the front cover of The Dark Knight Returns , the Batman graphic novel by Frank Miller . Other common comic book film traits parodied in " The Coon " include costumes that do little to actually conceal secret identities , trophies adorning superhero secret lairs , and sudden disappearing exits and entrances . 
 Cartman 's <unk> 2009 convention is held at the Airport Hilton , the same place where he holds his " ginger pride " event in the episode " Ginger Kids " and the AIDS benefit in the episode " <unk> Trouble " . Butters dresses up as Professor Chaos , and Dougie dresses as General Disarray , both of which are the supervillain alter egos they first take on in the sixth season episode " Professor Chaos " . Based on the physique of the Coon , Butters considers heavyset gay entertainers Bruce Vilanch and Harvey Fierstein as suspects for his secret identity . Vilanch sent a card to Parker and Stone after " The Coon " aired , thanking them for referring to him in the episode . Cartman plans to purchase detonators for his TNT from Ace Hardware , a real @-@ life Illinois @-@ based hardware company chain . Cartman refers to the economic recession as one of the primary factors that has led to an increase in crime . News footage of a group of South Park residents talking about Mysterion which focuses on a man with gold teeth and a blue baseball cap was inspired by the Crichton Leprechaun sighting YouTube video .

 Percy Olsen , television editor for Student Life , said " The Coon " was an improvement over " The Ring " because it was less heavy @-@ handed in its morals . Olsen also said it raised the question , " What ever happened to the goofy superhero movies ?

Club gave the episode a B + grade , although she did not like the " non @-@ reveal " ending .
