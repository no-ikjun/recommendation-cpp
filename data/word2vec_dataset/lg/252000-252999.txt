 17 March 2015 – San Benedetto del Tronto to San Benedetto del Tronto , 10 @.@ 05 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) ( ITT ) 
 The seventh and final stage of the 2015 Tirreno – Adriatico was another individual time trial . This stage was 10 @.@ 05 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) in length and took place entirely in the resort of San Benedetto del Tronto on the Adriatic seafront . The course was an out @-@ and @-@ back route . It first headed south , through an intermediate time check after 4 @.@ 7 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 9 mi ) , to a pair of 90 @-@ degree right hand turns halfway through the course . The course then headed north on almost entirely straight roads . The stage was flat throughout with no significant climbs . 
 The early lead was taken by Maciej Bodnar ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) , who set a time of 11 ' 39 " . His time was soon beaten , however , by Adriano Malori ( Movistar Team ) , the winner of stage 1 and the Italian national time trial champion . Malori 's time was 11 ' 27 " . Although Vasil Kiryienka ( Team Sky ) came close , he was five seconds behind at the finish . Fabian Cancellara ( Trek Factory Racing ) , who had come second to Malori on stage 1 , set off as Malori was finishing . Cancellara was a second off Malori 's time at the intermediate checkpoint , but he was five seconds quicker over the second part of the course and took the stage lead by four seconds . Cancellara 's time would not be beaten by any of the remaining riders and he won the stage , with Malori in second and Kiryienka in third . 
 Though the general classification riders did not have a chance of victory on the stage , there were still positions to be won and lost . The best time from the general classification riders was that of Alberto Contador ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) , 31 seconds behind Cancellara , and he stayed in fifth place overall . Wout Poels ( Team Sky ) , Steve Cummings ( MTN – Qhubeka ) and Thibaut Pinot ( FDJ ) all put in good times , with Poels and Cummings moving up in the top ten and Pinot defending his fourth place ahead of Contador . Bauke Mollema ( Trek Factory Racing ) also put in a strong ride , finishing ahead of Rigoberto Urán ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) , who was seen as the better time triallist of the two . Mollema therefore defended his second place overall . He was not , however , able to catch the race leader . Quintana finished 55 " behind Cancellara in 55th place ; he took the overall race victory ahead of Mollema by 18 " . 
 Peter Sagan ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) , the leader of the points competition , only had to finish the stage within the time limit to win the classification . He came very close to failing : he was the slowest rider in the stage , finishing 2 ' 59 " behind Cancellara . It was , however , just enough to prevent his exclusion and to allow him the classification victory . 
 = = Classifications = = 
 There were four main classifications in the 2015 Tirreno – Adriatico . The first and most important of these was the general classification . This was calculated by adding each cyclist 's finishing times on each stage . Time bonuses were awarded to the first three finishers on road stages ( stages 2 – 6 ) : the stage winner won a ten @-@ second bonus , with six and four seconds for the second and third riders respectively . Bonus seconds were also awarded to the first three riders at intermediate sprints ( three seconds for the winner of the sprint , two seconds for the rider in second and one second for the rider in third . The leader of the general classification received a blue jersey and the winner of the classification was considered the overall winner of the race . 
 The second classification was the points classification . On each stage of the race , points were awarded to the top 10 riders . The winner won 12 points , with 10 for the second @-@ placed rider , 8 for the third @-@ placed rider and then one point fewer for each place down to tenth place . Points were also awarded to the top four riders at intermediate sprints , with five points for the winner of the sprint and three , two and one points for the riders in second , third and fourth places respectively . It was originally intended that points would not be awarded on stage 1 as it was a team time trial . After this was changed to an individual time trial , however , points were awarded on the stage , on the same scale as for an intermediate sprint . The winner of the points classification was awarded a red jersey . 
 The third classification was the mountains classification . On each of the road stages there were classified climbs on the route . The first riders to the top of the climb were awarded points in the mountains classification . For most of the climbs , the first four riders won points , with five , three , two and one points respectively . More points were awarded for the two most difficult climbs of the race . These were the summit finish to Monte Terminillo on stage 5 and the Poggio San Romualdo on stage 4 . On these climbs , the winner won 15 points in the classification , with the next six riders also winning points . The rider with the most points was awarded the green jersey . 
 The final classification was the young riders classification . This was based on the general classification : the highest placed rider born after 1 January 1990 was the leader of the classification and was awarded a white jersey .

 = Anky van Grunsven = 
 Theodora Elisabeth <unk> " Anky " van Grunsven ( born 2 January 1968 ) is a Dutch dressage champion who holds the record for the most Olympic medals won by any equestrian athlete and is the only rider to record three successive Olympic wins in the same event . Along with her Olympic successes , she has won numerous medals at the World Equestrian Games ( WEG ) , and is the only rider to have competed at every WEG since they began in 1990 . Between 1990 and 2006 , she competed at the Games in dressage , but in 2010 she was named as part of the Dutch reining team , marking a major change in discipline . 
 In addition to her Olympic and World Equestrian Games successes , van Grunsven holds the record for the most wins at the Dressage World Cup , winning the event nine times between 1995 and 2008 . She has also competed numerous times at the European Dressage Championships , winning seven individual medals and eight team medals between 1991 and 2009 . Although van Grunsven has ridden many horses over her career , she won the majority of her top events on two horses : Bonfire and Salinero . Bonfire , upon whom she had many of her early successes , was retired in 2002 . Salinero quickly took over as van Grunsven 's top horse , and remained in that position until his retirement in 2013 , after making a major comeback to compete in the 2012 Olympic Games . Van Grunsven has been closely linked with the controversial training method rollkur , although she has moved to distance herself from the practice after it was banned from international competition . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Van Grunsven was born in Erp , North Brabant . She began training in dressage at the age of 12 , after her horse Prisco ( who she would later ride at the Olympics and World Equestrian Games ) performed poorly in show jumping . 
 Van Grunsven is married to Dutch national equestrian coach <unk> Janssen , with whom she has two children . She was pregnant with her first child , Yannick , when she competed at the 2004 Olympic Games , and gave birth in November of that year . Van Grunsven and Janssen married in Las Vegas in late 2005 , and in March 2007 had her second child , Ava Eden . 
 In 1999 , van Grunsven , " frustrated by the lack of fashion in the equestrian world " , developed a line of equestrian clothing , now sold internationally .

 = = = Olympics and World Equestrian Games = = = 
 Van Grunsven holds the record for winning the most Olympic medals by an equestrian , with nine medals , and is the only person to have won any equestrian event in three successive Olympics . She is also the only person to compete at seven successive Olympics in dressage . She has competed in every Olympic Games between 1988 and 2012 , winning a total of three gold medals , five silvers and one bronze . At the 1988 Summer Olympics , riding Prisco , she was eliminated in the qualifying rounds of the individual dressage , and was the lowest @-@ scoring member of the fifth @-@ place Dutch team , meaning her score was not used to determine the team 's standing . At the 1992 Summer Olympics , her performance improved , and riding Bonfire she took fourth individually and won her first silver medal in the team competition . At the 1996 Games , again riding Bonfire , she won double silver in the individual and team dressage competitions . 
 With her last Olympic ride on Bonfire , at the 2000 Summer Olympics , she won her first gold in the individual competition , while helping the Dutch team to their third consecutive silver . In 2004 in Athens , on her new mount , Salinero , she won her second gold in individual competition , while the Dutch team came in fourth . The 2008 Olympic Games , again riding Salinero , brought her her third consecutive individual gold , while the Dutch team returned to the medal podium with a silver . Riding Salinero in 2012 in London , van Grunsven slipped to sixth place individually , but helped the Dutch team to her first bronze medal . Van Grunsven was originally not expected to compete in the 2012 Olympics , as the horse she was riding at the beginning of 2012 , IPS <unk> , was injured . However , in April , she announced that she planned to compete for a spot on the Dutch Olympic team with the then @-@ 18 @-@ year @-@ old Salinero , who had staged what the media called a " comeback " after previous injuries . 
 Along with her Olympic successes , van Grunsven has also won numerous medals at the World Equestrian Games . After competing in the 2010 World Equestrian Games , she became the only equestrian to have competed in every World Equestrian Games , which have been held every four years since 1990 , and which include three sections of dressage competition , two individual and one team . At the 1990 World Equestrian Games , riding Prisco , she finished 23rd individually . Van Grunsven rode Bonfire at the 1994 and 1998 World Equestrian Games , winning individual gold and team silver at the first and double silver ( one individual and one team ) at the second . She was unhappy with the judging at the 1998 Games , held in Rome , and said that she " thought [ she ] would quit dressage " , despite her high finish placement . 
 At the 2002 World Equestrian Games , riding <unk> C , she finished 11th individually and rode to 5th place with the Dutch team . Her best finish was at the 2006 Games , riding Salinero , where she won an individual gold and two silvers , one individually and one team . At the 2010 Games , after her top horse Salinero was injured and second @-@ best horse Painted Black was sold , she competed as part of the Dutch reining team , marking a major change in discipline . Riding <unk> BB , she was eliminated in the qualifying rounds . At the Games , she also performed a reining demonstration at the presentation of the team dressage medal and participated in an exhibition of freestyle reining . Van Grunsven began riding reining horses around 2000 , but only became a serious competitor in the sport after the 2008 Olympics . 
 = = = Other competition = = = 
 Van Grunsven has won the Dressage World Cup nine times , in 1995 , 1996 , 1997 , 1999 , 2000 , 2004 , 2005 , 2006 and 2008 . She took second in 1998 and third in 2009 . The World Cup features freestyle dressage ( also called Kur Grand Prix ) , and her record number of wins has won van Grunsven the nickname " Queen of the Kur " . She has also collected five gold medals , eight silver and two bronze at the European Dressage Championships . At the bi @-@ annual European Championships , there is one team competition and three individual events : Individual Dressage , Kur Grand Prix and Special Grand Prix . Van Grunsven took first in the Individual Dressage portion in 1999 and 2005 , and second in 1995 and 1997 . In the Kur competition , she took first in 2007 and third in 2009 . The Special Grand Prix has historically been her weakest event , only taking second in 2007 . She has taken the greatest number of medals in the team competition , with the Dutch team taking first in 2007 and 2009 ; second in 1995 , 1997 , 1999 , 2001 and 2005 ; and third in 1991 . 
 In 2002 , Bonfire was retired , after a nine @-@ year international career . The pair 's gold @-@ medal @-@ winning freestyle dressage performance at the 1994 World Equestrian Games marked the first the time event had been held at the Games , and " changed the world of dressage forever " , according to fellow Olympic gold medalist Carl Hester . A statue was erected in Erp to mark Bonfire 's achievements . In October 2013 , he was euthanized following illness . After Bonfire 's retirement , Van Grunsven stated that she never thought she would find another horse as good as he was ; however , his successor Salinero proved to be even more successful . In March 2013 , Salinero was retired . Van Grunsven and Salinero have been called the " pioneers of the modern freestyle test " , and were the first pair to have music written specifically for their performances . A horse known for his power and ability , he was also sensitive and , early in his career , prone to becoming tense , making him a more difficult horse to ride . Despite this , he was a star of the dressage world , winning numerous international competitions . 
 In January 2003 , van Grunsven sustained a fracture of a bone in her upper leg in a fall from a horse in training , and required surgery . A metal plate was embedded in her leg to immobilize the bone during the healing process , and van Grunsven recovered , winning the 2003 Dutch Dressage Championships in June . In September , she underwent a second surgery to have the plate removed . In 2004 , she became the first Dutch rider to win the CHIO Aachen dressage competition , a top international competition .

 Van Grunsven was closely linked with the controversial training method rollkur , and advocated use of the method as recently as 2007 . She has since moved to distance herself with the method since the International Federation for Equestrian Sports ( FEI ) declared in February 2010 that this method " is seen as an aggressive way of a deep moving horse . This is forbidden as well as any head @-@ neck position which is obtained in an aggressive way . " 
 In a lawsuit announced on 24 August 2010 , van Grunsven claimed to have been defamed by journalist Astrid <unk> on the website <unk> A release posted on that website announcing the lawsuit reported that " according to Anky , images of her horses can not be connected to the controversial rollkur training method . " The lawsuit was scheduled to begin 8 September 2010 in ' s @-@ Hertogenbosch but van Grunsven withdrew the case . 
 = 2016 Paris – Nice = 
 The 2016 Paris – Nice was a road cycling stage race that took place in France between 6 and 13 March 2016 . It was the 74th edition of the Paris – Nice and was the second event of the 2016 UCI World Tour . 
 The race took place over eight stages , travelling south from Conflans @-@ Sainte @-@ Honorine to finish on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice , although one stage was cancelled due to weather conditions . After a prologue individual time trial , the first few stages were suited to sprinters . The decisive stages came on the final two days , with routes taking the riders through the Alps . The favourites for victory were therefore the climbers , including the defending champion Richie Porte ( BMC Racing Team ) , Alberto Contador ( Tinkoff ) and Geraint Thomas ( Team Sky ) . 
 Michael Matthews ( Orica – BikeExchange ) won the prologue and took the leader 's yellow jersey . He kept the jersey through the next five days , winning one more of the stages in a sprint . He lost the jersey on the summit finish on Stage 6 to Thomas , who in turn came close to losing it on the final day . After he was dropped by Contador on the final climb of the race , the Col d 'Èze , he had to chase back on . At the end of the race , Thomas beat Contador by four seconds , with Richie Porte third a further eight seconds back . Matthews won the points classification and Antoine Duchesne ( Direct Énergie ) the mountains classification ; Movistar won the team classification . 
 = = Route = = 
 The route of the 2016 Paris – Nice was announced on 17 December 2015 . The race began with a 6 @.@ 1 @-@ kilometre ( 3 @.@ 8 mi ) prologue individual time trial in Conflans @-@ Sainte @-@ Honorine , near Paris , on Sunday 6 March and continued for the following seven days . The remaining stages were all road stages , with no other time trials . Stage 1 included two dirt tracks in the final part of the stage , with exposed roads made a possibility . Stage 3 was scheduled to finish on Mont Brouilly , a 3 @-@ kilometre ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) climb at a 7 @.@ 7 % gradient . Stage 5 included part of the climb of Mont Ventoux , but this came towards the beginning of the stage and was followed by more than 120 kilometres ( 75 mi ) of roads to the finish . The crucial stages were expected to be the final two : Stage 6 finished on the Madone d 'Utelle , a 15 @.@ 3 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 5 mi ) climb at 5 @.@ 7 % . The final stage included six categorised climbs , with the Col d 'Èze the final climb before the descent into Nice for the finish on the Promenade des Anglais . 
 While Stage 3 was underway , the weather conditions became very poor , with snow on the final climb . After attempting to restart the race , the race organisers cancelled the stage , with Amaury Sport Organisation 's Christian Prudhomme saying " The road was very slippery and safe conditions could not be assured . " 
 = = Participating teams = = 
 The race organisers invited 22 teams to participate . The 18 UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited and obliged to send a squad . The race organisers also invited four UCI Professional Continental teams as wildcards . These were all French teams : Cofidis , Direct Énergie , Delko – Marseille Provence KTM and Fortuneo – Vital Concept . 
 Each team could include up to eight riders . All the teams except Lotto – Soudal filled all eight slots ; Lotto – Soudal 's team of seven meant that the peloton at the start of the race included 167 riders . Lotto – Soudal also chose to compete under a different name from the rest of the season : they became Lotto – Fix ALL , taking the name of one of a product made by Soudal , their normal sponsor . They also wore grey and white jerseys in place of their normal red and white . 
 = = Pre @-@ race favourites = = 
 Stages 1 , 2 and 4 were expected to favour the sprinters , with the other stages likely to be decisive for the general classification . There were a large number of climbers present for Paris – Nice , but the overwhelming favourite was Alberto Contador ( Tinkoff ) , racing in what was possibly his final season in the peloton . Contador had won the race on two previous occasions , but this was his first participation since 2010 . Contador had shown some form with a stage win in the Volta ao Algarve . Contador was the only one of the top four Grand Tour contenders to start Paris – Nice : Vincenzo Nibali ( Astana ) was riding Tirreno – Adriatico , while Chris Froome ( Team Sky ) and Nairo Quintana ( Movistar Team ) opted to wait until the Volta a Catalunya to begin their European seasons . 
 The defending champion was Richie Porte ( BMC Racing Team ) who had won the 2015 Paris – Nice after winning the individual time trial on the final day ; he had also won the 2013 edition . Since his 2015 victory , Porte had moved from Team Sky to BMC . In the absence of the traditional Col d 'Èze time trial , the route was expected to favour him less than previous editions , but his strength in the mountains meant that he was still one of the major favourites . After a strong beginning to the season at the Tour Down Under , Porte had struggled in the Tour of Oman . Porte was replaced as Team Sky 's leader for the race by Geraint Thomas , who had finished fifth the previous year . Thomas had won the Volta ao Algarve and was expected to perform strongly in the prologue time trial . 
 The other major general classification riders included Tom Dumoulin ( Giant – Alpecin ) , Jon Izagirre ( Movistar Team ) , Andrew Talansky and Pierre Rolland ( both Cannondale – Drapac ) and Romain Bardet ( AG2R La Mondiale ) . 
 Among the sprinters , the biggest name was Marcel Kittel ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) , who had won four stages so far in the season as well as the overall title in the Dubai Tour . Other prominent sprinters included André Greipel ( Lotto – Soudal ) , Alexander Kristoff ( Team Katusha ) , Arnaud Démare ( FDJ ) and Nacer Bouhanni ( Cofidis ) .

 The prologue was a 6 @.@ 1 @-@ kilometre ( 3 @.@ 8 mi ) individual time trial in Conflans @-@ Sainte @-@ Honorine . It began on the bank of the Seine with a 2 @-@ kilometre ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) straight road .

 7 March 2016 — Condé @-@ sur @-@ <unk> to Vendôme , 198 km ( 123 @.@ 0 mi ) 
 Stage 1 was a broadly flat stage that covered a 198 @-@ kilometre ( 123 mi ) route from Condé @-@ sur @-@ <unk> to Vendôme . There were no classified climbs in the first 173 kilometres ( 107 mi ) . The final 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) , however , followed a circuit around Vendôme that included both climbs and gravel roads . The riders entered the circuit half @-@ way round . They crossed the first gravel sector , the Chemin de <unk> , then the Chemin du Tertre de la Motte . The second sector included a third @-@ category climb . There were just over 3 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) to the finish line at the end of the second sector . The riders then rode a complete lap of the circuit , crossing both gravel roads and the climb a second time , before reaching the stage finish . The stage took place in difficult conditions , with snow , rain , wind and cold temperatures . 
 The stage began with a four @-@ man breakaway , formed by Thomas De Gendt ( Lotto – Soudal ) , Steven <unk> ( Fortuneo – Vital Concept ) , Thierry <unk> ( Delko – Marseille Provence KTM ) and Perrig Quéméneur ( Direct Énergie ) . With the peloton not trying hard to chase them , they built a ten @-@ minute lead by the middle of the stage . In the second half of the stage , there was some sunshine , but also strong crosswinds : with Sky , Tinkoff and Etixx – Quick @-@ Step working hard at the front of the peloton , there were splits in the group . Alexander Kristoff was in the second group on the road , but he was able to get back to the front as the groups came together . 
 On the first gravel section , the breakaway 's lead had been reduced to ten seconds and they were soon caught with Sky 's Luke Rowe working at the front of the peloton . Pierre @-@ Luc <unk> ( Fortuneo – Vital Concept ) attacked on the first time over the climb ; he was caught by work from Orica – GreenEDGE as the riders rode through Vendôme . On the second lap , Marcel Kittel was dropped on the final climb and , despite an attack from Tony Gallopin ( Lotto – Soudal ) that was followed by Geraint Thomas , a large group crossed the final climb together . Around 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) from the finish , Edward Theuns ( Trek – Segafredo ) attacked and went under the flamme rouge alone . He was caught , however , by Sky . Sky 's Ben Swift was the first to sprint and came close to taking the victory , but he was passed by Démare in the final metres , with Bouhanni finishing third . 
 Michael Matthews increased his lead by winning two bonus seconds at an intermediate sprint . After finishing fifth at the end of the stage , he retained the yellow jersey ; there were no significant changes to the general classification . Démare said that the stage victory was " an immense relief " after he had failed to win any races in 2015 .

 8 March 2016 — Contres to Commentry , 213 @.@ 5 km ( 132 @.@ 7 mi ) 
 The second road stage was held on a 213 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometre ( 132 @.@ 7 mi ) route from Contres in Loir @-@ et @-@ Cher to Commentry in Allier . The route was flat for almost the entire stage , with only one third @-@ category climb that came 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) from the finish line . After the peloton reached Commentry , there was a lap of a 17 @-@ kilometre ( 11 mi ) circuit with a small , uncategorised climb . The final kilometres were slightly uphill , with a 90 @-@ degree turn at a roundabout 500 metres ( 550 yd ) from the finish line . 
 There was again a four @-@ main breakaway at the beginning of the stage , with Evaldas Šiškevičius ( Delko – Marseille Provence KTM ) , Anthony Delaplace ( Fortuneo – Vital Concept ) , Matthias Brändle ( IAM Cycling ) and <unk> Grmay ( Lampre – Merida ) earning a 10 @-@ minute lead by the time they had raced 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) . This was quickly reduced to under four minutes , however , by Etixx – Quick @-@ Step and Orica – GreenEDGE . On the climb , Delaplace won the maximum points . Grmay dropped out of the break with 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) remaining and as the riders reached Commentry the breakaway had just a 40 @-@ second lead . 
 Šiškevičius and Brändle attacked at the start of the final lap , with Delaplace unable to follow , but with 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) remaining they were caught by the peloton . In the final 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) , Cofidis came to the front on behalf of Bouhanni and gave him a good lead @-@ out . Bouhanni followed the wheel of Christophe Laporte and opened his sprint with 200 metres ( 220 yd ) remaining . He was on the right @-@ hand side of the road , with Michael Matthews coming up on his left . In the final 100 metres ( 330 ft ) , Bouhanni drifted to the left and leaned into Matthews ; the two riders nearly crashed . Bouhanni crossed the line first , with Matthews just beating Niccolò Bonifazio ( Trek – Segafredo ) for second place , but the result was changed shortly after the stage . Bouhanni was relegated to third place after the jury decided that he had driven the sprint dangerously , giving Matthews the stage victory and putting Bonifazio into second . Alexander Kristoff led the rest of the field home , one second behind . Marcel Kittel , one of the favourites for the stage victory , finished 65th .

 9 March 2016 — <unk> to Mont Brouilly , 168 km ( 104 @.@ 4 mi ) 
 The third stage was scheduled to follow a 168 @-@ kilometre ( 104 mi ) route that took the riders east from <unk> in Allier to the climb of Mont Brouilly in Rhône . The route crossed five categorised climbs in the first 120 kilometres ( 75 mi ) , then entered a circuit that took the riders on two climbs of Mont Brouilly , a 3 @-@ kilometre ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) climb at 7 @.@ 7 % with the final 1 @,@ 000 metres ( 1 @,@ 100 yd ) at 9 @.@ 3 % . 
 A group of sixteen riders escaped early in the stage . Alexis Gougeard ( AG2R La Mondiale ) attacked along with Laurent Didier ( Trek – Segafredo ) and Alexey Lutsenko ( Astana ) . They were joined by Jesús Herrada ( Movistar Team ) and Thomas De Gendt ( Lotto – Soudal ) as the rest of the group was caught by the peloton . The stage took place in cold , wintry conditions , with increasing quantities of snow falling and temperatures as low as − 5 ° C ( 23 ° F ) recorded . At the top of the third climb of the day was the <unk> and the racing was suspended there . It was initially intended to restart some way down the road , but several minutes later the decision was taken to neutralise the stage . The results did not count for the general classification , but points were awarded for the intermediate sprints and mountains that had already been contested .

 Stage 4 took the peloton 195 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 121 @.@ 5 mi ) south from <unk> in Rhône to Romans @-@ sur @-@ Isère in the Drôme department . There were three categorised climbs in the stage : two third @-@ category and one second @-@ category . The final climb came 22 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 14 @.@ 0 mi ) from the finish . 
 The early breakaway included four riders . These were Thomas Voeckler ( Direct Énergie ) , Matthew Brammeier ( Dimension Data ) , Florian Vachon ( Fortuneo – Vital Concept ) and Evaldas <unk> ( Delko – Marseille Provence KTM ) . They were not allowed to build a large advantage , with the peloton keeping them just a few minutes ahead . The main action of the day came on the second @-@ category final climb . In the breakaway , now just a minute ahead , Voeckler attacked and dropped the other breakaway riders . Nathan Haas ( Dimension Data ) attacked the peloton at the top of the climb , but made a mistake on a corner and ended up in a field . On the climb , Marcel Kittel and Arnaud Démare were dropped , with Démare then pulling out of the race . Geraint Thomas was one of several riders to crash on the climb , but he was able to return to the peloton . 
 After the climb , with Voeckler being caught , Sylvain Chavanel ( Direct Énergie ) , Sep Vanmarcke ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) and <unk> Fernández ( Delko – Marseille Provence KTM ) attacked and built a lead ; with 7 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) remaining they had a 15 @-@ second lead . Katusha and Cofidis rode very hard in the peloton to bring them back , but the breakaway was finally caught with less than 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) remaining . Cofidis again gave Bouhanni a strong lead @-@ out and he comfortably won the sprint . Edward Theuns ( Trek – Segafredo ) finished second , with Greipel third . Matthews finished fifth to retain his lead of both the general and points classifications . Bouhanni said after the stage that his victory made up for his disqualification on stage 3 .

The stage included five climbs , the most significant of which was the partial climb of Mont Ventoux . This was a first @-@ category climb , taking the riders 9 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 5 @.@ 9 mi ) at an average gradient of 9 @.@ 3 % . Rather than riding all the way to the summit , the riders descended after Chalet Reynard . This climb came with more than 125 kilometres ( 78 mi ) remaining in the stage . Before Mont Ventoux was a third @-@ category climb ; afterwards there were three second @-@ category climbs . The last of these came with 38 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 23 @.@ 9 mi ) to the finish line ; this last section was mostly flat , although there were two sharp left @-@ hand turns in the final 1 @,@ 000 metres ( 1 @,@ 100 yd ) . 
 The early breakaway included Stijn Vandenbergh ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) , Arnaud Courteille ( FDJ ) , Lars Boom ( Astana ) , Wouter Wippert ( Cannondale ) , Edward Theuns ( Trek – Segafredo ) , Matthias Brändle ( IAM ) , Antoine Duchesne ( Direct Énergie ) and Jesús Herrada ( Movistar ) . In the first 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) , their lead extended to over eleven minutes . On the climb of Mont Ventoux , Brändle was dropped from the breakaway , while Bouhanni , Kittel and Greipel were among those dropped from the peloton . Greipel was among seven riders to drop out during the stage . Wippert and Theuns were next to be dropped from the breakaway ; Boom and Vandenbergh were also temporarily dropped but were able to rejoin the front group , although the group 's lead was reduced to just over three minutes by the third climb of the day . Herrada won the first two climbs of the day and came second on the following two to take the lead in the mountains classification , then dropped back to the peloton . 
 Duchesne attacked on the penultimate climb , the Côte de la Roque @-@ d <unk> , and had a 33 @-@ second lead over the peloton . On the descent from the final climb , Alexey Lutsenko ( Astana ) attacked from the peloton and came across to Duchesne . Lutsenko quickly dropped him and , with 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) remaining , had built a 39 @-@ second lead , putting him into the virtual lead of the race . The chase only began in earnest in the final 3 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) , with Katusha chasing on behalf of Alexander Kristoff , but the peloton were unable to catch Lutsenko and he crossed the line for a solo victory , 21 seconds ahead of the chasing group . Kristoff won the sprint for second , with Matthews finishing third . Lutsenko moved into second place overall , six seconds behind Matthews . 
 After the stage , Matthews said that he felt he could win the overall general classification . He said , " I think if I can survive Saturday [ Stage 5 ] , I can win . With the way I ’ ve been climbing , I think it ’ s possible . " Contador , meanwhile , said that the final climb of Stage 6 was not very steep and that it might be difficult to put significant time into Matthews .

 12 March 2016 — Nice to Madone d 'Utelle , 177 km ( 110 @.@ 0 mi ) 
 The penultimate stage of the race took the riders 177 kilometres ( 110 mi ) through the Alpes @-@ Maritimes . The route started on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice , then left the city to the north for a course that included seven categorised climbs . The first 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) of racing crossed two second @-@ category climbs , which were followed by a 35 @-@ kilometre ( 22 mi ) section of flat roads and descents . This was followed by another second @-@ category climb and a first @-@ category climb , the 8 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometre ( 5 @.@ 3 mi ) Côte d <unk> with its average gradient of 5 @.@ 4 % . After a long descent came two more second @-@ category climbs , bringing the riders to <unk> . They had a summit finish at the shrine of the Madone d 'Utelle above the city , with a 15 @.@ 3 @-@ kilometre ( 9 @.@ 5 mi ) climb at an average gradient of 5 @.@ 7 % . The climb was fairly regular , but had two sections above 9 % , including the final 300 metres ( 330 yd ) . 
 The day 's breakaway included nine riders . These were Antoine Duchesne ( Direct Énergie ) , Florian Vachon ( Fortuneo – Vital Concept ) , Niki Terpstra ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) , Cyril Gautier ( AG2R La Mondiale ) , Grégory Rast ( Trek – Segafredo ) , Evaldas Šiškevičius ( Delko – Marseille Provence KTM ) , <unk> Grmay ( Lampre – Merida ) , Andrew Talansky ( Cannondale ) and Thomas De Gendt ( Lotto – Soudal ) . The gap never exceeded two and a half minutes , with Tinkoff chasing hard on behalf of Contador and , with 55 kilometres ( 34 mi ) remaining , was just one minute . De Gendt won the first four climbs to move into second in the mountains classification , while Rast and Šiškevičius were dropped . Talansky crashed on one of the descents and abandoned the race with a wrist injury . Vachon and Duchesne dropped the rest of the breakaway and continued alone , but with 35 kilometres ( 22 mi ) Duchesne was left alone , just over a minute ahead of the peloton . He won the fifth and sixth climbs of the day and moved into the lead of the mountains classification . 
 As the riders approached the final climb of the day , Sky came to the front of the peloton . With 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) remaining , Duchesne was caught , and the peloton was reduced to 30 riders . Matthews , the race leader , was among those dropped from the leading group . With 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) remaining , Rafał Majka ( Tinkoff ) attacked , with Contador following ; this caused the group to halve in size and Sky were reduced to two riders , Thomas and Sergio Henao . Porte , Dumoulin , Izagirre , Bardet and Katusha 's Ilnur Zakarin were among those left in the group . With 5 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 4 mi ) remaining , Majka pulled off and a group of five leaders formed : Contador , Thomas , Henao , Porte and Zakarin . Contador and Porte attempted attacks but were unable to escape the group , with Henao supporting Thomas . In the final kilometre , Porte was dropped and Zakarin accelerated . Thomas and Contador followed , but Zakarin took the stage victory . Thomas finished second , on the same time as Zakarin , and Contador was a second back in third . Thomas therefore moved into the race lead , fifteen seconds ahead of Contador .

 13 March 2016 — Nice to Nice , 134 km ( 83 @.@ 3 mi ) 
 The final stage was a 134 @-@ kilometre ( 83 mi ) loop that started and ended on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice . The route took the riders out of Nice to the north . They crossed two third @-@ category climbs , then came back south for two second @-@ category climbs . The final 64 kilometres ( 40 mi ) included two first @-@ category climbs . The first was the Côte de Peille , a 6 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometre ( 4 @.@ 0 mi ) climb at 6 @.@ 9 % . The riders then descended into the outskirts of Nice . Here they turned back inland for a final climb , the 7 @.@ 7 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 8 mi ) of the Col d 'Èze at an average gradient of 5 @.@ 7 % . They then descended back into Nice , where the final 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) were fairly flat , before ended on the Promenade des Anglais at the Albert I Garden . 
 The stage began with an 18 @-@ rider breakaway within the first five minutes of racing . This included Contador 's teammate Robert Kišerlovski and this group was joined shortly afterwards by several more riders , including Yuri Trofimov , another Tinkoff rider , while others were dropped and returned to the peloton . Thomas De Gendt and Antoine Duchesne were again in the breakaway ; Duchesne won the first four climbs of the day , with De Gendt second on each occasion . Duchesne won enough points to secure victory in the mountains classification . 
 On the Côte de Peille , Contador attacked in the peloton . He quickly built an advantage , with Kiserlovski and Trofimov dropping back from the breakaway to assist him . They built a lead of around a minute , but Team Sky pulled the lead back and Contador 's group was caught by the foot of the Col d 'Èze , with only Tim Wellens ( Lotto – Soudal ) ahead . Romain Bardet attacked , but Contador chased him down . Contador himself attacked several times , with Sky 's Sergio Henao and the Orica – GreenEDGE team chasing him down ; Thomas appeared to be struggling . In the final part of the climb , Contador got away , initially with Majka and then with Richie Porte . At the top of the climb , they caught Wellens and had a 30 @-@ second advantage over the chasing group . 
 Thomas had been dropped not only by Contador but also by the first chasing group , which included Ilnur Zakarin . Thomas was joined , however , by Sergio Henao . The two Sky riders then joined up with Tony Gallopin ( Lotto – Soudal ) and chased hard throughout the 15 @-@ kilometre ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) descent . They caught the first chasing group on the descent , forming a ten @-@ man group behind Contador , Porte and Wellens . The gap was gradually reduced and was just five seconds by the finish . Wellens won the three @-@ man sprint , with Contador second and Porte third . Gallopin won the sprint for fourth place . Thomas therefore won the overall general classification , beating Contador by four seconds . 
 = = Post @-@ race analysis = = 
 Thomas said after the race that his victory demonstrated that he could compete with the top stage racers in the world . He said that Henao 's presence had been crucial to his victory and that , before the stage , he had chosen a 54 @-@ tooth <unk> to help him chase back on if he was dropped on the final climb . He also said that he owed Gallopin " a few beers " for his assistance in chasing back to the leading groups on the final stage . Gallopin , meanwhile said that he had been happy to contribute to the chase of the second group on the final stage in order to have both a man in the leading group and in the chasing group . He added that he was also glad to help Thomas as the two men were friends and exchanged text messages whenever Thomas 's Wales played Gallopin 's France at rugby . 
 Contador 's approach to Stage 7 was described by Cycling Weekly as a " tactical masterpiece " . Contador himself said that the team had executed their strategy perfectly . His directeur sportif , Sean Yates , said that the team were " nearly there " in their attempt to take the overall victory and suggested that the cancellation of Stage 3 may have prevented Contador from winning the race . Richie Porte said that his performance , especially in the final stage , had given him confidence going into the rest of the season . He said that he had not been sure of his form going into the stage and that it was a good sign for the future , as Paris – Nice had been very difficult . 
 = = = UCI World Tour standings = = = 
 Porte 's third @-@ place finish was his second consecutive podium place in the season @-@ long UCI World Tour competition , following his second @-@ place finish at the Tour Down Under . He moved up into first place overall , while Henao moved up from third to second , with the previous leader , Simon Gerrans ( Orica – GreenEDGE ) dropping to third . Thomas moved into fourth and Contador into fifth , with Zakarin and Izagirre also moving into the top ten . Australia remained top of the nations ' ranking , while Sky moved to the top of the teams ' ranking . 
 = = Classification leadership table = = 
 In the 2016 Paris – Nice , three jerseys were awarded . The general classification was calculated by adding each cyclist 's finishing times on each stage . Time bonuses were awarded to the first three finishers on road stages ( Stages 1 – 7 ) : the stage winner won a ten @-@ second bonus , with six and four seconds for the second and third riders respectively . Bonus seconds were also awarded to the first three riders at intermediate sprints ( three seconds for the winner of the sprint , two seconds for the rider in second and one second for the rider in third ) . The leader of the general classification received a yellow jersey . 
 The second classification was the points classification . Riders were awarded points for finishing in the top ten in a stage . Unlike in the points classification in the Tour de France , the winners of all stages were awarded the same number of points . Points were also won in intermediate sprints ; three points for crossing the sprint line first , two points for second place , and one for third . The leader of the points classification was awarded a green jersey . 
 There was also a mountains classification , in which points were awarded for reaching the top of a climb before other riders . Each climb was categorised as either first , second , or third @-@ category , with more points available for the more difficult , higher @-@ categorised climbs . For first @-@ category climbs , the top seven riders earned points ; on second @-@ category climbs , five riders won points ; on third @-@ category climbs , only the top three riders earned points . The leadership of the mountains classification was marked by a white jersey with red polka @-@ dots . 
 There was also a classification for teams , in which the times of the best three cyclists in a team on each stage were added together ; the leading team at the end of the race was the team with the lowest cumulative time . 
 = John Chrysostom = 
 John Chrysostom ( / <unk> , <unk> / ; Greek : Ἰωάννης ὁ <unk> ) , c . 349 – 407 , Archbishop of Constantinople , was an important Early Church Father . He is known for his preaching and public speaking , his denunciation of abuse of authority by both ecclesiastical and political leaders , the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom , and his ascetic sensibilities . The epithet <unk> ( Chrysostomos , anglicized as Chrysostom ) means " golden @-@ mouthed " in Greek and denotes his celebrated eloquence . 
 He is honored as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic churches , as well as in some others . The Eastern Orthodox , together with the Byzantine Catholics , hold him in special regard as one of the Three Holy Hierarchs ( alongside Basil the Great and Gregory of Nazianzus ) . The feast days of John Chrysostom in the Eastern Orthodox Church are 13 November and 27 January . In the Roman Catholic Church he is recognized as a Doctor of the Church and commemorated on 13 September . Other churches of the Western tradition , including some Anglican provinces and some Lutheran churches , also commemorate him on 13 September . However , certain Lutheran churches and Anglican provinces commemorate him on the traditional Eastern feast day of 27 January . The Coptic Church also recognizes him as a saint ( with feast days on 16 <unk> and 17 Hathor ) . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life and education = = = 
 John was born in Antioch in 349 to Greco @-@ Syrian parents . Different scholars describe his mother <unk> as a pagan or as a Christian , and his father was a high @-@ ranking military officer . John 's father died soon after his birth and he was raised by his mother . He was baptised in 368 or 373 and tonsured as a reader ( one of the minor orders of the Church ) . 
 As a result of his mother 's influential connections in the city , John began his education under the pagan teacher Libanius . From Libanius , John acquired the skills for a career in rhetoric , as well as a love of the Greek language and literature . 
 As he grew older , however , John became more deeply committed to Christianity and went on to study theology under <unk> of Tarsus , founder of the re @-@ constituted School of Antioch . According to the Christian historian Sozomen , Libanius was supposed to have said on his deathbed that John would have been his successor " if the Christians had not taken him from us " . 
 John lived in extreme asceticism and became a hermit in about 375 ; he spent the next two years continually standing , scarcely sleeping , and committing the Bible to memory . As a consequence of these practices , his stomach and kidneys were permanently damaged and poor health forced him to return to Antioch . 
 = = = <unk> and service in Antioch = = = 
 John was ordained as a deacon in 381 by Saint Meletius of Antioch who was not then in communion with Alexandria and Rome . After the death of Meletius , John separated himself from the followers of Meletius , without joining Paulinus , the rival of Meletius for the bishopric of Antioch . But after the death of Paulinus he was ordained a presbyter ( priest ) in 386 by Evagrius , the successor of Paulinus . He was destined later to bring about reconciliation between Flavian I of Antioch , Alexandria , and Rome , thus bringing those three sees into communion for the first time in nearly seventy years . 
 In Antioch , over the course of twelve years ( 386 – 397 ) , John gained popularity because of the eloquence of his public speaking at the Golden Church , Antioch 's cathedral , especially his insightful expositions of Bible passages and moral teaching . The most valuable of his works from this period are his Homilies on various books of the Bible . He emphasised charitable giving and was concerned with the spiritual and temporal needs of the poor . He spoke against abuse of wealth and personal property : 
 Do you wish to honour the body of Christ ? Do not ignore him when he is naked . Do not pay him homage in the temple clad in silk , only then to neglect him outside where he is cold and ill @-@ clad . He who said : " This is my body " is the same who said : " You saw me hungry and you gave me no food " , and " Whatever you did to the least of my brothers you did also to me " ... What good is it if the Eucharistic table is overloaded with golden chalices when your brother is dying of hunger ? Start by satisfying his hunger and then with what is left you may adorn the altar as well . 
 His straightforward understanding of the Scriptures – in contrast to the Alexandrian tendency towards allegorical interpretation – meant that the themes of his talks were practical , explaining the Bible 's application to everyday life . Such straightforward preaching helped Chrysostom to garner popular support . He founded a series of hospitals in Constantinople to care for the poor . 
 One incident that happened during his service in Antioch illustrates the influence of his homilies . When Chrysostom arrived in Antioch , Flavian , the bishop of the city had to intervene with Emperor Theodosius I on behalf of citizens who had gone on a rampage mutilating statues of the Emperor and his family . During the weeks of Lent in 387 , John preached more than twenty homilies in which he entreated the people to see the error of their ways . These made a lasting impression on the general population of the city : many pagans converted to Christianity as a result of the homilies . As a result , Theodosius ' vengeance was not as severe as it might have been . 
 = = = Archbishop of Constantinople = = = 
 In the autumn of 397 , John was appointed Archbishop of Constantinople , after having been nominated without his knowledge by the eunuch Eutropius . He had to leave Antioch in secret due to fears that the departure of such a popular figure would cause civil unrest . 
 During his time as Archbishop he adamantly refused to host lavish social gatherings , which made him popular with the common people , but unpopular with wealthy citizens and the clergy . His reforms of the clergy were also unpopular . He told visiting regional preachers to return to the churches they were meant to be serving — without any payout . 
 His time in Constantinople was more tumultuous than his time in Antioch . Theophilus , the Patriarch of Alexandria , wanted to bring Constantinople under his sway and opposed John 's appointment to Constantinople . Theophilus had disciplined four Egyptian monks ( known as " the Tall Brothers " ) over their support of Origen 's teachings . They fled to John and were welcomed by him . Theophilus therefore accused John of being too partial to the teaching of Origen . He made another enemy in Aelia Eudoxia , wife of Emperor Arcadius , who assumed that John 's denunciations of extravagance in feminine dress were aimed at herself . Eudoxia , Theophilus and other of his enemies held a synod in 403 ( the Synod of the Oak ) to charge John , in which his connection to Origen was used against him . It resulted in his deposition and banishment . He was called back by Arcadius almost immediately , as the people became " tumultuous " over his departure , even threatening to burn the royal palace . There was an earthquake the night of his arrest , which Eudoxia took for a sign of God 's anger , prompting her to ask Arcadius for John 's reinstatement . 
 Peace was short @-@ lived . A silver statue of Eudoxia was erected in the <unk> , near his cathedral . John denounced the pagan dedication ceremonies . He spoke against her in harsh terms : " Again Herodias raves ; again she is troubled ; she dances again ; and again desires to receive John 's head in a charger " , an allusion to the events surrounding the death of John the Baptist . Once again he was banished , this time to the Caucasus in Abkhazia . 
 Around 405 , Chrysostom began to lend moral and financial support to Christian monks who were enforcing the emperors ' anti @-@ Pagan laws , by destroying temples and shrines in Phoenicia and nearby regions . 
 = = = Death and canonization = = = 
 Faced with exile , John Chrysostom wrote an appeal for help to three churchmen : Pope Innocent I , the Bishop of Milan , <unk> , and the third to the Bishop of Aquileia , <unk> . In 1872 , church historian William Stephens wrote , " The Patriarch of the Eastern Rome appeals to the great bishops of the West , as the champions of an ecclesiastical discipline which he confesses himself unable to enforce , or to see any prospect of establishing . No jealousy is entertained of the Patriarch of the Old Rome by the Patriarch of the New Rome . The interference of Innocent is courted , a certain primacy is accorded him , but at the same time he is not addressed as a supreme arbitrator ; assistance and sympathy are solicited from him as from an elder brother , and two other prelates of Italy are joint recipients with him of the appeal . " 
 Pope Innocent I protested John 's banishment from Constantinople to the town of <unk> in Cappadocia , but to no avail . Innocent sent a delegation to intercede on behalf of John in 405 . It was led by <unk> of Brescia ; <unk> and his companions , two bishops , encountered many difficulties and never reached their goal of entering Constantinople . 
 John wrote letters which still held great influence in Constantinople . As a result of this , he was further exiled from the Caucasus ( where he stayed from 404 to 407 ) to <unk> ( <unk> ) ( in modern Abkhazia ) where his tomb is a shrine for pilgrims . He never reached this destination , as he died at Comana Pontica on 14 September 407 during the journey . His last words are said to have been " <unk> τῷ <unk> <unk> <unk> " ( Glory be to God for all things ) . 
 John came to be venerated as a saint soon after his death . Three decades later , some of his adherents in Constantinople remained in schism . Saint Proclus , Patriarch of Constantinople ( 434 – 446 ) , hoping to bring about the reconciliation of the <unk> , preached a homily praising his predecessor in the Church of Hagia Sophia . He said , " O John , your life was filled with sorrow , but your death was glorious . Your grave is blessed and reward is great , by the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ O graced one , having conquered the bounds of time and place ! Love has conquered space , <unk> memory has annihilated the limits , and place does not hinder the miracles of the saint . " 
 These homilies helped to mobilize public opinion , and the patriarch received permission from the emperor to return Chrysostom 's relics to Constantinople , where they were enshrined in the Church of the Holy Apostles on 28 January 438 . The Eastern Orthodox Church commemorates him as a " Great Ecumenical Teacher " , with Basil the Great and Gregory the Theologian . These three saints , in addition to having their own individual commemorations throughout the year , are commemorated together on 30 January , a feast known as the Synaxis of the Three Hierarchs . 
 There are several feast days dedicated to him : 
 27 January , Translation of the relics of St John Chrysostom from Comana to Constantinople 
 30 January , Synaxis of the Three Great Hierarchs 
 14 September , Repose of St John Chrysostom 
 13 November , St John Chrysostom the Archbishop of Constantinople

 The best known of his many homilies , the Paschal Homily ( <unk> ) , is rather brief . In the Eastern Orthodox Church it is traditionally read in full each year at the Paschal Divine Liturgy ( eucharistic ) service following the midnight <unk> ( or Matins ) . 
 = = = = General = = = = 
 Chrysostom 's extant <unk> works are vast , including many hundreds of exegetical homilies on both the New Testament ( especially the works of Saint Paul ) and the Old Testament ( particularly on Genesis ) . Among his extant exegetical works are sixty @-@ seven homilies on Genesis , fifty @-@ nine on the Psalms , ninety on the Gospel of Matthew , eighty @-@ eight on the Gospel of John , and fifty @-@ five on the Acts of the Apostles . 
 The homilies were written down by stenographers and subsequently circulated , revealing a style that tended to be direct and greatly personal , but formed by the rhetorical conventions of his time and place . In general , his <unk> theology displays much characteristic of the Antiochian school ( i.e. , somewhat more literal in interpreting Biblical events ) , but he also uses a good deal of the allegorical interpretation more associated with the Alexandrian school . 
 John 's social and religious world was formed by the continuing and pervasive presence of paganism in the life of the city . One of his regular topics was the paganism in the culture of Constantinople , and in his homilies he thunders against popular pagan amusements : the theatre , <unk> , and the revelry surrounding holidays . In particular , he criticized Christians for taking part in such activities : 
 " If you ask [ Christians ] who is Amos or Obadiah , how many apostles there were or prophets , they stand mute ; but if you ask them about the horses or drivers , they answer with more solemnity than sophists or <unk> " . 
 One of the recurring features of John 's homilies is his emphasis on care for the needy . Echoing themes found in the Gospel of Matthew , he calls upon the rich to lay aside materialism in favor of helping the poor , often employing all of his rhetorical skills to shame wealthy people to abandon conspicuous consumption : 
 " Do you pay such honor to your excrements as to receive them into a silver chamber @-@ pot when another man made in the image of God is perishing in the cold ? " 
 = = = = Homilies on Jews and Judaizing Christians = = = = 
 During his first two years as a presbyter in Antioch ( 386 – 387 ) , John denounced Jews and Judaizing Christians in a series of eight homilies delivered to Christians in his congregation who were taking part in Jewish festivals and other Jewish observances . It is disputed whether the main target were specifically Judaizers or Jews in general . His homilies were expressed in the conventional manner , utilizing the uncompromising rhetorical form known as the <unk> ( Greek : blame , censure ) . 
 One of the purposes of these homilies was to prevent Christians from participating in Jewish customs , and thus prevent the perceived erosion of Chrysostom 's flock . In his homilies , John criticized those " Judaizing Christians " , who were participating in Jewish festivals and taking part in other Jewish observances , such as the <unk> , submitted to circumcision and made pilgrimage to Jewish holy places . 
 John claimed that synagogues were full of Christians on the <unk> and Jewish festivals , especially of Christian women , because they loved the solemnity of the Jewish liturgy and enjoyed listening to the shofar on Rosh Hashanah , and applauded famous preachers in accordance with the contemporary custom . A more recent theory is that he instead tried to persuade Jewish Christians , who for centuries had kept connections with Jews and Judaism , to choose between Judaism and Christianity . 
 In Greek the homilies are called Kata <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , which is translated as Adversus <unk> in Latin and Against the Jews in English . The original Benedictine editor of the homilies , Bernard de Montfaucon , gives the following footnote to the title : " A discourse against the Jews ; but it was delivered against those who were Judaizing and keeping the fasts with them [ the Jews ] . " 
 According to <unk> scholars , opposition to any particular view during the late 4th century was conventionally expressed in a manner , utilizing the rhetorical form known as the <unk> , whose literary conventions were to vilify opponents in an uncompromising manner ; thus , it has been argued that to call Chrysostom an " anti @-@ Semite " is to employ anachronistic terminology in a way incongruous with historical context and record . This does not preclude assertions that Chrysostom 's theology was a form of Anti @-@ Jewish <unk> . 
 = = = Treatises = = = 
 Apart from his homilies , a number of John 's other treatises have had a lasting influence . One such work is John 's early treatise Against Those Who <unk> the Monastic Life , written while he was a deacon ( sometime before 386 ) , which was directed to parents , pagan as well as Christian , whose sons were contemplating a monastic vocation . Chrysostom wrote that , already in his day , it was customary for Antiochenes to send their sons to be educated by monks . 
 Other important treatises written by John include On the Priesthood ( written 390 / 391 , it contains in Book 1 an account of his early years and a defence of his flight from ordination by Bishop <unk> of Antioch , and then proceeds in later books to expound on his exalted understanding of the priesthood ) , Instructions to Catechumens , and On the <unk> of the Divine Nature . In addition , he wrote a series of letters to the deaconess Olympias , of which seventeen are extant . 
 = = = Liturgy = = = 
 Beyond his preaching , the other lasting legacy of John is his influence on Christian liturgy . Two of his writings are particularly notable . He harmonized the liturgical life of the Church by revising the prayers and rubrics of the Divine Liturgy , or celebration of the Holy Eucharist . To this day , Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches of the Byzantine Rite typically celebrate the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom as the normal Eucharistic liturgy , although his exact connection with it remains a matter of debate among experts . 
 = = Legacy and influence = = 
 During a time when city clergy were subject to criticism for their high lifestyle , John was determined to reform his clergy in Constantinople . These efforts were met with resistance and limited success . He was an excellent preacher whose homilies and writings are still studied and quoted . As a theologian , he has been and continues to be very important in Eastern Christianity , and is generally considered the most prominent doctor of the Greek Church , but has been less important to Western Christianity . His writings have survived to the present day more so than any of the other Greek Fathers . 
 = = = Influence on the Catechism of the Catholic Church and clergy = = = 
 John 's influence on church teachings is interwoven throughout the current Catechism of the Catholic Church ( revised 1992 ) . The Catechism cites him in eighteen sections , particularly his reflections on the purpose of prayer and the meaning of the Lord 's Prayer : 
 Consider how [ Jesus Christ ] teaches us to be humble , by making us see that our virtue does not depend on our work alone but on grace from on high . He commands each of the faithful who prays to do so universally , for the whole world . For he did not say " thy will be done in me or in us " , but " on earth " , the whole earth , so that error may be banished from it , truth take root in it , all vice be destroyed on it , virtue flourish on it , and earth no longer differ from heaven . 
 Christian clerics , such as R.S. Storr , refer to him as " one of the most eloquent preachers who ever since apostolic times have brought to men the divine tidings of truth and love " , and the 19th @-@ century John Henry Newman described John as a " bright , cheerful , gentle soul ; a sensitive heart . " 
 = = = Music and literature = = = 
 John 's liturgical legacy has inspired several musical compositions . Particularly noteworthy are Sergei Rachmaninoff 's Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom , Op. 31 , composed in 1910 , one of his two major unaccompanied choral works ; Pyotr Tchaikovsky 's Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom , Op. 41 ; and Ukrainian composer Kyrylo Stetsenko 's Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom . Arvo Pärt 's Litany sets Chrysostom 's twenty @-@ four prayers , one for each hour of the day , for soli , mixed choir and orchestra . 
 James Joyce 's novel Ulysses includes a character named Mulligan who brings ' Chrysostomos ' into another character ( Stephen Dedalus ) ' s mind because Mulligan 's gold @-@ stopped teeth and his gift of the gab earn him the title which St. John Chrysostom 's preaching earned him , ' golden @-@ mouthed ' : " [ Mulligan ] peered sideways up and gave a long low whistle of call , then paused awhile in rapt attention , his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points . Chrysostomos " .

 A late medieval legend ( not included in the Golden Legend ) relates that , when John Chrysostom was a hermit in the desert , he was approached by a royal princess in distress . The Saint , thinking she was a demon , at first refused to help her , but the princess convinced him that she was a Christian and would be devoured by wild beasts if she were not allowed to enter his cave . He therefore admitted her , carefully dividing the cave in two parts , one for each of them . In spite of these precautions , the sin of fornication was committed , and in an attempt to hide it , the distraught saint took the princess and threw her over a precipice . He then went to Rome to beg absolution , which was refused . Realising the appalling nature of his crimes , Chrysostom made a vow that he would never rise from the ground until his sins were expiated , and for years he lived like a beast , crawling on all fours and feeding on wild grasses and roots . Subsequently the princess reappeared , alive , and suckling the saint 's baby , who miraculously pronounced his sins forgiven . This last scene was very popular from the late 15th century onwards as a subject for engravers and artists . The theme was depicted by Albrecht Dürer around 1496 , Hans Sebald <unk> and Lucas Cranach the Elder , among others . Martin Luther mocked this same legend in his Die <unk> von S. Johanne <unk> ( 1537 ) . The legend was recorded in Croatia in the 16th century . 
 = = = Relics = = = 
 John Chrysostom died in the city of Comana in the year 407 on his way to his place of exile . There his relics remained until 438 when , thirty years after his death , they were transferred to Constantinople during the reign of the Empress Eudoxia 's son , the Emperor Theodosius II ( 408 – 450 ) , under the guidance of John 's disciple , St. Proclus , who by that time had become Archbishop of Constantinople ( 434 – 447 ) . 
 Most of John 's relics were looted from Constantinople by Crusaders in 1204 and taken to Rome , but some of his bones were returned to the Orthodox Church on 27 November 2004 by Pope John Paul II . They are now enshrined in the Church of St. George , Istanbul . 
 The skull , however , having been kept at the monastery at Vatopedi on Mount Athos in northern Greece , was not among the relics that were taken by the crusaders in the 13th century . In 1655 , at the request of Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich , the skull was taken to Russia , for which the monastery was compensated in the sum of 2000 rubles . In 1693 , having received a request from the Vatopedi Monastery for the return of St John 's skull , Tsar Peter the Great ordered that the skull remain in Russia but that the monastery was to be paid 500 rubles every four years . The Russian state archives document these payments up until 1735 . The skull was kept at the Moscow Kremlin , in the Cathedral of the Dormition of the Mother of God , until 1920 , when it was confiscated by the Soviets and placed in the Museum of Silver Antiquities . In 1988 , in connection with the 1000th Anniversary of the Baptism of Russia , the head , along with other important relics , was returned to the Russian Orthodox Church and kept at the Epiphany Cathedral , until being moved to the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour after its restoration . 
 Today , the monastery at Vatopedi posits a rival claim to possessing the skull of John Chrysostom , and there a skull is venerated by pilgrims to the monastery as that of St John . Two sites in Italy also claim to have the saint 's skull : the Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence and the Dal Pozzo chapel in Pisa . The right hand of St. John is preserved on Mount Athos , and numerous smaller relics are scattered throughout the world .

 = Clydesdale horse = 
 The Clydesdale is a breed of draught horse derived from the farm horses of Clydesdale , Scotland , and named after that region . Although originally one of the smaller breeds of draught horses , it is now a tall breed . Often bay in color , they show significant white markings due to the presence of sabino genetics . The breed was originally used for agriculture and haulage , and is still used for draught purposes today . The Budweiser Clydesdales are some of the most famous Clydesdales , and other members of the breed are used as drum horses by the British Household Cavalry . They have also been used to create and improve other draught breeds . 
 The breed was developed from Flemish stallions imported to Scotland and crossed with local mares . The first recorded use of the name " Clydesdale " for the breed was in 1826 , and by 1830 a system of hiring stallions had begun that resulted in the spread of Clydesdale horses throughout Scotland and into northern England . The first breed registry was formed in 1877 . In the late 19th and early 20th centuries , thousands of Clydesdales were exported from Scotland and sent throughout the world , including to Australia and New Zealand , where they became known as " the breed that built Australia " . However , during World War I population numbers began to decline due to increasing mechanization and war conscription . This decline continued , and by the 1970s , the Rare Breeds Survival Trust considered the breed vulnerable to extinction . Population numbers have increased slightly in the intervening time , but they are still thought to be vulnerable . 
 = = Breed characteristics = = 
 The conformation of the Clydesdale has changed greatly throughout its history . In the 1920s and 1930s , it was a compact horse smaller than the Shire , Percheron , and Belgian . Beginning in the 1940s , breeding animals were selected to produce taller horses that looked more impressive in parades and shows . Today , the Clydesdale stands 16 to 18 hands ( 64 to 72 inches , 163 to 183 cm ) high and weighs 1 @,@ 800 to 2 @,@ 000 pounds ( 820 to 910 kg ) . Some mature males are larger , standing taller than 18 hands and weighing up to 2 @,@ 200 pounds ( 1 @,@ 000 kg ) . The breed has a straight or slightly convex facial profile , broad forehead and wide muzzle . It is well muscled and strong , with an arched neck , high withers , and a sloped shoulder . Breed associations pay close attention to the quality of the hooves and legs , as well as the general movement . Their gaits are active , with clearly lifted hooves and a general impression of power and quality . Clydesdales are energetic , with a manner described by the Clydesdale Horse Society as a " gaiety of carriage and outlook " . Clydesdales have been identified to be at risk for chronic progressive lymphedema , a disease with clinical signs that include progressive swelling , hyperkeratosis , and fibrosis of distal limbs that is similar to chronic lymphedema in humans . 
 Clydesdales are usually bay in colour , but roan , black , grey , and chestnut also occur . Most have white markings , including white on the face , feet , legs and occasional body spotting ( generally on the lower belly ) . They also have extensive feathering on their lower legs . <unk> , body spotting and extensive white markings are thought to be the result of sabino genetics . Some Clydesdale breeders want white face and leg markings without the spotting on the body . To attempt getting the ideal set of markings , they often breed horses with only one white leg to horses with four white legs and sabino roaning on their bodies . On average , the result is a foal with the desired amount of white markings . Clydesdales do not have the SB1 ( Sabino 1 ) gene responsible for causing sabino expressions in many other breeds , and researchers theorise that several other genes are responsible for these patterns . Many buyers pay a premium for bay and black horses , especially those with four white legs and white facial markings . Specific colours are often preferred over other physical traits , and some buyers even choose horses with soundness problems if they have the desired colour and markings . Roan horses are not preferred by buyers , despite one draught @-@ breed writer theorizing that they are needed to keep the desired coat colours and texture . Breed associations , however , state that no colours are bad , and that horses with roaning and body spots are increasingly accepted . 
 = = History = = 
 The Clydesdale takes its name from Clydesdale , the old name for Lanarkshire , noted for the River Clyde . In the mid @-@ 18th century , Flemish stallions were imported to Scotland and bred to local mares , resulting in foals that were larger than the existing local stock . These included a black unnamed stallion imported from England by a John Paterson of <unk> and an unnamed dark @-@ brown stallion owned by the Duke of Hamilton . Another prominent stallion was a 16 @.@ 1 hands ( 65 inches , 165 cm ) coach horse stallion of unknown lineage named Blaze . Written pedigrees were kept of these foals beginning in the early 19th century , and in 1806 a filly , later known as " <unk> mare " after the farm name of her owner , was born that traced her lineage to the black stallion . This mare is listed in the ancestry of almost every Clydesdale living today . One of her foals was Thompson 's Black Horse ( known as <unk> ) , who was to have a significant influence on the Clydesdale breed . The first recorded use of the name " Clydesdale " in reference to the breed was in 1826 at an exhibition in Glasgow . Another theory of their origin , that of them descending from Flemish horses brought to Scotland as early as the 15th century , was also promulgated in the late 18th century . However , even the author of that theory admitted that the common story of their ancestry is more likely . 
 A system of hiring stallions between districts existed in Scotland , with written records dating back to 1837 . This program consisted of local agriculture improvement societies holding breed shows to choose the best stallion , whose owner was then awarded a monetary prize . The owner was then required , in return for additional monies , to take the stallion throughout a designated area , breeding to the local mares . Through this system and by purchase , Clydesdale stallions were sent throughout Scotland and into northern England . 
 Through extensive crossbreeding with local mares , these stallions spread the Clydesdale type throughout the areas where they were placed , and by 1840 , Scottish draught horses and the Clydesdale were one and the same . In 1877 , the Clydesdale Horse Society of Scotland was formed , followed in 1879 by the American Clydesdale Association ( later renamed the Clydesdale Breeders of the USA ) , which served both U.S. and Canadian breed enthusiasts . The first American stud book was published in 1882 . In 1883 , the short @-@ lived Select Clydesdale Horse Society was founded to compete with the Clydesdale Horse Society . It was started by two breeders dedicated to improving the breed , who also were responsible in large part for the introduction of Shire blood into the Clydesdale . 
 Large numbers of Clydesdales were exported from Scotland in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , with 1 @,@ 617 stallions leaving the country in 1911 alone . Between 1884 and 1945 , export certificates were issued for 20 @,@ 183 horses . These horses were exported to other countries in the British Empire , as well as North and South America , continental Europe and Russia . World War I saw the conscription of thousands of horses for the war effort , and after the war breed numbers declined as farms became increasingly mechanised . This decline continued between the wars . Following World War II the number of Clydesdale breeding stallions in England dropped from more than 200 in 1946 to 80 in 1949 . By 1975 , the Rare Breeds Survival Trust considered them vulnerable to extinction , meaning there were fewer than 900 breeding females in the UK . 
 Many of the horses exported from Scotland in the 19th and 20th centuries went to Australia and New Zealand . In 1918 , the Commonwealth Clydesdale Horse Society was formed as the association for the breed in Australia . Between 1906 and 1936 , Clydesdales were bred so extensively in Australia that other draught breeds were almost unknown . By the late 1960s it was noted that " Excellent Clydesdale horses are bred in Victoria and New Zealand ; but , at least in the former place , it is considered advisable to keep up the type by frequent importations from England . " Over 25 @,@ 000 Clydesdales were registered in Australia between 1924 and 2008 . The popularity of the Clydesdale led to it being called " the breed that built Australia " . 
 In the 1990s , the breed 's popularity and numbers began to rise . By 2005 , the Rare Breeds Survival Trust had moved the breed to " at risk " status , meaning there were fewer than 1 @,@ 500 breeding females in the UK . However , by 2010 they had been moved back to vulnerable . The Clydesdale is considered to be at " watch " status by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy , meaning that as of 2010 fewer than 2 @,@ 500 horses are registered annually in the USA and fewer than 10 @,@ 000 exist worldwide . As of 2010 , there are estimated to be around 5 @,@ 000 Clydesdales worldwide , with around 4 @,@ 000 in the US and Canada , 800 in the UK and the rest in other countries , including Russia , Japan , Germany and South Africa . 
 = = Uses = = 
 The Clydesdale was originally used for agriculture , hauling coal in Lanarkshire and heavy hauling in Glasgow . Today , Clydesdales are still used for draught purposes , including agriculture , logging and driving . They are also shown and ridden , as well as kept for pleasure . Some of the most famous members of the breed are the teams that make up the hitches of the Budweiser Clydesdales . These horses were first owned by the Budweiser Brewery at the end of Prohibition in the United States , and have since become an international symbol of both the breed and the brand . The Budweiser breeding program , with its strict standards of colour and conformation , have influenced the look of the breed in the United States to the point that many people believe that Clydesdales are always bay with white markings . As well as being driven , some Clydesdales are used for riding and can be shown under saddle . Clydesdales and Shires are used by the British Household Cavalry as drum horses , leading parades on ceremonial and state occasions . The horses are eye @-@ catching colours , including piebald , skewbald and roan . To be used for this purpose , a drum horse must stand a minimum of 17 hands ( 68 inches , 173 cm ) high . They carry the Musical Ride Officer and two silver drums weighing 56 kilograms ( 123 lb ) each . 
 In the late 19th century , Clydesdale blood was added to the Irish draught breed in an attempt to improve and reinvigorate that declining breed . However , these efforts were not seen as successful , as Irish Draught breeders thought the Clydesdale blood made their horses coarser and prone to lower leg defaults . The Clydesdale was instrumental in the creation of the Gypsy <unk> horse , developed in Great Britain . The Clydesdale , along with other draught breeds , was also used to create the Australian Draught Horse . In the early 20th century , they were often crossed with Dales ponies , creating mid @-@ sized draught horses useful for pulling commercial wagons and military artillery . 
 = Fort Jackson ( Virginia ) = 
 Fort Jackson was an American Civil War @-@ era fortification in Virginia that defended the southern end of the Long Bridge , near Washington , D.C. Long Bridge connected Washington , D.C. to Northern Virginia and served as a vital transportation artery for the Union Army during the war . Fort Jackson was named for Jackson City , a seedy suburb of Washington that had been established on the south side of the Long Bridge in 1835 . It was built in the days immediately following the Union Army 's occupation of Northern Virginia in May 1861 . The fort was initially armed with four cannon used to protect the bridge , but these were removed after the completion of the Arlington Line , a line of defenses built to the south . After 1862 , the fort lacked weapons except for small arms and consisted of a wooden palisade backed by earthworks . Two cannon were restored to the fort in 1864 following the Battle of Fort Stevens . The garrison consisted of a single company of Union soldiers who inspected traffic crossing the bridge and guarded it from potential saboteurs . 
 Following the final surrender of the Confederate States of America in 1865 , Fort Jackson was abandoned . The lumber used in its construction was promptly salvaged for firewood and construction materials and , due to its proximity to the Long Bridge , the earthworks were flattened in order to provide easier access to Long Bridge . In the early 20th century , the fort 's site was used for the footings and approaches to several bridges connecting Virginia and Washington . Today , no trace of the fort remains , though the site of the fort is contained within Arlington County 's Long Bridge Park , and a National Park Service 2004 survey of the site indicated some archaeological remnants may still remain beneath the park . 
 = = Occupation of Arlington = = 
 Before the outbreak of the Civil War , Alexandria County ( renamed Arlington County in 1920 ) , the county in Virginia closest to Washington , D.C. , was a predominantly rural area . Part of the original ten @-@ mile @-@ square District of Columbia , the land now comprising the county was retroceded to Virginia in a July 9 , 1846 , act of Congress that took effect in 1847 . Most of the county is hilly , and at the time , most of the county 's population was concentrated in the city of Alexandria , at the far southeastern corner of the county . In 1861 , the rest of the county largely consisted of scattered farms , the occasional house , fields for grazing livestock , and Arlington House , owned by Mary Custis , wife of Robert E. Lee . The county was connected to nearby Washington via the Long Bridge , which spanned the Potomac River . On the river flats of the Virginia side of the river was Jackson City , a seedy entertainment district named after President Andrew Jackson and home to several racetracks , gambling halls , and saloons . 
 Following the surrender of Fort Sumter in Charleston , South Carolina , on April 14 , 1861 , President Abraham Lincoln declared that " an insurrection existed " , and called for 75 @,@ 000 troops to be called up to quash the rebellion . The move sparked resentment in many other southern states , which promptly moved to convene discussions of secession . The Virginia State Convention passed " an ordinance of secession " and ordered a May 23 referendum to decide whether or not the state should secede from the Union . The U.S. Army responded by creating the Department of Washington , which united all Union troops in the District of Columbia and Maryland under one command . 
 Brigadier General J.F.K. Mansfield , commander of the Department of Washington , argued that Northern Virginia should be occupied as soon as possible in order to prevent the possibility of the Confederate Army mounting artillery on the hills of Arlington and shelling government buildings in Washington . He also urged the erection of fortifications on the Virginia side of the Potomac River to protect the southern terminuses of the Chain Bridge , Long Bridge , and Aqueduct Bridge . His superiors approved these recommendations , but decided to wait until after Virginia voted for or against secession . 
 On May 23 , 1861 , Virginia voted by a margin of 3 to 1 in favor of leaving the Union . That night , U.S. Army troops began crossing the bridges linking Washington , D.C. to Virginia . The march , which began at 10 p.m. on the night of the 23rd , was described in colorful terms by the New York Herald two days later : 
 There can be no more complaints of inactivity of the government . The forward march movement into Virginia , indicated in my despatches last night , took place at the precise time this morning that I named , but in much more imposing and powerful numbers . 
 About ten o 'clock last night four companies of picked men moved over the Long Bridge , as an advance guard . They were sent to reconnoitre , and if assailed were ordered to signal , when they would have been reinforced by a corps of regular infantry and a battery .... 
 At twelve o 'clock the infantry regiment , artillery and cavalry corps began to muster and assume marching order . As fast as the several regiments were ready they proceeded to the Long Bridge , those in Washington being directed to take that route . 
 The troops quartered at Georgetown , the Sixty @-@ ninth , Fifth , Eighth and Twenty @-@ eighth New York regiments , proceeded across what is known as the chain bridge , above the mouth of the Potomac Aqueduct , under the command of General McDowell . They took possession of the heights in that direction . 
 The imposing scene was at the Long Bridge , where the main body of the troops crossed . Eight thousand infantry , two regular cavalry companies and two sections of Sherman 's artillery battalion , consisting of two batteries , were in line this side of the Long Bridge at two o 'clock . 
 The occupation of Northern Virginia was peaceful , with the exception of the town of Alexandria . There , as Colonel Elmer E. Ellsworth , commander of the New York Fire Zouaves ( 11th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment ) , entered a local hotel to remove the Confederate flag flying above it , he was shot and killed by James Jackson , the proprietor . Ellsworth was one of the first men killed in the American Civil War .

 Over 13 @,@ 000 men marched into northern Virginia on May 25 , bringing with them " a long train of wagons filled with wheelbarrows , shovels , & c . " These implements were put to work even as thousands of men marched further into Virginia . Engineer officers under the command of then @-@ Colonel John G. Barnard accompanied the army and began building fortifications and entrenchments along the banks of the Potomac River in order to defend the bridges that crossed it . By sunrise on the morning of the 24th , ground had already been broken on the first two forts comprising the Civil War defenses of Washington — Fort Runyon and Fort Corcoran . Within a week , other , smaller forts had sprung up as supporting works . Fort Jackson , built to the northeast of Fort Runyon , and armed with four cannon , was one of these . 
 Owing to its large physical size and extensive armament , Fort Runyon was intended to be the primary fort defending the Long Bridge . Fort Jackson , located at the southern end of the bridge , received four cannon and was intended as a guard post for soldiers inspecting civilian traffic crossing the bridge and to detour any Confederate saboteurs that might attempt to destroy the bridge . To man the fort 's four guns , 60 artillerymen were assigned , bringing the total garrison to 200 men . 
 = = Wartime use = = 
 On July 14 , 1861 , Company E of the 21st New York Volunteer Infantry was assigned to garrison Fort Jackson . On August 31 , the 21st New York was ordered to Fort Cass , Virginia , and was later involved in the Second Battle of Bull Run . No information exists on the unit that replaced it in garrisoning Fort Jackson . 
 Following the completion of the Arlington Line , which was built several miles to the southwest of Fort Jackson , atop the heights of Arlington , the maintenance of Forts Jackson and Runyon was neglected . The two forts had largely been made redundant by the newer , stronger works atop the hills , and it was believed that neither played a crucial role any longer in the defenses of Washington . Fort Jackson was kept in service only as an inspection station for traffic crossing Long Bridge . 
 = = = Railroad and rebuilding = = = 
 In 1863 , a new railroad bridge was constructed adjacent to the Long Bridge as part of a plan to strengthen the logistics of the Army of the Potomac as it operated in northern Virginia . An extension of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad , the bridge would be used until the turn of the century before being replaced . Owing to the weight of the railroad and the weak strength of the bridge , no locomotives were allowed on the bridge . Prior to crossing the Potomac , the train would detach its locomotive and be pulled across the bridge by a team of horses . 
 In order to provide space for the railroad tracks , the gates of Fort Jackson had to be removed . These were eventually replaced , but the wide opening needed for the tracks proved to have a detrimental effect on the fort 's defensive ability . An 1864 report by Lt. Col. Barton S. Alexander , the aide de camp to Gen. John Gross Barnard , chief engineer of the defenses of Washington , described the way Fort Jackson had been allowed to fall into disrepair : 
 The defense of the bridge is very imperfect , owing to the dilapidation and decay of Fort Jackson . The railroad cuts through the parapet and there are no gates except at turnpike entrance . The railroad crosses the ditch of the fort on a bridge which is not floored , but an enemy could soon cover it so as to make it passable . Cavalry could also ride around to the lower side of the fort and come in on the bridge . 
 To fix the problems at Fort Jackson , Alexander recommended the addition of an artillery section , a second company of infantry , and various improvements to the fort itself . Spurred in part by the Confederate attack on Fort Stevens north of Washington , several improvements were made , including the restoration of gates that had been removed when the railroad line was constructed . Gen. Christopher Columbus Augur , commander of the Department of Washington , recommended that Fort Jackson be assigned two light guns as armament during the reconstruction . 
 = = Post @-@ war use = = 
 After the surrender of General Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia on April 9 , 1865 , the primary reason for manned defenses protecting Washington ceased to exist . Initial recommendations by Colonel Barton S. Alexander , then @-@ chief engineer of the Washington defenses , were to divide the defenses into three classes : those that should be kept active ( first @-@ class ) , those that should be mothballed and kept in a reserve state ( second @-@ class ) , and those that should be abandoned entirely ( third @-@ class ) . Due to its rear @-@ area nature and the fact that inspections were no longer needed to protect the Long Bridge against sabotage , Fort Jackson fell into the third @-@ class category . 
 The lumber used in the construction of Fort Jackson was either sold for salvage or scavenged by squatters , most of whom were freed slaves traveling north in a search for new lives following the ending of slavery in the United States . Many settled in the area of the former Fort Runyon , and it seems likely that the lumber of Fort Jackson would have been a ready source of firewood . 
 All the forts around or overlooking the city are dismantled , the guns taken out of them , the land resigned to its owners . Needy negro squatters , living around the forts , have built themselves shanties of the officers ' quarters , pulled out the abatis for firewood , made cord wood or joists out of the log platforms for the guns , and sawed up the great flag @-@ staffs into quilting poles or bedstead posts ... The strolls out to these old forts are <unk> picturesque . Freedmen , who exist by selling old horse @-@ shoes and iron spikes , live with their squatter families where , of old , the army sutler kept the canteen ; but the grass is drawing its parallels nearer and nearer the magazines . Some old clothes , a good deal of dirt , and forgotten graves , make now the local features of war . " 
 By the turn of the century , the site of Fort Jackson had become the footings for a new railroad bridge , constructed in 1903 . Three years later , a road bridge was constructed just to the west . A brickworks was also located nearby , sometimes utilizing the clay that formed the bastions of Fort Runyon as raw material for the bricks that would later go into the walls of Washington homes . These projects obliterated what little trace there was of Fort Jackson . 
 Today , a CSX Corporation railroad bridge runs through the site of Fort Jackson , and the Potomac shoreline just south of the bridge is being studied by the National Park Service as one possible site for an Arlington County boathouse . Just south of the federal George Washington Memorial Parkway , between the CSX tracks and I @-@ 395 , is Arlington County 's Long Bridge Park . The northern end of the park , not yet developed for recreational use , may include part of the site of Fort Jackson . A National Park Service study commissioned during the ongoing review of potential boathouse sites included an observation that historical artifacts from Fort Jackson may still be present at the site .

 " Roadrunners " is the fourth episode of the eighth season and the 165th episode overall of the science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . " Roadrunners " is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . The episode first aired in the United States on November 26 , 2000 on Fox and on March 1 , 2001 on Sky1 in the United Kingdom and Ireland . It was written by Vince Gilligan and directed by Rod Hardy . The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 8 @.@ 3 and was watched by 13 @.@ 6 million households . The episode received mixed to positive reviews from television critics . 
 The series centers on FBI special agents Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) and her new partner John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) — following the alien abduction of her former partner , Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) — who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . In this episode , Scully , working alone , pursues a cult that worship a slug @-@ like organism and believe it to be the Second Coming of Jesus Christ ; but in her efforts to save an injured stranger , she discovers she is in over her head . 
 The episode was written by Gilligan to be intentionally " creepy " . Furthermore , Gilligan wanted to show the audience that John Doggett was a good person and an ally of Scully 's . The parasitic creature that was used in the episode was designed to look like a banana slug and was created via animatronics . Several of the scenes were so gruesome that producer Paul Rabwin later noted that some of the cameramen " start [ ed ] to lose it " during filming .

Mr. Milsap offers Scully a room at the local boarding house , but Scully tries the rest of the town only to be ignored by everyone ; they are all too engrossed in Bible study groups . Disturbed by the turn of events , she keeps her gun close at hand . The next morning , Mr. Milsap tells Scully that there is a man who needs help downstairs . She goes with him and finds the hitchhiker from the teaser having a seizure . She advises them to take him to the hospital , but they pretend that they do not have any cars . While examining the man , Scully discovers a strange circular wound on his back . Meanwhile , Doggett calls the local sheriff and learns that Scully has not arrived yet , and so he sets out to find her . 
 The sick man begins to recover and Scully talks to him while the townspeople are gone . He does not seem to know who he is or how he arrived . She inspects his wound again and finds a lump moving along the man 's spine ; digging into the open wound , she pulls out a piece of a large worm . Scully talks with the hitchhiker , whose name is revealed to be Hank , about the creature and thinks she cannot get it out without killing him . Scully goes to find a car but , moments after leaving , Hank immediately tells the townspeople what she is up to and that " another swap " is needed . Concurrently , Doggett arrives in Utah and informs the Sheriff about a series X @-@ Files involving similar back wound and death by stoning . 
 Scully is eventually captured by the townspeople and the worm is inserted into her body . Eventually , Doggett finds Scully , cuts the worm out of her , and shoots the creature dead . Later , Scully is packing her things in the hospital when Doggett comes in to inform her about the trial of the cult members ; they are offering little defense except that they claim that they are being persecuted for their religious beliefs . Scully muses that they thought the worm was the Second Coming of Jesus Christ . She apologizes to Doggett for going out on the mission alone and promises to never do it again .

 " Roadrunners " was written by Vince Gilligan and was inspired by the 1955 thriller film Bad Day at Black Rock . The script , called " uncharacteristically brutal " for Gilligan — who had been noted for his comedic episodes like " Bad Blood " and " X @-@ Cops " — was written with the expressed intent to make , according to Gilligan , " a really all @-@ out scary , creepy , get under @-@ your @-@ skin — literally and figuratively — X @-@ File . " Furthermore , the episode was written to show the audience of The X @-@ Files that John Doggett was on the side of the heroes . Gilligan explained , " I wanted this gangbusters episode , one that showed Doggett was a good guy ; someone to be counted on . " Many fans were unhappy with Doggett 's condescension towards Scully during her apology . Robert Patrick , the actor who portrayed Doggett , however , had a different interpretation : " The whole essence of the scene was , ' Look , I 'm here for you . I 've got your back . We 're partners now . ' And you give that the weight of a marine saying to someone , ' I 'll jump on a grenade for you , so you can trust me . ' The idea was to really assure the fans that the show was continuing on . " 
 Several of the characters in the episode were named after real @-@ life individuals . The character of Hank was named after the brother of Vince Gilligan 's girlfriend , Holly . Mr. Milsap was named for famed singer @-@ songwriter Ronnie Milsap . Finally , Sheriff <unk> was named after Gilligan 's mortgage broker . 
 = = = Directing = = = 
 The episode was directed by Rod Hardy , making it his first credit for the series . Hardy was offered the role after an unknown individual working at The X @-@ Files saw his TBS remake of the film High Noon . The parasitic creature that was used in the episode was created via animatronics and was designed to look like a banana slug . During the scene where the creature is inserted into Scully 's back , the production crew created a false fiberglass back for Gillian Anderson . To create the illusion that the creature was crawling up the body , the fiberglass was pressed against . Anderson later described the scene as " fun to shoot . " However , she did notice that the scene " was exhausting , though , struggling on that bed for so long . Not <unk> , but tied down , my arms to the headboard and my legs to the <unk> . Paul Rabwin later noted that he had several cameramen " start to lose it " during the scene .

 = = = Reviews = = = 
 " Roadrunners " received mixed to positive reviews from critics . Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson named the episode the " finest stand @-@ alone episode " of the show 's eighth season . Harrisson praised the character development in " Roadrunners " and noted that the episode " effectively brings [ Scully and Doggett ] together as partners . " Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode four stars out of five . The two note that , " for the first half @-@ hour , this works as a slow burn horror story ... It 's the transition of Gillian Anderson 's performance from wry exasperation to outright paranoia ... which makes this so effective . " Shearman and Pearson did , however , slightly criticize the cutting of John Doggett 's role to a minimum . Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a " A – " and wrote that it " is an episode that ’ s dedicated to helping us move past the Mulder era . " He praised the creepiness of Gilligan 's script , as well as the characterization of Scully , writing that even though she is in a situation that is over her head , she is still smart in her attempts to escape ; he also praised Anderson 's acting . However , VanDerWerff was more critical of the final scene , noting that it made Doggett come across as " kind of an asshole " . Paul Spragg of Xposé wrote positively of the episode , saying it features a " return to the body horror stories that had worked so well in the early seasons " . Spragg added that " Roadrunners " is " certainly close " to the highly acclaimed first season episode " Ice " . 
 Not all reviews were positive . George Avalos and Michael Liedtke of the Knight Ridder Tribune wrote that the episode 's slug " continued the series ' fine tradition of monsters that made us queasy as we squirmed in our seats " . Despite enjoying the gore and the reality of Scully 's isolation , the two were critical of the cult 's motivations , writing that " we were given absolutely no clue as to why the Utah cult members believed the slug represented the Second Coming of Jesus Christ . " The two ultimately concluded that " Roadrunners " fell " well short of a classic . " Sarah Stegall highly criticized the episode , calling it " a bad mix of The Fly and The Kindred , with plenty of X @-@ Files classic paranoia but none of the finesse we 've seen before . " Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a scathing review and awarded it no stars out of four . She heavily derided the plot , sarcastically referring to Doggett as a " man 's man " and the parasite a " phallic @-@ shaped giant slug " . Furthermore , she criticized Scully 's actions to go off on an assignment without telling her partner . Dave Golder from SFX criticized the episode and called it a retread of the first season episode " Ice " .

 = Christian Ramsay = 
 Christian Ramsay , Countess of Dalhousie informally Lady Dalhousie , née Broun ; 28 February 1786 – 22 January 1839 was a Scottish botanist and natural historian . She married the 9th Earl of Dalhousie and travelled with him when he was appointed Governor General of Canada and India . While travelling , she collected and catalogued many species of plants , presented scientific papers to societies and donated multiple collections to different botanical groups . 
 Lady Dalhousie was made an honorary member of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh and was its only female honorary member until her death . A genus of tropical plant , <unk> , was named after her . 
 = = Family = = 
 Lady Dalhousie was born Christian Broun on 28 February 1786 at Coalstoun , the ancestral home of the Broun family near Haddington , East Lothian . She was the only child of Charles and Christian Broun . The Broun family had a history in the legal profession ; her father was an advocate and his father a judge , George Broun , Lord Coalstoun . On 14 May 1805 , she married the 9th Earl of Dalhousie and was styled Countess of Dalhousie . 
 Lady Dalhousie and her husband had three sons . Their eldest , George , was born 3 August 1806 , a captain in the 26th ( <unk> ) Regiment of Foot , he died on 25 October 1832 . Their second son , Charles , died at nine years old . Their youngest , James , born 22 April 1812 , inherited his father 's title in 1838 and was created Marquess of Dalhousie in 1849 . 
 = = Scientific work = = 
 Lady Dalhousie was a keen botanist ; she catalogued plants on herbarium sheets , fully identified and complete with collection dates , notes on habitats and some with watercolour pictures she had painted . In 1824 , Lord Dalhousie co @-@ founded the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec . Lady Dalhousie 's catalogue of Canadian plants was included in the first issue of the society 's Transactions in 1829 . Lady Dalhousie presented a paper to them and donated her collection of Nova Scotian specimens as part of a herbarium in 1824 . 
 Lady Dalhousie donated her entire East Indian Herbarium to the Botanical Society of Edinburgh . The society noted its quality and made Lady Dalhousie an honorary member in 1837 ; at the time of her death she was the only female honorary member . Records of correspondence with Kew botanist , Sir William Hooker , include large collections of plants from Simla and Penang in 1831 . Her collections were included when Joseph Dalton Hooker compiled his Flora Indica . 
 = = Travels = = 
 When her husband was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia , she travelled with him and their three sons to Canada on the frigate HMS Forth . The family lived in Halifax , Nova Scotia for four years from 1816 to 1820 . Whilst there , Lady Dalhousie spent her time in the promotion of science . She toured the countryside with her husband , recommended improvements to farming and collected botanical items . She sent seeds to Dalhousie Castle for the gardens . 
 In 1820 , the family moved to Quebec , when her husband was appointed Governor General of British North America . Lady Dalhousie took on the traditional role of a governor 's wife , that of " Patron of literature and the arts " . She spent much time in high society and was known for her wit and satirical caricatures of society members . Once established , Lady Dalhousie and her friends started focusing on natural history and in particular cataloguing local botany . 
 In 1824 , the family returned to Dalhousie Castle and began plans for an extensive garden . Their gardener , Joseph Archibald , wrote of her that " few ... attained such proficiency as her <unk> in the science " . Plans for the garden were cut short as the family suffered severe financial losses when their agent went bankrupt . Although the garden was not completed , many of the North American plants had been planted and flowered for the first time in Great Britain . The family moved to a modest farm house in Sorel in 1826 and remained there until Lord Dalhousie was appointed Governor General and Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of India in 1829 . 
 On the journey to India , the family stopped at Madeira , St. Helena and the Cape of Good Hope . At each place , Lady Dalhousie took time to collect plants and made a detailed catalogue of them . In 1831 she visited the foothills of Simla , along with Penang , near the Malay Peninsula . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Lady Dalhousie died suddenly on 22 January 1839 in the home of Dean Ramsay aged 52 . One report mentions that she was so dedicated to her studies that she died with a list of plants in her hand . The collection that she and her husband had made was sold in 1985 ; parts went to the Nova Scotia Museum , the National Gallery of Canada , the Library and Archives Canada and the Provincial Archives of New Brunswick . 
 For her work in the classification of Indian botany , Robert Graham named a genus of Fabaceae , a flowering plant native to India , after her – <unk> . One of the plants she sent to Graham was a new discovery , so he named the plant Asplenium <unk> after her . Sir William Hooker dedicated a volume of Curtis 's Botanical Magazine to her . Julia Catherine Beckwith , who is credited as Canada 's first writer of fiction , dedicated her first novel to her . Lady Dalhousie was the first owner of one of the " <unk> " copies of Jane Austen 's Emma .

 Teresa Hsu Chih ( 7 July 1898 – 7 December 2011 ) , or commonly known as Teresa Hsu ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> Zhe ) was a Chinese @-@ born Singaporean social worker , known affectionately as " Singapore 's Mother Teresa " , in recognition for her active lifelong devotion in helping the aged sick and <unk> locally . The retired nurse was the founder of the non @-@ profit charities — Heart to Heart Service and the Home for the Aged Sick , one of the first homes for the aged sick in Singapore . She had been a social worker in China and Paraguay and a nurse in England , before coming to Singapore to start similar non @-@ profit charities since 1961 . As a supercentenarian , Hsu was still involved in charity work and was one of very few <unk> who were recognised for reasons other than their longevity . She had spent almost all her savings on feeding and housing the poor and the elderly , all of whom are younger than she was , but she herself led a simple and humble lifestyle . In 2005 , she received the Special Recognition Award from the Singapore government in recognition of her contribution to the country . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Hsu was reportedly born on 7 July 1898 , in Shantou prefecture of China , during the reign of the Manchu Qing Dynasty , although this has never been independently verified . When Hsu was young , her father walked out on the family for another woman . Her mother , who was illiterate , had to fend for the three girls and one brother singlehandedly . At 16 , her family moved to Penang in Malaya , where they worked as cleaners in a convent . As she did not want to be a cleaner all her life , Hsu asked the nuns there to allow her to study with the children , and they agreed . Combining study with work , she passed her Senior Cambridge examinations four years later . Equipped with a basic education , she ventured to Hongkong to work and , later , to Chongqing , China , where she became a secretary and bookkeeper at a German news agency in the 1930s . She quit her job to become a volunteer , helping the injured during the Sino @-@ Japanese War . 
 Recalling her inability to help the wounded people whom she saw during the Second World War , Hsu decided to become a nurse . As she was overaged at 47 , she wrote a request to the chief matron of the Nursing Council in London . Touched by Hsu 's sincerity and dedication , her application was accepted . She spent eight years in England doing nursing and another eight in Paraguay as a member of the German charity group <unk> , to start hospitals and homes for the aged there . In her mid @-@ 50s , she decided to return home to Penang to be with her mother . In Malaysia , she assisted her brother in starting the <unk> Foundation for the Poor in Ipoh . She also played a key role in the startup of three homes for the elderly and two homes for young girls and neglected children in Ipoh . 
 = = Home for the Aged Sick = = 
 In 1961 , she came to Singapore to live with her older sister , Ursula , late principal of the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus in Bukit Timah . On seeing her dedication and commitment in helping the poor and sick , Ursula bought her a 0 @.@ 6 @-@ hectare piece of land at Jalan Payoh Lai in 1965 , so that Hsu could open the first home for the aged sick in Singapore . The two sisters ran the Home for the Aged Sick for five years . Ursula financed its operations with her pay , while Hsu managed it and made some extra cash by selling the harvest of 10 coconut trees and a dozen banana trees in the backyard . 
 The sisters converted a servants ' quarters and a bungalow into wards for their patients , but it became increasingly difficult to cope with the numbers . In 1970 , with about 100 patients , they approached the Rotary Club for funds . The Rotary Club agreed to finance the home on condition that the club take over the running of it . The sisters handed the deeds over to the Society for the Aged Sick , an association formed by the Rotary Club members . The society built three blocks to house the increasing number of residents and Hsu remained the home 's matron until 1980 , when she was asked to retire at 83 . Hsu moved into a three @-@ room apartment on the rooftop of the Home , built by the society . After her sister died , she left Hsu a sum of money which she was able to buy flats with — five in Singapore and two in Malaysia for those people who had no money and who were asked to move . When asked where all her compassion and deep caring came from , Hsu replied : 
 I must have got it from my mother because she was totally dedicated to the job she chose to do and that was looking after the family . I think that trait was passed down to us . I 've no family , so I look after everybody else . I choose to serve everybody else who comes to me — that is my job ... The world is my home , all living beings are my family , selfless service is my religion . 
 = = Heart to Heart Service = = 
 Shortly after she retired , Hsu set up the Heart to Heart Service with Sharana Yao , her co @-@ social worker , a non @-@ profit , non @-@ government aided welfare service which provides food , clothes and monthly cash contributions to those in need . With the help of volunteers who drive her around , she brought necessities to the homes of elderly women and <unk> in their 80s and 90s on public assistance , such as rice , sugar , biscuits , beverages and monthly cash allowances of between S $ 20 and S $ 180 . She got her rations and funds from various sources — merchants , people in the neighbourhood , church friends , and their friends . The needy get on Heart @-@ to @-@ Heart 's list based on good faith by word of mouth . In 2000 , a Straits Times reader wrote to comment on her selfless contributions to the society and urged the young to follow her example : 
 As we admire the grit , good humour and faith that Ms Hsu has , might we also ponder over a certain dilemma : Where are the Teresa <unk> of today ? Ms Hsu is at an age where most would have long retired , but she takes it upon herself to be of service to others , to those who are less fortunate than her . A society like Singapore requires a lot more individuals like this and we need them now ... We need to have more youths as volunteers or pursuing a career in social work as they will be the core of our society ... More publicity and attention must be drawn to volunteer opportunities and more must be done to recognise dedicated people like Ms Hsu . We cannot continue in our efforts of building a gracious society without strengthening volunteerism as a culture . There is little to be gained by being more cultured if we do not take the plight of the less fortunate into consideration . 
 = = Lifestyle = = 
 Hsu was still actively involved in charity work after turning 110 . An advocate of healthy living , Hsu often gave public talks at schools , welfare homes , and hospitals in Singapore and overseas about health and service to the needy . When asked about the secret of her good health and longevity , Hsu attributed her good health to a spartan lifestyle , vegetarian diet , and to her positive attitude towards life . 
 I prefer to laugh than to weep . Those people who cry to me , I always tell them it is better to laugh than to use tissue paper , as laughing is free but tissue paper still cost five @-@ cent . ' Ha ha ha ' cost no cents . 
 I saw fishes swimming happily in the water , and I ’ ve no rights to take their life to fill my stomach . When I was small , my parents said that fish was good to me . But they are already not around and I ’ m still here . 
 She would start her day at 4 am with calisthenics , meditation and an hour of yoga exercises . At night , she would do yoga again , then read until midnight . She picked up yoga at age 69 , when she bought a book titled Forever Young , Forever Healthy . She also taught yoga to the young and old at temples , associations , hospitals and schools . She ate <unk> ; her breakfast was a glass of water or milk . Lunch was often milk and salad , unless " people bring me food " , and it was milk or yogurt for dinner . At home , she had a 2 @,@ 000 @-@ volume private library she called Prema , which in Sanskrit means " divine love " . Her final days were kept busy with trips to help needy senior citizens , reading and yoga practice at her sparsely @-@ furnished single @-@ storey house attached to the Society for the Aged Sick . 
 = = Death = = 
 Hsu died on Wednesday , 7 December 2011 , peacefully at home and was cremated on the same day without any rites , as instructed by her . She was probably the oldest living person in Singapore at the time of her death although the case of 114 years old <unk> Noor Abbe appeared soon after the passing of Hsu .

 = October 2008 Central America floods = 
 The October 2008 Central America floods were caused by a series of low pressure areas including Tropical Depression Sixteen , a short @-@ lived tropical cyclone in the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season that made landfall in Honduras . Heavy rainfall began in early October 2008 while a tropical wave passed through the region . On October 14 , Tropical Depression Sixteen formed just off the northeast coast of Honduras , and at the same time a low pressure system was on the Pacific coast . Both systems increased rainfall across the region , although the depression dropped heavy rainfall close to its center when it moved ashore on October 15 . Although Tropical Depression Sixteen quickly dissipated over land , its remnants persisted for several days . Another low pressure area interacted with a cold front on October 21 , adding to the rainfall in the region . 
 Heavy rainfall extended from Costa Rica to southeastern Mexico , causing what was considered the worst natural disaster in the region since Hurricane Mitch in 1998 . In the former country , rainfall totaled 2 @,@ 100 mm ( 83 in ) over several weeks , making the week ending October 17 the wettest in San José since 1944 . Floods in Costa Rica damaged 32 bridges and roads in 174 locations , while 1 @,@ 396 homes were damaged , killing seven people . In Nicaragua to the north , weeks of heavy rainfall killed 16 people and damaged or destroyed 1 @,@ 333 houses . In Honduras where the tropical depression made landfall , rainfall reached 1 @.@ 2 m ( 4 ft ) in some areas , although the highest official total there related to the depression was 360 mm ( 14 @.@ 19 in ) on the offshore Roatán over six days . About 40 % of municipalities in the country experienced flooding , forcing over 50 @,@ 000 people to leave their homes . The floods damaged about 50 % of roads in Honduras , and over 10 @,@ 000 houses were damaged or destroyed . Damage totaled about 3 billion <unk> ( HNL , $ 225 million USD ) , and there were 60 deaths . 
 In northern Guatemala , the floods damaged about 67 @,@ 000 ha ( 170 @,@ 000 acres ) of crop fields , accounting for <unk> million ( 2008 <unk> , $ 16 @.@ 8 million USD ) in crop damage . There were 17 deaths and about 4 @,@ 000 damaged houses in Guatemala . In neighboring El Salvador , the rains contributed to October 2008 being the third wettest month across the country , after Hurricane Stan in 2005 and Hurricane Mitch in 1998 . One person died , and hundreds were forced to evacuate their houses . In Belize , the rains flooded about 1 @,@ 000 homes , forcing the evacuation of one entire town due to health reasons . The rains caused additional flooding following Tropical Storm Arthur striking the country in May , damaging a bridge that was rebuilt after Arthur . Nationwide , the floods caused BZ $ 54 @.@ 1 million ( BZD , $ 27 @.@ 1 million USD ) in damage and two deaths . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Widespread rainfall occurred throughout Central America in early October 2008 due to the passage of a tropical wave through the region . Later , another tropical wave approached the region , which was believed to have left the west coast of Africa on September 17 . The wave developed a low pressure area on October 10 in the southwestern Caribbean , with sporadic convection . On October 13 , the system consisted of a large area of convection drifting northward offshore eastern Central America , and Dvorak classifications began , indicating gradual organization . At that time , there was another low pressure area on the Pacific coast , and both systems were producing rainfall across Central America . 
 At 1200 UTC on October 14 , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) indicated that Tropical Depression Sixteen developed about 85 km ( 50 mi ) northeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios , a point where the border of Nicaragua and Honduras meet the Caribbean . In the hours after the depression 's formation , the convection decreased , and Hurricane Hunters indicated that the small low @-@ level circulation was rotating around a broader circulation . Shortly after 1200 UTC on October 15 , the weak tropical depression made landfall just west of Punta <unk> in northern Honduras , with a broad and ill @-@ defined circulation . Continuing west @-@ southwestward over land , the circulation dissipated on October 16 over the mountains of central Honduras , although the depression 's remnants continued to produce rainfall across the region for several days . On October 21 , a cold front was moving through the Yucatán peninsula , interacting with a newly formed low in the Gulf of Honduras to produce additional rainfall . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Around the time when the NHC began issuing advisories on the depression , officials issued a tropical storm warning for northern Honduras that eventually covered the country 's entire coastline . A tropical storm warning was also issued for the coast of Belize . When the NHC began issuing advisories on the depression , the agency anticipated the depression would intensify into a strong tropical storm , based on low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures ; however , the agency noted uncertainty in the track . A ridge to the north was expected to steer the nascent depression westward , and two tropical cyclone forecast models predicted the storm would continue west @-@ northwestward to strike Belize . Other models forecast a more immediate landfall , which would limit intensification . While the storm was active , officials in Honduras issued a yellow alert for seven departments where heavy rainfall had occurred . A nationwide yellow alert was also issued for El Salvador , meaning there was potential for flooding and landslides , although alerts were dropped on October 21 when the threat of rainfall diminished . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Although a weak tropical cyclone , the depression and its remnants dropped heavy rainfall across Central America for several days , spreading into Nicaragua , Honduras , Guatemala , and Belize . In Honduras where it made landfall , rainfall peaked at 360 mm ( 14 @.@ 19 in ) on the offshore Roatán over six days . A member from Mercy Corps estimated the rainfall in October to have totaled around 1 @.@ 2 m ( 4 ft ) in some areas . On the mainland , rainfall reached 266 mm ( 10 @.@ 47 in ) at El Empalme . In El Salvador , the depression dropped heavy rainfall , mainly in the southern coastal portion , with a 24 ‑ hour peak of 239 mm ( 9 @.@ 40 in ) in Puerto Parada en La Unión . Over a period of eight days , rainfall in Belize reached 547 mm ( 21 @.@ 52 in ) at Baldy Beacon . Rainfall extended as far north as southeastern Mexico . Throughout the region , the flooding destroyed about 10 @,@ 000 homes and left about 250 @,@ 000 people homeless . News agencies considered the flooding the worst in the region since Hurricane Mitch in 1998 . 
 According to Costa Rica 's National Meteorology Institute , the week ending on October 17 was the wettest in San José since 1944 . Over a period of several weeks , rainfall reached about 2 @,@ 100 mm ( 83 in ) . The influence between the precursor to the depression and a low pressure area in the eastern Pacific caused flooding in Costa Rica that killed seven people . In Guanacaste Province , a landslide covered three cars , and in Monteverde , another landslide knocked over a power line that killed two people . In <unk> , an ambulance carrying four people was struck by a fallen tree , while in <unk> , another vehicle was struck by a tree , killing one of its occupants . Transport was disrupted in widespread areas in the north and south of the country due to landslides blocking roads . Across the country , the floods compromised roads in 174 locations and damaged 32 bridges . Flooding isolated about 6 @,@ 900 people in 75 communities , and about 77 @,@ 000 people were forced to leave their homes . Power outages affected 89 communities , and 424 water wells along the Pacific coast were polluted . Nationwide , the floods damaged 1 @,@ 396 houses and 39 schools . 
 In early October , heavy rainfall began affecting Nicaragua , causing mudslides and flooding . The tropical depression added to weeks of heavy rainfall that killed 16 people , many caused by people attempting to cross swollen rivers . Toward the end of October 2008 , Lake Managua overflowed , causing flooding in the capital city of Managua . Across the country , 2 @,@ 273 people evacuated to storm shelters after the floods damaged or destroyed 1 @,@ 333 houses . Transportation was disrupted when the floods wrecked four bridges and 154 mi ( 248 km ) of highways . Classes were canceled in León and Chinandega departments . The crops in the latter department were almost entirely destroyed . 
 Following months of drought conditions , the heavy rainfall in Honduras caused flooding , initially in the southern and central portions , although the entire country experienced rainfall , with 40 % of municipalities experiencing flooding . The rains caused widespread landslides , particularly in the western and central portions . In the capital city Tegucigalpa , the rainfall in October was estimated to have been twice the average annual total . In two locations , the Pan @-@ American Highway was disrupted by either landslide or flooding , and widespread areas were isolated nationwide by flooded roads . According to Reuters , about 50 % of the roads in Honduras were damaged during the floods , with 227 roads and 106 bridges damaged . A landslide near <unk> blocked a river and created a natural dam , forcing hundreds of nearby residents to leave . In Colón Department , the <unk> River overflowed , while flooding in Atlántida damaged crop lands . A total of 101 @,@ 107 ha ( 249 @,@ 840 acres ) of crops were damaged , mostly in Comayagua Department . 14 water systems were damaged , and 150 @,@ 000 people lost power in Olancho Department . Landslides in Tegucigalpa killed six and displaced about 500 people . In El Progreso , 375 inmates from a jail had to be evacuated to another facility . A total of 50 @,@ 676 people were forced to evacuate in the country , most of whom stayed in shelters . 2 @,@ 474 homes were destroyed in Honduras , with another 8 @,@ 688 damaged or flooded . In addition , at least nine schools were damaged or destroyed . Nationwide , the floods killed 60 people , and damage was estimated at about 3 billion <unk> ( HNL , $ 225 million USD ) . The low death toll compared to Hurricane Mitch was largely due to the widespread evacuations . 
 Floods in Guatemala overflowed rivers and caused landslides in Izabal and Petén departments , blocking many roads . The rising rivers damaged about 175 houses , forcing hundreds of people to leave their homes . About 67 @,@ 000 ha ( 170 @,@ 000 acres ) of crop fields were damaged or destroyed , including corn , rice , and beans , and crop damage nationwide was estimated at <unk> million ( 2008 <unk> , $ 16 @.@ 8 million USD ) . About 2 @.@ 5 % of the national corn crop and 3 @.@ 7 % of the rice crop were wrecked during the floods . Nationwide , about 4 @,@ 000 houses and 82 roads were damaged or destroyed , and 17 people died in the country from the floods . In neighboring El Salvador , floods affected the houses of about 600 families . High levels forced officials to release water from several dams , causing urban flooding . Along the coastline , the floods damaged maize and bean crops . The average rainfall across El Salvador for the month of October was 475 mm ( 14 @.@ 76 in ) . This was the third highest for October since such record keeping began in 1971 , after 2005 when Hurricane Stan struck and 1998 when Hurricane Mitch crossed the area . The tropical depression killed one person in the country . 
 In Belize , the rainfall in one week represented the average monthly values at some stations . Heavy rainfall from the depression caused levels to rise along rivers and creeks . A bridge that had been rebuilt following earlier Tropical Storm Arthur was flooded , prompting the Belize Defence Force to assist in crossings . This isolated much of Cayo District from the rest of the country until the bridge was repaired . On the western portion of the district , flooding along the Macal River damaged a bridge crossing into northern Guatemala , which restricted traffic only to people returning home . Levels along the Macal and the Belize River were higher than the floods of Hurricane Mitch in 1998 , but less than that of Hurricane Keith in 2000 . The floods caused residents to evacuate after over 1 @,@ 000 homes were flooded ; 311 people stayed in shelters , while the remainder stayed with families and relatives . Of the affected houses , 12 were destroyed and 802 were severely damaged . Most of the affected population was in rural areas of western Belize . One village in Orange Walk District had to be quarantined due to the health threat from the floods for 25 days . Many roads were closed , and there were widespread school closures . Overall , the floods killed two people in the country and caused BZ $ 54 @.@ 1 million ( BZD , $ 27 @.@ 1 million USD ) in damage . Most of the damage was agricultural , accounting for BZ $ 28 @.@ 2 million ( BZD , $ 14 @.@ 1 million USD ) , or 25 % of the country 's agricultural gross domestic product . Other damage included BZ $ 11 @.@ 7 million ( BZD , $ 6 @.@ 3 million USD ) to roads and bridges . The ongoing floods caused BZ $ 2 @.@ 7 million ( BZD , $ 1 @.@ 5 million USD ) in tourism losses , due to closed facilities and water damage .

 Following the floods in Costa Rica , the country 's Red Cross opened shelters to house storm victims . The government advised residents not to drink water out of fear it could be polluted from the flooding . A state of emergency was declared on October 18 due to the effects in Costa Rica . In Nicaragua , officials deployed about 3 @,@ 000 soldiers to assist in flood operations . The World Food Programme provided about 8 tons of food to families in El Salvador affected by the flooding . Then @-@ president of Honduras Manuel Zelaya declared a national state of emergency on October 19 . In Honduras , pre @-@ positioned supplies from UNICEF quickly diminished due to the widespread distribution of blankets and medical kits , raising fears for the spread of disease . The World Food Programme provided about 58 tons of food to 5 @,@ 500 families in Honduras . Residents returned home as floodwaters gradually receded . The Mercy Corps later provided corn and bean seeds to 1 @,@ 300 Honduran farmers to regrow the damaged crops . In May 2009 , the World Bank provided $ 25 million ( USD ) to Honduras to rebuild damaged roads and bridges . Workers in Guatemala airlifted food to storm victims due to residual flooding . The Guatemalan government provided $ 6 @.@ 6 million to residents in the northern portion of the country , including medical supplies and seeds to regrow crops .

 In November , weeks after the tropical depression struck Honduras , Tropical Storm Paloma formed in the western Caribbean and caused additional rainfall in the region . 
 = Jack the Bulldog = 
 Jack the Bulldog is the official mascot of the Georgetown University Hoyas athletic teams . Jack has been the name of at least five live Bulldogs since 1962 , when the name first came into use , though Georgetown counts seven official bulldog mascots including the two living ones . The current incarnation of Jack is an English Bulldog born in 2013 whose full name is John B. Carroll . 
 A puppy born in 2012 named Jack Junior , or J.J. , began assisting Jack in April 2012 , allowing the older Jack to retire after the 2012 – 13 school year and transfer his duties to Jack Junior . However , university administrators determined in July 2013 that J.J. would not be the school 's mascot going forward . By the end of August 2013 , a new puppy had been identified from the same breeders , and John B. Carroll was introduced to the campus in October 2013 . 
 Jack was not always the name of the Georgetown Hoyas ' mascot , nor was the mascot always a bulldog , as other types of dogs , particularly bull terriers , were associated with the sports teams before 1962 . In 2009 , the American Kennel Club ranked Jack as the 8th most popular dog in American culture . Today , Georgetown is among thirty @-@ nine American universities to use a bulldog as their mascot , with Georgia , Butler , Mississippi State , Yale and James Madison being the only others with a live bulldog . Jack is also portrayed by a costumed character Bulldog mascot , a tradition dating to 1977 . 
 = = Early dogs = = 
 Dogs have been associated with the school 's sports teams on an unofficial basis since the late nineteenth century . Early dog mascots may have included a mutt called Hoya around 1900 , a Borzoi named Richmond Jack in 1906 , a bulldog named Hoya in 1907 , and a Boston Bull Terrier in 1911 . At that time , most mascots were primarily associated with the school 's football team , and were cared for by students or individual sports teams , rather than the administration . 
 Sergeant Stubby , a part bull terrier and a decorated World War I war dog , came to campus in 1921 with J. Robert Conroy who was attending Georgetown Law at the time . The school football team used Stubby as a popular halftime show where he would push a football across the field , which established him as a campus celebrity . After Stubby died in 1926 , the team then chose a female bull terrier named Jazz Bo , who had been brought to campus by Georgetown College student Paul Van <unk> . Jazz Bo was retitled " Hoya " by the students , after the traditional " Hoya Saxa " school cheer . The athletic teams are possibly named , in turn , for this dog . When " Hoya " gave birth to a daughter , students named the puppy " Saxa " . 
 Other bull terriers like Saxa filled in as mascot until World War II , when athletics at the school paused during the war . After the war , a series of Great Danes , named Bo , Butch , and Hobo , served as mascot . William Peter Blatty , author of The Exorcist , was one of the students to care for Butch . During this time period mascot abductions by rival schools became a common threat to the animal 's safety . A bull terrier costume was also briefly used by the school , but in 1951 , the school suspended the football program as part of a larger backlash against university sports . This left the school without a mascot . 
 = = Royal Jacket = = 
 In 1962 , with the resumption of football , students Stan <unk> and John Feldmann , editors of The Hoya campus newspaper , founded a committee to raise money for the purchase of a new mascot dog in time for the first new games in 1964 . This committee chose a purebred English Bulldog as the dog which would represent Georgetown students because of their " tenacity . " <unk> also followed the sports team jerseys , which may have previously had an image of a bulldog on them . Around this time the school also adopted as the official logo of the athletics program a new drawing in blue and gray school colors of the bulldog . This logo dog wears a cap typical of the beanie which other freshman at the time had to wear . 
 For $ 150 the committee bought a two @-@ year @-@ old blue @-@ ribbon @-@ champion show dog named " Lil @-@ Nan 's Royal Jacket , " named because the colors of his coat looked like a jacket . This dog was to be renamed " Hoya " like his 1926 predecessor , but refused to respond to any name other than his call name " Jack . " Jack lived outside New South Hall in a heated doghouse . In 1967 , Royal Jacket retired and was replaced by a second bulldog who continued under the simple name " Jack . " In 1977 , as the basketball program gained popularity , the costumed mascot took over duties as Jack . The costume , first worn by student Pat Sheehan , has been updated numerous times , most recently in 2013 . Other live bulldogs owned by students at times joined the costumed Jack , including one named Rocky from 1982 to 1985 and one named Daisy in 1997 . 
 = = John P. Carroll = = 
 In 1998 , Michael Boyle , Austin Martin , and Kathleen Long , co @-@ founders of the Hoya Blue fan club began a campaign to revive the tradition of an official live mascot with the assistance of English professor Father Scott R. Pilarz , S.J. The " Bring Back Jack " Campaign initially sought to find a suitable dog among the students and faculty , as the university did not want to use school funds for the purchase . Ultimately , Hoya Blue raised $ 1 @,@ 500 to purchase a new puppy named Jack ( officially , John P. Carroll ) and placed him in the care of Father Pilarz on February 16 , 1999 . However , after four years , Jack left Georgetown with Pilarz , who was named president of the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania in 2003 , and then president of Marquette University in 2011 . John P. Carroll died on September 16 , 2011 at the home of Pilarz 's parents in Voorhees Township , New Jersey , at the age of 12 . 
 Donations from Hoya Blue , the Hoya Hoop Club , the Office of the President , and alumni allowed for the purchase of the current third incarnation of Jack ( born 2003 ) . 
 = = John S. Carroll = = 
 Jack was born May 3 , 2003 at <unk> Kennel in Freehold Township , New Jersey as a litter of one . He was the son of champion bulldog Copper Kid and a relation of Rocky the 1983 mascot . He was brought to campus on July 19 , 2003 and placed in the care of Father Christopher Steck , S.J. , a theology professor . His official name , as registered with the American Kennel Club was <unk> 's John S. Carroll , which allows for the nickname Jack . This referred to Georgetown founder John Carroll , while " S. " stood for Steck . Similarly the previous mascot was officially John P. Carroll , for Pilarz . He was also infrequently referred to as Jack IV , as the school was unsure of the exact number of dogs used as Jack in the 1970s . 
 Jack lived with Father Christopher Steck in New South Hall , but spent time in Wolfington Hall Jesuit Residence . In 2003 , Father Steck started the " Jack Crew " , a six @-@ student organization of Jack 's walkers and caretakers . Crew members were required to be able to show their school spirit and their ability to control Jack , including being aware of his affinity for orange traffic cones . Jack had both an email address , a Facebook profile , a student ID card , and a local phone number , and the campus directory listed him as part of the theology faculty , like Father Steck . 
 Jack attended home basketball games at the Verizon Center , where he entertained fans by attacking a cardboard box decorated with opponents ' logos . This tradition developed after Steck discovered Jack 's propensity for attacking boxes of brownie mix , and he originally decorated boxes for the games himself . Jack wore a leather collar studded with Georgetown pins , and occasionally wore a team jersey sporting the number one , which Steck purchased at the school bookstore . On campus , Jack attended student meetings and could be booked for social functions . He weighed 55 pounds ( 25 kg ) and his color was described as " red fawn . " Jack 's personality was described as very social , but imperious and stubborn with " a sense of entitlement . " 
 On March 11 , 2012 , Jack tore his ACL , and had to have surgery to repair it on April 23 , 2012 . In March 2013 , school announced that Jack would " retire " from gameday duties after the end of the 2012 – 13 basketball season , and officially take a smaller role . Jack continued to live on campus with Steck until his death on June 2 , 2015 . 
 = = Jack Junior = = 
 On March 30 , 2012 , Georgetown announced the donation of a new bulldog puppy from San Diego breeders Janice and Marcus Hochstetler , whose children Nathan and Rachel attend the school . The school named the puppy Jack Junior , or " J.J. " , and his father was a breed champion , while his mother , named Treasure , and grandmother still live with the Hochstetler family . The puppy , who has been described as " laid back , " was introduced to the community at a ceremony on April 13 , 2012 . 
 Students discovered during Homecoming 2012 that J.J. has an affinity for balloons , and during Midnight Madness he attacked blue and orange balloons , colors of Georgetown 's arch @-@ rival , Syracuse University . He had his debut at the Verizon Center on January 26 , 2013 during a men 's basketball victory over the Louisville Cardinals . On February 8 , 2013 , Jack and J.J. met with Butler University 's mascots , Blue II and Blue III , who were in town on a goodwill tour to Atlantic 10 Conference members . 
 However , during the summer 2013 , trainers at the school determined that , given the " exciting and hectic " life required of the school 's mascot , it would be best for J.J. to return to a home environment , announcing their decision on July 31 , 2013 . An incident involving a small child during the fall 2012 semester , and a subsequent settlement with the child 's family , may have contributed to the school 's decision , though Georgetown spokesperson Rachel Pugh said it wasn 't the only factor . Caretaker Rev. Christopher Steck , S.J. was surprised by the schools decision , and published a letter expressing his disappointment . In an editorial in The Hoya , Steck also lamented the school 's choice not to involve the Bulldog Advisory Committee , which began meeting earlier in the summer , in its decision . After a search by Steck , J.J. was adopted by a family close to the Georgetown campus on August 18 , 2013 . 
 = = John B. Carroll = = 
 On August 30 , 2013 , Pugh announced the arrival of a new puppy , also from the Hochstetler family and an offspring of Treasure , J.J. ' s mother , though they come from different litters . Officially named Compatible 's John B. Carroll , the dog 's middle name stands for " Bulldog " , unlike his predecessors , where the middle name referred to the caretaker 's name . He was born on June 29 , 2013 and was introduced on campus in late October 2013 with appearances at a men 's soccer game against DePaul on October 23 , and around Copley Lawn and Leo J. O 'Donovan Hall . Jack weighs 50 pounds ( 23 kg ) and his color is described as " fawn . " 
 In early October 2013 , the school announced that Steck would not be the new mascot 's caretaker , but that another , not necessarily a Jesuit , would be selected from the Georgetown community . On November 5 , 2013 , the school choose 2013 graduate McKenzie Stough as the bulldog 's caretaker . Besides being an alumna , McKenzie works as a Communications Specialist in the university 's Office of Communications . Responding to criticism , the school involved the fourteen @-@ member Bulldog Advisory Committee in the replacement process and selection of the caretaker . The Jack Crew will also be downsized from twenty students to " four or five " with the selection of this new caretaker . 
 Starting in December 2014 , Jack began performing at home basketball games by riding a skateboard across the court . For the opening game of the 2015 – 16 season , the school produced bobblehead dolls of Jack on a skateboard , wearing jersey number 89 in honor of the year of the school 's founding , 1789 . 
 = Quantitative precipitation forecast = 
 The Quantitative Precipitation Forecast ( abbreviated QPF ) is the expected amount of melted precipitation accumulated over a specified time period over a specified area . A QPF will be created when precipitation amounts reaching a minimum threshold are expected during the forecast 's valid period . Valid periods of precipitation forecasts are normally synoptic hours such as 0000 , 0600 , 1200 and 1800 GMT . Terrain is considered in QPFs by use of topography or based upon climatological precipitation patterns from observations with fine detail . Starting in the mid @-@ to @-@ late 1990s , QPFs were used within hydrologic forecast models to simulate impact to rivers throughout the United States . Forecast models show significant sensitivity to humidity levels within the planetary boundary layer , or in the lowest levels of the atmosphere , which decreases with height . QPF can be generated on a quantitative , forecasting amounts , or a qualitative , forecasting the probability of a specific amount , basis . Radar imagery forecasting techniques show higher skill than model forecasts within 6 to 7 hours of the time of the radar image . The forecasts can be verified through use of rain gauge measurements , weather radar estimates , or a combination of both . Various skill scores can be determined to measure the value of the rainfall forecast . 
 = = Use of radar = = 
 Algorithms exist to forecast rainfall based on short term radar trends , within a matter of hours . Radar imagery forecasting techniques show higher skill than model forecasts within 6 to 7 hours of the time of the radar image . 
 = = Use of forecast models = = 
 In the past , the forecaster was responsible for generating the entire weather forecast based upon available observations . Today , meteorologists ' input is generally confined to choosing a model based on various parameters , such as model biases and performance . Using a consensus of forecast models , as well as ensemble members of the various models , can help reduce forecast error . However , regardless how small the average error becomes with any individual system , large errors within any particularly piece of guidance are still possible on any given model run . Professionals are required to interpret the model data into weather forecasts that are understandable to the lay person . Professionals can use knowledge of local effects which may be too small in size to be resolved by the model to add information to the forecast . As an example , terrain is considered in the QPF process by using topography or climatological precipitation patterns from observations with fine detail . Using model guidance and comparing the various forecast fields to climatology , extreme events such as excessive precipitation associated with later flood events lead to better forecasts . While increasing accuracy of forecast models implies that humans may no longer be needed in the forecast process at some point in the future , there is currently still a need for human intervention . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The forecasting of the precipitation within the next six hours is often referred to as nowcasting . In this time range it is possible to forecast smaller features such as individual showers and thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy , as well as other features too small to be resolved by a computer model . A human given the latest radar , satellite and observational data will be able to make a better analysis of the small scale features present and so will be able to make a more accurate forecast for the following few hours . However , there is now expert systems using those data and mesoscale numerical model to make better extrapolation , including evolution of those features in time . 
 = = = Ensemble forecasting = = = 
 The detail that can be given into a forecast decreases with time as these errors increase . There becomes a point when the errors are so large that the forecast has no correlation with the actual state of the atmosphere . Looking at a single forecast model gives no indication of how likely that forecast is to be correct . Ensemble forecasting entails the production of many forecasts in order to reflect the uncertainty in the initial state of the atmosphere ( due to errors in the observations and insufficient sampling ) . The uncertainty in the forecast can then be assessed by the range of different forecasts produced . Ensemble forecasts are increasingly being used for operational weather forecasting ( for example at European Centre for Medium @-@ Range Weather Forecasts ( ECMWF ) , National Centers for Environmental Prediction ( NCEP ) , and the Canadian forecasting center ) . Ensemble mean forecasts for precipitation have the same problems associated with their use in other fields , as they average out more extreme values , and therefore have limited usefulness for extreme events . In the case of the <unk> ensemble mean , used within the United States , this decreasing usefulness starts with values as low as 0 @.@ 50 inches ( 13 mm ) . 
 = = Probability approach = = 
 In addition to graphical rainfall forecasts showing quantitative amounts , rainfall forecasts can be made describing the probabilities of certain rainfall amounts being met . This allows the forecaster to assign the degree of uncertainty to the forecast . This technique is considered to be informative , relative to climatology . This method has been used for years within National Weather Service forecasts , as a period 's chance of rain equals the chance that 0 @.@ 01 inches ( 0 @.@ 25 mm ) will fall in any particular spot . In this case , it is known as probability of precipitation . These probabilities can be derived from a deterministic forecast using computer post @-@ processing .

 The Bureau of Meteorology began a method of forecasting rainfall using a combination , or ensemble , of different forecast models in 2006 . It is termed The Poor Man 's Ensemble ( <unk> ) . Its forecasts are more accurate over time than any of the individual models composing the ensemble . The <unk> is quick to produce , and is available through their Water and the Land page on their website . 
 = = = Hong Kong = = = 
 The Hong Kong Observatory generates short term rainstorm warnings for systems which are expected to accumulate a certain amount of rainfall per hour over the next few hours . They use three levels of warning . The amber warning indicates that a rainfall intensity of 30 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) per hour is expected . The red warning indicates rainfall amounts of 50 millimetres ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) per hour are anticipated . The black warning indicates that rainfall rates of 70 millimetres ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) are possible . 
 = = = United States = = = 
 Within the United States , the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center , River Forecast Centers , and local forecast offices within the National Weather Service create precipitation forecasts for up to five days in the future , forecasting amounts equal to or greater than 0 @.@ 01 inches ( 0 @.@ 25 mm ) . Starting in the mid @-@ to @-@ late 1990s , QPFs were used within hydrologic forecast models to simulate impact of rainfall on river stages . 
 = = Verification = = 
 Rainfall forecasts can be verified a number of ways . Rain gauge observations can be gridded into areal averages , which are then compared to the grids for the forecast models . Weather radar estimates can be used outright , or corrected for rain gauge observations . 
 Several statistical scores can be based on the observed and forecast fields . One , known as a bias , compares the size of the forecast field to the observed field , with the goal of a score of 1 . The threat score involves the intersection of the forecast and observed sets , with a maximum possible verification score of 1 . The probability of detection , or <unk> , is found by dividing the overlap between the forecast and observed fields by the size of the observed field : the goal here is a score of 1 . The critical success index , or CSI , divides the overlap between the forecast and observed fields by the combined size of the forecast and observed fields : the goal here is a score of 1 . The false alarm rate , or FAR , divides the area of the forecast which does not overlap the observed field by the size of the forecasted area . The goal value in this measure is zero . 
 With tropical cyclones which impact the United States , the GFS global forecast model performed best in regards to its rainfall forecasts over the last few years , outperforming the NAM and ECMWF forecast models . 
 = The Emancipation of Mimi = 
 The Emancipation of Mimi is the tenth studio album by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey , released through Island Records on April 12 , 2005 . The Emancipation of Mimi was considered Carey 's " comeback album " by critics and became her highest @-@ selling release in the US in a decade . In composing the album , the singer collaborated with many songwriters and producers throughout 2004 , including Jermaine Dupri , Snoop Dogg , Twista , Nelly , Pharrell Williams , and James " Big Jim " Wright , many of whom appeared as featured guests on select tracks . 
 Carey opted to use her personal nickname ' Mimi ' in the title , revealing a more intimate side of the singer , as seen in the album 's declarative theme of emancipation from her personal and commercial setbacks . Although it has similar vocal production to her previous works and an inclination towards her signature ballads , the album encompasses dance @-@ oriented and uptempo styles in keeping with its celebratory motif . Critics noted the theme of independence and lack of restraint , dubbing the album a " party " record . In contrast to the R & B and pop @-@ rock music styles that framed her previous releases , The Emancipation of Mimi showcases a wider range of genres , exploring R & B @-@ related styles , such as 1970s retro gospel and soul . 
 The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with the highest first @-@ week sales of Carey 's career at the time . It entered in the top five on the albums charts in Canada , Denmark , France and Japan . The Emancipation of Mimi was the best @-@ selling album of 2005 in the US , and the second @-@ best seller worldwide . By April 2008 , it had sold 12 million copies . 
 " It 's Like That " became one of her highest @-@ charting songs in years , reaching the top twenty in several countries . " We Belong Together " accumulated 14 weeks at number one in the US , and was later hailed " song of the decade " by Billboard . It reached number one in Australia , number two in New Zealand , and achieved top @-@ five positions in several European countries . To promote the album , Carey performed at the 48th Grammy Awards , the MTV Movie Awards 2005 , the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards and the American Music Awards of 2005 . In 2006 , she embarked on her sixth concert tour , The Adventures of Mimi .

 In 2001 , Carey had experienced critical , commercial , personal , and professional struggles , following the poor reception to her debut film Glitter ( 2001 ) . The picture was panned by critics and earned less than eight million dollars at the box office . After posting a personally expressive letter on her official site , Carey checked into a hospital in Connecticut because of an " emotional and physical breakdown " . Following the film 's and soundtrack 's poor performance , Virgin Records America bought out Carey 's unprecedented $ 100 million recording contract . The company paid her $ 50 million to part ways . Carey flew to Capri , Italy , after her two @-@ week hospitalization . During her five @-@ month stay , she began to write a new studio album , using experiences she had gone through in recent months as inspirational themes . After being signed by Island Records and starting her own imprint , MonarC Entertainment , Carey released her intended " comeback " album Charmbracelet . Critics deemed it a strong improvement over Glitter , but not something that would re @-@ establish her popularity as in the early stages of her career . 
 After enduring three years of " carping " from critics , Carey planned her return to music . On November 18 , 2004 , she revealed on her website that the name of the album would be The Emancipation of Mimi . While Carey was recording the album , Island Records executive L.A. Reid had learned that close friends referred to the singer as " Mimi " . He had told Carey , " I feel your spirit on this record . You should use that name in the title , because that 's the fun side of you that people don 't get to see – the side that can laugh at the diva jokes , laugh at the breakdown jokes , laugh at whatever they want to say about you and just live life and enjoy it . " Carey explained that Mimi is a " very personal nickname " only used by those in her inner circle , and thus the title meant she was letting her guard down and inviting her fans to be that much closer to her . She thought that naming her album The Emancipation of Mariah Carey would be " obnoxious " . 
 = = Writing and recording = = 
 During a visit to a recording studio , Carey was given a beat by The Legendary Traxster . On a later date , she met with American rapper Twista backstage after a show . When Carey mentioned the track , Twista told her that the beat had been originally intended for him , and that he had already written lyrics for it . They decided to collaborate on the track , which later was titled " One and Only " . In the following months , Carey wrote and co @-@ produced several songs including " Say Somethin ' ( with Snoop Dogg and The Neptunes ) , " To the Floor " ( with Nelly ) , and " Fly Like a Bird " with James " Big Jim " Wright . By November , she felt that she had composed enough good material for The Emancipation of Mimi . After Reid listened to the album , however , he suggested the singer compose a few more " strong " singles to ensure the project 's commercial success . Based on his recommendation , Carey met with Jermaine Dupri in Atlanta for a brief studio session , since Reid felt she had written some of her best work with him . During this two @-@ day trip , Carey and Dupri wrote and produced " Shake It Off " and " Get Your Number " , which were released as the album 's third and fourth singles . Following this recording session , " Shake It Off " was briefly selected as the album 's lead single , replacing the other contenders , " Stay The Night " and " Say Somethin ' " . Carey later returned to Atlanta for a second meeting with Dupri ; they then penned the last two songs for the album : " We Belong Together " and " It 's Like That " . In an interview for Billboard , Carey described her sentiments regarding " It 's Like That " during the production stage : 
 I had the chills . I had a great feeling about it when we finished writing the song , and I was flying back from Atlanta at some crazy hour of the morning ... But we were listening to it on the plane ride on the way home , and even from the demo version , I really felt something very special . 
 Carey and her management then decided to release " It 's Like That " as the album 's lead single , calling it " the right fire @-@ starter " . The singer has praised Dupri for being " focused " , and felt that together they had composed some of her favorite songs on the album . She has told MTV , " The album is not about making the older executives happy by making a bring @-@ down @-@ the @-@ house , tearjerker ballad , or [ something ] steeped in the media dramas of my life . What I tried to do was keep the sessions very sparse , <unk> , like in ' 70s soul music ... " According to Reid , Carey intended for the album to feature a more unpolished sound than her previous releases . The singer had been frustrated with the overproduction on many of her previous records , due to the inclusion of what she considered unnecessary " bells and whistles " . She opted to record the majority of The Emancipation of Mimi live , alongside the band . Reid agreed with this decision and felt that the live vocals made the album sound more authentic .

 The Emancipation of Mimi was Carey 's most expressive album to that point according to Fox News ; it signified her creative freedom , as she had been oppressed by the expectations of record executives in the past . They noted the album 's motif of professional and cultural emancipation throughout many songs . In an interview with the Hartford Courant , Carey spoke about the album 's lack of creative restraint she felt was not featured on Charmbracelet . The latter album harbored on reviving Carey 's popularity among the adult contemporary radio audience , following her decline with Glitter , which found the singer sampling 1980s melodies . While featuring ballads similar to those on Charmbracelet , the songs on The Emancipation of Mimi drew influence from R & B and hip hop , and were composed at an elevated tempo . According to Dimitri Ehrlich , an editor from Vibe , the album includes many musical facets : 
 Mimi pulls Carey in two opposite directions . Most of the tracks find her paired with the hottest hip hop producers of the day ; there , she exercises restraint and settles into a groove . But on the rest , she does what comes most naturally to her — belting to her heart 's desire , perhaps to mollify those who don 't care much for her detours into raunchier rap territory . 
 The Emancipation of Mimi explores various genres ; Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune felt that the album effectively combines " elements of hip @-@ hop and rhythm and blues into pop songs that appeal to a broad cross @-@ section of listeners . " Aside from the ballads and uptempo tracks , The Emancipation of Mimi incorporates elements of soul and 1970s @-@ inspired genres , evident on the gospel @-@ tinged closing track , " Fly Like a Bird " . While most tracks derive instrumentation from live bands and musical instruments , some of the uptempo songs feature computerized arrangements and synthesizers . Stylistically , critics considered the album Carey 's most diverse record in years , and one that highlighted many different production choices and techniques . 
 = = Songs = = 
 " It 's Like That " was written and produced by Carey and Jermaine Dupri . It features hand claps and whistles , as well as ad @-@ libs and verses from Dupri and Fat Man Scoop . The song 's bassline and chord progression are aligned with piano and string notes . Its lyrics are arranged to portray the singer during a celebration : " I came to have a party / Open off that Bacardi ... Purple taking me higher / I 'm lifted and I like it . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine praised its lyrics and beat , and felt the song prepares listeners for the album 's " party theme " . Lyrically , " We Belong Together " was described as a " broken @-@ hearted lament for love " ; it features finger @-@ snaps , kick drums , and a piano @-@ driven melody . Carey composed the gospel @-@ influenced ballad " Fly Like a Bird " with James Wright . The lyrics are in the form of a prayer that conveys a message of unconditional love for God . The song features a verbal recording of Carey 's pastor , Clarence Keaton , who reads two verses from the Bible . The singer wrote the album 's fifth cut " Say Somethin ' " , which features rap verses from Snoop Dogg and was produced by The Neptunes . Vibe writer Dimitri Ehrlich described it as " a musical oddity " , and characterized the production as " strange instrumentation , weird melodic shifts , hectic drum patterns and a bed of synths . " Lyrically , the protagonist makes sexual advances to a romantic interest with the line " If it 's worth your while , do something good to me . " When interpreting the lyrics in the female role , Cummings noted " a shy woman who doesn 't need to say anything at all to get a man 's attention . " 
 Carey wrote " Mine Again " alongside producer James Poyser . The ballad has electronic keyboard notes , a rhythmic vinyl sound , and melodies from gospel and R & B genres . " Stay the Night " was produced by Carey and Kanye West , and samples a piano loop from Ramsey Lewis 's 1971 cover version of " Betcha by Golly , Wow " . In the lyrics , the protagonist faces the dilemma of spending the night with an ex @-@ lover , although he is in another relationship . " Get Your Number " samples the hook from British band Imagination 's 1982 single " Just an Illusion " , and derives its production from " ' 80s @-@ esque synthesizers " and computerized musical instruments . Lawrence Ferber from the Windy City Times described " Shake It Off " as a " playful approach to bitterness — and , more specifically , a cheatin ' bad apple " , with lyrics such as " I gotta shake you off / Just like a <unk> commercial " . In an interview with Ferber , Carey described the track as her favorite from The Emancipation of Mimi : " ' Shake It Off ' can apply to anything . Whatever personal dramas we go through , put that song on and you lose the anxiety or intensity of the moment . I 'll listen to that song when I 've just come out of an annoying meeting . I gotta shake this off . " Editor Jon Pareles from The New York Times felt that the album follows a formula that was most apparent on " Shake It Off " : " On this album , the verses stay in a narrow range , the choruses glide higher , and at the ends of some songs , Ms. Carey gives herself a few of her old sky @-@ high notes as a background flourish .

 Sixteen months after the release of the album , Carey announced her first headlining tour in three years , named The Adventures of Mimi : The Voice , The Hits , The Tour after a " Carey @-@ centric fan 's " music diary . Beginning on July 22 , 2006 and ending on October 28 , the tour spanned forty stops , with thirty @-@ two in the US and Canada , two in Africa , and six in Japan . The tour featured the singer 's long @-@ time friend Randy Jackson as the musical director . In an interview for the Associated Press , Carey described the tour 's direction , as well as the music she would perform : 
 With this tour , I 'm going to be working on some different arrangements for some of the older songs , to ... give it a little more life to them . That 's not to say they 're going to sound totally different and to freak anybody out ... I love re @-@ singing songs to different music . I genuinely want to tour with these new songs , as well as older hits . These new songs mean so much to me , this time of my life has been so wonderful for me , and I want to experience that with my fans . 
 The tour received a generally mixed reception from critics ; while the singer 's vocals were deemed a highlight , reviewers felt the show 's excesses , such as the singer 's frequent costume changes and pre @-@ filmed clips , were distracting . In Tunis , Carey played to 80 @,@ 000 people during two concerts . Midway through the tour , she booked a two @-@ night concert in Hong Kong , scheduled for after her Japanese shows . The performances were cancelled after tickets went on sale ; Carey 's then @-@ manager Benny Medina said the cancellation was because the concert promoter refused to pay the agreed compensation . The promoter blamed poor ticket sales ( allegedly , only 4 @,@ 000 tickets had sold ) and " Carey 's outrageous demands " . Medina later disputed the promoter 's ticket sales figure , saying that 8 @,@ 000 tickets had been sold . He said Carey would have performed as long as she was compensated , regardless of attendance . Carey ultimately sued the promoter , claiming one million in damages for the concert 's abrupt cancellation .

 The Emancipation of Mimi received a 64 out of 100 ( indicating " generally positive reviews " ) on Metacritic , a website that averages professional reviews from critics into a numerical score . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called the album a " highly crafted piece of dance @-@ pop " and " relative comeback " for Carey , although it is not as " catchy " as he thought it should have been . Erlewine voiced a common criticism of the album : that Carey 's voice seemed " damaged " in comparison to her " glory years " in the 1990s . He commented that in the belted songs such as " Fly Like a Bird " and " I Wish You Knew " , Carey 's voice sounded " as airy , thin , and damaged as it did on Charmbracelet " . Michael Paoletta from Billboard was less critical of her vocals , writing that " while her voice has lost some of the power through the years , Mimi deftly showcases her still @-@ considerable pipes with strong lyrics and slick production . " Paoletta praised The Emancipation of Mimi as Carey 's best album since Butterfly ( 1997 ) . Michael Dougall Bell from the Calgary Sun called Carey 's voice " very impressive " . He concluded : " While Emancipation may not send Carey 's stock or star back up to where it once was and where that voice deserves to be , at least she 's not plummeting – she 's merely levelled off . " Entertainment Weekly editor Tom Sinclair noted that almost every song " showcases Carey 's undeniable vocal strengths " . Reviewing " Fly Like a Bird " , Sinclair concluded , " It 's so moving that we 'll resist the temptation to be crass and interpret the song as a plea for heightened record sales . Help from above is always welcome , but Emancipation sounds like it just might do fine all on its own . " 
 Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News considered the album 's title to be influenced by Janet Jackson 's Damita Jo , which was also based on an alternate persona . According to Jenson Macey from BBC News , The Emancipation of Mimi was Carey 's strongest effort from the 2000s ; he said that the album " took her straight back to the top of the A @-@ List . " Caroline Sullivan from The Guardian gave the album four stars out of five , calling it " cool , focused and urban . " The New York Times 's , Jon Pareles , complimented how Carey wrote all of the album 's material . He felt the record 's sound was fresh and innovative : " on The Emancipation of Mimi , she disciplines herself into coherence , using fewer tricks and sounding more believable . She also finds what lesser singers can take for granted : a certain lightness that eases her constant sense of control . " Cummings from PopMatters gave the album seven stars out of ten , claiming it to be Carey 's redemption from the manacles of her previous two releases . He praised the album 's singles , but called some of its music " corny " and " unnecessarily overproduced " . Todd Burns from Stylus Magazine gave the album a B − , admiring its assortment of beats and tempos . Burns , however , called some of The Neptunes and Dupri 's production " ill @-@ advised " . He called some of Carey 's vocals " strained , thin and airy " . While considering it as an improvement over her previous releases of the decade , he concluded that it " suffers from the fact that her vocals have deteriorated – a simple fact of the ravages that her voice has undergone in the past fifteen years . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave The Emancipation of Mimi three and a half stars out of five , calling it " redemption " . He complimented its array of beats and its production . Critic Andre Meyer of CBS News thought the material on the album was " stronger " than on Charmbracelet , and described it as a move in Carey 's long @-@ term plan for pop domination , while giving off the " jittery R & B vibe that made Destiny 's Child so potent . " He added that " Mariah has returned to singing – while still pushing the limits of good taste with her barely there outfits . "

 = Edmund the Martyr = 
 Edmund the Martyr ( also known as St Edmund or Edmund of East Anglia , died 20 November 869 ) was king of East Anglia from about 855 until his death . 
 Almost nothing is known about Edmund . He is thought to have been of East Anglian origin and was first mentioned in an annal of the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle , written some years after his death . The kingdom of East Anglia was devastated by the Vikings , who destroyed any contemporary evidence of his reign . Later writers produced fictitious accounts of his life , asserting that he was born in 841 , the son of Æthelweard , an obscure East Anglian king , whom it was said Edmund succeeded when he was fourteen ( or alternatively that he was the youngest son of a Germanic king named ' Alcmund ' ) . Later versions of Edmund 's life relate that he was crowned on 25 December 855 at Burna ( probably Bures St. Mary in Suffolk ) , which at that time functioned as the royal capital , and that he became a model king . 
 In 869 , the Great Heathen Army advanced on East Anglia and killed Edmund . He may have been slain by the Danes in battle , but by tradition he met his death at an unidentified place known as <unk> , after he refused the Danes ' demand that he renounce Christ : the Danes beat him , shot him with arrows and then beheaded him , on the orders of Ivar the Boneless and his brother Ubba . According to one legend , his head was then thrown into the forest , but was found safe by searchers after following the cries of a wolf that was calling , " Hic , Hic , Hic " – " Here , Here , Here " . Commentators have noted how Edmund 's death bears resemblance to the fate suffered by St Sebastian , St Denis and St Mary of Egypt . 
 A coinage commemorating Edmund was minted from around the time East Anglia was absorbed by the kingdom of Wessex and a popular cult emerged . In about 986 , Abbo of Fleury wrote of his life and martyrdom . The saint 's remains were temporarily moved from Bury St Edmunds to London for safekeeping in 1010 . His shrine at Bury was visited by many kings , including Canute , who was responsible for rebuilding the abbey : the stone church was rebuilt again in 1095 . During the Middle Ages , when Edmund was regarded as the patron saint of England , Bury and its magnificent abbey grew wealthy , but during the Dissolution of the Monasteries , his shrine was destroyed . The mediaeval manuscripts and other works of art relating to Edmund that have survived include Abbo 's Passio Sancti Eadmundi , John Lydgate 's 14th @-@ century Life , the Wilton Diptych and a number of church wall paintings . 
 = = King of the East Angles = = 
 = = = Accession and rule = = = 
 Edmund is first mentioned in the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle annal for 870 , which was compiled twenty years after his death . By tradition , Edmund is thought to have been born in 841 and to have acceded to the East Anglian throne in around 855 . Nothing is known of his life or reign , as no contemporary East Anglian documents from this period have survived . The devastation in East Anglia that was caused by the Vikings is thought to have destroyed any books or charters that referred to Edmund and the lack of contemporary evidence means that it is not known for certain when his reign began , or his age when he became king . Later medieval chroniclers have provided dubious accounts of his life , in the absence of any real details . The most credible theory for Edmund ’ s parentage suggests Ealhhere , brother @-@ in @-@ law to King Æthelstan of Kent , as Edmund ’ s father and Edith ( Æthelstan ’ s sister ) as Edmund ’ s mother . 
 Edmund cannot be placed within any ruling dynasty . Numismatic evidence suggests he succeeded Æthelweard . According to the historian Susan Ridyard , Abbo of Fleury 's statement that Edmund was ' ex antiquorum Saxonum nobili <unk> <unk> ' can be taken to mean that he was descended from a noble and ancient race . 
 It is known that a variety of different coins were minted by Edmund 's moneyers during his reign . The letters AN , standing for ' Anglia ' , only appear on the coins of Edmund and Æthelstan of East Anglia : they appear on Edmund 's coins as part of the phrase + <unk> REX AN . Later specimens read + <unk> REX and so it is possible for his coins to be divided chronologically . Otherwise , no chronology for his coins has been confirmed . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 The Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle , which generally described few matters relating to the East Angles and their rulers , is the only source for a description of the events for the year 869 that led to the defeat of Edmund 's army at the hands of the Danes . It relates that " Her rad se here <unk> <unk> <unk> East Engle and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . And <unk> <unk> ' <unk> <unk> him <unk> <unk> and þa <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and þæt <unk> all ge <unk> . " – ' here the army rode across Mercia into East Anglia , and took winter @-@ quarters at Thetford ; and that winter King Edmund fought against them , and the Danish took the victory , and killed the king and conquered all that land ' . By tradition the leaders who slew the king were Ivar the Boneless and his brother Ubba . 
 Along with other forces , the Great Heathen Army then invaded Wessex , perhaps in December 870 ( within a few weeks of killing Edmund ) or after having spent a year pillaging and consolidating their position in East Anglia , before proceeding to attack Mercia and Northumbria . 
 = = Memorial coinage = = 
 Edmund 's body was buried in a wooden chapel near to where he was killed , but was later transferred to <unk> ( modern Bury St Edmunds ) , where in 925 Athelstan founded a community devoted to the new cult . Thirty years after Edmund 's death , he was venerated by the Vikings of East Anglia , who produced a coinage to commemorate him . The coinage was minted from around 895 to 915 ( close to the time when East Anglia was conquered by Edward the Elder of Wessex ) and was based on the design of coins produced during Edmund 's reign . All the pennies and ( more rarely ) half @-@ pennies that were produced read SCE <unk> REX — ' O St Edmund the king ! ' . Some of them have a legend that provides evidence that the Vikings experimented with their initial design . 
 The St. Edmund memorial coins were minted in great quantities by a group of more than 70 moneyers , many of whom appear to have originated from the continent : over 1800 individual specimens were found when the great <unk> Hoard was discovered in 1840 . The coins would have been widely used within the Danelaw and many single items have mainly been found in the east of England , but the exact locations of the mints where they were made are not known with certainty : scholars have assumed that they were made in East Anglia . 
 = = Veneration = = 
 = = = Cult at Bury St Edmunds = = = 
 During the 11th century a stone church was built in Bury St. Edmunds , which was replaced by a larger church in 1095 , into which Edmund 's relics were translated . The abbey 's power grew upon being given jurisdiction over the growing town in 1028 and the creation in 1044 , of the geographical and political area of the Liberty of Saint Edmund , established by Edward the Confessor , which remained a separate jurisdiction under the control of the abbot of Bury St Edmunds Abbey until the dissolution of the monasteries . 
 The shrine at Bury St Edmunds soon became one of the most famous and wealthy pilgrimage locations in England . In 1010 , Edmund 's remains were translated to London to protect them from the Vikings , where they were kept for three years before being returned to Bury . For centuries the shrine was visited by various kings of England , many of whom gave generously to the abbey : Sweyn 's son , King Canute , converted to Christianity and rebuilt the abbey at Bury St Edmunds . In 1020 , he made a pilgrimage and offered his own crown upon the shrine as atonement for the sins of his forefathers . 
 The town arose as the wealth and fame of the abbey grew . After the Norman conquest of England in 1066 , the abbot planned out over 300 new houses within a grid @-@ iron pattern at a location that was close to the abbey precincts . Edmund 's cult was promoted and flourished , but it declined in subsequent years and the saint did not reappear in any liturgical calendars until the appearance of Abbo of Fleury 's Passio Sancti Eadmundi in the 12th century . King John is said to have given a great sapphire and a precious stone set in gold to the shrine , which he was permitted to keep upon the condition that it was returned to the abbey when he died . 
 Edmund 's shrine was destroyed in 1539 , during the English Reformation . According to a letter ( which now belongs to the Cotton Collection in the British Library ) , the shrine was defaced , and silver and gold to the value of over 5000 marks was taken away . On 4 November 1539 the abbot and his monks were expelled and the abbey was dissolved . 
 = = = Cult at Toulouse = = = 
 After the Battle of Lincoln ( 1217 ) , it was traditionally claimed that Edmund 's body was stolen by Count of Melun and subsequently donated to the Basilica of Saint @-@ Sernin in the French city of Toulouse by the Dauphin ( later Louis XIII of France ) . The first record of this is a relic list for Saint @-@ Sernin of around 1425 , which included St Edmund among the basilica 's relics . After the city was saved from the plague in the years from 1628 to 1631 — by the saint 's <unk> — the city built , in 1644 , a new shrine for his relics in gratitude for its deliverance : his cult flourished there for over two centuries . Edmund 's shrine was of silver and adorned with solid silver statues and when his relics were translated to it , the population came for eight days to honour the saint . 
 = = = Relics at Arundel Castle = = = 
 In 1901 , the Archbishop of Westminster , Herbert Vaughan , received some relics from the basilica of Saint @-@ Sernin . The relics , believed at the time to be those of St Edmund , were intended for the high altar of London 's Westminster Cathedral , which was then under construction . 
 The acceptance of the relics required the intercession of Pope Leo XIII , after an initial refusal by the church in France . Upon their arrival in England , they were housed in the Fitzalan Chapel at Arundel Castle , prior to their translation to Westminster . Although the relics had been verified and catalogued in 1644 for interment in the new shrine and in 1874 when two pieces were given to Cardinal Manning , concerns were raised by Dr. Montague James and Dr Charles Biggs about their validity in The Times . They remained at Arundel under the care of the Duke of Norfolk , whilst a historical commission was set up by Cardinal Vaughan and Archbishop Germain of Saint @-@ Sernin . They remain to this day at Arundel . In 1966 , three teeth from the collection of relics from France were donated to Douai Abbey . 
 = = The Passio Sancti Eadmundi = = 
 Edmund 's cult re @-@ emerged in the 10th century and the site of his burial grew wealthy as a result of receiving grants of land from royally connected benefactors . In about 986 , the monks of Ramsey Abbey commissioned Abbo of Fleury to write an account of the saint 's life and early cult . In his preface or dedicatory epistle Abbo addresses the work to St Dunstan , Archbishop of Canterbury 960 @-@ 988 . Dunstan himself is the source of the story of the martyrdom , which long before he heard told , in the presence of King Æthelstan , by an old man who swore an oath that he had been Edmund 's own sword @-@ bearer ( armiger ) on the fatal day . Abbo therefore clearly makes Dunstan , then still living and the recipient of his work , the authority for what he has to say . 
 According to Abbo , Edmund was " ex antiquorum Saxonum nobili <unk> <unk> " . This statement has confused later translators into thinking that Edmund was of continental Old Saxon origin . However the historian Steven Plunkett notes that Abbo , describing the Migration Age settlement of the East Anglian region ( <unk> ) at the opening of his work , attributed that occupation to ' Saxons ' ( the Jutes and Angles going elsewhere ) : therefore by the use of the term ' of the noble lineage of the old Saxons ' for Edmund , he was not attempting to make a distinction between Edmund 's own ancestry and that of the people over whom he ruled . 
 In Abbo 's version of events , the king refused to meet the Danes in battle , preferring to die a martyr 's death . The historian Susan Ridyard maintains that Edmund 's martyrdom cannot be proved and the nature of his fate — whether he died fighting or was cruelly murdered in the battle 's aftermath — cannot be read from the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle . She notes that the story that Edmund had an armour @-@ bearer implies that he would have been a warrior king who was prepared to fight the Vikings on the battlefield , but she acknowledges the possibility that later accounts belong to " the realm of hagiographical fantasy " . 
 Abbo named one of Edmund 's killers as <unk> , who can probably be identified with Ivarr inn <unk> ( Ivar the Boneless ) , son of Ragnar Lodbrok . After describing the horrific manner of Edmund 's death , the Passio continued the story . His severed head was thrown into the wood . As Edmund 's followers went seeking , calling out " Where are you , friend ? " the head answered , " Here , here , here , " until at last they found it , clasped between a wolf 's paws , protected from other animals and uneaten . The villagers then praised God and the wolf that served him . It walked tamely beside them , before vanishing back into the forest . 
 The body was buried in a coffin and later translated to <unk> , but Abbo failed to date either events , although from the text it can be seen that he believed that the relics had been taken to <unk> by the time that <unk> became Bishop of London in around 926 . Upon exhumation of the body , a miracle was discovered . All the arrow wounds upon Edmund 's corpse had healed and his head was reattached . The only evidence of decapitation was a line around his neck and his skin was still soft and fresh , as if he had been sleeping . The last recorded inspection of the body whilst at Bury St Edmunds was in 1198 . 
 The resemblance between the deaths of Saint Sebastian and St Edmund was remarked upon by Abbo : both saints were attacked by archers , although only Edmund is supposed to have been decapitated . His death bears <unk> resemblance to the fate suffered by other saints : St Denis was whipped and beheaded and the body of Mary of Egypt was said to have been guarded by a lion . Gransden describes Abbo 's Passio as " little more that a hotch @-@ potch of hagiographical commonplaces " and argues that Abbo 's ignorance of what actually happened to Edmund would have led him to use aspects of the Lives of well known saints such as Sebastian and Denis as models for his version of Edmund 's <unk> . Gransden acknowledges that there are some aspects of the story — such as the appearance of the wolf that guards Edmund 's head — that do not have exact parallels elsewhere . 
 Other commentators have suggested that the manner of St Edmund 's death , veneration and <unk> define him as a sacral king . It has been argued that St Edmund 's story was informed by common Celtic and Germanic notions of sacred kingship . Comparable kings who also embodied theories of divinely @-@ ordained rule , rightful sovereignty and the binding links between king , land and society , include : Conaire Mór , Cormac mac <unk> , King <unk> and Halfdan the Black . 
 = = Medieval hagiographies and legends = = 
 De <unk> Sancti <unk> , a fictitious 12th century hagiography of Edmund 's early life by Geoffrey of Wells , represented him as the youngest son of ' Alcmund ' , a Saxon king of Germanic descent . ' Alcmund ' may never have existed . 
 Edmund 's fictitious continental origins were later expanded into legends which spoke of his parentage , his birth at Nuremberg , his adoption by Offa of Mercia , his nomination as successor to the king and his landing at Hunstanton on the North Norfolk coast to claim his kingdom . Other accounts state that his father was the king he succeeded , Æthelweard of East Anglia , who died in 854 , apparently when Edmund was a boy of fourteen . 
 He was said to have been crowned by St Humbert ( Bishop Humbert of Elmham ) on 25 December 855 , at a location known as Burna ( probably Bures St. Mary in Suffolk ) which at that time functioned as the royal capital . Later versions of his life recorded that he was a model king who treated all his subjects with equal justice and who was unbending to flatterers . It was written that he withdrew for a year to his royal tower at Hunstanton and learned the whole Psalter , so that he could recite it from memory . 
 Edmund may have been killed at Hoxne , in Suffolk . His martyrdom is mentioned in a charter that was written when the church and chapel at Hoxne were granted to Norwich Priory in 1101 . Place @-@ name evidence has been used to link the name of Hoxne with <unk> , named by Abbo of Fleury as the site of Edmund 's martyrdom , but this evidence is dismissed by the historian Peter Warner . The association of Edmund 's cult with the village has continued to the present day . <unk> , Cambridgeshire and Bradfield St Clare ( near Bury St Edmunds ) are other possible sites for where Edmund was martyred . 
 The ancient wooden church of St Andrew , <unk> @-@ juxta @-@ Ongar , is said to have been a resting place for his body on the way to Bury St Edmunds in 1013 
 = = Banner = = 
 In Bernard Burke 's <unk> of Families , published in 1869 , Burke proposed that Edmund 's banner was among those borne during the Norman invasion of Ireland , after which the three crowns on a blue background became the standard for Ireland during the Plantagenet era . Richard de Clare , 2nd Earl of Pembroke , Robert Fitz @-@ Stephen and Raymond le Gros who all featured prominently in the Anglo @-@ Norman invasion , dedicated a chapel of Christ Church Cathedral , Dublin to Edmund . When the Scottish castle at <unk> was taken by Edward I of England in 1300 , the banners of Edmund , St George and Edward the Confessor were displayed by the victorious English from the castle battlements , as " powerful , unifying symbols of the holy guardians and supporters of their cause " . According to the antiquarian Sir Harris Nicolas ' account of the Battle of Agincourt in 1415 , five banners were flown on the English side , one of which was probably that of St Edmund . 
 In a preface to the Life of the saint written by the poet John Lydgate , in which Edmund 's banners are described , the three crowns are said to represent Edmund 's martyrdom , virginity and kingship . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 Edmund is the patron saint of pandemics as well as kings , the Roman Catholic diocese of East Anglia , and Douai Abbey in Berkshire . Churches dedicated to his memory are to be found all over England , including St Edmund the King and Martyr 's Church in London , designed by Sir Christopher Wren during the 1670s . St Edmund King and Martyr 's Church in Godalming , Surrey was dedicated to Edmund because its founder was from Suffolk . 
 During the Middle Ages , St George replaced Edmund as the patron saint of England when Edward III associated George with the Order of the Garter . In 2006 , a group that included BBC Radio Suffolk and the East Anglian Daily Times failed in their campaign to reinstate Edmund . In 2013 another campaign to reinstate St Edmund as patron saint was begun with the backing of representatives from businesses , Churches , radio and local politicians .

 The veneration of Edmund throughout the centuries has left a legacy of noteworthy works of art . 
 A beautifully illustrated copy of Abbo of Fleury 's Passio Sancti Eadmundi , made at Bury St Edmunds in around 1130 is now kept at the Morgan Library in New York . 
 The copy of John Lydgate 's 15th century Life written for Henry VI of England is now in the British Library . The Wilton Diptych was painted during the reign of Richard II of England and is the most famous representation of Edmund in art . Painted on oak panels , it shows Richard kneeling in front of three saints — one of whom is Edmund — as they present the young king to the Virgin and Child . 
 The poet John Lydgate ( 1370 – 1451 ) , who lived all his life in Bury St Edmunds , presented his twelve @-@ year @-@ old king Henry VI of England with a long poem ( now known as Metrical Lives of Saints Edmund and <unk> ) when Henry came to the town in 1433 and stayed at the abbey for four months . The book is now kept by the British Library in London . 
 Edmund 's martyrdom features on several medieval wall @-@ paintings to be found in churches across England . 
 The market town of Bury St Edmunds features several representations of St Edmund , most notably a recently commissioned contemporary artwork designed by Emmanuel O ’ Brien , constructed by Nigel <unk> of Designs on Metal in 2011 .

 Tsubasa : Reservoir Chronicle ( Japanese : ツバサ @-@ <unk> <unk> , Hepburn : Tsubasa : <unk> Kuronikuru ) is a shōnen manga series written and illustrated by the manga artist group Clamp . It takes place in the same fictional universe as many of Clamp 's other manga series , most notably xxxHolic . The plot follows how Sakura , the princess of the Kingdom of Clow , loses all her memories and how Syaoran , a young archaeologist who is her childhood friend , goes on a quest to save her . Dimensional Witch Yūko Ichihara instructs him to go with two people , Kurogane and Fai D. Flowright . They search for Sakura 's memories , which were scattered in various worlds in the form as feathers , as gathering them will help save her soul . Tsubasa was conceived when four Clamp artists wanted to create a manga series that connected all their previous works . They took the designs for the main protagonists from their earlier manga called Cardcaptor Sakura . 
 It was serialized in the Kodansha publication Weekly Shōnen Magazine from May 2003 until October 2009 , and was collected in twenty @-@ eight tankōbon volumes . The manga was adapted into an anime series , Tsubasa Chronicle ( ツバサ ･ クロニクル , Tsubasa Kuronikuru ) , animated by Bee Train , which aired 52 episodes over two seasons during 2005 and 2006 . Production I.G released an interlude film between the first two seasons titled The Princess in the Birdcage Kingdom , as well as five original video animations ( OVAs ) between November 2007 and May 2009 , which acted as a sequel to the second season . Various video games and drama CDs based on the series have been released . A sequel titled Tsubasa : <unk> CHRoNiCLE started serialization in 2014 . 
 The manga was licensed for English language release by Del Rey Manga , who has released all of its volumes since April 27 , 2004 . Funimation Entertainment licensed the anime for English release . They published all the TV episodes in DVD volumes as well as the film . The OVAs of Tsubasa were released in North America in January 2011 . 
 The series has been well received by Japanese and English readers , and it reached high positions on various best @-@ seller lists ; the series has sold over twenty million manga volumes in Japan . Both the manga and anime have had positive response from critics , who praised its connections to previous works and its artwork . The plot twists in later parts of the story have been generally praised for how they affect the overall plot as well as for being surprising . However , they have been criticized for being confusing . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The series begins by introducing childhood friends with quite a strong and close friendship : Syaoran , a young archaeologist who is investigating a ruin within the Kingdom of Clow , and Sakura , princess of the Kingdom of Clow and daughter of the late king Clow Reed . When Sakura visits Syaoran in the ruins , her spirit takes on the form of a pair of ghostly feathered wings that disintegrate to other dimensions . As she descends into a catatonic near death state , Syaoran meets the Dimensional Witch , Yūko Ichihara , to whom he begs for help to save Sakura . Yūko is also visited by two others who each have their own wish : Kurogane , a ninja who wishes to return to his home world after being banished from his world by Princess Tomoyo to allow him to learn what true strength is ; and Fai D. Flowright , a magician who wishes to never return to his home world , Celes , to avoid his king , Ashura @-@ ō . In exchange for the ability to travel across dimensions , Yūko demands that each pay with that they value most : Kurogane offers his sword <unk> ; Fai offers the tattoo that suppresses his enormous magical strength and power ; and Syaoran offers all of Sakura 's memories that involve him . Yūko then presents them with a creature named Mokona Modoki that sends the group on a journey across dimensions in search of Sakura 's feathers . After obtaining the first feathers , Sakura awakens from her catatonic state and starts recovering her memories . During their adventures , the group gradually grows closer to the point that Fai jokingly labels them as relatives . As they travel , they learn that the feathers have their own unique abilities and can bestow several supernatural abilities to those who possess them . 
 During their journey in Tokyo , the group discovers that Syaoran is in reality a clone imbued with half the heart of the original Syaoran . Several years ago , Fei @-@ Wang Reed , the wizard who caused Sakura to lose her memories , took the original Syaoran prisoner and created the clone to collect Sakura 's feathers . Shortly after the original Syaoran breaks free of Fei @-@ Wang 's hold , the clone loses his heart and becomes an emotionless puppet that follows Fei @-@ Wang 's will , betraying the group . The original Syaoran joins in the group 's journey with Sakura wishing to save the clone . Foreseeing a future in which Fai kills the original Syaoran forced by Fei @-@ Wang 's curse , Sakura gets stabbed in his place , but at the same time splits her body and soul , sending each to different worlds , <unk> and the Dream World , respectively . In the Dream World , the Syaoran clone destroys Sakura 's soul when trying to get the feathers . Before her soul perishes , Sakura reveals that she too is a clone of the original Sakura who was also taken prisoner by Fei @-@ Wang . Fei @-@ Wang then takes Sakura 's body to use its stored power . The group departs to rescue the two <unk> learning from Yūko that Fei @-@ Wang is in an alternate dimension from the Kingdom of Clow . Such parallel dimension is the result of Syaoran 's wish to save the original Sakura from Fei @-@ Wang 's curse years ago . In order to grant his wish , Syaoran became Fei @-@ Wang 's prisoner and Yūko 's assistant , Kimihiro Watanuki , was used to replace Syaoran within his original world 's history . 
 The group battles Fei @-@ Wang who destroys the Syaoran clone when he betrays him . He then uses the immeasurably strong ability and strength of the two <unk> to resurrect Yūko , accidentally frozen in time by Clow Reed himself to halt her death , therein proving himself Clow 's superior . Yūko uses her life and Clow 's magic as payment to make the clones reborn in the past to live together . As the two know all of the series ' events would repeat , the clones seal themselves in Yūko 's shop until the battle against him . The group manages to kill Fei @-@ Wang , who traps Syaoran in a void between time and space , dragging both his clone and Watanuki along as a consequence of their connection . With their creator 's death , both clones of Sakura and Syaoran fade away leaving behind two feathers . Syaoran and Watanuki escape from the void for a price : Syaoran must continue traveling through the dimensions forever , while Watanuki must stay in Yūko 's shop . The group rests in the Kingdom of Clow where Fai , Kurogane , and Mokona decide to join Syaoran once again in hope of finding a way to bring back the clones who still exist as the two feathers . Before departing on their separate ways , Syaoran and Sakura confess their mutually strong , close and pure romantic love for each other as they hope to meet again . 
 = = Production = = 
 Tsubasa : Reservoir Chronicle began with an inspiration of the four @-@ member team , Clamp , to link their works set in a realistic world with their works set in different fantasy worlds . Prior to beginning work on Tsubasa : Reservoir Chronicle , Clamp had created the manga Cardcaptor Sakura , from which the two main characters are taken . Clamp decided to draw Tsubasa : Reservoir Chronicle by using a style first conceived by Osamu Tezuka , named the " father of manga " and often credited as the " father of anime " , known as Osamu Tezuka 's Star System . In this system , characters with the same name and design are used in different settings , drawing mostly from the vast character pool of its own works and occasionally from others ' works . Unlike characters under the Star System , three months prior to the release of Tsubasa : Reservoir Chronicle , the Young Magazine began serializing Clamp 's xxxHolic , a manga whose two main characters , Kimihiro Watanuki and Yūko Ichihara , are two of the same characters used in Tsubasa : Reservoir Chronicle ; both series run in parallel . Like many of their other works , each member of Clamp had a role different from their other projects instead of retaining set roles . For Tsubasa : Reservoir Chronicle , Mokona drew the main characters , whereas Tsubaki Nekoi and Satsuki Igarashi drew the side characters and backgrounds ; Nanase Ohkawa was the sole person in charge of the storyline ; the other members of Clamp were not told in advance how the plot would unfold . The word " Tsubasa " was used so that the title would be easy to read . However , believing " Tsubasa " only would be too short , they added the words " Chronicle " and " Reservoir " from Nekoi 's notes . 
 A special interview with Ohkawa and <unk> Sugawara , Clamp 's editor from the Weekly Shōnen Magazine 's Editorial Department , took place after the story of Tsubasa : Reservoir Chronicle had progressed past the arc from <unk> Country . Ohkawa has stated that the group is very conscious of the fact that Tsubasa : Reservoir Chronicle is the title in Shōnen Magazine with the youngest readership and that it is their very first foray into the shōnen demographic . Thus , the members of Clamp ensure that they employ a drawing style and dialogue appropriate for young male audiences ; the manga incorporates furigana that makes reading Japanese easier . To aid in this effort , the group holds conferences with Sugawara where they discuss the plot . Ohkawa stated during the interview that the only time the story significantly changed was during Country of Jade arc ; It went from a " horror story with vampires " to a " detective mystery " . Following the story in the <unk> Country , Clamp aimed to make the series darker and more complex , resulting in it receiving elements previously seen in other of their series . The Shura Country 's story was written to introduce the idea that a dead person cannot be revived even if somebody travels back to the past and changes history . This theme would be further explored later in the story . 
 The members of Clamp had some difficulty adjusting from their typical style after deciding to publish with Weekly Shōnen Magazine . Because their typical thinner lines did not give the desired impact , Ohkawa expressed the group 's desire to make their lines thicker , and to use simpler layouts similar to the other stories already present in Shōnen Magazine . She stated that they used their original artistic style to attract initial readers and then slowly transitioned to a new style . Sometime around when the story arc focused on the Country of <unk> took place , their art style had gradually been changing again ; at this point they were thinking of returning to their original style . They were still adjusting to a weekly schedule ; many of their previous works were on a monthly schedule . Sugawara expressed concerns about the strain on the artists of concurrently doing a weekly issue of Tsubasa : Reservoir Chronicle linked with xxxHolic , but in the end he whole @-@ heartedly approved . In accordance with Ohkawa 's desire for each to have a well @-@ organized story , Clamp avoids putting references between the two stories too frequently . The main idea was connecting these two series was to have protagonists from two different manga with different personalities and designs . However , during the ending they would be stated to share the same existence , and had to go on different paths . As Tsubasa is connected with xxxHolic , the characters ' designs are also meant to be similar ; Like xxxHolic , the artwork is sometimes influenced by Ukiyo @-@ e art style which leads to the characters have longer limbs . When asked if another series influenced Tsubasa in the concept of parallel worlds , Ohkawa replied that she was not a fan of sci @-@ fi series and pointed that all worlds shown in the series were other works from Tsubasa . At the same time , she wanted to segregate Tsubasa from previous works . She also explained that while some characters are the same , their traits and personalities were modified due to different backstories . 
 When thinking about including character goods with the volume releases , Sugawara came up with the atypical idea of releasing a deluxe and normal edition of the manga after contemplating the inconsistency of novels getting both a soft @-@ cover and hard @-@ cover release , but manga only received one version . Because it was a new concept , the group experienced several mishaps such as accidentally placing a vertically flipped illustration on the first deluxe edition . The group also decided to use another atypical practice of keeping catchphrases that appeared in the magazine identical to the ones that appear on the <unk> of the deluxe editions . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Tsubasa explores the fragility of human relationships through Sakura losing all of her memories involving her love interest , Syaoran . Despite this tragedy , Syaoran manages to become friends with other characters across his journey . Furthermore , Sakura once again develops feelings for Syaoran who at the same time starts falling for her again . The development of the characters ' relationship demonstrates how while modern society depends on already existing one , a severed one can be reformed if people have the will . At the same time , Syaoran has to say goodbye to the people he met as a result of having to continue travelling . Despite also losing these new founds friends , these actions will help Syaoran grow into a young man . 
 Another theme in the series is the use of identical people as a result of the characters travelling to parallel worlds where they find alternative versions of people they met before . Despite sharing the same physical appearances , these identical versions have been through different experiences earning their own identities . Syaoran also has his own doppelgänger commonly referred as " The Other Syaoran " who at the same time shares the same identity as the protagonist from xxxHolic , Kimihiro Watanuki . Across the series , these character are developed and choose their own paths to earn their own identities .

 The Tsubasa : Reservoir Chronicle manga series was well received by Japanese readers , and appeared at various times on lists of best @-@ selling volumes . In September 2009 , it was announced that the first 27 volumes had sold over 20 million copies in Japan , becoming one of Clamp 's best selling titles . In its debut , the first volume of World Chronicle sold 127 @.@ 643 units . After the first volume 's English release on April 27 , 2004 , it sold 2 @,@ 330 copies in May 2004 , placing it at the top end of the top 100 sales of that month . It was fifth on Waldenbooks 's 2004 list , obtaining the highest place ever by a manga volume . It was consistently ranked in the top 10 of the list of Manga Top 50 for every quarterly release of the " ICv2 Retailers Guide to Anime / Manga " , based on sales from both mainstream bookstores and comic book shops , since its release in May 2004 , except for the fourth quarter of 2007 , reaching a top rank of number 3 . By November 2006 , over a million manga volumes from the series had been sold in North America by Del Rey Manga . The series was also listed as the nineteenth best @-@ selling manga from North America in 2010 by ICv2 . In the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation Award from 2009 , Tsubasa : Reservoir Chronicle was the winner in the category " Best Manga - Action " . About.com placed it twenty @-@ ninth in their article " 36 Great Manga Missed by the Eisner Awards " , while the artbook Tsubasa ALBuM De <unk> was third in their 2009 poll " Best Manga Book " . In Mania Entertainment 's " Best Manga Awards For 2005 " , Tsubasa was third in the category " Best Shōnen " . It was a nominee for the American Anime Awards in 2007 , but was one of the last series announced due to an error made by the people in charge . 
 Tsubasa : Reservoir Chronicle was fairly well received by reviewers , who described it as a treat for Clamp fans due to the large number of crossover characters in the series . Initial fan response to Tsubasa : Reservoir Chronicle was that it was " Cardcaptor Sakura for guys " . Fans speculated that the series would conclude one of Clamp 's unfinished series , X , or that it would be a sequel to Cardcaptor Sakura that focused on the character Syaoran Li . Critics described the series as being marked by several plot twists , with About.com writer Katherine Luther labelling it as " perhaps the " <unk> " of twists that we have seen in anime and manga in quite some time " . For the earlier half of the series , Mikhail Koulikov from Anime News Network described the series as settling into a " predictable pattern " that Melissa Harper , also from Anime News Network , described as somewhat slow , and " frankly a bit boring " . However , Michael Aronson from Manga Life found the series appealing and accessible to readers who have not read other Clamp series , and he hoped it would remain this accessible for following volumes . He found that the relation between Tsubasa : Reservoir Chronicle and xxxHolic would persuade readers to also read the latter series . Mania Entertainment 's Megan Lavey found the introduction to be a " pretty simple love story " , while liking the characters ' personalities . She liked how the series was connected with xxxHolic and hoped that both series would continue crossing over . In a general overview of the manga , Julie Gray from Comic Book Bin gave positive remarks to the characters ' complex personalities and how the plot has been developed throughout its first ten volumes . She recommended that people should buy the series . Active Anime 's Blake Waymire found that the change of settings was well done , and he noted how some story arcs could go from dramatic to charming . 
 From volume 15 onwards , Clamp unleashed a series of " mind @-@ blowing " plot twists that had been foreshadowed frequently throughout the series . These twists have been described by Anime News Network as " stunning " but confusingly executed due to the sheer number of storylines coming together . Other critics praised the pacing as letting " the story progress at its own natural momentum " , keeping the reader " from being bored by any one literary genre " . The plot twists and the ever @-@ changing relationships between the manga 's main characters were praised ; " few manga creators could pull off this sort of outrageous storytelling stunt " . Active Anime writer Holly Ellingwood called the plot twists as " the most shocking set of events in the Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles to date ! " , finding that despite such twists , more secrets were brought to readers to persuade them to read the following volumes . Ellingwood also reviewed following volumes and found the last plot revelations intriguing ; she enjoyed that a strong connection is revealed between characters from Tsubasa and xxxHolic . Critics have described the artwork as " keeping up the standards expected of Clamp " with its high level of detail , though perhaps too much detail , especially during action sequences . The artstyle is " stylish " and " dynamic " , characterized by a large number of " sweeping lines curlicues that look unlike anything else in the genre " that help bring the action scenes to life for exciting experiences . Ed Sizemore from Comics Worth Reading highlighted the fact that each dimension that the protagonists visit is characterized by its very own look and feel so that " no two worlds are even remotely similar " . However , the amount of detail and lack of contrast , while beautiful , often render scenes incomprehensible to the point where the reader is left guessing who is attacking . Critics have praised Del Rey 's inclusion of English translation notes that aid in understanding the plot , especially due to its crossover nature . Lavey found the translation a " good read " , liking how some Japanese words were not translated and instead explained in notes . 
 = = = Anime reception = = = 
 Critics have described the anime adaptation as having a very slow pace but having a beautiful musical score . Carl Kimlinger from Anime News Network faulted the director , Koichi Mashimo , for " downshifting the plot 's energy " and as having " too many flashbacks , too many slow pans over inexpressive eyes " , that create an end @-@ product that is " tediously formulaic " . Active Anime 's Christopher Seaman had mixed feelings , finding the romantic themes mature and the magical themes appealing to younger audiences ; he concluded that " teens would get the most out of the series . " He recommended the series in general , praising its plot and its themes . DVDTalk 's Todd Douglass Jr. ranked the anime DVD box as " Highly Recommended " ; he liked how , despite borrowing elements from other series , it was " entirely self @-@ contained " . Douglas pointed out that following its second season , the anime kept entertaining viewers , and felt they would not find a reason to dislike it . Douglas enjoyed the anime 's storytelling . He liked its characters , but found it sometimes dragging due to its episodic nature . Kimlinger praised the musical score as being beautiful , as Yuki Kajiura 's work has always been . Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment made similar comments , praising the series ' score and animation , while commenting on the series ' accessibility . He said that people unrelated with Clamp 's works would like Tsubasa , in contrast to other people who would " get out of the series " . Its episodic nature was praised by Luther , who commented how the main plot was connected to each of the story arcs . The English cast for the anime has been labelled as " done and very solid " . IGN 's Jeffrey Harris felt Christopher Sabat was its best actor . Harris called the anime " a nice looking and at times elegant looking show " , pointing to the traits of the main characters . He criticized the lack of extras in the DVDs releases . Reviewing the anime 's and xxxHolic 's films , IGN writer N.S. Davidson said the Tsubasa film would be appealing to viewers of the series , despite its short length . He liked how both films ' storylines interacted , allowing parts of the plot of Tsubasa to be explained in the xxxHolic film , and he found artistic similarities between the two films . Carlo Santos was more critical of the film but still called it " good art " . In a TV Asahi poll , Tsubasa : Reservoir Chronicle was ranked as the fifty @-@ ninth most popular anime in Japan . It ranked ninth in Animage 's Anime Grand Prix anime popularity poll from 2005 , while it was also listed as a " Honorable Mention " in IGN 's " Top Ten Anime of 2007 " feature . 
 Although the Tsubasa OVAs were not the first original animation DVDs ( OADs ) , OVAs published with manga volumes , its release helped to popularize the term . Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment considered the OVAs to have better quality than the TV series , mainly because they were developed by Production I.G instead of Bee Train and because they have a darker storyline . In a further review , Beveridge found fascinating the events occurring in the OVAs due to the number of revelations changed the way people viewed the series . The character designs were felt to be more similar to the manga 's ones than the TV series , while the animation has been considered " a notch above that of standard Television " . The themes were noted to be more mature both brutally and mentally ; although the number of changes presented throughout them has been praised , another series of OVAs that would conclude the storyline built in the last episode from Spring Thunder Chronicles has been requested by reviewers . 
 = Tweed Water Spaniel = 
 The Tweed Water Spaniel , or Tweed Spaniel , is a breed of dog extinct since the 19th century . It is best known for being involved in the early development of the modern Curly Coated Retriever and Golden Retriever breeds of dogs . They were described as a generally brown athletic dogs from the area around Berwick @-@ upon @-@ Tweed near the River Tweed and close to the Scottish Borders . A type of water dog , the breed was not well known outside the local area . This breed may have been created by crossing local water dogs with imported St. John 's water dog , another breed which is also now extinct . 
 = = History = = 
 The village of Norham , Northumberland , just south of the River Tweed was noted as being " long famous " for a breed of water spaniel of which were " invariably brown " . 
 In 1816 , Richard Lawrence wrote of the origins of the Tweed Water Spaniel , " Along rocky shores and dreadful <unk> beyond the junction of the Tweed with the sea of Berwick , water dogs have derived an addition of strength , from the introduction of a cross with the Newfoundland dog , which has rendered them completely adequate to the arduous difficulties and diurnal perils in which they are systematically engaged . " Although the quote refers specifically to the Newfoundland breed , it is actually more likely to mean the now extinct breed of the St. John 's water dog which was sometimes referred to by its homeland 's location of Newfoundland and Labrador . 
 Stanley O 'Neil , an expert in Flat @-@ coated Retrievers , wrote of the Tweed Water Spaniel in a letter during the late 19th century , " Further up the coast , probably <unk> , I saw men netting for salmon . With them was a dog with a wavy or curly coat . It was a tawny colour but , wet and <unk> , it was difficult to see the exact colour , or how much was due to bleach and salt . Whilst my elders discussed the fishing I asked these Northumberland salmon net men whether their dog was a Water @-@ Dog or a Curly , airing my knowledge . They told me he was a Tweed Water Spaniel . This was a new one on me . I had a nasty suspicion my leg was being pulled . This dog looked like a brown Water Dog to me , certainly <unk> , and not at all <unk> . I asked if he came from a trawler , and was told it came from Berwick . " 
 Linda P. Case , of the University of Illinois , speculated the Tweed Water Spaniel was so named because it was developed on the estate of Lord Tweedmouth , and in fact was simply the original name for a breed of dog that later became the Golden Retriever . However , this theory is against the documented evidence , as the early development of the Golden Retriever was fully documented and listed the three Tweed Water Spaniels involved specifically by breed . 
 = = Appearance and temperament = = 
 The Tweed Water Spaniel had a long tail and a curly , liver @-@ colored coat , and looked similar to the Irish Water Spaniel except it had a heavier muzzle and a pointed skull . The dog also had thick , slightly feathered , hound @-@ like ears , droopy lips , and fore legs that were feathered , but hind legs that were not . Their size was that of a small retriever , with a liver @-@ coloured curly coat . Instances of offspring which were liver @-@ coloured but tan below the knees were noted in Hugh Dalziel 's 1897 work British Dogs : Their Varieties , History , Characteristics , Breeding , Management , And Exhibition , although the author speculated this may have been due to Bloodhound ancestry in one of the parents of the litters . 
 The breed was known for its intelligence , courage , and sporting ability .

 Towards the end of the 19th century , Sir Dudley Coutts <unk> , Lord Tweedmouth , was developing a breed which was known at the time as a " yellow Retriever " . This was unusual , as typically during this period all Retrievers were black . The main pairing from which the modern Golden Retrievers are said to have descended were from a dog named Nous that was a rare yellow <unk> @-@ coated Retriever , and a female Tweed Spaniel named Belle that was given to <unk> by his cousin David Robertson . Four yellow puppies were produced from this pairing , named Ada , Crocus , Primrose and Cowslip . 
 Belle was not the only Tweed Spaniel in <unk> 's kennel . A further dog simply named Tweed was kept , although records show he was never bred , as he died at an early age . A second dog named Tweed was bred , to Cowslip from the previous Tweed / Retriever pairing which produced a further yellow puppy named Topsy . The two breeds were only crossbred two or three times , but began the development of the modern Golden Retriever .

 During the formation of the modern breed known as the Curly @-@ coated Retriever , several breeds were used to bring their characteristics into this new breed .

The Curly @-@ coated Retriever has been considered purebred since the early 20th century . 
 = Linton Park = 
 Linton Park , formerly Linton Place or Linton Hall , is a large 18th @-@ century country house in Linton , Kent , England . Built by Robert Mann in 1730 to replace an earlier building , the house and estate passed through the ownership of several members of Mann 's family before coming into the Cornwallis family . The house was enlarged to its current size in 1825 . 
 The house sits in a prominent location , part way down a south @-@ facing slope which provides excellent views of the grounds and the Weald beyond . Gardens close to the house contain formal walks laid out in 1825 with specimen trees planted then and later . 
 The house is a Grade I listed building and the garden and park is listed Grade II * . Other buildings and structures in the park are also listed . 
 Linton Park is now the corporate headquarters of Camellia plc , an international agricultural company . 
 = = History = = 
 From the late 14th century , a house by the name of Capell 's Court stood on the site of Linton Park . It took its name from a family of local landowners named de Capell who held the property from the late 14th century to the mid @-@ 15th century . It was then sold to the <unk> family who held it until the late 16th century , when it was sold to Sir Anthony <unk> . <unk> 's grandson sold the estate to the judge Sir Francis <unk> . <unk> 's daughter , Catherine , inherited the estate and , following her second marriage to Brigadier @-@ General Sir George Jocelyn , the estate was sold to London merchant Sir Robert Mann . 
 Around 1730 , Mann demolished Capell 's Court and built the first part of the present house . On his death in 1751 , the house passed to his son Edward Mann . Edward Mann died in 1775 without children and the house passed to his brother the diplomat Sir Horace Mann . Sir Horace had taken the name of the estate as his territorial designation when made a baronet in 1755 , but was permanently resident in Florence . Sir Horace Mann was a friend and long @-@ time correspondent of Horace Walpole . After a visit to Edward Mann at Linton Park in 1757 , Walpole wrote to Sir Horace in Florence that : " the house is fine and stands like the citadel of Kent ; the whole county is its garden . " On the death of Sir Horace in 1786 , the baronetcy and the house passed to his nephew , Sir Horatio Mann MP , of Boughton Place in nearby Boughton Malherbe . 
 Sir Horatio died in 1814 and the house was inherited by James Cornwallis , Bishop of Lichfield , who was the widowed husband of Mann 's older sister , Catherine . Cornwallis became the fourth Earl Cornwallis on the death of his nephew Charles Cornwallis , 2nd Marquess Cornwallis in 1823 , but died himself in 1824 . The estate passed to his son James , the fifth Earl . On the fifth Earl 's death in 1852 , the property was inherited by his daughter Julia . In 1862 , she married William Amherst , Viscount Holmesdale ( later , after her death in 1883 , the third Earl Amherst ) . 
 By 1888 , the estate was in the possession of Fiennes Stanley Wykeham Cornwallis MP ( created 1st Baron Cornwallis in 1927 ) , grandson of the fifth Earl Cornwallis 's other daughter Jemima Isabella Mann . He owned the house until his death in 1935 . His first son , Captain Fiennes Wykeham Mann Cornwallis MC , was killed in an IRA ambush near Gort , Galway in 1921 , and so the first baron was succeeded by his second son , Wykeham Stanley Cornwallis . The second baron sold the house in 1937 and it became the property of Olaf Hambro , a member of the Hambro banking family . Following the death of Hambro in 1961 , the house was sold to the <unk> family . The house and its nearest surrounding land were sold to the Freemasons in 1974 and were briefly operated as a school before passing into corporate ownership . 
 = = Buildings = = 
 Robert Mann 's original 1730s house was a two @-@ storey brick building seven bays wide with a break front . This was extended for the fifth Earl Cornwallis in 1825 by Thomas and William Cubitt . The Cubitts ' alterations included adding a third storey to the original house and building two @-@ storey wings four bays wide on each side . The house was also refinished with stucco render . Its hipped roof is covered with slates . 
 The entrance to the house is on the north side through a single storey portico . The north façade features tall sash windows on the ground and first floors of 12 panes ; the second floor windows to the central section are shorter and of nine <unk> moulded stucco cornices run above the ground and first floor windows . The east and west façades are five bays wide with a two @-@ storey projecting bay on the east end and a single @-@ storey projecting bay on the west end . 
 Due to the slope of the site , the south façade , which overlooks the main part of the grounds , stands on a raised and terraced platform with the ground floor raised to first floor level and the basement becoming the ground floor . Above the terrace , the façade has the same general arrangement as the north façade , but the wings project slightly past the central section , which has a two @-@ storey pedimented portico . Each wing previously had a single @-@ storey bay at its centre but these have been removed . 
 Internally , a number of rooms feature period wall and ceiling decorations including the entrance hall , which dates from the original 1730s building and features moulded panelling and cornices , a marble fireplace and ornamental plaster ceiling and an arabesque frieze . The stairwell is lit from above with a roof light and features a cantilevered stair with iron balusters from the 1825 adaptation with a later brass handrail . 
 To the north @-@ east of the house is the estate 's former stable building . This was built around the time of the fifth Earl 's extension of the house and is aligned on a north @-@ south axis . The building comprises three three @-@ storey gable @-@ fronted pavilions separated by a pair of two @-@ storey wings . The façades are of brick , with the west façade painted white and the east unpainted . The roof is of slate with a clock tower in the centre of the east side of the central pavilion . Close to the stables is an underground brick @-@ built ice house accessed by a vaulted tunnel . The ice house dates from 1788 . 
 The main house is a Grade I listed building and the stables and the ice house are listed Grade II .

 Approached across parkland along a tree @-@ lined drive from a lodge to the north , the house sits in a landscape of approximately 132 hectares ( 330 acres ) of parkland , woodland and farmland part way down a south facing greensand slope overlooking the valley of the River <unk> . Although now simplified without the intensive planting used in earlier centuries , elements remain of the formal gardens designed by John Claudius Loudon in 1825 that were previously arranged on the north , south @-@ east , south and west sides of the house . 
 Immediately to the south of the house is a wide 100 @-@ metre ( 330 ft ) long terrace with a stone balustrade . From the centre of this , aligned with the central portico of the house , stone steps descend in three flights over grass covered terraces to an oval lawn around the perimeter of which runs a gravel path and from which paths run to the east and west . In the centre of the lawn is a sundial . A wide lawn to the south @-@ east of the house is ringed by paths and divided by another on a north @-@ south access . This is interrupted by flights of steps and a fountain pond . Two small temples are positioned amongst trees part way down the slope . 
 To the west of the house Loudon laid out a flower garden . Later in the 1860s this was replanted with roses , but it is now lawns . At the south end of a walkway through this section of the garden is a water and rock garden known as " Jacobs Well " . From the north end of the walk an avenue of giant sequoias planted in 1864 runs north @-@ west towards the parish church of St Nicholas . Other Giant Sequoia are planted around the gardens . Close to the church , at the end of a paved walk is a small Gothic folly designed by Richard Bentley . South of the avenue is a grass amphitheatre cut into the slope . The southern perimeter of the formal garden is formed by a Ha @-@ Ha . To the south , beyond the formal gardens , the steepness of the slope reduces and the estate continues as open parkland with a tree @-@ fringed lake about 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) south of the house . 
 The gardens and parkland are listed Grade II * , with a number of features in the garden also individually listed for their group value with the house and park . The north lodge , the steps to the south of the house , the sundial on the oval lawn and the folly are all listed Grade II . 
 The estate is private property and is not open to the public , but the Greensand Way long distance walk crosses the parkland east @-@ west to the north of the house and a public footpath crosses the southern parkland close to the lake on a similar alignment .

Jonathan Takiff , writing for The Philadelphia Daily News , said that " [ l ] <unk> to her trill through ' Silent Night , ' the calypso @-@ flavored ' Mary 's Boy Child ' and ' Rockin ' Around the Christmas Tree ' might inspire your kids . " He gave the album a B- . David Burger , writing for The Salt Lake Tribune , gave the album a B , and praised Talbot 's range , saying that there were " sweet , playful and jazzy arrangements " . Reviewers also praised the link with the Toys for Tots Foundation , which Tse considered " one more reason why you should grab a copy . " 
 While Tse described Talbot 's voice as " sweet " and " beautiful " , and Takiff called her " a freak of nature , with a grown @-@ up singing voice in the body of a ( just @-@ turned ) 9 @-@ year @-@ old " , other reviewers were more critical . Jon Bream , of the Minneapolis Star Tribune , called the album " more cloying than cute " , and David <unk> , writing for The Blade , described Talbot 's performance as " little more than a novelty act because of the overly sappy backdrop " . <unk> did praise Talbot for her " impressive vocal skills " , but considered her " earnestness [ as ] wasted on arrangements that sound as if they were ripped from a 1930s Shirley Temple songbook " . Wayne Bledsoe , writing for <unk> , said that Talbot " has a great voice for a kid " , but added that " this album wore me out . Maybe it 's the never @-@ ending vibrato . "

 = President Truman 's relief of General Douglas MacArthur = 
 On 11 April 1951 , U.S. President Harry S. Truman relieved General of the Army Douglas MacArthur of his commands after MacArthur made public statements which contradicted the administration 's policies . MacArthur was a popular hero of World War II who was then the commander of United Nations forces fighting in the Korean War , and his relief remains a controversial topic in the field of civil @-@ military relations . 
 MacArthur led the Allied forces in the Southwest Pacific during World War II , and after the war was in charge of the occupation of Japan . When North Korea invaded South Korea in June 1950 , starting the Korean War , he was designated commander of the United Nations forces defending South Korea . He conceived and executed the amphibious assault at Inchon on 15 September 1950 , for which he was hailed as a military genius . However , when he followed up his victory with a full @-@ scale invasion of North Korea on Truman 's orders , China intervened in the war and inflicted a series of defeats , compelling him to withdraw from North Korea . By April 1951 , the military situation had stabilized , but MacArthur 's public statements became increasingly irritating to Truman , and he relieved MacArthur of his commands . The Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a joint inquiry into the military situation and the circumstances surrounding MacArthur 's relief , and concluded that " the removal of General MacArthur was within the constitutional powers of the President but the circumstances were a shock to national pride . " 
 An apolitical military was an American tradition , but one that was difficult to uphold in an era when American forces were employed overseas in large numbers . The principle of civilian control of the military was also ingrained , but the rising complexity of military technology led to the creation of a professional military . This made civilian control increasingly problematic when coupled with the constitutional division of powers between the President as commander @-@ in @-@ chief , and the Congress with its power to raise armies , maintain a navy , and wage wars . In relieving MacArthur for failing to " respect the authority of the President " by privately communicating with Congress , Truman upheld the President 's role as pre @-@ eminent . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Harry Truman = = = 
 Harry S. Truman became President of the United States on the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945 , and won an unexpected victory in the 1948 presidential election . He was the only president who served after 1897 without a college degree . Although not highly educated , Truman was well read . When his high school friends went off to the state university in 1901 , he enrolled in a local business school , but only lasted a semester . He later took night courses at the Kansas City Law School , but dropped out . Truman attempted to gain admission to the United States Military Academy at West Point , but was rejected for his poor eyesight . He was proud of his military service in the artillery during World War I , and held a reserve commission as a colonel . 
 Truman distrusted regular soldiers and selected two National Guardsmen , Harry H. Vaughan and Louis H. <unk> , as his military aides . Truman once remarked that he did not understand how the US Army could " produce men such as Robert E. Lee , John J. Pershing , Eisenhower and Bradley and at the same time produce <unk> , Pattons and MacArthur . " 
 During the 1948 Revolt of the Admirals , a number of naval officers publicly disagreed with the administration 's policy over cuts to naval aviation and amphibious warfare capability , resulting in the relief of the Chief of Naval Operations , Admiral Louis Denfeld , and his replacement by Admiral Forrest Sherman . In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee investigation into the affair in October 1949 , the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , General Omar Bradley , doubted that there would ever be another large scale amphibious operation . 
 = = = Douglas MacArthur = = = 
 In stature and seniority , General of the Army Douglas MacArthur was the Army 's foremost general . The son of Lieutenant General Arthur MacArthur , Jr . , a recipient of the Medal of Honor for action during the American Civil War , he had graduated at the top of his West Point class of 1903 , but never attended an advanced service school except for the engineer course in 1908 . He had a distinguished combat record in World War I , and had served as Chief of Staff of the United States Army from 1930 to 1935 , working closely with Presidents Herbert Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt , despite occasional clashes over the military budget . He would later compare Roosevelt 's " extraordinary self @-@ control " with Truman 's " violent temper and paroxysms of ungovernable rage " . 
 Apart from his World War I @-@ era service in Mexico and Europe , his overseas postings had been in Asia and the Pacific . During World War II , he had become a national hero and had been awarded the Medal of Honor for the unsuccessful defense of the Philippines in the Battle of Bataan . He had commanded the Allied armies in the New Guinea Campaign and Philippines Campaign , fulfilling his famous promise to return to the Philippines . In 1944 and 1948 , he had been considered a possible Republican candidate for president . After the war , as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers ( SCAP ) , he had overseen the Occupation of Japan and played an important part in the post @-@ war political and social transformation of that country . 
 By 1950 , the occupation of Japan was winding down , but MacArthur remained in the country as Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief Far East ( <unk> ) , a post to which he had been appointed by Truman in 1945 . MacArthur had to deal with deep cuts in the defense budget that had seen his troop numbers decline from 300 @,@ 000 in 1947 to 142 @,@ 000 in 1948 . Despite his protests , further reductions had followed and , by June 1950 , there were only 108 @,@ 000 troops in his Far East Command . Cuts in funds and personnel produced shortages of serviceable equipment . Of the Far East Command 's 18 @,@ 000 jeeps , 10 @,@ 000 were unserviceable ; of its 113 @,@ 870 2 ½ -ton 6x6 trucks , only 4 @,@ 441 were serviceable . On the positive side , the Far East Command initiated a program of reclaiming and refurbishing war materiel from abandoned stocks throughout the Pacific . This had not only recovered a great deal of valuable stores and equipment , it had also generated a useful repair and rebuilding industry in Japan . Meanwhile , the shift away from occupation duties had permitted a greater focus on training for combat .

 = = = Korean War = = = 
 North Korea invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950 , starting the Korean War . In response to an urgent request from the Korean Military Advisory Group for more ammunition , MacArthur , on his own initiative , ordered the transport ship <unk> Sgt. George D Keathley , then in harbor in Yokohama , to be loaded with ammunition and to sail for Pusan . President Truman met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other advisors that day at Blair House and approved the actions already taken by MacArthur and Secretary of State Dean Acheson . At another meeting at Blair House held on the evening of 26 June , amid reports of a rapidly deteriorating situation in South Korea , Truman approved the use of air and naval forces against military targets south of the 38th parallel north . 
 Subsequently , on 27 June , the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 83 , which recommended that " members of the United Nations furnish such assistance to the Republic of Korea as may be necessary to repel the armed attack and to restore international peace and security in the area . " The South Korean capital of Seoul fell on 28 June . The next day , Truman authorized air and naval operations north of the 38th parallel , which MacArthur had already ordered . However it was not until 30 June , following a sobering report on the military situation from MacArthur , that Truman finally authorized the use of ground forces . 
 On 8 July , on the advice on the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Truman appointed MacArthur as commander of the United Nations Command in South Korea ( <unk> ) . He remained <unk> and SCAP . MacArthur was forced to commit his forces in Japan to what he later described as a " desperate rearguard action . " In July Truman sent the Chief of Staff of the Army , General J. Lawton Collins , and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force , General Hoyt S. Vandenberg , to report on the situation . They met with MacArthur and his chief of staff , Major General Edward Almond , in Tokyo on 13 July . MacArthur impressed on them the danger of underestimating the North Koreans , whom he characterized as " well @-@ equipped , well @-@ led , and battle @-@ trained , and which have at times out @-@ numbered our troops by as much as twenty to one . " He proposed to first halt the North Korean advance and then counterattack , enveloping the North Koreans with an amphibious operation , but the timing was dependent on the arrival of reinforcements from the United States . 
 At a press conference on 13 July , Truman was asked if United States forces would cross the 38th parallel into North Korea , and he replied that he would " make that decision when it becomes necessary to do it . " Some of his advisors , most notably the Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs , Dean Rusk , and the Director of the Office of Northeast Asian Affairs , John M. Allison , argued that Security Council Resolution 83 provided a legal basis for the invasion of North Korea . Others , notably George F. Kennan and Paul Nitze , disagreed . In addition to the legality , the administration also had to consider the danger of intervention by the Soviet Union or the People 's Republic of China if United Nations forces approached their borders . 
 = = = Battle of Inchon = = = 
 MacArthur 's early ambitions for an amphibious operation against North Korea had to be shelved due to the deteriorating situation in the south , which compelled him to commit the formation earmarked for the assault , the 1st Cavalry Division , to the defence of the Pusan Perimeter , to which the Eighth Army retreated in August . MacArthur then resumed his planning for an amphibious operation , which he tentatively scheduled for 15 September 1950 . Navy and Marine Corps officers like Rear Admiral James H. Doyle , the commander of Amphibious Group One , and Major General Oliver P. Smith , the commander of the 1st Marine Division , were appalled by the proposed landing beaches at Inchon , which featured huge tides , broad mudflats , narrow and treacherous channels , and high seawalls . Omar Bradley called it " the worst possible place ever selected for an amphibious landing . " While the Inchon @-@ Seoul area was a key communications center , the risks of the landing were daunting . Collins and Sherman flew to Tokyo to be briefed on the plans by MacArthur , who declared : " We shall land at Inchon , and I shall crush them . " 
 MacArthur was invited to speak at the 51st National Encampment of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Chicago on 26 August 1950 . He declined the invitation , but instead sent a statement that could be read out aloud , in which he contradicted Truman 's policy towards the island of Formosa , saying : " Nothing could be more fallacious than the threadbare argument by those who advocate appeasement and defeatism in the Pacific that if we defend Formosa we alienate continental Asia . " Truman was infuriated by the word " appeasement , " and discussed the possibility of relieving MacArthur with Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson . Johnson responded that MacArthur was " one of the greatest , if not the greatest generals of our generation . " Truman told Johnson to send MacArthur an order withdrawing his statement , which he did ; but it had already been read into Congressional Record . As it turned out , it was not MacArthur who was relieved , but Johnson . Truman had become irritated with Johnson 's conflict with Secretary of State Acheson , and although he had said that Johnson would remain his Secretary of Defense for " as long as I am President , " he asked Johnson for his resignation . Publicly , Johnson received much of the blame for the defense cuts that had led to the lack of preparedness and consequent early defeats in Korea . He was replaced by General of the Army George Marshall . 
 MacArthur held that his military objective was the destruction of the North Korean Army . That being the case , operations would be necessary north of the 38th parallel , although his Assistant Chief of Staff , G @-@ 2 , Major General Charles A. Willoughby , warned on 31 August that 37 Chinese divisions were grouping on the border between China and North Korea . The Joint Chiefs agreed with MacArthur on this issue . A National Security Council paper endorsed the legality of action north of the 38th parallel . The paper recommended that only South Korean troops be employed in the border regions with China and Russia . Should the Soviet Union intervene , MacArthur was to immediately retreat to the 38th parallel ; but in the case of Chinese intervention , he was to keep fighting " as long as action by UN military forces offers a reasonable chance of successful resistance . " Truman endorsed the report on 11 September , but MacArthur remained in the dark because of the changeover of Secretaries of Defense , and was not informed until 22 September . When Truman was asked at a press conference on 21 September whether he had concluded to conduct operations in North Korea , he replied that he had not . 
 In the meantime , MacArthur 's amphibious assault at Inchon went ahead on 15 September . " The success of Inchon was so great and the subsequent prestige of General MacArthur was so overpowering , " Collins later recalled , " that the Chiefs hesitated thereafter to question later plans and decisions of the general , which should have been challenged . " In response to a rumor that the Eighth Army planned to halt at the 38th parallel and await United Nations authorization to cross , Marshall sent a message to MacArthur informing him that : " We want you to feel unhampered tactically and strategically to proceed north of 38th parallel . Announcement above referred to may precipitate embarrassment in the UN where evident desire is not to be confronted with necessity of a vote on passage , rather to find you have found it militarily necessary to do so . " A few days later , MacArthur was instructed not to issue an announcement that his forces had crossed the 38th parallel . On 7 October a United Nations General Assembly Resolution was passed that could be broadly construed as permitting the invasion of North Korea . 
 = = = Wake Island Conference = = = 
 With the 1950 mid @-@ term elections drawing near , and Truman abstaining from overt campaigning while the troops were fighting in Korea , members of Truman 's staff , most notably George Elsey , came up with another way to garner votes for the Democratic Party . In July 1944 , President Franklin Roosevelt had traveled to Hawaii to meet with MacArthur and Admiral Chester Nimitz . At this meeting , Roosevelt made the decision to attack the Philippines in the final year of the Pacific war . It was a political triumph in an election year , refuting Republican claims that Roosevelt fixated on Europe at the expense of the Pacific . 
 Truman emulated this by flying to the Pacific to meet MacArthur . Initially , Truman was unenthusiastic about the idea , as he disliked publicity stunts , but in October 1950 , in the wake of the victories at Pusan and Inchon , MacArthur 's star was burning bright . By meeting with him , Truman could emphasize his own part in the victories , as Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief . A message was sent to MacArthur suggesting a meeting on Hawaii or Wake Island . MacArthur replied that he " would be delighted to meet the President on the morning of the 15th at Wake Island . " When MacArthur discovered that the President would be bringing the news media with him , MacArthur asked if he could bring correspondents from Tokyo . His request was denied . 
 Truman arrived at Wake Island on 15 October , where he was greeted on the tarmac by MacArthur , who had arrived the day before . MacArthur shook hands with the President rather than salute , which Bradley considered " insulting . " This did not bother Truman ; what did annoy the President , a former haberdasher , was MacArthur 's " greasy ham and eggs cap that evidently had been in use for twenty years . " The meeting , which had no agenda and no structure , took the form of a free @-@ wheeling discussion between the President and his advisors on one hand , and MacArthur and the CINCPAC , Admiral Arthur Radford , on the other . Topics discussed included Formosa , the Philippines and the wars in Vietnam and Korea . MacArthur noted that " No new policies , no new strategy of war or international politics , were proposed or discussed . " Robert Sherrod , who was present as a correspondent felt that he " had witnessed nothing but a political grandstand play . " 
 However , MacArthur did say things that would later be used against him . When asked by the President about the odds of Soviet or Chinese intervention in Korea , MacArthur replied : 
 Very little . Had they interfered in the first or second months it would have been decisive . We are no longer fearful of their intervention . We no longer stand hat in hand . The Chinese have 300 @,@ 000 men in Manchuria . Of these probably not more than 100 – 115 @,@ 000 are distributed along the Yalu River . Only 50 – 60 @,@ 000 could be gotten across the Yalu River . They have no Air Force . Now that we have bases for our Air Force in Korea if the Chinese tried to get down to Pyongyang there would be the greatest slaughter . 
 MacArthur expressed the hope that the Eighth Army could withdraw to Japan by the end of the year . When Bradley asked if a division could be sent to Europe , MacArthur replied that he could make one available in January . In fact , Chinese troops had already begun crossing the Yalu into North Korea , and by November 180 @,@ 000 had done so . 
 = = = Chinese intervention = = = 
 When he returned from Wake , MacArthur faced the challenge of turning his promises into reality . On 24 October , he ordered his principal subordinates , Lieutenant General Walton Walker , the commander of the Eighth Army , and Major General Edward Almond of X Corps , to " drive forward with all speed and full utilization of all their force . " He also lifted the prohibition on troops other than South Koreans operating along the borders with China and the Soviet Union . Collins considered this a violation of the orders that the Joint Chiefs had issued on 27 September , but MacArthur pointed out that it was only , in the words of the original directive , " a matter of policy . " He added that the matter had been raised at Wake Island , but no one else recalled this , particularly not Truman , who , unaware of these discussions , told reporters on 26 October that Koreans and not Americans would occupy the border areas . Within days , MacArthur 's forces had encountered the Chinese in the Battle of Onjong and the Battle of Unsan . 
 Truman did not relieve MacArthur for the military reverses in Korea in November and December 1950 . Truman later stated that he felt that MacArthur was no more to blame than General of the Army Dwight Eisenhower was for the military reverses he had suffered during the Battle of the Bulge . But this did not mean that it did not factor into his decision . " I considered him a great strategist , " Truman later recalled , " until he made the march into North Korea without the knowledge that he should have had of the Chinese coming in . " 
 In an attempt to slow the Chinese advance , MacArthur ordered the bridges across the Yalu to be bombed . After due consultation with his advisers , Truman declared that he would not approve of such an action , and the Joint Chiefs cancelled the order . When MacArthur protested , the President and the Joint Chiefs authorized the bombings , subject to the caveat that Chinese air space not be violated . Major General Emmett O 'Donnell would later cite this to the Congressional inquiry into MacArthur 's relief as an example of undue political interference in military operations . The Yalu River had many bends , and in some cases there were very restricted lines of approach without overflying the Yalu . This made life easier for the Communist antiaircraft gunners , but correspondingly less so for the aircrew . Within weeks , MacArthur was forced to retreat , and both Truman and MacArthur were forced to contemplate the prospect of abandoning Korea entirely . 
 = = = Nuclear weapons = = = 
 MacArthur did not advocate the use of nuclear weapons to recover the situation . In his testimony before the Senate Inquiry , he said that he had never recommended their use . In 1960 , MacArthur challenged a statement by Truman that he had wanted to use nuclear weapons , and Truman issued a retraction , stating that he had no documentary evidence of this claim ; it was merely his personal opinion . According to Major General Courtney Whitney , MacArthur did at one point consider a plan to use radioactive wastes to seal off North Korea , based upon a 1950 proposal by Louis Johnson , but never submitted this to the Joint Chiefs . In 1985 Richard Nixon recalled discussing the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with MacArthur : 
 MacArthur once spoke to me very eloquently about it , pacing the floor of his apartment in the Waldorf . He thought it a tragedy the bomb was ever exploded . MacArthur believed that the same restrictions ought to apply to atomic weapons as to conventional weapons , that the military objective should always be limited damage to noncombatants ... MacArthur , you see , was a soldier . He believed in using force only against military targets , and that is why the nuclear thing turned him off , which I think speaks well of him . 
 Bradley had proposed to the Joint Chiefs that nuclear weapons be placed at MacArthur 's disposal in July 1950 , but after consideration of the matter , the Joint Chiefs did not adopt the proposal . However , ten B @-@ 29 bombers were deployed to Guam . While Truman publicly denied that he was considering the use of nuclear weapons , he authorised the transfer to Guam of all their components except for the fissile cores . 
 At a press conference on 30 November 1950 , Truman was asked about the use of nuclear weapons : 
 Q. Mr. President , I wonder if we could retrace that reference to the atom bomb ? Did we understand you clearly that the use of the atomic bomb is under active consideration ? 
 Truman : Always has been . It is one of our weapons . 
 Q. Does that mean , Mr. President , use against military objectives , or civilian — 
 Truman : It 's a matter that the military people will have to decide . I 'm not a military authority that passes on those things . 
 Q. Mr. President , perhaps it would be better if we are allowed to quote your remarks on that directly ? 
 Truman : I don 't think — I don 't think that is necessary . 
 Q. Mr. President , you said this depends on United Nations action . Does that mean that we wouldn 't use the atomic bomb except on a United Nations authorization ? 
 Truman : No , it doesn 't mean that at all . The action against Communist China depends on the action of the United Nations . The military commander in the field will have charge of the use of the weapons , as he always has .
