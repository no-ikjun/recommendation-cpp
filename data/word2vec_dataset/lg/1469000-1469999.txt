 = = Battle = = 
 Having begun to push back the feeble French forces from Marmont 's VI 's Corps the day before , Blücher occupied Champaubert early on 14 February , sending his vanguard forward , as far as the village of Fromentières and then Vauchamps . Marmont , commanding only the Lagrange division and 800 men from the Ricard division , had cautiously pulled his men back towards Montmirail , where he began to receive reinforcements . Towards 9 o 'clock in the morning , Blücher set Zieten 's brigade and some cavalry in motion from Vauchamps towards Montmirail . To their surprise , Marmont 's men didn 't give ground this time and vigorously counterattacked , pushing Zieten 's advance guard back into the village of Vauchamps . The accompanying Prussian cavalry was dispersed by a violent French cannonade . With now both brigades of Ricard 's division available , Marmont launched these men against the Prussian position at Vauchamps , with the 1st brigade on his right , advancing under the cover of the Beaumont forest , south of the Montmirail @-@ Vauchamps road and the 2nd brigade on his left , north of the road , advancing frontally towards the position . Marmont also had with him his own escort cavalry squadron and four élite Imperial Guard duty squadrons from the Emperor 's own escort , under general Lion . Marmont 's leftmost brigade entered Vauchamps , but , with the village heavily invested with Zieten 's Prussian defenders , the Frenchmen were soon repulsed , with the Prussians in pursuit . Marshal Marmont then launched his five squadrons to the rescue and the cavalry promptly forced the Prussians back to the village , with one of their battalions taken prisoner , after taking refuge in an isolated farm . 
 Zieten then decided to pull back his forces towards the village of Fromentières . There , Zieten was joined by Generals Kleist and <unk> , who , having heard the sound of the guns , had begun to move their respective Army Corps in that direction , coming from Champaubert . The French also moved forward , with Marmont 's two divisions ( Lagrange and Ricard ) in pursuit of Zieten , along the road to Fromentières . Marmont was now supported on his left by General Grouchy , who had just arrived on the field of battle with the divisions of Saint @-@ Germain and Doumerc , moving past the village of <unk> , in order to cut off Zieten 's retreat . Further French reinforcements were now available , this time on Marmont 's right : the division of Leval , who had been steadily moving up the valley of the Petit Morin river , in a bid to outflank the Prussians . With the French Imperial Guard artillery now also deployed and firing at them , Zieten 's Prussians drew back in good order , and formed in squares to fend off Grouchy 's cavalry . Towards 2 o 'clock in the afternoon , after assessing the situation , Blücher realised that he was facing Napoleon himself and thus decided to immediately withdraw . He ordered all of his forces to retreat through Champaubert and directed a part of his artillery to safety , towards Étoges . 
 = = Pursuit = = 
 With the Coalition forces now in full retreat , Marmont received orders to aggressively pursue the enemy , knowing that he could count on his two infantry divisions , plus that of Leval , as well as on the support of General Drouot 's Guard artillery , on Nansouty 's Guard cavalry on his right and on Grouchy 's two cavalry divisions on his left . Following Marmont at a short distance were further reinforcements , two Guard infantry divisions ( Friant and <unk> ) under the command of Marshal Ney and with them was Napoleon himself . Napoleon was followed by an additional " Young Guard " division , under General Meunier , which the Emperor had taken with him when he left Château @-@ Thierry early that morning . 
 The French cavalry had been hindered in its movements by the broken terrain and thus far unable to really bother Zieten 's infantry squares . Consequently , Blücher was able to lead an exemplary retreat up to Fromentières and <unk> . However , once past these villages , the terrain became flat and even , proper for cavalry action , and now , with the increasingly aggressive action of the enemy cavalry against his flank and rear , Zieten and his brigade became increasingly isolated . Grouchy , with the divisions of Doumerc and Saint @-@ Germain was now boldly menacing Zieten 's right , while on his left , the Prussian general saw Nansouty 's Guard cavalry ( Laferrière @-@ Levesque 's division , plus the four service squadrons , under Lefebvre @-@ Desnouettes ) . Zieten 's brigade was finally cut off from the rest of the army and charged violently by Grouchy 's cuirassiers , who broke the infantry squares and took no less than 2 @,@ 000 prisoners , with the rest of the brigade routed . 
 Abandoning his position at Fromentières , where Marmont 's infantry had just begun to <unk> , Blücher ordered the continuation of the retreat towards Champaubert and Étoges , with Kleist 's Corps on the left , south of the road and <unk> 's Corps on the right , north of the road . Again taking advantage from the flat terrain , Grouchy was able to advance rapidly and fall onto the rear of the Coalition infantry squares , which were now slowly withdrawing in echelon and efficiently using the terrain to take shelter from the artillery bombardment . With night approaching and their retreat towards Étoges now barred by enemy cavalry , the Prussian squares began to lose cohesion . Spotting this weakness , Grouchy , who had been reinforced by <unk> 's division , energetically launched his three divisions against the Coalition squares , dispersing a number of them , with these men fleeing in disorder to take refuge in the Étoges forest . The old Blücher , who had been bravely exposing himself to great danger in order to boost the morale his men , was almost taken prisoner , together with his Chief of Staff , Gneisenau , Generals Kleist , <unk> and Prince Augustus of Prussia . 
 Only just escaping capture , Blücher crossed the forest of Vertus and took up positions at Étoges with Prince Urusov 's division , which had been left there in reserve . Russian General Udom , with 1 @,@ 800 men and 15 cannon , was instructed to cover the position , by occupying the park at Étoges . Udom 's men were exhausted after the long retreat and fighting and , seeing that night had fallen , thought themselves in safety . However , Doumerc 's cuirassiers , formed unseen in the night , surprised these men and a single charge was enough to send the panicked men fleeing . Prince Urusov , 600 men and eight artillery pieces were captured during this action , with the French sailors ' regiment from Lagrange 's division subsequently entering the village of Étoges . Blücher abandoned this position too and made a hasty retreat towards Vertus and Bergères . He then opted for a speedy night march and the next day he managed to bring his remaining men to Châlons , where he was joined by Yorck 's and Sacken 's corps .

 The battle was actually no more than a very long cavalry pursuit and was a very costly defeat for Blücher 's " Army of Silesia " , which lost as much as 10 @,@ 000 men , during this day . French author Jean @-@ Pierre Mir states that the Prussian Corps of Kleist had 3 @,@ 500 men out of action ( killed , wounded and missing ) , as well as 2 @,@ 000 prisoners . According to this author , the Russian Corps had around 3 @,@ 500 men , killed , wounded or missing and also lost 15 cannons and 10 flags . Historian Alain Pigeard places overall losses of the Army of Silesia throughout this day between 9 @,@ 000 and 10 @,@ 000 men but the detail of these losses seems to suggest lighter casualties . Pigeard speaks of only 1 @,@ 250 men killed , wounded or missing and 2 @,@ 000 prisoners for the Prussians , and of 2 @,@ 000 men lost for the Russians . Since Pigeard asserts that these casualties occurred during the pursuit , it is possible that these figures do not take into account the casualties incurred during the initial actions of this battle ( one battalion of Zieten 's brigade captured , plus the 2 @,@ 000 prisoners taken during Grouchy 's and Nansouty 's joint action against Zieten ) . According to Pigeard , the French registered very light casualties of around 600 men . 
 Military Historian Jacques Garnier , analysing the battle in Jean <unk> 's Dictionnaire Napoléon , notes that only the muddy , sodden ground , hampering an efficient deployment of the French artillery and infantry , prevented a much more emphatic victory . He also notes that after Vauchamps , Napoleon was able to safely turn south and fall upon the " Army of Bohemia " , commanded by Prince of Schwarzenberg . 
 = Two @-@ cent piece ( United States ) = 
 The two @-@ cent piece was produced by the Mint of the United States for circulation from 1864 to 1872 and for collectors in 1873 . Designed by James B. Longacre , there were decreasing mintages each year , as other minor coins such as the nickel proved more popular . It was abolished by the Mint Act of 1873 . 
 The economic turmoil of the American Civil War caused government @-@ issued coins , even the non @-@ silver Indian Head cent , to vanish from circulation , hoarded by the public . One means of filling this gap was private token issues , often made of bronze . The cent at that time was struck of a copper @-@ nickel alloy , the same diameter as the later Lincoln cent , but somewhat thicker . The piece was difficult for the Philadelphia Mint to strike , and Mint officials , as well as the annual Assay Commission , recommended the coin 's replacement . Despite opposition from those wishing to keep the metal nickel in the coinage , led by Pennsylvania Congressman Thaddeus Stevens , Congress passed the Coinage Act of 1864 , authorizing bronze cents and two @-@ cent pieces . 
 Although initially popular in the absence of other federal coinage , the two @-@ cent piece 's place in circulation was usurped by other non @-@ precious metal coins which Congress subsequently authorized , the three @-@ cent piece and the nickel . It was abolished in 1873 ; large quantities were redeemed by the government and melted . Nevertheless , two @-@ cent pieces remain inexpensive by the standards of 19th @-@ century American coinage . 
 = = Inception = = 
 A two @-@ cent piece had been proposed in 1806 by Connecticut Senator Uriah Tracy , along with a twenty @-@ cent piece or " double dime " . Reflecting the then @-@ prevalent view that coins should contain their value in metal , Tracy 's bill provided that the two @-@ cent piece be made of billon , or debased silver . The bill was opposed by Mint Director Robert Patterson , as it would be difficult to refine the silver from melted @-@ down pieces . Although Tracy 's legislation passed the Senate twice , in 1806 and 1807 , it failed in the House of Representatives . Patterson sent a brass button with two of the billon planchets that would have been used for the coin to Tracy , showing how hard it would be to prevent counterfeiting . The Mint considered a two @-@ cent piece in 1836 , and experiments were conducted by Second Engraver Christian Gobrecht and Melter and Refiner Franklin Peale . The piece was to be again of billon , and provision for the coin was included in early drafts of the Mint Act of 1837 , but the proposal was dropped when Peale was able to show that the coin could be easily counterfeited . 
 Until 1857 , the cent coin was a large copper piece , containing about its face value in metal . These coins were unpopular , and in 1857 , after receiving congressional approval , the Mint began issuing the Flying Eagle cent , of the diameter of the later Lincoln cent , but somewhat thicker and made of copper @-@ nickel alloy . These pieces readily circulated , and although the design did not strike well and was replaced by the Indian Head cent in 1859 , the coins were commonly used until all federal coinage vanished from circulation in much of the United States in 1861 and 1862 , during the economic turmoil of the American Civil War . This happened because many Northerners feared that if the war went poorly , paper money and government bonds might become worthless . The gap was filled by , among other things , private token issues , sometimes in copper @-@ nickel approximating the size of the cent , but often thinner pieces in bronze . 
 This fact did not escape government officials , and when , in 1863 , they attempted to restore coins to circulation , the use of bronze coins , which would not contain their face values in metal , was considered . In his annual report submitted October 1 , 1863 , Mint Director James Pollock noted that " whilst people expect a full value in their gold and silver coins , they merely want the inferior [ base metal ] money for convenience in making exact payments " . He observed that the private cent tokens had sometimes contained as little as a fifth of a cent in metal , yet had still circulated . He proposed that the copper @-@ nickel cent be replaced with a bronze piece of the same size . Pollock also wanted to eliminate nickel as a coinage metal ; its hard alloys destroyed dies and machinery . On December 8 , Pollock wrote to Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase , proposing a bronze cent and two @-@ cent piece , and enclosing pattern coins of the two @-@ cent piece that he had had prepared . According to numismatist Neil Carothers , a two @-@ cent piece was most likely proposed in order to get as much dollar value in small change into circulation in as short a time as possible , as the Mint could strike a two @-@ cent piece as easily as a cent . 
 = = Legislation = = 
 On March 2 , 1864 , Pollock wrote urgently to Chase , warning him that the Mint was running out of nickel and that demand for cents was at an all @-@ time high . He also informed the Secretary that the United States Assay Commission , composed of citizens and officials who had met the previous month to test the nation 's silver and gold coinage , had recommended the use of French bronze ( 95 % copper with the remainder tin and zinc ) as a coinage metal for the cent and a new two @-@ cent piece . Three days later , Chase sent Pollock 's December letter and draft legislation for bronze one- and two @-@ cent pieces to Maine Senator William P. Fessenden , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee . Fessenden took no immediate action , and on March 16 , Pollock wrote again to Chase , warning that the Mint was going to run out of nickel , much of which was imported . Chase forwarded his letter to Fessenden . Legislation was finally introduced by New Hampshire Senator Daniel Clark on March 22 ; Pollock 's letters were read and apparently influenced proceedings as the Senate passed the bill without debate . 
 The domestic supply of nickel was at that time produced by a mine at Gap , Pennsylvania , owned by industrialist Joseph Wharton . On March 19 , Pollock wrote to Chase that they had no more nickel , nor was any available from overseas ; " we are thus shut up to the home supply ; from the works of Mr. Wharton " . Opposed to the removal of nickel from the cent , Wharton published a pamphlet in April 1864 proposing coinage of one- , two- , three- , five- , and ten @-@ cent pieces of an alloy of one part nickel to three of copper , doubling the percentage of nickel used in the cent . Despite Wharton 's efforts , on April 20 , a select committee of the House of Representatives endorsed the bill . It was opposed by Pennsylvania 's Thaddeus Stevens , who represented the mining area from which Wharton extracted his nickel . Wharton had spent $ 200 @,@ 000 to develop his mine and ore refinement machinery , Stevens related , and it was unfair to deprive him of the major use of his metal . " Shall we destroy all this property because by coining with another metal more money may be saved to the government ? " Besides , he argued , the copper @-@ nickel alloy for the cent had been approved by Congress , and the new metal , which he termed " brass " , would show rust . He was rebutted by Iowa Congressman John A. Kasson , chairman of the House Committee on Coinage , Weights , and Measures , who stated that the bronze alloy did not resemble brass , and he could not support the proposition that the government is bound to purchase from a supplier because he has spent money in anticipation of sales . 
 The legislation passed the House , and the Coinage Act of 1864 was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on April 22 , 1864 . The legislation made base metal coins legal tender for the first time : both cents and two @-@ cent pieces were acceptable in quantities of up to ten . The government would not , however , redeem them in bulk . The act also outlawed the private one- and two @-@ cent tokens , and later that year Congress abolished all such issues . The legislation did not allow for the redemption of the old copper @-@ nickel cents ; it had been drafted by Pollock , who was hoping that the seignorage income from issuing the new coins would help finance Mint operations , and he did not want it reduced by the recall of the old pieces . Wharton and his interests were appeased by the passage of a bill for a three @-@ cent piece in 1865 and a five @-@ cent piece in 1866 , both of his proposed alloy , out of which the " nickel " , as the latter coin has come to be known , is still struck . 
 = = Design = = 
 In late 1861 , the Reverend Mark R. Watkinson of <unk> , Pennsylvania , had written to Chase , proposing that some reference to God be placed on the coinage in that time of war , and on November 20 of that year , Chase wrote to Mint Director Pollock , " You will cause a device to be prepared without unnecessary delay with a motto expressing in the fewest <unk> terms possible this national recognition . " Several mottos were considered by Pollock , including " God Our Trust " and " God and Our Country " . Some of the patterns he sent Chase in December 1863 used " God Our Trust " , and he wrote of the design , " the devices are beautiful and appropriate , and the motto on each such , as all who fear God and love their country , will approve . " He also sent pattern coins depicting George Washington ; Chase responded to the letter , " I approve your mottoes , only suggesting that on that with the Washington obverse the motto should begin with the word OUR , so as to read OUR GOD AND OUR COUNTRY . And on that with the shield , it should be changed so as to read : IN GOD WE TRUST . " Pollock had been inspired by " The Star Spangled Banner " , a later stanza of which includes the line , " And this be our motto , ' In God Is Our Trust ' " . Chase may have been influenced in his decision by the motto of his alma mater , Brown University , In Deo <unk> ( In God We Hope ) . 
 As the mottos to be placed on coinage were prescribed by the 1837 act , a legislative change was needed . The act which created the two @-@ cent piece authorized the Mint Director , with the Secretary of the Treasury 's approval , to prescribe the designs and mottos to be used . Longacre 's two @-@ cent piece was the first coin inscribed with " In God We Trust " . The motto was popularized by the new coin ; on March 3 , 1865 Congress passed legislation ordering its use on all coins large enough to permit it . Since 1938 , " In God We Trust " has been used on all American coins . 
 The obverse design is a Longacre version of the Great Seal of the United States . His design focuses on the shield , or escutcheon , as a defensive weapon , signifying strength and self @-@ protection through unity . The upper part of the shield , or " chief " , symbolizes Congress , while the 13 vertical stripes , or " paleways " , represent the states ; consequently the entire escutcheon symbolizes the strength of the federal government through the unity of the states . The crossed arrows represent nonaggression , but imply readiness against attack . The laurel branches , taken from Greek tradition , symbolize victory . In heraldic engraving , vertical lines represent red , clear areas white and horizontal lines blue , thus the escutcheon is colored red , white and blue and is meant to evoke the American flag . The reverse contains the denomination " 2 cents " with a somewhat ornate wheat wreath . The rest of the coin is filled with the name of the country . 
 Art historian Cornelius Vermeule deemed the two @-@ cent piece " the most Gothic and the most expressive of the Civil War " of all American coins . " The shield , arrows , and wreath of the obverse need only flanking cannon to be the consummate expression of Civil War heraldry . " Vermeule suggested that the coin appears calligraphic , rather than sculptural , and ascribed this to Longacre 's early career as a plate engraver . 
 = = Production and collecting = = 
 A few thousand of the first circulation strikes , as well as a handful of proof coins , came from a prototype die with smaller letters in the motto than all other 1864 pieces . Although specimens of the two @-@ cent piece , being of base metal , were not set aside for testing by the annual Assay Commission , Congress did order that internal checks be done at the Mint as to their composition and weight . 
 The two @-@ cent piece was at first a success , circulating freely once enough of them were issued to be recognized by the public . It initially circulated because of the wartime coin shortage , which was alleviated by the new cent and two @-@ cent piece . Although Pollock reported hoarding of cents in his June 1864 report , he did not thereafter mention such activities . Silver coins still did not circulate in much of the nation , and the new coins ( joined by the three- and five @-@ cent pieces of copper @-@ nickel , first struck in 1865 and 1866 respectively ) answered the need for small change . In October 1864 , he reported that the demand for both coins had been unprecedented and that every effort was being made to increase production ; in his report the next June , he called the two @-@ cent piece " a most convenient and popular coin " . The Act of March 3 , 1865 , that provided for the three @-@ cent nickel piece , reduced the legal tender limit of the bronze coins to four cents , while making the newly authorized coin acceptable up to sixty cents . 
 After the large mintage of just under twenty million in the first year , according to numismatist Q. David Bowers , " enthusiasm and public acceptance waned " . After the war , bank demand for the denomination dropped , while demand for the new five @-@ cent nickel increased ; mintages of the two @-@ cent piece were smaller every year . Lange notes , " it was evident by the end of the 1860s that its coinage was no longer necessary " . According to Carothers , " the coinage of a 2 cent piece was unnecessary . While it was popular at first because of the great public demand for metallic small change , it was a superfluous denomination , and its circulation waned rapidly after the 5 cent nickel coin was introduced . " 
 Beginning in 1867 , the new Mint Director , Henry Linderman , ( Pollock had resigned ) began to advocate for Congress to authorize redemption of surplus copper and bronze coinage . Although the nickel could be redeemed in lots ( permission granted in its authorizing act ) , there was no provision for the government to buy back the smaller coins , and with more being issued every year , there were too many small @-@ value coins . Treasury officials insisted the government could not accept the pieces beyond their legal tender limits , even if what was being done was exchanging them for other currency . Under Linderman , the Mint , without any legal authority , purchased $ 360 @,@ 000 in bronze coins using three @-@ cent pieces and nickels . Still , millions of two @-@ cent pieces accumulated in the hands of newspaper and transit companies , postmasters , and others who took small payments from the public , and there were complaints to Congress . With the advent of the Grant administration , Pollock returned to office and opposed the redemption proposals . Although he included Pollock 's opinions as part of his annual report , Treasury Secretary George S. Boutwell asked Congress to pass a redemption act , and it did so on March 3 , 1871 , allowing for the redemption of minor coinage in lots of not less than $ 20 . It also allowed the Treasury Secretary to discontinue the coinage of any piece redeemed in large numbers . Pursuant to the new law , the Mint in 1871 and 1872 redeemed over 37 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 small coins , including two @-@ cent pieces . 
 In the postwar years , Congress and the Treasury considered a revision of the coinage laws , as the act of 1837 was deemed outdated . Retention of the two @-@ cent piece was never seriously considered in the debates over what became the Mint Act of 1873 ; the only question concerning the minor coinage was whether to make the cent from bronze or copper @-@ nickel , and how large to make the three @-@ cent nickel . With those pieces remaining unchanged , the bill passed on February 12 , 1873 , putting an end to the two @-@ cent piece series . 
 With the two @-@ cent piece likely to be abolished , only 65 @,@ 000 were struck for circulation in 1872 ; it is unclear why they were struck at all . On January 18 , 1873 , Philadelphia Mint Chief Coiner Archibald Loudon Snowden complained that the " 3 " in the date , as struck by the Mint , too closely resembled an " 8 " , especially on the smaller @-@ sized denominations . In response , Pollock ordered the new chief engraver , William Barber ( Longacre had died in 1869 ) , to re @-@ engrave the date , opening the arms of the " 3 " wider on most denominations . The two @-@ cent piece was struck only in proof condition in 1873 , and due to its February abolition , there should not have been time or reason for Barber to re @-@ engrave the coin . Nevertheless , it exists in " Closed 3 " and " Open 3 " varieties . Breen suggested that the " Open 3 " variety was actually struck at a later date , probably clandestinely ; it was not known to exist until discovered by a numismatist in the 1950s . Numismatist Paul Green ascribed the two varieties to the two types of proof sets that the Mint sold at the time that would have contained the two @-@ cent piece . The " nickel set " contained only the low @-@ value coins without precious metal , while another contained also the silver coins ; he suggested that one variety was struck for each . 
 Large quantities of two @-@ cent pieces were withdrawn in the 1870s and after . Approximately 17 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 of the some 45 @,@ 600 @,@ 000 two @-@ cent pieces issued had been repurchased by the Treasury as of 1909 . Withdrawn pieces were melted and recoined into one @-@ cent pieces . A bill for a two @-@ cent piece bearing the portrait of recently deceased former president Theodore Roosevelt passed the Senate in 1920 and was strongly recommended by a House committee but never enacted . Numismatist S. W. Freeman noted in 1954 that few alive could remember using a two @-@ cent piece , but for those who did , it was often associated with spending it at a candy store . He recalled that two cents would buy a quantity of sweets , as a dime did in Freeman 's day , and , he feared , it would take a quarter to do in the future . Full legal tender status was granted the two @-@ cent piece by the Coinage Act of 1965 , long after the coin had passed from circulation , as it made all coins and currency of the United States good for all public and private debts without limit . Nevertheless , numismatist Jack White pointed out in a 1971 column that due to its short lifespan , the piece " hardly got its two cents in " . 
 R.S. Yeoman 's 2015 edition of A Guide Book of United States Coins lists the 1864 large motto and the 1865 as the least expensive two @-@ cent pieces , in good ( G @-@ 4 ) condition at $ 18 , though every issue by year through 1871 lists for $ 40 or less in that condition . The reason for the relatively flat prices , even in top grades , is a lack of collectors who seek the entire series ( it is most popularly collected with a single specimen as part of a " type set " of the various issues of American coins ) . Despite the high mintage , it is the 1864 date that has one of the more highly valued varieties , the " small motto " . Yeoman lists the 1864 small motto in Proof condition , at $ 18 @,@ 500 and in Very Fine ( VF @-@ 20 ) it is $ 500 .

 Marwa Ali El @-@ Sherbini ( Egyptian Arabic : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , was an Egyptian woman and German resident who was killed in 2009 during an appeal hearing at a court of law in Dresden , Germany . She was stabbed by Alex Wiens , an ethnic German immigrant from Russia against whom she had testified in a criminal case for verbal abuse . El @-@ Sherbini 's husband , who was present at the hearing , tried to intervene . He too was repeatedly stabbed by Wiens and was then mistakenly shot and wounded by a police officer who was called to the court room . Wiens was arrested at the crime scene and subsequently tried for murder and attempted murder . He was found guilty of both charges ; it was also found that Wiens 's actions constituted a heinous crime , because they were committed in front of a child , against two people , in a court of law , and fulfilled the murder criterion of treacherousness , such as hatred against foreigners . Wiens was sentenced to life imprisonment . 
 The death of El @-@ Sherbini immediately resulted in international reactions , with the most vocal responses coming from predominantly Muslim nations . The Egyptian public and media focused attention on the religious and racial hatred aspect of the killing , especially as the initial confrontation between the victim and perpetrator had happened because she wore an Islamic headscarf . In response to anti @-@ German sentiments and public protests in Egypt and other countries , the German government issued a statement of condolence nine days after the incident . Wiens 's trial for murder and attempted murder occurred under strict security measures and was observed by national and international media , diplomats and legal experts .

 Alex Wiens ( Russian : <unk> <unk> , also known as Alexander Wiens ) was born in 1980 in Perm , Russia . After leaving school , he completed a vocational training programme as a <unk> . In 1999 , after a medical examination for conscription , Wiens was exempted from compulsory military service in the Russian armed forces ; it was stated that Wiens probably had suffered from a severe and chronic psychosis . In 2003 , he immigrated to Germany and gained German citizenship as a result of his ethnic origin . In Germany , he worked as a builder and caretaker , but had been living on welfare benefits for the long @-@ term unemployed at the time of the murder . In November 2009 , at the time of sentencing , Wiens was 28 years old , unmarried and without children . 
 = = Verbal abuse and court case for defamation = = 
 On 21 August 2008 , Wiens and El @-@ Sherbini met at a public playground in Dresden 's <unk> district , where Wiens 's niece and El @-@ Sherbini 's son were playing . During a quarrel over whose child should be using the playground 's swing , Wiens began shouting verbal abuse at El @-@ Sherbini . El @-@ Sherbini who was wearing an Islamic headscarf , was called " Islamist " , " terrorist " and ( according to one report ) " slut " . Other people present tried to intervene , but Wiens vehemently continued the verbal abuse for several minutes , directing epithets in Russian and German at the Russian @-@ speaking bystanders who attempted to reason with him . El @-@ Sherbini called the police on a bystander 's mobile phone and within a few minutes four police officers arrived in two vehicles at the scene . El @-@ Sherbini and Wiens were questioned ; El @-@ Sherbini was subsequently driven away in one of the police vehicles . 
 Wiens was charged with criminal defamation and given a penalty order to pay a fine of € 330 . After formally objecting and refusing to pay the fine , Wiens was tried at the district court of Dresden . He was found guilty by the court and fined € 780 in November 2008 . However , during the trial Wiens claimed mitigating circumstances for the act of insulting El @-@ Sherbini , suggesting that " people like her " were not really human beings and therefore incapable of being insulted . The public prosecutor appealed the verdict , aiming at a custodial sentence , due to the openly xenophobic character of the incident . Wiens also appealed the verdict and was subsequently granted a court @-@ appointed defence counsel . His counsel intended to withdraw the appeal before the scheduled hearing at the regional court , but Wiens objected to this . 
 = = Appeal case and fatal attack in courtroom = = 
 At the appeal hearing at the regional court in Dresden , in the morning 1 July 2009 , nine people were present in the courtroom : three judges , the prosecutor , Wiens as the defendant , his court @-@ appointed defence counsel , El @-@ Sherbini as witness for the prosecution , and her husband and son as observers . No security personnel were present and no security searches of individuals and their possessions were carried out ; this was a common procedure for cases without anticipated security concerns or detained persons present . 
 During the trial , the defendant Wiens appeared reserved but was noted for extreme statements . He said that Muslims were monsters to him and asked the court why they were not deported after the 9 / 11 attacks . He stated that German people should not mingle with foreigners and declared that he would vote for the far right National Democratic Party of Germany . The judge then requested a verbatim record , while the defence counsel tried to mediate . Wiens continued in this fashion , prompting the judge to ask whether he had ever visited a concentration camp . 
 Following Wiens 's defence statement , El @-@ Sherbini testified to the court . After El @-@ Sherbini had finished her testimony , the judge asked whether there were any further questions . Wiens replied and asked why above all El @-@ Sherbini was in Germany . The question was rejected by the judge ; Wiens responded with a further question to which the defence counsel motioned for recess . El @-@ Sherbini was not intending to wait until the end of the hearing and tried to leave . When she , her husband , and their three @-@ year @-@ old son were at the door , Wiens suddenly attacked El @-@ Sherbini with a kitchen knife with an 18 cm ( 7 @.@ 1 in ) long blade , which he apparently had taken into the courtroom in a backpack . El @-@ Sherbini received more than 15 stab wounds to the upper body and arm ; the attack was carried out in such a forceful and sudden manner that it resulted in a notable absence of defence wounds . While trying to protect his wife , El @-@ Sherbini 's husband Okaz was stabbed at least 16 times to the head , neck , upper body and arm . Wiens 's defence counsel tried to help El @-@ Sherbini by obstructing Wiens with chairs and a table . The victim 's three @-@ year @-@ old son was injured while being ushered to safety . 
 At 10 : 23 , the judge raised a security alarm . Judicial officers , and a federal police officer who was in the court building testifying in an unrelated case , arrived at the scene ; however , during the ongoing commotion the police officer mistook Okaz for the attacker and shot him in the upper leg . Wiens collapsed and was apprehended after one of the judges pointed out that not Okaz but Wiens was the assailant . While under arrest , Wiens resisted and begged the police officer to shoot him dead . Okaz , critically wounded in the stabbing attack , was in a coma for two days . He was subsequently treated for several weeks in a hospital near Dresden for the stabbing and shooting injuries . El @-@ Sherbini died in the court building at 11 : 07 , succumbing to her injuries . 
 = = Murder trial = = 
 Wiens was held on remand on the suspicion of murder of El @-@ Sherbini and attempted murder of Okaz . He was formally charged with murder , attempted murder and grievous bodily harm by the public prosecutor 's office on 25 August 2009 . In the indictment , prosecutors stated treacherousness and malice ( based on hatred against non @-@ Europeans and Muslims ) as a motive . An application for a change of venue by Wiens 's defence lawyer was refused by the upper regional court . Following a psychiatric assessment , full criminal responsibility was assumed ; however , as the defendant had been diagnosed by Russian doctors to suffer from severe and chronic psychotic conditions , prosecutors requested relevant information from the Russian authorities prior to the trial . The requested documents arrived shortly before the end of the murder trial , without affecting its outcome . 
 The trial at the upper regional court in Dresden began on 26 October 2009 . It took place under strict security precautions due to alleged death threats to Wiens . All concurrent trials were transferred to other local venues , due to the security concerns , the great interest by the national and international media , and the public . El @-@ Sherbini 's widower , brother and parents acted in the role of ' co @-@ claimant ' and were represented by eight lawyers . On the first day of the trial , the entire prosecution counsel constituted of eight lawyers from Germany , France and Egypt was present in court ; the defendant arrived in court shrouded behind a mask , sunglasses , hat and a hood . The judge asked the defendant to remove his head attire and to confirm his name and date of birth . The defendant complied , except for removing his sunglasses , for which he was fined for contempt of court . The defence counsel motioned for the judges to be removed from the trial on the grounds of bias as they were colleagues of witnesses and worked near the crime scene . This was denied by a separate panel that had ruled on this motion . 
 Okaz testified on the first day of the trial . Further witnesses during the first week of the trial included an appointed medical examiner on the causes of the victim 's death , the judge who had presided over the trial at the regional court on 1 July 2009 , another judge ( <unk> ) who had co @-@ presided over the aforementioned trial , a social worker on the defendant 's previous behaviour , the court @-@ appointed counsel who had previously represented the defendant , a court security officer , and the judge of the defamation trial at the district court . Witnesses in the second week of the trial included people present in the original confrontation on the playground and the police officers responding to the attack on 21 August 2008 . The police officer who had mistakenly shot Okaz exercised the right to remain silent during the murder trial , as a criminal investigation against him was ongoing at the time . 
 At the beginning of the third day of the trial , Wiens incurred a self @-@ inflicted injury by banging his head against a table . He was diagnosed with haematomas and a suspected traumatic brain injury , but was judged fit to stand trial after a hospital @-@ based medical examination . While continuing with noncompliant and destructive behaviour , Wiens was temporarily restrained by nine security officers in court . 
 The closing arguments were heard on 9 and 10 November 2009 . The prosecution and the co @-@ plaintiffs argued for a conviction for murder and attempted murder , with the legal specification " heinous crime " . The defence argued for a conviction for manslaughter and attempted manslaughter , by reasoning that the killing was in the heat of the moment and that the defendant may have a paranoid personality disorder . The verdict was delayed because the requested medical information from Russian authorities that arrived 9 November 2009 attested " undifferentiated schizophrenia " in 2000 , thereby requiring additional testimony by a medical expert witness . 
 On 11 November 2009 , Wiens was found guilty of the murder of El @-@ Sherbini and the attempted murder of Okaz , and sentenced to life imprisonment . Judge Birgit Wiegand stated that the court had also found that Wiens 's deeds constituted a heinous crime , because they were committed in front of a child , against two people , in a court of law , and fulfilled the murder criterion of treacherousness , such as hatred against foreigners . It meant that Wiens received the maximum sentence for this crime . Wiens appealed the conviction ; however , the appeal was rejected by the Federal Court of Justice . In a decision published on 18 June 2010 , the fifth criminal division of the court of justice in Leipzig stated that the appeal on points of law was unfounded and confirmed the verdict and sentence of the regional court as final matter of criminal law .

 In October 2009 in an out @-@ of @-@ court discussion , lawyers on behalf of El @-@ Sherbini 's family and widower approached the Ministry of Justice of the State of Saxony about compensation . In the verdict on 11 November 2009 , Judge Birgit Wiegand granted the claimant 's request ( <unk> , § 406 <unk> ) to claim for damages against the defendant in an ' adherent case ' within the remit of this criminal case . It established — without a separate trial for a private law claim — that Wiens has an obligation to compensate Okaz and El @-@ Sherbini 's beneficiaries for having harmed Okaz and killed El @-@ Sherbini . 
 = = Investigation of shooting of Elwy Ali Okaz = = 
 The shooting of El @-@ Sherbini 's husband Okaz by the federal police officer , who mistook him for the attacker , was cited by El @-@ Sherbini 's brother as indicative of racism in Germany . Following a complaint , a criminal investigation was launched against the police officer who shot Okaz . In October 2009 , a criminal investigation for involuntary manslaughter and denial of assistance was launched against the judge who presided over the July trial , and against the president of the regional court . On 29 December 2009 , the public prosecutor 's office in Dresden announced that all investigations had been closed on 21 December 2009 without indictment , as no suspicion of a criminal offence could be substantiated . Prosecutors argued that it must have been particularly difficult to assess the situation for the intervening police officer , because when he entered the room " Elwy Okaz and Alex Wiens were both covered in blood and Elwy Okaz had just managed to grab the handle of the knife with his hand , making it appear as though he was the attacker " . There were further assessment difficulties because " the actual attacker — Wiens — was holding the blade of the knife , which added to the impression that he was the one being attacked " . The prosecutors ' conclusion was that shooting of Okaz was a tragic mistake . In January 2010 , a lawyer acting for El @-@ Sherbini 's family filed a complaint against the prosecutors ' decisions to close the investigations against the police officer , the judge presiding in the 1 July 2009 trial and the regional court president .

 The killing was reported on 1 July 2009 in German radio and television and in print media on the following day . In line with common practice regarding reporting in the German media about crime and legal proceedings , El @-@ Sherbini was referred to as " 32 [ sic ] -year old " witness in a Deutschlandfunk report broadcast on 1 July , without any mention to the victim 's ethnic or religious background . The Minister of Justice for Saxony , Geert <unk> , who had visited the crime scene on the same day , publicly expressed his " deep compassion for the victim 's family , for the victim herself " . Another politician called for an investigation and the Association of Judges in Saxony ( <unk> <unk> ) demanded a review of security procedures in court buildings . 
 Writing in The Guardian , Anja <unk> commented that " the German media initially reported on the case at the back page " , and only in the light of the vociferous protests by thousands of Egyptians in Cairo , " the German federal government , which had kept silent for nearly a week , issued words of sorrow .

 The General Secretaries of Germany 's Muslim and Jewish Councils visited El @-@ Sherbini 's husband in hospital on 6 July 2009 .

We must stand together against such inhumanity . " Kramer later wrote " ... as a Jew I know that anyone who attacks a person because of their race , nationality or religion is not only attacking the minority , they are attacking democratic society as a whole . " He also deplored the " largely unchecked hate propaganda against Muslims " . 
 The Central Council of Muslims in Germany suggested that the death of El @-@ Sherbini was a result of a growing " Islamophobia " , evident in many Internet discussion boards . They called upon Muslims not to <unk> the woman 's death . A local Islamic association in Dresden stated that their planned centre for cultural exchange will be named after El @-@ Sherbini , to promote mutual understanding between Muslims and non @-@ Muslims .

 On 6 July 2009 , about 2 @,@ 000 Muslims of the Egyptian community and other nationalities in Germany held funeral prayers for El @-@ Sherbini , in Dar Al @-@ Salam Mosque , in Berlin . Five days later a public memorial was organized by civil rights groups in Dresden ; it was attended by more than 1 @,@ 000 people , including the Egyptian ambassador and officials from the state of Saxony ; white roses and photos of El @-@ Sherbini and her family were placed outside Dresden City Hall . About the same time , the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics , where El @-@ Sherbini 's husband researches , issued a statement on the occasion of the official ceremony , expressing shock and sympathy . This was preceded by the Max Planck Society having strongly condemned the attack on 8 July , by stating : " The fact that the attack was racially motivated is especially distressing to us , considering that the Max Planck Society is a scientific research organisation with staff members from the most various nations . " 
 In December 2009 , the Ministry of Justice in Saxony announced plans to commemorated the death of El @-@ Sherbini with a memorial plaque in the regional court building . This plaque will state both in German and Arabic language : " [ Marwa El @-@ Sherbini ] She fell victim to Islamophobia and xenophobia . With dignity and commendable moral courage she withstood this . " 
 In July 2010 , one year after the murder , an association of local citizens organised a memorial art installation across Dresden , to commemorate the loss of life caused by the heinous crime and as a symbol against racism in everyday life . Eighteen concrete stelae in form of knives were temporary displayed in different public places , to represent the eighteen knife stab wounds that were inflicted on the victim . Some of the stelae were vandalised during the display . 
 In October 2012 , a scholarship in memory of Marwa El @-@ Sherbini was awarded for the first time . It is jointly funded by the city administration of Dresden and the state government of Saxony .

At El @-@ Sherbini 's funeral in Alexandria , mourners referred to her as " a ' martyr ' of the head scarf " and accused Germany of " racism " and " Islamophobia . " Mourners carried banners criticising both German and Egyptian authorities ' reactions to the crime . Egyptian police temporarily cordoned off the German embassy in Cairo to protect it from angry protesters . In response to the anti @-@ German sentiments and public protests in Egypt and elsewhere , the German government eventually issued a statement of condolence . Some Egyptian commentators took a reconciling approach . Writing in the opinion section of Al @-@ Ahram Weekly , Abdel @-@ <unk> Said called on those who mourn for Marwa El @-@ Sherbini " not [ to fall ] into the same morass of bigotry and hatred that killed her , " but to " create Arab @-@ Muslim @-@ European fronts , together with other faiths , to stand up against fanaticism , bigotry and discrimination on both sides . " 
 Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad blamed the German government for El @-@ Sherbini 's murder and called for international condemnation of Germany . In a letter to UN Secretary General Ban Ki @-@ moon , Ahmadinejad demanded firm action against Germany and stated that " there is a strong view that the crime was a pre @-@ planned attempt engineered by the judicial system and security forces " . Iran also issued a postage stamp featuring El @-@ Sherbini , which Press TV reported was banned in Egypt .

 Interviewed by Deutschlandfunk radio , Al Jazeera correspondent to Germany <unk> Suliman said that their viewers watched the trial closely , because they were disaffected by the initial reaction in Germany to the killing . He also noted that the perceptions of a speculated verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity differed vastly between Al Jazeera and Deutschlandfunk audiences . Accordingly , the former tend to apprehend such a verdict as an absence of punishment in terms of criminal justice , whereas the latter tend to be discerned with containment away from public life through being involuntarily committed to a forensic psychiatry institution . Media scientist Hanan Badr commented on reporting in Germany and Egypt as being " a prime example of mass @-@ media miscommunication between cultures " .

 = = Plot = = 
 Leslie ( Amy Poehler ) visits the Pawnee high school to confront Greg Pikitis ( Cody Klop ) , a teenager who she describes as her " arch @-@ nemesis " . Leslie warns Greg she knows he vandalizes the town 's statue of Mayor Percy every Halloween , but that she will be watching him closely and will catch him this year . Greg casually denies having any such plans . At the Pawnee town hall , Ann ( Rashida Jones ) talks excitedly about her upcoming Halloween party . She asks the others not to mention it to Tom ( Aziz Ansari ) , but she is disappointed to learn Jerry ( Jim O 'Heir ) has already told him . That night , Leslie watches Greg with the help of her boyfriend , Pawnee police officer Dave Sanderson ( Louis C.K. ) , while Andy ( Chris Pratt ) , who now has a part @-@ time job with the parks department , guards the statue . 
 Ann 's party is off to a boring start and she soon begins to fear it will be a failure altogether . When Tom and his wife Wendy ( Jama Williamson ) arrive , however , Tom spices up the party by turning the living room into a dance floor . The party is soon a big hit , and Ann thanks Tom profusely . Wendy tells Ron ( Nick Offerman ) she knows Ron learned her marriage to Tom was a " green card marriage " to keep her from being deported to Canada , and thanks him for his discretion . She tells him they will soon be able to divorce without raising any suspicions , unaware that Tom is visibly upset about it . 
 After watching Greg for hours , Leslie and Dave decide to go to Ann 's party . They stop at the parks department to get Leslie 's costume , only to find the office has been toilet papered and vandalized . Leslie immediately suspects Greg , even though they had been watching him all night . Dave reluctantly agrees to bring Greg in for questioning , but Greg insists he is innocent . Andy comes in and questions Greg , pretending to be an FBI agent named Burt Macklin , but Greg is so mean to him Andy soon starts crying . Greg 's mother eventually arrives and takes him away after threatening to report the trio for holding her son without proof of his guilt . 
 Later , Andy helps Leslie clean the parks office and , after a few beers , they decide to toilet paper Greg 's house . Dave arrives in his police car and tells them he had been called to stop them . When an unfamiliar woman comes out of the house , Leslie thinks she has toilet papered the wrong house . However , the woman reveals she is Greg 's actual mother , and that Greg hired a " fake mother " off of Craigslist to get him out of trouble . When she realizes Greg is not home , Leslie believes he is vandalizing the mayor statue . They go to the statue and catch Greg in the process ; although Leslie wishes to have him " locked up , " Dave points out he is still a minor and will likely only receive probation . Later , Leslie wonders how Greg managed to trash the parks department . The episode ends with a flashback showing Greg sneaking into the department disguised as a janitor , hiding in a dumpster until everybody leaves , then vandalizing the office .

It was only a slight drop from the previous week , despite direct competition from game two of the 2009 World Series on Fox . " Greg Pikitis " drew a 2 @.@ 1 rating / 5 share among viewers aged between 18 and 49 . The episode received generally positive reviews . Many commentators said the awkward exchanges between Ron and Wendy at the Halloween party seemed to be hinting at a possible romance between the two in future episodes . Matt Fowler of IGN said " Greg Pikitis " was " probably the best conceived and most hilarious episode " of Parks and Recreation so far . Fowler said he liked the Leslie and Andy pairing , and he was relieved the show found something " meaty and meaningful " to do with the character . Fowler said Ann 's party was less funny , but advanced many of the supporting characters . 
 Alan Sepinwall of The Star @-@ Ledger declared " Greg Pikitis " one of the episodes he would suggest to newcomers seeking to become familiar with Parks and Recreation , calling it " the version of Parks and Recreation that I most enjoy : silly , but also intentionally small in scale " . He particularly praised Louis CK and some of the smaller jokes in the episode , like the fact that a gay character 's " straight guy " Halloween costume is identical to Mark 's regular wardrobe . Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said the episode " demonstrated how an episode of P & R can work wonders — dial up the conditions that might drive a character insane , as they did to Leslie , and watch them squirm " . He also said the episode featured every supporting character well , but that Ann was less funny without a " wacky person to play off of " . Time magazine critic James Poniewozik said it was a " strong episode that hit office and personal sides of the characters equally well " . Poniewozik praised Pratt and Louis C.K. in particular , but also said Leslie was pushed " a little too far into the crazy @-@ obsessive end of the spectrum " . Not all reviews were positive . Linda Stasi of New York Post said the episode was " a big yawn " , although she praised the performance of Cody Klop as Greg Pikitis .

 = Rapid strep test = 
 The rapid strep test ( RST ) , or rapid antigen detection test ( RADT ) , is a rapid diagnostic test that is widely used in clinics to assist in the diagnosis of bacterial pharyngitis caused by group A streptococci ( GAS ) , sometimes termed strep throat . There are currently several types of rapid strep test in use , each employing a distinct technology . However , they all work by detecting the presence of GAS in the throat of a patient by responding to GAS @-@ specific antigens on a throat swab . 
 = = Applications = = 
 A rapid strep test may assist a clinician in deciding whether to prescribe an antibiotic to a patient with pharyngitis , a common infection of the throat . Viral infections are responsible for the majority of pharyngitis , but a significant proportion ( 20 % to 40 % in children and 5 % to 15 % in adults ) is caused by bacterial infection . The symptoms of viral and bacterial infection may be indistinguishable , but only bacterial pharyngitis can be effectively treated by antibiotics . Since the major cause of bacterial pharyngitis is GAS , the presence of this organism in a patient 's throat may be seen as a necessary condition for prescribing antibiotics . GAS pharyngitis is a self @-@ limiting infection that will usually resolve within a week without medication . However , antibiotics may reduce the length and severity of the illness and reduce the risk of certain rare but serious complications . 
 RSTs may also have a public health benefit . In addition to undesirable side @-@ effects in the individual , inappropriate antibiotic use is thought to contribute to the development of drug @-@ resistant strains of bacteria . By helping to identify bacterial infection , RSTs may help to limit the use of antibiotics in viral illnesses , where they are not beneficial . 
 Some clinical guidelines recommend the use of RSTs in patients with pharyngitis , but others do not . US guidelines are more consistently in favor of their use than their European equivalents . The use of RSTs may be most beneficial in the third world , where the complications of streptococcal infection are most prevalent , but their use in these regions has not been well studied . 
 Microbial culture from a throat swab is a reliable and affordable alternative to an RST which has high sensitivity and specificity . However , a culture requires special facilities and usually takes 48 hours to give a result , whereas an RST can give a result within several minutes . 
 = = Procedure = = 
 The patient ’ s throat is first swabbed to collect a sample of mucus . In most RSTs , this mucus sample is then exposed to a reagent containing antibodies that will bind specifically to a GAS antigen . A positive result is signified by a certain visible reaction . There are three major types of RST : First , a latex fixation test , which was developed in the 1980s and is largely obsolete . It employs latex beads covered with antigens that will visibly agglutinate around GAS antibodies if these are present . Second , a lateral flow test , which is currently the most widely used RST . The sample is applied to a strip of nitrocellulose film and , if GAS antigens are present , these will migrate along the film to form a visible line of antigen bound to labeled antibodies . Third , optical immunoassay is the newest and more expensive test . It involves mixing the sample with labeled antibodies and then with a special substrate on a film which changes colour to signal the presence or absence of GAS antigen . 
 = = Interpretation = = 
 The specificity of RSTs for the presence of GAS is at least 95 % , with some studies finding close to 100 % specificity . Therefore , if the test result is positive , the presence of GAS is highly likely . However , 5 % to 20 % of individuals carry GAS in their throats without symptomatic infection , so the presence of GAS in an individual with pharyngitis does not prove that this organism is responsible for the infection . The sensitivity of lateral flow RSTs is somewhat lower at 65 % to 80 % . Therefore , a negative result from such a test cannot be used to rule out GAS pharyngitis , a considerable disadvantage compared with microbial culture , which has a sensitivity of 90 % to 95 % . However , newer optical immunoassay RSTs have been found to have a much higher sensitivity of 94 % . 
 Although an RST cannot distinguish GAS infection from asymptomatic carriage of the organism , most authorities recommend antibiotic treatment in the event of a positive RST result from a patient with a sore throat . US guidelines recommend following up a negative result with a microbial culture , whereas European guidelines suggest relying on the negative RST . 
 = Petlyakov Pe @-@ 3 = 
 The Petlyakov Pe @-@ 3 was the long @-@ range , night fighter version of the successful Petlyakov Pe @-@ 2 high @-@ speed bomber used by the Soviet Union during World War II . 
 Its design and use followed a comparable path to those taken by the German Luftwaffe with the Junkers Ju 88 and the British Royal Air Force with the De Havilland Mosquito . The Soviets realized the need for a night fighter after the first night bombing of Moscow during Operation Barbarossa . The Petlyakov Pe @-@ 2 was selected for modification as the most suitable aircraft available . 
 It was initially used for daylight ground attack missions during the Battle of Moscow , but this proved to be costly since the aircraft was unarmored . Armor and additional guns were retrofitted to the existing aircraft to make it more effective , but the evacuation of the sole factory building the Pe @-@ 3 in October 1941 limited the number of aircraft available and many units of the Soviet Air Forces flying the Pe @-@ 3 were either disbanded or converted to other aircraft . Although production was stopped and restarted several times , the aircraft remained in service throughout World War II . Most of the later production runs were given to reconnaissance units . 
 = = Development = = 
 A crash @-@ development program began after the July 1941 German night bombing of Moscow to field a night fighter with heavy armament and long endurance . Only an aircraft currently in production could be used to satisfy the extremely tight deadline and the Pe @-@ 2 was selected for modification by the State Commissariat for Defence ( Russian : Narodnyy <unk> <unk> — NKO ) as the fastest twin @-@ engined aircraft in service . The order only authorized four days to modify the aircraft 's fuel , armament and radio systems , but this deadline was met when the modified aircraft made its first flight on 7 August and it passed its manufacturer 's trials the following day . 
 Three additional fuel tanks , with a capacity of 700 liters ( 154 imp gal ; 185 U.S. gal ) were fitted in the prototype , one in the fuselage bomb bay and the other two replaced the ventral gunner 's position . The nose armament was reinforced with an additional 12 @.@ 7 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 50 in ) Berezin UBK machine gun with 150 rounds and a fixed 7 @.@ 62 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 300 in ) ShKAS machine gun with 250 rounds was added in the tail cone . Removal of two of the fuselage bomb racks reduced the maximum bomb load to 700 kilograms ( 1 @,@ 543 lb ) , one 250 @-@ kilogram ( 551 lb ) bomb on each of the fuselage racks and one 100 @-@ kilogram ( 220 lb ) in each of the engine nacelles . The electric bomb release system was removed and the bombs had to be dropped using the mechanical system , initially designed as the emergency system . The dive brakes under the wings were also removed . The <unk> radio was exchanged for the RSI @-@ 4 model commonly used in single @-@ seat fighters and the radio direction finder was also removed to save weight . The prototype weighed 5 @,@ 890 kg ( 12 @,@ 985 lb ) empty and it had a normal take @-@ off weight of 7 @,@ 800 kg ( 17 @,@ 196 lb ) , slightly heavier than the version of the Pe @-@ 2 then in production . During testing it demonstrated a maximum speed of 530 km / h ( 329 mph ) at 5 @,@ 000 meters ( 16 @,@ 404 ft ) , a service ceiling of 9 @,@ 000 meters ( 29 @,@ 528 ft ) and a maximum range of 2 @,@ 150 km ( 1 @,@ 336 mi ) . This was considered adequate and Factory ( Russian : Zavod ) Nr. 39 in Moscow was ordered on 14 August to build five pre @-@ production aircraft for delivery by 25 August . This process proved difficult because drawings had not been made for many of the new parts and they had to be fitted by hand , slowing the production rate . 
 Slightly more extensive testing of a pre @-@ production aircraft was done by the Air Force Scientific Test Institute ( Russian : <unk> @-@ Issledovatel 'skiy Institoot Voyenno @-@ <unk> Seel — NII VVS ) between 29 August and 7 September . Although they confirmed the initial performance figures , the tests revealed other problems . The lower nose Plexiglas windows cracked when the lower UBK machine gun was fired , a problem initially cured by replacing some of the glazing with a duralumin skin , but this too proved to be too weak , and it was itself later replaced by a steel panel . Pre @-@ production testing also revealed that the casings and links from the large @-@ caliber weapons damaged the skin of the wings and sometimes entered the radiator intakes , where they could cause extensive damage . Revising the shape of the ejector chutes did not help and the casings had to be collected in the nose . Pre @-@ production testing also identified several other specific weaknesses that had to be corrected on the production line . The Pe @-@ 3 's offensive firepower was too weak and a 20 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) ShVAK cannon was added . The firepower of the dorsal 7.62mm ShKAS machine gun was considered inadequate , and on the production line , was replaced by a 12 @.@ 7 mm Berezin UBT machine gun . To protect the crew , the production line added frontal armor and extended existing armor to the rear to protect the navigator . The production line also replaced the RSI @-@ 4 radio with model that had greater range and added a camera for the Pe @-@ 3 's reconnaissance role . Although most of the initial aircraft were delivered without these adaptations , they were modified in the field by factory teams . 
 The first Pe @-@ 3s were issued to the 95th High @-@ Speed Bomber Regiment in the Moscow Military District and the Regiment 's experiences with the aircraft revealed other problems . Firing the guns at night dazzled the pilot and destroyed his night vision and the glare from searchlights through the glazing on the lower nose also blinded the pilot . Crews complained bitterly that the lack of frontal armor made them vulnerable to defensive fire from German bombers . Flash <unk> installed on the guns and curtains covering the windows cured the first problems , but the lack of armor could not be rectified immediately . Many aircraft were also fitted with launchers for four to six RS @-@ 82 and RS @-@ 132 rockets for ground @-@ attack missions . Another common addition was a launcher for DAG @-@ 10 aerial grenades mounted in the tail . 
 The Petlyakov design bureau addressed these concerns in September and they were tested in the Pe @-@ 3bis prototype between September and October . The armament was upgraded with 250 rounds provided for each of the UBK machine guns , a 20 mm ShVAK cannon with 250 rounds was mounted in the nose and a 12 @.@ 7 mm Berezin UBT machine gun with 180 rounds in boxes replaced the 7 @.@ 62 mm ShKAS in the dorsal position . Frontal armor was installed and the navigator 's seat armor was thickened with a total weight of 136 kg ( 300 lb ) . Automatic leading edge slats were fitted and the nitrogen fuel tank pressurization system was replaced by one that used inert gases from the engine exhaust . The crash pylon was moved forward 48 centimeters ( 1 ft 7 in ) and the cockpit canopy shortened . 
 Many of these changes were made to aircraft before Pe @-@ 3bis production resumed in April 1942 and combat @-@ use revealed several additional problems that had to be addressed in a second Pe @-@ 3bis prototype , which began its State acceptance tests in May 1942 . Reloading the nose guns proved to be time @-@ consuming , taking up to 45 minutes , and the night @-@ firing of the port @-@ side UBK continued to blind the pilot . These problems prompted the transfer of both UBK guns to the wing center section where they were installed in a compartment that was hinged at the front to drop down and allow easier access to the guns and their ammunition . The starboard gun was given 230 rounds and the port gun had 265 rounds . This change reduced the capacity of the Nr. 7 fuel tank by 100 liters ( 22 imp gal ; 26 U.S. gal ) , but an asbestos bulkhead was added to protect the tank from heat generated by the guns . The changes meant that the cartridge cases from the ShVAK cannon could not be collected , making the skin and lower fuselage vulnerable . These were reinforced with steel sheets to minimize the damage inflicted by the large @-@ caliber cases . The original mounting for the dorsal UBT machine gun provided an excellent field of fire , but lack of aerodynamic balance prevented the gunner / navigator to use its full range . Pressure exerted by the airstream prevented the gunner from traversing more than about 40 – 50 ° from the centerline . A twin @-@ petal compensator proved mostly ineffective . The crash pylon was removed to give the gunner more working space . The ammunition box of the UBT was too small , only 30 rounds , and took about a minute to reload . The boxes were deleted and the UBT was given a 200 @-@ round belt with an electric drive to help to prevent feed problems . An anti @-@ icing system was added for the propellers and the pilot 's windscreen . The nose glazing was replaced entirely and the crew 's armor was increased to a total weight of 148 kg ( 326 lb ) . These changes moved the aircraft 's center of gravity forward and the landing gear struts were lengthened , moving the wheels 60 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) forward , which helped to reduce the chance of the aircraft tipping over . 
 = = = Production = = = 
 Zavod Nr. 39 built 16 Pe @-@ 3s in August , including the prototype , 98 in September and 82 in October before the factory was evacuated to Irkutsk late in October . Production was restarted in April 1942 with a total of 132 built during the year . All were Pe @-@ 3bis models except for eleven Pe @-@ 3s that had not been completed before the evacuation . Thirteen were built in 1943 before production was canceled in favor of Ilyushin Il @-@ 4 bombers . A final production batch of 19 was built at Zavod Nr. 22 in early 1944 , but these were more lightly armed than earlier versions , with only a single ShVAK cannon in the wing center section and one UBK in the nose . The bomb racks in the engine nacelles were eliminated entirely , as was the fixed ShKAS machine gun in the tail . Two DAG @-@ 10 grenade launchers were fitted in the rear fuselage , each with ten grenades .

 The first Pe @-@ 3s were issued to the 95th High @-@ Speed Bomber Aviation Regiment in August 1941 and it was initially committed to the ground attack and escort roles after retraining through September . It was redesignated as the 95th Fighter Aviation Regiment on 25 September and assigned to the 6th Fighter Aviation Corps of the PVO defending Moscow . A few days later six Pe @-@ 3s escorted C @-@ 47s carrying a British military delegation flying from Vologda to Moscow and successfully defended against several German attacks on the transports . Pe @-@ 3s strafed German troop columns as they approached Moscow during Operation Typhoon . On 24 October the 95th and 208th Fighter Aviation Regiments , with a total of twenty @-@ seven Pe @-@ 3s between them , attacked the German airfield at Kalinin , claiming thirty German aircraft destroyed for the loss of five Soviet aircraft and pilots , including the commander of the 208th Regiment , Major S. <unk> . The 9th , 40th , 54th and 511th Bomber Aviation Regiments also received Pe @-@ 3s during September and performed similar missions . Approximately 50 aircraft were lost during the Pe @-@ 3 's first three months of combat , about 25 % of the aircraft produced thus far . This was a very high loss rate and a number of units began to conduct less risky reconnaissance missions to minimize casualties . Pe @-@ 3s were issued to the 1st , 2nd and 3rd Reconnaissance Aviation Regiments in October as well . 
 With production terminated in October due to the evacuation of the factory , the number of available Pe @-@ 3s could not sustain as many units and many began to convert to other aircraft or roles . The 40th Fast Bomber Aviation Regiment was re @-@ designated as the 40th Separate Long @-@ range Reconnaissance Aviation Regiment on 15 December and mustered five Pe @-@ 3s on 1 May 1942 and eleven Pe @-@ 3s on 1 January 1943 . The 9th Bomber Aviation Regiment was directly assigned to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force at the end of November 1941 and received the additional task of leading groups of fighters and attack aircraft to their targets because their pilots could not navigate on their own . Over 2000 aircraft were led to their targets in this manner before the regiment was converted to other roles . The 54th Bomber Aviation Regiment appears to have been disbanded on or after 20 May 1942 . The 208th Short @-@ Range Bomber Regiment lost ten aircraft before it transferred its surviving pilots and aircraft to the 95th Fighter Aviation Regiment in mid @-@ January 1942 and reformed on the Ilyushin Il @-@ 2 . On 5 February 1942 the 511th Bomber Aviation Regiment was based at Tula and lost three of its eight Pe @-@ 3s on strength to a German air raid . It was disbanded in late March 1942 for lack of aircraft . The 95th Fighter Aviation Regiment was transferred on 1 March 1942 to the Air Force of the Northern Fleet where it performed convoy escort , ground attack and reconnaissance missions in support of the Fleet . It operated Pe @-@ 3s as late as the end of 1942 when some of its crews , which had just picked up new aircraft , were diverted to participate in the Battle of Stalingrad , although most of the 1942 production aircraft were given to the 2nd , 4th , and 40th Separate Long @-@ Range Reconnaissance Regiments . 
 A single Pe @-@ 3 was captured by the Finns when it had to make a forced landing in marshy ground near Lake Inari on 28 November 1942 . It was relatively undamaged and was recovered , repaired and placed into service as ' PE @-@ 301 ' . It served with <unk> 48 and was converted into a photo @-@ reconnaissance aircraft in 1944 before being destroyed by a Soviet bombing raid on the airfield at <unk> on 2 July 1944 . By then , it had flown over 222 hours in Finnish service . 
 The <unk> @-@ 2 airborne radar was evaluated in the Pe @-@ 3 beginning in July 1942 and it was sent to both Moscow and Stalingrad for combat trials in late 1942 . Another round of trials was conducted by aircraft of the 2nd Guards Fighter Corps of the PVO in Leningrad between February and May 1943 and it was approved for service the next month . Very few appear to have been deployed as only fifteen were fitted on Pe @-@ 3s .

 " Catalysts " is the seventh episode of the animated television series The Spectacular Spider @-@ Man , which is based on the comic book character Spider @-@ Man , created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko . The episode sees Spider @-@ Man trying to stop the psychotic supervillain Green Goblin from bombing a dinner party filled with high @-@ class New York citizens on the night of his school 's big Fall Formal . 
 Written by Andrew Robinson and directed by the series ' co @-@ developer Victor Cook , " Catalysts " marked the first appearance of Green Goblin in the series . The villain 's design followed the show 's color scheme by emphasizing the color green and was based primarily on initial designs by Alex Ross for the character in the 2002 film Spider @-@ Man . Performers Steven Blum and Vanessa Marshall began their roles as Green Goblin and Mary Jane Watson , respectively . 
 The episode originally broadcast on April 26 , 2008 , following repeat episodes of " Natural Selection " and " Competition . " It is available on both the third volume DVD set for the series , as well as the complete season box set . It ranked as among the highest rated children 's telecast the morning it aired and received a generally positive response from television critics . Green Goblin 's appearance and new personality split critics , who felt that it was suitable but also strayed from his comic appearance .

Flash Thompson tries to ruin the date by mentioning a bet he and Peter had . Mary Jane is unscathed by the idea of the bet and goes to dance . Harry goes to get drinks and overhears Glory getting back together with her ex @-@ boyfriend . He is furious and goes to his locker where he drinks a vial of green formula . 
 Meanwhile , a mysterious , Halloween themed green and purple costumed , and psychotic supervillain named Green Goblin breaks into an Oscorp laboratory late at night and steals several pieces of equipment , including a glider . With the equipment , Goblin flies off and attacks a group of thieves who are working for the crime lord the " Big Man . " He uses some stolen money as incentive for them if they work for him and they accept . Now armed with personal terrorists , he crashes and holds up a black tie dinner party orchestrated by the " Big Man " in his alter ego as philanthropist L. Thompson Lincoln . Lincoln is unimpressed and <unk> his guards on the Goblin and his terrorists , but they are defeated easily . Air Force Colonel John Jameson tries to fight them , too , but is also taken down . 
 Peter is contacted by the Daily Bugle to go take photographs of the hold @-@ up at the party and is forced to leave Mary Jane , who understands as it is his job . Peter arrives at party as Spider @-@ Man , where he is greeted by Lincoln . At first , Spider @-@ Man thinks Goblin is simply working for the " Big Man " but is confirmed otherwise . Goblin briefly tries to convince Spider @-@ Man to join him but is turned down so the green goblin makes it his mission to kill <unk> so the two proceed to fight .

 = = Production = = 
 " Catalyst " was written by Andrew Robinson and directed by Victor Cook , a producer and developer of The Spectacular Spider @-@ Man . It originally aired on the Kids WB ! block for The CW on April 26 , 2008 , at 10 : 00 a.m. Eastern / Pacific time , with a parental guidance rating of TV @-@ Y7 @-@ FV . It was preceded by repeats of the episodes " Natural Selection " and " Competition , " and was the first new episode of the series to air after a two @-@ week hiatus following the episode " The Invisible Hand . " The episode 's title , " Catalysts , " expands the series theme " The Education of Peter Parker " chosen by developer Greg Weisman . Episodes in the third season one arc all shared a naming scheme based on chemistry . 
 Green Goblin 's costume was mainly designed after his original comic book appearance . The basic structure was based on initial designs drawn by Alex Ross for the Goblin as he appeared in the 2002 film Spider @-@ Man , which was never used . Alterations were made to make it resemble Medieval clothing . The suit displays the color green , which , in Cook 's broad color scheme for the series , is used to symbolize negative situations in Peter 's life , while positive settings and occurrences , such as Peter 's biology class , feature other key colors like yellow . 
 Green Goblin was voiced by Steve Blum . Blum has starred in several different video games and animated series as a voice actor and , at the time of the episode 's broadcast , had been about to star as the titular character of the then @-@ forthcoming animated series Wolverine and the X @-@ Men on Nicktoons Network . 
 Mary Jane was voiced by Vanessa Marshall . Marshall has voice acted on several animated series and video games , as well as starring in commercials and other on @-@ screen roles and performing stand @-@ up comedy . Marshall was filming a Honda commercial when her agent , Cathey <unk> , called her to confirm that she had landed the role as Mary Jane , simply saying , " Hello , is this Mary Jane ? " Overjoyed , Marshall dropped to her knees and began hyperventilating , which worried the producers of the commercial . Marshall 's mother had voiced Spider @-@ Woman in the original 1980s Spider @-@ Man animated series , though Marshall 's interest in Spider @-@ Man had dated back to reading the comic books in her youth . On her character , Marshall noted that she is " incredibly complex : " 
 " Her strength plays a major part in Peter ’ s growth and maturation – she really keeps him on the straight and narrow . Even though our characters are still only in high school during this cartoon , and you ’ re not going to get a lot of that character development at this point of the series , I know it ’ s going to be there in the future and so that has an effect on how I play her now . " 
 " Catalysts " became available on the DVD The Spectacular Spider @-@ Man , Volume 3 , on March 17 , 2009 , alongside the episodes " Reaction " and " The Uncertainty Principle . " The volume featured episodes that detailed Green Goblin as a prominent character . It became available on the full season DVD box set entitled The Spectacular Spider @-@ Man : The Complete First Season DVD Review , which featured every other episode of season one for the series .

 In its initial broadcast , " Catalysts " was met with season @-@ high Nielsen ratings , meeting well with all demographics and ranking as one of the highest rated children 's telecast for any network that morning . 
 The episode received generally positive reception from television critics . Eric Goldman of IGN , gave it an 8 @.@ 0 ( " Impressive " ) , writing that " [ w ] hile not among the very best episodes , this was still another fun and involving installment of the show . " Goldman gave a mixed response about Green Goblin — noting that he is " perhaps a bit hyper sensitive on how he 's portrayed " — considering the design , while similar to the comics , be more of an exact version of it ; Goldman considered the character 's personality was " a bit too evocative of the Joker , " the iconic villain from DC 's Batman comics , but believed that his " malice side " worked . On the topic of Mary Jane , Goldman praised her for being " much like Stan Lee created her – a quick witted , fun loving girl . " He also applauded the mysterious factors of Green Goblin 's true identity . 
 Sean Elliot , editor for iF magazine , gave the episode an " A. " He wrote in his review that Goblin was " [ t ] rue to his early years in the comic books " and was " handled with superb finesse " . Elliot noted that the storyline with Peter and Mary @-@ Jane going to the Fall Formal together made him nostalgic of the old comic books that had the pair involved , whereas current publications do not . Similar to Goldman , Elliot applauded the mystery of Goblin 's true identity , which he described as a " bait and switch . " 
 Writing for DVD Talk , Justin Felix wrote that " Catalyst " was a " fun episode - although the teen histrionics at the school dance are a bit much . " Ultimate Disney reviewer Luke Bonanno did not include the episode among his top five episodes of The Spectacular Spider @-@ Man 's first season , but " feel [ s ] obligated to point out that the uniform excellence of the lot [ makes ] this a challenging task .

 The Huguenot @-@ Walloon half dollar or Huguenot @-@ Walloon Tercentenary half dollar is a commemorative coin issued by the United States Bureau of the Mint in 1924 . It marks the 300th anniversary of the voyage of the Nieuw Nederland which landed in the New York area in 1624 . Many of the passengers were Huguenots who had lived in what is now Belgium , where they were known as Walloons ; they became early settlers of New York State and the surrounding area . 
 A commission run by the Federal Council of Churches in America sought issuance of a half dollar to mark the anniversary , and the bill passed through Congress without opposition in 1923 and was signed by President Warren G. Harding . Sketches were prepared by commission chairman Rev. John Baer Stoudt and converted to plaster models by the Mint 's aging chief engraver , George T. Morgan . The models were initially rejected by the Commission of Fine Arts , which required revisions under the supervision of Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser . 
 Of the 300 @,@ 000 coins authorized by Congress , fewer than half were actually struck , and of these , 55 @,@ 000 were returned to the Mint and released into circulation . The coin excited some controversy because of its sponsorship by a religious group . The choice of William the Silent and Gaspard de Coligny to appear on the obverse was also questioned as the men are considered martyrs by the Huguenots and died decades before the voyage of the Nieuw Nederlandt . The coins are currently valued in the hundreds of dollars , depending on condition .

 The Huguenots were French Protestants , who were often in conflict with the Catholic majority . Many Huguenots fled France in the 16th and 17th centuries , when there was intense persecution of them , most notably in the St. Bartholomew 's Day massacre of 1572 . Among those who fell in the rioting that day was the Huguenot military and political leader , Admiral Gaspard de Coligny . 
 Many Huguenots who fled France settled in what is today Belgium and have become known as Walloons . Others came to live in the Netherlands . William the Silent , the Prince of Orange was one of the leaders of the Dutch War of Independence against Spain . He was assassinated in 1584 by Balthasar Gérard , a pro @-@ Spanish extremist . Some Huguenots went elsewhere : on March 29 , 1624 , the ship Nieuw Nederlandt set out for New Netherland , the Dutch possessions centered on what is now the state of New York ; more ships followed . These were many of the early settlers of the area . In 1626 , Peter Minuit , the Director General for the Dutch West India Company , famously purchased the island of Manhattan from the Native Americans for goods worth some 60 guilders , often rendered as $ 24 . 
 The Huguenot @-@ Walloon New Netherland Commission was established in 1922 under the auspices of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America in anticipation of the upcoming anniversary . President Warren G. Harding was the honorary president of the commission , and Belgium 's King Albert I accepted an honorary chairmanship . The commission , led by its chairman , Rev. Dr. John Baer Stoudt , planned an observance for the 300th anniversary of the Nieuw Nederlandt voyage , and sought the issuance of commemorative stamps and coins . At the time , commemorative coins were not sold by the government — Congress , in authorizing legislation , designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase the coins at face value and vend them to the public at a premium . 
 = = Legislation = = 
 A bill for a Huguenot @-@ Walloon half dollar was introduced in the House of Representatives on January 15 , 1923 by Pennsylvania Congressman Fred Gernerd , who was of Huguenot descent . It received a hearing before the House Committee on Coinage , Weights , and Measures on February 7 , with Indiana Representative Albert Vestal , a Republican , presiding . Congressman Gernerd , of Huguenot descent , told the committee that there were plans to have local celebrations in 1924 to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the Huguenot voyage in cities where people of that heritage lived . Gernerd stated that while the sale of half dollars would raise money towards the observance , it was not intended as a serious fundraiser , but as a symbol of the occasion . He reminded the committee that the 300th anniversary of the voyage of the Mayflower had seen a half dollar issued . 
 Vestal stated that he could not support the bill as introduced because it did not designate who should order the coins , but Gernerd indicated that the Fifth National Bank of New York had agreed to act in that capacity . Stoudt appeared before the committee , explaining that his commission planned a design with the arrival of the New <unk> for one side , and for the other , Peter Minuit purchasing Manhattan from the Native Americans . New Jersey Congressman Ernest R. Ackerman briefly addressed the committee in support , noting that the coins would likely be retained as souvenirs , to the profit of the government . West Virginia 's Wells Goodykoontz also spoke in favor . The witnesses , all urging passage of the bill , concluded with a number of local pastors , led by E.O. Watson , secretary of the Federal Council of Churches . On February 10 , 1923 , Vestal issued a report recommending that the bill pass with an amendment adding the bank as the ordering organization . 
 A parallel bill was introduced into the Senate by Pennsylvania 's David A. Reed on January 29 , 1923 and was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency . It was reported favorably on February 9 by Pennsylvania 's George Pepper , and the Senate passed the bill without objection . The Senate @-@ passed bill was received by the House the following day and was referred to Vestal 's committee . On February 19 , the House considered its bill on the unanimous consent calendar . Gernerd asked that the Senate @-@ passed bill be substituted for the House bill ( the two were identical ) and when this was agreed , proffered an amendment to add the bank as the depository for the coins . Texas Congressman Thomas L. Blanton asked several questions about the bank 's interest , but subsided once he was told that it would receive no compensation and that President Harding was connected with the commission . The amended bill passed the House without objection . The following day , the Senate agreed to the House amendment , and the bill was enacted by Harding 's signature on February 26 , 1923 . The act provided for a maximum of 300 @,@ 000 half dollars .

 Stoudt supplied the concept for the coins , as well as sketches . Rather than seeking a private designer to produce plaster models , the Huguenot @-@ Walloon commission approached the Mint 's chief engraver , George T. Morgan , who turned 78 in 1923 . Morgan , best remembered for his 1878 design for the Morgan dollar , had been chief engraver since 1917 , following forty years as an assistant , mostly under Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber . Both Barber and Morgan felt that coins should be designed by the Mint 's engravers , and were sometimes hostile when private sculptors were engaged to do the work . 
 Morgan 's models were transmitted on October 26 , 1923 , to the Commission of Fine Arts , charged with rendering advisory opinions on coins by a 1921 executive order by President Harding . Morgan 's work was examined by sculptor member James Earle Fraser , designer of the Buffalo nickel . On November 19 , committee chairman Charles Moore wrote to Mint Director Robert J. Grant , " while the ideas intended to be expressed are excellent , the execution is bad . The lettering is poor , the heads are not well modeled and the ship is ill designed . The workmanship is below the standard of excellence attained in previous coins . The models are therefore not approved . " 
 After discussion , it was decided to allow Morgan to revise his model under Fraser 's supervision . Numismatists Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen noted , " [ This ] must have been doubly and <unk> humiliating in that Fraser 's initial was then adorning the current 5 ¢ nickel , while neither Barber 's nor Morgan 's was on any regular issue coinage then in production " . On January 3 , 1924 , Fraser wrote to Moore that the new models had been considerably improved , and complained that Vestal had advised the Huguenot @-@ Walloon commission to have the models made at the Mint as he had been told by its officials that private artists made models in a relief too high to be easily coined . " It seems to me perfectly disgusting that this inane and lying criticism should go on constantly " . The Fine Arts Commission approved the revised designs .

 The obverse features jugate busts of Admiral Gaspard de Coligny ( 1519 – 1572 ) and William the Silent , the Prince of Orange ( 1533 – 1584 ) . Neither had any direct involvement with the voyage of the Nieuw Nederlandt , having been killed forty years or longer before it . Both were Protestant leaders of the Reformation , and according to Swiatek , " their relationship with the 1624 founding was strictly spiritual in nature , " as the two are considered martyrs by Huguenots . The 1924 Report of the Director of the Mint explained that both were " leaders in the strife for civil and religious liberty " . Slabaugh , noting that the coin caused some controversy after it was issued , suggested that if the obverse had shown someone connected with the settlement of New Netherland , " chances are that the coin would have borne no religious significance and its promotion by the Churches of Christ in America would have been given little notice " . 
 The March 29 , 1924 edition of the Jesuit journal America contained an article by F.J. <unk> , who stated that the new coin " is more Protestant than the descriptions in the newspaper dispatches led us to believe " . He asserted that the two men featured on the coin were not killed for their religion and were anti @-@ Catholic : " the United States Government was duped into issuing this Huguenot half @-@ dollar so as to make a Protestant demonstration out of the tercentenary of the colonization of the State of New York " . The president of the Huguenot Society of North Carolina responded in a letter to the editor of The New York Times , " that Coligny and William the Silent were ' martyrs in the fight for religious liberty ' let the truth of history attest " . 
 The men have their names below the busts on the obverse , and wear hats of their period . They gaze toward the legend IN GOD WE TRUST , the only one of the national mottos usually present on U.S. coins to appear . The name of the country arcs above their heads , while HUGUENOT HALF DOLLAR is below them . Morgan 's initial " M " is on Coligny 's shoulder . The reverse depicts the ship Nieuw Nederlandt and the words , HUGUENOT – <unk> – <unk> – <unk> OF NEW <unk> with the years 1624 and 1924 to either side of the ship . Stoudt 's sketch for the reverse was also used on the one cent denomination of the stamp set issued in conjunction with the tercentenary . 
 Art historian Cornelius Vermeule noted that the half dollar was probably one of Morgan 's last works ( he died in January 1925 ) and that the coin " is a worthy conclusion to Morgan 's long career of distinguished and rich production , marked by imagination within the conservative framework and by a generally high level of appeal " . Vermeule stated that the Huguenot @-@ Walloon half dollar showed " that the die @-@ engravers trained in and around the Mint did have the ability to combine clear @-@ cut designs with considerable detail . "

 A total of 142 @,@ 080 Huguenot @-@ Walloon half dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint in February and April 1924 , with 80 of those pieces retained for inspection and testing by the 1925 Assay Commission . The Huguenot @-@ Walloon commission , to boost sales , engaged as distributor the man they considered to be the most prominent numismatist in the country , Moritz Wormser , president of the American Numismatic Association ( ANA ) . Wormser 's involvement , and the fact that Stoudt was an ANA member , led numismatist John F. Jones to deem this issue " the first instance we believe , where the coin fraternity has been consulted in the issue of a commemorative half dollar " . 
 The coins were sold to the public for $ 1 each through the Fifth National Bank and other outlets . Bulk sales were made to certain groups . The coins did not sell as well as expected , and 55 @,@ 000 were returned , after which they were placed in circulation . Relatively few are known in worn condition , causing author and coin dealer Q. David Bowers to conclude the public picked them out of pocket change . Money from the Huguenot @-@ Walloon half dollar was used towards a celebration in New York in May 1924 , during which the National Huguenot Memorial Church on Staten Island was dedicated . There was some debate in the pages of The Numismatist , the ANA 's journal , both as to whether William and Coligny should have appeared on the coin since they had nothing to do with the voyage , and whether the Churches of Christ should be allowed to sponsor a coin in view of the First Amendment 's prohibition of an establishment of religion . There was controversy in the press , which criticized the inclusion of William and Coligny as irrelevant to the commemoration and as religious propaganda . This in 1925 made politically infeasible the attempts of Minnesota Representative Ole Juulson Kvale , a Lutheran pastor , to obtain a coin for the Norse @-@ American Centennial ; he instead settled for a congressionally authorized medal . 
 Arlie R. Slabaugh , in his 1975 volume on commemoratives , noted that a <unk> die trial of the reverse in brass was made . Swiatek in 2012 stated that both obverse and reverse die trials are known . The edition of R.S. Yeoman 's A Guide Book of United States Coins published in 2015 lists the half dollar at between $ 130 and $ 650 depending on condition ; a near @-@ pristine specimen sold for $ 2 @,@ 115 in 2014 . 
 = Benefits Street = 
 Benefits Street is a British documentary series broadcast on Channel 4 . It was first aired on 6 January 2014 , and ran for five episodes . The show was filmed by documenting the lives of several residents of James Turner Street , Winson Green , Birmingham , England , where newspapers including the Daily Mail and The Guardian reported that 90 % of the residents claim benefits . It shows benefits claimants committing crimes , including a demonstration of how to shoplift , and portrays a situation in which people are dependent on welfare payments and lack the motivation to seek employment . 
 The show was controversial , with the police , Channel 4 and the media regulator Ofcom receiving hundreds of complaints . There were Twitter death threats made against the residents of the street . Channel 4 was accused of making poverty porn . Many of those taking part claimed that they were misled by the documentary makers . Ofcom launched an investigation into whether the programme had breached the broadcasting regulations , but ultimately concluded its rules had not been broken . 
 The producers of Benefits Street defended the series , arguing that the reaction to it demonstrated the importance of making such a documentary . The series was mentioned in the House of Commons , and prompted some political debate on the topic of welfare . A number of programmes were commissioned by other channels covering the same topic , while Channel 4 commissioned a follow up series provisionally titled Immigration Street that would follow the lives of immigrants living in the United Kingdom . Benefits Street gave Channel 4 their highest viewing figures for any show since 2012 . In August 2014 , Love Productions confirmed the second series of Benefits Street was being filmed in Kingston Road , Stockton @-@ on @-@ Tees . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 2012 , Love Productions approached the BBC with the idea for a programme that would feature a prominent member of the business community working with unemployed people , but the show did not come to fruition after the unnamed individual had to withdraw from it because of other commitments . The format for the series that would later become Benefits Street was then suggested , but the BBC declined to commission the series because it was producing a number of other programmes concerning similar issues , such as People Like Us and Nick and Margaret : We All Pay Your Benefits . Love Productions then suggested the format to Channel 4 , who agreed to commission the programme . 
 Writing in The Observer in January 2014 , Nick Mirsky , head of documentaries at Channel 4 , said that Love Productions intentionally selected an area where a high proportion of the residents were in receipt of welfare payments " to show the effect of benefit cuts on a community for whom they were the principal source of income " . The filming and production process took eighteen months . Both Mirsky , and Ralph Lee , Channel 4 's head of factual programming , said the residents of James Turner Street were consulted about the series before filming began . Cameras observed them over the course of a twelve @-@ month period . The decision to call the series Benefits Street was taken two weeks before the programme aired . The comedian Frank Skinner , who is from the West Midlands , was approached to narrate the documentary but turned it down because he had concerns about how people from Birmingham would be portrayed , and did not wish to criticise the city . The voice @-@ over was provided by former Coronation Street actor Tony Hirst instead . 
 The first episode of Benefits Street was aired at 9 : 00 pm on Monday 6 January 2014 , and ran for five episodes . A live one @-@ hour debate to discuss issues raised by the series was then scheduled to air after the final episode , Channel 4 announcing plans for this a few days after the second episode had been transmitted . During the week following the broadcasting of the third episode , West Midlands Police charged several James Turner Street residents with drugs @-@ related offences in connection with a raid their officers had carried out in June 2013 . Those facing charges included some people seen in episodes of the series . Channel 4 said they had no plans to alter any footage from the episodes yet to be transmitted . 
 On 23 January , the Birmingham Mail reported that items of Benefits Street branded merchandise , such as mugs and T @-@ shirts , were being produced for sale over the internet by individuals wishing to cash in on the programme . 
 = = = James Turner Street = = = 
 James Turner Street is a residential street of Victorian terraced houses in the Winson Green area of Birmingham . The street is in the city 's Soho Ward , part of the Ladywood constituency , and has a <unk> postcode . 
 It is first recorded in local records as Osborne Street in 1877 , and given its present name in 1882 . According to education historian Alison Wheatley , the street is possibly named after a James Turner who taught at King Edward 's School in Birmingham , and the name may have been suggested by a former pupil , who became a town planner , as a way of honouring Turner 's legacy . However , the Birmingham historian Carl Chinn believes the street was named for a local businessman and partner in the firm Hammond , Turner & Sons , a manufacturer of buttons . 
 Of Winson Green , Chinn writes that it was originally developed as a " better @-@ off working class district " , but that by the latter part of the 20th century many of the properties in the area were falling into decay . Dr Chris Upton , reader in public history at the city 's Newman University , has described the street as part of a " ribbon development " of suburban districts built as Birmingham expanded during the latter part of the 19th century . While many of the street 's original residents were locals who moved from the inner city back @-@ to @-@ back houses , some had moved from as far away as London and Cornwall to work in Birmingham . Upton describes them as " the respectable working class " — skilled workers who earned around 30 shillings ( £ 1 @.@ 50 ) per week , and who in many cases could even afford to employ a maid . Those who grew prosperous moved to wealthier areas , and were replaced by immigrants from Asia and the West Indies , who came to the UK during the years after World War II . A high proportion of those who lived in the area were employed by Birmingham 's industrial economy , which enjoyed prosperity until the collapse of the city 's manufacturing industry during the early 1980s , resulting in mass unemployment . Professor Steven McCabe of Birmingham City Business School has noted that Birmingham lost 200 @,@ 000 manufacturing jobs between 1971 and 1981 , and that the city 's GDP per capita , which in 1976 was the highest for a UK city outside the south east region , had fallen to become the lowest in England seven years later . 
 During the 1980s , unemployment in Birmingham reached 20 % , and McCabe says that in many areas , including James Turner Street , this figure has not reduced since that decade . Clare Short , who grew up in the area and represented Winson Green as Member of Parliament for Ladywood for 27 years , has said that along with high unemployment came a " new culture of drugs , crime and mental health problems . " On their website , Channel 4 have described James Turner Street as " one of Britain 's most benefits @-@ dependent streets " . Sources such as the Daily Mail and The Guardian reported in January 2014 that 90 % of the street 's residents are benefits claimants .

 Narrated by Tony Hirst , the series is presented in a fly on the wall documentary format that follows a year in the lives of the residents of James Turner Street , a road in the Winson Green area of Birmingham which Channel 4 describes as " one of Britain 's most benefit @-@ dependent streets " . The programme portrays a situation in which people are dependent on welfare payments , and often lack the motivation to find employment . Some residents are seen committing crimes such as shoplifting , and attempting to raise money to support themselves and their families . Others are shown to have more ambition , such as a young mother who wants to become a model . The series also aims to show the street 's sense of community spirit , with residents helping each other in times of difficulty .

 The programme led to some political debate on the issue of welfare . Speaking in the House of Commons on 13 January , Iain Duncan Smith , the Conservative Secretary of State for Work and Pensions , suggested the programme justified the changes being made by the Conservative – Liberal Democrat coalition government 's Welfare Reform Act . The following week , Duncan Smith gave a speech to mark the tenth anniversary of his Centre for Social Justice in which he said that areas of the country were being <unk> by long @-@ term unemployment and had remained largely hidden from the rest of society . Conservative MP Simon Hart raised the subject of Benefits Street at Prime Minister 's Questions on 15 January , saying that a street of the type seen in the series existed " in every constituency in the land " . Prime Minister and Conservative leader David Cameron responded that the government should " intervene in people 's lives " to get them off benefits and into employment . After declining an invitation to visit James Turner Street , Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg , leader of the Liberal Democrats , said that he believed both left- and right @-@ wing arguments on welfare were wrong . " We want a welfare system which is compassionate . " Shortly after Clegg 's comments , Birmingham councillor Desmond <unk> told the Birmingham Mail that he had compiled letters to Clegg , Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband on behalf of some James Turner Street residents inviting them to visit the street and asking for help to find employment . 
 Writing for the Wiltshire Gazette and Herald , the Liberal Democrat MP Duncan Hames argued that the programme would contribute little to the subject : " We do need to have a rational , informed debate about how to improve our welfare system , but the editorial line taken by supposedly factual ‘ reality TV ’ adds very little to that . " The programme was condemned by the current Ladywood MP , Labour 's Shabana Mahmood : " I found it shocking that Channel 4 or any other organisation would present poverty as entertainment . It was profoundly wrong . " In the Radio Times , Clare Short , who represented the constituency prior to Mahmood , said the series was " totally unrepresentative " of the area , and condemned it as " crummy and misleading " . Others have also criticised Benefits Street , arguing it does not present a balanced view of the subject . Labour MP Anne Begg , chair of the Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee , said that the programme was a " misrepresentation " of people claiming benefits , arguing that it focused on those claiming unemployment benefits which makes up a small proportion of the overall welfare bill . Referring to the first episode that featured a shoplifter , Chris Williamson ( also a Labour MP ) said it was " irresponsible " to portray him as a typical benefits claimant . Owen Jones , a columnist for The Independent , described the series as " medieval stocks updated for a modern format " . In an article for the Birmingham Mail , writer and television personality Samantha Brick , a native of Birmingham , said that the series was an " atrociously unbalanced " view of the city . Shadow Welfare Minister Chris Bryant claimed that the residents of The Bishop 's Avenue in Hampstead — known as Billionaire 's Row because of its expensive properties — were as likely to have drink and drugs problems as the residents of James Turner Street . 
 Fraser Nelson , editor of The Spectator , suggested the programme had highlighted a section of society who have been forgotten by the politicians : " These people are people who otherwise don ’ t have a voice . They don ’ t vote , so for many years they have just not mattered " . Nelson 's comments were echoed by Dominic <unk> in the Daily Mail , who felt the programme portrayed its participants sympathetically : " The real scandal of Benefits Street , in fact , is what it tells us about a welfare system that abandons thousands of people – through no fault of their own – to a life without hope or ambition , effectively turning them into an underclass , dependent on the charity of the State . " Charlie Brooker also felt the programme had been " broadly sympathetic " to those it portrays . In the Daily Mirror , entrepreneur John Bird , founder of The Big Issue , wrote that although Benefits Street did not fully represent the spectrum of people who claim benefits , it did show what could happen to those forgotten by the system " who get caught in a kind of social suicide " . 
 = = = = Benefits Britain : The Debate = = = = 
 A live one @-@ hour debate was scheduled to be broadcast by Channel 4 following the final episode of Benefits Street . Channel 4 announced on 16 January that this would be chaired by presenter Richard Bacon and feature a panel of guests who " represent the views across the political spectrum – and crucially those who claim benefits " . Mentorn Media , producers of programmes such as BBC One 's Question Time , was commissioned to produce the show . Originally scheduled for 10 February , the programme , titled Benefits Britain : The Debate , was subsequently moved back a week to 17 February after rival broadcaster Channel 5 announced plans for a two @-@ hour debate about immigration for the same evening . Channel 4 said Benefits Britain : The Debate would be immediately preceded by a follow @-@ up documentary , Benefits Street : The Last Word . The change was announced after many listings magazines had gone to press , a practice generally discouraged in the media industry . 
 Panelists for the programme were announced shortly before it aired , and included some Benefits Street participants , as well as Mike Penning , a minister from the Department of Work and Pensions , Chris Bryant from the opposition , Daily Telegraph columnist Allison Pearson , political editor of The Huffington Post Mehdi Hasan , and John Bird . Owen Jones , who also participated in the programme , described it as " a rowdy , chaotic show , based on the formula of " who shouts loudest " . " This view was echoed by Neil Midgley of The Telegraph , who felt that both follow @-@ up programmes " didn 't live up to [ the ] standards " of the series , and that the debate had " sparked a lot of shouting and tumult , but very little new wisdom " . The Independent 's Daisy Wyatt said the programme had " proved as rambling and unfocused as the documentary that sparked the hour @-@ long studio show , with ' neutral ' host Richard Bacon veering across topics and adding his own opinions Jeremy Kyle @-@ style . " Zoe <unk> of The Guardian found the debate " unsatisfactory " , feeling the topics discussed were too broad , and that Bacon was not an effective chair . However , Roz Laws of the Birmingham Mail described the debate as " articulate " and felt that " interesting points were made , such as the fact that most people on benefits are pensioners yet we didn 't see any of them on Benefits Street . " The debate was watched by an average audience of 3 @.@ 2 million .

 Channel 5 aired The Big Benefits Row : Live , their own unconnected debate about the welfare state , on 3 February . Presented by Matthew Wright , the show featured a panel of guests made up of Conservative MP Edwina Currie , reality television star Katie Hopkins , former London Mayor Ken Livingstone , broadcaster Terry Christian , former model Annabel Giles , and two people associated with James Turner Street — charity campaigner Rev. Steve Chalke and Dierdre Kelly , known in the series as White Dee . The programme was watched by 2 @.@ 1 million viewers . The Daily Express described it as a " heated debate " in which Hopkins was heavily critical of Kelly for claiming welfare , and of Giles 's modelling career . The Independent 's Jess Denham felt that Hopkins 's " larger @-@ than @-@ life personality " had dominated proceedings , while " fact @-@ based arguments were lost to the non @-@ stop barrage of immature tempers " . The Daily Mirror described it as " a mess of a programme and a joke of a discussion " .

 The first episode of the series attracted several hundred complaints both to Channel 4 and the media regulator Ofcom from viewers over a variety of issues . According to The Guardian , complaints were received about alleged criminal activities , foul language and misleading portrayals of welfare claimants . By 8 January 2014 , two days after the series debuted , Benefits Street had attracted 300 complaints to Ofcom and 400 to Channel 4 . Three weeks later that figure had collectively increased to 1 @,@ 700 . Ofcom said that it would assess the viewer feedback before deciding whether to launch an investigation . After generating a total of 960 complaints to Ofcom and 800 to Channel 4 , the broadcasting watchdog announced on 25 February that it would investigate the programme , an inquiry described by The Guardian as " Ofcom 's most high @-@ profile investigation into a TV programme since it cleared Channel 4 of unfair racial stereotyping in Big Fat Gypsy Weddings " . 
 Ofcom published its findings on 30 June , and concluded that Channel 4 had not breached broadcasting regulations . The watchdog looked at a number of issues raised by viewers , including concerns that rules governing child welfare had been broken , and that the programme featured " certain criminal techniques " . However , Ofcom concluded that Benefits Street had reflected the real lives of the children taking part , and Channel 4 had taken care to limit the amount of time they were seen on screen . Of the concerns about criminal activity , the watchdog said it was " satisfied that certain essential details were not broadcast which may have enabled the successful commission of a crime , and that there was a sufficient editorial justification for including the material broadcast . " The regulator also concluded that the programme had been fair in its portrayal of its participants because it was an observational documentary , and that almost 900 complaints about the " negative and offensive portrayal " needed no further investigation . 
 = = = = Other public responses = = = = 
 Following the first episode of Benefits Street , West Midlands Police said they had received a number of complaints from members of the public about alleged criminal activities that had been filmed , which they were considering whether to investigate . Alleged death threats by Twitter users against the residents were also being probed . Channel 4 said they would not provide investigators with any unbroadcast material from Benefits Street unless issued with a court order to do so . 
 The Birmingham Mail reported on 9 January that the programme had attracted an influx of tourists to the street , who wished to have their picture taken by the James Turner Street road sign . Police advised visitors to stay away . Steve Chalke , founder of the Oasis Academy Foundry , a charity that runs a primary school in James Turner Street , subsequently said that visitors had disrupted activity at the school and that he was preparing a complaint for Ofcom . Shortly afterwards , he submitted a letter to the watchdog alleging that children had been subject to public harassment because of the programme , and that Ofcom 's rules regarding the welfare of those under the age of majority had been breached . On 13 February , newspapers , including the Daily Mirror and Daily Star , reported the theft of the James Turner Street road sign from outside the school . 
 An online petition calling for Channel 4 to cancel the remaining episodes was launched , attracting 3 @,@ 000 signatures by 8 January . A total of 60 @,@ 000 people had signed it by the time the series ended on 10 February . The trade union Unite organised a protest at the offices of Love Productions on the afternoon of 13 January . A group of 30 people attended . 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 Several James Turner Street residents have claimed they were tricked into appearing in the series by Love Productions , who they say told them it would be about community spirit . One resident told the Birmingham Mail , " They told me it was about living as a community and how we all got along . But the actual programme doesn 't show any of that . If they had said it was about benefits and making the street look bad I would not have taken part . They tricked us . " Responding to allegations the residents were duped , Nick Mirsky said that Love Productions had spent much time consulting the residents before filming began , and that process continued afterwards : " Key contributors have been offered viewings of the programmes during the editing period and were given the opportunity to comment on them . Both Love and Channel 4 listened to any concerns raised , and in some cases made changes to the programme to accommodate them . " Dierdre Kelly , however , subsequently told ITV 's This Morning that she believed the programme had provided a one @-@ sided view of her community , and that the residents " went into the show naively " . Gareth Price of The Guardian suggested the show 's producers " adeptly edited their film in order to provoke a response from its intended audience " . 
 Sources including The Independent and Broadcast reported that several commentators had accused Channel 4 of making " poverty porn " . In response , Ralph Lee refuted those accusations during a debate on the 9 January edition of BBC Two 's Newsnight programme : " It ’ s inaccurate and it ’ s patronising towards the people that take part in these programmes and open up their lives , and it ’ s quite offensive to the people who make them . " Mirsky claimed the reaction to Benefits Street demonstrated how it had " touched a nerve " and subsequently proved it was " essential " the series was made . The boss of Love Productions , Richard McKerrow , also defended the series , saying it was not about " demonising the poor ... It ’ s a very honest and true portrayal of life in Britain and people are frightened of it . " Writing as the series concluded , The Daily Telegraph 's Neil Midgley felt that Benefits Street had not exploited its participants , and was " definitely the kind of series that Channel 4 should be making : easy to grasp and innovative , and yet a blinding revelation of some ills that are at the heart of modern Britain . " Midgley 's view was echoed by Jay Hunt , Channel 4 's chief creative officer , who described the series as " a perfect Channel 4 show [ because ] It engaged a huge audience and got millions of people thinking about the welfare state and people at the bottom of society . " 
 Emma Johnson , the head teacher of the Oasis school , organised a public meeting on the evening of 15 January to discuss issues raised by the programme . The event was attended by around 100 residents from the area . BBC journalist David Lumb said reporters were not allowed to take pictures , and those present felt the occasion was " an opportunity to preach a political agenda " . The meeting was told that an employed couple who were filmed for the series were dropped from the final version . Love Productions said this was because the show was about people on benefits , and one of the unnamed pair was a benefits officer . 
 After the third episode was televised on 20 January , the Daily Mail reported that community leaders and residents had accused Channel 4 of exploiting children , claiming it had led to the children featured in the documentary becoming targets for bullying . In response , a Channel 4 spokeswoman said that consent from parents and guardians , and the children themselves was obtained before filming began " in accordance with the relevant sections of the Ofcom broadcasting code . Any children without consent have been blurred in programmes . " 
 The Birmingham Mail reported on 10 February that figures released to the newspaper by Birmingham City Council 's fraud investigation service indicated instances of benefit fraud in the city were lower than had been suggested by the documentary , with 851 prosecutions in the five years preceding 2014 , an average of 0 @.@ 5 % of total benefit claimants . Furthermore , of the 152 @,@ 000 housing benefit claimants in Birmingham , 178 were prosecuted for fraudulent claims in 2013 .

 Overnight figures indicated the show 's first episode attracted 4 @.@ 3 million viewers and a 17 @.@ 7 % share of viewing , more than any Channel 4 show in the whole of 2013 . The second instalment , aired on 13 January , saw an increase of almost a million viewers to 5 @.@ 1 million , a 20 @.@ 8 % share of the audience and beating ITV 's The Bletchley Circle and an edition of Panorama on BBC One and its own former show Celebrity Big Brother ( now on Channel 5 ) which aired in the same time slot .

The fourth episode attracted fewer viewers , however , with an average of 4 @.@ 1 million , and was behind the first part of Jeremy Paxman 's World War I documentary series Britain 's Great War , which aired on BBC One and had an average viewership of 4 @.@ 23 million .

 As the first series of Benefits Street came to a close on 10 February 2014 , Love Productions confirmed to the Birmingham Mail that it was investigating potential locations for a second series , but that this would not be filmed in Birmingham . On 11 March , the Liverpool Echo reported that a number of residents on a street in Birkenhead had been approached to appear in a second series , but did not wish to take part . Channel 4 subsequently confirmed the programme would not be filmed in Birkenhead . In April , the Teesside Evening Gazette reported similar approaches had been made to a number of people living in the Middlesbrough area , while The Northern Echo reported that " two young women , both dressed down in leggings and jumpers but with cut @-@ glass southern accents [ and describing ] themselves as TV producers " were attempting to persuade residents of a street in Stockton @-@ on @-@ Tees to take part . The Evening Gazette reported on 21 May that residents in Stockton had chased and thrown eggs at researchers when they made a return visit to a street in the town . In April , The Guardian reported that Love Productions were " [ facing ] opposition from politicians and community leaders " in their attempt to secure participants for the series . In the same article , Kieran Smith , Executive Producer of Love Productions , conceded that the controversy surrounding the series had made it more difficult to find locations for future programmes , but hoped " to settle on somewhere soon " . 
 Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live on 16 April , Smith confirmed plans for a follow @-@ up series provisionally titled Immigration Street that would focus on immigration issues , but said Channel 4 were yet to commission the programme . However , the Southern Daily Echo reported that some filming had already taken place in an area of Southampton , where city leaders had voiced their opposition to the series . Simon Letts of Southampton City Council expressed concerns the programme could lead to racial tension , while the area 's Member of Parliament , Alan Whitehead , suggested it " would follow a set script as opposed to accurately portraying reality " . On 11 July 2014 , Channel 4 confirmed that the series , provisionally titled Immigration Street , would be filmed in Derby Road , in the <unk> area of Southampton . After protests from local residents , the planned series was reduced to a single episode which aired on 24 February 2015 . On 26 August 2014 , Love Productions also confirmed that a second series of Benefits Street was being filmed in Kingston Road , Stockton @-@ on @-@ Tees . Alex Cunningham , the Labour MP for Stockton North said he was " deeply disappointed " that the series was being filmed there . 
 On 12 February 2014 , Channel 5 confirmed to Broadcast magazine that it was in the process of filming a similar documentary , provisionally titled Living on the Social , in which individuals and families would discuss their lives on welfare . The Hull Daily Mail reported in March that Channel 5 were looking at Hull as a potential location for the series , but that the city council had urged residents not to participate . The Yorkshire Post reported a similar approach to residents in Bridlington in April . Love Productions also announced plans for Famous , Rich and Hungry , a two @-@ part documentary for the BBC 's Sport Relief that would see celebrities spending time with families experiencing food poverty in order to explore the issue . 
 = Shin Megami Tensei : Nine = 
 Shin Megami Tensei : Nine ( Japanese : 真 ・ 女神転生 <unk> , lit . " True Goddess Reincarnation : Nine " ) is a Japanese role @-@ playing video game developed by Atlus and <unk> for the Xbox , and published by Atlus on December 5 , 2002 . 
 Forming part of the Megami Tensei series , Nine takes place in the period of time between Shin Megami Tensei and its sequel , with the survivors of Tokyo 's destruction sheltering in underground bunkers . Taking on the role of a debugger , the player navigates the Idea Space virtual world set up by the survivors of Tokyo 's destruction , which has come under attack by demonic beings called " noise " . The gameplay has the player navigating a customized avatar in third @-@ person through the virtual world of Tokyo , battling enemies using a real @-@ time command @-@ based battle system . The game 's title refers to the number of possible moral alignments available to players . 
 Shin Megami Tensei : Nine began development in 2001 , following staff discussions about how to make an online Shin Megami Tensei game . It was the first Megami Tensei title for Xbox , and the first to fully utilize 3D graphics . Established Megami Tensei staff worked on the project , such as producer Kouji Okada and demon designer Kazuma Kaneko . Newcomers to the project included character designer Yasuomi Umetsu , and composers Masaki Kurokawa and Takahiro Ogata . While Nine was originally planned as an online game , it was split into single @-@ player and online versions ; the latter was cancelled following development difficulties . The single @-@ player release met with mixed reception from critics , and sold below Atlus ' estimates ; its commercial failure coupled with development costs contributed to a financial loss . Development of the online version continued as a port for Microsoft Windows , which would eventually become Shin Megami Tensei : Imagine . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Shin Megami Tensei : Nine is a role @-@ playing video game primarily set in a cyberspace version of 1990s Tokyo , with players taking control of the silent main protagonist to explore various environments within Tokyo 's districts , along with switching between different districts with a dedicated fast @-@ travel menu . The player can adjust the protagonist 's name , gender , hair and skin color . Navigation through environments is presented through a third @-@ person perspective , with the player character being followed by one assigned demon . While navigating safe areas , players can enter shops to buy new equipment and items such as healing potions , and change their character 's clothing and hairstyle . 
 Combat is triggered through random encounters in environments such as dungeons . Combat in Nine plays out as a real @-@ time combat in an enclosed battle arena : while the battle continues automatically without direct interaction from the player , commands can be issued to party members to perform actions when their turn comes . In addition to specific commands , general offensive or defensive stances can be issued . Battles do not reward experience points as in other Megami Tensei games : instead , equipped jewels affect the protagonist 's strengths and stats . As with previous Megami Tensei games , players can negotiate with demons and get them to join their party . Demons can also be fused together to create more powerful demons . The attitudes of demons towards the player changes depending on the current moon phase . The number of demons the player can summon depends on the player 's and the demon 's " kilodevil " values : a player with 100 kilodevil can summon two 50 @-@ kilodevil demons . The player can compress their demons by visiting the Cathedral of Shadows , halving the demons ' kilodevil values and allowing the player to summon more demons . 
 At certain points in the game , the player also enters a " hacking " mode , which players out in a real @-@ time strategy simulation : the protagonist and their companions navigate within closed arenas along pre @-@ set pathways , knocking out nodes blocking the path , and defending against protection bots attempting to stop them . As the player progresses through the game , the character makes dialogue choices that are mapped across a three @-@ by @-@ three alignment matrix : three " down " ( Law , Neutral and Chaos ) , and three " across " ( Light , Neutral and Dark ) . The protagonist 's current alignment not only influences the story , but also the loyalty and responsiveness of demon party members . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 Nine is set in the year " <unk> " , taking place during the latter half of Shin Megami Tensei and in the time leading up to its sequel Shin Megami Tensei II . In the wake of the ICBM attack on Tokyo , communities of survivors now live in underground cities . In the face of their predicament , the underground inhabitants create " Idea Space " , a virtual world based on Tokyo from the 1990s . The protagonist , named Kei Azuma by default , is exploring the virtual world when " Noise " , digitized demons hostile to humans , appear and begin attacking Idea Space players through their avatars . After fending off an attack , Azuma is employed by the Central Administration Bureau as a Debugger , a player who traverses Idea Space and repels Noise invasions . During their missions through Idea Space , Azuma meets with multiple characters : <unk> / Sumire , a childhood friend who represents " Chaos " , <unk> / Miranda , a representative from the Central Administration Bureau who represents " Law " . While going through their duty as a Debugger , the events of the latter half of Shin Megami Tensei take place , which culminate in all parts of Tokyo being destroyed in a Great Flood triggered by the God @-@ worshipping Order of Messiah : Azuma survives due to their body being in cold storage , meaning that their mind becomes linked to Idea Space along with their Law and Chaos allies . 
 During a mission into the virtual Shibuya 109 against the Noise demon Abaddon , the true origins of Idea Space are revealed . Idea Space was created by humans tired of awaiting the arrival of their " Messiah " in the real world : hoping to bring about salvation through technology , the humans created the Idea Space , and generated Maria as its goddess and administrator to further the creation of Millennial Kingdom by manipulating its users . On their mission into Shibuya 109 , Azuma retrieves a Desire Disc , an artifact containing the saved desires of humanity that is the key to both side 's plans . Azuma is faced with choices about which faction to support . The Law faction , supported by Maria , wishes to bring peace to humanity along with releasing the Idea Space 's inhabitants . The Chaos faction , which can be led by Lucifer if he is freed from his prison within a metaphysical plain called the Expanse , intends to destroy the inhabitants of Idea Space and start anew with the chosen Adam and Eve : Azuma and the Chaos companion . To fulfill any of their chosen roles , Azuma must defeat Yaldabaoth , the controller of Idea Space who is keeping the system going and will not allow either Maria or Lucifer to carry out their plans . 
 In both the Law and Chaos routes , with the defeat of the Yaldabaoth , the entire Idea Space is emptied of avatars besides Azuma . Upon returning to the real world , they are on the surface with either their Law or Chaos companion , with the <unk> @-@ built Tokyo Millennium in the background : depending on the alignment , Azuma either goes to reinforce the Law @-@ based regime , or to begin a new Chaos @-@ based humanity outside it . In the " Neutral " routes , Azuma performs tasks for a mysterious woman minding a store in Idea Space : the woman is the goddess Sophia , who was forced to reincarnate as a human for the sin of birthing Yaldabaoth : she has been helping Azuma towards defeating Yaldabaoth to atone for her sin and ascend . Azuma defeats both Yaldabaoth and Maria , allowing Sophia to become her true self and ascend , leaving the fate of those within Idea Space ambiguous .

 Shin Megami Tensei : Nine was primarily developed by Atlus , the main developer for the Megami Tensei series . The game received additional development help from <unk> , a company that would later be rebranded as Nex Entertainment and work on games such as Shining Soul and Children of Mana . The game 's CGI cutscenes were developed with help from <unk> Entertainment . Nine was produced by long @-@ time Megami Tensei producer Kouji Okada , directed by Kazunori Sakai , and written by Nobutaka Shimizu . Kazuma Kaneko , a regular designer for the series , returned to design new demons for the title . Many of them , such as the character Maria , proved challenging for him due to his past work mainly involving creating depictions of God and Lucifer as opposed to goddess @-@ like figures . He also found making them move convincingly in the new 3D environment problematic . Kaneko suggested that a new artist be brought on as a collaborator on the project , so Yasuomi Umetsu was hired to design the game 's main characters . This was part of an attempt to distinguish Nine from previous Megami Tensei games . 
 The concept for Nine originated during staff discussions about how Shin Megami Tensei would work as an online title . Development started at some point in 2001 , and was still in its early stages of development in October of that year . During its early stages , the game was known as Shin Megami Tensei Online . Although the team had the option of making <unk> an online @-@ exclusive title , Okada wanted a single @-@ player mode to introduce players to the workings and world of the game . A part of the planned online component was teaming up with or fighting different players depending on their alignment . Nine is not the ninth game in Shin Megami Tensei series ; the title refers to the number of moral alignments that are available in the Shin Megami Tensei games . The decision to create a nine @-@ tiered alignment system was because Okada wanted to explore the original game 's moral alignments in more detail . This was also the reason why the game was set between Shin Megami Tensei and its sequel . The setting was directly based on Tokyo 's Shinjuku , Shibuya and Ikebukuro districts . The game was the first Megami Tensei title developed for the Xbox ; the first to switch over to a third @-@ person camera perspective from the first @-@ person perspectives of earlier Megami Tensei titles ; the first to feature a customizable player avatar ; and one of the first of Atlus ' titles to fully utilize 3D graphics , something previously accomplished to a lesser degree by Maken X for the Dreamcast and its PlayStation 2 ( PS2 ) successor Maken Shao : Demon Sword . Okada described the development process as " challenging " , with developing the new real @-@ time battle system being a large part of that challenge . Two prevalent issues were adjusting the balance of the battle system , and incorporating the second tactical system for the hacking segments . 
 The game 's sound and music were handled by Takahiro Ogata , Masaki Kurokawa and Kenichi Tsuchiya : Ogata acted as sound director . To accurately create the sound of modern @-@ day Tokyo within Nine , Ogata and Kurokawa went to districts such as Kichijōji and Roppongi to make recordings of ambient sounds at different times of day . While there was a general theme for various city districts , the music subtly changed depending on the player 's overall alignment : for instance , to represent the Law and Chaos alignments in the game , piano was used for the former and guitar for the latter . Battle music also featured randomly @-@ generated soundtrack variations , with Ogata estimating somewhere over three hundred possible variants on battle themes . A major improvement enabled by the Xbox was the use of 5 @.@ 1 surround sound , which could enable richer use of both music and in @-@ game sound effects . According to Okada , this additional sound capacity would compensate for what could not be managed at a visual level . Maken X had already given the team a chance to use 3D sound , but Nine was the first title to make major use of 5 @.@ 1 , and implementing it alongside all the other features proved a challenge for the team .

 Nine was originally announced in August 2001 under the title Shin Megami Tensei Online . Originally rumored to be for the PS2 , its announced features included use of voice recognition and online broadband services . These features would later be clarified as being planned for online implementation rather than in development . After a long period of media silence , its official title was announced in February 2002 . Nine was heavily promoted at multiple Japanese gaming events throughout 2002 . The game released on December 5 , 2002 : it was celebrated with an official launch event attended by Okada and Kaneko . A Deluxe Edition released simultaneously with the standard edition , containing a figurine of Maria and a keycard related to accessing online content . The game was later re @-@ released as part of Microsoft 's Platinum Collection budget collection on October 23 , 2003 . A novelization , written by Takumi Miyajima and with a cover illustration by Kaneko , was published by Fujimi Shobo on March 25 , 2003 . A comics anthology was released by Enterbrain on March 24 . 
 After the 2002 Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) , it was stated by Atlus that while the small size of the game 's online component did not rule out a Western release , Atlus themselves were unable to finance a dedicated server and other companies such as Microsoft were unlikely to provide such funding . The following year at E3 2003 , Atlus responded with " no comment " when asked whether Nine would see a Western release . In 2006 , Atlus stated that there were no plans to bring Nine overseas , with their focus being on newer Megami Tensei titles . 
 The online functions planned for Nine were intended to be incorporated from release , but in August 2002 , Atlus announced that they would divide the game in two parts : one stand @-@ alone offline version , and one online version . The reason given for this was that the development team did not have enough time to integrate all online functions they wanted to include in the game , and that Atlus did not want to delay the game 's release . Atlus planned to release the online version in 2002 , but put development on hold due to the high costs of developing an online game , and postponed the release until 2003 . In August 2003 , they announced that they no longer had any plans to publish the online version for Xbox , due to problems relating to network @-@ based development and the profitability of online games . With the cancellation of the Xbox Live version , development continued on a version of Nine for Microsoft Windows personal computers ( PCs ) . This version formed the base for what would become Shin Megami Tensei : Imagine , a massively multiplayer online role @-@ playing game for PCs developed by Cave and released in Japan and Western regions across 2007 and 2009 . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Despite the heavy promotion it received , upon release the game only reached # 18 in the Dengeki charts with initial sales of 14 @,@ 000 units . Its sales continued to fall and within three weeks the game had dropped out of the Dengeki Top 50 . By the end of the year , Nine had sold just over 30 @,@ 000 . According to Atlus , the game 's sales by the end of the 2002 @-@ 2003 fiscal year had reached 45 @,@ 000 units : this fell below their planned sales number of 67 @,@ 000 units . In May , Atlus announced that the development costs and poor sales of Xbox games , including Nine , had resulted in a financial loss for that year . 
 The four reviewers for Famitsu gave it respective scores of 9 , 8 , 7 and 7 . On the positive side , demon fusion and negotiation being cited as " addictive " , and two of the reviewers lauded the shift into 3D graphics . On the negative side , aspects of the battle system was seen as convoluted or confusing , while other elements such as a confusing interface and the conspicuous lack of online functions brought the experience down . One reviewer also noted that the game was geared towards those who had already played Shin Megami Tensei . RPGFan 's John McCarrol was positive in his early preview despite not knowing much about the promised online functions , saying that despite some bland visuals Nine promised to be " one of the best Xbox games released in Japan and possibly North America " . Kurt Kalata and Christopher J. Snelgrove , writing for gaming website Hardcore Gaming 101 , had mixed feelings about the title , finding its visuals dull and gameplay system unimpressive . Due to the ultimate lack of online functionality , they also commented that Nine felt " weirdly incomplete " , saying that it was " not really worth tracking down " for series fans . 
 = Battle of Albuera = 
 The Battle of Albuera ( 16 May 1811 ) was a battle during the Peninsular War . A mixed British , Spanish and Portuguese corps engaged elements of the French Armée du Midi ( Army of the South ) at the small Spanish village of Albuera , about 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) south of the frontier fortress @-@ town of Badajoz , Spain . 
 From October 1810 Marshal Masséna 's Army of Portugal had been tied down in an increasingly hopeless stand @-@ off against Wellington 's Allied forces , safely entrenched in and behind the Lines of Torres Vedras . Acting on Napoleon 's orders , in early 1811 Marshal Soult led a French expedition from Andalusia into Extremadura in a bid to draw Allied forces away from the Lines and ease Masséna 's plight . Napoleon 's information was outdated and Soult 's intervention came too late ; starving and understrength , Masséna 's army was already withdrawing to Spain . Soult was able to capture the strategically important fortress at Badajoz on the border between Spain and Portugal from the Spanish , but was forced to return to Andalusia following Marshal Victor 's defeat in March at the Battle of Barrosa . However , Soult left Badajoz strongly garrisoned . In April , following news of Masséna 's complete withdrawal from Portugal , Wellington sent a powerful Anglo @-@ Portuguese corps commanded by Sir William Beresford to retake the border town . The Allies drove most of the French from the surrounding area and began the Siege of Badajoz . 
 Soult rapidly gathered a new army from the French forces in Andalusia and , joining with the troops retreating before Beresford , he marched to relieve the siege . With intelligence of another approaching force — a Spanish army under Gen. Joaquín Blake — he planned to turn Beresford 's flank and interpose his army between the two . However , Soult was again acting on outdated information ; unknown to the Marshal , the Spaniards had already linked up with the Anglo @-@ Portuguese corps , and his 24 @,@ 000 troops now faced a combined Allied army 35 @,@ 000 strong . 
 The opposing armies met at the village of Albuera . Both sides suffered heavily in the ensuing struggle and the French finally withdrew on 18 May . Beresford 's army was too battered and exhausted to pursue , but was able to resume the investment of Badajoz . Despite Soult 's failure to relieve the town , the battle had little strategic effect on the war . Just one month later , in June 1811 , the Allies were forced to abandon their siege by the approach of the reconstituted French Armies of Portugal and Andalusia . 
 = = Background = = 
 Despite his victory over elements of Marshal André Masséna 's Army of Portugal at the Battle of Bussaco in September 1810 , Viscount Wellington was forced by Masséna 's subsequent maneuvering to withdraw his numerically inferior force behind the extensive series of fortifications he had prepared around Torres Vedras to protect the approaches to Lisbon . By 10 October 1810 only the British light division and some cavalry patrols remained outside the " Lines " . Wellington manned the fortifications with " secondary troops " — 25 @,@ 000 Portuguese militia , 8 @,@ 000 Spaniards and 2 @,@ 500 British marines and artillerymen — keeping his main field army of British and Portuguese regulars dispersed in order to rapidly meet a French assault on any point of the Lines . 
 Masséna 's Army of Portugal concentrated around Sobral , apparently in preparation to attack . However , after a fierce skirmish on 14 October in which the strength of the Lines became apparent , the French dug themselves in rather than launch a costly full @-@ scale assault . They remained entrenched for a month before falling back to a position between Santarém and Rio Maior . Following Masséna 's withdrawal , Wellington moved the 2nd Division under Lt. Gen. Hill , along with two Portuguese brigades and an attachment of Dragoons , across the Tagus to protect the plains of Alentejo — both from Masséna and a possible attack from Andalusia by the French Army of the South . 
 Napoleon had previously sent dispatches to Marshal Soult , commander of the Army of the South , urging him to send assistance to Masséna . The Emperor 's orders were based on outdated intelligence and called for only a small force ; by the time Soult received them the situation had changed considerably . Soult now knew a successful attack against Lisbon was beyond his means with the forces proposed — there were 30 @,@ 000 Allied troops and six major fortresses between his army and the Portuguese capital — but he had received orders nonetheless and felt obliged to do something . He therefore gathered an army of 20 @,@ 000 men , mainly from V Corps , and launched an expedition into Extremadura with the limited aim of capturing the fortress at Badajoz and hopefully drawing some of the Allied forces away from their impregnable positions in the Lines . Along with V Corps , this venture also pulled both infantry and cavalry from Marshal Victor 's I Corps who were besieging Cádiz at the time . Soult ordered more of Victor 's men to fill the gaps left by his use of V Corps ; this was bitterly opposed by Victor since it severely weakened his own forces , leaving him with only 15 @,@ 000 men besieging a city garrisoned by around 26 @,@ 000 Allied troops . 
 Following a successful campaign in Extremadura , on 27 January 1811 Soult began his investment of Badajoz . Almost immediately the Spanish Army of Extremadura arrived in the vicinity with some 15 @,@ 000 troops under the command of Gen. Mendizabal . Soult 's army , too small to surround Badajoz , was unable to prevent 3 @,@ 000 of Mendizabal 's men from reinforcing the fortress and the remainder occupying the heights of San Cristóbal . This posed a major threat to the French , so Soult moved at once to engage . In the ensuing Battle of the Gebora the French inflicted 1 @,@ 000 casualties on the Spanish field army and took 4 @,@ 000 prisoners , at a cost to themselves of only 400 casualties . The remnants of Mendizabal 's defeated army fled towards Badajoz or into Portugal . 
 The garrison of Badajoz , ably commanded by Gen. Rafael Menacho , initially put up strong resistance and by 3 March the French had made little progress against the powerful fortress . On that day , however , Menacho was killed on the ramparts by a chance shot ; command of the garrison fell to Brig. Gen. José Imaz and the Spanish defense started to slacken . The walls were finally breached on 10 March . Soult was anxious to press the siege since he had learned that Masséna , in command of a disintegrating army plagued by sickness , starvation and an unusually harsh Portuguese winter , had retreated from Portugal . Concerned that the British would now be free to send a contingent to relieve Badajoz , Soult sent a deputation into the town to demand the garrison 's surrender . Imaz duly capitulated and the French took possession of the fortress on 11 March . 
 On 12 March , news of Victor 's defeat at the Battle of Barrosa reached Soult and he left Badajoz to return to Andalusia , anxious that the siege of Cádiz had been lifted . Reaching Seville on 20 March he was relieved to find that Victor 's siege lines still held and Andalusia remained under French control . Before his departure Soult had consolidated his gains in Extremadura by garrisoning Badajoz with 11 @,@ 000 French troops under the command of Marshal Édouard Mortier . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 With no political considerations to get in the way , the Allies soon learnt of Soult 's investment of Badajoz , and with the threat from Masséna diminished by his withdrawal towards Spain , Wellington prepared to send his 2nd and 4th divisions ( now under the command of General William Beresford ) to relieve the siege . The orders were first issued on 8 March , but countermanded the next day due to false reports of Masséna offering battle at Tomar . Following further delays as Beresford 's two divisions regrouped , the relieving force were ordered to hurry to Badajoz on 15 March . Around this time though , Wellington received news of the town 's surrender ; the urgency had diminished and Beresford 's expedition could proceed at a more moderate pace . 
 = = = Mortier keeps busy = = = 
 Marshal Édouard Mortier , commanding the Badajoz garrison , made good use of the Allied delays . Leaving six battalions to hold the fortress , in early March he moved against the nearby Portuguese town of Campo Maior with around 7 @,@ 000 men and three batteries borrowed from the siege @-@ train stationed at Badajoz . The French captured the outlying Fort São João on 14 March ( the night of their arrival ) but the Campo Maior fortress proved a harder proposition . Despite being manned by only 800 militia and <unk> , commanded by Major José <unk> , the town held out for seven days — surrendering only when an entire face of the bastion crumbled under the bombardment from Mortier 's artillery . Mortier also sent two cavalry regiments under General Marie Victor Latour @-@ Maubourg to invest Alburquerque ; the 6 @,@ 000 strong garrison there surrendered before French reinforcements needed to be brought up . 
 Major <unk> 's prolonged defence of Campo Maior gave Beresford 's divisions time to arrive before the captured fortress had been slighted . On returning to Badajoz after his successful foray into Portugal , Mortier had left one infantry and three cavalry regiments at Campo Maior , under Latour @-@ Maubourg , to dismantle its defences ; Beresford 's appearance on 25 March caught the French by surprise . However , despite the Allies having 18 @,@ 000 troops at their disposal , Latour @-@ Maubourg calmly formed up his command and retreated towards Badajoz . Beresford sent 1 @,@ 500 cavalry , under the command of Brigadier General Robert Long after the French . Most of the French cavalry were driven off by a charge of the 13th Light Dragoons ; however , the pursuit of Latour @-@ Maubourg 's force then faltered . It was poorly co @-@ ordinated and the greater part of the French force managed to reach the safety of Badajoz . The reason behind this failure was subsequently disputed between supporters of Brigadier Long and General Beresford .

 Beresford now began the task of positioning his army to invest Badajoz , but a series of mishaps delayed the Allied advance into Spain . The Guadiana , a major river of Spain and Portugal that delineates part of the border , lay across Beresford 's line of march . Wellington had promised a stock of Spanish pontoon boats so that a bridge could be erected , but these were not forthcoming . Instead , a bridge had to be fashioned in situ — a task that would take until 3 April to complete . Furthermore , the rations promised to Beresford , to be taken from the town of <unk> , had been consumed by the remnants of Mendizabal 's Army of Extremadura , which had settled in the region following their defeat by Soult at the start of the year . Beresford 's troops eventually had to draw on rations from the fortress @-@ town of Elvas in order to feed themselves . Finally , the shoes of the 4th Division had completely worn out following two weeks of marching , and replacements from Lisbon would take a week to arrive . These delays gave the Badajoz garrison time to work on the fortifications , taking them from a state of serious disrepair on 25 March to being tenable on 3 April . Beresford began to bring his army forward on 4 April , but a sudden flood swept away his makeshift bridge across the Guadiana , trapping the Allied vanguard on the eastern bank . This could have proved disastrous for Beresford , but Mortier had been recalled to Paris leaving Latour @-@ Maubourg in command at Badajoz , and he was more concerned with repairing the fortress 's defences than confronting the Allied army . After a minor success involving the capture of an entire squadron of the 13th Light Dragoons , Latour @-@ Maubourg retired before Beresford 's superior forces , leaving 3 @,@ 000 men garrisoning Badajoz and 400 in Olivenza . 
 By 8 April new bridges had been thrown across the Guadiana and the following day Beresford 's army moved to Olivenza ; they were now over the border and 24 kilometres ( 15 mi ) south of Badajoz . While the British 4th Division tackled the small French garrison there , the main Allied army followed Latour @-@ Maubourg south while sending covering forces to watch the Badajoz garrison from Valverde and Albuera . Beresford coordinated his movements with the remnants of the Spanish Army of Extremadura ( now under the command of General Castaños ) , adding 3 @,@ 000 infantry and 1 @,@ 000 cavalry to his strength . On 15 April , Olivenza fell to the 4th Division , which technically put Beresford in a position to commence the more important task of besieging Badajoz . However , neither Beresford nor Wellington had provided a siege @-@ train for the expedition , so one had to be improvised on the spot . The solution adopted was to take sufficient artillery pieces of various qualities and vintages from the fortress of Elvas , but this expedient caused yet another delay in Allied progress . Beresford took the opportunity presented by this delay to have his forces clear southern Extremadura of French forces and Latour @-@ Maubourg was pushed back to Guadalcanal . Beresford left his cavalry and a brigade under Lieutenant Colonel John Colborne , along with a detachment of Spanish horse , to watch Latour @-@ Maubourg 's movements and dissuade him from returning to Extremadura . Wellington was so concerned by the lack of progress that he decided to pay a flying visit to the region . He and Beresford conducted a reconnaissance of Badajoz on 22 April and by the time he left for the north , he had prepared for Beresford a detailed set of memorandum concerning how he should conduct the impending siege and the rest of the campaign . Beresford followed the instructions slowly but surely and finally began the Siege of Badajoz on 4 May . 
 A positive development for the Allies during this time was the appearance of another Spanish force in the region . The Spanish Regency at Cádiz had sent General Joaquín Blake , with the two divisions of Zayas and <unk> , by sea to <unk> on the mouth of the Guadiana . Landing on 18 April , Blake 's army moved to join General Francisco Ballesteros at the Spanish town of <unk> . 
 Although Blake was himself a member of the Spanish Regency , he was junior to Castaños in the military hierarchy ( but senior to <unk> ) . He consequently did not protest when General Castaños agreed that Marshal Beresford , who was also junior to Castaños in rank , should command the combined Allied armies in any battle because there were more men in the Anglo @-@ Portuguese force . 
 = = = Armies gather = = = 
 From the moment the French were forced to retreat before Beresford , Soult knew that Badajoz was at risk and he was determined that he would not lose the one tangible gain of his winter campaign . By 9 May , he felt that time was running out , so he set out for Badajoz with all the men of I Corps and IV Corps of the Army of the South he could spare from the siege of Cadiz and the occupation of the rest of Andalusia . Combined with the men of V Corps under Latour @-@ Maubourg on the Andalusian border , Soult had a force of approximately 23 @,@ 000 men and 35 artillery pieces cannon moving towards Badajoz . His army was much smaller than that of the Allies , but he hoped the quality of his troops would compensate for his lack of numbers . 
 Beresford was alerted to the French advance by reports received on 12 May from Spanish patriots in Seville , who had sent word of Soult 's departure . Beresford kept up the pretence of besieging Badajoz by sending an unsuccessful demand for surrender to the French commander on the afternoon of that same day , but he realized he would now not have time to finish the job , so he ordered the withdrawal of his siege guns and supplies . On 13 May , the Spanish cavalry attached to Colborne 's brigade came into contact with the French force and , in accordance with orders given by Wellington in April , they fell back while sending word of Soult 's new position to Beresford . Later that day Long 's British cavalry also encountered the advancing French and hastily pulled back — although Long , too , was following Wellington 's orders not to engage , Beresford considered his withdrawal somewhat premature and thought Long could have delayed the French by forcing them to deploy . 
 Also on the 13th , Beresford moved the British 2nd Division , Major General John Hamilton 's Portuguese division and three artillery batteries from Badajoz to Valverde — an ideal position to observe the three routes open for Soult 's approach . Wellington 's orders left Beresford full discretion to fight Soult or to retreat and he was personally inclined to the latter course of action . However , when Beresford met with Blake and Castaños , the two most senior Spanish generals , at Valverde on 14 May , he allowed himself to be persuaded that the numerical superiority the Allied army had over Soult justified risking a battle . The Allied leaders consequently agreed to concentrate at Albuera , which was the location chosen by Wellington as best suited for an attempt to resist any French advance to relieve Badajoz . 
 By 15 May it was clear to Beresford that Soult was taking the central route to Badajoz , which ran through Santa Marta and the village of Albuera . He made further adjustments to his deployment , moving the 2nd Division and Hamilton 's Portuguese to defend the village , where they were joined by Alten 's KGL brigade and a further Portuguese brigade composed of garrison and light troops temporarily formed for the campaign . Soult 's movements became even clearer when his Chasseurs à cheval and hussars engaged Long 's cavalry at Santa Marta — once again Long retreated in what Beresford considered to be unreasonable haste . Major General William Lumley took over from Long as the Allied cavalry commander . Accounts differ as to the reason for this , some claiming it was because of Long 's incompetence , and others stating that it was simply down to Lumley 's seniority . The immediate reason for Beresford 's decision seems to have been that Long himself suggested that the appointment of Lumley would resolve questions of seniority that had arisen between Long and the commanders of the Spanish cavalry . The actual change of command did not take place until the morning of the 16th because Lumley did not arrive at the battlefield until then . 
 There were no further engagements that day , so Beresford was able to complete his dispositions . The front of the Allied position was defined by a series of small watercourses flowing from south to north . Two of these , the Nogales ( sometimes called the Feria ) and <unk> brooks , meet just south of the village to form the Albuera river , but none of these were formidable obstacles and the river itself could be crossed at two bridges and a ford . Alten 's men were placed in Albuera itself , while Hamilton 's division along with most of the Portuguese cavalry formed the Allied left wing to the north of the village and Major General William Stewart 's 2nd Division formed up on a hill just to the west of Albuera . The right wing of the Allied army was to be supplied by Castaños 's and Blake 's four Spanish infantry divisions , while the Allied cavalry and artillery along with the 4th Division would provide a strong strategic reserve . To the west of the <unk> and the Albuera , the land rises to a low , treeless north @-@ south ridge crowned by several knolls that become progressively higher to the south . After the battle , Beresford was severely criticized for failing to occupy two of these high points , the first of which lies approximately one mile southwest of the village and the second some 500 yards further south . 
 Blake 's divisions were delayed in coming forward and only arrived at around midnight 15 – 16 May , although they were in position in time for the opening of battle later that morning . Meanwhile , Lowry Cole 's 4th Division , and de España 's Spanish brigade marched from Badajoz to Albuera in the early hours of 16 May . 
 Meanwhile , Soult was making his own plans . He knew that Blake intended to join forces with Beresford , but he thought that the Spanish divisions were still several days march away . Based on that erroneous premise , Soult decided that his best course of action would be to turn the Allies ' southern flank , thus driving a wedge between the two parts of Beresford 's army . Soult hoped that as a result he could defeat his opponents in detail , overcoming Beresford 's force and then turning south to deal with Blake 's divisions . 
 = = Battle = = 
 Beresford deployed his troops on the reverse slopes of such hills as could be found on the battlefield ; unable to see the Allied army , Soult was still unaware that Blake 's Spanish divisions had come up during the night . Thus , on the morning of 16 May 1811 , the Marshal proceeded with his attempt to turn the Allied right flank . To approach Albuera village directly , the French would have to cross the Albuera River via a small bridge , and Soult 's first move was to launch a strong feint attack in this direction . He sent Godinot 's infantry brigade , flanked by Briche 's light cavalry and supported by artillery , across the bridge towards the village . Four platoons of Vistulan Lancers also crossed the river , but they were driven back by the 3rd Dragoon Guards . A Portuguese gun battery had been positioned to cover the approaches to the bridge , and as Godinot 's skirmishers advanced they became engaged with Alten 's KGL battalions , who were defending Albuera . 
 At the same time two brigades of dragoons and Werlé 's infantry brigade showed themselves on Godinot 's left , advancing out of an olive wood in front of Blake 's position to Alten 's right . With a large concentration of French troops now menacing the village , the Allied commanders took the bait exactly as Soult had planned , and sent reinforcements to Alten 's aid . 
 = = = French flank attack = = = 
 While the Allies were bracing themselves for a frontal assault on their centre and right , Soult was preparing his real thrust . The two V Corps divisions of Generals Girard and Gazan , preceded by a cavalry brigade , swung left to begin the Marshal 's flanking move — their progress was concealed by intervening olive woods , and the first the Allies knew of them was when four French cavalry regiments burst from the southern end of the woods , crossed two brooks , and scattered Loy 's Spanish cavalry on the right of Beresford 's lines . Alarmed , Beresford rode forward to observe the French manoeuvres ; when Godinot 's cavalry support and Werlé 's brigade began to move away from Albuera and toward Girard 's rear , Soult 's true intentions became clear . 
 Beresford immediately issued new orders . He directed Blake to swing his forward line around to face the approaching French . Lumley 's cavalry was sent to support Loy 's horse and hold Blake 's right flank , while Stewart 's 2nd Division was sent south from its location behind Albuera to take up a new position behind Blake in readiness to provide support if needed . Cole 's 4th Division was ordered to form up behind the cavalry , and Hamilton 's Portuguese moved to the Allied centre to hold Albuera and act as a reserve . 
 Blake however did not follow Beresford 's orders ; he still believed that the French attack would come at his front . Keeping his forward line in position , he instead moved four battalions from Zayas 's division to form his new southern @-@ facing front . Zayas deployed these battalions , from the Spanish second line , in two groups . Two battalions of Spanish Guards were formed up , in line , at the top of a steep incline while the remaining two formed close columns behind them ; a single battery of Spanish artillery supported the whole position . 
 Beresford , on hearing of Blake 's limited redeployment , rode back to personally supervise the operation . He merged Zayas 's second pair of battalions with the first pair , forming a front line four battalions strong . He then sent orders for <unk> to bring up three of his battalions to support Zayas 's right , and for Ballesteros to bring a further two in support of the left . However , these reinforcements did not arrive in time to meet the first French attack — Zayas 's four battalions had to face two entire French divisions alone . 
 = = = Thin Spanish line holds = = = 
 While Beresford had been redeploying his army , a " majestic movement changed the whole aspect of the French front " . Two brigades of dragoons galloped from the French right @-@ centre , passed behind V Corps , and joined Latour @-@ Maubourg 's cavalry on the left . At the same time Werlé 's division closed up with the rear of V Corps , becoming the French reserve . Soult had concentrated his entire infantry strength , except for Godinot 's 3 @,@ 500 men who were still engaged at Albuera , and all his cavalry save Briche 's light horse , into one front marching on Blake 's right flank . 
 The two divisions of V Corps advanced one behind the other against Zayas 's position . The first of these divisions , that of Girard , moved in <unk> <unk> — four battalions in column flanked on either side by a battalion in line , and further flanked by a battalion and a half in column — while Gazan 's division moved in battalion column . Girard 's tirailleurs engaged Zayas line and gradually thinned the Spanish front rank . When Girard 's main column came within about 50 metres ( 55 yd ) of the Spaniards , the skirmishers split to the left and right and the battalions behind them opened fire . The Spaniards held their ground , exchanging volleys with the French , and eventually repelled Girard 's first attack . 
 Despite their resistance Zayas 's men , possibly the best troops in the Spanish army at the time , were being slowly forced back . However , they held long enough for Ballesteros and <unk> to come up , and for Stewart 's 2nd Division to advance to their support . Stewart brought John Colborne 's 1st Brigade up , followed by the Division 's two other brigades . The 3rd Regiment of Foot ( the Buffs ) took the lead , followed by the 48th and the 66th . Colborne 's brigade formed up on the French left , and supported by a battery of KGL cannon the British opened fire , forcing Girard 's two flanking battalions to face outwards in order to return fire . 
 = = = Destruction of Colborne 's brigade = = = 
 The musketry duel that developed between Colborne 's brigade and Girard 's left flank was so intense that both sides faltered . The French began to break , and were only kept in place by their officers beating them back with swords as they tried to retreat . The left of Colborne 's brigade , assailed by both musket fire and grapeshot from Girard 's supporting guns , tried to force the issue with a bayonet charge but were unsuccessful . On the right Colborne 's men continued to trade volleys with the French and , seeing their resolve wavering , also fixed bayonets and charged . 
 As the brigade moved forward a blinding <unk> and rain @-@ shower hit the battlefield , rendering both sides ' muskets useless . Under cover of the reduced visibility Latour @-@ Maubourg launched two Polish cavalry regiments at Colborne 's exposed right flank . Ploughing through the unprepared British infantry , the 1st Vistulan Lancers and the 2nd Hussars virtually annihilated Colborne 's first three regiments . Only the fourth , the 31st Regiment of Foot , was able to save itself by forming into squares . The cavalry pressed on against Colborne 's supporting KGL artillery battery and captured its guns ( although all but the howitzer were subsequently recovered ) . 
 Having captured five regimental flags and eight cannon the Uhlans swept past the 31st 's square , scattering Beresford and his staff , and attacked the rear of Zayas 's line . Zayas met this assault unflinchingly while continuing to direct fire at Girard . By this time the rainstorm had cleared and Lumley , commanding Beresford 's horse , could finally make out the devastation caused by the French and Polish cavalry . He sent two squadrons of the 4th Dragoons to disperse the Uhlans , which they did , but the British troopers were in their turn driven off by a fresh hussar regiment that Latour @-@ Maubourg had sent to cover the lancers ' retreat . Closing on the action , the 29th Regiment of Foot ( the lead regiment of Stewart 's second brigade ) opened fire on the scattered Vistula lancers . Most of this fusillade actually missed its intended targets and instead struck the rear ranks of Zayas 's men . The Spaniards nevertheless stood firm ; their actions very likely saved the allied army from destruction . 
 Some British sources claim that the Polish cavalrymen refused to accept any surrender by the British infantry , and deliberately speared the wounded as they lay . Tradition reports that the British 2nd Division swore to give no quarter to Poles following Albuera . According to Beresford , of the 1 @,@ 258 men lost by Colborne 's first three regiments , 319 were killed , 460 were wounded and 479 were taken prisoner . According to Soult 's report the Vistula Lancers had 130 casualties out of 591 troopers . 
 = = = Hoghton 's ordeal = = = 
 The fighting on the Allied right now paused as both sides sought to regroup . Girard 's division had suffered considerably in its battle with Zayas , and Colborne 's actions , although ultimately disastrous , had caused significant French casualties . Girard now regarded his division as a spent force and brought up Gazan 's 2nd Division to take its place . Advancing in column , Gazan 's battalions had to struggle through the remnants of Girard 's retiring units . As a result , many of the 1st Division 's survivors were swept up and incorporated into Gazan 's column , which grew by accretion into a dense mass of 8 @,@ 000 men , losing much of its cohesion in the process . The ensuing disruption and delay gave the Allies time to re @-@ form their own lines . Beresford deployed Hoghton 's brigade behind Zayas 's lines and Abercrombie 's to the rear of Ballesteros , then moved them forward to relieve the Spaniards . Joseph Moyle Sherer , an officer serving under Abercrombie , recounts how a young Spanish officer rode up and " begged me ... to explain to the English that his countrymen were ordered to retire [ and ] were not flying . " 
 Following this hiatus the second phase of the battle began — if anything even more bloodily than the first . The French only deployed a skirmish line against Abercrombie 's brigade , so the weight of the renewed assault fell on Hoghton . Despite being joined by the sole survivors of Colborne 's brigade ( the 31st Foot ) , just 1 @,@ 900 men stood in line to face the advancing corps . Hoghton 's three battalions ( the 29th Regiment of Foot , 1 / 48th Regiment of Foot and 1 / 57th Regiment of Foot ) , suffered huge casualties , with 56 officers and 971 men killed or wounded from their complement of 95 officers and 1 @,@ 556 men . 
 Ordinarily in a duel between Allied line and French column , the greater volume of fire laid down by the line ( where every single weapon could be brought to bear on the front and flanks of the narrower column ) could be expected to be the decisive factor . In this case however , the French were well supported by artillery . More than compensating for the firepower disadvantage of his infantry formation , Girard brought guns up to just 275 metres ( 300 yd ) from Hoghton 's line — close enough to enfilade it with a crossfire of grape and canister . Early in this engagement Colonel William Inglis of the 57th Foot was wounded by grapeshot from the French artillery . He refused to be carried to the rear and lay with the Colours ; throughout the battle his voice could be heard calmly repeating " Die hard 57th , die hard ! " In following his exhortations , the 57th earned their nickname : the " Die @-@ Hards " . 
 Under this combined arms assault Hoghton 's brigade lost two thirds of its strength . The Brigadier himself was killed , and as casualties rose its shrinking line could no longer cover the frontage of the attacking column . However , the French were in no condition to press home their numerical advantage ; British volley fire had taken its toll and Girard lost 2 @,@ 000 men during the confrontation . He had tried to form his unwieldy corps @-@ sized column into line to bring his full firepower to bear and overwhelm Hoghton 's brigade , but his deploying companies were constantly driven back into the column by the intense British musketry . 
 = = = Soult 's retreat = = = 
 Although the French attacks were being held , the result of the battle was still far from certain . Soult had Werlé 's divisional @-@ sized brigade in reserve , and most of Latour @-@ Maubourg 's cavalry had not been engaged . However , the presence of Cole 's fresh 4th Division , still formed up in readiness behind Lumley 's squadrons , seems to have persuaded Soult not to use his strong force of horsemen . In his subsequent dispatch to the Emperor , Soult claimed that he had only at that point learned that Blake had joined with Beresford and he faced a much larger Allied force than expected . The Marshal , having outmanoeuvred the Allies with his flank attack , went on the defensive : the cavalry were refused permission to charge , and Werlé remained in reserve . 
 On the Allied side Beresford was proving no more incisive . Anxious to reinforce Hoghton and Abercrombie , he tried to bring up de España 's independent brigade , but they refused to move within range of the French . Leaving Cole 's division in place ( according to Beresford , to protect the Allied flank from further cavalry attack , although Wellington was of the opinion that Beresford was actually securing his line of retreat ) , Beresford instead called upon Hamilton 's Portuguese Division , but Hamilton had moved closer to Albuera to support Alten in fending off Godinot 's attack , and the orders took a long time to reach him . Hamilton 's brigades only started moving half an hour after the orders had been sent . With his right under heavy pressure and casualties mounting , Beresford finally sent for Alten 's KGL , ordering 3 @,@ 000 Spaniards to Albuera to relieve them and take over the defence there . Alten hastily regrouped and marched south to the Allies ' right wing , but Godinot took Albuera before the Spaniards could arrive , exposing another Allied flank to the French . 
 It was at this critical point that the decisive move of the battle was made by General Cole . Standing idle under explicit orders from Beresford , he had nevertheless been considering advancing against the French left flank , but he was wary of moving his infantry across open country in the face of 3 @,@ 500 French cavalry . His mind was made up though when Colonel Henry Hardinge , of the Portuguese Quarter @-@ master @-@ general 's department , rode up and urged him to immediately advance . After a brief consultation with Lumley , Cole began to redeploy his division from column into line . Mindful of the dangers presented by Latour @-@ Maubourg 's horsemen , Cole flanked his line at either end with a unit in column : on the right were the division 's massed light companies , including those from Brigadier <unk> 's brigade , while the first battalion of the Lusitanian Legion took station on the left . Lumley formed up the whole of the Allied cavalry to the rear and right , accompanied by a battery of horse artillery , and the whole mass , some 5 @,@ 000 infantrymen , advanced on V Corps ' left flank . 
 The sight of the approaching Allied line forced Soult 's hand — if Cole 's division was not stopped , defeat was certain . He sent four regiments of Latour @-@ Maubourg 's dragoons to charge the Portuguese section of Cole 's line , and committed the whole of Werlé 's reserve to protect V Corps ' flank . The dragoons swept down on Harvey 's Portuguese brigade fully expecting to destroy it as they had Colborne 's . The inexperienced Portuguese , however , stood firm and drove away the cavalry without even forming square . Having once been repulsed , Latour @-@ Maubourg 's dragoons made no further attack on Cole 's division , and the Allied line marched on . The Fusilier brigade and Lusitanian Legion on the division 's left soon encountered Werlé 's brigade , which outnumbered them two to one . Despite his advantage in numbers , Werlé had formed his nine battalions into three columns of regiments , and could not bring as many muskets to bear as the Allies . Three separate regimental musket duels ensued , as the 23rd Royal Welch Fusiliers and the two battalions of the 7th Fusiliers each took on a column . During the fire @-@ fight the French tried once more to extend into line , but as before the concentrated Allied fire prevented their deployment . After 20 – 30 minutes of bitter conflict they finally broke and ran . The Fusiliers had lost more than half their numbers , mainly to artillery fire , while Werlé 's brigade had suffered 1 @,@ 800 casualties . 
 Meanwhile , Abercrombie had wheeled his brigade round to face the right of the beleaguered V Corps and charged ; Girard 's and Gazan 's men fled to the rear , joining the fugitives from Werlé 's brigade . The Allied 4th Division and parts of the 2nd went after the retreating French , leading Beresford to exclaim " Stop ! Stop the Fifty Seventh ; it would be a sin to let them go on ! " This admonition was unnecessary though : Latour @-@ Maubourg quickly placed his cavalry between the chasing Allied divisions and the fleeing French infantry , and aborting their pursuit the British and Portuguese instead drew up on the heights they had just won . Soult also moved up his final reserve — two strong Grenadier battalions — to cover the retreat , and although these suffered heavily from Allied artillery fire , they and the cavalry ensured there was little further fighting . After some delay Beresford brought up three Portuguese brigades and drove the Grenadiers back , but by this time Soult had massed his artillery in a line against the Allies and Beresford did not further commit his forces . 
 As a postscript to the battle , Alten 's KGL , who had not had time to join the southern front , returned to Albuera and drove out what French force remained in the village . After six or seven hours of bitter conflict , the battle had come to an end . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 On the morning of 17 May both sides formed up again . Beresford 's orders indicated that he would retreat if Soult advanced . All day Soult held his ground , long enough to arrange for transportation of his wounded to Seville . It was not apparent to Beresford that there was little chance of Soult resuming hostilities , even when <unk> 's 1 @,@ 400 strong brigade ( previously stranded on the north bank of the Guadiana ) joined the Allied army on the battlefield at dawn . Beresford also had the relatively unscathed Portuguese division , Alten 's KGL and several Spanish battalions ready for duty ; Soult , in contrast , only had Godinot 's brigade and Latour @-@ Maubourg 's cavalry in a fit state to fight . News that Wellington was marching to Elvas with a further two divisions hastened the Marshal 's decision to retreat , as well as persuading Beresford not to launch a premature offensive against Soult 's superior artillery and cavalry . 
 Soult marched away before dawn on 18 May , leaving several hundred wounded behind for the Allies to treat and Beresford , despite a large advantage in numbers and a day 's rest , was nevertheless unable to pursue . So many were injured in the battle that two days later British casualties were still waiting to be collected from the field . The chapel at Albuera was filled with wounded Frenchmen , and the dead still lay scattered across the ground . In proportion to the numbers involved , the Battle of Albuera was the bloodiest of the whole Peninsular War . 
 The losses on both sides were horrific , and while Soult had failed in his aim of relieving the siege of Badajoz , neither side had demonstrated the will to press for a conclusive victory . Allied losses amounted to 5 @,@ 916 : 4 @,@ 159 British , 389 Portuguese and 1 @,@ 368 Spaniards . In his despatch of 21 May 1811 , Soult estimated British casualties as 5 @,@ 000 with 800 to 1 @,@ 000 captured ; Spanish as 2 @,@ 000 with 1 @,@ 100 captured ; Portuguese as 700 to 800 . French casualties are harder to ascertain — Soult initially declared 2 @,@ 800 in his dispatch to Napoleon , but the official figure drawn up on 6 July revised that number upward to 5 @,@ 936 . British historians dispute this , comparing Soult 's figure of 241 officer casualties with regimental returns that total 362 . Sir Charles Oman extrapolated this figure to come up with the total number of French casualties , which he puts at approximately 7 @,@ 900 . In comparison , the French historians <unk> and <unk> place Soult 's losses at 7 @,@ 000 . Some of the British dead from the battle , including Major General Daniel Hoghton , are buried in the British Cemetery , Elvas . 
 Reviewing Beresford 's after action report , Wellington was unhappy with its despondent tone and commented to a staff officer " This won 't do . It will drive the people in England mad . Write me down a victory . " The report was duly rewritten , although Wellington privately acknowledged that another such battle would ruin his army . Soult , on the basis of higher allied casualties , also claimed " a signal victory " . He generously paid tribute to the steadfastness of the allied troops , writing " There is no beating these troops , in spite of their generals . I always thought they were bad soldiers , now I am sure of it . I had turned their right , pierced their centre and everywhere victory was mine – but they did not know how to run ! " 
 = = Consequences = = 
 Although he failed to lift the siege of Badajoz , Soult 's campaign had managed to temporarily relieve it . On 12 May Beresford , when learned that Soult had reached <unk> , directed that the siege be abandoned and by the night of the 13th the siege train , artillery and supplies were withdrawn to Elvas and such material that could not be moved was burned . General <unk> , the garrison 's commander , took this opportunity to sally out and destroy the surrounding Allied <unk> and batteries . On 18 May Beresford sent Hamilton 's Portuguese division , along with some cavalry , back to Badajoz . A show of Badajoz 's investment was resumed the following day. but Soult knew well that Beresford could no longer hurt Badajoz . Beresford 's corps was joined by Wellington 's field army during June 1811 , but even with this reinforcement time was fast running out . The French Army of Portugal , now reconstituted under Marshal Auguste Marmont , had joined up with Soult 's Army of the South , and Wellington was forced to pull his 44 @,@ 000 men back across the border to Elvas . On 20 June the combined French force , over 60 @,@ 000 strong , lifted the siege . 
 The Battle of Albuera had little effect on the overall course of the war , but it had shown that British and Spanish troops could work together . On the other hand , Anglo @-@ Spanish political relations suffered following the battle . Wellington placed most of the blame for the losses on Blake , while a dispatch read in the Spanish <unk> implied that the British had played only a minor role in the battle , despite their much higher losses . 
 = Conatus = 
 In early philosophies of psychology and metaphysics , conatus ( / <unk> / ; Latin for " effort ; endeavor ; impulse , inclination , tendency ; undertaking ; striving " ) is an innate inclination of a thing to continue to exist and enhance itself . This " thing " may be mind , matter or a combination of both . Over the millennia , many different definitions and treatments have been formulated . Seventeenth @-@ century philosophers René Descartes , Baruch Spinoza , Gottfried Leibniz , and Thomas Hobbes made important contributions . The conatus may refer to the instinctive " will to live " of living organisms or to various metaphysical theories of motion and inertia . Often the concept is associated with God 's will in a pantheist view of Nature . The concept may be broken up into separate definitions for the mind and body and split when discussing centrifugal force and inertia . 
 The history of the term conatus is that of a series of subtle tweaks in meaning and clarifications of scope developed over the course of two and a half millennia . Successive philosophers to adopt the term put their own personal twist on the concept , each developing the term differently such that it now has no accepted definition . The earliest authors to discuss conatus wrote primarily in Latin , basing their usage on ancient Greek concepts . These thinkers therefore used " conatus " not only as a technical term but as a common word and in a general sense . In archaic texts , the more technical usage is difficult to discern from the more common one , and they are also hard to differentiate in translation . In English translations , the term is italicized when used in the technical sense or translated and followed by conatus in brackets . Today , conatus is rarely used in the technical sense , since modern physics uses concepts such as inertia and conservation of momentum that have superseded it . It has , however , been a notable influence on nineteenth- and twentieth @-@ century thinkers such as Arthur Schopenhauer , Friedrich Nietzsche , and Louis Dumont .

 The Latin <unk> comes from the verb <unk> , which is usually translated into English as , " to endeavor " ; but the concept of the conatus was first developed by the Stoics ( 333 – 264 BCE ) and <unk> ( c . 335 BCE ) before the Common Era . These groups used the word <unk> ( <unk> , translated in Latin by impetus ) to describe the movement of the soul towards an object , and from which a physical act results . Classical thinkers , Marcus Tullius Cicero ( 106 – 43 BCE ) and Diogenes Laertius ( c . 235 BCE ) , expanded this principle to include an aversion to destruction , but continued to limit its application to the motivations of non @-@ human animals . Diogenes Laertius , for example , specifically denied the application of the term to plants . Before the Renaissance , Thomas Aquinas ( c . 1225 – 1274 CE ) , Duns Scotus ( c . 1266 – 1308 CE ) and Dante Alighieri ( 1265 – 1321 CE ) expressed similar sentiments using the Latin words <unk> , <unk> or <unk> as synonyms of conatus ; indeed , all four terms may be used to translate the original Greek <unk> . Later , <unk> and Campanella extended the ancient Greek notions and applied them to all objects , animate and inanimate . 
 First Aristotle , then Cicero and Laertius each alluded to a connection between the conatus and other emotions . In their view , the former induces the latter . They maintained that humans do not wish to do something because they think it " good " , but rather they think it " good " because they want to do it . In other words , the cause of human desire is the natural inclination of a body to augment itself in accordance with the principles of the conatus . 
 = = Medieval views = = 
 There is a traditional connection between conatus and motion itself . Aquinas and <unk> ( 1265 – 1321 ) both related the concept directly to that which Augustine ( 354 – 430 CE ) saw to be the " natural movements upward and downward or with their being balanced in an intermediate position " described in his De <unk> Dei , ( c . 520 CE ) . They called this force that causes objects to rise or fall , " amor naturalis " , or " natural love " . 
 In the 6th century , John Philoponus ( c . 490 – c . 570 CE ) criticized Aristotle 's view of motion , noting the inconsistency between Aristotle 's discussion of projectiles , where the medium of aether keeps projectiles going , and his discussion of the void , where there is no such medium and hence a body 's motion should be impossible . Philoponus proposed that motion was not maintained by the action of some surrounding medium but by some property , or conatus implanted in the object when it was set in motion . This was not the modern concept of inertia , for there was still the need for an inherent power to keep a body in motion . This view was strongly opposed by <unk> and many scholastic philosophers who supported Aristotle . The Aristotelian view was also challenged in the Islamic world . For example , Ibn al @-@ Haytham ( Alhazen ) seems to have supported Philoponus ' views , while he developed a concept similar to inertia . The concept of inertia was developed more clearly in the work of his contemporary Avicenna , who conceived a permanent force whose effect is dissipated only as a result of external agents such as air resistance , making him " the first to conceive such a permanent type of impressed virtue for non @-@ natural motion . " Avicenna 's concept of <unk> is almost the opposite of the Aristotelian conception of violent motion and is reminiscent of Newton 's first law of motion . Avicenna also developed an idea similar to momentum , when he attempted to provide a quantitative relation between the weight and velocity of a moving body . 
 Jean Buridan ( 1300 – 1358 ) also rejected the notion that this motion @-@ generating property , which he named impetus , dissipated spontaneously . Buridan 's position was that a moving object would be arrested by the resistance of the air and the weight of the body which would oppose its impetus . He also maintained that impetus increased with speed ; thus , his initial idea of impetus was similar in many ways to the modern concept of momentum . Despite the obvious similarities to more modern ideas of inertia , Buridan saw his theory as only a modification to Aristotle 's basic philosophy , maintaining many other peripatetic views , including the belief that there was still a fundamental difference between an object in motion and an object at rest . Buridan also maintained that impetus could be not only linear , but also circular in nature , causing objects such as celestial bodies to move in a circle . 
 = = In Descartes = = 
 In the first half of the seventeenth century , René Descartes ( 1596 – 1650 ) began to develop a more modern , materialistic concept of the conatus , describing it as " an active power or tendency of bodies to move , expressing the power of God " . Whereas the ancients used the term in a strictly anthropomorphic sense similar to voluntary " endeavoring " or " struggling " to achieve certain ends , and medieval Scholastic philosophers developed a notion of conatus as a mysterious intrinsic property of things , Descartes uses the term in a somewhat more mechanistic sense . More specifically , for Descartes , in contrast to Buridan , movement and stasis are two states of the same thing , not different things . Although there is much ambiguity in Descartes ' notion of conatus , one can see here the beginnings of a move away from the attribution of desires and intentions to nature and its workings toward a more scientific and modern view . 
 Descartes rejects the teleological , or purposive , view of the material world that was dominant in the West from the time of Aristotle . The mind is not viewed by Descartes as part of the material world , and hence is not subject to the strictly mechanical laws of nature . Motion and rest , on the other hand , are properties of the interactions of matter according to eternally fixed mechanical laws . God only sets the whole thing in motion at the start , and later does not interfere except to maintain the dynamical regularities of the mechanical behavior of bodies . Hence there is no real teleology in the movements of bodies since the whole thing reduces to the law @-@ governed collisions and their constant reconfigurations . The conatus is just the tendency of bodies to move when they collide with each other . God may set this activity in motion , but thereafter no new motion or rest can be created or destroyed . 
 Descartes specifies two varieties of the conatus : conatus a centro and conatus <unk> . Conatus a centro , or " tendency towards the center " , is used by Descartes as a theory of gravity ; conatus <unk> , or " tendency away from the center " , represents the centrifugal forces . These tendencies are not to be thought of in terms of animate dispositions and intentions , nor as inherent properties or " forces " of things , but rather as a unifying , external characteristic of the physical universe itself which God has bestowed . 
 Descartes , in developing his First Law of Nature , also invokes the idea of a conatus se <unk> , or " conatus of self @-@ preservation " . This law is a generalization of the principle of inertia , which was developed and experimentally demonstrated earlier by Galileo . The principle was formalized by Isaac Newton and made into the first of his three Laws of Motion fifty years after the death of Descartes . Descartes ' version states : " Each thing , insofar as in it lies , always perseveres in the same state , and when once moved , always continues to move . "

 = = = Conatus and the psyche = = = 
 Thomas Hobbes ( 1588 – 1679 ) , too , worked off of the previous notions of the conatus principle . However , he criticized the previous definitions for failing to explain the origin of motion . Working toward this end became the primary focus of Hobbes ' work in this area . Indeed , Hobbes " reduces all the cognitive functions of the mind to variations of its <unk> functions " . 
 Furthermore , Hobbes describes emotion as the beginning of motion and the will as the sum of all emotions . This " will " forms the conatus of a body and its physical manifestation is the perceived " will to survive " . In order that living beings may thrive , Hobbes says , " they seek peace and fight anything that threatens this peace " . Hobbes also equates this conatus with " imagination " , and states that a change in the conatus , or will , is the result of " deliberation " . 
 = = = Conatus and physics = = = 
 I define [ conatus ] to be motion made in less space and time than can be given ; that is , less than can be determined or assigned by exposition or number ; that is , motion made through the length of a point , and in an instant or point of time . 
 As in his psychological theory , Hobbes 's physical conatus is an infinitesimal unit of motion . It is the beginning of motion : an inclination in a specified direction . The concept of impetus , as used by Hobbes , is defined in terms of this physical conatus . It is " a measure of the conatus exercised by a moving body over the course of time " . Resistance is caused by a contrary conatus ; force is this motion plus " the magnitude of the body " . Hobbes also uses the word conatus to refer to the " restorative forces " which may cause springs , for example , to contract or expand . Hobbes claims there is some force inherent in these objects that inclines them to return to their previous state . Today , science attributes this phenomenon to material elasticity . 
 = = In Spinoza = = 
 Conatus is a central theme in the philosophy of Benedict de Spinoza ( 1632 – 1677 ) . According to Spinoza , " each thing , as far as it lies in itself , strives to persevere in its being " ( Ethics , part 3 , prop . 6 ) . Spinoza presents a few reasons for believing this . First , particular things are , as he puts it , modes of God , which means that each one expresses the power of God in a particular way ( Ethics , part 3 , prop . 6 , dem . ) . Moreover , it could never be part of the definition of God that his modes contradict one another ( Ethics , part 3 , prop . 5 ) ; each thing , therefore , " is opposed to everything which can take its existence away " ( Ethics , part 3 , prop . 6 , dem . ) . This resistance to destruction is formulated by Spinoza in terms of a striving to continue to exist , and conatus is the word he most often uses to describe this force . 
 Striving to persevere is not merely something that a thing does in addition to other activities it might happen to undertake . Rather , striving is " nothing but the actual essence of the thing " ( Ethics , part 3 , prop . 7 ) . Spinoza also uses the term conatus to refer to rudimentary concepts of inertia , as Descartes had earlier . Since a thing cannot be destroyed without the action of external forces , motion and rest , too , exist indefinitely until disturbed . 
 = = = Behavioral manifestation = = = 
 The concept of the conatus , as used in Baruch Spinoza 's psychology , is derived from sources both ancient and medieval . Spinoza reformulates principles that the Stoics , Cicero , Laertius , and especially Hobbes and Descartes developed . One significant change he makes to Hobbes ' theory is his belief that the conatus ad <unk> , ( conatus to motion ) , is not mental , but material . 
 Spinoza , with his determinism , believes that man and nature must be unified under a consistent set of laws ; God and nature are one , and there is no free will . Contrary to most philosophers of his time and in accordance with most of those of the present , Spinoza rejects the dualistic assumption that mind , intentionality , ethics , and freedom are to be treated as things separate from the natural world of physical objects and events . His goal is to provide a unified explanation of all these things within a naturalistic framework , and his notion of conatus is central to this project . For example , an action is " free " , for Spinoza , only if it arises from the essence and conatus of an entity . There can be no absolute , unconditioned freedom of the will , since all events in the natural world , including human actions and choices , are determined in accord with the natural laws of the universe , which are inescapable . However , an action can still be free in the sense that it is not constrained or otherwise subject to external forces . 
 Human beings are thus an integral part of nature . Spinoza explains seemingly irregular human behaviour as really " natural " and rational and motivated by this principle of the conatus . In the process , he replaces the notion of free will with the conatus , a principle that can be applied to all of nature and not just man . 
 = = = = Emotions and affects = = = = 
 Spinoza 's view of the relationship between the conatus and the human affects is not clear . Firmin <unk> , assistant professor of philosophy at the Maryland Institute College of Art , and Antonio Damasio , professor of neuroscience at the University of Southern California , both argue that the human affects arise from the conatus and the perpetual drive toward perfection . Indeed , Spinoza states in his Ethics that happiness , specifically , " consists in the human capacity to preserve itself " . This " endeavor " is also characterized by Spinoza as the " foundation of virtue " . Conversely , a person is saddened by anything that opposes his conatus . 
 David Bidney ( 1908 – 1987 ) , professor at Yale University , disagrees . Bidney closely associates " desire " , a primary affect , with the conatus principle of Spinoza . This view is backed by the Scholium of <unk> of the Ethics which states , " Between appetite and desire there is no difference , except that desire is generally related to men insofar as they are conscious of the appetite . So desire can be defined as appetite together with consciousness of the appetite . " According to Bidney , this desire is controlled by the other affects , pleasure and pain , and thus the conatus strives towards that which causes joy and avoids that which produces pain . 
 = = In Leibniz = = 
 Gottfried Leibniz ( 1646 – 1716 ) was a student of Erhard Weigel ( 1625 – 1699 ) and learned of the conatus principle from him and from Hobbes , though Weigel used the word <unk> ( Latin : tendency ) . Specifically , Leibniz uses the word conatus in his Exposition and Defence of the New System ( 1695 ) to describe a notion similar that of Hobbes , but he differentiates between the conatus of the body and soul , the first of which may only travel in a straight line by its own power , and the latter of which may " remember " more complicated motions . 
 For Leibniz , the problem of motion comes to a resolution of the paradox of Zeno . Since motion is continuous , space must be infinitely divisible . In order for anything to begin moving at all , there must be some mind @-@ like , <unk> property or force inherent in the basic constituents of the universe that propels them . This conatus is a sort of instantaneous or " virtual " motion that all things possess , even when they are static . Motion , meanwhile , is just the summation of all the <unk> that a thing has , along with the interactions of things . The conatus is to motion as a point is to space . The problem with this view is that an object that collides with another would not be able to bounce back , if the only force in play were the conatus . Hence , Leibniz was forced to postulate the existence of an aether that kept objects moving and allowed for elastic collisions . Leibniz ' concept of a mind @-@ like memory @-@ less property of conatus , coupled with his rejection of atoms , eventually led to his theory of monads . 
 Leibniz also uses his concept of a conatus in developing the principles of the integral calculus , adapting the meaning of the term , in this case , to signify a mathematical analog of Newton 's <unk> " force " . By summing an infinity of such <unk> ( i.e. , what is now called integration ) , Leibniz could measure the effect of a continuous force . He defines impetus as the result of a continuous summation of the conatus of a body , just as the vis viva ( or " living force " ) is the sum of the inactive vis <unk> . 
 Based on the work of Kepler and probably Descartes , Leibniz develops a model of planetary motion based on the conatus principle , the idea of aether and a fluid vortex . This theory is expounded in the work <unk> de <unk> coelestium <unk> ( 1689 ) . According to Leibniz , Kepler 's analysis of elliptical orbits into a circular and a radial component can be explained by a " harmonic vortex " for the circular motion combined with a centrifugal force and gravity , both of which are examples of conatus , to account for the radial motion . Leibniz later defines the term <unk> conatus , as the " state of change " through which his monads perpetually advance . 
 = = Related usages and terms = = 
 Several other uses of the term conatus , apart from the primary ones mentioned above , have been formulated by various philosophers over the centuries . There are also some important related terms and concepts which have , more or less , similar meanings and usages . Giambattista Vico ( 1668 – 1744 ) defined conatus as the essence of human society , and also , in a more traditional , <unk> sense , as the generating power of movement which pervades all of nature . Nearly a century after the beginnings of modern science , Vico , inspired by Neoplatonism , explicitly rejected the principle of inertia and the laws of motion of the new physics . For him , nature was composed neither of atoms , as in the dominant view , nor of extension , as in Descartes , but of metaphysical points animated by a conatus principle provoked by God . 
 Arthur Schopenhauer ( 1788 – 1860 ) developed a philosophy that contains a principle notably similar to that of Hobbes 's conatus . This principle , Wille zum Leben , or " Will to Live " , described the specific phenomenon of an organism 's self @-@ preservation instinct . Schopenhauer qualified this , however , by suggesting that the Will to Live is not limited in duration . Rather , " the will wills absolutely and for all time " , across generations . Friedrich Nietzsche ( 1844 – 1900 ) , an early disciple of Schopenhauer , developed a separate principle which comes out of a rejection of the primacy of Schopenhauer 's Will to Live and other notions of self @-@ preservation . He called his version the Will to Power , or Wille zur Macht . 
 Sigmund Freud ( 1856 – 1939 ) , greatly depended on Spinoza 's formulation of the conatus principle as a system of self @-@ preservation , though he never cited him directly in any of his published works . Around the same time , Henri Bergson ( 1859 – 1941 ) , developed the principle of the élan vital , or " vital impulse " , which was thought to aid in the evolution of organisms . This concept , which implies a fundamental driving force behind all life , is reminiscent of the conatus principle of Spinoza and others . 
 For Max Scheler , the concept of Drang is the centerpiece of philosophical anthropology and metaphysics . Though his concept has been important throughout his entire philosophical career , it was only developed later in his life when his focus shifted from phenomenology to metaphysics . Like Bergson 's élan vital , Drang ( drive or <unk> ) is the impetus of all life ; however , unlike in Bergson 's <unk> metaphysics , the significance of Drang is that it provides the motivation and driving force even of Spirit ( Geist ) . Spirit , which includes all theoretical intentionality , is powerless without the movement of Drang , the material principle , as well as Eros , the psychological principle . 
 The cultural anthropologist Louis Dumont ( 1911 – 1988 ) , described a cultural conatus built directly upon Spinoza 's seminal definition in <unk> of his Ethics . The principle behind this derivative concept states that any given culture , " tends to persevere in its being , whether by dominating other cultures or by struggling against their domination " . 
 = = Modern significance = = 
 = = = Physical = = = 
 After the advent of Newtonian physics , the concept of a conatus of all physical bodies was largely superseded by the principle of inertia and conservation of momentum . As Bidney states , " It is true that logically desire or the conatus is merely a principle of inertia ... the fact remains , however , that this is not Spinoza 's usage . " Likewise , conatus was used by many philosophers to describe other concepts which have slowly been made obsolete . Conatus <unk> , for instance , became the centrifugal force , and gravity is used where conatus a centro had been previously . Today , the topics with which conatus dealt are matters of science and are thus subject to inquiry by the scientific method . 
 = = = Biological = = = 
 The archaic concept of conatus is today being reconciled with modern biology by scientists such as Antonio Damasio . The conatus of today , however , is explained in terms of chemistry and neurology where , before , it was a matter of metaphysics and <unk> . This concept may be " constructed so as to maintain the coherence of a living organism 's structures and functions against numerous life @-@ threatening odds " . 
 = = = = Systems theory = = = = 
 The <unk> conception of a conatus was a historical precursor to modern theories of <unk> in biological systems . In systems theory and the sciences in general , the concept of a conatus may be related to the phenomenon of emergence , whereby complex systems may spontaneously form from multiple simpler structures . The self @-@ regulating and self @-@ maintaining properties of biological and even social systems may thus be considered modern versions of Spinoza 's conatus principle ; however , the scope of the idea is definitely narrower today without the religious implications of the earlier variety . 
 = Roseville Avenue ( NJT station ) = 
 Roseville Avenue was a transfer station on New Jersey Transit 's Morris & Essex Lines ( consisting of the Montclair Branch , Morristown Line and Gladstone Branch ) in Newark , New Jersey , United States . The station was built by the Delaware , Lackawanna and Western Railroad in 1903 during a track depression to serve Newark 's Roseville neighborhood . It once had two tracks ( one each eastbound and westbound ) on the Lackawanna mainline and two low @-@ wall platforms , with an additional platform along the Montclair @-@ Boonton Line . The station remained in service during most of the 20th century , until New Jersey Transit closed the station on September 16 , 1984 . 
 Today , the only landmarks that mark the former station site are a metal utility box labeled " Roseville , " and several flights of concrete stairs in the sides of the concrete @-@ lined depression in which the track of the Morristown Line runs between the East Orange and Newark Broad Street stations . Shortly eastward of this structure , the Montclair @-@ Boonton Line splits from the Morristown Line on its way to Montclair , Boonton , and Denville .

 Roseville Avenue station consisted of two different sets of double track to serve passenger trains for the Delaware , Lackawanna , and Western Railroad 's Montclair Branch ( now the Montclair @-@ Boonton Line ) and the Delaware , Lackawanna , and Western Railroad 's Morris & Essex Lines ( now the Morristown Line and the Gladstone Branch ) . The tracks were 22 feet ( 6 @.@ 7 m ) below the street level , and the station below street level was a brick passenger station extending to the Roseville Avenue bridge at Seventh Avenue . The other structure stood on street level , above the cut , served the Morris and Essex Line just north of the fork at Roseville . The station had four platforms , two for the Montclair Branch and two for the Morristown / Gladstone Lines in both direction . 
 Roseville Tower was the interlocking tower at street @-@ level in Roseville that handled the nearby fork of the three lines ( Montclair , Morristown and Gladstone ) . The tower was used on limited services , with only three different shifts , two of which were manned . The tower was run from 5 a.m. in the morning to 10 p.m. in the evening manned . The rest of the time , the tower was set on automatic .

 = = = Original station and track depression = = = 
 The original Roseville Avenue station dates back to the opening of the Morris & Essex Railroad Station in 1856 , when tracks were constructed through the Roseville district of Newark . These tracks went along Sixth and Seventh Avenues , while the original station served the Montclair Branch at a fork along Seventh Avenue and the Morris & Essex main line along Sixth Avenue . The station was designed with two platforms , one along each line , the Morris & Essex first made use of the Montclair Branch property in April 1868 after buying the Newark and Bloomfield Railroad . 
 In April 1901 , the Delaware , Lackawanna and Western Railroad announced track depression and raising throughout portions of the line through Newark and the Oranges . Although the depression went into Newark , most of the debate over localities of stations was basically into the Oranges . In 1903 , the track depression reached the Roseville Avenue Station , and the lines were depressed through Roseville . The new station built during the track depression was of similar style , with the station in the middle of the five @-@ track interlocking , with one platform servicing the Montclair Branch 's two tracks and one for the Main Line 's two tracks . Rather than crossing at @-@ grade , Roseville Avenue was bridged over the tracks with a brand new street @-@ level interlocking tower present at the intersection of Roseville and Seventh Avenues .

 During the ownership of the Delaware , Lackawanna and Western Railroad , Roseville Avenue prospered , soon receiving sixty @-@ eight stops by trains daily . This caught attention during a 1913 complaint to the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities by Charles McCausland . The major complaint from McCausland cited that the Lackawanna was not providing quality seating service on trains that stop at Roseville , and several which led to overcrowding , while several bypassing trains did not suffer from such effects . The plaintiff , McCausland , cited that the need for the sixty @-@ eight trains was " additional but unnecessary " . The Board of Public Utility Commissioners did not justify any changes or wrongdoing by the railroad , and as a result , no changes to service were made at Roseville Avenue . 
 The station continued receiving major service over the next five decades , but by 1966 , fewer trains stopped at the station , with limited daily service to the station past the 4 : 33 p.m. train from Hoboken Terminal . Six years later , on June 24 , 1972 , the Erie – Lackawanna Railroad , who now maintained the station , announced further cutbacks on station service , axing twenty @-@ three train stops at Roseville Avenue for both directions of service . The changes were made as part of major commuter service appropriations and the lack of patronage at the station . From that point , Roseville Avenue went from 37 westbound trains to 14 , while eastbound was cut from 37 to 16 . Service on Saturdays were cut to flag stops only , while the station received no Sunday service at all . On April 1 , 1976 , the Erie – Lackawanna Railroad became defunct , and merged into Consolidated Rail Corporation ( Conrail ) , with service sponsored by the New Jersey Department of Transportation . 
 = = = New Jersey Transit use and eventual closure = = = 
 After the takeover of service along the former Morris & Essex Lines by New Jersey Transit from Conrail in 1982 , the service at the Roseville Avenue station remained minimal . Many trains bypassed the station in favor of going to the nearby Newark Broad Street Station . Trains continued to serve the Roseville Avenue station throughout 1982 and 1983 , and service continued to be condensed during 1984 . However , as of the official September 1984 timetables , service was cut from Roseville Avenue in favor of Newark Broad Street to Grove Street , East Orange ( on the Morris & Essex ) or Ampere ( on the Montclair Branch ) , both of which closed in April 1991 . On September 16 , 1984 , trains began bypassing Roseville Avenue , and the station was closed permanently . Although the station was closed , Roseville Tower , for the interlocking between the Montclair Branch and Morris & Essex Lines , remained in service for almost two more decades . In 2002 , during construction of the Montclair Connection , the tower was demolished in favor of expanding the cut in Roseville for a second track of the new Montclair @-@ Boonton Line . 
 = Ivan Jones ( Emmerdale ) = 
 Ivan Jones is a fictional character in the British soap opera Emmerdale , played by Daniel Brocklebank . He appeared in the series from 5 May 2005 until 2 August 2006 . Ivan was originally introduced to participate in a storyline about the character of Jarvis Skelton ( Richard Moore ) and only meant to feature in three episodes . The serial 's producers were impressed with Brocklebank and made Ivan a regular character . The character is a Geordie , which required the actor to adopt the accent . Ivan is characterised as a “ good @-@ humoured " and " charming " dustman , while Brocklebank described him as having " quite a few " love interests and stated that he has " slept his way around the village " . 
 It was later announced that the character is bisexual and he starts a sexual relationship with Paul Lambert ( Mathew Bose ) . Their relationship proved to be an " explosive combination " due to Ivan wanting it to remain a secret . Brocklebank has praised his storyline and spoke of his hopes that it would remove the social stigma attached to bisexuality . His sexuality is accidentally revealed to everyone he knows by Paul . Ivan is later subject to a revenge campaign after he turns down the advances of Paul 's sister , Nicola Blackstock ( Nicola Wheeler ) . She lies that Ivan has been having an affair with her , ruining his relationship with Paul . In April 2006 , Brocklebank announced his decision to leave the serial to concentrate on other projects . The actor said that he had grown " very attached " to Ivan and enjoyed being a part of Emmerdale . He filmed his final scenes in June and Ivan left in August . 
 The character caused controversy when 126 viewers complained to television watch dog Ofcom about Ivan and Paul 's intimacy . The company later cleared Emmerdale of any wrongdoing . Brocklebank said that Christian groups wrote to him condemning him to hell because of Ivan 's sexuality . However , he also had letters from young lesbian and gay people who claimed that Ivan gave them the courage to be themselves . Paul Flynn from The Guardian praised his storyline involving Nicola 's affair lies . Kevin O 'Sullivan from the Sunday Mirror opined that Ivan was clearly gay because he was as " camp as a row of tents " .

 Brocklebank was hired by Emmerdale to play Ivan for a three episode stint . They introduced Ivan as part of the storyline about the character of Jarvis Skelton ( Richard Moore ) getting too old to be a binman . Brocklebank told Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury that the serial 's producers did not intend for his character to develop , but they enjoyed his work and kept him on . They later extended his contract to last into mid @-@ 2006 . Brocklebank found that taking the role gave him a " new respect " for soap opera actors because of how hard he had to work . While the actor is from Warwickshire ; Ivan is a Geordie and has the regional accent . Brocklebank had to put the accent on for the role and members of the public were confused when they heard him speak in person .

 A writer from Emmerdale 's Finnish broadcaster MTV3 described Ivan as being a " good @-@ humoured " , " dark " and " charming dustman " Ivan is revealed to be bisexual and admits his attraction to Paul Lambert ( Mathew Bose ) . Brocklebank told a writer from So So Gay that Ivan had " quite a few " love interests and " slept his way around the village " . When the actor first started the role , Ivan was straight and married . He said that it was not until eight months after he started that he was informed his character would be bisexual . Brocklebank , who is openly gay , said there was a risk of himself becoming " pigeonholed " playing a bisexual character , but added it was not something that worried him . 
 Ivan had previously been married to a woman and he enjoys flirting with females . One such moment is a flirtation with Jasmine Thomas ( Jenna @-@ Louise Coleman ) ; they bond over her liking of the Brontë novels Wuthering Heights and Shirley . When Nicola Blackstock ( Nicola Wheeler ) confesses her attraction to Ivan , he tells her that it is her brother , Paul that he is interested in and kisses him on the cheek . Brocklebank told Laws that he had known Bose for six years prior to joining the serial and was also living with him . He said that it would be " embarrassing " if romance developed between their characters because of their friendship . However , the actor did think it was " great " to be given " such a meaty storyline " . Brocklebank told a reporter from The People that he dreaded to think what his grandmother would make of the storyline . He said he was interested to receive the reaction from viewers because " it 's a subject that hasn 't been covered before " . The actor later said that he found Ivan 's bisexuality " really interesting " because he felt that it had not " really been tackled in soaps before " . Brocklebank later spoke of his belief that there was " still a stigma attached to being bisexual " and his hopes that Ivan 's storyline would " break some barriers " around the issue . 
 Ivan starts to pursue Paul and they start sleeping together . However , Ivan 's lax and secretive attitude to their relationship soon annoys Paul . Bose told a writer from Inside Soap that his character is a " serial monogamist " and " has a lot of love to give " . Ivan is the opposite and he has " been cracking on to all the girls in the village and Paul can 't relate to that " . His bisexuality and secretive nature becomes an issue for Paul ; Ivan cannot offer Paul " 100 per cent – physically , emotionally or spiritually , no matter how much they like each other " . Paul attempts to come to terms with the situation and tries to dump him . The next time they are around each other they struggle to keep their flirtation hidden . Bose added that Ivan still " wants to do everything on the quiet " , which is a " real hardship " for Paul . The dynamic of their relationship proves to be an " explosive combination " . Ivan later has to decide if he is ready for a gay relationship , while Paul weighs up the risks of getting hurt by Ivan . Bose told Laura Davidson from the Sunday Mail that " whether or not Ivan is the one for Paul , I 'd like to see him with someone who makes him happy . " 
 When Paul is tormented by a group of homophobic men , Ivan steps in to rescue him . Brocklebank told Kris Green of Digital Spy that Ivan tells the men that if they have a problem they should take it out on him , not his boyfriend . This is the first time Ivan " actually <unk> it " and he is shocked because " he has ever considered anyone to be his boyfriend before " . Paul then invites Ivan out for dinner with his father , but Ivan is not ready to come out . The actor said that Ivan needs more time until he feels comfortable with the situation . Ivan 's ex @-@ wife Jordan ( Erin <unk> ) caught him with another man , outed him and which resulted in a " horrendous " reaction from those he knew . Brocklebank said that this causes his reluctance to come out again because " he 's become scared about opening himself up to a new community of people and is worried about the villagers ' reaction . " 
 Brocklebank explained the dynamic between the two characters : Paul finds it " extremely difficult " to be in a secretive relationship because he wants different things in a relationship . When Paul does his drag act " Thelma Louise " in the local pub , he mentions that he is a secret relationship . This annoys Ivan and an argument ensues in the toilets . However , Paul has accidentally left his microphone on and Ivan is outed to the whole pub . Brocklebank said that Ivan feels " upset and betrayed " and " deep down he knows he ’ s bisexual but isn ’ t sure if a relationship is going to work with Paul " as he cannot conform to Paul 's ideas about relationships .

 Ivan and Paul 's relationship is tested when " scheming " Nicola attempts to seduce Ivan , despite the fact he is in a relationship with her brother . Ivan is not impressed and rebuffs Nicola 's advances . Wheeler told the Sunday Mail 's Davidson that Nicola trying to seduce Ivan is a " long shot " but she is not ready to give in because she has a " huge crush " on him . She added that the storyline was " hilarious " and " madness " because he is " having sex with her brother and she 's still entertaining the idea of being with him " . Once Nicola sees something she wants , " nothing will stop her " . 
 Nicola sets out to seduce Ivan after an argument with her boyfriend Simon Meredith ( Dale Meeks ) . Wheeler told Allison Maund from Inside Soap that Nicola calls Ivan for " some comfort " and they get drunk and " very cosy " ; but Ivan presumes they are just good friends . Ivan gets out of the shower wearing a towel and is confronted with Nicola " dressed in her sexiest underwear " . Ivan tells Nicola to stop because he loves Paul , but Simon 's mother Lesley Meredith ( Sherrie Hewson ) walks in on them and assumes that they are having an affair . Nicola does not correct Lesley and tells her to believe what she likes and then Paul learns of the situation . Wheeler said that Nicola realises she cannot " get out of the lie now " and even tells her father , Rodney Blackstock ( Patrick Mower ) that she has slept with Ivan . The actress added that " Nicola 's just quite pleased with the fact that she 's got her own back on Ivan " . He confronts her in public and asks her to tell the truth , but she " turns on the waterworks " to get everyone to turn against Ivan . Later Nicola argues with Paul and she tells him that she and Ivan have slept together many times . Wheeler said that Nicola just thinks " Sod it , I 'm going to leave them all stewing " . Her lies ruin Ivan 's relationship with Paul , who believes Nicola 's lies . 
 The serial later played out another chance for Ivan and Paul to be together . While interviewed by Claire Brand from Inside Soap , Bose said that Paul visits Ivan to give him back a CD he left over his house and " both of them realise that they don 't have anything left to say to each other . " Bose opined that Ivan and Paul were " doomed from the start " because he needed Ivan to commit . Rodney thinks that he can reunite Paul and Ivan and sets the pair up . He explained that the two had " just about got over their awkwardness with one another " and Rodney tells the whole pub that it is obvious that Paul and Ivan love each other and need to reconcile . The whole situation is " embarrassing for both of them " and Ivan is furious with Rodney 's intervention . After some " soul searching " , Ivan calms down and " stuns " Paul when he asks him to get back with him . Paul rejects Ivan 's advances , Bose said that Paul normally likes " the big love affair " but this time gives him his " marching orders " . Ivan is left heartbroken once again and decides to take some time away from the village . Bose stated that his character goes to see him off and there is a " terrible silent moment " between the two . He concluded that the audience could clearly see that Ivan and Paul were " kicking themselves " for not saying how they really feel .

 In April 2006 , Brocklebank revealed that he had quit the role and would film his final scenes in June . He told a reporter from Inside Soap that the fact he was originally employed for a guest role ; then staying for a year @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half had been " great " . He added that he was pleased to see Ivan depart the series on a " high note " because he had enjoyed the experience . An Emmerdale spokesperson added that the character would become " a pawn in the rivalry " between his former employer King & Sons and Matthew King ( Matt Healy ) and Sadie King 's ( Patsy Kensit ) new business . In addition they planned a " romantic liaison " for Ivan which would be a " big shock to viewers and villagers alike " . Ivan departed the series in August 2006 when he left to work in Costa Rica alongside fellow character Simon . Brocklebank later told a columnist from the Peterborough Evening Telegraph that he would not rule out a future return because there was " room for the character to go back " . He found leaving " liberating in a way " because he wanted to pursue other projects .

 A scene in which Ivan and Paul shared a kiss on a sofa sparked some controversy with viewers . 126 people complained to media watch dog Ofcom deeming the scenes to be explicit . The company later cleared Emmerdale of any wrongdoing , and a spokesperson said that " Ivan and Paul 's behaviour was no more explicit than that previously exhibited by other characters in the soap . Given the <unk> portrayal of this relationship , we consider that these scenes were acceptable . " While Andy Green of the Liverpool Echo said " Paul and Ivan 's fumble on the sofa was probably the <unk> pre @-@ watershed gay scene ever shown on mainstream TV . " Brocklebank told So So Gay 's reporter that Ivan 's bisexuality storyline had a " huge effect " on the viewers . He revealed that he had received " a lot " of letters from Christian groups telling him that he would go to hell for kissing another male on pre @-@ watershed television . However , he also received many from young gay and lesbian teenagers who had thanked him for " making it easier to come out " because they had someone to relate to . He added that " the majority was very positive " feedback and felt happy to know that his portrayal had helped people face their sexuality . 
 On Ivan and Paul intimacy , Imogen Ridgway of the Evening Standard said that " Emmerdale was never this racy when my gran used to watch it " . She mocked Ivan 's plan to keep his relationship a secret because the village is full of gossips . Suzanne <unk> of the Sunday Mirror reported that viewers were " not impressed " when the " bisexual binman " shared a kiss with Paul . Ivan was labelled as a " hunky binman " by Jane Simon from the Daily Mirror and the Sunday Mercury 's Laws , the latter branded his relationship with Paul a " surprising Emmerdale storyline " . Kevin O 'Sullivan from the Sunday Mirror opined that " Paul 's reluctant bisexual binman lover Ivan the Terrible Queen is as camp as a row of tents " . He added that Nicola was a " <unk> " with a " useless " gaydar for not realising Ivan liked men . Fiona Wynne of the Daily Mirror said that Paul tried hard to get Ivan out of the closet but " he 's hanging on so tightly by his fingertips he 's going to get splinters " . 
 A writer from the Yorkshire Evening Post opined that Ivan and Paul being confronted by homophobic thugs was a " dramatic moment " that made for a " gripping start to 2006 " in Emmerdale . Paul Lang from Lowculture said that he was enjoying the serial because of Ivan 's outing . He added that everyone wanted the two men to get together , " even if Paul is a fucking nightmare and Ivan is very much the wrong side of shifty . " Paul Flynn from The Guardian said that Ivan was a " hot bisexual " and felt that his storyline with Paul and Nicola was " played without resorting to cheap laughter " . Terry Ramsey of the Evening Standard questioned why Ivan even returned to the village after his break . The writer concluded that it was because " Emmerdale is probably the only bisexual @-@ friendly village in Yorkshire " . Upon learning that Brocklebank was leaving the series , the Daily Mail 's Carrie Fitton said that as " the only bisexual binman in the village he had staying power " . 
 = River Witham = 
 The River Witham is a river almost entirely in the county of Lincolnshire in the east of England . It rises south of Grantham close to South Witham at <unk> , passes Lincoln at <unk> and at Boston , <unk> , flows into The Haven , a tidal arm of The Wash , near RSPB Frampton Marsh . The name " Witham " seems to be extremely old and of unknown origin . Archaeological and documentary evidence shows the importance of the Witham as a navigation from the Iron Age onwards . From Roman times it was navigable to Lincoln , from where the Fossdyke was constructed to link it to the River Trent . The mouth of the river moved in 1014 following severe flooding , and Boston became important as a port . 
 From 1142 onwards , sluices were constructed to prevent flooding by the sea , and this culminated in the Great Sluice , which was constructed in 1766 . It maintained river levels above Boston , and helped to scour the channel below it . The land through which the lower river runs has been the subject of much land drainage , and many drains are connected to the Witham by flood doors , which block them off if river levels rise rapidly . The river is navigable from Brayford Pool in Lincoln to Boston , with Locks only in Lincoln , at Bardney and at the Grand Sluice . Passage through the Grand Sluice lock is restricted to short periods when the tidal levels are suitable . The river provides access for boaters to the Witham Navigable Drains , to the north of Boston , and to the South Forty @-@ Foot Drain to the south , which was reopened as part of the Fens Waterways Link , a project to link the river to the River Nene near Peterborough . From Brayford Pool , the Fossdyke Navigation still links to the Trent . 
 = = Route = = 
 The Witham 's course is one of the strangest of British rivers , the result of glaciation ( and possibly isostatic rebound ) redirecting older rivers . The source of the river is on high ground near South Witham , Lincolnshire , from whence it flows generally north , very close to and almost parallel with the Trent around the outskirts of Newark , before turning east towards Lincoln . The upper waters are important for agricultural water extraction , and also for coarse fish such as roach , common bream and pike ; small mammals like water voles , and native crayfish . A gap in the limestone near Ancaster is believed to represent an earlier , straighter course of the upper river towards Boston , leading towards what is now the Slea . 
 From near Claypole to Beckingham , a distance of about three miles , the river forms the boundary between Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire . From North Witham to Long Bennington , the river largely follows the line of the A1 , which crosses the river just north of the <unk> junction near Easton . 
 In Lincoln , the river flows into Brayford Pool and exits along a narrow channel that passes under the mediaeval High Bridge . The bridge not only restricts navigation due to its small size , but the volume of water that can pass through the gap is limited in times of flood . This is alleviated by the <unk> Dyke , which leaves the main channel at Bargate Weir and runs for 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) through the industrial areas to the south of the main city centre . It used to rejoin the main channel at Stamp End , but was re @-@ routed into the South Delph , a drainage ditch constructed by John Rennie in the early 19th century that joins the main channel below Bardney lock . The origins of the Sincil Dyke are unknown , but it is known to have been used as a drainage channel in the mid @-@ 13th century and is thought to be pre @-@ medieval or even Roman . Parts of it were culverted in 1847 to allow the construction of Lincoln Central railway station . 
 From Lincoln , the river again turns first east , then south , making a cut through an belt of upland known as the Lincoln Gap . This section is again believed to have been a lower course of the Trent during and before periods of glaciation . 
 From <unk> near Coningsby to Boston , the north bank of the river was used by a section of the Great Northern Railway from Lincoln to Boston . A long @-@ distance footpath , the Water Rail Way , follows the course of the river from Lincoln to Boston . The path uses sections of the river towpath and abandoned railway tracks , and has been opened in stages , with the final 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) being completed in September 2008 . The path is now part of Route 1 of the National Cycle Network and features a number of sculptures along its length , each commissioned from local artists . They include Lincoln <unk> sheep at <unk> , Lincoln red cows at Washingborough , and Lincoln curly pigs , which became extinct in 1972 , at <unk> . 
 = = History = = 
 The name " Witham " seems to be extremely old , apparently predating Anglo @-@ Saxon , Roman , and even Celtic influence . The meaning is not known . Archaeological evidence points to river navigation as far back as the Iron Age . Artefacts such as the Witham Shield and <unk> Boat have been recovered and are on display at the British Museum in London or The Collection in Lincoln . 
 The Witham , which was originally tidal up to Lincoln , was an important navigation in Roman times . Lincoln ( <unk> ) — the meeting point of Ermine Street , joining London to York , and Fosse Way , leading to Leicester and Bath — was an important Roman fort that became one of only four colonia in Britain . Most important Roman cities were situated near navigable water , which enabled goods to be transported in bulk , but Lincoln did not possess this advantage , and so the Romans constructed the Fossdyke from Lincoln to Torksey on the River Trent , improved the River Witham from Lincoln to The Wash , and built the Car Dyke from Lincoln to the River Cam near Cambridge . The Witham thus gave Lincoln access to the east coast , while the Fossdyke gave access to the Trent and further on to the Humber . 
 Trading continued throughout the medieval period evidenced by the importance of Torksey , which was then a flourishing town , now only a small village . However , the Fossdyke needed much maintenance to keep it clear of silt . Henry I had overseen the scouring of its channel , and there were inquiries in 1335 , 1365 and 1518 to consider the state of the Fossdyke and to compel the inhabitants of the region to maintain it . Lincoln was a centre for the collection of business taxes , but this came at the cost of maintaining the waterways , and having finally decided it was too large a cost , James I presented the Fossdyke to the City of Lincoln . 
 The Witham originally flowed into The Wash at <unk> Haven , where the port of Drayton was established in the Welland estuary , and it was only as a result of massive flooding in 1014 that it diverted itself to flow into The Haven at Boston . This gave rise to the growth of Boston as a port in the 12th and 13th centuries , exporting wool and salt to the Hanseatic League , though Boston only received its charter in 1545 . 
 The river was affected by silting which restricted trade despite the construction of various sluices and barriers from 1142 onwards , when the first sluice was built below Boston . Other sluices were erected at Boston in 1500 and at <unk> in 1543 , but navigation was again difficult on both the river and the Fossdyke by 1660 . In 1671 an Act of Parliament was obtained for the improvement of the Navigation . In 1743 , John Grundy , Sr. and his son John Grundy , Jr. were commissioned to produce a detailed survey of the river . They produced an engraved map in 1743 and a printed report , running to 48 pages , in the following year . The main recommendation was a 7 @-@ mile ( 11 km ) new cut to eliminate the " prodigious meandering course " of the channel above Boston . Although the estimated cost of £ 16 @,@ 200 dissuaded the landowners from taking action at the time , the report formed the basis for improvements in the 1760s . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Following meetings of Landowners held in 1752 and 1753 , they asked John Grundy Jr , as his father had died in 1748 , to re @-@ evaluate his plans from 1744 and consider a plan for a " Grand Sluice " that had been produced by Daniel Coppin in 1745 . Grundy suggested that the 1744 cut should be extended by a further 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) into Boston , and that the sluice could then be built on the extension . The landowners moved the location of the sluice nearer to Boston , but otherwise approved his report , although no action was taken . John Grundy was again consulted in 1757 , and Langley Edwards of King 's Lynn was asked to review the positioning of the sluice in 1760 . The landowners then asked John Smeaton to liaise with Grundy and Edwards , and the three engineers produced a joint report in 1761 , with estimates of £ 38 @,@ 000 for drainage works and £ 7 @,@ 400 for improvements to navigation . The report was approved , although a meeting held in January 1762 decided that the new cut should revert to the alignment suggested by Grundy in 1753 . The location of the Grand Sluice would be as suggested by Edwards in 1760 . Grundy produced another engraved map , and parliamentary approval for the works were obtained in June 1762 . 
 Once the Act of Parliament was obtained , Edwards became the engineer for the project , and drew up the detailed plans , which Grundy and Smeaton checked and altered slightly , after which they had no further involvement with the scheme . Construction was started in April 1763 , and the drainage element of the project , which included the sluice , was finished in 1768 , having cost £ 42 @,@ 000 . Work on three locks and other work connected with navigation cost £ 6 @,@ 000 and continued until 1771 . The locks were located at Stamp End , Kirkstead and Barlings . The Grand Sluice was a major construction which maintained the height of water above Boston to near normal high tide level and had massive flood gates to cope with any tides above this . It was completed in 1766 and was effective in scouring the Haven below it , but actually encouraged further silting of the river above it . 
 The 1762 act created the Witham Navigation Commissioners and the Witham Drainage General Commissioners , who continued to promote drainage schemes actively , creating a drainage network known as the Witham Navigable Drains that transformed much of northern Lincolnshire from fen to farming land . Today many of these channels are managed by the Witham First , Third and Fourth District Internal Drainage Boards and Upper Witham Internal Drainage Board . These four internal drainage boards reduce the flood risk to the surrounding properties , land and environment . 
 In 1791 , as part of the campaign to promote the construction of the Horncastle Canal , the Commissioners of the River Witham asked the engineer William Jessop to assess the state of the Fossdyke Navigation and the Witham , with particular reference to the problems of navigating through Lincoln , where the channel was restricted by a medieval bridge . He proposed two solutions ; the first avoided the route through the city entirely , by utilising the course of the Sincil Dyke to the south , while the second involved lowering the bottom of the channel through the Glory Hole bridge , which was only 18 inches ( 46 cm ) deep at normal water levels . The Commissioners had imposed a toll on all traffic passing under the bridge , but decided that a channel bypassing the city would have grave financial consequences . They opted for improving the existing channel and the work to remove the wooden floor , to lower the river bed under the bridge and to underpin its foundations was completed in 1795 . The Commissioners dropped the collection of tolls at the bridge , but the amount they received from traffic passing through the locks increased as the volume of traffic grew in response to the easier passage through the bridge . 
 = = = The Grand Sluice = = = 
 When completed in 1766 , Edwards ' Grand Sluice consisted of three channels each 17 feet ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) wide , fitted with pointed gates on both sides , and a lock adjacent to the north bank , which could be used as an additional flood relief channel if required . The lock was originally very small , but was lengthened to its current 41 by 12 feet ( 12 @.@ 5 by 3 @.@ 7 m ) in 1881 . The pointed doors on the non @-@ tidal side of the sluice were replaced by steel guillotine gates between 1979 and 1982 . 
 = = = Improvements = = = 
 The state of the Witham had deteriorated by 1802 , and the Commissioners asked John Rennie for advice . He stated that the Kirkstead lock was badly placed , and the associated staunch was in danger of collapse . He recommended that it be demolished and rebuilt elsewhere , and also suggested that access to Boston should be through the Witham <unk> Drains , rather than the Grand Sluice , or that a new cut should be built to the south of the sluice , to rejoin the river at Boston Harbour . In 1803 , he suggested that High Bridge at Lincoln should be demolished and rebuilt . Four years later , he suggested that the locks at Kirkstead and Barlings should be removed , and replaced by one near Washingborough church . The Commissioners petitioned parliament in 1808 , and a new Act of Parliament authorised the work , to be carried out by a company of proprietors . They could borrow £ 30 @,@ 000 for the drainage element of the scheme and £ 70 @,@ 000 for the navigation element . Two new locks were built , one at Stamp End and the other at Bardney , which replaced the original locks . A new channel was cut near <unk> , upstream of Bardney , and the plan for a lock at Washingborough was dropped . While Stamp End lock was being rebuilt , an alternative route was provided , utilising the Sincil Dyke and the South Delph . Rennie recorded that Branston Delph , Carlton Dike , <unk> Delph and Timberland Dike were navigable at the time . The proprietors obtained three more Acts of Parliament , in 1812 , 1826 and 1829 , all with the main aim of allowing more capital to be raised . 
 Tolls on the Witham had gradually risen as improvements had been made . £ 263 was raised in 1763 @-@ 4 , and had reached £ 898 by 1790 . In 1819 , income exceeded £ 4 @,@ 100 for the six months from March to September , and a five per cent dividend was paid in the following year . By 1826 , over £ ! 80 @,@ 000 had been spent on improvements , and another £ 40 @,@ 000 was needed . However , the proprietors were still optimistic , and commissioned Sir John Rennie to investigate an extension to link the Witham to the River <unk> , but although he made two proposals , neither was implemented . Most traffic was carried by sailing vessels of in barges hauled by horses , but in March 1816 , the first steam packet boat arrived on the river . It was named Witham and had been built by Shuttleworth and Robinson , whose yard was on Sincil Dyke . Despite a boiler explosion in March 1817 , fortunately without causing injury to any of the crew or the 30 passengers , a second steam packet was operating by July 1817 , and they soon displaced the sailing packet boats . During a flood in 1828 , one of them lost power when a floating hedge became jammed in the paddle wheels . In the following year , a Lincoln man , William Pool invented a new type of paddlewheel , which resulted in the boats travelling faster , and in 1836 , wooden vessels were superseded by iron packet boats . 
 Railways reached Lincoln in August 1848 , 15 years after the first proposal . The Wakefield , Lincoln and Boston Railway hoped to build railways in the area , and negotiated with the proprietors and those of the Fosdyke . Under the arrangement , they would take over both navigations , and guarantee a fixed income for the proprietors . They would then merge with the London and York Railway . Both proposals had been absorbed into the Great Northern Railway ( GNR ) by the time an Act of Parliament was obtained , but the original agreement was retained , and the GNR leased the Witham for 999 years for a payment of £ 10 @,@ 545 per year to the proprietors . This figure represented the average profits for the previous three years , plus five per cent . The railway company also agreed to pay the interest on mortgages amounting to £ 24 @,@ 692 which the proprietors held , but had redeemed them by 1857 . The railway from Lincoln to Boston ran along the eastern bank of the river , and opened on 17 October 1848 . 
 Most of the stations were located near to the landing stages which the steam packets used , and the railway did all it could to draw passengers away from the river . This included the provision of fourth @-@ class carriages , with fares set at a halfpenny per mile , in 1850 , and by 1863 , the steam packet boats had ceased operation . Freight traffic also declined , with coal passing through the Grand Sluice dropping from 19 @,@ 535 tons in 1847 to 3 @,@ 780 tons in 1857 . Nevertheless , the railway company had to maintain the river , and in 1871 , spent £ 5 @,@ 000 on making Bardney lock deeper by 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) at the request of the drainage commissioners . The GNR leased the navigation to the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Committee in 1882 , and in 1897 , by which time the Manchester , Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway had become the Great Central Railway , they built a large warehouse beside Brayford Pool , with a transhipment dock next to it . Total traffic on the river had fallen to 18 @,@ 548 tons in 1905 , and averaged 5 @,@ 870 tons during the years of the First World War , mainly general merchandise and agricultural produce . With the nationalisation of the waterways following the Second World War , the navigation eventually became the responsibility of British Waterways as a result of the Transport Act 1962 , and since 2 July 2012 has been managed by the Canal & River Trust . 
 = = Current navigation = = 
 Today , commercial traffic , apart from tour boats , has ceased above the port of Boston ( The Haven ) and only pleasure craft carry on through the lock at the Grand Sluice into the Witham . Although the lock is only 41 feet ( 12 m ) long , it is possible for longer boats to pass through it at certain states of the tide . Unlike many such sea locks , the reverse @-@ facing gates close on every tide , as the normal high tide water level is higher than the level of the river , while at low tides there is insufficient water in the Haven to allow exit from the lock . Passage is therefore restricted to a brief period approximately two hours before or after high water . It is still possible to navigate many of the drains in small vessels , and a new lock , completed in December 2008 , provides entry to the South Forty @-@ Foot Drain from below the Grand Sluice so that vessels will be able to reach the Fens without venturing out to the Wash as part of the Fens Waterways Link . 
 The Witham is navigable from Brayford Wharf in Lincoln to Boston . There are two locks between Boston and Lincoln – one at Bardney and the other in Lincoln itself , the Stamp End Lock which is unusually a guillotine lock . The main obstruction to navigation is the High Bridge or Glory Hole in Lincoln , a medieval structure which is only about 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) wide and 2 @.@ 6 metres ( 8 @.@ 5 ft ) high at normal river levels . In times of flood it is unnavigable . The bridge spans the river for 87 feet ( 27 m ) , and consists of an arch built in <unk> , with extensions added in 1235 , 1540 to 1550 and 1762 / 3 . It is the only British bridge which still has secular medieval buildings standing on it , and is believed to be the second oldest masonry arch bridge in the country . It is currently a Scheduled Ancient Monument and a Grade I Listed Building . 
 There are traffic lights on the short section between Brayford Pool and Stamp End Lock , which are used to indicate the state of the river in times of flood . Green indicates that flows are low or normal , and boats can proceed along this stretch . Red indicates that flows are high and that great care is required . Flashing red indicates that flows are very high and boats must not use the section . 
 = = = Connecting waterways = = = 
 There are a number of drains that connect to the River Witham and that are protected by flood doors . These consist of a single pair of mitre gates that are designed to close if the level in the river rises above the level in the drain . Several of these are navigable to the more adventurous boater . The river is also joined by the Kyme Eau , which connects to the Sleaford Navigation on which navigation will eventually be restored to Sleaford . At <unk> Gowt , a lock drops down into the Witham Navigable Drains , a system of drainage ditches which are used to prevent flooding of the fens to the north of Boston . Since November 2008 there has been an active campaign by the Billinghay Skirth Regeneration Society to restore navigation on the River Skirth , and the project has won the support of Billinghay and other parish councils , the Inland Waterways Association , the Environment Agency , Lincolnshire County Council and the Lincolnshire Waterways Partnership .

The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having beaten Cambridge by three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ quarter lengths in the previous year 's race . However Cambridge held the overall lead , with 68 victories to Oxford 's 61 . The race was sponsored by Ladbrokes for the ninth consecutive year . 
 The first Women 's Boat Race took place in 1927 , but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s . Until 2014 , the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races , but as of the 2015 race , it is held on the River Thames , on the same day as the men 's main and reserve races . The reserve race , contested between Oxford 's Isis boat and Cambridge 's Goldie boat has been held since 1965 . It usually takes place on the Tideway , prior to the main Boat Race .

 Oxford were pre @-@ race favourites , and weighed an average of 4 pounds ( 1 @.@ 8 kg ) per rower more than their opponents . Oxford 's crew contained four former Blues while Cambridge featured three . Bruce Philp became the first man to row for both universities , having represented Cambridge in the 1982 and 1983 races . Henrietta Shaw became the first woman to cox the Cambridge boat .

 Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station . A quick start from Cambridge coupled with a poor one from Oxford saw the Light Blues take a third of a length lead before being reined back at Fulham Football Club . A one @-@ second lead at the mile post preceded a period of warnings from umpire Ronnie Howard to both coxes as they contested the same water . Oxford held a canvas ' lead as the crews passed under Hammersmith Bridge and began to move away along Chiswick Eyot . A ten @-@ second lead at Barnes Bridge became a thirteen @-@ second lead at the finishing post , as Oxford took the win by four and three @-@ quarter lengths in a time of 17 minutes 11 seconds . This was Oxford 's tenth consecutive victory , and their eleventh in twelve years , and took the overall record to 68 – 62 in favour of Cambridge . 
 In the reserve race , Oxford 's Isis beat Cambridge 's Goldie by six lengths , while Oxford won the 40th Women 's Boat Race .

Supa Dups and Jason " JG " Gilbert produced the song and Eminem and Mike Strange mixed the song . JG and Supa Dups also sample their own vocals . According to Supa Dups , he was asked to make a beat with JG , without knowing it was for Bad Meets Evil . He said that " [ They ] didn 't even have Eminem in mind [ when they made the beat ] . " According to this interview with Mixtape Daily , Supa Dups had little knowledge about the project , but simply submitted the beat to Eminem : 
 I didn 't even know the project was coming out . I didn 't know what the beat was for ; I just knew Eminem asked me for the files and I sent it to them . ... When I saw Eminem in L.A. for Grammy weekend , Eminem said , ' Yeah , he ripped the track . ' Later on that day , I met Royce , and Royce was like , ' Yeah , download that track man . We ripped that track . That 's the first single . ' I was like , ' What ? ' But until then , I still wasn 't sure . 
 Months after recording the song , on April 28 , 2011 , when it leaked onto the Internet , Supa Dups was impressed by the finished version , " I was like , ' Damn , this record is crazy . ' " He was impressed by the song , lyrically , and was proud to have participated in the project . " Fast Lane " is a midwestern hip hop song . It has two main parts to the song . The first half of the four @-@ minute song begins with a verse performed by Royce da 5 ' 9 " , followed by Eminem 's verse .

 = Croatian War of Independence = 
 The Croatian War of Independence was fought from 1991 to 1995 between Croat forces loyal to the government of Croatia — which had declared independence from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( <unk> ) — and the Serb @-@ controlled Yugoslav People 's Army ( JNA ) and local Serb forces , with the JNA ending its combat operations in Croatia by 1992 . In Croatia , the war is primarily referred to as the " Homeland War " ( <unk> rat ) and also as the " Greater @-@ Serbian Aggression " ( <unk> <unk> ) . In Serbian sources , " War in Croatia " ( <unk> у <unk> / Rat u <unk> ) is the most commonly in use and also the " War in Krajina " ( " <unk> у <unk> / Rat u <unk> " ) . 
 A majority of Croats wanted Croatia to leave Yugoslavia and become a sovereign country , while many ethnic Serbs living in Croatia , supported by Serbia , opposed the secession and wanted Serb @-@ claimed lands to be in a common state with Serbia . Most Serbs effectively sought a new Serb state within a Yugoslav federation , including areas of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina with ethnic Serb majorities or significant minorities , and attempted to conquer as much of Croatia as possible . Croatia declared independence on 25 June 1991 , but agreed to postpone it with the Brioni Agreement and cut all remaining ties with Yugoslavia on 8 October 1991 . 
 The JNA initially tried to keep Croatia within Yugoslavia by occupying all of Croatia . After this failed , Serb forces established the self @-@ proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina ( RSK ) within Croatia . After the ceasefire of January 1992 and international recognition of the Republic of Croatia as a sovereign state , the front lines were entrenched , the United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) was deployed , and combat became largely intermittent in the following three years . During that time , the RSK encompassed 13 @,@ 913 square kilometers ( 5 @,@ 372 sq mi ) , more than a quarter of Croatia . In 1995 , Croatia launched two major offensives known as Operation Flash and Operation Storm , which would effectively end the war in its favor . The remaining United Nations Transitional Authority for Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Sirmium ( UNTAES ) zone was peacefully reintegrated into Croatia by 1998 . 
 The war ended with Croatian victory , as it achieved the goals it had declared at the beginning of the war : independence and preservation of its borders . 21 – 25 % of Croatia 's economy was ruined , with an estimated US $ 37 billion in damaged infrastructure , lost output , and refugee @-@ related costs . A total of 20 @,@ 000 people were killed in the war , and refugees were displaced on both sides . The Serb and Croatian governments began to progressively cooperate with each other but tension remains , in part due to verdicts by the ICTY and lawsuits filed by each country against the other . 
 In 2007 , the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) returned a guilty verdict against Milan Martić , one of the Serb leaders in Croatia , for having colluded with Slobodan Milošević and others to create a " unified Serbian state " . Between 2008 and 2012 , the ICTY had prosecuted Croatian generals Ante Gotovina , Mladen Markač and Ivan Čermak for alleged involvement in the crimes related to Operation Storm . Čermak was acquitted outright , and the convictions of Gotovina and Markač were later overturned by an ICTY Appeals Panel . The International Court of Justice dismissed Croatia and Serbia genocide claims in 2015 . The Court reaffirmed that serious crimes against civilians had taken place , but ruled that specific genocidal intent was not present .

 = = = Political changes in Yugoslavia = = = 
 Since the 1970s , Yugoslavia 's Communist regime became severely splintered into a liberal @-@ <unk> nationalist faction led by Croatia and Slovenia that supported a decentralized federation to give greater autonomy to Croatia and Slovenia , versus a conservative @-@ centralist nationalist faction led by Serbia that supported a centralized federation to secure Serbia 's and Serbs ' interests across Yugoslavia – as they were the largest ethnic group in the country as a whole . From 1967 to 1972 in Croatia and 1968 and 1981 protests in Kosovo , nationalist doctrines and actions caused ethnic tensions that destabilized Yugoslavia . The suppression by the state of nationalists is believed to have had the effect of identifying nationalism as the primary alternative to communism itself and made it a strong underground movement . 
 A crisis emerged in Yugoslavia with the weakening of the Communist states in Eastern Europe towards the end of the Cold War , as symbolized by the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 . In Yugoslavia , the national communist party , officially called the League of Communists of Yugoslavia , had lost its ideological potency . SR Slovenia and SR Croatia wanted to move towards decentralization . SR Serbia , headed by Slobodan Milošević , adhered to centralism and single @-@ party rule , and in turn effectively ended the autonomy of the autonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina by March 1989 , taking command of their votes in the Yugoslav federal presidency . The nationalist ideas started to grow within the ranks of the still @-@ ruling League of Communists , while Milošević 's speeches , notably the 1989 <unk> speech in which he talked of " battles of quarrels " , favored continuation of a unified Yugoslav state — one in which all power would continue to be centralized in Belgrade . 
 In the fall of 1989 , the Serbian government pressured the Croatian government to allow a series of Serb nationalist rallies in the country , and the Serbian media and various Serbian intellectuals had already begun to refer to the Croatian leadership as " Ustaše " , and began to make reference to crimes committed by the Ustaše between 1941 @-@ 45 . The rhetoric was approved by the Serbian political leadership , and accused the Croatian leadership of being " blindly nationalistic " when it objected . 
 Having completed the anti @-@ bureaucratic revolution in Vojvodina , Kosovo , and Montenegro , Serbia secured four out of eight federal presidency votes in 1991 , which rendered the governing body ineffective as other republics objected and called for reform of the Federation . In 1989 , political parties were allowed and a number of them had been founded , including the Croatian Democratic Union ( Croatian : Hrvatska demokratska zajednica ) ( HDZ ) , led by Franjo Tuđman , who later became the first president of Croatia . 
 In January 1990 , the League of Communists broke up on ethnic lines , with the Croatian and Slovene factions demanding a looser federation at the 14th Extraordinary Congress . At the congress , Serbian delegates accused the Croatian and Slovene delegates of " supporting separatism , terrorism and genocide in Kosovo " . The Croatian and Slovene delegations , including most of their ethnic Serb members , eventually left in protest , after Serbian delegates rejected every proposed amendment . 
 January 1990 also marked the beginning of court cases being brought to Yugoslavia 's Constitutional Court on the matter of secession . The first was the Slovenian Constitutional Amendments case after Slovenia claimed the right to unilateral secession pursuant to the right of self @-@ determination . The Constitutional Court ruled that secession from the federation was only permitted if there was the unanimous agreement of Yugoslavia 's republics and autonomous provinces . The Constitutional Court noted that 1974 Constitution 's Section I of the Basic Principles of the Constitution identified that self @-@ determination including secession " belonged to the peoples of Yugoslavia and their socialist republics " . The matter of Kosovo secession was addressed in May 1991 with the court claiming that " only the peoples of Yugoslavia " had the right to secession , Albanians were considered a minority and not a people of Yugoslavia . 
 In February 1990 , Jovan <unk> founded the Serb Democratic Party ( SDS ) in Knin , whose program aimed to change the regional division of Croatia to be aligned with ethnic Serb interests , Prominent members of the SDS including Milan Babić and Milan Martić , later testified that Belgrade directed a propaganda campaign that portrayed the Serbs in Croatia as being threatened with genocide by the Croat majority . On 4 March 1990 , 50 @,@ 000 Serbs rallied at Petrova Gora , and shouted negative remarks aimed at Tuđman , chanted " This is Serbia " , and expressed support for Milošević . 
 The first free elections in Croatia and Slovenia were scheduled for a few months later . The first round of elections in Croatia were held on 22 April , and the second round on 6 May . The HDZ based its campaign on greater sovereignty ( eventually outright independence ) for Croatia , fueling a sentiment among Croats that " only the HDZ could protect Croatia from the aspirations of Milošević towards a Greater Serbia " . It topped the poll in the elections ( followed by Ivica Račan 's reformed communists , Social Democratic Party of Croatia ) and was set to form a new Croatian Government . 
 A tense atmosphere prevailed in 1990 : on 13 May 1990 , a football game was held in Zagreb between Zagreb 's Dinamo team and Belgrade 's Red Star . The game erupted into violence between fans and police . 
 On 30 May 1990 , the new Croatian Parliament held its first session . President Tuđman announced his manifesto for a new Constitution ( ratified at the end of the year ) and a multitude of political , economic , and social changes , notably to what extent minority rights ( mainly for Serbs ) would be guaranteed . Local Serb politicians opposed the new constitution . In 1991 , Croats represented 78 @.@ 1 % and Serbs 12 @.@ 2 % of the total population of Croatia , but the latter held a disproportionate number of official posts : 17 @.@ 7 % of appointed officials in Croatia , including police , were Serbs . An even greater proportion of those posts had been held by Serbs in Croatia earlier , which created a perception that the Serbs were guardians of the communist regime . This caused discontent among the Croats despite the fact it never actually undermined their own dominance in SR Croatia . After the HDZ came to power , many Serbs employed in the public sector , especially the police , were fired and replaced by Croats . This , combined with Tuđman 's remarks , i.e. " they declare that my wife is Jewish or Serbian . Luckily for me , she never was either " , were distorted by Milošević 's media to spark fear that any form of an independent Croatia would be a new " <unk> state " . In one instance , TV Belgrade showed Tuđman shaking hands with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl ( who would be the first government leader in the world to recognise independent Croatia and Slovenia ) accusing the two of plotting " a Fourth Reich " .

 Immediately after the Slovenian parliamentary election , 1990 and the Croatian parliamentary election , 1990 in April and May 1990 , the JNA announced that the Josip Broz Tito @-@ era doctrine of " general people 's defense " , in which each republic maintained a Territorial defense force ( Croatian : Teritorijalna obrana ) ( TO ) , would henceforth be replaced by a centrally directed system of defense . The republics would lose their role in defense matters and their TOs would be disarmed and subordinated to JNA headquarters in Belgrade , but the new Slovenian government acted quickly to retain control over the TO . On 14 May 1990 , the weapons of the TO of Croatia , in regions with Croatian majorities , were taken away by the Army , preventing the possibility of Croatia having its own weapons as was done in Slovenia . . Borisav Jović , Serbia 's representative on the Federal Presidency and a close ally of Slobodan Milošević , claimed that this action came at the behest of Serbia . 
 According to Jović , on 27 June 1990 he and Veljko Kadijević , the Yugoslav Defence Minister , met and agreed that they should , regarding Croatia and Slovenia , " expel them forcibly from Yugoslavia , by simply drawing borders and declaring that they have brought this upon themselves through their decisions " . According to Jović , the next day he obtained the agreement of Milošević . However Kadijević who was of mixed Serb @-@ Croat heritage had been a Yugoslav Partisan in World War II was loyal to Yugoslavia and not a Greater Serbia ; Kadijević believed that if Slovenia left Yugoslavia that the country would collapse and thus he discussed with Jović about possibly using the JNA to impose martial law in Slovenia to prevent a collapse of Yugoslavia and was willing to wage war with the secessionist republics to prevent their secession . Kadijević considered the political crisis in Yugoslavia of ethnic conflict to have been caused by the actions of foreign governments , particularly Germany that he accused of seeking to breakup Yugoslavia to allow Germany to exercise a sphere of influence in the Balkans . Kadijević regarded the Croatian government of Tuđman to be a fascist @-@ inspired and that Serbs had the right to be protected from Croatian " armed formations " . 
 The Serbs within Croatia did not initially seek independence before 1990 . In the 1990 elections , Serb majority municipalities in Croatia largely voted for the Communist Party of Croatia , because the Communist Party was more likely to defeat the nationalist Croatian Democratic Union , than the Serb Democratic Party was . After the election of Tuđman and the Croatian Democratic Union , a Serbian Assembly was established in Srb , north of Knin , on 25 July 1990 as the political representation of the Serbian people in Croatia . The Serbian Assembly declared " sovereignty and autonomy of the Serb people in Croatia " . 
 In August 1990 , an unrecognized mono @-@ ethnic referendum was held in regions with a substantial Serb population which would later become known as the RSK ( bordering western Bosnia and Herzegovina ) on the question of Serb " sovereignty and autonomy " in Croatia . This was an attempt to counter changes made to the constitution . The Croatian government sent police forces to police stations in Serb @-@ populated areas to seize their weapons . Among other incidents , local Serbs from the southern hinterlands of Croatia , mostly around the city of Knin , blocked roads to tourist destinations in Dalmatia . This incident is known as the " Log revolution " . Years later , during Martić 's trial , Babić claimed he was tricked by Martić into agreeing to the Log Revolution , and that it and the entire war in Croatia was Martić 's responsibility , and had been orchestrated by Belgrade . The statement was corroborated by Martić in an interview published in 1991 . Babić confirmed that by July 1991 Milošević had taken over control of the Yugoslav People 's Army ( JNA ) . The Croatian government responded to the blockade of roads by sending special police teams in helicopters to the scene , but were intercepted by SFR Yugoslav Air Force fighter jets and forced to turn back to Zagreb . The Serbs felled pine trees or used bulldozers to block roads to seal off towns like Knin and Benkovac near the Adriatic coast . On 18 August 1990 , the Serbian newspaper Večernje novosti claimed almost " two million Serbs were ready to go to Croatia to fight " . 
 On 21 December 1990 , the SAO Krajina was proclaimed by the municipalities of the regions of Northern Dalmatia and Lika , in south @-@ western Croatia . Article 1 of the Statute of the SAO Krajina defined the SAO Krajina as " a form of territorial autonomy within the Republic of Croatia " in which the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia , state laws , and the Statute of the SAO Krajina were applied . 
 On 22 December 1990 , the Parliament of Croatia ratified the new constitution , which was seen by Serbs as taking away rights that had been granted by the Socialist constitution . The constitution did define Croatia as " the national state of the Croatian nation and a state of members of other nations and minorities who are its citizens : Serbs ... who are guaranteed equality with citizens of Croatian nationality ... " 
 Following Tuđman 's election and the perceived threat from the new constitution , Serb nationalists in the <unk> Krajina region began taking armed action against Croatian government officials , many of whom were forcibly expelled or excluded from the SAO Krajina . Croatian government property throughout the region was increasingly controlled by local Serb municipalities or the newly established " Serbian National Council " . This would later become the government of the breakaway Republic of Serbian Krajina ( RSK ) . 
 After it was discovered that Martin Špegelj had pursued a campaign to acquire arms through the black market in January 1991 an ultimatum was issued requesting disarming and disbanding of Croatian military forces considered illegal by the Yugoslav authorities . Croatian authorities refused to comply , and the Yugoslav army withdrew the ultimatum six days after it was issued . 
 On 12 March 1991 , the leadership of the Army met with the Presidency of the <unk> in an attempt to convince them to declare a state of emergency which would allow for the army to take control of the country . Yugoslav army chief Veljko Kadijević declared that there was a conspiracy to destroy the country , saying : 
 " An insidious plan has been drawn up to destroy Yugoslavia . Stage one is civil war . Stage two is foreign intervention . Then puppet regimes will be set up throughout Yugoslavia . " Veljko Kadijević , 12 March 1991 . 
 <unk> claims that Kadijević and the Army in March 1991 supported a coup d 'etat as a way out of the crisis but then changed their minds four days later . Kadijević 's response to this was that " Jović is lying " . Kadijević claims that a March 1991 meeting two days after the huge protests organized by Vuk Drašković on the streets of Belgrade in Jović 's office to which Kadijević had been invited by Milošević where , according to Kadijević , Milošević requested that the army take control of the country through a military coup . Kadijević 's apparent response was informing Milošević that he could not make such a decision by himself , and that he 'd discuss the request with army leaders and later inform Jović 's office about their decision . Kadijević then said that their decision was against the putsch and that he informed Jović 's office in written form about it . Jović for his part , claims that such document doesn 't exist . 
 Ante Marković has described that after the Presidency meeting failed to achieve the results the Army wanted that Kadijević met with him with the proposed coup d 'etat against the secessionist republics . During the meeting Marković responded to Kadijević by saying that the plan failed to arrest Milošević . Kadijević replied " He is only one fighting for Yugoslavia . Without him , we could not be proposing this . " Marković rejected the plan and afterwards communication between Kadijević and Marković broke down .

 The JNA was initially formed during World War II to carry out guerrilla warfare against occupying Axis forces . The success of the Partisan movement led to the JNA basing much of its operational strategy on guerrilla warfare , as its plans normally entailed defending against NATO or Warsaw Pact attacks , where other types of warfare would put the JNA in a comparatively poor position . That approach led to maintenance of a Territorial Defense system . 
 On paper , the JNA seemed a powerful force , with 2 @,@ 000 tanks and 300 jet aircraft ( all either Soviet or locally produced ) . However , by 1991 , the majority of this equipment was 30 years old , as the force consisted primarily of T @-@ 54 / 55 tanks and MiG @-@ 21 aircraft . Still , the JNA operated around 300 M @-@ 84 tanks ( a Yugoslav version of the Soviet T @-@ 72 ) and a sizable fleet of ground @-@ attack aircraft , such as the Soko G @-@ 4 Super Galeb and the Soko J @-@ 22 Orao , whose armament included AGM @-@ 65 Maverick guided missiles . By contrast , more modern cheap anti @-@ tank missiles ( like the AT @-@ 5 ) and anti @-@ aircraft missiles ( like the SA @-@ 14 ) were abundant and were designed to destroy much more advanced weaponry . Before the war the JNA had 169 @,@ 000 regular troops , including 70 @,@ 000 professional officers . The fighting in Slovenia brought about a great number of desertions , and the army responded by mobilizing Serbian reserve troops . Approximately 100 @,@ 000 evaded the draft , and the new conscripts proved an ineffective fighting force . The JNA resorted to reliance on irregular militias . Paramilitary units like the White Eagles , Serbian Guard , Dušan Silni , and Serb Volunteer Guard , which committed a number of massacres against Croat and other non @-@ Serbs civilians , were increasingly used by the Yugoslav and Serb forces . There were also foreign fighters supporting the RSK , mostly from Russia . With the retreat of the JNA forces in 1992 , JNA units were reorganized as the Army of Serb Krajina , which was a direct heir to the JNA organization , with little improvement . 
 By 1991 , the JNA officer corps was dominated by Serbs and Montenegrins ; they were overrepresented in Yugoslav federal institutions , especially the army . 57 @.@ 1 % of JNA officers were Serbs , while Serbs formed 36 @.@ 3 % of the population of Yugoslavia . A similar structure was observed as early as 1981 . Even though the two people combined comprised 38 @.@ 8 % of the population of Yugoslavia , 70 % of all JNA officers and non @-@ commissioned officers were either Serbs or Montenegrins . In 1991 , the JNA was instructed to " completely eliminate Croats and Slovenes from the army . " 
 = = = Croatian forces = = = 
 The Croatian military was in a much worse state than that of the Serbs . In the early stages of the war , lack of military units meant that the Croatian Police force would take the brunt of the fighting . The Croatian National Guard ( Croatian : Zbor narodne garde ) , the new Croatian military , was formed on 11 April 1991 , and gradually developed into the Croatian Army ( Croatian : Hrvatska vojska ) by 1993 . Weaponry was in short supply , and many units were either unarmed or were equipped with obsolete World War II @-@ era rifles . The Croatian Army had only a handful of tanks , including World War II @-@ surplus vehicles such as the T @-@ 34 , and its air force was in an even worse state , consisting of only a few Antonov An @-@ 2 biplane crop @-@ dusters that had been converted to drop makeshift bombs . 
 In August 1991 , the Croatian Army had fewer than 20 brigades . After general mobilization was instituted in October , the size of the army grew to 60 brigades and 37 independent battalions by the end of the year . In 1991 and 1992 , Croatia was also supported by 456 foreign fighters , including British ( 139 ) , French ( 69 ) , and German ( 55 ) . The seizure of the JNA 's barracks between September and December helped to alleviate the Croatians ' equipment shortage . By 1995 , the balance of power had shifted significantly . Serb forces in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina were capable of fielding an estimated 130 @,@ 000 troops ; the Croatian Army , Croatian Defence Council ( Croatian : Hrvatsko vijeće obrane ) ( HVO ) , and the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina could field a combined force of 250 @,@ 000 soldiers and 570 tanks .

 Ethnic hatred grew as various incidents fueled the propaganda machines on both sides . During his testimony before the ICTY , one of the top @-@ Krajina leaders , Milan Martić , stated that the Serb side started using force first . 
 The conflict escalated into armed incidents in the majority @-@ Serb populated areas . The Serbs attacked Croatian police units in Pakrac in early March , while one Josip Jović is widely reported as the first police officer killed by Serb forces as part of the war , during the Plitvice Lakes incident in late March 1991 . 
 In March and April 1991 , Serbs in Croatia began to make moves to secede from that territory . It is a matter of debate to what extent this move was locally motivated and to what degree the Milošević @-@ led Serbian government was involved . In any event , the SAO Krajina was declared , which consisted of any Croatian territory with a substantial Serb population . The Croatian government viewed this move as a rebellion . 
 More than 20 people were killed by the end of April . From the beginning of the Log Revolution and the end of April 1991 , nearly 200 incidents involving the use of explosive devices and 89 attacks on the Croatian police were recorded . The Croatian Ministry of the Interior started arming an increasing number of special police forces , and this led to the building of a real army . On 9 April 1991 , Croatian President Tuđman ordered the special police forces to be renamed Zbor Narodne Garde ( " National Guard " ) ; this marks the creation of a separate military of Croatia . 
 Significant clashes from this period included the siege of Kijevo , where over a thousand people were besieged in the inner Dalmatian village of Kijevo , and the Borovo Selo killings , where Croatian policemen engaged Serb paramilitaries in the eastern Slavonian village of Borovo and suffered twelve casualties . Violence gripped eastern Slavonian villages : in Tovarnik , a Croat policeman was killed by Serb paramilitaries on 2 May , while in <unk> , a Serb civilian was killed on 5 May when he was caught in a crossfire between Serb and Croat paramilitaries . On 6 May , the 1991 protest in Split against the siege of Kijevo at the Navy Command in Split resulted in the death of a Yugoslav People 's Army soldier . 
 On 15 May , Stjepan Mesić , a Croat , was scheduled to be the chairman of the rotating presidency of Yugoslavia . Serbia , aided by Kosovo , Montenegro , and Vojvodina , whose presidency votes were at that time under Serbian control , blocked the appointment , which was otherwise seen as largely ceremonial . This maneuver technically left Yugoslavia without a head of state and without a commander @-@ in @-@ chief . Two days later , a repeated attempt to vote on the issue failed . Ante Marković , prime minister of Yugoslavia at the time , proposed appointing a panel which would wield presidential powers . It was not immediately clear who the panel members would be , apart from defense minister Veljko Kadijević , nor who would fill position of JNA commander @-@ in @-@ chief . The move was quickly rejected by Croatia as unconstitutional . The crisis was resolved after a six @-@ week stalemate , and Mesić was elected president — the first non @-@ communist to become Yugoslav head of state in decades . 
 Throughout this period , the federal army , the JNA , and the local Territorial Defense Forces continued to be led by Federal authorities controlled by Milošević . Helsinki Watch reported that Serb Krajina authorities executed Serbs who were willing to reach an accommodation with Croat officials . 
 = = = = Declaration of independence = = = = 
 On 19 May 1991 , the Croatian authorities held a referendum on independence with the option of remaining in Yugoslavia as a looser union . Serb local authorities issued calls for a boycott , which were largely followed by Croatian Serbs . The referendum passed with 94 % in favor . 
 The newly constituted Croatian military units held a military parade and review at Stadion Kranjčevićeva in Zagreb on 28 May 1991 . 
 The parliament of Croatia declared Croatia 's independence and dissolved its association with Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991 . The Croatian parliament 's decision was partially boycotted by left @-@ wing parliament deputies . The European Community and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe urged Croatian authorities to place a three @-@ month moratorium on the decision . 
 The government of Yugoslavia responded to the declarations of independence of Croatia and Slovenia with Yugoslav Prime Minister Ante Marković declaring the secessions to be illegal and contrary to the Constitution of Yugoslavia , and supported the JNA taking action to secure the integral unity of Yugoslavia . 
 In June and July 1991 , the short armed conflict in Slovenia came to a speedy end , partly because of the ethnic homogeneity of the population of Slovenia . It was later revealed that a military strike against Slovenia , followed by a planned withdrawal , was conceived by Slobodan Milošević and Borisav Jović , then president of the SFR Yugoslavia presidency . Jović published his diary containing the information and repeated it in his testimony at the Milošević trial at the ICTY . 
 Croatia agreed to the Brioni Agreement that involved freezing its independence declaration for three months , which eased tensions a little .

 In July , in an attempt to salvage what remained of Yugoslavia , the JNA forces were involved in operations against predominantly Croat areas . In July the Serb @-@ led Territorial Defence Forces started their advance on Dalmatian coastal areas in Operation Coast @-@ 91 . By early August , large areas of Banovina were overrun by Serb forces . 
 With the start of military operations in Croatia , Croats and a number of Serbian conscripts started to desert the JNA en masse , similar to what had happened in Slovenia . Albanians and Macedonians started to search for a way to legally leave the JNA or serve their conscription term in Macedonia ; these moves further homogenized the ethnic composition of JNA troops in or near Croatia . 
 One month after Croatia declared its independence , the Yugoslav army and other Serb forces held something less than one @-@ third of the Croatian territory , mostly in areas with a predominantly ethnic Serb population . The JNA military strategy partly consisted of extensive shelling , at times irrespective of the presence of civilians . As the war progressed , the cities of Dubrovnik , Gospić , Šibenik , Zadar , Karlovac , Sisak , Slavonski Brod , Osijek , Vinkovci , and Vukovar all came under attack by Yugoslav forces . The United Nations ( UN ) imposed a weapons embargo ; this did not affect JNA @-@ backed Serb forces significantly , as they had the JNA arsenal at their disposal , but it caused serious trouble for the newly formed Croatian army . The Croatian government started smuggling weapons over its borders . 
 In August 1991 , the Battle of Vukovar began . Eastern Slavonia was gravely impacted throughout this period , starting with the Dalj massacre of August 1991 ; fronts developed around Osijek and Vinkovci in parallel to the encirclement of Vukovar . 
 In September , Serbian troops completely surrounded the city of Vukovar . Croatian troops , including the 204th Vukovar Brigade , entrenched themselves within the city and held their ground against elite armored and mechanized brigades of the JNA , as well as Serb paramilitary units . Vukovar was almost completely devastated ; 15 @,@ 000 houses were destroyed . Some ethnic Croatian civilians had taken shelter inside the city . Other members of the civilian population fled the area en masse . Death toll estimates for Vukovar as a result of the siege range from 1 @,@ 798 to 5 @,@ 000 . A further 22 @,@ 000 were exiled from Vukovar immediately after the town was captured .
