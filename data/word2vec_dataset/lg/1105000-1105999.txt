 Australian Army involvement in UNTAG was formalised in February 1979 by Cabinet , which approved the plan to commit the 17th Construction Squadron , Royal Australian Engineers and Workshop as the main force for deployment . The squadron was to be supplemented by a Field Troop and by members posted from other units throughout the Army , bringing the squadron to a deployment strength of 275 . A headquarters was to be formed , supporting the Chief Engineer at the UNTAG Military Headquarters . The total strength of the force was to be over 300 of all ranks , in what was known as Plan Witan . The unit had been placed on eight weeks ' notice in July 1978 , which was reduced to a week 's notice to move in February 1979 . 
 There was no agreement ( or settlement ) between South Africa and SWAPO , so an order to move was never issued . The Official History noted , " as the weeks passed the unit found it difficult to continue training because all its vehicles , equipment and plant were either in boxes or in a state ready for transhipment " . The notice to move reverted to 30 days in June and pushed out to 42 days in September 1979 , when the unit was formally released from standby . The notice to move was increased to 60 days in March 1982 , and 75 days in November 1986 . In July 1987 , all remaining specific readiness requirements were removed .

 Horner wrote that the government had been following the course of negotiations , " but in view of the history of false alarms they were not inclined to react until Angola , Cuba and South Africa signed the protocol in Geneva " in August 1988 . Two weeks later the UN wrote , asking Australia to reconfirm its previous commitment ; within a month , Cabinet reaffirmed the commitment of a decade earlier . Chief of the Defence Force ( CDF ) General Peter Gration then placed the unit on 28 days ' notice to move . 
 After the notice was reactivated , detailed planning recommenced ( essentially from scratch ) . Changes made to the organisation of the force approved ten years earlier were only minor . After many years of notice , there was still skepticism that the deployment would ever occur . The government and army were cautious about the timing of the commitment of funds ; significant funding was only released in late 1988 , a few months before deployment . The squadron 's equipment deficiencies were valued at $ 16 million , and there was a need to buy $ 700 @,@ 000 of equipment immediately . The UN initially estimated the cost of the entire operation at $ <unk> billion , equivalent to its own budget . The reluctance to commit funds ultimately reduced training of the deployed forces ; Senator Jo <unk> said in Parliament that the Namibia operation nearly fell apart due to a lack of advance funding , and Senator Jocelyn Newman called it disgraceful . The UN General Assembly did not approve the UNTAG budget until 1 March 1989 , less than two weeks before the advance party deployed and after the deployment of the start @-@ up team . Gration authorised Operation Picaresque on 3 March 1989 . In addition to a lack of funds , there was little intelligence on Namibia ; the region was " generally unknown to the Australian public , the policy @-@ makers and to the troops and civilians who deployed there " . 
 = = = Buildup and deployment = = = 
 The first staff were posted to the new contingent headquarters at Holsworthy Barracks in September 1988 . At the same time , Major J.J. Hutchings was deployed as liaison officer to UN HQ in New York . In October , the CDF formally tasked the Chief of the General Staff ( CGS ) to raise , train , equip and support the force for Namibia . By December the two units comprising 1ASC had been raised from more than thirty different units of the Australian Army , and were being trained and prepared for deployment . Equipment , vehicles and weapons were procured , transferred from across the army and prepared at Moorebank ; this included the painting of all vehicles and major equipment items in UN livery and packing items for transport to Namibia . During the buildup it was recognised that the families required support during the deployment , and Network 17 was established to support the mostly Sydney @-@ based soldiers ' and officers ' families . 
 Hutchings was sent to Namibia as a member of the start @-@ up team , arriving in Windhoek on 19 February 1989 . Warren attended the contingent commanders ' briefing at UN HQ from 22 to 24 February 1989 , and then flew with Prem Chand to Frankfurt , West Germany to meet the other senior members of UNTAG . 
 The 1ASC advance party , comprising 36 officers and men , were deployed by USAF C @-@ 5 Galaxy via RAAF Learmonth and Diego Garcia to Windhoek . They arrived at 2 : 00 pm on 11 March 1989 and were met by Australian Ambassador to South Africa Colin MacDonald , Warren and Hutchings . The 17th Construction Squadron advance party of ten deployed by road to Grootfontein on 13 March 1989 . The squadron 's advance echelon , comprising 59 personnel ( including the 14th Field Troop ) , arrived by USAF C5 Galaxy at Grootfontein on 14 March 1989 . The remainder of 1ASC were commended by Prime Minister Bob Hawke at a farewell parade at Holsworthy Barracks on 5 April 1989 . The main body then deployed by RAAF Boeing 707 aircraft on 14 April . 
 The force deployed with a large quantity of construction and other equipment , including 24 Land Rovers , 19 Unimog all @-@ terrain vehicles , 26 heavy trucks , 43 trailers , eight bulldozers and a variety of other road @-@ building equipment such as graders , scrapers and rollers . The support workshop added a further 40 vehicles , and over 1 @,@ 800 tonnes of stores were shipped with the contingent 's equipment . There was a total of over 200 wheeled and tracked vehicles and trailers and a large quantity of dangerous cargo ( demolition explosives and ammunition ) . The UN hired the MV Mistra for the deployment . It departed Sydney on 23 March ; the equipment was unloaded at Walvis Bay in mid @-@ April , moving by road and rail to the South African Defence Force Logistics Base at Grootfontein .

 = = = Operations Safe Passage and Piddock = = = 
 By 31 March , 14th Field Troop had completed its mine @-@ awareness training ; only Lieutenant Stephen Alexander and five others remained at <unk> , the main SADF base in the north of the country . During the early hours of 1 April an SADF aircraft began dropping flares , and mortar rounds landed near the base . This signalled the start of an intense period of conflict , and Alexander 's team was quickly withdrawn to Grootfontein . What had occurred was the infiltration of a large number of PLAN combatants ( about 1 @,@ 600 ) , re @-@ entering Namibia from Angola . Accounts differed , but Hearn stated that all of those interviewed at the time made it clear that " they did not enter Namibia for war , but to seek out the UN " . Reuters reported that SWAPO demanded the right to establish bases in Namibia . The large size of the PLAN forces and the very small number of deployed UN forces ( less than 1 @,@ 000 at the time ) meant that the UN had very little intelligence , and was unable to respond in force . <unk> wrote that the UN should have been informed about the high probability of SWAPO infiltration , but this did not occur . The Australians were the first to know about the incursion , but they only found out informally via church sources at the Pastoral Centre ( the accommodations for headquarters staff ) . 
 The UN had only two police observers in the north of the country at the time , and the South African government pressured the UN to allow its forces to leave their bases and respond . On 1 April the SRSG authorised the SADF to leave their bases , and they responded in force . By 5 April the UN reported that it only had 300 troops in the north of the country , including 97 Australians . On 7 April Reuters reported that Louis Pienaar had assured safe passage out of the war @-@ torn north of the country if fighting ceased , and had called on SWAPO to surrender to the police ; he also warned that if they did not respond , " the police will have no other option than to pursue you with all means at their disposal " . Reuters reported that 73 SWAPO guerillas were killed on 8 April , 34 in a single action . It was later estimated that over the three @-@ week period following the incursion 251 PLAN combatants were killed , with the loss of 21 members of the SADF and other security forces . 
 The SWAPO incursion became a complex political issue , and led to a week of tense negotiations . The UN considered emergency airlifts to bring more peacekeepers into the territory , and the United States offered aid . On 9 April 1989 an agreement was reached at Mount Etjo ( the Mount Etjo Declaration ) , calling for the rapid deployment of UNTAG forces and outlining a withdrawal procedure for PLAN soldiers ( Operation Safe Passage ) under which they would leave the country . Operation Piddock was the name for the Australian part of the operation . Horner wrote that if UNTAG were to play any role in ending the fighting , it was obvious that the Australians would be the key component . This was complex , and required authorisation from Gration and Defence Minister Kim Beazley for Australian troops to supervise the withdrawal of insurgent forces . It required the Australian Army engineers and British signallers to work as infantry , manning border and internal @-@ assembly points . At the time , these were the only units which could be redeployed quickly to northern Namibia . 
 The aim of the operation was to facilitate the withdrawal of PLAN combatants . South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha confined all South African troops to their base for 60 hours , allowing SWAPO guerillas to leave the country unhindered . Nine assembly points were established by the UN , with up to twelve soldiers and five military observers at each . Six of the assembly points ( <unk> ) were led by Australians : Captain Richard Bradshaw ( contingent signals officer ) at AP Charlie ( Ruacana ) , Sergeant Kerry Ponting ( Squadron workshop ) at AP Foxtrot ( <unk> ) , Captain Mark <unk> ( Squadron Operations Officer ) at AP Juliet ( <unk> ) , Lieutenant Stephen Alexander ( Field troop commander ) at AP Delta ( Beacon 7 , west of <unk> ) , Lieutenant Mark Broome ( Plant Troop Officer ) AP Bravo ( Ruacana ) and Lieutenant Pat Sowry ( Liaison Officer ) AP Kilo ( <unk> ) . Most of the assembly points had intense media scrutiny . The intention of the operation was for PLAN combatants to assemble at these points . They would then be escorted across the border north to the 16th parallel to their bases of confinement , but the operation was unsuccessful . Very few PLAN combatants passed through these points ; for the most part , they withdrew across the border by walking independently . It was estimated that 200 to 400 PLAN members remained in Namibia , absorbed into the local community . Agreement was subsequently reached in late April that the SADF personnel be restricted to their bases from 26 April ; in effect , hostilities ended after that date . 
 This was a stressful time for Australian soldiers deployed to these checkpoints . The South Africans were determined to intimidate the UN forces , and SWAPO casualties occurred in the immediate vicinity of several checkpoints . The South Africans set up in force immediately adjacent to many checkpoints , pointed machine guns at the Australians and demanded that they hand over SWAPO soldiers who had surrendered . The Australian and British soldiers were outnumbered and out @-@ gunned . Despite the fact that only nine SWAPO appeared at the points , the operation was a political success . Lieutenant Colonel Neil Donaldson , commander of the British contingent , said that " the world press showed Australian and British soldiers standing up to a bunch of South African bullies " . Crocker said that the fact that the Australian soldiers completed this operation without any casualties was a tribute to the " training standards of the Australian Army and perhaps , a bit of good luck " . The conclusion of Operation Piddock meant that the Australians were able to begin their engineering tasks . 
 = = = Return of refugees = = = 
 The UN plan required that all exiled Namibians be given the opportunity to return to their country in time to participate in the electoral process . This was implemented by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , supported by a number of other UN agencies and programmes . In Namibia , the Council of Churches in Namibia ( CCN ) was UNHCR 's implementing partner . Most returning Namibians returned from Angola ; many came from Zambia , and a small number came from 46 other countries after the proclamation of a general amnesty . The logistics of managing the returnees was largely delegated to the Australian contingent . 
 Three air and three land entry points were established , as well as five reception centres . Four centres were designed by Namibia Consult Incorporated under the directorship of Klaus <unk> , and constructed by the Australian contingent . The centres were located at Dobra , <unk> ( near Grootfontein ) and at Ongwediva and <unk> in Ovamboland . They were administered under the auspices of the Repatriation , Resettlement and Reconstruction Committee of the CCN . 
 The 8th Construction Troop ( under Lieutenant Geoff Burchell ) constructed a camp and managed the reception centre at <unk> , less than 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) from the Angolan border ; the 9th Construction Troop ( under Lieutenant Andrew <unk> ) constructed a similar camp and managed the reception centre at Ongwediva . The SADF continued attempts to intimidate the Australians and disrupt operations , but their actions had little effect . In late April an SADF aircraft dropped flares at night over the 9th Construction Troop base at Ongwediva , and explosions ( possibly mortar rounds ) were heard nearby . 
 Security , services and logistics at the reception centres were provided by the military component of UNTAG , and a number of secondary reception centres were also established . The movement of returnees through the centres was quick , and the repatriation programme was very successful ; a UN official report stated that the psychological impact of the return of so many exiles was perceptible throughout the country . There were some problems reported in the north , where ex @-@ Koevoet elements searched villages for SWAPO returnees ; however , the UN reported that this was kept under constant surveillance by UNTAG 's police monitors . By the end of the process , 42 @,@ 736 Namibians had been returned from exile . 
 = = = Accommodation and other works = = = 
 For the remainder of its deployment , the first contingent focused most of its efforts on providing accommodations for electoral centres and police stations . These were typically manned by only two or three police ( or civilian ) electoral staff and were almost always in small , remote villages . Buildings were leased , a large number of caravans purchased and deployed and prefabricated buildings constructed in about 50 locations . Much of this was done by the Resources Troop ( under Lieutenant Stuart Graham ) , centrally controlled by squadron construction officer Captain Shane Miller . 
 The largest plant task undertaken during the deployment was the construction of an airstrip at Opuwo . The squadron commander , Major David <unk> , described how the road network in Namibia was better than expected ; in retrospect , the squadron brought too much heavy road @-@ making equipment . The squadron deployed 20 members of the Plant Troop ( under Captain Nigel Catchlove ) to Opuwo . Over a period of four months , Sergeant Ken Roma constructed an all @-@ weather airstrip in one of the most remote parts of Namibia . 
 = = = Force rotation = = = 
 The first contingent returned to Australia in September and October 1989 , Warren reporting that he was " amazed that none of his men was killed or seriously hurt during the tour of duty " . Planning for the second contingent had begun as soon as the first contingent had deployed . Colonel John Crocker was appointed as the contingent commander , and was given the task of raising the force . Unlike the first contingent , which had been built around the 17th Construction Squadron and had maintained that unit 's structure , the second contingent had to be built from scratch . It deployed to Namibia between September and early October 1989 . 
 = = = Election preparation and Operation Poll Gallop = = = 
 The security environment in Namibia changed in the lead @-@ up to the election , including violence in Namibia and an increase in fighting between FAPLA and UNITA troops across the border in Angola . Horner wrote that the Australian contingent was not directly involved in " dealing with the violence " , but the increased violence changed the nature of the mission . It was initially envisioned that the military component of UNTAG would only provide communications and logistic support to the election . In September the role was broadened to include hundreds of electoral monitors , and in October ( after detailed planning and reconnaissance of all polling stations ) the Australian contingent deployed a ready @-@ reaction force . At the same time the 15th Field Troop ( under Lieutenant Brent Maddock ) was deployed , making the first entry into a live minefield by Australian troops since the Vietnam War . 
 Operation Poll Gallop was the name given to the largely logistic operation to support the Namibian elections . Activities began with 1ASC from May 1989 onward , but became the primary task for 2ASC : 
 Service support : Support was provided to approximately 500 electoral centres and police stations through the siting and erection of permanent ( or portable ) accommodations and the provision of essential services . UNTAG deployed over 350 polling stations ; the Australian contingent constructed and provided support ( including sanitary facilities ) at 120 stations in the northern areas of Kaokoland , Ovamboland and West <unk> . 
 Construction engineering : This included the construction , modification or upgrade of UNTAG working and living accommodations , provision of essential services ( power , water and air @-@ traffic @-@ control facilities ) and the maintenance and upgrade of roads . 
 Ready Reaction Force : The squadron formed a reinforced Field Troop ( 50 soldiers ) in <unk> mine @-@ proof vehicles as a ready @-@ reaction force at <unk> , deploying to the 15 most @-@ sensitive locations in Ovamboland and practising actions to stabilise a hostile ( but not violent ) situation in which Australians might be involved . On two occasions during the November 1989 election , the ASC Ready @-@ Reaction Force was used to disperse rioters . 
 Australian military electoral monitors : The Australian contingent provided a team of thirty monitors headed by Lieutenant Colonel Peter Boyd , legal officer for the second contingent . 
 Colonel John Crocker , commander of 2ASC , wrote : " For much of the mission , but particularly during the lead @-@ up to the election , all members of the ASC worked , often well away from their bases , in a security environment which at best could be termed uneasy and on many occasions was definitely hazardous . The deeply divided political factions , which included thousands of de @-@ mobilised soldiers from both sides , had easy access to weapons including machine guns and grenades . This situation resulted in a series of violent incidents including assassinations and reprisal killings which culminated in the deaths of 11 civilians and the wounding of 50 others in street battles in the northern town of <unk> just before the election " . Land mines and unexploded ammunition continued to cause injury and death ; even during the week of the election , there were incidents . 
 = = = Post @-@ election and return to Australia = = = 
 After the election , the contingent was able to focus almost exclusively on construction tasks . In addition to ongoing maintenance , these included taking over barracks and accommodations from the SADF and twelve non @-@ UNTAG tasks in support of the local community as nation @-@ building exercises . These included : 
 Opuwo airfield : The major task was the completion of the airfield upgrade at Opuwo begun by the first contingent . A detachment from Captain Kurt Heidecker 's Plant Troop , supported by a section from 9th Construction Troop , worked over Christmas to complete these works ( which included resurfacing and shaping the runway , drainage and installing culverts ) . 
 <unk> Catholic Mission hydroelectric plant : A team under Lieutenant Nick Rowntree upgraded a 900 @-@ metre supply channel for the <unk> hydroelectric plant . 
 Classrooms in Tsumeb : Sappers from the rear of the squadron constructed a number of classrooms for an Anglican school in a black neighbourhood in Tsumeb with funds provided by the Australian Liaison Office . 
 Other tasks carried out by the squadron included Operation Make Safe , which took place in February and March 1990 . The Field Troop conducted a reconnaissance of 10 known minefields , repaired perimeter fences and installed signs . 
 The contingent began preparations for its return to Australia in December 1989 . In January 1990 new works stopped , manning of forward bases was reduced and stores and equipment were packed and prepared for sea . The Australian forces returned in four sorties on chartered commercial aircraft , the first departing Namibia on 6 February . The contingent 's equipment loaded aboard the MV Kwang Tung , which left Walvis Bay on 22 February . The withdrawal included support from Australian logistics experts , a psychologist to conduct end @-@ of @-@ tour <unk> and a finance officer . The last demolition task was undertaken at <unk> on 25 March , and the last elements of the rear party left Namibia on 9 April 1990 . During the deployment there were no fatalities ; although at least 10 soldiers were treated for malaria , there were few serious injuries . 
 = = Commendations and Honour Distinction award = = 
 A number of governments linked the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to UN Peacekeepers in 1988 to the UNTAG operation , but the award was shared by peacekeepers and peacekeeping operations worldwide . Secretary @-@ General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar mentioned a number of UN peacekeeping operations ( including Namibia ) in his Nobel lecture in Oslo on 9 January 1989 . Senator Graham Richardson also made similar comments in the Australian Senate . 
 The Australian UNTAG contingents were awarded a Chief of the General Staff Commendation . The award was presented to both contingents by Defence Minister Beazley at a 2 March 1990 parade in Holsworthy honouring those who had served in eleven UN ( and other ) peacekeeping operations . 
 In April 2012 , Army Chief Lieutenant General David Morrison , AO approved a recommendation for the award of the first Honour Distinction to the 17th Construction Squadron . This is awarded to units ( or sub @-@ units ) in recognition of service under operational conditions in security @-@ related , peacekeeping , peace enforcement and similar operations . The award was presented to the unit by Governor @-@ General Quentin Bryce on 11 May 2013 .

 = = = Force Chief Engineer = = = 
 The appointment of Colonel Richard Warren as Chief Engineer was opposed by both Marrack Goulding ( UN Undersecretary General for Special Political Affairs ) and Cedric Thornberry ( Director of the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary @-@ General ) . The UN had planned on a civilian filling this role and working primarily with civilian contractors ; in all subsequent UN missions , the senior engineer was a civilian . The UN resisted appointing Warren until the " last minute " , with final approval only given on 1 March . Warren recalled that this gave him " an abnormal amount of authority and a remarkable degree of responsibility " . 
 = = = Weapons and rules of engagement = = = 
 The contingents were faced with a number of issues concerning weapons and rules of engagement : 
 Rules of Engagement : A major issue for the contingents concerned Rules of Engagement ( ROE ) and Orders for Opening Fire ( <unk> ) . In 1989 the UN had no doctrine in this area , and was unable to develop any during the mission . The Australian contingent used standard ROE prepared before the deployment . 
 Machine guns : The UN required the Australians to deploy without the belt @-@ fed M60 machine gun , the standard section @-@ level automatic weapon at the time . Instead , the contingent was required to deploy with World War II @-@ vintage Bren light machine guns , since these used only a 30 @-@ round magazine ( the weapons had been rebuilt to accept 7.62mm ammunition ) . 
 Deployment without weapons : On a number of occasions , soldiers were asked to deploy without weapons by UNTAG civilian officials . Early in the deployment Lieutenants Burchell and <unk> were asked by UNHCR to conduct an unarmed reconnaissance , but permission was refused . Near the election , Australian military electoral monitors were asked to deploy in civilian clothes without weapons . 
 = = = Land mines and UXO = = = 
 Land mines were used by the SADF and SWAPO and became a major feature of the war , triggering the development of mine @-@ protected vehicles ( MPV ) . The SADF typically laid marked , fenced , anti @-@ personnel minefields as perimeter protection for bases and vital assets . It laid a reported 45 @,@ 000 mines during the conflict , of which 3 @,@ 000 were unaccounted @-@ for when UNTAG arrived . SWAPO used mines for ambushing or intimidation . Mines were laid individually or in clusters ; anti @-@ tank mines were often stacked . The mines were obtained from South Africa , the USSR , Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia . After initial training by the SADF 's 25th Field Squadron , an early task of the Field Troop was to conduct mine @-@ awareness training for the other contingents . For the remainder of the deployment , much of the work of the 75 field engineers was clearing exposed mines , marking minefields and clearing routes . Crocker wrote , " for the first time since the Vietnam War , Australian Sappers hand cleared their way into live minefields on seven separate occasions to destroy exposed mines . Similar mines killed several civilians and many animals during the mission . Field engineers of the contingent destroyed over 5 @,@ 000 items of unexploded ordnance ( UXO ) ranging from artillery shells , through RPG rockets to grenades . UXO , a legacy of the 20 @-@ year Bush War , posed a major hazard to local inhabitants in the northern provinces and to UNTAG personnel in that area " . 
 To support the deployment , the UN leased a number of mine @-@ protected vehicles from the SADF . Most were <unk> , but smaller numbers of <unk> and Wolf vehicles were also leased . These vehicles had excellent mobility , and were well @-@ suited to operations in the harsh Namibian terrain . The contingent also trialled thermal @-@ intensifier technologies , in what is thought to be the first operational use of this technology . 
 = = = Radio communications = = = 
 One of the major difficulties early in the deployment to Namibia was poor radio communications . The Australian contingent was equipped with PRC @-@ F1 HF radios ( manufactured by AWA ) , first issued to the Australian army in 1969 . Output power was limited to one or ten watts PEP . HF radio communications were frequently impossible in the early month or two of the deployment . The primary factor was the March 1989 geomagnetic storm , exacerbated by skip zone , and ground plane effects resulting from the sandy environment and the high water table . Detachments were often out of radio contact for extended periods , with no satisfactory alternate means of communication except couriers . Because the Australian force operated over large distances , with troop deployments often up to 700 kilometres ( 430 mi ) from squadron or force headquarters , courier communications often took days . Later in the deployment , the UN provided the contingent with higher @-@ powered ( <unk> ) Motorola <unk> X state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art HF equipment . 
 = = = Controversy and intimidation = = = 
 A number of observers noted that the UNTAG soldiers were not particularly popular with Namibia 's 80 @,@ 000 white residents . Shortly after the Australian advance party arrived in Namibia a pro @-@ Pretoria newspaper accused Australian officers of breaching UN impartiality by attending a cocktail party at which leading members of SWAPO were present , and the incident was widely reported in the international press . Soon afterwards , four Australian and four British soldiers were beaten by a large crowd in Tsumeb , about 70 kilometres ( 43 mi ) from squadron headquarters in Grootfontein . During the first few weeks of the deployment , on a number of occasions SADF soldiers discharged firearms in the direction of the Australian contingent or pointed firearms at Australians as a means of intimidation . Corporal Paul Shepherd reported that during Operation Piddock , an SADF soldier threw a grenade ( which did not explode ) at his assembly point near Ruacana ; during the night the South Africans fired in their direction , putting bullet holes in their Unimog truck . 
 = = = Other concerns = = = 
 Before the deployment there was controversy about the government 's non @-@ resolution of repatriation entitlements and peacekeeper coverage under the Veterans ' Entitlements Act , and it had not decided if the deployment would be considered operational service . The pay and allowance issues were resolved ; many other conditions @-@ of @-@ service issues were identified , but not resolved . During the deployment few issues were brought to Parliament 's attention , although the issue of mail censorship was raised . During the second contingent 's rotation , the soldiers ' families had a full @-@ time welfare officer tasked with supporting them . 
 After the deployment , the issues of appropriate service conditions , awards and recognition took many years to resolve . After serving the required 90 @-@ day period , contingent members were entitled to the Australian Service Medal ( ASM ) for non @-@ warlike service . About 12 years after their return to Australia , the government changed the status of the operation ; contingent members were eligible for the Returned from Active Service Badge , and their <unk> were upgraded to the Australian Active Service Medal ( AASM ) . After the 2002 decision Major Nigel Catchlove wrote to the Army newspaper , calling it a " pointless upgrade " and saying it " detracts from the award of the AASM to those who truly deserve it " . In his letter , Catchlove compared the UNTAG operation to two subsequent operations : the 1st Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment deployment to Somalia during Operation Solace and the deployment of service personnel as part of the International Force for East Timor : " both of those operations involved robust rules of engagement appropriate to the intervention of forces in UN @-@ sanctioned , US or Australian @-@ led multi @-@ national coalitions . UNTAG by way of contrast was a classic peacekeeping operation led by the UN in a relatively benign environment where rules of engagement were focused only on force protection " . Catchlove questioned the " half @-@ hearted approach to implementing this appalling decision " in which eligible people must apply for the upgrade , saying this " failed the test of commonsense " .

 Live in Atlantic City is a live concert film by American recording artist Beyoncé . It was released on November 22 , 2013 by Columbia Records as part of the home media release of her autobiographical television film Life Is But a Dream . The concert film contains footage from Beyoncé 's four @-@ night residency show in the venue Revel Atlantic City in May , 2012 and was directed by Ed Burke and her . It encompasses live performances of twenty one songs , in addition to a new song by Beyoncé , " God Made You Beautiful " . 
 After the concert film was released , videos of three performances from the concert were released online on Beyoncé 's YouTube channel — " Schoolin ' Life " , " Dance for You " and " Party " . Live in Atlantic City was commercially successful , charting in the top ten in various DVD charts worldwide . The two @-@ disc set of Life Is But a Dream / Live in Atlantic City peaked at number one on the US Billboard Top Music Videos chart and the UK Music DVD Chart , becoming the singer 's fourth and first chart topper in the countries respectively . It was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) and gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association ( ARIA ) .

 On February 16 , 2013 , Beyoncé released Life Is But a Dream , an autobiographical television film . Released on the HBO channel , it garnered 1 @.@ 8 million viewers for the initial broadcast , becoming the largest audience for a documentary since Nielsen Media Research revised its method of measuring viewership in 2004 . However , critical commentary towards Life Is But a Dream was mixed with divided opinions by critics . 
 The film 's home media release in a DVD and Blu @-@ ray format was announced on October 30 , 2013 along with a trailer . During the video , it was revealed that the release included a two @-@ disc set , with the second part , Live in Atlantic City , being bonus concert footage filmed during Beyoncé 's four @-@ night residency show Revel Presents : Beyoncé Live at Revel Atlantic City in May 2012 . A new song titled " God Made You Beautiful " was also featured on the concert film and heard as the background music in the trailer . The home media release was made available for pre @-@ order on November 1 , 2013 . Live in Atlantic City was first released in Germany and the Netherlands on November 22 , 2013 as part of the two @-@ disc set of Life Is But a Dream . Three days later , the DVD was also released in the US , Canada and the UK and the Blu @-@ ray version was released in the latter country the same day . In the US , the Blu @-@ ray format was released on December 17 , 2013 . 
 After the concert film was released , videos of the performances of three songs were released online . The performance of " Schoolin ' Life " from the DVD was previewed on Beyoncé 's official YouTube page on November 25 , 2013 . A writer of Vibe magazine felt that the laser light show from the performance " brighten [ ed ] up Atlantic City " . The performance of " Dance for You " was also uploaded to the singer 's channel two days later . The live rendition of " Party " was the final uploaded video from the concert film on December 2 . John Walker of MTV reviewed it positively writing , " The sparkling , goddess @-@ like centerpiece in a swirling sea of pink feathers , Beyoncé shines like a true showgirl on stage . Thankfully , unlike the 1995 camp classic , none of her backup dancers look nefarious enough to try anything funny " . Walker further praised Beyoncé 's vocals and dance moves as " on point as always " and the " flawlessly <unk> bustier " she wore .

 The film contains live performances of twenty one songs along with a new song , " God Made You Beautiful " , written by Australian singer @-@ songwriter Sia Furler . Several short excerpts of the performances found on the concert film are also featured in Life Is But a Dream itself . The film opens with Beyoncé appearing in front of a large screen with her silhouette being seen . As the music of " End of Time " starts , she performs a choreography with her female dancers and French duo Les Twins on stage further singing the song 's lyrics . " Get Me Bodied " follows with a similarly choreographed performance and for the third song " Baby Boy " , the singer dances with her background dancers in front of a holographic background performing a Dutty Wine dance at the end . " Crazy in Love " and " Diva " are featured as the fourth and fifth song respectively . " Naughty Girl " is preceded by a video projection with a voice @-@ over by Beyoncé talking about female sexuality . A snippet of Donna Summer 's " Love to Love You Baby " is interpolated within it and the singer performs the song with her female dancers . She continues with " Party " for which a prominent Las Vegas showgirl theme is featured . 
 Prior to starting " Dance for You " , Beyoncé announces to the audience that she is going to dance to the song without singing it .

 = Mark Bavaro = 
 Mark Bavaro ( born April 28 , 1963 ) is a former American football tight end who played for the New York Giants ( 1985 – 1990 ) , Cleveland Browns ( 1992 ) , and Philadelphia Eagles ( 1993 – 1994 ) in the National Football League ( NFL ) . Bavaro was selected to the Pro Bowl for his performances in the 1986 and 1987 seasons and was a member of the Giants teams that won Super Bowls XXI and XXV . 
 After an All @-@ American career at the University of Notre Dame , Bavaro was drafted by the Giants in the fourth round ( # 100 overall ) in the 1985 NFL Draft . He quickly emerged as a starter in his rookie season and became renowned during his Giants career for his blocking , toughness , and receiving skills . After a degenerative knee condition forced him to sit out the 1991 season , he returned to play three seasons for the Browns and Eagles before retiring in 1995 . Since retiring Bavaro has done work as a pro @-@ life activist . His brother David also played in the NFL for four seasons . 
 = = Early life and college = = 
 Bavaro was born in Winthrop , Massachusetts . He attended Danvers High School in Danvers , Massachusetts , where he was a high school football All @-@ American . He was a well @-@ rounded athlete who also excelled in track and field at Danvers . After being intensively recruited by several colleges , he chose to play collegiately for the University of Notre Dame . He was recruited by head coach Dan Devine but played his four years under coach Gerry Faust . He played behind star tight end Tony Hunter as a freshman , then missed all but three minutes of his sophomore season due to a hand injury . He established himself as a starter as a junior , but grew home @-@ sick and briefly contemplated quitting the team to move back home following the season . After Faust talked him into staying , he won All @-@ America honors his senior season , when he totalled 32 receptions for 395 yards . Bavaro developed a reputation for playing through injuries while at Notre Dame . " He plays with pain better than any player I 've seen in my 37 years of coaching " Faust later stated . He left Notre Dame after graduating in 1985 despite having one season of eligibility remaining ( due to the redshirt status of his sophomore season ) and was selected in the fourth round ( # 100 overall ) of the 1985 NFL Draft by the New York Giants . 
 = = Professional career = = 
 Coming out of college , Bavaro was known mostly for his blocking ability and was expected to play the role of a run blocking tight end as a professional . He earned the nickname " Rambo " early in his rookie season due to his intense playing style , quiet personality , and physical resemblance to Sylvester Stallone . After starting tight end Zeke Mowatt suffered a season @-@ ending injury before the start of the 1985 season , coach Bill Parcells , who had called Bavaro the most impressive rookie during training camp , installed Bavaro as the starter . Bavaro finished his rookie season with 37 receptions , 511 yards , and 4 touchdowns . He also set a team record with 12 receptions in one game during quarterback Phil Simms ' 513 yard passing effort against the Cincinnati Bengals on October 13 , 1985 . After the game , which the Giants lost 35 – 30 , Bavaro responded in the low @-@ key manner that would typify his career , " [ i ] t was nothing special , the plays were the same stuff . I don 't know what they did . I just caught a lot of balls . I 'd rather win , that 's all . " Bavaro was named to the NFL All @-@ Rookie team for his performance during the season . 
 Bavaro continued his emergence in the 1986 season . He remained the starter after Mowatt 's recovery from injury and emerged as a favorite target of Simms . He finished the season with 66 receptions , 1 @,@ 001 yards , and 4 touchdowns and was selected to his first Pro Bowl . His 66 receptions broke the Giants record for receptions by a tight end previously held by Bob Tucker ( 59 ) . Perhaps the most well @-@ known play of Bavaro 's career occurred in a Monday Night Football game in 1986 . Here is a description of the play taken from a Monday Night Football broadcast in 2005 : " On Dec. 1 1986 , New York Giants tight end Mark Bavaro cements his reputation as one of the toughest men in the NFL . With the Giants trailing , Bavaro catches an innocent pass from Phil Simms over the middle . It takes nearly seven 49ers defenders to finally drag him down , some of which are carried for almost 20 yards , including future Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott . Bavaro ’ s inspiring play jump starts the Giants , who win the game and eventually the Super Bowl . " This reputation as a tough player was further cemented later in the season when he played for six weeks with a broken jaw that forced him to sip food through a straw . He continued to establish his reputation as an excellent blocker during the season , and was described as " the premier tight end " in the league by 49ers ' coach Bill Walsh before the team 's playoff matchup . The Giants finished the regular season 14 – 2 and defeated the Denver Broncos 39 – 20 in Super Bowl XXI . After the season Bavaro was chosen to appear on the cover or Sports Illustrated 's NFL preview issue for the 1987 season . Bavaro was pictured on the cover in a cutoff shirt holding his shoulder pads over his shoulder , the caption reads " The Living End : Mark Bavaro of the New York Giants " . The cover also featured Bavaro celebrating a touchdown in the trademark manner of his career . Bavaro , a Roman Catholic , would <unk> in the end zone and motion the sign of the cross after each touchdown . 
 Bavaro performed well the during the 1987 season and was again selected to the Pro Bowl . He finished the season with 55 receptions , 867 yards , and 8 touchdowns . He followed that with 53 receptions , 672 yards , and 4 touchdowns in 1988 . After failing to miss a game due to injury in his first four seasons , Bavaro struggled with knee injuries in 1989 and was limited to seven games . He came back to play in 15 games in 1990 . The Giants started the season 10 – 0 and finished 13 – 3 . They advanced to Super Bowl XXV where they played the Buffalo Bills . During the game Bavaro made two key third down receptions to keep scoring drives alive as the Giants won 20 – 19 . 
 Bavaro struggled with a degenerative knee condition throughout the 1990 season and was rarely able to practice . The Giants cut him in July 1991 because of the injury . After some initial dispute , the Giants signed him to a one @-@ year US $ 310 @,@ 000 contract and placed him on the physically unable to perform list . He spent the season as a tight end coach at Saint Dominic Savio High School in East Boston , Massachusetts . He took the position after the team 's coach took a chance and wrote Bavaro a letter to ask him if he would consider coaching . 
 Despite being advised to retire several times by the doctor who worked on his knee , Bavaro managed to secure a contract in 1992 with the Cleveland Browns , who were coached by former Giants assistant coach Bill Belichick . He played one season for the Browns and managed to appear in all 16 games . After the season he signed with the Philadelphia Eagles . He played in all 16 games again and had 43 receptions , 481 yards , and 6 touchdowns in 1993 . After playing one more season for the Eagles he retired in 1995 at the age of 31 . Bavaro finished his nine NFL seasons with 351 receptions for 4 @,@ 733 yards and 39 touchdowns . 
 In 2011 , he was inducted into the New York Giants Ring of Honor .

After his retirement they lived in Naples , Florida for three years . They currently reside in <unk> , Massachusetts , near Bavaro 's hometown of Danvers . After his playing career , Bavaro worked as a sales trader for an equity block @-@ trading firm , where he traded large blocks of stocks for institutions and hedge funds . He pursued a career in this field at the suggestion of his former Giants teammate Phil McConkey , who worked for the same company as Bavaro . In 2007 , Bavaro was appointed Vice President of <unk> , a premiere Chicago exhibit house . Bavaro is also an avid golfer who considers the sport his favorite pastime . 
 Throughout his life Bavaro has displayed a humble , low @-@ key , blue collar personality . During the 1986 season , when he emerged as a Pro Bowler , The New York Times columnist Frank <unk> described him by saying , " [ h ] e is a man of few words , even with teammates . Although he earned $ 90 @,@ 000 plus an $ 85 @,@ 000 signing bonus last year and will make $ 125 @,@ 000 plus incentives this year , he lives a Spartan life . He drives a Chevrolet .

During his NFL career and since his retirement Bavaro has done work as a member of the <unk> organization which promotes abstinence ; Bavaro was vice chairman of the group during his playing career . He has also recently befriended and followed the career of Denver Broncos tight end Daniel Graham who idolized Bavaro as a child .

 = Charles B. Pierce = 
 Charles B. Pierce ( June 16 , 1938 – March 5 , 2010 ) was an American film director , screenwriter , producer , set decorator , cinematographer and actor , and is considered one of the first modern independent filmmakers . Pierce directed thirteen films over the span of 26 years , but is best known for his cult hits The Legend of Boggy Creek ( 1973 ) and The Town That Dreaded Sundown ( 1976 ) . 
 An Arkansas resident most of his life , Pierce made his directorial debut with Boggy Creek , a faux documentary @-@ style film inspired by the legend of the Bigfoot @-@ like Fouke Monster . The low @-@ budget film grossed roughly $ 25 million , and Pierce followed that success with several inexpensive , regional films set in the southern United States , including The Town That Dreaded Sundown , based on the true story of the Phantom Killer murders in Texarkana . 
 Pierce continued directing films into the 1980s , when he wrote the story for the Clint Eastwood film Sudden Impact . For that screenplay , he is said to have written the phrase , " Go ahead , make my day , " which became one of the most famous movie quotes in history . After years of pressure from producers , Pierce directed a Boggy Creek sequel , Boggy Creek II : And the Legend Continues , which he considered the worst film of his career ; it was later <unk> on by the comedy television series Mystery Science Theater 3000 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Charles B. Pierce was born in Hammond , Indiana on June 16 , 1938 , one of three boys born to Mack McKenny Pierce and <unk> Bryant Pierce . His family moved to the southwestern Arkansas city of Hampton when he was just a few months old . There he was a childhood friend and neighbor of future film and television director Harry Thomason , and the two made home movies together in their backyards using an old 8 mm camera . His first professional foray into media entertainment was in the mid @-@ 1960s as an art director at <unk> @-@ TV in Shreveport , Louisiana . He later became a weatherman and hosted a children 's cartoon show for that channel . 
 Pierce continued working in production jobs at television stations in Arkansas , Louisiana and Texas until 1969 , when he moved to Texarkana , bought a 16 mm camera and started an advertising agency . He started a contract with Ledwell & Son Enterprises , a Texarkana @-@ based firm that built 18 @-@ wheel trailers and farm equipment . Pierce developed commercials for the company that played throughout the Southwestern United States , using mostly footage he shot of trucks on the highway and farming equipment being used . He said the reputation he developed with those commercials later helped him launch his film career . Also during this time , Pierce played a character named Mayor Chuckles on The <unk> Club , a local Arkansas children 's television show . Pierce launched his independent film career in the early 1970s , when he sought funding from L.W. Ledwell , the owner of Ledwell & Son Enterprises . Ledwell was skeptical of the idea , but ultimately agreed to provide about $ 100 @,@ 000 of the $ 160 @,@ 000 budget for Pierce 's first film . Prior to his directorial debut , Pierce worked as a set decorator for television shows like the Western series Hondo and for films like Waco ( 1966 ) and <unk> ( 1973 ) . 
 = = The Legend of Boggy Creek = = 
 Pierce 's directorial debut was The Legend of Boggy Creek , which was inspired by the Fouke Monster , a seven @-@ foot @-@ tall Bigfoot @-@ like creature said to live in the swamps near Fouke , Arkansas . Pierce said he did not necessarily believe in the legend , but was fascinated with the stories . After interviewing Fouke residents who said they encountered the monster , Pierce became impressed with their authenticity and down @-@ to @-@ earth qualities . He approached Earl E. Smith , an acquaintance from the advertising business , to adapt those eyewitness tales into a screenplay . The film was shot at locations in Fouke , Texarkana and Shreveport , using a camera Pierce built himself at home . It was filmed in a faux documentary style , and included interviews with Fouke residents mixed with dramatizations of their supposed encounters with the creature . Like Pierce , the film 's financial backers and many of the actors had never been involved in a film before . 
 Pierce cast the actors by approaching customers at a local gas station whenever he saw somebody that looked like they fit one of the parts . He hired high school students as crew members who helped load and move equipment . For the creature itself , he limited the sightings to shadowy figures because he felt the film would be more frightening if the creature was left to the viewer 's imagination . Pierce sang the theme song featured in the film . Once the film was completed , he put the reel into the trunk of his car and drove to Los Angeles seeking post @-@ production services . He met Jamie Mendoza @-@ Nava , who owned a small post @-@ production company and agreed to work on the film for limited up @-@ front pay and a small percentage of the film 's box @-@ office receipts . Pierce could not find a major studio willing to distribute it , so he rented a local movie theater in Texarkana for one week to screen the film . He cleaned the property himself to prepare for the debut . 
 Released in 1972 , The Legend of Boggy Creek premiered at what was later called the Perot Theatre , where lines stretched around the block to see it . Pierce did not expect it to become a financial success , but it made $ 55 @,@ 000 in the first three weeks from that single theater . Eventually , Pierce entered into a distribution deal with Joy N. Houck , owner of the independent distribution company <unk> , who paid Pierce $ 1 @.@ 29 million for a 50 percent interest in the film . Pierce and Houck signed with American International Pictures for foreign and television distribution . It became a hit at drive @-@ in movie theaters , eventually gaining a cult status and bringing Pierce a semblance of fame . The film went on to gross about $ 25 million , making it one of the highest grossing films of the year . At the time of the film 's release , Pierce incorrectly predicted to newspapers that it would win several Academy Awards . Several similarly @-@ styled films about strange and allegedly true phenomena were released in subsequent years due to success of The Legend of Boggy Creek . Julius E. " Smokey " Crabtree , a Fouke resident who appeared as himself in the film , became disgruntled with the production company and filed a lawsuit against Pierce and his financial supporters . Pierce declined to speak to the media about the suit . 
 = = Post @-@ Boggy Creek career = = 
 Following the success of The Legend of Boggy Creek , Pierce was encouraged to film a sequel , but resisted because he wanted to prove himself as a filmmaker rather than duplicate the same idea . He continued to make inexpensive regional films set in the southern United States , primarily targeting small @-@ town and rural audiences . His family said Pierce liked to be continuously working and would start a new film immediately after finishing the last . His sophomore effort was Bootleggers ( 1974 ) , a period action @-@ comedy film about rival families making moonshine in the Ozark Mountains . It featured Slim <unk> and the first major performance of Jaclyn Smith , who went on to play Kelly Garrett in the television series Charlie 's Angels . Pierce followed that film up with two Westerns released in 1976 . The first , Winterhawk , was about violence erupting between Blackfoot Native Americans and white villagers . The film proved difficult for Pierce to shoot due to challenges from the weather and problems with the horses on the set . However , according to Pierce , Winterhawk was more widely seen than The Legend of Boggy Creek . His second Western was Winds of Autumn . Pierce co @-@ wrote both films with his Boggy Creek partner , Earl E. Smith . Pierce made a trademark of casting his friends in his films , and Pierce himself performed minor roles in both Winterhawk and Winds of Autumn . During this period , Pierce continued working as a set decorator for films such as Black Belt Jones ( 1974 ) . 
 Pierce returned to the horror genre with the 1976 film The Town That Dreaded Sundown , based on the true story of the Phantom Killer , an unidentified serial killer who murdered five people in Texarkana in 1946 . Pierce remembered being scared by news stories about the killer during his youth in Hampton . He received some criticism for the graphic violence portrayed in the film , particularly one scene where the killer ties a woman to a tree , attaches a knife to the end of a trombone , then repeatedly stabs her while playing the instrument . Pierce said he purposely made the film violent because he felt the real @-@ life situation was horrific and did not want to glaze over it . While filming horror scenes , he tried to create a suspenseful mood by clearing the set of only the essential cast and staff , then refusing to let them talk to each other as the scenes were shot . Pierce appeared in The Town That Dreaded Sundown as police Patrolman A.C. " Spark Plug " Benson , an idiotic comic relief character . The name " Spark Plug " was a real @-@ life nickname given to the director due to his energy . Pierce described The Town That Dread Sundown as a very easy and enjoyable shoot with no major problems on the set . 
 During this period , Pierce worked as set decorator on films The Outlaw Josey Wales ( 1976 ) and The Cheap Detective ( 1978 ) . The year after The Town That Dreaded Sundown , Piece directed and co @-@ wrote <unk> , a Western based on a Cheyenne legend of a white man whose child ( with an Indian wife ) is kidnapped by a young warrior named <unk> . Pierce appeared in the film as Bugler , a half @-@ insane white man who takes on a Shoshone identity . He then wrote and directed The Norseman ( 1978 ) , which starred Lee Majors as a Viking prince who traveled to America to rescue his father from Indians . Working with a multimillion @-@ dollar budget , Pierce shot the film in the Florida locations Hillsborough River State Park and New Port Richey . The next year he co @-@ wrote and directed The Evictors ( 1979 ) , another documentary @-@ style horror film about a young couple who move into a rural Louisiana farmhouse and find their lives endangered by a series of strange events . Pierce was inspired to write the script after reading a true story in a detective magazine about a Kansas family who murdered somebody trying to evict them from the property . In order to match the late @-@ evening sunlight in his cinematography at the farmhouse set , Pierce set up reflectors outside and deflected the sunlight through the windows , which were fitted with sheer white curtains to give the actors an eerie glow . The Evictors was little @-@ seen and did not do financially well , which was a disappointment to distributor American International Pictures , but Pierce believed it one of his better films . He also considered it his most downbeat film , and said of the unhappy ending , " I probably just didn 't have any other way to end it . " 
 = = Later career = = 
 In the 1980s , to further his career as a filmmaker , Pierce moved to Carmel , California , where he met and befriended actor Clint Eastwood . Pierce shared a film treatment he had developed with Eastwood , who liked the story and helped Pierce develop it into Sudden Impact ( 1983 ) , the fourth entry in Eastwood 's Dirty Harry film series . Pierce was given a writer 's credit for the story along with Joseph C. Stinson . Pierce is said to have written the phrase , " Go ahead , make my day , " the film 's most famous line , which went on to be identified as one of the ten best movie quotes of all @-@ time by the American Film Institute . The phrase was inspired by something his father once told Pierce in his youth while encouraging his son to mow the lawn : " When I come home tonight and the yard has not been mowed , you 're going to make my day . " However , whether Pierce truly invented the phrase has been brought into question , since the same line was used in the action @-@ drama film Vice Squad ( 1982 ) the previous year . Around this time , Pierce also directed Sacred Ground ( 1983 ) , which was released the same year as Sudden Impact . 
 In 1985 , Pierce released a sequel to The Legend of Boggy Creek called Boggy Creek II : And the Legend Continues . American International Pictures had been encouraging him to make a Boggy Creek sequel for years because they believed it would be financially profitable , but he was resistant to the idea . He did not participate in an earlier sequel , Return to Boggy Creek ( 1977 ) , which directed by Tom Moore , and did not like the final film . In his own Boggy Creek II : And the Legend Continues , Pierce starred as an anthropologist who brings three students on an expedition into the bayou to track down the creature . His son , Chuck Pierce , Jr . , co @-@ starred as Tim , one of the students . Pierce ultimately considered Boggy Creek II his worst film , believing his own role was too large and that he cast too many of his friends in supporting roles . Boggy Creek II was featured in a 1999 episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 , a comedy television series in which the characters watch and make jokes about bad films . The episode ultimately increased Pierce 's visibility to a wider audience . 
 Pierce largely fell from the movie industry 's public eye shortly after the release of Boggy Creek II . In 1987 , he directed <unk> 's Breed , a Western film starring Peter Fonda as a drifter who meets and rescues a young Shawnee woman . While shooting that film , Pierce met the woman who became his second wife , Beth Pulley . In 1996 , he directed Renfroe 's White Christmas , an adaptation of the classic children 's book Renfroe 's Christmas . Starting in 1997 , he began production on his western film Chasing the Wind ( 1998 ) , a gritty epic about a mountain man . It proved to be Pierce 's final directorial effort , although he continued working as a set decorator for several television shows including MacGyver , Remington Steele , The Twilight Zone and Fresno , a Carol Burnett miniseries parodying prime time soap operas . Pierce 's work on the latter show earned him a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Art Direction for a Miniseries or a Special . 
 Pierce began writing the screenplay for a sequel to The Town That Dreaded Sundown , but the film never came to fruition . Around 2008 , while developing the horror film The Wild Man of the Navidad , directors Duane Graves and Justin Meeks sought out Pierce , who they cited as a major influence on their work . Graves and Meeks wanted Pierce to work as a consultant on the film , but he turned them down because , according to Graves , " if he 's not running the show , he 's not interested " .

 In 2008 , Pierce was honored at the Little Rock Film Festival , where festival producers screened a retrospective of his films , and presented him with a Lifetime Achievement Award . Also that year , the festival 's best film award was renamed in his honor to the Charles B. Pierce Award for Best Film Made in Arkansas , In October 2009 , the Arkansas Arts Council honored Pierce with the Judges ' Special Recognition Award at the Governor 's Arts Awards ceremony in Hot Springs . Pierce died of natural causes on March 5 , 2010 at the Signature Care nursing home in Dover , Tennessee , where he had moved a few years earlier . He was 71 . Pierce directed thirteen films over the span of 26 years . He was considered one of the first modern independent filmmakers , and was credited with breaking new ground for other independent filmmakers , particularly for the Arkansas film industry . 
 Director Harry Thomason , Pierce 's childhood friend and neighbor , praised him for finding success independently at a time when the film industry was so controlled by major studios . Daniel Myrick , co @-@ director of the documentary @-@ style The Blair Witch Project ( 1999 ) , said he was strongly influenced by The Legend of Boggy Creek , which was one of his favorite films growing up . Myrick said he and fellow Blair Witch director Eduardo Sánchez wanted to " tap into the primal fear generated by the fact @-@ or @-@ fiction format like Legend of Boggy Creek " . In an Orlando Sentinel article that ran on Halloween , Myrick identified The Legend of Boggy Creek as the one film that most inspired him . On September 2 , 2010 , Pierce was inducted into the Arkansas Entertainers Hall of Fame in a ceremony at the Arkansas Governor 's Mansion in Little Rock .

In January 1562 he married Anne , daughter of Sir George Barne , Lord Mayor of London in 1552 – 3 , and widow of wine merchant Alexander Carleill . Anne died two years later leaving her son Christopher Carleill in Walsingham 's care . In 1566 , Walsingham married Ursula St. Barbe , widow of Sir Richard Worsley , and Walsingham acquired her estates of Appuldurcombe and Carisbrooke Priory on the Isle of Wight . The following year , she bore him a daughter , Frances . Walsingham 's other two stepsons , Ursula 's sons John and George , were killed in a gunpowder accident at Appuldurcombe in 1567 . 
 In the following years , Walsingham became active in soliciting support for the Huguenots in France and developed a friendly and close working relationship with Nicholas Throckmorton , his predecessor as MP for Lyme Regis and a former ambassador to France . By 1569 , Walsingham was working with William Cecil to counteract plots against Elizabeth . He was instrumental in the collapse of the Ridolfi plot , which hoped to replace Elizabeth with the Catholic Mary , Queen of Scots . He is credited with writing propaganda decrying a conspiratorial marriage between Mary and Thomas Howard , 4th Duke of Norfolk , and Roberto di Ridolfi , after whom the plot was named , was interrogated at Walsingham 's house . 
 In 1570 , the Queen chose Walsingham to support the Huguenots in their negotiations with Charles IX of France . Later that year , he succeeded Sir Henry Norris as English ambassador in Paris . One of his duties was to continue negotiations for a marriage between Elizabeth and Charles IX 's younger brother Henry , Duke of Anjou . The marriage plan was eventually dropped on the grounds of Henry 's Catholicism . A substitute match with the next youngest brother , Francis , Duke of Alençon , was proposed but Walsingham considered him ugly and " void of a good humour " . Elizabeth was 20 years older than Alençon , and was concerned that the age difference would be seen as absurd . Walsingham believed that it would serve England better to seek a military alliance with France against Spanish interests . The defensive Treaty of Blois was concluded between France and England in 1572 , but the treaty made no provision for a royal marriage and left the question of Elizabeth 's successor open . 
 The Huguenots and other European Protestant interests supported the nascent revolt in the Spanish Netherlands , which were provinces of Habsburg Spain . When Catholic opposition to this course in France resulted in the death of Huguenot leader Gaspard de Coligny and the St. Bartholomew 's Day massacre , Walsingham 's house in Paris became a temporary sanctuary for Protestant refugees , including Philip Sidney . Ursula , who was pregnant , escaped to England with their four @-@ year @-@ old daughter . She gave birth to a second girl , Mary , in January 1573 while Walsingham was still in France . He returned to England in April 1573 , having established himself as a competent official whom the Queen and Cecil could trust . He cultivated contacts throughout Europe , and a century later his dispatches would be published as The Complete Ambassador . 
 In the December following his return , Walsingham was appointed to the Privy Council of England and was made joint principal secretary ( the position which later became " Secretary of State " ) with Sir Thomas Smith . Smith retired in 1576 , leaving Walsingham in effective control of the privy seal , though he was not formally invested as Lord Privy Seal . Walsingham acquired a Surrey county seat in Parliament from 1572 that he retained until his death , but he was not a major parliamentarian . He was knighted on 1 December 1577 , and held the sinecure posts of Recorder of Colchester , custos rotulorum of Hampshire , and High Steward of Salisbury , Ipswich and Winchester . He was appointed Chancellor of the Order of the Garter from 22 April 1578 until succeeded by Sir Amias Paulet in June 1587 , when he became Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in addition to principal secretary . 
 = = Secretary of State = = 
 The duties of the principal secretary were not defined formally , but as he handled all royal correspondence and determined the agenda of council meetings , he could wield great influence in all matters of policy and in every field of government , both foreign and domestic . During his term of office , Walsingham supported the use of England 's maritime power to open new trade routes and explore the New World , and was at the heart of international affairs . He was involved directly with English policy towards Spain , the Netherlands , Scotland , Ireland and France , and embarked on several diplomatic missions to neighbouring European states . 
 Closely linked to the mercantile community , he actively supported trade promotion schemes and invested in the Muscovy Company and the Levant Company . He supported the attempts of John Davis and Martin Frobisher to discover the Northwest Passage and exploit the mineral resources of Labrador , and encouraged Humphrey Gilbert 's exploration of Newfoundland . Gilbert 's voyage was largely financed by recusant Catholics and Walsingham favoured the scheme as a potential means of removing Catholics from England by encouraging emigration to the New World . Walsingham was among the promoters of Francis Drake 's profitable 1578 – 1581 circumnavigation of the world , correctly judging that Spanish possessions in the Pacific were vulnerable to attack . The venture was calculated to promote the Protestant interest by embarrassing and weakening the Spanish , as well as to seize Spanish treasure . The first edition of Richard Hakluyt 's Principal Navigation , Voyages and Discoveries of the English Nation was dedicated to Walsingham . 
 Walsingham advocated direct intervention in the Netherlands in support of the Protestant revolt against Spain , on the grounds that although wars of conquest were unjust , wars in defence of religious liberty and freedom were not . Cecil was more circumspect and advised a policy of mediation , a policy that Elizabeth endorsed . Walsingham was sent on a special embassy to the Netherlands in 1578 , to sound out a potential peace deal and gather military intelligence . 
 Charles IX died in 1574 and Henry , Duke of Anjou , inherited the French throne as Henry III . Between 1578 and 1581 the Queen resurrected attempts to negotiate a marriage with the Duke of Alençon , who had put himself forward as a protector of the Huguenots and a potential leader of the Dutch . Walsingham was sent to France in mid @-@ 1581 to discuss an Anglo @-@ French alliance , but the French wanted the marriage agreed first and Walsingham was under instruction to obtain a treaty before committing to the marriage . He returned to England without an agreement . Personally , Walsingham opposed the marriage , perhaps to the point of encouraging public opposition . Alençon was a Catholic and as his elder brother , Henry III , was childless , he was heir to the French throne . Elizabeth was past the age of childbearing and had no clear successor . If she died while married to the French heir , her realms could fall under French control . By comparing the match of Elizabeth and Alençon with the match of the Protestant Henry of Navarre and the Catholic Margaret of Valois , which occurred in the week before the St. Bartholomew 's Day massacre , the " most horrible spectacle " he had ever witnessed , Walsingham raised the spectre of religious riots in England in the event of the marriage proceeding . Elizabeth put up with his blunt , often unwelcome , advice , and acknowledged his strong beliefs in a letter , in which she called him " her Moor [ who ] cannot change his colour " . 
 These were years of tension in policy towards France , with Walsingham sceptical of the unpredictable Henry III and distrustful of the English ambassador in Paris , Edward Stafford . Stafford , who was compromised by his gambling debts , was in the pay of the Spanish and passed vital information to Spain . Walsingham may have been aware of Stafford 's duplicity , as he fed the ambassador false information , presumably in the hope of fooling or confusing the Spanish . 
 The pro @-@ English Regent of Scotland James Douglas , 4th Earl of Morton , whom Walsingham had supported , was overthrown in 1578 . After the collapse of the Raid of Ruthven , another initiative to secure a pro @-@ English government in Scotland , Walsingham reluctantly visited the Scottish court in August 1583 , knowing that his diplomatic mission was unlikely to succeed . James VI dismissed Walsingham 's advice on domestic policy saying he was an " absolute King " in Scotland . Walsingham replied with a discourse on the topic that " young princes were many times carried into great errors upon an opinion of the absoluteness of their royal authority and do not consider , that when they transgress the bounds and limits of the law , they leave to be kings and become tyrants . " A mutual defence pact was eventually agreed in the Treaty of Berwick of 1586 . 
 Walsingham 's cousin Edward Denny fought in Ireland during the rebellion of the Earl of Desmond and was one of the English settlers granted land in Munster confiscated from Desmond . Walsingham 's stepson Christopher Carleill commanded the garrisons at Coleraine and Carrickfergus . Walsingham thought Irish farmland was underdeveloped and hoped that plantation would improve the productivity of estates . Tensions between the native Irish and the English settlers had lasting effects on the history of Ireland . 
 Walsingham 's younger daughter Mary died aged seven in July 1580 ; his elder daughter , Frances , married Sir Philip Sidney on 21 September 1583 , despite the Queen 's initial objections to the match ( for unknown reasons ) earlier in the year . As part of the marriage agreement , Walsingham agreed to pay £ 1 @,@ 500 of Sidney 's debts and gave his daughter and son @-@ in @-@ law the use of his manor at Barn Elms in Surrey . A granddaughter born in November 1585 was named Elizabeth after the Queen , who was one of two godparents along with Sidney 's uncle , Robert Dudley , 1st Earl of Leicester . The following year , Sidney was killed fighting the Spanish in the Netherlands and Walsingham was faced with paying off more of Sidney 's extensive debts . His widowed daughter gave birth , in a difficult delivery , to a second child shortly afterward , but the baby , a girl , was stillborn . 
 = = Espionage = = 
 Walsingham was driven by Protestant zeal to counter Catholicism , and sanctioned the use of torture against Catholic priests and suspected conspirators . Edmund Campion was among those tortured and found guilty on the basis of extracted evidence ; he was hanged , drawn and quartered at Tyburn in 1581 . Walsingham could never forget the atrocities against Protestants he had witnessed in France during the Bartholomew 's Day massacre and believed a similar slaughter would occur in England in the event of a Catholic resurgence . Walsingham 's brother @-@ in @-@ law Robert Beale , who was in Paris with Walsingham at the time of the massacre , encapsulated Walsingham 's view : " I think it time and more than time for us to awake out of our dead sleep , and take heed lest like mischief as has already overwhelmed the brethren and neighbours in France and Flanders embrace us which be left in such sort as we shall not be able to escape . " Walsingham tracked down Catholic priests in England and supposed conspirators by employing informers , and intercepting correspondence . Walsingham 's staff in England included the cryptographer Thomas <unk> , who was an expert in deciphering letters and forgery , and Arthur Gregory , who was skilled at breaking and repairing seals without detection . 
 In May 1582 , letters from the Spanish ambassador in England , Bernardino de Mendoza , to contacts in Scotland were found on a messenger by Sir John Forster , who forwarded them to Walsingham . The letters indicated a conspiracy among the Catholic powers to invade England and displace Elizabeth with Mary , Queen of Scots . By April 1583 , Walsingham had a spy , identified as Giordano Bruno by author John Bossy , deployed in the French embassy in London . Walsingham 's contact reported that Francis Throckmorton , a nephew of Walsingham 's old friend Nicholas Throckmorton , had visited the ambassador , Michel de Castelnau . In November 1583 , after six months of surveillance , Walsingham had Throckmorton arrested and then tortured to secure a confession — an admission of guilt that clearly implicated Mendoza . The Throckmorton plot called for an invasion of England along with a domestic uprising to liberate Mary , Queen of Scots , and depose Elizabeth . Throckmorton was executed in 1584 and Mendoza was expelled from England . 
 = = = Entrapment of Mary , Queen of Scots = = = 
 After the assassination in mid @-@ 1584 of William the Silent , the leader of the Dutch revolt against Spain , English military intervention in the Low Countries was agreed in the Treaties of Nonsuch of 1585 . The murder of William the Silent also reinforced fears for Queen Elizabeth 's safety . Walsingham helped create the Bond of Association , the signatories of which promised to hunt down and kill anyone who conspired against Elizabeth . The Act for the Surety of the Queen 's Person , passed by Parliament in March 1585 , set up a legal process for trying any claimant to the throne implicated in plots against the Queen . The following month Mary , Queen of Scots , was placed in the strict custody of Sir Amias Paulet , a friend of Walsingham . At Christmas , she was moved to a moated manor house at Chartley . Walsingham instructed Paulet to open , read and pass to Mary unsealed any letters that she received , and to block any potential route for clandestine correspondence . In a successful attempt to entrap her , Walsingham arranged a single exception : a covert means for Mary 's letters to be smuggled in and out of Chartley in a beer keg . Mary was misled into thinking these secret letters were secure , while in reality they were deciphered and read by Walsingham 's agents . In July 1586 , Anthony Babington wrote to Mary about an impending plot to free her and kill Elizabeth . Mary 's reply was clearly encouraging and sanctioned Babington 's plans . Walsingham had Babington and his associates rounded up ; fourteen were executed in September 1586 . In October , Mary was put on trial under the Act for the Surety of the Queen 's Person in front of 36 commissioners , including Walsingham . 
 During the presentation of evidence against her , Mary broke down and pointed accusingly at Walsingham saying , " all of this is the work of Monsieur de Walsingham for my destruction " , to which he replied , " God is my witness that as a private person I have done nothing unworthy of an honest man , and as Secretary of State , nothing <unk> my duty . " Mary was found guilty and the warrant for her execution was drafted , but Elizabeth hesitated to sign it , despite pressure from Walsingham . Walsingham wrote to Paulet urging him to find " some way to shorten the life " of Mary to relieve Elizabeth of the burden , to which Paulet replied indignantly , " God forbid that I should make so foul a shipwreck of my conscience , or leave so great a blot to my poor posterity , to shed blood without law or warrant . " Walsingham made arrangements for Mary 's execution ; Elizabeth signed the warrant on 1 February 1587 and entrusted it to William Davison , who had been appointed as junior Secretary of State in late September 1586 . Davison passed the warrant to Cecil and a privy council convened by Cecil without Elizabeth 's knowledge agreed to carry out the sentence as soon as was practical . Within a week , Mary was beheaded . On hearing of the execution , Elizabeth claimed not to have sanctioned the action and that she had not meant Davison to part with the warrant . Davison was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London . Walsingham 's share of Elizabeth 's displeasure was small because he was absent from court , at home ill , in the weeks just before and after the execution . Davison was eventually released in October 1588 , on the orders of Cecil and Walsingham . 
 = = = Spanish Armada = = = 
 From 1586 , Walsingham received many dispatches from his agents in mercantile communities and foreign courts detailing Spanish preparations for an invasion of England . Walsingham 's recruitment of Anthony Standen , a friend of the Tuscan ambassador to Madrid , was an exceptional intelligence triumph and Standen 's dispatches were deeply revealing . Walsingham worked to prepare England for a potential war with Spain , in particular by supervising the substantial rebuilding of Dover Harbour , and encouraging a more aggressive strategy . On Walsingham 's instructions , the English ambassador in Turkey , William Harborne , attempted unsuccessfully to persuade the Ottoman Sultan to attack Spanish possessions in the Mediterranean in the hope of distracting Spanish forces . Walsingham supported Francis Drake 's raid of Cadiz in 1587 , which wrought havoc with Spanish logistics . The Spanish Armada sailed for England in July 1588 . Walsingham received regular dispatches from the English naval forces , and raised his own troop of 260 men as part of the land defences . On 18 August 1588 , after the dispersal of the armada , naval commander Lord Henry Seymour wrote to Walsingham , " you have fought more with your pen than many have in our English navy fought with their enemies " . 
 In foreign intelligence , Walsingham 's extensive network of " <unk> " , who passed on general news as well as secrets , spanned Europe and the Mediterranean . While foreign intelligence was a normal part of the principal secretary 's activities , Walsingham brought to it flair and ambition , and large sums of his own money . He cast his net more widely than others had done previously : expanding and exploiting links across the continent as well as in Constantinople and Algiers , and building and inserting contacts among Catholic exiles . Among his spies may have been the playwright Christopher Marlowe ; Marlowe was in France in the mid @-@ 1580s and was acquainted with Walsingham 's kinsman Thomas Walsingham . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 From 1571 onwards , Walsingham complained of ill health and often retired to his country estate for periods of recuperation . He complained of " sundry <unk> " , pains in his head , stomach and back , and difficulty in passing water . Suggested diagnoses include cancer , kidney stones , urinary infection , and diabetes . He died on 6 April 1590 , at his house in Seething Lane . Historian William Camden wrote that Walsingham died from " a <unk> growing intra testium <unk> [ testicular cancer ] " . He was buried privately in a simple ceremony at 10 pm on the following day , beside his son @-@ in @-@ law , in Old St Paul 's Cathedral . The grave and monument were destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666 . His name appears on a modern monument in the crypt listing the important graves lost . 
 In his will , dated 12 December 1589 , Walsingham complained of " the greatness of my debts and the mean state [ I ] shall leave my wife and heirs in " , but the true state of his finances is unclear . He received grants of land from the Queen , grants for the export of cloth and leases of customs in the northern and western ports . His primary residences , apart from the court , were in Seething Lane by the Tower of London ( now the site of a Victorian office building called Walsingham House ) , at Barn Elms in Surrey and at Odiham in Hampshire . Nothing remains of any of his houses . He spent much of his own money on espionage in the service of the Queen and the Protestant cause . In 1586 , he funded a lectureship in theology at Oxford University for the Puritan John <unk> . He had underwritten the debts of his son @-@ in @-@ law , Sir Philip Sidney , had pursued the Sidney estate for recompense unsuccessfully and had carried out major land transactions in his later years . After his death , his friends reflected that poor bookkeeping had left him further in the Crown 's debt than was fair . In 1611 , the Crown 's debts to him were calculated at over £ 48 @,@ 000 , but his debts to the Crown were calculated at over £ 43 @,@ 000 and a judge , Sir Julius Caesar , ordered both sets of debts cancelled quid pro quo . Walsingham 's surviving daughter Frances received a £ 300 annuity , and married the Earl of Essex . Ursula , Lady Walsingham , continued to live at Barn Elms with a staff of servants until her death in 1602 . 
 Protestants lauded Walsingham as " a sound pillar of our commonwealth and chief patron of virtue , learning and chivalry " . He was part of a Protestant intelligentsia that included Philip Sidney , Edmund Spenser and John Dee : men who promoted an expansionist and nationalist English Renaissance . Spenser included a dedicatory sonnet to Walsingham in the Faerie Queene , likening him to Maecenas who introduced Virgil to the Emperor Augustus . After Walsingham 's death , Sir John Davies composed an acrostic poem in his memory and Watson wrote an elegy , <unk> , in Latin . On the other hand , Jesuit Robert Persons thought Walsingham " cruel and inhumane " in his persecution of Catholics . Catholic sources portray a ruthless , devious man driven by religious intolerance and an excessive love for intrigue . Walsingham attracts controversy still . Although he was ruthless , his opponents on the Catholic side were no less so ; the treatment of prisoners and suspects by Tudor authorities was typical of European governments of the time . Walsingham 's personal , as opposed to his public , character is elusive ; his public papers were seized by the government while many of his private papers , which might have revealed much , were lost . The fragments that do survive demonstrate his personal interest in gardening and falconry . 
 = = = In fiction = = = 
 Fictional portrayals of Walsingham tend to follow Catholic interpretations , depicting him as sinister and Machiavellian . He features in conspiracy theories surrounding the death of Christopher Marlowe , whom he predeceased . Charles Nicholl examined ( and rejected ) such theories in The Reckoning : The Murder of Christopher Marlowe ( 1992 ) , which was used as a source by Anthony Burgess for his novel A Dead Man in Deptford ( 1993 ) . 
 The 1998 film Elizabeth gives considerable , although sometimes historically inaccurate , prominence to Walsingham ( portrayed by Geoffrey Rush ) . It fictionalizes him as irreligious and sexually ambiguous , merges chronologically distant events , and inaccurately suggests that he murdered Mary of Guise . Rush reprised the role in the 2007 sequel , Elizabeth : The Golden Age . Both Stephen Murray in the 1970 BBC series Elizabeth R and Patrick Malahide in the 2005 Channel Four miniseries Elizabeth I play him as a dour official . 
 = Chinua Achebe = 
 Chinua Achebe ( / <unk> <unk> / , born Albert Chinualumogu Achebe ; 16 November 1930 – 21 March 2013 ) was a Nigerian novelist , poet , professor , and critic . His first novel Things Fall Apart ( 1958 ) was considered his magnum opus , and is the most widely read book in modern African literature . 
 Raised by his parents in the Igbo town of Ogidi in South @-@ Eastern Nigeria , Achebe excelled at school and won a scholarship for undergraduate studies at University College ( now the University of Ibadan ) . He became fascinated with world religions and traditional African cultures , and began writing stories as a university student . After graduation , he worked for the Nigerian Broadcasting Service ( NBS ) and soon moved to the metropolis of Lagos . He gained worldwide attention for Things Fall Apart in the late 1950s ; his later novels include No Longer at Ease ( 1960 ) , Arrow of God ( 1964 ) , A Man of the People ( 1966 ) , and Anthills of the Savannah ( 1987 ) . Achebe wrote his novels in English and defended the use of English , a " language of colonisers " , in African literature . In 1975 , his lecture An Image of Africa : Racism in Conrad 's " Heart of Darkness " featured a famous criticism of Joseph Conrad as " a thoroughgoing racist " ; it was later published in The Massachusetts Review amid some controversy . 
 When the region of Biafra broke away from Nigeria in 1967 , Achebe became a supporter of Biafran independence and acted as ambassador for the people of the new nation . The war ravaged the populace , and as starvation and violence took its toll , he appealed to the people of Europe and the Americas for aid . When the Nigerian government retook the region in 1970 , he involved himself in political parties but soon resigned due to frustration over the corruption and elitism he witnessed . He lived in the United States for several years in the 1970s , and returned to the U.S. in 1990 after a car accident left him partially disabled . 
 A titled Igbo chieftain himself , Achebe 's novels focus on the traditions of Igbo society , the effect of Christian influences , and the clash of Western and traditional African values during and after the colonial era . His style relies heavily on the Igbo oral tradition , and combines straightforward narration with representations of folk stories , proverbs , and oratory . He also published a number of short stories , children 's books , and essay collections . 
 Upon his return to the United States in 1990 , he began an eighteen @-@ year tenure at Bard College as the Charles P. Stevenson Professor of Languages and Literature . From 2009 until his death , he served as David and Marianna Fisher University Professor and Professor of Africana Studies at Brown University . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Achebe 's parents , Isaiah <unk> Achebe and Janet <unk> <unk> , were converts to the Protestant Church Mission Society ( CMS ) in Nigeria . The elder Achebe stopped practising the religion of his ancestors , but he respected its traditions . Achebe 's <unk> name , Chinualumogu ( " May God fight on my behalf " ) , was a prayer for divine protection and stability . The Achebe family had five other surviving children , named in a similar fusion of traditional words relating to their new religion : Frank <unk> , John Chukwuemeka <unk> , <unk> Uzoma , Augustine <unk> , and Grace <unk> . 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Achebe was born Albert Chinualumogu Achebe in the Igbo village of Ogidi on 16 November 1930 . Isaiah <unk> Achebe and Janet <unk> <unk> Achebe stood at a crossroads of traditional culture and Christian influence ; this made a significant impact on the children , especially Chinualumogu . After the youngest daughter was born , the family moved to Isaiah Achebe 's ancestral town of Ogidi , in what is now the state of Anambra . 
 Storytelling was a mainstay of the Igbo tradition and an integral part of the community . Achebe 's mother and sister <unk> Uzoma told him many stories as a child , which he repeatedly requested . His education was furthered by the collages his father hung on the walls of their home , as well as almanacs and numerous books – including a prose adaptation of A Midsummer Night 's Dream ( c . 1590 ) and an Igbo version of The Pilgrim 's Progress ( 1678 ) . Chinua also eagerly anticipated traditional village events , like the frequent masquerade ceremonies , which he recreated later in his novels and stories . 
 = = = = Education = = = = 
 In 1936 , Achebe entered St Philips ' Central School . Despite his protests , he spent a week in the religious class for young children , but was quickly moved to a higher class when the school 's chaplain took note of his intelligence . One teacher described him as the student with the best handwriting in class , and the best reading skills . He also attended Sunday school every week and the special evangelical services held monthly , often carrying his father 's bag . A controversy erupted at one such session , when apostates from the new church challenged the catechist about the tenets of Christianity . Achebe later included a scene from this incident in Things Fall Apart . 
 At the age of 12 , Achebe moved away from his family to the village of <unk> , four kilometres from Owerri . He enrolled as a student at the Central School , where his older brother John taught . In <unk> , Achebe gained an appreciation for Mbari , a traditional art form that seeks to invoke the gods ' protection through symbolic sacrifices in the form of sculpture and collage . ( He would later suggest the name for the Mbari Writers and Artists Club that was founded in Ibadan by <unk> Beier and others in 1961 . ) the time came to change to secondary school , in 1944 , Achebe sat entrance examinations for and was accepted at both the prestigious Dennis Memorial Grammar School in Onitsha and the even more prestigious Government College in Umuahia . 
 Modelled on the British public school , and funded by the colonial administration , Government College had been established in 1929 to educate Nigeria 's future elite . It had rigorous academic standards and was vigorously elitist , accepting boys purely on the basis of ability . The language of the school was English , not only to develop proficiency but also to provide a common tongue for pupils from different Nigerian language groups . Achebe described this later as being ordered to " put away their different mother tongues and communicate in the language of their colonisers " . The rule was strictly enforced and Achebe recalls that his first punishment was for asking another boy to pass the soap in Igbo . 
 Once there , Achebe was double @-@ promoted in his first year , completing the first two years ' studies in one , and spending only four years in secondary school , instead of the standard five . Achebe was unsuited to the school 's sports regimen and belonged instead to a group of six exceedingly studious pupils . So intense were their study habits that the headmaster banned the reading of textbooks from five to six o 'clock in the afternoon ( though other activities and other books were allowed ) . 
 Achebe started to explore the school 's " wonderful library " . There he discovered Booker T. Washington 's Up From Slavery ( 1901 ) , the autobiography of an American former slave ; Achebe " found it sad , but it showed him another dimension of reality " . He also read classic novels , such as Gulliver 's Travels ( 1726 ) , David Copperfield ( 1850 ) , and Treasure Island ( 1883 ) , together with tales of colonial derring @-@ do such as H. Rider Haggard 's Allan Quatermain ( 1887 ) and John Buchan 's Prester John ( 1910 ) . Achebe later recalled that , as a reader , he " took sides with the white characters against the savages " and even developed a dislike for Africans . " The white man was good and reasonable and intelligent and courageous . The savages arrayed against him were sinister and stupid or , at the most , cunning . I hated their guts . " 
 = = = = University = = = = 
 In 1948 , in preparation for independence , Nigeria 's first university opened . Known as University College ( now the University of Ibadan ) , it was an associate college of the University of London . Achebe obtained such high marks in the entrance examination that he was admitted as a Major Scholar in the university 's first intake and given a bursary to study medicine . It was during his studies at Ibadan that Achebe began to become critical of European literature about Africa . After reading Joyce Cary 's 1939 work Mister Johnson about a cheerful Nigerian man who ( among other things ) works for an abusive British <unk> , he was so disturbed by the book 's portrayal of its Nigerian characters as either savages or buffoons that he decided to become a writer . Achebe recognised his dislike for the African protagonist as a sign of the author 's cultural ignorance . One of his classmates announced to the professor that the only enjoyable moment in the book is when Johnson is shot . 
 He abandoned the study of medicine and changed to English , history , and theology . Because he switched his field , however , he lost his scholarship and had to pay tuition fees . He received a government bursary , and his family also donated money – his older brother Augustine gave up money for a trip home from his job as a civil servant so Chinua could continue his studies . From its inception , the university had a strong Arts faculty ; it includes many famous writers amongst its alumni . These include Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka , poet and playwright John Pepper Clark , and poet Christopher Okigbo . <unk> <unk> is also another famous writer who studied at the university in the 1950s , although he was in the faculty of sciences . 
 In 1950 Achebe wrote a piece for the University Herald entitled " Polar Undergraduate " , his debut as an author . It used irony and humour to celebrate the intellectual vigour of his classmates . He followed this with other essays and letters about philosophy and freedom in academia , some of which were published in another campus magazine , The Bug . He served as the Herald 's editor during the 1951 – 52 school year . 
 While at the university , Achebe wrote his first short story , " In a Village Church " , which combines details of life in rural Nigeria with Christian institutions and icons , a style which appears in many of his later works . Other short stories he wrote during his time at Ibadan ( including " The Old Order in Conflict with the New " and " Dead Men 's Path " ) examine conflicts between tradition and modernity , with an eye toward dialogue and understanding on both sides . When a professor named Geoffrey Parrinder arrived at the university to teach comparative religion , Achebe began to explore the fields of Christian history and African traditional religions . 
 After the final examinations at Ibadan in 1953 , Achebe was awarded a second @-@ class degree . <unk> by not receiving the highest level , he was uncertain how to proceed after graduation . He returned to his hometown of Ogidi to sort through his options . 
 = = = Teaching and producing = = = 
 While he meditated on his possible career paths , Achebe was visited by a friend from the university , who convinced him to apply for an English teaching position at the Merchants of Light school at Oba . It was a ramshackle institution with a crumbling infrastructure and a meagre library ; the school was built on what the residents called " bad bush " – a section of land thought to be tainted by unfriendly spirits . Later , in Things Fall Apart , Achebe describes a similar area called the " evil forest " , where the Christian missionaries are given a place to build their church . 
 As a teacher he urged his students to read extensively and be original in their work . The students did not have access to the newspapers he had read as a student , so Achebe made his own available in the classroom . He taught in Oba for four months , but when an opportunity arose in 1954 to work for the Nigerian Broadcasting Service ( NBS ) , he left the school and moved to Lagos . 
 The NBS , a radio network started in 1933 by the colonial government , assigned Achebe to the Talks Department , preparing scripts for oral delivery . This helped him master the subtle nuances between written and spoken language , a skill that helped him later to write realistic dialogue . 
 The city of Lagos also made a significant impression on him . A huge conurbation , the city teemed with recent migrants from the rural villages . Achebe revelled in the social and political activity around him and later drew upon his experiences when describing the city in his 1960 novel No Longer at Ease . 
 While in Lagos , Achebe started work on a novel . This was challenging , since very little African fiction had been written in English , although Amos Tutuola 's Palm @-@ Wine <unk> ( 1952 ) and Cyprian Ekwensi 's People of the City ( 1954 ) were notable exceptions . While appreciating Ekwensi 's work , Achebe worked hard to develop his own style , even as he pioneered the creation of the Nigerian novel itself . A visit to Nigeria by Queen Elizabeth II in 1956 brought issues of colonialism and politics to the surface , and was a significant moment for Achebe . 
 Also in 1956 he was selected at the Staff School run by the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) . His first trip outside Nigeria was an opportunity to advance his technical production skills , and to solicit feedback on his novel ( which was later split into two books ) . In London , he met a novelist named Gilbert Phelps , to whom he offered the manuscript . Phelps responded with great enthusiasm , asking Achebe if he could show it to his editor and publishers . Achebe declined , insisting that it needed more work . 
 = = = Things Fall Apart = = = 
 Back in Nigeria , Achebe set to work revising and editing his novel ( now titled Things Fall Apart , after a line in the poem " The Second Coming " by W. B. Yeats ) . He cut away the second and third sections of the book , leaving only the story of a yam farmer named Okonkwo who lives during the colonization of Nigeria . He added sections , improved various chapters , and restructured the prose . By 1957 , he had sculpted it to his liking , and took advantage of an advertisement offering a typing service . He sent his only copy of his handwritten manuscript ( along with the ₤ 22 fee ) to the London company . After he waited several months without receiving any communication from the typing service , Achebe began to worry . His boss at the NBS , Angela Beattie , was going to London for her annual leave ; he asked her to visit the company . She did , and angrily demanded to know why the manuscript was lying ignored in the corner of the office . The company quickly sent a typed copy to Achebe . Beattie 's intervention was crucial for his ability to continue as a writer . Had the novel been lost , he later said , " I would have been so discouraged that I would probably have given up altogether . " 
 In 1958 , Achebe sent his novel to the agent recommended by Gilbert Phelps in London . It was sent to several publishing houses ; some rejected it immediately , claiming that fiction from African writers had no market potential . Finally it reached the office of Heinemann , where executives hesitated until an educational adviser , Donald MacRae – just back in England after a trip through West Africa read the book and forced the company 's hand with his succinct report : " This is the best novel I have read since the war " . 
 Heinemann published 2 @,@ 000 hardcover copies of Things Fall Apart on 17 June 1958 . According to Alan Hill , employed by the publisher at the time , the company did not " touch a word of it " in preparation for release . The book was received well by the British press , and received positive reviews from critic Walter Allen and novelist Angus Wilson . Three days after publication , The Times Literary Supplement wrote that the book " genuinely succeeds in presenting tribal life from the inside " . The Observer called it " an excellent novel " , and the literary magazine Time and Tide said that " Mr. Achebe 's style is a model for aspirants " . 
 Initial reception in Nigeria was mixed . When Hill tried to promote the book in West Africa , he was met with scepticism and ridicule . The faculty at the University of Ibadan was amused at the thought of a worthwhile novel being written by an alumnus . Others were more supportive ; one review in the magazine Black Orpheus said : " The book as a whole creates for the reader such a vivid picture of Ibo life that the plot and characters are little more than symbols representing a way of life lost irrevocably within living memory . " 
 In the book Okonkwo struggles with the legacy of his father – a shiftless debtor fond of playing the flute – as well as the complications and contradictions that arise when white missionaries arrive in his village of Umuofia . Exploring the terrain of cultural conflict , particularly the encounter between Igbo tradition and Christian doctrine , Achebe returns to the themes of his earlier stories , which grew from his own background . 
 Things Fall Apart went on to become one of the most important books in African literature . Selling over eight million copies around the world , it was translated into 50 languages , making Achebe the most translated African writer of all time . 
 The book , in recognition of its universality , appears in the <unk> World Library collection " proposed by one hundred writers from fifty @-@ four different countries , compiled and organized in 2002 by the Norwegian Book Club . This list endeavors to reflect world literature , with books from all countries , cultures , and time periods . " 
 Nigerian Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka has described the work as " the first novel in English which spoke from the interior of the African character , rather than portraying the African as an exotic , as the white man would see him . " 
 = = = Marriage and family = = = 
 In the same year Things Fall Apart was published , Achebe was promoted at the NBS and put in charge of the network 's eastern region coverage . He moved to Enugu and began to work on his administrative duties . There he met a woman named Christiana <unk> ( Christie ) Okoli , who had grown up in the area and joined the NBS staff when he arrived . They first conversed when she brought to his attention a pay discrepancy ; a friend of hers found that , although they had been hired simultaneously , Christie had been rated lower and offered a lower wage . Sent to the hospital for an appendectomy soon after , she was pleasantly surprised when Achebe visited her with gifts and magazines . 
 Achebe and Okoli grew closer in the following years , and on 10 September 1961 they were married in the Chapel of Resurrection on the campus of the University of Ibadan . Christie Achebe has described their marriage as one of trust and mutual understanding ; some tension arose early in their union , due to conflicts about attention and communication . However , as their relationship matured , husband and wife made efforts to adapt to one another . 
 Their first child , a daughter named <unk> , was born on 11 July 1962 . They had a son , Ikechukwu , on 3 December 1964 , and another boy named <unk> , on 24 May 1967 . When the children began attending school in Lagos , their parents became worried about the world view – especially with regard to race – expressed at the school , especially through the mostly white teachers and books that presented a prejudiced view of African life . In 1966 , Achebe published his first children 's book , Chike and the River , to address some of these concerns . After the Biafran War , the <unk> had another daughter on 7 March 1970 , named <unk> . When asked about his family Achebe stated : " There are few things more important than my family . " They have six grandchildren : <unk> , Chino , <unk> , C.J. ( Chinua Jr . ) , Nnamdi and Zeal . 
 = = = No Longer at Ease and fellowship travels = = = 
 In 1960 , while they were still dating , Achebe dedicated to Christie Okoli his second novel , No Longer at Ease , about a civil servant who is embroiled in the corruption of Lagos . The protagonist is Obi , grandson of Things Fall Apart 's main character , Okonkwo . Drawing on his time in the city , Achebe writes about Obi 's experiences in Lagos to reflect the challenges facing a new generation on the threshold of Nigerian independence . Obi is trapped between the expectations of his family , its clan , his home village , and larger society . He is crushed by these forces ( like his grandfather before him ) and finds himself imprisoned for bribery . Having shown his acumen for portraying traditional Igbo culture , Achebe demonstrated in his second novel an ability to depict modern Nigerian life . 
 Later that year , Achebe was awarded a Rockefeller Fellowship for six months of travel , which he called " the first important perk of my writing career " ; Achebe set out for a tour of East Africa . One month after Nigeria achieved its independence , he travelled to Kenya , where he was required to complete an immigration form by checking a box indicating his ethnicity : European , Asiatic , Arab , or Other . Shocked and dismayed at being forced into an " Other " identity , he found the situation " almost funny " and took an extra form as a souvenir . Continuing to Tanganyika and Zanzibar ( now united in Tanzania ) , he was frustrated by the paternalistic attitude he observed among non @-@ African hotel clerks and social elites . 
 Achebe also found in his travels that Swahili was gaining prominence as a major African language . Radio programs were broadcast in Swahili , and its use was widespread in the countries he visited . Nevertheless , he also found an " apathy " among the people toward literature written in Swahili . He met the poet Sheikh Shaaban Robert , who complained of the difficulty he had faced in trying to publish his Swahili @-@ language work . 
 In Northern Rhodesia ( now called Zambia ) , Achebe found himself sitting in a whites @-@ only section of a bus to Victoria Falls . <unk> by the ticket taker as to why he was sitting in the front , he replied , " if you must know I come from Nigeria , and there we sit where we like in the bus . " Upon reaching the waterfall , he was cheered by the black travellers from the bus , but he was saddened by their being unable to resist the policy of segregation at the time . 
 Two years later , Achebe again left Nigeria , this time as part of a Fellowship for Creative Artists awarded by UNESCO . He travelled to the United States and Brazil . He met with a number of writers from the US , including novelists Ralph Ellison and Arthur Miller . In Brazil , he met with several other authors , with whom he discussed the complications of writing in Portuguese . Achebe worried that the vibrant literature of the nation would be lost if left untranslated into a more widely spoken language . 
 = = = Voice of Nigeria and African Writers Series = = = 
 Once he returned to Nigeria , Achebe was promoted at the NBS to the position of Director of External Broadcasting . One of his first duties was to help create the Voice of Nigeria network . The station broadcast its first transmission on New Year 's Day 1962 , and worked to maintain an objective perspective during the turbulent era immediately following independence . This objectivity was put to the test when Nigerian Prime Minister Abubakar <unk> Balewa declared a state of emergency in the Western Region , responding to a series of conflicts between officials of varying parties . Achebe became saddened by the evidence of corruption and silencing of political opposition . 
 In 1962 he attended an executive conference of African writers in English at the Makerere University College in Kampala , Uganda . He met with important literary figures from around the continent and the world , including Ghanaian poet Kofi <unk> , Nigerian playwright and poet Wole Soyinka , and US poet @-@ author Langston Hughes . Among the topics of discussion was an attempt to determine whether the term African literature ought to include work from the diaspora , or solely that writing composed by people living within the continent itself . Achebe indicated that it was not " a very significant question " , and that scholars would do well to wait until a body of work were large enough to judge . Writing about the conference in several journals , Achebe hailed it as a milestone for the literature of Africa , and highlighted the importance of community among isolated voices on the continent and beyond . 
 While at Makerere , Achebe was asked to read a novel written by a student ( James <unk> , later known as Ngũgĩ wa Thiong 'o ) called Weep Not , Child . Impressed , he sent it to Alan Hill at Heinemann , which published it two years later to coincide with its paperback line of books from African writers . Hill indicated this was to remedy a situation where British publishers " regarded West Africa only as a place where you sold books . " Achebe was chosen to be General Editor of the African Writers Series , which became a significant force in bringing postcolonial literature from Africa to the rest of the world , and he continued in that role until 1972 . 
 As these works became more widely available , reviews and essays about African literature – especially from Europe – began to flourish . <unk> against the commentary flooding his home country , Achebe published an essay entitled " Where Angels Fear to Tread " in the December 1962 issue of Nigeria Magazine . In it , he distinguished between the hostile critic ( entirely negative ) , the amazed critic ( entirely positive ) , and the conscious critic ( who seeks a balance ) . He lashed out at those who critiqued African writers from the outside , saying : " no man can understand another whose language he does not speak ( and ' language ' here does not mean simply words , but a man 's entire world view ) . " In September 1964 he attended the Commonwealth Literature conference at the University of Leeds , presenting his essay " The Novelist as Teacher " . 
 = = = Arrow of God = = = 
 Achebe 's third book , Arrow of God , was published in 1964 . Like its predecessors , it explores the intersections of Igbo tradition and European Christianity . Set in the village of <unk> at the start of the twentieth century , the novel tells the story of Ezeulu , a Chief Priest of Ulu . Shocked by the power of British intervention in the area , he orders his son to learn the foreigners ' secret . As with Okonkwo in Things Fall Apart and Obi in No Longer at Ease , Ezeulu is consumed by the resulting tragedy . 
 The idea for the novel came in 1959 , when Achebe heard the story of a Chief Priest being imprisoned by a District Officer . He drew further inspiration a year later when he viewed a collection of Igbo objects excavated from the area by archaeologist Thurstan Shaw ; Achebe was startled by the cultural sophistication of the artifacts . When an acquaintance showed him a series of papers from colonial officers ( not unlike the fictional Pacification of the Primitive Tribes of the Lower Niger referenced at the end of Things Fall Apart ) , Achebe combined these strands of history and began work on Arrow of God in earnest . Like Achebe 's previous works , Arrow was roundly praised by critics . A revised edition was published in 1974 to correct what Achebe called " certain structural weaknesses " . 
 In a letter written to Achebe , the US writer John Updike expressed his surprised admiration for the sudden downfall of Arrow of God 's protagonist . He praised the author 's courage to write " an ending few Western novelists would have contrived " . Achebe responded by suggesting that the individualistic hero was rare in African literature , given its roots in communal living and the degree to which characters are " subject to non @-@ human forces in the universe " . 
 = = = A Man of the People = = = 
 A Man of the People was published in 1966 . A bleak satire set in an unnamed African state which has just attained independence , the novel follows a teacher named <unk> <unk> from the village of Anata who opposes a corrupt Minister of Culture named Nanga for his Parliament seat . Upon reading an advance copy of the novel , Achebe 's friend John Pepper Clark declared : " Chinua , I know you are a prophet . Everything in this book has happened except a military coup ! " 
 Soon afterward , Nigerian Major <unk> Kaduna <unk> seized control of the northern region of the country as part of a larger coup attempt . Commanders in other areas failed , and the plot was answered by a military crackdown . A massacre of three thousand people from the eastern region living in the north occurred soon afterwards , and stories of other attacks on Igbo Nigerians began to filter into Lagos . 
 The ending of his novel had brought Achebe to the attention of military personnel , who suspected him of having foreknowledge of the coup . When he received word of the pursuit , he sent his wife ( who was pregnant ) and children on a squalid boat through a series of unseen creeks to the Igbo stronghold of Port Harcourt . They arrived safely , but Christie suffered a miscarriage at the journey 's end . Chinua rejoined them soon afterwards in Ogidi . These cities were safe from military incursion because they were in the southeast , part of the region which would later secede . 
 Once the family had resettled in Enugu , Achebe and his friend Christopher Okigbo started a publishing house called Citadel Press , to improve the quality and increase the quantity of literature available to younger readers . One of its first submissions was a story called How the Dog was Domesticated , which Achebe revised and rewrote , turning it into a complex allegory for the country 's political tumult . Its final title was How the Leopard Got His Claws . Years later a Nigerian intelligence officer told Achebe , " of all the things that came out of Biafra , that book was the most important . " 
 = = = Nigeria @-@ Biafra War = = = 
 In May 1967 , the southeastern region of Nigeria broke away to form the Republic of Biafra ; in July the Nigerian military attacked to suppress what it considered an unlawful rebellion . Achebe 's colleague , Christopher Okigbo , who had become a close friend of the family ( especially of Achebe 's son , young Ikechukwu ) , volunteered to join the secessionist army while simultaneously working at the press . Achebe 's house was bombed one afternoon ; Christie had taken the children to visit her sick mother , so the only victims were his books and papers . The Achebe family narrowly escaped disaster several times during the war . Five days later , Christopher Okigbo was killed on the war 's front line . Achebe was shaken considerably by the loss ; in 1971 he wrote " Dirge for Okigbo " , originally in the Igbo language but later translated to English . 
 As the war intensified , the Achebe family was forced to leave Enugu for the Biafran capital of Aba . As the turmoil closed in , he continued to write , but most of his creative work during the war took the form of poetry . The shorter format was a consequence of living in a war zone . " I can write poetry , " he said , " something short , intense more in keeping with my mood ... All this is creating in the context of our struggle . " Many of these poems were collected in his 1971 book Beware , Soul Brother . One of his most famous , " Refugee Mother and Child " , spoke to the suffering and loss that surrounded him . Dedicated to the promise of Biafra , he accepted a request to serve as foreign ambassador , refusing an invitation from the Program of African Studies at Northwestern University in the US . Achebe traveled to many cities in Europe , including London , where he continued his work with the African Writers Series project at Heinemann . 
 During the war , relations between writers in Nigeria and Biafra were strained . Achebe and John Pepper Clark had a tense confrontation in London over their respective support for opposing sides of the conflict . Achebe demanded that the publisher withdraw the dedication of A Man of the People he had given to Clark . Years later , their friendship healed and the dedication was restored . Meanwhile , their contemporary Wole Soyinka was imprisoned for meeting with Biafran officials , and spent two years in jail . Speaking in 1968 , Achebe said : " I find the Nigerian situation untenable . If I had been a Nigerian , I think I would have been in the same situation as Wole Soyinka is – in prison . " 
 The Nigerian government , under the leadership of General <unk> <unk> , was backed by the British government ; the two nations enjoyed a vigorous trade partnership . Addressing the causes of the war in 1968 , Achebe lashed out at the Nigerian political and military forces that had forced Biafra to secede . He framed the conflict in terms of the country 's colonial past . The writer in Nigeria , he said , " found that the independence his country was supposed to have won was totally without content ... The old white master was still in power . He had got himself a bunch of black stooges to do his dirty work for a commission . " 
 Conditions in Biafra worsened as the war continued . In September 1968 , the city of Aba fell to the Nigerian military and Achebe once again moved his family , this time to Umuahia , where the Biafran government had also relocated . He was chosen to chair the newly formed National Guidance Committee , charged with the task of drafting principles and ideas for the post @-@ war era . In 1969 , the group completed a document entitled The Principles of the Biafran Revolution , later released as The <unk> Declaration . 
 In October of the same year , Achebe joined writers Cyprian Ekwensi and Gabriel Okara for a tour of the United States to raise awareness about the dire situation in Biafra . They visited thirty college campuses and conducted countless interviews . While in the southern US , Achebe learned for the first time of the Igbo Landing , a true story of a group of Igbo captives who drowned themselves in 1803 – rather than endure the brutality of slavery – after surviving through the Middle Passage . Although the group was well received by students and faculty , Achebe was " shocked " by the harsh racist attitude toward Africa he saw in the US . At the end of the tour , he said that " world policy is absolutely ruthless and unfeeling " . 
 The beginning of 1970 saw the end of the state of Biafra . On 12 January , the military surrendered to Nigeria , and Achebe returned with his family to Ogidi , where their home had been destroyed . He took a job at the University of Nigeria in Nsukka and immersed himself once again in academia . He was unable to accept invitations to other countries , however , because the Nigerian government revoked his passport due to his support for Biafra . 
 = = = Postwar academia = = = 
 After the war , Achebe helped start two magazines : the literary journal Okike , a forum for African art , fiction , and poetry ; and <unk> , an internal publication of the University ( motto : " <unk> , Fearless , Brutal and True " ) . Achebe and the Okike committee later established another cultural magazine , Uwa Ndi Igbo , to showcase the indigenous stories and oral traditions of the Igbo community . In February 1972 he released Girls at War , a collection of short stories ranging in time from his undergraduate days to the recent bloodshed . It was the 100th book in Heinemann 's African Writers Series . 
 The University of Massachusetts Amherst offered Achebe a professorship later that year , and the family moved to the United States . Their youngest daughter was displeased with her nursery school , and the family soon learned that her frustration involved language . Achebe helped her face the " alien experience " ( as he called it ) by telling her stories during the car trips to and from school . 
 As he presented his lessons to a wide variety of students ( he taught only one class , to a large audience ) , he began to study the perceptions of Africa in Western scholarship : " Africa is not like anywhere else they know ... there are no real people in the Dark Continent , only forces operating ; and people don 't speak any language you can understand , they just grunt , too busy jumping up and down in a frenzy " . 
 = = = = Criticism of Conrad = = = = 
 Achebe expanded this criticism when he presented a Chancellor 's Lecture at Amherst on 18 February 1975 , An Image of Africa : Racism in Conrad 's " Heart of Darkness " . <unk> Joseph Conrad as " a bloody racist " , Achebe asserted that Conrad 's famous novel <unk> Africans , rendering Africa as " a metaphysical battlefield devoid of all recognisable humanity , into which the wandering European enters at his peril . " 
 Achebe also discussed a quotation from Albert Schweitzer , a 1952 Nobel Peace Prize laureate : " That extraordinary missionary , Albert Schweitzer , who sacrificed brilliant careers in music and theology in Europe for a life of service to Africans in much the same area as Conrad writes about , epitomizes the ambivalence . In a comment which has often been quoted Schweitzer says : ' The African is indeed my brother but my junior brother . ' And so he proceeded to build a hospital appropriate to the needs of junior brothers with standards of hygiene reminiscent of medical practice in the days before the germ theory of disease came into being . " Some were surprised that Achebe would challenge a man honoured in the West for his " reverence for life " , and recognised as a paragon of Western liberalism . 
 The lecture caused a storm of controversy , even at the reception immediately following his talk . Many English professors in attendance were upset by his remarks ; one elderly professor reportedly approached him , said : " How dare you ! " , and stormed away . Another suggested that Achebe had " no sense of humour " , but several days later Achebe was approached by a third professor , who told him : " I now realize that I had never really read Heart of Darkness although I have taught it for years . " Although the lecture angered many of his colleagues , he was nevertheless presented later in 1975 with an honorary doctorate from the University of Stirling and the Lotus Prize for Afro @-@ Asian Writers . 
 The first comprehensive rebuttal of Achebe 's critique was published in 1983 by British critic Cedric Watts . His essay " A Bloody Racist : About Achebe 's View of Conrad " defends Heart of Darkness as an anti @-@ imperialist novel , suggesting that " part of its greatness lies in the power of its criticisms of racial prejudice . " Palestinian – American theorist Edward Said agreed in his book Culture and Imperialism that Conrad criticised imperialism , but added : " As a creature of his time , Conrad could not grant the natives their freedom , despite his severe critique of the imperialism that enslaved them " . Building on Watts and Said , <unk> <unk> argued that " underneath the first layer of straightforward opposition ... we find an underlying mimetic continuity between Conrad 's colonial image of Africa [ in Heart of Darkness ] and Achebe 's postcolonial representation " in Things Fall Apart . 
 Achebe 's criticism has become a mainstream perspective on Conrad 's work . The essay was included in the 1988 Norton critical edition of Conrad 's novel . Editor Robert Kimbrough called it one of " the three most important events in Heart of Darkness criticism since the second edition of his book ... " Critic Nicolas <unk> divides Conrad criticism " into two epochal phases : before and after Achebe . " Asked frequently about his essay , Achebe once explained that he never meant for the work to be abandoned : " It 's not in my nature to talk about banning books . I am saying , read it – with the kind of understanding and with the knowledge I talk about . And read it beside African works . " Interviewed on National Public Radio with Robert Siegel , in October 2009 , Achebe remains consistent , although tempering this criticism in a discussion entitled " ' Heart of Darkness ' is inappropriate " : " Conrad was a seductive writer . He could pull his reader into the fray . And if it were not for what he said about me and my people , I would probably be thinking only of that seduction . " 
 = = = Retirement and politics = = = 
 When he returned to the University of Nigeria in 1976 , he hoped to accomplish three goals : finish the novel he had been writing , renew the native publication of Okike , and further his study of Igbo culture . He also showed that he would not restrict his criticism to European targets . In an August 1976 interview , he lashed out at the archetypal Nigerian intellectual , who is divorced from the intellect " but for two things : status and stomach . And if there 's any danger that he might suffer official displeasure or lose his job , he would prefer to turn a blind eye to what is happening around him . " In October 1979 , Achebe was awarded the first @-@ ever Nigerian National Merit Award . 
 In 1980 he met James Baldwin at a conference held by the African Literature Association in Gainesville , Florida , USA . The writers – with similar political perspectives , beliefs about language , and faith in the liberating potential of literature – were eager to meet one another . Baldwin said : " It 's very important that we should meet each other , finally , if I must say so , after something like 400 years . " 
 In 1982 , Achebe retired from the University of Nigeria . He devoted more time to editing Okike and became active with the left @-@ leaning People 's Redemption Party ( PRP ) . In 1983 , he became the party 's deputy national vice @-@ president . He published a book called The Trouble with Nigeria to coincide with the upcoming elections . On the first page , Achebe says bluntly : " the Nigerian problem is the unwillingness or inability of its leaders to rise to the responsibility and to the challenge of personal example which are the hallmarks of true leadership . " 
 The elections that followed were marked by violence and charges of fraud . Asked whether he thought Nigerian politics had changed since A Man of the People , Achebe replied : " I think , if anything , the Nigerian politician has deteriorated . " After the elections , he engaged in a heated argument – which almost became a fistfight – with Bakin <unk> , the newly elected governor of Kano State . He left the PRP and afterwards kept his distance from political parties , expressing his sadness at the dishonesty and weakness of the people involved . 
 He spent most of the 1980s delivering speeches , attending conferences , and working on his sixth novel . He also continued winning awards and collecting honorary degrees . In 1986 he was elected president @-@ general of the Ogidi Town Union ; he reluctantly accepted and began a three @-@ year term . In the same year , he stepped down as editor of Okike . 
 = = = Anthills and paralysis = = = 
 In 1987 Achebe released his fifth novel , Anthills of the Savannah , about a military coup in the fictional West African nation of Kangan . A finalist for the Booker Prize , the novel was hailed in the Financial Times : " in a powerful fusion of myth , legend and modern styles , Achebe has written a book which is wise , exciting and essential , a powerful antidote to the cynical commentators from ' overseas ' who see nothing ever new out of Africa . " An opinion piece in the magazine West Africa said the book deserved to win the Booker Prize , and that Achebe was " a writer who has long deserved the recognition that has already been accorded him by his sales figures . " The prize went instead to Penelope Lively 's novel Moon Tiger . 
 On 22 March 1990 , Achebe was riding in a car to Lagos when an axle collapsed and the car flipped . His son Ikechukwu and the driver suffered minor injuries , but the weight of the vehicle fell on Achebe and his spine was severely damaged . He was flown to the Paddocks Hospital in Buckinghamshire , England , and treated for his injuries . In July doctors announced that although he was recuperating well , he was paralyzed from the waist down and would require the use of a wheelchair for the rest of his life . 
 Soon afterwards , Achebe became the Charles P. Stevenson Professor of Languages and Literature at Bard College in Annandale @-@ on @-@ Hudson , New York ; he held the position for more than fifteen years . In 1999 , Achebe was awarded the St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis University Library Associates . In the autumn of 2009 he joined the Brown University faculty as the David and Marianna Fisher University Professor of Africana Studies . 
 = = = Later in his life as a publisher = = = 
 In October 2005 , the London Financial Times reported that Achebe was planning to write a novella for the Canongate Myth Series , a series of short novels in which ancient myths from myriad cultures are reimagined and rewritten by contemporary authors . Achebe 's novella has not yet been scheduled for publication . 
 In June 2007 , Achebe was awarded the Man Booker International Prize . The judging panel included US critic Elaine Showalter , who said he " illuminated the path for writers around the world seeking new words and forms for new realities and societies " ; and South African writer Nadine Gordimer , who said Achebe has achieved " what one of his characters brilliantly defines as the writer 's purpose : ' a new @-@ found utterance ' for the capture of life 's complexity " . In 2010 , Achebe was awarded The Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize for $ 300 @,@ 000 , one of the richest prizes for the arts . Also in 2010 , a collection of <unk> autobiographical essays were published under the title The Education of A British @-@ Protected Child . 
 In October 2012 , Achebe 's publishers , Penguin Books , released There Was a Country : A Personal History of Biafra . Publication immediately caused a stir and re @-@ opened the discussion about the Nigerian Civil War . It would prove to be the last publication during his lifetime . 
 Fondly called the " father of African literature " , Achebe died after a short illness on 21 March 2013 in Boston , United States . An unidentified source close to the family said that he was ill for a while and had been hospitalised in the city . Penguin publishing director Simon Winder said : " ... we are all desolate to hear of his death . " The New York Times described him in his obituary as " one of Africa 's most widely read novelists and one of the continent 's towering men of letters " . The BBC wrote that he was " revered throughout the world for his depiction of life in Africa " . He was laid to rest in his hometown in Ogidi , Anambra State . 
 = = Style = = 
 = = = Oral tradition = = = 
 The style of Achebe 's fiction draws heavily on the oral tradition of the Igbo people . He weaves folk tales into the fabric of his stories , illuminating community values in both the content and the form of the storytelling . The tale about the Earth and Sky in Things Fall Apart , for example , emphasises the interdependency of the masculine and the feminine . Although Nwoye enjoys hearing his mother tell the tale , Okonkwo 's dislike for it is evidence of his imbalance . Later , Nwoye avoids beatings from his father by pretending to dislike such " women 's stories " . 
 Another hallmark of Achebe 's style is the use of proverbs , which often illustrate the values of the rural Igbo tradition . He sprinkles them throughout the narratives , repeating points made in conversation . Critic Anjali Gera notes that the use of proverbs in Arrow of God " serves to create through an echo effect the judgement of a community upon an individual violation . " The use of such repetition in Achebe 's urban novels , No Longer at Ease and A Man of the People , is less pronounced . 
 For Achebe , however , proverbs and folk stories are not the sum total of the oral Igbo tradition . In combining philosophical thought and public performance into the use of oratory ( " <unk> Oka " – " speech artistry " – in the Igbo phrase ) , his characters exhibit what he called " a matter of individual excellence ... part of Igbo culture . " In Things Fall Apart , Okonkwo 's friend <unk> voices the most impassioned oratory , crystallising the events and their significance for the village . <unk> in Arrow of God also exhibits a mastery of oratory , albeit for malicious ends . 
 Achebe frequently includes folk songs and descriptions of dancing in his work . Obi , the protagonist of No Longer at Ease , is at one point met by women singing a " Song of the Heart " , which Achebe gives in both Igbo and English : " Is everyone here ? / ( Hele ee he ee he ) " In Things Fall Apart , ceremonial dancing and the singing of folk songs reflect the realities of Igbo tradition . The elderly <unk> , attempting to shake Okonkwo out of his self @-@ pity , refers to a song sung after the death of a woman : " For whom is it well , for whom is it well ? There is no one for whom it is well . " This song contrasts with the " gay and rollicking tunes of evangelism " sung later by the white missionaries . 
 Achebe 's short stories are not as widely studied as his novels , and Achebe himself did not consider them a major part of his work . In the preface for Girls at War and Other Stories , he writes : " A dozen pieces in twenty years must be accounted a pretty lean harvest by any reckoning . " Like his novels , the short stories are heavily influenced by the oral tradition . And like the folktales they follow , the stories often have morals emphasising the importance of cultural traditions . 
 = = = Use of English = = = 
 As the decolonisation process unfolded in the 1950s , a debate about choice of language erupted and pursued authors around the world ; Achebe was no exception . Indeed , because of his subject matter and insistence on a non @-@ colonial narrative , he found his novels and decisions interrogated with extreme scrutiny – particularly with regard to his use of English . One school of thought , championed by Kenyan writer Ngũgĩ wa Thiong 'o , urged the use of indigenous African languages . English and other European languages , he said in 1986 , were " part of the neo @-@ colonial structures that repress progressive ideas " . 
 Achebe chose to write in English . In his essay " The African Writer and the English Language " , he discusses how the process of colonialism – for all its ills – provided colonised people from varying linguistic backgrounds " a language with which to talk to one another " . As his purpose is to communicate with readers across Nigeria , he uses " the one central language enjoying nationwide currency " . Using English also allowed his books to be read in the colonial ruling nations . 
 Still , Achebe recognises the shortcomings of what Audre Lorde called " the master 's tools " . In another essay he notes : 
 For an African writing in English is not without its serious setbacks . He often finds himself describing situations or modes of thought which have no direct equivalent in the English way of life . Caught in that situation he can do one of two things . He can try and contain what he wants to say within the limits of conventional English or he can try to push back those limits to accommodate his ideas ... I submit that those who can do the work of extending the frontiers of English so as to accommodate African thought @-@ patterns must do it through their mastery of English and not out of innocence . 
 In another essay , he refers to James Baldwin 's struggle to use the English language to accurately represent his experience , and his realisation that he needed to take control of the language and expand it . The Nigerian poet and novelist Gabriel Okara likens the process of language @-@ expansion to the evolution of jazz music in the United States . 
 Achebe 's novels laid a formidable groundwork for this process . By altering syntax , usage , and idiom , he transforms the language into a distinctly African style . In some spots this takes the form of repetition of an Igbo idea in standard English parlance ; elsewhere it appears as narrative asides integrated into descriptive sentences . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Achebe 's novels approach a variety of themes . In his early writing , a depiction of the Igbo culture itself is paramount . Critic <unk> Yousaf highlights the importance of these depictions : " Around the tragic stories of Okonkwo and Ezeulu , Achebe sets about <unk> Igbo cultural identity " . The portrayal of indigenous life is not simply a matter of literary background , he adds : " Achebe seeks to produce the effect of a precolonial reality as an Igbo @-@ centric response to a <unk> constructed imperial ' reality ' " . Certain elements of Achebe 's depiction of Igbo life in Things Fall Apart match those in Olaudah Equiano 's autobiographical Narrative . Responding to charges that Equiano was not actually born in Africa , Achebe wrote in 1975 : " Equiano was an Igbo , I believe , from the village of <unk> in the Orlu division of Nigeria " . 
 = = = Culture and colonialism = = = 
 A prevalent theme in Achebe 's novels is the intersection of African tradition ( particularly Igbo varieties ) and modernity , especially as embodied by European colonialism . The village of Umuofia in Things Fall Apart , for example , is violently shaken with internal divisions when the white Christian missionaries arrive . Nigerian English professor Ernest N. <unk> describes the colonial experience in the novel as " the systematic emasculation of the entire culture " . Achebe later embodied this tension between African tradition and Western influence in the figure of Sam Okoli , the president of Kangan in Anthills of the Savannah . <unk> from the myths and tales of the community by his Westernised education , he does not have the capacity for reconnection shown by the character Beatrice . 
 The colonial impact on the Igbo in Achebe 's novels is often effected by individuals from Europe , but institutions and urban offices frequently serve a similar purpose . The character of Obi in No Longer at Ease succumbs to colonial @-@ era corruption in the city ; the temptations of his position overwhelm his identity and fortitude . The courts and the position of District Commissioner in Things Fall Apart likewise clash with the traditions of the Igbo , and remove their ability to participate in structures of decision @-@ making . 
 The standard <unk> ending results in the destruction of an individual and , by synecdoche , the downfall of the community . <unk> 's descent into the luxury of corruption and hedonism in A Man of the People , for example , is symbolic of the post @-@ colonial crisis in Nigeria and elsewhere . Even with the emphasis on colonialism , however , Achebe 's tragic endings embody the traditional confluence of fate , individual and society , as represented by Sophocles and Shakespeare . 
 Still , Achebe seeks to portray neither moral absolutes nor a fatalistic inevitability . In 1972 , he said : " I never will take the stand that the Old must win or that the New must win . The point is that no single truth satisfied me — and this is well founded in the Ibo world view . No single man can be correct all the time , no single idea can be totally correct . " His perspective is reflected in the words of <unk> , a character in Anthills of the Savannah : " whatever you are is never enough ; you must find a way to accept something , however small , from the other to make you whole and to save you from the mortal sin of righteousness and extremism . " And in a 1996 interview , Achebe said : " Belief in either radicalism or orthodoxy is too simplified a way of viewing things ... Evil is never all evil ; goodness on the other hand is often tainted with selfishness . " 
 = = = Masculinity and femininity = = = 
 The gender roles of men and women , as well as societies ' conceptions of the associated concepts , are frequent themes in Achebe 's writing . He has been criticised as a sexist author , in response to what many call the uncritical depiction of traditionally patriarchal Igbo society , where the most masculine men take numerous wives , and women are beaten regularly . Paradoxically , Igbo society immensely values individual achievement but also sees the ownership over or acquisition of women as a signifier of success . As seen in Things Fall Apart , Igbo society condemns violence but Okonkwo 's ability to control ‘ his ’ women is inextricably connected to his dignity . Thus , women are automatically <unk> in terms of achieving high status related to personal achievement . Others suggest that Achebe is merely representing the limited gendered vision of the characters , and they note that in his later works , he tries to demonstrate the inherent dangers of excluding women from society . It is also suggested that Achebe purposefully created exaggerated gender binaries in order to render Igbo history recognizable to international readers . Still others suggest that reading Achebe through a womanist lens enables an understanding of Igbo conceptions of gender complementarity . <unk> is “ an <unk> concept forged out of global feminism to analyze the condition of Black African women ” that acknowledges the patriarchal oppression of women , but also highlights the resistance and dignity of African women . As the representation of Igbo society and kinship structures in novels such as Things Fall Apart differs considerably from the work of African feminist anthropology , the representation should not be taken literally ; rather , the reader should consider the roles of both women and men as intentionally stark and in opposition . In any case , a careful reading of Achebe paradoxically recognizes the hyperbolic representation of gender politics in Igbo society , while acknowledging the necessary nuance that gives Achebe ’ s women some agency and prominence . 
 In Things Fall Apart , Okonkwo 's furious manhood overpowers everything " feminine " in his life , including his own conscience . For example , when he feels bad after being forced to kill his adopted son , he asks himself : " When did you become a shivering old woman ? " It is also argued that one ’ s chi , or personal god , is the ‘ mother within ’ . This understanding further demonstrates how Okonkwo ’ s <unk> corrupts his conscience , as his contempt for his own mother and other women prevents him from being in harmony with his chi . He views all things feminine as distasteful , in part because they remind him of his father 's laziness and cowardice . His father was considered an <unk> — a word that refers to a man without title , but is also synonymous with ‘ woman ’ . Thus , Okonkwo not only regrets his father ’ s lack of success , but attributes it to a lack of masculinity . Okonkwo ’ s feminization of all things lacking success or power is a common theme throughout the novel . His obsession with maleness is fuelled by an intense fear of <unk> , which he expresses through physical and verbal abuse of his wives , his violence towards his community , his constant worry that his son Nwoye is not manly enough , and his wish that his daughter <unk> had been born a boy . The women in the novel , meanwhile , are obedient , quiet , and absent from positions of authority – despite the fact that Igbo women were traditionally involved in village leadership . Nevertheless , the need for feminine balance is highlighted by Ani , the earth goddess , and the extended discussion of " <unk> " ( " Mother is supreme " ) in chapter fourteen . <unk> ’ s perseverance and love for <unk> , despite her many miscarriages , is seen as a tribute to Igbo womanhood , which is typically defined by motherhood . Okonkwo 's defeat is seen by some as a vindication of the need for a balancing feminine ethos . Some have also argued that all of Okonkwo ’ s failures are tied to his contempt and fear of women and his inability to form quality personal relationships with the women in his life — his wives , his children , and his own mother . Achebe has expressed frustration at frequently being misunderstood on this point , saying that " I want to sort of scream that Things Fall Apart is on the side of women ... And that Okonkwo is paying the penalty for his treatment of women ; that all his problems , all the things he did wrong , can be seen as offenses against the feminine . " Indeed , it is argued that Okonkwo ’ s violent and vehement anti @-@ women position is the exception , not the norm , within his community of Umuofia and the wider Igbo society . Still , post @-@ colonial African writing is intensely male @-@ centred , a phenomenon that is not alleviated by the frequent trope of the African woman as the " embodiment of the male writer ’ s vision for the new Africa " . It is argued that even when women and their lives are more centrally depicted in literature , the male writer continues to be the visionary while the woman is the " sign " of changes to come . 
 Achebe 's first central female character in a novel is Beatrice <unk> in Anthills of the Savannah . As an independent woman in the city , Beatrice strives for the balance that Okonkwo lacked so severely . She refutes the notion that she needs a man , and slowly learns about <unk> , a goddess balancing the aggression of male power . Although the final stages of the novel show her functioning in a nurturing mother @-@ type role , Beatrice remains firm in her conviction that women should not be limited to such capacities . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Achebe has been called " the father of modern African writing " , and many books and essays have been written about his work over the past fifty years . In 1992 he became the first living writer to be represented in the Everyman 's Library collection published by Alfred A. Knopf . His 60th birthday was celebrated at the University of Nigeria by " an international Who 's Who in African Literature " . One observer noted : " Nothing like it had ever happened before in African literature anywhere on the continent . " 
 Achebe provided a " blueprint " for African writers of succeeding generations . In 1982 , he was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Kent . At the ceremony , professor Robert Gibson said that the Nigerian writer " is now revered as Master by the younger generation of African writers and it is to him they regularly turn for counsel and inspiration . " Even outside of Africa , his impact resonates strongly in literary circles . Novelist Margaret Atwood called him " a magical writer – one of the greatest of the twentieth century " . Poet Maya Angelou lauded Things Fall Apart as a book wherein " all readers meet their brothers , sisters , parents and friends and themselves along Nigerian roads " . Nelson Mandela , recalling his time as a political prisoner , once referred to Achebe as a writer " in whose company the prison walls fell down " , and that his work Things Fall Apart inspired him to continue the struggle to end apartheid . Nobel laureate Toni Morrison has noted that Achebe 's work inspired her to become a writer and " sparked her love affair with African literature " . 
 Achebe was the recipient of over 30 honorary degrees from universities in England , Scotland , Canada , South Africa , Nigeria and the United States , including Dartmouth College , Harvard , and Brown University . He was awarded the Commonwealth Poetry Prize , an Honorary Fellowship of the American Academy of Arts and Letters ( 1982 ) , a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences ( 2002 ) , the Nigerian National Order of Merit ( Nigeria 's highest honour for academic work ) , the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade , the Man Booker International Prize 2007 and the 2010 Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize . He was appointed Goodwill Ambassador to the United Nations Population Fund in 1999 . 
 He twice refused the Nigerian honour Commander of the Federal Republic , in 2004 and 2011 , saying : 
 " I have watched particularly the chaos in my own state of Anambra where a small clique of renegades , openly boasting its connections in high places , seems determined to turn my homeland into a bankrupt and lawless fiefdom . I am appalled by the brazenness of this clique and the silence , if not connivance , of the Presidency . " 
 Despite his scholarly achievements and the global importance of his work , Achebe never received a Nobel Prize , which some observers viewed as unjust . When Wole Soyinka was awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize in Literature , Achebe joined the rest of Nigeria in celebrating the first African ever to win the prize . He lauded Soyinka 's " stupendous display of energy and vitality " , and said he was " most eminently deserving of any prize " . In 1988 Achebe was asked by a reporter for Quality Weekly how he felt about never winning a Nobel Prize ; he replied : " My position is that the Nobel Prize is important . But it is a European prize . It 's not an African prize ... Literature is not a heavyweight championship . Nigerians may think , you know , this man has been knocked out . It 's nothing to do with that . "

Stephen Thomas Erlewine provided a favorable review , describing it as a " friendly remake of the hedonistic Blackout " , but preferred its predecessor for being more " sleek or addictive " than Circus . Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club appreciated that Spears appeared to " put some real effort into her Circus performances " , rather than seeming " flat @-@ sounding " as she felt Blackout had . Writing for Digital Spy , Nick Levine opined that Spears " sounds more confident " than she had on Blackout .

Jon Pareles of The New York Times expressed his enjoyment of the " crisp " material that incorporated " catchy melodic interludes " . Caryn Ganz from Rolling Stone opined that the " clubby , adventurous pop " included on the album could have been a satisfactory successor to her fourth album In the Zone ( 2003 ) .

 Alexis Petridis of The Guardian gave a more mixed review , suggesting that Spears appeared " frequently sounds disconnected , even a bit bored " throughout the record , whereas Blackout was a " relentless , risky album made by a woman whose obituary was apparently being prepared by Associated Press .

 Final Fantasy Chronicles is a compilation of Square 's role @-@ playing video games Final Fantasy IV and Chrono Trigger , released for the North American Sony PlayStation on June 29 , 2001 . TOSE ported both titles from the Super Nintendo Entertainment System ; each had been previously released as individual Japanese PlayStation ports in 1997 ( Final Fantasy IV ) and 1999 ( Chrono Trigger ) . Several bonus features were added to each game , such as art galleries , bestiaries , and cutscenes — including computer @-@ generated full motion video used at the beginning of Final Fantasy IV and anime scenes used throughout Chrono Trigger . 
 Final Fantasy Chronicles was received well by players and critics , who praised the peripheral features and the fact that Square was offering RPG classics to a new generation of gamers . Conversely , reviewers sharply criticized " long and frequent loading " between areas and battles due to poor emulation . Enough copies of Chronicles were sold to warrant a second release as part of Sony 's Greatest Hits in June 2003 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 In Final Fantasy IV and Chrono Trigger , the player controls a set of characters , closely following the role @-@ playing video game genre . The methods of viewing and controlling the characters are separated by three different " screens " : the overworld , where the characters traverse to different locations ; the field map , where the characters explore locations such as towns and dungeons ; and the battle screen , where the characters fight with monsters or other enemies . 
 = = = Final Fantasy IV = = = 
 Final Fantasy IV introduced the Active Time Battle , a system designed by Hiroyuki Ito . It centers around the player inputting orders for the characters in " real time " during battles . Each character is balanced through certain strengths and weaknesses ; for instance , a strong magic user may have low defense , while a physical fighter may have low agility . 
 = = = Chrono Trigger = = = 
 Chrono Trigger 's gameplay deviates from traditional role @-@ playing games in that , rather than random encounters , most enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party . Contact with enemies on a field map initiates a battle that occurs directly on the field map itself rather than on a separate battle screen . Chrono Trigger uses an updated form of the Active Time Battle introduced in Final Fantasy IV , with additions such as " Techs " that rely on enemy positioning and abilities of characters . Other features are the employment of time travel and a " New Game Plus " option . 
 = = Development = = 
 Final Fantasy Chronicles features two previously released ports by TOSE ; Final Fantasy IV and Chrono Trigger were released separately , and Final Fantasy IV was re @-@ released as a part of Final Fantasy Collection , all published in Japan . Chronicles was designed and directed by Kazuhiko Aoki , supervised by <unk> Fukaya , and produced by Akihiro Imai . It was created as a follow @-@ up to Final Fantasy Anthology , a compilation of Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy VI . 
 The original Final Fantasy IV was released in North America as Final Fantasy II in 1991 , with various " Easytype " modifications . These were removed in the Final Fantasy Chronicles version , and the game was re @-@ localized , achieving a script closer Takashi Tokita 's original scenario . Chrono Trigger , released in 1995 , was already localized by Ted Woolsey , but the Final Fantasy Chronicles version has additional modifications . 
 A primary addition to both games is full @-@ motion video . Final Fantasy IV features computer animated cutscene sequences , while Chrono Trigger features anime @-@ style sequences designed by Akira Toriyama and animated by Toei Animation that " help further tell the story of Chrono Trigger " . Final Fantasy IV was given gameplay features such as a two @-@ player mode , a " Sprint Feature " to " enhance and quicken gameplay " , and the " Memo File " system to " reduce saving time . " Chrono Trigger , instead of added gameplay features , has an " Extras Mode " . This features databases such as a bestiary and a gallery of artwork created in development .

 A compilation of Final Fantasy IV and Chrono Trigger was in consideration in December 2000 , with Final Fantasy Anthology 's success a key decision factor . Final Fantasy Chronicles was announced by Square Electronic Arts on April 17 , 2001 . President Jun Iwasaki mentioned an " overwhelming number " of requests to re @-@ release Chrono Trigger , and believed the compilation of it and Final Fantasy IV would " appeal to fans of the original games and introduce a new generation of gamers to some of our classic titles . " An event was held on July 10 in San Francisco , primarily to celebrate the film Final Fantasy : The Spirits Within and release of Final Fantasy Chronicles . It featured a cosplay contest , a memorabilia raffle , and booths to play Final Fantasy Chronicles and Final Fantasy X. 
 Music from Final Fantasy Chronicles is a set of two separately released compact discs published by TokyoPop . Final Fantasy IV Official Soundtrack and Chrono Trigger Original Soundtrack were both released on August 21 , 2001 . Final Fantasy IV Official Soundtrack is nearly the same release as Final Fantasy IV : Original Sound Version , the soundtrack album for the original game , except that the songs were rerecorded by TOSE , resulting in minor differences , some song titles were slightly changed , and a 45th track was added , " Theme of Love ( Arranged ) " , which had previously only been released as a piano version on the second track of Piano Collections Final Fantasy IV . This release has the catalog number TPCD <unk> @-@ 2 , and its 45 tracks had a length of 62 minutes . Chrono Trigger Original Soundtrack was the corresponding album for Chrono Trigger . The album was heavily based on Chrono Trigger Original Soundtrack , the soundtrack album for the PlayStation release of Chrono Trigger ; the first 21 tracks of the album out of 25 were identical to Chrono Trigger Original Soundtrack , while the next three tracks corresponded to tracks 22 , 23 , and 29 of the Original Soundtrack and the final track was the same as the first track of Brink of Time , an arranged album of Chrono Trigger music . The album is 1 : 13 : 03 long , and has a catalog number of TPCD <unk> @-@ 2 . In addition to the albums , a strategy guide for Final Fantasy Chronicles written by Dan <unk> and was published by BradyGames on July 2 , 2001 .

 Final Fantasy Chronicles was commercially and critically successful , becoming the top selling PlayStation title for two weeks , and scoring an average of 89 % in Metacritic 's aggregate , a review tallying website . Gaming website IGN rated it 9 @.@ 4 and awarded an " Editor 's Choice Award " , calling the game a " must buy " for RPG fans . 
 GameSpot reviewer Brad Shoemaker gave the game an 8 @.@ 5 , but cited " muffled sound effects " in Final Fantasy IV , and was displeased with frequent loading in Chrono Trigger . He added that the visuals were " stupendous " when the games were originally released , but they now look dated and will " turn off those looking for a bigger thrill for their gaming dollar " . Marcus Lai of Gaming Age was disappointed with a lack of additions , calling the ports " <unk> games " and claiming that the full motion videos are " nice touches to both games but don 't add much " . 
 = Harry Chauvel = 
 General Sir Henry George Chauvel , GCMG , KCB ( 16 April 1865 – 4 March 1945 ) , more usually known as Sir Harry Chauvel , was a senior officer of the Australian Imperial Force who fought at Gallipoli and during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign in the Middle Eastern theatre of the First World War . He was the first Australian to attain the rank of lieutenant general and later general , and the first to lead a corps . As commander of the Desert Mounted Corps , he was responsible for one of the most decisive victories and fastest pursuits in military history . 
 The son of a grazier , Chauvel was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Upper Clarence Light Horse , a unit organised by his father , in 1886 . After the family moved to Queensland he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Queensland Mounted Infantry in 1890 , and saw service during the 1891 Australian shearers ' strike . He became a regular officer in 1896 , and went to the United Kingdom as part of the Queensland contingent for the 1897 Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria . In 1899 he commanded one of two companies of Queensland Mounted Infantry that were Queensland 's initial contribution to the Boer War . After the war , he was closely involved with the training of the Australian Light Horse . 
 Promoted to colonel in 1913 , Chauvel became the Australian representative on the Imperial General Staff but the First World War broke out while he was still en route to the United Kingdom . Chauvel arranged for the Australian Imperial Force to be diverted to Egypt , where he joined his new command , the 1st Light Horse Brigade , in December . In May 1915 , it was sent dismounted to Gallipoli , where Chauvel assumed responsibility for some of the most dangerous parts of the line . He took charge of the 1st Division that November . In March 1916 , Chauvel became commander of the Anzac Mounted Division , gaining victories in the Battle of Romani in August and the Battle of Magdhaba in December , and nearly winning the First Battle of Gaza in March 1917 . The following month , he took over the Desert Column , later known as the Desert Mounted Corps , thereby becoming the first Australian to command a corps , and the first to reach the rank of lieutenant general . At Beersheba in October 1917 , his light horse captured the town and its vital water supply in one of history 's last great cavalry charges . By September 1918 , Chauvel was able to effect a secret redeployment of three of his mounted divisions and launch a surprise attack on the enemy that won the Battle of Megiddo . He followed up this victory with one of the fastest pursuits in military history . 
 In 1919 , Chauvel was appointed Inspector General , the Army 's most senior post . He was forced to maintain an increasingly hollow structure by politicians intent on cutting expenditure . He was concurrently Chief of the General Staff from 1923 until his retirement in 1930 . In November 1929 , he became the first Australian to be promoted to the rank of general . During the Second World War , he was recalled to duty as Inspector in Chief of the Volunteer Defence Corps . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Henry George Chauvel was born in Tabulam , New South Wales , on 16 April 1865 , the second child of a grazier , Charles Henry Edward Chauvel , and his wife Fanny Ada Mary , née James . By 1884 , Charles Henry Chauvel 's station at Tabulam consisted of 96 @,@ 000 acres ( 39 @,@ 000 ha ) , on which he raised 12 @,@ 000 head of cattle and 320 horses . From an early age Henry George Chauvel was known as " Harry " . He was educated at Mr Belcher 's School near Goulburn , before going to Sydney Grammar School from 1874 to 1880 , and Toowoomba Grammar School from 1881 to 1882 . While at Sydney Grammar , Harry served in the school cadet unit , rising to the rank of lance corporal . In 1886 , Charles Henry was given permission to raise two troops of cavalry . On 14 March 1886 , he was commissioned as a captain in the Upper Clarence Light Horse , with his sons Arthur and Harry becoming second lieutenants , while his two younger sons became troopers . The unit escorted Lord Carrington , Governor of New South Wales , when he formally opened the railway at Tenterfield in 1886 . 
 Following a series of severe droughts in northern New South Wales , Charles Henry Chauvel sold his property at Tabulam in 1888 for £ 50 @,@ 000 . After paying his debts , he bought a much smaller 12 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 4 @,@ 900 ha ) property at Canning Downs on the Darling Downs in Queensland . In 1889 , Harry Chauvel embarked on a solo tour of Europe , visiting Venice , Rome , Florence , Paris and London . While in the United Kingdom , he watched military manoeuvres near Aldershot in the presence of Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany . Harry resigned his commission in the New South Wales Military Forces when he moved to Queensland , but on 9 January 1890 he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Queensland Mounted Infantry . After completing his examinations for the rank , he was confirmed as lieutenant in June 1890 . 
 Chauvel 's unit was called up in March 1891 during the shearers ' strike that had begun earlier that year . Leading his troops and a small detachment of Queensland Police , Chauvel was given the task of escorting a party of strikebreakers to a station north of Charleville . Near Oakwood , Chauvel 's troops were confronted by a crowd of around two hundred mounted sheep shearers . When the inspector in charge of the police detachment arrested four of the shearers who were wanted by the police , the crowd became agitated , but Chauvel managed to disperse the crowd peacefully , and bring his charges safely to their destination . During the 1894 Australian shearers ' strike , the Queensland government enrolled special constables rather than calling up the militia . Chauvel was appointed a temporary sub @-@ inspector in Clermont , and later the district around Longreach . 
 On 9 September 1896 , Chauvel transferred to the Queensland Permanent Military Forces with the rank of captain in the Moreton Regiment . He was sent to the United Kingdom with the Queensland contingent for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria . Sporting the emu feathers worn by Queensland units , he marched with the colonial troops through London behind Lord Roberts on 21 June 1897 . Chauvel qualified at the School of Musketry at Hythe , Kent , and served on exchange with the 3rd Battalion , King 's Royal Rifle Corps and 2nd Battalion , Royal Berkshire Regiment at Aldershot . On returning to Australia , he became a staff officer at Headquarters , Queensland Defence Force . 
 = = Boer War = = 
 In July 1899 , the Premier of Queensland , James Dickson , offered a contingent of troops for service in South Africa in the event of war between the British Empire , and the Boer Transvaal Republic and Orange Free State . For a time Chauvel served as an enrolment officer , signing up volunteers from the Darling Downs . The Boer War broke out in October 1899 , and Chauvel was given command of one of two companies of Queensland Mounted Infantry that departed Brisbane on 1 November 1899 . They disembarked at Cape Town on 14 December and joined the Imperial force under Lord Methuen at the Orange River . The Queensland Mounted Infantry 's first fighting was in an action at Sunnyside on 1 January 1900 alongside the infantry of the Royal Canadian Regiment . In February , the Queensland Mounted Infantry became part of Major General John French 's Cavalry Division . After a strenuous march , the Cavalry Division relieved the Siege of Kimberley on 15 February . 
 In the reorganisation that followed , the Queensland Mounted Infantry became part of Major General Edward Hutton 's 1st Mounted Infantry Brigade , along with the Canadian and New Zealand mounted units . Chauvel distinguished himself fighting alongside a group of New Zealanders and capturing a Maxim gun . The Queensland Mounted Infantry participated in the capture of Pretoria and the Battle of Diamond Hill . Chauvel was given a mixed force of British , Australian , Canadian and New Zealand mounted troops that became known as " Chauvel 's Mounted Infantry " , with Victor <unk> as his chief of staff . Initially , Chauvel was given the mission of escorting 10 @,@ 000 head of cattle to Belfast , Mpumalanga to supply the troops in the eastern Transvaal . However , his force was diverted by local commanders , who assigned it to burning homesteads sheltering Boer commandos and attacking Boer units . The Queensland Mounted Infantry embarked for Australia on 13 December 1900 . They reached Brisbane on 17 January 1901 and the regiment was disbanded there on 23 January . For his part in the fighting , Chauvel was mentioned in despatches , and appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George ( CMG ) . 
 On 1 January 1901 , the colonies of Australia federated to form the Commonwealth of Australia . When Chauvel returned to Australia on 17 January , he found that during his absence he had become an officer in the newly formed Australian Army . A force of 14 @,@ 000 troops was assembled for the opening of the first Federal Parliament on 9 May 1901 in Melbourne ; Chauvel was selected as brigade major of the mounted contingent , his first Federal posting . He became Staff Officer , Northern Military District , based at Townsville , Queensland , in July . In 1902 , Chauvel was appointed to command of the 7th Commonwealth Light Horse , a unit newly raised for service in South Africa , with the local rank of lieutenant colonel . Departing from Brisbane on 17 May 1902 , the 7th Commonwealth Light Horse arrived at Durban on 22 June , three weeks after the war ended . It therefore re @-@ embarked for Brisbane , where it was disbanded . Chauvel remained in South Africa for a few weeks in order to tour the battlefields . On returning to Australia he became Staff Officer , Northern Military District once more . He was promoted to the brevet rank of lieutenant colonel in December 1902 . 
 In 1903 , Hutton , now General Officer Commanding Australian Military Forces , sent Chauvel to South Australia to organise the light horse regiments there . On returning to Queensland in 1904 , he became acting Chief Staff Officer Queensland , based in Brisbane . He was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant colonel in December 1909 , but his ambition to become the Australian representative on the Imperial General Staff in London was blocked by Hutton 's successor Major General Charles Hoad . Based on his experiences in South Africa , Chauvel propounded ideas on the nature of mounted infantry . He recommended that Australian troops improve their discipline in the field , called for stronger leadership from officers , and emphasised the need for better organisation for supply and for timely and efficient medical evacuation . 
 Chauvel knew Keith <unk> of Newmarket , Queensland even before the Boer War , and while stationed in Brisbane , Chauvel and Major Brudenell White played tennis at the <unk> ' place with their daughters Dora and Sibyl . Chauvel became engaged to Sibyl in January 1906 , and they were married on 16 June 1906 at All Saints Anglican Church , Brisbane . Their union ultimately produced two sons and two daughters . That year Chauvel also sold the property at Canning Downs South . In the shuffle of senior positions that followed Hoad 's death in 1911 , Chauvel was appointed to the Military Board in Melbourne as Adjutant General . As such , Chauvel was involved in the implementation of the universal training scheme . Chauvel was particularly involved with the training of the light horse . " When the next war comes , " White predicted , " it will only need an Ashby or a J.E.B. Stuart to make their name immortal . "

 Chauvel was promoted to colonel in 1913 . On 3 July 1914 , he sailed for England with his wife and three children to replace Colonel James Gordon Legge as the Australian representative on the Imperial General Staff . While he was still travelling , the First World War broke out . On reporting for duty at the War Office in mid @-@ August 1914 , Chauvel was given a cable directing him to assume command of the 1st Light Horse Brigade of the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) when it arrived in the United Kingdom . Chauvel became concerned with slow progress on construction of the AIF 's proposed quarters on the Salisbury Plain . He made frequent visits to the site and had a Royal Australian Engineers officer , Major Cecil Henry <unk> , appointed to the local staff to safeguard Australian interests . Convinced that the huts would not be ready on time , and that Australian troops would therefore have to spend a winter on Salisbury Plain under canvas , Chauvel persuaded the High Commissioner for Australia in London , former Prime Minister Sir George Reid , to approach Lord Kitchener with an alternate plan of diverting the AIF to Egypt , which was done . Accompanied by Major Thomas Blamey , Chauvel sailed for Egypt on the ocean liner SS <unk> on 28 November 1914 , arriving at Port Said on 10 December 1914 . 
 = = = Gallipoli = = = 
 Chauvel began training his Brigade upon arrival in Egypt . He was noted for insisting on high standards of dress and bearing from his troops . The 1st Light Horse Brigade became part of Major General Alexander Godley 's New Zealand and Australian Division , along with the 4th Infantry Brigade , the New Zealand Infantry Brigade and New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade . When the rest of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps departed for Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915 , the mounted brigades remained in Egypt – the Gallipoli Peninsula being unsuited to mounted operations . Following heavy casualties in the early days of the Gallipoli Campaign , however , the light horse were called upon to provide 1 @,@ 000 reinforcements . The British commander in Egypt , Lieutenant General Sir John Maxwell , elected instead to ship the mounted brigades to Anzac Cove intact . 
 Chauvel arrived on 12 May 1915 and took over the critical sector , which included Pope 's Hill and Quinn 's , Courtney 's and Steele 's Posts , from Colonel John Monash . Open to Turkish observation on two sides , these four advanced posts at the top of Monash Valley were the linchpin of the defence . Chauvel reorganised the defence , appointing permanent commanders for the posts . He also formed special sniper groups who eventually managed to suppress the Turkish snipers , making it safe even for mule trains to move up Monash Valley . Chauvel 's brigade soon found itself under heavy pressure from the Turks . On 29 May 1915 , the Turks fired a mine under Quinn 's Post and broke into it . The permanent commander of the post , Lieutenant Colonel J. H. Cannan was absent on leave and the acting commander , Lieutenant Colonel G. J. Burnage was wounded in the fighting . Chauvel responded by bringing up reserves and appointing a temporary post commander , Lieutenant Colonel H. Pope , with orders to drive the Turks out at all costs . Major S. C. E. Herring was miraculously able to charge across the open practically unscathed , his attack having coincided with a Turkish one on another part of the post so that the Turkish machine gunners could not shoot without hitting their own men . There were in fact only about seventeen Turks in the post , who eventually surrendered . Chauvel 's decision may have been the wrong one , but it was decisive ; he was also lucky . For this action , he was mentioned in despatches . 
 On 9 July 1915 , Chauvel was promoted to brigadier general , back @-@ dated to when he assumed command of the 1st Light Horse Brigade on 10 December 1914 . He spent six weeks in Egypt , in June and July , in hospital with pleurisy , but returned in time for the August offensive , for which he was mentioned in despatches . Chauvel was acting commander of the New Zealand and Australian Division for short periods in September and October in Godley 's absence . Then on 6 November 1915 , he became commander of the 1st Division , and was promoted to major general . He commanded this division through the final phase of the Gallipoli Campaign , the evacuation , and the reorganisation in Egypt in February and March 1916 . For his part in the evacuation , he was mentioned in despatches . His role in the campaign as a whole was recognised by his appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Bath . 
 = = = Sinai = = = 
 = = = = Anzac Mounted Division = = = = 
 Chauvel assumed command of the newly formed Anzac Mounted Division on 16 March 1916 , the day after it relieved the 1st Division on the Suez Canal defences . Chauvel was again mentioned in despatches for his part in the defence of the Canal . His division was committed to No. 3 Section of the Suez Canal Defences , the northern part of the Canal , under Major General H. A. Lawrence . Arrangements were far from ideal . The mounted troops were parcelled out so that only two brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division remained under Chauvel 's command . The 3rd Light Horse Brigade had been placed under No. 2 Section by General Sir Archibald Murray GHQ Egyptian Expeditionary Force ( EEF ) . Lawrence was too far away to control the battle , especially once the telephone lines were cut . Murray , in Ismailia , was even further back . 
 Chauvel was no hard @-@ riding gambler against odds . Like Alva , he could on occasion ignore the ardent enthusiasm of his officers and bide his time . Always cool , and looking far enough ahead to see the importance of any particular fight in its proper relation to the war as a whole , he was brave enough to break off an engagement if it promised victory only at what he considered an excessive cost to his men and horses . He fought to win , but not at any price . He sought victory on his own terms . He always retained , even in heated moments of battle , when leaders are often careless of life , a very rare concern for the lives of his men and his horses . 
 For the Battle of Romani , Chauvel chose his ground carefully , reconnoitring it from the ground and the air , and selecting both forward and fall back positions . His luck held ; the German commander — Friedrich <unk> von Kressenstein — selected the same position as the forming up area for his attack in August 1916 . Under great pressure , Chauvel maintained his position until Brigadier @-@ General Edward Chaytor 's New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade arrived after being released by Lawrence . The counter @-@ attack that Chauvel had been calling for all day did not materialise until dusk . At Katia and again at Bir el Abd , Chauvel attempted to sweep around the Turkish flank but wound up making frontal attacks on the Turkish rearguard and was beaten off by determined counter @-@ attacks and artillery fire against the 3rd Light Horse Brigade . Despite killing 1 @,@ 250 Turks and taking over 4 @,@ 000 prisoners , Chauvel was criticised for his failure to rout and destroy the Turks . However , for the Australian and New Zealand horsemen , who suffered over 900 of the 1 @,@ 130 British casualties , it was a clear @-@ cut victory , their first decisive win and the turning point of the campaign . Later , Chauvel realised that Romani was the first decisive British victory of the war outside West Africa Campaign . 
 In his report to the War Office on the battle , Murray passed lightly over the part played by the Anzac Mounted Division . The majority of awards for the Battle of Romani went to British troops , including a generous number to officers of Murray 's staff . Lawrence was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath , but Chauvel , having already been made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George for South Africa and Companion of the Order of the Bath for Gallipoli , was recommended for a lesser award , which he refused . In view of this , Murray decided that Chauvel should receive no award at all , and he was merely mentioned in despatches . 
 = = = = Desert Column = = = = 
 In October 1916 Major General Sir Charles Macpherson Dobell , a Canadian officer with broad experience in fighting colonial wars took over command of Eastern Force . Its advanced troops – including Chauvel 's Anzac Mounted Division – became part of the newly formed Desert Column under Major @-@ General Sir Philip Chetwode , a British cavalry baronet . In the Battle of Magdhaba in December 1916 , Chauvel therefore was answerable to the newly arrived Chetwode , instead of the distant commanders on the Canal . His intelligence on enemy dispositions was considerably better thanks to the work of the aviators of No. 5 Wing , which consisted of No. 14 Squadron , Royal Flying Corps and No. 1 Squadron , Australian Flying Corps . However , he had only limited time to capture the position and its water supply , and when the issue was in doubt Chauvel ordered a withdrawal . The order was ignored by Brigadier @-@ General Charles Frederick Cox of the 1st Light Horse Brigade , whose troops carried the position , and was cancelled by Chetwode . Despite his premature withdrawal order , it was Chauvel 's plan of attack that won the battle . " Chauvel 's leadership , " wrote Henry Gullett , " was distinguished by the rapidity with which he summed up the very obscure Turkish position in the early morning , and by his judgement and characteristic patience in keeping so much of his force in reserve until the fight developed sufficiently to ensure its most profitable employment . " 
 Chauvel gained another important success in the Battle of Rafa in January 1917 . In many ways , the battle was similar to Magdhaba , but the Turkish position was stronger and the threat of its reinforcement was greater . Once again , the availability of water was a crucial feature of the battle . This time it was Chetwode who decided to call off the battle , with Chauvel 's concurrence , but once again the troops carried the day . The victories at Magdhaba and Rafah changed Murray 's mind about awarding Chauvel a knighthood and in January 1917 Chauvel was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George . In July , he was mentioned in despatches for these operations . 
 However , Chauvel continued to be concerned about the lack of recognition for Australian and New Zealand troops and on 28 September 1917 wrote : 
 The point is now that , during the period covered by Sir Archibald 's Despatch of 1 – 3 – 17 , the Australia and New Zealand Troops well know that , with the exception of the 5th Mounted Brigade and some Yeomanry Companies of the I.C.C. , they were absolutely the only troops engaged with the enemy on this front and yet they see that they have again got a very small portion indeed of the hundreds of Honours and Rewards ( including mentions in Despatches ) that have been granted . My Lists when commanding the A. & N.Z. Mounted Division , were modest ones under all the circumstances and in that perhaps I am partly to blame but , as you will see by attached list , a good many of my recommendations were cut out and in some cases those recommended for decorations were not even mentioned in Despatches . I am well aware that it is difficult to do anything now to right this , but consider that the Commander – in – Chief [ Allenby ] should know that there is a great deal of bitterness over it . 
 Chauvel appended 32 names of soldiers he recommended for awards that had been ignored . Two New Zealanders recommended for a Bar to their Distinguished Service Orders ( DSO ) were not even mentioned in despatches and an outstanding Australian regimental commander recommended for the CMG was also not even mentioned in despatches , while a brigade commander and a staff officer Chauvel recommended for DSOs received mentions .

 In January 1917 , a second mounted division – the Imperial Mounted Division – was formed from the 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades and the British 5th and 6th Yeomanry Brigades . A British regular army officer fresh from experience in the Senussi Campaign , Major General Sir H. W. Hodgson , was appointed to command , with an all @-@ British staff . The deliberate mixing of Australian and Imperial troops was done with Chauvel 's approval but was contrary to the policy of the Australian Government , which soon registered its displeasure , sending Brigadier General Sir Robert Anderson to Cairo to discuss the matter frankly with Chauvel and his superiors . As a result , the Imperial Mounted Division was renamed the Australian Mounted Division . 
 In the First Battle of Gaza in March 1917 , Chauvel 's mission was similar to Rafa and Magdhaba , but on a larger scale . He enveloped the Turkish position at Gaza while the British 53rd ( Welsh ) Infantry Division and 54th ( East Anglian ) Infantry Division attempted to capture it . When this failed , Chetwode ordered Chauvel to attempt to capture Gaza from the rear . Chauvel successfully improvised a late afternoon assault on Gaza that captured the town despite the barriers of high cactus hedges and fierce enemy opposition , entering it after dark , only to have an out @-@ of @-@ touch Dobell order the mounted troops to withdraw , despite Chauvel 's protests . This time his brigadiers at the front , Generals Ryrie and Chaytor , although they believed that Gaza could be held , felt compelled to obey , as they could not see the whole battle . All guns , including captured ones were hauled away , as were all unwounded prisoners , the wounded and even the dead . Chauvel ensured that wounded Turkish prisoners that were unfit to make the march to Deir al @-@ Balah were each left with a full water bottle . 
 Dobell launched the Second Battle of Gaza in April 1917 with a full scale frontal assault supported by naval gunfire , tanks and poison gas . It ended even more unsatisfactorily , and Dobell was relieved of command of Eastern Force on 19 April . His place was taken by Chetwode , while Chauvel took over the Desert Column , thereby becoming the first Australian to reach the rank of lieutenant general . Command of the Anzac Mounted Division passed to Chaytor . In June , during the Stalemate in Southern Palestine , General Sir Edmund Allenby took over the EEF from Murray . Allenby moved his headquarters to Palestine and re @-@ organised his command along more regular lines . Eastern Force was abolished and two corps headquarters were formed , XX Corps under Chetwode and XXI Corps under Lieutenant General Edward Bulfin . The three corps commanders were professional soldiers , none of whom had graduated from a military college or a staff college , they had all been commissioned from the militia or volunteers . 
 Two weeks before Allenby arrived , Chauvel attended an awards ceremony : 
 Mick Bruxner ... was the first recipient and you should have seen his face when he realised he was going to be kissed ... Irwin of the 1st Regiment is a very tall man and had to have his head pulled down and they ... say that he kissed the old General back . I cannot say as I was having such a job keeping my countenance that I was pretending to read something I had in my hand . " 
 = = = = Desert Mounted Corps = = = = 
 When Chauvel learned that the Desert Column was to be renamed the 2nd Cavalry Corps he requested Desert Mounted Corps . The corps consisted of the Anzac Mounted Division , the Australian Mounted Division , the newly formed Yeomanry Mounted Division and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade . 
 Although some British thought that Allenby should replace Chauvel with a British officer , Allenby retained him in command . However he overrode Chauvel 's own preference to appoint a Royal Horse Guards officer , Brigadier General Richard Howard @-@ Vyse , known as " Wombat " , as Chauvel 's chief of staff . Chauvel thus , on 2 August 1917 , became the first Australian to permanently command a corps . A " brass @-@ bound brigadier " was quoted as saying , " Fancy giving the command of the biggest mounted force in the world 's history to an Australian . " On being told of the appointments , in a letter dated 12 August 1917 Chetwode wrote to congratulate Chauvel , " I cannot say how much I envy you the command of the largest body of mounted men ever under one hand – it is my own trade – but Fate has willed it otherwise . " At Romani Chauvel had been a battleground commander who led from the front while Chetwode , relying on the phone had been deciding to retreat at the victory at Rafa . Chetwode 's " arms length " style of command also impacted the First Battle of Gaza . 
 In the Battle of Beersheba in October 1917 , it was again Chauvel and his Desert Mounted Corps that had the critical role . Chetwode believed that the EEF did not have the resources to defeat the Turks in their fixed positions so he planned to drive the Turks from them by turning the enemy flank at Beersheba , in a waterless area on the flank of the enemy line . The Desert Mounted Corps would have a long overnight approach over waterless desert and would have to capture the town with its wells intact or be forced to retreat . The Battle of Beersheba went right down to the line , but the mission was accomplished , albeit not without a mounted infantry bayonet charge by the 4th Light Horse Brigade – the last of history 's great cavalry charges – to capture the town and its vital water supply . Few battles have been won in such spectacular fashion . For this decisive victory , and the subsequent capture of Jerusalem , Chauvel was mentioned in despatches twice more , and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1918 New Year Honours List . 
 Chauvel , however , was still disappointed with the failure to destroy the Turkish army . The Turks had fought hard , forcing the commitment of the Desert Mounted Corps in heavy action before the moment for a sweeping pursuit came . When it did , the men and horses were too tired and could not summon the required energy . In February 1918 , the EEF began a series of operations across the Jordan . Allenby soon found his British troops diverted to France , to be replaced by two Indian cavalry divisions , and the Australian Mounted Division faced a similar fate for a time . In the meantime , during the second Transjordan operations Chauvel faced great difficulties with the terrain , the weather and a tenacious enemy ; the campaign was not a success . The Desert Mounted Corps found itself fighting outnumbered , with Turkish reinforcements closing in from all sides . Chauvel was forced to withdraw to the West Bank of the Jordan . Subsequently the 5th Yeomanry Mounted Brigade was disbanded and Chauvel replaced it with the 5th Light Horse Brigade , formed from the Australian and New Zealand components of the now disbanded Imperial Camel Corps Brigade , and a composite French cavalry regiment of Spahis and Chasseurs d 'Afrique . 
 In September 1918 , Chauvel was able to effect a secret redeployment of two of his mounted divisions . Allenby launched a surprise attack on the enemy and won the Battle of Megiddo . He then followed up this victory with one of the fastest pursuits in military history – 167 km in only three days . This time he succeeded in destroying the Turkish army . The Desert Mounted Corps moved across the Golan Heights and captured Damascus on 1 October . Between 19 September and 2 October , the Australian Mounted Division lost 21 killed and 71 wounded , and captured 31 @,@ 335 Turkish prisoners . To restore calm in the city , Chauvel ordered a show of force . Lieutenant Colonel T. E. Lawrence later lampooned this as a " triumphal entry " but it was actually a shrewd political stroke , freeing Chauvel 's forces to advance another 300 km to Aleppo , which was captured on 25 October . Five days later , Turkey surrendered . For this victory , Chauvel was again mentioned in despatches . 
 Chauvel was obliged to remain in the Middle East due to the situation in Syria and the Egyptian Rebellion , although he was able to have Lady Chauvel join him there in January 1919 . By April , the situation had calmed and Chauvel was able to hand over command of the AIF in the Middle East to Ryrie . Chauvel and Lady Chauvel then headed for London on the RMS Malwa . They arrived in time for him to lead Australian troops on a victory march through the city on 3 May . Soon after , he was hospitalised at the 3rd London General Hospital at Wandsworth with appendicitis . The whole Chauvel family was able to sail for home on the transport HMAT Demosthenes on 26 July 1919 . For his services as commander of the Desert Mounted Corps , Chauvel was created a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in June 1919 , was awarded the French Croix de Guerre avec Palme by the President of France and the Order of the Nile ( 2nd Class ) by the Sultan of Egypt , and was mentioned in despatches for the 11th time . At his special request , when he was conferred with vestments and accoutrements of the Order of St Michael and St George by King George V , the King dubbed him " Sir Harry " rather than " Sir Henry " .

 = = = Between the wars = = = 
 Chauvel 's AIF appointment was terminated on 9 December 1919 , and the next day he was appointed Inspector General , the Army 's most senior post , which he held until 1930 . The office of Inspector General had been created as an auditor who provided annual reports to the Council of Defence . In the event of war , it was intended that the Inspector General would become the Commander in Chief with the Military Board as his general staff . Chauvel 's annual reports tended to emphasise the parlous state of the nation 's defences . He warned , for example , that if war came , soldiers would " be subject to the unfair handicap and the certainty of increased loss of life which inferiority in armament and shortage of ammunition must inevitability entail " . Looking back from the perspective of the Second World War , historian Gavin Long noted that Chauvel 's annual reports were " a series of wise and penetrating examinations of Australian military problems of which , however , little notice was taken " . 
 In February 1920 , Chauvel was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant general , back @-@ dated to 31 December 1919 . In January 1920 , he chaired a committee to examine the future structure of the army . The committee 's recommendations proved to be next to impossible to implement in the face of defence cuts that were imposed in 1920 and 1922 . On Lieutenant General Brudenell White 's retirement as Chief of the General Staff in 1923 , that post was divided into two , with Chauvel becoming 1st Chief of the General Staff as well as Inspector General , while Brigadier General Thomas Blamey became 2nd Chief of the General Staff . Chauvel also served as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee , being the senior of the three service chiefs . In November 1929 , he became the first Australian to be promoted to the rank of general . He attempted to maintain the Army 's structure in the face of short @-@ sighted politicians intent on cutting expenditure . As a result , the Army became increasingly hollow , retaining the form of a large force without the substance . When conscription was abolished by Prime Minister James Scullin 's government in 1929 , it was left up to Chauvel to attempt to make the new volunteer system work . He finally retired in April 1930 . 
 Chauvel 's sons Ian and Edward resigned their commissions in the Australian Army in 1930 and 1932 respectively , and accepted commissions in cavalry regiments of the British Indian Army . His daughter Elyne married Thomas Walter Mitchell , a grazier . Chauvel became a frequent visitor to their property " <unk> Hill " near Corryong , Victoria . He was staying at <unk> Hill during the Black Friday Bushfires of 1939 . When the property was threatened by fire , he directed the firefighting effort , and at one point climbed a tree close to the house to hack away burning branches . 
 The dedication of the Shrine of Remembrance in 1934 saw a series of reunions . Ian and Edward arrived from India on leave , Alexander Godley came from Britain , and Richard Howard @-@ Vyse as chief of staff to Prince Henry , Duke of Gloucester . In 1937 , Chauvel travelled to the United Kingdom as head of the Australian contingent for the coronation of King George VI , where he was welcomed by Chetwode and Howard @-@ Vyse . Chauvel had the contingent dressed as light horsemen , wearing emu plumes , bandoliers and spurs . When the Dominion troops assembled at Buckingham Palace to receive their King George VI Coronation Medals , Chauvel led the parade , with Howard @-@ Vyse as his chief of staff . On the way back , the contingent visited France , where ceremonies were held at the Villers – Bretonneux Australian National Memorial and the Arc de Triomphe . Chauvel frequently led Anzac Day parades through Melbourne but resigned from the leadership of the march in 1938 in protest against at decision by the Returned and Services League of Australia to change the form of service at the Shrine from a Christian to a secular one . 
 = = = Second World War and legacy = = = 
 During the Second World War , Chauvel was recalled to duty as Inspector in Chief of the Volunteer Defence Corps ( VDC ) , the Australian version of the British Home Guard . Following Brudenell White 's death in the Canberra air disaster , Prime Minister Robert Menzies turned to Chauvel for advice on a successor as Chief of the General Staff . On Chauvel 's recommendation , Menzies appointed Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee to the post . During the war , Chauvel 's son Ian served as staff officer in the Italian campaign , while Edward was posted to New Guinea to learn about jungle warfare from the Australian Army . Chauvel 's daughter Eve joined the Women 's Royal Australian Naval Service and spent a day in a lifeboat in the North Atlantic after her ship was torpedoed by a U @-@ Boat . Tom Mitchell was captured by the Japanese in the Battle of Singapore . Chauvel remained with the VDC , based at Victoria Barracks , Melbourne but constantly travelling on inspections until his death on 4 March 1945 . 
 Chauvel was given a state funeral service at St Paul 's Cathedral , Melbourne officiated by the Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne , Joseph John Booth , after which he was cremated at Springvale Crematorium with full military honours . Eight generals acted as pallbearers : Lieutenant General John Northcott , Chief of the General Staff ; Lieutenant General John Whitham , Corps Commander , VDC ; Major General James Cannan , Quartermaster General ; Major General Charles Brand ; Major General Cyril Clowes , GOC , Victoria Line of Communications Area ; Major General John Austin Chapman , Deputy Chief of General Staff ; Major General Charles Lloyd , Adjutant General ; and Major General Clive Steele , Engineer in Chief . 
 Portraits of Chauvel are held by the Australian War Memorial in Canberra , the Naval and Military Club in Melbourne , and the Imperial War Museum in London . A portrait by George Washington Lambert is in the possession of the family . Chauvel is commemorated in a bronze plaque in St Paul 's Cathedral , Melbourne . His sword is in Christ Church , South Yarra and his uniform in the Australian War Memorial . There is also a memorial window in the chapel of the Royal Military College , Duntroon . Chauvel Street in North Ryde , Sydney is named in his honour . 
 Chauvel 's daughter Elyne Mitchell wrote a number of non @-@ fiction works about her father and his corps . In his book Seven Pillars of Wisdom , T. E. Lawrence provided a wildly inaccurate version of Chauvel . Charles Bean noted that " this wise , good and considerate commander was far from the stupid martinet that readers of Lawrence 's Seven Pillars of Wisdom might infer . " Lawrence confessed that " little of his book was strict truth though most of it was based on fact . " 
 Chauvel 's nephew Charles Chauvel became a well @-@ known film director , whose films included Forty Thousand Horsemen ( 1940 ) , about the Battle of Beersheba . 
 Harry Chauvel was portrayed in film : by Bill Kerr in The Lighthorsemen ( 1987 ) , which covered the exploits of an Australian cavalry regiment during the Third Battle of Gaza ; by Ray Edwards in A Dangerous Man : Lawrence After Arabia ( 1990 ) , which took place around the 1919 Paris peace conference ; and by Colin Baker in the 1992 Young Indiana Jones TV movie Daredevils of the Desert , another retelling of the Third Battle of Gaza from the director of The Lighthorsemen . 
 = Franz von Hipper = 
 Franz Ritter von Hipper ( 13 September 1863 – 25 May 1932 ) was an admiral in the German Imperial Navy ( Kaiserliche Marine ) . Franz von Hipper joined the German Navy in 1881 as an officer cadet . He commanded several torpedo boat units and served as watch officer aboard several warships , as well as Kaiser Wilhelm II 's yacht <unk> Hohenzollern . Hipper commanded several cruisers in the reconnaissance forces before being appointed commander of the I Scouting Group in October 1913 . He held this position until 1918 , when he succeeded Admiral Reinhard Scheer as commander of the High Seas Fleet . 
 He is most famous for commanding the German battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group during World War I , particularly at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916 . During the war , Hipper led the German battlecruisers on several raids of the English coast , for which he was vilified in the English press as a " baby killer . " His squadron clashed with the British battlecruiser squadron at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915 , where the armored cruiser Blücher was lost . At the Battle of Jutland , Hipper 's flagship Lützow was sunk , though his ships succeeded in sinking three British battlecruisers . 
 After the end of the war in 1918 , Franz von Hipper retired from the Imperial Navy with a full pension . He initially lived under an alias and moved frequently to avoid radical revolutionaries during the German Revolution of 1918 – 1919 . After the revolution settled , he moved to Altona outside Hamburg . Unlike his superior , Reinhard Scheer , he never published a memoir of his service during the war . Hipper died on 25 May 1932 . The Kriegsmarine commemorated Hipper with the launching of the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper in 1938 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Franz Hipper was born to Anton and Anna Hipper in Weilheim in <unk> , some 40 miles ( 64 km ) south of Munich , on 13 September 1863 . His father , a shop @-@ keeper , died when Franz was three . When Franz turned five , he began his education at a Catholic grammar school in Munich . At the age of ten , Franz attended the Gymnasium in Munich . Hipper graduated from the Gymnasium in 1879 with an <unk> — the equivalent of a high school diploma . 
 After completing his education , Hipper signed up as a volunteer reserve officer ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , a one @-@ year volunteer position in the German military . After basic officer training in 1879 , Hipper decided to join the navy . He went to Kiel , where he took the <unk> , courses designed to prepare officers for the naval entrance examination , which he successfully passed . On 12 April 1881 , at the age of 18 , Franz Hipper became an officer of the Imperial German Navy . Among the fellow cadets of the 1881 class was Wilhelm Souchon , who went on to command the Mediterranean Division at the outbreak of World War I.

 After Hipper joined the German Navy in 1881 as a probationary sea cadet , he served on the sail @-@ frigate SMS Niobe from April to September 1881 . He was then transferred to the Naval Cadet School in Kiel , which he attended from September 1881 to March 1882 . Upon graduation , he attended the 6 @-@ week Basic Gunnery School on the training ship Mars , from April to May 1882 . Following gunnery training , Hipper was assigned to the training ship Friedrich Carl for sea training , which lasted from May to September 1882 . He was then transferred to the steam corvette Leipzig for a world cruise ; this was begun on October 1882 and completed two years later in October 1884 . Upon reaching Germany , Hipper returned to Kiel to attend Naval Officer School from November 1884 to April 1885 . On 24 April , Hipper was assigned as a divisional drill officer ; he was tasked with training recruits for the First Naval Battalion , based in Kiel . Hipper held this position for seven months . 
 In October 1885 , Hipper went through the Executive Officer School in Kiel , which he completed on 16 December . On 4 January 1886 , Hipper was assigned as a division officer for the Second Seaman 's Artillery Division , Coastal Defense Artillery . He remained in this post until 3 March 1887 , at which point he was assigned as the watch officer aboard Friedrich Carl . This began a three and a half year stint serving as watch officer aboard several ships , including the corvettes Stosch and Stein , the armored frigate Friedrich der Grosse , and the aviso Wacht . Hipper attended the Torpedo Officer Course aboard the corvette Blücher from October 1890 to January 1891 . He was then designated as a torpedo specialist ; he returned to Friedrich der Grosse as a torpedo officer in October 1891 . In April 1892 , he went to join the crew of the newly commissioned coastal defense ship Beowulf , again as a torpedo officer . He served in this position only briefly , before being reassigned as the company commander of the Second Torpedo Unit , based in Wilhelmshaven , in October 1892 . Hipper then took part in torpedo boat instruction from January to February 1893 . 
 In 1894 – 95 , Hipper served as the senior watch officer aboard the new battleship Wörth , under the command of Prince Heinrich . While aboard Wörth , Hipper was promoted to Senior Lieutenant and awarded the Bavarian National Defense Service Medal on 29 August 1895 . In September 1895 , Hipper was assigned as the commanding officer of the Second Torpedo @-@ boat Reserve Division . He held this position for 21 months , during which time he alternated command of four vessels of the active and reserve units in his division . In June 1897 , Hipper participated in a 17 @-@ day Admiralty staff cruise aboard the aviso Grille . After returning from the staff cruise , Hipper was promoted to serve as the commander of the Second Reserve Torpedo @-@ boat Flotilla , a position in which he served for 15 months . 
 Hipper was transferred to the battleship Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm on 1 October 1898 , where he served as navigator . Hipper served for 11 months as navigator aboard the battleship before he was transferred to the Imperial yacht <unk> Hohenzollern on 19 September 1899 . While serving on the Imperial yacht , Hipper was present for the trip to England for Queen Victoria 's funeral in 1901 and the cruise to America the following year . Hipper was awarded a number of medals during his service aboard Hohenzollern , including the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle , the Bavarian Military Service Order , and the Order of St. Stanislaus — awarded by the Tsar Nicholas II of Russia . Hipper was promoted to the rank of Korvettenkapitän ( corvette captain ) on 10 June 1901 . 
 After leaving the Imperial yacht , Hipper was assigned to command of the Second Torpedo Unit on 1 October 1902 . He held the command until 30 September 1905 . His flagship for the first six months of his command was the new cruiser Niobe ; he then transferred his flag to the large torpedo boat D8 . While in this command , Hipper was awarded additional commendations , including the Prussian Distinguished Service Cross and the Prussian Royal Crown Order . He was promoted to the rank of Fregattenkapitän ( frigate captain ) on 5 April . In January 1906 , Hipper attended the 10 @-@ day Cruiser Gunnery School on the new armored cruiser Prinz Adalbert . In April 1906 , he participated in the Battleship Gunnery Course conducted aboard the battleship Schwaben . On 20 April , Hipper was given command of the light cruiser Leipzig , though his tenure as commander was short @-@ lived . Leipzig departed for the East Asia Squadron in September 1906 , at which point Hipper was transferred to command the new armored cruiser Friedrich Carl . Hipper assumed command of the ship on 30 September . Under Hipper 's leadership , the crew of Friedrich Carl won the Kaiser 's Prize for the best shooting in the fleet in 1907 . Admiral Hugo von Pohl stated in a subsequent report : 
 " He has brought the ship to a higher degree of combat effectiveness , and the ship has won the Kaiser Prize for good shooting . One of the best captains we have in the cruisers . A good example for his officers . Recommended for battleship command and for higher independent commands . " 
 On 6 April 1907 , Hipper was promoted to Kapitän zur See ( captain at sea ) . Nicholas II awarded Hipper another commendation , the Order of St. Andrew , that year during a meeting with Wilhelm II . During the ceremony , Hipper joined Wilhelm II as one of his " Imperial Captains . " On 6 March 1908 , Hipper took command of the new cruiser Gneisenau . He was tasked with conducting the shakedown cruise , after which the ship departed for the East Asia Squadron . Hipper again remained in Germany ; he was given command of the First Torpedo boat Division , based in Kiel . Here he was responsible for training more than half of the torpedo boats in the entire German navy . Hipper held the position for three years , until he returned to fleet service . 
 On 1 October 1911 , Hipper took command of the armored cruiser Yorck , along with the position as chief of staff for Rear Admiral Gustav von Bachmann , the Deputy Flag Officer , Reconnaissance Forces . In January 1912 , Rear Admiral von Bachmann was promoted out of his position ; on the 26th Hipper succeeded him as the deputy commander . The following day , he was promoted to Rear Admiral . After serving as the deputy commander for over a year and a half , Hipper again followed Admiral von Bachmann . Admiral von Bachmann was promoted to Chief of the Baltic Station and Hipper took over as the commanding officer of the I Scouting Group on 1 October 1913 . Erich Raeder was appointed as Hipper 's deputy . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 After World War I broke out in 1914 Hipper led his battlecruisers on several raids against the English coastal towns . The first such raid occurred on 2 November 1914 . Hipper 's force included the battlecruisers Moltke , Von der Tann , and Seydlitz , his flagship , and the large armored cruiser Blücher , along with four light cruisers . The flotilla arrived off Great Yarmouth at daybreak the following morning and bombarded the port , while the light cruiser Stralsund laid a minefield . The British submarine HMS D5 responded to the bombardment , but struck one of the mines laid by Stralsund and sank . Shortly thereafter , Hipper ordered his ships to turn back to German waters . On the way , a heavy fog covered the Heligoland Bight , so the ships were ordered to halt until visibility improved and they could safely navigate the defensive minefields . The armored cruiser Yorck made a navigational error that led her into one of the German minefields . She struck two mines and quickly sank ; only 127 men out of the crew of 629 were rescued . 
 A second operation followed on 15 – 16 December 1914 ; it targeted the towns of Scarborough , Hartlepool , and Whitby . By this time Hipper 's squadron had been augmented by the new battlecruiser Derfflinger . Twelve hours after Hipper left the Jade , the High Seas Fleet , consisting of 14 dreadnoughts and 8 pre @-@ dreadnoughts and a screening force of 2 armored cruisers , 7 light cruisers , and 54 torpedo boats , departed to provide distant cover for the bombardment force . The Royal Navy had the capability to intercept and decode the German naval code , as a result of the capture of the light cruiser Magdeburg at the outbreak of the war . On 14 December , the British intercepted messages relating to the plan to bombard Scarborough . Vice Admiral Beatty 's four battlecruisers , supported by six dreadnoughts and several cruisers and smaller vessels , were to ambush Hipper 's battlecruisers . 
 The evening of the 15th , the main German fleet encountered the six British battleships ; Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl , convinced he was faced by the entire British fleet , turned in retreat . Hipper was unaware of his superior 's decision , and so pressed on with the bombardment . The three towns were shelled briefly before Hipper turned back to the planned rendezvous point . By this time , Beatty 's battlecruisers were in position to block Hipper 's chosen egress route , while other forces were en route to complete the encirclement . Errors in signaling aboard the British ships and bad weather , however , allowed Hipper to escape the trap without incident . As a result of the civilian casualties inflicted in these raids , the British propaganda effort vilified Hipper as a " baby killer . " 
 = = = = Battle of Dogger Bank = = = = 
 In early January 1915 , it became known to the German naval command that British ships were conducting reconnaissance in the Dogger Bank area . Admiral von Ingenohl was initially reluctant to attempt to destroy these forces , because the I Scouting Group was temporarily weakened while Von der Tann was in drydock for periodic maintenance . Rear Admiral ( German : Konteradmiral ) Richard Eckermann , the Chief of Staff of the High Seas Fleet , insisted on the operation , and so Ingenohl relented and ordered Hipper to take his battlecruisers to the Dogger Bank . On 23 January , Hipper sortied , with Seydlitz in the lead , followed by Moltke , Derfflinger , and Blücher , along with four light cruisers and 19 torpedo boats . 
 Again , interception and decryption of German wireless signals played an important role . Although they were unaware of the exact plans , the cryptographers of Room 40 were able to deduce that Hipper would be conducting an operation in the Dogger Bank area . Vice Admiral Beatty was again tasked with intercepting and destroying Hipper 's battlecruisers . At 08 : 14 on 24 January , the German cruiser Kolberg spotted the light cruiser Aurora and several destroyers from the Harwich Force , which had been attached to support Beatty 's battlecruiser squadron . Hipper immediately turned his battlecruisers towards the gunfire , when , almost simultaneously , Stralsund spotted a large amount of smoke to the northwest of her position . This was identified as a number of large British warships steaming towards Hipper 's ships . Hipper later remarked : 
 " The presence of such a large force indicated the proximity of further sections of the British Fleet , especially as wireless intercepts revealed the approach of 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron ... They were also reported by Blücher at the rear of the German line , which had opened fire on a light cruiser and several destroyers coming up from astern ... The battlecruisers under my command found themselves , in view of the prevailing [ East @-@ North @-@ East ] wind , in the windward position and so in an unfavourable situation from the outset . " 
 Hipper turned south to flee , but was limited to 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) , which was Blücher 's maximum speed at the time . The pursuing British battlecruisers were steaming at 27 knots ( 50 km / h ; 31 mph ) , and quickly caught up to the German ships . As the rearmost ship in the German line , Blücher suffered the majority of the British gunfire for the early portion of the battle . 
 Seydlitz was struck in her forecastle at 10 : 25 , by a 13 @.@ 5 in shell from Lion , but this hit did minor damage . At 10 : 40 , Lion hit Seydlitz with a single 13 @.@ 5 in ( 343 mm ) shell , which holed the deck and penetrated the rear barbette . The shell itself failed to enter the barbette , but the explosion flashed into the working chamber and detonated the propellant charges inside . By this time , Blücher was severely damaged after having been pounded by heavy shells . The chase ended when there were several reports of U @-@ boats ahead of the British ships ; Beatty quickly ordered evasive maneuvers , which allowed the German ships to increase the distance to their pursuers . At this time , Lion 's last operational dynamo failed , which dropped her speed to 15 knots ( 28 km / h ) . Beatty , in the stricken Lion , ordered the remaining battlecruisers to " Engage the enemy 's rear , " but signal confusion caused the ships to solely target Blücher , allowing Moltke , Seydlitz , and Derfflinger to escape . 
 Blame for the loss of Blücher was not placed on Hipper , but on his superior Admiral von Ingenohl , who was removed from his post on 4 February . Also on the 4th , Hipper met with the Kaiser on an inspection of the fleet in Wilhelmshaven . That same day , Hipper was awarded the Iron Cross by the Kaiser ; on the 23rd he was presented with the Friedrich August Cross , First and Second Classes , by the Grand Duke of Oldenburg . Three days later , Hipper was informed that his hometown had named its main street <unk> ( Hipper Street ) . 
 By March 1916 , Hipper suffered from severe combat fatigue ; he had held command of the fleet reconnaissance forces for some 20 months , and the strain of command was beginning to take its toll . He requested sick leave on 20 March , which was approved by Admiral Reinhard Scheer — who had replaced von Pohl as fleet commander in January 1916 — a week later on the 27th . Scheer , however , attempted to have Hipper retired instead of returning after the termination of sick leave ; he contacted Henning von Holtzendorff , the Chief of the Admiralty Staff , who disagreed with Scheer . Holtzendorff thought that relieving Hipper at that point would " only damage the war leadership . " Hipper had meanwhile left for a spa in Bad <unk> , where he spent five weeks . His deputy , Friedrich Boedicker , assumed temporary command . Hipper returned to his post on 12 May 1916 ; he hoisted his flag aboard the newly commissioned battlecruiser Lützow . 
 = = = = Battle of Jutland = = = = 
 Admiral Scheer planned another operation to lure out a portion of the British fleet for 17 May , but damage to the battlecruiser SMS Seydlitz sustained during the bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft the previous month , coupled with condenser trouble on several of the battleships of III Battle Squadron caused the plan to be delayed , ultimately to 31 May . That morning , at 02 : 00 CET , the I Scouting Group , which comprised the battlecruisers Lützow , Derfflinger , Seydlitz , Moltke , and Von der Tann , five light cruisers , and 30 torpedo boats , left the Jade estuary . Scheer and the battle fleet followed an hour and a half later . The British navy 's Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation , and so sortied the Grand Fleet , totaling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers the night before , in order to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet . 
 At 16 : 00 , the British and German battlecruiser forces encountered each other and began a running gun fight south , back towards Scheer 's battle fleet . During this portion of the battle , Hipper 's ships destroyed the battlecruisers Indefatigable and Queen Mary . Upon reaching the High Seas Fleet , Vice Admiral David Beatty 's battlecruisers turned back to the north to lure the Germans towards the rapidly approaching Grand Fleet , under the command of Admiral John Jellicoe . During the run to the north , Hipper 's ships continued to engage both Beatty 's battlecruisers and the Queen Elizabeth @-@ class battleships of the 5th Battle Squadron . 
 At 19 : 24 , the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron had formed up with Beatty 's remaining battlecruisers ahead of the German line . The leading British ships spotted Lützow and Derfflinger , and began firing on them . In the span of 8 minutes , the battlecruiser Invincible scored eight hits on Lützow ; these hits were mainly concentrated in the ship 's bow and were the primary cause of the flooding that would eventually cause her loss . In return , both Lützow and Derfflinger concentrated their fire on Invincible , and at 19 : 33 , Lützow 's third salvo penetrated Invincible 's center turret and ignited the magazine ; the ship disappeared in a series of massive explosions . 
 By 19 : 30 , the Grand Fleet had arrived on the scene , and was deployed into a position that would cross Scheer 's " T " from the northeast . To extricate his fleet from this precarious position , Scheer ordered a 16 @-@ point turn to the south @-@ west . Lützow had lost speed and was unable to keep up , and so Hipper ordered his flagship to withdraw to the southwest . Shortly before 20 : 00 , Kommodore Michelson , aboard the cruiser Rostock , dispatched the torpedo boats of I Half @-@ Flotilla to assist Lützow . G39 came alongside and took Hipper and his staff aboard , in order to transfer him to one of the other battlecruisers . At 19 : 55 , Scheer decided to conduct another 16 @-@ point turn to launch an attack on the British fleet . This maneuver again put Scheer in a dangerous position ; Jellicoe had turned his fleet south and again crossed Scheer 's " T. " A third 16 @-@ point turn followed , which was covered by a charge by Hipper 's mauled battlecruisers — though as he was in the process of transferring from Lützow to G39 , command of the squadron had temporarily fallen to Captain Hartog aboard Derfflinger . Hipper remarked , 
 " I had to find myself another flagship because I could no longer exercise command from one which was shot to pieces ... A torpedo boat was called alongside and we changed under heavy fire ... [ I ] drove my <unk> hoping to find an advantageous moment to board one of [ the other battlecruisers ] . These 1 ½ hours that I spent in a hail of shell and splinters aboard the <unk> I shall not be likely to forget . " 
 By 22 : 15 , Hipper was finally able to transfer to Moltke ; he then ordered his ships to steam at 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) to take up their station the head of the German line . Only Moltke and Seydlitz , however , were in condition to comply ; Derfflinger and Von der Tann could make at most 18 knots , and so these ships lagged behind . An attack by British light cruisers caused the German formation to fall into disarray . In the confusion , Seydlitz lost sight of Moltke , and was no longer able to keep up with Moltke 's 22 knots ( 41 km / h ; 25 mph ) ; Seydlitz detached herself to proceed to the Horns Reef lighthouse independently . Hipper 's ships were to see no further combat during the return to German waters ; at 03 : 55 Hipper reported to Scheer that Derfflinger and Von der Tann both had only two guns in operation , and that Seydlitz had been heavily damaged . Scheer replied that Hipper was to return to Wilhelmshaven while the fleet stood off Horns Reef . 
 For his conduct in the battle , Hipper received Germany 's highest military honor , the Pour le Mérite ; it was awarded by the Kaiser on 5 June . He was also awarded the Royal Bavarian Military Order of Max Joseph , Commander 's Cross . This award carried with it elevation to the nobility and the title Ritter . He was presented with several other awards , including the Royal Saxon Order , the Order of Albrecht , and all three Hanseatic Crosses from Lübeck , Bremen , and Hamburg . 
 = = = = Command of the High Seas Fleet = = = = 
 The remainder of 1916 and through 1917 was largely uneventful for Hipper . He was placed in command of a detachment of the High Seas Fleet , composed of two battlecruisers , eleven battleships , four light cruisers , and twelve torpedo boats , sent to Denmark to retrieve a pair of stranded U @-@ boats in November 1916 . One was successfully returned to Germany , but the other had to be destroyed to prevent its capture . On the return to Germany , Kronprinz and Grosser Kurfürst were torpedoed by a British submarine . A year later , a brief skirmish took place in the Helgoland Bight between British and German capital ships . 
 On 12 August 1918 , Hipper was promoted to command of the High Seas Fleet , after Scheer had been promoted to the Chief of Naval Staff . He was concurrently promoted to Admiral ; Hipper took provisional control of the fleet in a ceremony held on the old battleship Kaiser Wilhelm II the day before . However , the war was all but lost by the time Hipper took command of the fleet . 
 In October , Hipper and Scheer envisioned one last major fleet advance to attack the British Grand Fleet . Scheer intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy , to achieve a better bargaining position for Germany regardless of the cost to the navy . During the planning stages , Hipper wrote " As to a battle for the honor of the fleet in this war , even if it were a death battle , it would be the foundation for a new German fleet ... such a fleet would be out of the question in the event of a dishonorable peace . " The plan involved two simultaneous attacks by light cruisers and destroyers , one on Flanders and another on shipping in the Thames estuary ; the five battlecruisers were to support the Thames attack while the dreadnoughts remained off Flanders . After both strikes , the fleet was to concentrate off the Dutch coast , where it would meet the Grand Fleet in battle . 
 While the fleet was consolidating in Wilhelmshaven , however , war @-@ weary sailors began deserting en masse . As Von der Tann and Derfflinger passed through the locks that separated Wilhelmshaven 's inner harbor and roadstead , some 300 men from both ships climbed over the side and disappeared ashore . On 24 October 1918 , the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven . Starting on the night of 29 October , sailors on several battleships mutinied ; three ships from the III Squadron refused to weigh anchors , and acts of sabotage were committed on board the battleships Thüringen and Helgoland . In the face of open rebellion , the order to sail was rescinded and the planned operation was abandoned . In an attempt to suppress the mutiny , the High Seas Fleet squadrons were dispersed . The situation had declined so significantly that on 9 November , Hipper personally took down his flag from the battleship Baden and went ashore . 
 According to the terms of the Armistice , all five of Germany 's battlecruisers and two of the three battle squadrons , along with a number of light cruisers and the most modern torpedo boats , were to be interned in Scapa Flow . The fleet was placed under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter and sent to meet the Allied fleet of some 370 vessels . Hipper watched from shore as the German fleet left for Scapa Flow on 21 November 1918 . He later wrote , 
 My heart is breaking with this ; my time as fleet commander has come to an inglorious end . The remaining questions of demobilization , disarmament , and the negotiations with the soldiers councils can be handled by my chief of staff ; I have nothing more to do . I shall remain pro forma in command for a short time , otherwise , I am dead tired . 
 Less than two weeks later , on 2 December , Admiral Hipper submitted his request to be placed on the inactive list . He retired on 13 December with a full pension ; at the age of 55 , Hipper spent almost 37 years on active duty in the Imperial Navy . The German fleet in Scapa Flow , meanwhile , was scuttled by its crew on 21 June 1919 . 
 = = Post @-@ war life = = 
 Following the German defeat in World War I , Hipper retired on 13 December 1918 from the navy and lived a quiet life ; he received a full war pension . During the chaos of the German Revolution of 1918 – 1919 , Hipper hid from radical revolutionaries by assuming a false name and moving frequently . He wrote a letter to Adolf von Trotha , the new fleet commander , expressing his approval of the scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow on 21 June 1919 . After the revolution was over , Hipper moved to a house in Altona near Hamburg . 
 Unlike his superior , Reinhard Scheer , Hipper never wrote a memoir of the war or his participation in the Imperial Navy . He briefly dabbled in conservative political movements in the 1920s but never committed to any . Franz von Hipper died on 25 May 1932 ; he was cremated and was buried in his hometown of Weilheim , according to his wishes . On hearing of Hipper 's death , his old adversary David Beatty said , " I am very sorry . One would like to express one 's regrets for the passing of a gallant officer and a great sailor . " In 1938 , the German navy , which had been expanded by the Nazi party , launched the new heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper in commemoration of its namesake .

 = = Early life = = 
 Born in New York City on June 23 , 1964 as <unk> Hill Whedon , and being a third @-@ generation TV writer , he is the son of Tom Whedon , a screenwriter for Alice in the 1970s and The Golden Girls in the 1980s , and the grandson of John Whedon , who worked on The Donna Reed Show in the 1950s and The Dick Van Dyke Show in the 1960s . His mother , Ann Lee ( née Jeffries ) Stearns , originally from Kentucky , was a teacher at Riverdale Country School as Lee Whedon , and an aspiring novelist . His parents had both acted , and appeared in a play together at the Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club . Whedon is the younger sibling of Samuel and Matthew Whedon and older sibling of writers Jed and Zack Whedon . At a young age , he showed great interest in British television with shows like Masterpiece and Monty Python . 
 Whedon attended Riverdale Country School in New York City where his mother taught history . He then spent three years at Winchester College in England , where , taking note of omnipresent bullying , he concluded , " it was clear to me from the start that I must take an active role in my survival " . Whedon graduated from Wesleyan University in 1987 , where he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters in 2013 . There , he also studied under renowned academic Richard <unk> . After leaving Wesleyan , Whedon came up with the first incarnation of Buffy Summers , " Rhonda , the Immortal Waitress " .

 From 1989 to 1990 , Whedon worked as a staff writer on the sitcoms Roseanne and Parenthood . As a script doctor , Whedon was an uncredited writer on films like The Getaway , Speed , Waterworld , Twister and X @-@ Men . X @-@ Men reportedly contained only two dialogue exchanges of Whedon 's contribution , but the final cut of Speed left in most of his dialogue . At the same time as script consulting , he wrote Buffy the Vampire Slayer — the film that would precede the series — Alien : Resurrection and an early draft for Atlantis : The Lost Empire and co @-@ wrote Toy Story and Titan A.E. , the former of which earned him a shared Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay . Whedon has expressed strong dissatisfaction with the released versions of the films Buffy the Vampire Slayer , Titan A.E. and Alien : Resurrection . 
 = = = = Buffy the Vampire Slayer = = = = 
 In 1997 , Whedon created his first TV show , Buffy the Vampire <unk> The series depicts Buffy Summers , the latest in a line of young women called to battle against vampires , demons , and other forces of darkness . The idea came directly from his aversion to seeing the Hollywood formula of " the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror movie " . Whedon said he wanted to subvert the idea and create someone who was a hero . This conception came from " the very first mission statement of the show , which was the joy of female power : having it , using it , sharing it " . The writing process came together from conversations about the emotional issues facing Buffy Summers , and how she would confront them in her battle against supernatural forces . Whedon usually directed episodes from his own scripts that held the most cathartic moments in Buffy 's story . 
 The series received numerous awards and nominations , including an Emmy Award nomination for the 1999 episode " Hush " . The 2001 episode " The Body " was nominated for a Nebula Award in 2002 , and the fall 2001 musical episode " Once More , with Feeling " was nominated for a Best Dramatic Presentation Hugo Award and a Best Script Nebula Award . The final episode " Chosen " was nominated for a Best Dramatic Presentation , Short Form Hugo Award in 2003 . All written and directed by Whedon , they are considered some the most effective and popular episodes of the series . 
 Buffy the Vampire Slayer was lauded worldwide for its influential themes and impact on popular culture . Scholar A. Asbjørn Jøn recognized that the series has shifted the way vampires have since been depicted in popular culture representations . Since the end of the series , Whedon has stated that his initial intention was to produce a " cult " television series and acknowledged a corresponding “ rabid , almost insane fan base " that subsequently emerged . In June 2012 , Slate magazine identified it as the most written about popular culture text of all time . " [ M ] ore than twice as many papers , essays , and books have been devoted to the vampire drama than any of our other choices — so many that we stopped counting when we hit 200 " . 
 A lifelong comic book fan , Whedon authored the Dark Horse Comics miniseries Fray , which takes place in the far future of the Buffyverse . Like many writers of the show , he contributed to the series ' comic book continuation , writing for the anthology Tales of the Slayers , and the main storyline of the miniseries Tales of the Vampires . Whedon and the other writers then released a new ongoing series , taking place after the series finale " Chosen " , which he officially recognizes as the canonical eighth season . Whedon returned to the world of Fray during the season eight story arc " Time of Your Life " . Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine was published from August 2011 to September 2013 , for which Whedon wrote " Freefall , Part I – II " ( with Andrew Chambliss ) .

 As a result of Buffy the Vampire Slayer 's success , Whedon was allowed the opportunity to make his 1999 spin @-@ off series , Angel . David Greenwalt and Whedon collaborated on the pilot that was going to be developed for The WB Network . During the series ' early expansion , efforts were made by the network to mitigate Whedon 's original concept . " Corrupt " , a precociously optioned second episode , was entirely abandoned due to the gloominess written into the script . The tone was consequently softened , establishing in the opening episodes Angel Investigations as an idealistic , shoestring operation . It follows Angel , who works as a private detective in order to " help the helpless " . 
 Though praised for presenting a unique and progressive version of the archetypal noir hero as a sympathetic vampire detective , it was criticized as being lesser than its parent show , in context of having been derived from a more popular original work . Despite this , it won a Saturn Award for Best Network TV Series and the three episodes " Waiting in the Wings " , " Smile Time " and " Not Fade Away " were nominated for Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation , Short Form in 2003 and 2005 . 
 The WB Network announced on February 13 , 2004 that Angel would not be brought back for a sixth season . Whedon said of the cancellation , " I believe the reason Angel had trouble on The WB was that it was the only show on the network that wasn 't trying to be Buffy . It was a show about grown @-@ ups " . An official continuation of the story came rather in the form of a comic book series . Following Buffy the Vampire Slayer 's successful eighth season , IDW Publishing approached Whedon about similarly producing a canonical sixth season for Angel . Angel : After the Fall released 17 issues written by Whedon and Brian Lynch .

 Whedon followed Angel with the space western Firefly , starring Nathan Fillion , Gina Torres , Alan Tudyk , Morena Baccarin , Adam Baldwin , Jewel Staite , Sean Maher , Summer Glau and Ron Glass . Set in the year 2517 , Firefly explores the lives of the people who , on the outskirts of society , make their living as the crew of Serenity , a " Firefly @-@ class " spaceship . The series ' original concept progressed after Whedon read The Killer Angels , a book on the Battle of Gettysburg , and watched Outlaw Star , a space @-@ western anime that first aired in 1998 . 
 An ever present element was Whedon 's injection of anti @-@ totalitarianism , writing into the show a historical analogy of the Battle of Gettysburg , the " Battle of Serenity Valley " .3 The beaten soldiers were called " Browncoats " after the brown dusters they wore as their uniforms . Whedon said , " I wanted to play with that classic notion of the frontier : not the people who made history , but the people history stepped on — the people for whom every act is the creation of civilization " . Firefly was written as a serious character study , encompassing what Whedon called " life when it 's hard " , and in elaboration was about " nine people looking into the blackness of space and seeing nine different things " . 
 The fusion of American frontier and outer space motifs was not well received by critics , and despite critical praise in other respects , the show had an average of 4 @.@ 7 million viewers at the time and was ranked 98th in Nielsen ratings , which led to the series ' cancelation by Fox . Whedon took to Universal Pictures as a means of achieving a continuation of the story . Following Firefly was Serenity , a follow @-@ up film taking place after the events of the final episode . This developed into a franchise that led to graphic novels , books and other media . New Scientist magazine held a poll in 2005 to find " The World 's Best Space Sci @-@ Fi Ever " , in which Firefly and Serenity took first and second place , respectively . Since its cancellation , the series has attained cult status . 
 = = = = Marvel Comics = = = = 
 In 2004 , Whedon created the comic book line Astonishing X @-@ Men . He finished his 24 issue run in 2008 and then handed over the writing reins to Warren Ellis . One storyline from this comic , the notion of a cure for mutation being found , was also an element in the third X @-@ Men film , X @-@ Men : The Last Stand . In February 2009 , Astonishing X @-@ Men # 6 , which depicted the return of Colossus to the title , and concluded Whedon 's first story arc , was named by readers as # 65 in Marvel 's Top 70 Comics of all time . 
 Taking over after series creator Brian K. Vaughan completed his run , Whedon became the second writer of the Marvel comic Runaways . Having already been a committed reader , he had a letter published in the first volume , which was included in the Volume 1 hardcover edition . He also wrote short pieces for Stan Lee Meets Spider @-@ Man and Giant @-@ Size Astonishing X @-@ Men # 1 , and was the subject of an issue of Marvel Spotlight ( alongside artist Michael Lark ) . As part of a panel of writers , he contributed to Marvel Comics ' Civil War crossover event , lending advice in how to tell the story and how to end it . Whedon introduced several new characters into the Marvel Universe such as the villainous Ord , X @-@ Men Ruth " Blindfold " Aldine and Hisako " Armor " Ichiki , Runaway Klara <unk> , and Special Agent Abigail Brand along with <unk> , the organization she commands . 
 = = = = Serenity = = = = 
 After Universal Pictures acquired the film and distribution rights from Fox , Whedon started writing the screenplay for Serenity . Transforming the series into a film , he says , " ... was the hardest piece of writing I 've ever done ... It had to be self @-@ contained and work as a movie , which meant I had to cope with problems like introducing nine main characters who 'd already met ! " The script was based on unused story ideas for Firefly 's unfilmed second season . On writing the dialogue , Whedon felt that part of it came from " getting to invent the language " , which " once I had ... reads like a kind of poetry " . The narrative centers on Captain Malcolm Reynolds as the hero accompanied by River Tam acting as the catalyst for what he does . 
 The score was composed by David Newman , and according to Whedon was intended to " <unk> space — to feel the intimacy of being on a ship as opposed to the grandeur " . He used two long steadicam shots for several minutes of the film 's opening sequence to establish " a sense of safety in space " . In 2006 , it won a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation , Long Form . The elements of science fiction that Whedon wanted to convey were essentially different in kind , and held " a sort of grittiness " and " realism " , which he said , together , " get the most exciting kind of film @-@ making " . Like Firefly , the film contained a statement on individual liberty . Critic Roger Ebert observed , " Like Brave New World and 1984 , the movie plays like a critique of contemporary society , with the Alliance as Big Brother , enemy of discontent " . The film received the 2005 Nebula Award for Best Script , the 2006 Prometheus Special Award , and was voted the best sci @-@ fi movie of all time in a poll set up by SFX magazine . There have since been multiple rumors regarding sequel possibilities . 
 The limited three @-@ issue comic book series called Serenity : Those Left Behind , the story of which was written by Whedon , was released in 2005 as a tie @-@ in to Serenity . Set between Firefly and the film , it was intended to bridge the two storylines together . Serenity : Better Days also spanned three issues , and was written by Whedon and Brett Matthews . Whedon later co @-@ wrote The Shepherd 's Tale with his half brother Zack .

 As a guest director , he contributed two 2007 episodes of The Office ( " Business School " and " Branch Wars " ) and a 2010 episode of Glee ( " Dream On " ) . <unk> this period , Whedon has said , " I had free time , but I 'm pretty sure I mean my career was on the skids " . 
 In collaboration with Fábio Moon , Whedon created the free webcomic titled Sugarshock ! , as part of the revival of Dark Horse Presents , which was launched on Myspace . Whedon later executive produced another free comic book on the Internet , Serenity : The Other Half . 
 = = = = Dr. Horrible 's Sing @-@ Along Blog = = = = 
 As a response to the 2007 – 08 Writers Guild of America strike , Whedon directed , co @-@ wrote and produced Dr. Horrible 's Sing @-@ Along Blog . It tells the story of Dr. Horrible , an aspiring supervillain , who shares a love interest in a girl named Penny with his nemesis , Captain Hammer . To Whedon the miniseries was " a project of love " , an accomplishment that from their excitement would be embellished with passion and " ridiculousness " . His half brothers Zack and Jed and sister @-@ in @-@ law Maurissa Tancharoen share the other writing credits . Whedon said it was a " glorious surprise " to him to discover how well they worked together . 
 After having attended meetings with companies discussing the prospect of producing something for the Internet , and faced with negative feedback on his ideas , he realized that as long as the strike was still in progress , acquiring corporate funding was an unlikely prospect . Whedon funded the project himself with the investment of just over $ 200 @,@ 000 , and earned more from it than he did directing The Avengers . He enjoyed the independence gained from it , as it provided him the freedom to include content without the expectancy of lessening it on behalf of the runtime . He and Jed composed the music , parts of which were influenced by Stephen Sondheim . Whedon was awarded Best Directing and Best Writing for a Comedy Web Series at the Streamy Awards , a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation , Short Form , and a Creative Arts Emmy Award in 2009 . 
 = = = = Dollhouse = = = = 
 In 2009 , Whedon created his fourth television series Dollhouse , and explored themes throughout the show that were initially present in an unproduced spec script of his called Afterlife . The series follows Echo , whose brain is programmed to accomplish various assignments , on her journey towards self @-@ awareness . As stated by Whedon , Dollhouse was about " the sides of us that we don 't want people to see " , sexuality and , on some level , a celebration of perversion , which he equates to obsession , " the thing that makes people passionate and interesting and worthy " . 
 Despite low ratings in its first season , the series was renewed for a second and final season . The reason for the renewal given by Fox 's president of entertainment was to avoid any backlash that would have resulted from its cancelation . In reflection of Fox 's disruptive involvement , Whedon lamented the loss of ideas of identity and moral culpability , stating that they were dancing around them in the process which then devolved it into a procedural . 
 = = = 2010s = = = 
 = = = = The Cabin in the Woods = = = = 
 Whedon co @-@ wrote and produced a horror @-@ comedy film titled The Cabin in the Woods with director Drew Goddard , which finished production in 2009 . Whedon and Goddard both intended to make a film that concerned horror movies while still preserving the fun and frightening elements necessary to itself be a horror film . The script was written in three days , producing a minimum of 15 pages a day . Whedon described it as an attempt to revitalize horror , calling it a " loving hate letter " to the genre , continuing : 
 On another level it 's a serious critique of what we love and what we don 't about horror movies . I love being scared . I love that mixture of thrill , of horror , that objectification / identification thing of wanting definitely for the people to be alright but at the same time hoping they 'll go somewhere dark and face something awful . The things that I don 't like are kids acting like idiots , the devolution of the horror movie into torture porn and into a long series of sadistic <unk> . Drew and I both felt that the pendulum had swung a little too far in that direction . 
 Part of what Whedon thought distinguished it from other horror films was that people were not expendable — " As a culture , for our own entertainment , we tend to assume that they are " . He reiterated his sentiment that the introduction of torture porn into this genre was becoming an exercise in nihilism and misogyny as a means to promote distress instead of trying to scare you . 
 = = = = Marvel Studios = = = = 
 In July 2010 , it was confirmed that Whedon would write and direct The Avengers , a live @-@ action adaptation of the superhero team of the same name . On his desire to take on the film , he explained that the core of the movie was about " finding yourself from community " and the togetherness derived from a group that ultimately doesn 't belong together . 
 It became the fourth @-@ highest @-@ grossing film of all time at the North American box office , and received considerable praise from critics . In retrospect , Whedon thought the film had " imperfections " , begrudging its quality in comparison to that of The Matrix and The Godfather Part II . Nonetheless , he felt he " pulled off " the endeavor of making a summer movie reminiscent of those from his childhood . 
 In March 2012 , Whedon stated that although television involves more compromise than film : 
 I think , ultimately , gun to my head , TV is the place . Being able to spend years with a character , to really develop them , to understand them , to challenge the actor , to learn from the actor , to work with a team of writers – that experience is so fulfilling . The idea of putting something out there and letting it grow is really exciting . 
 In August 2012 , Whedon signed a deal to develop the Marvel TV show Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. for ABC . The series focuses on the secret military law @-@ enforcement agency featured throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe . Created by Whedon , Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen , the show involves individuals who possess powers within the spectacle of science fiction , while also focusing on " the peripheral people ... the people on the edges of the grand adventures " . The character Phil Coulson was resurrected after his death in The Avengers to helm the show . 
 Whedon spoke about certain complications that factored in with making the show for Marvel , noting confusion between him and the company regarding the degree to which they wanted him to create it , citing their demand that he prioritize Avengers : Age of Ultron . He eventually regretted his decision to bring back Phil Coulson , feeling that his death had lost meaning as a result . 
 Whedon returned to write and direct the sequel to The Avengers , following the deal with Marvel Studios , which expired in June 2015 . On the matter of approaching a sequel , Whedon reasoned not to go " bigger " , but " deeper " , and likened it to digging with a scalpel to cause pain . He said of the film 's characters , " Strong but damaged by power describes every person in this movie . It may , in fact , describe what the movie is about ... the more power that we have , the less human we are " . Whedon discerns that Age of Ultron " is an odd film " that proved challenging when it came to finding the rhythm between both its calm and exciting moments . Drawing parallels to a symphony , he wanted to bring about " grace in the middle of ultimate chaos " . 
 Whedon also served as a creative consultant on the films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe leading up to Age of Ultron . He rewrote some dialogue for Thor : The Dark World , directed the mid @-@ credits scene of Captain America : The Winter Soldier , and suggested that James Gunn make Guardians of the Galaxy " weirder " after reading an early draft . Whedon said it was unlikely that he would return to make another sequel , stating that he " couldn ’ t imagine doing this again " . He remarked that not having created his own fictional universe in over five years felt wrong and intended to use the proceeds made from Avengers : Age of Ultron for such ventures . In January 2016 , Whedon announced that he will no longer work with Marvel .

 To create Much Ado About Nothing , Whedon established Bellwether Pictures . He filmed it in black @-@ and @-@ white on digital video over a period of 12 days at his residence in Santa Monica , California . The film was scripted , produced , directed , edited and composed by Whedon , based on William Shakespeare 's play of the same name . His idea to adapt the play for the screen originated from having " Shakespeare readings " at his house with several of his friends , years prior . Despite the play 's comedy , he discovered that there were elements in the text " of debauchery " that brought out a core darkness , and said the visual nature of film influenced him to permeate a motif of sexuality into the script . 
 = = = = In Your Eyes and Twist = = = = 
 Whedon wrote and executive produced the paranormal romance film In Your Eyes , the second feature by Bellwether Pictures . The film tells the story of Rebecca Porter and Dylan Kershaw who can feel each other 's emotions , but are ultimately strangers . Whedon 's script marked a theme of human connection as the metaphor for the couple 's mysterious link . He conceived the idea in the early 1990s , and had written drafts of the screenplay since then . 
 In summer 2014 , Whedon encountered artist Shawnee Kilgore on Kickstarter . Whedon funded her album and when Kilgore contacted him about his fulfillment reward , he suggested they make a song together . She agreed , and the collaboration was later repurposed into producing an EP . 
 At the 2015 San Diego Comic @-@ Con International , Whedon announced Twist , which was described as a comic book about " a Victorian female Batman " . 
 = = <unk> projects = = 
 Early in his career , Whedon sold two spec scripts that weren 't produced , Suspension and Afterlife . He sold Suspension for $ 750 @,@ 000 , with an additional $ 250 @,@ 000 if production had commenced . In September 2014 , Empire suggested the <unk> was being made , with Liam Neeson attached to the project . In 1994 , he sold Afterlife for $ 1 @.@ 5 million , with an additional $ 500 @,@ 000 if production had commenced . In 2000 , Andy Tennant was in talks to direct and rewrite . In Afterlife there were precursors to themes Whedon would later explore in Dollhouse . The script was about Daniel <unk> , a government scientist , who awakes after dying to discover his mind has been imprinted on a mind @-@ wiped body . 
 Whedon had a number of planned Buffy the Vampire Slayer spinoffs that became stuck in development or terminally stalled . Among these were Buffy the Animated Series , a set of television movies for The WB based on Angel and Buffy characters , and Ripper , a proposed BBC pilot about Rupert Giles . 
 <unk> was announced in 2005 . According to Variety magazine , it was a fantasy thriller under development by Universal Pictures , and was to be produced by Mary Parent and Scott Stuber . From a 2006 interview with Fanboy Radio : " I 've been seeing a lot of horror movies that are torture @-@ porn , where kids we don 't care about are mutilated for hours , and I just cannot abide them ... it 's an antidote to that very kind of film , the horror movie with the expendable human beings in it . Because I don 't believe any human beings are " . 
 Whedon was hired to write and direct a Warner Bros. adaptation of Wonder Woman . However , in February 2007 , Whedon announced that he would no longer be involved with the project . " We just saw different movies , and at the price range this kind of movie hangs in , that 's never gonna work . Non @-@ <unk> . It happens all the time " . Conversely , he stated , " the fact of the matter is , it was a waste of my time . We never [ wanted ] to make the same movie ; none of us knew that " . Whedon also pitched a screenplay to adapt Batman for the same company as development started on what would eventually become Batman Begins . It was described as having included a new , " more of a ' Hannibal Lecter ' type " villain , and portrayed Bruce Wayne as " a morbid , death @-@ obsessed kid " whose grief was overcome by protecting a girl from being bullied in an alley similar to where his parents were murdered . 
 The sequel to Dr. Horrible 's Sing @-@ Along Blog has been shelved on multiple occasions . In 2009 , Whedon remarked upon the possibility of presenting it in the form of another miniseries or a feature film . The script was planned to be written in summer 2012 and the principal photography to take place the following year . However , production was delayed because of his commitment to projects at Marvel Studios . 
 Wastelanders , a web @-@ based " end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ world " project , once in development with author Warren Ellis , was postponed due to Whedon 's preoccupation with The Avengers . 
 = = Themes , style and influences = = 
 Thematically , Whedon 's work features allusions to components in existentialism , anti @-@ authoritarianism , power , powerlessness , sexuality , adulthood , sacrifice , misogyny and feminism . His projects usually revolve around an ensemble of protagonists , primarily focused on a loner hero who ends up working with others to accomplish a goal . He says of the recurring aspects of community , " Everything I write tends to turn into a superhero team , even if I didn 't mean for it to . I always start off wanting to be solitary , because a ) it 's simpler , and b ) that isolation is something that I relate to as a storyteller . And then no matter what , I always end up with a team " . Examining a typical motif , he says , " I tend to write about people who are helpless or out of control who then regain or retake control " . 
 <unk> his approach to screenwriting , Whedon has noted outlining and act structure as the hardest parts of storytelling , but emphasizes that he feels they are " completely essential " . Many of Whedon 's altered phrases and heavily popularized words have entered a common usage called " Slayer Slang " , which PBS included an entire section of in their article series Do You Speak American ? . In an issue of Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight , where Buffy travels to the future , Whedon writes Buffy 's reaction to the future dialect of Manhattan ; this allows Whedon to comment on the series ' distinctive style of dialogue ; " Buffy blames herself for what 's happened to the English language , and there 's a lot of hubris in that joke . I like to think that adding Y 's to words that don 't usually have Y 's is going to destroy the whole fabric of our society " . His use of self @-@ aware dialogue to humanize characters , which relies heavily on dry humor and subtext , treating clichés subversively , using misogyny to define the trait of a villain , and the recurring theme of self @-@ sacrifice led by subverting moral icons have been defining to his style of storytelling . 
 His penchant to kill off characters has been widely criticized . Whedon has admitted extreme tiredness to the criticism , explaining , " The percentage of people who die ... is a lot . I think it 's pretty near everybody . The percentage of people that I kill — not so many . I think the reason that my rep is so nasty is that I tend to do it ... unexpectedly , or to someone people are recently invested in , and that is a real mission statement for me , because , death doesn 't leave a card . Death doesn 't take Hitler . It doesn 't work according to story plans , and when a death feels like a loss , gives you grief ... then you have told a story that involves death " . Dramatic effect is used to convey the sense of realism and shock value that comes from fatal circumstances . 
 Whedon has kept ambivalent on whether to shoot on film or digital video , saying that he has " no allegiance to film as film . If the story is in front of me , I ’ m fine " . In terms of visual aesthetics , he prefers to incorporate as many practical effects as possible when using computer @-@ generated imagery , so people " really don 't know where one begins and the other ends " . On working with high or low budgets , he remarked that both offer " the exact same job " and whether one has $ 100 million or $ 100 @,@ 000 , " you 're trying to hit someone in the gut with an emotional moment " . Whedon determines that , although giving actors notes for guidance , he also aims to assuage their concerns when communicating the reasons and outcomes of a scene . 
 Whedon has cited Ray Bradbury , James Cameron , Rod Serling , William Shakespeare , Stephen Sondheim , Steven Spielberg , Charles Dickens , Stan Lee , Robert Klein , Jerome Robbins , Frank Borzage , Steve Gerber , Steven Bochco , Frances Hodgson Burnett and John Williams as influences . When asked about his five favorite films , Whedon listed The Matrix , Once Upon a Time in the West , The Bad and the Beautiful , Magnolia and The Court Jester . 
 = = Feminism = = 
 Elements of feminism are present throughout all of Whedon 's work , which he gives his mother credit for inspiring . The character Kitty Pryde from the X @-@ Men comics was an early model for Whedon 's strong teenage girl characters . He said , " If there 's a bigger influence on Buffy than Kitty , I don 't know what it was . She was an adolescent girl finding out she has great power and dealing with it " . Kitty Pryde later played a central role in Whedon 's run on Astonishing X @-@ Men . In response to perennially being asked why he writes such strong female characters , he famously replied , " Because you 're still asking me that question " . 
 In college , Whedon studied the theory called " womb envy " , a concept he says observes " a fundamental thing that women have something men don 't , the obvious being an ability to bear children , and the resilience to hang in as parents ... Men not only don 't get what 's important about what women are capable of , but in fact they fear it , and envy it , and want to throw stones at it , because it 's the thing they can 't have " . In 2007 , Whedon expressed his outrage over the murder of Du 'a Khalil Aswad , and because the act was caught on video , was prompted to attack the underlying attitude he felt led to the murder , comparing the video to torture porn . He wrote , " [ Womb envy is ] entirely true . How else to explain the fact that cultures who would die to eradicate each other have always agreed on one issue ? That every popular religion puts restrictions on women 's behavior that are practically untenable ? That the act of being a free , attractive , self @-@ assertive woman is punishable by torture and death ? " 
 In late 2013 , Whedon spoke at an Equality Now event , where he issued a pointed dissection of the word " feminist " . He begins to say , " I have the privilege living my life inside of words ... but part of being a writer is also living in the very smallest part of every word " . Arguing against the suffix " <unk> " , he continues , " you can 't be born an – ist . It 's not natural " . Whedon explains that because of this , the word " includes the idea that believing men and women to be equal ... is not a natural state . That we don 't emerge assuming that everybody in the human race is a human . That the idea of equality is just an idea that 's imposed on us ... " This sparked an unfavorable reaction from the feminist community , but also an appreciation for Whedon 's arguments ' thought provocation . 
 News website Digital Spy released in early 2015 an interview they had conducted with Whedon , during which he criticized the entertainment industry for its " genuine , recalcitrant , intractable sexism , and old @-@ fashioned quiet misogyny " . Whedon exemplified The Hunger Games film series as an argument for the female led franchise , and hoped Marvel Studios would be a part of undertaking the same bearing . 
 = = Frequent casting = = 
 Whedon often hires the same actors for his projects , and has been described as " the gravitational center of the <unk> , a galaxy that spins recurring actors and themes through an orbital system of TV shows , films and comic books that all share similar traits : a unique brand of witty dialogue , relatable characters and fantasy / sci @-@ fi mythology " . 
 Note : Due to the frequency Whedon casts the same actors in various projects , the above list only includes those that have played three or more different roles in a Whedon production ( actors that have only played the same role in multiple Whedon productions are not included ) . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Whedon is married to Kai Cole , who is an architect and the producer and co @-@ founder of Bellwether Pictures . They have two children , Arden and Squire , and live in Los Angeles . 
 In 2013 , Whedon revealed that he suffers from workaholism . This arose during the time that followed the completion of Much Ado About Nothing , which was made in the span of a two @-@ week vacation from The Avengers , and after making the pilot for Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. amidst the pre @-@ production for Avengers : Age of Ultron . " It is actually a problem . Sometimes it 's adorable ... and sometimes it 's not ... Not to get all dark and weird , but it is something I need to address " . 
 = = = Religious and philosophical views = = = 
 Whedon has identified himself as an atheist and absurdist . In a piece by The Onion , he elaborated on the issue . 
 The Onion : Is there a God ? 
 Whedon : No . 
 The Onion : That 's it , end of story , no ? 
 Whedon : Absolutely not . That 's a very important and necessary thing to learn . 
 A committed humanist , Whedon was presented with the Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism by the Humanist <unk> at Harvard University . He has also spoken about existentialism , explaining in detail how it , and more specifically Jean @-@ Paul Sartre 's Nausea , was used as a basis for the Firefly episode " Objects in Space " . He called it " the most important book " he ever read , and said it was handed to him right after he saw Steven Spielberg 's Close Encounters of the Third Kind , whose impact , he recalls , had made him an existentialist . 
 = = = Political views = = = 
 In July 2012 , at the San Diego Comic @-@ Con International , in response to one woman who noted the anti @-@ corporate themes in many of his films , and asked him to give his economic philosophy in 30 seconds or less , Whedon spoke out against both socialism and capitalism , stating that " ultimately all these systems don 't work " . He went on to say that America is " turning into Tsarist Russia " . Endorsing Barack Obama in the 2012 United States presidential election , Whedon satirically equated Mitt Romney 's future as president with a zombie apocalypse , " Romney is ready to make the deep rollbacks in health care , education , social services and reproductive rights that will guarantee poverty , unemployment , overpopulation , disease , rioting — all crucial elements in creating a nightmare zombie wasteland " . 
 In 2015 , Whedon signed a petition as part of a political campaign calling for Elizabeth Warren to run for President of the United States . In observance of Earth Day , he spoke against climate change denial in a series of tweets , arguing , " The climate IS changing — if we can 't , that makes us dumber than weather … Policy makers who deny basic scientific truth should also be denied penicillin , horseless carriages , [ and ] air time on the magic box of shadows " .

 = Type 26 revolver = 
 The Type 26 or Model 26 " hammerless " revolver ( <unk> , <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ shiki <unk> ) was the first modern revolver adopted by the Imperial Japanese Army . It was developed at the Koishikawa Arsenal and is named for its year of adoption in the Japanese dating system ( the 26th year of the reign of the Meiji emperor , i.e. , 1893 ) . The revolver saw action in conflicts including the Russo @-@ Japanese War , World War I and World War II . 
 It is a conglomeration of design features from other revolvers made during the time period . The revolver has a design flaw that allows the cylinder to over @-@ rotate and align the wrong chamber . Five distinct phases of production have different markings depending on the time and individual Type 26 produced . The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used is unique to the weapon . The Type 26 has a double @-@ action only mechanism and is therefore difficult to aim accurately . The Type 26 was replaced by the Nambu pistol in the first half of the 20th century . 
 = = History = = 
 Known as the Meiji 26 Nen Ken Ju ( meaning " Pistol , Pattern of the 26th year of the Meiji era " ) , the Type 26 revolver was the first indigenous revolver adopted by the Japanese military . The Type 26 was produced to replace the aging Smith & Wesson New Model No. 3 and was officially adopted March 29 , 1894 . The design is widely believed to be a mixture of features taken from other revolvers . The lock design is similar to <unk> designs , the hinged frame is similar to Smith & Wesson designs , and the hinged side plate covering the lock is similar to the Modèle 1892 revolver . The cartridge was loaded with black powder until 1900 when the cartridges began to be loaded with smokeless powder . The Type 26 is considered a remarkable leap in Japanese pistol development despite the international influence , with the matchlock being the most common domestic Japanese handgun 40 years earlier . Production stopped after 1923 when much of the Koishikawa Arsenal was destroyed in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake , with assembly continuing until the exhaustion of stockpiled parts . Approximately 59 @,@ 000 Type 26 revolvers were produced and an additional 900 revolvers were made in pre @-@ production . Restoration and re @-@ issue of revolvers that had been removed from service because of damage or wear , was carried out on an as needed basis over a period of many years . The original Type 26s are missing the external markings of later produced revolvers and are identifiable by numbers stamped on internal parts . Type 26s were still being used in 1945 which , according to firearms expert and author Ian Hogg , is considered a testament to their original workmanship and a much more suitable combat weapon than later Japanese produced pistols . 
 = = Design = = 
 The Type 26 revolver is 231 mm ( 9 @.@ 09 in ) in length and 130 mm ( 5 @.@ 12 in ) tall , weighing 880 g ( 1 lb <unk> ) unloaded . It has an octagonal barrel , with the foresight blade being embedded directly into the barrel . The rear sight is incorporated into the top of the frame . A hinged <unk> allows access to the mechanism for lubricating and servicing . The weapon was opened by lifting the top latch , after which the barrel was swung downward , activating the automatic ejector . The notch that allows access to the cylinder is at the top rear of the frame . The revolver is double @-@ action only because of the absence of a cocking spur , intended to avoid snagging on clothing and firing accidentally . The lock was self @-@ cocking and was slow to respond . The delay in response made accurate shooting virtually impossible . The cylinder contains a serious design flaw , with it only notching while the hammer is cocked . This allows the cylinder to revolve by being brushed against an object or the inertia from a sudden sideways motion . As the cylinder can move freely , an empty or already fired chamber can rotate into position instead of the next shot , a dangerous event for the user during combat . Later Type 26 Revolvers have grips with lateral serrations in place of an earlier <unk> pattern as well as differences in external finish , depth , and look of die stamped markings . The bluing of the steel is excellent , even though the steel used is soft compared to Western standards . The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used by the Type 26 is unique to the weapon . Both the Type 26 Revolver and the ammunition used was later replaced by semi @-@ automatic pistols such as the Nambu in the beginning of the 20th century . 
 = = Five production periods = = 
 Differences in markings and appearance across surviving Type 26 revolvers , has led to the categorization of production runs into five categories . 
 = = = Limited early production with no markings = = = 
 Early production Type 26s have no external markings . The revolvers have markings that indicate they were arsenal re @-@ worked and believed to have been produced in late 1893 or early 1894 before official adoption . It is possible that around 300 revolvers with no external marking were produced . No known examples of Type 26 revolvers have duplicate serial numbers . 
 = = = Limited early production = = = 
 A small number of revolvers are known to have the external arsenal symbol stamped but without the external serial number stamped on the frame . The revolvers are interspersed among revolvers with standard production markings for unknown reasons . This production range has examples reported to chamber .38 S & W ammunition but this could be because of later modification . 
 = = = Standard production = = = 
 All standard production Type 26s have checked pattern grip panels as well as original finished characteristics . Most standard production revolvers have a serial number that is between 1 @,@ 000 and 58 @,@ 900 . The standard production models suffered from extreme wear because of the long military service the revolvers served . 
 = = = Limited final production = = = 
 The final production revolvers were possibly produced after the Great Kantō earthquake and possibly only 325 of these revolvers were produced . Known examples have serial numbers ranging from 58 @,@ 903 and 59 @,@ 227 . 
 = = = Arsenal reworked = = = 
 Arsenal reworked Type 26s lack the bright charcoal blue finish or standard checked patterned grip panels . <unk> grip panels are common among reworked Type 26s and the marking of the Nagoya Arsenal indicate repairing of the Type 26 past its production at the <unk> Arsenal . Two existing arsenal reworked Type 26s show stampings of Siamese numerals on the front grips indicating official procurement by the Thai government . Two additional reworked Type 26s have a five @-@ pointed star stamped on the side plate of the revolver indicating Indonesian service after World War II .
